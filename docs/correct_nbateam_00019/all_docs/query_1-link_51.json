        "text": "Nikola Jokic is known for being one of the best offensive players in the NBA. Whether it's shooting, rebounding, or passing, he has the entire package. While most don't give his passing as much love as his shooting, Chauncey Billups tends to disagree.\n\nAfter the Nuggets defeated the Trail Blazers last week, Chauncey Billups was asked if Jokic reminds him of any other players from his era. Billups immediately said no, and gave Jokic some incredibly high praise.\n\n\"He's the best passer I've ever seen,\" Billups said. \"Excluding, no position. He's the best I've ever seen, passing.\"\n\nThis season, Nikola Jokic is averaging 26.3 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 9.0 assists on 59/36/82 shooting. He's fourth in the league in assists, only behind Tyrese Haliburton, Trae Young, and Luka Doncic. Last season, Jokic was averaging even higher during the regular season at 9.8 assists, and 9.5 assists during the playoffs. It's very clear that when it's time for Jokic to turn it up into another gear, he's very capable of doing it.\n\nIt's important to note that Jokic's assist numbers shouldn't entirely determine how skilled he is at passing. His numbers were far less during Jamal Murray's injured years, and basketball is a team game - Jokic can't get an assist without someone else making the shot.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Nikola Jokic wins another MVP this season, it's amazing to see him universally get recognition the way he does now.\n\nMichael Malone Reveals Hilarious Moment With Nikola Jokic After Ejection\n\nVictor Wembanyama Makes History vs. Nuggets"
