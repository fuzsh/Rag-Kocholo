The gala will also feature national recording artist and grammy nominated R&B singer, Kenny Lattimore who will provide live entertainment for the evening.\n\nThe gala will take place Saturday, July 27 at 5:30 p.m. at the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center. The event includes a cocktail hour, live and silent auctions, dinner, and a conversation with Billups and sports commentator and former Denver Nuggets player, Scott Hastings. The evening will also celebrate Coach Lonnie Porter's transition to Founder Emeritus.\n\nThe Porter-Billups Leadership Academy was established in 1996 by Regis University Menâ€™s Basketball Head Coach Lonnie Porter and his daughter, Staci Porter-Bentley. The Porter-Billups Leadership Academy at Regis University provides a summer academy for 3rd through 12th graders that cultivates character development through an extensive academic curriculum and provides exposure to career opportunities for young leaders in their pursuit of individual success.\n\nThe organization gained the support of Billups in 2006 to act as a positive role model and promote individual values, academic excellence, and leadership skills.\n\nProceeds from the gala and fundraiser will benefit the Porter-Billups Leadership Academy programs held each summer on the Regis University campus. Registration is now open at porterbillups-denver.org/gala"
