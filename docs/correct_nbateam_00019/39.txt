Chauncey Ray Billups (born September 25, 1976 in Denver, Colorado) is a player for the NBA's Detroit Pistons. He played college basketball at the University of Colorado. He was drafted third overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was traded midway through his first season. He played for the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves before finding a home in Detroit as the team's starting point guard.

Billups helped lead the Pistons to the 2004 NBA championship, averaging 21 points per game and 5.2 assists in the NBA Finals to earn the Finals MVP Award.

Billups is an outstanding free-throw and 3-point shooter, which has earned him the nickname "Mr. Big Shot." He has also received the nickname "Smooth" for his running of the floor. He is a good defender and a solid playmaker, and is a feared "clutch player", who often takes and makes the last shot for his team. He is versatile enough to play shooting guard if the need arises.
