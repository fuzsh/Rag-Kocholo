DENVER â€” The Denver Nuggets are saddened that All-Star Carmelo Anthony's trade demands meant they had to say goodbye to hometown favorite Chauncey Billups, too.

The Nuggets dealt their two most popular players along with some backups to the New York Knicks for a package of four young players, three draft picks and cash in a megadeal that will be finalized Tuesday.

Denver coach George Karl said he was relieved the Anthony trade saga was finally over but lamented the loss of Billups, who led the Nuggets to the Western Conference finals two years ago after he was acquired from the Detroit Pistons.

With the newcomers not expected to arrive and take their physicals until Wednesday, the Nuggets will have just nine players in uniform for their game against Memphis on Tuesday night.
