Polk is interred at the Tennessee State Capitol, in Nashville.\n\nWas the cemetery always on the site?\n\nThe cemetery was moved to the current site in 1988 because it was in the path of construction for I-485. It was originally located near what is now Sterling Elementary and Crown Memorial Park.\n\n​Can I bring my bike to the cemetery?\n\nWe ask that you please leave bikes outside of the cemetery to help us preserve the area for generations to come. Bike racks are available at the front of the visitor's center near the handicap parking spaces.\n\nWho's Who in Polk Cemetery?​"
