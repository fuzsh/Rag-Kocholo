The supreme source of info right now is Dennis Ward, as well as Jane Ikemura, Sharon Dover Romanek, and all the other members of the Tyner mailing list, accessible through ROOTSWEB. I highly recommend that you join this group if you're interested in the family. Also, as I work, I'm trying to substitute \"at\" for the @ symbol, to prevent spammers' searchbots from collecting the email addies of people who've helped me in this research. Finally, in searching, be aware that the name is variously spelled as Tynes, Tinor, Tiner, or Tyner.\n\nGENERATION NO. 7, Part 1\n\n238.

He married MARY ANN ALLEN August 01, 1840 in Johnston County, North Carolina, USA. She was born Abt. 1818 in North Carolina, USA. Since this isn't one of my direct ancestors, I'm willing to believe I merely copied someone's family tree into mine. I was very naïve when I started this decades ago. Not only is it unlikely that John Pearce Tyner went to North Carolina to have Ransom, Ransom isn't listed with the other children in a gift deed list dated 25 August 1847, in the courthouse of Marion County, MS. Ancestry.com has another family tree claiming this Ransom is the son of a Caty Benson and Jacob Tyner, neither of whom appear in my data. It's at https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/79263507/person/44400509053/facts and the sources are two other Ancestry family trees. Of course, trusting this is as naïve as I was trusting whatever tree I found Ransom in.\n\nNotes for RANSOM CLAUDIUS TYNER:\n\nNorth Carolina Marriage Collection, 1741-2004\n\nName: Ransom Tiner\n\nSpouse: Mary Ann Allen\n\nMarriage Date: 1 Aug 1840\n\nMarriage County: Johnston\n\nMarriage State: North Carolina\n\nSource Vendor: County Court Records - FHL # 0546455-0546460\n\nSource: Family History Library, Salt Lake City, UT\n\n1850 census, Johnston Co.

He married (1) MERANZIA WOODALL Abt. 1868, daughter of FREDERICK WOODALL and ABIGAIL ?. She was born February 05, 1844 in Richmond County, North Carolina, USA, and died December 01, 1884. (Or did he? The census calls her Ann, and the death certificate for their son William R. Tyner says her name was MARANDA MUSE. What's more, some family trees online marry Meranzia Woodall to James Berry Tyner, Alexander's brother, instead! Michael Davis believes the first wife was Maranda Ann Muse, not a Meranzia. See http://genforum.genealogy.com/tyner/messages/1423.html) He married (2) ANNIE ELIZABETH MCDOUGALD February 010, 1882 in Blue Spring Township, Robeson, North Carolina, daughter of ALEXANDER MCDOUGALD and EMELINE WEBSTER. She was born March 01, 1865 in Scotland, and died September 20, 1936 in Gulf, North Carolina, USA. The license was taken out 7 February 1887, and the Presbyterian minister was Hector McLean, which may explain the middle name of one son.\n\nNotes for ALEXANDER TYNER:\n\nDetail: Year: 1880; Census Place: Blue Springs, Robeson, North Carolina; Roll: T9_979; Family History Film: 1254979; Page: 458.4000; Enumeration District: 176; Image: 0397.\n\nAlexander Tyner...26...NC, NC, NC...farmer\n\nAnn Tyner...34...NC, NC, NC\n\nJames Tyner...9...NC, NC, NC\n\nAnnie Tyner...7...NC, NC, NC\n\nWilliam Tyner...6...NC, NC, NC\n\n1900 Census Scotland County, North Carolina\n\nAlex Tyner...
