        "text": "Members of a state House subcommittee have approved a revised measure to bring the remains of late U.S. President James K. Polk home to Columbia.\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 141, supported by Michael Curcio, R-Dickson; Shelia Butt, R-Columbia; Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald; and House Speaker Beth Harwell, R-Nashville; will now be heard by the full state House committee Tuesday.\n\nIf it receives approval, next week, it will then go before the full House.\n\n“I think today’s success comes from a lot of hard work from a lot of people working together through this process,” said Tom Price, the former curator of the James K. Polk Home and Museum, and newly appointed director of the Maury County Archives.\n\nPrice, who serves as a member of the James K. Polk Memorial Association, which initiated the project, said Harwell and Curcio’s dedication brought the proposal to the board, despite last week’s motion to send the proposal to summer study.\n\n“I am pleased that my colleagues on the House State Government Subcommittee have reflected on the intent of this important measure and have recognized its importance by advancing it,” Curcio said in a press release. “It is only fitting that we honor our former president by passing Senate Joint Resolution 141; I am eager to ensure that this happens in the weeks ahead.”\n\nThe revised version, approved by the subcommittee on Wednesday, includes the added requirement that a state archeologist must be present for the relocation process.\n\n“We are excited about it, and will work hard behind the scenes to give as much support as we can,” Price said. “Polk wanted to be buried where his legacy resided. But since his home in Nashville was sold outside of the family and torn down in 1901, the Polk Home in Columbia is the only home still standing other than the White House that he ever lived in. That is the place where people come and learn about his life and legacy.”\n\nPrice also credits the members of the Polk Association and the Polk family for their dedication and support to the proposed relocation.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about family members being against it, and that is just not the case,” Price said. “There has been a lot of support.”\n\nCritics of the move include state historian Carroll Van West.\n\n“I oppose any effort to move President Polk’s grave and monument from Capitol Hill,” West said on social media nearly a year ago. “Such a move in fact would detract from rather than add to the value and significance of the Polk Boyhood Home in Columbia. The Polks have rested in peace on Capitol Hill for almost 125 years — it is most appropriate that they continue to do so.”\n\nOriginally sent to a summer study committee by the panel last week, the resolution outlining the relocation of Polk and his wife Sarah’s tomb from the grounds of the State Capitol to the President James K. Polk Home and Museum in Maury County passed in the state Senate 20-6 last March, sponsored by Hensley.\n\nHensley argued that the tomb’s current location is “widely ignored,” and not ADA accessible. He also debated that, according to his will, it was where Polk wanted to be buried.\n\nLocal supporters of the project, including historians, legislators and corporate unions like United Auto Workers, have all said the primary intent of the relocation is to properly honor Polk’s legacy as president, and that having him buried at his former childhood home would be more in accordance with his will, which said he be buried at his residence.\n\nThey also say it would create more educational opportunities for visitors to the Polk Home and Museum.\n\nPolk died of cholera in Nashville just months after leaving the White House in 1849. Having been interred at three separate places since his death, Polk’s rest has not been a peaceful one.\n\nHe was first buried at a municipal cemetery near Nashville’s city limits, in accordance to a city ordinance. By 1850, his remains were moved to Polk Place, his home a few blocks from the State Capitol.\n\nSarah lived out her years in the large southern mansion until her death in 1891.\n\nFollowing a legal battle, Polk Place was sold and demolished in 1893. The president’s body was then moved to the Capitol, where the president currently rests alongside Sarah. The tomb, which fist stood at Polk Place, was designed by William Strickland, the noted architect and civil engineer who also planned the Tennessee State Capitol and Independence Hall in Philadelphia and many other iconic American structures.\n\nIn order to carry out the move, the Polk Association and its supporters must receive approval from the state House, the Davidson County Chancery Court, the Tennessee Historical Commission and the Tennessee Capitol Commission.\n\n“It has been a matter of educating the public on what the James K. Polk Memorial Association is,” Price said.\n\nThe President James K. Polk Home and Museum first opened in 1929, and serves as a center of education and preservation of the president’s era. It is a main historic site for the 11th president and houses the largest collection of Polk artifacts.\n\nPolk’s legacy includes the founding of the U.S. Naval Academy, the Washington Monument and the first postage stamp. During his presidency from 1845 to 1849, Polk led the nation through the ratification of the Oregon Treaty, the Texas annexation and the Mexican-American War."
