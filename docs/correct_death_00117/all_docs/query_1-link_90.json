        "text": "Few politicians have accomplished more in their political career than the 11th President of the United States James K. Polk. As a U.S. Congressman, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Governor of Tennessee, and President of the United States, Polk had his wife Sarah by his side acting as his closest advisor throughout his political career. Together they changed America, doing much to expand its boundaries from the Atlantic to Pacific.\n\nThe only surviving residence of James K. Polk other than the White House is his ancestral home in Columbia, Tennessee. It is one of the best examples of Federal-style architecture in Tennessee. Samuel Polk, a prosperous farmer and surveyor, built the house in 1816 while his oldest son James was attending the University of North Carolina. When the future President graduated in 1818, he returned to Tennessee and stayed there with his parents until his marriage to Sarah Childress in 1824. While living in his familyâ€™s Columbia home, James practiced law and began his political career by successfully running for the state legislature. Visitors today get to see original possessions of President and Mrs. Polk including furniture, paintings, clothing, and White House china."
