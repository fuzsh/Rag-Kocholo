        "text": "Nominated by Democratic Convention. Former President Van Buren was a candidate but failed to receive the 2/3 votes necessary on the first ballot. Polk received no votes until the 8th ballot; nominated unanimously on the 9th. The first “dark horse” candidate.\n\nFirst Annual Message. States that the Americas are “not to be considered as subjects for colonization by any European powers.” Addresses ongoing negotiation with Britain about Oregon. States that admission of Texas only awaits an act of Congress.\n\nIn Message to Congress, urges division among lands of the Cherokee tribe, “experience has proved that they have not yet advanced to such a state of civilization as to dispense with the guardian care and control of the Government of the United States.”\n\nFirst Mexican-U.S. military clash. An American reconnaissance party was attacked by a superior Mexican unit. A total of 11 were killed, Five wounded, and the other 47 Americans were captured.\n\nIn a Special Message, gives notice to Congress that Oregon Treaty ratifications had been exchanged in London 07/17/1846, and calls for organization of a Territorial Government in Oregon. Laws regulating relations with Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains should be extended to the Oregon territory. Congressional approval was held up by disagreements about slavery in the territory.\n\nCayuse Indians attack the Whitman Mission near Walla Walla (in Oregon territory) killing 14 settlers. In reaction, a volunteer militia was formed to punish the attackers. Reaction in Washington, D.C. eventually resulted in the August 1848 establishment of the Oregon Territory. (See entries for 5/29/1848 and 8/14/1848).\n\nVetoed Wisconsin Territory internal improvements bill. Polk objected that the bill provided funds for internal improvements beyond the Wisconsin Territory. Provides a long history of controversy about internal improvements. Points to “. . .the tendency of power to concentration in the hands of the General Government.” (This was a pocket veto.)\n\nIn a Special Message to the House, refuses to disclose all instructions given to an emissary (Slidell) on grounds that doing so is incompatible “with the public interests.”\n\nSpecial Message to Congress urging immediate action on Oregon. Polk recounts messages from Oregon that Indians had recently “raised ‘the war whoop and crimsoned their tomahawks in the blood of their citizens;’ that they apprehend that ‘many of the powerful tribes inhabiting the upper valley of the Columbia have formed an alliance for the purpose of carrying on hostilities against their settlements;’ that the number of the white population is far inferior to that of the savages;. . . “ Calls for establishing a Territorial Government.\n\nSigned act establishing the Territory of Oregon, providing a lengthy signing statement (9 Stat 323). Discusses at some length the issue of slavery in the Territories. States that he approved this bill because it was not inconsistent with the Missouri Compromise (i.e., did not apply to area south of the 36° 30’ parallel). The bill included the “Wilmot Proviso” restricting the new territory to the conditions of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance prohibiting slavery in the territories."
