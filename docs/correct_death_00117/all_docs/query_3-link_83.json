        "text": "Outside of Charlotte, North Carolina in the town of Pineville is the birthplace of America’s eleventh president. On November 2, 1795, James K. Polk was born in a log cabin on a 150-acre farm on land owned by his father in this corner of Mecklenburg County. The eldest of ten children, Polk spent his youth here along the Little Sugar Creek before moving west to Tennessee. Today, the James K. Polk home is a state historic site dedicated to his memory and honoring the legacy of America’s eleventh president.\n\nVisitor Center and Museum\n\nBegin your visit at the Visitor Center and Museum. Here, guests travel a historic timeline outlining the life of President Polk. The brief historical sketch gives a glimpse into the family’s arrival to the area. It also follows James K. Polk’s life, touches on his early political days, highlights of his administration such as the Mexican American War, Oregon boundary dispute, and the annexation of California. There’s also a brief film and various mementos and artifacts which belonged to the family.\n\nThe Homestead\n\nThough not the original buildings, the reconstructed homestead represents what is believed to be a relatively close facsimile of the Polk farm as it existed in the late 18th century. Touring the home and kitchen, guests are able to envisage what life was like for the Polk family at the time of the 11th president’s birth. The home was reconstructed in the late 1960s using historic documents and other information in order to recreate the buildings as accurately as possible. Based on the materials used and size of the buildings, it’s surmised that the Polks were prosperous farmers.\n\nTours and Events\n\nGuided tours of the home take place throughout the day. It’s worth taking the tour to gain insights into the details of the home, the family, and farm life in the 18th century. This is an ideal destination for families, field trips, and homeschool groups to visit, explore and experience the life and times of an American president. There are also special events held onsite and a full calendar of unique festivities – check the website for upcoming events you might want to schedule your visit around.\n\nVisitors may learn about frontier cooking in the Polk kitchen. Check in advance for dates and events scheduled.\n\nCemetery\n\nAfter visiting the museum, touring the home and kitchen, exploring the grounds, you may also wish to venture towards the back corner of the property and see the Polk family cemetery. The eleventh president is buried in Tennessee, but several of Polk’s relatives and ancestors are interred on the property.\n\nVisiting\n\nLocated just outside of Charlotte in Pineville, North Carolina, the James K. Polk State Historic Site is open Tuesday through Saturday 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. Admission is free, but donations are welcomed and greatly appreciated. There’s also a small gift shop where visitors may purchase a variety of presidential souvenirs to commemorate their visit.\n\nIs this a spellbinding experience?\n\nProbably not. However, if you’re a history buff like I am, or you’re in the area, it’s a fantastic spot to spend an hour or two with President James K. Polk.\n\nHEY, PINNERS!
