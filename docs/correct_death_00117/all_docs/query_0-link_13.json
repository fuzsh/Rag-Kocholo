        "text": "OK, so I realize this is a little bit morbid, but I'm going to be focusing on the deaths of all our beloved Presidents. Some have gone out with a bang (no pun intended), and some went quietly So, I'm basically going to give the name, date, age, the cause of death, place of burial, and last words (if there were any).\n\nPresident: George Washington\n\nDate: December 14th, 1799\n\nAge: 67\n\nCause of Death: Pneumonia/Throat infection. Washington had been out riding around his plantation for hours in the snow and freezing rain. He later ate supper that night without changing out of his clothes. He woke up in the morning with a severely sore throat. As was the practice at the time, he was bled several times by doctors. He died shortly after from his ailment.\n\nLast Words: The last words written in his journal are: \"'Tis Well.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Mount Vernon, Virginia\n\nPresident: John Adams\n\nDate: July 4th, 1826\n\nAge: 90 (he held the record for longest living President until Ronald Reagan)\n\nCause of Death: Being incredibly old. He had a heart attack probably caused by arteriosclerosis.\n\nLast Words: \"Thomas Jefferson survives.\" Jefferson did not live, he had died a little before Adams.\n\nPlace of Burial: United First Parish Church, Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nPresident: Thomas Jefferson\n\nDate: July 4th, 1826\n\nAge: 83\n\nCause of Death: Jefferson was basically stuck in bed for the last year of his life, suffering from various illnesses. His death is attributed to either dehydration from dysentery or complications from pneumonia.\n\nLast Words: \"Is it the fourth yet?\" It was. Jefferson died within the hour. Both Adams and Jefferson, the best of friends and the worst of enemies died on the 50th anniversary of the signing of The Declaration of Independence. Spooky.\n\nPlace of Burial: Monticello, Charlettsville, Virginia. The epitaph on Jefferson's grave says nothing of his tenure as President, just lines about him being the writer of the Declaration of Independence, the father of the University of Virginia, and lover of the separation of church and state. Everything Jefferson owned had to be sold off since he died poor as dirt. He didn't spend money wisely and often bought lavishly for interior decorating.\n\nPresident: James Madison\n\nDate: June 28th, 1836. Madison was the last of the Founders to die.\n\nAge: 85\n\nCause of Death: Old age/heart attack\n\nLast Words: \"I always talk better lying down.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Montpelier, Virginia\n\nPresident: James Monroe\n\nDate: July 4th, 1831\n\nAge: 73\n\nCause of Death: Combination of heart failure and TB. No, not Taco Bell...Tuberculosis. I wouldn't mind dying by Taco Bell, though.\n\nLast Words: His last words were actually about James Madison. \"I regret that I am about to die without again beholding him.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Originally buried at the New York City Marble Cemetery, he was later transported to the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nPresident: John Quincy Adams\n\nDate: February 23rd, 1848\n\nAge: 80\n\nCause of Death: Two days earlier he had been in the House of Representatives who were discussing if they should present swords to honor officers of the Mexican-American War. While everyone yelled out \"ayes\" in favor of this, Adams, who was completely against this, stood up and shouted \"No!\" He then had a massive stroke and fell into his fellow House member's arms. He died two days later. So, I guess you could say that he was struck down by God for being a jackass.\n\nLast Words: \"I hate every single one of those lousy Mexican-American war veterans! I'll give them a sword straight up their...*cough* *cough* *wheeeeeze* *eye's rolling back*.\" OK, that wasn't really it, but I'm sure it entered his head a few times after the stroke. His real last words were: \"This is the last of earth. I am content.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: United First Parish Church, Quincy, Massachusetts. Same as his father.\n\nPresident: Andrew Jackson\n\nDate: June 8th, 1845\n\nAge: 78\n\nCause of Death: Jackson was one of the more sickly Presidents. He had a bullet stuck in his lung from a duel and it caused him to have terrible headaches and a chronic cough. He eventually died of a combination of chronic tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure. Geez, talk about overkill.\n\nLast Words: \"Oh do not cry, and be good children-we will all meet in Heaven.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: The Hermitage, Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nPresident: Martin Van Buren\n\nDate: July 24th, 1862. Van Buren outlived his four successors.\n\nAge: 79\n\nCause of Death: Heart failure and bronchitis. Ain't nobody got time for that.\n\nLast Words: \"There is but one reliance.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Kinderhook Cemetery, Kinderhook, New York\n\nPresident: William Henry Harrison\n\nDate: April 4th, 1841. Remember, he died a month after he was elected. Bad luck.\n\nAge: 68\n\nCause of Death: Harrison developed a cold a few weeks after his inauguration and it got worse from there. The popular theory that he got the cold from his lack of coat and hat at his freezing inaugural address is apparently untrue. He died nine days after getting sick, officially of pneumonia and jaundice.\n\nLast Words: Spoken to his doctor, but probably meant for John Tyler: \"I wish that you could understand the principles of government. I ask them to be carried out. I ask nothing more.\" The doctor was probably like, \"Yep, I'll get right on that.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: North Bend, Ohio\n\nPresident: John Tyler\n\nDate: January 18, 1862\n\nAge: 71\n\nCause of Death: He suffered from continuous bouts of dysentery at the end of his life, but most believe he died from a stroke.\n\nLast Words: \"Doctor, I am going. Perhaps it is best.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. Fun Fact: Tyler is the only President to not have his death recognized in Washington. Tyler allied himself with the Confederacy in his old age even going so far as to join their House of Representatives, thus he was basically disowned by the U.S. government at the time. Jefferson Davis had a memorial for him instead.\n\nPresident: James K. Polk\n\nDate: June 15, 1849. Polk had the shorted retirement from the presidency at 103 days. He is also the youngest President to die in retirement.\n\nAge: 53\n\nCause of Death: Polk entered the presidency full of life and left it with little left. He is probably the only President that made a list of goals for his presidency and actually accomplished all of them. This had its drawbacks, however. He contracted cholera in New Orleans during a goodwill tour in the South and it gradually got worse.\n\nLast Words: \"I love you, Sarah. I love you for all eternity.\" Awww...too bad he too was speaking to his doctor. Just kidding....I think.\n\nPlace of Burial: State Capital grounds, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nPresident: Zachery Taylor\n\nDate: July 9th, 1850\n\nAge: 65\n\nCause of Death: This one is sort of a mystery. Taylor had been consuming a ton of cold milk and cherries during a holiday celebration, and he became very ill a few days later. He most likely died from cholera, severe diarrhea, or perhaps even a severe case of gastroenteritis. He was the second President to die in office.\n\nLast Words: \"I regret nothing, but I am sorry that I'm about to leave my friends.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Zachery Taylor National Cemetery, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nPresident: Millard Fillmore\n\nDate: March 8, 1874\n\nAge: 74\n\nCause of Death: Stroke, paralysis.\n\nLast Words: Being fed soup: \"the nourishment is palpable.\"\n\nPlace of Burial:Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, New York\n\nPresident: Franklin Pierce\n\nDate: October 8th, 1869\n\nAge: 64\n\nCause of Death: Pierce was quite the drinker. By that, I mean he was enough of one to die of cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nLast Words: \"I'm not as think as you drunk I am.\" That's my best guess, as nobody knows what his last words were.\n\nPlace of Burial: Old North Cemetery, Concord, New Hampshire. He also allied himself with the Confederacy during the war, but was still honored in Washington at the time of his death, seeing as the war was over.\n\nPresident: James Buchanan\n\nDate: June 1st, 1868\n\nAge: 77\n\nCause of Death: Buchanan caught a cold and it worsened due to his advanced age. He died of respiratory failure.\n\nLast Words: \"I shall carry to my grave the consciousness that at least I meant well for my country. Oh, Lord God, as thou wilt.\" Buchanan was fully aware history would not look back kindly on his presidency. He had received threatening letters from the time he left office til his death, mostly for not doing anything to stop the war.\n\nPlace of Burial: Woodward Hill Cemetery, Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n\nPresident: Abraham Lincoln\n\nDate: April 15th, 1865\n\nAge: 56\n\nCause of Death: Lincoln was shot in the back of the head by John Wilkes Booth while watching Our American Cousin at the Ford's Theater. Lincoln was the first President to be assassinated.\n\nLast Words: \"She won't think anything of it.\" Lincoln had been asked by his wife, Mary Todd, whether it was alright that they hold hands, since Miss Harris could see it. Cute and incredibly sad.\n\nPlace of Burial: Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Illinois\n\nPresident: Andrew Johnson\n\nDate: July 31st, 1875\n\nAge: 66\n\nCause of Death: Johnson had a few strokes and died from complications.\n\nLast Words: Uttered to his daughter after having a stroke and falling out of his chair: \"My right side is paralyzed. I need no doctor. I can overcome my troubles.\"\n\nPlace of Burial: Andrew Johnson National Cemetery, Greensville, Tennessee"
