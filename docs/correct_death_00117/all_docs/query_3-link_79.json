        "text": "James K. Polk\n\nEleventh President, 1845-1849\n\nCampaign:\n\nIn 1844, James K. Polk became the first dark horse candidate to win the presidency, beating Henry Clay.\n\nPolk promised that he would be a one-term president.\n\nChallenges:\n\nJames K. Polk was an avowed expansionist, committed to acquiring California and New Mexico from Mexico even at the risk of war.\n\nPolk acquired the then British-held territory of Oregon and negotiated for its border to be located along the 49th parallel.\n\nMajor Acts:\n\nCongress declared war with Mexico in 1846.\n\nIn 1848, Mexico ceded California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and parts of Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico—more than fifty percent of Mexico at the time—to the U.S. for fifteen million dollars.\n\nLegacy:\n\nDuring James K. Polk’s four years in office, the nation acquired vast lands that expanded the country to reach across the continent to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPolk was a tireless achiever and left the White House in a state of exhaustion. He died four months later."
