        "text": "Cheatham County Mayor Kerry McCarver is one of 72 county mayors statewide to express support of moving President James K. Polk’s tomb and remains from the Tennessee State Capitol to the James K. Polk Ancestral Home and Museum in Columbia, an endeavor that stirred some debate last year.\n\nMcCarver noted in his Oct. 16 letter in support of the initiative – dubbed the Journey Home for James K. Polk – that the Columbia site is a National Historical Landmark, owned by the state, and the move would “fulfill the last will and testament” of the 11th president of the U.S.\n\nHe also noted that there would be a “solemn ceremony” to move the remains, and that the home and museum would be willing to fundraise, easing cost to taxpayers.\n\nMcCarver said when the group spearheading the effort contacted him explaining Polk's story and the reason behind the desired relocation, he \"didn’t see anything wrong with that.\"\n\nThe state legislature passed Senate Joint Resolution 141 last March, moving forward with the relocation of Polk’s tomb and remains, as well as that of former First Lady Sarah Polk. The Columbia site is the last home in existence – other than the White House – in which Polk lived.\n\nPolk died a few months after leaving office in 1849. He was initially buried on the \"outskirts of town\" within 24 hours because of “a city ordinance created to keep the spread of cholera in check,” the Journey Home for James K. Polk Facebook page states.\n\nHis will, however, stated that he wanted to be buried at home: Polk Place in Nashville. He was exhumed and moved to the location nearly a year after his death, but after Sarah Polk died in 1891, more than 50 family members initiated a legal battle that relocated the Polks again.\n\nThe relatives argued that a deceased man could not have legal authority to determine the future of the property in perpetuity, and a Davidson County court agreed, a release from Nashville Public Relations Firm the Andrews Agency states.\n\nAccording to the release, they “then sold the property and split the proceeds, and despite some efforts to preserve Polk Place, the home was sold to a developer in 1900 and torn down a year later for an apartment complex.”\n\nThe Polks were moved to the Tennessee State Capitol in 1893, where they’re currently located.\n\nAlong with McCarver, Maury County Mayor Charlie Norman voiced support for moving the former president and first lady: “People come here from all over the country and the world to visit the Polk Home to learn about President and Mrs. Polk,” his letter reads, in part. “\n\nBut the resolution hasn't gone without opposition.\n\nExecutive Director and State Historic Preservation Officer of the Tennessee Historical Commission E. Patrick McIntyre, for example, detailed in a letter to the James K. Polk Memorial Association last year why he wasn't in favor of the effort to move the former president's remains from the capitol.\n\n“Moving the tomb 50 miles and placing it within or adjacent to the National Historic Landmark setting at the Polk Home would take away a historic element from the Capitol grounds and falsely change the historic setting surrounding the Polk Home,” McIntyre wrote in the letter, according to a previous report.\n\nSome of Polk's descendants are also among those who expressed opposition last year, though the distant relatives were reportedly split as well.\n\nWhen asked about the opposing views, McCarver said he doesn't \"expect 100 percent support on anything...When you throw politics in there, good luck.\"\n\nHe said his one letter of support is \"as far as I'm going to go,\" citing the lack of direct impact to Cheatham County and issues of higher priority.\n\nThe House of Representatives would have to pass the joint resolution, and the Tennessee Historical Commission and the Tennessee Capitol Commission would each have to sign off before the Chancery Court of Davidson County makes the final determination on whether the tombs can be moved, according to the release.\n\nKelly Fisher, reporter for the Ashland City Times, can be reached at KPFisher@gannett.com, 615-801-3866 or on Twitter at @KellyPFisher."
