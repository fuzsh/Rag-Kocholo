        "text": "and Selected Descendants\n\nAuthored by Lyle Rockwell with\n\nResearch by Lorin Larry Pardoe and Mary Mys\n\nOverview\n\nWe have started the family history of the parents of Charles Mullan *of Elkland Township, Sullivan County, PA: Anthony and Martha Beatty McMullan of New York City, NY. The story progresses from there and eventually moves from Pennsylvania to Iowa. Charles Mullans grandson, also named Charles Mullan, was one of the original settlers of Waterloo, Black Hawk County, Iowa.\n\nEditor's Note: Lyle Rockwell and Larry Pardoe are well established historians of Sullivan County and the families who settled there. The reader can find numerous historical entries, comments, and posted documents and records from Lyle and Larry through this site, by using the available search engine to do so. Mary Mys, a resident of Wisconsin, is a historian of Black Hawk County, Iowa, where Charles Mullan first relocated when he left Pennsylvania. Our site, the Sullivan County Genealogical Web Page is most grateful to these historians once again for their efforts on behalf of recording our posterity. Please direct any comments, suggestions or updates to Bob Sweeney, administrator for this site, and to the authors. You can reach our contributors, respectively, at:\n\nLyle Rockwell\n\nLarry Pardoe\n\nMary Mys\n\nOctober 2009\n\nUpdated March 2017\n\nThe reader may also want to find out more about the various families related to the Mullans by blood or marriage. Here is a short but useful list of sources on this site:\n\nLetters to Charles Mullan in Illinois (1842)\n\nDescendants of Philip Haberle\n\nDescendants of John Warburton and Mary Sadler\n\nDescendants of William Reinbold [Rinebold]\n\nDescendants of Conrad Dieffenbacher\n\nThe Genealogy of William Molyneux.\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Anthony Charles MCMULLAN * was born in Scotland. He died at sea.\n\nSource: Research by Larry Pardoe\n\nMore About ANTHONY MCMULLAN:\n\nImmigration: Abt. 1750, Settled in what is now New York City. He had property on what is now Broadway and it was then called \"The Sugar House Property\".\n\nOccupation: Sea Captain\n\nSource: Mary Mys\n\nI'm still searching Anthony McMullan's wife, Martha Beatty McMullan. If they were living in New York, New York, Sugar Bush is now in the area of 5th Avenue, etc. This would give more credence to the story.\n\nI have their marriage record (New York City Marriages, 1600s-1800s), married 1748, in New York City, New York, New York, and the source listed is \"The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record (quarterly), 1888, selected extracts, published by the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, New York, New York, page 148. The passenger list for the \"George and Anne\" lists:\n\nMartha Beatty, 1729, Pennsylvania; John Beatty, 1729, Pennsylvania; Will? M Beatty; 1729, Pennsylvania; Christiana Beatty 1729 Pennsylvania; Christiana Beatty, son Charles C., Child, 1729; America; Mary Beatty, age 10, 1729 Pennsylvania. Have proof that Martha Beatty's mother was a Christiana Clinton, who married John Beatty and who died on the voyage. The Passenger and Immigration List Index, being the two documents of the Voyage of the \"George and Anne\" by Col. Charles Clinton confirms this, and it is published on Ancestry. Charles Clinton and wife Elizabeth chartered a ship from Dublin, the \"George and Anne\" left the County of Longford, Ireland, for PA 09 May 1729, arriving in America 04 OCT 1729.\n\n* Editor's Note: There is actually some debate about the correct full name of Anthony Charles Mullan. One of our most thoughtful contributors and local historians, Kathy Heilman, raised this issue by e-mail on March 16, 2012. We reproduce her observations here, along with the responses from Larry Pardoe and Lyle Rockwell. The interchange speaks for itself:\n\nMr. Pardoe:\n\nI just had an opportunity to look at your Mullen page. The work I've done on the Mullens needs some real fine-tuning, so might have errors. I have added and corrected quite a bit in the last couple of years, but haven't shared anything in years. I noted with interest that you use the name Anthony Charles McMullen. I haven't found a source identifying Anthony with a middle name. Is that from family records? I do have a couple of references indicating that Anthony was living for at least up to some of his son's teen years. In a will dated September 28, 1755 and proved October 13, 1755, Newil Harris, a deceased New York merchant, bequeathed to Anthony McMillen of New York, mariner, all of his apparel, except his coarse linen, his quadrant, books and sea instruments; to Charles McMillen, son of Anthony McMillen, his Pinchbeck watch, shoe buckles, knee buckles, a pair of gold buttons and a gold ring; to Martha, wife of Anthony McMillen, 10 pounds.\n\nAccording to a 1764 New York Mercury, Anthony McMillan and his wife Martha were suing James Lynch. In the court transcript, James Lynch had to make a public apology for scandalous comments he made about Martha, which he admitted were untrue. In widow Martha McMillan's will dated March 29, 1790 and proved May 14, 1790, she left five shillings to her son Charles as his birthright. The rest of Martha's estate-except for 10 pounds-was left to her Beatty nieces and nephews. The 10 pounds was left to Jonathan Cowdrey, Jr., a New York City house painter who was co-executor with her nephew Dr. John Beatty of Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nWhen I have the opportunity, I'll go over my Mullen material to see what else I have.\n\nKathy Heilman\n\n***********************************************\n\nKathy:\n\nI don't know where the middle name \"Charles\" came from - as I show his name as Anthony McMillan in my tree. I would have to think that Lyle Rockwell added the middle name - from some information other than from me. I see he has a paragraph directly under where he inserted source information from Mary Mys (see above).\n\nIn reply to your question where I got my information, I received:\"Ancestors of Martha Elizabeth Louella Mullen\" from Ken McCarty - this would have been about ten years ago. I don't know if you shared directly with him or if he obtained it from someone else. At the time, we were exchanging our information with Evelyn McCarty Bryan from Picture Rocks so it's possible he might have received it from her - I don't know. (You probably saw my references to your work in some of the Mullan notes? Whenever I used information from your ancestor report I used a source note crediting you with the information.)\n\nAbout three years ago, Lyle and I were exchanging family information and at the time I had shared the Mullan files I had been putting together. He took that and added what he had been working on and thus the resulting page shown on the Sulllivan County Genealogical Web Page.\n\nYou probably already know, but your mother Marion Fetherbay had a brother Glenn who ties into Lyle's Rinebold family and she had sister Florence who married one of my Pardoe family members - thus our interest. That plus the many other inter-family marriages.\n\nThank you for commenting and also for the added information. Please let me know if I haven't answered everything you were wondering about or if there is anything else I might be able to share with you.\n\nLorin \"Larry\" Pardoe\n\n************************************************\n\nI added the middle name \"Charles\" from ancestry.com.\n\nLyle Rockwell\n\n************************************************\n\nLarry and Lyle:\n\nMy only concern was I hope what you used was accurate. I like to check and recheck my work to make sure it's accurate before it's shared online. I've done some more work on the Mullens in the last couple of years, but need to seriously look at it before I give it to you. I suppose one of my cousins could have distributed what I gave them earlier. I've known Evelyn for years, but don't think she would have had access to my Mullen files.\n\nI have quite a bit of information on the Clinton/Beatty line and a copy of Record of the Family of Charles Beatty, which gives a different, somewhat humorous twist to the inheritance issue than is in the Streby History and an uncomplimentary look at Martha's personality. The Rev. Charles Beatty was Martha's brother and his children received the bulk of Martha's estate.\n\nLast evening I found the ancestry.com records with the middle name \"Charles.\" I didn't find any documentation for the middle name with those records, so would hesitate to use it.\n\nAunt Florence was a very special lady. You're probably aware Uncle Glenn died recently; his wife Mary Rinebold Fetherbay is still living. My mother is the last of that generation of Fetherbays.\n\nOnce I have an opportunity to look at my files, I will share what I have with you.\n\nKathy *****************************************************\n\nAnthony married Martha BEATTY, daughter of John BEATTY and Christina CLINTON , on 10 Nov 1748 in New York City, NY.

The son of a wealthy sea captain in New York City, Charles McMullan married a country girl and was disinherited by his mother. To retaliate, he changed his name to Mullan and came with his wife and five children into the wilderness, that later became Sullivan County, in 1796. His mode of transportation was an ox cart drawn by two cows. He located in the Elkland forest on land now owned by J. Lyman Snyder.\n\nOne of the many hardships endured was four day trips through the woods to Muncy with grain to be ground into flour. Four of the five children were daughters. They married, adding the names of Kilmer, Fleming, Boyle and Hoagland to the family tree. The only son, Charles Mullan Jr., married Elizabeth Hoagland, daughter of the first settler of Fox Township. Their six sons multiplied the name and with their two sisters added the names of Warburton and Dieffenbach; Bedford, Grange and Woodhead to the third generation. John Mullen of this generation was the father of thirteen children  10 daughters and 3 sons. They brought, by marriage, the names of Brenchley, Yaw, Fawcett, Hottenstein, Higley and Molyneaux into the clan. Henry Melville Mullan, of this generation, married Mary Kline and was the father of Nelson C. Mullan, who is the only representative of the name left in Sullivan County. Nelson C. Mullan was born 1886 and has spent his life in public service carrying jointly with his son, John, the responsibility of farming three farms containing 240 acres and teaching school thirty-five years plus his service in the Department of Soil Conservation for the state for seven years. He graduated from the Westchester State Teachers College and on Dec. 26, 1908, married Laura Seaboldt, Honey Brook, Chester County, bringing to their name a transfusion of new blood. Their six children represent three age groups. A son and two daughters born in the early years, then a lapse of ten years when a daughter arrived and, after six years, a son and daughter. Ill health caused Mr. Mullen to sell most of the farm to Keith McCarty in 1952. Mr. and Mrs. Mullen enjoy well earned rest in their modernized home. He is the only one of his name\n\nresiding in the county.\"\n\nMore About CHARLES MULLEN:\n\nMilitary service: Revolutionary war - Minute Man\n\nOccupation: Blacksmith\n\nCharles married Martha (____).\n\nThey had the following children.\n\n3 F i.

January 27, 1853.\n\nElaine Frey of Canton, PA is another voluntary contributor with a sense of historical preservation. We began a dialogue on another Web site and she offered to provide various remote cemetery listings to our site. In her own words:\n\n\"The Porter Cemetery is 1.8 miles northwest of Shunk. North of L.R. 56031, it is on the Moody farm. There are approximately 14 fieldstones visible. One of these has the number 19 on it. Another one lying in the woods has the number 17 on it. The main stone is that of JOHN WILCOX, Born 1756, Died 1860. PVT NY Militia - Rev. War. Another field stone with marker says - \"War of 1812 U.S. Veteran\". Yet another stone says \"veteran 1812 - 1814\" There is a \"P. K.\" stone with \"In Memory of Philip Kilmer\" On the left side of that stone is another marked \"B.K.\" On the right side is a stone labeled: \"Bertha Daughter of ?? K?mer\". I could not read the rest. I don't know why this is called the Porter Cemetery. It's another example of what time does to destroy history. Probably lots of people are buried there, but nothing to tell us how many, or who. Due to John Wilcox being there, it is now kept up. The Wilcox family can probably be thanked for this.\"\n\n1880 Fox Twp., Sullivan Co., PA census shows a Edward Kilmer, age 26, b. NY, parents b. NY, with wife Adaline, age 22, b. NY and two daughters Maryetta age 5, b. NY and Cory E. age 2, b. NY. I could not tie them back to Philip, but maybe someone will be able to find a connection someday.

Only one family to settle on a tract (400 acres of land) and they were to have the privilege of purchasing the remainder of the tract at $2.50 per acre. Hence settlers soon located at some distance from each other. Lands were taken up prior to 1806 by Joel McCarty west of the Quaker meeting house, and by Francis Ball and Charles Mullin on the east. The McCarty homestead is owned by Joseph McCarty. On the Charles Mullin farm is now located the village of Eldredsville. The Bull farm was long the home of Joseph Pardoe and is now owned by Barton Luther. Francis Bull was a carpenter by trade. He married a daughter of Robert Lambert, and they were both very active in advancing religious interests; resided in Elkland for over twenty years and then removed to Liberty Corners, near Monroeton, in Bradford county.\n\nCharles Mullin and his son, Charles, are each found among the taxable of 1808. Charles, Jr., married Betsy, a daughter of Joseph Hoagland, and their children were: Joseph, William, Charles, Anthony and John. Hannah married John M. Warburton. Mr. Mullin was a blacksmith by trade and one of the most worthy citizens of the township. He built at his own expense the school house that was long used for church purposes as well as for school. He otherwise aided by personal efforts in sustaining these interests. Three of his sons, Joseph, William and John, settled in the township. Anthony and Charles removed to Iowa. At the time of the organization of the county William Mullin was elected to the office of Recorder of Deeds. He was active in promoting the educational interests of the county. His death occurred when he was about 50 years of age. John Mullin was well known and respected throughout the county and was elected County Commissioner in 1852. He is still living in the township.\n\nCharles married Elizabeth \"Betsey\" HOAGLAND, daughter of Joseph HOAGLAND and Hannah CARPENTER . Elizabeth was born on 1 Oct 1782 in Muncy Township, Lycoming Co., PA. She died on 19 May 1848. She was buried in Mullan-Pardoe-Grange Cemetery, Elkland Township, Sullivan County, PA ..\n\nThey had the following children.\n\n+ 17 F i. Hannah Clara MULLAN was born on 21 Jul 1809.

They show: \"Boyles, Susannah (?), b. January 14, 1780, d. April 29, 1818. Hard to read.\"\n\nAncestors of Martha Elizabeth Louella Mullen, shows name as Susan Mullen. Same source shows b. 1801; married Francis Boyle.

June 4, 1837, infant son.\n\nI don't know who these children belong to, but \"The History of Elkland Township\" by George Streby, page 4 shows that Francis and his 2nd wife had three children that died. (Because of this I am adding these three children of Francis and 2nd wife Nancy). L.P. The fact that another son Francis R., died in 1852, there is the possibility that the unnamed child aged 30 days, above, might have been born to John and Avis Boyles. L.P.\n\n\"History of Elkland Township\" by George Streby, page 4 shows:\n\n\"Francis Boyle and brother John, came from Ireland during the Revolutionary War, when they were 18 and 20 years of age, respectively.

He worked with his father and brothers in breaking up the wilderness and building a farm in the Overton basin. On one occasion, as a young pioneer boy, it fell upon Christian to go in search of the stock. He had only reached a short distance from the clearing, when the dogs came upon a large bear and ran him up a tree. With customary gun in hand, young and timid Christian cautiously moved in not knowing what his prey would be. Discovering a treed bear, Christian assumed a firing position, pulled the trigger and downed the huge beast. However, Christian's father Daniel hearing the frantic barking dogs, and then fearing for the safety of his son, took a second gun and hastened to the spot. Coincidentally he fired his weapon at the very moment his son did. Both balls had penetrated the bear, but neither had produced the desired effect. When the dogs attacked the downed bear, he seized one of them in his powerful claws and began squeezing the life out of the courageous dog. Not wishing to be deprived of his fighter, Daniel took his hunting knife in his hand and attacked the bear. The bear fought desperately while the old hunter gave him several lunges, cutting the bear's vitals away before he would release the dog. The bear was killed and the dog never recovered from his injuries. In 1819, Christian married Miss Hannah Warren of Fox Township, Sullivan County, PA., and began life for himself and his new wife on a tract of land in Overton. He built a log home near a spring just below his father's orchards. Hannah bore Christian one child in 1820, and died the following year in July 1821. In 1822 Christian was remarried to Miss Martha Kilmer. They continued life on the homestead and in 1832 built the first framed barn in Overton. And then again in 1836 the first framed house. Christian was very industrious. He was very liberal in his ideas, enjoyed company, and took special delight in spinning his yarns. His buildings were the neatest and best in the neighborhood. Like his father, he had a fine orchard of cherry and apple trees. He was a man of much pride, inclined to egotism, but was public spirited, and a worthful and highly respected citizen. The home of Christian and Martha was the home for the Methodist preachers to stay when traveling. Both were avid Christians. \"Aunt Martha\", as she was commonly called, was a very neat housekeeper, and an excellent Christian lady, highly esteemed by all.\n\nThey had the following children.\n\n39 M i.

Daniel Wilcox, who performed the marriage ceremony.\n\nA supper was furnished on the occasion, and in the evening a sermon preached.\n\nSource: Bradford County Historical Society, Towanda, PA., card file on Heverlys, as follows: \"Bradford Republican dated Feb 7, 1889 lists the death of Mrs. Rosina Haverly of Overton, on January 23, 1889, age 86 years & 22 days. She was the wife of the late Henry Haverly.\" Rosina (Kilmer) Heverly was a devout Christian, kind mother and neighbor. She was the last surviving of the Overton basin pioneers. Rosina has been quoted in Clement F. Heverly's history volumes as saying, \"The woods were full of wild beasts, and it was not safe to go from one house to another without a gun. The first hog we had, the bears killed and we were required to go to the \"Forks\" for another. Log pens were built for the hogs, sheep and calves, which were yarded in the evening to save them from destruction.\"\n\nThe following obituary was posted on the Ancestry.com message boards on August 22, 2004 by Tina Pastusic:\n\n\"The Sullivan Review January 31, 1889\n\nThe last Pioneer Gone\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon last (January 23) the tolling bell announced to us that the last of that heroic band that braved the hardships and dangers of the wilderness land of Overton three-quarters of a century ago, had passed from earth. Not only was this octogenarian mother the last of these brave men and women whose memories we shall ever cherish with deep feelings of gratitude, but she was the last of the original Heverly family- the pioneer family into Overton.\n\nAunt Rosina Heverly, the subject of this memorial and consort of the late Henry Heverly, was the daughter of Philip and Martha (Mullen) Kilmer. Her birth occurred January 1, 1803, near Albany, N.Y. her parents emigrating to Fox, Sullivan County, Pa, when she was yet a small girl. Here she grew to vigorous womanhood and in the 7th of January 1823 was united in marriage with Henry Heverly, of Overton.\n\nThe marriage at the home of the brides parents was celebrated according to the customs of these primitive days. A supper, the best that could be prepared from plain materials, was enjoyed by those gathered to witness the occasion. The usual good wishes, were extended to the happy couple, and finally in the evening the exercises of that memorable day were closed by the officiating clergyman, Daniel Wilcox, who solemnized the event by a sermon.\n\nThe young bride at once accompanied her husband to his wilderness home and began lifes struggles in earnest, taking up their abode in a log house. She was the eighth bride to be brought to the new settlement.\n\nA home in Overton then was not the most pleasurable one. Briefly in her own words: the woods were full of wild beasts, and it was not safe to go from one house to another without a gun. The first hog we had was killed by the bears, and we were required to go to the Forks for another. Log pens were built for the hogs, sheep and calves to save them from destruction. Thus, surrounded as she was, under all these trying circumstances, she acted her part well in helping to improve and build up the neighborhood.\n\nSoon after her advent into Overton, she with five others met and organized the first Methodist class in this locality. Their work shall live after the, and it is our inspiring thought to know that the good work begun by them has been prospered in Overton. Aunt Rosina was a very devout Christian. She made a profession in early life and died in the Lord, when past her eighty-sixth year.\n\nMany times, before the days of good roads when wagons could not be afforded, she frequently went to Canton, unattended, to attend quarterly meetings.\n\nThis good lady survived her husband over seventeen years, having since his demise resided with her son, Chauncey, who with his estimable wife have administered most patiently and lovingly for the wants of mother in her closing years.\n\nMrs. Heverly was the mother of seven children, all of whom are yet living and all, save one, followed her to the grave on Saturday last, the funeral was largely attended fully a hundred relatives of the deceased being present.\n\nAmong the number were several grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.\n\nThe remains were brought to the M.E. Church at 11 a.m. Reuben Rinebold. Lewis Rinebold, Thomas Strevy, John Strevy, Benj. Houseknecht and Peter Mosier acting as pallbearers.\n\nThe funeral obsequies were conducted by Rev. Jos. Merring who preached from Revelations 14-13. He was assisted by Revs. Retan and Wardall.\n\nAfter the remains were viewed for the last time, they were borne to their final resting place, in the German Reformed Cemetery, and laid beside him whose fortunes she had shared.\"\n\nRosina married Heinrich \"Henry\" HEVERLY, son of Daniel HEVERLY and CATHARINA OTT , on 7 Jan 1823 in Fox Township, Sullivan Co., PA. Heinrich was born on 24 Nov 1803 in , LEHIGH COUNTY, PA. He was christened on 29 Dec 1803 in JORDAN REFORMED, CHURCH. He died on 5 Sep 1871 in OVERTON FORKS, Sullivan, PA. He was buried in ST PAUL CEM, Overton, PA.\n\nRecords of the Jordan Reformed Church, South Whitehall, Whitehall Twp., Lehigh Co., PA:\n\nHenrich, son of Daniel & Katharina Haberly, born 24 Nov 1803, baptized on 29 Dec 1803, sponsored by Henrich & Elisabeth Schmidt.\n\nHenry was a farmer in Overton. His religion was German Reformed. Baptismal records of the Jordan Reformed Church, South Whitehall, Whitehall Twp., Lehigh Co., PA., show the baptismal of Heinrich on Dec. 29, 1803. Baptismal sponsors were Heinrich & Elisabeth Schmidt. Henry Heverly came to Bradford County with his parents in the year 1806, and was only three years old at that time. His father was the first settler in Overton Township. Henry moved to the Overton basin from Greenwood, Bradford Co., OA.(now Powell) with his parents and siblings, in 1809. His boyhood days were spent upon his father's farm. As a lad his father would take him along to retrieve the cows, because he had better hearing and could hear the tinkle of the cow bells. Later he was sent out on his own to retrieve the cows from the woods. On Jan. 7, 1823 he was united in marriage to Miss Rosina Kilmer of Fox, Sullivan Co., PA. The wedding took place at the home of the bride. A supper was furnished, and in the evening a sermon preached. Henry took up lands adjoining his brother Christian, and erected a hewed log home, the first of its type in the neighborhood. Henry and his wife were also the first in the area to enjoy a cook stove. Henry's farm was in Sullivan County, while his brother Christian's was in Bradford County. Henry is remembered for his great strength. He continually won at contests of strength held at local outings. He gave his time to the improvement of his farm, which was one of the best in the neighborhood. He and his wife were two of the original members of the Methodist Society formed in Overton. The Bradford Argus newspaper dated Sep. 21, 1871, Towanda, PA obituary listed his death as follows; \"HAVERLY In Forks Twp., Sullivan Co., on the 6th day of September, 1871, Henry Haverly, age 67 yrs., 9 mo., & 2 days.

The town was laid out in the fall of 1853 by Virden, a surveyor, who neglected to file the plat. The first name given the town was Prairie Rapids or Prairie Rapids Crossing. In 1850, seven settlers drew up a partition requesting a post office and naming Charles Mullan as postmaster. Mr. Mullan went to Cedar Falls to seek an endorsement from the postmaster there and while there named the town Waterloo. (Various other reasons are given for naming the town Waterloo.) In the spring of 1854 Charles Mullan, with the following landowners laid out the town that became the city of Waterloo: Lewis Hallock, George Hanna, J.H. Brooks, J.R. Pratt, B.M. Cooley and James Virden. The platt was recorded on June 24, 1854.\n\nAmerica Mullan, wife of Charles Mullan, was William Virdens sister. Mary, wife of George Hanna and Rebecca, wife of George Virden were sisters of John and Samuel Melrose.\n\nhttp://iagenweb.org/blackhawk/history_four.htm\n\nCharles Mullan, the enterprising third settler, was born in 1811 in Lycoming county, Pennsylvania, moving to Morgan County, Illinois before coming to join his brothers-in-law, William and James Virden at Prairie Rapids, in June, 1846. Mullan served as the first postmaster, county surveyor, realtor and businessman extraordinaire. He died in 1874\n\nhttp://iagenweb.org/blackhawk/historicalscraps.htm\n\nSource: Iowa State Reporter, Waterloo, June 7, 1883\n\nHISTORICAL SCRAPS\n\nTHE FIRST SETTLERS IN WATERLOO were CHARLES MULLAN and family, who came from Illinois, and reached this point on the 24th of June, 1846. Mr. Mullan entered the farm now owned by the estate, and erected a log house near the present family residence that year. He was the first postmaster in Waterloo, one of the first justices, and the first county surveyor in Blackhawk county. He was identified with nearly all the early enterprises of the town, and died in August, 1874, age 63 years.\n\nTHE FIRST POST OFFICE in the county was at Cedar Falls, established in the year 1848. Up to 1850 Waterloo had been known as \"Prairie Rapids\" and \"Prairie Rapids Crossing.\" In that year a petition was circulated asking the establishment of the post office here, and naming CHARLES MULLAN as postmaster. There were seven names to the petition, and we suppose it included abut all the inhabitants of a petitioning age. The question of a name had been talked over by the settlers without any agreement, and when MR. MULLAN took his petition to Cedar Falls to have it endorsed by the postmaster there, he looked through the list of post offices to find a name for the office here. He found Waterloo, was pleased with it, and finding no other office of that name in the state, christened the town then and there, and in due time the papers came on for a post office at Waterloo, Blackhawk county, Iowa. Mr. Mullan had the office at the family residence, then a log house near the present location, and the first year was only troubled with mail once in two weeks. After that the service was increased to weekly.\n\nTHE FIRST CHILD BORN IN WATERLOO was WILLIAM MULLAN, son of Mr. and Mrs. CHARLES MULLAN, which event occurred on the 2d day of May, 1849.\n\nIn 1854 HENRY SHERMAN erected a log building on the site of the present Central House, and opened a hotel, adding to the structure from time to time as his business increased. He was a genial, pleasant fellow and kept a fair house, and all the old settlers have plenty of stories to tell about SHERMAN and his hotel.\n\nSource: From: \"Mary\" Mys\n\nTo: Lyle Rockwell\n\nSent: Friday, August 07, 2009\n\nCharles Mullan, who married America Virden in 1842 in IL. If you look at the Black Hawk County, USGENWEB, you will find that Charles Mullan was one of the original settlers of Black Hawk County, IA, going to that county in 1846, I believe. He was a teacher in IL, etc. He is credited with platting Waterloo, Black Hawk County, IA. A bronze plaque was put on the original log cabin, and later the plaque was placed on the stick-built home built later, at 122 Falls Ave. The house on Falls Ave. remained in the Charles Mullan family through 1940.\n\nI found two Letters written to Charles Mullan in 1842 when he was living in IL, one from his brother William, and one from father, Charles. In those letters apparently Charles wrote home requesting for assistance in getting surveying instruments, etc. The father procured them and told his son that he would send them. It is with these surveying instruments that he surveyed and laid out the plat map of Waterloo, Black Hawk County, IA.\n\nFirst Surveying Instruments.\n\nThe letter from Charles Mullan, sr., to his son, dated Dec. 19, 1842, tells about buying a surveying outfit and sending it, with other things, by a friend from Pennsylvania to Illinois. Again the hard times loom us an annoying factor, and yet the Mullans were probably as well to do as other families. These surveying instruments four years later were brought by young Mullan to Waterloo and were used in doing some of the first surveying ever done in Black Hawk county, and for the platting of the town site. These instruments, after the father's death were kept in the home of a son, the late Judge Charles W. Mullan. The letter from father to son, is as follows:\n\n(first letter from father)\n\nElkland, Penn., Dec. 19, A.D. 1842.\n\nRespected Son: I take this opportunity to send you a few lines, to inform you that we are all well and were much pleased to hear from you, and still more so to hear that you were well.\n\nJonas Hardy arrived here in safety, and gave me the letter you sent informing me what things you wished me to send to you by him. Tho I cannot possibly send all that you sent for, at present, on account of money being so scarce and hard to get. The lumbering people on Loyalsock have disappointed me on account of lumber having no sale so that they are not able to make sale for their lumber at any price. Therefore I send by Jonas Hardy all the things that I have for you which are your large bible and five small books, and your compass, mathematical instruments, chain and socket, which is all I could possibly get to send to you present by him. I think perhaps that Francis or Gideon Boyles (or some others from these parts) will be coming to that part of the country within a year, and probably next spring, so that I can send you a rifle and the other things by them, if I can purchase them by that time. I do not think it worth while to send many particulars, as I expect Nancy will be able to give you a history of the times more satisfactory than I can in the limits of a letter, if she arrives there in safety. The ground has been covered with snow for four weeks past and is now good sleighing, tho the summer has been very dry, so that we have not cut more than half the hay this season that we commonly do others. And it has been very unhealthy during the summer past, several have died in this part, but nothing in comparison to the numbers that died in Towanda Creek and Troy.\n\nAnthony has got a shop and set up his trade at Monroeton. He has more work than he can do so that he has to hire two or three to work with him. And the rest of your brothers and sisters are all well at present. So no more From your Father,\n\nCHARLES MULLAN, SEN.\n\n(second letter from brother William Mullen)\n\nWilliam's letter reads as follows: Elkland, Penn. April 2, 1842.\n\nDear Brother: I received your letter dated February 1st..25th inst., which gave me the satisfaction to hear from you, but it would be much more satisfactory to see you. I and the rest of our folks enjoy good health at present. I taught school three months in our schoolhouse last winter. I had the largest school that we ever had: on the whole I had nearly 50. I had $15 per month.\n\nSince my school was out I have been making sugar the most of the time, the sugar making is now about finished. There has been a very good season for making sugar.\n\nLast fall there were a great many beech nuts. This winter has been remarkable easy, which made it well for those that got hogs to fat on nuts. There has been scarcely snow enough for sleighing.\n\nFather has sent to the city and get you a Philadelphia patent compass, instrument and chain all complete. He sent by Gordon Mason for the compass. He went out a few days ago and brought them in, but he did not see Mason. Therefore, he does not know the exact price. But I would think that the whole would amount to about $50.\n\nI expect that you are very impatient to know about my coming out this spring or summer. I would have written to you sooner but I had not concluded when I should come: money is so scarce and specially hard to get, and it would be of no use to travel to the west with these bank bills; there is such a row about the banks that it is not safe for a person to keep much of them by, for the banks are all nearly alike.\n\nAnthony left McSmith last winter and I lent him $ 40 to buy his time, before I received your letter. He then came home and went to school. So that I think that I cannot make up money and arrange business to come much before fall.\n\nIf you come out to the state of Ohio, this spring with a drove of cattle, certainly you can take time to come home and see the folks. You have been gone now nearly five years. Little did I think when you left that such a length of time should elapse before we should see you again, but the memory still is fresh. And we would be happy at your arrival. I should be glad if you would arrange your business to come without fail; we have looked for your arrival several times but all in vain.\n\nI want you to write to me as soon as you get this and let me know what I ought to bring, &c. &c. Whether I had best to bring a surveyor's compass or not. I have an opportunity of getting one cheap, and I would get it if you think best. I think it is a good one. I have done some surveying with it, and have considerable more to do about home. But still it would be of no use to buy it unless it would be of service for me in the west. I want you to tell me about the price of store goods and matters and things in general and what will be the most necessary things for me to bring.\n\nI want you also to give me a small history how you prosper in the world, what your occupation has been, etc.\n\nOne thing I had almost forgotten to tell you, that is, you are missed in the hound killing speculation. There were a great many loafers came up from below to Browns for Browns to assist them. In running the deer from the Elkland some of the people below have had some of their hounds killed before, and Browns got them to join them to chase the deer all from the Elklands. But we were all ready for them-the good work prospered first rate, there were three and four killed in a day. They were all slaughtered without mercy and but few deer killed. They had to give it up for a bad job. My hands are so stiff sugarmaking that I can hardly write, therefore you must excuse for it was done in a hurry. These few lines from your affectionate Brother. WM. MULLAN\n\nYou must write to me as soon as you receive this without fail, and make your calculations to come by the time I have mentioned. No more at present. I send my best respects to Wm. and John Hardy and would be glad to hear from them.\n\nCharles married America VIRDEN, daughter of William VIRDEN Sr. and Martha WILLIAMSON , on 24 Oct 1842 in Albion, Edwards County, IL.

AMERICA MULLAN\n\nSource: Waterloo Daily Courier: Friday Evening, November 21, 1902: Whole No. 8735, FRONT PAGE\n\nIN FULLNESS OF THE YEARS\n\nMrs. America Mullan Passes Away at Pomeroy, Aged 85. Pioneer of Waterloo, Settling Here in Summer of 1846. Body to be Brought Back Tomorrow for Interment.\n\nMrs. America Mullan, mother of Hon. C. W. Mullan, attorney general of Iowa, who, with her husband was the first settler in the present limits of the City of Waterloo, passed away at 3:50 yesterday afternoon, after a short illness of pneumonia, at the home of a son, Marion Mullan, at Pomeroy. She was 85 years old the 24th of last October.\n\nThree weeks ago Mrs. Mullan left for a visit to her sons, three of whom, besides C . W., reside in this state. She first went to Fort Dodge to visit J.W., then to Sioux City to visit H.C. While making the journey from there to Pomeroy last Monday deceased was taken ill on the train with a severe pain in her side. She was so ill when she reached Pomeroy that she had to be carried to her sons residence. She gradually grew worse, the pneumonia, which had set in, affecting her heart, and she passed away at the hour indicated.\n\nThe body will arrive here tomorrow evening. The attorney general will reach here tomorrow morning and until that time no definite arrangements will be made for the funeral.\n\nMrs. Mullan was the mother of seven children, six of whom survive. One died in infancy. The survivors are Hon. C. W. Mullan of Waterloo, J. W. of Fort Dodge, an Illinois Central passenger engineer; H. C. of Sioux City, a passenger conductor on the Illinois Central; W. H. of Aberdeen, S.D., a postal clerk; Marion of Pomeroy, a jeweler, and Mrs. Lizzie Davison, who has made her home with her mother in the house at the top of the hill on the Cedar Falls road, just northwest of the city, where the family pitched their tent when they arrived in this section June 24, 1846, more than half a century ago. Besides the relatives mentioned in the foregoing, decedent leaves three brothers and two sisters. The brothers are Oscar Virden, living in Waterloo township, James Virden, living in the western part of the state, and Frank Virden, living somewhere in the west. The sisters are Mrs. Martha Bunting of Rock Valley, Ia., and Mrs. Nelson Fancher of Chicago.\n\nThere is clustered about such a life as Mrs. Mullan lived such a train of important circumstances that only the heads of chapters, as it were, can be touched in an article like this. Her life, spent as it was, from the tender years of childhood, in pioneering, was rich in the wealth of circumstances that compose the unfolding years.\n\nAMERICA VIRDEN was the daughter of a hardy family whose name has clinging to it only honor, sturdiness of character and indomitable energy. Her father was William Virden, a farmer who was for quite a time a resident of Kentucky. Her mother was Martha Williamson, a woman of strong character embodying to a wonderful degree the graces that ennoble [sic] womanhood. America was the eldest daughter and the second child of these two. She was born Oct. 24, 1817, in Tompkinville [sic], Ky., and when eight years of age her parents, with their large family, moved to Wayne Co., Ill. That was in 1825, before the first locomotive on the American continent was conceived, and the only means of travel w ere by crude craft on the water and \"prairie schooners\" on the land. The trip from Kentucky at that time to the frontier in Illinois was so impressive in its nature that decedent never forgot it, though she was but a child when it was undertaken. After remaining a few years in Illinois enough people migrated to Wayne county to make possible the opening of a school. This was the first school that Mrs. Mullan ever attended. The house was built of logs, the seats were slabs without backs and the other furniture and appurtenances were within keeping the pioneer life. The school was three miles away to and from which Mrs. Mullan walked each day regardless of weather. Present day students in the public schools will be surprised to learn that the \"school master\" rang his bell at 8 oclock in the morning, which was the hour for everybody to be in his place and at his books, and there was no intermission until noon. at 2 in the afternoon school took up again and lasted until 6 in the evening. The school grew in numbers as the country settled up and it was not long until the Methodist church, which closely follows the establishing of school houses, opened services there. A society was formed and meetings were held regularly. Mrs. Mullan, at the age of 4, in 1831, joined this Methodist church, and she was a consistent and faithful member of that denomination up to the time of her death, a period of 71 long years.\n\nOn March 24, 1842, decedent was married in Wayne county to Charles Mullan. The husband, in the early days of their married life, taught school, while the wife became expert in the handiwork necessary in those days to the proper conduct of a household of ones own. She carded the wool, spun it into thread and wove it into cloth for the garments they wore. The lady used to tell with animation how the pride and pleasure of those days were among her most cherished memories. There used to be a keen rivalry among the women of the neighborhood as to who could spin the best, make the best web of cloth or weave into it the most dainty and fanciful designs.\n\nThere came a time when Mr. and Mrs. Mullan received news of the opening of that part of Black Hawk county in which Waterloo now lies for settlement. Such cheering reports came to them of its fertility and healthful climate that they determined to seek a new home for themselves and children and accordingly in May, 1846, the family gathered all their worldly possessions in a covered wagon, bid adieu, as they supposed to parents and near and dear ones for the last time, and set out for the land of promise.\n\nThe journey required four weeks. The distance was 500 miles. They arrived in Black Hawk county, June 24, 1846, pitching a tent on the hill where the home of deceased now stands and where she lived constantly all the years since then. This hill, in the picturesque beauty of the wilderness, was so pretty and attractive that they determined to make the place their home. There were but two other families then living in the county, the nearest three mile distant. Therese were James Virden, brother of Mrs. Mullan, who had preceded her a year, and Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Hanna. The Indians had not been removed to the recently opened reservation and, regretting they had ceded the land to the government, were smitten and half inclined to be hostile. The young men of the tribe urged open hostilities and counseled the killing of the few white \"intruders,\" but the older men kept them in check, else who knows, but the early pages of the history of Black Hawk county might be red with blood.\"\n\nThe first winter was one of exceptional severity to the hardy pioneers. The nearest trading post and post office was hat Marion, Linn county, 60 miles distant. Mr. Mullan, in the early fall, made a trip to that point for breadstuffs and provisions for the winter, and almost his last cent of money was used in making the necessary purchases. But the cold began early and hung on late in the spring. In the dead of winter the flour got low, and other articles of food were becoming depleted. The neighbors were I the same condition and the only escape from starving was for Mr. Mullan again to visit Marion and buy provisions. The making of the trip through the deep snow through a trackless territory had its horrors, but these paled into significance compared to the dangers besetting the little family while the husband and father was absent. There were two small children then, Charles, jr., and Lizzie. For three weeks the mother and these were alone in the little cabin with Indians besetting them night after night. When darkness came the mother would wrap her little ones in blankets and with a prayer for their safety would place them in their beds, while she remained awake, watchful and silent, with the loaded rifle in easy reach. The self-imposed vigil, prompted by mother love was kept until the lady was almost exhausted. It is easy to imagine that no home-coming could have been fraught with greater joy and thanksgiving than the one that marked the return of Mr. Mullan, not only in the protection that he himself afforded, but in the replenishing of the larder, which had dwindled to hulled corn and milk and these almost gone.\n\nTwo days after the family came, or in 1848, a young Methodist minister, Rev. Collins, visited this part of Iowa was the first to hold religious services in the county. His chapel was the Mullan home. He came on horseback from Linn county and though having the general location of the Mullan home in his mind as being near the junction of the Black Hawk with the Cedar, he wandered about for hours one dark night and only reached his destination after being almost famished with hunger and exhausted with fatigue. In 1849 a church society was organized for the Methodists by a Rev. Mr. Johnson, who was working in the interest of the Home Missionary society. This was the first nucleus and beginning of the present First M. E. Church. It was organized with five members, composed of Mr. and Mrs. Hanna, Mr. and Mrs. William Virden and Mrs. Mullan. So Mrs. Mullans membership in this church has dated from 1849, or 53 years a member of the same church society.\n\nIn 1852 the tide of immigration began to move to this part of Iowa and the county was settled rapidly. Among the others who came to the new goodly land were Mrs. Mullans father and mother and brothers and sisters, in 1852, to whom she had said goodbye six years before, expecting it would be the last time she would ever see them again. This meeting was fraught with an outpouring of affection on the part of all concerned that made all rejoice. The father died and was buried here a few years later.\n\nAbout 1852 the first mail route was established through the county, and Mr. Mullan, senior, was appointed postmaster. The office was in his home. The first ripe made by the carrier did not yield largely in the volume of mail matter. One lone letter composed the contents of the mail bag. Settlers were so few that the volume of business of the post office was not large either. The postal case was an old tin pan that had outlived its usefulness for other purposes, and this was placed near the door where the patrons of the office could \"go through\" the mail and take out what was addressed to them.\n\n.... Her life was simple. She loved the natural. To her the studied forms of society did not appeal. She felt within herself and family a self-sustaining strength for mind and heart. In her all of the graces of Christian faith were sweetly blended. Her life was a daily example of Christianity. In as simplest, truest, and noblest sense. She was endowed with a rare mind. Even in the latter days of her life after she had passed more than four score years her mind was quick, forceful. Altogether she seemed to reach out and comprehend the many forces of progress about her. She was attached to the home of her earlier days and loved to be on that favored spot where so many years ago she came in the prime of womanhood and established her life home. She was genuine. She was real. In all her ways she evinced a gentleness that is only possible with strong characters. She was kind and loving. She loved to do for others.

William H. and first wife Rebecca came to Waterloo prior to Charles and America Virden Mullan, although not by much, along with James Virden, another brother, who was single when he arrived in Waterloo. His age in the 1850 U.S. Census, District No. 11, Black Hawk County, IA, taken on Sept. 23, 1850, is listed as 29, born in KY. His correct birth year should be about 1816. William Virden and Martha Williamson were married 1815 in Lexington, KY; Lexington, KY in Fayette County]\n\nAmerica Virden Mullan allowed two of her sons to marry children of her siblings,\n\nwhich would have made them first cousins. One being Laura Virden, daughter of America's brother, James Virden, who married William Harrison Mullan (first white person born in Waterloo Township, Black Hawk County, IA); and the second being Henry C. MULLAN, who married Mary E. BUNTING, daughter of America Virden Mullan's sister, Martha Virden Bunting, born in Wayne County, IL;. Both William Harrison Mullan and Henry C.

FAWCETT\n\nMr. Fawcett was joined in hymeneal bonds with Arvilla Mullen, a daughter of John and Selena (Woodhead) Mullen, and a descendant of an old and well-established family in Sullivan County. Anthony Mullen, the earliest ancestor of whom there is any record, lived in New York City and was a drummer in the Revolutionary War. He was a sea captain and was finally lost at sea, leaving a very large property in New York City. His son, Charles Mullen, at an early day moved to Sullivan County, Pa., where he was given a tract of fifty acres by Dr. Joseph Priestley as an inducement for him to locate there. He cleared the land and built a log house, the work being greatly facilitated by the use of tools which he was enabled to make, as his trade was that of a blacksmith. He subsequently took up more land, but as he was at a distance of thirty miles from the nearest mill, he finally located on our subject's farm, where he died at the age of sixty-five years. He married Elizabeth Hoagland, and they reared the following children: Hannah; Charles; Joseph; Martha; William; John; and Anthony.\n\nJohn Mullen, the father of Mrs. Fawcett, was educated in the district schools and in the college of Jersey Shore, in which he took a complete course under Prof. Nehemiah Ross, graduating at the age of twenty-two years. He came into possession of the homestead property, and has since followed farming. He married Selena Woodhead, and the following children were born to them: Almeda, Cecelia, Lettie, Rose, Frank, Lillie, Janie, Arvilla, Melville, Clara, Charles, Luella, and Ada.\n\nMr. Mullen was born in Elkland township, Sullivan County, March 1, 1821, and is now an honored member of that community.\n\nJohn married Selena WOODHEAD, daughter of Joseph WOODHEAD and Hannah SECKER , in 1844.
