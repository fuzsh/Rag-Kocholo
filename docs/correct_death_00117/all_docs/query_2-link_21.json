        "text": "The Polk family is of Scots-Irish descent and first settled in the United States in the 1720s in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Like many Scots-Irish located in Philadelphia at the time, the Polk family moved south to what would become Mecklenburg County via the Great Wagon Road that ran from Philadelphia to North Carolina.\n\nViolet and Lucy would have performed most of the domestic work on the farm, which would have included meeting Polk’s needs and those of the enslaved. Their work included maintaining the kitchen garden, cooking, laundry, preserving food, looking after the Polk children, and cleaning. They would have had a very active role in James Polk’s life."
