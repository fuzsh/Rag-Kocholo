        "text": "James K. Polk kept each of his campaign promises, including to serve only one term as U.S. president. He departed the White House on March 4, 1849. A mere 103 days later he died of cholera. In doing so Polk set the record for the shortest post-presidency of any retired chief executive. He and his wife, former First Lady Sarah Childress Polk, are interred on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. The Polk gravesite is in a row with statues of the two other commanders-in-chief from Tennessee, Andrew Johnson and Andrew Jackson, one of Polk’s mentors.\n\nThe state capitol grounds are the third place the former president has been interred. Cholera victims were buried quickly to prevent the disease’s spread, so the day after his death James Polk was buried at the Nashville City Cemetery. When his permanent tomb was completed the following year at his Nashville residence, Polk Place, he was reinterred there. He remained on the grounds of Polk Place for 43 years, the final two of which were spent alongside his wife, Sarah, who died in 1891. In 1893, owing to a legal dispute, the General Assembly voted to relocate President and Mrs. Polk and their Grecian tomb to the capitol grounds, where they currently rest. In 2018, the same body took up a measure to move the Polks again, this time to the President James K. Polk Home and Museum located 47 miles south in the city of Columbia. It failed by one vote.\n\nThe limestone Polk tomb was designed by William Strickland, a leader of the nineteenth century Greek-Revival architectural movement. His other designs include George Washington’s marble sarcophagus, the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia, and the Tennessee State Capitol — the grounds of which now host the Polk gravesite. Strickland died in 1854 — 39 years before the president’s gravesite was moved from Polk Place to the statehouse, and five years before the capitol itself was completed. Though he was based out of Philadelphia, Strickland is entombed in Nashville, within the walls of his final project.\n\nMy first visit to James and Sarah Polk’s tomb came on July 22, 2006. The second excursion came the very next day — my father and I returned because we had time to kill before our flight home. In this photo I am wearing a t-shirt my father bought for me the previous day at Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage, his home and plantation. I returned to the Tennessee State Capitol and the Hermitage in June 2013.\n\nSources Consulted and Further Reading\n\nCostello, Matthew R.
