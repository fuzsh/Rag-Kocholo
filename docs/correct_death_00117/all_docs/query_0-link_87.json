        "text": "Good Morning (or afternoon, or evening, or whatever time of the day you happen to be reading this in)!\n\nWelcome to Day 20, where we follow the footsteps of “The Freedom Trail”, a 2.5 Mile walking tour where we will explore many notable landmarks that helped to shape American History, right here in the heart of Boston!\n\nSo, grab your walking shoes or tennis shoes, and let’s…\n\nActually, since your not physically with me right now, maybe forget that last part…\n\nLet’s get right down to it!\n\nThe Freedom Trail\n\nAfter taking the shuttle from our hotel to the airport, we took the subway south into downtown Boston… The Freedom Trail would start in Boston Common, near where we would resurface.\n\nThere are dozens of Dunkin’ Donuts in Boston! I’m not kidding, it’s like Starbucks and New York City’s intimate connection. The reason for this is likely because Dunkin’ Donuts was originally started in nearby Quincy, just to the south.\n\nBoston Common… the oldest public park in the United States…\n\nThe Common was filled with many tourists and citizens going about their daily buisness. Boston Common, originally used for grazing ground for livestock, had serves as a place for celebrations, festivals, concerts, and tours (and back in colonial days, public hangings).\n\nAnd this… is The Freedom Trail.\n\nThis red-brick line weaves throughout the city and past the most iconic historical locations throughout, and is a nice way to pursue History, as well as get your daily exercise. So, let’s start following it!\n\nThat large golden dome is the roof of the Massachusetts State House, home to the state government of Massachusetts!\n\nMost of the state government buildings in each state are called “State Capitol Buildings”, though some (especially in the east), are called “State Houses”. Why that is, I haven’t the foggiest.\n\nUp we went to get a closer look.\n\nDesigned by Charles Bulfinch, and completed in 1798, The State House is located on “Beacon Hill”, and was also gilded with a gold-leaf dome in 1874. Unfortunetly, we couldn’t go inside.\n\nIn front of each of the landmarks on The Freedom Trail, this seal is embedded into the sidewalk to commemorate it’s significance. It’s pretty easy to follow the trail, and very rarely does it become confusing in trying to find the right way.\n\nA statue of Daniel Webster, one of the most influential senators in U.S. History, who also served as Secretary of State under three different Presidents, and who helped to draft the Compromise of 1850, The Webster-Ashburton Treaty, and sucessful arguements in court cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland, and Gibbons v. Ogden. Along with Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, he was a member of the “Great Triumviate”, three powerful U.S. Congressman that helped to set the stage for the Two-Party System in the pre-Civil War era.\n\nThe Park Street Church, our third stop, served as a primary stage for many fiery speeches and orators in the 1800’s. Formerly the tallest building in Boston thanks to it’s white steeple, the building has seen many events within it’s walls and on it’s steps, from abolitionist addresses, to the first recital of “My Country “Tis of Thee”.\n\nPerhaps the most famous cemetery in Boston, The “Granary Burial Ground” is the final resting place of some of our most esteemed patriots and Founding-Fathers. It’s also the third oldest cemetery in Boston.\n\nThese two memorials we could spot right off the bat.\n\nThe first memorialized the victims of the Boston Massacre, the riot in the streets of Boston that brewed much opposition towards British actions in the city. Crispus Attucks, one of the five Bostonians killed, was an African-American, and was the first of his kind to have died for the patriot cause.\n\nAnd the second on the right is the grave of Samuel Adams, one of the Sons of Liberty!\n\nKnown especially for the beer brand named after him, Adams was a distant cousin of John Adams, and was one of the most vehement opponents to British rule in the colonies.\n\nA lot of these old tombstones are really crooked… it makes you wonder if someone takes care of them regularly.\n\nOne of the plaques set into the brick wall marked the tomb of Robert Treat Paine, one of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. I’ve lost count of how many signers we’ve seen on this trip…\n\nThis tall monument is none other than the final resting place of John Hancock, President of the 2nd Continental Congress, and another of the Sons of Liberty. Hancock also served as the first and third Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nSo that was John Hancock…\n\nAnd this is John Hancock’s “John Hancock”. Heh…\n\nHis large signature on the Declaration of Independence was put, as John Hancock put it, “Large enough so Fat King George in London could read it without his looking glasses.”\n\nThe most easily visible marker in the Cemetery is marked: Franklin. This is where the parents of Benjamin Franklin, Josiah and Abiah Franklin are buried.\n\nFranklin, who originally came from Boston, ran away from home in his teen years, and would arrive in Philadelphia to begin his new life, and a decades-long career.\n\nMuch like Ben Franklin’s grave in Philadelphia, his parents are also payed tribute with pennies.\n\nNow this is an intersting grave… if you look closely, the inscription reads “Mary Goose.”\n\nIt is believed by some that this is the grave of the actual “Mother Goose”, whose children’s tales are known far and wide. However, it is debatable, and there is no concrete proof that proves that she was. Still, it’s pretty nice to point out.\n\nAlso, I find it a bit strange that these skulls have to be on the top of many of the tombstones, Mother Goose’s especially. Apparently puritan values back then were very different compared to today’s standards.\n\nThe last famous gravesite in this particular cemetery belonged to the patriot famous for his “Midnight Ride”…\n\nPaul Revere.\n\nA silversmith, Revere was another member of the Sons of Liberty, and famously helped to deliver the warning of the oncoming hordes of British soldiers to nearby towns in the Boston area. His tale endeared itself as an “American Legend”, and is commonly associated with patriotism in the American Revolution.\n\nRevere lived to be 84, a very venerable age for an era where the life-expectancy was much lower than it is today.\n\nMoving on from the Burial Ground, we next arrived at Kings Chapel, built in 1686 at the behest of King James II, and which would become the first Unitarian Church in the country. A special pew located inside was reserved for royal governors to sit in, and even seated George Washington during his visit to Boston in 1789.\n\nKings Chapel Burying Ground, smaller than the Granary Burial Ground, was a quick stop, but nonetheless significant as Boston’s very first cemetery.\n\nThe grave of John Winthrop, the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was one of the founders of the colony and it’s organization of government.\n\nThe grave of William Dawes Jr., Paul Revere’s companion during the Midnight Ride. Dawes took a different route than Revere to alert the surrounding towns of British advances, and thus is less remembered for his deed than Paul Revere was.\n\nThe very large Old City Hall, which was formerly the site of the very first public school in America: Bostin Latin School. Notable alumni included Ben Franklin, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nA neat statue of Benjamin Franklin, marking his original heritage here in the North.\n\nThe Old Corner Bookstore was once the home of Anne Hutchinson, a founder of the Rhode Island Colony. Later it had become one of the nation’s prominant literary centers, and was home to the leading publishers of the 1800’s back in it’s day.\n\nNow it serves as a Chipotle Restaurant.\n\n…Why?\n\nThe Old South Meeting House, the second oldest church in Boston, was a gathering place for those who wanted to express their disatisfaction and anger against the British Crown, the infringements of their rights, and the unfair taxation of their economy.\n\nBritish soldiers sacked the place during the occupation of Boston, desecrated much of it’s interior, and converted it into a stable.\n\nThe back of the Old Massachusetts State House, where the heads of the royal government would base their power from. People regularly displayed their distaste with the king around the building, one of which would instigate the Boston Massacre.\n\nA couple of British Redcoats wandering through the streets of Boston… i’m not sure they got the memo that the war ended about 236 years ago.\n\nThe backside of the building features the balcony where the first reading of the Declaration of Independence in Boston took place. I imagine that didn’t settle too well with the British.\n\nIn front of the building was this memorial of old cobblestone that marked the site of the Boston Massacre, an event that would shake people’s faith in the British Empire to the core…\n\nLooking towards the Old State House, at the square that it took place at. One can see The Freedom Trail going down the street where we are now. Let’s continue to follow it.\n\nFaneuil Hall, alas, is completely covered in construction and scaffolding, likely for restoration work. So, I’ll try to find a decent stock picture of what it looks like in it’s prime.\n\nI think that does it nicely.\n\nFaneuil Hall has been a meeting-hall and market place since 1743, and has also served as a major hub for orations and protests both in the modern day, and colonial days during British Occupation. The passionate speeches and rallies that took place here have given Faneuil Hall the nickname: “The Cradle of Liberty”.\n\nThe oldest building in all of Boston is none other than the Paul Revere House, where the famous patriot and silversmith lived. The house was built in 1680, and is still structurally sound. Revere lived here with both his first and second wife, and many of their children (Revere had eighteen children between the two marriages… that is almost a record I think.\n\nSt. Stephen’s Catholic Church, though not a part of the official Freedom Trail, is still notable, because it was where Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, mother of President John F. Kennedy was baptized. She has several areas in Boston named after her as well.\n\nPaul Revere Mall leads directly to the Old North Church in the distance. Much of the mall is fenced off with reconstruction, but we were able to pass through unhindered.\n\nAnd who’s statue should be in the mall, but Paul Revere himself?\n\nAh, the Old North Church… it was from this very steeple that the two lanterns were lit in the window, indicating to Paul Revere on his midnight ride that the British were coming by sea… at one point, it was one of the tallest structures in the entire colony, so it could easily be seen from a great distance.\n\nHence this sign.\n\nA neat street of Boston… it makes you wonder how old some of these buildings are… and what their living prices are.\n\nCopp’s Hill Burying Ground was the largest cemetery in Colonial Boston, though not as many notables are buried here.\n\nStill, we found the gravesite of Robert Newman, the individual who lit the lanterns in the steeple for Paul Revere. From the looks of the symbol on the marker, it seems he was a member of the Masons.\n\nThe Freedom Trail led us across the Charlestown Bridge, and into the Charlestown district of Boston…\n\nAn entire fleet of boats… and look! The Bunker Hill Monument stands in the distance!\n\nThough we were unable to make it to the Monument before it closed, there was still one major stop of the Freedom Trail that could NOT be missed…\n\n“Old Ironsides” herself…\n\nU.S.S. Constitution\n\nSo! For the more learned of you in military history, you might be wondering why this American Warship, originally completed in 1797, is still surviving to this very day?\n\nAnd my answer to you is, I’m in the same boat as you. Pun intended.\n\nThis is not a replica of the famous battleship. Nope, it’s the original U.S.S. Constitution, and it’s the oldest Naval Warship still afloat in the world! It serves as one of the symbols of the U.S. Navy, and a terrific look into the early history of the country’s naval expertise…\n\nThe U.S.S. Constitution took thousands of dollars (likely millions in today’s money) to build, and it took hundreds of trees from most of the 13 original states to complete.\n\nThe main deck of the U.S.S. Constitution. The ship is still an actual sailing ship thanks to tug power, and has the capability of going on tour every once in a while.\n\nTwo of the main masts of the ship. All of these knots and rigging of the ropes are beyond my comprehension…\n\nCaptaining a ship was no easy feat, it was very difficult to navigate these waters…\n\nNow granted, the main reason for that was because the wheel was stuck in place, so I couldn’t really go anywhere… still, A for effort.\n\nThe cannons are actually 1927 replicas, but are still very resemblant of the actual cannons used during the ship’s prime.\n\nNowhere to go but down!\n\nYet more cannons line the deck… there are twenty-four on each side of this deck… it makes you wonder how strong a ship must be to carry all that weight.\n\nA small lounge that perhaps serves as a galley for the crew members.\n\nWoah! This ship has had a lot of commanding officers! Most of them serve two years at a time, and there have been 75 different commanders since 1797!\n\nOne of the navy officers was eager to demonstrate to us some of the basics of ship building and maintenance. As a still-operating Navy vessel, it is still manned by Navy operatives, who on normal days dress in period clothing such as this and serve as docents of the ship. It’s a neat touch.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the ship was undefeated in all of the skirmishes that it participated in, and when the cannonballs of an enemy British ship seemed to simply bounce off the Constitution’s hull, a crewmember cried out: “Huzzah! Her sides are made of Iron!” And thus, the monkier “Old Ironsides was born.”\n\nHopefully, given proper restoration and support, the ship can continue to become a symbol of America’s heritage and naval history.\n\nExausted, we returned to the hotel with aching feet, and heads full of knowledge…\n\nIt was a busy day no doubt, and the next day would be no less of an occurance either! I won’t get into details just yet, but lets just say we explored many of the outer-towns of the Boston-Metropolitan area, with many suprises to come!\n\nAnd so, as of the time this is posted, we return back home to Texas the day after tomorrow! I’m counting down the days, yet I’m sad that the adventure is almost over… it’s been so much fun sharing our experiences with you, and we can’t wait to share the last adventures that we have here!\n\nAnd so, I’ll see you at the Day 21 Post, which will come soon! Take care!"
