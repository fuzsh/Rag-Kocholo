Additional research and sources were provided by Brenda Jackson.\n\nAccording to his obituary, James Knox Polk was born into slavery January 21, 1845 on the Bosque Bonita farm, owned by Abraham Buford in Woodford County, KY. His mother Margie Johnson chose to name him for the newly-elected President of the United States.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War Abraham Buford joined the Confederacy, taking James Polk with him to serve as a hostler (handler of horses). He remained with Buford throughout the war.\n\nPolk returned to Woodford County and married Mary Bohannon in 1868. They were parents of Reuben Buford, Ellen, James Henry, Lee Christy, John Knox and Dolly Polk.\n\nJames Polk studied to become an ordained minister in 1871. He founded the Pilgrim Baptist Church at Midway, KY on the second Sunday in January, 1872. He also became a pastor at the African Baptist Church of Christ in Mortonsville, KY around 1873. That church's name was changed to Polk Memorial to honor the minister who served the congregation for 45 years.\n\nPolk was a member and served as moderator twice of the Kentucky General Association of Baptists and also served as a delegate to the Colored People's Convention of 1898 at Lexington, KY during the Separate Coach Protest.\n\nPolk died January 27, 1918 and was buried in Woodford County. Comments in his obituary: \"Reverend James K. Polk was faithful and devoted to his ministry, a good citizen, a man of integrity and force of character, of kindliness, humility and courtesy.\"\n\nSources:\n\nDeath Certificate #5945, Woodford County, KY.\n\nObituaries - Lexington Leader, January 29, 1918, p. 5, col. 3; Woodford Sun, January 31, 1918 (includes photograph).\n\nPolk Memorial Baptist - Woodford Sun, October 30, 2003, p.
