James Johnston committed suicide on Wednesday morning, 2nd inst, by cutting his throat with a razor. He lived in Kilmonagh, on emile from Collooney. He was about 35 years old, only recently married, and lived happily with his wife and sister. He was a most respectable and very popular young man. He was sober, very industrious, and no reason can be got for his terrible ending. He was not in financial difficulties, nor had he any domestic quarrels. Temporary insanity was the verdict. Dr. Roe was the coroner, and Dr. Cummings the medical witness. There is nothing around Collooney but regret for him, and sympathy for his surviving relations.\"\n\nJames married Maria (Mary) Gallagher.\n\nThe child from this marriage was:\n\n41 F i.

Catherina \"Kitty\" Flynn was born on 14 Feb 1876, died on 21 Dec 1938 in Manhattan, New York, New York at age 62, and was buried in Calvary Cemetery, New York.\n\nGeneral Notes: This is likely Kitty Flynn, born in 1876 but in the census records of New York, her age is stated as 38 in 1920 and 42 in 1930. Birth year stated as 1888 on her death record, obviously incorrect. Her death record inidcates she was a Cafe Manager.\n\n46 F v.

Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" Flynn was born in 1895.\n\nGeneral Notes: Maybe the writer of the letter, \"E. Flynne,\" was Elizabeth Flynn, the sister of Ellen/Ellie, and daughter of James and Margaret Johnston Flynn.\n\nKitty (38), Anne (35), Elizabeth (32) and James Flynn (27) lived in New York with their sister Delia's family at the time of the 1920 census and they all worked at a hotel. Kitty was actually the Treasurer and James was the Paymaster.\n\nElizabeth, 35, and sister, Kitty, 42, were with the Richard & Delia (Flynn) Lindo family in the 1930 census and says they immigrated in 1917. They worked for a restaurant. Elizabeth is also *possibly* found as a servant for a private family in the 1930 census. That Elizabeth Flynn was a naturalized citizen and her immigration date was 1928, which was more likely her date of naturalization.\n\nShe filed a Declaration to become a naturalized US citizen in NY court in 1926, and petitioned for naturalization in 1928, at which time Richard Lindo was a sponsor. The petition says she left Ireland in July 1923 and arrived in New York in Aug 1923. Birth date is 2 March 1895. On the ship's manifest, it says her mother was Mrs. J. Flynn, Laragon, Collooney, Ire.\n\nThe 1930 census says she was a naturalized citizen and although the writing is really bad on the petition, it looks like 1929.\n\nIn 1922, Annie Flynn 25 and Elizabeth Flynn 27 went from New York to Ireland. - So if that is them, they might have traveled back and forth.\n\nIn the 1940 census of New York, Elizabeth, Flynn, 45, was a patient in the Pilgrim State Hospital for the Insane.\n\n54 F xiii. Alice Flynn was born in 1899, died in Dec 1995 at age 96, and was buried in Saint Nathys Cemetery, Collooney, County Sligo, Ireland.\n\nGeneral Notes: Paraic Donoghue's grandmother.\n\nAlice married Thomas Haran.

In the sorrow of his passing, his family is comforted by the love and support of a shared faith and the knowledge that he is free and at one with the glory of his God. Bill Brennan was born on December 30, 1927. A Jersey boy from Atlantic City, known affectionately by his mother and father as Billy, he spent his youth among a large extended family on the beaches and Boardwalk of that town when it was in its prime. Growing up as the son of William P. Brennan and Crescentia Grogan Brennan, the hard times of the depression era were part of his life but never limited the joy he experienced as a youth. Bill attended Villanova University along with his brother Timothy Brennan and graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering. He served in the Air Force and while stationed in the Boston area met and married his beloved wife Miriam Knight Brennan. Bill and Mim were married for 58 years and shared 4 children who collectively were the center of his world, his reason for living and the joy of his life. In the joint raising of their four children, Bill enjoyed being involved in all of his children's school activities and supported their efforts through successful completions of college degrees. A humble Catholic, Bill was a member of St John Vianney Catholic church for over 40 years where he served as a founding member of the community, a parish council president, a religious education instructor, a Eucharistic minister to the aged and was devoted to perpetual adoration. He shared the beauty of his faith with his children and grandchildren. Bill had a great love of music and played banjo, ukulele, piano and sang and particularly enjoyed his time in the spotlight with the St John Vianney Virtuosi. His love of music lives on in his children and grandchildren. Bill's successful career spanned 6 decades. He began with Air Force as a liaison to the Army Corp of Engineers but quickly moved into corporate life and was with ExxonMobil in sales, marketing and management for 33 years. ExxonMobil brought him to Houston and he remained an enthusiastic Texan. Not one to rest on his laurels, or rest at all for that matter, with the energy of a man twice his junior he continued his career with Holland Chemical Inc and MasterRank, both foreign based companies. This allowed him the opportunity to travel extensively in his later life spending time in both Europe and China. While Bill accomplished much in his lifetime, he would always point to the achievements of his children and grandchildren and the abundant love of his family as being what meant the most to him. He is survived by his wife Miriam Knight Brennan of Houston Texas, and his four children, Nancy Janet of Atlanta GA, Peter Brennan of Charlotte NC, Kate Shetrone of Cypress TX and Paula Brennan of Houston TX and Washington DC. He is also survived by his brother Timothy Brennan of Florida. His Spirit will continue to smile with joy on his five grandchildren, Laura Janet, Reese and Kerri Shetrone and Shannon and Ryan Brennan.

A tour of duty was considered complete at 25 missions. - In the early 1960s, he flew \"Looking Glass\" missions, which ensured that if the Strategic Air Command was destroyed, there was always a military plane aloft that would serve as a nuclear command post. He retired with 8,000 hours of flight time in B-17 Flying Fortresses and more than 10,000 hours of total flight time. - Among his awards were the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal. - He retired to Alexandria in 1968 and operated a car rental business in the early 1970s. Later, he was a real estate investor and landlord for area commercial and rental properties. - General Rader was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, and enrolled in a pilot training program at the old Wittenberg College in Ohio. He left college to enlist in the Army Air Corps. - He later completed the requirements at the University of Maryland for a degree in military science.

Rader, of Alexandria, and a sister.\n\nCourtesy of the United States Air Force\n\nBRIGADIER GENERAL WILLIAM S. RADER\n\nRetired May 1, 1968 - Brigadier General William S. Rader returned to Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, January 20, 1965, to become the Deputy Commander of Strategic Air Command's 1st Strategic Aerospace Division. He had previously served there as the commander of the 704th Strategic Missile Wing (Atlas), and for a brief period, as deputy commander, 1st Missile Division, before departing for Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, in July 1959. At F.E. Warren Air Force Base, General Rader commanded the 13th Strategic Missile Division. - General and Mrs. Rader first came to Vandenberg Air Force Base (then known as Cooke Air Force Base) in the summer of 1957. The 704th was a unit of the Air Research and Development Command at that time. - A native of Wheeling, West Virginia, General Rader entered the Army Air Corps in November 1940, as an Aviation Cadet. Later, as a B-17 aircraft commander in 1942, he completed 17 sorties during the Battle of Midway. - On one mission over the Pacific, which lasted more than 17 hours, his aircraft was so badly damaged by Japanese guns it was unable to complete the return to Hawaii. For nearly 20 hours, the genera1 floated in the water supported only by a life jacket before being sighted by another B-17. - As flight commander of the 368th Bomb Squadron in England later in the war, General Rader made one of the first deep penetration, daylight raids over Europe. He took his unit, unescorted by the shorter range fighters, to a point more than 200 miles southeast of Paris. Despite heavy enemy fire, which knocked out two of his aircraft's engines and the manual elevator controls, he bombed the primary target and made it back to England on automatic pilot. For this, General Rader was awarded the Silver Star on August 26, 1943. - The general also led the Eighth Bomber Command's first division of B-17s that month against the ball bearing plants of Schweinfurt, in one of the most historic missions of the war in Europe. - He has studied at Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio, and at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he completed requirements for a degree in military science. - A graduate of the Air War College, General Rader has held many assignments which include deputy commander, 7th Bomb Wing; air operations officer with the Joint Task Force on Eniwetok; chief of the Tech Training Division, Headquarters U.S. Air Force; assistant for Operational Readiness Division, and chief for Plans and Policies, Headquarters ARDC; and, prior to his assignment to Cooke Air Force Base, he served as inspector general, Headquarters ARDC. - His work with the Air Research and Development Command earned for him the Legion of Merit, awarded for leadership and management of the Plans and Policies Office there.\n\nWilliam married Major Stephanie Czech on 25 Sep 1946 in New York City, New York.
