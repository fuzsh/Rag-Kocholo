        "text": "(1795-1849)\n\nWho Was James Polk?\n\nJames Polk was the 11th and youngest (at the time) president of the United States (1845–1849). Polk’s annexation of Texas led to the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), and the U.S. victory thereby led to the acquisition of large territories in the Southwest and along the Pacific coast, which in turn led to the establishment of the Department of the Interior. The northern border of the United States was also established under Polk, as were the Naval Academy and the Smithsonian. He died on June 15, 1849, in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nEarly Years\n\nJames Knox Polk was born in Pineville, a small town in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, on November 2, 1795, and graduated with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. Leaving his law practice behind, he served in the Tennessee legislature, where he became friends with Andrew Jackson. Polk moved from the Tennessee legislature to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1825 to 1839 (and serving as speaker of the House from 1835 to 1839). He left his congressional post to become governor of Tennessee.\n\nApproaching the Presidency\n\nLeading into the presidential election of 1844, Polk was the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for the vice presidency. Both would-be presidential candidates, Martin Van Buren for the Democrats and Henry Clay for the Whigs, sought to skirt the expansionist (\"manifest destiny\") issue during the campaign, seeing it as potentially controversial. The first step in distancing their campaigns was declaring opposition to the annexation of Texas. Polk, on the other hand, took a hard stance on the issue, insisting on the annexation of Texas and, in a roundabout way, Oregon.\n\nEnter Jackson, who knew that the American public favored westward expansion. He sought to run a candidate in the election committed to the precepts of manifest destiny, and at the Democratic Convention, Polk was nominated to run for the presidency. Polk went on to win the popular vote by a razor-thin margin but took the electoral college handily.\n\nPresidency and Expansionism\n\nPolk took office on March 4, 1845, and at 49 years of age, he became the youngest president in American history. Before Polk took the oath of office, Congress offered annexation to Texas, and when they accepted and became a new state, Mexico severed diplomatic relations with the United States and tensions between the two countries escalated.\n\nJames Polk\n\nRegarding the Oregon territory, which was much larger than the current state of Oregon, President Polk would have to contend with England, who had jointly occupied the area for nearly 30 years. Polk's political allies claimed the entire Oregon area for the United States, from California northward to the 54° 40' latitude (the southern boundary of what is now Alaska), and so the mantra \"54-40 or fight!\" was born. Neither England nor the Polk administration wanted a war, and Polk knew that only war would likely allow the United States to claim the land.\n\nAfter back-and-forth negotiation, and some effective hardball played by Polk, the British accepted the 49th parallel as the northern border (the current border between the United States and Canada), excluding the southern tip of Vancouver Island, and the deal was sealed in 1846.\n\nThings went less smoothly in the hunt for California and New Mexico, and ever-increasing tensions led to the Mexican-American War. After several battles and the American occupation of Mexico City, Mexico ceded New Mexico and California in 1848, and coast-to-coast expansion was complete.\n\nLater Years and Death\n\nDuring his campaign, Polk promised to only serve one term as president. He kept that promise and did not seek re-election in 1848.\n\nPolk left the White House in the spring of 1849 and returned to his home in Nashville, Tennessee. However, the stress of the presidency had taken its toll on Polk and he died that summer at just 53 years old.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: James Polk\n\nBirth Year: 1795\n\nBirth date: November 2, 1795\n\nBirth State: North Carolina\n\nBirth City: Pineville (Mecklenburg County)\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: James Polk was the 11th president of the United States, known for his territorial expansion of the nation chiefly through the Mexican-American War.\n\nIndustries\n\nWorld Politics\n\nU.S. Politics\n\nWar and Militaries\n\nLaw\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nAstrological Sign: Scorpio\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of North Carolina\n\nDeath Year: 1849\n\nDeath date: June 15, 1849\n\nDeath State: Tennessee\n\nDeath City: Nashville\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: James Polk Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/political-figures/james-polk\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: October 24, 2019\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"
