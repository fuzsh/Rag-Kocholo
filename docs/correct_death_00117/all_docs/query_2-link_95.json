He planned to spend his retired years at his newly acquired mansion in downtown Nashville which was known as Polk Place.  Before he went to his new home, he toured parts of the country, but he got sick before getting home.  After spending three months at home, he died of Cholera on June 15, 1849.\n\t\n\tDue to the cholera scare, laws were passed where those who fell victim to the infectious disease had restriction on their burials.

His body only remained here for about a year.\n\t\n\tOn May 22, 1850, Polk's body was moved to the preferred location of his home, Polk Place.  His wife Sarah Childress Polk lived at Polk Place another four decades but passed away in 1891.  Two years later, developers wanted the prime real estate of Polk Place, and President Polk was moved again, along with his wife to the <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/9aYhU\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">grounds of the state capitol</a> in 1893.
