        "text": "“This cottage where I was born is physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life,” Herbert Hoover once declared. The Republican’s personal experiences that resembled aspects of a Horatio Alger novel colored his optimistic view of what was possible for anyone in the United States regardless of their initial social station. His climb up the proverbial ladder began when he was three or four years old, when the Hoover family left the small cottage and relocated to a more spacious dwelling a short walk south. Both residences were incredibly close to patriarch Jesse Hoover’s blacksmith shop, seen at right in this image. The president’s birthplace and his father’s shop are now part of the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The second Hoover home in West Branch no longer exists.\n\n\"This is not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the United States. It is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be prevented. It is a question as to whether the American people on one hand will maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self-help through voluntary giving and the responsibility of local government as distinguished on the other hand from appropriations out of the Federal Treasury for such purposes. My own conviction is strongly that if we break down this sense of responsibility of individual generosity to individual and mutual self-help in the country in times of national difficulty and if we start appropriations of this character we have not only impaired something infinitely valuable in the life of the American people but have struck at the roots of self-government. Once this has happened it is not the cost of a few score millions, but we are faced with the abyss of reliance in future upon Government charity in some form or other. The money involved is indeed the least of the costs to American ideals and American institutions.\""
