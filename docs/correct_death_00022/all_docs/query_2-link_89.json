        "text": "President Hoover and the Great Depression\n\nInitially, President Hoover did very little to address the Depression, which did change at the end of his presidency. Still, his policies tackled the effects of the crisis and not the cause, and this allowed the Depression to worsen. His response is considered a huge failure.\n\n1929\n\nAlthough the government did not directly intervene at this point, this did not mean Hoover did nothing.\n\nIn November 1929, Hoover met with leaders of America's largest businesses. Hoover tried to persuade them to put in measures that would reduce unemployment, maintain wages, and invest in new projects to stimulate the economy. What was his thought behind this?\n\nHoover believed that businesses maintaining employment levels would restore confidence in the American economy.\n\nHoover believed maintaining wages and employment levels would retain purchasing power and re-stimulate the economy.\n\nHoover thought that these measures would lead to increased inflation and increased demand levels.\n\nHoover also negotiated a $160 million tax cut and committed more federal money to public works programmes.\n\nIn an attempt to help farmers, the Agricultural Marketing Act 1929 was passed. Hoover established the Federal Farm Board to help farmers buy, sell, and store agricultural surpluses. It also offered money to farm organisations, but not to farmers themselves, as Hoover did not want them to become dependent on it. The board was rather unsuccessful, and Hoover failed at the first initiative he created.\n\nAnother failure came as the investment in American industry and the demand for goods had begun to fall, leading American businesses to lay people off. Hoover's decision to encourage rather than enforce businesses to maintain employment and wages backfired and effectively led to mass unemployment.\n\n1930\n\nAt this point, Hoover was praised for his efforts; in fact, the New York Times wrote:\n\n“No one in his place could have done more.\n\nBusiness and government spending was increasing, but unemployment also continued to rise. In an attempt to tackle this, Hoover created the President’s Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE) in October 1930 to provide welfare to US citizens who had lost their jobs.\n\nThe PECE coordinated state and local relief programmes rather than giving federal assistance, limiting its success as state and local governments lacked finances. In keeping with Hoover's belief in voluntarism, he also convinced Congress to allow agriculture surpluses to be transferred to the Red Cross and distributed by various relief agencies.\n\nOne of Hoover’s most infamous responses to the Great Depression was the protectionist Smoot Hawley Tariff, introduced on 13 March 1930. Hoover placed high tariffs on imports to America to protect American labour, business, and farmers. What were the consequences?\n\nOver 25 nations responded by placing tariffs on American goods.\n\nThis was catastrophic for the United States, its manufacturers and producers.\n\nThese tariffs, and their retaliation, played a key part in the collapse of world trade.\n\n1931\n\nIn August 1931, the PECE was reorganised as thePresident’s Organisation on Unemployment Relief (POUR), which continued to coordinate other relief efforts, and pushed for donations from wealthy people to help the people, again refusing to provide direct funding.\n\nHoover was subject to much criticism, focusing on public works funding seen as a waste of money and his refusal to give federal aid seen as cruel. In late 1931, Hoover switched tactics.\n\n1932\n\nWhat did Hoover's new approach include?\n\nOn 22 January 1932, Hoover established The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to provide financial aid to businesses in urgent need. This did stabilise some businesses but the aid was not large enough to give significant relief.\n\nIn July 1932, the Emergency Relief Construction Act gave the RFC power to lend money to states and public works. Public works projects did not really take off until after Hoover's presidency had ended.\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank System was developed to provide banks with funds to be used for mortgages, and to make homeownership and home security more achievable; these banks were given $125million.\n\nHoover's reputation took a hit in July 1932 when around 17,000 WWI veterans and their supporters marched to Washington DC to claim payment of their war bonuses.\n\nThe 1926 Bonus Act awarded compensation to war veterans, but this was not due to be paid out until 1945. In 1932, veterans demanded the money immediately and marched on Washington DC.\n\nHoover refused to give in and eventually sent the US army to disperse the veterans, making him appear without compassion.\n\n1933"
