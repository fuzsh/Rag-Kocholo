        "text": "How much time do you spend in a museum? Dan and I spent two hours inside the Herbert Hoover Presidential Museum. This was after we spent the morning exploring the National Historic Site.\n\nWe wound through the museum in the chronological order of Herbert Hoover’s life. Perhaps it is natural as the amount one reads (at least for me) is inversely proportional to how long one has been in the museum.\n\nNow, it was a fascinating place, and I learned so much. I just started to get tired as we made our way through the rooms related to his presidency and the years after. After all, we had been Herbert Hoovering for five plus hours.\n\nHere, in a nutshell or in other words, Betty’s cliff notes, are the overview points we learned about Herbert Hoover.\n\nHerbert Hoover was born in 1874. The values of simplicity, honesty, equality, peace and service to others, instilled in him by his Quaker family would remain with him the rest of his life.\n\nWhen Herbert was six, his father died. Just three years after that, his mother, Hulda, died. Eventually, he was sent to live with his uncle who ran a school. This let to Herbert Hoover attending Stanford University.\n\nIn college, Herbert Hoover studied geology and met his wife, Lou Henry. She was the only female geology student at the college.\n\nAfter college, Herbert was an extremely successful geologist working overseas. This led to him being financially independent for the rest of his life.\n\nHerbert Hoover became a humanitarian and was well known for his efforts to help those suffering from the effects of WWI.\n\nHerbert Hoover, still dedicated to public service, became the Secretary of Commerce. He was highly successful in this role.\n\nHis humanitarian efforts and his success as the Secretary of Commerce led to Herbert Hoover being elected as the President of the United States.\n\nSeven months after being sworn into office as President, the stock market crashed.\n\nHerbert Hoover served as a one term president. He was not reelected as many placed the blame for the Great Depression on him.\n\nOn one wall, near the museum’s entrance, is a mural depicting the chapters in Herbert Hoover’s life. I took pictures of the entire mural and broke it into sections to generally correspond with the points above.\n\nHere are a few more pictures I’d like to share:\n\nHerbert Hoover’s wife died in 1944. After she died, Herbert Hoover donated their home in Palo Alto, California to Stanford University. The Hoovers also had a second home, an apartment in the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. Herbert Hoover moved to that apartment and lived there 20 more years.\n\nFor our last stop, we visited the grave site of Herbert Hoover and his wife, Lou. It is outdoors, with a simple design, reflecting the values of simplicity and humility Herbert lived his entire life. As a side note, there are no statues of Herbert Hoover on the grounds.\n\nIf you stand at the flagpole and look out over the grounds, in the distance you can see Herbert Hoover’s birthplace cottage, thus symbolizing his journey life from start to finish."
