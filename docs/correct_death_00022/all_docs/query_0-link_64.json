        "text": "Herbert Hoover, a self-made man and humanitarian, matched the idealism of the booming 1920s economy.\n\nHis opponent was the governor of New York, Alfred Smith. The two differed on enforcement of Prohibition (with Hoover promising to enforce it to the fullest) and protective tariffs (also supported by Hoover).\n\nHoover assured Americans that the prosperity of the 20s was here to stay. He claimed the end of poverty was nearer than ever, famously promising “a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage.” He won the election by a large margin. Within 8 months the worst economic crisis in American history began.\n\nBOOKS\n\nDavis, Kenneth C., and Pedro Martin. Don’t Know Much about the Presidents.
