        "text": "The Herbert Hoover National Historic Site and neighboring Hoover Presidential Library and Museum were unusually quiet Wednesday morning.\n\nTucked in the southwest corner of West Branch — not far from the Interstate 80 exit to the town of just over 2,300 people — all that could be heard at the collection of historic homes, the large museum and a visitor center was the clattering of flagpoles in the wind.\n\nThe offices and the visitor center for the historic site are closed. So are the library and museum. The site dedicated to one of Iowa's most famous politicians — the 31st president of the United States — remains mostly lifeless thanks to the federal government shut down now heading into its third week.\n\nThe shutdown, caused by the stalemate between President Donald Trump and Congress over funding for the controversial border wall, has real-world ramifications on the small Iowa town.\n\nStaff from the museum and library, as well as the historic site's park rangers and other employees, are currently furloughed. Brad Reiners, communications manager for the Hoover Presidential Foundation, said that more than 20 people are currently furloughed. The foundation, a separate entity that promotes and supports the historic site, library and museum, is still running.\n\nLike most federal employees across the nation, the furloughed workers are not receiving pay as the shutdown drags on.\n\nVisitors are welcomed to both facilities with similar signs. At the visitor center front door, and at points throughout the historic sites, messages read \"While Herbert Hoover NHS is accessible to the public during the lapse in federal appropriation, the National Park Service (NPS) is unable to fully staff the properties under its management.\"\n\n\"Park visitors are advised to use extreme caution if choosing to enter NPS property, as NPS personnel will not be able to provide guidance, assistance, maintenance or emergency response. Any entry onto NPS property during this period of federal government shutdown is at the visitor's sole risk.\"\n\nThat means any visitor can walk around and see the home Hoover grew up in or the nearby church, but no services or staff are available to the public.\n\nRedmond Jones II, West Branch's city administrator, said the federal government shutdown will negatively impact the town due to the historic site's popularity.\n\n\"Obviously, from an economic development point, it is a major reason we have out-of-town visitors, and we do have people visit from all across the country,\" Jones said.\n\n\"It's a constant stream into our community, and usually when you visit the museum or grave site, you'll go to a local restaurant or cafe too.\"\n\nJones said that Pete Swisher, the historic site's superintendent, was the only employee still working. Staff at the historic site, including Swisher, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThough there aren't hard numbers about the economic impact so far, Jones said he is certain the shutdown will hurt the town's economy if it continues much longer.\n\nJones said that police have been picking up extra patrols around the historic site to keep watch over the land that is still open to the public but without its normal stewards. That means more work for the West Branch Police Department.\n\nIt also makes some city planning more difficult. Since the town is inexorably tied to the historic site, library and museum, local festival planning will have to wait. The town's biggest festival, Hoover's Hometown Days, held around Hoover's Aug. 10 birthday, heavily features both of the now-closed entities.\n\nThere are also major projects currently up in the air. Jones said that the city is working with the NPS for a United States Geological Survey study of local bodies of water. \"Our money is ready; the matching money from the federal government is up in the air,\" he said.\n\nA statement from Sen. Chuck Grassley's office to the Iowa City Press-Citizen about the shutdown read:\n\n\"As this is a partial government shutdown many agencies and departments are fully funded and operational, including the legislative branch, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Labor, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and most of the Department of Health and Human Services. Right now, Sen. Grassley is encouraging his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reach a solution that reopens what is shut down of the federal government and fully funds national security on the border. Sen. Grassley has said there’s no reason that both can’t be done and these goals shouldn’t be in conflict ...\n\nAs with past government shutdowns, workers will likely be paid retroactively when the government reopens after funding legislation is passed. In the meantime, Sen. Grassley’s office is also working to determine how Iowans employed by the federal government are affected and what contingency plans are in place to minimize the burden.\"\n\nA statement from Democratic U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack released on Dec. 21 read:\n\n“It is shameful that we are even in this position. There is a noncontroversial bipartisan deal that the White House had previously agreed to and has passed the Senate and would pass the House if brought up. Republicans must put aside the gimmicks and immediately vote on the only funding bill that is guaranteed to pass. Additionally, it is irresponsible that the House has adjourned just hours before the government will shutdown without passing a funding bill.\n\n“It is unacceptable that Republican leaders have caved to political games and failed to pass a funding bill to keep the government open. The number one job of Congress is to ensure our government is serving the needs of the people. There is no good reason we are in this situation.”\n\nThe Hoover National Historic Site is one of two parks run by the NPS in the state of Iowa. Effigy Mounds National Monument in Harpers Ferry, along the Mississippi River in northeastern Iowa, is the other. Famous for its 200-plus Native American burial mounds shaped like animals, the mounds that sit atop a bluff overlooking the Mississippi are nearly 2,000 years old.\n\nThose who call the Effigy Mounds visitor center receive a recorded message that states that the park is closed \"due to the federal government shutdown,\" but that all trails are currently open.\n\nA similar fate has befallen most of the national parks, from Acadia National Park in Maine to Yosemite National Park in California. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the state of National Parks are deteriorating quickly due to the partial shutdown. Many are visiting the larger national parks without having to pay the customary entrance fee and little to no supervision by park rangers. That means trash can be found strewn across the parks and toilets go not serviced or cleaned.\n\nSimilar happenings aren't exactly an issue in West Branch, with the historic site located on 186 acres in the middle of town. Jones said that he was \"confident that this won't have too big an impact\" on West Branch, but he warned: \"if this stuff keeps carrying on, it will have a residual effect on our people.\"\n\nAsked if he had a message for Iowa's representatives in Congress and for President Trump, Jones said: \"these decisions have effects.\"\n\nReach Zach Berg at 319-887-5412, zberg@press-citizen.com or follow him on Twitter at @ZacharyBerg."
