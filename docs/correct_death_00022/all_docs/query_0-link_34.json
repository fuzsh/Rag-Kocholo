        "text": "\"I'm cool, right? The people hate me. My Party says I'm the worst President we've ever had. My mom even called me up last night, from the hospital, and told me she just wanted to tell me how much of a failure I was before she went. But you guys think I'm pretty cool, don't you?\" - Hoover pleading to Congress, 1935\n\nHerbert Hoover was a politician, mining engineer, and businessman, serving as the 31st President of the United States for the Whig Party. Hoover was known for his medium-speed wit, determined inaction, and for his repeated failures to make himself appear as a \"cool\" and powerful leader, which often resulted in harsh criticism and public humiliation of Hoover.\n\nDespite his failure to handle the collapse of the U.S economy, and his frequent mismanagement of internal affairs, Hoover had a lasting legacy throughout the Whig Party via the controversial Hooverite Purge, which was carried out on the revelation that several Labor Party spies had infiltrated the Whig Party and saw the more traditional, protectionist officials within the party stripped of their positions and replaced with businessmen who supported Hoover's vision of a hands-off, interventionist economy which focused on minimal government interference except in times of emergency. Though the claim is disputed, various officials said they were notified of their demotions when they recieved notecards on their desks reading, \"YOU'VE been HOOVER DAMNED!\"\n\nIronically, Hoover's decision to purge the party pushed many traditionalist Whigs to abandon him and form the Liberal Party of the United States, splitting the vote and contributing to the next election's sweeping victory by Huey Long. It's been speculated that the incident could have very well spelled the death of the Whig Party, had Long not been assassinated and succeeded by his much less moderate Vice President, Earl Browder, who not only used various underhanded tactics to undermine the growing Liberal Party, but also drove the American public to the right in reaction to his extremist views and policy, leading to two consecutive Federalist Party victories before the Liberals could secure the White House. Nonetheless, the Whigs would not go on to win another election until 60 years later with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992."
