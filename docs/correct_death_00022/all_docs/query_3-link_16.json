        "text": "In 1929 Herbert Hoover became the 31st president of the United States. Soon after his election the country sank into the Great Depression. Hoover had helped many starving people in Europe during World War I (1914–18). However, he could not help the millions of U.S. citizens who lost their jobs during the depression.\n\nHoover graduated from Stanford University in 1895 with a degree in geology. He became a mining engineer and worked in many countries, including China. In 1899 Hoover married Lou Henry. The couple had two sons. Hoover eventually started his own engineering firm with offices around the world.\n\nDuring and after World War I, Hoover headed organizations that sent food to soldiers and hungry people in Europe. From 1921 to 1928 Hoover served as secretary of commerce under presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. He supported efforts by workers to improve their conditions. He also supported major engineering projects, including the construction of what became known as the Hoover Dam.\n\nThe Republican Party chose Hoover to run for president in 1928. He easily defeated the Democratic candidate, Alfred E. Smith. When Hoover took office, the economy was strong. In October 1929, however, the stock market crashed, and the worst depression in U.S. history began.\n\nHoover quickly asked companies not to fire workers or cut wages. But many people had already lost their jobs. Hoover approved a program that lent government money to states, banks, and companies. Hoover refused to give money directly to citizens, though. As the Great Depression worsened, the public began to blame the president."
