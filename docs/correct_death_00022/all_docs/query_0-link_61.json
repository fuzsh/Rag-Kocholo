        "text": "31st President\n\nTerms: 1929-1933\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nFirst Lady: Lou Henry Hoover\n\nVice President: Charles Curtis\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: August 10, 1874 in West Branch, Iowa... Hoover was the last president whose term ended on March 3. Thereafter all presidential terms began and ended on January 20. Hoover's presidency began amidst grand optimism as the prosperity of the 1920s carried him into office. Timing was not in his favor, however. Seven months later, the stock market crashed and the Great Depression took hold. Hoover's various attempts to reassure a panicked public, by policy and decree, failed, and he found himself being solely blamed for the economic catastrophe... Died: October 20, 1964 .\n\nThe Era\n\n1929: Stock market crash\n\n1931: Empire State building opens\n\n1931: Al Capone convicted on charges of tax evasion\n\n1931: Pearl Buck publishes The Good Earth\n\n1931: Japanese troops occupy Manchuria\n\n1932: Amelia Earhart is the first woman to fly solo across Atlantic\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nDespite being at the helm of government when the stock market crashed and the Great Depression set in, Herbert Hoover was not the do-nothing president his detractors claimed. In fact, he entered the presidency with an array of programs and reforms designed to address the most pressing issues of the day. His fault lay mainly in his approach. While he went out of his way to encourage businesses and organizations to refine their operations for the betterment of all, he refused to challenge Congress or assert forceful presidential leadership. Further, his firm belief in American individualism blinded him to the necessity for governmental intervention in even the most dire of circumstances.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nHoover designed several of his foreign policy initiatives to ease international upheaval caused by a worldwide depression. For example, Hoover proposed a one-year suspension on all World War I debts and reparations. Elsewhere, he dispatched U.S. warships to Shanghai, China, in order to protect U.S. citizens. But he and Secretary of State Henry Stimson issued the Hoover-Stimson doctrine, refusing to recognize the Japanese conquest of Manchuria."
