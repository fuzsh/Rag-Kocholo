        "meta_description": "Poland, recreated after the armistice of 1918, was confronted at its rebirth with four very severe challenges: welding together the separate sections of the dissected country, which for many decades had been under the rule of Prussia-Germany, Austria and Russia; creating a functioning administration and military force for the country; ensuring the recovery of agriculture, which, during World War I, had seriously declined; and restarting industries destroyed or closed during foreign military occupation. Even under the valuable leadership of the first Prime Minister of the new Polish Republic Ignacy Paderewski and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the Poles could not accomplish the goal of rebuilding a strong Poland without outside help. The American Relief Administration (ARA), founded and led by Herbert Hoover, offered their help. The ARA, with its food aid and provision of economic assistance and expertise, played an important role in bringing about stability in the newly independent state of Poland. This paper examines the many steps Herbert Hoover had to take to arrange food relief in Poland and will outline the organization of the ARA, including the establishment of the Polish relief organization and the introduction of young Polish-American women, called the Grey Samaritans, into the field.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n2. The U.S. Enters the War\n\n11 Ibid.\n\nWhile the Poles seem to be in possession of Dantzig itself, and British and American War Ships are in the harbor, the country behind Dantzig up to Polish frontier is in hands of Germans and no movements of supplies or personnel between Poland and Dantzig can be made without definite arrangement of the Armistice Commission.\n\n8Nevertheless, Hoover was determined to persevere with a plan for food relief.\n\n3. The Goals of the ARA\n\n14The general plan that originated in Paris for Poland, as well as for the other European countries receiving ARA relief for children, included the following:\n\nWith the ARA donation as a nucleus, first national, then regional, then local governments should be made to share as large a part as possible in the relief. It is suggested that the money from the ARA and the national government be employed for imported foodstuffs only, whereas the local committees would stand the expense of installation and maintenance of milk dispensaries and soup kitchens for children.\n\nPrivate resources should be called upon as far as possible, both in money and in services. All members of national, regional and local committees should be volunteers. The women who preside at the school kitchens and who actually serve soup to the children should be volunteers. While making use of the volunteer help to the fullest extent possible, the relief work should be run on clear cut business lines. Paid directors, inspectors and clerks should be judiciously distributed so as to give the system permanency and insure its operation in an efficient and economical way.\n\nThe desire of the American Relief Administration is that we should aid the children of the countries in distress, not only during the present emergency but that the organization formed now should persist in the form of a permanent Child Welfare Board supported by the national government. To this end, the Children’s Relief work should be carried on under one of the Ministries, preferably that of Public Health. At the same time, the organization should have the greatest possible freedom and initiative, and should not be tied up with any government bureaucratic system, which might hinder both its speed of getting under way and its policy of expansion. While the Ministry is the general guide, the organization still must be thoroughly “popular.”\n\n21 Grove, 178-179.\n\nAt the time the children’s relief work is started with the American gift as the foundation, request should be made that all organizations now caring for children and mothers combine so as to work together in the same direction. If, for instance, there are societies for furnishing milk to babies, or for feeding needy children in schools, or for care of orphans and so on, these should be united nationally, regionally and locally by representatives from these various societies who will become members of the national regional and local committees. In general, three principles should be laid down for the formation of committees, they should be as small as possible, should consist only of persons actively participating in the work and should include when possible a physician.\n\n15Hoover made sure that all relief organizations inside and outside the United States were running their relief through the ARA. The American and Russian Red Cross units in Poland distributed supplies through the ARA; and the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), the YMCA and YWCA were all connected with the ARA. The Polish government had instructions that all relief from the United States, whether monetary or material was to be channeled through the ARA organization. In 1920, the Polish government attempted to raise relief funds outside the American Mission. Hoover wrote the following in regard to this attempt:\n\n22 Hoover to Gibson, Cablegram, October 23, 1920, ARA Europe, Box 707, Folder 5, Hoover.\n\nAny other appeal will completely confuse [the] situation and largely reduce expected donations. We want to make it quite clear to [the] Polish government that unless they cease these periodic independent efforts we cannot expect to meet child feeding requirements and will withdraw.\n\n16Hoover believed that the relief of Poland would not be efficient if different organizations were working separately from each other. Hoover envisioned the ARA as the master relief organization working with other relief agencies to provide aid to Poland without confusion or delay.\n\n4. The Creation of the American Relief Administration Children’s Fund\n\n28 Kellogg, 3.\n\nWe see very few children playing in the streets of Warsaw. Why were they not playing? The answer was simple and sufficient: The children of Warsaw were not strong enough to play in the streets. They could not run; many could not walk; some could not even stand up. Their weak little bodies were bones clothed with skin, but not muscles. They simply could not play.\n\nthe building up of a native organization for the distribution of the relief material sent from America, as well as of that contributed locally in Poland,\n\nthe distribution of food in Poland during 1920 and a part of 1921, through the “food draft” system,\n\nthe distribution of miscellaneous relief gifts to needy persons of the intellectual class, to university students and professors, and in 1920, at the time of the Bolshevik invasion, to refugees,\n\n34 Ibid., Foreword.\n\n[and later] serving as one of the communication links between London and the ARA operation in Russia, as well as arranging for the transport across Poland of a part of the relief supplies destined for Russia.\n\n5. Activities of the Polish Organization\n\n38June 1919 was an arduous month both for the Polish and the American organizations. In most districts, the children’s food relief was received with enthusiasm; in others, even where the need was very great, the Polish and American inspectors encountered problems. In many cases, the rural populations did not understand the importance of the requirement of receiving foodstuffs only in cooked form and at the kitchens. The people wanted the food immediately in raw form but the ARA would not supply the food in this method because the American mission wanted to make sure that only needy children were receiving the food and that others did not profit from the American aid. In some cases, it took all the efforts and patience of both the American and the Polish inspectors to convince the people and the local committees of the necessity for this condition. In some towns, food depots were attacked by mobs who insisted on distributing the food immediately and in raw form. This occurred mostly in the eastern borderlands of Poland. After living through the Czarist retreat, the German invasion, the German retreat followed by the Bolshevik invasion and the Bolshevik retreat, and, finally the Polish invasion, the rural populations in the eastern borderlands had little trust in any groups of foreigners who came to their localities. They therefore did not trust the Americans in the beginning.\n\n6. Classifying Need\n\n64 “Red Curse Over Poland: Bolsheviki Cause of Country’s Misery, Says Relief Worker [Adeline Fuller], (...)\n\nNothing is more heartbreaking than to go through the schools to pick out the worst cases. Those who are not on the extreme edge of starvation are left behind. To hear them sob when they find that they are not picked for the meal a day makes one doubt the existence of supreme right and justice.\n\n7. Distribution\n\n8. Start of the Grey Samaritans\n\n77 Lerski, 23.\n\nThese girls, young and unspoiled, combined in a remarkable way the emotional enthusiasm and devotion of the Pole with the efficiency and persistence of the American … They aided tremendously in the feeding program undertaken under Hoover, especially as department inspectors since they spoke both English and Polish. Carrying out the Hoover policy of self-help, fifteen of these girls took on as understudies fifteen young Polish college girls so that when the Grey Samaritan must finally return to America, there would remain in Poland a body of trained workers of practical experience in child welfare work.\n\n79 Chickering, 25.\n\nThere is an appalling amount of eye-infection and tuberculosis among the children. Out of two thousand school children examined, practically all had tuberculosis in one form or another. In the case of these diseases, our girls will attempt to teach the victims the simpler rules of care and prevention.\n\n82 Chickering, 25.\n\n(1) to set a standard for child welfare work for Poland, and (2) build up a scientific social service based on the case work method. (Statistics were frowned upon under Russia, so a survey is difficult to make but, as nearly as [they] could find out, the death-rate of children in Warsaw seemed to be about twenty-five percent).\n\n52By the end of the operations, the number of Samaritans was gradually reduced and most women were located in the eastern districts of Poland, helping feed the children and reporting to the district inspectors. The Samaritans often lived in hotels without running water or reliable electrical power. Yet, they were especially dedicated to their work, for they were rebuilding the country of their birth. Their task was to feed and clothe the future generation of Poland, to help establish orphanages and schools, to assist in refugee camps by creating activities for the desperate people, and most of all, to give hope to the people of Poland by showing them through their actions that with hard work Poland could become strong. A report by a Grey Samaritan says it best:\n\n83 “Polish Grey Samaritans,” Reports and Experiences of Polish Grey Samaritans, October 1921, Polish (...)\n\nEach girl is working in the east of Poland with a Ford car as her means of conveyance… when the Ford goes: if not, otherwise and often, traveling by methods as primitive as two hundred years ago. A region perhaps as large as the state of New Jersey, is her hunting ground, to seek for abuses in the operation itself, for the education of people in the use of food and for the caring for children.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\n54In their time of need, the American Relief Administration led by Herbert Hoover, stepped in and gave the Poles the crucial relief they desperately required. The ARA staff fed hungry people; they helped restart the industries; they helped in rebuilding commerce; and they provided clothing and care for children. The ARA aid played an important role in bringing about stability in the newly independent state of Poland through food aid and technical advice in industry and governmental administration. Herbert Hoover took many bold though calculated steps to arrange food relief in Poland, including the establishment of the Polish relief organization and the introduction of the young Polish-American women into the field. The ARA effort was tantamount to Poland’s survival during the Polish-Soviet War; a war which had wide ranging consequences for Europe and the world. The spread of communism was defeated at the gates of Warsaw.\n\n56With the end of the Polish-Soviet War, the ARA in Poland concentrated its efforts on Polish refugee relief, focusing on providing food, clothing, and treatments against typhus for displaced persons and returning refugees. The ARA therefore provided relief to Poland during two wars up to 1921, thereby assisting the Polish people to create the Republic they longed to have."
