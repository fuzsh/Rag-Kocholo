        "text": "Download Image Resource\n\nImage\n\nCourtesy of National Archives and Records Administration, The New York Times, 30 October 1928\n\nDescription\n\nThis is the advertisement that caused President Herbert Hoover's opponents to state that he had promised voters a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage during the campaign of 1928. During the campaign of 1932, Democrats sought to embarrass the president by recalling his alleged statement. According to an article in The New York Times, Hoover did not make such a statement. The report was based on this ad placed by a local committee.\n\nTranscript of \"A Chicken for Every Pot\" Political Ad\n\nSource-Dependent Questions\n\nWhat policies are Republicans promoting that they have enacted which led to â€œ...raised living standards and lowered living costs?\" Do you think those policies lead to the standard of living stated or could other factors have led to this development?\n\nHow does this government policy, as laid out by the quote below, make the fall into the great depression more surprising? Did this make more difficult for individuals to accept the reality of the depression?\n\n\"Thanks to Republican administration, farmer, dairyman and merchant can make deliveries in less time and at less expense, can borrow cheap money to refund exorbitant mortgages, and stock their pastures, ranges and shelves.\"\n\nCitation Information\n\n\"A Chicken for Every Pot,\" The New York Times, 30 October 1928.
