        "text": "The city of Salem has recently placed a historical marker at the childhood home of President Herbert Hoover.\n\nThe marker comes at the end of Historic Preservation Month, which lasted throughout May, that helps celebrate the history and heritage of Salem.\n\nHoover was born in West Branch, Iowa in 1874. When both parents died of disease, Hoover was passed around among relatives before finally landing with his uncle in Newberg.\n\nIn 1888, the family moved to Salem, where Hoover's uncle began the Oregon Land Company. Hoover worked at the company for several years before moving on to Palo Alto, Calif. to attend Stanford University.\n\nHoover lived with the Minthorn family at the corner of Highland and Hazel Avenues NE in northeast Salem.\n\nIt still stands today, although it has since undergone an extensive remodel in the 60's that removed the top floor and attic area.\n\nThe marker now sits in the grass outside the home with the dates Hoover served as President of the United States and a historical photograph."
