Newcastle Jets marquee signing Jason Culina requires his second knee operation of the off-season and has been ruled out for the entire A-League campaign.

Culina had major knee surgery at the end of last season and according to the Jets was on the verge of returning before being struck down by an alignment problem, unrelated to his successful cartilage procedure.

The 31-year-old will undergo osteotomy surgery next week leaving the Jets without their key midfielder who they acquired from the Gold Coast.

"In consultation with the club, I have made this decision to have the operation as soon as possible to ensure I will be fit and ready for the 2012-13 season," Culina said in a statement.

"Whilst I feel frustrated to sit out the season I have nothing but confidence in how the team are playing and the young talent coming through will ensure the Jets have a great season."

Jets chief executive Rob Middleby confirmed the club would not be seeking a replacement for the Socceroo.

"We will not be adding to our squad in the short term but be relying on our strategy of developing and promoting home-grown products to give them a chance to shine in the A-League," he said.

"This policy has already been showing dividends with development of exciting new players like James Virgilli, Jacob Pepper and Taylor Regan who are undefeated after 10 trial games."

Culina's injury is a blow for the Jets and the A-League, which has generated plenty of preseason interest with the arrivals of fellow Socceroos Harry Kewell (Melbourne Victory) and Brett Emerton (Sydney FC).
