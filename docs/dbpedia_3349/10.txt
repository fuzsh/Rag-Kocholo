Socceroos midfielder Jason Culina has signed with A-League side Sydney FC, ending months of speculation about the 32-year-old's future.

The former Gold Coast United and Newcastle Jets midfielder has not played since the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar due to a serious knee injury.

"It's absolutely brilliant to be back," Culina said in a statement.

"It's something that kept me awake at night, thinking about playing again so I'm really happy and grateful to have the opportunity to continue my career so close to home with a club like Sydney FC.

"There were times I thought I wanted to give up but I knew that if I put in the effort and commitment I could get back so I never gave up on the desire to play again.

"I've had to put in a lot of hard work and some days it has been hard but I'd like to sincerely thank [Sydney FC physio] Stan Ivancic and the Sydney FC medical staff for what they did in helping me with my rehab at what was a tough time.

"Without them I wouldn't be where I am at the moment."

Culina, who has featured 58 times for the Socceroos, played for two seasons on the Gold Coast before his move to Newcastle, which was spent largely on the sidelines because of his knee complaint.

He lodged a $1.6 million claim against the FFA after it was revealed he had not been insured.
