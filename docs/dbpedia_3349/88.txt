Gold Coast United leapt to second position on the A-League ladder after a 2-0 win over a lethargic Newcastle Jets side at Skilled Park in Robina last night.

Socceroo Jason Culina scored one goal and set up another to take his side within two points of league leaders Sydney FC.

It was a somewhat bittersweet victory for Culina, whose father Branko coaches the opposition Jets.

All White Shane Smeltz, playing for the Gold Coast side, missed an excellent chance to add to his tally of A-League goals for the season when he put one wide after beating the defence and keeper.
