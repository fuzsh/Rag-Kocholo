        "text": "NEWCASTLE overcame a potentially career-ending injury to marquee player Fabio Vignaroli yesterday to hold on for a thrilling 3-2 win over Gold Coast at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\n\nThe Jets continued their impressive mid-season turnaround with their third consecutive win lifting them to fourth position on the ladder little more than a month after they were last.\n\nScores were locked at 1-1 until promising striker Sean Rooney put the Jets ahead in the 70th minute and substitute Sasho Petrovski looked to have put the result beyond doubt in the 80th minute.\n\nBut, star striker Shane Smeltz scored his second of the game in the 84th minute to set up a tense finale before Neil Young produced a great save to deny Jason Culina an equaliser.\n\nNewcastle midfielder Jobe Wheelhouse had opened the scoring with one of the goals of the season before Smeltz equalised with a penalty just before the break.\n\nThe win in front of 5254 fans was soured by a serious right-knee injury to 33-year-old Italian playmaker Vignaroli. Officials fear he has torn both his medial and anterior cruciate ligaments.\n\nGold Coast was looking set to go on and win before Rooney put the home side ahead. And the result looked beyond doubt when Petrovski netted his first goal of the season with a deft finish in the 80th minute from Rooney's cross.\n\nBut, Smeltz gave the visitors a chance when he pounced after Young spilled a Leon Osman shot, before the keeper tipped over Culina's long-range effort."
