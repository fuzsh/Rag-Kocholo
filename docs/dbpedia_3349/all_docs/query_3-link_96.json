        "text": "Newcastle Jets recently celebrated the 10 year anniversary of their 2007/08 Grand Final win over arch rivals Central Coast Mariners which remains the club’s only piece of silverware.\n\nWith that milestone in mind and with this year’s side the only one since then who might match their achievements, it seems like the perfect time to have a look at what some of the members of the squad have been up to since their successful campaign and what they find themselves doing now.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nGary van Egmond – The coach who made Newcastle’s dream become a reality. Built a brilliant team that included a number of local players who knew the real meaning of playing for the Jets. Had a much less successful second stint at the helm of the Jets and has since moved on to an assistant coaching role of the Matildas. His daughter Emily van Egmond now plays and captains the Jets W-League side.\n\nPlayers still in the A-League:\n\nBen Kantarovski & Jason Hoffman – Both players are the only two players from 2008 still playing for the Jets but Kantarovski is the only one to have stayed with the club the whole time after Hoffman spent a number of seasons at Melbourne Heart/City before returning to the Hunter in 2015.\n\nBen Kennedy – Was listed as a youth player in 2008 along with Kantarovski and Hoffman and much like them, was a stellar servant for the club for 10 years before moving to the Mariners at the beginning of the current season.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAndrew Durante – The Kiwi defender was a regular at the back for the Jets from 2006 to 2008. Durante won the Joe Marston medal for his performance In the 2008 Grand Final against the Mariners which turned out to be his last for the Jets. Has since moved to Wellington Phoenix where he has made almost 250 league appearances for the New Zealand club.\n\nTarek Elrich – The Jets’ all time second highest appearance maker and a firm fan favourite among the Newy faithful. Moved on to Western Sydney Wanderers as one of the club’s first signings in 2012. Following a frustrating season at the Wanderers, Elrich moved to his current club Adelaide United where he scored a superb solo goal against Melbourne City in 2015 before winning the title with the Reds the following year.\n\nMark Bridge – Will forever be remembered as the man who scored the solitary goal to hand Newcastle the Championship title in 2008. Has since had stints with Sydney FC, Chinese Super League club Tianjin Teda, Thai club Chiangrai United and finally Western Sydney Wanderers where he won the AFC Champions League title in 2014.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nJade North – Born just up the road in Taree, North was the Jets’ captain in their Championship winning season as well as the following year before leaving the club for Incheon United in the K-League. Has since had stints in Norway, New Zealand and Japan before returning to the A-League with Brisbane Roar.\n\nPlayers still in the game or retired:\n\nSong Jin-hyung – The South-Korean found reasonable success with the Jets and moved to French side Tours FC with hope of forging a career in Europe but ultimately found himself back in the K-League before too long. As for what he’s up to now, Song is at FC Seoul and his rating on FIFA 18 is 68 which isn’t really that bad. Good on you Song.\n\nJoel Griffiths – The 2007/08 league top scorer and Johnny Warren medal winner is a firm fan favourite and a Jets man through and through. Since retiring from football Griffiths has opened an Aussie Home Loans franchise in Newcastle and is enjoying life as a mortgage broker. The 38-year-old is also the current football operations manager at the Jets and has been instrumental in signing the likes of Ronny Vargas and Patricio Rodriguez.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nJobe Wheelhouse – After leaving the Jets in 2013 Wheelhouse has been playing football with NPL Northern NSW side Lambton Jaffas. He has also established his own football academy which he hopes can help give local kids the chance of a career in the sport but has recently encountered financial problems after a dispute with Sydney businessman Manuel Camara.\n\nJames Holland – Many may have forgotten about Holland’s stint in Newcastle but he played quite an important role in the 2007/08 season, coming off the bench for the final 15 minutes of the grand final. Since leaving, Holland has looked to find his way in Europe and is currently at Austrian side LASK Linz with a brief spell at Adelaide sandwiched between his overseas adventures.\n\nMatt Thompson – Former captain Thompson is the third all time appearance maker for the Jets and was yet another fan-favourite in the golden era of the club. Played for both Melbourne Heart and Sydney after leaving the Jets and has since returned to the Hunter to play for NPL Northern NSW side Maitland FC.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMario Jardel – Jardel’s time at the Jets was infamous for its mediocrity that was hardly surprising after his fall from grace in the footballing world. After leaving Newcastle Jardel played for no less than six clubs in three years bringing his club total to 17. Last he was heard of in the mainstream media was in 2015 when he was stopped at the airport in Porto Alegre, Brazil for trying to bring 10kg of fish into the country in his suitcase.\n\nStatistics sourced from ultimatealeague.com and aleaguestats.com"
