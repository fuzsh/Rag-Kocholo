        "text": "In a desperate bid to play this summer, Culina will begin a series of blood injections into his problematic left knee this week and has been told by doctors to avoid weight-bearing exercises ‘‘for several weeks’’.\n\nJets chief executive Robbie Middleby confirmed last night that the 31-year-old Socceroos midfielder could miss the first four to six weeks, but he said Culina and the club had not ruled out the worst-case scenario – that the star recruit would not play at all this season.\n\nMiddleby said Culina was shattered about the developments of the past two weeks but determined to do all he could to continue his career in Newcastle.\n\n‘‘We’re going to see how these next four to six weeks go and reassess it,’’ Middleby said. ‘‘It still could be bad news if something’s got to happen after that, but at the moment we want to give him every opportunity to not prematurely end his season.\n\n‘‘We’re going to give him every opportunity to make sure we’ve ticked all boxes and made sure that we’ve done everything possible, from our point of view as a club then the next step is whatever it’s going to be after that.’’\n\nIf Culina misses only the first four weeks, his earliest possible Jets debut would be against Perth at Ausgrid Stadium on November 5.\n\nCulina was poised to make his first appearance in Newcastle colours in a trial against South Coast Wolves in Wollongong two weeks ago but was forced to withdraw because of a setback with his knee, which he had surgically repaired in February.\n\nA series of scans and tests in the past two weeks have revealed no structural damage but, after consulting with Newcastle sports physician Neil Halpin and Melbourne-based orthopaedic specialist Julian Feller, Culina will proceed with a course of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to expedite the healing process.\n\n‘‘Jason will not be doing any weight-bearing exercises for several weeks and has been advised to avoid any heavy impact on the knee,’’ Middleby said.\n\nThough he appreciated that Jets supporters were frustrated about the situation, Middleby said noone was more disappointed than Culina.\n\n‘‘We feel for our fans but we’re feeling for Jason because he is absolutely devastated at the moment,’’ Middleby said. ‘‘He knows what we’re building here, and he knows how competitive the team has been in pre-season, and he’s been desperate to be a part of that.\n\n‘‘I found it difficult to talk to him the other day because he’s been that shattered with what’s gone on, and how hard he and our medical staff have worked to get him to the point he was at.\n\n‘‘He’s been at PSV Eindhoven and in national teams, and he realises what we’ve got going here and what we’re doing for him is absolutely professional and exceptional.’’"
