        "text": "BORING Branko? Hardly. It seems not even a recent fine from Football Federation Australia has dulled Branko Culina's sense of humour.\n\nThe Newcastle Jets coach produced a cheeky response when asked how he was preparing to tackle son Jason when Gold Coast United travels to EnergyAustralia Stadium today.\n\n''Jason who?,'' Culina replied in reference to his offspring.\n\nAll jokes aside, Culina said his son would be going all out to secure dinner-table bragging rights.\n\n''There wouldn't be a player on the Gold Coast, including the coaching staff, who would love to win more against us than Jason so he can brag about it,'' he said.\n\n''I'm in the same boat. It gives you that extra little bit of satisfaction, not only because we need the three points but because I know what a great player he is and a great competitor.\n\n''Whenever Jason has played well, they've won games. It would give me great satisfaction for him to have a quiet game and us to get the three points.''\n\nCulina believes a lack of respect by the Queenslanders was perhaps the key behind Newcastle's 1-0 win the last time these teams met, in August.\n\nBut he isn't expecting such generosity this time around.\n\n''We know what they play like,'' Culina said.\n\n''They've got to worry about us. When we last played them they didn't show us the respect and maybe rightly so because they were undefeated after three games.\n\n''This time around they'll be more aware of us so it'll be a harder task for us.''\n\n■North Queensland coach Ian Ferguson says negotiations are well under way to secure the services of young striker David Williams beyond this A-League season.\n\nFresh from Williams scoring the match-winner in the Fury's 1-0 home win over Perth Glory on Friday night, Ferguson said the north Queensland club had been looking into extending his one-year loan deal.\n\nWilliams, who is still contracted to Danish club FC Brondby, secured the points for the Fury by heading home a rebound in the 33rd minute at Dairy Farmers Stadium.\n\nFerguson was delighted for Williams to score his first goal at the club and was optimistic negotiations would soon be over.\n\n''I'm delighted for him,'' he said. ''He's worked ever so hard and tonight he has scored us a winner.\n\n''We are talking to him at this moment and we are hopefully very close to obviously announcing something but we need to wait first and foremost to make sure this boy is happy and if we can come to an agreement, we can get it done straight away.''\n\nWhen asked if his match-winner drove up his asking price for negotiations with the Fury, Williams made it clear he needed to score more goals. ''I think I've got to offer a bit more in that department but hopefully this is the start of something,'' he said.\n\nIn looking at his future, Williams emphasised the importance of being happy where he is playing football and spoke positively of his experience at the Fury.\n\n''I want to play where I'm happy,'' he said. ''The Fury are playing well. It's a good setup up here and I'm enjoying my time here. Obviously being on loan there's a lot to think about. Things are looking bright. As Fergy [Ferguson] said, we just have to discuss a few things and that's it. I just want to be where I'm happy and if I'm happy I'm playing good football.''\n\nWilliams expected an announcement regarding his future to be made in the next few weeks.\n\nThe Fury faces a run of away games with its next match against the Brisbane Roar on Wednesday.\n\n■Sydney FC thumped Canberra 3-0 to advance to its first W-League grand final at Toyota Stadium yesterday.\n\nThe Sydneysiders overcame the early dismissal of defender Alesha Clifford to claim home-ground advantage for the championship decider next weekend, when they will play the winner of today's semi-final between Central Coast and Brisbane Roar.\n\nLAST NIGHT(Corica 16 pen) at FMG Stadium. Referee: Michael Hester.\n\nWELLINGTON PHOENIX 0 SYDNEY FC 1\n\nTODAY\n\nNEWCASTLE JETS v GOLD COAST UNITED,\n\nAAP"
