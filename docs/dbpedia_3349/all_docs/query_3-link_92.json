        "text": "Newcastle Jets head coach Arthur Papas insists the sky is the limit for Archie Goodwin after the teenage sensation signed a new three-year contract.\n\nGoodwin, who graduated from Newcastle’s academy in the Under-9’s and has made an impact with the senior side, has pledged his future to the Jets.\n\nThe 17-year-old local product made eight appearances in the 2021-22 Isuzu UTE A-League season, scoring twice.\n\nGoodwin also scored in the 3-1 Australia Cup play-off victory over Perth Glory this month.\n\n“Archie has an energy about him and a confidence within,” Papas said. “The biggest thing – which is hard to teach – is that he knows where the back of the net is. That is his best attribute and that is the hardest to develop.\n\n“There are a lot of other things to work on. I see him being an important part of the team for sure.\n\n“I have had discussions with Archie around what the squad will look like. He will be in a position to earn a spot based on the way he trains and applies himself.”\n\nPapas added: “He has entered professional football at a really young age. A lot will be down to him and the attitude he has towards wanting to be a professional footballer at the highest level.\n\n“That is more than just what happen on the field. A lot of that is off the field.\n\n“How quickly he matures in that aspect and how he embraces the expectation that has build around him.\n\n“At this age, there is no ceiling on him.”\n\nGoodwin made his debut for the Jets in 2020-21, scoring once in eight games at McDonald Jones Stadium.\n\nIn Papas’ first season at the helm, Goodwin started just one of eight games but the exciting attacker bagged a memorable double against Sydney FC in his only start of the campaign.\n\n“It is fantastic to see a player who has been with our academy all the way through to now be a professional player in the A-League,” Jets executive chairman Shane Mattiske said.\n\n“We are a club that represents this region and we want players that represent the region in the club.\n\n“Archie is exactly that type of player and the ambition is to develop more young players.\n\n“He is a player we know all Newcastle Jets fans are excited about.\n\n“Developing talented young players from our own region is a core focus of the club moving forward.”"
