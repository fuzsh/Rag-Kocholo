        "text": "With the Newcastle Jets having wrapped up the title, all eyes turn to the all-important battle for second, with as many as four teams still in mathematical contention ahead of Round 28 of the 2024 Football NSW League Two Men’s season.\n\nThe Match of the Round this week sees third-placed Mounties Wanderers FC look to make up ground on second place when they host seventh placed Hurstville FC.\n\nSaturday, 10th August 2024\n\nMatch of the Round: Mounties Wanderers FC vs Hurstville FC, 5pm at Cook Park (Mt Pritchard)\n\nPrevious Meeting: Hurstville FC 1-3 Mounties Wanderers FC\n\nWith their promotion hopes having took a big hit in their last match, Mounties Wanderers FC will hope to close the gap to 2nd-placed Bankstown United FC when they take on a Hurstville FC side which would love to have their say on the promotion race.\n\nThe last time these two sides met, in the reverse fixture, Mounties came from behind to grab a 3-1 away win – with both teams looking to respond from losses, expect this match to be just as tight.\n\nMounties return following their bye last week and find themselves five points behind 2nd-placed Bankstown United FC, although Mounties do have a match in hand.\n\nThey will hope to regroup and put the pressure back on Bankstown, although they will be without Eijin Kishimoto after his red card in Mounties’ last match – expect the likes of Yuki Kanai and Nikola Todoroski to lead the line well for the attacking side.\n\nWith the second-best attack and second-best defence, statistically, in the league, expect Mounties to want to make amends for their back-to-back home defeats and potentially close the gap to Bankstown to two matches with a match in hand.\n\nHurstville, meanwhile, lost their first match in five matches after their 2-0 defeat away to Parramatta FC last week and will hope to also regroup to take on Mounties.\n\nThey will also be down a man this week after Juan Da Silva’s red card in their last match, but with the return of Paul Gagro will hope to add some firepower to their attack as they look to consolidate their spot on the ladder and avoid a possible two-place drop.\n\nExpect the Hurstville defence to also step up as they look to keep their first clean sheet in ten matches for a side which has matched it defensively among the top teams this season, as Hurstville look to have their say on the battle for the top two.\n\nWith both teams fighting for positions and with plenty of grit across the pitch, expect a tight match where individual moments may be the catalyst to blow it open.\n\nCentral Coast United FC vs Fraser Park FC, 5pm at Pluim Park\n\nPrevious Meeting: Fraser Park FC 4-0 Central Coast United FC\n\n6th-placed Central Coast United FC will be on the hunt for a fifth-straight win when they take on and 11th-placed Fraser Park FC hoping to end a five-match winless streak.\n\nFraser Park ran out 4-0 winners when these two teams met in the reverse fixture and will hope to channel their energy from that match into this one as they look to cause an upset.\n\nCentral Coast United doubled their wins from the first half of the season already in the second half of it after their 5-2 away win over Hawkesbury City FC last week gave them their 14th victory of 2024.\n\nTheir four-match winning streak has seen them close the gap to 5th-placed South Coast Flame FC to just one point, while the only sit five points behind 3rd-placed Mounties Wanderers FC as their resurgent second half of the season continues.\n\nExpect Central Coast to play with energy and tempo with and without the ball as they look to improve their league position come the end of the season – they can finish no lower than their current position of 6th on the ladder.\n\nFraser Park, meanwhile, came from behind to snatch a 1-1 draw away to Prospect United SC last week and will hope to end their five-match winless streak this week.\n\nThey will be without their goal scorer from that match in Francis Mcalpine after his red card last week but will hope to fill that void as they hunt down a win which could see them rise back into 10th on the ladder.\n\nExpect Fraser Park to focus on defence early and get a hold of the match as it progresses as they look to complete a big league double this season.\n\nWith Central Coast flying and Fraser Park hoping to have a positive end to the season, both sides will want to show their worth when they clash.\n\nHawkesbury City FC vs Parramatta FC, 5:30pm at David Bertenshaw Field\n\nPrevious Meeting: Parramatta FC 3-1 Hawkesbury City FC\n\nThe battle of the birds will reignite once again when 8th-placed Parramatta FC look to continue their strong run of form as they host 12th-placed Hawkesbury City FC.\n\nParramatta held off Hawkesbury for a 3-1 win the last time these two teams met, with both sides reduced to ten men in the fiery contest – expect this match to deliver just as much heat with both teams looking to finish the season strongly.\n\nHawkesbury had a 2-0 lead at home to Central Coast United FC last week before they went on to lose 5-2 and they will hope to learn from that match as they look to end a three-match winless run.\n\nWith a run of six matches over the past three weeks behind them, the Hawks will hope to be well rested as they look to make some progress up the ladder in the final weeks of the season.\n\nLook for the Hawks to want to hurt the Eagles with their pace and their proficiency up front – they have scored ten goals combined from their past four matches.\n\nParramatta, meanwhile, picked up a fourth win from their past five matches and recorded back-to-back clean sheets for the first time this season after their 2-0 home win over Hurstville FC last week and the Eagles will hope to continue that momentum to the end of the season.\n\nThe Eagles have scored for fun recently, with 12 goals from their past three matches combined, and suddenly find themselves in the running for a top-half finish this season.\n\nLook for them to press high and use their pace up front, as well as defend stoutly with their experience at the back, as they hunt for a win which could see them rise above Hurstville FC into 7th.\n\nWith both teams separated by just six points on the ladder, much can change before the end of the season for their respective league positions based on the result of this match and neither side will want to give away any cheap goals as they hunt down the three points.\n\nCamden Tigers FC vs South Coast Flame FC, 7pm at Ron Dine Memorial Reserve – Carbiz Stadium\n\nPrevious Meeting: South Coast Flame FC 2-0 Camden Tigers FC\n\nTwo teams who will be full on confidence after strong last-start wins will hope to grab another when 10th-placed Camden Tigers FC host 5th-placed South Coast Flame FC.\n\nThe Flame ran out 2-0 winners at home in the reverse fixture, with goals to Mitchell Turner and Michael Trajkovski, and they will hope to complete the league double over Camden when they travel to Sydney’s south-west.\n\nCamden have found their form with back-to-back wins for the second time this season following their 4-1 home win over Gladesville Ryde Magic last week and will hope to win three-straight matches for the first time this season on the weekend.\n\nThey have had multiple under-18’s and under-20’s players step up to play in recent weeks and that youthfulness has brought with it new energy which has led them to those two wins – expect them to want to exploit the Flame at the back with their pace up front.\n\nCamden will hope to attack with purpose as they look for a win which could help them get closer to the three sides above them on the ladder, while a loss could leave them open to dropping down to 12th.\n\nSouth Coast Flame, meanwhile, won their first match in three after they took down Granville Rage 5-2 at home last week and will look to end the season on a positive, with promotion all-but ruled out for them this season following Bankstown United FC’s strong form.\n\nThe Flame find themselves on the road for the rest of the season, where they have had mixed results, and they will hope to do their best to finish as high up the ladder as possible – look for them to want to use their power up front with the likes of Michael Trajkovski, who has 25 goals for the season, and punish the Tigers.\n\nA win for the Flame could see them close the gap to 3rd-placed Mounties Wanderers FC and 4th-placed Inner West Hawks FC to just one point if other results go their way and they will hope to put the pressure on those two sides, who are fighting for potential promotion, as the end of the season approaches.\n\nBoth teams managed to pick up wins against the other in their respective home matches last season and that trend continued in the reverse fixture – will the Tigers continue that trend, or will the Flame break it, with positions on the ladder at stake for both?\n\nGranville Rage vs Bankstown United FC, 7pm at Rydalmere Park\n\nPrevious Meeting: Bankstown United FC 4-1 Granville Rage\n\nWith pride on the line for 9th-placed Granville Rage and promotion-playoff hopes at stake for 2nd-placed Bankstown United FC, both sides will be fired up to deliver when they meet in Round 28.\n\nBankstown ran out 4-1 winners at home in the Round 13 reverse fixture and will hope to complete the league double when they travel to Granville to face the Rage.\n\nGranville Rage lost a third-straight match after their 5-2 defeat away to South Coast Flame FC last week and their tough run of fixtures continues this week against Bankstown, which will mean the Rage will have played four of the top five sides in the past month.\n\nThe Rage have added a few new faces recently and will hope to have the full complement of their starters back for this match as they look for a win which could see them return to the top half of the ladder in 7th.\n\nExpect the Rage to channel their double over Bankstown from last season into this performance as they look to have their say on the title race.\n\nBankstown, meanwhile, took a big step towards securing 2nd on the ladder after their 2-0 away win over Sydney University SFC in last week’s Match of the Round and will hope to win a fourth match from their past five to keep that momentum going.\n\nThey will be without Tyron Geany after his red card last week but with Mitchell Cross having bagged his 30th goal of the season to not only lead the league but all three men’s FNSW competitions this season, will be looking to continue their attacking mindset.\n\nA win for Bankstown would give them at least a two-point lead in 2nd ahead of their next match, but they will be taking it one match at a time and will hope to use their power up front to cause problems for the Rage early in this contest.\n\nAfter the Rage did the double over Bankstown last season, Bankstown have the chance to return the favour when the two teams clash at the weekend, with pride of the line for the Rage and potential promotion at stake for Bankstown.\n\nSunday, 11th August 2024\n\nNewcastle Jets vs Gladesville Ryde Magic, 5pm at Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility\n\nPrevious Meeting: Gladesville Ryde Magic 0-4 Newcastle Jets\n\nThe 2024 Premiers, the Newcastle Jets, will hope to take another step towards an unprecedented undefeated season after wrapping up the league title and promotion to the League One Men’s competition last week and host last-placed Gladesville Ryde Magic in their quest to do so.\n\nThe Jets ran out 4-0 winners in the reverse fixture this season and will hope to do the perfect league double for the second season in a row after their respective back-to-back 3-0 wins against the Magic last season.\n\nNewcastle celebrated their confirmed 1st-placed finish, League Two Men’s title for 2024 and their promotion to the League One Men’s competition for 2025 after their 5-3 comeback win at home over Inner West Hawks FC last week and will hope to go a 26th match without defeat this season when they host the Magic.\n\nWith the league wrapped up, the Jets will not step back in their intensity and will hope to take the match to the young Gladesville side early – expect them to test Gladesville defensively early in the hopes of a quickfire start.\n\nHunting a tenth-straight win in their bid for an unbeaten season, the Jets will look to add to their league-best goal tally of 79 goals (3.16 per match) when they host the Magic and also maintain their record as being the best defence in the competition with only 18 goals conceded (0.72 per match).\n\nGladesville Ryde Magic, meanwhile, fell to an eighth-straight loss after their 4-1 defeat away to Camden Tigers FC last week and will hope to play the ultimate spoiler to the Jets campaign in what would be the biggest upset of the season.\n\nThe Magic are on the opposite end with the least goals scored and most conceded so far this season but will hope to conjure up something special when they travel to the Hunter Region.\n\nA win for the Magic could take them out of last place ahead of 14th-placed Sydney University SFC and that will be added motivation for them to get the job done to the Premiers.\n\nWith the Premiers hosting the side bringing up the bottom of the ladder, there should be plenty of excitement in this match with the two young sides chasing their own goals this season, with history and pride at stake.\n\nSydney University SFC vs Prospect United SC, 5pm at Sydney University Football Ground\n\nPrevious Meeting: Prospect United SC 3-1 Sydney University SFC\n\n14th-placed Sydney University SFC will hope to take a big step forward in both their team’s progress and ladder position when they host the team immediately ahead of them on the ladder in 13th-placed Prospect United SC.\n\nProspect came from behind to claim a 3-1 home win over the students in the Match of the Round in the reverse fixture and will hope to complete the league double when the two sides meet.\n\nSydney University fell to a third-straight loss after their 2-0 home defeat to Bankstown United FC last week and will hope to grab a win which would take them a step closer to avoiding a last-placed finish this season when they host Prospect.\n\nThe students capitalised off a set piece in the reverse fixture in a match which saw many long balls utilised and the midfield nullified – they will hope to dictate play at home this time as they look to pick up the three points.\n\nWith many young players looking to play their way into the side and a willingness to learn late into the season, the students will want to make the match as difficult as they can for Prospect.\n\nProspect, meanwhile, fell to a sixth-straight match without a win after their 1-1 draw at home to Fraser Park FC last week and will hope to put an end to that streak to make up positions on the ladder late in the season.\n\nThe visitors will hope to continue to create chances and show more signs of improvement, which they will hope will bring with it confidence in their play.\n\nA win for Prospect could see them rise two spots to 11th on the ladder, while they cannot finish the season any lower than 13th.\n\nWith both sides looking to continue to improve late in the season, expect both teams to showcase their intent in the match early as they hunt down the win.\n\n4th-placed Inner West Hawks FC have a bye in Round 28."
