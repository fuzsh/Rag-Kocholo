        "text": "AFTER signing for Sydney FC yesterday, former Socceroo Jason Culina revealed he nearly walked away from the game last year.\n\nCulina signed a season-long deal with the Sky Blues to complete an 18-month comeback from a knee injury that threatened to end his playing career. The 32-year-old last played a professional match at the Asian Cup in January last year and was close to giving up hope of returning to the pitch due to the lengthy lay-off.\n\n''Twelve months ago, I was thinking about giving the game up because it was difficult,'' Culina said. ''I was going through difficult times, but a lot of people around me convinced me to keep going, not to give up, and I started to believe in myself again.''\n\nThe former PSV Eindhoven, Ajax and FC Twente midfielder spent the last four months training with Sydney FC and working with physio Stan Ivancic to regain fitness. He was rewarded yesterday with a contract. Culina said he began planning his retirement last year but made the decision to embark on the long road to recovery when he faced the prospect of life away from the field.\n\n''I had nothing, absolutely nothing else, that I could possibly go on and do but play football,'' Culina said. ''I've been a full-time professional since I was 16, so football is all I know. There were a lot of sleepless nights and days sitting around at home thinking about what I wanted to do, and everything that kept coming back to me was to get playing football again.''\n\nThis time last year, Culina was on crutches, frozen out of the Newcastle Jets squad and facing the possibility that his decorated career was about to slip from his grasp. Sydney FC threw him a lifeline and Culina has vowed to repay their faith.\n\n''Hopefully, [I'll] give back something to Sydney because they've shown the trust, they've given me this opportunity so, hopefully, I can be an asset to them,'' Culina said. ''Sydney FC is, for me, the biggest club in Australia and it's a great privilege to be a part of it.''\n\nHis signing came a day before Sydney FC's first home game of the season which is, coincidently, against his former club, Newcastle Jets. Culina and his father Branko were sacked by the Jets when the extent of his injury became known. The four-time Dutch Eredivisie champion said he would love to play a part in the fixture, but is still a few weeks away from returning to the field.\n\n''We will be assessing things week to week, day by day. I'd like to play tomorrow but that's just not going to happen,'' Culina said."
