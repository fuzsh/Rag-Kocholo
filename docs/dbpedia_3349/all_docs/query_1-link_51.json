        "text": "After overcoming one of the most difficult periods of his footballing career, James Brown is determined to fulfil his vast potential during his time at Melbourne City FC.\n\nFrom the AIS, Brown originally began his football career in the Tweed Heads region of N.S.W. Australia, with Bilambil F.C. and then Kingscliff Soccer Club, before moving on to play for Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast. After an Australia Selection at the Under 13 National Championships, Brown came through the ranks of the QAS, and was then signed by the AIS in 2007. Brown was later signed to a three year deal by Gold Coast United in December 2008.\n\nBrown made an impression on the A-League during his time on the Gold Coast, scoring his first senior goal in January 2010 during a 2-0 win over the Newcastle Jets at Skilled Park following a beautiful one-two with captain Jason Culina.\n\nFollowing an injury affected spell at the Newcastle Jets, on 20 May 2014 Melbourne City FC announced they had signed Brown ahead of the 2014/15 A-League season. The midfielder quickly endeared himself to the City faithful, scoring the decisive goal in the 1-0 away victory against Sydney FC at Allianz Stadium.\n\nHaving spent time in Australia’s youth development system at U17, U20 and U23 level, there is no question about Brown’s ability, and the 25-year-old is ready to make the most of his opportunities at Melbourne City FC."
