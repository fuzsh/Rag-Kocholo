        "text": "Season Previews- Newcastle Jets\n\nLast season: 7th\n\nThe Jets are one team who is truly flying under the radar this pre-season. They aren’t talking it up, signing big name marquees –although with Nathan Tinkler they could afford it-, they are just simply getting on with their business. For mine they could be a finals team if things break their way, but without Culina it just got tougher.\n\nNew Kit: ISC\n\nNewcastle haven’t officially released their new kit as of yet but the above picture from the Fox Sports player photos was posted onto a forum. To the best of my knowledge this blue and red kit will be their home kit, replacing the Gold from previous years, probably to go back to the former Newcastle NSL colours.\n\nCoach: Branko Culina\n\nBranko has always been an underrated coach for mine, and what he has done with the Jets since the mess Van Egmond left them in has been quiet impressive. Although some of his decisions can be a bit strange at times- like playing strikers at right mid, or even right back in young Brodie Mooy’s case.\n\nCaptain: Jobe Wheelhouse\n\nI have to think that Culina would have been the captain if he didn’t get injured, but the fact that Jobe is the captain is great news for the rest of the league, because it means a sub-par player will be starting every week.\n\nPossible starting 11\n\nFull squad: 1) Ben Kennedy, 2) Taylor Regan, 3) Mario Simic, 4) Nikolai Topor- Stanley, 5) Tiago, 6) Ben Kantarovski, 7) Kasey Wehrman, 8 ) Jeremy Brockie, 10) Ruben Zadkovich, Tarek Elrich, 12) Jobe Wheelhouse, 13) Byun Sung- Hwan, 14) Labinot Haliti, 15) Chris Payne, 16) Sam Gallaway, 17) James Virgili, 18 ) Marko Jesic, 19) Matthew Nash, 20) Jason Culina, 22) Ali Abbas, 23) Ryan Griffiths.\n\n*Foreigners in italics.\n\nTransfers In:\n\nMario Simic (Newcastle Jets Youth), Tiago (Fortuna Dusseldorf), Byun Sung Hwan (Sydney FC), Chris Payne (North Queensland Fury), Sam Gallaway (Newcastle Jets Youth), James Virgili (Newcastle Jets Youth), Jason Culina (Gold Coast United).\n\nJason Culina would have been their biggest signing, but since he is out for the season with that knee injury, the likes of Tiago, Byun and Chris Payne will be the biggest additions to the squad.\n\nTransfers Out:\n\nAdam D’Apuzzo (Released), Michael Bridges (Retired), Zhang Shou (Shenzhen Phoenix), Sasho Petrovski (South Coast Wolves), Sean Rooney (Released), Marcello Fiorentini (Released), Neil Young (Perth Glory), Brodie Mooy (Released), Kaz Patafta (Manly United).\n\nNot a lot of quality in that lot really, but Bridges will be missed by the Jets, his quality upfront. D’Apuzzo is a serviceable squad option due to his versatility, but the rest are really quiet ordinary. Also, I find it slightly humorous that former ‘golden kid’ Kaz Patafta is now out of the professional football circle. So much for him being our ‘next big thing’.\n\nKey In: Tiago\n\nI would have said Jason Culina, but since he won’t be playing at all this season, I will look elsewhere, and to the Brazilian defender. His partnership with Topor-Stanley should be interesting to watch, and it could be one of the best partnerships in the league.\n\nKey Out: Michael Bridges\n\nAs I said above, just about all the losses are squad players of no real significance, but Bridges loss will be felt by the Jets as he was their most proven centre forward and their best route to goal. A lot of pressure on Payne, Jesic and Griffiths to produce now.\n\nOne to Watch: Chris Payne\n\nThe kid was a standout last season for the underperforming Fury, now with a better squad of players around him, he should be able to shine and fulfil that potential that he has.\n\nStrengths: Width and versatility.\n\nThe Jets have defiantly stacked up on the wide positions this season, giving them one of the best corps’ of wide players in the league. Elrich, Zadkovich, Brockie, Simic, Virgili, Jesic, Griffiths, Byun and Abbas can all play in the wide areas giving Culina plenty of options. Add in players like Kantarovski who can play at CM/DM/CM and there’s any number of ways this team can line up.\n\nWeaknesses: Inexperience.\n\nWhile it is a good squad by A-League standards, it’s also a very young squad with not a lot of experience at the top level of the game. Regan, Gallaway, Virgili, Jesic, Simic and Payne all u/23 years of age, and their captain Wheelhouse is only 26 too.\n\nStadium: Ausgrid Stadium\n\nWhile it’s a decent stadium with a nice leagues club nearby, my worst memory in Roar football happened at the ground back in season 3, and that bus trip back with the Orange Army was the longest 8 hours ever.\n\nPreseason form: Played 10- Won 9, Drawn 1, Lost 0\n\nLooks to be a good preseason from the Jets, consistent results vs the local sides, good results agaisnt A-League teams and plenty of cleans sheets.\n\nNewcastle Jets 3-0 Hamilton Olympic\n\nNewcastle Jets 7-1 Weston Bears\n\nSoutherland Sharks 1-2 Newcastle Jets\n\nBonnyrigg White Eagles 0-3 Newcastle Jets\n\nBankstown 0-9 Newcastle Jets\n\nBroardmeadow Magic 0-3 Newcastle Jets\n\nNewcastle Jets 1-0 Melbourne Heart\n\nSouth Coast Wolves 0-0 Newcastle Jets\n\nRockdale 0-3 Newcastle Jets\n\nNewcastle Jets 3-0 NNSW Select X\n\nSeason Preview- Melbourne Heart\n\nLast season: 8th\n\nThis is a big season for Melbourne’s 2nd team, and for mine they have a good shout of making the finals for the 1st time. But with Kewell joining their cross-town rivals it will be even harder for them to get support in the stands.\n\nNew Kit: ISC\n\nI am a fan of the heart kit, it’s simple and stylish, in a similar mould to the old Southampton and Sunderland kits from England. Also I am a massive fan of the River Plate inspired alternate kit, and the idea of letting fans pick a 3rd kit design is a nice idea.\n\nCoach: John Van’t Schip\n\nBig big season for the Dutchman, who made some strange moves last season, like picking Matt Thompson and Dean Heffernan at CB, while Michael Beauchamp misses the squad altogether and club captain Simon Colosimo sits on the bench. If the doesn’t get it right this year\n\nfrom the start, it could be the end of the line for Van’t Schip.\n\nCaptain: Fred\n\nNot sure why they have changed their captain, surely it sends a bad message to former skipper Colosimo who is still in the squad. Maybe today’s rumors of Colosimo leaving are true? Or maybe Heart is trying to 1-up Victory by announcing their former star as the skipper? Either way, it’s an odd decision.\n\nPossible starting 11\n\nFull squad: 1) Clint Bolton, 2) Michael Marrone, 3) Brendan Hamill, 4) Simon Colosimo, 5) Fred, 6) Matt Thompson, 7) Rutger Worm,\n\n8 ) Kristian Sarkies, 9) Maycon, 10 ) Wayne Srhoj, 11) Alex Terra, 13) Jonathan Germano, 14) Kamal Ibrahim, 15) David Williams, 16) Aziz Behich, 17) Jason Hoffman, 18 ) Curtis Good, 19) Eli Babalj, 20) Adrian Zahra, 21) Kliment Taseski, 22) Nick Kalmar, 23) Mate Dugandzic, 24) Nikola Roganovic.\n\n*Foreigners in italics.\n\nTransfers In\n\nMate Dugandzic (Melbourne Victory), Curtis Good (Australian Institute of Sport), Fred (D.C. United), David Williams (North Queensland Fury- via Sydney FC), Maycon (Nova Iguacu), Jonathan Germano (Estudiantes) Nikola Roganovic (Green Gully).\n\nA lot of exciting quick attacking players have been added to the group, which should make them an exciting team to watch grow and develop. Duganzic and Williams inparticular will be exciting to watch if they get a regular opportunity to show their talents. Maycon is a bit of an x-factor but by all reports he’s a nippy striker and will add to their squad.\n\nTransfers Out:\n\nJohn Aloisi (Retired), Josip Skoko (Retired), Ante Tomic (Sydney United), Peter Zois (Oakleigh), Gerald Sibon (SC Heerenveen), Dean Heffernan (Perth Glory), Michael Beauchamp (Sydney FC)\n\nWhile the ins may be young and exciting, the outs are elderly veterans who’s experience will be greatly missed. But for mine it is the losses of Beauchamp and Heffernan that will be felt more. Aloisi and Skoko have moved into the clubs coaching ranks and their ability to pass on their experiences to the younger players will be a big benefit for the Heart.\n\nKey In: Fred\n\nThe start of the 2nd season with Melbourne Victory is back, this time with the Heart and should have a big impact on them and the league. The fact that they named him captain must mean that the consider him the key player in the side.\n\nKey Out: Michael Beauchamp\n\nHearts squad already lacked central defensive options so to let Beauchamp walk while under contract is a very strange call indeed. A lot of pressure is now going to be placed on youngsters Brendan Hamill and Curtis Good. Either that or they can waste play Matt Thompson there\n\nagain.\n\nOne to Watch: Brendan Hamill\n\nCould have gone for a few players here like Eli Babalj, Aziz Behich Kamal Ibrahim, Curtis Good, Nick Kalmar, David Williams or even Mate Dugandzic, but for mine the young defender –if he gets a chance- will be a real star at the back for the Heart. Played a part in Australia’s unsuccessful u/20 World Cup campaign.\n\nStrengths: Youth and speed in attack\n\nWith the likes of Williams, Maycon, Terra, Worm, Germano, Fred, Ibrahim and Dugandzic, they certainly have more than enough quick attacking options to hurt opposition sides, especially on the counter attack.\n\nWeaknesses: Defense\n\nDon’t get me wrong, a back 4 of Marrone-Colosimo-Hamill- Behich is fine and solid for this level, but given that Thompson will more than likely start there it’s a problem. With only Curtis Good in the squad as a natural defensive option they are defiantly short of options.\n\nStadium: Aami Park\n\nUnfortunately I haven’t had a chance to catch a game at the new Melbourne stadium as of yet, but hopefully that will change this season. From all reports thou its definatly a fantastic place to watch the football at.\n\nPreseason form: Played 15- Won 9, Drawn 4, Lost 2\n\nThey have certainly played a lot of games in preseason, a very similar amount of games to the roar actually. Btw, they have already played Northcote City twice, and will apparently play them again for a 3rd time this weekend.\n\nMelbourne Heart 6-2 Northcote City\n\nPascoe Vale 2-2 Melbourne Heart\n\nBallarat Red Devils 0-0 Melbourne Heart\n\nGreen Gully 1-0 Melbourne Heart\n\nGeelong XI 1-6 Melbourne Heart\n\nPort Melbourne 2-2 Melbourne Heart\n\nLa Trobe University 1-11 Melbourne Heart\n\nVCL All Stars 0-6 Melbourne Heart\n\nAlbury- Wodonga XI 0-3 Melbourne Heart\n\nMelbourne Knights 1-2 Melbourne Heart\n\nMelbourne Heart 0-1 Newcastle Jets\n\nMelbourne Heart 2-2 Wellington Phoenix\n\nSpringvale White Eagles 0-7 Melbourne Heart\n\nMelbourne 2-1 Northcote City\n\nPeninsula Select 0-1 Melbourne Heart\n\nSeason Preview- Sydney FC\n\nLast season: 9th\n\nIt was a poor season last year for Sydney who suffered a classic case of a “grand final hangover” in the 1st half of the season, although they did finish the season slightly better, unbeaten in their last 8 games or something. The ACL experience may not have seen them get out of their group but im sure they’ll build on it.\n\nNew Kit: Adidas\n\nVery nice kit actually with the pinstripes, perhaps the sky blue is a bit too bright for my liking but its not that bad. I’ll bet that Reddy is delighted with having to wear a lime green top thou. Also its very strange that the team in the biggest city in Australia cant attract any sponsors for their kit, either on shirt or shorts, kinda makes a mockery of their claim that Sydney is “Footballs Capital”.\n\nCoach: Viteslav Lavicka\n\nThe Czech had a dream 1st season, but his reputation took a hit last season by missing the finals and not getting out of the ACL group, but in a good move by the Sydney board, they have stuck by him for the sake of stabilitiy. However if this season starts heading south like last season, they may be forced into action yet again at a club which if history serves correct is not affraid of sacking coaches early in a season. Just ask Branco Culina.\n\nCaptain: Terry McFlynn\n\nThe Sydney captain wasnt at his best in the last campaign, but the foundation player from Northern Ireland has shown that he is more than capeable of playing at this level and having an impact on the game. Alot more will be expected, and he should be able to deliver.\n\nPossible starting 11\n\nFull squad: 1) Liam Reddy, 2) Sebastian Ryall, 3) Jamie Coyne, 4) Pascal Bosschart, 5) Michael Beauchamp, 6) Hirofumi Moriyasu, 7) Brett Emerton, 8 ) Karol Kisel, 9) Bruno Cazarine, 10) Nick Carle, 11 )D Dimitri Petratos, 12) Shannon Cole, 15) Terry McFlynn, 16) Joel chianese, 17) Terry Antonis, 1 8 ) Juho Makela, 19) Mark Bridge, 20) Ivan Necevski, 21) Scott Jamieson, 22) Nathan Sherlock, 23) Rhyan Grant.\n\n* foriegners in italics.\n\nTransfers In: Karol Kisel (Slavia Prague), Jamie Coyne (Perth Gloy), Michael Beauchamp (Melbourne Heart), Joel Chianese (Sydney FC Youth), Nathan Sherlock (Sydney FC Youth), Pascal Bossschart (ADO Den Hag), Brett Emerton (Blackburn Rovers)\n\nObviously Emerton is the biggest in and to us football fans in Australia he needs absolutly no introduction, but the signings of Beauchamp, Kisel and Bosschart will also be important to any success they could have. A defensive pairing of Beuachamp and Bosschart could be a very handy pairng indeed and stop the leaks in defence from last year.\n\nTransfers Out: Matthew Jurman (Brisbane Roar FC)m Byun Sung-Hwan (Newcastle Jets), Stephan Keller (Willem II), Stuart Musialik (Central Coast Mariners), Kofi Danning (Brisbane Roar FC), Brendan Gan (Bonnyrigg White Eagles), Anthony Golec (Sydney United)\n\nA number of their 2010 championship winning squad have departed with Byun, Gan, Keller and Musialik all playing a part in that success. Of those 4 it will be Musialik who will be missed the most, but the duo signed by Ange Postecoglou would be the biggest losses of them.\n\nKey In: Brett Emerton\n\nWhile Harry Kewell and Melbourne Victory have been getting all of the media attention for their returining socceroo, for mine it will be Emerton who will have the bigger impact on the games. Coming straight from the EPL, and being only the 3rd player in history to do so – after Dwight Yorke and Craig Moore- Emerton will surely bring alot of class from that level to Sydney’s play.\n\nKey Out: Matthew Jurman\n\nNo, im not being bias here, I really think that the young Jurman is the loss that Sydney will feel the most. For starters they dont have alot of youth and they criminally ignored Jurman last season until it was too late and for mine he’s set for a big season.\n\nOne to Watch: Terry Antonis\n\nThe young midfielder impressed with sporadic gametime last season and should be in line for more in this. Wanted by Everton at age 16, big things are expected from the young attacking midfielder.\n\nStrenghts: The front third\n\nAny time you can combine the talents of Emerton, Carle, Cazarine, Makela and Bridge you should have more than enough options to score the required goals. Add in youngesters Antonis and Petratos and Sydney should be potent enough going foward, at the back however…\n\nWeaknesses: Goalkeeping\n\nNeither Reddy or Necevski flattered to decieve last season with both getting their opportunity, and neither taking it, so Lavicka will be probably unconvinced about either option. Also- we up here know only too well how poorly Reddy plays when is heart isnt in it.\n\nStadium: Sydney Football Stadium\n\nSuch a pain to get to really with no public transport close to it, but as a stadium its not a bad place to watch the football, just a shame that we havent had alot of success against them there over the years.\n\nPreseason form: Played 8- Won 3, Drawn 2, Lost 3\n\nThey started out alright, but no wins in the last 4 games in preseason isnt the greatest way to be going into the season. Also, call me a hater of the lower leagues if you will, but fulltime professional A-League players and squads should be beating semi-professional lower league sides every day of the week so losing 2 games against that calibure of opposition isnt the best sign.\n\nMacarthur Rams 1-1 Sydney FC\n\nSt George FC 0-3 Sydney FC\n\nParamatta Eagles 0-6 Sydney FC\n\nBankstown City 2-4 Sydney FC\n\nSutherland Sharks 3-0 Sydney FC\n\nSydney Olympic 1-0 Sydney FC\n\nNewcastle Jets 1-0 Sydney FC\n\nSydney FC 2-2 Perth Glory\n\nSeason Preview- Perth Glory\n\nLast Season: 10th\n\nIt’s a big season for the folks out west, with the club celebrating their 15th season in professional football, which offcourse goes back to the old NSL days. Sadly for them thou they have not had anywhere near the success of those days in the A-League and are now onto their 5th coach who has big pressure to at least make the finals.\n\nNew Kit: X-Blades\n\nBoth of Perth’s kits look simply and fine, the biggest surprise is probably that they have gone away from a predominantly purple home kit, with\n\nwhite coming in. Btw how did FFA let glory get away with a predominantly white home kit and a white away kit…crazy.\n\nCoach: Ian Ferguson\n\nIt is a very big year for Fergie, having come in midway through last season he is this year exepcted to challenge for the top places on the table, and at the very least secure Perth its 2nd final series appearence. If he fails to do so, or starts slowly he may very well go the same way as David Mitchell, Ron Smith, Alan Vest and Steve McMahon.\n\nCaptain: Jacob Burns.\n\nWith Kevin Muscat retiring Burns is now officially the biggest hack in the league, how he can be a captain (and probably a starting 11 player) is mistifying. Absurd.\n\nPossible starting 11.\n\nFull Squad: 1) Danny Vukovic, 2) Josh Mitchell, 3) Bas van den Brink, 4) Billy Mehmet, 6) Chris Coyne, 7) Jacob Burns, 8 ) Adam Hughes, 9) Shane Smeltz, 10) Liam Miller, 11) Viktor Sikora, 12) Scott Neville, 13) Travis Dodd, 14) Steven McGarry, 15) Tommy Amphlett, 16) Evan Berger, 17) Todd Howarth, 18) Jesse Makarounas, 19) Joshua Risdon, 20) Neil Young, 21) Mile Sterjovski, 22) Adam Taggart, 23) Andrezinho (On Loan- Injury Replacement for Viktor Sikora)\n\n* foriegners in italics.\n\nPerth have got some real depth in their squad this season with Coach Ferguson quoted as saying “Im trying to get 2 good players for every position”. Has he done that, well you be the judge but the squad definatly looks alot strong this season than any time in the past. Liam Miller and Shane Smeltz will be the key factors in any success they have.\n\nTransfers In: Evan Berger (Melbourne Victory), Travis Dodd (Adelaide United), Dean Heffernan (Melbourne Heart), Neil Young (Newcastle\n\nUnited Jets), Danny Vukovic (Wellington Phoenix), Shane Smeltz (Gold Coast United), Adam Hughes (Adelaide United), Jesse Makarounas (Australian Institute of Sport), Liam Miller (Hibernian), Bas van den Brink (Busan I’ Park) Andrezinho (Consadole Sapporo-Loan), Billy Mehmet (Samsunspor)\n\nThere are some very good signings amongst this lot for Perth, starting ofcourse with goalscoring sensation Shane Smeltz who should continue t bang them away. Andrezinho, Dodd and Miller will add some creativity and width to a midfield that for mine was industrious at best last season.\n\nTransfers Out: Dean Heffernan (Liaoning Whowin), Andrija Jukic (Bogor Raya FC), Howard Fondyke (Released), Naum Sekulovski (Released), Brent Griffiths (Stirling Lions), Anthony Skorich (Released), Jamie Coyne (Sydney FC), Andy Todd (Oldham Athletic), Michael Baird (Central Coast Mariners), Aleks Vrteski (Solo FC), Adriano Pellegrino (Central Coast Mariners), Robbie Fowler (Muangthong United) Branko Jelic (Released).\n\nThe loss of Heffernan- if you can really call it a loss given he never showed up-, Todd and Fowler are the only players of note that Perth have let go this offseason. In the past you could say they got their retention strategies wrong but by getting rid of Coyne, Sekulovski, Barid and Jelic they have gotten stronger.\n\nKey In: Shane Smeltz\n\nI could have gone for Liam Miller here, but really Smeltz is the most important signing the club have made, becuase without him the side lacks genuine proven goalscorers at this level and for them to have any success this season he must stay fit and produce his form from his Wellington and Gold Coast days.\n\nKey Out: Robbie Fowler\n\nFowler is obviously a massive loss, both on and off the park with his ability and ofcourse the commerical and sponsorship opportunities that he brings. For mine Perth will feel his loss more off the park than on thou because with Smeltz coming in you have an able on field replacement.\n\nOne to watch: Jesse Makarounas\n\nOne of the stars from the recent U/18 Fifa World Cup in Mexico, Makarounas definatly has a bright future, and if he gets a chance this season he could make a big impact. It is likely however that you will probably only see they youngster in the youth league.\n\nStrenghts: Depth and midfield.\n\nPerth now have some fantastic depth in their squad with proven A-League performers on the bench or maybe even out of the side altogether. This depth is strongest in midfield with Dodd and Sterjovski options at RM, Van den Brink, Miller, Burns and Hughes fighting for 2 CM slots and Andrezinho and Howarth options at LM. Not a bad midfield at all.\n\nWeaknesses: Coaching.\n\nWith a strong playing group, there is bound to be a lot of pressure on manager Ian Ferguson to produce and as mentioned above, if he doesnt get it right he could be gone\n\nStadium: Nib Stadium.\n\nOne of my favourite grounds to visit, its quet a nice little ground to watch the football at, just a shame its such a long flight to get there.\n\nPreseason form: Played 10: Won 5, Lost 4, Drawn 1.\n\nPerth have had a good preseaosn on the surface of it with impressive results agaisnt local sides, a tour to South Africa and a game against Celtic\n\nPerth Glory 3-1 Bunbury Force\n\nPerth Glory 9-4 WA State Team\n\nPerth Glory 0-2 Celtic\n\nPerth Glory 0-1 Platinum Stars\n\nPerth Glory 3-1 AmaZulu\n\nPerth Gloy 1-1 Al Ahli\n\nPerth Glory 2-0 Stirling Lions\n\nPerth Glory 6-1Balcatta\n\nCentral Coast Mariners 1-0 Perth Glory\n\nSydney FC (Carle, Emerton) 2-2 Perth Glory (Mehmet, Howarth)\n\n2011/2012 Westfield W-League Draw\n\n*home games in bold\n\n*times listed are local time\n\nWeek 1: Saturday, October 22, 2011 Sydney FC Brisbane Roar Leichhardt Oval 3:00pm (BROADCAST ON ABC1 AT 4.00PM)\n\nWeeks 2: Bye\n\nWeek 3: Saturday, November 05, 2011 Brisbane Roar Newcastle Jets Cleveland Showgrounds, Cleveland 4:00pm\n\nWeek 4: Saturday, November 12, 2011 Adelaide United Brisbane Roar Burton Park 4:00pm\n\nWeek 5: Saturday, November 19, 2011 Perth Glory Brisbane Roar 6PR Stadium, Inglewood 4:00pm\n\nWeek 6: Saturday, November 26, 2011 Brisbane Roar Melbourne Victory Suncorp Stadium 4:00pm\n\nWeek 7: Saturday, December 03, 2011 Brisbane Roar Canberra United Cleveland Showgrounds, Cleveland 3:00pm\n\nWeek 8: Saturday, December 10, 2011 Brisbane Roar Adelaide United Stockland Park, Sunshine Coast 2:00pm (BROADCAST ON ABC1 AT 4.00PM)\n\nWeek 9: Saturday, December 17, 2011 Melbourne Victory Brisbane Roar Skilled Stadium, Geelong 3:00pm (BROADCAST ON ABC1 AT 4.00PM)Week 10: Bye\n\nWeek 11: Saturday, January 07, 2012 Newcastle Jets Brisbane Roar Adamstown Oval 3:00pm\n\nSaturday, January 14, 2012 Brisbane Roar Sydney FC Queensland Sports & Athletics Centre, Nathan (QSAC) 2:00pm (BROADCAST ON ABC1 AT 4.00PM)\n\nFinals Series Information\n\nSemi Finals (1v4) (2v3) Weekend of January 21/22\n\nGrand Final (winner of SF1 vs winner of SF2)- January 28\n\n* all finals games shown on ABC1.\n\nCompetiton History.\n\n2008/2009\n\nPremiers: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nChampions Brisbane Roar FC (2-0 over Canberra United)\n\n2009/2010\n\nPremiers: Sydney FC\n\nChampions: Sydney FC (2-1 over Brisbane Roar FC\n\n2010/2011\n\nPremiers: Sydney FC\n\nChampions: Brisbane Roar FC (2-1 over Sydney FC)\n\nWhere are they now- Strikers edition\n\nWhile we wait for season 7 to begin, we look back at the previous 6 and the players who have played for Brisbane- today, part 6, the strikers.\n\nName: Alex Brosque (2005-2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 21\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 8\n\nCurrent club: Shimizu S-Pulse (24) (6)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Sydney FC (104) (30)\n\nWe all love to hate Brosque due to his decision to leave and head to Sydney, but to be fair to him has kicked on in his career and became a\n\nregular goal scorer in the A-League before his move to Japan. Best of luck to him I guess, but for Roar supporters he will be remembered for the way he left the club.\n\nName: Royce Brownlie (2005-2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 10\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: Peninsula Power\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Swindon Town (15) (2), Chester City (4), Wellington Phoenix (8)\n\nBig ‘Rolls’ Royce was never much of a striker really, and was once of those Queensland Lions signings from the inaugural season. 2 goals in 10 meant he was shown the door.\n\nName: Reece Tollenaere (2005-2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 3\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Brisbane Strikers, Eastern Suburbs\n\nSigned from Queensland Lions and probably the only reason he got a deal was so they could say they are bringing players up from Lions to\n\nRoar. Offered absolutely nothing at all in the 3 games he played.\n\nName: Jonti Richter\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 17\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 1\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Strikers\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: New Zealand Knights (18) (0), Tamworth\n\nAnother local league signing by Miron, and another failure sadly, although Richter did show promise with his speed, he just didn’t have\n\nthe necessary finishing to cut it at this level.\n\nName: Michael Baird (2005-2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 20\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 6\n\nCurrent club: Central Coast Mariners (2)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Universitatea Craiova (67) (12), Perth Glory (13) (1)\n\nAh good ol’ Bairdy. Started out like a house on fire but was inconsistent from then on out, but he did score in the 1st ever game so quods to him for that. Can’t really fault him for taking an offer from Europe either really.\n\nName: David Williams (2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 2\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Melbourne Heart (0) (0)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Brondby (34) (4), North Queensland Fury (49) (8), Sydney FC (6) (0)\n\nI think I was overseas at the time young David got his chance with the roar because I don’t remember his 2 games for the club, but he’s certainly kicked on and made a good career for himself.\n\nName: Reinaldo (2006-2008), (2008-2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 92\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 32\n\nCurrent club: Al Ahli (Doha)\n\nCriticized by many roar fans for being inconsistent and incapable of scoring goals, the big Brazilian ended up getting a goal every 3 games on average in his 5 season stat with the club. He offered a lot more to the forward line than just goals often being the striker who worked hard to\n\nmake space for others. His semi final goal vs. Sydney will never be forgotten by those who were there, unbelievable strike making Milligan and Bolton look like total fools.\n\nName: Simon Lynch (2006-2008)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 36\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 5\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since\n\nBRFC: Airdrie United (33) (10), East Stirling (34) (13), Stenhousemuir (17) (4)\n\nLynch was always a forward I had a fair amount of time for, and did very well under Bleiberg, which makes him probably the only forward he\n\nsigned that did produce. But Lynch was frozen out when Farina brought in Mori and then latterly changed the system to just 1 central striker, but I always thought that the big guy would get a goal.\n\nName: Ante Milicic (2006-2008)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 44\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 11\n\nCurrent club: Melbourne Heart (Assistant Coach)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Shahzan Mazda FC, Sydney United\n\nAnother of Mirons ‘big name’ signings in the 2nd season designed to deliver Queensland to the finals, but as we all know Milicic was a massive flop in his 2 years here and was quoted as saying “It wasn’t quite happening for me at Queensland Roar.“…no kidding.\n\nName: Zhang Yuning (2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 6\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Liaoning\n\nWhere to start? What a complete failure of a signing, turned up overweight and smoking a pack a day, then runs off home for his wedding mid\n\nseason, probably the 6 least memorable appearances in a Roar shirt.\n\nName: Damian Mori (2007)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 8\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: Adelaide City (Manager)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Adelaide City (37) (22),\n\nMori may have only got 2 goals in 8 games, but he looked far more likely to score that season that Milicic and Reinaldo who was down on\n\nconfidence. His goal in the last round against Sydney in 2007 was very clinical.\n\nName: Robbie Kruse (2007- 2009)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 28\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 4\n\nCurrent club: Fortuna Dusseldorf (6)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Melbourne Victory (39) (18)\n\nThe one that got away? He may have been a lot of things, but above all else the kid could play, and now he’s doing it in Europe and for Australia. Really burst onto the scene that 1st season and looked our most likely goal scorer a lot of the time. Shame that those off field problems and incidents meant that he had to leave, although I don’t think he’s too popular with the folks in the den after his celebration last season.\n\nName: Tahj Minnieccon (2007- 2009)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 24\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 4\n\nCurrent club: Gold Coast United (35) (2)\n\nThe 1st player to cross directly to GCU, and hasn’t he gone down hill since then. The young winger/striker we saw terrorising defenders in 2008 in orange has turned into an overweight benchwarmer. Such great talent, shame to see him waste it al, wonder if he would like that decision to head to Robina back?\n\nName: Zoran Petrevski (2008)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 0\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Unknown\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Hume City\n\nWas signed as a replacement for Ante Milicic when he left for Malaysia but never got the chance to play a game unfortunately, but that’s what happens I guess when you have Kruse, Zullo, Tahj, Reinaldo and Lynch performing in the 1st team already.\n\nName: Tim Smits (2008-2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 14\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Rochedale Rovers\n\nLocal league legend Tim Smits may have been (and still is) banging the goals in for Rochedale in the BPL, but his tenure in orange was much more notable for the fact that he couldn’t find the net at all. Rochedale fans will tell you that the system didn’t suit him and that he didn’t get\n\nenough chances, but as a striker if your not scoring, your not playing.\n\nName: Sergio Van Djik\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 50\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 25\n\nCurrent club: Adelaide United\n\nBig Sergio started out very slowly with only 1 goal in 10 to start the season, but boy oh boy did he come home with a wet sail. Ange said when he arrived that he was desperate for him to say and he is priority no.1, but sadly he was also a high priority for Sydney and Adelaide which is where he now plays. But Sergio does hold the top scorer in Q/BRFC history tag with 25 goals to Reinaldos 24.\n\nName: Henrique Silva (2009- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 32\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 6\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nGrand final hero with the penalty, but in truth he’s been a hero since he 1st arrived. Came into a semi-final match at home after barely a week of training and looked completely and home, and he’s been carving up ever since. I also love his ‘I love you Brisbane’ goal celebrations last season after the floods, awesome.\n\nName: Kosta Barbarouses (2010-2011)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 33\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 12\n\nCurrent club: Alania Vladikavkaz (4) (2)\n\nThe biggest surprise to come out of last season was seeing a player who couldn’t get a game in NZ come across the Tasman and be a standout for us. I cant pick out just one single game where he performed excellently because he was consistently productive all year. Having said that his goal vs. Adelaide where DeVere made the Beckenbauer esque run was absolutely superb.\n\nName: Jean Carlos Solórzano (2010- 2011)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 25\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 11\n\nCurrent club: Melbourne Victory\n\nProbably the most lethal finisher the club has signed, I certainly had big question marks over JCS as well when he arrived due to his injuries, but his 2nd half of the season was superb. His 10 minute double against Gosford in that 5-0 or 5-1 mauling was clinical.\n\n2011/12 National Youth League draw released\n\nThis is just the Brisbane fixture list, head to the A-League website for the rest if you’re keen.\n\n*Home games in bold.\n\nWeek 1: Saturday October 22: Brisbane Roar FC vs Gold Coast United: 5.00 PM Cleveland Showgrounds, Cleveland.\n\nWeek 2: Saturday October 29: Brisbane Roar FC vs Adelaide United FC. 4.00 PM.

Its also fantastic to see that 1 game is schedueled for Suncorp Stadium before an A-League match like they were in the initial year of the competition. Good to have the home derby so soon, but the timing of the away derby is once again disappointing, idk why it is but those clowns down at GCU dont seem to realise they might actually get a decent ammount of Brisbane fans (and money assuming they still charge $15 entry to their youth games) coming down the M1 for the game if it was on a weekend and not a Friday afternoon. Bah GCU, you incompetant fools. So get on down to Cleveland or if you are travelling to an away game, why not try and comine a youth fixture aswell.\n\nThe other interesting thing is aparently there will be no finals series or grand final associated with the NYL this season, just a 1st past the post trophy which is interesting, perhaps they are testing the idea out before bringing it into the A-League? For a quick reminder heres the past champions of the NYL.\n\n2008/2009:\n\nPremiers: Sydney FC. 41 pts.\n\nChampions: Sydney FC (Adelaide United 0-2 Sydney FC)\n\nTop Scorer: Francesco Monterosso (Adelaide- 13 goals)\n\nPlayer of the Year: Adam Sarota (Queensland Roar)\n\nBrisbane: 1o W, 5D, 3L. 33pts. 3rd (Place)\n\nBrisbane top scorer: Chris Grossman (11 goals)\n\n2009/2010\n\nPremiers: Central Coast Mariners\n\nChampions: Gold Coast United (Perth Glory 1-2 Gold Coast United)\n\nTop Scorer: Francesco Monterosso (Adelaide- 17 goals)\n\nPlayer of the Year: Panni Nikas (Central Coast)\n\nBrisbane: 5W, 5D, 14L, 20pts (8th Place)\n\nBrisbane top scorer: Tim Smits (9 goals)\n\n2010/2011\n\nPremiers: Gold Coast United\n\nChampions: Gold Coast United\n\nTop Scorer: Bernie Ibini Esei (Central Coast)\n\nPlayer of the Year: Steve Lustica (Gold Coast)\n\nBrisbane: 6W, 3D, 4 L. 21 pts (2nd place)\n\nBrisbane top scorer: James Meyer (6 goals)\n\nRoar round out Pre-Season with victory over UQ.\n\nMeyer scores (x3): Brisbane opened the scoring very early on with some confusing amongst the UQ defence with Kofi Danning playing in James Meyer to calmly slot it home from close range to make it 1-0. He quickly added another 2 goals to make it 3-0 after half an hour to round out a superb show of finishing from the local product.\n\nKids impress: It was a very young Brisbane side, but I was impressed with their performance especially in the 1st half with the system looking identical to that of the 1st team, which is the biggest compliment you could pay them really. Yes, they train with the 1st team reguarly but they looked at ease on the ball and were every bit as impressive as the few senior players on show.\n\nBratten injuiry concern: The 1 slight concern for the coaching staff from the game was probably the knock picked up by Luke Bratten after about half an hour. The young midfielder- who played in the Erik Paartalu role- picked up a knock and went down immediatly and was substituted for Kenneth Dougall. Hopefully its nothing serious because he will be needed this season with all of the Olyroo callups, + there is a spot at cm open with the departure of McKay.\n\nDominance of Possesion: I dont have the exact stats, but the possesion counter must have been 80-20 (75-25 at the very least) because Brisbane absolutly dominated possession with the 3 midfielders having a key role in this, with Bush and Lambadaridis always making themselves avaliable for a pass. In addition the 2 cb’s were very assured on the ball and had no problem playing out from the back, quiet impressive really. The concern would be that with that much possession (especially 2nd half) you should be creating more chances and taking them, which didnt really happen. “Roarcelona” seemed to become “Roarsenal” today because they seemed to be trying to walk it in at times.\n\nUp next: Next up for the Roar is 2 weeks of training before the opening game of the regular season against the Central Coast Mariners on October 8. In the meantime I guess there is the annual family fun day which is always a bit of fun. That is next Sunday, at Ballymore stadium.\n\nWhere are they now- Attacking midfielders edition\n\nWhile we wait for season 7 to begin, we look back at the previous 6 and the players who have played for Brisbane- today, part 5, the attacking midfielders.\n\nName: Shin Tae-Yong (2005\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 1\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma- Manager\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Brisbane Roar (Assistant Manager)\n\nUnfortunately only played the 1 game before getting a long term knee injury that forced him to retire, but such was the belief that\n\nBleiberg had in him, he kept him around as part of his coaching staff. Shin has gone on to bigger and better things as a coach, including winning the ACL with his former club Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma.\n\nName: Osvaldo Carro (2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 9\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Plaza Colonia\n\nFailure. Nothing else to say here, really, can’t even dress it up a little bit, added nothing at all.\n\nName: Marcus Wedau (2006-2007)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 10\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: KFC Uerdingen 05 (11) (1)\n\nThe man Miron signed to be the creative link in the midfield, and in a few ways he resembles the 2nd season on the whole: good start, but faded away. Didn’t really get a look in when Farina left and was replaced by the equally ineffective Marcinho.\n\nName: Dario Vidosic (2006- 2007)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 17\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 5\n\nCurrent club: Adelaide United (0)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: FC Nurnberg (30) (3), MSV Duisburg- Loan (12) (1), Armenia Bielefeld (14) (1)\n\nThe son of Rado burst onto the scene making an impact off the bench in his 1st ever a-league game against Perth in the 2nd season, scoring 1 and setting another up in a 3-0 win. From there he went from strength to strength and was probably the most impressive player in that 2nd season.\n\nName: Márcio Luiz Adurens- aka Marcinho (2007- 2008)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 22\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 3\n\nCurrent club: Unknown\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: CFZ do Rio, América Futebol Clube, Diagoras FC\n\nAh Mr Marcinho, my most vivid memory of you is your miss from 3 yards out against Newcastle in the preliminary final, where you managed\n\nto get it over the bar from 3 yards…bravo, a top effort that. Combine that and your over hit corners and free-kicks and you won’t be missed.\n\nName: Michael Zullo (2007-2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 53\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: FC Utrecht\n\nOther clubs since BRFC:\n\nReally burst onto the scene back in year 3, and his goal in front of the home end against Wellington will live long in the memory. Was a consistent performer in his time here, but probably should have scored more goals than he did.\n\nName: Mitch Nichols (2007- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 75\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 12\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nInconsistent. But when he is on, he has a massive impact, like he did in the run in to the finals in the 4th season. But when he is cold, he’s ice cold, like the poor season in 2009/10. Defiantly has the quality thou, just does he want to use it?\n\nName: Tommy Oar (2008-2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 26\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: FC Utrecht\n\nOther clubs since BRFC:\n\nBest product to come from the youth team? Absolutely. The kid was outstanding, right from his debut, his last min free-kick against Wellington and the following season of domination down the left flank. We all know he’s going places fast, hopefully he can make it to the very top.\n\nName: Isaka Cernak (2008- 2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 15\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 1\n\nCurrent club: Melbourne Victory (0)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: North Queensland Fury (14) (1)\n\nThe lanky midfielder never really got much of a chance to show what he had to offer despite being on the roster for 3 seasons. Ironically, when he did actually score a goal, Fox Sports thought it would be a good idea to show a replay of the cove celebrating a Sydney goal, than show the live action…\n\nName: Steven Bryce (2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 4\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC:\n\nCame in with a big reputation and high hopes from the fans given his role in the 2002 world cup for Costa Rica, but flattered to deceive, mainly due to a poor base of fitness.\n\nName: Rocky Visconte (2010- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 15\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 1\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC:\n\nWas perpetually injured last year, but boy did he come thru when it mattered. That bump on Bojic that lead to the corner will live long in the memory, as will his last gasp goal vs. Perth.\n\nName: Thomas Broich (2010- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 32\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 5\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nAnge Postecoglou described him as a ‘big signing’ and boy oh boy did he deliver last year. Player of the year for mine gave everything he had and was the creative link that made the team tick. Not sure about this playing him down the middle approach this season thou.\n\nWhere are they now- Midfielders edition\n\nWhile we wait for season 7 to begin, we look back at the previous 6 and the players who have played for Brisbane- today, part 4, the midfielders.\n\nName: Massimo Murdocca (2005- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 110\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nAnother inaugural signing, Massimo now holds the honour of being the last remaining foundation player at the club, and injury permitting\n\nhe will also overtake Matt McKay in the all time Brisbane appearance list. Tireless, and an unsung hero of the side.\n\nName: Matt McKay\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 131\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 18\n\nCurrent club: Glasgow Rangers\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Incheon United (7), Changchun Yatai (15)\n\nBest player in BRFC history? Absolutely. The local kid who rose through the ranks, progressed to the national team and is now at one of the biggest clubs in British football, if not European football. It was also fitting that he captained the 1st premiership/championship side in\n\nhistory.\n\nName: Jordan Simpson (2005- 2006)\n\nBrisbane Roar games:6\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Blacktown City Demons\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: BSC Young Boys (8), Perth Glory (6) (1), Blacktown City Demons (16), FF Jaro (10) (3), Sydney Olympic (10) (1)\n\nThe young Simpson was touted as one for the future, but never lived up to that reputation and only got half a dozen games before moving on. I\n\nmust have been dozing during these games because I don’t remember much about J. Simpson, other than that he didn’t cut the mustard.\n\nName: Warren Moon\n\nBrisbane Roar games:15\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 2\n\nCurrent club: Unknown\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Queen of the South (12), Eastern Suburbs, Brisbane Strikers, Peninsula Power\n\nMoon was another one of Miron’s local league signings for the inaugural season and didn’t really have much of an impact on the whole, playing either as a left mid or a centre mid.\n\nName: Chris Grossman (2006- 2009)\n\nBrisbane Roar games:7\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Retired\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: North Queensland Fury (44) (5)\n\nYouth league viewers from the early seasons will fondly remember Grossman and his busy, all action performances were quiet often the highlights and those who saw him could not understand how Farina never gave him a prolonged run in the side.\n\nName: Carl Recchia (2006- 2007)\n\nBrisbane Roar games:1\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: South Melbourne (19) (3)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Fawkner Blues (25) (1), Altona Magic (53) (10)\n\nRecchia was one of Miron’s players from the 2nd season and was brought in as a short term injury replacement midway thru the year, but left once Bleiberg resigned.\n\nName: David Dodd (2008-2010)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 23\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 1\n\nCurrent club: Manly United (15) (2)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: The much maligned midfielder was often underrated and underappreciated during his 2 years, but to be fair he was fairly limited in his ability anyway so the fact he managed to even look half competent is a miracle. His goal against Wellington was the highlight of that season thou, just for the comedic value.\n\nName: Charlie Miller (2008-2009)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 30\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 8\n\nCurrent club: Unknown\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Gold Coast United (12) (1), Clyde (5)\n\nHe may have been fat, he may have bailed to the coast, but boy could he play. Miller scored in his 1st 4 games for the club and was the key factor to that side in 2008/09 and his hernia injury derailed the side and while Nichols came in and did well, it wasn’t the same. One of, if not the most technically gifted player in club history.\n\nName: Adam Sarota (2008-2010\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 15\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: FC Utrecht (9)\n\nOther clubs since BRFC:\n\nUnderused. An excellent player with a good passing range and for mine should have been getting more match action in that season ahead of\n\nDodd, Karlovic and whoever else but in his 15 games he made a big impact in midfield.\n\nName: Luke Brattan (2008- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 7\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nRochedale product Bratten has spent the majority of his time in the in the youth squad, but he did get some game time late in the 5th season and early in the 6tth season, and with all the Olyroo call-ups, he should get the chance to cement his spot in midfield this season.\n\nName: Mario Karlovic (2009)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 6\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: PSM Makassar\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: Minangkabau F.C.\n\nThe only thing I remember about Karlovic is he jumped the fence to thank the fans down in Sydney tbh, can’t remember much about his time at the club, apart from the fact he was a injury replacement for Massimo.\n\nName: Erik Paartalu (2010- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 33\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 5\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nBig Erik will forever be in the hearts and minds of Brisbane fans following that header, we all have our stories from that header, but watching it from bay 301 on the sideline and seeing both benches stand up, and the reactions of both (as well as the crowd) is something I will never forget.\n\nName: Chris Bush (2010- Current)\n\nBrisbane Roar games: 0 (2 un-used sub appearances)\n\nBrisbane Roar goals: 0\n\nCurrent club: Brisbane Roar FC\n\nOther clubs since BRFC: N/A\n\nYoung midfielder Bush has only been in the system for a season now, but his impressive NYL performances got him a few bench appearances last season, and if he continues it won’t be long until he gets his 1st game."
