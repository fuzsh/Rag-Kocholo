        "text": "Herald soccer writer Terry Maddaford with his preview of the contenders for the 2010-11 A-League title:\n\nAdelaide United\n\nCoach: Rini Coolen\n\nCaptain: Travis Dodd\n\nLast year's finish: Last\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nDutchman Rini Coolen has been appointed coach for two seasons, replacing Aurelio Vidmar. Coolen is charged with lifting the Reds after last season's bottom place. United remain cash-strapped with management still in the hands of the FFA. On field, the signing of Van Dijk will add scoring potency, their midfield is strong with the creativity of Flores, Cassio and Dodd supplemented by Leckie's zip. And they have arguably the best shot stopper in the land in Galekovic. Expect a rise up the ranks.\n\nPredicted finish: Ninth\n\nTAB odds: $16\n\nBrisbane Roar\n\nCoach: Ange Postecoglou\n\nCaptain: Matt McKay\n\nLast year's finish: Ninth\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nCoach Ange Postecoglou should be cut some slack for last season's debacle. But there will be no escaping if the Roar crash and burn again this season. Financial concerns, a sacked coach, injuries, poor home crowds - what could have gone wrong pretty much did for the Roar last season. Craig Moore and Charlie Miller walked out and youngsters such as Tommy Oar and Michael Zullo were sold. However, Postecoglou has revamped the squad with \"his type of players\", the injury list is diminishing and the Roar have been buoyed by encouraging pre-season results. Postecoglou knows there will be no excuses this season.\n\nPredicted finish: 10th\n\nTAB odds: $22\n\nCentral Coast Mariners\n\nCoach: Graham Arnold\n\nCaptain: Alex Wilkinson\n\nLast year's finish: Eighth\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nThe A-League's most traditionally stable club has undergone a major shake-up. The appointment of former Socceroos coach Graham Arnold should provide a breath of fresh air to the club while it has already brought about some intriguing recruitments. Joshua Rose, Oliver Bozanic and Patricio Perez may be little known to many A-League fans but there is an air of confidence in Gosford they could make their mark this season. The loss of goalkeeper Danny Vukovic is significant but they have covered well by luring Jess Vanstrattan from Gold Coast.\n\nPredicted finish: Eighth\n\nTAB odds: $16\n\nGold Coast United\n\nCoach: Miron Bleiberg\n\nCaptain: Jason Culina\n\nLast year's finish: Third\n\nMarquee player: Jason Culina\n\nGold Coast United may not have delivered on their promise to win the title on debut but they made their presence felt. Then again, any team led by extrovert coach Miron Bleiberg and outspoken billionaire Clive Palmer are not going to fly under the radar. They may have lost keeper Jess Vanstrattan and veteran Charlie Miller but have more than compensated with arrival of Kiwi international gloveman Glen Moss and former Manchester United defender Curtis. Question mark still remains over star striker Shane Smeltz. If he remains, Culina is expected to rally his troops again for a title push.\n\nPredicted finish: Second\n\nTAB odds: $7\n\nMelbourne Heart\n\nCoach: John van 't Schip\n\nCaptain: Simon Colosimo\n\nLast year's finish: N/A (on debut)\n\nMarquee player: Josip Skoko\n\nThe Heart need early success to ensure they win crowd support. And some smart recruiting ensures they should make a quick impact. They have promised an attractive brand of possession football and have the class to achieve it. Captain Simon Colosimo and goalkeeper Clint Bolton, both key members of Sydney FC's championship side, provide a solid foundation, with Socceroo Michael Beauchamp and experienced former Central Coast player Dean Heffernan also part of an impressive defence. Luring former Socceroo Josip Skoko is a coup for their midfield, alongside hard-working former Newcastle Jets skipper Matt Thompson. Experienced marksman John Aloisi, who might be used in a bench role, adds class in attack.\n\nPredicted finish: Sixth\n\nTAB odds: $9\n\nMelbourne Victory\n\nCoach: Ernie Merrick\n\nCaptain: Kevin Muscat\n\nLast year's finish: Second\n\nMarquee player: Archie Thompson\n\nTwo championships and another grand final appearance in the past four seasons, combined with minimal squad changes, mean the Victory must be rated contenders again. But they have some challenges. Star striker Archie Thompson is out of action until mid-season, with the Victory still seeking an overseas recruit to fill the gap. Defender Matthew Kemp will have his season start delayed, while midfielder Billy Celeski is another coming back from injury. The age of Victory's squad is worth noting, particularly in defence, with skipper Kevin Muscat about to turn 37. He will be one of seven 30-plus players. The Victory will be keen to assert their dominance over new local rivals Melbourne Heart.\n\nPredicted finish: Third\n\nTAB odds: $3.75\n\nNewcastle Jets\n\nCoach: Branko Culina\n\nCaptain: Michael Bridges\n\nLast year's finish: Sixth\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nCulina surpassed expectations last season by leading the Jets into the finals. This time, with a full off-season under his belt, the colourful coach will be targeting even more improvement and a further development of the attractive football shown at times last campaign. The loss of inspirational captain Matt Thompson to Melbourne Heart is huge but Culina has made some decent recruits in bringing former Socceroos Kasey Wehrman and Ruben Zadkovich back from Europe. An injury-free squad is capable of causing any team problems.\n\nPredicted finish: Seventh\n\nTAB odds: $22\n\nNorth Queensland Fury\n\nCoach: Franz Straka\n\nCaptain: Ufuk Talay\n\nLast year's finish: Seventh\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nThe Fury just missed out on playing finals in their debut season - but that was the least of their problems by season's end. On field, the Fury had played an entertaining brand led by superstar Robbie Fowler and looked to build a formidable reputation at home. Off it, things weren't so rosy. In the end, FFA stepped in to save them from collapse after original Fury boss Don Matheson was forced to withdraw his financial support following reports of the club losing $4.5 million in their inaugural season. But if anyone can steer the cash-strapped Fury through what looms as a difficult season, it is new mentor, former Czech national coach Franz Straka. The likes of captain Ufuk Talay, Socceroo David Williams, Togo international Erik Akoto and former Everton defender Mark Hughes bolster a thin squad.\n\nPredicted finish: 11th\n\nTAB odds: $35\n\nPerth Glory\n\nCoach: Dave Mitchell\n\nCaptain: Jacob Burns\n\nLast year's finish: Fifth\n\nMarquee player: Robbie Fowler\n\nThe addition of Fowler's goal-scoring nous and other promising recruitments have given the Glory an ominous look, on paper. If all gels, there should be an improvement on last season. Mitchell's priority will be to get some much-needed consistency out of his squad. How 35-year-old Fowler fares in what is arguably a much stronger side than the one he played in in his debut campaign with North Queensland should be interesting to see.\n\nPredicted finish: Fifth\n\nTAB odds: $10\n\nSydney FC\n\nCoach: Vitezslav Lavicka\n\nCaptain: Terry McFlynn\n\nLast year's finish: First\n\nMarquee player: Nick Carle\n\nSydney FC will have targets on their back having claimed the premiership and championship double last season but that's unlikely to prove the biggest challenge of their title defence. The Sky Blues must rebuild after having the spine ripped out of their squad. Gone are defender Simon Colosimo and striker John Aloisi - both to new franchise Melbourne Heart - and retired central midfielder Steve Corica. Nick Carle and Scott Jamieson are class recruits but the reigning champions could have their depth tested should injuries strike. In Vitezslav Lavicka, however, Sydney have a coach who in just one season has proved himself an equally capable tactician and man manager.\n\nPredicted finish: First\n\nTAB odds: $3.50\n\nWellington Phoenix\n\nCoach: Ricki Herbert\n\nCaptain: Andrew Durante\n\nLast year's finish: Fourth\n\nMarquee player: None\n\nPhoenix coach Ricki Herbert could be forgiven for thinking the past 12 months have been a dream. Not only did he steer the Phoenix within one win of last year's grand final, he returned from the World Cup in South Africa as an unbeaten coach with the All Whites grinding out three draws. With confidence still soaring and a stable squad, there's nothing to suggest the Phoenix can't be as successful as last season and push for a finish high on the ladder. In recent seasons they've turned their Westpac Stadium base into a fortress and in Paul Ifill they possess one of the league's biggest attacking threats.\n\nPredicted finish: Fourth\n\nTAB odds: $9"
