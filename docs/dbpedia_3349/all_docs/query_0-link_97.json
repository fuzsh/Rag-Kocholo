        "text": "Football Federation Australia, the Newcastle Jets and Jason Culina have ended a long-running dispute triggered by the Jets' dumping of the former Socceroo, the players' union said Wednesday.\n\nNewcastle Jets moved in October to cancel the contract of their injured marquee player. According to reports, the dispute centred on whether the FFA had failed to ensure Culina was covered by insurance.\n\nThe FFA maintained it was a club's responsibility to insure their players.\n\n\"The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) is pleased that FFA, Newcastle Jets and Jason have reached a settlement by mutual agreement, the commercial terms of which are confidential,\" PFA chief Brendan Schwab said.\n\n\"As a result, Jason's employment agreement with the Jets has also been terminated and he is free to continue his playing career elsewhere in the A-League.\"\n\nCulina, 31, who has represented Australia in more than 40 matches but played his last international in January 2011, said he was pleased the matter was behind him and determined to secure his future with the domestic A-League competition.\n\n\"I look forward to resuming my playing career as soon as I have completed my rehabilitation, which is proceeding very well,\" he said.\n\nCulina returned to Australia after a decade overseas playing with Dutch sides Ajax, FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven for the 2009-10 season, signing with then-new franchise Gold Coast United.\n\nHe signed for Newcastle Jets in February 2011 after he had knee surgery for an existing injury which reportedly made it impossible for the Jets to insure him. He later needed a further operation and was ruled out for the entire 2011/12 season."
