        "text": "Jason Culina is poised to play his first game in nearly two years, as his comeback from a potentially career-ending injury nears fruition.\n\nSydney FC hope Culina, who has been capped 58 times for the Socceroos, will play in a friendly arranged against Western Sydney Wanderers next week to give recovering and under-used players on both sides some game time.\n\nBut the game would represent another step on an astonishingly brave comeback trail, after he broke down on the eve of last season while contracted to Newcastle Jets.\n\nCulina signed for Sydney for the rest of this season having convinced the club his recovery was almost complete, though his first start will prove a hugely symbolic moment.\n\nHis readiness for competitive action can't come quickly enough for Crook who conceded that the injuries to various players had hampered his attempts to instil a ball-playing style at Sydney.\n\nThough Sydney recorded a second consecutive win last Sunday, the Sky Blues coach admitted the result did not match the performance.\n\n\"I have to be honest, I did think that the game against the Mariners (this coming Saturday) would be the right point to gauge where we're at, given the disruption we had in pre-season, but only if everyone was fit,\" Crook said.\n\n\"Once Bosschaart, Griffiths, Culina and (Joel) Chinanese are back in the mix, then we can start to judge. We didn't play well at the weekend, there's no getting away from that.\n\n\"But we've been trying to give the players a message that they should have the confidence to play.\n\n\"That's what I've always preached, if you like, and that won't change.\""
