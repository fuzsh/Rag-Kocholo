        "text": "BRANKO CULINA arrived at yesterday morning's A-League launch talking up the new era at Newcastle Jets, but by lunchtime was no longer part of that future. The Jets' owner, Nathan Tinkler, sensationally wielded an axe that also claimed the scalp of Culina's son, the Socceroos star Jason Culina.\n\nOne year into a five-year deal and after an undefeated preparation for the new season, which kicks off with a home game against Melbourne Heart on Saturday, Branko Culina was summoned to Tinkler's office in central Sydney to be informed his services no longer would be required. The youth team coach, Craig Deans, at this stage, will take the team against the Heart.\n\nTinkler simultaneously applied to Football Federation Australia to ''set aside'' the three-year contract of Jason Culina - the marquee player he hoped would lead the Jets to glory but who instead recently re-injured his right knee and now faces a tough battle to salvage his career. The head of Professional Footballer's Australia, Brendan Schwab, said the move to rescind Culina's $800,000-a-season playing contract was ''unprecedented''.\n\nWith compensation and perhaps damages an issue, neither Branko Culina nor his son would comment late yesterday, but it is known they are both shocked and distraught. Jason Culina knocked back an offer from Sydney FC to join the Jets.\n\nBranko Culina clearly had no inkling of what was in store when he attended the season launch at the SFS, telling the assembled media: ''It's been terrific - obviously we've got a new owner and when you've got a new owner, new ideas and new enthusiasm around the club … we're trying to turn the team into a club and it's on the right track.''\n\nIn truth, it was Tinkler who made the call, and in a typically brief comment, which contained no reference to the sacking of his coach, he only had words on Jason Culina.\n\n''Jason's injury could mean the Jets are without their marquee player for up to three seasons - not a good result for the club, supporters, sponsors and players,'' Tinkler said. ''While I acknowledge the difficult timing of this announcement, I am confident in the character of the Jets' players and staff who will quickly put this matter behind them and enjoy a great season.''\n\nTinkler dispensed with his marquee player just a day after he emerged from hospital, where he had a fragment of his tibia removed in an attempt to straighten his leg and take the pressure off his damaged knee.\n\n''Jason has just had a serious operation so he can play for the club he is contracted to,'' Schwab said. ''He is doing everything he can so he can play as soon as he can. He deserves support and respect at this time, and just two weeks ago I had a meeting with the club and they assured me they would support him 100 per cent.\n\n''As it stands, we [PFA] haven't received anything from the club … But we're not aware of any power the FFA would have to do this [set aside the contract]. You can't terminate the contract of a player simply because he's injured.''"
