        "text": "The club has made a huge recruitment coup, signing current Qantas Socceroo Jason Culina on a 3-year deal.\n\nThe Newcastle Jets are pleased to announce the signing of current Socceroo, Jason Culina.\n\nIn a major recruiting coup for the Newcastle Jets, the Socceroo Midfielder will join the club on a 3-year contract.\n\nCulina confirmed today that he was excited about being part of this new and exciting period for the Newcastle Jets.\n\n“I am really looking forward to the next three years. I believe Newcastle has commenced a unique phase in the Club-s history, for both players and for supporters” said Culina.\n\n“The Jets have great young players that I am really excited about joining and adding to their development”\n\nCulina went further believing that the Jets were capable of being a force in the 2011/2012 Hyundai A-League Season.\n\n“With the playing roster the Jets have and a little bit of luck, I fully expect us to be challenging the top teams next season. It-s going to be a really exciting ride we have ahead of ourselves.”\n\nNewcastle Jets Football Advisory Board Chairman and ex-Socceroo, Mr. Ray Baartz commented on the turnaround the Jets have experienced since their acquisition by the Tinkler Sports Group.\n\n“This is just fantastic news” said Baartz.\n\n“We need to acknowledge that without the support from Nathan Tinkler and his team, there would have been little chance of the Jets being able to sign a player of Jason-s ability and stature in the game”\n\n“In my opinion, he is by far the best player in the A-League, the people of Newcastle should be extremely happy today,” Baartz added.\n\nThe signing of Culina is another step in the development of the Newcastle Jets, following a recent increase of 250% to strengthen the Football Department for season 2011/2012.\n\nJASON CULINA BIO:\n\nPosition: Midfielder\n\nPrevious Clubs:\n\n1996-1998 Sydney United (Australia)\n\n1998-1999 Sydney Olympic (Australia)\n\n2000-2004 Ajax (Netherlands)\n\n2001 Germinal Beerschot (Belgium) (loan)\n\n2002-2003 De Graafschap (Netherlands) (loan)\n\n2004-2006 FC Twente (Netherlands)\n\n2006-2009 PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands)\n\n2009-2011 Gold Coast United (Australia)\n\nMajor Honours:\n\n1999 FIFA World Youth Championships (Nigeria)\n\n2000 Olympic Games Finals (Sydney)\n\n2005 FIFA Confederations Cup (Germany)\n\n2006 FIFA World Cup Finals (Germany)\n\n2007 Asian Cup Finals\n\n2009/10 Gold Coast United Player of the Year\n\n2010 FIFA World Cup Finals (South Africa)\n\n2010 Asian Cup Finals\n\n59 Socceroo Caps"
