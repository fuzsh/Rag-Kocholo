        "text": "It's been an entertaining start to the season, the league is really maturing and the quality is showing a marked improvement.\n\nI travelled to the Gold Coast to watch Brisbane start their season last Sunday and we played really well. Whilst at 0-0 it didn't have the goals of many of the matches this season it was an enthralling game.\n\nWhat sort of suport do they get? How competitive is it?\n\nWhat sort of suport do they get? How competitive is it?\n\nCrowds are the biggest issue. Brisbane play Sydney at the weekend and the crowd will be somewhere between 10 and 15k\n\nThe initial novelty of the league (this is the 6th season of the A-League) is wearing off and finding a true level. Of course that's not a bad crowd, but when you consider they play in a 55,000 Premier League standard stadium 10,000 can get a bit lost in there. However football is far from the number 1 sport here, so to expect to sell the place out is just unrealistic. Having said that for the local derby against Gold Coast we took around 3,000 fans which was great to see.\n\nIt's a close and competitive league, there's a salary cap so no-one can go out and buy a championship winning side. The standard is improving all the time but with some huge disparity between the best and worst players. Robbie Fowler is past his best but returning Socceroos like Jason Culina could definitely do a job at a top Championship or lower Premier League club. The worst players though would struggle in League 2.\n\nIf you're interested, here's my first published (of hopefully a regular) blog on an Aussie site on the subject of Brisbane Roar -\n\nhttp://www.backpagelead.com.au/soccer/2234-a-league-blog-a-growing-rivalry"
