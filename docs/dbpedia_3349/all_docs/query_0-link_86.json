        "text": "Club career\n\nCulina started off with Sydney United under his father, Branko, before moving on to Ajax where he struggled in the reserves. Only after moving to FC Twente did Culina begin to shine at the top level in club football. This was proved by his moving to another top Dutch club, PSV Eindhoven. Whilst originally an attack minded midfielder with Twente, at PSV Culina played more in a disciplined defensive role for the club with immediate success. In his final year at PSV, Culina was mainly deployed at right back with further success thus attributing to Culina's versatility and utility value.\n\nOn 9 January 2009 Culina announced his intention to return to Australia after turning down a contract extension from PSV as he sought a new challenge and a fresh start in Australia.\n\n\"I want to make a fresh start and I am ready for a new challenge. I am the first international who returns to Australia and I am keen to promote the national competition and raise the standard.\"\n\nOn 14 January 2009 he was signed by Gold Coast United on a three-year deal becoming the club's first marquee player. On 1 July 2009 he made his Gold Coast debut in a friendly in Singapore against a Singapore Olympic Selection, coming on as a substitute for Steve Pantelidis and scoring in the 88th minute from 25 yards out. On 22 February 2011 it was revealed Culina would join his father Branko Culina at the Newcastle Jets. Culina was injured long term and missed the 2011/2012 season. Čulina's contract was set aside, but he continued his rehab and training with the club.\n\nOn 12 October 2012 he signed with A-League club Sydney FC. However, he lasted less than a year with the club, parting ways with the club in February 2013, after a disagreement with manager Frank Farina. Culina announced his retirement on 18 June 2013, at an Football Federation Australia function.\n\nCoaching career\n\nIn 2015, Culina joined the King's School football coaching staff, helping with the school's first team. In 2016, Culina moved to St Joseph's College, and was the college's technical director of football and coach of the First XI. He now coaches Fraser Park FC in the National Premier Leagues NSW.\n\nOn 16 August 2017, Culina was appointed head coach of Sydney United 58, after Mark Rudan stepped down.\n\nInternational career\n\nCulina made his debut for the Australian national team against South Africa in 2005. He became a regular starter for the Socceroos under coach Guus Hiddink, who was also his club coach at PSV Eindhoven. His first international goal came in September 2005, against the Solomon Islands in Sydney. Culina played in both legs of the World Cup play-off against Uruguay where Australia qualified for the 2006 World Cup, following a dramatic penalty shoot-out. He was selected in the Australian squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and started in all four of Australia's games. On 3 March 2010, Culina was named captain of Australia for the first time, in an AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Indonesia, a game which Australia won 1–0. On 18 June 2013 Culina announced his official international retirement, at a function held before Australia's World Cup qualifier against Iraq.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCulina is the youngest son of coach and former Sydney FC and Newcastle Jets manager Branko Culina and is of Croatian descent.\n\nOn 5 February 2007, Culina and his wife, Terri, welcomed their first child, a boy named Roman.\n\nCareer stats\n\nAs of 25 June 2013\n\nInternational goals\n\nHonours\n\nAjax\n\nWinner\n\n2001–02 KNVB Cup\n\n2002 Dutch Super Cup\n\nEredivisie 2003–04\n\nPSV Eindhoven\n\nWinner\n\n2007 Russian Railways Cup\n\nEredivisie 2005–06, 2006–07, 2007–08\n\n2008 Dutch Super Cup\n\nPersonal honours\n\nGold Coast United Player of the Year: 2009–2010"
