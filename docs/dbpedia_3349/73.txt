Jason Culina has reached a settlement agreement with the Newcastle Jets and FFA over the former Socceroo's sacking from the Hunter club.

The Jets terminated Culina's contract on the eve of Hyundai A-League season 2011/12, after it was found the midfielder didn't have the proper insurance to cover a serious knee injury.

But the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) announced that the club, the player and FFA had come to an agreement, and as a result, the scheduled June hearings of the National Dispute Resolution Chamber under the A-League Collective Bargaining Agreement will not proceed.

“The PFA is pleased that FFA, Newcastle Jets and Jason have reached a settlement by mutual agreement, the commercial terms of which are confidential,” PFA Chief Executive Brendan Schwab said.

“As a result, Jason-s employment agreement with the Jets has also been terminated and he is free to continue his playing career elsewhere in the A-League.”

“Having this matter settled is important for the game, for Jason and for the Jets,” CEO Robbie Middleby said.

“With it now settled, we are able to continue to build our squad for next season and beyond.

“The Jets wish Jason all the best as he continues with his rehabilitation.”

Culina said he was also pleased the matter was now resolved.

“I would like to acknowledge the efforts of FFA and the Newcastle Jets to achieve a settlement and to avoid further legal proceedings,” Culina said.
