The club has made a huge recruitment coup, signing current Qantas Socceroo Jason Culina on a 3-year deal.

The Newcastle Jets are pleased to announce the signing of current Socceroo, Jason Culina.

In a major recruiting coup for the Newcastle Jets, the Socceroo Midfielder will join the club on a 3-year contract.

Culina confirmed today that he was excited about being part of this new and exciting period for the Newcastle Jets.

“I am really looking forward to the next three years. I believe Newcastle has commenced a unique phase in the Club-s history, for both players and for supporters” said Culina.

“The Jets have great young players that I am really excited about joining and adding to their development”

Culina went further believing that the Jets were capable of being a force in the 2011/2012 Hyundai A-League Season.

“With the playing roster the Jets have and a little bit of luck, I fully expect us to be challenging the top teams next season. It-s going to be a really exciting ride we have ahead of ourselves.”

Newcastle Jets Football Advisory Board Chairman and ex-Socceroo, Mr. Ray Baartz commented on the turnaround the Jets have experienced since their acquisition by the Tinkler Sports Group.

“This is just fantastic news” said Baartz.

“We need to acknowledge that without the support from Nathan Tinkler and his team, there would have been little chance of the Jets being able to sign a player of Jason-s ability and stature in the game”

“In my opinion, he is by far the best player in the A-League, the people of Newcastle should be extremely happy today,” Baartz added.

The signing of Culina is another step in the development of the Newcastle Jets, following a recent increase of 250% to strengthen the Football Department for season 2011/2012.
