        "text": "The USS STERETT Association is an organization that celebrates former and current crew members of all the ships that have proudly carried the Sterett name. Whether you have interest in the DD-27, the DD-407, the DLG/CG-31 or the DDG-104, this is the place for you. Since 1998, the USS STERETT Association has existed because people just like you have fond memories of a special time aboard any of the ships named after Master Commandant Andrew Sterett (1778-1807), an early American naval hero. So, grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite grog) and check out the USS STERETT Association web site. It might just take you back to a special place and time."
