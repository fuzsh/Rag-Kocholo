        "text": "Caroline Erin Collins, of Sayville, recently graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) at Kings Point. Collins earned a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission in the U.S. armed forces. She also earned a Merchant Marine officer license, qualifying her to serve as an officer on any ship in the U.S. flag merchant marine.\n\nThe United States Merchant Marine Academy is one of five U.S. federal service academies. It educates and graduates licensed Merchant Marine officers to serve the nation during peace and war. In addition to the rigorous academic and physical requirements for admission, applicants must be nominated by their congressman or senator.\n\nAll USMMA graduates incur an obligation to serve the United States. The U.S. Flag Merchant Marine—manned exclusively by American mariners—is essential for securing the country’s commerce in peacetime and delivering warfighters, weapons, and military supplies in times of conflict. The majority of “Kings Pointers” serve for eight years as Navy reservists in the Strategic Sealift Officer Program while working aboard U.S. flag vessels; others will serve on active duty in our nation’s armed forces.\n\nBy virtue of their elite training and real-world experience, graduates are ready to go on Day One in service of American military strength and economic power. As part of her four-year education, Collins spent one year training as a cadet aboard ocean-going vessels."
