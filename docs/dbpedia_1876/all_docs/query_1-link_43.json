        "text": "The following are some steps you can take if you are interested in becoming a merchant mariner.\n\n1. Complete a mariner training program\n\n2. Apply for TWIC\n\n3. Get a physical and drug screening\n\n4. Apply for MMC\n\n1. Complete a Mariner Training Program\n\nIf you want to get a job in the Merchant Marine, you must first get trained to receive the knowledge, experience, and credentials to become a successful mariner.\n\n2. Apply for TWIC\n\nBefore applying for a job as a mariner, you must apply for a Transportation Worker’s Identification Credential (TWIC). The TWIC indicates that the applicant presents no security threat. To receive a TWIC, an applicant must pass background checks, which typically include an immigration status check, a criminal background check, and a terrorist watch list check.\n\n3. Get a Physical and Drug Screening\n\nTo become a mariner, an applicant will have to take a physical and undergo drug screening. Conditions such as serious heart disease and specific psychiatric disorders may be disqualifying for those who don’t take medications to control them.\n\n4. Apply for MMC\n\nFor the MMC (known to mariners as the “red book”), applicants will have to show proof of having passed drug tests and medical examinations, including tests of their physical fitness, vision and hearing. They must also provide proof of their citizenship and required experience.\n\nWhat Is a Merchant Mariner?\n\nA merchant mariner serves aboard a commercial vessel as part of the Merchant Marine after completing training and Coast Guard-approved certification. The mariner may have a variety of jobs, from electronics to culinary work. Mariners help keep a vessel operating smoothly and ensure that the vessel, cargo, and passengers get safely to their destination.\n\nWhat Type of Jobs are Available?\n\nMariners may work on a variety of ships. Common possibilities oceangoing tanker, container ships, bulk carriers, towboats, ferries, dredges, and cruise ships. Mariners’ careers may take them to just about anybody of water, from the oceans to the Great Lakes to many harbors, canals, and rivers.\n\nMariners can choose from among different career paths within the Merchant Marine. The three possible options are the engineering, deck and steward’s departments. Prospective mariners should decide on their intended career paths early, since your chosen career path will determine your requirements for the Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC).\n\nDeckhands maintain and operate the vessel and its deck equipment. New deckhands are Ordinary Seamen (OS). Sailors with more experience are Able Seamen (AB). Deckhands may stand watch, paint, chip away rust, clean the interior of the ship, handle mooring lines, tie barges together, load and unload cargo, assist passengers, and sometimes steer the ship under the supervision of an officer.\n\nEngine department: Members of the engine department include engineers, electricians, mechanics and oilers. They make sure the machinery on a vessel operates correctly.\n\nDeck department: Members of the deck department include merchant seamen and lifeboatmen. They assist with the day-to-day functions of the ship.\n\nSteward’s department: Members of the steward’s department provide the ship’s food.\n\nOther positions include captains, mates, pilots, engineers, and oilers.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Become a Merchant Mariner?\n\nThe time required to become a mariner depends on the route an applicant takes. A person who joins as an Ordinary Seaman may become a mariner after passing the required courses and exams and receiving the necessary credentials, which may be a matter of only a few months.\n\nIs There an Age Limit for the Merchant Marine?\n\nYou must be at least 16 years old to apply for an MMC. There is no upper age limit. Many people have retired from their first careers and gone on to successful second careers as Merchant Mariners.\n\nIs the Merchant Marine Part of the Military?\n\nNo. Though the Coast Guard oversees certification, mariners are civilians. The merchant marines are not part of the military.\n\nHow Much Do Merchant Marines Get Paid?\n\nThe salary of a merchant marine varies by the training received. According to ZipRecruiter, the average annual pay for an International Ordinary Seaman in the United States is $90,508 a year. That works out to be approximately $43.51/hour (the equivalent of $1,740/week or $7,542/month.)\n\nWhat Are the Physical Requirements?\n\nMariners must pass a vision test and a physical fitness test. A prospective mariner must demonstrate strength, agility and flexibility, as determined by the examining medical professional. If the examiner doubts the applicant’s ability to perform essential shipboard functions or meet the demands of an emergency response, or if the applicant’s body mass index is 40 or higher, the examiner may require a demonstration of specific abilities.\n\nFor vision, current deck standards require that a mariner have at least 20/40 corrected vision in one eye and at least 20/200 uncorrected vision in the same eye. Engineering, tankerman, radio operator and MODU standards require at least 20/50 corrected vision in one eye and at least 20/200 uncorrected vision in the same eye."
