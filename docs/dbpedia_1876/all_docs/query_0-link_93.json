        "text": "Courtesy of Lehigh Athletics Communications\n\nBETHLEHEM, Pa. – After 13 seasons leading the Lehigh football program, Andy Coen has elected to step away from his position as head football coach to spend more time with his family and address a health issue.\n\nCoen amassed a record of 85-64 at Lehigh, with the 85 victories tying Bill Leckonby for the most in the long and distinguished history of Lehigh football. A two-time Patriot League Coach of the Year, Coen led Lehigh to five Patriot League championships in 13 seasons, including most recently, back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017.\n\nHe steps away at this time following a diagnosis of Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n\"Life has thrown me a curveball,\" Coen said. \"I am in the early stages and it is best for me to eliminate stress and concentrate on my health and well-being. It is an opportunity for me to spend more time with my family. Coaching is a 24/7 job and does not allow a lot of time for family. My wife, Laura, and my children, Molly, Nolan and Finn have supported me throughout my career and are my biggest fans. This is a very difficult decision for all of us, but it is what is best at this time.\"\n\nIn his 13 seasons as head coach, Coen mentored 135 All-Patriot League selections, six Patriot League major award winners, 25 All-America selections, 10 CoSIDA Academic All-District honorees, two CoSIDA Academic All-Americans and 236 Patriot League Academic Honor Roll selections.\n\n\"More than his success on the field, Andy has always recognized the importance of his role as an educator and developer of young men,\" Lehigh Dean of Athletics Joe Sterrett '76 said. \"He is deeply respected by the men who played for him and those who worked with or for him, and by his many colleagues in the Lehigh Athletics Department. He will always have our gratitude, friendship and support.\"\n\nCoen led Lehigh to a share of the Patriot League title in his first season as a head coach (2006). He also won Patriot League championships in 2010 and 2011 and then again in 2016 and 2017. Coen won Patriot League Coach of the Year honors in 2010 and 2016 and was a three-time finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award, given to the top coach in the Football Championship Subdivision, finishing seventh in 2010, sixth in 2011 and 11th in 2016.\n\nLehigh's 2011 squad was one of the finest in school history. Under Coen's leadership the Mountain Hawks won their second straight league title, and after earning a first-round bye, defeated CAA champion Towson 40-38 in the second round of the FCS Playoffs, to secure Lehigh's first NCAA quarterfinal berth since 2001. Lehigh finished the season ranked fifth nationally and earned the program's eighth Lambert Cup, given to the top FCS program in the northeast.\n\nIn addition to the 2011 Lambert Cup, Coen's Lehigh teams were twice recognized as ECAC Team of the Year: the 2011 team and the 2016 squad which won its final nine regular season games to claim the program's 11th Patriot League title.\n\nFittingly, Coen's final game and victory as Lehigh's head coach came against rival Lafayette on Nov. 17. Coen went 9-4 in 13 Rivalry games, highlighted by a 2017 win that clinched Lehigh's 12th Patriot League crown and an overtime win in 2009 that denied the Leopards a share of the league title. Of the 11 classes in school history to go 4-0 over their careers against Lafayette, three (2012, 2013 and 2019) did so under Coen's guidance.\n\n\"Today is one of the toughest days in my coaching career that spans 30-plus years,\" Coen said. \"I never thought that when I took a job as an intern at Widener in 1986, that I would be making this a profession.\n\n\"I've truly been blessed over the years to have coached at great schools where I was able to hone my skills and my passion for coaching. I worked hard and was rewarded for my knowledge and abilities as I worked up the coaching ladder. Becoming a head coach was always a dream and to be here at Lehigh for the past 13 seasons, I was truly 'living the dream.'\"\n\nCoen became the 28th head football coach in Lehigh history on January 3, 2006. That announcement marked his return to Lehigh, where he spent six seasons as an offensive line coach – including four as the team's offensive coordinator. Coen was part of three Patriot League championship teams during his first stint at Lehigh.\n\nPrior to returning to Lehigh, Coen spent six seasons as the offensive coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania, where he captured three Ivy League titles, including a top ten national finish in 2003.\n\nBefore his original stint at Lehigh, Coen coached at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and also worked as a graduate assistant at Minnesota and James Madison.\n\nA native of Cherry Hill, N.J., Coen earned his bachelor's degree in history from Gettysburg College in 1986.\n\nCoen and his wife Laura have three children: a daughter, Molly, and two sons, Nolan and Finn.\n\nThe Lehigh Athletics Department will immediately launch an expedient, yet thorough, search for a successor.\n\nDefensive line coach and assistant head coach Donnie Roberts will guide the program through this transitional phase."
