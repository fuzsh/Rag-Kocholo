A fleet of commercial and government U.S. flagged ships, crewed by licensed American mariners, are available to meet military transportation needs.\n\nThe majority of today’s merchant mariners work in the private sector, but are committed to always answering the call of duty. That is why the U.S. Merchant Marine flag reads “In War and Peace.” These mariners are inherent heroes – with over 11,000 merchant mariners killed in the Revolutionary War and over 8,000 killed in World War II."
