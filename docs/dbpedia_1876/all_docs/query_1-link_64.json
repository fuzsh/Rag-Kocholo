        "text": "Ravis S. Delrie, son of Jason and Carolyn Delrie of Niceville, has recently graduated from the prestigious United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) at Kings Point, New York. Delrie earned a Bachelor of Science and a commission in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nAdditionally, he has qualified as a Merchant Marine officer, which authorizes him to serve as an officer on any U.S.-flag merchant marine ship.\n\nThe USMMA, one of the five U.S. federal service academies, is renowned for educating and graduating licensed Merchant Marine officers who serve the nation in peace and wartime. Admission to this elite institution is highly competitive, requiring rigorous academic and physical qualifications and a Congressman or Senator nomination. Delrie received nominations from Senators Marco Rubio, Rick Scott, and Representative Matt Gaetz.\n\nUSMMA graduates commit to serving the United States, with many joining the U.S. Flag Merchant Marine. Manned exclusively by American mariners, this vital sector is crucial in securing the nation’s commerce during peacetime and delivering essential supplies and personnel during conflicts. Most “Kings Pointers” serve as Navy reservists in the Strategic Sealift Officer Program for eight years while working aboard U.S. flag vessels, although some choose active duty roles in the armed forces. Delrie will fulfill his commitment as a Third Mate in the U.S. Merchant Marine and a U.S. Navy Strategic Sealift Officer.\n\nGraduates of the USMMA are prepared through elite training and extensive real-world experience. As part of his four-year education, Delrie spent a year training as a cadet aboard ocean-going vessels, ensuring he was ready to serve the nation from day one.\n\nThe Academy’s commencement ceremony featured White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan as the keynote speaker. Sullivan praised the graduates, stating, “You have much to be proud of, and the path you have chosen is tremendously honorable. As soon-to-be ensigns and second lieutenants, assistant engineers, and third mates, you will crew ships that are essential to our nation’s security. You’ll spend a large part of your life at sea so that your fellow Americans can live safely at home.”\n\nThis year’s ceremony also marked the 50th anniversary of women entering the USMMA, making it the first federal service academy to admit women. Rear Admiral Dianna Wolfson, a USMMA alumna from the class of 1996, delivered a distinguished speech in honor of this milestone.\n\nDedicated during World War II, the USMMA continues to serve the nation with distinction in both peace and war."
