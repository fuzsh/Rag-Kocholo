Kelly, who graduated from the USMMA in 1986 and went on to serve 25 years in the U.S. Navy, is the first ever USMMA alumnus to serve in Congress.\n\n“As the first USMMA graduate to serve in Congress, I am honored to have been chosen for this responsibility. For our economy and our national security, we need a strong Merchant Marine—and that means a strong U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. I am eager to get to work on addressing the many challenges facing the Academy, including rebuilding campus infrastructure, and creating a safe and effective learning environment to meet our commercial and military maritime needs,” said Kelly.\n\nBackground"
