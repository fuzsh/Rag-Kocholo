The U.S. Merchant Marine Corps was established in 1938; the academy, occupying 68 acres (27.5 hectares) at Kings Point on the north shore of Long Island, N.Y., was dedicated on Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nGraduates are licensed as either deck or engineer officers and receive the degree of bachelor of science. They are also eligible to apply for commissions as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve. Candidates for admission to the academy must be unmarried U.S. citizens, have reached their 17th but not 22nd birthday by July 1 of the year in which they plan to enter the academy, be nominated by a congressman, take a competitive examination held annually, and meet rigid physical requirements."
