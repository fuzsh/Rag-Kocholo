Read our blog here: https://lnkd.in/eXeFHmAZ\n\nReflecting on two decades in uniform: Commitment is the cornerstone of victory. As a Navy veteran, this principle has not only shaped me in service but also transformed my approach in the civilian sector. What enduring lesson has your profession taught you? Join the conversation. #MilitaryToCivilian #CommitmentIsKey #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nThis is an outstanding list of priorities. This is what the Space Force should have. Nowhere in here does the Navy say it's a support force for the other services. Nowhere in here does it say it relies on others to do it's missions. It's a warfighting service that deters and projects combat, warfighting power. The CNO has provided the example for the CSO.

While it is true that science, to the extent of its grasp of causative connections, may reach important conclusions as to the compatibility and incompatibility of goals and evaluations, the independent and fundamental definitions regarding goals and values remain beyond science's reach.” -Known-unknowns, 2024- https://lnkd.in/gzq7jfVm #SemperFi #oldkockco.\n\nToday in History : What Happened This Day? October 13, 1775: U.S. Navy Birthday The United States Navy celebrates its birthday on October 13th each year. This date commemorates the day in 1775 when the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of two armed vessels to attack British ships during the American Revolution. #Vajirao #VajiraoInstitute #VajiraoandReddyInstitute #UPSC #upscexam #civilservicespreparation #upscpreparation #IASCoachingInstitute #IASCoaching #IASInstitute\n\nThis is Shannon Hostetter, a TK alumna who's also a proud mother, graduate of two master's degrees, and Navy veteran.
