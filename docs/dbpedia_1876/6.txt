The U.S. Merchant Marine

The U.S. Merchant Marine is a vital part of the domestic maritime industry and is recognized as “The Fourth Arm of National Defense,” having served the United States in every war since 1776. A fleet of commercial and government U.S. flagged ships, crewed by licensed American mariners, are available to meet military transportation needs.

The majority of today’s merchant mariners work in the private sector, but are committed to always answering the call of duty. That is why the U.S. Merchant Marine flag reads “In War and Peace.” These mariners are inherent heroes – with over 11,000 merchant mariners killed in the Revolutionary War and over 8,000 killed in World War II.
