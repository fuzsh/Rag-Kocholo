        "text": "Assignment:\n\nYour task is to create a sculpture (not a functional form like a teapot or a vase) that focuses on capturing volume in a form. The work should convey a sense of gravity and weightiness. The clay may look as if it is a piece of soft fabric, draping under the weight of gravity. Stretching out, bulging out, pillowing out a slab from the inside of a form helps achieve a volumetric form that is plump, bursting, or even exploding. Conversely you can press in, puncture, or collapse a form to create the look of something sunken, shrinking, shriveling, etc.\n\nAs you are designing your sculpture consider how you might combine several simple forms together to create something that is more complex and interesting. (for example multiple cylinders, spheres, cubes, etc. attached to one another). Also, keep in mind how you might treat the surface after the form is achieved (impressing, incising, additive, piercing, etc).\n\nVolume is the size, bulk and dimension of a particular object. It is an object that is usually thick, nontransparent and exists solidly and three-dimensionally in space and it is not flat. Volume is closely allied to mass although mass implies weight. For example, a blown-up balloon has volume but not mass. A stone has both volume and mass.\n\nBeing the representation of mass, volume is a sculptural quality. Volume is the most important of the three main kinds of tactual qualities in sculpture. It is the quality of all-roundness in a sculpture; the extension of a solid in all three-dimensions. When holding and surrounding an object with our hands, we appreciate its volume. Volume being a sculptural quality, it is a sensory property of three-dimensional form, and as such has nothing to do with the physical property that is measured in cubic inches and centimeters. A large version of a small sculpture does not have more volume. The size does not count – it is the way the sculpture was conceived and executed in the round that counts.\n\nClick on the link for a further explanation of Volume, Mass, and Three Dimensionality.\n\nArtist Inspirations\n\nFor this assignment we are taking inspiration from Arlene Shechet. Here is a short bio on the artist from Art 21.\n\nArlene Shechet was born in 1951 in New York City. Fascinated by the way things are made, Shechet likens her studio to both farm and factory. Employing an experimental approach to ceramic sculpture, she tests the limits of gravity, color, and texture by pushing against the boundary of classical techniques, sometimes fusing her kiln-fired creations with complex plinths formed of wood, steel, and concrete. By incorporating casts of firebricks and porcelain slip molds into her sculptures (revealing the tools of industry), she reflects on and investigates the tradition of decorative arts. Variously sensual, humorous, and elegant, her clay-based vessels evoke the tension between control and chaos, beauty and ugliness, perfection and imperfection. Considering herself an installation artist who happens to make objects, Shechet focuses intently on ensuring that the display, sight lines, and relationships of the objects in her exhibitions change with every view while maintaining formal equilibrium.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nKen Eastman\n\n“Eastman’s work centres around the idea of the vessel. He uses the vessel as a subject- to give meaning and form to an expression. Working through the medium of ceramics, Eastman can be both builder and painter; can handle shape and structure, as well as exploring tone and colour.\n\nAlison Britton has written of his work: -“Not being at all bothered about function, Eastman’s work with the pot form has been a consistent route into increasing abstraction, playing both with form and surface. That is what is potentially special about ceramics- you can have body and dress, sculpture and painting, essentially connected. Painting has always been a strong card for Eastman; he can be lyrical on the sheer walls of his objects. The gestures that are made with the brush are fluid and sensual, the colours rich and quiet.”\n\n“Part of the reason for making (in fact a very large part) is to see things that I have never seen before – to build something that I cannot fully understand or explain. ”\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nFrank Gehry\n\nIf you like Ken Eastman check out the work of Frank Gehry, an architect who was a master of capturing volume.\n\nOther Inspiration Images\n\nSOFT SLAB CONSTRUCTION\n\nThis short clip showcases the versatility and fun of working with soft slabs. I love the way she uses a template, her natural way of stretching and adjusting the soft slabs, and her use of gravity to add volume to these playful forms. This video is a must watch! You will learn lots of tricks from her method of working. Especially pay attention to how she adds volume by billowing out from the inside and by “plopping” the piece on the board."
