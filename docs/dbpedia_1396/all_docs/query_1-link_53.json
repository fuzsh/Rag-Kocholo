        "text": "Did you know that Campinas, in Brazil, hosts Sirius (https://lnkd.in/dDpimX-j), one of the most powerful synchrotron light sources in the planet, located at LNLS (https://lnkd.in/gZ3TZkka) in the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM)? If you never heard about synchrotron light sources, these particle accelerators are like very powerful microscopes that allow scientists and engineers to look at the structure of matter in great detail. Amongst many very interesting things in Sirius, they have been using open source hardware and software in many areas. If you want to learn more, at FOSForums 2023, the team from Sirius will be talking about \"Open Hardware at the Sirius Light Source\" and \"Open-source software at the Sirius light source\".\n\nüìÉScientific paper: Azimuthal fluctuations and number of muons at the ground in muon-depleted proton air showers at PeV energies Abstract: Muon counting is an effective strategy for discriminating between gamma and hadron-initiated air showers. However, their detection, which requires shielded detectors, is highly costly and almost impossible to implement in large $\\{\\rm km^2\\}$ environmentally sensitive areas. This work shows that the gamma/hadron discriminators, based on the new $LCm$ variable and the number of muons, have equivalent proton rejection levels at the PeV energies. It is, therefore, possible to build, at an affordable cost, a large, high-performant, wide field-of-view gamma-ray observatory.

The experiment, planned to be placed at an altitude greater than 4400 m, is primarily based on water Cherenkov detectors units and is expected to measure gamma rays from a few hundred GeV up to the PeV scale. SWGO will complement CTA and the existing ground-based particle detectors of the Northern Hemisphere, namely HAWC and LHAASO, having a rich science programme. The collaboration is highly invested in evaluating different detector and array configurations, prototyping, and site search. In this presentation, I shall present an overview of the project's activities, achievements and future plans. ;Comment: General overview presentation at the ICRC23 Continued on ES/IODE ‚û°Ô∏è https://etcse.fr/hXHq ------- If you find this interesting, feel free to follow, comment and share. We need your help to enhance our visibility, so that our platform continues to serve you.\n\nüìÉScientific paper: The Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory Abstract: The Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) is an R&D project to plan and design the next observatory to detect gamma rays in the Southern hemisphere.

MAX IV offers access to 16 beamlines that provide modern X-ray spectroscopy, scattering/diffraction, and imaging techniques to contribute to solving scientific questions in a wide range of areas. MAX IV is the first worldwide realisation of a fourth-generation light source, which has opened opportunities to develop experimental techniques based on outstanding brightness and coherence. The beamlines are open to academia, research institutes, industry, and government agencies worldwide through the user access programs. MAX IV welcomes 1700+ users annually, expected to double in the coming years. MAX IV collaborates with several of the light sources funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), including SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. https://lnkd.in/d9gsf6Xw #swedenscienceinnovation\n\nI'm very happy that our study, \"Toward an Operational Monitoring of Oak Dieback With Multispectral Satellite Time Series: A Case Study in Centre-Val De Loire Region of France\" has been published in IEEE JSTARS. This work was funded by the SYCOMORE program of R√©gion Centre-Val de Loire and was carried out in collaboration between the University of Orl√©ans and CESBIO. We show that it is possible to monitor oak dieback using Sentinel-2 imagery with good accuracy (OA and BA ~80%). We have developed an operational method that can be used to predict oak dieback over several years (past and future). Overall, both in situ data and model predictions showed evidence of forest decline in many areas of the study region. Our results suggest that large areas of forest can decline over short periods of time. I hope that our mapping system will be valuable to forest stakeholders in the region for years to come. https://lnkd.in/e--qjwYb\n\nThat's 800 Gigabits over a distance of approx 700km. Very decent! We need these speeds (bandwidth) to deal with future use, and sooner than many think. No general assertion of \"nnn is enough\" has ever proven true in the worlds of bandwidth, memory, or storage. Those who claim such nonsense anyway will (once again) hinder their organisation's or country's capability to innovate and compete.\n\nIn our recent conference paper, we elucidated an equation that adeptly computes the reflection from a cylindrical waveguide boundary into free space, utilizing spectral domain methodologies with the fundamental mode excitation. This framework posits that higher-order modes are locally stimulated at the boundary, and through our innovative approach, we have proficiently transmuted numerous double integrals into single ones, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our paper not only outlines the technique but also provides a deeper understanding of the integrals involved. We use mathematical tools like \"Lommel's integrals\" to intuitively navigate the singularities in the equations. This work was presented at the 2024 4th URSI Atlantic Radio Science Meeting (AT-RASC) in Gran Canaria, Spain, demonstrating our practical and theoretical advancements in waveguide analysis. It is a continuation of the work I did with my master's thesis back in 2020. https://lnkd.in/eM6jrJDY\n\none of our recent works is design and fabrication of Electron-beam accelerator in our lab , GERICO Gamma-ray research lab, but many asked me how you accelerate a tiny little electron? and how it works? the main reason to accelerate a particle is to give it a higher energy to inject this energy to another particle and force that particle to change the normal behavior to what you really want to do ! so , in our lab we are working hard to design tiny little accelerators in specific energy. I think we will announce soon our great results, in this way we shake other hands to exchange results and sharing scientific issues. but for those who want more information about accelerators this video about LHC being dedicated."
