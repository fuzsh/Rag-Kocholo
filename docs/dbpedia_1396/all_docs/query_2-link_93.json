That a human woman (on average shorter than a human man) was only waist-high to Horus puts him at 10-11 feet tall.

Alpharius and Omegon were the smallest, standing barely a head taller than an Astartes, with most being to an Astartes, what an Astartes is to a human. So let's put the average man at 6ft, and an Astartes at 7.5ft (most sources say 7-8ft, so we can assume 7.5ft for this demo) That's 1.5 feet taller, or 25% taller. We can then interpret this two ways;\n\n-The Primarchs could be 1.5ft bigger than Astartes, standing 9ft tall.\n\n-The Primarchs are 25% larger than Space Marines, standing 9.375ft tall, so roughly 9'4\", not a huge difference, but a number that increases as Space Marines get bigger.\n\nSo, in my opinion, going from HH descriptions, the average Primarch is about 9ft tall, With others on either side of the bell curve, Apharius Omegon on the far left, Magnus on the far right.\n\nAs for the Emperor, I can't help sorry. But as Psienesis said, he could change his own size, so we won't know.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nHallowed Canoness\n\nIreland\n\nBoy, that must suck not being able to ride in the tanks your army uses.\n\nBut I suppose this is the point where I should throw in that no, we do not have any sort of definite numbers, since very few things in 40k are definite. Rather, all we know and all we read is \"rumors, distorted legends and half-truths\", to quote Marc Gascoigne.\n\nAnd personally, the larger people are described as, and the more insane stunts they supposedly pull off, the more I am willing to believe it's one of those legends.\n\nIn the end, however, we all have to make our own call on that. There is no truth on this matter, merely opinions and preferences.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nBanelord Titan Princeps of Khorne\n\nNoctis Labyrinthus\n\nLion El'Jonson unarmoured is said to be a little above three meters tall, in Descent of Angels.\n\nAlso, Ogryns, who also can be three meters tall, can ride in chimeras, so ignore Lynata's insinuation that a Primarch can't fit in a tank.\n\nAlso, why are people assuming the Emperor is taller than his Primarchs? He's not, at base, he seems to be about equal in height. The Primarchs have varying sizes. Alpharius, the smallest, is the size of a big Marine. Magnus is the largest, and can further change his size.\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

With such massive chestplates and armoured bellies, you are only flexible so much. Not to mention the greatly enhanced arms and legs, etc. Unless of course we assume that it is the depictions of the appearances and armour that are exaggerated.\n\nAnd what conflicting information? At this level of detail, every second book that goes into that degree of detail will tell you something different. You know very well how this stuff works in 40k - just look at the many contradictory ideas of novel writers concerning the height of the standard Space Marine; cue Jes Goodwin's comment on \"them getting bigger with every new book\". I'm sure that the following posts will deliver sufficient examples for Primarchs, too.\n\nWhy are we even debating this, though? We both know there is no true common ground here.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nBanelord Titan Princeps of Khorne\n\nNoctis Labyrinthus\n\nI'd actually just assume that most writers, GW and BL, disregard what the armour actually looks and would function like.\n\nI'm sure they probably won't, personally. And any \"contradictions\" would only have relevance if it is the same Primarch being spoken of.\n\nThere is one statement on the height of a Primarch I have seen. Three meters outside of armour, and a head above Termie armoured astartes. That last part is parroted many times in many books.\n\nDebate doesn't need a purpose; the argument is its own purpose. You don't ask why a plague spreads or a field burns. Don't ask why I debate.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nAlluring Sorcerer of Slaanesh\n\nMagnus was the size of an Imperator Titan and used two as a chair.\n\nLorgar was the size of a large horse and Kor Phaeron used to ride him bare back.\n\nNo pity, no remorse, no shoes\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nSteadfast Ultramarine Sergeant\n\nLiverpool, England\n\nPilau Rice wrote:\n\nLorgar was the size of a large horse and Kor Phaeron used to ride him bare back.\n\nRaised as a Catholic, I think I'm allowed to have all these jokes going through my head.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nExecuting Exarch\n\nPilau Rice wrote:\n\nMagnus was the size of an Imperator Titan and used two as a chair.\n\nLorgar was the size of a large horse and Kor Phaeron used to ride him bare back.\n\nI liked Battle of the Fang - Magnus changing size so he could beat up a statue of Russ, while mocking it.\n\nYeah, take that you inanimate statue!\n\nMagnus = manly.\n\nBlacksails wrote:\n\nIts because ordinance is still a word.\n\nHowever, firing ordinance at someone isn't nearly as threatening as firing ordnance at someone.\n\nOrdinance is a local law, or bill, or other form of legislation.\n\nOrdnance is high caliber explosives.\n\nNo 'I' in ordnance.\n\nDon't drown the enemy in legislation, drown them in explosives.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nCourageous Space Marine Captain\n\nBrother Captain Alexander wrote:\n\nLet us say that Average Human is 2 meters tall...\n\nWut?

As for Primarchs, I've always imagined them as really big dudes, but still being able to interact somewhat normally with the human scale world, and anything past eight feet really is too big for that.\n\nSubject: Re:Primarch size?\n\nLongtime Dakkanaut\n\nHolland , Vermont\n\nWjy the heck does it even matter how tall the emperor is, he could look like this guy..\n\nAnd he would still be the frikken Emperor, as has been stated over and over again he's the most powerful human psycher yadda yadda.\n\nso he could be 5' nothing and a couch potato, and still turn you inside out through your anus!\n\nPersonally I like the idea of a little scmuck of a emperor, who down through the millenia has been \"inflated\"in stature by all his fanatical followers.\n\nhmmm I wonder if his bones on the throne are super sized too.\n\nSubject: Primarch size?\n\nWilling Inquisitorial Excruciator\n\nCroatia\n\nPilau Rice wrote:\n\nLorgar was the size of a large horse and Kor Phaeron used to ride him bare back.\n\nYipikaye mother.... btw totally agree...\n\nAlso I will add \"the bigger they are, the harder they fall\" (insert Magnus irony)....\n\nMy main question (which nobody gave me an answer) would be : HOW BIG ARE THE HEADS?\n\nPicture it: - normal head on 3,5 meter body - sucks; proportional head makes them easy target (insert Fulgrim sniped in AE)\n\nADB: I showed the Wolves revealing the key weakness at the heart of the World Eaters; showing Angron that his Legion was broken and worthless compared to the others; that he was the one primarch who couldn't trust his own warriors, and that they didn't care if he lived or died; showing that loyalty to brothers and sons is the heart of success for the Legiones Astartes, to the point even Lorgar makes a big deal out of saying the World Eaters and their primarch were massively outclassed by Russ, and Angron was too stupid to see the lesson Russ had sacrificed time, sweat, and blood, to teach. We're talking about a battle the Wolves won, by isolating the enemy general through pack tactics, and threatening to kill him, without a hope of defending himself. It was a balance, 50/50 - Angron overpowered Russ, and the Wolves were losing ground to the World Eaters; but Russ and his warriors had Angron by the balls, and barely broke a sweat. They won, no question. Lorgar even says: \"The Wolves won, meathead.\"\n\nDorn won’t help you either. He’s too busy being the Emperor’s groundskeeper, hiding behind the palace walls. The Wolf is too busy cutting off heads as our father’s executioner, while the Lion holds on to his secrets, and has no special fondness for you. Who else will come? Not Ferrus, certainly. Nor Corax either. Even as we speak, I suspect he flees for Deliverance. Sanguinius?’ Curze laughed cruelly. ‘The angel is more cursed than I. The Khan? He does not wish to be found. So who is left? No one, Vulkan. None of them will come. You are simply not that important. You are alone.’ Konrad Curze to Vulkan\n\nSubject: Re:Primarch size?\n\nGrey Knight Purgator firing around corners\n\nWarning, rants below!\n\nI always had the impression that the \"height\" matter in 40k is more a subjective impression (so to speak) than the objective feet'n'inches/metres'n'centimetres measure.\n\nThe fact that the Emperor is often described as someone not definite regarding dimensions or age (now young, then old, then middleaged...) had made me convinced that the size of astartes/primarchs/emperor is more than all a matter of awe.\n\nSo, why Alpharius/Omegon is the smaller of the primarch, whereas Magnus and Horus are so imposing?\n\nIt could be just for that. I mean, Alpharius relies on cunning, on the fact that any Legionnaire 'is Alpharius'... so, he's as big as astartes, seems slightly bigger when you realize it's him, else he does not want to stand out.\n\nOn the other side Hours is charismatic and proud of himself (hubris most of all is is flaw, innit?) and Magnus knows his mind is the (second) most powerful (at least in the Imperium), so you can have a 'bigger' perception of them (and people might unconsciously cringe (sort of) before such generals).\n\nMoreover, Imperium feels to me nearly obsessed with objects being standard, so PA are 'one size', adjustable on the inside within some limits. Also, since an Astartes may simply be promoted to terminator (or, as in GK case, they may wear both at any time) TDA can not be so much bigger than the normal one. Bulkier, more menacing, but not necessarily bigger.\n\nYou kind of see it when you see (well done) PA cosplays vs not armored people. 'Marines' are normal people, there, but they still seem way bigger.\n\nAlso, in earlier editions, I think I read something about the marine weighting about 10% more of a normal man, upon completing the augmentations. Subtract from this the black carapace, the mass increase of hyper-dense bones... we're not so much apart in size.\n\nBut, when you see a Marine (even unarmoured) that can spar for twelve hours without breaking a sweat, who can march and fight for a week without sleeping, you may naturally and unconsciously 'enlarge' his figure, because his being too much superoministic to be like a normal human.\n\n\"Upgrading\" this thread of insan.. *cough* of thoughts, let's see three examples (Spoiler, since I review albeit vaguely, pieces from two HH books)\n\nSpoiler:\n\nExample 1. Guilliman.\n\nApart the fact that he normally multitasks things that would require a dozen people...\n\nHe's unhelmeted on the bridge when it explodes.\n\nNot only he survives the explosion, but he reenters on a bay, from vacuum, stil w/o helmet, and saves the day.\n\nExample 2. Sanguinius (If I'm not mistaking with another primarch, I read too many books in a row :p)\n\nIn an access of rage, he backhands a marine, beheading him.\n\nExample 3. Horus.\n\nIf he was so much bigger than Astartes/Terminators, there is no way that the Vindicare in Nemesis could target the wrong person.\n\n\"Looks like I aimed and shot a 7' man instead of a 10' one. Well, oops?\" - seriously?\n\nPeople capable of such things, are \"inflated\" in our perception.\n\nAnd all the Imperium knows what they are capable of.\n\nAnd all the enemies fear what they are capable of, no matter how defiant they appear.\n\nOk, I'm done with this rant, I think\n\n2270 (1725 painted)\n\n1978 (180 painted)\n\n329 (280ish)\n\n705 (0)\n\n193 (0)\n\n165 (0)\n\n:assassins: 855 (540)\n\nSubject: Re:Primarch size?\n\nFlashy Flashgitz\n\nI will just go with what i read,..\n\na normal human has to look up to lock eye contact with an astartes,... so yeah they are big.\n\nAn Astartes has to look up to lock eyes with his primarch before his knees will give out and he will bow like a little b*atch..\n\nIn some occasions when reading it seems the Emperor to be as tall as a Primarch or bigger.. I dont care which it is cause daaaayumn! Hes huge!"
