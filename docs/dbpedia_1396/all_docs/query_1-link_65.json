        "text": "The following problem was posed by Erdös and Graham (and is listed as problem #437 on the Erdös problems website):\n\nProblem 1 Let be integers. How many of the partial products , , , can be squares? Is it true that, for any , there can be more than squares?\n\nIf one lets denote the maximal number of squares amongst such partial products, it was observed in the paper of Erdös and Graham that the bound is “trivial” (no proof was provided, but one can for instance argue using the fact that the number of integer solutions to hyperelliptic equations of the form for fixed is quite sparse, and in fact finite for thanks to Siegel’s theorem), and the problem then asks if .\n\nIt turns out that this problem was essentially solved (though not explicitly) by a recently published paper of Bui, Pratt, and Zaharescu, who studied a closely related quantity introduced by Erdös, Graham, and Selfridge (see also Problem B30 of Guy’s book), defined for any natural number as the least natural number such that some subset of , when multiplied together with , produced a square. Among the several results proven about in that paper was the following:\n\nTheorem 2 (Bui–Pratt–Zaharescu, Theorem 1.2) For sufficiently large, there exist integers such that .\n\nThe arguments were in fact quite elementary, with the main tool being the theory of smooth numbers (the theory of hyperelliptic equations is used elsewhere in the paper, but not for this particular result).\n\nIf one uses this result as a “black box”, then an easy greedy algorithm argument gives the lower bound\n\nbut with a small amount of additional work, one can modify the proof of the theorem to give a slightly better bound:\n\nTheorem 3 (Bounds for ) As , we have the lower bound and the upper bound In particular, for any , one has for sufficiently large .\n\nThe purpose of this blog post is to record this modification of the argument, which is short enough to present immediately. For a large , let denote the quantity\n\nWe call a natural number -smooth if all of its prime factors are at most . From a result of Hildebrand (or the older results of de Bruijn), we know that the number of -smooth numbers less than or equal to is Let be the number of primes up to . From the prime number theorem we have\n\nTo prove the lower bound on , which is a variant of Theorem 2. The key observation is that given any -smooth numbers , some non-trivial subcollection of them will multiply to a square. This is essentially Lemma 4.2 of Bui–Pratt–Zaharescu, but for the convenience of the reader we give a full proof here. Consider the multiplicative homomorphism defined by\n\nwhere is the prime and is the number of times divides . The vectors lie in a -dimensional vector space over , and thus are linearly dependent. Thus there exists a non-trivial collection of these vectors that sums to zero, which implies that the corresponding elements of the sequence multiply to a square.\n\nFrom (1), (2) we can find sequences of -smooth numbers in , with each sequence being to the right of the previous sequence. By the above observation, each sequence contains some non-trivial subcollection that multiplies to a square. Concatenating all these subsequences together, we obtain a single sequence with at least partial products multiplying to a square, giving the desired lower bound on .\n\nNext, we prove the upper bound on . Suppose that a sequence has partial products that are squares for some . Then we have a square for all (with the convention ). The key observation (essentially Lemma 3.4 of Bui–Pratt–Zaharescu) is that, for each , one of the following must hold:\n\n(i) At least one of the is -smooth.\n\n(ii) At least one of the is divisible by for some prime .\n\n(iii) .\n\nIndeed, suppose that (i) and (ii) are not true, then one of the terms in the sequence is divisible by exactly one copy of for some prime . In order for the product to be a square, another element of the sequence must also be divisible by the same prime; but this implies (iii).\n\nFrom (1) we see that the number of for which (i) occurs is at most . From the union bound we see that the number of for which (ii) occurs is at most\n\nFinally, from the pigeonhole principle we see that the number of for which (iii) occurs is also at most Thus one has , as desired. This completes the proof.\n\nThe upper bound arguments seem more crude to the author than the lower bound arguments, so I conjecture that the lower bound is in fact the truth: .\n\nIn a previous blog post, I discussed how, from a Bayesian perspective, learning about some new information can update one’s perceived odds about how likely an “alternative hypothesis” is, compared to a “null hypothesis” . The mathematical formula here is Thus, provided one has\n\n(i) A precise formulation of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis , and the new information ;\n\n(ii) A reasonable estimate of the prior odds of the alternative hypothesis being true (compared to the null hypothesis );\n\n(iii) A reasonable estimate of the probability that the event would occur under the null hypothesis ; and\n\n(iv) A reasonable estimate of the probability that the event would occur under the alternative hypothesis ,\n\none can then obtain an estimate of the posterior odds of the alternative hypothesis being true after observing the event . Ingredient (iii) is usually the easiest to compute, but is only one of the key inputs required; ingredients (ii) and (iv) are far trickier, involve subjective non-mathematical considerations, and as discussed in the previous post, depend rather crucially on ingredient (i). For instance, selectively reporting some relevant information for , and witholding other key information from , can make the final mathematical calculation misleading with regard to the “true” odds of being true compared to based on all available information, even if the calculation was technically accurate with regards to the partial information provided. Also, the computation of the relative odds of two competing hypotheses and can become somewhat moot if there is a third hypothesis that ends up being more plausible than either of these two hypotheses. Nevertheless, the formula (1) can still lead to useful conclusions, albeit ones that are qualified by the particular assumptions and estimates made in the analysis.\n\nAt a qualitative level, the Bayesian identity (1) is telling us the following: if an alternative hypothesis was already somewhat plausible (so that the prior odds was not vanishingly small), and the observed event was significantly more likely to occur under hypothesis than under , then the hypothesis becomes significantly more plausible (in that the posterior odds become quite elevated). This is quite intuitive, but as discussed in the previous post, a lot hinges on how one is defining the alternative hypothesis .\n\nIn the previous blog post, this calculation was initially illustrated with the following choices of , , and (thus fulfilling ingredient (i)):\n\nwas the event that the October 1, 2022 PSCO Grand Lotto in the Phillippines drew the numbers (that is to say, consecutive multiples if ), though not necessarily in that order;\n\nwas the null hypothesis that the lottery was fair and the numbers were drawn uniformly at random (without replacement) from the set ; and\n\nwas the alternative hypothesis that the lottery was rigged by some corrupt officials for their personal gain.\n\nIn this case, ingredient (iii) can be computed mathematically and precisely: And, with a not inconceivable level of cynicism about the integrity of the lottery, the prior odds (ingredient (ii)) can be argued to be non-negligible. However, ingredient (iv) was nearly impossible to estimate: indeed, as argued in that post, there is no reason to suspect that is much larger than the tiny probability (2), and in fact it could well be smaller (since would likely be in the interest of corrupt lottery officials to not draw attention to their activities). So, despite the very small numerical value of the probability (2), this did not lead to any significant increase in the odds of the alternative hypothesis. In the previous blog post, several other variants , , of the alternative hypothesis were also discussed; the conclusion was that while some choices of alternative hypothesis could lead to elevated probabilities for ingredient (iv), they came at the cost of significantly reducing the prior odds in ingredient (ii), and so no alternative hypothesis was located which ended up being significantly more plausible than the null hypothesis after observing the event .\n\nIn this post, I would like to run the same analysis on a numerical anomaly in the recent Venezuelan presidential election of June 28, 2024. Here are the officially reported vote totals for the two main candidates, incumbent president Nicolás Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo González, in the election:\n\nMaduro: 5,150,092 votes\n\nGonzález: 4,445,978 votes\n\nOther: 462,704 votes\n\nTotal: 10,058,774 votes.\n\nThe numerical anomaly is that if one multiplies the total number of voters by the round percentages , , , one recovers exactly the above vote counts after rounding to the nearest integer:\n\nLet us try to apply the above Bayesian framework to this situation, bearing in mind the caveats that this analysis is only strong as the inputs supplied and assumptions made (for instance, to simplify the discussion, we will not also discuss information from exit polling, which in this case gave significantly different predictions from the percentages above).\n\nThe first step (ingredient (i)) is to formulate the null hypothesis , the alternative hypothesis , and the event . Here is one possible choice:\n\nis the event that the reported vote total for Maduro, González, and Other are all equal to the nearest integer of the total number of voters, multiplied by a round percentage with one decimal point (i.e., an integer multiple of ).\n\nis the null hypothesis that the vote totals were reported accurately (or with only inconsequential inaccuracies).\n\nis the alternative hypothesis that the vote totals were manipulated by officials from the incumbent administration.\n\nIngredient (ii) – the prior odds that is true over – is highly subjective, and an individual’s estimation of (ii) would likely depend on, or at least be correlated with, their opinion of the current Venezulan administration. Discussion of this ingredient is therefore more political than mathematical, and I will not attempt to quantify it further here. Now we turn to (iii), the estimation of the probability that occurs given the hypothesis . This cannot be computed exactly without a precise probabilistic model of the voting electorate, but let us make a rough order of magnitude calculation as follows. One can focus on the anomaly just for the number of votes received by Maduro and González, since if both of these counts were the nearest integer to a round percentages then just from simple subtraction the number of votes for “other” would also be forced to also be the nearest integer from a round percentage, possibly plus or minus one due to carries, so up to a factor of two or so we can ignore the latter anomaly. As a simple model, suppose that the voting percentages for Maduro and González were distributed more or less uniformly in some square , where are some proportions not too close to either or , and is some reasonably large margin of error (the exact values of these parameters will end up not being too important, nor will the specific shape of the distribution; indeed, the shape and size of the square here only impacts the analysis through the area of the square, and even this quantity cancels itself out in the end). Thus, the number of votes for Maduro is distributed in an interval of length about , where is the number of voters, and similarly for González, so the total number of different outcomes here is , and by our model we have a uniform distribution amongst all these outcomes. On the other hand, the total number of attainable round percentages for Maduro is about , and similarly for González, so our estimate for is\n\nThis looks quite unlikely! But we are not done yet, because we also need to estimate , the probability that the event would occur under the alternative hypothesis . Here one has to be careful, because while it could happen under hypothesis that the vote counts were manipulated to be exactly the nearest integer to a round percentage, this is not the only outcome under this hypothesis, and indeed one could argue that it would not be in the interest of an administration to generate such a striking numerical anomaly. But one can create a reasonable chain of events with which to estimate (from below) this probability by a kind of “Drake equation“. Consider the following variants of :\n\n: is true, and the administration directs election officials to report vote outcomes with some explicitly preferred (round) percentages, regardless of the actual election results.\n\n: is true, and the election officials dutifully generate a report by multiplying these preferred percentages by the total number of voters, and rounding to the nearest integer, without any attempt to disguise their actions.\n\nBy the chain rule for conditional probability, one has a lower bound Inserting this into (1), we obtain our final lower bound: This is about as far as one can get purely with mathematical analysis. Beyond this, one has to make some largely subjective estimations for each of the remaining probabilities and odds in this formula. As mentioned, the prior odds will likely depend on the individual making this calculation, and will not be discussed further here. The remaining question then is how large the probabilities , , and are. In other words:\n\nIf one assumes that the administration wishes to manipulate the vote totals, how likely is it a priori (i.e., without being aware of the anomaly ) that they would do so by explictly selecting preferred round percentages and then requesting that election officials report these percentages?\n\nIf one assumes that election officials are being ordered to report vote totals to reflect a preferred round percentage, how likely is it a priori that they would follow the orders without question, and performing simple rounding instead of any more sophisticated numerical manipulation?\n\nIf one assumes that election officials did indeed follow the orders as above, how likely is it a priori that the report would be published as is without any concerns raised by other officials or observers?\n\nIf one’s estimate of the product of these three probabilities multiplies to be significantly greater than , then we can conclude that the event has indeed significantly raised the odds of some sort of voting manipulation present. The scenario described above is somewhat plausible, especially in light of the anomaly , and so certainly the posterior probabilities , seem quite large (and the posterior probability is of course equal to ). But it is important here to avoid confirmation bias and work only with a priori probabilities – roughly speaking, the probabilities that one would assign to such events on July 27, 2024, before knowledge of the anomaly came to light. Nevertheless, even after accounting for confirmation bias, I think it is plausible that the above product of a priori probabilities is indeed significantly larger than (for instance, to assign probabilities somewhat randomly, this would be the case of each of the conditional probabilities , and all exceed ), giving credence to the theory of the election report being manipulated (though it is possible that the manipulation could occur through a third hypothesis not covered by the original two hypotheses, such as a software glitch). If one adds in additional information beyond the purely numerical anomaly , such as the fact that the reported totals were not broken down further by voting district (which would be less likely under hypothesis than hypothesis ), and that exit polls gave significantly different results from the reported totals (which is again less likely under hypothesis than hypothesis ), the evidence for voting irregularities becomes quite significant.\n\nOne can contrast this analysis with that of the Phillipine lottery in the original post. In both cases the probability of the observed event under the null hypothesis was extremely small. However, in the case of the Venezuelan election, there is a plausible causal chain that leads to an elevated probability of the observed event under the alternative hypothesis, whereas in the case of the lottery, only extremely implausible chains could be constructed that would lead to the specific outcome of a multiples-of-9 lottery draw for that specific lottery on that specific date.\n\nI’ve just uploaded to the arXiv my paper “Dense sets of natural numbers with unusually large least common multiples“. This short paper answers (in the negative) a somewhat obscure question of Erdős and Graham:\n\nProblem 1 Is it true that if is a set of natural numbers for which goes to infinity as , then the quantity also goes to infinity as ?\n\nAt first glance, this problem may seem rather arbitrary, but it can be motivated as follows. The hypothesis that (1) goes to infinity is a largeness condition on ; in view of Mertens’ theorem, it can be viewed as an assertion that is denser than the set of primes. On the other hand, the conclusion that (2) grows is an assertion that becomes significantly larger than on the average for large ; that is to say, that many pairs of numbers in share a common factor. Intuitively, the problem is then asking whether sets that are significantly denser than the primes must start having lots of common factors on average.\n\nFor sake of comparison, it is easy to see that if (1) goes to infinity, then at least one pair of distinct elements in must have a non-trivial common factor. For if this were not the case, then the elements of are pairwise coprime, so each prime has at most one multiple in , and so can contribute at most to the sum in (1), and hence by Mertens’ theorem, and the fact that every natural number greater than one is divisible by at least one prime , the quantity (1) stays bounded, a contradiction.\n\nIt turns out, though, that the answer to the above problem is negative; one can find sets that are denser than the primes, but for which (2) stays bounded, so that the least common multiples in the set are unusually large. It was a bit surprising to me that this question had not been resolved long ago (in fact, I was not able to find any prior literature on the problem beyond the original reference of Erdős and Graham); in contrast, another problem of Erdős and Graham concerning sets with unusually small least common multiples was extensively studied (and essentially solved) about twenty years ago, while the study of sets with unusually large greatest common divisor for many pairs in the set has recently become somewhat popular, due to their role in the proof of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard.\n\nTo search for counterexamples, it is natural to look for numbers with relatively few prime factors, in order to reduce their common factors and increase their least common multiple. A particularly simple example, whose verification is on the level of an exercise in a graduate analytic number theory course, is the set of semiprimes (products of two primes), for which one can readily verify that (1) grows like but (2) stays bounded. With a bit more effort, I was able to optimize the construction and uncover the true threshold for boundedness of (2), which was a little unexpected:\n\nTheorem 2\n\n(i) For any , there exists a set of natural numbers with for all large , for which (2) stays bounded.\n\n(ii) Conversely, if (2) stays bounded, then for all large .\n\nThe proofs are not particularly long or deep, but I thought I would record here some of the process towards finding them. My first step was to try to simplify the condition that (2) stays bounded. In order to use probabilistic intuition, I first expressed this condition in probabilistic terms as\n\nfor large , where are independent random variables drawn from with probability density function The presence of the least common multiple in the denominator is annoying, but one can easily flip the expression to the greatest common divisor: If the expression was a product of a function of and a function of , then by independence this expectation would decouple into simpler averages involving just one random variable instead of two. Of course, the greatest common divisor is not of this form, but there is a standard trick in analytic number theory to decouple the greatest common divisor, namely to use the classic Gauss identity , with the Euler totient function, to write Inserting this formula and interchanging the sum and expectation, we can now express the condition as bounding a sum of squares: Thus, the condition (2) is really an assertion to the effect that typical elements of do not have many divisors. From experience in sieve theory, the probabilities tend to behave multiplicatively in , so the expression here heuristically behaves like an Euler product that looks something like and so the condition (2) is morally something like Comparing this with the Mertens’ theorems, this leads to the heuristic prediction that (for a typical prie much smaller than ) should decay somewhat like (ignoring for now factors of ). This can be compared to the example of the set of primes or semiprimes on one hand, where the probability is like , and the set of all natural numbers on the other hand, where the probability is like . So the critical behavior should come from sets that are in some sense “halfway” between the primes and the natural numbers.\n\nIt is then natural to try a random construction, in which one sieves out the natural numbers by permitting each natural number to survive with a probability resembling , in order to get the predicted behavior for . Performing some standard calculations, this construction could ensure (2) bounded with a density a little bit less than the one stated in the main theorem; after optimizing the parameters, I could only get something like\n\nI was stuck on optimising the construction further, so I turned my attention to a positive result in the spirit of (ii) of the main theorem. On playing around with (3), I observed that one could use Cauchy-Schwarz and Mertens’ theorem to obtain the bound which was in line with the previous heuristic that should behave like . The left-hand side had a simple interpretation: by linearity of expectation, it was the expected number of prime factors of . So the boundedness of (2) implied that a typical element of only had about prime factors, in contrast to the predicted by the Hardy-Ramanujan law. Standard methods from the anatomy of integers can then be used to see how dense a set with that many prime factors could be, and this soon led to a short proof of part (ii) of the main theorem (I eventually found for instance that Jensen’s inequality could be used to create a particularly slick argument).\n\nIt then remained to improve the lower bound construction to eliminate the losses in the exponents. By deconstructing the proof of the upper bound, it became natural to consider something like the set of natural numbers that had at most prime factors. This construction actually worked for some scales – namely those for which was a natural number – but there was some strange “discontinuities” in the analysis that prevented me from establishing the boundedness of (2) for arbitrary scales . The basic problem was that increasing the number of permitted prime factors from one natural number threshold to another ended up increasing the density of the set by an unbounded factor (of the order of , in practice), which heavily disrupted the task of trying to keep the ratio (2) bounded. Usually the resolution to these sorts of discontinuities is to use some sort of random “average” of two or more deterministic constructions – for instance, by taking some random union of some numbers with prime factors and some numbers with prime factors – but the numerology turned out to be somewhat unfavorable, allowing for some improvement in the lower bounds over my previous construction, but not enough to close the gap entirely. It was only after substantial trial and error that I was able to find a working deterministic construction, where at a given scale one collected either numbers with at most prime factors, or numbers with prime factors but with the largest prime factor in a specific range, in which I could finally get the numerator and denominator in (2) to be in balance for every . But once the construction was written down, the verification of the required properties ended up being quite routine.\n\nMany modern mathematical proofs are a combination of conceptual arguments and technical calculations. There is something of a tradeoff between the two: one can add more conceptual arguments to try to reduce the technical computations, or vice versa. (Among other things, this leads to a Berkson paradox-like phenomenon in which a negative correlation can be observed between the two aspects of a proof; see this recent Mastodon post of mine for more discussion.)\n\nIn a recent article, Heather Macbeth argues that the preferred balance between conceptual and computational arguments is quite different for a computer-assisted proof than it is for a purely human-readable proof. In the latter, there is a strong incentive to minimize the amount of calculation to the point where it can be checked by hand, even if this requires a certain amount of ad hoc rearrangement of cases, unmotivated parameter selection, or otherwise non-conceptual additions to the arguments in order to reduce the calculation. But in the former, once one is willing to outsource any tedious verification or optimization task to a computer, the incentives are reversed: freed from the need to arrange the argument to reduce the amount of calculation, one can now describe an argument by listing the main ingredients and then letting the computer figure out a suitable way to combine them to give the stated result. The two approaches can thus be viewed as complementary ways to describe a result, with neither necessarily being superior to the other.\n\nIn this post, I would like to illustrate this computation-outsourced approach with the topic of zero-density theorems for the Riemann zeta function, in which all computer verifiable calculations (as well as other routine but tedious arguments) are performed “off-stage”, with the intent of focusing only on the conceptual inputs to these theorems.\n\nZero-density theorems concern upper bounds for the quantity for a given and large , which is defined as the number of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function in the rectangle . (There is also an important generalization of this quantity to -functions, but for simplicity we will focus on the classical zeta function case here). Such quantities are important in analytic number theory for many reasons, one of which is through explicit formulae such as the Riemann-von Mangoldt explicit formula relating the prime numbers to the zeroes of the zeta function (the “music of the primes”). The better bounds one has on , the more control one has on the complicated term on the right-hand side.\n\nClearly is non-increasing in . The Riemann-von Mangoldt formula, together with the functional equation, gives us the asymptotic\n\nin the case, while the prime number theorem tells us that The various zero free regions for the zeta function can be viewed as slight improvements to (2); for instance, the classical zero-free region is equivalent to the assertion that vanishes if for some small absolute constant , and the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that for all .\n\nExperience has shown that the most important quantity to control here is the exponent , defined as the least constant for which one has an asymptotic\n\nas . Thus, for instance, , and is a non-increasing function of , so we obtain the trivial “von Mangoldt” zero density theorem Of particular interest is the supremal value of , which has to be at least thanks to (3). The density hypothesis asserts that the maximum is in fact exactly , or equivalently that for all . This is of course implied by the Riemann hypothesis (which clearly implies that for all ), but is a more tractable hypothesis to work with; for instance, the hypothesis is already known to hold for by the work of Bourgain (building upon many previous authors). The quantity directly impacts our understanding of the prime number theorem in short intervals; indeed, it is not difficult using (1) (as well as the Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region) to establish a short interval prime number theorem for all if is a fixed exponent, or for almost all if is a fixed exponent. Until recently, the best upper bound for was , thanks to a 1972 result of Huxley; but this was recently lowered to in a breakthrough work of Guth and Maynard.\n\nIn between the papers of Huxley and Guth-Maynard are dozens of additional improvements on , though it is only the Guth-Maynard paper that actually lowered the supremum norm . A summary of most of the state of the art before Guth-Maynard may be found in Table 2 of this recent paper of Trudgian and Yang; it is complicated, but it is easy enough to get a computer to illustrate it with a plot:\n\n(For an explanation of what is going on under the assumption of the Lindelöf hypothesis, see below the fold.) This plot represents the combined effort of nearly a dozen papers, each one of which claims one or more components of the depicted piecewise smooth curve, and is written in the “human-readable” style mentioned above, where the argument is arranged to reduce the amount of tedious computation to human-verifiable levels, even if this comes the cost of obscuring the conceptual ideas. (For an animation of how this bound improved over time, see here.) Below the fold, I will try to describe (in sketch form) some of the standard ingredients that go into these papers, in particular the routine reduction of deriving zero density estimates from large value theorems for Dirichlet series. We will not attempt to rewrite the entire literature of zero-density estimates in this fashion, but focus on some illustrative special cases.\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\n[This post is dedicated to Luca Trevisan, who recently passed away due to cancer. Though far from his most significant contribution to the field, I would like to mention that, as with most of my other blog posts on this site, this page was written with the assistance of Luca’s LaTeX to WordPress converter. Mathematically, his work and insight on pseudorandomness in particular have greatly informed how I myself think about the concept. – T.]\n\nRecently, Timothy Gowers, Ben Green, Freddie Manners, and I were able to establish the following theorem:\n\nTheorem 1 (Marton’s conjecture) Let be non-empty with . Then there exists a subgroup of with such that is covered by at most translates of , for some absolute constant .\n\nWe established this result with , although it has since been improved to by Jyun-Jie Liao.\n\nOur proof was written in order to optimize the constant as much as possible; similarly for the more detailed blueprint of the proof that was prepared in order to formalize the result in Lean. I have been asked a few times whether it is possible to present a streamlined and more conceptual version of the proof in which one does not try to establish an explicit constant , but just to show that the result holds for some constant . This is what I will attempt to do in this post, though some of the more routine steps will be outsourced to the aforementioned blueprint.\n\nThe key concept here is that of the entropic Ruzsa distance between two random variables taking values , defined as\n\nwhere are independent copies of , and denotes the Shannon entropy of . This distance is symmetric and non-negative, and obeys the triangle inequality for any random variables ; see the blueprint for a proof. The above theorem then follows from an entropic analogue:\n\nTheorem 2 (Entropic Marton’s conjecture) Let be a -valued random variable with . Then there exists a uniform random variable on a subgroup of such that for some absolute constant .\n\nWe were able to establish Theorem 2 with , which implies Theorem 1 with by fairly standard additive combinatorics manipulations (such as the Ruzsa covering lemma); see the blueprint for details.\n\nThe key proposition needed to establish Theorem 2 is the following distance decrement property:\n\nProposition 3 (Distance decrement) If are -valued random variables, then one can find -valued random variables such that and for some absolute constants .\n\nIndeed, suppose this proposition held. Starting with both equal to and iterating, one can then find sequences of random variables with ,\n\nand In particular, from the triangle inequality and geometric series By weak compactness, some subsequence of the , converge to some limiting random variables , and by some simple continuity properties of entropic Ruzsa distance, we conclude that and Theorem 2 then follows from the “100% inverse theorem” for entropic Ruzsa distance; see the blueprint for details.\n\nTo prove Proposition 3, we can reformulate it as follows:\n\nProposition 4 (Lack of distance decrement implies vanishing) If are -valued random variables, with the property that for all -valued random variables and some sufficiently small absolute constant , then one can derive a contradiction.\n\nIndeed, we may assume from the above proposition that\n\nfor some , which will imply Proposition 3 with .\n\nThe entire game is now to use Shannon entropy inequalities and “entropic Ruzsa calculus” to deduce a contradiction from (1) for small enough. This we will do below the fold, but before doing so, let us first make some adjustments to (1) that will make it more useful for our purposes. Firstly, because conditional entropic Ruzsa distance (see blueprint for definitions) is an average of unconditional entropic Ruzsa distance, we can automatically upgrade (1) to the conditional version\n\nfor any random variables that are possibly coupled with respectively. In particular, if we define a “relevant” random variable (conditioned with respect to some auxiliary data ) to be a random variable for which or equivalently (by the triangle inequality) then we have the useful lower bound whenever and are relevant conditioning on respectively. This is quite a useful bound, since the laws of “entropic Ruzsa calculus” will tell us, roughly speaking, that virtually any random variable that we can create from taking various sums of copies of and conditioning against other sums, will be relevant. (Informally: the space of relevant random variables is -separated with respect to the entropic Ruzsa distance.)\n\n— 1. Main argument —\n\nNow we derive more and more consequences of (2) – at some point crucially using the hypothesis that we are in characteristic two – before we reach a contradiction.\n\nRight now, our hypothesis (2) only supplies lower bounds on entropic distances. The crucial ingredient that allows us to proceed is what we call the fibring identity, which lets us convert these lower bounds into useful upper bounds as well, which in fact match up very nicely when is small. Informally, the fibring identity captures the intuitive fact that the doubling constant of a set should be at least as large as the doubling constant of the image of that set under a homomorphism, times the doubling constant of a typical fiber of that homomorphism; and furthermore, one should only be close to equality if the fibers “line up” in some sense.\n\nHere is the fibring identity:\n\nProposition 5 (Fibring identity) Let be a homomorphism. Then for any independent -valued random variables , one has\n\nThe proof is of course in the blueprint, but given that it is a central pillar of the argument, I reproduce it here.\n\nProof: Expanding out the definition of Ruzsa distance, and using the conditional entropy chain rule\n\nand it suffices to establish the identity But from the chain rule again we have and from the definition of conditional mutual information (using the fact that is determined both by and by ) one has giving the claim.\n\nWe will only care about the characteristic setting here, so we will now assume that all groups involved are -torsion, so that we can replace all subtractions with additions. If we specialize the fibring identity to the case where , , is the addition map , and , are pairs of independent random variables in , we obtain the following corollary:\n\nCorollary 6 Let be independent -valued random variables. Then we have the identity\n\nThis is a useful and flexible identity, especially when combined with (2). For instance, we can discard the conditional mutual information term as being non-negative, to obtain the inequality\n\nIf we let be independent copies of respectively (note the swap in the last two variables!) we obtain From entropic Ruzsa calculus, one can check that , , and are all relevant random variables, so from (2) we now obtain both upper and lower bounds for : A pleasant upshot of this is that we now get to work in the symmetric case without loss of generality. Indeed, if we set , we now have from (2) that whenever are relevant, which by entropic Ruzsa calculus is equivalent to asking that\n\nNow we use the fibring identity again, relabeling as and requiring to be independent copies of . We conclude that\n\nAs before, the random variables , , , are all relevant, so from (3) we have We could now also match these lower bounds with upper bounds, but the more important takeaway from this analysis is a really good bound on the conditional mutual information: By the data processing inequality, we can discard some of the randomness here, and conclude Let us introduce the random variables then we have Intuitively, this means that and are very nearly independent given . For sake of argument, let us assume that they are actually independent; one can achieve something resembling this by invoking the entropic Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem, established in the blueprint, after conceding some losses of in the entropy, but we skip over the details for this blog post. The key point now is that because we are in characteristic , has the same form as or : In particular, by permutation symmetry, we have and so by the definition of conditional Ruzsa distance we have a massive distance decrement (where is drawn from the distribution of ), contradicting (1) as desired. (In reality, we end up decreasing the distance not all the way to zero, but instead to due to losses in the Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem, but this is still enough to reach a contradiction. The quantity is very similar to , but is slightly different; the latter quantity is .)\n\nRemark 7 A similar argument works in the -torsion case for general . Instead of decrementing the entropic Ruzsa distance, one instead decrements a “multidistance” for independent . By an iterated version of the fibring identity, one can first reduce again to the symmetric case where the random variables are all copies of the same variable . If one then takes , to be an array of copies of , one can get to the point where the row sums and the column sums have small conditional mutual information with respect to the double sum . If we then set and , the data processing inequality again shows that and are nearly independent given . The -torsion now crucially intervenes as before to ensure that has the same form as or , leading to a contradiction as before. See this previous blog post for more discussion.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to report an erratum to the 2012 paper “An inverse theorem for the Gowers -norm” of Ben Green, myself, and Tamar Ziegler (previously discussed in this blog post). The main results of this paper have been superseded with stronger quantitative results, first in work of Manners (using somewhat different methods), and more recently in a remarkable paper of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney which combined the methods of our paper with several new innovations to obtain quite strong bounds (of quasipolynomial type); see also an alternate proof of our main results (again by quite different methods) by Candela and Szegedy. In the course of their work, they discovered some fixable but nontrivial errors in our paper. These (rather technical) issues were already implicitly corrected in this followup work which supersedes our own paper, but for the sake of completeness we are also providing a formal erratum for our original paper, which can be found here. We thank Leng, Sah, and Sawhney for bringing these issues to our attention.\n\nExcluding some minor (mostly typographical) issues which we also have reported in this erratum, the main issues stemmed from a conflation of two notions of a degree filtration\n\nof a group , which is a nested sequence of subgroups that obey the relation for all . The weaker notion (sometimes known as a prefiltration) permits the group to be strictly smaller than , while the stronger notion requires and to equal. In practice, one can often move between the two concepts, as is always normal in , and a prefiltration behaves like a filtration on every coset of (after applying a translation and perhaps also a conjugation). However, we did not clarify this issue sufficiently in the paper, and there are some places in the text where results that were only proven for filtrations were applied for prefiltrations. The erratum fixes this issues, mostly by clarifying that we work with filtrations throughout (which requires some decomposition into cosets in places where prefiltrations are generated). Similar adjustments need to be made for multidegree filtrations and degree-rank filtrations, which we also use heavily on our paper.\n\nIn most cases, fixing this issue only required minor changes to the text, but there is one place (Section 8) where there was a non-trivial problem: we used the claim that the final group was a central group, which is true for filtrations, but not necessarily for prefiltrations. This fact (or more precisely, a multidegree variant of it) was used to claim a factorization for a certain product of nilcharacters, which is in fact not true as stated. In the erratum, a substitute factorization for a slightly different product of nilcharacters is provided, which is still sufficient to conclude the main result of this part of the paper (namely, a statistical linearization of a certain family of nilcharacters in the shift parameter ).\n\nAgain, we stress that these issues do not impact the paper of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney, as they adapted the methods in our paper in a fashion that avoids these errors.\n\nA recent paper of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson established the following theorem, resolving a question of Erdös. Given a discrete amenable group , and a subset of , we define the Banach density of to be the quantity\n\nwhere the supremum is over all Følner sequences of . Given a set in , we define the restricted sumset to be the set of all pairs where are distinct elements of .\n\nTheorem 1 Let be a countably infinite abelian group with the index finite. Let be a positive Banach density subset of . Then there exists an infinite set and such that .\n\nStrictly speaking, the main result of Kra et al. only claims this theorem for the case of the integers , but as noted in the recent preprint of Charamaras and Mountakis, the argument in fact applies for all countable abelian in which the subgroup has finite index. This condition is in fact necessary (as observed by forthcoming work of Ethan Acklesberg): if has infinite index, then one can find a subgroup of of index for any that contains (or equivalently, is -torsion). If one lets be an enumeration of , and one can then check that the set\n\nhas positive Banach density, but does not contain any set of the form for any (indeed, from the pigeonhole principle and the -torsion nature of one can show that must intersect whenever has cardinality larger than ). It is also necessary to work with restricted sums rather than full sums : a counterexample to the latter is provided for instance by the example with and . Finally, the presence of the shift is also necessary, as can be seen by considering the example of being the odd numbers in , though in the case one can of course delete the shift at the cost of giving up the containment .\n\nTheorem 1 resembles other theorems in density Ramsey theory, such as Szemerédi’s theorem, but with the notable difference that the pattern located in the dense set is infinite rather than merely arbitrarily large but finite. As such, it does not seem that this theorem can be proven by purely finitary means. However, one can view this result as the conjunction of an infinite number of statements, each of which is a finitary density Ramsey theory statement. To see this, we need some more notation. Observe from Tychonoff’s theorem that the collection is a compact topological space (with the topology of pointwise convergence) (it is also metrizable since is countable). Subsets of can be thought of as properties of subsets of ; for instance, the property a subset of of being finite is of this form, as is the complementary property of being infinite. A property of subsets of can then be said to be closed or open if it corresponds to a closed or open subset of . Thus, a property is closed and only if if it is closed under pointwise limits, and a property is open if, whenever a set has this property, then any other set that shares a sufficiently large (but finite) initial segment with will also have this property. Since is compact and Hausdorff, a property is closed if and only if it is compact.\n\nThe properties of being finite or infinite are neither closed nor open. Define a smallness property to be a closed (or compact) property of subsets of that is only satisfied by finite sets; the complement to this is a largeness property, which is an open property of subsets of that is satisfied by all infinite sets. (One could also choose to impose other axioms on these properties, for instance requiring a largeness property to be an upper set, but we will not do so here.) Examples of largeness properties for a subset of include:\n\nhas at least elements.\n\nis non-empty and has at least elements, where is the smallest element of .\n\nis non-empty and has at least elements, where is the element of .\n\nhalts when given as input, where is a given Turing machine that halts whenever given an infinite set as input. (Note that this encompasses the preceding three examples as special cases, by selecting appropriately.)\n\nWe will call a set obeying a largeness property an -large set.\n\nTheorem 1 is then equivalent to the following “almost finitary” version (cf. this previous discussion of almost finitary versions of the infinite pigeonhole principle):\n\nTheorem 2 (Almost finitary form of main theorem) Let be a countably infinite abelian group with finite. Let be a Følner sequence in , let , and let be a largeness property for each . Then there exists such that if is such that for all , then there exists a shift and contains a -large set such that .\n\nProof of Theorem 2 assuming Theorem 1. Let , , be as in Theorem 2. Suppose for contradiction that Theorem 2 failed, then for each we can find with for all , such that there is no and -large such that . By compactness, a subsequence of the converges pointwise to a set , which then has Banach density at least . By Theorem 1, there is an infinite set and a such that . By openness, we conclude that there exists a finite -large set contained in , thus . This implies that for infinitely many , a contradiction.\n\nProof of Theorem 1 assuming Theorem 2. Let be as in Theorem 1. If the claim failed, then for each , the property of being a set for which would be a smallness property. By Theorem 2, we see that there is a and a obeying the complement of this property such that , a contradiction.\n\nRemark 3 Define a relation between and by declaring if and . The key observation that makes the above equivalences work is that this relation is continuous in the sense that if is an open subset of , then the inverse image is also open. Indeed, if for some , then contains a finite set such that , and then any that contains both and lies in .\n\nFor each specific largeness property, such as the examples listed previously, Theorem 2 can be viewed as a finitary assertion (at least if the property is “computable” in some sense), but if one quantifies over all largeness properties, then the theorem becomes infinitary. In the spirit of the Paris-Harrington theorem, I would in fact expect some cases of Theorem 2 to undecidable statements of Peano arithmetic, although I do not have a rigorous proof of this assertion.\n\nDespite the complicated finitary interpretation of this theorem, I was still interested in trying to write the proof of Theorem 1 in some sort of “pseudo-finitary” manner, in which one can see analogies with finitary arguments in additive combinatorics. The proof of Theorem 1 that I give below the fold is my attempt to achieve this, although to avoid a complete explosion of “epsilon management” I will still use at one juncture an ergodic theory reduction from the original paper of Kra et al. that relies on such infinitary tools as the ergodic decomposition, the ergodic theory, and the spectral theorem. Also some of the steps will be a little sketchy, and assume some familiarity with additive combinatorics tools (such as the arithmetic regularity lemma).\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\nThis post contains two unrelated announcements. Firstly, I would like to promote a useful list of resources for AI in Mathematics, that was initiated by Talia Ringer (with the crowdsourced assistance of many others) during the National Academies workshop on “AI in mathematical reasoning” last year. This list is now accepting new contributions, updates, or corrections; please feel free to submit them directly to the list (which I am helping Talia to edit). Incidentally, next week there will be a second followup webinar to the aforementioned workshop, building on the topics covered there. (The first webinar may be found here.)\n\nSecondly, I would like to advertise the erdosproblems.com website, launched recently by Thomas Bloom. This is intended to be a living repository of the many mathematical problems proposed in various venues by Paul Erdős, who was particularly noted for his influential posing of such problems. For a tour of the site and an explanation of its purpose, I can recommend Thomas’s recent talk on this topic at a conference last week in honor of Timothy Gowers.\n\nThomas is currently issuing a call for help to develop the erdosproblems.com website in a number of ways (quoting directly from that page):\n\nYou know Github and could set a suitable project up to allow people to contribute new problems (and corrections to old ones) to the database, and could help me maintain the Github project;\n\nYou know things about web design and have suggestions for how this website could look or perform better;\n\nYou know things about Python/Flask/HTML/SQL/whatever and want to help me code cool new features on the website;\n\nYou know about accessibility and have an idea how I can make this website more accessible (to any group of people);\n\nYou are a mathematician who has thought about some of the problems here and wants to write an expanded commentary for one of them, with lots of references, comparisons to other problems, and other miscellaneous insights (mathematician here is interpreted broadly, in that if you have thought about the problems on this site and are willing to write such a commentary you qualify);\n\nYou knew Erdős and have any memories or personal correspondence concerning a particular problem;\n\nYou have solved an Erdős problem and I’ll update the website accordingly (and apologies if you solved this problem some time ago);\n\nYou have spotted a mistake, typo, or duplicate problem, or anything else that has confused you and I’ll correct things;\n\nYou are a human being with an internet connection and want to volunteer a particular Erdős paper or problem list to go through and add new problems from (please let me know before you start, to avoid duplicate efforts);\n\nYou have any other ideas or suggestions – there are probably lots of things I haven’t thought of, both in ways this site can be made better, and also what else could be done from this project. Please get in touch with any ideas!\n\nI for instance contributed a problem to the site (#587) that Erdős himself gave to me personally (this was the topic of a somewhat well known photo of Paul and myself, and which he communicated again to be shortly afterwards on a postcard; links to both images can be found by following the above link). As it turns out, this particular problem was essentially solved in 2010 by Nguyen and Vu.\n\n(Incidentally, I also spoke at the same conference that Thomas spoke at, on my recent work with Gowers, Green, and Manners; here is the video of my talk, and here are my slides.)"
