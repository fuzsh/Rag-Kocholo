        "text": "A sculpture can be reproduced by transposing measurements taken all over its surface to a copy. The process is made accurate and thorough by the use of a pointing machine, which is an arrangement of adjustable metal arms and pointers that are set to the position of any point on the surface of a three-dimensional form and then used to locate the corresponding point on the surface of a copy. If the copy is a stone one, the block is drilled to the depth measured by the pointing machine. When a number of points have been fixed by drilling, the stone is cut away to the required depth. For accurate pointing, a vast number of points have to be taken, and the final surface is approached gradually. The main use of pointing has been for the indirect method of carving.\n\nEnlarged and reduced copies of sculpture can also be produced with the aid of mechanical devices. A sophisticated reducing machine that works on the principle of the pantograph (an instrument for copying on any predetermined scale, consisting of four light, rigid bars jointed in parallelogram form) is used in minting for scaling down the sculptor’s original model to coin size.\n\nSurface finishing\n\nSurface finishes for sculpture can be either natural—bringing the material of the sculpture itself to a finish—or applied. Almost all applied surface finishes preserve as well as decorate.\n\nSmoothing and polishing\n\nMany sculptural materials have a natural beauty of colour and texture that can be brought out by smoothing and polishing. Stone carvings are smoothed by rubbing down with a graded series of coarse and fine abrasives, such as carborundum, sandstone, emery, pumice, and whiting, all used while the stone is wet. Some stones, such as marble and granite, will take a high gloss; others are too coarse-grained to be polished and can only be smoothed to a granular finish. Wax is sometimes used to give stone a final polish.\n\nThe natural beauty of wood is brought out by sandpapering or scraping and then waxing or oiling. Beeswax and linseed oil are the traditional materials, but a wide range of waxes and oils is currently available.\n\nIvory is polished with gentle abrasives such as pumice and whiting, applied with a damp cloth.\n\nConcrete can be rubbed down, like stone, with water and abrasives, which both smooth the surface and expose the aggregate. Some concretes can be polished.\n\nMetals are rubbed down manually with steel wool and emery paper and polished with various metal polishes. A high-gloss polish can be given to metals by means of power-driven buffing wheels used in conjunction with abrasives and polishes. Clear lacquers are applied to preserve the polish.\n\nPainting\n\nStone, wood, terra-cotta, metal, fibreglass, and plaster can all be painted in a reasonably durable manner provided that the surfaces are properly prepared and suitable primings and paints are used. In the past, stone and wood carvings were often finished with a coating of gesso (plaster of paris or gypsum prepared with glue) that served both as a final modeling material for delicate surface detail and as a priming for painting. Historically, the painting and gilding of sculpture were usually left to specialists. In Greek relief sculpture, actual details of the composition were often omitted at the carving stage and left for the painter to insert. In the 15th century, the great Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden undertook the painting of sculpture as part of his work.\n\nModern paint technology has made an enormous range of materials available. Constructed sculptures are often finished with mechanical grinders and sanders and then sprayed with high-quality cellulose paints.\n\nGilding\n\nThe surfaces of wood, stone, and plaster sculpture can be decorated with gold, silver, and other metals that are applied in leaf or powder form over a suitable priming. Metals, especially bronze, were often fire-gilded; that is, treated with an amalgam of gold and mercury that was heated to drive off the mercury. The panels of the Gates of Paradise in Florence, by the 15th-century sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, are a well-known example of gilded bronze.\n\nPatination\n\nPatinas on metals are caused by the corrosive action of chemicals. Sculpture that is exposed to different kinds of atmosphere or buried in soil or immersed in seawater for some time acquires a patina that can be extremely attractive. Similar effects can be achieved artificially by applying various chemicals to the metal surface, which is often heated to create a bond. This is a particularly effective treatment for bronze, which can be given a wide variety of attractive green, brown, blue, and black patinas. Iron is sometimes allowed to rust until it acquires a satisfactory colour, and then the process is arrested by lacquering.\n\nElectroplating\n\nThe surfaces of metal sculpture or of specially prepared nonmetal sculpture can be coated with such metals as chrome, silver, gold, copper, and nickel by the familiar industrial process of electroplating. The related technique of anodizing can be used to prevent the corrosion of aluminum sculpture and to dye its surface.\n\nOther finishes\n\nThe surfaces of metal sculpture can be decorated by means of numerous metalsmithing techniques—etching, engraving, metal inlaying, enameling, and so on. Pottery sculpture can be decorated with coloured slips, oxides, and enamels; glazed with a variety of shiny or mat glazes; and brought to a dull polish by burnishing.\n\nOther materials have often been added to the surface of sculpture. The eyes of ancient figure sculpture, for example, were sometimes inlaid with stones. Occasionally—as in Mexican mosaic work—the whole surface of a sculpture is inlaid with mother-of-pearl, turquoise, coral, and many other substances."
