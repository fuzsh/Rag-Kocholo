        "text": "When I submit my art, & fill out forms for galleries, online etc, for dimensions of artworks is there any particular way I need to write it? ie; an art work that is 18 inches by 24 inches, do I list the smaller number 1st? and do I note width x height? or width x length?\n\nor does it matter? I ask because I read somewhere that there was a specific way, but I forgot which way.\n\nWhen I worked for an interior design firm, they always listed items width x height x depth. That might have been so the company had a standard format as much as any tradition. If it’s obvious from the image which way it goes, I doubt it matters. But it can’t hurt to put W and H by the measurement just so eveyone’s clear, (and D if you need to give the depth). So far, I don’t recall any gallery having a rigid rule about which comes first.\n\nWhen I write H x W would that be for both a vertical painting & a horizontal? ie a landscape at 12 x 16, or portrait 12 x 16? how would I list those?\n\nWell, if you listed it like you have here, you are telling the jurors/curators the painting must be hung with the smaller sides going up and down the wall and the larger sides horizontal with the floor.\n\nMy guess is that would probably be incorrect for the portrait (unless a group sitting). The standard in art, as mentioned, is not the same as other standards (canvas catalog sales, for example).\n\nIt took me a while to wrap my head around this. You might want to keep a post-it note in your studio until the listing just comes naturally. I certainly had to.\n\nDiane\n\nThanks all, this clears that up a bit, I will go and make some adjustments to my databases for this, i was always a bit unclear on this.\n\nAnother question, I make all my art size notations in inches, do I need to include any other units forms of measures? like mm, or cm?\n\nAnother question, I make all my art size notations in inches, do I need to include any other units forms of measures? like mm, or cm?\n\nIf you are in a place that uses inches (ex. US) then that is what you would do. If you are in Europe then centimeters. Just make sure you are listing in the correct measurements for any juried show, etc.\n\nI actually list both on my blog because I have viewers in Latin America.\n\nDiane\n\nI do as Diane says, height first, so H x W.\n\nArtnet.com puts the height first and they also label with h and w. They give it in both inches and cm as well, for example this is from a Lichtenstein —\n\nh: 30.7 x w: 23 cm / h: 12.1 x w: 9.1 in\n\nMary\n\nWebsite\n\n_______________\n\nI went to a few online conversion sites, & koala app on my mac for inches to centimeter conversion, & some gave me slightly different conversions, some had 2 numbers after a decimal, another site just listed one number after a decimal.\n\ndoes it matter how many numbers rounded after the decimal when noting the centimeter numbers?\n\nMath was never my strongest subject, so is the reason I still ask.\n\nDepends on how accurate you feel the measurement needs to be. Since one decimal point on a centimeter dimension represents one millimiter and a millimeter is just a little more than 1/32 of an inch I think you’re okay with one decimal place, that makes your measurement within about 1/32 of an inch which is a pretty tight tolerance for a frame.\n\nReal world example.\n\n16 in. X 12 in. = 40.64 cm X 30.48 cm exactly. Let’s say we round those centimeter dimensions to the nearest millimeter, they would then read 40.6 cm X 30.5 cm. You lose .04 cm on the 16 in. dimension which equals .0157″ or about 1/64 in. The other dimension is even closer. Do you think any frames are built so tight that they couldn’t handle a painting that is 1/32 in. larger or smaller, let alone 1/64?\n\nDavid\n\nDavid"
