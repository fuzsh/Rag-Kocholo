Method for Measuring Phosphorylated Tau Protein\n\nThe first embodiment relates to a method for measuring phosphorylated tau protein in a biological sample collected from a subject.\n\n1-1. Explanation of Terms\n\nFirst, terms used in this embodiment will be described. The description of the terms used in this embodiment is also incorporated in the description of other embodiments.\n\nThe subject is not particularly limited and may be a healthy person or a person who is not suspected of degenerative disease of cognitive disorder or central nervous system. The subject may also be a person suspected of cognitive impairment or degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Those who are of a certain age group, for example, 30 years old or over, 40 years old or over, 50 years old or over, 60 years old or over, 70 years old or over, or 80 years old or over may also be the subjects.\n\nA biological sample collected from a subject is not particularly limited as long as it can contain phosphorylated tau protein, and examples thereof include a cerebrospinal fluid, a blood sample, and the like. The blood samples include whole blood, plasma, serum, and the like. Preferably the blood sample is plasma or serum, and more preferably plasma. The plasma can be separated from whole blood collected in heparin salt (preferably sodium salt), citrate (preferably sodium salt), and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) salt (preferably sodium salt or potassium salt). More preferably, the plasma is plasma separated from whole blood collected in EDTA salt or heparin salt.\n\nThe tau protein is Paired helical filament-tau, and examples of those derived from humans include proteins registered in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P10636.5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/P10636, as of Jul. 15, 2017).\n\nThe phosphorylated tau protein is not limited as long as tau protein is phosphorylated. For example, the phosphorylation site is at least one serine residue selected from the group consisting of the 199th, 202nd, 214th, 262nd, 356th, 396th, 404th, 409th, 416th, 422nd, 519th, 516th and 717th and/or at least one threonine residue selected from the group consisting of 181st, 205th, 212nd, 217th, 231st and 534th of the amino acid sequence of the above accession number. Preferably, the phosphorylation site is at least one selected from the group consisting of threonine 181, serine 199, threonine 231, and serine 262.\n\nThe antibody is not limited as long as it can recognize tau protein and/or phosphorylated tau protein. The antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tau protein is preferably an antibody that specifically binds to phosphorylated tau protein (phosphorylated tau protein specific antibody that does not bind to unphosphorylated tau protein). The phosphorylated tau protein specific antibody (hereinafter also referred to as “p-tau specific antibody”) may recognize the phosphorylated phosphorylation site of the tau protein, or may recognize the tau protein whose structure has changed with phosphorylation. More preferably, the p-tau specific antibody recognizes the phosphorylated phosphorylation site of the tau protein.\n\nAs the antibody, any of tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein, or a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, and a fragment thereof (for example, Fab, F(ab)2, or the like) obtained by immunizing nonhuman animals using a part thereof as an antigen can be used. Also, immunoglobulin classes and subclasses are not particularly limited. Those selected from the antibody library by the phage display method or the like may be used.\n\nAs the antibody, commercially available antibody may be used. As the antibody recognizing tau protein, for example, Tau Monoclonal Antibody (clone: HT7, T46, TAU-5) from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and the like can be used. Examples of the antibodies that recognize phosphorylated tau protein include Phospho-Tau (Thr181) Antibody (clone: 5HCLC), Phospho-Tau (Thr231) Polyclonal Antibody (Cat #: 710561), and Phospho-Tau (Ser214) Polyclonal Antibody (Cat #: 44-742G) from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and the like can be used.\n\nIn the present specification, the capture antibody is an antibody that binds to the phosphorylated tau protein and is fixed on the bead described below. Fixation to the bead may be indirect fixation mediated by avidin (or streptavidin) and a substance such as biotin.\n\nIn the present specification, the detection antibody is an antibody that binds to the phosphorylated tau protein, and is preferably provided with a labeling substance described below.\n\nAt least one of the capture antibody and the detection antibody is a p-tau specific antibody. As a result, it is possible to specifically detect the phosphorylated tau protein among the tau proteins in the biological sample.\n\nWhen a p-tau specific antibody is used as both the capture antibody and the detection antibody, it is preferred that epitopes of these antibodies are different.\n\nWhen a p-tau specific antibody is used as one of the capture antibody and the detection antibody, the other antibody is preferably an antibody capable of binding to the tau protein regardless of the presence or absence of phosphorylation.\n\nThe beads are not limited as long as they have the property that the individual beads can be spatially separated. The beads may be provided in such a form that they can be spatially separated into a plurality of places (for example, wells). For example, the beads can be formed in a shape such as spherical, disk, ring, or cubic. The beads may be fine particles (for example, a plurality of particles suspended in a liquid), nanotubes, or the like.\n\nThe size or shape of the beads can be appropriately designed. For example, the shape of the beads includes sphere, cube, ellipsoid, tube, and the like. The average diameter of the beads (in the case of substantially spherical) or the average maximum cross-sectional dimension (in the case of other shapes) is more than about 0.1 μm, more than about 1 μm, more than about 10 μm, more than about 100 μm, or more than about 1 mm, or similar ones are included. The average diameter of the beads or the maximum outer dimension of the beads is about 0.1 μm to about 100 μm, about 1 μm to about 100 μm, about 10 μm to about 100 μm, between about 0.1 μm and about 1 mm, between about 1 μm and about 10 mm, between about 0.1 μm and about 10 μm, or the like. The average diameter or average maximum cross-sectional dimension of the beads used in this embodiment is the arithmetic mean of the diameter/maximum cross-sectional dimension of the beads.\n\nThe average maximum cross-sectional dimension of the beads can be measured using, for example, laser light scattering, microscopy, sieve analysis, electrical resistance method, or other known techniques. The average diameter of the beads is a volume-based median diameter measured with a particle size distribution measuring device by laser diffraction/scattering method. Examples of the particle size distribution measuring device include “Microtrac MT3000 II” manufactured by NIKKISO CO., LTD., and the like.\n\nThe beads are insoluble or substantially insoluble in the solvent or solution used in the measurement. The beads may be porous or substantially porous, hollow, partially hollow, or the like, but are preferably non-porous solids or substantially non-porous solids (for example, essentially free of pores). The beads may be one that substantially absorbs or absorbs the solvent, but preferably nonabsorb, or substantially nonabsorb the solvent.\n\nAs the material of the beads, a plastic or a synthetic polymer (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polyurethane, phenol polymer or nitrocellulose), a naturally occurring polymer (including latex rubbers, polysaccharide metals, or metal compounds (such as gold, silver, steel, aluminum, and copper), and the like), inorganic glass, silica, a mixture thereof, and the like can be selected. The beads preferably include a magnetic material. The beads are preferably optically detectable.\n\nAs the beads, commercially available beads can be used. For example, carboxyl-functionalized paramagnetic beads from Agilent Technologies (2.7 μm in diameter) can be used.\n\nCapture beads are beads capable of immobilizing a complex containing tau protein and/or phosphorylated tau protein (hereinafter also referred to as “target protein”). For example, capture beads can be obtained by directly or indirectly fixing a molecule capable of binding to a target protein (hereinafter also referred to as “capture molecule”) to the aforementioned beads. As the capture molecule, the capture antibody described above is exemplified.\n\nThe method for preparing the capture beads is not limited as long as the capture molecules can be bound to the beads. For example, when the capture molecule is an antibody, the capture beads can be prepared by the method described in WO 2016/115256 A. The capture beads may be prepared using a commercially available kit such as the Simoa™ Homebrew Assay Development kit from Quanterix Inc. The capture beads may be blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or the like to suppress nonspecific binding.\n\nNon-capture beads are beads that do not substantially bind to the target protein. The non-capture beads do not have capture molecules. The material of the beads used for the non-capture beads may be the same as the beads used for the capture beads, or may be different. As the non-capture beads, for example, Dye-Encoded Helper Beads from Quanterix Inc. may be used. The non-capture beads may be blocked with BSA or the like to suppress nonspecific binding.\n\n1-2. Measurement Method\n\nNext, the measurement method of this embodiment will be described.\n\nThis embodiment is a sandwich immunoassay method of forming a sandwich immune complex containing phosphorylated tau protein and detecting phosphorylated tau protein. This embodiment includes steps of preparing a measurement sample containing a non-capture bead and a capture bead to which an immune complex is bound, by forming the immune complex of the phosphorylated tau protein that is a target protein in the biological sample collected from a subject, a capture antibody and a detection antibody on the capture bead, in the presence of the non-capture bead, and detecting a signal derived from the immune complex in the measurement sample.\n\nIn this embodiment, the method of forming an immune complex of the target protein in the biological sample, the capture antibody and the detection antibody on the capture bead is not limited as long as this embodiment can be realized by the method. It is preferred that the capture antibody and the detection antibody recognize different epitopes of the target protein. For example, first, the target protein in the biological sample is bound to the capture antibody using a capture antibody that recognizes tau protein as a capture molecule on the capture bead, to bind (preferably, capture) the target protein on the capture bead. Next, a detection antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tau protein is bound to the phosphorylated tau protein contained in the target protein captured by the capture antibody to form an immune complex. Alternatively, for example, first, the target protein in the biological sample is bound to the capture antibody using a capture antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tau protein as a capture molecule on the capture bead, to bind (preferably, capture) the target protein on the capture bead. Next, a detection antibody that recognizes tau protein is bound to the phosphorylated tau protein captured by the capture antibody to form an immune complex. The biological sample may be diluted with, for example, 1 to 5×PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) to 0.15% polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween (registered trademark)-20) and the like and used.\n\nIn another embodiment, an immune complex of phosphorylated tau protein in the biological sample, a capture antibody and a detection antibody may be formed in a buffer solution and then bound to the capture bead. For example, an immune complex can be fixed on the capture bead by bringing a bead on which avidin or streptavidin is immobilized into contact with a complex of a biotin-labeled capture antibody, phosphorylated tau protein and a detection antibody.\n\nThe immune complex is formed in the presence of a non-capture bead. The number ratio of the capture beads and the non-capture beads in preparing the measurement sample is about 1.5 or more when taking the capture beads as 1, and the number ratio of the non-capture beads can be adjusted to preferably in the range of about 1.5 to about 9, more preferably in the range of about 4 to about 9, and most preferably around 4. In another embodiment, the number ratio of the capture beads and the non-capture beads in preparing the measurement sample is about 1.5 or more when taking the capture beads as 1, and the number ratio of the non-capture beads is in the range of 1.5 or more, preferably in the range of 1.5 to 9, more preferably in the range of 4 to 9, and most preferably 4. The number of whole beads mixed with the biological sample or diluted biological sample can be adjusted to, for example, about 100,000 to 1,000,000, and preferably about 400,000 to 800,000, based on 100 μl of the biological sample or diluted biological sample.\n\nPreparation of the measurement sample can be carried out in a buffer solution (for example, 1 to 5×PBS) capable of forming an immune complex. The buffer solution may contain a surfactant such as Tween (registered trademark)-20 in the order of 0.05% (v/v) to 0.15% (v/v). During the preparation of the measurement sample, the phosphorylated tau protein in the biological sample is captured by the capture antibody, and then the capture beads may be washed with the buffer solution before binding the detection antibody. The capture beads may be washed with the buffer solution even after forming an immune complex of the phosphorylated tau protein in the biological sample, the detection antibody, and the capture antibody on the capture bead.\n\nThe detection antibody can be added so as to have a final concentration of about 0.05 μg/ml to 1 μg/ml and 0.1 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml, based on 100 μl of the biological sample or the diluted biological sample. The detection antibody is preferably provided with a labeling substance.\n\nDetection of the phosphorylated tau protein can be carried out by detecting a labeling substance contained in the immune complex. The labeling substance is not particularly limited as long as a detectable signal is generated. For example, it may be a substance which itself generates a signal (hereinafter also referred to as “signal generating substance”) or a substance which catalyzes the reaction of other substances to generate a signal. Examples of the signal generating substance include fluorescent substances, radioactive isotopes, and the like. Examples of the substance that catalyzes the reaction of other substances to generate a detectable signal include enzymes. Examples of the enzymes include alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, and the like. Examples of the fluorescent substances include fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine and Alexa Fluor (registered trademark), fluorescent proteins such as GFP, and the like. Examples of the radioisotopes include 125I, 14C, 32P, and the like. Among them, an enzyme is preferable as a labeling substance, and β-galactosidase is particularly preferable.\n\nThe substrate of the enzyme can be appropriately selected from known substrates according to the type of the enzyme. For example, when alkaline phosphatase is used as the enzyme, examples of the substrate include chemiluminescent substrates such as CDP-Star (registered trademark) (disodium 4-chloro-3-(methoxyspiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]-4-yl)phenyl phosphate) and CSPD (registered trademark) (disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), and chromogenic substrates such as 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), disodium 5-bromo-6-chloro-indolyl phosphate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. When β-galactosidase is used as an enzyme, resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside can be used. When peroxidase is used as an enzyme, SuperSignal ELISA series from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and the like can be used. The enzyme reaction is preferably carried out before arranging a bead in a microwell as described later, but the enzymatic reaction may be carried out after arranging the bead in the microwell.\n\nThe detection antibody is biotinylated beforehand and bound to the avidin or streptavidin labeled with the labeling substance, then the signal may be detected.\n\nSignal detection can be performed on all or a part of the beads including the capture beads and the non-capture beads contained in the measurement sample. Signal detection is preferably performed on individual beads. Since the presence or absence, intensity, wavelength and the like of the signal are different between the capture bead and the non-capture bead, it is preferable to use a detection device capable of distinguishing these beads.\n\nAs a method for detecting the signal of individual beads, for example, when the signal is fluorescence, it can be detected using a flow cytometer.\n\nIn another embodiment, the measurement sample may be brought into contact with a substrate having a plurality of microwells, the capture beads and the non-capture beads in the measurement sample may be arranged in the microwell, and a signal in the microwell may be detected.\n\nOn the substrate, the microwells can be arranged on a substantially flat surface or in a non-planar three dimensional array. The microwells may be arranged in a regular pattern or randomly distributed. The microwells are preferably in a regular pattern of sites on a substantially flat surface.\n\nThe number of microwells contained in the substrate can be about 1000 to 1,000,000 per one measurement sample. The substrate can contain preferably 10,000 to 500,000, and more preferably about 100,000 to 500,000 microwells.\n\nThe substrate material may be configured by glass (including modified and/or functionalized glass), plastic (polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene, polyurethane, cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), cyclic olefin polymer (COP), Teflon (registered trademark), polysaccharide, nylon, nitrocellulose, and the like), elastomer (for example, dimethylsiloxane, polyurethane, and the like), a composite material, a ceramic, silica or a silica-based material (including silicon and modified silicon), carbon, a metal, an optical fiber bundle, and the like.\n\nThe capacity of each microwell can be appropriately set according to the size of the beads. For example, the number of beads stored in one well is about 1 to 5, preferably about 1 to 2, and more preferably 1. Therefore, the volume of the microwell is preferably such that the number of beads described above can be stored in one well. (For example, US 2011/0212848 A, WO 2011/109364 A). More specifically, the volume of the microwell ranges from 100 attritor to 1 picoliter, preferably 1 femtoliter to 500 femtoliter, and more preferably 10 femtoliters to 90 femtoliter. It is preferable that the plurality of microwells present on one substrate have substantially the same volume.\n\nThe method of forming the microwell is not limited as long as a microwell of a desired size can be formed. For example, the microwell can be formed by a known method such as photolithography, stamping technique, molding technique, and etching technique.\n\nThe arrangement of the beads in the microwells can be carried out using a known method. For example, beads can be arranged in the microwells using the microfluidic technique described in WO 2016/115256 A. The beads may be arranged in all the microwells on the substrate or may be arranged in a part.\n\nFor example, the beads can be arranged in the microwells by bringing the measurement sample into contact with the substrate on which the microwell is designed, then centrifuging the substrate and the solution. When the beads are magnetic, the beads may be arranged in the microwells using a magnet. Alternatively, when the microwell is formed at the end of the optical fiber bundle, the beads may be arranged in the microwells by bringing the measurement sample into contact with around the other end of the optical fiber, then applying a force such as centrifugal force or pressure.\n\nAfter arranging the beads in the microwells, the measurement sample remaining on the substrate surrounding the microwells may be removed, and the surface of the substrate may be washed and/or wiped to remove the excess measurement sample.\n\nAs the substrate containing the microwells, for example, Simoa™ Disk from Quanterix Inc. can be used.\n\nThe microwells after arranging the beads may be sealed with a fluorous liquid, an oil (for example, a mineral oil, a fluorinated oil), a ferrofluid, a non-aqueous polymer solution (for example, a thickener), or the like. For example, Simoa™ Sealing Oil from Quanterix Inc. may be used as the seal.\n\nFor example, when the labeling substance is an enzyme or a fluorescent dye, detection of the beads arranged in the microwells can be performed by imaging a signal with a CCD camera or the like. When the labeling substance is a radioactive isotope, the beads can be detected using autoradiography.\n\nThe beads arranged in the microwells are capture beads or non-capture beads, but capture beads that have captured the target protein emit a signal derived from the labeling substance (i.e., a signal derived from the immune complex), whereas beads that have not captured the target protein and non-capture beads do not emit a signal derived from the labeling substance. Therefore, by counting the number of wells that emit a signal derived from the labeling substance, the target protein can be quantified. The microwell for detecting a signal may be all or a part of the microwells on the substrate.\n\nThe number of wells that emit a signal derived from the labeling substance can be measured with, for example, Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer from Quanterix Inc. When using the Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer, the intensity of the signal is expressed as the average enzyme (AEB) value per bead. Therefore, the AEB value may be the signal intensity derived from the immune complex in the measurement sample.\n\nUsing the calibration curve, the AEB value may be converted into the measured value of phosphorylated tau protein. The measured value of phosphorylated tau protein refers to a value reflecting the amount or concentration of phosphorylated tau protein. When the measured value is indicated by “amount”, it may be expressed on either a mole basis or a mass basis, but it is preferable to indicate the amount on a mass basis. When the value is expressed in terms of “concentration”, it may be a molar concentration or a ratio (mass/volume) of a mass per constant volume of a biological sample, but the value is preferably expressed in terms of a ratio of mass/volume.\n\nAs a measurement method of this embodiment, it is preferable to use β-galactosidase as a labeling substance and resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate according to the protocol from Quanterix Inc. Beads are applied to Simoa™ Disk, and it is preferable to obtain signal intensity with Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer.\n\n2. Method for Acquiring Information on Whether or Not Subject Suffers from Alzheimer's Disease\n\nIn the second embodiment, information on whether or not the subject suffers from Alzheimer's disease is acquired, based on the intensity of the signal of the phosphorylated tau protein obtained in 1. above.\n\nMore specifically, the signal intensity derived from the phosphorylated tau protein in the biological sample of the subject is compared with a predetermined reference value, and when the signal intensity derived from the phosphorylated tau protein in the biological sample of the subject is high, information that the subject suffers from Alzheimer's disease is acquired.\n\nThe predetermined reference value refers to a reference value of the signal intensity derived from the phosphorylated tau protein. The reference value can be determined based on the signal intensity (negative control value) derived from the phosphorylated tau protein in a biological sample of a person who has not developed Alzheimer's disease and/or mild dementia. Alternatively, it can be determined based on the signal intensity (positive control value) derived from the phosphorylated tau protein in a biological sample of a person who has developed Alzheimer's disease. The reference value may be determined from both the negative control value and the positive control value. For example, a plurality of positive control values and a plurality of negative control values are acquired, and a value that can most accurately classify positive and negative based on these plural values can be taken as “reference value”. The phrase “the value that can most accurately classify” can be appropriately set based on indices such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the like, depending on the purpose of the examination. In another example, it is possible to set a reference value that can most accurately classify positive and negative from the viewpoint of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and the like.\n\nInformation on whether or not the subject suffers from Alzheimer's disease may be acquired, using the measured value of phosphorylated tau protein, in place of the signal intensity.\n\n3.

Detection of Phosphorylated Tau Protein by ELISA Method (1) Preparation of Capture Beads and Biotin-Labeled Antibody\n\nCapture beads to which an antibody (capture antibody) for capturing a target protein is bound and biotin-labeled antibody (detection antibody) for detecting a target protein are prepared using Simoa™ Homebrew Assay Development Kit (Quanterix Inc.) according to the protocol attached to the kit. In the preparation, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC: Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and a centrifugal filtration filter (Merck Millipore) attached to the kit were used.\n\nAs antibodies, an antibody that recognizes tau protein aa.159-163 (Anti-Human Tau Monoclonal Antibody, Purified, clone: HT7; Thermo SCIENTIFIC Inc.) and an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of Thr181 of phosphorylated tau protein (Anti-Human PHF-Tau Monoclonal Antibody, Purified, clone: AT270, Thermo SCIENTIFIC Inc.) were used. Hereinafter, the former is referred to as HT7 antibody, and the latter is referred to as AT270 antibody.\n\n(2) Immunoassay\n\nMeasurement was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the capture beads prepared in the above (1) and the biotin-labeled antibody prepared in the above (1), Dye-Encoded Helper Beads (non-capture beads) from Quanterix Inc., Simoa™ Enzyme and Substrate kit, Simoa™ Disk kit, Simoa™ Sealing Oil, System buffer 1, System buffer 2, and Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer. For the measurement, the measurement sample and necessary reagents such as the capture beads, the biotin-labeled antibody and the non-capture beads were set in the Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer, and all measurement steps were performed with the Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer.\n\nSpecific steps are as follows. Initially, a capture antibody bound to the capture bead was bound to a target protein, in the presence of the non-capture bead. Subsequently, the biotinylated detection antibody was further bound to the target protein bound to the capture antibody to form an immune complex of the capture antibody, the target protein and the biotinylated detection antibody on the capture bead. After the above steps, the capture beads were reacted with streptavidin to which β-galactosidase was bound in the presence of the non-capture bead. After the above steps, the capture beads were reacted with the substrate of β-galactosidase (RGP: resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside) in the presence of the non-capture bead. The capture beads and non-capture beads after reaction with RGP were applied to Simoa™ Disk. Thereafter, the applied beads were stored one by one in each well of the array in which a large number of femtoliter unit wells were arranged. Each bead stored in the well was photographed by Simoa™ HD-1 Analyzer, the fluorescence intensity (AEB) was measured, and the number of beads with high fluorescence intensity was measured to quantify the target protein.\n\n2. Example 1\n\nThe optimal ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads was examined using HT7 antibody as a capture antibody and AT270 antibody as a detection antibody. The experiment was carried out according to the method described in the above 1. For examination, one obtained by diluting Hu Tau [pT181] Standard attached to Human Tau [pT181] phosphoELISA™ ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) that is phosphorylated tau protein, to 0.039 pg/ml with Sample Diluent attached to Simoa™ Homebrew Assay Development kit was used as a sample for measurement. For one measurement, 152 μl of 0.039 pg/ml Hu Tau [pT181] Standard was used.\n\nThe AEBs were compared when 0.039 pg/ml pT181 was measured with changing the ratio of the non-capture beads to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%, based on 100% of the total of the capture beads and the non-capture beads. The results are shown in FIG. 6. As a result, a strong AEB was obtained when the non-capture beads were 60% or more.\n\nTherefore, in order to detect phosphorylated tau protein, it was considered preferable to set the ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads in the range of 40:60 to 10:90, that is, in the range of 1:1.5 to 1:9. Furthermore, it was considered particularly preferable to set the ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads in the range of 20:80 to 10:90, that is, in the range of 1:4 to 1:9.\n\n3. Example 2\n\nNext, the optimal ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads was examined in the same manner as in Example 1, except for using AT270 antibody as a capture antibody and HT7 antibody as a detection antibody.\n\nThe AEBs were compared when 0.039 pg/ml pT181 was measured with changing the ratio of the non-capture beads to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%, based on 100% of the total of the capture beads and the non-capture beads. The results are shown in FIG. 7. As a result, a strong AEB was obtained when the non-capture beads were 60% or more.\n\nTherefore, in order to detect phosphorylated tau protein, it was considered preferable to set the ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads in the range of 40:60 to 10:90, that is, in the range of 1:1.5 to 1:9.\n\n4. Example 3\n\nNext, the optimal ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads was examined using human plasma (EDTA-2Na blood collection) as a sample. The phosphorylated tau protein in plasma of 2 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD1, AD2) and 2 control patients (Cont. 1, Cont. 2), in place of the diluted solution of Hu Tau [pT181], were measured. Plasma was diluted 4 times with Sample Diluent and measured. Buffer was used as a blank. Whether or not Alzheimer's disease patients could be detected was compared with changing the ratio of the non-capture beads to 0, 50, and 80%, based on 100% of the total of the capture beads and the non-capture bead.\n\nThe results are shown in FIG. 7.\n\nWhen the ratio of the non-capture beads was set to 0% or 50%, it was not possible to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease patients and control patients, and Alzheimer's disease patients could be detected only when the ratio was set to 80%.\n\nFrom the above results, it was considered preferable to set the ratio of the capture beads to the non-capture beads to be more than 1:1 when measuring phosphorylated tau protein using a biological sample, and detecting Alzheimer's disease patients."
