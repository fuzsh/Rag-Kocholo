Luckey, 1950.)\n\nWhile Archimedes was able to bound the ratio of a circle circumference and diameter between 223/71 (≈ 3.1408) and 22/7 (≈ 3.1428), Jamshid al-Kashi wanted to determine it to a much higher precision. In his 1424 Treatise on the circumference of the circle, it was his goal that\n\nin a circle whose diameter is 600,000 times the diameter of the earth, the difference between it [the calculated circumference] and the true circumference is less than a single hair, which is one sixth of the width of an average barley grain, such that it [the difference] in a [circle] which is smaller than that doesn't matter.\n\nThis translates to approximately 14 decimal digits.\n\nHis calculations are performed in sexagesimal (base 60) digits. In section 8, Transformation of the value of the circumference into the Indian digits under the condition that half of the diameter be one, he gives the result in decimal digits:\n\nWe put the digits from left to right onto a half-verse, to get a verse:\n\nwa baḥǧā ḥahǧi ṣaz a za ṭah ḥawahu\n\nmuḥīṭun li-quṭrin huwa ’ṯnāni minhu\n\n6 2 8 3 1 8 5 3 0 7 1 7 9 5 8 6 5\n\nis the circumference for a diameter which is two thereof.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nP. Luckey, Der Lehrbrief über den Kreisumfang von Ǧamšīd b. Mas‛ūd Al-Kāšī, 1950\n\nPeter Harremoës, Al-Kāshī’s constant, 2018\n\nThe section Adoption of the symbol π of the excellent Wikipedia article Pi says:\n\nIn the earliest usages, the Greek letter π was used to denote the semiperimeter (semiperipheria in Latin) of a circle and was combined in ratios with δ (for diameter or semidiameter) or ρ (for radius) to form circle constants. (Before then, mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p instead.) The first recorded use is Oughtred's \"δ.π\", to express the ratio of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of Clavis Mathematicae. Barrow likewise used \"$\\frac{\\pi}{\\delta}$\" to represent the constant 3.14..., while Gregory instead used \"$\\frac{\\pi}{\\rho}$\" to represent 6.28...\n\nThe earliest known use of the Greek letter π alone to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics. The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase \"1/2 Periphery (π)\" in the discussion of a circle with radius one. However, he writes that his equations for π are from the \"ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin\", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767.\n\nEuler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 Essay Explaining the Properties of Air, though he used π = 6.28..., the ratio of periphery to radius, in this and some later writing. Euler first used π = 3.14... in his 1736 work Mechanica, and continued in his widely-read 1748 work Introductio in analysin infinitorum (he wrote: \"for the sake of brevity we will write this number as π; thus π is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1\"). Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world, though the definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761.\n\nProcessing, since 2.0 (2013) TAU\n\nRaku (aka Perl 6), since 2015 tau\n\nNim, since 0.14.0 (2016) TAU\n\nPython, since 3.6 (2016) math.tau\n\nUnreal Engine, since 4.12 (2016) TAU\n\nCSS (2018) turn\n\nOpenFOAM twoPi\n\nExtreme Numerics.NET Constants.TwoPi\n\nV, since 0.1.7 (2019) tau\n\nZig, since 0.6.0 (2019) tau\n\nManim, since 0.1.0 (2020) TAU\n\nRust, since 1.47 (2020) std::f64::consts::TAU\n\n.NET, C#, since 5.0 (2020) Tau\n\nBoost, since 1.77.0 (2021) tau\n\nGodot game engine/GDScript, since 3.3.3 (2021) TAU\n\nCrystal, since 0.36.0 (2021) Math::TAU\n\nJava, OpenJDK, since 19 (2022) Math.TAU\n\nJSCAD, since 2.6.3 (2022) TAU\n\nLiberty Eiffel, upcoming (202x) Tau\n\nInclusion of a constant tau was rejected by the following projects:\n\nDart (2011)\n\nJulia (2013)\n\nJavaScript (2014)\n\nRuby (2016)\n\nNumPy (2017)\n\nGo (2020)\n\nLuau (2022)\n\nC++ (2022)\n\n$$\\begin{split} \\sin(\\alpha) &= \\sin(\\alpha + \\textcolor{orange}{\\tau}) \\quad\\forall \\alpha\\\\\\ \\cos(\\alpha) &= \\cos(\\alpha + \\textcolor{orange}{\\tau}) \\quad\\forall \\alpha\\\\\\ \\tan(\\alpha) &= \\tan(\\alpha + \\textcolor{orange}{\\tau}) \\quad\\forall \\alpha \\end{split}$$\n\nWith τ being a full revolution, the following identities are very easy to grasp (for integers n).
