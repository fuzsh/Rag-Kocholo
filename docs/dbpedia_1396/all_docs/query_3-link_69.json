        "text": "Once you’ve hung artwork for an exhibition, how are you going to pass on the details of the works to visitors? There are several different options for labeling your work in this setting, though each should let visitors know:\n\nThe artist’s name\n\nThe title of the work\n\nThe medium of the work\n\nThe size of the work\n\nThe price of the work (if applicable)\n\nHere is an example:\n\nVincent van Gogh\n\nThe Starry Night, 1889\n\nOil on canvas\n\n73.7 cm × 92.1 cm (29 in × 36¼ in)\n\nBelow are some options for how to label artworks in a professional exhibition setting.\n\nSkip the hassle of formatting! Print and mount your own gallery and museum quality art labels using our Canva Art Label Templates.\n\nCustom vinyl lettering for artwork labels\n\nOften galleries and museums will use vinyl to display an artist’s name and / or the title of the show near the entryway. Next time you visit an institution, have a look. Custom-cut vinyl lettering is easily removable and will not damage walls.\n\nSince vinyl lettering can be cut very small, you can adhere the information for each piece directly beside each artwork. Check with a vinyl cutting professional to see what size the text could be. They may also have specifics about what is available in terms of colours and fonts. Two vinyl cutters in Vancouver include:\n\nAllegra Press\n\nSignmaster Signs\n\nCreating a map for artwork info\n\nMaking a map of the gallery is a good option if you want to keep the walls around your work entirely clear of other information or distractions. Using a floor plan of the gallery, number your works and provide a corresponding list.\n\nMaking adhesive labels for artwork labels\n\nIf you do not want to go to the expense of having custom vinyl cut for labels, you can use traditional printer labels to display your information. Some people stick these directly onto the wall, but unless the wall is perfectly flat and smooth, this usually looks a bit unprofessional. You can instead stick your labels onto mat board or foamcore, then using a ruler and ex-acto knife cut the edges away so that the label is flush with the mount."
