        "text": "CategoriesObject typeMaterials and techniques\n\nCarved walrus ivory\n\nBrief description\n\nTau-cross head, walrus ivory, Anglo-Norman, first quarter of 12th century\n\nPhysical description\n\nHead of a tau-cross carved in walrus ivory. On one side, two figures of men facing inwards and entangled amongst foliated scrolls, that on the right reaching up with his left hand to pick a fruit. On the other side, two winged griffins facing each other and caught up in foliate stalks which they bite. Pin-holes throughout indicate the attachment of metal mounts (perhaps of gilt-copper with jewels). The figures originally had black glass or jet beads inset in their eyes, only one of these survives, in the right eye of the griffin on the right.\n\nDimensions\n\nHeight: 4.5cm\n\nLength: 14.5cm\n\nThe applied portions in the centre, the knop at the top and the ends are missing, and the whole outer edge seems to have been cut down, possibly for a metal mount.StyleObject history\n\nPurchased from Webb, Â£75.\n\nHistorical significance: It has long been recognised that the present tau cross head is intimately related to a walrus ivory fragment showing a man entangled in foliate scrolls now in the British Museum, and it has even been thought to be of the same hand. The latter was found in 1920 on the site of the monastic infirmary at St. Albans.\n\nSubjects depictedSummary\n\nIvory was used all over Europe for religious works of art. It was often combined with precious metals and usually took the form of relief panels, for book covers, portable altars and caskets. An almost unbroken tradition of ivory carving extends from the Roman and Byzantine empires until the end of the 14th century. From ca. 1250, Paris became the centre of production for figures and reliefs intended for private devotion.\n\nThis head of a tau-cross in walrus-ivory, is of Anglo-Norman origin and from the first quaerter of 12th century.\n\nIt has long been recognised that the present tau cross head is intimately related to a walrus ivory fragment showing a man entangled in foliate scrolls now in the British Museum, and it has even been thought to be of the same hand. The latter was found in 1920 on the site of the monastic infirmary at St. Albans.\n\nBibliographic references\n\nKendrick, T.D. Late Saxon and Viking art.
