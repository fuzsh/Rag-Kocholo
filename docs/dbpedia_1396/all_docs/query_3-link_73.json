His stance has a little more sway to it, with a continuous, swooping line from his should, to his hip, down to his knees and all the way to his feet. He is less upright than Warrior A because of this posture.\n\nBoth Warrior A and B are life-size and would have held shields and worn helmets made of silver.[5] This is an example of lost-wax casting that shows a kind of technical expertise, as the size of the statues would have made this even more challenging. Also, the bronze material itself obscures the modeling but gives a sense of lifelike musculature because of the reflective nature of the medium.[6]\n\nThese two warriors are an example of the severe style. “The Severe style is marked by an increased interest in the use of bronze as a medium as well as an increase in the characterization of the sculpture, among other features.”[7] This severe style can be seen in the placidity of the expression on both Warrior A and Warrior B’s faces. It can also be seen in the treatment on of the hair on top of Warrior A’s head. It is very close to his head with no loose strands except for below the headband.\n\nThe Riace warriors both display the abilities of the bronze medium to represent the dynamism versus the severe placid style. Together with this and their closeness to the contropposto stance, the Riace Warriors make for a smooth transition to the High Classical Greek period.\n\nBibliography\n\nArchino, Sarah.
