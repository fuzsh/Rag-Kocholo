Is there a tool like calipers in Zbrush or a way to measure a part of a body, change the units accordingly to real life example and then be able to measure other parts relatively to the first measurement made? For example I know that the distance between clavicles and pubic bone of a model is 57 cm. I need to make sure that everything else in the body of my sculpt will be relative to my model's measurements. How can I achieve it? Huge thanks to anyone reaching out to help!"
