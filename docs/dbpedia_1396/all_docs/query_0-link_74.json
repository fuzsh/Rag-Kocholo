More specifically, the present invention relates to Tau-specific antibodies, fragments thereof, and uses thereof in visualizing damage from traumatic brain injury.\n\nTau is an intracellular microtubule-associated protein that regulates microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, and neurite outgrowth. Tau promotes microtubule assembly and is believed to be responsible for establishing neuronal polarity (Avila et al, 2004; Hirokawa et al, 1996).\n\na natively unfolded protein, the C-terminus of the tau binds to the axonal microtubules while the N-terminus binds to the neural plasma membrane.\n\nthe functions of tau are modulated via sit- specific phosphorylation. While phosphorylation is necessary for functional regulation, abnormal and excessive phosphorylation, observed in pathological states such as Alzheimer's disease and TBI, renders the protein non-functional, thus disrupting micro-tubular structure and cell death.\n\nAD Alzheimer's disease\n\nPHF paired helical filaments\n\nTraumatic brain injury may be classified into two components: i) primary brain injury occurring as a result of direct impact, and ii) secondary brain injury associated with the molecular and cellular response to injury that follows primary impact (Park et al, 2008). Recently, abnormal deposition of tau was observed in in post-mortem brains obtained from patients who suffered repetitive mild TBI during their lifetime (McKee et al, 2009; Goldstein et al, 2012). More specifically, the hyper-phosphorylated tau accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles (DeKosky et al, 2010) in the deep sulci and gyri, amygdala, and hippocampi. Hyper-phosphorylated tau has been observed both intracellular and extracellular locations in traumatic brain injury.\n\nTBI traumatic brain injury\n\nHyper-phosphorylation of tau relates to the characteristic cognitive impairment in both AD and TBI. Indeed, many studies suggest a link between TBI and a higher risk of later developing AD (Van Den Heuvel et al, 2007). While there have been reports on long term predictors of moderate and severe TBI relative to neurological function and recovery, more sensitive, specific and non-invasive methods of assessment are needed, specifically for mild TBI (Bigler & Maxwell, 2012; Marshall et al, 2012). This is particularly highlighted by the fact that, in the absence of definitive imaging techniques, diagnosis largely relies on a range of symptom complex.\n\ntau is in a natively unfolded conformation state (Jeganathan et al, 2008).\n\nhigh-affinity monoclonal antibodies against tau have been generated in tau- knockout mice (Selenica et al, 2014), these have limited applications due to their large size in crossing the neuronal barriers or safety concerns for in vivo use.\n\nthe lack of specific and safe targeting agents for imaging of TBI as well as AD is an obstacle in early diagnosis. As a result, there is no mechanism in the art to visualize tau abnormality using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.\n\nMR magnetic resonance\n\nthe present invention relates to Tau-specific antibodies, fragments thereof, and uses thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to Tau-specific antibodies, fragments thereof, and uses thereof in visualizing damage from traumatic brain injury.\n\nthe present invention further provides an isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof, comprising a complementarity determining region (CDR) 1 sequence of GFTFSNFA (SEQ ID NO: 1\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof may comprise a CDR1 sequence of GFTFSNFA (SEQ ID NO:1), a CDR2 sequence of IDNDGGRT\n\nthe isolated antibody or fragment thereof may comprise a sequence selected from the group consisting of:\n\nQVKLEESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSNFAMTWVRQSPGKGLEWVSAIDNDGG RTSYSDSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTLYLQMNSLKPEDTAMYYCAAMNLATRKWELWGQG TQVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:7, referred to herein as Tau15); QVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLKLSCAASGFTGDHYAMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSTIYSYSP NTYYVDSVKDRFTISLDNAKNTLYLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAADLEVAEYYAYWGQGT QVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:8, referred to herein as Tau81); and a sequence substantially identical thereto.\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof as described above may be a single- domain antibody (sdAb); the sdAb may be of camelid origin.\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may be presented in a multivalent display format.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may be linked to a Fc or fragment thereof, for example a Fc, C m domain, C H2 domain, C H 3 domain, the hinge region, or any combination thereof.\n\nthe Fc or fragment thereof may be the mouse Fc gamma 2b or human Fc gammal .\n\nthe Fc or fragment thereof may be the human hinge region sequence AEPISCDKTHTCPPCP (SEQ ID NO:16) or ETSSPAEPKSCDKTHTCPPCP (SEQ ID NO:17).\n\nthe present invention also provides a nucleic acid molecule encoding the isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof as described herein.\n\na vector comprising the nucleic acid molecule as just described is also provided.\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof as described herein may be immobilized onto a surface.\n\nthe present invention further provides the isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof as described herein linked to a cargo molecule.\n\nthe cargo molecule may be a detectable agent, a therapeutic, a drug, a peptide, a growth factor, a cytokine, a receptor trap, a chemical compound, a carbohydrate moiety, an enzyme, an antibody or fragments thereof, a DNA- based molecule, a viral vector, or a cytotoxic agent; one or more liposomes or nanocarriers loaded with a detectable agent, a therapeutic, a drug, a peptide, an enzyme, and antibody or fragments thereof, a DNA-based molecule, a viral vector, or a cytotoxic agent; or one or more nanoparticle, nanowire, nanotube, or quantum dots.\n\nthe cargo molecule may be a detectable agent, or a liposomes or nanocarriers loaded with a detectable agent.\n\nthe detectable label may be a superparamagnetic nanoparticle.\n\nthe nanoparticle may be a NaDyF4-NaGdF4 core-shell nanoparticle, a silica-coated ferrous oxide, gold nanoparticle, p-NaYF 4 :Yb,Gd,Tm, gadolinium nanoparticle, or a solid lipid nanoparticles.\n\nSuch nanoparticles may have a size of about 10 to about 50 nm.\n\nthe nanoparticles may have about 4 to about 22 antibodies or fragment thereof conjugated to the surface of the nanoparticle.

More specifically, the present invention relates to Tau-specific antibodies, fragments thereof, and uses thereof in visualizing damage from traumatic brain injury.\n\nthe present invention further provides an isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof, comprising a complementarity determining region (CDR) 1 sequence of GFTFSNFA (SEQ ID NO: 1\n\nimmunoglobulin refers to a protein constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains; various Ig isotypes exist, including IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.\n\neach chain fold folds into a number of distinct globular domains joined by more linear polypeptide sequences.\n\nV L variable\n\nC L constant\n\nC H constant\n\nC H constant\n\nFv antigen binding region\n\nthe light and heavy chain variable regions are responsible for binding the target antigen and can therefore show significant sequence diversity between antibodies.\n\nthe constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events.\n\nthe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen- binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen.\n\nthe majority of sequence variability occurs in six hypervariable regions, three each per variable heavy (V H ) and light (V L ) chain; the hypervariable regions combine to form the antigen-binding site, and contribute to binding and recognition of an antigenic determinant.\n\nthe specificity and affinity of an antibody for its antigen is determined by the structure of the hypervariable regions, as well as their size, shape, and chemistry of the surface they present to the antigen.\n\nVarious schemes exist for identification of the regions of hypervariability the two most common being those of Kabat and of Chothia and Lesk.\n\nKabat et al (1991 ) define the \"complementarity-determining regionsâ (CDR) based on sequence variability at the antigen- binding regions of the V H and V L domains.\n\nCDR complementarity-determining regions\n\nChothia and Lesk (1987) define the \"hypervariable loops\" (H or L) based on the location of the structural loop regions in the V H and V L domains.\n\nCDR and hypervariable loop regions that are adjacent or overlapping\n\nthose of skill in the antibody art often utilize the terms \"CDRâ and âhypervariable loopâ interchangeably, and they may be so used herein.\n\nthe CDR/loops are referred to herein according to the more recent IMGT numbering system (Lefranc, M.-P. et al., 2003), which was developed to facilitate comparison of variable domains.\n\nconserved amino acids such as Cys23, Trp41 , Cys104, Phe/Trp1 18, and a hydrophobic residue at position 89\n\nFR1 positions 1 to 26; FR2: 39 to 55; FR3: 66 to 104; and FR4: 1 18 to 129) and of the CDR (CDR1 : 27 to 38, CDR2: 56 to 65; and CDR3: 105 to 1 17) is provided.\n\nan \"antibody fragmentâ as referred to herein may include any suitable antigen-binding antibody fragment known in the art.\n\nthe antibody fragment may be a naturally-occurring antibody fragment, or may be obtained by manipulation of a naturally-occurring antibody or by using recombinant methods.\n\nan antibody fragment may selected from the group consisting of a Fv, single-chain Fv (scFv; a molecule consisting of V L and V H connected with a peptide linker), Fab, F(ab') 2 , single-domain antibody (sdAb; a fragment composed of a single V L or V H ), and multivalent presentations of any of these.\n\nAntibody fragments such as those just described may require linker sequences, disulfide bonds, or other type of covalent bond to link different portions of the fragments; those of skill in the art will be familiar with the requirements of the different types of fragments and various approaches and various approaches for their construction.\n\nthe antibody fragment may be an sdAb derived from naturally- occurring sources.\n\nHeavy chain antibodies of camelid origin Hamers-Casterman et al, 1993\n\nV H H sdAb have also been observed in shark and are termed V NAR (Nuttall et al, 2003).\n\nOther sdAb may be engineered based on human Ig heavy and light chain sequences (Jespers et al, 2004; To et al, 2005).\n\nsdAb includes those sdAb directly isolated from V H , V H H, V L , or V NAR reservoir of any origin through phage display or other technologies, sdAb derived from the aforementioned sdAb, recombinantly produced sdAb, as well as those sdAb generated through further modification of such sdAb by humanization, affinity maturation, stabilization, solubilization, camelization, or other methods of antibody engineering. Also encompassed by the present invention are homologues, derivatives, or fragments that retain the antigen-binding function and specificity of the sdAb.\n\nNatural camelid sdAb can be advantageous due to their small size, ease of genetic manipulation, high affinity and solubility, overall stability and unique refolding capacity. They possess desirable properties for antibody molecules, such as high thermostability, high detergent resistance, relatively high resistance to proteases (Dumoulin et al, 2002) and high production yield (Arbabi-Ghahroudi et al, 1997); they can also be engineered to have very high affinity by isolation from an immune library (Li et al, 2009) or by in vitro affinity maturation (Davies & Riechmann, 1996).\n\nV H H which represent a significant amount of antibodies found in camelid, have highly conserved amino acids in specific locations of the framework region 2 (FR2): Phe or Tyr at position 42, Glu at position 49, Arg at position 50, and Gly, Leu, or Trp at position 52, where amino acid positions are numbered according to the IMGT system.\n\nFR2 framework region 2\n\nV H fragments have also been isolated from nonimmune and immune camelid libraries (Tanha et al, 2002). These conventional sdAb possess consensus amino acids in FR2 as follows: Val at position 42, Gly at position 49, Leu at position 50, and Trp at position 52, where amino acid positions are numbered according to the IMGT system.\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention comprises the V H hallmark amino acids in FR2; specifically, Val at position 42, Gly at position 49, Leu at position 50, and Trp at position 52 (according to the IMGT numbering system).\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof as described herein lacking the solubilizing residues or typical camelid V H H hallmark residues may render the antibodies closer to human antibodies, leading to a decreased risk of adverse immunogenicity in humans.\n\na sdAb comprises a single immunoglobulin domain that retains the immunoglobulin fold; most notably, only three CDR/hypervariable loops form the antigen-binding site.\n\nCDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 are referred to herein as CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3, and numbered as defined by Lefranc, M.P. et al. (2003; IMGT numbering).\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention specifically binds Tau, a member of a family of microtubule-associated proteins and responsible for stabilizing microtubules within the neuronal cytoskeleton.\n\nTau a member of a family of microtubule-associated proteins and responsible for stabilizing microtubules within the neuronal cytoskeleton.\n\nthe protein behaves as a natively unfolded protein.\n\nSix tau isoforms exist in human brain tissue, and they are distinguished by their number of binding domains. Three isoforms (3R/2N, 3R/1 N, 3R/0N) have three binding domains and the other three (4R/2N, 4R/1 N, 4R/0N) have four binding domains.\n\nthe binding domains are located in the carboxy-terminus of the protein and are positively-charged (allowing it to bind to the negatively-charged microtubule).\n\nTau is a phosphoprotein with numerous potential serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) phosphorylation sites. Abnormal and excessive phosphorylation has been observed in pathological states, rendering Tau non-functional and disrupting micro-tubular structure leading to cell death (Ballatore et al, 2007; Avila et al, 2004). More recently abnormal deposition of tau, also termed neurofibrillary tangles, has been associated with the post mortem brains of individuals who sustained multiple repetitive TBI (McKee et al, 2009).\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may specifically bind hyper- phosphorylated Tau.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may be a sdAb.\n\nthe sdAb may be selected from the group consisting of sdAb of camelid origin or sdAb derived from a camelid V H or V H H, and thus may be based on camelid framework regions; alternatively, the CDR described above may be grafted onto a scaffold selected from the group consisting of V NAR , V H H, V H or V L framework regions.\n\nthe hypervariable loops described above may be grafted onto the framework regions of other types of antibody fragments (selected from the group consisting of Fv, scFv, Fab) of any source (for example, mouse or human) or proteins of similar size and nature onto which CDR can be grafted (for example, see Nicaise et al, 2004).\n\nthe present invention further encompasses an antibody fragment that is \"humanizedâ using any suitable method known in the art, for example, but not limited to CDR grafting and veneering.\n\nHumanization of an antibody or antibody fragment comprises replacing an amino acid in the sequence with its human counterpart, as found in the human consensus sequence, without loss of antigen-binding ability or specificity; this approach reduces immunogenicity of the antibody or fragment thereof when introduced into human subjects.\n\none or more than one of the CDR defined herein may be fused or grafted to a human variable region (V H , or V L ), to other human antibody (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM), to antibody fragment framework regions (Fv, scFv, Fab), or to proteins of similar size and nature onto which CDR can be grafted (Nicaise et al, 2004).\n\nCDR grafting is known in the art and is described in at least the following: US Patent No. 6180370, US Patent No. 5693761 , US Patent No. 6054297, US Patent No. 5859205, and European Patent No. 626390. Veneering, also referred to in the art as \"variable region resurfacing\", involves humanizing solvent- exposed positions of the antibody or fragment; thus, buried non-humanized residues, which may be important for CDR conformation, are preserved while the potential for immunological reaction against solvent-exposed regions is minimized.\n\nVeneering is known in the art and is described in at least the following: US Patent No. 5869619, US Patent No. 5766886, US Patent No. 5821 123, and European Patent No. 519596. Persons of skill in the art would also be amply familiar with methods of preparing such humanized antibody fragments and humanizing amino acid positions.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 sequence of GFTFSNFA (SEQ ID NO:1 ), a CDR2 sequence of IDNDGGRT (SEQ ID NO:2), and a CDR3 sequence of AAMNLATRKWEL (SEQ ID NO:3).\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 sequence of GFTGDHYA (SEQ ID NO:4), a CDR2 sequence of IYSYSPNT (SEQ ID NO:5), and a CDR3 sequence of AADLEVAEYYAY (SEQ ID NO:6).\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may specifically bind Tau.\n\nthe isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof specifically binding Tau may be any suitable immunogen\n\na substantially identical sequence may comprise one or more conservative amino acid mutations. It is known in the art that one or more conservative amino acid mutations to a reference sequence may yield a mutant peptide with no substantial change in physiological, chemical, physico-chemical or functional properties compared to the reference sequence; in such a case, the reference and mutant sequences would be considered \"substantially identical\" polypeptides.\n\na conservative amino acid substitution is defined herein as the substitution of an amino acid residue for another amino acid residue with similar chemical properties (e.g. size, charge, or polarity). These conservative amino acid mutations may be made to the framework regions of the sdAb while maintaining the CDR sequences listed above and the overall structure of the CDR of the antibody or fragment; thus the specificity and binding of the antibody are maintained.\n\na conservative mutation may be an amino acid substitution.\n\nSuch a conservative amino acid substitution may substitute a basic, neutral, hydrophobic, or acidic amino acid for another of the same group.\n\nbasic amino acid it is meant hydrophilic amino acids having a side chain pK value of greater than 7, which are typically positively charged at physiological pH.\n\nBasic amino acids include histidine (His or H), arginine (Arg or R), and lysine (Lys or K).\n\nneutral amino acid also âpolar amino acidâ\n\nhydrophilic amino acids having a side chain that is uncharged at physiological pH, but which has at least one bond in which the pair of electrons shared in common by two atoms is held more closely by one of the atoms.\n\nPolar amino acids include serine (Ser or S), threonine (Thr or T), cysteine (Cys or C), tyrosine (Tyr or Y), asparagine (Asn or N), and glutamine (Gin or Q).\n\nhydrophobic amino acid (also ânon-polar amino acidâ) is meant to include amino acids exhibiting a hydrophobicity of greater than zero according to the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg (1984). Hydrophobic amino acids include proline (Pro or P), isoleucine (lie or I), phenylalanine (Phe or F), valine (Val or V), leucine (Leu or L), tryptophan (Trp or W), methionine (Met or M), alanine (Ala or A), and glycine (Gly or G).\n\nâAcidic amino acidâ refers to hydrophilic amino acids having a side chain pK value of less than 7, which are typically negatively charged at physiological pH.\n\nAcidic amino acids include glutamate (Glu or E), and aspartate (Asp or D).\n\nSequence identity is used to evaluate the similarity of two sequences; it is determined by calculating the percent of residues that are the same when the two sequences are aligned for maximum correspondence between residue positions. Any known method may be used to calculate sequence identity; for example, computer software is available to calculate sequence identity. Without wishing to be limiting, sequence identity can be calculated by software such as NCBI BLAST2 service maintained by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (and as found at ca.expasy.org/tools/blast/), BLAST-P, Blast-N, or FASTA-N, or any other appropriate software that is known in the art.\n\nthe substantially identical sequences of the present invention may be at least 90% identical; in another example, the substantially identical sequences may be selected from the group consisting of at least 90, 91 , 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical, or any percentage there between, at the amino acid level to sequences described herein. Importantly, the substantially identical sequences retain the activity and specificity of the reference sequence. In a non-limiting embodiment, the difference in sequence identity may be due to conservative amino acid mutation(s). In a non-limiting example, the present invention may be directed to an antibody or fragment thereof comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of at least 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identical to that of the antibodies described herein.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may also comprise additional sequences to aid in expression, detection or purification of a recombinant antibody or fragment thereof.\n\nadditional sequences known to those of skill in the art may be used.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may comprise a targeting or signal sequence (for example, but not limited to OmpA), a detection/purification tag (for example, but not limited to c-Myc, His 5 , or His 6 ), or a combination thereof.\n\nthe additional sequence may be a biotin recognition site such as that described by Cronan et al in WO 95/04069 or Voges et al in WO/2004/076670.\n\nlinker sequences may be used in conjunction with the additional sequences or tags, or may serve as a detection/purification tag.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may also be in a multivalent display format, also referred to herein as multivalent presentation, or multimerized.\n\nMultimerization may be achieved by any suitable method known in the art. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, multimerization may be achieved using self-assembly molecules such as those described in Zhang et al (2004a; 2004b) and WO2003/046560, where pentabodies are produced by expressing a fusion protein comprising the antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention and the pentamerization domain of the â -subunit of an AB 5 toxin family (Merritt & Hoi, 1995).\n\na multimer may also be formed using the multimerization domains described by Zhu et al.\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof may be presented as a dimer, a trimer, or any other suitable oligomer. This may be achieved by methods known in the art, for example direct linking connection (Nielson et al, 2000), c-jun/Fos interaction (de Kruif & Logtenberg, 1996), \"Knob into holesâ interaction (Ridgway et al, 1996).\n\nAnother method known in the art for multimerization is to dimerize the antibody or fragment thereof using an Fc or a portion of the Fc, for example, but not limited to Fc, C m domain, C H 2 domain, C H 3 domain, the hinge region, or any appropriate combination thereof.\n\nthe Fc domain or a portion thereof may be of human origin, camelid origin, or other suitable origin.\n\nthe Fc or fragment thereof may be selected from various classes including, but not limited to, IgG, IgM, or various subclasses including, but not limited to lgG1 , lgG2, etc.\n\nthe Fc gene is inserted into a vector along with the sdAb gene to generate a sdAb-Fc fusion protein (Bell et al, 2010; Iqbal et al, 2010); the fusion protein is recombinantly expressed then purified.\n\nsdAb-Fc fusion protein Bell et al, 2010; Iqbal et al, 2010\n\nSuch multimerized antibodies are easy to engineer and to produce, can greatly extend the serum half-life of sdAb, and may be excellent tumor imaging reagents (Bell et al., 2010).\n\nthe Fc domain in the multimeric complex as just described may be any suitable Fc fragment known in the art.\n\nthe Fc fragment may be from any suitable source; for example, the Fc may be of an origin selected from the group consisting of mouse and human.\n\nthe Fc may be selected from the group consisting of the mouse Fcx2b fragment and human Fcx1 fragment (Bell et al, 2010; Iqbal et al, 2010).\n\nthe Fc fragment thereof may be selected from the group consisting of the human hinge region sequence AEPISCDKTHTCPPCP (SEQ ID NO:16) and ETSSPAEPKSCDKTHTCPPCP (SEQ ID NO: 17).\n\nEach subunit of the multimers described above may comprise the same or different antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention, which may have the same or different specificity. Additionally, the multimerization domains may be linked to the antibody or antibody fragment using a linker, as required; such a linker should be of sufficient length and appropriate composition to provide flexible attachment of the two molecules, but should not hamper the antigen-binding properties of the antibody.\n\ndimeric version of the antibody or fragment thereof include those selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:20 (referred to herein as DH-Tau15) and SEQ ID NO:23 (referred to herein as Fc-Tau15).\n\nthe antibody or fragment thereof as described herein may transmigrate across the neuronal cell membrane; it is possible that the antibody or fragment thereof as described herein transmigrates across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nthe brain is separated from the rest of the body by a specialized endothelial tissue known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\nBBB blood-brain barrier\n\nthe endothelial cells of the BBB are connected by tight junctions and efficiently prevent many therapeutic compounds from entering the brain.\n\nthe mechanism by which the sdAb crosses the neuronal cell membrane is currently unknown. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the variability of neuronal membrane pore size (micrometers) and the size of the sdAb-NP complex suggest a type of bulk-phase pinocytotic mechanism.\n\nthe present invention also encompasses nucleic acid sequences encoding the molecules as described herein. Given the degeneracy of the genetic code, a number of nucleotide sequences would have the effect of encoding the polypeptide, as would be readily understood by a skilled artisan.\n\nthe nucleic acid sequence may be codon-optimized for expression in various micro-organisms.\n\nthe present invention also encompasses vectors comprising the nucleic acids as just described. Furthermore, the invention encompasses cells comprising the nucleic acid and/or vector as described.\n\nthe present invention further encompasses the isolated or purified antibody or fragments thereof immobilized onto a surface using various methodologies; for example, and without wishing to be limiting, the antibody or fragment may be linked or coupled to the surface via one selected from the group consisting of His-tag coupling, biotin binding, covalent binding, adsorption, and the like.

However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.\n\nExample 1 Llama immunization and serum response\n\nV H H that targets tau a llama was immunized with a recombinant human tau protein, isoform 2N4R.\n\nThis recombinant Tau-441 protein (molecular weight 45.9 kDa) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.\n\nllama (Lama glama) was immunized by sub-cutaneous injection of recombinant Tau- 441 protein (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). On day 1 , the llama was injected with 200 pg of Tau-441 , in a total volume of 0.5 mL mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Four further injections of 100 pg of Tau-441 plus Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (Sigma) were performed on days 21 , 28, 35 and 42, again along with three other human proteins. Pre-immune blood was drawn before the first injection on day 1 and served as a negative control. Blood was collected on day 47.\n\nthe blood from day 47 was processed immediately to isolate peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).\n\nthe blood was diluted 1 :1 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and PBL were purified from the blood using the Lymphoprep Tube (Axis-Shield, Norway).\n\nthe cells were counted and stored as aliquots of about 1 x 10 7 cells at -80Â°C for future use.\n\nthe polyclonal immune responses of pre-immune and post-immune total serum as well as conventional and heavy chain antibody fractions obtained by protein A and G chromatography (as described in Baral et al, 2013) were analyzed by ELISA.\n\n96-well MaxisorpTM plates (Nalgene Nunc International, USA) were coated overnight at 4Â°C with 10 pg/mL of Tau-441 antigen in PBS. Wells were rinsed and blocked with 200 â of 1 % casein. Different dilutions of pre-immune, immune, and purified IgG fractions (G1 , G2, A1 and A2) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 .5 h. Wells were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, and incubated with goat anti-llama-HRP (1 :10,000 in PBS) (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Canada).\n\nTMB Tetramethylbenzidine\n\na immune V H H library was constructed based on RNA isolated from the PBL collected in Example 1 .\n\na phage display library was constructed as previously described (Baral et al, 2013). In brief, total RNA was isolated from approximately 1 x 10 7 lymphocytes collected on day 47 using a QIAamp RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Canada).\n\nFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer using 5 pg total RNA as template according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GE Healthcare). The cDNA was amplified by an equimolar mix of three variable region-specific sense primers:\n\nMJ1 5'-GCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCCSMKGTGCAGCTGGTGGAKTCTGGGGGA- 3' (SEQ ID NO:9)\n\nMJ2 5'-GCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCCCAGGTAAAGCTGGAGGAGTCTGGGGGA- 3' (SEQ ID NO:10)\n\nMJ3 5'-GCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCCCAGGCTCAGGTACAGCTGGTGGAGTCT-\n\nCH 2 b 3 5'-GGGGTACCTGTCATCCACGGACCAGCTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:13).\n\nthe PCR reaction mixture and PCR protocol utilized were as described in Baral et al (2013). Briefly, the PCR reaction mixture was set up in a total volume of 50 â with the following components: 1 -3 â cDNA, 5 pmol of MJ1 -3 primer mixture, 5 pmol of CH 2 or CH 2 b 3 primers, 5 â of 10x reaction buffer, 1 â of 10 mM dNTP, 2.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Hoffmann-La Roche).\n\nthe PCR protocol consisted of an (i) initial step at 94Â°C for 3 min, (ii) followed by 30 cycles of 94Â°C for 1 min, 55Â°C for 30 s, 72Â°C for 30 s and (iii) a final extension step at 72Â°C for 7 min.\n\nthe heavy chain fragments (550-650 bp in length) were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) as previously described (Baral et al, 2013).\n\nthe variable regions of the heavy chain antibodies (lgG2 and lgG3) were re-amplified in a second PCR reaction using oligonucleotides\n\nMJ8 5'-CATGTGTAGATTCCTGGCCGGCCTGGCCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:15) and methods as described above.\n\nthe amplified PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with Sfi â (New England Biolabs, Canada), and re-purified using the same kit.\n\nQiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit\n\nSfi â New England Biolabs, Canada\n\npMED1 phagemid vector 80 â 9 of pMED1 phagemid vector (Arbabi-Ghahroudi et al, 2009b) were digested with Sfi â overnight at 50Â°C. To minimize self-ligation, 20 units of Xho â and Pst â restriction enzymes were added to cut the excised fragment and the digestion reaction was incubated for an additional 2 h at 37Â°C. Twelve micrograms of digested VHH DNA were ligated with 40 â g (3: 1 molar ratio) S/y ' l-digested pMED1 phagemid vector using LigaFast Rapid DNA ligation system (Promega, USA) using methods previously described (Baral et al, 2013).\n\nthe ligated plasmids were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), eluted in a final volume of 100 â , and transformed into electrocompetent TG1 E. coli (Stratagene) using 5 â of ligated DNA aliquot per 100 â transformation reaction, as previously described (Arbabi- Ghahroudi et al, 2009b).\n\nthe resulting library was of approximately 1 x 10 7 transformants.\n\nthe VHH fragments from 30 colonies were PCR-amplified and sequenced to analyze the complexity of the library.\n\nthe library was expanded by culturing for 3-4 h in 2 x YT/ampicillin (100 â g mL) glucose (2% w/v) medium at 37Â°C.\n\nthe bacterial cells were pelleted, re-suspended in the same medium with 20% glycerol and stored at - 80Â°C.\n\nthe culture was then centrifuged at 4Â°C and infected bacterial pellets were re-suspended in 200 ml of 2xYT/Amp with 50 â 9/ â kanamycin and incubated at 37Â°C and 250 rpm.\n\nthe phage particles in the culture supernatant were incubated with 1 /5 volume of 20% PEG 8000/2.5M NaCI on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min.\n\nthe phage pellets were re-suspended in 2.0 ml of sterile PBS, titrated and used as input phage for panning.\n\n96-well MaxisorpTM plates were coated with 40 â g Tau-441 antigen per well overnight at 4Â°C; the wells were rinsed with PBS and blocked with PBS/1 % (w/v) casein for 2 h at 37Â°C. Approximately 10 12 phages were added to the blocked wells and incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C. After washing 5x with PBS/0.1 % Tween-20 and 5x with PBS, the bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M triethylamine neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, then used to infect exponentially growing TG1 E. coli.\n\nthe cells were superinfected with M13K07, incubated for an additional 30 min and grown overnight in 2 x YT containing ampicillin (100 â g/mL) and kanamycin (50 â g/mL) at 37Â°C.\n\nthe purified phage from the overnight culture was used as the input for the next round of panning. Panning was continued for three more rounds.\n\nthe same protocol as described above was used, except that the amount of recombinant antigen used to coat the plates was reduced to 30, 20, 20 â g/well and the washing cycle was increased to 7, 10, and 12x with PBS-T and PBS for the second, third and fourth rounds of panning, respectively.\n\nAnti-tau V H H identified in Example 2 were sub-cloned into expression plasmids for protein expression and purification.\n\nVHH genes for Tau15 and Tau81 were sub-cloned in pSJF2H expression vector between Bbsl and BamHI restriction enzyme sites by GenScript (USA).\n\nthe final construct included an OmpA leader sequence for secretion of sdAb proteins to the periplasmic space of E. coli, and a cmyc and His 6 tags for ease of purification, at the C-terminus of the sdAb.\n\nthe pellet was re-suspended in 30 ml of cold TES buffer (0.2M Tris-CI pH 8.0, 20% sucrose, 0.5mM EDTA). The suspension was incubated on ice and vortexed every 10 min for 1 h. Then 40 ml of cold TES (1/8 volume of total volume) was added and immediately vortexed for 1 minute and for 15 seconds every 10 min thereafter for 1 hto extract the protein from the periplasm. The periplasmic extracts containing sdAb were dialyzed overnight against buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 M NaCI, 10 mM imidazole) at 4Â°C then filtered through a 0.45 pm membrane (EMD Millipore, Canada).\n\nbuffer 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 M NaCI, 10 mM imidazole\n\nsdAb were eluted using gradient elution (buffer containing 500 mM imidazole); the fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. sdAb concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm using theoretical MW and extinction coefficients calculated with the ExPASy ProtParam Tool (expasy.org/tools/protparam.html).\n\nProtein ELISA was performed for various clones. Briefly, ELISA wells were coated in duplicate with Tau-441 (at 5pg/mL) overnight at 4Â°C and blocked with blocking buffer (1 % (w/v) casein- PBS; pH 7.4) for 2 h. The sdAb extracted from the bacterial periplasm (Tau81 and Tau15,) were added (100 ul) to the blocked wells and incubated for additional 2 h at room temperature. Bound sdAb were detected using a rabbit anti-6His-HRP conjugate (at 1 :5000 dilution) and one hour incubation time at room temperature. The signal was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The results of protein ELISA are shown in Figure 3, where Tau15 and Tau81 clearly show strong binding signals.\n\nthe Tau15 and Tau81 constructs expressed and purified in Example 3 were characterized using size exclusion chromatography, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and melting temperature analysis.\n\nSize exclusion chromatography employing SuperdexTM 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) was used to eliminate any possible aggregates prior to Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis.\n\nthe running buffer used was HBS-EP+ buffer (10mM HEPES, pH7.4 containing 150mM NaCI, 3mM EDTA and 0.005% P20 surfactant), at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\n\nConcentrations of fractions used for SPR analysis were determined to be 1 .14 to 2.0 mg/mL by measuring absorbance at 280nm wavelength.\n\nthe SEC analysis suggested that the antibodies were monomeric, based on the elution volume compared to standards ( Figure 4).\n\nSPR Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\nMonomeric sdAb (Example 4) were injected over immobilized Tau-441 at a concentration of 500 nM for the test run and concentrations ranging from 50- 6000 nM (Tau-441 ) or 20-6000nM (for tau-p) for steady state analysis.\n\nthe running buffer for all SPR experiments was HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCI, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.05% surfactant P20; GE Healthcare).\n\nthe sdAb were injected at 20 pL/min for 3 min with a dissociation time of 7 min for the test run, and at 20 pL/min for 2 min with a dissociation time of 6 min for the steady state analysis. Data was analyzed using the Biacore T200 evaluations software Version 2.0.\n\nsdAb Tau 15 and Tau81 showed binding to tau with a fast on and fast off rate.\n\nthe results show a monovalent interaction of Tau 15 and Tau81 with tau, with both sdAb fitting the Langmuir-equation based 1 :1 binding model.\n\nthe KD value for the interaction between Tau 15 and Tau81 sdAb and immobilized tau were derived by fitting the data to a steady state model and are reported in Table 1 .\n\nthe two sdAb had micromolar affinity binding to tau, with KD ranging from 0.7 â to 0.8 â .\n\nTau 15 showed an affinity of 0.6 â to tau-p\n\nTau81 showed an affinity of 0.75 â to tau-p.\n\nSize exclusion chromatograms (Fig. 4) confirmed that Tau15 and Tau81 were monomeric.\n\nTau81 tau 55 5.07 x 10 \"7 696.60 Melting temperature: The thermal stability of the Tau15 and Tau81 was evaluated using melting temperature (T m ) measurement by CD spectroscopy.\n\nT m melting temperature\n\nFilter sterilized buffer 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, stored at room temperature\n\n0.2 ml of SGpg/mL Tau15 and TauSi was separately tested in a 1 mm quartz (QS) cuvette, pre- cleaned with Hellmanex II quartz cleaning solution 2% (Hellmanex).\n\na test scan on sdAb Tau15 was performed to determine the optimum wavelength to use in the assay. Three accumulations were collected between 190 nm-205 nm with a 1 mm bandwidth, 20 nm/min scan speed and 1 nm data pitch. Based on the data generated from this test scan, wavelengths 200nm and 205nm were selected due to the large difference in eliiptscsty between folded and unfolded states at these wavelengths. Thermal unfolding was measured at 200 and 205 nm with CD measurements taken from 25Â°C to 96Â°C. Raw eilipticity data (mdeg) was exported and converted to molar eliiptscsty, [ â ]. Tm (thermal unfolding midpoint temperature) was obtained by using the sigmoidal Boitzmann function in Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, USA) to fit the data.\n\nlanthanide (or rare earth) based nanoparticles were produced and bioconjugated to the sdAb of Example 3.\n\nColloidal NaDyF4-NaGdF4 core-shell nanoparticles were selected for the independent optimization of T1 and T2 sequences for enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) visibility, since T1 is most affected by surface Gd 3+ ions and T2 relaxation time by the \"bulk\" magnetization of the Dy 3+ core.\n\nthe proposed nanoparticles can be made with minimal polydispersities in the size of the core and a controlled shell thickness of less than 1 nm.\n\nthe synthesis of these nanoparticles is highly reproducible - it can be carried out at >100 mg with easy surface modification for water- dispersibility and subsequent chemical modification.\n\nNanoparticles were prepared at the University of Victoria. Synthesis of cubic (a) phase NaGdF4 nanoparticles: Gadolinium oxide (1 .0 mmol) was added to 10 mL of 50% trifluoroacetic acid in a three-necked 100 ml_ round bottom flask and was refluxed at 85Â°C for 5 h (Johnson et al, 2012). Excess water was evaporated at 65Â°C overnight to yield gadolinium trifluoroacetate. 5 mL oleic acid, 5 mL oleylamine and 10 mL 1 - octadecene were added to it and heated at 120Â°C for 45 min under vacuum to remove residual water and oxygen.\n\ndysprosium (III) chloride hexahydrate (1 mmol) was added to 1 .5 mL oleic acid and 7.5 mL 1 -octadecene in a three-necked 50 mL round bottom flask and stirred under vacuum at 120Â°C for 45 min.\n\nthe solution was brought back to room temperature, to which was added 2.5 mmol sodium hydroxide and 4 mmol ammonium fluoride in 10 mL methanol; the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Methanol was then removed at 80Â°C. The temperature was raised to 306Â°C ( â 15Â°C/min) under argon and the solution was stirred vigorously for 1 h 15 min (Das et al, 2012).\n\nNanoparticles were characterized using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction.\n\nTEM images were acquired using a JEOL JEM-1400 microscope operating at 80 kV.\n\nthe nanoparticle dispersion in hexane was drop- cast onto a formvar carbon film supported on a 300 mesh copper grid (3 mm in diameter) and allowed to dry in air at room temperature before imaging. The size distribution was obtained from averaging a minimum of 250 nanoparticles.\n\nExample 5 The NaDyF4-NaGdF4 core-shell nanoparticles produced and characterize in Example 5 were submitted to surface functionalization by phospholipids, followed by conjugation to the Tau15 sdAb (Example 3). Nanoparticles were prepared and conjugated to the anti-tau sdAb at the University of Victoria.\n\nNaDyF4/NaGdF4 core/shell nanoparticles were dispersed in 0.4 mL toluene at 7.0 mg/mL and added with a combination of DSPE-PEG-NH2, DSPE-PEG-COOH and DSPE-PEG-Biotin (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 0.8 mL chloroform in an appropriate weight ratio of DSPE-PEG to nanoparticle required for further steps of bioconjugation; the proportion of DSPE-PEG-NH2, DSPE-PEG-COOH and DSPE-PEG-Biotin in the combination will vary based on the desired sdAb:NP ratio (see below).\n\nBinding antibody and streptavidin-Alexa 488 conjugate with nanoparticles NaDyF4/NaGdF4 core/shell nanoparticles were coated with 1 ,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphoethanolamine- N-[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG-biotin; Avanti Polar Lipids), 1 ,2-distearoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[carboxyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG- COOH; Avanti Polar Lipids) and 1 ,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N- [methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-mPEG; Avanti Polar Lipids) and dispersed in deionized water.\n\nDSPE-PEG-biotin Biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)\n\nthe nanoparticle solution was diluted to 1 mL in deionized water and added with 50 â of 2 mg/mL 1 -[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide methiodide (EDC.Mel) and 25 of 2 mg/mL N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (sulfo-NHS).\n\nEDC.Mel 3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide methiodide\n\nsulfo-NHS N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt\n\nNHS-Alexa 488 with nanoparticles NaDyF4/NaGdF4 core/shell nanoparticles coated with 1 ,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG-NH2; Avanti Polar Lipids) and DSPE- mPEG were dispersed in deionized water. 10 â of 1 mg/mL NHS-Alexa 488 in anhydrous DMF was added to 1 mL of the nanoparticle dispersion and stirred overnight in the dark. The solution was centrifuged at 19000 g for 30 min and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline.\n\nCalibration was done by analyzing serial dilutions of a mixed element synthetic standard containing a known amount of dysprosium. Each sample, standard and blank, was spiked with indium (to a concentration of â 7ppb) as the internal standard to correct for signal drift and matrix effects. Accuracy was confirmed by analysis of a standard reference material.\n\nthe NaDyF4 core had a hexagonal closed pack crystal structure with a density of 5.1 g/cc.\n\nthe nanoparticle-antibody conjugates showed typical UV absorption peaks at 280 nm.\n\nâ 280 (5500 X â â ) + (1490 X r â Tyr ) + (125 X â 5 _ 5 )\n\nthe numbers are the molar absorbance of tryptophan (Trp; 5500), tyrosine (Tyr; 1490) and cysteine (i.e., the disulphide bond, S-S; 125), â â , ( j yr and n.\n\nS -s are number of Trp, Tyr residues and disulphide bonds in the antibody, respectively.\n\nUV absorption spectra were obtained in a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 spectrometer using the photomultiplier tube detector in the UV range.\n\nthe average number of sdAb per nanoparticle in the stock solution was determined to be 4, 12 or 22.\n\nExample 6 The sdAb-nanoparticle complex produced in Example 6 was utilized for in vitro testing in both live and fixed hippocampal neuronal co-cultures.\n\nHippocampal co-cultures Primary dissociated co-cultures of hippocampal neurons and glia were prepared from newborn (P0) Sprague Dawley rat pups (Charles River, USA) as previously described (Goda & Colicos, 2006). Co-cultures were plated at a density of 10 5 cells/well in each well of a 24-well plate containing poly-D-lysine and laminin treated 12 mm round cover glass.\n\nCo-cultures were maintained in Basal Media Eagle supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% B27, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 â g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. Two thirds of the growth medium was exchanged twice weekly.\n\nImmunocytochemistry in live hippocampal co-cultures Anti-tau sdAb-NaDyF4-NaGdF4- Alexa488 or NaDyF4-NaGdF4-Alexa488 nanoparticles (4:1 , 12:1 , or 22:1 sdAb:NP) were directly added to the medium of hippocampal co-cultures at final concentrations of 1 :5, 1 :10, 1 :20, or 1 :50. Co-cultures were incubated with the nanoparticles overnight at 37Â°C, and imaging performed on an Olympus BX61 W1 microscope with 40x 0.8NA water-immersible lenses.\n\nCo-cultures were then incubated overnight in blocking solution containing 1 :100 anti-tau sdAb-NaDyF4- NaGdF4-Alexa488 complex (4:1 , 12:1 , or 22:1 sdAb:NP), 1 :100 NaDyF4-NaGdF4-Alexa488, or 1 :200 rabbit anti-tau commercial antibody (Sigma Aldrich).\n\nCo-cultures treated with the rabbit anti-tau antibody were subsequently incubated with 1 :2000 donkey anti-rabbit cy3 secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs) for 1 h. Imaging was initially performed on an Olympus BX61 W1 microscope with 40x 0.8NA water-immersible lenses.\n\nthe anti-tau sdAb-NaDyF4-NaGdF4-Alexa488 complex also distinctly labeled neuronal tau proteins in live hippocampal co-culture preparations when added to the culture media for an overnight incubation at 37Â°C ( Figure 12A).\n\nConstructs comprising Tau15 (Example 2) fused to a human hinge region sequence or to a human antibody fragment crystallisable (Fc) to enhance its binding affinity.\n\nthe PCR reaction mixture and PCR protocol utilized were as described in Baral et al (2013).\n\na human lgG1 hinge sequence (ETSSPAEPKSCDKTHTCPPCP; SEQ ID NO:17), a cmyc tag, and a His 6 tag were added to the C-terminal of the Tau15 V H sequence using primers:\n\nBbsl2VHH TATGAAGACAC.CAGGCCCAGGTAAAGCTGGAGGAGTCT (SEQ ID NO:18) and HING1 FOR: CAGTTGTTCGGATCCTGGGCACGGTGGGCATGTGTG (SEQ ID NO:19). to produce the dimeric hinge Tau15 construct (DH-Tau15; SEQ ID NO:20).\n\nthe Tau 15 VH was re-amplified by PCR using the following primers to add the EcoRI site for cloning into pTT5-Fc1 cassette: hFc5:\n\nBamHI FR4 5'-GGGGTACCTGTCATCCACGGACCAGCTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:22).\n\nthe sequence of the full Fc-Tau15 fusion construct is given in SEQ ID NO:23.\n\nthe amplified PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with Bbsl and BamHI for the hinge dimer or EcoRI and BstEII for Fc fusion (New England Biolabs, Canada), and re-purified using the same kit.\n\nQiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit\n\nthe hinge dimer PCR products were cloned into the pSJF2H expression vector between Bbsl and BamHI restriction enzyme sites.\n\nthe final construct further included an OmpA leader sequence, for secretion of sdAb proteins to the periplasmic space of E. coli.\n\nthe Fc PCR products were cloned in pTT5 vector between EcoRI and BstEII restriction enzyme sites to replace an existing camelid V H H in the pTT5-Fc fusion cassette (Durocher, 2002).\n\nthe dimeric hinge Tau15 was expressed and purified as described in Example 3.\n\na mammalian cell line was transfected with the Fc-Tau15 construct, and the V H -Fc fusion was expressed and purified as previously described in Tom et al (2008). Briefly, 100 â g of Fc- Tau15 plasmid DNA was used to transiently transfect HEK-293-6E cells. Expressed Fc-Tau15 fusion proteins were harvested from the cell culture supernatant and purified by protein A affinity chromatography.\n\nProtein ELISA was performed for DH-Tau15 and Fc-Tau15 as described in Example 3, except that bound DH-Tau15 was detected using a rabbit anti-6His-HRP conjugate, while bound Tau- 15 was detected using a protein A-HRP conjugate. The results of protein ELISA are shown in Figure 13, where strong binding signals for DH-Tau15 and Fc-Tau15 were observed.\n\nExample 9 Biophysical characterization of dimeric anti-tau sdAb\n\nDH-Tau15 and Fc-Tau15 constructs expressed and purified in Example 8 were characterized using size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance analysis.\n\nSize exclusion chromatography Size exclusion chromatography for the DH-Tau15 and Fc- Tau15 were performed as described in Example 4. The SEC analysis suggested that the antibody constructs were non-aggregating, based on the elution volume compared to standards ( Figure 14). However, a small peak (at the elution volume expected to be monomeric VH, which did not form the dimer) was observed in the dimeric hinge chromatogram.\n\nSPR Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\nExample 10 Anti-tau sdAb for in vivo imaging\n\nExample 6 The sdAb-nanoparticle complex produced in Example 6 was utilized for in vivo imaging in rats with induced head trauma. A schematic showing the experimental protocol is shown in Figure 16A.\n\nMR Imaging A 9.4T/21 cm horizontal bore magnet (Magnex, UK) with a Biospec console (Bruker, Germany) was used for MR imaging. The volume radiofrequency coil (3 cm diameter x 3 cm length) was applied for signal transmission and reception. After placing an animal in the magnet under maintenance anesthesia, axial slices were positioned within the sample.\n\nFOV field of view\n\nT1 , T2and T2* values of the samples were calculated using a single exponential fitting of the signal from the regions of interest (ImageJ, NIH USA). MR acquisitions were performed prior to the injection of anti-tau sdAb-NaDyF4-NaGdF4 nanoparticle complex, as well as 15 and 30 minutes following the injection of the agent.\n\nMR imaging showed imaging signal changes with T2 hypointensity observed in two rats, mainly in the left cortices, hippocampi, and thalamus. There were some non-specific signal changes in the remaining two animals, with mild tau staining in one and no staining the other.\n\nTau histopathology showed positive staining for tau mainly in the cortex of the affected rats, with imaging correlation. Staining for tau showed immunoreactivity of tau and confirmed deposition of neurofibrillary tangles or hyperphosphorylated tau.\n\nimaging changes were noted in thalamus in three out of four animals, the area only showed weakly positive staining for tau. Control animals did not show any of the changes noted for rats with TBI.\n\nthe results show that the anti-tau antibodies and anti-tau antibody conjugates of the present invention are useful for imaging in vivo.\n\nthe findings are unique and demonstrate for the first time that tau is able to be visualized using a novel tau specific sdAb-nanoparticle complex and MR imaging. This establishes the present visualization approach as a non-invasive, non radioactive imaging biomarker for mild repetitive TBI, which presently does not exist.\n\nNaDyF4 Nanoparticle NaDyF4 nanoparticles: a Highly Efficient T2 Contrast Agent for Ultra-High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging J.
