        "text": "Have you ever imagined that parasites could be beneficial for brain diseases? TAU Researchers have reengineered Toxoplasma gondii, the 'cat parasite,' transforming it from a feared threat into a groundbreaking tool for delivering drugs directly to the brain. This surprising innovation not only overturns our expectations but also opens new possibilities for treating neurological disorders.\n\nIn a breakthrough study by an international team of scientists led by researchers from Tel Aviv and Glasgow Universities, the 'cat parasite' Toxoplasma gondii was engineered to deliver drugs to the human brain. The study was led by Prof. Oded Rechavi from the Department of Neurobiology and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University, together with his PhD student Dr. Shahar Bracha, and with Prof. Lilach Sheiner, an Israeli scientist and toxoplasma expert from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The results were published in the leading scientific journal Nature Microbiology.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges in treating neurological diseases is getting through the blood-brain barrier (BBB),\" explains Prof. Rechavi. \"It is tough to deliver drugs to the brain via the bloodstream, and this is especially true for large molecules such as proteins, the critical 'machines' that carry out many important functions inside the cell\".\n\nToxoplasma gondii - the 'cat parasite'\n\nThe creative solution proposed by the TAU team utilizes the unicellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can infect a vast variety of organisms, but reproduces only in the guts of cats. The parasite is very effective in infecting humans, with an estimated third of the global population infected at some point in their lives. Prof. Rechavi explains: \"Most people don't even feel the infection or only experience mild flu-like symptoms.\n\nDormant Parasite Sparks New Treatment\n\nThe parasite is, however, dangerous for people with immune failure due to conditions like AIDS, and for fetuses whose immune system has not yet developed. This is why pregnant women are advised not to eat raw meat which might contain the parasite, and to stay away from cats, which might deliver it through their feces. While ridding the body of the parasite, a healthy immune system has only limited access to the brain, and the parasite remains in the brain throughout the carrier's lifetime\".\n\nThe parasite's ability to penetrate the human brain and survive there in a dormant state, without reproducing, made it a perfect candidate for the researchers' novel approach: genetically engineering Toxoplasma gondii to secrete therapeutic proteins.\n\nCan Parasites Deliver Medications to the Brain?\n\n\"The parasite has three distinct secretion systems and we 'hitched a ride' on two of them\", says Prof. Rechavi. \"We did not intervene with the first system, which secretes proteins outside the neurons. The second system 'shoots' a 'harpoon' into the neuron, to enable penetration. Once inside, the parasite forms a kind of cyst that continues to secrete proteins permanently. We engineered the parasite's DNA to make it produce and secrete the proteins we want, which have therapeutic potential\".\n\n\"The parasite's ability to pass through the BBB and communicate with the neurons, combined with our ability to engineer the parasite, generate a golden opportunity for solving the great therapeutic challenge of delivering medications to the brain\", says Prof. Sheiner.\n\nIllustration of the activity of neurons\n\nIn this study, the team used transgenic model animals that were injected with parasites genetically engineered to produce and secrete proteins that travel into cell nuclei. Several lines of evidence proved that the proteins had been delivered to the target area and remained active in the neurons' nuclei. One of these was especially eye-catching: a protein that, delivered by the parasite, entered the nuclei and cut out specific DNA segments, causing the transgenic animals’ brains to glow in the dark.\n\nNew Method for Rett Syndrome\n\nThis breakthrough can have far-reaching implications for a series of severe diseases. In the present study, the researchers specifically demonstrated the delivery of a protein called MeCP2, whose deficiency is associated with Rett syndrome. \"This is a deadly syndrome caused by a deficiency in a single gene called MePC2 in brain cells, and our engineered Toxoplasma gondii was able to deliver it to the target cells\", says Prof. Rechavi. \"But this is just one example. There are many other diseases caused by deficiency or abnormal expression of a certain protein\". To ensure the method's safe and effective therapeutic implementation, for both drug delivery and genetic editing, a company named Epeius was established in collaboration with Ramot – the technology transfer company of Tel Aviv University, and with the University of Glasgow's research and innovation services.\n\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University tracked free-ranging Egyptian fruit bats from a colony based in the TAU’s I. Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research to answer a long-standing scientific question: Do animals have high and complex cognitive abilities, previously attributed only to humans? In particular, the study focused on the traits of episodic memory, mental time travel, planning ahead, and delayed gratification, arriving at highly thought-provoking conclusions.\n\nThe study was led by Prof. Yossi Yovel and Dr. Lee Harten from the School of Zoology and Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University. Other researchers included: Xing Chen, Adi Rachum, Michal Handel, and Aya Goldstein from the School of Zoology, Lior de Marcas from the Sagol School of Neuroscience, and Maya Fenigstein Levi and Shira Rosencwaig from the National Public Health Laboratory of Israel's Ministry of Health. The paper was published in Current Biology.\n\nProf. Yossi Yovel.\n\nProf. Yovel: \"For many years the cognitive abilities to recall personal experiences (episodic memory) and plan ahead were considered exclusive to humans. But more and more studies have suggested that various animals also possess such capabilities. Still, nearly all of these studies were conducted under laboratory conditions, since field studies on these issues are difficult to perform. Attempting to test these abilities in wild animals, we designed a unique experiment relying on the colony of free-ranging fruit bats based in TAU’s I. Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research\".\n\nHow Bats Keep Track of Food Resources\n\nThe researchers assumed that bats depending on fruit trees for their survival would need to develop an ability to track the availability of food both spatially (where are the fruit trees?) and over time (when does each tree give fruit?). Navigating through landscapes with numerous fruit and nectar trees, they would need to mentally track the resources in order to revisit them at the appropriate time. To test this hypothesis, a tiny high-resolution GPS tracker was attached to each bat, enabling the documentation of flight routes and trees visited for many months. The vast data collected in this way were thoroughly analyzed, producing some amazing results.\n\nThe first research question was: Do bats form a time map in their minds? To explore this issue, the researchers prevented the bats from leaving the colony for varying periods of time, from one day to a week. Dr. Harten: \"We wanted to see whether the bats could tell that time had elapsed and behave accordingly. We found that after one day of captivity, the bats would return to trees visited on the previous night. However, when a whole week had gone by, the older bats, based on past experience, avoided trees that had stopped bearing fruit in the interval. In other words: they were able to estimate how much time had passed since their last visit to each tree and knew which trees bore fruit for a short time and were no longer worth visiting. Young, inexperienced bats were unable to do this, indicating that this is an acquired skill that must be learned\".\n\nWhile the first research question looked at past experiences, the second dealt with the future: Do the bats exhibit future-oriented behaviors? Are they capable of planning ahead? To address this issue the researchers observed each bat's route to the first tree of the evening, possibly indicative of plans made before leaving the colony. Chen Xing: \"We found that usually the bats fly directly to a specific tree they know, sometimes 20 or 30 minutes away. Being hungry, they fly faster when that tree is further away, suggesting they plan where they are heading.\n\nMoreover, focused on their chosen target, they will pass by other trees, even good sources visited just yesterday – indicating a capacity for delayed gratification. We also found that the first bats to leave the colony choose trees bearing fruits rich in sugar, while the bats that leave later seek proteins.\" All these findings suggest that the bats plan their foraging before they leave the colony, and know exactly where they are flying and what kind of nourishment they are looking for.\n\nRethinking Intelligence in Animals\n\nProf. Yovel: \"The cognitive gap between humans and animals is one of the most fascinating issues in science. Our study demonstrates that fruit bats are capable of quite a complex decision-making process involving the three questions indicative of cognitive abilities: Where? (each tree's location); When? (when the tree bears fruit); and What? (the nourishment it provides – sugar vs. proteins). Once again we find that the gap is not cleat-cut, and that humans are not as unique as some might think. Apparently, humans and animals are all located on a spectrum, with almost any human ability found in animals as well\".\n\nA new development by researchers at the Faculty of Engineering at Tel Aviv University will help identify small drones in challenging scenarios, such as urban environments, low flight altitudes, and extreme weather conditions, enhancing the protection of airspaces via smart tagging. The research team notes that drone identification is generally conducted using radars, cameras, and transponders, with the latter providing real-time updates on location in civilian contexts. However, these methods can fail in harsh conditions, including limited line of sight, multiple air traffic participants, and tall buildings blocking satellite signals, among other challenges.\n\nThe researchers highlight that this new technology can overcome these challenges and provide a superior level of reliability by using smart stickers and a radar supported by an AI algorithm that classifies drones based on the electromagnetic radiation they scatter.\n\nThe development was led by Ph.D. students Omer Tzidki and Dmytro Vovchuk from Prof. Pavel Ginzburg’s lab, the Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering. The lab specializes in developing novel radar and wireless communication technologies, facing new and forthcoming challenges.\n\nDetecting Drones Beyond Sight\n\nOmer Tzidki points out that the problem of identifying the drones is especially critical when there is no direct line of sight, for example when the drone is hidden behind a cloud, in fog, or hard to see due to adverse weather conditions. In these situations, cameras alone are insufficient, and the use of radar becomes necessary.\n\nWith this new development, identification is carried out through an electromagnetic representation of the drone’s \"identity card\". This allows the radar to distinguish between drones with different IDs by using electromagnetic tagging on the drone’s wings. The AI algorithm, which relies on a neural network, classifies the drone as either friendly or hostile and operates successfully even in varying harsh conditions while minimizing the risk of accidents. Initial experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions in a sterile environment, followed by trials in an external setting to simulate real-world scenarios.\n\nProf. Pavel Ginzburg: \"The simplest things often work best. This project leverages fundamental physical principles to reliably and accurately classify drones. The process of identifying any drone using radar is quite complex, so achieving the capability to identify specific drones is a significant accomplishment of which we are very proud\".\n\nOmer Tzidki emphasizes that the combination of electromagnetic techniques, AI algorithms, and innovative radar technology yields optimal results. \"Mapping the airfield is critical for protecting the lives of soldiers and civilians. This project is important at all times and especially crucial now\", he said.\n\nA scientific breakthrough by researchers from Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) has demonstrated the potential for speech by a silent person using the power of thought only. In an experiment, a silent participant imagined saying one of two syllables. Depth electrodes implanted in his brain transmitted the electrical signals to a computer, which then vocalized the syllables.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Ariel Tankus of Tel Aviv University’s School of Medical and Health Sciences and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital), along with Dr. Ido Strauss of Tel Aviv University’s School of Medical and Health Sciences and director of the Functional Neurosurgery Unit at Ichilov Hospital. The results of this groundbreaking study were published in the prestigious journal Neurosurgery, the official publication of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. These findings offer hope for enabling people who are completely paralyzed — due to conditions such as ALS, brainstem stroke, or brain injury — to regain the ability to speak voluntarily.\n\nDr. Ariel Tankus of Tel Aviv University’s School of Medical and Health Sciences and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital).\n\nDr. Ido Strauss of Tel Aviv University’s School of Medical and Health Sciences and director of the Functional Neurosurgery Unit at Ichilov Hospital. Photo credit: Lior Zur, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital).\n\nHow Brain Implants Enable Silent Speech\n\n\"The patient in the study is an epilepsy patient who was hospitalized to undergo resection of the epileptic focus in his brain\", explains Dr. Tankus. \"to do this, of course, you need to locate the focal point, which is the source of the ‘short’ that sends powerful electrical waves through the brain. This situation pertains to a smaller subset of epilepsy patients who do not respond well to medication and require neurosurgical intervention, and an even smaller subset of epilepsy patients whose suspected focus is located deep within the brain, rather than on the surface of the cortex. To identify the exact location, electrodes have to be implanted into deep structures of their brains. They are then hospitalized, awaiting the next seizure. When a seizure occurs, the electrodes will tell the neurologists and neurosurgeons where the focus is, allowing them to operate precisely. From a scientific perspective, this provides a rare opportunity to get a glimpse into the depths of a living human brain. Fortunately, the epilepsy patient hospitalized at Ichilov agreed to participate in the experiment, which may ultimately help completely paralyzed individuals to express themselves again through artificial speech\".\n\nAn image from the experiment of the speech neuroprosthesis (a.k.a speech brain-computer interface). It shows the participant who is completely silent, with his mouth closed, imagining saying a syllable. The laptop \"says\" the syllable for him.\n\nIn the first stage of the experiment, with the depth electrodes already implanted in the patient’s brain, the Tel Aviv University researchers asked him to say two syllables out loud: /a/ and /e/. They recorded the brain activity as he articulated these sounds. Using deep learning and machine learning, the researchers trained artificial intelligence models to identify the specific brain cells whose electrical activity indicated the desire to say /a/ or /e/. Once the computer learned to recognize the pattern of electrical activity associated with these two syllables in the patient's brain, he was asked only to imagine that he was saying /a/ and /e/. The computer then translated the electrical signals and played the pre-recorded sounds of /a/ or /e/ accordingly.\n\nDecoding the Language of the Brain\n\n\"My field of research deals with the encoding and decoding of speech, that is, how individual brain cells participate in the speech process — the production of speech, the hearing of speech, and the imagination of speech, or ‘speaking silently\", says Dr. Tankus. \"In this experiment, for the first time in history, we were able to connect the parts of speech to the activity of individual cells from the regions of the brain from which we recorded. This allowed us to distinguish between the electrical signals that represent the sounds /a/ and /e/. At the moment, our research involves two building blocks of speech, two syllables. Of course, our ambition is to get to complete speech, but even two different syllables can enable a fully paralyzed person to signal ‘yes' and ‘no.’ For example, in the future, it will be possible to train a computer for an ALS patient in the early stages of the disease, while they can still speak. The computer would learn to recognize the electrical signals in the patient’s brain, enabling it to interpret these signals even after they lose the ability to move their muscles. And that is just one example. Our study is a significant step toward developing a brain-computer interface that can replace the brain's control pathways for speech production, allowing completely paralyzed individuals to communicate voluntarily with their surroundings once again\".\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from the Israel Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.\n\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University and Ichilov’s Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center led a multidisciplinary international study in which an innovative model based on machine learning was developed to accurately estimate step length. The new model can be integrated into a wearable device that is attached (with “skin tape”) to the lower back and enables continuous monitoring of steps in a patient’s everyday life. \"Step length is a sensitive measure of a wide range of problems and diseases, from cognitive decline and aging to Parkinson's. The conventional measuring devices that exist today are stationary and cumbersome and are only found in specialized clinics and laboratories. The model we developed enables accurate measurement in a patient's natural environment throughout the day, using a wearable sensor\", according to the researchers.\n\nThe study was led by Assaf Zadka, a graduate student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tel Aviv University; Prof. Jeffrey Hausdorff from the Department of Physical Therapy at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University, as well as from the Department of Neurology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC); and Prof. Neta Rabin from the Department of Industrial Engineering at the Fleischman Faculty of Engineering at Tel Aviv University. Also participating in the study were Eran Gazit from TASMC, Prof. Anat Mirelman from the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University and TASMC, as well as researchers from Belgium, England, Italy, Holland, and the USA. The research was supported by the Center for AI and Data Science of Tel Aviv University. An article describing the research was published in the journal Digital Medicine.\n\nA person walking in a state-of-the-art gait lab, with a wearable sensor positioned on his lower back. He is walking over a gait mat embedded with force-sensitive sensors. The gait mat provides highly accurate measures of the person's step length and is used to provide reference values for \"training\" and testing of the machine learning model described in this study. In the background, specialized motion capture cameras can also be seen. The gait mat and cameras very accurately measure a subject's walking pattern, over a few steps. However, these tools cannot be used in the real-world, everyday setting. In contrast, the wearable sensor is small, lightweight, and waterproof, can be held in place using skin tape, and can measure step length throughout the day, informing the evaluation of real-world walking and functional abilities.\n\nCan Our Steps Reveal Neurological Health?\n\nProf. Hausdorff, an expert in the fields of walking, aging, and neurology, explains: \"Step length is a very sensitive and non-invasive measure for evaluating a wide variety of conditions and diseases, including aging, deterioration as a result of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and more. Today it is common to measure step length using devices found in specialized laboratories and clinics, which are based on cameras and measuring devices like force-sensitive gait mats. While these tests are accurate, they provide only a snapshot view of a person’s walking that likely does not fully reflect real-world, actual functioning. Daily living walking may be influenced by a patient’s level of fatigue, mood, and medications, for example. Continuous, 24/7 monitoring like that enabled by this new model of step length can capture this real-world walking behavior\".\n\nSmart Sensors for Accurate Steps\n\nProf. Rabin, an expert in machine learning, adds: \"To solve the problem, we sought to harness IMU (inertial measurement unit) systems - light and relatively cheap sensors currently installed in every phone and smart-watch, and measure parameters associated with walking. Previous studies have examined IMU-based wearable devices to assess step length, but these experiments were only performed on healthy subjects without walking difficulties, were based on a small sample size that did not allow for generalization, and the devices themselves were not comfortable to wear and sometimes several sensors were needed. We sought to develop an efficient and convenient solution that would suit people with walking problems, such as the sick and the elderly, and would allow quantifying and collecting data on step length, throughout the day, in an environment familiar to the patient. The goal was to develop an algorithm that is capable of translating the IMU data into an accurate assessment of step length, which can be integrated into a wearable and comfortable device\".\n\nTo develop the algorithm, the researchers used IMU sensor-based gait data, in addition to step length data measured conventionally in a previous study, from 472 subjects with different conditions, such as Parkinson's, people with mild cognitive impairment, healthy elderly subjects, as well as younger, healthy adults and people with multiple sclerosis. An accurate and diverse database consisting of 83,569 steps was collected in this way. The researchers used this data and machine learning methods to train several computer models that translated the IMU data into an estimate of step length. To test the robustness of the models the researchers then determined to what extent the various models could accurately analyze new data that was not used in the training process – an ability known as generalization.\n\nNew Model Improves Step Length Precision\n\nAssaf Zadka: \"We found that the model called XGBoost is the most accurate, and is 3.5 times more accurate than the most advanced biomechanical model currently used to estimate step length. For a single step, the average error of our model was 6 cm - compared to 21 cm predicted by the conventional model. When we evaluated an average of 10 steps, we arrived at an error of less than 5 cm - a threshold known in the professional literature as 'the minimum difference that has clinical importance', which allows identifying a significant improvement or decrease in the subject's condition. In other words, our model is robust and reliable, and can be used to analyze sensor data from subjects, some with walking difficulties, who were not included in the original training set\".\n\nProf. Hausdorff concludes: \"In our research, we collaborated with researchers in diverse fields around the world, and the multi-disciplinary effort led to promising results. We developed a machine learning model that can be integrated with a wearable and easy-to-use sensor, which gives an accurate estimate of the patient's step length during daily life. The data collected in this way enables continuous, remote, and long-term monitoring of a patient’s condition, and can also be used in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of medications. Based on our encouraging results, we are looking into whether it is possible to develop similar models based on data from sensors in smart-watches, which would further improve the comfort of the subject\"."
