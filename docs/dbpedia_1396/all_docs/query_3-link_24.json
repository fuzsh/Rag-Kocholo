        "text": "Proportions of the Body\n\nTotal height of the body - 7 1/2 times the head or seven and half times unit\n\nPraxiteles’s law - body is equal to 8 head (Units)\n\nwidth of the body = 2 heads / units\n\nUmbilicus - present int he 4th head / unit\n\nUnit 4 also marks position of the elbow and height of the waist\n\nHand length = face length\n\nKnee is located in the 6th unit /head or junction of the 6th / 7th Unit\n\nWeight is to be distributed evenly or equally - keep the line of the neck, the hips and the feet aligned\n\nFemale body - Narrow shoulders and wider hips\n\nChildren -\n\nNew born - height is 3 times head - middle of the body at navel\n\n1 year - height 3 1/2 times head\n\n4 years - heigh 5 times head\n\n12 years - height 7 times head - middle of the body above pubic area\n\nIn elderly - make nose and ears big as they are the only two parts of the body that do not stop growing even after the adulthood.\n\n2 1/3 heads is the width of the male body\n\nspace between the nipples is one head\n\nwrist drops just below the crotch\n\nElbows at the level of the navel\n\nKnees just above the one fourth of the body line\n\nShoulders - one sixth of the body line from the top\n\nScale\n\nScale is the mathematical relationship that exists between the actual dimensions of your model and those of your sculpture / painting / drawing, which represents it.\n\nThe scale is defined by two numbers that determine a ratio between the drawing and reality.\n\nThe first number (numerator) of the proportion refers to the drawing.\n\nThe second number (denominator) of the proportion refers to reality.\n\nSCALE = DRAWING / REALITY; that is, if my scale is E = 1/4, we will interpret that one centimeter of my figure is equivalent to four centimeters of reality.\n\nTYPES OF SCALES\n\nScale is a graphical method that allows us to draw any object larger or smaller than it really is.\n\nThere are the following types of scale:\n\nReduction scale: The drawing / sculpture is smaller than reality. It will be necessary when we want to draw or design large objects, such as roads, buildings, stadiums, ships, etc. Can you imagine working with a map the size of a shopping center? On reduction scales, the first number is less than the second . Therefore, the scales will take the following possible forms: 1: 2, 1: 3, 2: 3, 1:10, 1: 200, etc.\n\nScales of enlargement: The drawing / sculpture is bigger than reality. We will use them when the object is so small that we need to see it larger in order to understand it. For example, it is used in the design of watches, electronic devices, mechanisms, etc. On magnification scales, the first number is greater than the second. They will look like this: 2: 1, 5: 1, 4: 3, 10: 3.\n\nReal scales: It is represented as 1: 1, that is, our model measures exactly what is represented.\n\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLE\n\nImagine that you want to paint a 60cm human figure on canvas, at what scale would your sculpture be?\n\nThe first thing is to know how much a human actually measures and the \"ideal standard\" measurement for a human is 180cm , this is very important, you always have to know the actual measurement of the figure you are modeling in order to calculate the scale.\n\nNow you just have to divide the real measurement by the measurement of your sculpture, which is 60cm 180/60\n\n= 3 So you can say that your sculpture would be at 1: 3 scale\n\nExamples of scales in the human figure that are usually used (ideal standard of 180 cm):\n\nScale 1: 1 = 180cm: 1 = 180cm, your painting would be life size.\n\nScale 1: 2 = 180cm: 2 = 90cm\n\nScale 1: 3 = 180cm: 3 = 60cm\n\nScale 1: 5 = 180cm: 5 = 36cm\n\nScale 1: 6 = 180cm: 6 = 30cm\n\nWell now it's time to calculate all the averages of your canvas of 60 cm or 1: 3 scale and for that we have the canon of 8 heads, essential to work the human figure.\n\nThe first and main point is to know the head size for your 60cm painting figure\n\nNow, let's go step by step:\n\n1º Calculate head size: 60cm: 8 = 7.5 cm\n\n2º The shoulders measure 2 heads: 7.5 cm x 2 = 15 cm\n\n3º The hips measure 1 and ½ heads: 7.5mx 1.5 = 11.25cm\n\n4º The legs measure and feet measure 4 and ½ heads: 7.5cm x 4.5 = 33.75cm\n\n5th Arms measure and hands measure 3 heads: 7.5cm x 3 = 22.5cm\n\nProportions of Head\n\nRatio of the head to the the width - is approximately two thirds\n\nWidth of the nose is equal to the length of the eye\n\nWidth of the head is equal to 5 eyes or eyes are placed after dividing the head width into five parts - middle part is left blank then eyes placed on either side\n\nLength of the lower lip is shorter than upper lip though the thickness of the lower lip is 2/3rd and upper lip is 1/3rd\n\nContour of the upper lip is called cupids bow because of the resemble to the cupid\n\nEars are located between the lines of the eyebrows and the base of the nose\n\nWidth of the neck is one half of the the height of the head\n\nA virtual line divides the face into two halves called central axis of the face\n\nThis line is divided in half (middle) - there is horizontal axis of the eyes.\n\nHuman head equals - 3 1/2 times the length of forehead or 3 1/2 units\n\nTop of the head - Natural headline\n\nStarting point of the drawing of the face is the tilt line in the vertical axis\n\nHead = 3 unit wide or 3 fore heads\n\nDistance between the eyes is equal to the width of the one eye\n\nLips at the line dividing middle of the third part horizontally\n\nUpper line - hair line\n\nSecond line - eyes\n\nThird line - Nose\n\nLast line - chin\n\nThe mouth is located in the center of the center of the last segment (middle of the third part horizontally)\n\nHand\n\nDistance between the wrist and the knuckles = Knuckles and the tip of the middle finger\n\nIndex finger is equal to the ring finger\n\nLittle finger is equal to the final joint of the index finger\n\nLength of hand = length of the face\n\nPelvis & Hips\n\nLines formed by the shoulder and the hips - horizontally gives the tilt of the body\n\nThe tilt of the both of these lines marks the equilibrium of the pose."
