Among the tau-specific tracers, the application of 11C-pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 (11C-PBB3) in PET shows high sensitivity to Alzheimer disease (AD)-related tau deposition. The current study investigates the regional tau load in patients within the AD continuum, biomarker-negative individuals (BN) and patients with suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) using 11C-PBB3-PET.   Materials and methods A total of 23 memory clinic outpatients with recent decline of episodic memory were examined using 11C-PBB3-PET. Pittsburg compound B (11C-PIB) PET was available for 17, 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET for 16, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels for 11 patients. CSF biomarkers were considered abnormal based on Aβ42 (< 600 ng/L) and t-tau (> 450 ng/L). The PET biomarkers were classified as positive or negative using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis and visual assessment. Using the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) scheme, patients were grouped as within the AD continuum, SNAP, and BN based on amyloid and neurodegeneration status. The 11C-PBB3 load detected by PET was compared among the groups using both atlas-based and voxel-wise analyses.   Results Seven patients were identified as within the AD continuum, 10 SNAP and 6 BN. In voxel-wise analysis, significantly higher 11C-PBB3 binding was observed in the AD continuum group compared to the BN patients in the cingulate gyrus, tempo-parieto-occipital junction and frontal lobe. Compared to the SNAP group, patients within the AD continuum had a considerably increased 11C-PBB3 uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant difference between SNAP and BN groups. The atlas-based analysis supported the outcome of the voxel-wise quantification analysis.   Conclusion Our results suggest that 11C-PBB3-PET can effectively analyze regional tau load and has the potential to differentiate patients in the AD continuum group from the BN and SNAP group.",

        "text": "1 Introduction\n\nIn 2018, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) has updated the definition of AD by focusing on biomarkers associated with the pathological processes of Alzheimer’s and excluding the clinical symptoms as diagnostic criteria [1]. The biomarkers that are closely correlated with the hallmarks of AD are amyloid-beta (Aß) and tau. However, the role of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline is also undeniable. The NIA-AA framework therefore suggests the A/T/N biomarker classification scheme in AD and brain aging research, where “A” refers to biomarkers of Aß, “T” stands for biomarkers of tau pathology, and “N” refers to biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury [2].\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the importance of Aß biomarkers [3–6] as well as the combination of Aß and neurodegeneration biomarkers in the pathogenesis of AD [7–9]. More recently due to the introduction of PET ligands for pathologic tau, the investigation of the role of tau pathology has also attracted considerable interest. In terms of regional distributions, Aβ is spread diffusely throughout the neocortex, while tau spreads more selectively across the temporal lobe, association cortices, and finally primary sensorimotor cortices, as summarized in the Braak stage scheme of progressive tau pathology [10, 11]. This progression of tau is closely associated with disease stage and cognitive performance [11].\n\nSeveral PET-tracers have been developed over the past few years to target tau [12–15]. Among them, the highly affine and specific 11C-PBB3 may have the potential to be used in visualizing intracellular tau aggregates [16, 17]. However, little is yet known regarding the diagnostic value of 11C-PBB3-PET in a routine setting and on an individual patient level.\n\nClinical studies using a limited number of patients indicated sensitive detection of tau pathology by 11C-PBB3 in patients with AD, with evidence of association between 11C-PBB3 uptake and disease progression [18, 19]. The 11C-PBB3 distribution among cognitively normal and AD groups could mirror the pathological staging [20]. It was reported that in contrast to a relatively low 11C-PIB uptake in the hippocampus as a cortical association area in AD, 11C-PBB3 provided a robust signal in this region [18]. A head-to-head comparison of different tau tracers demonstrated that 11C-PBB3 is more sensitive to tau aggregations that are correlated with amyloid-beta deposits [21]. Moreover, for 11C-PBB3 binding to tau aggregates without evidence for positive amyloid-beta detection has been demonstrated [18, 22].\n\nIn this preliminary study, we aim to apply the A/T/N biomarker classification scheme to a population of neurological patients and compare the regional tau deposition by 11C-PBB3-PET imaging between patients within the AD continuum, BN individuals and patients with SNAP.\n\n4 Discussion\n\nTo date, the results of only few clinical trials with 11C-PBB3 tau tracer are available [18, 19, 22, 40]. Therefore, this is an area where more research is needed to validate the diagnostic value of 11C-PBB3-PET. In this study, the tau deposition using 11C-PBB3-PET in the AD continuum, SNAP and BN patients was assessed. The quantitative analyses showed a higher global SUVR and SUVR in several cortical regions in patients within the AD continuum than in BN patients. Furthermore, the SUVR in the posterior cingulate was significantly higher in the AD continuum patients than in SNAP patients. The results indicate that 11C-PBB3-PET is indeed a noninvasive biomarker for tau deposition.\n\nThe main strength of this study is to provide semi-automated techniques to analyse the PET data. The PET-based quantitative method was used to quantify tau-PET scans [26]. For amyloid-PET quantification, the adaptive template method was utilized due to the different activity distribution patterns in amyloid-positive and -negative patients [23]. The optimized single-subject SPM approach was used to support the visual inspection of 18F-FDG-PET images [30]. Visual assessment of PET scans is commonly used in many nuclear medicine facilities. However, the automated and semi-automated quantitative methods can significantly improve the detection and comparative assessment. Furthermore, the non-specific binding of radiotracers makes the detection of cerebral cortical binding challenging for the human eye. This process could be even more difficult for 11C-PBB3-PET images due to the lower specific binding of the 11C-PBB3 compared to other tau tracers [41]. Nevertheless, since the automated analysis of 18F-FDG-PET is still a matter of debate [42], the visual assessment of 18F-FDG-PET images was considered as the preferred method in this study.\n\nComparing the regional 11C-PBB3-SUVR values between patients within the AD continuum and BN, higher SUVRs were noted over the cingulate gyrus, temporo-parieto-occipital junction and frontal regions, which were similar to previous studies. Maruyama et al. reported that in the patients with AD, 11C-PBB3 accumulation was most frequently observed in the limbic system and gradually spread into the temporal, parietal and frontal regions that correspond to Braak stages V-VI [18]. However, this study has included only a small number of patients (3 AD vs. 3 cognitively normal individuals). Kimura et al. evaluated the feasibility of kinetic model-based approaches to quantify tau binding using 11C-PBB3-PET and blood data [40]. They found that the reference tissue and the dual-input model binding parameters discriminate effectively normal controls from patients with AD. Terada investigated the uptake of 11C-PBB3 in participants with early AD [43]. He reported notable differences in tracer uptake in the temporo-parietal junction of AD patients compared to healthy controls. In our study, all BN participants were classified as Braak stage I/II, which will be explained below in more detail. Patients within AD continuum showed elevated tracer retention in regions corresponding to Braak stage III/IV. Although the patients in this study are mostly in the mild to moderate dementia category, the gradual spread of 11C-PBB3 accumulation is clearly observed in the parietal and frontal lobes (Braak stage V/VI). Our results therefore add further evidence supporting the hypothesis that the 11C-PBB3 tau ligand is able to discriminate cognitively normal patients from those within the AD continuum.\n\nPatients within the AD continuum had a higher cortical 11C-PBB3-SUVR than SNAP patients in various brain regions (Table 3). However, due to the small sample size and large standard deviation of the regional SUVR values in the SNAP group, no significant differences were found between two groups, except for the posterior cingulate area (Figs 3 and 4). The wide IQR of regional SUVRs in the SNAP patients can be explained by the heterogeneity of the dementia subtypes in this group. Moreover, different dementia subtypes have been associated with different pathological hallmarks, often showing AD co-pathology. Several studies have reported that the non-AD patients with AD co-pathology are more likely to be classified as AD [44–46]. This may explain the overlap of SNAP and AD continuum group in the current work.\n\nThe SNAP group was generally intermediate with regard to the distribution of 11C-PBB3 uptake relative to the BN and AD continuum group. On an individual basis, two of ten SNAP patients (CBD [n = 1] and semantic PPA [n = 1]) showed high 11C-PBB3 uptake in cortical regions that was compatible to AD patient uptakes. The other SNAP subjects had 11C-PBB3-SUVR values in the same range as BN patients. Both voxel-wise and atlas-based analyses revealed no significant difference between the SNAP and the BN patient groups (Fig 4).\n\nAlthough, there was an increasing tendency of 11C-PBB3 uptake in the AD continuum group compared to the BN group in the medial temporal lobe, no significant differences for the 11C-PBB3-SUVR values were found among the three patient groups (Fig 4A). This finding is compatible with previous studies demonstrating that neurofibrillary tangles around the medial temporal cortex are indistinguishable from those of AD in normal cognitive or SNAP elderly patients [11, 19]. Recently, the new term \"primary age-related tauopathy\" (PART) has been proposed for such a pathological condition [47].\n\nBoth, atlas-based analysis and voxel-wise analysis were performed in this study. Taking the small sample sizes into account, the use of two methods led to more reliable results. The atlas-based approach was also investigated by a previous 11C-PBB3-PET study [19]. In this method, the VOI’s signal is typically computed by averaging over all voxel signals in a given VOI. However, the sub-region of the brain, showing statistically significant signals, does not necessarily include the whole voxels within the predefined VOIs. This average over all voxels can thus affect the effect sizes. Conversely, the voxel-wise analysis enables to detect significant signals anywhere between distinct VOIs in the whole brain. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, observed effect sizes based on the atlas-based approach are smaller than those of the voxel-wise method. Despite this observation, the voxel-wise quantitative analysis of 11C-PBB3-PET images supported the outcome of the atlas-based analysis.\n\nAlthough A/T/N biomarker classification scheme originally emerged as a research framework, applying A/T/N to our cohort of patients revealed a good but partial correspondence to the clinical diagnosis. Clinically AD-diagnosed patients (n = 3) and logopenic PPA (n = 3), which is typically associated with AD pathology, were in the AD continuum. Among SNAP patients, 3 out of 16 were identified as BN.\n\nThe main limitation of the current study is the lack of cognitively normal individuals. In addition, four spatiotemporal subtypes of tau pathology spread in AD has been recently proposed: limbic-predominant phenotype, parietal-dominant and medial temporal lobe (MTL)-sparing phenotype, predominant posterior occipitotemporal phenotype and asymmetric temporoparietal phenotype [48]. Both, the heterogeneity in AD and lack of cognitively normal individuals could underestimate between-group differences (AD vs. BN and AD vs. SNAP), leading to false-negative results. However, they would not hamper the positive results presented in this study. In group classification, the use of CSF data in the absence of PET images may also be a limitation. Discordance between imaging and CSF biomarkers can cause different positive/negative labels for the same patient. In some situations, discordance in positive/negative labels between an imaging and CSF biomarker is simply due to the borderline cases or non-optimal cutoff values. Excluding patients with a CSF value within ±10% of the cutoff value could reduce this limitation. In this study, there were no patients with CSF values within ±10% of the cut-off values. This supports the validity of combining PET and CSF data for amyloid and neurodegenerative biomarker groups. Moreover, the cutoff-calculation approach for amyloid positivity was data dependent and a larger sample size covering a wide spectrum of cases is needed to yield a more accurate result. However, the LOOCV indicated the stability of the calculated cutoff value in this dataset."
