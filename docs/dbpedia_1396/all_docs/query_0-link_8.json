        "text": "Rheology is used to describe and assess the deformation and flow behavior of materials. Fluids flow at different speeds and solids can be deformed to a certain extent. Oil, honey, shampoo, hand cream, toothpaste, sweet jelly, plastic materials, wood, and metals – depending on their physical behavior, they can be put in an order: On the one side liquids, on the other side solids, and in between highly viscous, semi-solid substances.\n\nOn this page, the fundamental principles – the basics of rheology – are presented and explained. It is dedicated to giving an introduction to rheology, provides information about measuring geometries and rotational as well as oscillatory tests, and also contains definitions of the most important terms, such as shear stress, shear rate, or shear deformation. You will also find everything there is to know about flow and viscosity curves and examples of calculations and test types.\n\nRheology is a branch of physics. Rheologists describe the deformation and flow behavior of all kinds of material. The term originates from the Greek word “rhei” meaning “to flow” (Figure 1.1: Bottle from the 19th century bearing the inscription “Tinct(ur) Rhei Vin(um) Darel”. Exhibited in the German Apotheken-Museum [Drugstore Museum], Heidelberg. The term “rhei” indicates that the content of the bottle is liquid.). Rheometry is the measuring technology used to determine rheological properties.\n\nWhat is viscosity?\n\nAll liquids are composed of molecules; dispersions also contain some significantly larger particles. When put into motion, molecules and particles are forced to slide along each other. They develop a flow resistance caused by internal friction.\n\nLarger components present in a fluid are the reason for higher viscosity values.\n\nWhy do different substances have different viscosities?\n\nMolecules in fluids come in different sizes: solvent molecules approx. 0.5 nm, polymers approx. 50 nm (coiled ball diameter at rest), and mineral particles approx. 5 µm = 5000 nm. One nanometer (1 nm) equals 10-9 m; one micrometer (1 µm) is equal to 10-6 m. This means that the size ratio between molecules and particles is in the range from 1:100 to 1:10,000 (Figure 1.2). The ratio of 1:1000 can be illustrated with the following figure: The molecules are fish, each of them 10 cm (0.1 m) long, whereas the particles are ships with a length of 100 m (Figure 1.3).\n\nModern rheometers can be used for shear tests and torsional tests. They operate with continuous rotation and rotational oscillation (Figure 2.1). Specific measuring systems can be used to carry out uniaxial tensile tests either in one direction of motion or as oscillatory tests.\n\nWith a viscometer, only the viscosity values of a sample can be determined. This can be done by performing rotational tests, mostly speed-controlled, or by using other methods of testing. The results are presented as flow curves or viscosity curves . Find many methods and approaches to measure viscosity in the related Wiki article . Rheometers are able to determine many more rheological parameters.\n\nSimple methods for measuring viscosity include so-called relative measuring systems. The results obtained are always dependent on the used device and cannot be compared with each other (e.g. flow cups [a,b,c] or falling/rolling ball viscometers[d,e] ).\n\nAbsolute values, for example viscosity, can only be determined with absolute measuring systems. In contrast to relative values, absolute values do not correlate with the size of the measuring system. They have a relatively narrow shear gap as defined by specific standards for measuring systems such as ISO 3219[f] and DIN 53019[g]. These standards describe the following measuring geometries (Figure 2.2 and 2.3): cone-plate, concentric cylinders and plate-plate.\n\nRotational tests (Figure 3.1) with a rheometer can be carried out in one of two operation modes, which differ in their preset parameters (Tables 2 and 3). The first way is to present the velocity via rotational speed or shear rate (controlled shear rate, CSR or CR). This simulates processes that are dependent on flow velocity or volume flow rate, such as application of coatings with a brush, or of paints by spraying or flow through a tube (Figure 3.2). The second way is to preset the driving force via torque or shear stress (controlled shear stress, CSS or CS). These tests simulate force-dependent applications, such as the force required to start pumping a material at rest, to squeeze sealing materials out of a cartridge, or paste out of a tube. Conversion of torque into the shear stress and rotational speed into the shear rate, and vice versa, is possible via conversion factors.\n\nFor calculating the viscosity, the type of operation mode is irrelevant because the parameters shear stress and shear rate are both available, either as a preset value or as a result of the test.\n\nCSR and CSS preset profiles for flow curves (Figure 3.3):\n\nPreset rotational speed or shear-rate ramp, usually ascending or descending in steps\n\nPreset torque or shear-stress ramp, usually ascending or descending in steps\n\nFor shear rates above 1 s-1, a typical setting recommended for both modes is a duration of at least one to two seconds, which is to be maintained for each measuring point because the sample needs a certain time to adapt itself to each shear step.\n\nAnother type of viscosity is the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ (pronounced: nu).\n\nDefinition: $\\nu$ = $\\eta$ / $\\rho$ with shear viscosity η (in Pas) and density ρ (in kg/m3). The unit for kinematic viscosity is m2/s = 106 mm2/s. For calculations, please note: The units for density are kg/m3 and g/cm3, where 1000 kg/m3 = 1 g/cm3.\n\nThe unit for shear viscosity is 1 Pas = 1000 mPas (pascal seconds, milli-pascal-seconds). Other units include 1 kPas = 1,000 Pas (kilo-Pas), 1 MPas = 1,000,000 Pas (mega-Pas). A previously used unit was 1 cP = 1 mPas (centipoise, best pronounced in French), but cP is not an SI unit and should not be used any longer.\n\nKinematic viscosity is always determined if gravitational force or the weight of the sample is the driving force. This applies, for example, to tests with flow cups, falling-ball and capillary viscometers. A previously used unit for the kinematic viscosity was 1 cSt = mm2/s (centistokes), but cSt is not an SI unit and should not be used any longer.\n\nThe SI system is the international system of units (French: système international d’unités)[2] .\n\nShear-thinning behavior (or: pseudoplastic flow behavior) is characterized by decreasing viscosity with increasing shear rates (Figure 5.2, line 2). Typical materials that show this behavior are coatings, glues, shampoos, polymer solutions and polymer melts. Since viscosity is shear-dependent, it should always be given with the shear condition. Example: η1(${\\dot \\gamma}_1$) = 0.5 Pas (at 10 s-1) and η2(${\\dot \\gamma}_2$) = 0.1 Pas (at 100 s-1). Shear-thinning behavior is related to the internal structures of samples .\n\nShear-thickening (or: dilatant flow behavior) means increasing viscosity with increasing shear rates (Figure 5.2, line 3). Materials that typically display such behavior include highly filled dispersions, such as ceramic suspensions (casting slurries), starch dispersions, plastisol pastes that lack a sufficient amount of plasticizer, dental filling masses (dental composites) as well as special composite materials for protective clothing.\n\nFor evaluating behavior in the low shear-rate range, it is beneficial to use a log-log plot for the diagrams of flow curves and viscosity curves . The advantage of diagrams on a logarithmic scale is that a very large range of values (several orders of magnitude) can be illustrated clearly in one diagram. Often the biggest changes in viscosity just take place within the range of low shear rates, which is below $\\dot \\gamma$ = 1 s-1. With a presentation on a linear scale, however, this range can only be depicted to a limited extent.\n\nThe yield point is the lowest shear-stress value above which a material will behave like a fluid, and below which the material will act like a – sometimes very soft – solid matter (according to prEN ISO 3219-1). The yield point or yield stress is the minimum force that must be exceeded in order to break down a sample’s structure at rest, and thus make it flow.\n\nA sample’s superstructure can be imagined as being a stable, three-dimensional, consistent, physico-chemical network of forces interacting between the individual components of the sample; for example, between the particles of a rheology additive in a dispersion (Figure 6.1). Click here for more details and procedures on yield point evaluation.\n\nFor evaluating time-dependent flow behavior, shearing is kept constant. For test programs with several intervals, this applies to each individual interval. To investigate time-dependent behavior, it is recommended that a step test is carried out, in this case as a rotational test with three intervals.This measurement is usually performed as a time-dependent controlled-shear-rate test:\n\nInterval (1) Very low shear to simulate behavior at rest at a preset low shear rate\n\nInterval (2) Strong shear to simulate structural breakdown of the sample during processing at a preset high shear rate, for example when applying paint with a brush or by spraying\n\nInterval (3) Very low shear to simulate structural regeneration at rest after application using the same preset low shear rate as in the first interval.\n\nThe phase shift δ, which is the time lag between the preset and the resulting sinusoidal oscillation is determined for each measuring point. This angle, always between 0° and 90°, is now placed below the G* vector (Figure 9.9).\n\nThe x-axis is spanned from the other end of the angle to the right and the y-axis is drawn upwards perpendicular to the x-axis. The part of the G* value that runs along the x-axis is the elastic portion of the viscoelastic behavior presented as G' while the part of the G* vector that is projected onto the y-axis is the viscous portion G''. This means that the complete vector diagram is a presentation of G* and δ, as well as of G' and G'' (Figure 9.10).\n\nThe storage modulus G' (G prime, in Pa) represents the elastic portion of the viscoelastic behavior, which quasi describes the solid-state behavior of the sample. The loss modulus G'' (G double prime, in Pa) characterizes the viscous portion of the viscoelastic behavior, which can be seen as the liquid-state behavior of the sample.\n\nViscous behavior arises from the internal friction between the components in a flowing fluid, thus between molecules and particles. This friction always goes along with the development of frictional heat in the sample, and consequently, with the transformation of deformation energy into heat energy. This part of the energy is absorbed by the sample; it is used up by internal friction processes and is no longer available for the further behavior of the sample material. This loss of energy is also called energy dissipation.\n\nIn contrast, the elastic portion of energy is stored in the deformed material; i.e. by extending and stretching the internal superstructures without overstressing the interactions and without overstretching or destroying the material.\n\nWhen the material is later released, this unused stored energy acts like a driving force for reforming the structure into its original shape.\n\nStorage modulus G' represents the stored deformation energy and loss modulus G'' characterizes the deformation energy lost (dissipated) through internal friction when flowing. Viscoelastic solids with G' > G'' have a higher storage modulus than loss modulus. This is due to links inside the material, for example chemical bonds or physical-chemical interactions (Figure 9.11).\n\nOn the other hand, viscoelastic liquids with G'' > G' have a higher loss modulus than storage modulus. The reason for this is that, in most of these materials, there are no such strong bonds between the individual molecules (Figure 9.12).\n\n(tangent delta), unit: dimensionless or 1. This factor describes the ratio of the two portions of the viscoelastic behavior. The following applies (see also the vector diagram in Figure 9.10):\n\nFor ideally elastic behavior δ = 0°. There is no viscous portion. Therefore, G'' = 0 and with that tan δ = G''/ G' = 0.\n\nFor ideally viscous behavior δ = 90°. There is no elastic portion. Therefore, G' = 0 and thus the value of tan δ = G''/ G' approaches infinity because of the attempt to divide by zero.\n\nIn some diagrams, the loss factor tan δ is plotted in addition to the curves of G' and G'', in particular if there is a phase transition in the sample. This is also called the sol/gel transition point or simply the gel point. It means that the character of the sample has changed during the measurement from the liquid or sol state to the solid or gel state and vice versa. Usually, for practical applications, a liquid is called ideally viscous if tan δ > 100:1 = 100, while a solid material is called ideally elastic if tan δ < 1:100 = 0.01\n\nAmplitude sweeps generally aim at describing the deformation behavior of samples in the non-destructive deformation range and at determining the upper limit of this range (Figure 9.14). Often, it is also interesting to characterize behavior that occurs if this upper limit is exceeded with increasing deformation, when the inner structure gets softer, starts to flow, or breaks down in a brittle way.\n\nFrequency sweeps generally serve the purpose of describing the time-dependent behavior of a sample in the non-destructive deformation range. High frequencies are used to simulate fast motion on short timescales, whereas low frequencies simulate slow motion on long timescales or at rest. In frequency sweeps (Figure 9.15), the oscillation frequency is increased or decreased step-wise from one measuring point to the next while keeping the amplitude constant."
