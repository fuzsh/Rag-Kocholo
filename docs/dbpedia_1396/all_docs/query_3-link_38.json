        "text": "The first example (top left) I use for life-size or � life-size portraits done in water base clay. The base is a 12\"x12\"x �\" board coated with polyurethane for waterproofing. An exterior paint will work as well. The part holding the pipe vertical is called a pipe flange, which is held in place with four wood screws. The pipe is a �\" NPT (National Pipe Thread) that's 12\" long with a collar attached at the top. The height is adjusted by exchanging the pipe with a shorter or longer one, as they come in a variety of lengths. The 2 loops on top are aluminum wire with about 2\" of excess extending into the pipe. The size as pictured works well for an adult with plenty of room for shoulders and chest if desired. The wider the shoulders, the more support is needed from the base up (bottom left)."
