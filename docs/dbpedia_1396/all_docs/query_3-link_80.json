Use this tip to calculate the size of artwork you need to create a professional look in any room.\n\nFill 60 - 75% of the visual space\n\nCarve out a visual space where you want to hang your picture. For example, let’s say you want to hang art above a dominant piece of furniture to create a focal point for a room. Create a balanced look by filling about 60 - 75% of the empty space above the furniture with your art piece or arrangement.\n\nHow to calculate the size of art needed\n\nHere is an easy way to follow the 60-75% rule and calculate the size of art you need for a space. Measure the area you want to fill, and multiply the length and height of this space by 0.7. This will give you a guideline for the height and length dimensions for a single picture for the space or the size of the footprint to fill with multiple items arranged together.\n\nHang the right size art for the space\n\nIn these images you’ll see how we used this general rule to select the right size of wall décor in a variety of decorating situations to create inviting spaces. Use this 60-75% rule to create a professional look in any room of your home.\n\nWant more decorating inspiration?\n\nDecorating your space can be loads of fun, and by following a few simple guidelines it can be easy to create a space that really looks professional.
