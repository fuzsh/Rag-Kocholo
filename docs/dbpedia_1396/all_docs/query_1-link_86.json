        "text": "ANTIBODIES TO TAU\n\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\n[0001 ] This invention was made with government support under\n\n1 R01 NS071835 awarded by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0002] This invention relates to antibodies to tau and methods of use thereof.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0003] Aggregation of the microtubule associated protein tau is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia. In AD, pathological tau aggregation spreads progressively throughout the brain, possibly along existing neural networks. AD is the most common cause of dementia and is an increasing public health problem. It is currently estimated to afflict 5 million people in the United States, with an expected increase to 13 million by the year 2050. Alzheimer's Disease leads to loss of memory, cognitive function, and ultimately loss of independence. It takes a heavy personal and financial toll on the patient and the family. Because of the severity and increasing prevalence of the AD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aggregation of tau in the population, it is urgent that better treatments and detection methods be developed.\n\nREFERENCE TO COLOR FIGURES\n\n[0004] The application file contains at least one photograph executed in color. Copies of this patent application publication with color photographs will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n[0005] FIG. 1 depicts the amino acid sequence for N-terminal (A) and C- terminal (B) human tau (htau).\n\n[0006] FIG. 2 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.1 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0007] FIG. 3 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.2 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0008] FIG. 4 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.3 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0009] FIG. 5 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.4 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0010] FIG. 6 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.5 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[001 1 ] FIG. 7 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.7 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0012] FIG. 8 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ8.8 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0013] FIG. 9 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ9.1 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0014] FIG. 10 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ9.2 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0015] FIG. 11 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ9.3 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0016] FIG. 12 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ9.4 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0017] FIG. 13 depicts graphs showing the KD for HJ9.5 towards Human Tau (A) and Mouse Tau (B).\n\n[0018] FIG. 14 depicts immunoblots showing the presence of full-length tau in ISF of wild-type and P301 S tg mice. (A) Hippocampal lysates from Tau KO (KO), wild-type (WT), and P301 S tg (P301 S tg) mice were analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-tau antibody BT-2 or anti-actin antibody. Thirteen micrograms of protein were loaded per well. Four bands corresponding to endogenous murine tau and one band corresponding to human tau are indicated as white circles and a black circle,\n\nrespectively. There is also a 39 kDa band representing a form of human tau in the P301 S tg hippocampal lysate. This may represent a tau degradation product. ISF tau from wild-type (WT) and P301 S tg (P301 S tg) mice was immunoprecipitated by anti-tau monoclonal antibodies HJ9.3 (B) or HJ8.1 (C) and analyzed by immunoblot. The bands were visualized by biotinylated BT-2 antibody. The gray and black arrows indicate endogenous murine tau and human tau, respectively.\n\n[0019] FIG. 15 (A) illustrates a schematic representation of the different mutant tau constructs used in this study, and (B-D) depict images showing Tau RD proteins form fibrillar aggregates in transfected HEK293 cells. (A) Depending on the experimental design, each form of mutant tau was either fused at the carboxyl terminus to cyan or yellow fluorescent protein (CFP or YFP), or to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag. (B) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) performed on SDS-insoluble material from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the various forms of RD reveals that RD(AK)-HA and RD(LM)-HA produced obvious fibrillar species. No fibrils were detected in the\n\naggregation-resistant RD(PP)-HA. (n=2), Scale bars, 1 Î¼Î¹ÏÎ¹. (C) HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the various forms of RD-YFP and YFP alone were stained with X-34, an amyloid-specific dye. Inclusions formed by RD(wt)-YFP, RD(AK)-YFP and RD(LM)- YFP, visualized by confocal microscopy, also stained positive for X-34. No X-34 positive cells were detected upon expression of YFP alone or RD(PP)- YFP. Arrows indicate inclusions stained with X-34. (n=3) (D) Non-Transfected cells (NT) and various forms of RD-YFP/CFP were transfected into HEK293 cells, followed by Triton/SDS extraction and Western blotting using an antibody against the RD region. Both monomer and higher order molecular weight species were detected. (S= Soluble protein and P= Pellet insoluble protein). This was repeated three times with identical results.\n\n[0020] FIG. 16 shows Tau RD aggregates in HEK293 cells are detected by FRET. To quantitate intracellular RD protein aggregation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), various RD mutants (wt, ÎÎ, PP, LM) fused to YFP and CFP were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. (A). HEK293 cells co-transfected with RD(LM)- CFP/YFP were imaged and intracellular aggregate formation was quantified using FRET acceptor photobleaching microscopy. Donor signal before (Pre) and after (Post) acceptor photobleaching confirmed that RD(LM)-CFP/ YFP inclusions produced a mean FRET efficiency of 18.2%Â± 0.058 SD (n=6). The upper and lower panels depict the acceptor and donor channels, respectively, before and after photobleaching. The top right image is a representative heat map of the calculated FRET efficiency. The scale bar of the histogram depicts the calculated FRET efficiency on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The FRET efficiency of Tau RD aggregate was -34% in this cell. (B). Using a FPR, relative FRET from various constructs was determined. No significant FRET from\n\nRD(PP)-CFP/YFP was observed. However, RD(AK)-CFP/YFP and RD(LM)-CFP/YFP each produced a strong FRET signal (n=3). (C). HEK293 cells expressing RD(AK)- CFP/YFP were exposed to various concentrations of RD(wt)-HA fibrils (monomer equivalents of 0.01 , 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 Î¼Î) for 9 h. Extracellular RD(wt)-HA fibrils dose- dependently induced aggregation of RD(AK)-CFP/YFP (n=3). (* indicates a p-value <0.05, ** indicates a p-value <0.001 , error bars represent the SEM).\n\n[0021 ] FIG. 17 depicts images and graphs showing Tau-RD aggregates transfer between cells and induce further aggregation. (A). HEK293 cells transfected with RD(AK)-YFP were co-cultured for 48 h with an equivalent number of cells expressing RD(LM)-HA. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and\n\nimmunofluorescence/X-34 staining was performed. Multiple cells showed colocalization of RD(LM)-HA and RD(AK)-YFP within inclusions. These inclusions also stained positive for X-34, indicating beta sheet structure (solid arrows). In addition, some\n\nRD(LM)-HA inclusions stained positive for X-34 but did not colocalize with RD(AK)- YFP inclusions (open arrow). (B). Two populations of cells, one expressing RD(AK)- CFP/YFP, and the other expressing RD(LM)-HA, were co-cultured for 48 h. RD(PP)-HA or non-transfected cells, NT, were used as controls. FRET was increased by co-culture with RD(LM)-HA, but not with RD(PP)-HA, or mock-transfected cells (n=3). (C). To test for cell death induced by tau aggregates as a mechanism of tau release, HEK293 cells were transfected for 48 h with RD-HA (PP, ÎÎ, or LM), or were mock-transfected. Mock- transfected cells were treated with varying concentrations of staurosporine (1 , 2, 4, 20 Î¼Î) for 30 minutes at 37Â°C to induce cell death. Cells were then exposed to 5 g/ml of propidium iodide and fluorescence was determined via plate reader. No evidence for cell death in the various transfected populations was observed. (** indicates a p-value <0.001 , error bars represent the SEM).\n\n[0022] FIG. 18 depicts images and graphs showing RD aggregates propagate misfolding between cells. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with various RD- CFP and RD-HA constructs. 15 h later, these cells were co-cultured with cells\n\nexpressing RD(AK)-YFP or RD(PP)-YFP for 48 h (A) FRET microscopy was performed to determine whether co-aggregation occurred via direct protein contact. CFP signal was measured before and after photobleaching of YFP. RD(LM)-CFP and RD(LM)-YFP aggregates had a mean FRET efficiency of 14.2% Â± 0.053 SD (n=1 1 ) indicative of RD(LM)-CFP and RD(LM)-YFP in direct contact. The upper and lower panels depict the acceptor and donor channels, respectively, before (Pre) and after (Post)\n\nphotobleaching. A representative heat map of the calculated FRET efficiency is shown at top right. The histogram depicts the calculated FRET efficiency on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The FRET efficiency of Tau RD aggregate was -25% in this cell. Negative values are derived from unpaired CFP. (B) A FRET signal was observed when cells expressing RD(AK)-CFP/RD-HA were co-cultured with cells expressing RD(AK)-YFP. This signal increased when aggregation of RD(AK)-CFP was induced by co-expression of aggregation-prone forms of tau, either ÎÎ, or LM mutants. No significant signal was noted when either RD-CFP or RD-YFP contained the PP mutation that blocks Î²-sheet formation (n=3). (C) To test for amplification of misfolding, populations of cells expressing CFP alone or RD(LM)-CFP were preexposed for 48 h to cells expressing RD-HA with either PP, ÎÎ, or LM mutations to promote misfolding to varying degrees. These co-cultured populations were then split and co-cultured for 48 h with cells expressing RD(AK)-YFP to determine the degree of aggregation reported by cell-cell transfer and FRET. Prior exposure of RD(LM)-HA cells to the RD(AK)-CFP cell population increased FRET signal by 2.6 fold vs. prior exposure to RD(PP)-HA .\n\nInterposition of cells expressing pure CFP in the second population of cells completely blocked the effect of prior exposure to aggregation-prone RD-HA mutants (n=3). (* indicates a p-value <0.05, ** indicates a p-value <0.001 , error bars represent the SEM).\n\n[0023] FIG. 19 depicts graphs and an immunoblot showing propagation of tau aggregates through the extracellular medium. (A) HEK293 cells transfected with RD(LM)-HA were co-cultured for 48 h with an equivalent number of RD(AK)-CFP/YFP cells prior to FRET analysis. Increasing the volume of cell culture medium reduced the efficiency of trans-cellular movement of aggregates. (B) Transfer of conditioned medium from cells expressing RD(LM)-HA to cells expressing RD(AK)-CFP/YFP was sufficient to induce aggregation by 60%. (C) HJ9.3 antibody added to the media reduced FRET, consistent with interference with propagation of aggregation. (D) Non-specific IgG had no effect on propagation. (E) HJ9.3 had no effect on intracellular aggregation of RD(AK)-CFP/YFP co-expressed within the same cell. (F) HJ9.3 blocked the effect of RD(LM)-HA to induce RD(AK)-YFP in co-cultured cells, as determined by detergent fractionation and western blot. (T= Total protein, S= Soluble protein and P= Pellet insoluble protein, (G) Quantitative analysis of three independent Western blots revealed a -60% decrease in the pellet fraction, relative to the total fraction, after exposure to HJ9.3. (H) Cells expressing RD(LM)-YFP and mCherry were co-cultured and analyzed by flow cytometry. HJ9.3 decreased the percentage of dual positive cells from 2.07% to 1 .31 %. Cells mixed just prior to cytometry were a background control (* indicates a p- value <0.05, ** indicates a p-value <0.001 , error bars represent the SEM).\n\n[0024] FIG. 20 depicts images of HEK293 cells transfected with RD(AK) - YFP (top panels) or mock-transfected (lower panels). HJ9.3 was added to the culture medium for the 48 h period. At the end of the experiment, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with an anti-mouse secondary antibody (labeled with Alexa 546). Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the localization of HJ9.3/tau\n\ncomplexes. The top panels show that many complexes are identified when RDA(K) - YFP is expressed, but none in its absence (lower panels). Orthogonal analyses (right panel) demonstrate that most complexes are present at the cell surface, although occasional intracellular complexes were observed. [0025] FIG. 21 depicts images and a graph showing Tau fibrils mediate cell-cell propagation. (A) Conditioned media was collected from transfected cell populations co-cultured for 0 h or 48 h with HJ9.3 or control IgG antibody (1 :1000), followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot. HJ9.3 specifically captured tau RD species from the cell media, while IgG did not. Higher-order aggregated species were present upon expression of RD(AK)- YFP or RD(LM)-YFP but not RD(PP)-YFP. (B) Quantitative analyses of three independent Western blots showed a ~10-fold increase in the tau after 48 h incubation. (C) Cells were exposed to HJ9.3 for various times. (D) Purified antibody/antigen complexes from media exposed for 48 h to HJ9.3 were deposited on AFM chips for imaging. Obvious fibrillar species in the media of cells expressing RD(AK)-HA and RD(LM)-HA were observed, while RD(PP)-HA produced only amorphous aggregates. Scale bar, 1Î¼Ï).\n\n[0026] FIG. 22 depicts a schematic and graphs showing HJ8.5 and HJ9.4 activity against recombinant human tau. (A) depicts a schematic illustrating a co-culture of RD (LM)-CFP and RD(AK280)-YFP cells in presence and absence of different monoclonal full length tau antibodies. (B) depicts a graph showing HJ8.5, HJ9.3 and HJ9.4 were able to block tau propagation. (C) depicts a graph showing HJ8.5, HJ9.3 and HJ9.4 were able to detect RD-tau fibrils in an ELISA assay.\n\n[0027] FIG. 23 depicts a schematic illustrating the experimental plan for (A) intracerebroventricular injection and (B) implantation of an osmotic pump in the lateral ventricle of each mouse. (C) shows an image verifying the placement of the cannula by cresyl violet staining.\n\n[0028] FIG. 24 depicts images of the anti-tau antibodies after 6 weeks infusion in P301 S tg mice by (A) Coomassie blue staining and (B) immunoblotting against recombinant longest human tau isoform hTau40 using antibodies taken from the pump before and after 6 weeks infusion.\n\n[0029] FIG. 25 depicts a graph showing lack of interference of infused tau antibodies in HJ8.7-BT2B ELISA for total tau. Indicated concentrations of antibodies were pre-incubated with recombinant human tau protein before applying to ELISA. [0030] FIG. 26 depicts images of coronal sections of piriform cortex of treated 9 month old P301 S tg mice treated with vehicle/PBS (top panels) or different anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (HJ8.5, HJ9.3 as labeled in bottom panels). Sections were stained with biotinylated AT8 antibody, which recognizes an abnormally\n\nphosphorylated form of tau.\n\n[0031 ] FIG. 27 depicts graphs showing the percent of area covered by AT8 staining of neurofibrillary tangles in the (A) hippocampus CA2 and CA3, (B) amygdala, (C) piriform cortex, and (D) entorhinal cortex.\n\n[0032] FIG. 28 graphs showing HJ9.3 antibody detection of tau fibrils and RD-tau monomer by ELISA. Different concentrations of RD-wt tau monomers and fibrils were coated on ELISA plate. HJ9.3 was used as the primary antibody. For the detection anti-mouse HRP linked antibody was used.\n\n[0033] FIG. 29 depicts a schematic illustrating trans-cellular propagation of tau aggregation occurring via transfer of fibrils within the cell medium. Protein aggregate in a donor cell escapes the cell (A), enters a recipient cell (B), and directly contacts natively folded protein (C) to amplify the misfolded state (D). This cell-cell movement is mediated by fibrils that are released directly into the medium. These fibrils can be trapped within the extracellular space by an anti-tau antibody (HJ9.3) that interferes with cell-cell propagation (E).\n\n[0034] FIG. 30. Characterization of anti-tau antibodies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Immunoblotting. The figure depicts SPR sensorgrams showing the binding of each anti-tau antibody towards immobilized recombinant human tau (longest isoforms hTau40, 441 aa) and immobilized mouse tau (longest isoforms mTau40, 432 aa). Each antibody was run with various concentrations (0.1 1 , 0.23, 0.46, 0.90, 1 .8, 3.7, 7.5 Î¼9/Î¹ÏÎ¹Î) and plots are shown in the corresponding color. (A) SPR sensorgrams of HJ9.3 antibody binding to immobilized human tau and immobilized mouse tau (B). (C) SPR sensorgrams of HJ9.4 antibody binding to immobilized human tau and immobilized mouse tau (D). SPR sensorgrams of HJ8.5 antibody binding to immobilized (E) human and (F) mouse tau. (G) RAB soluble fractions of 3 month old tau knockout (KO), 3 month old wild-type (WT), 3 month old P301 S (3mo) and 9 month old P301 S (9mo) mice were analyzed by immunoblot by using the indicated anti-tau antibodies.\n\n[0035] FIG. 31. SPR sensorgram of the interaction between anti-tau antibodies towards immobilized human tau fibrils. SPR sensorgrams of HJ9.3 (A),\n\nHJ9.4 (B) and HJ8.5 (C) anti tau antibodies run with various concentrations towards immobilized human tau fibrils.\n\n[0036] FIG. 32. Characterization of anti-tau antibodies in different assays. Immunostaining of brain sections from 3 month old tau knockout (KO), 3 month old wild type (WT), 3 month old P301 S (3mo), 12 month old P301 S (12mo) mice from the region of the piriform cortex and from the frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) tissue were stained with biotinylated HJ8.5 antibody. Insert in 12 month old P301 S micrograph shows cell body staining in addition to diffuse neuropil staining. Black arrow indicates the area magnified. Insert in human AD brain cortex micrograph shows the staining of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in higher magnification. Black arrow indicates the area magnified. Scale bar is 250 Î¼Î¹ÏÎ¹ in panel with tau KO, same magnification images. Scale bar 50 Î¼Î¹ÏÎ¹ in inserts of P301 S 12mo and AD.\n\n[0037] FIG. 33. Tau-antibodies block the uptake and seeding activity of P301 S tau aggregates as detected by a FRET assay. HEK293 cells expressing\n\nRD(AK280)-CFP/YFP were exposed to 2.5 pg of total protein of I xTBS brain lysates for 24 h. (A) Brain lysates collected from 12 mo old P301 S mice induced much greater seeding activity (n=5) as compared to lysates from knockout (KO) mice (n=7), wild type (WT) mice (n=6) or young 3-mo old P301 S mice (n=2) (****p<0.0001 ). (B) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RD (AK280)-CFP and RD (AK280)-YFP. 18hrs later, pre- incubated P301 S brain lysates with or without incubation of anti-tau antibodies (HJ8.5, HJ9.3 and HJ9.4) or control antibody (HJ3.4, anti ÎÎ² antibody) were added to cells. All the tau antibodies incubated with P301 S brain lysates significantly blocked seeding activity. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by\n\nDunnett's post hoc test for multiple comparisons by using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (***p>0.001 ). (C) Titration of these antibodies with various concentrations (0.125 pg/ml, 0.25 Mg/ml, 0.5 pg/ml, 1 pg/ml and 2 pg/ml) was performed with a fixed amount of P301 S brain lysates. 24 hrs later, FRET analysis was performed. Out of all tau- antibodies we used, HJ8.5 was the most potent in blocking the uptake and seeding activity of P301 S brain lysates. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons. (** p < 0.0001 , * p < 0.01 , Values represent mean Â± SEM).\n\n[0038] FIG. 34. No detected cellular uptake of tau antibodies bound to P301 S Tau aggregates. P301 S brain lysates were added to HEK293 cells for 3hrs. For detection of tau, all 3 different anti-tau or control (HJ3.4, ÎÎ² antibody) antibodies were used followed by Alexa-fluor546 anti-mouse IgG staining. In addition, P301 S brain lysates were pre-incubated with and without 3 different anti-tau antibodies and HJ3.4 antibody, then added to HEK293 cells, fixed and permeabilized. Alexa-fluor546 anti- mouse IgG were used to identify the internalized antibodies. 4',6'-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI ; shown in blue) was used for nuclear stain.\n\n[0039] FIG. 35.

(A) Experimental plan for infusion of antibodies or vehicle (PBS) by intracerebroventricular injection into the left lateral ventricle of the brain. (B) Representative cresyl violet staining of the coronally sectioned brain region to verify the surgically implanted probe placement into the left lateral ventricle.

There was reduced AT8 staining in several different brain regions in the anti-tau antibody treated mice compared to PBS or HJ3.4 antibody treated mice. HJ8.5 had the largest effects. ** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05, values represent mean Â± SEM.\n\n[0042] FIG. 38. Quantification of biotinylated AT8 antibody staining in male and female P301 S mice.

Representative images of CD68 staining of activated microglia in the piriform cortex of 9 month old P301 S mice treated with PBS (A), HJ3.4 antibody (B), HJ8.5 antibody (C), HJ9.3 antibody (D) and HJ9.4 antibody (E).\n\n[0046] FIG. 42. Insoluble tau levels are reduced by antibodies HJ8.5 and HJ9.3 in P301 S mice. The cortex of all the treated mice [PBS (N=16), HJ3.4 antibody (N=8) HJ8.5 (N=13), HJ9.3 (N=15), HJ9.4 (N=13)] were sequentially extracted by RAB (A), RIPA (B) and 70% FA (C) and their tau levels were quantified by ELISA. There were no statistical differences in soluble tau levels in RAB and RIPA fractions between the groups. However, there was a significant decrease of insoluble tau levels in 70% FA fractions in the HJ8.5 and HJ9.3 anti-tau antibodies treated mice compared to the PBS or HJ3.4 antibody treated groups. Insoluble tau levels in the HJ9.4 antibody treated mice were not different from the control groups (**p<0.01 ). Levels of human tau (D), mouse tau (E) and phospho tau at Ser202 and Thr205 (F) levels were assessed in 70% FA fractions by specific anti-human, anti-mouse, or anti-phospho tau antibodies by ELISA (n=6 mice per treatment group). There was a decrease in human tau levels in all groups of anti-tau antibody treated mice and no change in mouse tau levels. In 70% FA fractions, we also found that phospho tau at Ser202 and Thr205 as detected by AT8 reactivity was reduced in anti-tau antibody treated mice compared to controls, similar to total human tau.\n\n[0047] FIG. 43. Anti-tau antibody treated P301 S mice have decreased tau seeding activity in cortical extracts as detected by FRET assay. (A) Tau seeding activity was measured with RAB soluble fractions of all PBS (N=16), HJ3.4 (N=8), HJ8.5\n\n(N=13), HJ9.3 (N=15), and HJ9.4 (N=13) treated mice on HEK293 cells by FRET assay. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RD (AK280)-CFP and RD (AK280)-YFP. 18 hrs later, RAB soluble fractions were added to cells. Seeding activity was significantly reduced in HJ8.5, and HJ9.3 antibody treated mice compared to the PBS or HJ3.4 antibody treated mice. RAB soluble fractions from HJ9.4 antibody treated mice did not have decreased seeding activity compared to the PBS or HJ3.4 antibody RAB soluble fractions (***p<0.001 , Values represent mean Â± SEM). (B) RAB soluble fractions were immunoprecipitated from tau knockout, PBS, or anti-tau antibody treated mice. Elution of any seeding activity from the antibody/bead complexes was measured by FRET assay. There was significantly less seeding activity observed in HJ8.5 and HJ9.3 antibody treated mice versus PBS-treated mice (****p<0.0001 , values represent mean Â± SEM). (C) 70% FA fractions of 9 month old P301 S brain cortex region of all treated groups analyzed by ELISA showed a strong correlation with FRET analysis performed with the RAB soluble fractions. (D) Comparison between tau levels (X-axis) and seeding activity (Y-axis) present in RAB soluble fractions of 9 month old P301 S brain cortex of all treated mice assessed. There was no significant correlation between these 2 measures. (E) Tau species in the RAB soluble fractions of 3 month old knockout (KO), 3 month old wild type (WT), 3 month old P301 S, and 9 month old PBS-treated P301 S mice were separated on SDD-AGE, followed by western blotting. Polyclonal mouse anti- tau antibody was used for detecting tau species. High molecular weight tau species present in the RAB soluble fraction in both 3 month old P301 S mice and larger amounts present in 9 month old P301 S mice.\n\n[0048] FIG. 44. Groups did not differ significantly in terms of locomotor activity, sensorimotor function or on the auditory cue component of the conditioned fear test. The results of rmANOVAs failed to reveal significant main or interaction effects involving Treatment for total ambulations in the holeboard test (A), for the ledge test (B) or any other of the sensorimotor measures (not shown), or on the accelerating rotarod (C). Data from the altered context baseline on day 3 of conditioned fear testing yielded a significant effect of Treatment (*p=0.027) and subsequent comparisons showed that a large portion of this effect was due to significant differences between the HJ9.4 mice and the PBS+HJ3.4 control group (p=0.0007). (D). However, no significant main or interaction effects of Treatment were found following an rmANOVA on the auditory cue data (min 3-10) suggesting that the freezing levels were not significantly different among the groups during this time (E). To assess whether activity levels may have had an effect on freezing during the contextual fear test on day 2, we computed Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between total ambulations measured during the holeboard test versus % time spent freezing during the contextual fear test and found that they were not significantly correlated (p=0.39) (F).\n\n[0049] FIG. 45. Contextual fear conditioning deficits in P301 S tau transgenic mice are rescued by HJ8.5 and HJ9.4 antibody treatments. (A) On day 1 of conditioned fear testing, no differences were observed among groups in freezing levels during either the 2-min baseline condition or the tone/shock (T/S) training as indicated by the lack of a significant main or interaction effects involving Treatment following rmANOVAs on these data. (B) In contrast, a significant effect of Treatment (*p=0.019) and a significant Treatment by Minutes interaction (**p=0.0001 ) were observed following an rmANOVA on freezing levels during the contextual fear testing on day 2. Only the HJ9.4 group showed significant habituation from minute 1 versus minute 8, (#p=0.002). (C) Subsequent planned comparisons showed that freezing in the HJ8.5 and HJ9.4 tau antibody groups was significantly increased relative to the PBS+HJ3.4 control group when averaged across the 8-min session (**p=0.006 and *p=0.022, respectively).\n\nHowever, further analyses of the data showed that the largest differences between the HJ9.4 group and the PBS+HJ3.4 controls occurred during minute 2 (â p=0.004), while the largest differences between the HJ8.5 treated mice and the control group were found during minutes 4-7 (â â p<0.004) as depicted in \"B\".\n\n[0050] FIG. 46 depicts a graph showing a sandwich Tau ELISA assay can be used to discriminate between plasma samples that are positive for seeding activity and plasma samples that are negative for seeding activity. Seeding activity was determined as described in Kfoury et al 2012 J Biol Chem 287(23). Amount of tau aggregate is reported as relative fold-change induction over signal from plasma collected from healthy young humans (i.e. background signal of the assay).\n\n[0051 ] FIG. 47 depicts graphs showing the effect of anti-tau antibodies of the invention on a tau cellular propagation assay.

Cells were exposed to recombinant RD fibrils that were chemically labeled with a fluorescent dye. After trypsinization and dispersion, the cells were counted using a flow cytometer.

Under all these diseased conditions, monomeric tau is known to be converted into polymeric ordered fibrils.\n\nNeurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are comprised of fibrillar tau aggregates, are a neuropathological hallmark of tauopathies. Applicants have discovered that spreading of tau pathology in the brain may be caused by a form of tau aggregate released from a \"donor\" cell entering a second \"recipient\" cell, and inducing further misfolding and aggregation of tau in the recipient cell via direct protein-protein contact. The specific form of tau aggregate which facilitates this cell-to-cell spread of tau aggregates is referred to as \"tau seeds\" and the activity may be referred to herein as \"seeding activity\", since this form of tau aggregate seeds or nucleates tau aggregation in the cell it enters (i.e. the \"recipient cell\").\n\n[0056] Tau can exist in both a monomeric form and in different aggregated forms. As used herein, the term \"tau aggregate\" refers to a molecular complex that comprises two or more tau monomers. Without wishing to be bound by theory, a tau aggregate may comprise a nearly unlimited number of monomers bound together. For example, a tau aggregate may comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more tau monomers. Alternatively, a tau aggregate may comprise 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or more tau monomers. A tau aggregate may also comprise 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000 or more tau monomers. The terms \"fibrillar tau aggregate\" and \"tau fibril\" refer to forms of tau aggregates, and these terms are used interchangeably herein. A fibrillar tau aggregate is a polymeric, ordered fiber comprising tau. Tau fibrils are generally not soluble, but shorter assemblies, or oligomers, can be soluble. Tau aggregate also refers to soluble tau oligomers and protofibrils, which may act as intermediates during tau aggregation. Also included in the definition of tau aggregate is the term \"tau seed\", which refers to a tau aggregate that is capable of nucleating or \"seeding\" intracellular tau aggregation when internalized by a cell, or when exposed to monomeric tau in vitro. Tau seeding activity may be assessed in a cellular tau\n\naggregation assay as described herein.\n\n[0057] In addition, applicants have discovered antibodies that specifically bind to tau and methods of use thereof. In an aspect, the present invention provides antibodies that specifically bind tau. In another aspect, the present invention provides means for effectively slowing and/or reducing cell-to-cell propagation of tau aggregation. Antibodies of the invention may slow and/or reduce the propagation of tau aggregation by promoting the disaggregation of protein fibrils, blockading the conversion of monomeric tau into aggregated tau in the cell, promoting intracellular degradation of tau aggregates, preventing entry of the tau aggregates into neighboring cells, or a\n\ncombination thereof. In another aspect, the present invention provides means to detect tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject. In another aspect, the present invention provides means to measure the amount of tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject. In another aspect, the present invention provides means to classify a subject based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject. Classifying a subject based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in a sample of biological fluid obtained from the subject may be used to identify subjects that will develop a symptom and/or disease associated with tau aggregation in the subject's lifetime. [0058] The present invention encompasses the discovery that anti-tau antibodies may slow the propagation of fibrillar tau aggregates by binding extracellular tau released from cells, thereby preventing entry of the tau aggregates into neighboring cells and slowing spread of tau aggregation. In an aspect, the present invention provides means for preventing entry of a tau aggregate into a cell. In another aspect, the present invention provides means for reducing intracellular tau aggregation. In another aspect, the present invention provides means for decreasing tau seeding activity. Antibodies of the invention useful in preventing entry of the tau aggregates into neighboring cells include those which bind an epitope within tau.\n\nI. Antibodies that bind to tau\n\n[0059] In humans, there are six isoforms of tau that are generated by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10. The isoforms ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids. Exons 2 and 3 encode 29-amino acid inserts each in the N-terminus (called N, and hence, tau isoforms may be 2N (both inserts), 1 N (exon 2 only), or ON (neither). All tau isoforms have three repeats of the microtubule binding domain. Inclusion of exon 10 at the C-terminus leads to inclusion of a fourth microtubule binding domain encoded by exon 10. Hence, tau isoforms may be comprised of four repeats of the microtubule binding domain (exon 10 included) or three repeats of the microtubule binding domain (exon 10 excluded). Anti-tau antibodies of the invention may include antibodies that bind any of the isoforms of tau. In an exemplary embodiment, anti-tau antibodies of the invention may include antibodies that bind to an isoform of tau that comprises exon 10.\n\n[0060] As noted above, tau can be found in soluble and insoluble compartments, in monomeric and aggregated forms, in ordered or disordered structures, intracellular^ and extracellularly, and may be complexed with other proteins or molecules. Anti-tau antibodies of the invention may include antibodies that bind to one or more forms of tau as described. In some embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds a tau monomer. In other embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds a tau\n\naggregate. In still other embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds a tau fibril. In different embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds a tau monomer and a tau aggregate. In alternative embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds to a tau aggregate and a tau fibril. In different embodiments, an anti-tau antibody binds to a tau fibril and a tau monomer.\n\n[0061 ] Anti-tau antibodies useful herein also include all antibodies that specifically bind tau aggregates present in a biological sample. Anti-tau antibodies useful herein also include all antibodies that reduce cell-to-cell propagation of tau aggregation. In other words, useful antibodies slow and/or decrease the amount of tau that enters recipient cells, compared to the amount that would enter a recipient cell in the absence of an antibody of the invention. Hence, useful antibodies decrease the amount of tau aggregation that occurs in the recipient cells.\n\n[0062] In an aspect, antibodies useful herein include those antibodies which have been isolated, characterized, purified, are functional and have been recovered (obtained) for use in a functional therapeutic composition which is\n\nadministered to a living subject. In another aspect, antibodies useful herein include those antibodies which have been isolated, characterized, purified, are functional and have been recovered (obtained) for use in an assay to detect tau aggregates in a biological sample obtained from a living subject and predict the development of symptoms associated with tau aggregation over the lifetime of the subject. In another aspect, antibodies useful herein include those antibodies which have been isolated, characterized, purified, are functional and have been recovered (obtained) or for use in an assay to detect tau aggregates in a biological sample obtained from a living subject and classify the subject as having an increased risk of developing symptoms associated with tau aggregation over the subject's lifetime. In another aspect, antibodies useful herein include those antibodies which have been isolated, characterized, purified, are functional and have been recovered (obtained) for use and are listed in Table A, as well as variants thereof (e.g. humanized forms, chimeric forms, and immunological fragments). Table A. Antibodies of the invention\n\n[0063] The term \"antibody\" includes the term \"monoclonal antibody\".\n\n\"Monoclonal antibody\" refers to an antibody that is derived from a single copy or clone, including e.g., any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone. \"Monoclonal antibody\" is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced using e.g., hybridoma techniques well known in the art, as well as recombinant technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic technologies or combinations of such technologies and other technologies readily known in the art. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody may be labeled with a detectable label, immobilized on a solid phase and/or conjugated with a heterologous compound (e.g., an enzyme or toxin) according to methods known in the art.\n\n[0064] Further by \"antibody\" is meant a functional monoclonal antibody, or an immunologically effective fragment thereof; such as an Fab, Fab', or F(ab')2 fragment thereof. In some contexts herein, fragments will be mentioned specifically for emphasis; nevertheless, it will be understood that regardless of whether fragments are specified, the term \"antibody\" includes such fragments as well as single-chain forms. As long as the protein retains the ability specifically to bind its intended target, it is included within the term \"antibody.\" Also included within the definition \"antibody\" for example are single chain forms, generally designated Fv regions, of antibodies with this specificity. Preferably, but not necessarily, the antibodies useful in the discovery are produced recombinantly, as manipulation of the typically murine or other non-human antibodies with the appropriate specificity is required in order to convert them to humanized form. Antibodies may or may not be glycosylated. Antibodies are properly cross-linked via disulfide bonds, as is known.\n\n[0065] The basic antibody unit of an antibody useful herein comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 1 10 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function.\n\n[0066] Anti-tau antibodies useful herein include those which are isolated, characterized, purified, function and have been recovered (obtained) from a process for their preparation and thus available for use herein in a useful form in a therapeutically, medicinally, or diagnostically sufficient amount.\n\n[0067] Light chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, and lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgO, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \"J\" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \"D\" region of about 10 more amino acids.\n\n[0068] The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. The chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarily determining regions (hereinafter referred to as \"CDRs.\") The CDRs from the two chains are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C- terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1 , CDR1 , FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4 respectively. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with known conventions (See, Kabat \"Sequences of Proteins of\n\nImmunological Interest\" National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991 ; Chothia, et al, J. Mol. Bio. (1987) 196:901 -917; Chothia, et al., Nature (1989) 342:878- 883).\n\n[0069] In an aspect, monoclonal anti-tau antibodies are generated with appropriate specificity by standard techniques of immunization of mammals, forming hybridomas from the antibody-producing cells of said mammals or otherwise\n\nimmortalizing them, and culturing the hybridomas or immortalized cells to assess them for the appropriate specificity. In the present case, such antibodies could be generated by immunizing a human, rabbit, rat or mouse, for example, with a peptide representing an epitope encompassing a region of the tau protein coding sequence or an appropriate subregion thereof. Materials for recombinant manipulation can be obtained by retrieving the nucleotide sequences encoding the desired antibody from the hybridoma or other cell that produces it. These nucleotide sequences can then be manipulated and isolated, characterized, purified and, recovered to provide them in humanized form, for use herein if desired.\n\n[0070] As used herein \"humanized antibody\" includes an anti-tau antibody that is composed partially or fully of amino acid sequences derived from a human antibody germline by altering the sequence of an antibody having non-human\n\ncomplementarity determining regions (\"CDR\"). The simplest such alteration may consist simply of substituting the constant region of a human antibody for the murine constant region, thus resulting in a human/murine chimera which may have sufficiently low immunogenicity to be acceptable for pharmaceutical use. Preferably, however, the variable region of the antibody and even the CDR is also humanized by techniques that are by now well known in the art. The framework regions of the variable regions are substituted by the corresponding human framework regions leaving the non-human CDR substantially intact, or even replacing the CDR with sequences derived from a human genome. CDRs may also be randomly mutated such that binding activity and affinity for tau is maintained or enhanced in the context of fully human germline framework regions or framework regions that are substantially human. Substantially human frameworks have at least 90%, 95%, or 99% sequence identity with a known human framework sequence. Fully useful human antibodies may also be produced in genetically modified mice whose immune systems have been altered to correspond to human immune systems. As mentioned above, it is sufficient for use in the methods of this discovery, to employ an immunologically specific fragment of the antibody, including fragments representing single chain forms.\n\n[0071 ] Further, as used herein the term \"humanized antibody\" refers to an anti-tau antibody comprising a human framework, at least one CDR from a nonhuman antibody, and in which any constant region present is substantially identical to a human immunoglobulin constant region, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably at least 95% identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized antibody, except possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding pairs of one or more native human\n\nimmunoglobulin sequences.\n\n[0072] If desired, the design of humanized immunoglobulins may be carried out as follows. When an amino acid falls under the following category, the framework amino acid of a human immunoglobulin to be used (acceptor\n\nimmunoglobulin) is replaced by a framework amino acid from a CDR-providing nonhuman immunoglobulin (donor immunoglobulin): (a) the amino acid in the human framework region of the acceptor immunoglobulin is unusual for human immunoglobulin at that position, whereas the corresponding amino acid in the donor immunoglobulin is typical for human immunoglobulin at that position; (b) the position of the amino acid is immediately adjacent to one of the CDRs; or (c) any side chain atom of a framework amino acid is within about 5-6 angstroms (center-to-center) of any atom of a CDR amino acid in a three dimensional immunoglobulin model (Queen, et al., op. cit., and Co, ct al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991 ) 88:2869). When each of the amino acids in the human framework region of the acceptor immunoglobulin and a corresponding amino acid in the donor immunoglobulin is unusual for human immunoglobulin at that position, such an amino acid is replaced by an amino acid typical for human\n\nimmunoglobulin at that position.\n\n[0073] In all instances, an antibody of the invention specifically binds tau. In exemplary embodiments, an antibody of the invention specifically binds human tau. The phrase \"specifically binds\" herein means antibodies bind to the protein with an affinity constant or Affinity of interaction (KD) in the range of 0.1 pM to 10 nM, with a preferred range being 0.1 pM to 1 nM. The sequence of tau from a variety of species is known in the art, and methods of determining whether an antibody binds to tau are known in the art. For instance, see the Examples.\n\n[0074] The antibodies of the present invention may also be used as fusion proteins known as single chain variable fragments (scFv). These scFvs are comprised of the heavy and light chain variable regions connected by a linker. In most instances, but not all, the linker may be a peptide. A linker peptide is preferably from about 10 to 25 amino acids in length. Preferably, a linker peptide is rich in glycine, as well as serine or theronine. ScFvs can be used to facilitate phage display or can be used for flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or as targeting domains. Methods of making and using scFvs are known in the art.\n\n[0075] In a preferred embodiment, the scFvs of the present invention are conjugated to a human constant domain. In some embodiments, the heavy constant domain is derived from an IgG domain, such as lgG1 , lgG2, lgG3, or lgG4. In other embodiments, the heavy chain constant domain may be derived from IgA, IgM, or IgE.\n\n[0076] An isolated antibody of the present invention that binds to tau preferably recognizes one of several epitopes. In one embodiment, the isolated antibody of the present invention that binds to tau recognizes an epitope listed in Table A.

Method of use\n\n[0091 ] In an aspect, the present invention provides antibodies for use in a functional therapeutic composition which is administered to a living subject. In another aspect, the present invention provides antibodies for use in an immunoassay to detect tau aggregates in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a living subject. In another aspect, the present invention provides antibodies for use in an immunoassay to measure the amount of tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a living subject. The amount of tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject can be used to classify a subject as having high or low amounts of tau aggregate, and may be further used to predict the risk of developing symptoms and / or disease associated with tau aggregation over the lifetime of the subject.\n\n[0092] Suitable subjects include, but are not limited to, a human, a livestock animal, a companion animal, a lab animal, and a zoological animal. In one embodiment, the subject may be a rodent, e.g. a mouse, a rat, a guinea pig, etc. In another embodiment, the subject may be a livestock animal. Non-limiting examples of suitable livestock animals may include pigs, cows, horses, goats, sheep, llamas and alpacas. In yet another embodiment, the subject may be a companion animal. Non- limiting examples of companion animals may include pets such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds. In yet another embodiment, the subject may be a zoological animal.

Method of treatment\n\n[0093] In an aspect, the present invention comprises a method of reducing the spread of tau aggregation in the brain of a subject. In another aspect the present invention comprises a method for reducing intracellular aggregation of tau induced by tau seeds. In each aspect, the method comprises administering a pharmacologically effective amount of anti-tau antibody to a subject. Suitable antibodies are described above in Section I. In a preferred embodiment, an antibody is selected from the group consisting of an antibody from Table 1 and an antibody from Table 2, including a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody or an immunological fragment thereof.\n\n[0094] A subject may or may not be having a symptom associated with tau aggregation prior to administration of a pharmacologically effective amount of anti- tau antibody. Stated another way, a subject may or may not be experiencing a symptom associated with tau aggregation. A skilled artisan will appreciate that pathological tau aggregation likely commences prior to diagnosis or the onset of symptoms associated with tau aggregation. In some embodiments, a subject is having a symptom associated with tau aggregation. In other embodiments, a subject is not having a symptom associated with tau aggregation. In still other embodiments, a subject has detectable tau pathology but is not having any other symptom associated with tau aggregation. Reducing the spread of tau aggregation in the brain of a subject may reduce the development and/or progression of symptoms associated with the pathological aggregation of tau.\n\n[0095] Preventing propagation of fibrillar tau aggregates may treat pathologies associated with generation and spread of tau aggregates. As used herein, the terms \"treating\" or \"treatment\" include prevention, attenuation, reversal, or improvement in at least one symptom or sign of symptoms associated with tau aggregation. One definition of symptoms associated with tau aggregation refers to any symptom caused by the formation of tau aggregates being composed of, in part, tau fibrils. Exemplary disorders that have symptoms associated with tau aggregation include, but are not limited to, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia pugilistica (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, Lytico-Bodig disease (Parkinson-dementia complex of Guam), tangle-predominant dementia, ganglioglioma and gangliocytoma,\n\nmeningioangiomatosis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, lead encephalopathy, tuberous sclerosis, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, lipofuscinosis, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's Disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Methods for diagnosing these disorders are known in the art.\n\n[0096] Exemplary symptoms associated with tau aggregation may include impaired cognitive function, altered behavior, emotional dysregulation, seizures, and impaired nervous system structure or function. Impaired cognitive function includes but is not limited to difficulties with memory, attention, concentration, language, abstract thought, creativity, executive function, planning, and organization. Altered behavior includes but is not limited to physical or verbal aggression, impulsivity, decreased inhibition, apathy, decreased initiation, changes in personality, abuse of alcohol, tobacco or drugs, and other addiction-related behaviors. Emotional dysregulation includes but is not limited to depression, anxiety, mania, irritability, and emotional incontinence. Seizures include but are not limited to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, complex partial seizures, and non-epileptic, psychogenic seizures. Impaired nervous system structure or function includes but is not limited to hydrocephalus, Parkinsonism, sleep disorders, psychosis, impairment of balance and coordination. This includes motor impairments such as monoparesis, hemiparesis, tetraparesis, ataxia, ballismus and tremor. This also includes sensory loss or dysfunction including olfactory, tactile, gustatory, visual and auditory sensation. Furthermore, this includes autonomic nervous system impairments such as bowel and bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, blood pressure and temperature dysregulation. Finally, this includes hormonal impairments attributable to dysfunction of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland such as deficiencies and dysregulation of growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, lutenizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, gonadotropin releasing hormone, prolactin, and numerous other hormones and modulators. Methods for detecting and evaluating symptoms associated with tau aggregation are known in the art.\n\n[0097] In some embodiments, a symptom associated with tau aggregation refers to dementia. Dementia is not itself a specific disease, but is an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Dementia is also a shared clinical feature of many diseases associated with tau aggregation. A skilled practitioner will be familiar with the numerous methods available to diagnose the severity of dementia. For example, several cognitive tests and screening questionnaires for dementia are known in the art, all with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Non-limiting examples include the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the abbreviated mental test may score (AMTS), the modified mini mental state exam (3MS), the cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI), the Trail- making test, the clock drawing test, the Informant Questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly, the General practitioner assessment of cognition, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Eight-item informant interview to differentiate aging and dementia (AD8).\n\n[0098] In some embodiments, the severity of the symptoms of dementia are quantified using the CDR. Using the CDR, a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, a score of 0.5 indicates very mild symptoms, a score of 1 indicates mild symptoms, a score of 2 indicates moderate symptoms and a score of 3 indicates severe symptoms. Thus, any increase in a CDR score for a subject indicates a worsening in cognition and an increase in dementia. Moreover, change in CDR from 0 to greater than 0, indicates the development or onset of dementia.\n\n[0099] In some embodiments, a symptom associated with tau aggregation refers to tau pathology. The term \"tau pathology\" refers to the pathological aggregation of tau. In some embodiments, tau pathology refers to neurofibrially tangles. In other embodiments, tau pathology refers to hyperphosphorylated tau. In still other\n\nembodiments, tau pathology refers to a high level of tau aggregates detectable in blood, plasma, serum, CSF, or ISF, anywhere from 1 .2 to approximately 40-fold higher than that detected in individuals without disease. Methods for detecting pathological aggregation of tau are in known in the art and further detailed in the Examples.\n\n[0100] In an exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing the spread of tau aggregation in the brain of a subject comprises administering a pharmacologically effective amount of anti-tau antibody to the subject, wherein the antibody is selected from the group consisting of an isolated antibody comprising a light chain variable region comprising a CDR1 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 16 with zero to two amino acid substitutions, an isolated antibody comprising a light chain variable region comprising a CDR2 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 17 with zero to two amino acid substitutions, an isolated antibody comprising a light chain variable region comprising a CDR3 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 18 with zero to two amino acid\n\nsubstitutions, an isolated antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising a CDR1 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 19 with zero to two amino acid\n\nsubstitutions, an isolated antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising a CDR2 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 20 with zero to two amino acid\n\nsubstitutions, and an isolated antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising a CDR3 of amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 21 with zero to two amino acid substitutions.\n\n[0101 ] In another exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing the spread of tau aggregation in the brain of a subject comprises administering a\n\npharmacologically effective amount of anti-tau antibody to the subject, wherein the antibody specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 (DRKDQGGYTMHQD).\n\n[0102] In another exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing the spread of tau aggregation in the brain of a subject comprises administering a\n\npharmacologically effective amount of anti-tau antibody to the subject, wherein the antibody specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 (DRKDQGGYTMHQD).\n\n[0103] The antibodies in a pharmacologically effective amount preferred in pharmaceutical grade, including immunologically reactive fragments, may be\n\nadministered to a subject. Administration is performed using standard effective techniques, include peripherally (i.e. not by administration into the central nervous system) or locally to the central nervous system. Peripheral administration includes but is not limited to intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or suppository administration. Local administration, including directly into the central nervous system (CNS) includes, but is not limited to, via a lumbar, intraventricular or intraparenchymal catheter or using a surgically implanted controlled release formulation.\n\n[0104] Pharmaceutical compositions for effective administration are deliberately designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as compatible dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack\n\nPublishing Co., Easton Pa., 16Ed ISBN: 0-912734-04-3, latest edition, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners. It may be particularly useful to alter the solubility characteristics of the antibodies useful in this discovery, making them more lipophilic, for example, by encapsulating them in liposomes or by blocking polar groups.\n\n[0105] Effective peripheral systemic delivery by intravenous or\n\nintraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection is a preferred method of administration to a living patient. Suitable vehicles for such injections are straightforward. In addition, however, administration may also be effected through the mucosal membranes by means of nasal aerosols or suppositories. Suitable formulations for such modes of administration are well known and typically include surfactants that facilitate cross- membrane transfer. Such surfactants are often derived from steroids or are cationic lipids, such as N-[1 -(2,3-dioleoyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium chloride (DOTMA) or various compounds such as cholesterol hemisuccinate, phosphatidyl glycerols and the like.\n\n[0106] The concentration of humanized antibody in formulations to be administered is an effective amount and ranges from as low as about 0.1 % by weight to as much as about 15 or about 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, and so forth, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected if desired. A typical composition for injection to a living patient could be made up to contain from 1 -5 ml_ sterile buffered water of phosphate buffered saline and about 1 -5000 mg of any one of or a combination of the humanized antibody of the present discovery. The formulation could be sterile filtered after making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically acceptable. A typical composition for intravenous infusion could have volumes between 1 -250 ml_ of fluid, such as sterile Ringer's solution, and 1 -100 mg per ml, or more in anti-tau antibody concentration. Therapeutic agents of the discovery can be frozen or lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable sterile carrier prior to use. Lyophilization and reconstitution may lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (e.g. with conventional immune globulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies).\n\nDosages administered are effective dosages and may have to be adjusted to\n\ncompensate. The pH of the formulations that are generally of pharmaceutical grade quality will be selected to balance antibody stability (chemical and physical) and comfort to the patient when administered. Generally, a pH between 4 and 8 is tolerated. Doses will vary from individual to individual based on size, weight, and other physio-biological characteristics of the individual receiving the successful administration.\n\n[0107] As used herein, the term \"effective amount\" means an amount of a substance such as a compound that leads to measurable and beneficial effects for the patient administered the substance, i.e., significant efficacy. The effective amount or dose of compound administered according to this discovery will be determined by the circumstances surrounding the case, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the status of the symptoms being treated and similar patient and administration situation considerations among other considerations. In an aspect, a typical dose contains from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of an anti-tau antibody described herein. Doses can range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, or from 0.5 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg. The frequency of dosing may be daily or once, twice, three times or more per week or per month, as needed as to effectively treat the symptoms. Alternatively, the frequency of dosing may be at least once every three months, as needed as to effectively treat the symptoms. For example, dosing may be about every 5 weeks, about every 6 weeks, about every 7 weeks, about every 8 weeks, about every 9 weeks, about every 10 weeks, about every 1 1 weeks, or about every 12 weeks.\n\n[0108] The timing of administration of the treatment relative to the disease itself and duration of treatment will be determined by the circumstances surrounding the case. Treatment could begin after diagnosis of a disease associated with tau\n\naggregation. Alternatively, treatment could begin after clinical confirmation of a symptom associated with tau aggregation. Further still, treatment could begin after detection of tau pathology. Treatment could begin immediately in a hospital or clinic, or at a later time after discharge from the hospital or after being seen in an outpatient clinic. Duration of treatment could range from a single dose administered on a one-time basis to a life-long course of therapeutic treatments.\n\n[0109] Although the foregoing methods appear the most convenient and most appropriate and effective for administration of proteins such as humanized antibodies, by suitable adaptation, other effective techniques for administration, such as intraventricular administration, transdermal administration and oral administration may be employed provided proper formulation is utilized herein. [01 10] In addition, it may be desirable to employ controlled release formulations using biodegradable films and matrices, or osmotic mini-pumps, or delivery systems based on dextran beads, alginate, or collagen.\n\n[01 1 1 ] Typical dosage levels can be determined and optimized using standard clinical techniques and will be dependent on the mode of administration.\n\nB. Method of detecting tau aggregates in biological fluid\n\n[01 12] In an aspect, the invention provides means to detect tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject. In another aspect, the invention provides means to measure the amount of tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject. The method generally comprises (i) obtaining a sample of a biological fluid from a subject, and (ii) measuring the amount of tau aggregate in the sample using an antibody that specifically binds tau. Suitable antibodies are described above in Section I. Suitable subjects are described above.\n\n[01 13] As used herein, the term \"biological fluid\" refers to a fluid obtained from a subject. Any biological fluid comprising a tau aggregate is suitable. Non-limiting examples include blood, plasma, serum, urine, CSF and ISF. The fluid may be used \"as is\", the cellular components may be isolated from the fluid, or a protein fraction may be isolated from the fluid using standard techniques.\n\n[01 14] As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, the method of collecting a sample of biological fluid can and will vary depending upon the nature of the biological fluid and the type of analysis to be performed. Any of a variety of methods generally known in the art may be utilized to collect a sample of biological fluid. Generally speaking, the method preferably maintains the integrity of the sample such that tau aggregate can be accurately detected and the amount measured according to the invention.\n\n[01 15] Once a sample is obtained, it is processed in vitro in order to detect and measure the amount of tau aggregate using an anti-tau antibody. In some embodiments, the concentration of tau aggregate in the sample is increased prior to detection and measurement. In some embodiments, tau aggregate is\n\nimmunoprecipitated from a sample prior to detection and measurement using at least one isolated anti-tau antibody. In other embodiments, tau aggregate is\n\nimmunoprecipitated from a sample prior to detection and measurement using at least two isolated anti-tau antibodies. In embodiments where at least two antibodies are used to immunoprecipitate tau aggregates, preferably a first antibody binds a first epitope of tau and a second antibody binds a second, non-overlapping epitope of tau. The use of two antibodies that bind two distinct epitopes of tau may be more efficient at capturing all possible tau aggregate conformers. Non-limiting examples of suitable antibody pairs for immunoprecipitation are listed in Table C. In a preferred embodiment, tau aggregate is immunoprecipitated from a sample prior to detection and measurement using at least two isolated anti-tau antibodies, wherein at least a first antibody recognizes an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 1 and at least a second antibody recognizes an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 8. A skilled artisan will be able to determine with routine experimentation whether or not tau aggregate in a sample needs to be concentrated or\n\nimmunoprecipitated prior to detection and measurement, and will be able to do so using methods known in the art.\n\nTable C\n\n[01 16] Methods for detecting and measuring an amount of protein using an antibody are well known in the art. All suitable methods for detecting and measuring an amount of protein using an antibody known to one of skill in the art are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Non-limiting examples include an ELISA, a sandwich immunoassay, a radioimmunoassay, an immunoblot or Western blot, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and an array.\n\n[01 17] In general, an antibody-based method of detecting and measuring an amount of tau aggregate comprises contacting some or all of the sample comprising tau aggregate with an anti-tau antibody under conditions effective to allow for formation of a complex between the antibody and the tau aggregate. Typically, the entire sample is not needed, allowing one skilled in the art to repeatedly detect and measure the amount of tau aggregate in the sample over time. The method may occur in solution, or the antibody or tau aggregate may be immobilized on a solid surface. Non-limiting examples of suitable surfaces include microtitre plates, test tubes, beads, resins, and other polymers. Attachment to the substrate may occur in a wide variety of ways, as will be appreciated by those in the art. For example, the substrate and the antibody may be derivatized with chemical functional groups for subsequent attachment of the two. For example, the substrate may be derivatized with a chemical functional group including, but not limited to, amino groups, carboxyl groups, oxo groups or thiol groups. Using these functional groups, the antibody may be attached directly using the functional groups or indirectly using linkers. An anti-tau antibody may also be attached to the substrate non-covalently. For example, a biotinylated anti-tau antibody may be prepared, which may bind to surfaces covalently coated with streptavidin, resulting in attachment. Alternatively, an antibody may be synthesized on the surface using techniques such as photopolymerization and photolithography.\n\n[01 18] Contacting the sample with an antibody under effective conditions for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of a complex generally involves adding the anti-tau antibody composition to the sample (or to the immunopreicipitated or concentrated tau aggregate) and incubating the mixture for a period of time long enough for the anti-tau antibody to bind to any antigen present. After this time, the complex may be washed and then the complex is detected and the amount measured by any method well known in the art. Methods of detecting and measuring an amount of an antibody - polypeptide complex are generally based on the detection of a label or marker. The term \"label\", as used herein, refers to any substance attached to an antibody, or other substrate material, in which the substance is detectable by a detection method. Non- limiting examples of suitable labels include luminescent molecules, chemiluminescent molecules, fluorochromes, fluorescent quenching agents, colored molecules,\n\nradioisotopes, scintillants, biotin, avidin, stretpavidin, protein A, protein G, antibodies or fragments thereof, polyhistidine, Ni2+, Flag tags, myc tags, heavy metals, and enzymes (including alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, and luciferase). Methods of detecting and measuring an amount of an antibody-polypeptide complex based on the detection of a label or marker are well known in the art.\n\n[01 19] In a preferred embodiment, a method for measuring the amount of tau aggregate in a sample is an immunoassay comprising two captures antibodies and a detection antibody, wherein each capture antibody is an isolated anti-tau antibody that recognizes a tau epitope distinct from the other, and the detection antibody is an isolated anti-tau antibody attached to a label. The detection antibody may be the same antibody as one of the two capture antibodies or, alternatively, the detection antibody may recognize a tau epitope not recognized by either capture antibody. Typically, the first capture antibody and the second capture antibody are used in an amount from about 10:1 to about 1 :10, from about 5:1 to about 1 :5, from about 3:1 to about 1 :3, or from about 2:1 to about 1 :2. In some embodiments, the first capture antibody and the second capture antibody are used at about equivalent concentrations. Non-limiting examples of suitable pairs of capture antibodies include the antibodies disclosed in\n\nTable D and Table E. Non-limiting examples of suitable detection antibodies include the antibodies listed in Table A, as well as antibodies that specifically bind tau and recognize an epitope within an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1 -1 1 . In an exemplary embodiment, a first capture antibody is an isolated antibody that specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 7, a second capture antibody is an isolated antibody that specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 8, and a detection antibody is an isolated antibody that specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 8.\n\nTable D First and Second Capture Antibodies\n\nTable E First and Second Capture Antibodies: each antibody specifically binds tau and recognizes an epitope within the amino acid sequence indicated by the SEQ ID NO shown.\n\nSEQ ID\n\nX X X X X X X NO: 6\n\nSEQ ID\n\nX X X X X X X NO: 7\n\nSEQ ID\n\nX X X X X X X NO: 8\n\n[0120] In another aspect, the invention provides means to classify a subject based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in a sample of biological fluid obtained from the subject. The method generally comprises (i) obtaining a sample of a biological fluid from a subject and measuring the amount of tau aggregate in the sample using an antibody that specifically binds tau, (ii) comparing the amount of tau aggregate in the sample to a reference value, and (iii) classifying the subject as having a high or low amount of tau aggregate based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in the sample. Methods for obtaining a sample of a biological fluid from a subject and measuring the amount of tau aggregate in the sample using an antibody that specifically binds tau are detailed above and further described in the Examples.\n\n[0121 ] Any suitable reference value known in the art may be used. For example, a suitable reference value may be the amount of tau aggregate in a sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject, or group of subjects, of the same species that has no clinically detectable symptom of tau aggregation. In another example, a suitable reference value may be the amount of tau aggregate in a biological fluid sample obtained from a subject, or group of subjects, of the same species that has no detectable tau pathology. In another example, a suitable reference value may be the amount of tau aggregate in a biological fluid sample obtained from a subject, or group of subjects, of the same species that has a Clinical Dementia Rating score of zero (CDR = 0). In another example, a suitable reference value may be the background signal of the assay as determined by methods known in the art. In another example, a suitable reference value may be a measurement of the amount of tau aggregate in a reference sample obtained from the same subject. The reference sample comprises the same type of biological fluid as the test sample, and may be obtained from a subject when the subject had no clinically detectable symptom of tau aggregation. A skilled artisan will appreciate that it is not always possible or desirable to obtain a reference sample from a subject when the subject is otherwise healthy. For example, when monitoring the effectiveness of a therapy, a reference sample may be a sample obtained from a subject before therapy began. In such an example, a subject may have tau pathology but may not have other symptoms of tau aggregation (e.g. dementia, declined cognition, etc.) or the subject may have tau pathology and one or more other symptom of tau aggregation. In an additional example, a suitable reference sample may be a biological fluid from an individual or group of individuals that has been shown not to have tau aggregates.\n\n[0122] According to the invention, a subject may be classified based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in the sample. Classifying a subject based on the amount of tau aggregate measured in a sample of biological fluid obtained from the subject may be used to identify subjects that will develop a disease and/or symptom associated with tau aggregation in the subject's lifetime. Generally speaking, a subject may be classified as having a high or low amount of tau aggregate compared to a reference value, wherein a high amount of tau aggregate is an amount above the reference value and a low amount is an amount equal to or below the reference value. In preferred embodiments, to classify a subject as having a high amount of tau aggregate, the amount of tau aggregate in the sample of biological fluid compared to the reference value is increased at least 2-fold. For example, the amount of tau aggregate in the sample compared to the reference value is increased at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 15-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 25-fold, at least 30- fold, at least 35-fold, at least 40-fold, at least 45-fold, or at least 50-fold. When the amount of tau aggregate in the sample of biological fluid obtained from a subject is increased at least 2-fold compared to a reference value, and the reference value is a sample of the same type of biological fluid obtained from one or more disease free individuals with no detectable symptom of tau aggregation (or a sample equivalent thereto), the subject is more likely to develop a disease and/or symptom associated with tau aggregation in the subject's lifetime.

Recent evidence from human studies suggests that tau pathology does not distribute randomly through the brain, but instead is linked to existing networks of neuronal connectivity. The fibrillar tau pathology of AD progresses along known anatomical connections, although the mechanisms by which networks degenerate are unknown. Importantly, recent pathological studies suggest that protein aggregates can move from one cell to another in human and mouse brain. Moreover, fibrillar forms of recombinant, human disease-associated proteins such as tau, SOD-1 , a- synuclein and polygutamines are readily taken up from the extracellular space to trigger intracellular misfolding. These phenomena are reminiscent of prion propagation, for which exosomes and tunneling nanotubes have been proposed to mediate trans-cellular spread. It is an open question as to whether tau aggregates might spread protein misfolding from cell to cell via direct cell-cell contact or through extracellular space. Furthermore, it has not yet been determined whether pathological tau species can mediate true trans-cellular\n\npropagation of aggregation, whereby an aggregate is released from a \"donor\" cell, enters a second \"recipient\" cell, and induces further misfolding via direct protein-protein contact, as opposed to more indirect mechanisms. Here it is tested whether tau fibrils are released directly into the extracellular space and can propagate aggregation by this mechanism.\n\nExample 1. Anti-tau antibodies\n\n[0131 ] Two series of anti-tau antibodies were created using standard techniques: the HJ8 series (mouse monoclonal antibodies against recombinant human tau), and the HJ9 series (mouse monoclonal antibodies against recombinant mouse tau) (Table 1 ). Binding epitopes have been mapped for many of the antibodies (Table\n\n[01 32] To characterize the binding affinity of the HJ8 and HJ9 series antibodies to mouse tau and human tau, Biacore's SPR technology was used. Biacore sensor chip CM-5 (Carboxymethylated dextran matrix) was activated by using EDC (1 - ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimid) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) in 1 :1 ratio. 2). Then ligand, either mouse tau or human Tau, were immobilized (20ug/ml, in 1 0 mM sodium acetate pH 3.5) on Biacore CM-5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 Î¼Î/min. The remaining unbound area on the Biacore CM-5 sensor chip was deactivated by passage of 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5.\n\n[01 33] Following preparation of the sensor chip surface, analytes (e.g. antibody) were injected with different concentrations (0.78nM - 400nM) in filtered, degassed 0.01 M Hepes buffer, 0.1 5 M NaCI, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4 at a flow rate of10 Î¼Î/min. All the samples were run in duplicates. After each cycle/run with single antibody concentration, the surface of the chip was regenerated by using 10 mM glycine pH 1.7, to remove the bound antibody/analyte, leaving the monomer/fibrils/ligand attached to the surface.\n\n[0134] From the SPR sensorgram (FIG.2-13), the rate of association or On rate "
