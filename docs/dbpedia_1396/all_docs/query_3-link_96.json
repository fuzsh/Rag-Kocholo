        "text": "Whether you’ve collected your first work or your 20th, there is always that lingering question: “How do I go about hanging art?”\n\nFor starters, there’s one simple, essential guideline you should definitely keep in mind when hanging art—always display the artwork’s center 57 inches from the floor. That’s a tip our gallery professionals use almost every day. But there are a few other tips related to the 57-inch rule that will make the difficult task of hanging art a whole lot easier.\n\nFollow these 3 easy rules for hanging art, your home will look like a professional art gallery in no time.\n\n1. Hang your Art by its Center\n\nPeople shouldn’t strain themselves to view the artwork. By placing the center of the artwork at eye level, it ensures the art can be admired comfortably.\n\nLet’s use this beautiful framed painting by Marcel Mouly (“Interieur au Bourgeois”) as our example.\n\nThe art’s focal point should be at the 57-inch mark. This is not where it will hang from, so you will need to determine where to place the hangers.\n\nThe first step is to measure 57 inches from the floor and mark it on the wall. Next, find the focal point of the artwork by measuring its height and dividing by two. In this case, the Mouly and its frame are 34 inches tall, making its focal point 17 inches.\n\nMeasure the top of the artwork to the tightened hanging wire or hook it will hang from. Subtract this number from the focal point number. For the Mouly, the hanging wire is 10 inches from the top of the frame. We subtract 10 inches from 17 inches to get 7 inches.\n\nTake the new number and measure that distance above the 57-inch mark. This is where the hanger should be placed, so mark this spot. With the Mouly, it would be 7 inches above the 57-inch mark, meaning the artwork will actually hang 64 inches from the floor. By doing so, artwork’s center will be at 57 inches.\n\n2. Adjust Rule #1 When Hanging Art Close to Furniture or Mantles\n\nWhen hanging artwork above furniture, mantles, or other obstructions, the eye level rule doesn’t always apply.\n\nThe bottom of the frame should be between six to eight inches above the top of the feature. In these cases, it’s acceptable to go higher than the 57-inch guideline if need be.\n\nThe artwork should also relate space-wise to furniture, meaning a small work of art hanging six inches above a long couch won’t look right. However, a large work of art or multiple works would look great.\n\n3. Treat Multiple Works of Art as One Unit\n\nWhen hanging multiple works of art, treat each work in the collection as if it were one work of art. Anchoring multiple works around the 57-inch focal point will help the collection appear balanced. The ideal spacing between multiple artworks is 3 to 6 inches.\n\nThe 57-inch number is a good average height, but if your eye level is different, be sure to use that measurement when hanging art. Every scenario is different, so at the end of the day, make sure you love the way your art is displayed.\n\nLEARN MORE TIPS FOR HOW TO HANG ART:\n\n6 Tips for Hanging Art\n\n7 Ways to Display Art\n\nA How-To Guide for Displaying Sculptures\n\nIf you’re interesting in building up your own art collection—or if you’re just sick of staring at blank walls—register for our weekly live online auction.
