        "text": "Overview\n\nThis guide will explain how to handle Batch Mixes in the online inventory system. A batch mix is the combination of items used as ingredients, to create something new.\n\nUsing a batch mix you can take different items and mix them together to create a single item for sale such as frozen drink mixes. A batch mix can be either Counted or Weighed and will appear on your handheld as a unique item.\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\nStep-by-Step\n\nAdd Name\n\nWhen Defining your Batch Mix, be aware that this name will not auto-populate similar to how ingredients do. This new name should be unique to your items. Please remember your New Batch Mix is a combination of items that already exist within your inventory.\n\nNOTE:\n\nBarcode is optional, if your recipe has either a custom barcode or unique identifying number, please place it here. You can also do this after creating the item.\n\nAdd Ingredients\n\nAfter naming your new batch mix, please identify the measurable ingredients which are taken into account during an audit.\n\nEach ingredient MUST already exist as an individual inventory item prior to this step. Each “Enter Ingredient” section will automatically pull information, which you have defined in Item Setup, and place it all here.\n\nIt is essential you select the correct ingredient which is auto-populated otherwise you will not be able to progress forward.\n\nCount vs. Count & Weigh\n\nCount Only:\n\nWill this batch mix only be counted during an audit? An example of a batch mix in which the final product is only counted could be a jello shot.\n\nCount & Weigh:\n\nWill this batch mix result in an item that is both counted and weighed during an audit?\n\nIf you chose count and weight, you will need to define total weight, empty container weight, and recipe form (ie. Solid / Liquid) in Step 5.\n\nDefine Unit\n\nUnit Definition requires you to identify the Batch Mix’s “Full Unit” definition.\n\nWill this item be defined as a serving? Portion, unit, or batch?\n\nFixed Size or Weight\n\nIf you chose Count Only for this Batch Mix, your step 5 will appear as below:\n\nYou will need to define the batch mix’s size as fixed or not. Fixed means that each batch mix’s final product has a specific size outcome. ie. each shot is 3.5oz\n\nIf you chose the Count & Weigh option for this batch mix, your step 5 will appear as below:\n\nYou will need to identify the batch mix’s OVERALL total weight and if it is a liquid or solid. If the recipe is a liquid, you must define the volume for the calculation of density.\n\nSummary & Save\n\nBy pressing “SAVE” you will have completed and added this batch mix to your inventory.\n\nTips\n\nMultiple Size Containers\n\nBatch mixes are usually found in multiple-size containers. Large buckets in the walk-in and smaller bottles at the bar.\n\nWhen creating batch mixes, create the large size batch first and label it appropriately in the name.\n\nFor the smaller size batch container, use the large batch as the ingredient by adding it in the item field and choosing the size of the container.\n\nNote:\n\nWhen creating your sales and drink mix item, that you use the “large” version of the batch mix in the ingredient. If you use the small batch it will cause a large and incorrect overage on the variance report\n\nIndividual Sales Batches\n\nBatch Mixes that are Bottled for Individual Sale\n\nIf your client has a Batch Mix they wish to create and bottle for individual bottle sales, users should need to determine the number of bottles they plan on bottling per batch.\n\nSo, hypothetically, a batch of Eff Cucumber, Lime Juice, Ginger Beer, Ginger Ale, and Simple Syrup comes out to a volume of 445.23 oz. From this Batch, they bottle 72 individual bottles and sell the bottles one by one.\n\nThis can be accomplished and accounted for by creating another batch item using the original batch item as an ingredient and specifying 1/72 = 0.01388888888 as the ingredient quantity.\n\nLarge Batch Mixes\n\nThe best method of accounting for huge batches that must be measured rather than weighed (because they are too heavy to weigh) is described within this guide. Some of our clients make up batches in huge garbage pails that are too heavy. For those batches, we must use a tape measure and enter the height of the batch (in centimeters) into the open bottles.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\nSteps to Follow\n\nFirst, we need to figure out the volume of the cylinder. This formula gives us the number of cubic centimeters: ([Pi x Radius (cm) x Radius (cm) ] x height). Since cubic centimeters are the same as milliliters, we need to multiply this by 0.033814 to get US ounces (or x 0.0351951 to get imperial ounces for Canadians).\n\nThen we figure out how much of each brand of liquor is in that cylinder when it is full. The easiest way to do that is to know the ratio of each liquor to their total liquid. For example, say they make up batches of 100 oz, of which 10 oz is Tequila and 3 oz is Triple Sec and the other 87 oz is non-alcoholic mix. If their huge garbage pail holds 1000 oz, then we know that 100 oz of it is Tequila and 30 oz of it is Triple Sec.\n\nIn Bevinco, we go to Drink Mix recipes and we set up a Batch Recipe. In the top part, we enter the brands of liquor and the amount that is in a full batch garbage pail (in the example above, we would fill the ingredients in as 100 oz of tequila + 30 oz of Triple Sec).\n\nIn the bottom part, we would enter the Total batch quantity (oz) as the # of ounces that fits into the batch cylinder from #1. In our example, we would enter 1000 oz.\n\nThe Full batch weight would be the height of the container (in centimeters) multiplied by 10. It is important that it is multiplied by 10. So if the garbage pail is 50 centimeters tall, then we would enter 500 as the Full Batch weight.\n\nThe Drink pour quantity should be the # of ounces of the batch that the bar pours into a glass.\n\nThe Empty batch weight should be zero.\n\nNow when the Bevinco auditor measures that batch, all s/he needs to do is to measure the height in centimeters, then multiply that height by 10 and enter the result into open bottles. For example, if the garbage pail is filled to 15 cm, then the auditor enters 150 as the batch weight in open bottles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe reason we need to multiply by 10 in steps #5 and #8, is so that system will show usage of there is only 2 or 3 centimeters used from last week to this week. We need to do this in order to circumvent the open bottle feature whereby the system shows zero usage for items where the weight differs by less than 3 grams.\n\nExample Batch\n\nThe following is an example of the aforementioned steps needed to build a Batch Mix\n\nThis batch mix is for a Red Sangria with the following ingredients:\n\nMerlot Vista – 3 Bottles\n\nBlackBerry Brandy – 1 Bottle\n\nTriple Sec – 12.8oz\n\nFull Batch Weight : 3839g\n\nTotal Batch Volume: 128oz\n\nEmpty Batch Weight : 116g\n\nDrink Mix : 6oz\n\nStep 1: Batch Mix Name\n\nStep 2: Adding Ingredients\n\nMerlot Vista – 3 Bottles\n\nBlackBerry Brandy – 1 Bottle\n\nTriple Sec – 12.8oz\n\nNote:\n\nIt is important to assign the correct Unit of measure. These measurements are drawn from the Items Setup and Pour Sizes\n\nStep 3: Count / Weigh\n\nCount & Weigh will allow you to weigh the Mix and identify the total servings available.\n\nStep 4: Batch Unit Definition\n\nThe Batch Mix will need to be defined as its total grouping of the individual items\n\nStep 5: Weights & Form\n\nFull Batch Weight : 3839g\n\nTotal Batch Volume: 128oz\n\nEmpty Batch Weight : 116g\n\nStep 6: Summary\n\nThis is an overview of all of the information a user has an input for this batch mix.\n\nStep 7: Adding Batch Mix to Drink Mix (Navigate to Sales & Drink Mix)\n\nStep 8: Identify Drink Mix Details\n\nThe Drink Mix will need ingredients. In this case, the “ingredient” is the batch mix.\n\nA user then can define the Quantity of Red Sangria to be 6oz, as defined by the Drink Mix specifications\n\nStep 9: Adding Prices\n\nDefining Pricing for different price levels is available in this step. Each Price Level is propagated from the Price Level Setup section.\n\nA user can also overwrite all Sales Taxes using the Universal Sales Tax feature\n\nStep 10: Save\n\nAfter Saving, a quick search will draw the item up as seen below."
