        "text": "Blackcurrants crop best in a sunny location but will also do well in light shade\n\nBlackcurrants are easy to grow, producing a delicious summer harvest with little upkeep required. These shrubs usually grow to about 1.5m (5ft) tall and wide, with 6–10 upright stems arising from the base. More compact varieties can be grown in a large container, at least for a few years, although they’ll fare better in the ground. Another space-saving option is to buy a standard-trained blackcurrant, shaped like a lollipop, on a single, tall stem.\n\nBlackcurrants like a sunny spot, but will tolerate a little shade. They’re generally robust, healthy and trouble free, and once established need little attention apart from pruning annually in winter, which is a quick and simple process that will keep them cropping well for many years. Also, be sure to protect the ripening fruits from birds.\n\nDifferent varieties offer a choice of harvesting times, flavours and crop sizes\n\nThere are many excellent blackcurrant varieties to choose from. Modern varieties have been bred to flower later, so are a better choice in cold locations, as frost at flowering time can lead to poor fruiting. Their currants are often larger too, and many are resistant to problems such as mildew and big bud mite. Modern varieties such as ‘Ben Connan’,‘Ben Hope’ and ‘Big Ben’ also have the advantage that most of the currants in a cluster ripen at the same time, so you can simply pick the whole bunch. With older varieties, individual currants usually ripen at different times, so must be picked singly, which is more fiddly and time-consuming.\n\nIf you have space to grow several plants, select varieties that fruit from early to late season, to provide harvests for most of the summer. Look in particular for varieties with an RHS Award of Garden Merit (AGM), which shows they performed well in trials, so should crop reliably – download ourlist of AGM fruit and veg.\n\nProtecting\n\nProtecting flowers from frost\n\nIf frost is forecast while blackcurrants are in flower, cover bushes overnight with fleece or hessian, raised up on canes, then remove in the morning to allow pollinators access to the flowers.\n\nProtecting fruit from birds\n\nGrow blackcurrants in a fruit cage to protect the crop from birds\n\nAs soon as the currants start to ripen, consider putting netting over your plants, otherwise your precious crop may soon disappear. Make sure the netting is taut, so birds don’t get tangled in it. Alternatively, build a temporary or permanent fruit cage.\n\nBlackcurrants fruit best on strong, young growth made in the previous few years, so the aim of pruning is to remove several of the oldest, least productive stems each year and encourage new ones to sprout from the base. Done annually, this will create a constant supply of new stems, for maximum harvests. Blackcurrants are usually grown as multi-stemmed bushes, with an open structure of 6–10 upright stems growing from the base.\n\nEstablished bushes (aged four years or older) are best pruned every winter to keep them fruiting strongly. This is a simple process – cut out up to a third of the oldest stems down at the base. These are easy to distinguish, as they are darker in colour and thicker – and usually require loppers or a pruning saw to cut them cleanly. Cut just above an outward-facing bud, if you can see one. Removing these older, less productive stems encourages new ones to sprout from the base, which will fruit well for several years, until they in turn become less productive and should be removed.\n\nYounger blackcurrant bushes need slightly different treatment:\n\nNewly bought blackcurrants – if planted while dormant (from autumn to early spring), prune these straight after planting. Be brave and cut all the stems down to 2.5cm (1in) above soil level. This may seem drastic, and means you won’t get fruit in the first year, but it will give you a better plant in the long term, encouraging more stems to sprout from the base\n\nIn the first three years after planting – if growth is strong, give young blackcurrant bushes just a light prune in autumn or winter to remove any weak or low-lying shoots. But if growth is weak, prune hard, cutting at least half the shoots down to the base, to stimulate more new stems to grow"
