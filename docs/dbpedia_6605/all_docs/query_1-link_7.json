Your team will explore gothic locations, hunt clues, discover artefacts and face off against terrifying foes.\n\nThe Hellboy universe is vast. Absolutely vast. It spans, well, a whole universe. From the icy depths of dimensionless space where the ancient elder beings, the Ogdru Jahad, wait eager to return, to the wintry tracts of a Russia preserved in Baba Yaga’s dream. It contains an entirely new and secret history of the world, preserved in a lost language. It’s a universe filled with magic, with arcane science, with Nazis who need punching and with characters who are always that little bit more than you expect them to be. It’s a universe of stories. And with this RPG, you get to tell your own."
