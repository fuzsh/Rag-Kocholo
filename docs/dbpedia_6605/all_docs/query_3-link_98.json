        "text": "It is with a heavy heart that today we announce that NightFall will not continue development. While we have been pushing for a release for nearly 6 months now, the team has unfortunately lacked the drive, motivation and dedication to complete our work.\n\nNightFall has had a very interesting history - for those of you that followed the mod, you will know that we had alot of ups and downs. This rollercoaster ride, especially the downs, have affected the team more than we possibly expected, and as a result the mod is not what we wanted it to be today.\n\nTo all the fans out there who followed us throughout our development, we thank you for your support throughout the years. From a humble map-pack to a full-blown total conversion, NightFall was a learning experience for every one of us on the development team. We all leave it with very few regrets, knowing that we are both better modders and better people as a result of the time we spent working together."
