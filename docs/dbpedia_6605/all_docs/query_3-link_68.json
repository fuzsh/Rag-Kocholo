League of Legends and H1Z1 - King of the Kill.\n\nThey randomly start to go up from 56ms to something like 500ms and sometimes slightly above 1000ms. Makes game pretty unplayable when your character starts to teleport around. Been searching for solutions over the internet, but without the right one, so I'd think some tech wizards here could give me a hand.\n\nI use Windows 10. Just recently bought new PC.\n\nPS: My browser and other things works fine.\n\n\"Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years, power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I can not respect someone who does not see the difference.\" RE: High ping spikes in online games\n\nWindows 10 does automatic windows update without even telling you.\n\nIt sends a lot of (personal) data of Microsoft as well.\n\nIf you have a crap internet like mine (3MB), you're screwed.\n\nThough there are some tools that might help you to desactivate those unwanted operations.\n\nOnce I'm back home, I'll send you some procedures and software to fix that\n\nWell, this is what I advice you to do :\n\n1-Deactivate everything in the Windows 10 Settings/Privacy\n\n-Head to Settings > Privacy, and disable everything, unless there are some things you really need.\n\n-While within the Privacy page, go to Feedback, select Never in the first box, and Basic in the second box.\n\n-Head to Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Choose how updates are delivered, and turn the first switch off.\n\n-Disable Cortana by clicking the Search bar/icon.\n\n-(Optional) Disable web search in Search by going to Settings, and turning off Search online and include web results.\n\nI personally unchecked everything because it's all useless to me.\n\n2-Download DoNotSpy10-1.1.0.0-Setup (or any higher version) :\n\nDL link : here\n\nYou can disable the following:\n\nDisable Telemetry\n\nDisable Biometrics\n\nDisable Handwriting\n\nData Sharing\n\nDisable Handwriting Error Reporting\n\nDisable Application Telemetry\n\nDisable Inventory Collector\n\nDisable Steps Recorder\n\nDisable enabling Lock Screen Camera\n\nDisable and Reset Cortana\n\nDisable Location\n\nDisable Sensors\n\nDisable Web Search\n\nDisable Windows Media DRM Internet Access Defer Windows Upgrades\n\nDisable App Notifications\n\nDisable Password Reveal Button\n\nDisable and Reset Advertising ID\n\nDisable SmartScreen Filter for URLs\n\nDisable Sending Writing Info\n\nDisable Access to Language List\n\nDisable App Access to Location Info\n\nDisable App Access to Camera\n\nDisable App Access to Microphone\n\nDisable Getting to know me\n\nDisable App Access to Account Info\n\nDisable App Access to Calendar\n\nDisable App Access to Messages\n\nDisable App Access to Radios\n\nDisable Sync With Devices\n\nDisable Windows Feedback Requests\n\nDisable Windows Update Sharing\n\nDisable Windows Update for other Products\n\nDisable WiFi Sense\n\nDisable Windows Defender\n\nDisable Automatic Windows Updates\n\nDisable OneDrive\n\nDisable Automatic Driver Update\n\nRead more : here\n\n3- Download dwt-3.0.1-cp27-win_x86 (Distable Win Tracking) (3.0.1 or any higher version)\n\nDL Link 1 : here\n\nor\n\nDL Link 2 : here\n\nDownload dwt-x.x-cp27-win_x86.zip below\n\nExtract the files in any directory.\n\nRight click on DisableWinTracking.exe and press Run as administrataor\n\nChoose any/all of the options you'd like\n\nSelect either \"Privacy\" to enable the tweaks, or \"Revert\" to revert them.\n\nYou can read the output in the console dialog to see if it worked.\n\nRead more : here\n\n4-Stop watching horse porn\n\nThere you go lehma ^^ That should help"
