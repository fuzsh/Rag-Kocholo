        "text": "Dark Souls: Nightfall is the giant new Dark Souls mod Iâ€™m working on with an incredible team including AinTunez, Meowmaritus, Dane Brennand, geeeeeorge, horkrux, Zullie the Witch, Stayd, Itzli, Dropoff, Mayhem, Souv, and others.\n\nThe demo of Nightfall is now available! Download version 1.2 directly here. We will be uploading to Nexus Mods soon.\n\nAinTunez and I started sketching the outline for Nightfall in 2019, and spent 2020 assembling the team and piecing together the core components. We released a preview of the first 18 minutes of the game in February 2021.\n\nWe were originally targeting a release date of December 21, 2021, and then January 21, 2022, but after events at the end of last year, we decided to instead focus on releasing a demo on January 21 and delaying the full release until after Elden Ring. (We wonâ€™t announce a new full release date until weâ€™ve moved into strictly QA.) Watch the original full release date teaser here, and our release date update teaser here.\n\nNightfall is a direct fan-made sequel to Dark Souls, with a new story, new characters and bosses, new world map (built mostly from the existing pieces), and much more. Itâ€™s basically a brand new Souls game built using the Dark Souls engine and assets. Combat will be faster-paced, against a mixture of familiar and unfamiliar foes, with brand new voiced NPCs and side-quests. Nightfall also takes many cues from the design of Majoraâ€™s Mask, one of my favorite games.\n\nWeâ€™re naturally trying not to spoil too much ahead of release, but if you want to see more previews of Nightfall, you can follow me on Twitter. If you want to support my work on the project, you can also join me on Patreon, where I share extra previews and other goodies ðŸ™‚\n\nWe likely wonâ€™t be releasing any more long gameplay previews before release (spoilers!), but a few character, boss, and map previews are sure to come! Stay tuned.\n\n~ Grim"
