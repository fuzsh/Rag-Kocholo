        "text": "Young gamers can now transport themselves inside the world of Doctor Who in the BBC’s online multiplayer game Nightfall.\n\nUntil Tuesday 29 September, REM Zone 2 of Nightfall is transformed into a Doctor Who dreamworld. Nightfallers must work together to keep the Doctor’s infamous villains – the Daleks – at bay.\n\nThe free-to-play game gives players the chance to claim new outfits and style their Nightfaller as Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor, or as one of the Doctor’s long-standing enemies, the Cybermen. Once they’ve unlocked the outfits, they’ll be able to keep them forever.\n\nIn Nightfall, players control a version of themselves that exists in their dreams – a Nightfaller. Their purpose: to work with other Nightfallers and defend the Dream from Nightmares, made up of worries from the waking world.\n\nThe Doctor Who takeover of REM Zone 2 is one of five REM zones available within the game, hosting up to 20 players across them at a time. Nightfall is being continuously updated and this time-limited feature is the latest in a series of collaborations with BBC brands, with more coming soon."
