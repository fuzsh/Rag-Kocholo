        "text": "PC\n\nThanks to /u/depreciated_ on reddit for their solution:\n\nRun the following script in Powershell (run as Administrator):\n\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-1\" -Direction Outbound -LocalPort 1935,3097,3478-3480 -Protocol TCP -Action Block New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-2\" -Direction Outbound -LocalPort 1935,3097,3478-3480 -Protocol UDP -Action Block New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-3\" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 1935,3097,3478-3480 -Protocol TCP -Action Block New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-4\" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 1935,3097,3478-3480 -Protocol UDP -Action Block Write-Host \"Destiny 2 Solo mode activated. Press ctl + c to deactivate solo mode.\"\n\nAnd then run the following when you are done:\n\nRead-Host Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-1\" Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-2\" Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-3\" Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Destiny2-Solo-4\"\n\nThis will force the game to block specific network ports, preventing other guardians from joining up in your fireteam. Do note as mentioned in his post that the script needs to be run while your ship is fully in orbit, before starting \"matchmaking\". After a few minutes, the game will automatically start the strike regardless if others join your team (in this case, won't happen), and you'll be free to play any Strikes solo! This applies to both Nightfall strikes, Nightfall: The Ordeal, any strikes in the Vanguard playlists, or Strikes started manually from each planet's map.\n\nPS4\n\nYou can set your time back, preferably 1 hour. This prevents others from matching with you, and you can solo strikes this way. Don't forget to switch your system clock back to normal if you want to play with others again.\n\nThink of fireteams as a persistent group or party that stays together through missions, whereas matchmaking is temporary and will disband when the activity is completed.\n\nFireteam settings only change who can('t) join your persistent group. On the other hand matchmaking will stick you with other players to fill out your group for example, during a strike, after which you will be disbanded. Matchmaking will happen regardless of fireteam settings.\n\nThere have been posts stating that changing your system time on PS4 will stop you from being matchamde with anyone else. I have not seen any posts of it being tried on PC, nor have I done it myself, but it is an option."
