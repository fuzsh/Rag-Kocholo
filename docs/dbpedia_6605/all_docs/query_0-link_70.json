        "text": "Grandmaster Nightfalls are perhaps the most challenging endgame activity in Destiny 2. With an insane Power Level requirement and unforgiving modifiers, Grandmaster Nightfalls will challenge all but the top Fireteams out there.\n\nThis page will provide everything you need to tackle them: their rotation, Champions, and detailed guides.\n\nGM this Week: August 16, 2024\n\nThis week’s Adept Nightfall weapon is the Undercurrent (Grenade Launcher). We cover the most sought-after Undercurrent God Rolls here.\n\nAs with most things in Destiny 2, Grandmaster Nightfalls are on a weekly rotation. For the sake of clarity, the week officially resets on Tuesdays at 10 AM PDT.\n\nGrandmaster Nightfalls in Episode 1:\n\nThe Glassway\n\nWarden of Nothing\n\nThe Disgraced\n\nFallen S.A.B.E.R\n\nLiminality\n\nExodus Crash\n\nPsiOps Battleground: Cosmodrome\n\nThe Insight Terminus\n\nThe Devil’s Lair\n\nGrandmaster Nightfall rotation\n\nGrandmaster Nightfalls are not available for the entire Episode. Given their onerous level requirements, they become available a few weeks after the start of a Season/Episode. In Episode 1: Echoes, GMs became available on June 25, 2023 (Week 3):\n\n📅 GM rotation: Episode 1\n\nWeekNightfallLocationEventsWeek # 4 June 2024The GlasswayEuropaAct 1Week 1 11 June 2024Warden of NothingDreaming City-Week 2 18 June 2024The DisgracedCosmodrome-Week 3 25 June 2024The GlasswayEuropa-Week 4 2 July 2024Warden of NothingDreaming City-Week 5 9 July 2024The DisgracedCosmodrome-Week 6 16 July 2024Act 2Week 7 23 July 2024-Week 8 30 July 2024-Week 9 6 August 2024-Week 10 13 August 2024-Week 11 20 August 2024-Week 12 27 August 2024Act 3Week 13 3 September 2024-Week 14 10 September 2024-Week 15 17 September 2024-Week 16 24 September 2024-Week 17 1 October 2024-Week 18\n\nGrandmaster rewards\n\nThere’s a reason why Nightfalls are such a popular activity in Destiny 2. While they can certainly be fun and challenging, most Guardians tackle GMs every week for a chance to earn Adept weapons and Masterworking materials.\n\nAdept Nightfall weapons\n\nThere are many Nightfall-specific weapons, but only 6 are on a weekly rotation. These can drop from completing Nightfalls on any difficulty; however, completing Grandmaster Nightfalls rewards you with adept versions of these weapons.\n\nYou can read all about Nightfall weapons, including adept versions, drop rates, and rankings, here.\n\nGrandmaster Power Level Requirements\n\nIf you’re interested in running a GM, you need to have a proper Power Level (including your Artifact’s bonus Power):\n\nDifficulty Recommended Enemies Power Level Adept drop rate Grandmaster TBC TBC Common+\n\nFor the record, Power Level requirements were drastically reduced last season to allow more players to experience Grandmaster Nightfalls.\n\nGM Shields & Champions\n\nGrandmaster Nightfalls are challenging activities, even for veteran players.\n\nBut regardless of your skills, you need to make sure you bring weapons with matching elements and armor with the necessary Champions mods:\n\nArtNightfallThreatShieldsChampionsRequires Lake of Shadows Arc Void\n\nSolar\n\nArc8x Barrier\n\n8x Unstoppable\n\nFree-to-Play The Corrupted Arc14x Arc\n\n28x Void\n\n20x Solar8x Overload\n\n10x Unstoppable\n\nFree-to-Play Battleground - Moon Void Void\n\nSolar\n\nArc Barrier\n\nUnstoppable\n\nFree-to-Play Battleground - Cosmodrome Arc Arc\n\nVoid\n\nSolar Barrier\n\nUnstoppable\n\nFree-to-Play Birthplace of the Vile Void5x Void\n\n(2x Random Shields)12x Overload\n\n8x Unstoppable\n\nThe Witch Queen Hypernet Current Arc Void\n\nSolar\n\nArc Overload\n\nUnstoppable\n\nLightfall\n\nBefore you go…\n\nPreparing to farm Grandmaster Nightfalls?
