        "text": "I say, we need a pony games subforum!\n\nAnyway, hello there, guys! I'm Night Breeze from Silly Mare Games, creator of a few previous games like Stroll, My Little Rhythm and Harmony PCG, and I'm glad to share with y'all a new project I've been working in for some time now: SMG's Nightfall.\n\nNightfall is a 2D platforming game, but it's not the usual idea of a platformer. You can think about it as a mix of Terraria or Minecraft and a tower defense game, if you may, but it's still not quite like that either. I'll give you a quick description (and I excuse myself beforehand, as english isn't my main language).\n\nIn this game, the main objective so far is to survive. You play as any of the mane six in a huge randomly generated world, and along the day you may explore, collect items and build yourself a fortress with many different type of blocks, being dirt, stone, different kinds of turrets, trees, and the like. After 5 real-life minutes, the night comes, and the peaceful ambience of the game goes away. A swarm of enemies will try to get you, destroying everything along the way. You'll have to survive until the sun rises again, by killing the enemies, strategically building your fortress and using the different blocks, collecting money to upgrade your stats, and more. Each night that comes, the enemies will be harder and more frequent, featuring even bosses along the way, and you'll have to strategically develop your character and building stats along it to survive.\n\nAnyway, that's mainly it! The game is still under development, everything is subject to change, and I'd love to know what you think.\n\nHere are a couple teaser videos I've uploaded about the project for you to check out (they look really little in here for some reason!):\n\nAnd an updated post I wrote a few minutes ago if you'd like to read further:\n\nhttp://sillymaregames.blogspot.com/2013/06/nightfall-lots-of-updates.html\n\nThanks a lot for your time, and I hope you have a great day!"
