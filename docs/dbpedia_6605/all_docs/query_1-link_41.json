        "text": "Nightfall needs changes.\n\nI have been loving this game so much, and I'll most likely make more of these in-depth suggestions. The first thing I talk about has to be nightfall, as I love survival games and the thrill of nighttime. Abiotic Factor is on the right path, but there are some glaring issues that make nighttime more of an annoyance and less of an experience.\n\nThe transition between day and night is amazing, especially the announcement one hour prior to the lights switching off. It gives you the feeling of impending doom, especially if you're deep into the facility and lost. However, there is no doom, nothing happens. Slightly more enemies and underwhelming robots.\n\nNightfall should be challenging and nerve-wracking. Once the clock hits 8, you should feel the urgency to getting back, knowing you might risk your life by staying out. You should feel nervous seeing the clock tick down, waiting to go out on your first nighttime expedition. Right now, the only downside to nightfall is the occasional raid and the power going off, which isn't even a huge deal late game.\n\nFirstly, the duration of the night is EXTREMELY short. Those who don't want to deal with nighttime can just sleep. but many people, including me, enjoy the thrill and risk of venturing out in the dark.\n\nNo significant threat. Enemy wise, night and day are the exact same. The only noticeable difference being the robots. Which are an amazing concept and fit the atmosphere really well. But right now, they are VERY underwhelming. Especially the security bots in the office sector, as they're slow and sluggish. Sure, they are hard to kill early on, but they're barely a threat due to how slow they move.\n\nTo fix this, there are a few things we could do. The first option is to make the security bots more threatening, and we can do that by making them run at you like the containment bots. Which would be a lot more challenging and overall make the nights a lot more interesting. To balance this, they should have a shorter line of sight and potentially lose you after some time. And when it becomes daytime, they become passive and return to their chargers. Right now, they stick around, which could be problematic considering these changes.\n\nThe second option is to keep robots as they are but add nocturnal entities--dangerous ones. You can do A LOT with this, for example. A nighthunter that relies on sound, forcing you to sneak around. If it finds you it'll chase you downâ€”killable, but challenging, and ofcourse, extremely rewarding. Or multiple blind entities that you have to sneak around; if you alert one of them, they will alert the others, and they will all come chasing you down. You get the point; you can do a lot.\n\nI have more idea's but I'll leave the rest up to you guys, this game keeps impressing me and I can't wait to see Abiotic Fact, goodluck!"
