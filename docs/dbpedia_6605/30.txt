Hi Ronnie here! We are very proud and excited to announce we will be working Nightfall Games to get the ‘Hellboy RPG’ out into the wider roleplaying games community.

Nightfall Games will be hosting the PDFs on their DriveThruRPG site and will be at Dragonmeet 2022 showing off the new book and peripherals.

As part of the launch they will be offering the digital ‘Hellboy RPG bundle’ which will include new products and each and every one of the Nightfall Games QuickStart PDFs (The Terminator RPG, SLA Industries, SINS RPG, Demon Dog and Devil’s Run RPG).

Nightfall Games will also be working with Mantic on some new Hellboy RPG products, which include the upcoming ‘Korhonen’ series of interconnected B.P.R.D cases written by Benn Graybeaton alongside previous and new ‘Hellboy RPG’ contributors. Get the first of these cases, ‘Cannister 7’ on DriveThruRPG soon.

“I have long been an admirer of Mantic Games, their people and products and a long time fan of everything Hellboy. To be able to be part of getting ‘Hellboy RPG’ out to the roleplaying community is a great honour for Nightfall Games.” – Mark Rapson, Managing Director. Nightfall Games

‘To be able to work on new content for ‘Hellboy RPG’ has been a dream come true. It is good to be able to work both with original contributors and new ones and to do so from my position within Nightfall Games.” – Benn Graybeaton, Director of Projects. Nightfall Games
