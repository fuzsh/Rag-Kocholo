Created initially during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this ragtag collection of pieces, all SLA Industries orientated, should be considered the second issue of a 36-page SLA Industries magazine.

Within this document you will find two short pieces of fiction, a new Cannibal threat with four BPN ideas, ten BPN recipes, some Cannibal Sector fun and a stand-alone Shiver Print & Play game.
