James Toback’s first feature, “Fingers,” from 1978 (which I discuss in this clip), got a well-deserved rave review in this magazine from Pauline Kael at the time of its release. She emphasizes “the wild self-dramatization that one associates with the young Tennessee Williams, or with Mailer when he gets high on excess,” adding that “There’s almost a swagger in the way [Toback] consciously goes beyond the rationally acceptable; he’s looking for art in that beyond, wanting the unknown—the dangerous—to take over.” She also praises the way that Toback films the story. What she doesn’t do is connect Toback’s “avidity for filmmaking” with the characters’ furious behavior. “Fingers” (remade, in 2005, as the overheated, underimagined French drama “The Beat That My Heart Skipped”) is a real classical-music movie; the fingers in question, belonging to Harvey Keitel and the character that he plays, Jimmy Angelelli, play Bach at the piano and pull the trigger of a gun. There, as in Toback’s third feature, “Exposed” (which played at Film Society of Lincoln Center last weekend), a refined musician of extraordinary sensibility is also a man making his way in a violent milieu. The subject of the movie—and, perhaps, the core of Toback’s career—is the connection between the two: in effect, the Apollonian mask that threatens to crack. Toback turned seventy on Nov. 23rd; he hasn’t made as many features as a director of his singular and original artistry should have made, and his most recent film, “Seduced and Abandoned,” is a personal documentary about his difficulty raising money for a new film. I hope that he keeps on making films, nonetheless, and also that he writes his autobiography.
