        "text": "Imagine you are walking down your local high street and you pass one of those stores that sells pop-culture models, collectables and memorabilia. Today a clearing has been made amidst the figurines in the window and an item is being specially showcased. You have the window to yourself and so you can stop to study it.\n\nAt first you see that it is a diorama and next you are marvelling over its flair and the extent of its workmanship. There are some figures wrestling and it looks to be a scene from an action movie, albeit one that you don’t immediately recognise. One of the models is the very spit of Steven Seagal though.\n\nThere is no price tag attached to the diorama. Conscious of how quiet the street behind you is, you wonder whether it could be a lucky find. Your mind tries to scramble over its significance. It looks like something that could be of great value one day. But you cannot place the movie and soon you have turned and bidden a definite farewell to the object. There will be some fan of Seagal’s out there who it will mean more to.\n\nI hope I have gotten across that the objects that are produced in Bobby Fingers’ YouTube videos confound any attempt to put a value on them. In truth, the transaction that is undertaken with them is the opposite as occurs in commodity fetishism. The labour that produces the objects is always intoxicatingly glamorous. If they were ever separated from it, as the leather boot has to affect a total memory loss of the factory where it was made, then they would become suddenly trivial or rather unfathomable in themselves. The whole point of Bobby Fingers’ videos is to indeed trumpet the delivery process rather than the end product. Whatever package is out for delivery is by the by but what is always carrying it along is this spectacular, zigzagging musical juggernaut.\n\nBobby Fingers is probably not really a person. There is a story going on in his videos in which he is this gruffly deadpan modelmaker who is sharing his project with you. Many of the people commenting below the videos are clearly drawn to his arts-and-crafts virtuosity, or to the picture of his skills expanding in all directions from the epicentre of his workshop. One minute he is reciting a wonderful monologue and the next he is absorbed in his craftsmanship and then he tyrannising the outskirts of his project in the guise of a Dadaist sorcerer and finally he is singing and dancing.\n\nOn Reddit several people have outed Bobby Fingers as a member of the Limerick musical-comedy troupe the Rubberbandits. Maybe this individual is on top of every aspect of Bobby Fingers but his videos also involve a complex partnership with a commercial modelmaking studio.\n\nOdyssey Studios are based in Limerick and they are elsewhere at home deep in the details of films such as The Hobbit. Whenever Bobby Fingers needs a bit of help, he will casually head across to them, to borrow their 3D printer. The joke in each video is that we are being given an in-depth, step-by-step guide to building an item that nobody could ever possibly want. Part of the joke is that somebody who is trying to follow this guide cannot just wander into Odyssey Studios to use their equipment. But we might increasingly suspect that Odyssey are not merely a resource and that their expertise and personnel are somehow all at large within the overall entity that is Bobby Fingers.\n\nBobby Fingers reminds me a bit of OwlKitty, a YouTube channel of a similar standout quality but one whose co-founder, Tibo Charroppin, had previously created content for HBO and Netflix. Does Bobby Fingers give expression to the familiar democratic amateurism of YouTube or is something on a more cinematic scale intruding? Or does this channel ultimately belong in an uncertain area between the democratic and the exclusive?\n\nI think that the satire is operating at the expense of both the original hayseed of YouTube and the corporate world that Odyssey has to service. And so Bobby Fingers is constantly demanding money on Patreon only to then, in his latest video, apparently splurge it all on a (single)hair-transplanting spree in Türkiye. On the other front, the exuberance of this channel’s creativity may act as a kind of relief for Odyssey. If you spend weeks making a model and it then appears briefly in some soulless action-adventure movie, an element of revenge must creep in when the final product is instead a diorama of Mel Gibson being arrested for drunk driving.\n\nThis was the first diorama and it was made in August 2022. In the second, Steven Seagal is being put in a (possibly-mostly-apocryphal) chokehold by the stuntsman Gene LeBell. The third depicts Michael Jackson with his hair on fire, an incident that had befallen him when he was filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. In the fourth and latest video, a “head boat” is now the totemic object. Bobby Fingers is carving out a rowing boat that is also, on its underside, a hyperrealistic portrait of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nThese four antiheros are all people who one might choose to protest against. Gibson for his anti-Semitism, Seagal and Jackson for their alleged sexual abuse and Bezos for his excesses as a mass employer. How do Bobby Fingers’ videos behave as a form of protest, or is this just the wrong way to go about looking at them?\n\nYou will have noticed that as the twenty-first century unfolds protest seems to develop into an ever more decadent and elitist artform. In the old days of socialist revolutions, a protest would see masses on the streets and an assertion of proletarian power. This imagery is admittedly referenced in “Jeff Bezos Rowing Boat,” when footage is included of unionising Amazon employees. But protests are now more likely to be miniature bourgeois events, involving puppetry, performance and the unconvincing figure of the semi-professional protestor.\n\nThis degradation of protest had appeared recently to culminate in the antics of Just Stop Oil. The slogans were apocalyptic, the visuals were thrilling and the practical politics were utterly unintelligible. I had wondered whether Bobby Fingers might be the next stage. Bezos is called “a massive dick.” Seagal is shown “shitting his pants,” even though Bobby Fingers otherwise concedes that this cherry on the chokehold had “never happened.” Jackson is “presumably in hell for fucking those kids… alleg-ed-leee.” And then there is this sing-song nautical fantasy in which Bezo is murdered by his employees.\n\nClearly this is abuse rather than satire, just as Just Stop Oil is delinquency rather than ever growing politically active. As a protest Bobby Fingers is infantile and only the maturity that is bestowed by his elite modelmaking gives ballast to the spinning boat, just as Just Stop Oil’s status as prophetic elites is needed to excuse and explain their childish public tantrums.\n\nYet I am not sure that Bobby Fingers is political in anything other than a passing sense. For example, the mutiny on the Amazon does not end with the unionised workers sailing off into a rosy sunset. For one thing, Bobby Fingers is shown scarpering with all their money. He buries it and posts coordinates for a viewer to find it, but it is dream money, lire that are left over from a hair transplant. Next there is a fluctuation in the delirium and Bobby Fingers is being interrogated in an admiral’s cabin that is morphing steadily back into the headquarters of Odyssey Studios. We are restored to Limerick’s Thatcherism, a macap world of fleecing eejits on Patreon and being fleeced in turn by the hair pirates of Türkiye.\n\nTo truly connect with Bobby Fingers you need to look through the beguiling surface and into the horror that is racing cold underneath. Ireland is a Catholic country, or a country that is still not quite conscious when it comes to modernity, and so this is naturally a theological horror.\n\nIn the diorama videos Mel Gibson, Steven Seagal and Michael Jackson are all as silent as voodoo dolls. They are only ever spoken about and their own voices are never heard. The events that are shown in the three dioramas must have been fleeting for the celebrities concerned and maybe not even remembered by them. These events had also gone on to have repercussions as enormous as Bobby Fingers’ own obsessive absorption in them becomes. Jackson’s burning had escalated his paranoia, Gibson had been blacklisted throughout Hollywood after his Jew-baiting, and the chokehold had plunged all of the teetering dignity of Seagal’s masculinity into a nightmarish crisis.\n\nIn an apparent laying to rest, these crises are buried at the end of each video. I am sure that Mel Gibson would love for all memory of his anti-Semitism to be buried somewhere “up a mountain, in County Kerry.” But coordinates are issued and a plucky viewer will go off on a cross-country hunt to dig the diorama up again, as if this little titbit of Gibson’s soul has been lost only for a while, purgatorially, on a blank landscape. The three men’s crises are something that they should be alone with, deep in the well of the night. Instead, they each come to be owned in model form by a perfect stranger. Imagine! – a moment of your deepest soul-horror – being chuckled over and ironically displayed on somebody’s mantelpiece!\n\nJust as Bobby Fingers’ own personhood contains multitudes of expertise, the celebrity that is shown within these dioramas is increasingly co-owned and decentralised. The boat is different, however, and the silencing and effacement of Jeff Bezos are more radical. Bobby Fingers insists that his subject is more boat to him than Bezos and that he had only selected the billionaire because he is bald. Bezos is reduced to a blank, brainless face that could be only ever seen by people drowning underneath it. His corporate shell can be nonetheless taken over by somebody with the correct entrepreneurial panache and used in smuggling operations.\n\nIn the UK, the “small boat” now haunts national politics, since thousands of migrants and refugees are crossing the English Channel in these micro-vessels. The current whereabouts of the Jeff Bezo boat are never stated at the end of Bobby Fingers’ video. The mould nonetheless means that it can be reproduced endlessly. The thrilling picture of a Hieronymus Bosch seascape in which thousands of refugees are rowing to freedom in the unseeing, upturned faces of a depersonalised billionaire."
