She'll be the girl of your dreams. 5'5', dark hair, blue eyes. She's wearing a dusty rose bikini and her name is Julie.\n\nJulie:\n\nWell, you made a mistake. I'm 5'6'.\n\nJimmy:\n\nI want it from you.\n\nJulie:\n\nWant what?\n\nJimmy:\n\nLove.\n\nJulie:\n\nWhy? Do you love me.\n\nJimmy:\n\nNo, I'm in love with a girl called Carol. I love your...\n\nJulie:\n\nMy what?\n\nJimmy:\n\nYour p*ssy.\n\nJulie:\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nJimmy:\n\nOf all the different kinds of p*ssy in the world; soft, hot, gravel, velvet, cold, wet, big, small, there's only one kind I can feel my blood on sight. And that's silk, which is yours."
