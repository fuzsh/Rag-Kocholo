        "text": "“The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T” (1953) was, and is, one of a kind — and the only feature-length live-action movie to have been conceived, written and designed by the illustrator Theodor Geisel (1904-1991), otherwise known as Dr. Seuss.\n\nThe film’s producer, Stanley Kramer, that most earnest of Hollywood liberals, never oversaw anything comparable to this extravagant Technicolor vision of a tyrannical piano teacher’s quest for world domination. Nor was any other anti-fascist musical children’s film expected to precipitate a merchandising bonanza. (It never happened.)\n\nA nightmare dreamed by a 10-year-old boy, Bart (Tommy Rettig, later of the TV show “Lassie”), “The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T,” now out on Blu-ray from Mill Creek, was both a film of its political moment and a pro-kid, anti-adult statement for the ages. It would make a perfect double bill with “Invaders From Mars,” William Cameron Menzies’ similarly hyperdesigned exercise in candy-colored Expressionism and paranoid fantasy, which had materialized several months earlier.\n\nIn both, parents are subject to external mind control, although, in “The 5,000 Fingers,” Bart’s widowed mother (the singer and TV personality Mary Healy) isn’t brainwashed by Martians but indoctrinated by the mad Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried, who was the voice of Captain Hook in Walt Disney’s 1953 animated “Peter Pan”).\n\nDr. T is a musical führer who practices mass hypnosis and employs slave labor; his Terwilliker Institute is surrounded by electrified barbed wire. The fulfillment of his master plan entails 500 boys (with 5,000 “happy fingers”), all wearing beanies topped with flaccid hands, together playing a monstrous piano more suggestive of a factory assembly line than a baby grand.\n\nThe compositions at times parody Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will,” while Dr. T, foppish and lanky, seems modeled after the wartime caricatures of Adolf Hitler that Mr. Geisel published in the New York tabloid PM. Adding to the allegory, the adult hero, an all-American plumber named Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes, Ms. Healy’s real-life husband and show-business partner), must be coaxed to join Bart in the struggle against the music teacher’s totalitarian racket. Zabladowski’s hocus-pocus tango with Dr. T, one of many splendidly strange musical numbers, anticipates the spell-casting duels of the comic book Dr. Strange.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
