I teach storytelling and film at a University in Chicago, and here I was breaking all of my own rules.\n\nBut that’s where I found myself, and I quickly discovered that God is an incredible film producer.

Along the way, He places his finger on our lives, touches us deeply, heals us, shows His creativity, and generally surprises us with every move He makes.\n\nThe film’s international cast includes a wide variety of people, ministries, and personalities.
