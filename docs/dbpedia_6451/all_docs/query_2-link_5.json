        "text": "‘Fingers’ Is Strictly From Desperation\n\nOne of the oldest ploys of movie advertising is the one that insists that you'll either l've the film or hate it. In the case of “Fingers,” the ads read: t'Some will love it. Others will be angered by it. Everyone will be stunned by it.” Fearing the worst (indifference) the copywriters do their utmost to create polarized views. They are ever‐hopeful, like the would‐be celebrity who says, “I don't care what they say about me as long as they spell my name right.”\n\nBecause “Fingers” seems to be creating a tot more aiscussion than it deserves, I feel that by writing about it, as I'm about to do, I've somehow been hooked by the ad, though my reaction to it when I came out of the screening room was mildly amused, “How did he—James Toback—ever hustle up the money to make it?” On the basis of his one previous screenplay (for Karel Reisz's “The Gambler”), which had the excitement and insight of a sticky‐fingered comparativeliterature student's first term paper, and certainly on the basis of his screenplay for “Fingers” itself, something more than apparent talent was involved. “Fingers” is to the films of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader—films that “Fingers” seems to ape—what that long list of failed “youth” pictures (“The Strawberry Statement,” “Getting Straight,” “RPM” and “The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart”) was to “Easy Rider.” A spin‐off. Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Schrader, even when their films are less than great, are original talents. Their obsessions with religion, sex, violence, guilt and the general quality of American life are matched by their knowledge of cinema. They know what the camera can and cannot do. Mr. Toback's obsession is much simpler. He wants very much to make a movie. Any movie. He wants to see his na e lights. But it's as if he hadn't spent much time thinking about what kind of movie he'd like to make or even much about how movies are made, that is, what makes them different from the literary models he evokes, much like an aggressively talkative but none too sensitive comp‐lit student. “The Gambler” was out of Dostoyevsky. “Fingers” is out of despera-\n\n“Fingers” wants to be An Urban Movie of Our Time, about sex and violence and the contradictory demands family, when family bonds are disintegrating. Specifically, it's about Jimmy (Harvey Keitel), a character created out old whole‐cloth, the musically talented son of a Mafia hoodlum (Michael V. Gazzo), who is Italian, and a concert‐pianist mom (Marian Seldes), who is Jewish and who is, for reasons never explained (perhaps because she's sensitive), locked in a funny farm. .\n\nWhen the movie opens, the camera catches Jimmy in long‐shot, down the length of his fashionable East Side studio apartment, as he ecstatically plays a little Bach cantata, which, we learn later, he is preparing for an audition with an important concert impresario. As Jimmy feels himself increasingly swept up in Bach, responding to the music as if on the point of sexual fulfillment, the camera approaches him slowly, taking so long that one feels the only way for the scene to be concluded is to show us that Jimmy is, in fact, seated a player‐piano. But no. Jimmy/ Harvey is really playingwhich is just the first of a series of anti‐climaxes that dog the movie with the persistence of a humorless flat‐foot.\n\n• • •\n\nJimmy, Mr. Toback would have us believe, burns with something more than a hard, gem‐like flame‐with the fury of a blow‐torch. Music is his life. When he's not fingering Bach on his baby grand, he is walking about the city carring, as his security blanket, a portable tape deck on which he plays the rock-and-roll classics of the 1950's so loudly he offends everyone. Jimmy is supposed to be one of those impossible nuts whose passions are too much for him- and perhaps even for one movie‐to contain. He's meant to be a series successive emotional revelations, explosions really; though, as the intense Mr. Keitel plays him, the intended explosions are an anthology of peculiar, quirky mannerisms that not only don't go off, they don't add up to much more than an actor's monthly exercises. They're little, peculiar, “phfffts”firecrackers heard at a great distance.\n\nThis may not be the actor's fault. One assumes that if the film had had some guiding theme, the performance would not seem so busy and, finally, so superfluous.\n\nThe plot that Mr. Toback has hatched for this character has to do with two underworld “collections” Jimmy's dad wants carried out just before Jimmy's big audition with the concert impresario. There's also the subplot, though I suspect the subplot contains the most compelling reason “Fingers” was made. This subplot is about an illusive (actually dopey) girl Jimmy picks up, a fey sculptor (Tisa Farrow) who inhabits a SoHo loft she looks ill-at-ease in and who carries on with a black gangster named‐are you ready?‐Dreems, played by Jim Brown, who, though he's going thick around the middle, is clearly the movie's principal sex object.\n\nWithout building any momentum whatsoever, the movie darts among its various plot threads like a cat who wants play, but can't stick at one thread long enough to have any fun: Jimmy makes one collection successfully, from the owner of a pizza parlor. He goes to have his prostate gland examined (the doc says he's straining himself). He practices for his audition. He calls on Tisa. They have sex, quite, as speedily as two pigeons. He seduces one young woman (the friend of a gangster he wants to anger and humiliate) while both are standing up in the women's room of a health club., He is invited by Dreems to partidipate in a sex party for four and refuses, preferring to watch. Dreems is impatient when the second girl in the party won't kiss Tisa. Dreems knocks the two women's heads together. Whack! Jimmy goes home and weeps. Which leads—as June follows December—to a climactic fist-and-gun-fight sequence with lots and lots of blood. Is too much? No. It's not enough. It's about as close to nothing as can be created out of random feelings.\n\nPerhaps not entirely random. The key to the film, I sutl pect, is a pock Mr. Toback wrote some years ago called “Jim,” about his association with Jim Brown when Mr. Toback went to Hollywood on an assignment from Esquire write a piece about the actor/football star. Instead of doing the piece, Mr. Toback became so fascinated by Mr. Brown. and fascinated by that fascination, that he moved in with Mr. Brown and wrote the book. “Jim” is an appalling and fascinating mixture of self‐analysis, hero‐worship and incredible self‐importance, the climax of which is a scene in which Brown, Mr. Toback and two women recently picked up, Tepair to Mr. Brown's bedroom for sex. The author, ever ready to tell all, describes in detail how he adjusted to the bounces on the other side of the bed to time his needs to coincide with Mr. Brown's.\n\nAs might be expected, “Jim” says a lot less about Jim Brown than “The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas” say's. about Alice, but Mr. Toback is not Gertrude Stein. The pictuje that emerges from “Jim” is of a groupie with an irrespre§sible gift for gab, a guy so busy seeing himself in relation to an admired object that the real world becomes pure fantasy.\n\n• • •\n\nEven though Jim Brown /Dreems enters “Fingers” a a peripheral character, it's quickly apparent that the movie, whose scenes are badly framed and often clumsily staged, exists as a testament to the feelings that Mr. Toback has toward Mr. Brown. The movie suddenly has a focal point. Mr. Bromin physically dwarfs Mr. Keitel (the artist's surrogate) who, after Mr. Brown's appearance on the scone, becomes a kind of pathetic joke, not because the director‐writer doesn't take him seriously but because he does.\n\nThis era of new, highly subjective journalism has produced some remarkable literature, including Norman’ Mailer's “Armies of the Night,” Tom Wicker's “A Time’ to: Die” and Michael Herr's “Dispatches,” and a great dearof junk on the order of Tennessee Williams's “Memoirs.” Sonle books, like “Memoirs,” are not very well written, while others, like “Jim,” are not very well written about subjecleof no great import to anyone except the author's friends.\n\nSuch a film is “Fingers,” whose twitchy principal performance, peculiar mixture of milieus and final violence, plus the moviemaker's frankness about such things as prostate exams, give it kind of bogus chic, but it's a groupie's movie. You don't have to love it or be angered by it. You may only be depressed. 1 •"
