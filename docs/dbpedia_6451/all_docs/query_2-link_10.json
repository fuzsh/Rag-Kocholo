        "text": "I watched a feature-length movie on TV in Romania in the '90s. It was shown on the main TV station in the country, after 10PM, at a time when there was a single national TV station on the air and cable TV hadn't taken off yet. The money was scarce, so I speculate the TV station may have bought cheap direct-to-video productions in bulk. The movie was broadcast in English-language with Romanian subtitles.\n\nUnfortunately, I was only a teenager when I saw this film, so I don't have clear memories of the story or characters. The strongest memory I have is of a spaceship with a logo on its side. The logo was a light human hand delicately holding a star between the thumb and index finger, on a dark background.\n\nThe logo was somewhat similar to this, but with a much smaller star, and a few other identical stars above/around the hand:\n\nI don't remember the colors, probably because I likely watched the film on a small B&W TV I had in my room.\n\nThe ship design I can't really describe. The best I can do is some combination between a Lambda-class shuttle (Star Wars) and a Federation shuttlecraft (Star Trek). It was basically a small vessel with a small crew, its crew entirely shown on screen. I don't remember other technical details about the ship, sorry.\n\nThe film might involve an encounter with an alien entity on a planet. I seem to remember some laser-based perimeter security barrier that eventually the mysterious alien entity overruns. However, this might be part of a totally different movie I saw around that time. Sorry, this memory is much fainter."
