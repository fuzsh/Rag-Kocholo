Gazzo) and when he's not practicing piano, he's roughing up guys unable to pay their debts to his father. To ease the pressure he feels between his family obligations and his artistic ambitions, Jimmy indulges in sex and drugs. But the stress is getting too much, and Jimmy may ruin everything as his life spins out of control.",
