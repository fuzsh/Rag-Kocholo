        "text": "Jimmy (Harvey Keitel) wants nothing more than to play Carnegie Hall. He has talent, and the ambition is definitely there. But Jimmy is the son of a mob boss (Michael V. Gazzo) and when hes not practicing piano, hes roughing up guys unable to pay their debts to his father. To ease the pressure he feels between his family obligations and his artistic ambitions, Jimmy indulges in sex and drugs. But the stress is getting too much, and Jimmy may ruin everything as his life spins out of control.\n\nContents\n\nFingers 1978 official trailer harvey keitel tisa farrow movie hd\n\nSynopsis\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nInfluence\n\nMusic\n\nReferences\n\nFingers is a 1978 drama film directed by James Toback.\n\nKeitel plays the lead in this schizophrenic movie in which he is continually pulled by the two conflicting sides of his personality, on the one hand that of a quiet piano virtuoso and on the other a ruthless debt collector for his mobster father. Keitel is introspective as only Keitel can be, really making the audience feel for him and his pained existence.\n\nSynopsis\n\nJimmy \"Fingers\" Angelelli (Harvey Keitel) is a brilliant young pianist who also works as a collector for his father Ben (Michael V. Gazzo), a powerful loan shark. Wherever Jimmy goes, he always carries a stereo with him, playing classic rock from the 50s and 60s. While trying to concentrate on an up-coming recital interview at Carnegie Hall, Jimmy loses focus when he falls for a woman named Carol (Tisa Farrow). He gets further side-tracked with collecting a large debt from a mafioso named Riccamonza (Tony Sirico), who eventually threatens Bens life. This forces Jimmy to seek retribution.\n\nCast\n\nHarvey Keitel as Jimmy Fingers\n\nTisa Farrow as Carol\n\nMichael V. Gazzo as Ben Angelelli\n\nJim Brown as Dreems\n\nTanya Roberts as Julie\n\nDanny Aiello as Butch\n\nEd Marinaro as Gino\n\nTony Sirico as Riccamonza\n\nDominic Chianese as Arthur Fox\n\nSam Coppola as Sam\n\nProduction\n\nJames Toback said he originally wanted Robert de Niro to play the lead but then decided to use de Niros best friend, Harvey Keitel. \"Harvey agreed to play Jimmy and quickly began to astonish me by taking the character into dimensions of darkness well beyond my original imagining,\" wrote Toback.\n\nInfluence\n\nThe film was remade in 2005 in France as The Beat That My Heart Skipped.\n\nDirector Brett Ratner has stated that Fingers is one of his three favorite movies, along with The Godfather and Jaws.\n\nMusic\n\nTwo notable pieces from the film are \"Angel of the Morning\" by Merrilee Rush and \"Summertime, Summertime\" by The Jamies. Director Toback, initially wanted to use the song \"Summertime\" because the movie had \"a summertime feel to it,\" and they wanted to shoot it during the summer months. It wasnt to be however, yet he thought it appropriate enough to leave the song in there. The whole film, however, is framed by the music of Johann Sebastian Bachs Toccata in E minor (BWV 914), which Keitels character plays throughout the film, including during his audition at Carnegie Hall."
