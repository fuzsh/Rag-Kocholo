        "text": "What started as a bit of fun on the weekend has resulted in international attention for a group of Adelaide filmmakers.\n\nThey call themselves Fury Fingers and they have managed to attract more than 11,200 YouTube subscribers since posting their first short two years ago.\n\nTheir films — including take-offs of Tom Clancy's The Division, the Call Of Duty games and Pacman — also attracted interest from four computer game production companies who have since partially funded their work.\n\nThe group, created by Nicholas Cleary, Andrew Shanks, Daniel Vink and David Gregan, was born after funding grants for more mainstream films were rejected.\n\n\"It just started as a bit of casual fun which has gained momentum,\" Mr Shanks said.\n\n\"We use fans films to skip a lot of exposition and get right into the good stuff of the action and drama,\" Mr Cleary added.\n\nBeing apart of something 'cool'\n\nClashes of armour and screams of \"charge\" break the silence of an area near the Kuitpo, south of Adelaide.\n\nThe cast and crew made up of 17 volunteers have chosen a small gum tree forest to stage their medieval battle.\n\n\"Everyone is here and working for free because they want to be part of something that is cool,\" Mr Cleary said.\n\nOn set were actors, stunt people, film crew, make-up artists, costume designers and photographers.\n\n\"It's really easy to recruit people now,\" Mr Cleary said.\n\n\"The stuff that we do is very unique in Adelaide,\" Mr Shank said.\n\n\"It is action-heavy with fight choreography and visual effects.\"\n\nSharing is key to success\n\nTo date the group's most successful fan films have been action sequences inspired by the computer game Metal Gear Solid.\n\nThe first episode attracted more than 220,000 views.\n\nA follow-up episode received more than 165,000 views.\n\nThe team has also riffed on the movie and game series Tomb Raider, creating Boom Raider.\n\nIt has had more than 100,000 views.\n\n\"Views on YouTube are very unpredictable, but we are at a point now where we have a few videos that have done very well,\" Mr Shanks said.\n\n\"A lot of that is due to companies ... Konami and Ubisoft (video game producers) got behind us and shared our work through their channels.\"\n\nHopes to turn hobby into career\n\nMr Shanks is studying a course on film direction at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.\n\n\"I'm hoping that new skill set will feed back into Fury Fingers,\" he said.\n\nThe group has already attended meetings with production companies in Los Angeles, but Mr Shanks said he hoped to continue honing his craft producing features locally as well.\n\n\"I love Adelaide and I want to continue to live in Adelaide,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got everything we need at our disposal in Adelaide.\"\n\nFor Mr Cleary, who is studying a degree in education, he said he was just taking each day as it comes.\n\n\"I'd love to do Fury each day for the rest of my life, but we will have to see what happens,\" he said."
