        "text": "DVD-Review from Mike Close\n\nThe Movie: Tricks and Fiction from the Road The Flicking Fingers The summer of 2003 will be much more fun thanks to Die Fertigen Finger, the ten-man German close-up group that amazed and amused audiences at the 1997 FISM convention and 1998\n\nDesert Magic Seminar.\n\nKnown in English-speaking countries as The Flicking Fingers, these young men demonstrate the qualities that I admire in a magician: enthusiasm, energy, ingenuity, performance and technical chops and a great sense of humor.\n\nIn October 2002 the team went on a ten-day tour, performing at a number of public shows and magic convention appearances. A professional film crew accompanied them. The result is The Movie: Tricks and Fiction from the Road, three and a half hours of great magic, silly gags, and big laughs.\n\nThe major part of the DVD (two hours and 20 minutes worth) details the road trip. The Flicking Fingers visit Leverkusen, Munich, Hamburg, and Lund (Sweden). We get to see little snippets of their stage act, and then the members perform close-up routines in various impromptu and formal settings. The tricks are good, and I'm sure you'll find a few that you'll want to add to your repertoire.\n\nWhat are absolutely great are the explanations. You've never seen explanations like this. For example, Pit Hartling performs a very nice effect in which a chosen card is found before it is even selected. Pit explains that he had the benefit of excellent performing conditions, but sometimes conditions are not so good.\n\nHe performs the effect again, but this time the audience consists of three really drunk guys. As he attempts to perform the routine the drunks bust him every time he does a move. In doing so the viewer learns how the trick works.\n\nThese types of creative and funny explanations happen throughout the DVD and they are really fun. (They are also the highlight of a Flicking Finger lecture.) Scattered throughout the movie are funny commercials and other silly bits of business that will probably make you laugh out loud.\n\nIn addition to the main movie there are lots of bonus materials, including FISM acts of Pit Hartling (as The Heinz), Manuel Muerte with The Mice Act, Gaston doing the Cups and Balls, Mr. Punch and the Magician (with Thomas Fraps and Gaston), Joerg Alexander performing the Sympathetic Ten (one of the highlights of The Book: Or don't forget to Point) and Nikolai Friedrich performing the Mona Lisa. You'll also find Super Practice segments, Out-takes, and a funny trailer featuring some of the biggest names in magic. This is a superior product in many levels.\n\nThe price is higher than most magic DVDs, but you get a ton of material. You'll learn some good magic and you'll be laughing while you do it. The Movie: Tricks and Fiction from the Road is a delightful change of pace from standard magic video fare. Recommend.\n\nMike Close, MAGIC - June 2003"
