        "text": "(instrumental piano music)\n\n[Narrator] I'm Richard Brody\n\nand this clip is from Fingers,\n\nthe 1978 drama directed by James Toback.\n\nIt's Toback's first feature,\n\nand like many first features,\n\nit plays like a catalogue of the director's obsessions.\n\nHarvey Keitel stars as Jimmy Angelelli,\n\na concert pianist and Bach fanatic,\n\nwho has something of a divided identity.\n\nHis father Ben, played by Michael V. Gazzo,\n\nis loud, vulgar, profane, racist, sexist,\n\nand a loan shark,\n\nwho uses Jimmy as his strong arm man.\n\nSomeone must have told him\n\nyou don't have many people working for you anymore.\n\nWhat too many people, Jimmy?\n\nI got nobody.\n\nI got you.\n\n[Richard] And, Jimmy is an effective one.\n\nSometimes.\n\nHey officer, officer.\n\nWhat?\n\n[Richard] But, Jimmy is tormented by devils of his own.\n\nHe's something of a sex maniac.\n\nA sort of romantic sex addict\n\nand minor predator,\n\nwho deploys his seductive skills\n\nas part of his racket.\n\nSuggesting that even consensual sex\n\nis as much a matter of power\n\nas of pleasure.\n\nThe division of Jimmy's character is inbred.\n\nHis mother is a concert pianist\n\nand Jimmy is preparing for an audition with the impresario\n\nwho put her on the map,\n\nbut at the moment,\n\nshe's no longer on the map.\n\nShe's is a mental institution.\n\nJimmy, seemingly like Toback himself,\n\nis something of an ethnic essentialist.\n\nThe Italian side of Jimmy's character is a mobster.\n\nThe Jewish side is an artist,\n\nand where Jimmy sees black people,\n\nblack men,\n\nhe sees a natural superior strength and sexual potency.\n\nHey waiter.\n\nTell this character to turn his radio off.\n\nWhat are you telling him for?\n\nTell me.\n\n[Richard] Fingers made in 1978\n\nreeks of it's facile distinctions\n\nand unquestioned prejudices.\n\nIt plays like the airing of a festering soul.\n\nJimmy, the hypersensitive pianist\n\nand hotheaded enforcer,\n\nis in effect Toback in Hollywood.\n\nAn artist of exquisite sensibility,\n\nfunctioning in a media of ball breakers.\n\nA world of oversexed power mad men\n\nand of women for whom sex\n\nand the allure of power and success seem inseparable.\n\n(instrumental piano music)\n\nIt may be a stereotype of Hollywood, as well,\n\nbut Toback seems, with his elegant camera moves,\n\nto be virtually screaming\n\nWhat am I doing here?\n\nWhere do I belong?\n\nWho in the world could love me for who I am\n\nand for that matter, who am I?\n\nThe movie is filled with prejudices and stereotypes.\n\nCinematic ones, as well.\n\n(soft music)\n\nDad!\n\nGet over there.\n\n[Richard] And, Toback seems to be fighting his way\n\nout of those, too.\n\nHe, or rather Jimmy, seems to understand nothing\n\nof the world of art,\n\nthe world of sex,\n\nthe world of ethnicity,\n\nor of family,\n\nor of love,\n\nor of money.\n\nFor Toback,\n\nthe image is of pure, abstractly beautiful\n\nBach like creation.\n\nOne that he had to wrench\n\nat great mental, material, and moral cost\n\non the vortex of crushing forces\n\nand from the dregs of his own being.\n\nWould you like some wine?"
