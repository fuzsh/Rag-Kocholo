        "text": "The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T is a neglected, almost unclassifiable oddity. Perhaps best described as a surreal children’s fantasy musical. It’s like Leave it to Beaver crossed with Salvador Dali. Part of what makes this ﬁlm notable is that it came out in 1953, and the other thing is that it’s the only feature ﬁlm by Theodor Geisel, better known of course as Dr. Suess. He was responsible for the story, screenplay, lyrics and the look of it. I gather he loathed the ﬁnished ﬁlm, feeling that his vision had been warped beyond recognition, and always disavowed it. But undeniably, the look and dialogue is distinctly Seussian. To my twisted mind, this is a wonderful childrens films and undeniably one of the weirdest major-studio releases of all time. If it was released today people would think it totally bizarre. To think that this played in theatres at the same time as Shane and From Here To Eternity makes it even odder. The film was both a commercial and critical flop, but it has taken on a life of its own as an obscure cult classic. If you’re at all a fan of Dr. Seuss, or if you just like weird but totally good natured movies, you owe it to yourself to track this gem down. Some will love it, and some will hate it.\n\nTen year old Bart Collins (Tommy Rettig {of Lassie fame}) lives with his widowed mother Heloise (Mary Healy). His mother insists he take piano lessons, something just about any boy his age abhors. All he wants to do is run around with his friends and his dog, play baseball, ride his bicycle. But what makes it worse is that he has to take lessons from the autocratic Mr. Terwilliker (Hans Conreid {best known as the voice of Captain Hook, who plays this role with gleeful, campy abandon}). Bart fears that his beloved mother has fallen under his evil spell, and gripes about it to August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes), a plumber working in his house, who doesn’t pay him much heed.\n\nBart falls asleep at his piano and finds himself in a bizarre place, the Terwilliker Institute, where his autocratic piano teacher is now the mad dictator, Dr. T. He’s constructed a massive piano that requires Bart and 499 other enslaved boys to play it. Forced to wear a Happy Fingers beanie, Bart is the first unwilling recruit for the 5000-fingered recital. He finds that his beloved mother has been turned into Dr. T./Mr. Terwillikers hypnotized secretary and bride-to-be. Soon he’s trying to evade legions of bizarrely dressed guards, the weirdest being Judson and Whitney, Siamese twins connected by a single gray beard who pursue Bart on roller skates.\n\nHe attempts to recruit the help of a reluctant Zabladowski, who is installing sinks at the Institute to prepare for an inspection, but he’s very skeptical. He does however agree to check on Bart’s mom. There he runs into Dr. T., who for no apparent reason engages the plumber, whom he’s never laid eyes on before, in a hilarious, totally over the top, dancing duel.\n\nBart discovers that the pretentious martinet Dr. T. has issued an order to have the plumber disintegrated at dawn.\n\nBart wakes at his piano, and it’s implied that perhaps it wasn’t just a dream. He and Zabladowski still have bandages on their thumbs from their blood pact. At the movies conclusion, Mr. Zabladowski, who clearly is a surrogate father ﬁgure, ﬁnally notices Heloise, (in real life Healy and Hayes were married and almost always worked as a duo), and offers to drive her into town in his jeep. Bart runs outside with his dog and a baseball and mitt, an almost Norman Rockwellian image of American normalcy.\n\nCompletely campy and crazy, I still find this a totally fun movie. Worth checking out some time."
