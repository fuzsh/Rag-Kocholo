        "text": "JIMMY ANGELELLI, the hypersensitive hero of \"Fingers,\" which opened yesterday at Cinema 2, is a man who has no frieends and who doesn't deserve any. For one thing, Jimmy is too busy pacing, brooding, pouncing, snarling and having inexplicable conniptions to have time for much of a social life. For another, he isn't the sort of fellow who'll allow anyone to get very close to him.We know this, and a lot of other things about Jimmy, courtesy of his portable tape deck, which he carries with him everywhere (because it puts up a kind of wall between him and the rest of the world), and which he uses to play both classical music and 50's rock-and-roll (Jimmy's is a divided nature). He even turns on the machine in restaurants, in scenes that mean to establish him as a desperately insecure figure but instead make him out to be a public nuisance.\"Fingers\" marks the directional debut of the screenwriter James Toback (\"The Gambler\"), who exhibits a fatal fascination with Jimmy's every petulant quirk. Mr. Toback, having created a character whose intrinsic charm plus 50 cents would only barely get him onto the subway, seems incapable of putting his hero in any kind of dramatic perspective, and he is apparently unwilling to explore him in terms more intimate than those of an introductory psychology course. Jimmy's mother was a musician and his father is a boorish gangster; his mother resents him bitterly and his father wishes he'd strangled him in his crib. No wonder the kid's got a headache.Many of Jimmy's troubles revolve around sex, to which he devotes himself far too selflessly, according to his doctor (if this isn't the only movie to show someone having his prostate examined, it ought to be). Jimmy is obsessively entangled with a strange, elusive, mysterious girl (Tisa Farrow) who is so spitefully uncommunicative that one begins wanting, in the spirit of the movie, to give her a good belt. Jimmy's machismo—he tries to castrate a rival, thinks women are sexier without birth control—is enough to make Tarzan blush.Mr. Toback favors a stiff, staccato, nervous style of direction that's heavy on the hocus-pocus and low on verisimilitude or insight. Aiming for a mood of nightmarish abstraction, he borders all too often on jumpy incompetence. Although the film's production credits are impressive—the cinematographer from \"Taxi Driver,\" the production designer from \"Three Days of the Condor,\" the costume designer for \"Next Stop, Greenwich Village\"—and suggest that the film ought to have a good feeling for New York, it contains moments of surprising amateurishness. The sets look uninhabitable and the sound mixing is particularly appalling: A phone in the back of a restaurant rings at top volume, and the music sounds equally scratchy whether it's coming from a tape deck or a concert piano.Perhaps this should have been the movie to establish Harvey Keitel as a leading man of depth and versatility, but Mr. Keitel's performance as Jimmy only underscores Mr. Toback's skittishness. The screenplay draws Jimmy's character in such rudimentary terms that Mr. Keitel might have breathed a little healthy confusion into the role by playing against it. Instead, he does little more than illustrate Mr. Toback's points with a textbook tidiness, turning each scene into a virtual exercise. The part of Jimmy on which Mr. Keitel concentrates most avidly is, you guessed it, his fingers, whether Jimmy is working as a loan collector in his father's employ or a pianist in his mother's shadow. Not since Captain Queeg have a character's hands done so much restless wiggling and tapping.Mr. Keitel, as always, gives an impression of earnestness and dedication, but everyone else in the film appears to be in a big hurry to get to his or her lunch date. Miss Farrow is lovely to watch, but she gives a performance of such low wattage she barely seems plugged in; Marian Seldes and Michael V. Gazzo, as Jimmy's parents, suggest that Mr. Toback doesn't believe there's any such thing as overacting.Jim Brown, as the only real sex object in the movie (he's the only character who doesn't wear underwear), has the film's most, memorably silly moment, in which he smacks two women's heads together because they don't want to kiss each other. This episode, intended as a kind of taunt to Jimmy, is only one of many things in the film that only Mr. Toback could, or would want to, understand.\n\nPetulant Nuisance\n\nFINGERS, directed and written by James Toback; director of photography, Mike Chapman; produced by George Barrie; presented by Brut Productions Inc.
