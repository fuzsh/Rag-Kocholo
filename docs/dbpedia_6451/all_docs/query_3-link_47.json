        "text": "He might voice a cop in the latest Disney-Pixar movie, but Flea is still a rebel at heart.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers rocker appeared to forget where he was for a moment as he posed with both middle fingers in the air on the purple carpet of Monday’s Inside Out 2 world premiere in Los Angeles.\n\nIt all appeared to be in good fun as he also busted out some dance moves for the cameras. Deadline has reached out to Flea’s reps for comment.\n\nDespite the unexpected rockstar vibes, the event at Hollywood’s El Capitan Theatre drew plenty of families, including Ashlee Simpson, husband Evan Ross, and their brood.\n\nFlea reprises his voice role as Mind Cop Worker Jake from the original 2015 film, which takes place inside a young girl’s mind, following the personifications of her changing emotions.\n\nAlso in attendance at the premiere was Kensington Tallman, who plays the voice of 13-year-old Riley. After Kaitlyn Dias voiced the character as a child in the first movie, the sequel follows Riley’s adventures in high school as she develops a whole new set of emotions.\n\nAyo Edebiri walked the red carpet, wearing the cyan color of her character Envy, a new addition in the sequel. Maya Hawke attended as well, voicing the new character Anxiety.\n\nReturning voice actors Kyle MacLachlan (Riley’s Dad) and Lewis Black (Anger) celebrated the premiere, along with new voices Yvette Nicole Brown (Coach Roberts), Ron Funches (Bloofy, a children’s TV character) and Lilimar (popular girl Val).\n\nAlthough Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader did not return to voice their respective roles, Disgust and Fear, their successors, Liza Lapira and Tony Hale, were in attendance Monday.\n\nInside Out 2 premieres Friday, June 13, in theaters."
