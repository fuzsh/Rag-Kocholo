        "text": "100 Degrees Challenge - Film #68\n\nA tangibly lesser variation on the kind of hard-bitten character studies Scorsese and Schrader were doing around the same time, but Toback acquits himself well enough with his outwardly familiar Keitel's aspiring musician being caught up in his loan-shark father's affairs - at the same time, there's enough of a complexity to a protagonist whose easygoing demeanour belies a reluctant but nevertheless potent capacity for forceful imposition (which only makes the scenes where he is made to feel vulnerable and humiliated hit an even more exposed nerve).\n\nIts a strange one! I cant fully make up my mind about it. Its a vibe. Certainly didnt expect so much Harvey sex in this. His performance elevates the movie a lot.\n\nThis gets pretty sketchy for me here and there. I dont think I'd ever recommend it but I could prolly talk to somebody else at a party who has seen it for like an hour.\n\n“Can you believe this? This is the Jamies man, ‘Summertime Summertime’. The most musically inventive song of 1958. What are you eating, shrimp? You’re telling me this song doesn’t go with your shrimp?”\n\nHilariously bad. Harvey Keitel carries a boombox everywhere, constantly playing cassette tapes, in the middle of crowded restaurants, creeping up on women, forcing himself on women, wherever he goes he’s gotta be the DJ. At home he hammers out manic classical piano pieces recorded reel to reel. He also gets a painful prostate exam, a clever nod to the title.\n\nHarvey Keitel was really good in this film. It’s actually one of my favorite performances of his. He keeps impressing me as an actor. Honestly the acting was really good all around. This film won’t be for everyone but I totally dug it. It sorta feels like a hand-me-down Taxi Driver especially with that final fight scene but to be honest it’s more than just that. Real gem of a film.\n\nFelt like a decent short story put to film. Hilarious this comes out the same year as taxi driver, and Harvey Keitel played on either side of a pimp.\n\nAlso, if you're familiar with the Sopranos, Tony Sirico is almost unrecognizable except for his gestures, which are somehow exactly the same--he can snap his fingers insanely loudly\n\nToback's Electra Glide in Blue, but more cartoonish and also more harsh. There is no place for a touched boy in a man's world when he tries to play both sides against the middle. Under these conflicting internal and external pressures, the boy mutates into something horrible"
