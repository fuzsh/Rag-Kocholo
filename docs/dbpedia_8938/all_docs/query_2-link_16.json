To make an appointment, please contact internationalprograms@noctrl.edu or call the Center for Global Education at 630-637-5132.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nSpring Semester (April-August)/Full Year\n\nEligible students must be junior or senior standing with at least two years of college-level Japanese in succession with a preferred GPA of 3.0.\n\nLocated in the heart of Tokyo, Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU) was established by Methodist missionaries in 1874. The institution took its present form in 1949 when it became a comprehensive university comprised of 10 schools and colleges with both undergraduate and graduate programs. Now with 10 schools and 24 departments, the university of 18,000 students is well known for its international ambiance, offering more than 240 courses taught in English, including general education, literature, economics, international politics and business, science and engineering and global studies. Most undergraduate courses taught in Japanese are open to exchange students. Students also have the opportunity to work at Aoyama Gakuin’s affiliated elementary school as “chat leaders,” and to participate in the conversation partner program with local AGU students.\n\nAoyama Gakuin University website\n\nAcademics\n\nStudents are required to complete GLS 277 in the spring term prior to studying abroad.\n\nStudents earn 9-12 credit hours per term depending on courses selected and length of stay. All grades earned abroad affect students North Central College GPA when transferred back. Students cannot take courses pass/fail.\n\nFor a list of courses taught in English and access to a full list of all courses (taught in English and Japanese), please click here.\n\nNote: Students must have courses pre-approved by North Central College prior to taking them abroad. If students change their course schedules while abroad, they must get this change approved. Some departments only permit students to take a certain number of courses that count toward their major abroad; by getting all courses pre-approved, this ensures that these courses will count towards their degrees.\n\nAoyama Academic Calendar\n\nThe Center for Global Education does not advise student to purchase flight tickets until they have received an official acceptance letter from Aoyama Gakuin University.\n\nHousing and Meals\n\nStudents live in AGU residence halls, apartments, or Guest Houses while studying at AGU. Students who have studied at Aoyama Gakuin in the past recommend living in Guest Houses as they tend to be closer to campus and have fewer restrictions and rules.\n\nAdditional information regarding the residence halls can be found on the AGU website, or by clicking here.\n\nMeals: students are responsible for preparing their own meals in a shared kitchen."
