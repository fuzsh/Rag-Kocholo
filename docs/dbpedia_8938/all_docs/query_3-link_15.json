        "text": "Students at Aoyama Gakuin University typically enroll for at least 14 credits per semester. AGU offers a broad range of classes in English spanning several fields of study, and different courses are available depending on if students choose to study at the Aoyama or Sagamihara campus. Students with a Japanese proficiency of at least JLPT N4 can enroll in Japanese courses as part of their class schedule while those with lower proficiency have the option to take extracurricular (non-credit) Japanese courses taught in English.\n\nMore information about available courses can be found here.\n\nThis program is open to undergraduate students in any major. To be eligible, students must meet the following minimum requirements before departure:\n\n45 college credits minimum (at least sophomore standing)\n\nInstitutional GPA of 2.75 or above\n\nMinimum of one year of college-level Japanese study with a Japanese language ability equivalent to N5 Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) or plan to take courses in English only (for the Aoyama campus). Please note some departments at the Sagamihara campus require Japanese.\n\nStudents must continue to make satisfactory academic progress throughout the application process and during their study abroad program, and otherwise comply with policies and procedures of the host university, IE3 Global, and their home university International Programs Office. If you do not meet the minimum eligibility requirements, please consult with your home campus contact person before applying.\n\nAGU provides recommendations to students for housing options depending on which campus they’ll studying at. While AGU does not own residence halls, they do have a preferred dormitory company that they recommend to students. You’ll find more information here.\n\nStudents may also choose to arrange their own accommodations in apartments, share houses, or homestays.\n\nAoyama Gakuin has a dedicated International Center with English-speaking staff and faculty who provide excellent orientation and advising for students at AGU. The university also facilitates a Buddy system, pairing new international students with local student volunteers who provide peer support and insight into navigating Tokyo and the university. The International Center hosts “chat rooms” for English-speakers learning Japanese (and vice-versa) as an avenue to build language skills and cultural connections, and IE3 Global participants can join these chat rooms as Japanese learners or English leaders.\n\nIn addition to AGU’s resources, IE3 Global has an experienced staff member at the Oregon Japan Study Center at Waseda University, who is available year-round to support students and help introduce them to Japan.\n\nIE3 Global seeks to make its exchange programs affordable and accessible. For detailed information regarding the program budget (both the program fee and an estimate of personal expenses), please click on the following:\n\nAGU - Year\n\nAGU - Spring\n\nAGU - Fall/Winter\n\nAGU - Spring/Fall/Winter\n\nThe program fee includes academic and administrative fees, room and board, orientation expenses, on-site support, and health and accident insurance. The program fee does not include airfare, campus-based fees and personal expenses such as local transportation, textbooks, laundry, recreation (including travel), personal supplies and incidental expenses.\n\n“Things I definitely do not want to forget:\n\n1. What made me laugh out loud: Friends in Shibuya\n\n2. What brought tears to my eyes: Getting hit in the head during kendo practice with no head gear\n\n3. My greatest personal insight: Japanese mannerisms and boundaries\n\n4. My biggest cultural faux pas: meeting a student that I thought can speak English but was actually a Japanese student\n\n5. My biggest cultural success: Meeting a friend at the start and the end of my study abroad and learning how much better my Japanese has gotten” - Lance Umagat, 2016"
