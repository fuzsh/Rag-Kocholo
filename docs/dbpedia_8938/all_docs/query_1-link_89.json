        "text": "3. Compatibility with the ABEST21 Standards\n\nChapter One: Internal Quality Assurance and Management\n\nStandard 1: Academic Unit Management\n\nStandard 2: Governance System\n\nStandard 3: Self-Check/Self-Evaluation\n\nStandard 4: Staff-Development\n\nThe School has a proper management system and decision making process in place. The School has identified difficulties in hiring professional staff to develop and carry out its internationalization plan and activities. The School has an appropriate governance system in place to audit, review and verify its management decisions periodically. Based on the reports and online interviews, the School needs to prepare its staff for promoting internationalization and conducting classes in English.\n\nABS’ Internal Quality Assurance and Management system is compatible with the ABEST21 Standards.\n\nChapter Two: Mission Statement\n\nStandard 5: Mission Statement\n\nStandard 6: Financial Strategies\n\nThe School’s current mission statement was last developed in 2009. The mission statement was reviewed during the curriculum advisory committee meeting every year. Based on the feedback, the committee and the School decided that the mission statement remains as it is at the moment.\n\nABS’ mission statement is compatible with the ABEST21 Standards. We encourage ABS to continue reviewing it every year.\n\nChapter Three: Curriculum\n\nStandard 7: Learning Goals\n\nStandard 8: Curriculum Policy and Management of Curriculum\n\nStandard 9: Quality Improvement of Curriculum\n\nStandard 10: Online Education\n\nStandard 11: Diploma Policy and Learning Outcomes\n\nStandard 12: Globalization of Curriculum\n\nThere is a gap between the daytime and evening classes, especially in terms of students’ performance. Various actions have been taken to reduce this gap. The School needs to monitor and analyze if the steps taken are effective in bridging this gap. The School has just implemented Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) to measure the quality of the modules offered and students’ performance. The collected data will be analyzed and discussed during the relevant meetings related to curriculum development. Currently the School conducts 13% of its modules in English, and plans to increase this percentage in the future.\n\nABS’ Curriculum is compatible with ABEST21 Standards.\n\nChapter Four: Students\n\nStandard 13: Admission Policy and Student Selection\n\nStandard 14: Student Encouragement and Support\n\nStandard 15: Student Body Diversity\n\nThe School has a clear admission policy which has been practiced and the information is being disseminated via various admission documents. The School may consider recruiting more non-Japanese speaking students in view of its globalization initiatives.\n\nABS’ procedures for handling student issues are compatible with ABEST21 Standards. Yet, ABS should continue to monitor and finetune their teaching methods for handling the FT and PT MBA students to provide them with the best education experiences.\n\nChapter Five: Faculty\n\nStandard 16: Faculty Structure\n\nStandard 17: Faculty Qualifications\n\nStandard 18: Maintenance of Education and Research Environment\n\nStandard 19: Faculty Development\n\nStandard 20: Faculty Diversity\n\nThe School needs to start preparing the succession plan as several of the current staff members are reaching the retirement age soon. Some of the data are not tally in the report, which has been highlighted during the online interview. The School needs to define the meaning of “world-class research” as a benchmark for its staff. The School is planning to recruit female faculty members and foreign faculty members as part of its diversity plan.\n\nABS’ procedures for handling faculty issues are compatible with ABEST21 Standards. The ABS should consider recruiting more faculty who can deliver classes in English.\n\nChapter Six : Educational Infrastructure\n\nStandard 21: Maintenance of Educational Infrastructure\n\nStandard 22: Globalization of Educational Infrastructure\n\nThere are no major issues with the standard with the latest infrastructure and online databases being in place. ABS’ investment in educational infrastructure is compatible with ABEST 21 Standards. Yet, ABS should consider subscribing to more electronic databases to strengthen their teaching and research resources."
