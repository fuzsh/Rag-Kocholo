        "text": "Professor Paul Tsuchido Shew, Vice Chancellor of Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, Japan paid a courtesy call on Vice Chancellor Reverend Professor Peter Mageto and visited with the Africa University community from the 12th to the 14th of March 2023 during which time he delivered a special guest lecture to faculty and students from the Computer Sciences, Ethics and Theology classes on ChatGPT and its impact on higher education.\n\nYour support of the Africa University Fund apportionment supports the general operating expenses of Africa University including faculty and staff salaries and vital infrastructure.\n\nChatGPT which was developed by Open AI, is an artificial intelligence software that generates responses to user generated inquiries which can be long form essays or short answers on a variety of knowledge domains using a multitude of sources from the internet . What has the Higher Education sector abuzz about ChatGPT is the academic implications of such software on teaching, learning and academic integrity . Expanding further on this is the possible reduced capacity for deep thinking, analysis and critical problem solving . Also presenting complications is the factual accuracy of responses generated by Chat GPT which while at first glance and to a layperson not knowledgeable about the subject matter may seem true, can in fact be riddled with anomalies .\n\nThe capacity crowd grappled with these and other concerns paying special attention to how this software will ultimately affect learner outcomes and independent thought. Prof. Shew stressed that the use and grounding of future developments of ChatGPT should be in ethics so that the software presents more opportunities than threats to the expansion of knowledge.\n\nWith its many advantages such as proof reading, simplification of complex subject matter for more ease of access, translation and study companions, Prof. Shew intimated that when used correctly and ethically, Chat GPT can have many good and useful applications to improve lives and learning. With an opportunity for one- on- one interactions with Prof. Shew, students and faculty made full use of Prof. Shew’s extensive expertise on the subject.\n\nSeeking out pathways to also further strengthen relations between AU and Aoyama Gakuin, Professor Shew also had the opportunity to interact with leadership from the colleges, student and academic advising as well as the Institute of Theology and Religious Studies on exchanges, benchmarking and research.\n\nFounded by the Methodist Church in 1874, Aoyama Gakuin School Corporation continues John Wesley’s vision of combining the pursuit of scholarship and vital piety. Aoyama Gakuin aims to educate students with a strong sense of social responsibility and morality in order to contribute to society and today’s world. Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU) has established a national reputation for the high quality of its teaching and its international ambience, and is widely recognized as one of the leading private universities in Japan. AGU has strength in research in numerous fields, including economics, human rights and international law, business, science and technology, and Japanese language and culture.\n\nAfrica University website"
