        "text": "The Aoyama Gakuin University is one of the top private universities in Tokyo and it is known not only for its curriculum but also for its fabulous position in the center of Tokyo.\n\nThis University has two campuses one in Shibuya and the other in Sagamihara where most of the scientific faculties are located. The first one is 5 minutes away from Omotesando station which is one of the major luxury shopping destinations and home to some of the most amazing examples of modern architecture. The other one is surrounded by nature and it has this beautiful lawn where students gather to have picnics. You can enjoy your student life on both campuses!\n\nFrom the academic point of view, there are 11 faculties divided into 27 majors.\n\nThe University is famous for the English and American Literature major and in general, for the high English proficiency it provides. All students are required to take classes for General Education, there are various choices so everyone will be able to find something of their interest. The only negative thing is that these classes are decided by drawing lots so it is possible that you will not be assigned to the desired course.\n\nLast year, 91,7% of the students who graduated, got a job so it can be said that this University offers good job prospects for the future.\n\nView more"
