        "text": "Tokyo, Japan\n\nTokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts. Encircled by stone-walled moats and broad gardens, the Imperial Palace, the home of the emperor of Japan, lies at the heart of the city. East of and adjacent to the Imperial Palace is the colorful Marunouchi district, the financial hub and a major center of Japanese business activity. The buildings in the different Tokyo districts range from stone and brick structures of the Meiji period (1868â€“1912) to postwar concrete and steel skyscrapers; there are also a dwindling number of wooden, Japanese-style buildings. The juxtaposition of the buildings in Tokyo highlights the extreme diversity in Japanese culture from the traditional to the high-tech. The climate is mild in winter and hot and humid in the summer. Early summer and early autumn are rainy seasons. High speed Shinkansen bullet trains can take you different parts of Japan, or hop on a bus and visit the famous Mt. Fuji. Japan offers all different landscapes for students to explore during their exchange semester.\n\nTokyo City Guide\n\nTokyo City Video\n\nOverview\n\nAoyama Gakuin University offers five levels of Japanese language courses for exchange students and also some courses taught in English. Students are not required to have prior knowledge of Japanese, however the lower level Japanese classes will be for non-credit. Students can also choose to only take classes taught in English. A certain level of Japanese proficiency (JLPT N4 or equivalent) is required to register for credited Japanese language courses, which is determined by a Japanese language exam given by AGU. Non-credited Japanese language courses for beginners taught in English are also available (free of charge). If a student wishes to take Japanese language at AGU, they will take a placement exam and could potentially be placed in non-credited Japanese language courses if they do not score high enough to be placed in the credited Japanese language courses. We recommend that students have at least taken Japanese 224 and above if they want to try and be placed in a credited Japanese language level. Otherwise, if you do not care about getting credits for Japanese language, you can attend AGU and take courses at any level and potentially not earn any Japanese language credit. Typically, students will take two Japanese language courses, a Japanese Culture & Society course, and two courses in English per semester. Courses offered in English at AGU include areas of study for business, communications, literature, global Studies and law. Students at AGU are generally required to take 14 credit hours per semester.\n\nAGU Campus Tour Video\n\nSubject Areas\n\nBusiness, International Studies, Political Science, Japanese language and culture\n\nSemester Dates\n\nFall: End of September until beginning of February\n\nSpring: Beginning of April until end of July\n\nClass List\n\nTo view courses that have been evaluated for AGU, please review the Aoyama Gakuin University class list.\n\nCourse Approval Form\n\nAll students will be required to complete a Course Approval Form prior to leaving for their study abroad program so that you have met with your academic advisor and are aware of what courses you will take during your program."
