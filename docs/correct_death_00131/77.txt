Andy Williams, one of America’s original crooners, has died at the age of 84.

Williams had been suffering from bladder cancer. He died on Tuesday at his home in Branson, Missouri.

Andy Williams was best known for his hit ‘Moon River’ but he also had 18 Gold and three Platinum albums to his name.

Williams hosted his own television show ‘The Andy Williams Show’ from 1962-1971. The show gave The Osmonds their big break in showbiz. He also started his own record label Barnaby Records in 1968 and was first to sign Jimmy Buffett in 1970.

It was Andy Williams who came to the defence of John Lennon in the 70s when Richard Nixon tried to have him deported. Ringo Starr used a caricature of Williams on the cover of his 1973 album ‘Ringo’.

Andy Williams announced that he had bladder cancer in November, 2011. He underwent treatment in Houston and Los Angeles but returned to his home in Branson, Missouri in July.

He is survived by wife Debbie and children Robert, Noelle and Christian.
