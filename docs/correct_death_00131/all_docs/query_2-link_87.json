        "text": "With a string of gold albums and the signature \"Moon River,\" Andy Williams was a voice of the 1960s in America, although not the '60s people usually hear about now.\n\n\"The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't there,\" the singer once recalled. \"Well, I was there all right, but my memory of them is blurred - not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself.\"\n\nWilliams' plaintive tenor, boyish features and easy demeanour helped him outlast many of the rock stars who had displaced him and such fellow crooners as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como. He remained on the charts into the 1970s and continued to perform in his 80s.\n\nIn November 2011, when Williams announced that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer, he vowed to return to performing the following year, his 75th in show business.\n\nWilliams died last night at his home following a year-long battle with the disease, his Los Angeles-based publicist, Paul Shefrin, said today. He was 84.\n\nWilliams became a major star the same year as Elvis Presley, 1956, with the Sinatra-like swing \"Canadian Sunset,\" and for a time he was pushed into such Presley imitations as \"Lips of Wine\" and the No. 1 smash \"Butterfly.\" But he mostly stuck to what he called his \"natural style.\"\n\nIn 1970, when even Sinatra had given up and (temporarily) retired, Williams was in the top 10 with the theme from \"Love Story,\" the Oscar-winning tearjerker. He had 18 gold records and three platinum, was nominated for five Grammy awards and hosted the Grammy ceremonies for several years.\n\nMovie songs became a speciality, from \"Love Story\" and \"Days of Wine and Roses\" to \"Moon River.\" The longing Johnny Mercer-Henry Mancini ballad was his most famous song, even though he never released it as a single because his record company feared such lines as \"my huckleberry friend\" were too confusing and old-fashioned for teens. The song was first performed by Audrey Hepburn in the beloved 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" but Mancini thought \"Moon River\" ideal for Williams, who recorded it in \"pretty much one take.\"\n\nAlthough \"Moon River\" was covered by countless artists, Williams made the song his personal brand. In fact, he insisted on it.\n\n\"When I hear anybody else sing it, it's all I can to do stop myself from shouting at the television screen, 'No! That's my song!\"' Williams wrote in his 2009 memoir, titled, fittingly, \"Moon River and Me.\"\n\n\"The Andy Williams Show,\" which lasted in various formats on television through the 1960s and into 1971, won three Emmys and featured Williams alternately performing his stable of hits and bantering casually with his guest stars.\n\nWilliams did book some rock and soul acts, including the Beach Boys, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson. On one show, in 1970, Williams sang \"Heaven Help Us All\" with Ray Charles, Mama Cass and a then-little known Elton John, a vision to Williams in his rhinestone glasses and black cape. But Williams liked him and his breakthrough hit \"Your Song\" enough to record it himself.\n\nWilliams' unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage.\n\n\"I guess I've never really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be,\" he once said. \"My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines.\"\n\nHis wholesome image endured one jarring interlude. In 1976, his ex-wife, former Las Vegas showgirl Claudine Longet, shot and killed her lover, skiing champion Spider Sabich. The Rolling Stones mocked the tragedy in \"Claudine,\" a song so pitiless that it was not released until decades later. Longet, who said it was an accident, spent only a week in jail. Williams stood by her. He escorted her to the court, gave evidence on her behalf and provided support for her and their children, Noelle, Christian and Robert.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, Williams was seen frequently in the company of Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's widow. The singer denied any romantic involvement.\n\nHe was born Howard Andrew Williams in December 3, 1927. In his memoir, Williams remembered himself as a shy boy who concealed his insecurity \"behind a veneer of cheek and self-confidence.\"\n\nWilliams began performing with his older brothers Dick, Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church choir.\n\nThe brothers eventually joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit \"Swinging on a Star\" in 1944 for Crosby's film \"Going My Way.\"\n\nWilliams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs.\n\n\"I had no money for food, so I ate it,\" he recalled in 2001, \"and it actually was damned good.\"\n\nA two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's \"Tonight Show\" and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around. In the 1960s. Williams later formed his own label, Barnaby Records, which released music by the Everly Brothers, Ray Stevens and Jimmy Buffett.\n\nWilliams was a lifelong Republican who once accused President Obama of \"following Marxist theory.\" But he acknowledged experimenting with LSD, opposed the Nixon administration's efforts in the 1970s to deport John Lennon and, in 1968, was an energetic supporter of Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign. When Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles in June 1968, just after winning the California Democratic primary, Williams sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at his funeral.\n\n\"We chose that song because he used it on the campaign trail,\" Williams later said of Kennedy, who had been a close friend. \"He had a terrible voice but he loved to sing that song. The only way I got through singing in church that day was by saying, 'This is my job. I can't let emotion get in the way of the song.' I really concentrated on not thinking about him.\"\n\nWilliams in 1992 decided to settle in Branson, Missouri, the self-proclaimed \"live entertainment capital of the country,\" with its dozens of theatres featuring live music, comedy and magic acts.\n\n\"The fact is most of my friends in L.A. still think I'm nuts for coming here,\" he said in 1998.\n\nRetirement was not on his schedule. As he said in 2001: \"I'll keep going until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage.\""
