        "text": "Andy Williams, known for his rendition of the beloved song “Moon River,” has passed away at 84. While his name may not be as familiar as some of his other contemporaries, like Johnny Mathis and Tony Bennett, his voice has been ingrained in popular culture for decades, especially thanks to his iconic recording of the perennial holiday favorite, “It’s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.”\n\nSimpsons fans will also know Williams as the crooner who could melt the heart of even Nelson Muntz; his music was used several times on the show, and the singer was happy to have been featured in the episode “Bart on the Road.” Williams made a couple of references to The Simpsons in his 2009 autobiography Moon River & Me, citing Bart Simpson’s description of Branson, Mo.—where he was living until his death—as “Vegas if it was run by Ned Flanders.”"
