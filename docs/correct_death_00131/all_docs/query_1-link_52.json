        "text": "Acquired\n\nRSL: Selected in first round (2nd overall) of the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft on 11/19/04\n\nCHI: Via trade with MET in exchange for a conditional pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft on 3/27/03\n\nMET: Via four-player trade with New England Revolution in exchange for Daniel Hernandez, Diego Serna and Brian Kamler on 5/24/02\n\nNE: Selected in the 2001 MLS Waiver Draft on 3/29/01\n\nMIA: Via trade with CLB in exchange for a first round 2000 MLS SuperDraft pick on 1/03/99\n\nCLB: Via MLS player allocation in 3/98Â\n\nAt 33 years of age, Andy Williams may be the âold manâ of the Real Salt Lake roster, but you wouldnât be able to tell after watching the latest of his string of recent renaissance campaigns in 2010. The wily veteran turned back the clock even more last year, when he joined Nat Borchers as the only members of the Claret-and-Cobalt to appear in all 30 League fixtures â a new career-high in his 12th professional season â and registered a team-high 12 assists across all competitions from his spot on the outside of the Utah sideâs demanding diamond midfield formation. While his numbers were impressive, it was once again Williamsâ qualities that canât be found on a stat sheet â an instinctual ability to keep the ball and his unique way of providing the calm so crucial to RSLâs possession-oriented style of play â which earned him high praise from his coaches and kept the fans on the edge of their seats every time the ball came his way.\n\nSince Jason Kreis took over on the RSL sideline in 2007, the teamâs entire roster has been replaced, save one man â and of all the players to stick around the longest, go figure itâs Williams, the player that once defined the moniker of MLS journeyman after suiting up for five different sides in his first seven seasons. As the lone âRSL Original,â Williams has continued to rack up stats that have placed him in or on the cusp of the Leagueâs career Top 10 in assists (8th), appearances (12th), and fouls suffered (3rd).Â\n\nMLS Career\n\n2010: Led the squad with 12 assists and added one goal in 38 total appearances (26 starts; 2,455 minutes) across regular season and Cup competition â¦ The 38 match appearances were 2nd most on RSL, behind only Borchersâ 39 GP â¦ One of only two RSLâers to play in all 30 League contests (w/ Borchers), during which he scored once and notched seven assists, the latter placing 2nd on the squad and counting as a single-season best during his six seasons in Utah â¦ Assisted on both of RSLâs goals during the Western Conference Semifinal Series v. DAL â¦ Finished the campaign at or near the top 10 on MLSâ career charts with 85 assists (8th), 301 appearances [12th (2nd among active players heading into 2011, four behind Jason Kreis)], and fouls suffered (635) â¦ Ended season as RSLâs career leader in games played (158), shots (194), shots on goal (70), and fouls suffered (224), while also ranking 2nd in assists (28), games started (102), minutes played (9,566), corner kicks (185), and game-winning assists (5) â¦ His three assists in five CONCACAF Champions League contests (four starts, 376 MIN) play led the Utah side â¦ His 1G/1A effort on 5/01 v. TOR was the 9th of his career and led RSL to a 2-1 victory â¦ The 42nd minute game-winning goal against the âRedsâ was the 7th of his career â¦ His game-winning assist on 5/22 @ CHV on Espindolaâs 89th minute winner helped RSL grab the lead back late in its 2-1 win and counted as the 20th of his career â¦ A week later on 5/29 v. KC, assisted on another Espindola tally (35â), this one starting the scoring in a 4-1 win that exacted revenge for RSLâs last Rio Tinto Stadium defeat 54 weeks earlier â¦ His ultra-productive 19-miunte stint off the bench on 7/31 v. DC produced assists on two insurance tallies (Findley â 79â, Gonzalez â 93+â) in RSLâs 3-0 win â¦ The multi-assist effort was the 14th of his MLS career, tied for the 7th most in League annals â¦ Helped salvage RSLâs MLS record home undefeated streak on 9/25 v. COL, his 35-yard chip to the spot finished off with Borchersâ backward header that equalized the Rocky Mountain Cup opener in the 94th minute â¦ Helped RSL to a dream start on 10/30 @ DAL in its West Semifinal opener, freeing Espindola for his 5â tally in an eventual 1-2 defeat at Pizza Hut Park â¦ Started RSLâs desperate comeback attempt in Leg Two on 11/06 v. DAL, helping on Findleyâs 80â goal in the 1-1 draw (2-3 aggregate loss).\n\n2009: Strong play in the final third of the season led to lone âRSL Originalâ finishing season with two goals and six assists in 23 GP (7 starts) â¦ Also added an assist during starting nods in all four of RSLâs postseason contests, his fifth postseason appearance finally rewarded with a first MLS Cup title â¦ Had 7 points (2G, 5A) in last 9 overall appearances, dating back to start on 8/29 @ KC â¦ His 1G/1A effort on 4/25 v.

DAL (1G/1A) â¦ Went 90 minutes on 4/28 @ SEA in RSLâs 1-4 loss in Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualifying play â¦ Granted a leave of absence from the squad to attend to family matters in early July and missed 7/11 v. Club America and 7/18 @ CLB contests â¦ Starts in four consecutive contests starting on 8/26 v. CHV marked first appearances in starting XI since 7/03 v. SJ â¦ Recorded an assist in 3 straight contests (8/29 @ KC, 9/12 v. CHI & 9/19 @ HOU), tying him with 8 other players for the 2nd longest assist streak in MLS in 2009 (Davis, HOU â 6) â¦ Recorded GWA on 8/29 @ KC, his unlocking pass in tight quarters leading to Camposâ 18â tally in the 1-0 win â¦ Played final 48 minutes of a contentious friendly on 10/07 v. CD Guadalajara (Chivas) (MEX) that ended in a 1-1 draw at Rio Tinto Stadium â¦ Late-season magic continued on 10/14 v. NY, as his 26-minute appearance off the bench culminated in an 80â game-winner in the eventual 2-0 result that kept RSLâs postseason hopes afloat â¦ Capped off regular season with pair of assists on 10/24 v. COL, his helpers on Findleyâs first-half brace (15â, 33â) lifting RSL to a 3-0 trouncing of its Rocky Mountain Cup rivals and a spot in the MLS postseason for a second straight season â¦ His short-corner cross turned goal in 74â on 11/05 @ CLB in Eastern Conf. Semifinal Series Leg Two all but sealed RSLâs passage, bringing the aggregate tally to its final 4-2 margin â¦ Goal was only his second in now 18-game playoff career (11/01/03 w/ CHI v. DC) â¦Turned in a gutsy performance in MLS Cup 2009 on 11/22 v. LA at Seattleâs Qwest Field, early midfield substitutions forcing him into the full 120 minutes of action in the 1-1 draw through regulation and added time â¦ After dropping to the ground in exhaustion, his clinching spot kick attempt in fifth round of penalties was saved, but ultimately did no harm thanks to RSLâs 5-4 PK triumph â¦ Result in Seattle gave the Jamaican a deserved first MLS title ring in just the 11-year veteranâs 2nd appearance in the Cup final (2003 w/ CHI).\n\n2008: Registered a goal and three assists across 26 regular season appearances (16 starts) â¦ Continued his US Open Cup mastery on 4/30 v. SJ, notching an assist and the closing goal (90â) in RSLâs 4-0 Play-In round win â¦ Broke club record for starts with his 70th appearance in the starting XI for RSL on 7/19 @ CHI (formerly 69 GS, Eddie Pope) â¦ Claimed another club record for shots with his 133rd for RSL on 7/28 v. TFC, a record previously held by current Head Coach Jason Kreis â¦ His first-time, upper corner blast on 10/04 @ NE not only snapped a 33-game goalless streak, but earned Sierra Mist Goal of the Week honors and was that dayâs #8 choice on SportsCenterâs Top 10 Plays â¦ Collected an assist in his Rio Tinto Stadium debut on 10/18 v. FCD, the late assist on a Robbie Findley goal helping to seal the 3-1 win and move the team closer to a playoff spot â¦ The helper also resulted in his first point-streak of the season â¦ It was his rebounded shot in the 90â on 10/25 @ COL that led to Movsisyanâs equalizer, helping to give RSL a 1-1 draw and, in turn, its first-ever postseason berth â¦ Made his first playoff appearances since 2003 with Chicago, featuring in all three of RSLâs postseason contests (one start) â¦ Started & played 67 min. on 11/01 v CHV in West Semifinal Series Leg 1, a 1-0 victory â¦ Made substitute appearances in WSS Leg 2 on 11/08 @ CHV (11 min.) and the West Final on 11/15 v.
