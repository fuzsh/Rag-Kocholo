        "text": "Police say a man shot and killed his girlfriend before turning the gun on himself in a Branson motel room.\n\nCameron Davis and Amy Dawson have been together for six years. Dawson's family members say the two had an abusive relationship and they feared this might eventually happen.\n\n\"I just tried to tell Amy she needed to be careful, and you just hope that your worst fears are not realized,\" said her mother Ruth Cameron.\n\nFor Cameron, that fear became a reality on Saturday night, when Branson Police were called to the Queen Ann Motel on the city's main drive.\n\nThey found Amy Dawson dead and her boyfriend, Cameron Davis, barely hanging on.\n\nDawson's mom said investigators told her Davis shot Amy in the head while she was sleeping. She said officers also told her he turned the gun on himself and shot twice, first aiming for his chest, but instead the bullet hit his lungs, so then he shot himself in the head.\n\nHe later died at the hospital.\n\n\"To not even have a fighting chance to be able to defend your own life is cowardly. It's very cowardly for someone else to take your life like that,\" Cameron said.\n\nShe explained the couple's relationship was rocky at times, but for the past few weeks, everything appeared to be fine.\n\n\"We tried to shelter Amy, but you have to let your kids live their own life, and it's a very hard lesson to let them do that,\" Cameron said.\n\nDawson was a Sperry High School graduate. The 27-year-old was a nurse with hopes of one day becoming a doctor.\n\n\"If you meet Amy, you'll just understand she's just bubbly, and even if you don't know her, you love her. She's one of those kind of people,\" Cameron said.\n\nBranson Police are still investigating what led to the murder-suicide, but investigators reportedly suspect the couple had been drinking heavily and smoking marijuana.\n\n\"She's tried some things in her life, also, but the ultimate end to her life was not something that was deserved,\" Cameron said. \"It was not something that anybody should have to go through, because you should never have to bury your child.\"\n\nCameron said her daughter was the glue that helped keep the family together, and it's tough knowing her little girl was taken too soon.\n\nThe family is headed to Branson, where they will meet with police Tuesday. Amy Dawson's funeral services are still pending."
