        "text": "BRANSON, MO (AP) – Emmy-winning TV host and “Moon River” crooner Andy Williams has died at age 84.\n\nWilliams’ publicist, Paul Shefrin, said Wednesday that the silky-voiced singer died Tuesday night at his home in Branson, Mo., following a year-long battle with bladder cancer.\n\nWilliams said in November 2011 that he was diagnosed with bladder cancer but planned to continue performing at the namesake theater he built in Branson in 1992.\n\nThe clean-cut Iowa native began singing with his brothers as a child, and his easy style and mellow voice led President Ronald Reagan to call Williams “a national treasure.” Though his version of “Moon River” made him world famous, it was among his many hits, including “Butterfly” and “Can’t Get Used to Losing You.”\n\n(Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.
