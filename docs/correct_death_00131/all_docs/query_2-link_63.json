        "text": "Andy Williams, who was the drummer for Christian rock band Casting Crowns for several years, has died after suffering injuries in a motorcycle accident. He was 49.\n\n“Early this morning, around 1:00am, Andy Williams went to be with Jesus,” read a statement shared on the band’s Instagram account on Friday (July 9). “He fought a great fight, but the injuries that he suffered took a toll on his physical body.”\n\nThe note continued: “You prayed along with us that Andy would be healed. You prayed along with us that Andy would wake up. You prayed along with us that God would perform a miracle. While we mourn that Andy isn’t here with us, and that we didn’t get to witness the miracle we longed for here on earth, all of our prayers were answered. He is healed, he is awake and we believe that he is more alive today than he has ever been. We hold fast to Paul’s words that we look not to the things that are seen, but to those things that are unseen, for they are eternal. We celebrate that Andy is in the arms of his Savior and we are grateful for the memories and laughter that Andy brought to all who knew him.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“We can’t thank you enough for your prayers, support, and unending love,” the post said. “You have walked with us through this very difficult journey and we felt you there the entire way. We love you so much and we thank you for the support. At this time the family has requested that you respect their time together and allow them to receive some much needed rest. Please hold off on reaching out with texts and phone calls for a few days.”\n\nCasting Crowns first told fans of Williams’ accident on June 27, when they wrote, “Our friend & former drummer, Andy Williams, was in a motorcycle accident this morning and really need your prayers!”\n\nOn Friday, the group posted a video of Williams drumming as a tribute to their late bandmate.\n\n“We love you Andy,” they wrote. “We miss you already!”\n\nA GoFundMe to support the needs of Williams’ family has been created, with the goal of raising $250,000. The page provided updates throughout his stay at the hospital, where he had been on a ventilator.\n\nWilliams is survived by his wife and children."
