        "text": "Donald Jay Williams, age 100, Branson, Missouri\n\nDonald Jay Williams passed to the Lord on December 30, 2022, after a wonderful life. Don was born on October 9,1922, the second of six children of Jay Emerson Williams and Florence Finley Williams. He grew up in Wall Lake, Iowa, where he learned the values of family life, hard work and playfulness. He loved being with his brothers and his sister, Janie.\n\nUnder the guidance of his father and with his brothers, Bob, Dick and Andy, Don performed in the groundbreaking act, The Williams Brothers. The brothers were major stars in the 1940's and 50's, singing background on Bing Crosby's hit \"Swinging on a Star\", and performing on stage, screen and recordings with Kay Thompson.\n\nHe served in the Merchant Marines on a High Octane Tanker Vessel until the end of World War II.\n\nDon's solo career included television and night club performances. He reunited annually in the 1960's and early 1970's with his brothers on the Andy Williams Christmas Show. The Williams Brothers Christmas Album was released in 1970. Later in his career, Don was a devoted agent and manager for many legendary performers including Ray Stevens, The Osmond Brothers, Roger Miller, David McCallum and Mary Tyler Moore. In 1991 Don moved to Branson, Mo. along with Ray Stevens to open the Ray Stevens Theater. For over 30 years he was active in the entertainment community in Branson.\n\nAbove all, Don was a man who loved life, his family and friends. He always greeted you with a beaming smile and he had a wonderful sense of humor. He loved sharing time with his wife Jeanne of 41 years, playing a round of golf with dear friends, or recreating his mother's homemade recipes.\n\nHe is the proud father, along with their mother Marilyn, of twin sons Andrew and David Williams. Don passed on a love and passion for music that even continues to his grandson Harrison.\n\nIn October Don celebrated his 100th birthday at his home with Jeanne and many dear friends who gathered to honor his friendship, contributions and dedication."
