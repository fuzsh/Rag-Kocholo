        "text": "BRANSON, Mo. — The Latest on a deadly tourist boat accident in Missouri (all times local):\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nThe nine members of one family who died in the duck boat accident were from Indianapolis, said Thomas Griffith, suffragan bishop of Zion Tabernacle Apostolic Faith Church in Indianapolis. He did not identify them.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson's office confirmed that nine of the 17 victims in the accident were from one family and two other family members survived.\n\nThe tourist duck boat capsized in stormy weather Thursday night on Table Rock Lake. Twenty-nine passengers and two crew were on board.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nA resident of the Missouri tourist town of Branson says she understands how a duck boat got caught on the lake before it capsized because of a sudden change in the weather that day.\n\nTrisha Ayers says Friday that she saw the weather change in 10 minutes Thursday from sunny to gale force winds that were bending traffic signs.\n\nThe duck boat capsized Thursday evening on Table Rock Lake with a thunderstorm in the area generating high winds. Seventeen people died.\n\nAyers called the fatal accident a \"fluke\" and said she hopes it doesn't tarnish Branson because most of its income comes from tourists.\n\nShe and her family moved to Branson 3½ years ago after visiting regularly from their previous hometown in the Kansas City area.\n\n___\n\n3:55 p.m.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson says nine of the 17 people who died in a duck boat accident are from the same family.\n\nParson spokeswoman Kelli Jones says Friday that another two members of the same family survived when the boat capsized on Table Rock Lake near the tourist town of Branson.\n\nThe governor's office had no other information about the family members. Authorities have not yet identified the victims.\n\nThe boat capsized Thursday evening when a thunderstorm hit the area and brought winds that approached near-hurricane speeds.\n\nTwenty-nine passengers and two crew members were on the boat when it capsized. The boat's driver was among those killed.\n\n___\n\n3:32 p.m.\n\nThe president of the company that owns the Branson duck boats says a sudden \"microburst\" of high winds apparently came up suddenly before one of the boats capsized, killing 17 people.\n\nThe accident happened Thursday on Table Rock Lake. The last of the victims were found Friday. Several local, state and federal agencies are investigating.\n\nJim Pattison Jr. is president of Ripley Entertainment, which owns the duck boat business. Pattison says the captain operating the boat had 16 years of experience, and the business monitors weather.\n\nPattison told The Associated Press that the water was calm and flat when the amphibious vehicle arrived at the lake, but a sudden storm emerged and \"turned it into turbulence.\"\n\nPattison says his company is \"sad\" and \"devastated\" by the deaths.\n\n___\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson says emergency responders and civilian rescuers helped prevent an even worse tragedy after a duck boat capsized on a lake and killed 17 people.\n\nParson spent Friday in the Branson area after the boat sank Thursday evening on Table Rock Lake amid high winds. He called the efforts of emergency responders and civilian rescuers \"courageous\" and said he was inspired by them.\n\nHe said people rushed in to help \"in extremely dangerous conditions.\"\n\nParson met with Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader and others leading the recovery operation before visiting the Cox Medical Center in Branson to meet with survivors and medical personnel.\n\nThe governor pledged the support of all state resources to help in an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says the agency has no authority to keep people or boats off of its lakes, even when bad weather approaches.\n\nSeventeen people died Thursday when a Ride the Duck boat capsized in Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri. The accident happened amid churning waters and stormy weather.\n\nCorps of Engineers spokeswoman Laurie Driver says storms tend to blow up quickly in the region of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas that includes Table Rock, but the agency must rely on people making their own judgments about the safety of setting out on the water.\n\nDriver says Ride the Ducks of Branson has a permit from the corps to operate on the lake.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nDoctors believe that two people in critical condition after a duck boat sank in a Missouri lake will survive.\n\nCox Medical Center spokeswoman Brandei Clifton says \"doctors are confident\" about their long term prognosis.\n\nThe two adults are in critical condition after nearly drowning in the accident Thursday evening.\n\nCox received seven patients Thursday. Two are those in critical condition, one refused treatment and the remaining four, including three children, were treated for minor injuries such as sore ears and general anxiety.\n\nClifton says the hospital treated the accident like a mass casualty event and called in extra staff in anticipation of a large number of patients.\n\n___\n\n2:40 p.m.\n\nA candlelight vigil is planned to remember the 17 people killed when a duck boat capsized in stormy weather in southern Missouri.\n\nSeveral pastors will be gathering at 9 p.m. Friday at Brookside Church in Branson, with a previously scheduled fireworks display to follow the vigil and prayers. The Stone County Sheriff's Office posted details about the vigil on its Facebook page. The post says, \"EVERYONE is welcome!\"\n\nThe Ride the Ducks boat sank Thursday night in Table Rock Lake after a strong storm generated wind gusts of 50 to 65 mph (80 to 105 kph) in the area. The Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.\n\nBranson is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City and is a popular vacation spot for families and other tourists.\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say it could take several days to raise a duck boat that sank in southern Missouri, killing its driver and 16 passengers.\n\nMissouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace says the vessel came to rest in 80 feet of water in on Table Rock Lake. Authorities initially said it would be raised Friday but Pace says it will take several days to get the equipment in place. He says investigators \"want to preserve evidence as best is possible.\"\n\nPace says the area has been secured and the investigation turned over to the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard.\n\nPace says divers indicated that the water visibility was better than normal, expediting the recovery of the victims' bodies.

He says Table Rock Lake seemed calm but that it \"suddenly got very dark.\"\n\nHe says he didn't think the duck boats would have a problem despite the weather because they are repurposed military vehicles. He says that when the duck boat capsized, people aboard the riverboat tried to guide the passengers to safety. He says he saw a woman holding on for \"dear life\" to one of the riverboat's paddles before being rescued.\n\n____\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued multiple severe weather warnings in the hours before a duck boat capsized in southern Missouri, killing 17 people.\n\nMeteorologist Kelsey Angle says a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for the area around 11:30 a.m. Thursday.

Red Cross officials are also there to help.\n\nBest says Branson, known as an entertainment center, is usually a city \"full of smiles,\" but that \"today we are grieving and crying.\"\n\n___\n\n11:25 a.m.\n\nInvestigators with the Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating a duck boat accident that killed 17 people in southern Missouri.\n\nCoast Guard Petty Officer Lora Ratliff says the agencies are working \"side-by-side\" to determine what caused the Ride the Ducks boat to sink Thursday night in Table Rock Lake in the Branson area.
