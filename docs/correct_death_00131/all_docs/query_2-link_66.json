        "text": "Andy Williams was a silky-voiced crooner whose music, showmanship, and long-running TV series made him a superstar in the â50s and â60s. Years after his death in 2012, his renditions of standards and Christmas favorites remain fixtures in pop culture. â¢ Born in Iowa, Andy Williams excelled at singing from a young age. Alongside his brothers Don, Bob, and Dick, he formed The Williams Brothers, a quartet that earned paying gigs and performed on the radio. â¢ Williams went solo in the early â50s and scored a major hit with 1957âs âButterfly,â which reached No. 1 in the US and the UK. â¢ The singer remained a reliable hitmaker through the â60s and into the â70s. He returned to the US Top 10 with âLonely Streetâ (1959), âThe Village of St. Bernadetteâ (1960), âCanât Get Used to Losing Youâ (1963), and âWhere Do I Begin (Love Story)â (1971). â¢ Heâs perhaps best known for his rendition of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercerâs âMoon River,â which he performed at the 1962 Academy Awards. â¢ In the US alone, Williamsâ sprawling discography includes three platinum and 15 gold albums. â¢ Over the course of his career, Williams earned six Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year for 1963âs Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests. He hosted the Grammys every year from 1971 to 1977. â¢ Throughout the â60s, Williams hosted the NBC variety program The Andy Williams Show. Thanks to his regular Christmas specialsâand his festive sweatersâhe became known as âMr. Christmas.â â¢ Williams died of cancer on September 25, 2012, at age 84. â¢ In the latter half of the 2010s, his 1963 holiday classic âItâs the Most Wonderful Time of the Yearâ began making the Billboard Hot 100 each December. In January 2021, the song reached a new peak, No. 5."
