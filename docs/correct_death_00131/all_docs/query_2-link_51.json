        "text": "Legendary singer Andy Williams, whose recording of Moon River launched him to stardom, has died after a year-long cancer battle.\n\nThe king of easy listening – who was tonight acclaimed as having “the most beautiful male voice ever” – was 84.\n\nIt was revealed that the father of three told his children in a heartbreaking farewell on his death bed at home in Branson, Missouri, last night: “Don’t be sad, just remember the way we were” – a reference to one of his songs.\n\nThe American crooner announced last November he was battling bladder cancer, while on stage at the Moon River Theatre he had built for the town in 1992.\n\nHe told fans the disease was no longer a death sentence and vowed to beat it.\n\nWilliams went on to perform two shows a night on six days of the week for nine months of the year at his theatre.\n\nThe star, who enjoyed 75 years in show-business, had 18 gold and three platinum records plus five Grammy nominations.\n\nFormer US President Ronald Reagan called his voice “a national treasure”.\n\nWilliams achieved his first hit in the early 1960s with Can’t Get Used To Losing You – but it was his celebrated reworking of Moon River in 1961 that finally set him on the path to global fame.\n\nHe notched yet further successes decades later when his songs – including Music To Watch Girls By and Can’t Take My Eyes Off You – were used in TV shows and adverts.\n\nWorldwide tributes poured in yesterday from fans and celebrities alike. They included singer Robbie Williams, who posted online: “God bless Andy Williams. RW x.”\n\nActress Liz Hurley said: “Thanks for the wonderful songs you gave the world.”\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell acclaimed his “sublime voice”, while Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball said: “May his star always shine bright.”\n\nSinger and US chat show host Kathie Lee Gifford said: “He had perhaps the most beautiful male voice ever. Perfect pitch.”\n\nWilliams was born at Wall Lake, Iowa, on December 3, 1927. His singing career began at the age of eight in church with his three older brothers.\n\nThey formed the Williams Brothers quartet and built their name on local radio stations.\n\n“I loved singing with my brothers,” Williams once said. “We had a wonderful family life. I just didn’t have any childhood.”\n\nIn 1952 he launched a solo career. New York club slots and appearances on TV led to a record contract.\n\nThe success of Moon River led to The Andy Williams Show, which ran on TV from 1962 to 1971 and for years as a Christmas special.\n\nHe won three Emmy Awards for outstanding variety programme.\n\nThere was a uncharacteristic scandal in the mid-1970s when his former wife, French dancer Claudine Longet, was tried for shooting her lover dead.\n\nWilliams accompanied her daily at the murder trial, where she insisted the shooting was an accident.\n\nLonget was eventually found guilty of criminal negligence and jailed for just 30 days.\n\nThe couple had three children together – Robert, Noelle and Christian. Williams wed second wife Debbie in 1991 and they remained married until his death."
