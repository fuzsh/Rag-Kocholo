        "text": "Members of Casting Crowns ask for your prayers as they mourn the loss of their friend and former drummer Andy Williams.\n\nWilliams was involved in a serious motorcycle accident Sunday, June 27, when he was struck by a vehicle while riding his motorcycle to church.\n\nAccording to the post, Williams was resuscitated at the scene and taken to a local ER. It was at that time that Casting Crowns members asked fans to pray for the drummer that he would recover.\n\nRELATED: Casting Crowns Asking for Prayer for Former Drummer Following Motorcycle Accident\n\n\"Early this morning, around 1:00am, Andy Williams went to be with Jesus\", Lead singer Mark Hall stated on social media. \"He fought a great fight, but the injuries that he suffered took a toll on his physical body. You prayed along with us that Andy would be healed. You prayed along with us that Andy would wake up. You prayed along with us that God would perform a miracle. While we mourn that Andy isn’t here with us, and that we didn’t get to witness the miracle we longed for here on earth, all of our prayers were answered. He is healed, he is awake and we believe that he is more alive today than he has ever been. We hold fast to Paul’s words that we look not to the things that are seen, but to those things that are unseen, for they are eternal. We celebrate that Andy is in the arms of his Savior and we are grateful for the memories and laughter that Andy brought to all who knew him. We can’t thank you enough for your prayers, support, and unending love. You have walked with us through this very difficult journey and we felt you there the entire way.\n\nWe love you so much and we thank you for the support. At this time the family has requested that you respect their time together and allow them to receive some much needed rest.\"\n\nWilliams performed and recorded with Casting Crowns during the band's earlier years. He left the band in 2009."
