        "text": "Singer Andy Williams has died at the age of 84.\n\nUSA Today reports that the legendary crooner passed away at his home in Brnason, Missouri on Tuesday evening (September 25) following a lengthy battle with bladder cancer.\n\nWilliams revealed that he had been diagnosed with the illness in November last year and vowed to beat the disease and return to the stage, insisting that cancer was “no longer a death sentence”. But a representative for the singer has now confirmed that he has succumbed to the condition.\n\nWilliams scored his first hit single in 1953 and went on to put out 18 albums which were certified gold and three which were certified platinum. In total, he recorded 42 studio albums and became renowned as one of the most popular vocalists of the 60s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his singing career, he also ran the Andy Williams Moon River Theater in his home town – named after the track with which he became closely associated – and in 1962 starred in his own TV programme, The Andy Williams show, which won three Emmy Awards.\n\nHis most recent hit single in the UK was a newly recorded version of ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’, which he re-recorded as a duet with singer Denise Van Outen. It reached Number 23 in 2002. Williams is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian."
