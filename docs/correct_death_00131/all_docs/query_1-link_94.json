        "text": "I was sitting in the waiting room at the dentist's office this morning when the young CNN anchor informed the world that singer \"Andrew Williams\" had died.\n\nThat would be Andy Williams, ma'am, as anybody who grew up in America in the 1960s would know.\n\nThe Iowa native's first brushes with fame came the decade prior; Williams scored a batch of Billboard top 10 hits from 1956 to 1959, including \"Canadian Sunset,\" \"I Like Your Kind of Love,\" \"Are You Sincere,\" \"Lonely Street,\" \"The Village of St. Berndadette\" and the No. 1 hit, \"Butterfly.\"\n\nThat led to his role hosting an NBC weekly variety show from 1962 to 1971. He had his name on a PGA tournament in San Diego, too, and continued to chart hits -- 27 that made the Billboard Hot Top 40 -- until 1972.\n\nBut Williams' signature song became \"Moon River,\" the pretty Henry Mancini composition of 1961.\n\nLovely. So lovely, that voice.\n\nI had the chance to interview Williams by phone to write a piece for The Post-Standard before his December 2006 holiday show at Syracuse's Landmark Theatre.\n\nAt 79 years old, Williams' voice was strong and lively as he talked about the upcoming show and his role as owner of the Moon River Theater in Branson, Mo.\n\n\"I have a gorgeous theater that I built, \" the veteran singer told me. \"It has everything in it that I love. It has art in it. Modern art. Folk art. American Indian blankets. Japanese wedding kimonos. Photos of me and all the stars I worked with, blown-up big things of me and Ray Charles and Bing Crosby, the Osmond Brothers, the Beach Boys.\"\n\nHe still loved golf, he told me.\n\n\"I live in Palm Springs (part-time) and play golf every day for three months, \" Williams said. \"My handicap is 18. It used to be 10.\"\n\nThat night at the Landmark, the crowd loved his wit and wisdom as much as his voice.\n\nI wrote in the next morning's Post-Standard:\n\n\" 'Does this look like a hairpiece? It's mine,' he said, yanking on his grayed locks. 'It's not my real color, but it's mine. My real color is dark brown, but I dye it just to look older. A lot of you do that, too.'\n\n\"Williams might be gray, but he's certainly full of vigor.\"\n\nThat show also inspired Warren Ottey to write the letter-to-the-editor, which was published in the Dec. 24, 2006 Post-Standard:\n\n\"Reviewer Mark Bialczak did not overstate his praise of 79-year-old Andy Williams, his instrumentalists and crew. His Christmas show, including spectacular lighting, sound and sparkling musical arrangements, went far beyond the expected.\n\n\"Even more amazing than Williams' energy and rapport with the audience was the youthfulness, clarity and beauty of his voice - especially considering he sings this concert every night for six weeks on the road!\n\n\"As a singer and choral conductor who was privileged to collaborate with Andy Williams and the wonderful folks who travel with him, I remain warmed, blessed and inspired by the entertainer and the experience. I am also grateful for Bialczak's comprehensive review of the concert and kind recognition of our chorale.\"\n\nEven five decades after his start in the business, Andy Williams knew how to keep America warm."
