        "text": "Singer Andy Williams has died after suffering from bladder cancer. He was 84.\n\nWilliams, who was one of the most popular vocalists of the 60s, died at home in Branson, Missouri, on Tuesday. He owned the Moon River theatre there, named after one of his signature songs (written by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini).\n\nWilliams was also well-known in the 70s and 80s for his Christmas TV specials in the US, and hosted the Grammys, the Golden Globes and the People's Choice awards many times. Former president Ronald Reagan once called him \"a national treasure\".\n\nThe singer broke the news of his illness himself at the Moon River theatre last November. Organisers had warned that he might not perform at the annual Andy Williams Christmas Show after he had cancelled a series of gigs owing to an unspecified illness. When he did appear on stage, he was met with a standing ovation.\n\n\"I do have cancer of the bladder,\" Williams told the crowd. \"[But] people with cancer are â€¦ kicking it, and they're winning more and more every year. And I'm going to be one of them.\" He then performed The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire), promising to celebrate the 75th anniversary of his singing career in 2012.\n\nReading on mobile? Watch here\n\nWilliams is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children by ex-wife Claudine Longet. Williams and Longet divorced in 1975; the following year she was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, alpine ski racer Spider Sabich in Aspen, Colorado. Williams made headlines as he stood by her side throughout the public trial.\n\nBesides 18 hit singles in the US, the singer enjoyed considerable success in the UK, scoring 14 top 25 singles including two hit reissues in the last 15 years."
