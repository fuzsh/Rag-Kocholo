        "text": "James Williams Branson, Jr.\n\nPolice Officer James Branson died of an injury he received when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident while in pursuit of a stolen vehicle.\n\nHe and his partner spotted a vehicle that had been taken a few hours earlier in a carjacking. When the officers attempted to stop the vehicle, a pursuit began. During the pursuit, the officer's police cruiser collided with a sport utility vehicle at the intersection of North Market Street and North Jefferson Avenue.\n\nOfficer Branson was treated for a broken ankle and had surgery on the ankle on February 14th, 2003, and was sent home to recover. On March 9th, 2003, he suffered a fatal pulmonary embolism caused by a massive blood clot that traveled from his ankle to his heart and lungs.\n\nOfficer Branson had served with the St. Louis Police Department for four years. He is survived by his wife and four children."
