        "text": "RIDGEDALE, Mo. (KY3/Gray News) - A tornado in Missouri was caught on camera by a group of golfers.\n\nGolfers at Payne’s Valley Golf Course near Branson, Missouri, witnessed the tornado while out on the course Monday afternoon. Videos were recorded as golfers raced away from the storm.\n\nIt is reported that golf carts were knocked down and trees were damaged during the storm.\n\nThe Payne’s Valley Golf Course is the first public-access gulf course decided by Tiger Woods, according to its website, and is named after World Golf Hall of Fame member Payne Stewart.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed in a Facebook post that a tornado touched down in the Branson area. The Western Taney County Fire Department said there was minor damage reported in connection to the storms.\n\nStorms rolled through parts of the U.S., including southern Missouri, on Monday, the Associated Press reported. Tornadoes were reported in Louisiana and major flooding was reported in the Alabama Gulf Coast and the Florida Panhandle, which saw the worst of the Monday’s weather.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, this is one of the most active periods for tornadoes on record."
