        "text": "Answer Man: I live in Rogersville country and like the leisurely drive into work in Springfield. There is a building project going up along Highway D (Sunshine Street) at Farm Road 205. What can you tell me about it? — Sandy Snyder\n\nIt will be a horse farm, Sandy, with a house, as well.\n\nThe owner is Debbie Williams, the widow of singer Andy Williams.\n\n\"I had a place east of Rogersville and I wanted to be closer to town,\" Williams tells me.\n\nThe number of horses she has varies. Usually, it's around five.\n\nWilliams, 64, in April bought the 60 acres through her company, No-Bull LLC.\n\nI drove out there Friday, and in the distance, I could see two barns being built.\n\nWilliams says there will also be a house.\n\nShe has homes in Branson and in Southern California, as well.\n\nPlans on file with Greene County indicate there will also be a machine shop.\n\nMORE: Yakov Smirnoff will be back in Branson this fall. Oh, and he's getting married.\n\nThe property, a couple of miles east of Springfield city limits, will have a looped road that tentatively has been named Rockin W Lane.\n\nAndy Williams died in September of 2012 at the age of 84 after a yearlong battle with bladder cancer.\n\nHis Moon River Theatre, in Branson, was sold in 2014 to Jimmy Osmond, who performed with Williams for years as a member of the Osmonds.\n\nThe theater is now called the Andy Williams Performing Arts Center and Theatre.\n\nWilliams opened the theater in 1992 and continued to live and perform in Branson until his death.\n\nDebbie Williams could not provide an estimate of when the new house will be finished.\n\n\"Soon, I hope,\" she says.\n\nMORE POKIN AROUND:\n\nBranson shoppers condemn Nike's decision to feature Kaepernick in ad\n\nWas there ever a time in Missouri when you could legally kill a Mormon?\n\nWhy is there an old, decrepit LA Times news box outside the main Post Office?\n\nKeep those questions coming. Send them to The Answer Man at 836-1253, spokin@gannett.com, on Twitter @stevepokinNL or by mail to 651 Boonville Ave., Springfield, MO 65806."
