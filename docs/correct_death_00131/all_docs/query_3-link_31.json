        "text": "An Abbeville native, who called Branson, Missouri his home, died in a house fire in Branson on Thursday.\n\nChuck Landry, 46, has been identified as the victim, according to a press release from Taney County Coroner Kevin Tweedy. Landry’s wife is in a hospital with serious burns.\n\n“Cause of his death is under investigation at this time,” Tweedy stated. “An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death.”\n\nThe fire department was notified at about 9 p.m. of a fire at 904 Hawthorn Road adjacent Alexander Park, according to Branson Fire Chief Ted Martin.\n\nMartin said when crews arrived, heavy flames were spotted. A fire captain and police officer began circling the structure for safety considerations, Martin said. The police officer spotted a woman on a second-floor living quarters’ balcony and proceeded to get her to the ground floor, or garage area, he said.\n\nOnce fire crews began working on the second floor, firefighters discovered a fatality, Martin said. Because a second victim was found, Martin said the fire crews struck a second alarm, which brought additional resources from the Western Taney County Fire Protection District and College of the Ozarks Fire Department.\n\nLandry was removed from the second floor, Martin said.\n\nLandry was born in Abbeville and had been playing drums since he was 7 years old. His father Dullis was a musician, and Landry played on stage with him in clubs throughout Louisiana once he turned 13 year old. He moved himself to Nashville at the young age of 16 to pursue a music career. He spent time performing with Doug Kershaw and Mel McDaniel.\n\nHe had the opportunity to relocate to Branson where he performed with his brother at the Silver Dollar City Theme Park. He was with a western swing band for 5 years and it was after that when he began his gig with Mel. Chuck had been playing drums for Mel Tillis and the Statesiders since 1988.\n\nHe is the son of Dullis and Ella Landry from Abbeville."
