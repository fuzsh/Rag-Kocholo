        "text": "Sad news to report from Branson: Legendary singer Andy Williams died Tuesday night. Andy Williams died at his home in Branson, Mo., after a year-long battle with bladder cancer, according to his publicist Paul Shefrin. He was 84.\n\nBorn in Wall Lake, Iowa, the son of a railroad worker, Howard Andrew WIlliams sang in his family’s church choir with older siblings Bob, Dick and Don. In the late ’30s, the boys built up a name for themselves regionally on Midwestern radio stations as the Williams Brothers quartet.\n\nWilliams launched a solo career in 1952 and had several hit singles, including his Oscar-winning rendition of “Moon River” from the film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” Moon River was one of Williams’ signature songs and a standard on KFFB 106.1."
