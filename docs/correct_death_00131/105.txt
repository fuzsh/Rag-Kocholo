Andy Williams singing “Moon River”.

Emmy-winning TV host Andy Williams and “Moon River” crooner has died at the age of 84. Williams died Tuesday night at home in Branson, Missouri following a year long battle with bladder cancer.

Williams was born in Wall Lake, Iowa and first sang at the local Presbyterian church and soon performed on WLS in Chicago. The Williams Brothers quartet (Andy, Bob, Don, and Dick) appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record “Swinging on a Star” (1944). The Williams Brothers appeared in four musical films: Janie (1944), Kansas City Kitty (1944), Something in the Wind (1947) and Ladies’ Man (1947). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson (starred in Funny Face with Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire) from 1947 to 1951.
