        "text": "Arizona Christian University's move west is in progress, raising excitement among Glendale leaders and anxiety among some living around the new campus.\n\nIn August, ACU students will arrive for the first time at the former Thunderbird School of Global Management at 59th Avenue and Greenway Road in Glendale. The university's campus was previously in north Phoenix.\n\nTo make way, the Glendale City Council on June 11 approved changes to the type of development and uses allowed on the campus and the vacant land around the campus that may become a new neighborhood. With the changes, more people will be allowed to live in the area, in dorms, apartments and homes.\n\nThe other changes that may happen as new development comes — taller buildings and new homes abutting existing ones — could have happened under the existing zoning rules, but never did.\n\nWith ACU, they are bound to come.\n\nGlendale Mayor Jerry Weiers said he was happy to approve the changes because he knows the university will be good for the neighborhood and the city.\n\n\"I think it's going to carry Glendale into a new era,\" he said.\n\nHere's what to know about the university's plan.\n\n1. 700 ACU students coming in August\n\nThe Thunderbird campus has been mostly empty since after the 2018 spring semester. Arizona State University, which owns the Thunderbird School of Global Management, moved its students downtown after that semester.\n\nACU's move to the Glendale campus has been an enormous undertaking, ACU President Len Munsil said.\n\nAfter finishing classes at the end of May, faculty and classrooms made the move.\n\nThe college expects about 700 students at the new campus when the new semester begins in August, Munsil said. That doesn't include the university's 800 or 900 online and dual enrollment students who don't attend class on campus.\n\nAt the old campus, the college was capped at about 620 students. Now, it has room to grow.\n\nThe goal is to eventually get up to 2,000, Munsil said, but that's years down the road.\n\nEven with 700 students, that's more than the Glendale community is used to seeing on the campus. There were about 400 graduate students left at the old Thunderbird campus as of December 2017.\n\n\"What's really exciting is to see these buildings that really had a shrinking student population over the last couple of years really come back to life,\" Munsil said.\n\n2. Army barracks torn down, new housing to come\n\nThe Glendale campus was originally a U.S. Army air-training base for World War II.\n\nThunderbird Field No. 1 opened in 1941 and shut down in 1945. The next year, the Thunderbird school opened on the site. Students learned and lived in many of the existing buildings, which were in the shape of the mythological thunderbird.\n\nThe barracks, for example, were used as dormitories or classrooms.\n\nWhile some original buildings remain in use, the barracks were eventually condemned because they had issues like asbestos.\n\nSince buying the campus, ACU has torn down five of those barracks to make room for athletic programs and fields, Munsil said. Other existing, single-story dormitories on-site will be able to house 500 ACU students come the fall, he said.\n\nThe plan is to grow from there. Munsil said ACU wants most students to live on campus, even as it grows.\n\nOn Tuesday, the council approved zoning that will allow for up to 1,400 student housing units on the site, which could be either dorms or apartments.\n\nResidents in surrounding neighborhoods are concerned about the height of these new buildings. Buildings on the campus now are mostly single-story.\n\nThe zoning allows just what it did before, a maximum of 56-feet-tall for all buildings other than student housing and 65-feet-tall for student housing.\n\nThe difference is, with ACU there, the buildings may soon reach that height.\n\n3. Some Thunderbird historic buildings will stay, others may go\n\nEver since the Thunderbird business school's move was announced, Ron Short, president of the Glendale Arizona Historical Society, has been pushing for preservation of the historic landmarks on the site.\n\n\"It's an extremely important historical landmark,\" Short told the council Tuesday.\n\nShort explained how more than 10,000 pilots from 30 nations were trained at the site to fight in World War II. Original buildings include an air traffic-control tower, Founder's Hall and one hangar.\n\nThe air tower had closed in 2006 for safety reasons but reopened in 2011 after Thunderbird students raised $2.5 million to refurbish the tower with a student lounge, pub, shop and other amenities.\n\nACU will use the tower as the student union, and it will become the \"hub\" of the campus, Munsil said.\n\nFounder's Hall is under review to decide whether it should be preserved, said Tabitha Perry, who works on special projects for the city's planning department.\n\nShort told the council that the hall and the hangar should be saved, and asked them to add this as a stipulation to the zoning approval.\n\nThe council approved the zoning without these requirements.\n\n4. New neighborhood will surround campus\n\nThe Thunderbird school owned nearly the entire square block between 59th and 55th avenues, and Greenway Road and Acoma Drive. When ACU bought the campus from the school in November, it only bought the developed portion of the campus on the northwest corner.\n\nThat left the Thunderbird school, now under ASU, to move forward with plans for a new neighborhood in the L-shaped vacant land around the campus.\n\nOn Thursday, the Glendale council approved a plan for what the university is calling The Village at Thunderbird.\n\nAn existing YMCA on the land will stay. ASU donated the land to the organization.\n\nThe rest will be a mix of 642 single-family houses, townhomes and apartments.\n\nWhile ASU owns almost all of the land in that square block, it doesn't own the strip of land along Acoma Drive. Single-family houses line the street.\n\nTo ease concerns of people living in those houses, ASU agreed in the new zoning to only build single-family houses abutting those houses.\n\n5. Glendale residents get some concessions, left wanting more\n\nA handful of residents at the recent council meeting reiterated concerns they say they've had all along about the new plan, including building height, traffic, building setbacks, apartments and fence heights.\n\nResidents didn't want the streets of the new neighborhood to exit onto Acoma Drive or 55th Avenue, which they say already have enough traffic.\n\nMike Withey, an attorney at Withey Morris who represented ASU at the council meeting, said that was a hard ask, but the planning team was able to make it so that all traffic would exit onto either Greenway Road or 59th Avenue.\n\nResidents along Acoma Drive wanted the new single-family houses behind theirs to have a fence two feet taller than theirs.\n\nWithey said the fence would be at least eight inches higher. He said because of the grade of the land, that may make it two feet higher than the existing fence.\n\nResidents were still unhappy with the building height and density of new development. The zoning used to allow for about 1,000 units total in the square block and now allows for 1,400 units on the campus and 642 units in the new neighborhood.\n\nReach the reporter at jen.fifield@azcentral.com or at 602-444-8763.
