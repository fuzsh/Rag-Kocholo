        "text": "Thank you to Dr. Geoffrey Boyle for this review of CCLE's Adopting Classical Lutheran Education: A Guide for Educators: \"Starting a new habit is easier than breaking an old one. And when it comes to schools, one might argue that it‚Äôs easier to start a new school than to turn an old one around. Raising money and finding a building are huge undertakings. But changing the ethos and mindset of a faculty, parents, and students‚Äîthat‚Äôs monumental. Nevertheless, many schools are embarking on just that mission. But how? Classical Lutheran education encompasses much more than just adding a class in Latin or reading older books. It‚Äôs a way of life, a set of instincts that runs its tentacles through every facet of the school. The transition from our parochial use of progressive education to a truly classical Lutheran education requires the grace of God, deep and thoughtful commitment, and a great deal of help from those who‚Äôve trodden this path before. That‚Äôs what Adopting Classical Lutheran Education: A Guide for Educators seeks to provide. After defining the need and offering help along the way to articulate what we‚Äôre seeking to adopt, the CCLE provides the necessary steps for how to make the transition. From the organizational structure of the school board and the aesthetic design of the classrooms to a thorough revision of the curriculum and its refinement through accreditation, this book seeks to apply the truth, goodness, and beauty of the liberal arts and Lutheran catechesis to the whole task of education. But it‚Äôs not just theory. The stories of those who‚Äôve already turned the ship reveal both the tremendous difficulties faced, as well as the hope and encouragement that it can be done‚Äîand done well! If you‚Äôre starting from scratch, have at it! But for those looking to break an old habit or turn a school back to its classical Lutheran heritage, this book is for you. Read it with your teachers and board members, your pastor and elders. Then join the countless churches and schools in the great task of adopting classical Lutheran education.\" Get your copy here: https://lnkd.in/gEunKQBT #ccle\n\nA Catholic ‚ÄúPrep School‚Äù? A critic of Pope John Paul II High School, a young diocesan school I led in Nashville for seven years, once told me, ‚ÄúWe were trying to create a Catholic Montgomery Bell Academy.‚Äù M.B.A. is a well regarded private school in Nashville. He intended the remark as a stinging rebuke‚Äîthat in so doing, we were betraying our mission. My response, to his surprise, was ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I believe it is entirely possible to be a first tier ‚Äúprep school‚Äù and to be thoroughly Catholic at the same time. Most of the Jesuit high schools in this country would be so characterized, as would many other schools led by religious orders. But is it possible for a diocesan school to be both? I think so. The sticky points are access and faith. Most ‚Äúelite‚Äù private schools are exclusive, primarily a function of their tuitions. According to its own data, National Association of Independent Schools have an average high school tuition of $30,000/year. They are also ‚Äúselective‚Äù in their admissions, though I believe for many it is less rigorous than they lead people to believe. Most ‚Äúaverage ability‚Äù kids can get in, particularly if they‚Äôre from well connected families. The illusion of selectivity is helpful for marketing and ‚Äúbrand.‚Äú The purpose of a diocesan school, in contrast, is to serve the Church, in all of its splendored diversity, both socio-economic and academic. So we cannot be ‚Äúexclusive.‚Äù But if we can aim tuitions to mid-market rates and create robust financial aid programs to assist families who cannot afford these rates, and if we can offer two levels of academic programs, honors and non-honors, then I believe our admissions efforts can be broadly tailored. And of course, we must be thoroughly, fundamentally Catholic. Our success isn‚Äôt ultimately measured by AP results, test scores, or college acceptances, but by whether we are creating disciples‚Äîyoung men and women of faith, wisdom and charity. But if access and mission are sound, I see nothing at all wrong with being a ‚ÄúCatholic M.B.A.‚Äù In fact, I believe that may even be a high compliment.\n\nNote: I sent the following email to Isaiah Crawford, President of the University of Puget Sound, my alma mater. Dear President Crawford: I am a 1987 alum of the University of Puget Sound and I haven‚Äôt donated for a while to the school since receiving the Autumn 2020 issue of Arches Magazine, which had the headline ‚ÄúTruth to Power: Amplifying the voices of the Black Lives Matter movement.‚Äù I wrote an article about my objections to this publication here: https://lnkd.in/eZV_33FA In response to my objections, one UPS staffer, whose salary my previous donations helped pay, told me on Facebook that it was my intention to turn UPS into the equivalent of Hillsdale College. At the time I objected to that characterization and to a certain extent, I still do. But the fact is, Hillsdale has an acceptance rate of 20 percent while Puget Sound has an acceptance rate of 80 percent, so on one level, yes, I do want UPS to be more like Hillsdale than it is now. Before I proceed, you should probably know that in 2021, I was mobbed by a group of leftists, many of them affiliated with the BLM/Antifa movements, in downtown Boston, in front of the ADL offices. It helps explain why I object so viscerally to colleges and universities being used as recruiting and staging grounds for violent protest movements that don‚Äôt seek to improve American democracy but undermine it. The punitive liberalism at the root of BLM and ANTIFA are poison to the U.S. republic. Reform-minded liberalism I can support and argue with, but the punitive liberalism that seeks to punish Americans for the sins of their ancestors I cannot support. This punitive impulse has been directed at Israel for many years and now it is being directed at the U.S. I write to you in light of the craziness that has taken place on college campuses throughout the country, with Jews being harassed and people applauding Hamas‚Äôs terrible acts of violence against Israeli civilians. Donors and alums are starting to wake up. Given how things proceeds at UPS, I might at some point start donating again, but only if I see good evidence that the institution is a place for learning and research and not the place of indoctrination that the Autumn 2020 issue of Arches portrayed the school as being. It's time for intellectual diversity at the school. What evidence is there that the school is something other than an ideological monoculture? I need to know. Sorry to be so abrupt, but it‚Äôs a legit question in light of the events of the past week. I‚Äôve Tweeted about this issue here: https://lnkd.in/eAdPKaeC Sincerely, Dexter Van Zile '87\n\nConfidence in our Mission! Catholic schools change lives! Do we really believe that? Then let‚Äôs say so, boldly and directly. Cocky? No! Here's why: In the story of blind Bartemaeus from the gospels, Bartemaues shouts out from a distance: ‚ÄúJesus, have pity on me!‚Äù Jesus hears him, but doesn‚Äôt go to him. Instead, he tells the apostles, ‚ÄúGo bring him to me.‚Äù So the apostles go to him and say, ‚ÄúTake courage, get up, Jesus is calling you.‚Äù And they bring him to Jesus, who heals him. We are ‚Äúministers, not messiahs,‚Äù as the Bishop Hunthausen prayer reminds us. We are not the ones who heal. Instead, we are the ones who say to our students, ‚ÄúTake courage! Get up, Jesus is calling you!‚Äù Our mission is to bring students to the Lord. Our confidence is not based on some egotistical belief in ourselves, but in the faith we have in Christ to change the lives of those we bring to him. Too often we project the opposite, especially if we‚Äôre struggling for enrollment or if our financial margins are thin: ‚ÄúOur hands are tied,‚Äù we say. Or ‚ÄúWe would if we could, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Our rhetoric limps. We stop dreaming. Unwittingly, we communicate to families that we are puny, and don‚Äôt have the \"power\" to fulfill our mission. We make this mistake, too, when we set our tuitions low. I know we do that out of our concern for our poorest families, and it's partly our legacy from the sisters, who worked heroically for very little pay. But if we present ourselves as the ‚ÄúDollar General‚Äù of educational choices, people will regard us as Dollar Generals. In a free market economy, people equate price with quality. I believe the path forward is to step-ladder to mid-market tuition rates, coupled with generous financial aid, ‚Äúelevating‚Äù our brand and paying our teachers better as we do so. Do we know that small schools generally out-perform larger ones? The data is consistent and widely available. At St. Michael, a school of just 350 students, I linked those research studies to our web site. Small schools know students in a personal way that is nearly impossible for larger schools. When we give tours to prospective families, for example, we should be deliberate in interacting with students: ‚ÄúGood hit yesterday, Johnny.‚Äù ‚ÄúNice point you made in class this morning, Bill.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was so excited to watch you at the ballet last weekend, Susie.‚Äù Help parents understand if they send their children to our schools, we will know them personally. I am not an expert in the martial arts, but my understanding is that ‚Äújujitsu‚Äù teaches people to use their smaller, more nimble size as an advantage, keeping their larger opponents off balance, using their own momentum against them. Smaller schools need to practice jujitsu! We‚Äôre often modest, to a fault. If we‚Äôre not loud, direct and bold about the power of our schools to change lives, our voices will be drowned out in the noisy marketplace. Let‚Äôs walk with a little strut and swagger in our step!"
