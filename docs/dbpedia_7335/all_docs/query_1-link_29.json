        "text": "Arizona Christian University can be found in Glendale, AZ, a nonprofit private college which focuses on only a select few programs offered. The small size of enrollment, which is around 1000 students, provides smaller class sizes for enrolled students.\n\nStudents can submit either the ACT or SAT scores to Arizona Christian University. A score within the range of 890 to 1080 on the SAT exam, or 15 to 21 on the ACT exam is among the 25th - 75th percentile range among accepted students. By applying sampled GPA data from over 150 schools, we are able to estimate that the Arizona Christian University average GPA ranges from 2.64 to 3.04 for accepted students. 68% of all those who apply are accepted to Arizona Christian University, from which 78 percent choose to attend. You can get more information from the admissions office website at arizonachristian.edu."
