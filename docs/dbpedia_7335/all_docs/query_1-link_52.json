        "text": "Arizona is among the top 20 universities for international students, and with its numerous universities, from public, to private, to community colleges, and its rich culture, it's easy to understand why. Colleges in Arizona have a wide range of highly ranked academic programs, including architectural design, information systems, business, earth science, criminology and criminal justice, journalism and others. Beyond academics, international students also have access to the scenic attractions of the Grand Canyon National Park, the Red Rocks of Sedona and Oak Creek Canyons to enrich their overall experience during their duration in Arizona.\n\nÂ» Visit the Study in Arizona, USA Guide"
