        "text": "Costa Mesa, CA- On Sunday afternoon at the Avenue of the Arts Hotel, 20 student athletes (one male and female from each school) were honored by the Golden State Athletic Conference as 2023 Cliff Hamlow Champions of Character. The ACU recipients were Taylor Schleisman (Softball) and Paul Hayden (Basketball).\n\nPer the GSAC website:\n\nThe Cliff Hamlow Champion of Character Award is given to one male and one female student-athlete on each GSAC campus who demonstrates outstanding athletic achievement, campus and community leadership, future ambition and embraces the five core character values of the NAIA Champions of Character program (Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Sportsmanship and Servant Leadership). Student-athletes must be at least a junior academically and carry a 3.0 GPA. The award is named after former Commissioner Cliff Hamlow who served the conference from its inception in 1986 to 2012. Dr. Hamlow was also a key leader in the creation of the NAIA's Champions of Character program.\n\nThe bios sent in for Schleisman and Hayden read:\n\nTaylor Schleisman, Softball\n\nTaylor Schleisman is a senior student-athlete on the Arizona Christian University softball team. Originally from Elizabeth, Colorado, Taylor has achieved outstanding academic and athletic accomplishments while modeling the five values of the Champions of Character program. Off the field, Taylor has served in a variety of ways in the local community, including service projects at St. Mary's Food Bank, Salvation Army, Coloring for Kids program, and Habitat for Humanity. On campus, Taylor helps coordinate the Athletics Leadership Chapels for Firestorm student leaders, volunteers to work at home football games, and leads Bible studies for the softball program throughout the year. On the field Schleisman was named to the All-GSAC team in 2022 and earned GSAC Scholar-Athlete honors. Starting all 47 games at second base, she hit .314 with 12 doubles, 38 RBIs, and 31 runs scored. In the classroom Taylor is working towards a degree in Behavioral Health, with plans to pursue a master's degree in Sport and Performance Psychology upon graduation. Head ACU Softball Coach, Mike Mayben, stated, \"Taylor puts in a great deal of work on the field and in the classroom. She has a passion for learning, understands the value of serving others, and her genuine enthusiasm spreads to everyone around her. Her positivity and integrity are evident in all that she does.\"\n\nPaul Hayden, Men's Basketball\n\nPaul Hayden is a junior leader on the Arizona Christian University Men's Basketball team. A native of Phoenix, Arizona, Hayden is pursuing a degree in Biblical Theology with plans to enter graduate school at Dallas Theological Seminary immediately after graduation before going into full-time ministry. On the court, Hayden is a starting forward for the Firestorm and averaged 13.7 points and 29 minutes per game through the first half of the season, and has been a key contributor for ACU while capturing two conference championships in his first two seasons. On campus, Hayden leads Bible studies every Monday night for ACU students, serves on campus clean-up teams, and serves with his team at the local community food bank. Paul also enjoyed the opportunity to preach at ACU chapel during the fall semester to the campus community. Additionally, he serves at North Phoenix Baptist church as the middle school director in the youth ministry program. Paul is also connected with a nearby Phoenix ministry, MAD House Ministries - an organization committed to providing urban young people a pathway to discover what they were created to be, using the sport of basketball as a vehicle to build mentoring relationships. Recently Paul traveled with MAD House Ministries to Palestine near Jerusalem to serve the local youth. While there, Paul helped lead basketball camps and skills training sessions, then shared the gospel with the kids and families while supporting the local church.\n\nCongratulations Taylor Schleisman and Paul Hayden on Hamlow Champion of Character honors well deserved."
