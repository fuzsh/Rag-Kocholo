        "text": "Meet the increasing needs of your community with an advanced degree from Dordt University, the Christian university known for student engagement.\n\nCourses are 100% online with both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities and are offered in the fall, spring, and summer terms.\n\nConnect With Us\n\nThe Advanced Generalist specialization is a good option if you're open to a career path that might take you into direct or indirect practice. This specialization allows you to pick and choose courses that are most interesting or seem most useful to you.\n\nCOURSES\n\nStudents will choose courses from the Clinical and Community Practice & Administration specializations.\n\nâI like the flexibility of Dordt's MSW program and the professors. They are available, supportive, and want to see you succeed. If you have any questions, you can email or do a zoom call and they will help you.â\n\nâLiz Moss, MSW student\n\nAbout Dordt University\n\nLocated in Sioux Center, Iowa, Dordt University is a Christian university committed to helping you serve in the real worldâright now, today.\n\nDordt University is ranked number eight on the âRegional Universities (Midwest)â ranking by 2023-24 U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges and is the top-ranked school in Iowa in the category. The mission of Dordt's Christian community is to equip students to work toward Christ-centered renewal in all areas of life.\n\nLearn More\n\nBecause your MSW plan of study will be custom tailored based on your interests and objectives, your time to complete the program may vary.\n\nA regular standing full-time plan of study typically takes 1Â¾ years (21 months), and a part-time plan of study typically takes 2Â¾ years (33 months) with 15-week semesters and two 7.5-week summer terms.\n\nAn advanced standing full-time plan of study typically takes one year beginning in the summer, and a part-time plan of study typically takes two years with 15-week semesters and two 7.5-week summer terms.\n\nPreference for admittance to Advanced Standing will be given to those students who completed their BSW degree no more than five years prior to application. If students completed their BSW more than five years before applying to the MSW program, they must demonstrate that they have engaged in continuing education and professional social work practice during the majority of the years since their baccalaureate education.\n\nA copy of the Field Evaluation from BSW field experience(s) documenting satisfactory generalist practice experience and skills in the internship is required. While prospective students may be admitted conditionally based on their performance in the field, full admission is contingent upon receipt of final field evaluation. When the final field evaluation is not available, the applicant must submit the Field Verification Form.\n\nStudents who have obtained a bachelorâs degree in an area other than social work will have regular standing."
