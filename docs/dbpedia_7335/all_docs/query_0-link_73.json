        "text": "Christian H. Kelly, DDS\n\nDr. Kelly is a 2008 graduate of Indiana University School of Dentistry, where he received the school’s Kem Award for Clinical Excellence, and the American Association of Oral Biologists Award, and was named a Hinman Scholar. He also represented the IUSD chapter of the American Student Dental Association, traveling to Capitol Hill to lobby our legislators for increased access to dental care for children. Additionally, he participated in numerous dental community outreach programs while in school, paying his own way to travel throughout the state and even out of the country to provide free dental care for children.\n\nOriginally from Idaho, Dr. Kelly grew up on a family farm where he learned the value of hard work. He served a two-year church mission in Argentina, where he became fluent in Spanish. Dr. Kelly completed his undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University, majoring in English, and minoring in Chemistry, Spanish, and Zoology. In addition to the time he devoted to his studies, he enjoyed cheering at college football and basketball games and playing intramurals.\n\nHe and his wife, Julie, have seven children and are actively involved in the community. In his limited spare time, Dr. Kelly enjoys reading, basketball, and water sports. He loves to spend time with his family and go on dates with his wife.\n\nDr. Kelly enjoys dentistry for many reasons. He loves to see complex cases come together in the best interests of his patients. He really enjoys educating his patients and helping them improve their oral health. He’s lucky enough to work with an office full of fantastic team members who are energetic and positive, and who truly care about their work. Most of all, he enjoys talking with his patients, and views them, first and foremost, as friends.\n\nDane T. Goodwin, DDS\n\nDr. Goodwin graduated from the University of Utah School of Dentistry in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2019. While in dental school, Dr. Goodwin served as class president while also participating in the Utah chapter of the American Student Dental Association. He also participated in many other community programs that provided dental care to those in need for little or no cost. After graduating, Dr. Goodwin traveled to the Dominican Republic where he received continued clinical training in dental implantology with the International Dental Implant Association. This training also allowed him to provide free dental implant surgeries to multiple underserved patients in the Dominican Republic.\n\nLike Dr. Kelly, Dr. Goodwin grew up in the state of Idaho. Although Dr. Goodwin didn’t grow up on a farm, he had plenty of opportunities to learn the importance of hard work, starting at the age of eleven when he got his first job moving irrigation lines. Dr. Goodwin served a two-year church mission in Brazil after graduating from high school. While in Brazil he became fluent in Portuguese, and after returning to the States he taught himself Spanish as well. Dr. Goodwin graduated with an undergraduate degree in Exercise Physiology and a minor in Chemistry from Brigham Young University-Idaho.\n\nDr. Goodwin and his wife, Kelly, have two small children that keep them both very busy. He grew up playing many different sports, and he especially enjoys baseball. He also loves being outdoors with his family, especially if the activities involve playing in the water, or, if it’s cold enough, the snow.\n\nDr. Goodwin has wanted to be a dentist since he was eight years old, and absolutely loves that he gets to live out his dream. He loves being able to get to know patients, and help them live healthier and happier lives by providing for their oral health needs. He feels that there is nothing more important than treating patients as if they were members of his own family."
