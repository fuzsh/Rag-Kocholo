        "text": "Private, catholic, college preparatory school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nSaints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School (Ss. Neumann Goretti for short) is a private Roman Catholic high school located at 1736 South Tenth Street in the South Philadelphia area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn fall 2004 Saints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School was created by a merger of Saint John Neumann High School, established in 1934, and Saint Maria Goretti High School, established in 1955.[3][4][5] The school is located in the former Goretti campus.\n\nSaint John Neumann High School\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint John Neumann High School was an all-male Roman Catholic high school located in South Philadelphia. Southeast Catholic High School opened at the intersection of Seventh Street and Christian Street in 1934. The school became Bishop Neumann High School, after John Neumann, in 1955. In March of the following year the school moved to 2600 Moore Street, its last location. In August 1978 the school became St. John Neumann High School to reflect Neumann's canonization. In 1992 Neumann had 853 students.\n\nThe former Neumann campus became St. John Neumann Place, a housing development for senior citizens.[6]\n\nSaint Maria Goretti High School\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint Maria Goretti High School was an all-female Roman Catholic high school located at 1736 South Tenth Street in South Philadelphia. Goretti opened in 1955. In 1992 Goretti had 970 students.\n\nMerge\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 1992 consultants told the archdiocese that Neumann and Goretti should be consolidated onto Neumann's site. By December of that year the archdiocese decided not to consolidate the two schools. In 2003 Neumann had 608 students, while Goretti had 683 students. By then the combined populations of both schools declined by 29 percent in an 11-year span. In March 2003 the archdiocese asked the faculty and staff of Neumann to consider merging or closing the school as the school had increasing deficits and a decreasing student population; Goretti had a stable financial situation. In June of that year the committees unanimously requested a merge. In September of that year Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the Archbishop of Philadelphia, decided that the merge should occur.[3]\n\nPost-merge\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005 most of the students at Neumann Goretti came from South Philadelphia.[3] During the first school year Neumann Goretti used the Neumann athletic fields.[3]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nChristian Barmore, American football player[7]\n\nJerry Blavat, radio personality[citation needed]\n\nMark Calvi, baseball coach (St. John Neumann)[8]\n\nQuade Green, basketball player[9]\n\nRick Jackson, basketball player[10]\n\nScoop Jardine, basketball player[10]\n\nDiamond Johnson, basketball player[11]\n\nJosh Ockimey, baseball player[12]\n\nJune Olkowski, basketball coach (St. Maria Goretti)[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nPhiladelphia portal\n\nPennsylvania portal\n\nSchools portal\n\nCatholicism portal"
