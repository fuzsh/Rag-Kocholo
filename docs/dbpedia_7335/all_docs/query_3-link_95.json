College of the Ozarks\n\nNet Price: $0\n\nThe College of the Ozarks (C of O) is a private, Christian liberal arts institution located in Point Lookout, Missouri on a 1,000 acre campus. Founded in 1907, C of O’s educational approach places emphasis on character-building. The College is committed to providing students with a quality Christian education, especially students who are found worthy but lack the means to obtain such an education. Accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, C of O has an enrollment of more than 1,400 with an average student:faculty ratio of 14:1. A variety of academic programs are offered including more than 25 majors, 36 minors, and several pre-professional programs.\n\nThe cost of tuition at the College of the Ozarks cannot be beat – $0 is charged to students’ accounts. Through the combination of state grants, scholarships and the school’s on-campus work program, the College is able to offer its programs without charging their students a dime in tuition costs. C of O openly discourages debt and does not participate in any federal, state or private loan programs. The College further leads by example by having no institutional debt of any kind. In order to help cover the cost of their tuition, students work 15 hours a week at an assigned campus work station plus two additional 40-hour weeks which are scheduled during seasons when class is not in session. As a result, C of O has earned the nickname of “Hard Work U”. The average net cost of a C of O education is $13,567. However, students are never charged this or any amount as the College guarantees to meet these expenses as long as they participate in the mandatory Work Education Program.\n\nRelated Resources:"
