        "text": "“Lions would have fared better, had lions been the artists” – Cardinal John Henry Newman\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Performing Arts department comprises five disciplines: Art, Theater, Chorus, Band, and Dance. Every Christmas, the Performing Arts department performs at the school’s performance venue, and every spring, the Fine Arts department culminates its work at the Palm Beach State College Theater. The department also travels in and out of state for various theme park festivals and competitions. Our arts department has received many Superior and Excellent ratings as well as first place accomplishments. Our students are exposed to many college directors and leading guest artists. More importantly, our students learn to express themselves in song, art, and dance; and are learning the intrinsic to extrinsic spiritual language that words cannot express.\n\nThe Art Department each year implements creativity in the various styles, modes, and materials of the visual arts world. Each semester the art department displays their work throughout the school for multiple projects, events, holidays, celebrations, and high holy days. Our arts students also contribute to the school musical each year in prop production and display their work at the venues for the end of semester performing arts concerts.\n\nThe theater department is composed of members of all the performing arts. Preparations start in November of each year. The musical’s peak season is at the end of the year. The season’s dress rehearsals and performances culminate over one week. Our theater students also compete in county and state solo and ensemble events and reviews.\n\nThe Cardinal Newman vocal department is the flagship of our faith in aural practice. The chorus is divided into three sections: mass ensemble, theater ensemble, and concert chorus. Within the three ensembles are chamber ensembles such as but not limited to: mixed choir, a ladies choir, and men’s chorus. The ensemble performs for local missions such as various civic and community service events, retirement and nursing homes. The group also performs two major concerts every year. Our choral students also participate in county and state events.\n\nThe Newman instrumental department is based on its concert band. The group also branches out into other disciplines such as jazz band, jazz combo, brass choir, woodwind choir, small chamber groups, and solos. Each year the band participates at the Florida Bandmasters Association concert band, jazz band, and solo and ensemble evaluations. Our students also participate at various college honor bands, county, and state honor band sanctioned events. They also perform for local civic community service events and parades. Our band students also proudly participate in the school’s mass ensemble.\n\nThe Theology Department at Cardinal Newman High School seeks to provide for our students a foundational experience of developing both their faith and reason. We follow the lead of our patron St. John Henry Cardinal Newman who wrote that: “A great memory does not make a mind, any more than a dictionary is a piece of literature.” More than minimally recalling information we strive to inspire our students to critically explore and put into practice the rich deposit of faith of the Catholic Tradition that has been passed on to us since the time of Jesus. We not only foster an opportunity of academic rigor but we also emphasize the importance of developing as people of prayer.\n\nJust as Jesus is both fully human and divine, we who participate in his life come to be more in touch with the full human expression of body, mind, and spirit, for the “Glory of God is the human being fully alive” (St. Irenaeus). The foundational curriculum texts that we use is from Ave Maria Press and follows the U.S. Bishops Curriculum Framework.\n\nThe principal areas of study are as follows for each grade. Freshman will have an introduction to the Old Testament in the fall semester and the New Testament in the Spring. Sophomores will explore the Sacramental life of the Church in the Fall and Morality and Ethics in the Spring. Juniors and seniors can follow four tracks, regular, honors, dual enrollment with St. Thomas University, and I.B. There is no AP religion available. Juniors study Catholic Social Teaching in the Fall and Church History regular and honors and History of Christian Thought I, dual enrollment, in the Fall. Seniors will participate in Christian Living regular and honors, Christian Lifestyle, dual enrollment, and finish with World Religion, regular, honors and dual enrollment.\n\nStudents at Cardinal Newman are also encouraged to put their faith in action. Though Roman Catholic, non-Catholic students have opportunties to participate in the spiritual life of the campus as well. All students are required to complete a minimum of 25 hours of community service each school year. Students are also invited to participate regularly in leading prayer over the loudspeaker in the morning, before lunch, or at the end of the day. Students will also be provided with opportunities to participate in class retreats as well as voluntary retreats such as the Emmaus and Liturgical minister retreats each year. Whole Masses are provided on Holy Days of Obligation and for special events, giving students opportunities to serve as altar servers, lectors, Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion, and in the Mass Ensemble. Morning liturgy is provided each day in the chapel at 7:00 am, student led prayer services online and class led prayer services are offered throughout the school year. Various clubs like the Life Club, Liturgical Club and Catholic Youth Group also give students opportunities to practice their faith.\n\n[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Dear Parents, Students and Staff,\n\nWe are happy to announce our partnership with Catering Solutions, a renowned catering company based in South Florida who uses Hotlunch.com to implement our online lunch order administration.

Our prime objective is to encourage informed, responsible and active participants in a democratic society.\n\nOur teachers foster an investigatory approach towards learning that places a premium on participation, analysis, and evaluation of historical questions and topics. We believe that learning a simple chain of chronological events does not help prepare the students for the increasingly fast, diverse, and challenging world they will be entering upon graduation. To enable them to do so, students need to master the necessary skills: critical thought, researching, interpreting documents and data, effective communication, and reading & expository writing. In any given Social Studies class at Cardinal Newman High School, you can see students engaged in discussions, encountering different viewpoints or experiences, and developing their ideas from a curriculum that is explored, not merely covered. Throughout all of their Social Studies coursework, students are consistently reminded how history is relevant to their lives.\n\nCardinal Newman High School Social Studies Department offers 14 courses:\n\nWorld History\n\nHonors World History\n\nUnited States History to 1900\n\nAP United States History to 1900\n\nAP United States History\n\nTwentieth-Century History\n\nAmerican Government\n\nAP United States Government and Politics\n\nEconomics with Financial Literacy\n\nAP Human Geography\n\nHonors International Relations\n\nAP Psychology\n\nThe Mathematics Department offers a sequence of rigorous courses that cover traditional college preparatory material and align with the Florida State Standards and the Palm Beach Diocesan Standards. The chief goals of mathematics instruction at Cardinal Newman Catholic High School are developing problem-solving abilities and understanding. The Mathematics Department believes that these are at the heart of mathematics and transfer to other academic areas and beyond. Through various instructional methods across all levels, students are introduced to and given time to practice concepts. The department assesses student performance primarily through individual teacher-created quizzes, unit tests, and cumulative midterm and final examinations.\n\nThe Mathematics Department believes that students need a balance between calculator and non-calculator problem-solving. When working analytically, students are expected to show their steps and explain their work. The foundations of algebra are essential to a student’s success and are an integral part of all levels of mathematics. The department offers a variety of courses to allow students to be successful.\n\nStudents must earn four credits in mathematics while at Cardinal Newman to be eligible for graduation.\n\nCardinal Newman High School has as its purpose the holistic education of each student in light of the Gospel values taught by Jesus Christ. Service to others and personal sacrifice were very important to Jesus and therefore, are an integral part of preparing our students for becoming positive role models in the community. This Community Service program is designed to enrich the lives of our students and the communities in which they live. Through successful completion of the program, the student not only helps others but also gains invaluable experience through working with a wide variety of non-profit organizations and in-school activities. Some students even return to work for the organization at which they volunteered. In addition, such service gives our students the necessary documented service which colleges expect from scholarship applicants.\n\nPlease be aware that failure to complete a minimum of 75 service hours by senior year may jeopardize your eligibility for the Florida Bright Future Scholarship.\n\nAll community service is logged through the Mobile Serve App or at https://www.mobileserve.com/. All students should have an account with their school email as their username. If you have any questions please email Mrs. Lower at karen.lower@cardinalnewman.com.\n\nAll underclassmen retreats are in the school Gym and Cafeteria, beginning at 8:00 a.m.\n\nThe Closing Mass is at 11:15 a.m. at Mary Immaculate Church.\n\nThe Senior Retreat has both breakfast and lunch that parents are invited to assist with. The Senior retreat breakfast is held in the Cardinal Newman Cafeteria from 7:50 – 8:25 a.m.; Lunch is at St. Edward’s Parish Hall, Palm Beach, from 11:15 – 12:15 p.m.; closing Mass is at 1:15 p.m. at St. Edward Church.\n\nParents receive service hour credit for donating food and serving food at the retreats. ($10.00 = 1 service hour.)\n\nParents interested in helping with the food for these dates are asked to contact the Home & School Class V.P. for your child’s class, or Mary Martens, Events Coordinator, in the Development Office at mary.martens@cardinalnewman.com."
