There are many things to consider, and the decision-making process should be careful and deliberate. When searching for and deciding on a school, students should consider many things, including their desired field of study, financial aid opportunities, student population, and public or private school type. The search tool below allows students to narrow this search according to these facts, making the decision process easier.\n\nCollege Readiness Programs in Arizona\n\nArizona is committed to improving student outcomes at all education levels, including college. Each university and community college has an outreach program designed to support college-readiness, as do several state organizations. The following state and private initiatives are available to students and parents planning for college.\n\nArizona Family College Savings Program\n\nThis state-sponsored plan from the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary offers families a flexible and tax-advantaged way to save for college. Parents or grandparents can start tax-exempt accounts for their future college students. Funds can be used at any institution accredited by the U.S. Department of Education, plus a handful of international programs. Savings plans start at as little as $15 a month.\n\nArizona Race to the Top\n\nArizona Race to the Top is the state's education reform program, funded by a $25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The goals of the program are to implement college and career readiness standards through educational training programs, to establish five regional centers of education to provide support and to ensure education reform.\n\nDropout Prevention Program\n\nThis Arizona Department of Education program aims to produce more Arizona high school graduates by improving residents' drop-out rate. It recognizes that all students should have equal access to opportunities and resources, and that all districts should have multiple ways for students to find success. The program leads the Education and Career Action Plan and offers an online toolkit that keeps students on track. Other online resources include strategies for dropout prevention and early warning signs and systems.\n\nScience Foundation Arizona\n\nThe Science Foundation of Arizona (SFAZ) is a non-profit organization seeks to diversify the economy by through an education system that aligns with state needs. The organization has given $110 million in support of more than 150 individual grants. Its STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) initiatives have helped more than 385,000 students. SFAZ focuses primarily on rural schools.\n\nCost Analysis of Arizona Colleges\n\nThe cost of an Arizona college degree depends on a number of factors, including residency, program type, course load and school choice. The graphic below will help prospective applicants compare Arizona college costs with those on the national level, and give an accurate idea of the percentage of students that receive financial aid.\n\n'\"Type\";\"Arizona\";\"National\"n\"In-State Tuition\";10650;9410n\"Out-of-State Tuition\";27490;23890'\n\nSource: CollegeBoard\n\n'\"Type\";\"Arizona\";\"National\"n\"Any Financial Aid\";69;63n\"Institutional Financial Aid\";77;78'\n\nSource: IPEDS\n\n'\"Type\";\"Arizona\";\"National\"n\"Any Financial Aid\";5690;9167n\"Institutional Financial Aid\";7634;12024'\n\nSource: IPEDS\n\n* Institutional aid represents grant and scholarship funds directly awarded by a postsecondary institution.\n\n* Financial aid data represents 4-year public and private nonprofit schools only.\n\nThe Most Affordable Colleges in Arizona\n\nCollege affordability is not simply a matter of tuition, though that certainly plays a role. Excellent financial aid, costs of living and other expenses all contribute to one's final cost—and the amount of education debt they'll likely carry. The information below highlights which Arizona colleges score best on overall net price.\n\nArizona College Net Price vs. National Average\n\nAverage\n\nAnnual Net Price\n\nSource: College Scorecard\n\nNote: Rankings/data represent 4-year public and private nonprofit schools only.\n\nBest Arizona Colleges for Maximizing Earnings Potential\n\nMany students' top priority when selecting schools and majors is their long-term return on investment.

In other words, it certifies that students can expect to receive an education on par with state and national standards. Arizona has multiple national and regional accrediting bodies, including the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education and the Higher Learning Commission. Some national, industry-specific organizations accredit individual college departments or degree programs.
