I love the fact that the teachers are called to teach and it is not just a job. The last two years our teachers have all been loving and supporting of our daughter. It is a blessing to see her not only learn academics but also about Christ. Having had experience with the public school system I would not go back to public. They have a lot to offer to parents in helping in the educational growth of our children. They keep us well informed and the facility is always nice and up to date.\n\n- Posted by Parent - debre\n\n5\n\nHigh academics extremely talented music dept. sports are amazing parent involvement is awesome!!!! The teachers and staff are amazing!!!!\n\n- Posted by Parent - wwarm\n\n5\n\nFCS offers terrific and caring teachers! Our sons have been at the school now for 10 years. The academics are challenging and prepare them well for college. Our oldest son tested out of 15 credits when he went on to Purdue! We also liked that the other students treat each other with respect and Christian love. The school encourages students to wait on dating so the students don't feel the peer pressure to pair up until they are much older. The school encourages group activities instead. Faith has a wonderful music program. The concerts are a delight to attend. They also offer drama and art. Faith offers a large variety of sports for boys and girls and has won many championships. We would definitely send our children here again if we had to decide all over again.\n\n- Posted by Parent - sanew\n\n5\n\nI would recommend this School! It's been a wonderful experience for our Son! He's in the 8th grade and has fit right in. All the Teachers and Staff have your child in their hands and handle it with love! We feel at home and wouldn't even think of leaving! Great School compared to TSC!!\n\n- Posted by Parent - pambe\n\n5\n\nFaith Christian School is a special place and unlike any other in the community. Having had personal experience with both the public school system and the Catholic school system, I can honestly say that Faith has so much more to offer. The culture within the school and at each school event is amazing. Everyone is held to the highest standards, those of humility and treating others the way we ourselves wish to be treated. This focus is embraced by staff and is imprinted on students and parents. I have never made a better investment in the well-being of my family.\n\n- Posted by Parent - thero\n\nEndorse Faith Christian School. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length.
