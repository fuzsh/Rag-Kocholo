        "text": "Grand Canyon University is one of the LEADING online universities in the world… click this GET MORE INFO link to receive specialized online program information straight from Grand Canyon University.\n\nSCHOOL’S HISTORY\n\nGrand Canyon University came from humble beginnings. Originally known as Grand Canyon College, it was founded by the Southern Baptist Church in 1949. In those early days, the school was located in Prescott, Arizona. Just two short years after opening its doors, the university moved to west Phoenix, where it is now located. Throughout the years, it became a well-known Christian university in the state of Arizona, and has continued to grow.\n\nIn 2004, the school became a non-profit institution, which allowed the university to better serve students by providing more course offerings and degree options for non-traditional students. Proof: Grand Canyon University Arizona is among the world’s largest Christian universities with more than 20,000 on-campus and 70,000 Grand Canyon online students (2018). Enrollment continues to grow and the school is currently in the midst of a huge renovation and expansion project.\n\nAs a for-profit Christian university, it’s recognized as the first of its kind in the United States as well as the first and only for-profit Christian university in the NCAA Division I athletics. While it has received approval to return to its original non-profit status from the Arizona State Board for Private Secondary Education, the IRS and its regional accreditor, the U.S. Department of Education still classifies it as a for-profit university. Currently, it maintains a partnership with Grand Canyon Education, Inc., a for-profit, publicly-traded corporation.\n\nACCREDITATIONS\n\nGrand Canyon University has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1968. The institution is also licensed by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education.\n\nOther current accreditations include:\n\n● Accreditation Council Business Schools and Programs\n\n● Arizona State Board of Education\n\n● Arizona Department of Education\n\n● Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education\n\n● Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education\n\nAs part of the university’s system, Grand Canyon College online also holds the same accreditations.\n\nONLINE PROGRAMS\n\nGrand Canyon University has prided itself on offering flexible learning schedules for both traditional and nontraditional students. In addition to offering day and night classes, the following programs are available in an online format:\n\n● Business and management\n\n● Criminal, political and social sciences\n\n● Engineering and technology\n\n● Language and communications\n\n● Medical studies and athletic sciences\n\n● Nursing and health care\n\n● Performing arts and creative design\n\n● Psychology and counseling\n\n● Teaching and school administration\n\n● Theology and ministry\n\nThe institution also has online learning options for professionals who already have a degree but want to brush up on certain skills by taking a single course or those who want to advance their current skills with continuing education coursework. These Grand Canyon University online programs are designed with convenience and flexibility in scheduling for working professionals in mind but without sacrificing on the quality of education for which the university is known for.\n\nGrand Canyon University’s online programs all feature a learning management system that acts as the hub for the learner. Students can virtually attend classes, turn in projects and receive feedback from professors, set reminders on their calendar, view how their degree is progressing, and interact with other students on specially designed forums. The learning management system also featuring learning tools and e-books students can use during their time in the program. Online learners can access these resources at anytime, making studying convenient and tailored to their schedule. Tech support is also available if students are having trouble logging on or submitting their assignments.\n\nIndeed, earning your Grand Canyon University online degrees – and we assume that there will be many considering that education is a lifelong quest – will always be a rewarding experience! Students are provided with the essential support services that are vital to their success as students as well as the competitive knowledge and skills crucial in their professional careers.\n\nWe also want to emphasize the excellent quality of education of the RN-to-BSN program, the master’s degree programs, and the doctoral degree programs. Suffice it to say that you can earn your baccalaureate, graduate and post-graduate degrees at GCU and be proud of it, too!\n\nFirst, the Grand Canyon University BSN online program has experienced a few ups and downs but it has emerged victorious. In 2017, the program was censured by Arizona nursing board officials for its graduates’ sub-par performance. By 2018, its graduates posted an impressive 96.65% pass rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). The year-to-date rate was 92.86%, a higher rate than the 91.89 year-to-date statewide average tallied by the Arizona Board of Nursing.\n\nIf you’re looking for an online Rn-to-BSN program with an exceptional track record, then check out GCU now! Students can earn their nursing degree within 12 months, enjoy 5-week classes for accelerated degree completion, and benefit from the convenience of online classes. Practicum hours and clinical rotations are conducted in the student’s local community, too.\n\nStudents can also request for full credit transfers of up to 90 credits through the free Lopes Credit Evaluation system. This means further acceleration of degree completion since credits earned in another school can be transferred to GCU’s RN-to-BSN program.\n\nThe RN-to-BSN program is open to interested individuals with either a diploma certificate or an associate’s degree in nursing. Students learn advanced nursing knowledge and skills vital in leadership positions in the nursing industry.\n\nHow much does the Grand Canyon University RN to BSN cost? According to the latest data, tuition for both the online and evening classes is $470 per credit and $120 for course material fee, which covers multimedia content, ebooks, and simulations content, among other supplies.\n\nGCU also offers a fast-track degree programs for students who want to earn both a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree and a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree within 30 months (2.5 years).\n\n.Second, GCU offers Master of Arts (MA) degrees in numerous fields:\n\nMA in Autism Spectrum Disorders\n\nMA in Christian Leadership\n\nMA in Christian Ministry\n\nMA in Communication with an Emphasis in Education\n\nMA in Curriculum & Instruction\n\nThese are available in on-campus and online programs, thus, allowing students to make a choice based on their learning style, lifestyle and learning goals. Students refine their skillsets so they are ready for the competitive workplace, improve their employability opportunities, and enjoy better compensation packages after graduation.\n\nHow much is the Grand Canyon University masters tuition? The actual GCU masters tuition depends on the number of credits enrolled in every semester, but the per-credit rate ranges from $365 to $695.\n\nThird, the Grand Canyon University online doctoral programs are known for their world-class quality of education, thanks to the topnotch instruction from professors who also have doctoral degrees. Students apply their critical and analytical thinking, research and problem-solving skills to theoretical and real-world issues. GCU policies require a dissertation from each student as a graduation requirement, and the courses are imbued with a Christian worldview as befits a Christian university.\n\nThe doctoral degree programs are:\n\nDoctor of Business Administration: Data Analytics (Quantitative Research)\n\nDoctor of Business Administration: Management (Quantitative Research)\n\nDoctor of Business Administration: Marketing (Quantitative Research)\n\nDoctor of Education in Organizational Leadership: Behavioral Health (Qualitative Research)\n\nDoctor of Education in Organizational Leadership: Higher Education\n\nHow much is the cost of GCU online doctoral programs? Post-graduate students pay $670/credit, but it can be reduced through discounts for active-duty and active reserve military members. Ask about scholarships and grants, too.\n\nPROFESSORS\n\nThe world-class quality of Grand Canyon online courses partly rests on the competence and credentials of their instructors. The university has both full time professors teach throughout the year from two locations. Online adjunct teachers cover materials for a five to eight-week period, depending on the coursework being taught.\n\nAside from providing excellent higher education for students, the GCU professors are fully invested in their students’ individual growth and success in and out of the classroom. Students report high satisfaction from the quality of instruction and involvement of their professors in their studies, often going beyond the call of duty.\n\nThe professors also acknowledge the challenges involved in balancing work, life and studies. As such, they offer flexibility in schedules and coursework while still maintaining the rigorous academic standards for which GCU is known for. Their use of student-centric resources in GCU online classes, such as ebooks, learning management system, and calendar reminders, also contribute to their efficiency as teachers.\n\nFINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nHow much is GCU a year? This is a valid question considering the private, for-profit status of the university. The Grand Canyon University cost will depend on the program of study – the bachelor’s degree programs have a different tuition structure from the master’s degree and doctoral degree programs. The Grand Canyon University online tuition, for example, is currently $395 to $470 per credit.\n\nFortunately, this isn’t too much of a big deal because Grand Canyon University has a wide range of scholarships and grants available to students. Direct start scholarships are available to high school graduates who plan to attend directly after high school graduation. Students must start with and maintain a specific grade point average to continue to receive funding. Indirect start scholarships are available to high school students who decide to start school later or to international students who do not have an F-1 visa. Students who qualify for this scholarship must attend school full time for the length of the scholarship.\n\nOther scholarships and grants currently offered include:\n\n● Canyon Christian Schools Consortium (CCSC) scholarship, which provides $5,000 per academic year to a student who completed their high school education at a CCSC school. To qualify, students must have a 3.0 grade point average, a 19 on the ACT or a 920 SAT score. Students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average and complete 20 hours of service each semester. This can be applied to the Grand Canyon University cost online tuition.\n\n● Grand Canyon University grant (for in-state students only), which awards $1,000 per academic year to students who attended high school in Arizona or have an Associate’s degree from a Maricopa County Community College.\n\n● Grand Canyon University grant (for out-of- state students only), which gives $250 per academic year to students who attended high school at one of Grand Canyon University’s affiliated high schools in another state.\n\n● Computer Science/Information Technology/Engineering Program grant, which provides $1,000 per academic year to students wanting to earn a degree in the fields of computer science, information technology or engineering.\n\n● Phi Theta Kappa grant, which provides $1,000 per academic year to students.

The grant renews based on the semester when registration was completed (spring or fall) and students must maintain a minimum grade point available to keep their eligibility.\n\nTake note that the Grand Canyon University tuition out of state is the same as the in-state tuition and as of this writing is $16,500 per year. But on-campus students have to pay other applicable fees, such as for room and board (average of $7,700) and additional fees ($1,600).\n\nAccording to the GCU website, the average on-campus student enjoyed a significantly decreased GCU tuition cost of $8,600 per year for the 2019-2020 academic year. Furthermore, GCU has implemented a tuition freeze for the last 12 years and counting.\n\nAs for the question, “How much is GCU online courses?” While GCU online tuition and cost of attendance isn’t the same as on-campus tuition, the difference isn’t significant. Both on-campus and online students can also apply for scholarships and grants.\n\nGCU also offers military scholarship opportunities via a special military rate (i.e., reduced per credit hour). The reduced rate can be availed by the military personnel and/or their spouses. GCU also offers discounted rates for military veterans and their spouses, as well as for active employees of DPHS, DOD and NOAA.\n\nThe tuition for GCU students in the Air Force and Air Force Reserves can also be reduced. Eligible students can enjoy discount of up to $250 per credit hour or $4,500 per year, for a maximum of 18 credits per year.\n\nSCHOOL AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS\n\nGrand Canyon University has earned a variety of accolades for its online programming, including:\n\n● Recognized as one of the top five online school for entrepreneurs by Fortune Small Business/CNN Money\n\n● Ranked as a national university, tier 2 college by U.S. News &amp; World Report\n\n● Ranked #281 by High School Counselors by U.S. News &amp; World Report\n\n● Grade A status for its online courses from College Prowler\n\nThe GCU online degrees are also part of the success of the university as a whole.\n\nTUITION\n\n(scale) $ = Affordable $$$$$ = Expensive\n\nGrand Canyon University = $$\n\nOnline tuition costs at Grand Canyon University can vary based on program and type of degree. Most online programs cost $470 per course, unless otherwise noted. For example, an undergraduate student going into the field of education can expect to pay $440 per course in the 2015-2016 school year. A graduate student going into the same program can expect to pay $515 per course in the 2015-2016 school year. Students who are currently serving active duty or in the reserve have tuition costs, at $250 per course. The school’s website features a calculator that allows students to estimate costs per semesters.\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE\n\nBeyond getting the answer to the question, “How much is Grand Canyon University tuition?” is the matter of total cost of attendance (COA). While the tuition, usually expressed in dollar amount per credit, comprises the largest part of COA, we must also look at its other components.\n\nCOA is defined as the estimated annual cost of attendance in a particular college or university. Its typical components include:\n\nTuition\n\nRoom and board\n\nBooks\n\nSupplies\n\nTransportation, parking fees and other related costs\n\nMiscellaneous expenses\n\nLoan fees\n\nGCU, like other universities, use COA in determining every student’s eligibility for financial assistance including scholarships, grants and loans.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Grand Canyon University tuition fee differs depending on whether a student is in an on-campus or an online degree program. Since online students stay in out-of-campus facilities, their room and board, transportation and other on-campus expenses are little to none. Their COA is then expected to be lesser than for on-campus students.\n\nAt GCU, vey few students actually pay the full COA due to the availability of financial aid programs.\n\nCAREER ADVANCEMENT\n\nThe Grand Canyon tuition and other COA components are well worth the price, too! Graduates enjoy a wide range of benefits, from gainful employment opportunities to a robust alumni network.\n\nAccording to GradReports.com, approximately 55 percent of those surveyed would recommend Grand Canyon University to others. Approximately 66 percent of alumni who left feedback said their degree helped their career. The school has a robust alumni program, filled with events that allows graduates to network as they build their careers.\n\n______________________________\n\nIN OUR RANKINGS\n\nTop 20 Online Christian Schools in America\n\nTop Accredited Online Colleges\n\n40 Online Degrees With High Salaries\n\nTop 20 Online Schools for Doctoral Nursing Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Schools for Master’s of Education Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Schools for Master’s of Curriculum and Instruction Degree Programs\n\nTop 10 Online Schools for Bachelor’s of Human Services Degree Programs\n\nTop 15 Online Schools for Master’s in Substance Abuse Counseling\n\nTop 20 Online Master’s of Elementary Education Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Master’s of Educational Administration Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Bachelor’s of Ministry Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Master’s of Nursing Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Bachelor in Religious Studies Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Doctor of Psychology Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Bachelors in Special Education Degree Programs\n\nTop 20 Online Accounting Degree Programs\n\nTop 10 Online Christian Colleges and Universities\n\nTop 20 Online Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree Programs\n\nThe 30 Most Innovative Online Colleges\n\nTop Online Bachelor’s in Sports Management Degree Programs"
