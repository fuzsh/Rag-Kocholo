Be challenged and challenge others to draw closer to God, in order to push forward the community and unity of students on the campus.\n\nMatthew from Peoria, AZ\n\nIf you are thinking about applying here, visit and go to a couple classes if you can. My visit is what sealed the deal for me. Once I saw where I would be living, I couldn't believe it. I visited a class and got to see the teaching styles of a few of the professors. There are a few times a year where you can come to an experience and stay in the dorms and go to classes. I highly recommend it. I also recommend getting good grades and working hard now, because it will pay off later in scholarships. Also, if you are interested in music or sports or any extra-curricular activity, check and see if there are scholarships for it! You can audition into the music program or try out for a team during an experience.\n\nBrianne from Prescott, AZ\n\nIt's a small school so if you want to be involved, this is for you!\n\nShae from Tucson, AZ\n\nGet on campus, get involved. Soak up as much as you can from your instructors. Find a mentor on campus and just learn as much as you can from their past experiences.\n\nKati from Surprise, AZ\n\ngive the school and yourself a chance to have a once in a lifetime experience by attending.\n\nNicholas from Peroia, AZ\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nStanford, CA\n\nTempe, AZ\n\nTucson, AZ\n\nGlendale, AZ\n\nFlagstaff, AZ\n\nAzusa, CA\n\nLa Mirada, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMalibu, CA\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nLakewood, CO\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSee All"
