        "text": "Costa Mesa, Calif.- On Sunday, the Golden State Athletic Conference celebrated their 16 recipients (one male and one female per school) of the 2024 Cliff Hamlow Champions of Character at the Avenue of the Arts Hotel. Emily Till (Women's Basketball) and Dominic Gonzalez (Men's Basketball) were selected as the Arizona Christian representatives. Till was chosen as the student speaker to speak on behalf of the entire group.\n\nPer the GSAC website:\n\nThe Cliff Hamlow Champion of Character Award is given to one male and one female student-athlete on each GSAC campus who demonstrates outstanding athletic achievement, campus and community leadership, future ambition and embraces the five core character values of the NAIA Champions of Character program (Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Sportsmanship and Servant Leadership). Student-athletes must be at least a junior academically and carry a 3.0 GPA. The award is named after former Commissioner Cliff Hamlow who served the conference from its inception in 1986 to 2012. Dr. Hamlow was also a key leader in the creation of the NAIA's Champions of Character program.\n\nThe bios sent in for Till and Gonzalez read:\n\nEmily Till, Women's Basketball\n\nEmily Till is a junior student-athlete on the Arizona Christian University Women's Basketball team. Originally from Canon City (pronounced Canyon City) Colorado, Emily serves her community in a variety of ways - including time invested at the St. Mary's Food Bank and the Feed My Starving Children local ministry organizations. Emily also serves in the youth ministry program at Canon Community Baptist Church when she is home during school breaks and serves at the Vacation Bible School summer program. On campus, Emily serves as a leader on the Firestorm's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and as a key leader of the University's Young Life organization. As a Young Life leader, Emily leads her peers through regular Bible study and coordinates community building activities for the campus ministry. On the court, Emily owns the single game rebounding record for the Firestorm with 20 rebounds. She is described as a \"game-changer\" when she is on the court for the Firestorm, starting almost every game this season and averaging 9 points per game and 11 rebounds per game. In the classroom, Emily maintains a 4.0 GPA while pursuing a degree in Behavioral Health. Her academic achievements have landed her on the academic honor roll and earned NAIA Scholar Athlete recognition. Emily is excited about her future career in speech language pathology, where she intends to serve children with special needs. ACU Head Coach Rusty Rogers comments, \"In 40 years of coaching, I have had very few student-athletes that have displayed Emily's love for others and leadership in such a consistent and passionate way. What she has accomplished on the court pales in comparison to what she does day in and day out representing Christ, her family, and Arizona Christian University.\"\n\nDominic Gonzalez, Men's Basketball\n\nDominic Gonzalez is a junior student-athlete on the Arizona Christian University Men's Basketball team. Born and raised in Glendale, Arizona, Dominic is pursuing a degree in Business Administration and a minor in Biblical Studies, earning a 3.59 GPA and NAIA and GSAC Scholar Athlete honors. Dom aspires a career engaging local youth through athletic and recreation opportunities, coaching and mentorship. On the court, Gonzalez has been a key contributor to the Firestorm's success over the past three seasons. After overcoming a season ending injury towards the end of 2023, Dominic persevered and worked his way back for the 2023-24 season - competing in every game for the Firestorm this season. On campus, Dominic serves as a leader of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, leads Bible studies on campus Wednesday mornings, and leads a small group at the Student-Athlete Leadership Chapels. Additionally, Dominic serves at his former high school as a mentor for the boy's basketball program to help guide and inspire local high school students towards achievement in education and athletics. During the summer, Dominic works with local youth and teaches basketball lessons to promote the game and teach life lessons. ACU Head Coach Jeff Rutter comments on Dominic, \"He has a calming presence within our team. He has been dependable, confident, and consistent as a leader on the team.\"\n\nCongratulations Emily and Dom on a well-deserved honor."
