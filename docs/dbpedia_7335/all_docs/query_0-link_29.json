        "text": "As Tarleton State University continues advancing as a premier comprehensive university, there are several “Designations of Excellence” we have been working to achieve. The Lozano Long Division of Global, Community and First-Gen Initiatives is proud to help lead and collaborate to the attainment of these exemplars of distinction.\n\nHispanic- Serving Institution (HSI)\n\nAs we are getting close to the required 25% enrollment threshold, our focus will be to seek the HSI federal designation. This federal designation will allow us to apply for Title III and Title V funding which will be used to expand services, programs, and resources offered to all Tarleton State Texans. This federal designation will also serve to recruit, retain, and graduate one of the largest enrolling student populations in the state of Texas.\n\nAn important component of the federal HSI designation is to center initiatives that ensure we are serving all students. To that end, the Division of Global, Community and First-Gen. Initiatives in partnership with the Department of Marketing and Communications, is proud to announce the availability of a Spanish translation option on the Tarleton State website.\n\nBy clicking the purple button on the university’s landing page, the content will automatically translate to Spanish, and display a dropdown at the bottom left of the page above the button. The dropdown feature allows the user to toggle to different languages using the “Google Translate” service. Clicking the button a second time refreshes the page back to English.\n\nFirst Scholar Institution\n\nLast year, Tarleton State University was one of 54 institutions nationally to be designated as a First Scholars Institution. Powered by NASPA and the National Center for First-generation Student Success, this designation recognizes institutions of higher education that advance practices which yield exemplary first-generation student success. Upon meeting milestones in the First Scholars phase, Tarleton State will now be seeking the highest first-generation distinction eligible to earn, the Champion Campus designation.\n\nMilitary Friendly® Campus\n\nMilitary Friendly® is the standard that measures an organization’s commitment, effort and success in creating sustainable and meaningful benefit for the military community. The term “military community” includes active-duty service men and women, those in the reserve and guard, veterans and military family members. The Military Friendly® ratings program was started in 2003 to encourage civilian organizations to invest in programs to recruit, retain and advance veterans as employees, entrepreneurs and students. There are four Military Friendly distinctions: Top 10, Gold, Silver and Bronze.\n\nA military-invested campus identifies and remove barriers to the educational goals of veterans to create a smooth transition from service to college to graduation, through support programs for student veterans based on their needs. (Selber, C; Benn, S; Chavkin, N; “Making the Campus Part of the Mission: Training Faculty and Staff to Support Student Veteran Success” The International Journal of Continuing Social Work Education, Fall 2021, V24 N2, Veteran Friendly Campuses, Vacchi & Berger, 2014, p. 124)."
