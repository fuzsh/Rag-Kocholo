        "text": "Your ACT score can play an important role in helping you qualify for scholarships that can fuel your future and help with college costs!\n\nACT test scores are a big factor in merit scholarships and awards based on academic achievement. On average, students who take the test more than once increase their score and can take advantage of an ACT Superscoring – using the average of your top scores from each subject from multiple test attempts to calculate a superscore reflecting your best efforts.\n\nWe've pulled together a list of more than 80 scholarships that require an ACT score. Using your early high school years to find a range of scholarships that intersect with your interests gives you the time you need to set goals and plan for success.\n\nA single test point can give you access to thousands of dollars in financial aid to pay for college!\n\nA good ACT score for scholarships will vary depending on your personal goals. Often, academic scholarships will require a higher ACT score than scholarships for extracurricular activities, athletic skills, financial need, or other criteria. Spend time researching scholarships to get an idea of an ACT score you would like to aim for.\n\nRemember that an ACT score is likely just one part of the scholarship application requirements. Applicants typically need to submit transcripts, a letter of recommendation, an essay, and more. Don’t count yourself out even if their desired ACT score is higher than yours."
