        "text": "NOTE: Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE), Hispanic-Serving Institutions Division identifies and publishes Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) eligibility annually. Generally, an HSI has an enrollment of undergraduate full-time-equivalent students that is at least 25 percent Hispanic and satisfies criteria for percentage of needy students and expenditures per full-time-equivalent undergraduate student. This table includes only institutions that are identified as eligible HSIs by OPE and are included in the IPEDS enrollment data collection. It excludes 13 institutions from the OPE HSI list that are branch campuses who do not report disaggregated data to IPEDS, have closed, or are no longer Title IV institutions. Data for Hispanic individuals include only persons who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Students for whom race/ethnicity was unknown were allocated to the reported race/ethnicity categories using the known proportion of students in those other reported race/ethnicity categories."
