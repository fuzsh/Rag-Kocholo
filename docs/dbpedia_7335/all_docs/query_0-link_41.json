        "text": "I thought my local Central Arizona College campus was fun to visit because it was close to where I currently live. The classes were engaging and easy to follow along, and my professors helped me a lot. The only thing is that it seemed like there was not a whole lot to do at my local campus except work on classwork. Compared to CAC's main campus, the campus I went to did not seem to have as many activities. It might have been because I was usually busy studying, so I was not able to think much about recreation time on campus. Even so, I had a great time attending Central Arizona College.\n\nCentral Arizona college was the perfect stepping stone for me to dive into the college experience before moving on to a university. Everyone I have encountered with both on campus and virtual has shown incredible patience and good citizenship when needed. The staff and students are always ready to be a helping hand."
