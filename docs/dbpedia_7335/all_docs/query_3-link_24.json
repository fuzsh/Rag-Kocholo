        "text": "Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Only a few schools require the SAT or ACT, but many consider your scores if you choose to submit them.\n\nArizona Christian University hasn't explicitly named a policy on SAT/ACT requirements, but because it's published average SAT or ACT scores (we'll cover this next), it's likely test flexible. Typically, these schools say, \"if you feel your SAT or ACT score represents you well as a student, submit them. Otherwise, don't.\"\n\nDespite this policy, the truth is that most students still take the SAT or ACT, and most applicants to Arizona Christian University will submit their scores. If you don't submit scores, you'll have one fewer dimension to show that you're worthy of being admitted, compared to other students. We therefore recommend that you consider taking the SAT or ACT, and doing well.\n\nArizona Christian University SAT Requirements\n\nMany schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.\n\nAverage SAT: 1008\n\nThe average SAT score composite at Arizona Christian University is a 1008 on the 1600 SAT scale.\n\nThis score makes Arizona Christian University Lightly Competitive for SAT test scores.\n\nArizona Christian University SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)\n\nThe 25th percentile SAT score is 1020, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1220. In other words, a 1020 on the SAT places you below average, while a 1220 will move you up to above average.\n\nHere's the breakdown of SAT scores by section:\n\nSectionAverage25th Percentile75th Percentile Math555500610 Reading + Writing500500600 Composite100810201220\n\nSAT Score Choice Policy\n\nThe Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.\n\nArizona Christian University ACT Requirements\n\nJust like for the SAT, Arizona Christian University likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.\n\nAverage ACT: 18\n\nThe average ACT score at Arizona Christian University is 18. This score makes Arizona Christian University Competitive for ACT scores.\n\nThe 25th percentile ACT score is 18, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 25.\n\nEven though Arizona Christian University likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 18 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.\n\nACT Score Sending Policy\n\nIf you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.\n\nHere it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.\n\nThis means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 18 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.\n\nACT Superscore Policy\n\nBy and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.\n\nWe weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Arizona Christian University, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 18.\n\nSAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements\n\nCurrently, only the ACT has an optional essay section that all students can take. The SAT used to also have an optional Essay section, but since June 2021, this has been discontinued unless you are taking the test as part of school-day testing in a few states. Because of this, no school requires the SAT Essay or ACT Writing section, but some schools do recommend certain students submit their results if they have them.\n\nArizona Christian University considers the SAT Essay/ACT Writing section optional and may not include it as part of their admissions consideration. You don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it."
