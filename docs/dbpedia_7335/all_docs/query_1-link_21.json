        "text": "For the seventh straight year, Arizona Christian University has been ranked among the nation’s Best Colleges by U.S. News & World Report – the most respected and comprehensive college ranking system in the nation.\n\nACU – which according to The Chronicle of Higher Education is the 9th fastest growing university in America with 76% growth over the past decade — was once again named a “Best College” in the West Region.\n\nIn addition, for the fourth year in a row, ACU’s commitment to excellence and affordability was recognized with a “Best Value” ranking. ACU was also identified again by U.S. News as a “Top Performer on Social Mobility,” recognizing its commitment to serving economically disadvantaged and first-generation college students.\n\n“We are once again blessed to see ACU be recognized for its academic excellence, affordability, and commitment to educating students who have historically been shut out of higher education opportunities,” said ACU President Len Munsil. “With campus enrollment exploding 13 percent in the past year, our reputation for authentic Christian community and elite private education in a small college setting continues to grow. Our conservative, biblical convictions, top-notch academic programs and engaged, supportive faculty continue to draw students from across America and the world who seek career and family success, but also really want their lives to count for the Kingdom of God.”\n\n“ACU faculty and staff are leaders in their field and dedicated teachers who are discipling the next generation of leaders,” said ACU Vice President for Academic Affairs Dr. Jeffrey Green. “I’m proud of my colleagues and the recognition ACU earned. It is a privilege to train a record number of students at ACU and work among great professors. With more new programs on the horizon, ACU continues to grow with excellence.”\n\nThe West Region includes colleges and universities from 15 Western states, including California, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington, and Oregon. Schools were ranked according to their performance across a set of widely accepted indicators of excellence including student-faculty ratio, graduation rates, and financial resources per student, among others."
