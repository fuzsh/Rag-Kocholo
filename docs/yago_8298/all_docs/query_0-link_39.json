        "text": "IN April of 1951, a new magazine with a blazing, canary yellow cover and a passionate sense of mission appeared on French newsstands.\n\nEuphoniously titled Les Cahiers du Cinéma -- or, in plain English, ''movie notebooks'' -- the new publication was the brainchild of three men, André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Lo Duca, who were deeply involved in the burgeoning film culture of postwar Paris. There were new ideas in the world -- new attitudes toward movies, about what they did and could do -- and Cahiers was determined to capture those notions and develop them into an aesthetic.\n\nFifty years later, Les Cahiers du Cinéma is still very much with us. The magazine's golden anniversary will be celebrated with a monthlong retrospective beginning Oct. 19 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center dedicated to the films that helped to shape Cahiers, and the films that Cahiers helped to shape.\n\nInevitably the series includes François Truffaut's ''400 Blows'' (1959), Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless'' (1960) and Jacques Rivette's ''Paris Belongs to Us'' (1960). The three films, each the directorial debut of a young Cahiers critic, were the beginning of the Nouvelle Vague, or French New Wave, an outpouring of creative energy that sustained the French cinema into the 1970's.\n\nEach of these three films, in a different way, embodies ideas developed in the rhetorically-charged pages of the magazine. Truffaut had been a teenage outcast and obsessive film buff when Bazin -- already an influential critic and theoretician -- took him under his wing. Though Truffaut quickly became known at Cahiers for the violence of his attacks on the dominant French cinema and his equally passionate defense of Hollywood filmmaking, ''The 400 Blows'' reflects the gentlest side of Bazin's teaching.\n\nTruffaut's autobiographical tale of an unloved boy (Jean-Pierre Léaud) growing up in working-class Paris embodied the call, by Bazin and others, for a more personal, diary-like form of filmmaking, a form that would present the point of view of a single creator rather than a corporate committee.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
