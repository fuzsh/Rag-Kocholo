        "text": "Interesting rules lawyering discussion happened in a game the other day.\n\nLet's say you are on a cliff next to water and there is a straight drop. You are engaged with a creature or player with Attack of Opportunity. Can you take a Step into open air, and fall into the water to prevent an attack of opportunity?\n\nSecondly if you can, then can you use a swim move or move if you have a swim speed?\n\n------------------\n\nSimilar scenario If it is true you can Step and fall to avoid AoO: Assume you have a fly speed. Can you step off the cliff. Fall, and then fly?\n\n------------------\n\nOne of the things we were unsure of is if an \"Open Space\" is considered Difficult Terrain.\n\nThank you\n\nYes, you can Step & fall w/o provoking. Combined with other abilities there are shenanigans one can tap into though they're situational at best.\n\nIf you have more actions, you can swim afterward. If you don't, I suppose you sink and have to swim upward on your next turn, which makes sense as most people do sink at first.\n\nWith flying, you either fall really far which makes it likely you hit a surface or if you have a Reaction, you can (thankfully) use that to pretty easily Arrest a Fall. Since the Trigger is \"You fall\", I'm not sure you'd fall much at all. This means your enemy might be able to engage you on their turn, though yes, if you have another action you could fly.\n\nUnsure why open space would be difficult terrain. If you've ever seen somebody absentmindedly walk off an edge, they're hardly slowed trying to \"enter the next square\" (whatever that means IRL).\n\nStep\n\nQuote:\n\nYou carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn't trigger reactions, such as Reactive Strike, that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.\n\nYou can't Step into difficult terrain, and you can't Step using a Speed other than your land Speed.\n\nQuote:\n\nUnsure why open space would be difficult terrain\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\nQuote:\n\nDifficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments.\n\nOpen air is unstable surface. Also; the word carefully is one of the reasons why it could potentially be considered to not meet the step intentions. It's not like you are absentmindedly walking off a cliff. You are [i]carefully[i] moving to avoid being put in a compromising situation. It's not like you are standing with the ground under your feet then the ground is no longer there. You would probably start falling as soon as one leg doesn't find ground. You could jump. But a jump action would provoke an attack of opportunity..\n\nI was trying to look for an interesting video. I couldn't find any useful videos of anyone carefully walking off a ledge / diving board etc.\n\nFWIW: I could go either way on the ruling.\n\nOpen air is not a surface, nor does it have substance to interfere with one's motion. And IMO getting into such pedantry means one's lost the thread, at least when it comes to Paizo's PF2 style of writing.\n\nThe absentminded example from IRL showed the lack of hindrance, not what a PC would be doing while Stepping. In genre, either fantasy or high adventure, being trapped at the lip of a cliff, parapet, ship, etc. often leads to characters casually stepping off the edge while adjacent to skilled enemies (the martial type that would have Reactive Strike).\n\nWhich is to say it's a trope, albeit minor.\n\n\"Carefully\" seems an odd word to hang an argument on as it's not a requirement nor condition that must be met. It has zero impact on how or when someone can Step and unfocused, haphazard characters can perform it as well as any careful one could. And since w/o a special ability one can't Step into difficult terrain, \"careful\" can't refer to navigating terrain (or lack thereof), but rather to considering one's enemies (et al) that might react to you.\n\nYes, \"You would probably start falling as soon as one leg doesn't find ground.\" That's the point. It's that easy. It's at least as easy as taking a typical Step back from one's enemies while holding them at bay (or whatever imagery one wishes for devoting so little time to moving that you leave zero opening).\n\nOne could describe one's Step as a short hop, such is narrative fluidity.\n\nPersonally I find the topic of \"free movement\" and \"free movement without AoO\" to be quite vexing and generally don't like to make broad rulings as a GM, and I don't like the \"RAW\" on the topic whatsoever, mind you it doesn't break the game, but it's very gamist approaches to combat.\n\n\"Oh, if I move more than taking a Step I'll provoke, but if I throw myself off the cliff I can fall more than 5ft and not provoke\". I really hate that kind of logic, and as GM I would totally tell you the enemy (assuming they have some sort of Attack of Opportunity ability) will get to use it.\n\nI have similar problems with flying and choosing to fall in air.\n\nThese are definitely rough patches in the system and I tend to rule on them as they come up with what feels right to me at that time. I should probably write them down to make sure I'm being consistent, but they don't actually come up that often.\n\nStepping off a cliff could be part of a shenanigan, yet it also could be an act of desperation that has nothing to do with \"gameplay advantage\", more \"It's Butch Cassidy time!\" because that's how desperate they are. And again, stepping off an edge to escape danger is a trope of both fantasy and high adventure (as is leaping, yes). Villains do it as well, and I wouldn't think less of a GM for that.\n\nIf somebody sought to abuse the extra distance gained, sure, I could see (and would recommend) a GM stepping in, hopefully before players begin investing in it! But otherwise, as noted, to say one can't Step off a cliff is to say one can't Stride off a cliff, and nixing both or only one seems silly, even arbitrary.\n\nAlso note that not sustaining one's flight so one falls at the end of their turn, perhaps w/ Catfall (et al) to avoid consequences, is a simpler way to exploit this crinkle in the rules. One might have to discuss gravity rules before it becomes an in-game meta-issue, though hopefully one's players game in good faith so it never would become one anyway.\n\nCastilliano wrote:\n\nStepping off a cliff could be part of a shenanigan, yet it also could be an act of desperation that has nothing to do with \"gameplay advantage\", more \"It's Butch Cassidy time!\" because that's how desperate they are.

To your point, those things have well established use in many stories. What I would rule though, is that your movement would still provoke from an ability like Attack of Opportunity. Basically my ruling is that moving is such a way, as to intentionally \"fall\" or get extra movement still provokes, whereas any kind of forced movement, including forced movement that includes a fall, doesn't provoke. Being moved by an ally is still kind of a grey area I take on a case by case basis. It thankfully hasn't come up too much.\n\nAnd again, any kind of gamist approach to movement using falling or any other means to gain free additional movement while negating all or most of the downsides is something that as a GM I'm not going to allow. Hopefully, a player would talk to me about their plan before trying to implement it. I might allow certain things to work as a one off or very occasionally, but if they are planning to routinely do shenanigans to gain additional movement I'd shut it down. Although if they are concerned about their build and had planned to do this for a long time (and it hadn't come to my attention previously) and now feel those abilities and selections aren't good, I would allow them to \"rebuild\" their character to remove those selections that pertained to this \"exploit\" that I removed."
