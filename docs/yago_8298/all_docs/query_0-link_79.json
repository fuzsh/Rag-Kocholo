Or films that I’ve not yet seen: Cerrar los ojos (Close Your Eyes, Víctor Erice, 2023), Los delincuentes (The Delinquents, Rodrigo Moreno, 2023), L’été dernier (Last Summer, Catherine Breillat, 2023), Poor Things (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2023). The above films are just the ones that come to mind this morning, and that I’d like to watch again tonight (on the big screen).\n\nJavier H. Estrada\n\nHead of Programming for SEMINCI Valladolid International Film Festival (Spain) and FILMADRID International Film Festival (Spain)\n\nDuring the recent months we have seen the emergence of a significant number of films that address silenced realities from original and risky perspectives. Cinema that defies the establishment, sometimes made clandestinely, such as Ali Ahmadzadeh’s confirmation as a key auteur, Mantagheye bohrani (Critical Zone, 2023); or the return of master Adachi Masao, Revolution+1 (2022), once again reflecting on the taboos of Japanese society. Inquiries into erased pasts, either starting from an intimate context, such as Asmae El Moudir’s resplendent debut, Kadib Abyad (The Mother of All Lies, 2023); or in a small collective, like André Gil Mata and his goldsmith piece Pátio do Carrasco (2023). But the most powerful and painfully realistic work of the year was Le gang des Bois du Temple (The Temple Woods Gang, 2022), another peak in Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche’s career, pointing out the omnipresent tentacles of the system, while vindicating the honest and unwavering camaraderie of the partisan.\n\nBest films of 2023\n\nLe Gang des Bois du Temple (The Temple Woods Gang, Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche, 2022)\n\nMantagheye bohrani (Critical Zone, Ali Ahmadzadeh, 2023)\n\nKadib Abyad (The Mother of All Lies, Asmae El Moudir, 2023)\n\nPátio do Carrasco (André Gil Mata, 2023)\n\nRevolution +1 (Adachi Masao, 2022)\n\nKuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nMon pire ennemi (My Worst Enemy, Mehran Tamadon, 2023)\n\nVildanden (The Wild Duck, Nadja Ericsson, 2023)\n\nChienne de rouge (Bloodhound, Yamina Zoutat, 2023)\n\nTótem (Totem, Lila Avilés, 2023)\n\nEssentials from 2023\n\nAqueronte (Manuel Muñoz Rivas, 2023)\n\nArthur & Diana (Sara Summa, 2023)\n\nGasoline Rainbow (Bill Ross IV, Turner Ross, 2023)\n\nI AM HERE!

It’s a terrible time we live in – as we attempt to fight off and resist the creeping tide of fascism here and around the world. Decency, fairness and equal rights are derided as “wokeness,” while racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-intellectual, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic hatred are codified as right wing “values” and used as political bludgeons, in ways that make the hysteria and tyranny of the Cold War era look like a civilized tea party. America is a truly scary place right now, but the majority of Americans are not being represented by those seeking to embrace fascism. Most of us are waiting (not so patiently) to have the opportunity to vote in the presidential election of 2024: so much rides on the outcome. In the meantime, artists, filmmakers and writers are actively responding to the political horrors of the day, making many superb films that often fly under the radar.\n\nSimon Foster\n\nFestival Director, Sydney Science Fiction Film Festival; Managing Editor, Screen-Space; Host, Screen Watching Podcast.\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2023\n\nAnatomie d’une chute (Anatomy of a Fall, Justine Triet, 2023)\n\nTaylor Swift The Eras Tour (Sam Wrench, 2023)\n\nPast Lives (Celine Song, 2023)\n\nGojira Mainasu Wan (Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki Takashi, 2023)\n\nPerfect Days (Wim Wenders, 2023)\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig, 2023)\n\nBeyond Utopia (Madeleine Gavin, 2023)\n\nReality (Tina Satter, 2023)\n\nNimona (Nick Bruno, Troy Quane, 2023)\n\nBottoms (Emma Seligman, 2023)\n\nOlder films encountered for the first time in 2023\n\nReal Genius (Martha Coolidge, 1985)\n\nLe dernier métro (The Last Metro, François Truffaut, 1980)\n\nCannery Row (David S.

Kuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nThe film you expect in the way you expect. Yet it is always surprising.\n\nIo capitano (Me Captain, Matteo Garrone, 2023)\n\nAn Italian film that manages to adopt the point of view of the marginalised to immerse itself in necessity, pain and hope. Rarity.\n\nA Thousand and One (A.V. Rockwell, 2023)\n\nAn urban drama that is not what it appears. It’s much worse.\n\nSaltburn (Emerald Fennell, 2023)\n\nThe second work that risks becoming excessive, but is so full of charm in its staging that it is a pleasure to see it.\n\nThe Holdovers (Alexander Payne, 2023)\n\nLike going back in time to make a New Hollywood film. Same scent. Same bitterness.\n\nCuando acecha la maldad (When Evil Lurks, Demián Rugna, 2023)\n\nMaking a horror film today is damn complicated, because there are no more new ideas. This Argentinian film has a couple of them and they are fantastic.\n\nKuru Otlar Üstüne (About Dry Grasses, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2023)\n\nThe usual painful characters searching for their place in a world (Turkey, but that’s just one case) that always presents unattainable alternatives.\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes, 2023)\n\nA subtle and very complicated film about guilt, the weight of the past, irrational choices and the entertainment society that tries to eat everyone in one bite. A relationship between protagonists such as hasn’t been seen since Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (1966).\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Laura Citarella, 2023)\n\nA mazy tale, a game of mirrors, perspectives that intersect and bifurcate. The childish pleasure of narration that is renewed from scene to scene and the sad awareness that the camera can never bear witness to the truth.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023)\n\nScorsese still digs bare-handed into the rot of the American psyche and brings out his first, too late, western of his career. To do first.\n\nOppenheimer (Christopher Nolan, 2023)\n\nNolan is beyond. Beyond History, beyond stories, beyond structures.

Ginnane has produced or executive produced 72 feature films, MOW’s, miniseries and TV series over 50 years\n\nTop 10 (Eligibility: 2023 films in theatrical, festival, premiere DVD or VOD or streaming first release in the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand) listed alphabetically by title:\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (Chad Stahelski, 2023)\n\nAlways incredible kinetic action blends with melancholy as this thrilling saga draws to a close.\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes, 2023)\n\nHaynes’ cool icy humour gets an extra edge as Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore duel with quips, tabloid disclosures and dashes of ‘50s melodrama.\n\nL’été dernier (Last Summer, Catherine Breillat, 2023)\n\nBreillat’s remake of the Danish Dronningen (Queen of Hearts, May el-Toukhy, 2019) is a pull back from the hard-edged sexuality of her previous work. Here, sensibility is visual and the drama is restrained.\n\nMaster Gardener (Paul Schrader, 2022)\n\nAnother Schrader redemption saga – a mix of violence, romance and introspection. The garden – plantation setting provides a hide out of sorts for hate and pain.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023)\n\nScorsese continues to explore the racist, violent underpinnings of American development, focussing on Osage exploitation and manipulation. Stellar performance by Lily Gladstone.\n\nThe Killer (David Fincher, 2023)\n\nFincher updates and remodels Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samouraï (The Samurai, 1967) with Michael Fassbinder as a paid assassin caught up in a maelstrom of survival mechanisms when a job goes wrong.\n\nThe Zone of Interest (Johathan Glazer, 2023)\n\nFull of alienation and nightmarish indifference, Glazer’s Auschwitz tale of a model Nazi and his family is chilling.\n\nAnatomie d’une chute (Anatomy of a Fall, Justine Triet, 2023)\n\nTriet’s twisty courtroom drama teasing the potential involvement of a woman in her husband’s death (or murder?). Like Preminger, Triet takes no moral stance and presents no clear answers.\n\nLimbo (Ivan Sen, 2023)\n\nA modern noir thriller spectacularly set around the otherworldly caves and mines of Coober Pedy as a decades old murder cold case is meticulously solved by a heroin addicted cop. The black and white cinematography is exquisite.\n\nPoor Things (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2023)\n\nLanthimos is back with another sci-fi fantasy – a Frankensteinesque study of a woman learning about life and her body, the world, pain and happiness. Off the wall humour coupled with stunning costumes; music and Emma Stone.\n\nOther titles that have excited or inspired me during the year include:\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water (James Cameron, 2022)\n\nNavalny (Daniel Rohner, 2023)\n\nEO (Jerzy Skolimowski, 2022)\n\nOppenheimer (Christopher Nolan, 2023)\n\nSisu (Jalmari Helander, 2022)\n\nThe Equalizer 3 (Antoine Fuqua, 2023)\n\nCarmen (Benjamin Millepied, 2022)\n\nTransfusion (Matt Nable, 2023)\n\nNapoleon (Ridley Scott, 2023)\n\nGojira Mainasu Wan (Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki Takashi, 2023)\n\nFerrari (Michael Mann, 2023)\n\nCoup de Chance (Woody Allen, 2023)\n\nSaltburn (Emerald Fennell, 2023)\n\nLeo Goldsmith\n\nWriter, programming advisor to the New York Film Festival, and Assistant Professor of Screen Studies at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, The New School\n\nMan in Black (Wang Bing, 2023)\n\nLast Things (Deborah Stratman, 2023)\n\nEl auge del humano 3 (The Human Surge 3, Eduardo Williams 2023)\n\nMast-del (Maryam Tafakory, 2023)\n\nThe Night Visitors (Michael Gitlin, 2023)\n\nAbattoir U.S.A.!

A Miami-set apocalyptic revenge thriller starring one of the biggest rappers on Earth (Travis Scott) shot entirely on an infrared lens. The film runs purely on vibes and will be a favourite amongst film brats worldwide once readily available.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed (Laura Poitras, 2022)\n\nI watched the much-deserved winner of the 2022’s Golden Lion in a relatively empty cinema in Melbourne earlier this year and was completely blown away. Laura Poitras was able to interweave the story of Goldin’s radical art career with her more recent fight against the Sackler family, capturing both the anger and the beauty in Goldin’s lifelong struggle.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (Chad Stahelski, 2023)\n\nNot a big fan of action, but the scene in Osaka is pure cinema.\n\nEO (Jerzy Skolimowski, 2022)\n\nI technically watched the film in 2022, but I also watched it again in 2023 and feel it deserves to be recognised once again. Although there is an element of bias shrouding this selection as the company I work for (Hi Gloss Entertainment) acquired and released the film, I can’t think of a more original and artistic film that graced screens in Australia this year.\n\nShowing Up (Kelly Reichardt, 2022)\n\nI’ve always been a huge fan of Reichardt and I found that her relatively low key 2022 film Showing Up to be the most accessible offering of her career to date and my personal favourite. Reichardt perfectly captures the micro side of the art world, which is filled with anxiety, jealousy and frustration and was able to find humour and heart amongst the mess instead of simply poking fun at it like most art-related dramas.\n\nKuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nThis was my first foray into the Finnish master of deadpan’s work and it left me wanting more. I sense some first timers may be put off by Kaurismäki’s quirks, but those who are willing will be in for a treat.\n\nPoor Things (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2023)\n\nI saw this in a rowdy public cinema in Venice, and like the thousand other people there, was completely blown away. This film is a revelation, a reminder that Hollywood can produce art once in a while.\n\nHitman (Richard Linklater, 2023)\n\nI suspect that a “Lido Cinemas recency bias” might be at play for some of my selections this year, but Linklater’s new film Hitman would’ve featured on this list no matter where and when it premiered. The funniest, sexiest comedy of 2023 and a pure tragedy that Netflix bought it. There is a theory in Melbourne that the “vibiest” place to watch a new release is the Monday evening session after opening weekend at Cinema Nova and I can’t imagine how much of a party that screening would’ve been for this film.\n\n80 For Brady (Kyle Marvin, 2023)\n\nAstonishingly directed Kyle Marvin, an acclaimed indie director who also starred in the superb The Climb (Michael Angelo Covino, 2019) which premiered at Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, comes almost definitely the most lowbrow film of 2023 80 for Brady. The pitch: four old Tom Brady obsessed women want to see their hero play in what looked like his last Superbowl. The result: a crude yet also oddly endearing comedy romp filled with literally every old age trope you can find. Was it good? No. Did I enjoy it? Very much so.\n\nZielona granica (Green Border, Agnieszka Holland, 2023)\n\nThe biggest shock of Venice 2023 was the triumphant return of the much-maligned Agnieszka Holland. Green Border is some of the most critical, powerful, and angry filmmaking that I have seen in some time. It reminded me of two other staggering films that also graced the Lido before it, Jasmila Žbanić’s Quo Vadis, Aida? (Where are you going, Aida? 2020) and Václav Marhoul’s Nabarvené ptáče (The Painted Bird, 2019).\n\nTop 10 Discoveries / First Viewings\n\nMiami Vice (Michael Mann, 2006)\n\nCaché (Hidden, Michael Heneke, 2005)\n\nSpencer (Pablo Larraín, 2021)\n\nHana-bi (Fireworks, Kitano Takeshi, 1997)\n\nThe Beach Bum (Harmony Korine, 2019)\n\nGokseong (The Wailing, Na Hong-Jin, 2016)\n\nQian xi man bo (Millennium Mambo, Hou Shaio-Hsien, 2001)\n\nWhat’s Up, Doc?

London, UK\n\nNew Films\n\nShowing Up (Kelly Reichardt, 2022)\n\nEternal damnation to the cowards who failed to bring Kelly Reichardt’s latest to UK theatres – though perhaps it’s unsurprising, considering its subject matter of the painful labour that goes into creating modest art with little commercial appeal. Wonderfully acted and observed, it’s a quietly monumental work from a quietly monumental filmmaker.\n\nL’été dernier (Last Summer, Catherine Breillat, 2023)\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes, 2023)\n\nHaynes’s approach was as academic as Breillat’s was uncomfortably intimate – but taken together, these two films about age-inappropriate relationships form the most successfully complex and provocative duet of 2023.\n\nRoter Himmel (Afire, Christian Petzold, 2023)\n\nAku wa Sonzai Shinai (Evil Does Not Exist, Hamaguchi Ryusuke, 2023)\n\nTwo dreams that curdle into beautiful nightmares, made all the more effective by their initial grounding in naturalism and humour. Song of the year: Wallners’ “in my mind”.\n\nNotre corps (Our Body, Claire Simon, 2023)\n\nSimon’s documentary distinguishes itself from the Frederick Wiseman approach with emphasis on the personal above the institutional – the filmmaker audibly asking questions at first, then placing herself front and centre with the (shocking) scene of her cancer diagnosis. A fascinating exploration of a feminine space.\n\nThe Swan (Wes Anderson, 2023)\n\nIf Anderson’s work has leaned towards twee since his 2009 adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr. Fox, then it’s appropriate that his adaptation of Dahl’s darkest short story works as a magnificent course correction, using his Brechtian formalism in service of a devastating reenactment of childhood abuses. The best final shot of the year.\n\nHit Man (Richard Linklater, 2023)\n\nThere’s no better proof of the (comedic, romantic) deficiencies in our collective film diets than Linklater’s successful crowd pleaser, in which Glen Powell and Adria Arjona demonstrate such novel concepts as “star power” and “chemistry”.\n\nThe Adults (Dustin Guy Defa, 2023)\n\nIf not quite as impressive a juggling act as Person to Person (Dustin Guy Defa, 2017), a nonetheless successful sibling dramedy, unafraid to alienate when appropriate. Hannah Gross and Michael Cera are both very good.\n\nAre You There God? It’s Me, Margaret (Kelly Fremon Craig, 2023)\n\nAnother increasingly rare breed of film, the light, detailed Bildungsroman. Rachel McAdams deserves all the awards.\n\nDiscoveries\n\nLa Belle Noiseuse (The Beautiful Troublemaker, Jacques Rivette, 1991)\n\nThe entire filmography of Buster Keaton\n\nCaught (Max Ophüls, 1949)\n\nCharley Varrick (Don Siegel, 1973)\n\nDaisy Kenyon (Otto Preminger, 1947)\n\nThe Damned (Joseph Losey, 1963)\n\nFrench Cancan (Jean Renoir, 1955)\n\nLes glaneurs et la glaneuse (The Gleaners and I, Agnès Varda, 2000)\n\nIdioterne (The Idiots, Lars von Trier, 1998)\n\nKiller of Sheep (Charles Burnett, 1978)\n\nThe Spy in Black (Michael Powell, 1939)\n\nThe workprint cut of Swing Shift (Jonathan Demme, 1984)\n\nTōkyō boshoku (Tokyo Twilight, Ozu Yasujirō, 1957)\n\nLe trou (Jacques Becker, 1960)\n\nRevelatory rewatches of Black Narcissus (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1947) Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958), and The Searchers (John Ford, 1956)\n\nFrancesco Grieco\n\nStaff writer for LocarnoDaily magazine, member of the selection committee for Presente Italiano Festival\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2023 (festivals, cinemas, streaming services, or other theatrical and non-theatrical contexts):\n\nLa bête (The Beast, Bertrand Bonello, 2023)\n\nLes chambres rouges (Red Rooms, Pascal Plante, 2023)\n\nEl Juicio (The Trial, Ulises de la Orden, 2023)\n\nKilling Romance (Lee Won-suk, 2023)\n\nKim’s Video (David Redmon, Ashley Sabin, 2023)\n\nKuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nKuru Otlar Üstüne (About Dry Grasses, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2023)\n\nNähtamatu võitlus (The Invisible Fight, Rainer Sarnet, 2023)\n\nQuslara xütbe (Sermon to the Birds, Hilal Baydarov, 2023)\n\nRoter Himmel (Afire, Christian Petzold, 2023)\n\nOlder films encountered for the first time in 2023 (seen in festivals, cinematheques, re-releases, home entertainment, streaming channels, etc.):\n\nLe Rideau cramoisi (The Crimson Curtain, Alexandre Astruc, 1953)\n\nLos hermanos Del Hierro (My Son, the Hero, Ismael Rodríguez, 1961)\n\nSmog (Franco Rossi, 1962)\n\nNothing But a Man (Michael Roemer, 1964)\n\nLe clair de terre (Earth Light, Guy Gilles, 1970)\n\nZiggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (D.A. Pennebaker, 1979)\n\nLes maîtres du temps (Time Masters, René Laloux, 1982)\n\nPirata! Cult Movie (Paolo Ricagno, 1984)\n\nTras el cristal (In a Glass Cage, Agustí Villaronga, 1986)\n\nTherapy Dogs (Ethan Eng, 2022)\n\nAny online or hybrid festivals or other events you ‘attended’ and that you felt presented a high-quality program and experience (and why?):\n\nIn 2023 I didn’t attend Venice Film Festival, but thanks to the Biennale Cinema Channel platform I could watch a very interesting movie, Lumbrensueño (Firedream, José Pablo Escamilla, 2023).\n\nVictor Guimarães\n\nFilm critic (Con los Ojos Abiertos) and programmer (FICValdivia, FENDA) – Brasil\n\n14 imaginary double bills in 2023\n\nThe Urgency of Death (Lucía Seles, 2023) + El Auge del Humano 3 (The Human Surge 3, Eduardo Williams, 2023)\n\nA poem written on a truck tire. A painting carved with the viscera of a broken computer. To tear up the grammar of cinema while generously teaching us how to speak an alien language.\n\nMusik (Music, Angela Schanelec, 2023) + Kuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nAn opera made of whispers. A rom-com made of silence.\n\nSeguro que Bach Cerraba la Puerta Cuando Quería Trabajar (Narcisa Hirsch, 1979/2023) + Cerrar los Ojos (Close Your Eyes, Víctor Erice, 2023)\n\nTo inhabit the insides of a mirror. To see with eyes wide shut.\n\nMãri Hi – A Árvore do Sonho (Mãri Hi: The Dream Tree, Morzaniel Ɨramari, 2023) + Mami Wata (C.J. “Fiery” Obasi, 2023)\n\nA documentary made with the matter of dreams. A frenzied futuristic fiction made with ancestral clay.\n\nL’Été Dernier (Last Summer, Catherine Breillat, 2023) + Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023)\n\nSome old masters still believe in making films for grown-up viewers. Some films still ask us to sustain our gaze against all odds.\n\nMul-an-e-seo (In Water, Hong Sang-Soo, 2023) + O Dia que te Conheci (The Day I met You, André Novais Oliveira, 2023)\n\nSome filmmakers can convert their styles into a home and, while feeling completely at ease there, decide to break down open doors. Intimacy and distance can rhyme. Love can be built through opacity.\n\nEjemplo #35 (Example #35, Lucía Malandro, Daniel Saucedo, 2023) + Huellas (Traces, Valeria Sarmiento, 2023)\n\nThe remnants of a collective experience can inhabit a film in mysterious ways. History can powerfully haunt us if treated in a way that respects the force of things left unsaid.\n\nIncident (Bill Morrison, 2023) + Por Trás da Linha de Escudos (Marcelo Pedroso, 2017/2023)\n\nTaking a walk on enemy territory can reveal so much about our allies.\n\nEl Polvo ya no Nubla Nuestros Ojos (Colectivo Silencio, 2023) + Todxs queremos un lugar al que llamar nuestro (We all want a place to call our own, Daniela Delgado Viteri, 2022)\n\nTo take the worn-out, appeased textures of contemporary experimental film and make it burn again in Latin America. To reinvent political cinema, again, from our perspective.\n\nHere (Bas Devos, 2023) + Las Cosas Indefinidas (Undefined Things, María Aparicio, 2023)\n\nThe materiality of tenderness.\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig, 2023) + Knock at the Cabin (M. Night Shyamalan, 2023)\n\nNo ready-made discourse can stand as long as there is a new image to be extracted from its dissolution. No ready-made belief can survive where cinema has taken the task of creating its own form of believing.\n\nLast Things (Deborah Stratman, 2023) + Celluloid Underground (Ehsan Khoshbakht, 2023)\n\nOur catastrophic world can still reveal infinite layers of poetry. Our dying star named cinephilia can still be a feverish delirium.\n\nW Ukrainie (In Ukraine, Piotr Pawlus, Tomasz Wolski, 2023) + Começo a Ver a Luz (I’m beginning to see the light, Melissa Dullius, 2023)\n\nThe images of war don’t tremble anymore. And that’s precisely why they can haunt us in unexpected ways. The images of love don’t shine anymore. And that’s precisely why they can still make us cry.\n\nRamal (Time to ride, Higor Gomes, 2023) + Ramona (Victoria Linares Villegas, 2023)\n\nTo tear up the documentary form to embrace the indeterminacy of life. There are few things more cinematic than youthful energy.\n\n7 Latin American masterpieces seen for the first time in 2023\n\nLa Mujer de Nadie (Nobody’s Wife, Adelia Sequeyro, 1937)\n\nA non-monogamist set of people trying to love each other in 1930s Mexico and banging their heads against a wall called society. Care, attention, and desire flowing in all directions until they can’t.\n\nUn Día Feriado (Lydia García Millán, 1951)\n\nAn experimental journey through the margins of a big city long before that gesture became a major source of masterpieces among us.\n\nLa Fórmula Secreta (The Secret Formula, Rubén Gámez, 1965)\n\nIdeological ethnography meets allegorical sur-realism.\n\nLupe (José Rodríguez Soltero, 1967)\n\nAn experimental melodrama where the wild strength of a dissident life meets the incendiary power of dissident images and sounds.\n\nEl Otro Francisco (The Other Francisco, Sergio Giral, 1975)\n\nWherever you want character development, Giral gives you distancing effects. Wherever you want sentimental music, Leo Brower gives you pieces of silence and noise. Wherever you want love, the film gives you means of production. A horror movie, but one that’s made of the economic reports of a plantation.\n\nThe Terror and the Time (The Victor Jara Collective, 1978)\n\nCounter-information and lyric poetry are not opposed, but rather contaminate each other. A cinematic tissue where rapid-fire montages of popular revolutions all around the Third World and slow-motion sur-real depictions of Guyanese faces and landscapes can harmoniously coexist. Not a historical lesson nor a political statement, but a material, living experience that swallows our whole body and makes us dream together. Not dreaming of changing the world. Dreaming to change the world."
