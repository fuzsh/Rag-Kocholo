        "text": "A writer, director and filmmaker, Alexandre Astruc has embodied the brilliant and passionate Saint-Germain-des-Prés, from his early love of mathematics to film creation.\n\nWith his first film, « The Crimson Curtain», who won the Louis Delluc Prize, he offered one of his first major roles to a wonderful actress, Anouk Aimée. We also owe him beautiful adaptations of Flaubert and Maupassant.\n\nThe six hours of interviews with Jean-Paul Sartre that he filmed in collaboration with Michel Contat are a great moment of intelligence.\n\nFor all film lovers, Alexandre Astruc is also the author of a memorable article written in 1948 in which he highlighted the concept of «pen camera» which claimed for cinema, with its own means, the ability to express a thought with as much precision and evocative power as an essay or a novel, and laid the theoretical foundations of a true auteur cinema."
