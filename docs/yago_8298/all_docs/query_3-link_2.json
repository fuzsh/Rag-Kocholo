        "text": "August 6, 2024\n\nI enjoyed this a lot but I wish I had known it is part of a series/ends on a bit of a cliffhanger 😖\n\nIf the goal was to get me to pre-order book 2…well played\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nDNF - The FMC was really unlikeable and there was nothing to make you want to invest in any of the other characters. I got about half way through and gave up and on it.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nBehind the Crimson Curtain by E.B. Golden is dreamy, poetic, and dramatic in all the best ways. This tale focuses on identity, loyalty, and social justice and will tug on the heartstrings of any reader who has ever questioned how much of themselves to share with those they love. The Victorian-esque setting is purely magical. Reading Behind the Crimson Curtain feels as if you're wrapped in a wool shawl, gazing out at a setting sun over a dusty industrial skyline as Bregan and Firin dance along the rooftops of Luisonn, weaving in and out of a fragile revolution rebuilding society and a precarious underground theater group, set on making art even in the most trying of times. E.B. Golden's storytelling reminds of Erin Morgenstern and V.E. Schwab with beautiful, sweeping narration, emotionally charged dialogue, and breathtaking reveals throughout the dual timeline and dual POV novel. I have fallen in love with Firin's passion and Bregan's devotion and I look forward to following their stories on even greater adventures.\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nThis book is a stunning piece of art.\n\nI got so completely lost in this new world that E.B. Golden created and I want more! I will be picking up the second book as soon as humanly possible.\n\nYou need this on your shelf. You need Firin and Bregan in your hearts.\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nImaginative \"romantacy\" with an ending that leaves you wanting more...!\n\nAugust 2, 2024\n\nDisclaimer: I received an ARC of this book. All opinions are my own.\n\nThe dawn of a new world should be bright with promise. But what happens when a political revolution unearths devastating new truths about yourself and those you love?\n\nIf you like books that make your favorite characters suffer in the most heart-wrenching of ways, CRIMSON is ready to devastate you, lol. Set in a Victorian-inspired industrial era with face-changing magic, illegal theater, and violent political upheaval, this story certainly keeps you flying through the pages. But what really makes this book magical is the way it wrestles with deeply moving questions of love, identity, and belonging. Do we create ourselves, or are we born to our destinies? Is the potential to be wholly loved worth the risk of truly being known?\n\nFirin and Bregan’s romance is one for the ages, and I can’t wait to read its conclusion in book two.\n\nTL;DR: This book is a must-read for any Romantasy fan hungry for heart-wrenching romance set amidst a backdrop of gritty realism, with a healthy splash of crimson-curtained theater to boot.\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nDNF; what a wasted opportunity for a great book. The world is well crafted, the setting is vividly realized, the prose is good ( even though I vastly prefer the 3rd person POVs, the 1st person chapters have some lively turns of phrases).\n\nBut. Oh but.\n\nThe FMC is absolutely unlikeable, her choices, especially and mainly after meeting and getting to know the LI and the group she wants to belong to are horrid. I understand she is supposed to be selfish due to her past, but at what point does wilful pride and refusing to learn from mistakes and have character development at all does NOT a villain make??\n\nI threw this on the DNF shelf after it was clear the author gave up and turned FMC abd her LI into Katniss and Peeta clones, down to stealing the interview for propaganda scenes and instead of a nuanced view of a cross-class redemption arc they decided to make the aristocrat the villain after all. For the love of little fishes, this was such a cop out I literally yelled at the book. Did the author have no idea how to finish and just pulled scenes and ideas shamelessly from the Hunger Games? Gah. Such a waste.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nThis novel gave me the vibes of if Les Miserables (&/or Tale of Two Cities) was catapulted into a new High Fantasy world filled with spies and magic elements. It's like a layered cake, rich with so many intricate clues about who holds power behind the scenes in this society where working-class people have been pushed too far and now have fully embraced a bloody revolution.\n\nIn this tumultuous world, Firin has been forced into being the perfect con-artist & thief from childhood with her magical abilities to assume the face of anyone she studies. But then a boy named Bregan involved in the labor-class rebellion steals her heart and makes her wish she could be honest and have one identity instead of her multitude of faces. They fight to try and stay together despite multiple forces in the revolution trying to push them apart.\n\nThis book features:\n\n*A dual POV timeline showing a romance in the past vs. the present\n\n*Wild face-changing magic\n\n*Several societies of spies\n\n*Second-chance love\n\n*Complex tales within tales\n\n*Detailed high-fantasy world building\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nBehind the Crimson Curtain is so incredible! It's a compelling story, woven together by absolutely beautiful prose. Seriously, I could get lost in these descriptions and the way Golden brings forth such a visceral world.\n\nFirin and Bregan are star-crossed lovers thrust together and apart by political intrigue and difficult pasts. As an FMC, Firin is nuanced and complicated and flawed--yet we're totally locked in to her goals and her heartbreak. She's powerful and headstrong, which makes her a total breath of fresh air. As an MMC, Bregan is absolutely swoon-worthy and I love how much he loves Firin. The ending of this book has me feral for the next one. I can't wait to see more of Luisonn and of these characters! If you want to read a book that you'll think about for dayssssss, pick this book up immediately!\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nDNF 50% while there were intriguing elements such as the post-revolution context and the emphasis of the stage I found the main character's motives and relationship to be confusing as well as the unrealistic. If you had been imprisoned by an abusive father is that how you would act? As a revolution leader (choked with spies) why would Bergen ever confide in someone who has literally told her NOTHING about her life and explicitly lies constantly?. She also didn't focus on the most compelling elements of the story the MC's abilities, where did they come from? How does it work? What other magic is in this world? Tell me more about the political intruige? Elements were there but the execution wasn't.\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nE.B. Golden has created an instant classic in her debut novel _Behind the Crimson Curtain_ by conjuring a world rife with political drama and filling that world with characters who are continually challenged to choose between fighting for their freedom or following their hearts. This spectacular novel showcases the author's impeccable writing style and ability to put the reader in the hearts and minds of her characters and hold their attention from the moment the book begins until they regretfully reach the words \"The End.\" Classifying this book as simply fantasy or romance does a disservice to the work, as it is so well written and beautifully constructed that readers across genres will all find something to love among its pages. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves to read!\n\nAugust 14, 2024\n\n3.75 ⭐️\n\nThe magic system was interesting, and the post-revolution atmosphere gave shadow & bone/six of Crow vibes, which I loved. As a reader, I was confused at some parts. The characters kept confusing me. I felt lost sometimes with where the characters and story were going. Idk if it's intentional or not. The chaos of post revolution is realistic, but the relationships between the characters didn't seem so in some places. It's an odd combination but also refreshingly different? It's hard to describe honestly. I loved the twists and turns in this though.\n\nI'll definitely be continuing the series because I really need to know what happens next!\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nVery well written and a fascinating universe, but the characters felt very wishy washy to me. Their motivations kept changing and they ended up as a crossover between a conflicted mix of intention and warped attempts at redemption. I am curious to continue the series and see where the characters end, and would love more insight on the whole magical shape shifting bit of it. Overall, a decent read!\n\nAugust 19, 2024\n\nBehind the Crimson Curtain by E.B. Golden is a fantasy novel that artfully blends unique magic, rebellion, and second-chance romance. Set against the oppressive backdrop of a regime, Firin and Bregan confront the struggles of revolution and oppression, while their love is tested by old secrets and shifting loyalties. A must-read for lovers of immersive world-building, heartfelt romance, and beautiful storytelling layered with meaning!\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nIt’s not a bad book! I just didn’t connect with either Firin or Bregan; the writing was young, their relationship felt shallow, and by the time they had their first kiss, I was kind of like, already? It’s told from split POV and dual timelines, which isn’t my favorite. Mix that with my meh feelings on reformist plots, and I decided to DNF.\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nThis book had me mad, excited, and intrigued. I can’t say I love Firin/Vota but I see why she hid the was she did. Still not my favorite, I couldn’t get past the lies and illusions and the end? How do we explain it?\n\nMaybe I am judging too harsh. It’s a good read but I did struggle to remain focused a couple of times\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\nFantasy thriller\n\nFirin is the name her father calls her but she is kept locked up, trained to use illusion to become someone else. She finds a friend and desires a different life in the theatre. Everything conspires against her as her world is mirred in lies and politics and everyone she knows uses her.\n\nAugust 17, 2024\n\nCon Artist and the actor...\n\nThe con artist and the actor in their own way were looking for truth and freedom but ended up finding love. The problem with finding love during revolution and while the world is on the verge of changing is it is so easy to have it slip through your fingers leaving you only pain and memories. What is more important freedom or love?\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\n3.5 stars -- The plot was a bit tangled and not always easy to follow, and I found myself not liking Firin AT ALL at several places in the narrative. However, it sets up what might be a very satisfying follow-up novel. I'll likely pick it up when the time comes.\n\nI got this one for free with Amazon First Reads this month, so that was a nice bonus.\n\nAugust 10, 2024\n\nI enjoyed the way this book bounces between the past and current time. The story and the background get revealed in snippets that add to the drama and tension in the telling. Unique idea for the story line told from both main characters views.\n\nUnfinished business ending so now I'm waiting for Book 2 in summer 2025.\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nWell written and some lovely descriptions, but I couldn't engage with the characters, particularly Firin, and found the political situation and plot hard to follow. An interesting world which wasn't fully explored. Won't be getting the sequel.\n\nAugust 14, 2024\n\nFantastical romance\n\nI loved the fantasy of being able to create a compelling illusion. I felt the tension between the truth and the lies all through the story. I wanted a happy ending."
