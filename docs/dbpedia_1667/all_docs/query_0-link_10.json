        "text": "The Detroit Pistons wanted a sweep. The Chicago Bulls refused to let them get it. Luol Deng scored 25 points, Kirk Hinrich and Ben Gordon added 19 apiece, and the Bulls hung on to beat the Pistons, 102-87, in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Sunday afternoon. Unlike Game 3, when the Bulls saw a 19-point lead dissolve into a seven-point loss, Chicago withstood a late push by Detroit. The Bulls outscored the Pistons 27-13 in the third quarter to turn a seven-point halftime lead into a 77-56 advantage going into the fourth.\n\nThey didn't flinch when Chauncey Billups hit two free throws with 3:55 left to cut it to 87-80, or when he answered Gordon's 3-pointer with one of his own. That made it 90-83 with 2:46 remaining, but the Bulls hung on against a Pistons team that had won 12 of 13 closeout games.\n\nThe Bulls still have a long way to go to join the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders and 2004 Boston Red Sox as the only major pro teams to win a best-of-seven series after falling behind 3-0. The Pistons will try to wrap up this one Tuesday at The Palace of Auburn Hills, where they blew out Chicago in Games 1 and 2 after sweeping Orlando in the first round.\n\nDeng was 10-of-15 after shooting 38 percent in the first three games and grabbed 13 rebounds. Hinrich added 10 assists, although he committed five turnovers. Ben Wallace delivered a vintage performance against his former team, grabbing 17 rebounds, and the Bulls held a 51-33 edge on the glass.\n\nDETROIT (87) - Prince 8-16 0-2 18, R.Wallace 4-16 4-4 14, Webber 0-3 0-0 0, Billups 5-14 11-14 23, Hamilton 4-12 3-5 11, Murray 5-11 0-1 10, McDyess 2-6 1-1 5, Delfino 1-1 0-0 2, Maxiell 1-2 0-0 2, Hunter 1-2 0-0 2.
