        "text": "â€” It was another playoff thriller between Chicago and Boston, and this one went to the Bulls.\n\nIf the Celtics want to advance, they're going to have to earn it.\n\nBen Gordon scored 22 points, hitting the tying three pointer in the first overtime, and the Bulls beat the defending champions 121-118 in double overtime Sunday to tie their first-round series at two games apiece.\n\nThe teams split two tight games in Boston, before the Celtics blew out the Bulls in Game 3. This time, they stretched the drama into a second overtime.\n\n\"Everybody I'm talking to is saying this is the most exciting series that they're watching right now,\" Gordon said.\n\nIt's tough to argue.\n\nDerrick Rose added 23 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists. John Salmons scored 20 points after a slow start, hitting four free throws in the final 26 seconds of the game and blocking Paul Pierce's tying three-pointer.\n\nBoston's Ray Allen made a three-pointer with 9.8 seconds left in regulation to tie it at 96 before Rose missed a potential winning fadeaway in the closing seconds. Gordon came through with 4.5 seconds left in the first overtime, hitting a three-pointer over Pierce to tie it at 110, and the Bulls never trailed in the second overtime.\n\nSalmons hit two free throws with 26 seconds left and, after a three-pointer by Pierce, he hit two more at the line. After a timeout, Pierce got the ball on the left side but couldn't shake Salmons, who deflected his three-pointer.\n\nIt was a dramatic end to another dramatic game. The series goes back to Boston, where the Bulls took Game 1 in overtime and the Celtics won Game 2 by three, on Tuesday.\n\nPierce led Boston with 29 points, although he was just 9 for 24. Allen added 28, and Rajon Rondo again hounded the Bulls, finishing with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nBOSTON (118) Pierce 9-24 8-9 29, Davis 4-16 2-2 10, Perkins 6-10 3-3 15, Rondo 9-18 7-9 25, R.Allen 8-17 7-8 28, Marbury 1-3 0-0 2, House 2-5 1-1 6, Moore 0-0 0-0 0, Scalabrine 1-2 0-0 3, T.Allen 0-0 0-0 0.

He helped put the Pistons away for good with a 16-6 run midway through the third quarter.\n\nMo Williams scored a career playoff-high 24 for the Cavs.\n\nDetroit's Antonio McDyess had 26 points, tying a career playoff high.\n\nCLEVELAND (99) James 10-24 16-17 36, Varejao 3-5 0-0 6, Ilgauskas 4-8 0-0 8, M.Williams 9-14 2-2 24, West 5-10 1-1 12, Smith 2-6 2-2 6, Gibson 0-1 0-0 0, Szczerbiak 1-2 2-2 4, B.Wallace 0-1 0-0 0, Pavlovic 1-1 0-0 3, Jackson 0-1 0-0 0, Kinsey 0-1 0-0 0.
