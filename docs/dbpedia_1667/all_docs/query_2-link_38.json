        "text": "Article Length: about 1,400 words or about 8-10 minutes of reading\n\nDuring the 2002-03 season, a 32-year-old Doug Christie averaged 9.4 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game for the 59-win Sacramento Kings. Counting stats alone might have a fan think of him as the 4th or 5th best player on that team; however, he scored very high on a variety of advanced statistics. He was 10th in the entire league in PIPM and 15th in VORP (just ahead of Gary Payton and Allen Iverson) both of which were higher than any of his teammates.\n\nSo, what’s going on? He shot efficiently, but not that efficiently. He was fourth in the league in total steals (behind Kobe, Marion, and Iverson), but nothing else jumps off the page. His overall defense, however, was revered. He was 1st team All-Defense that year, 5th in DPoY voting (behind Ben Wallace, Metta World Peace, Garnett, and Duncan), and was listed in Bleacher Report’s top 60 defensive players of all time (coming in at #10 for shooting guards).\n\nInterestingly enough, when I went back to the film, I was pretty underwhelmed by Christie’s presence especially on defense. In just a couple of games, I found multiple mistakes in the form of being blown by, gambling on passes, and ball-watching. In the most egregious example, he simply lets Sprewell torch him in the open court (who ultimately…chokes…at the rim).\n\nLater, he bites on a pass 30 feet from the rim, and instead of sprinting back to recover, he jogs back with his hand up. He’s lucky that neither of these mistakes led to a basket.\n\nThe aforementioned are the two most egregious examples that I found, but they’re both pretty bad. Whenever Harden pulls the lazy fake-swipe-at-the-ball-while-being-burned, he’s endlessly mocked on Twitter, and he should be, but sometimes we let those moments blind us to the whole body of work (which, in Harden’s case, still isn’t that great). These next couple of examples are up for interpretation. Obviously Garnett with an open lane is terrifying, but someone has to try, and I’m not sure if it’s Divac’s fault for focusing on the boxout or Christie who sorta just watches the whole thing unfold on the pick-and-roll.\n\nThe next one is extremely tricky because it looks like Christie’s blunder is actually the Kings’ defensive scheme. While Sprewell gets the ball above the break, Christie leaves Cassell who runs to the other side of the court. Sprewell easily beats Stojakovic off the dribble (no surprise there) and finds Cassell for the spot up jumper. Christie makes a nice recovery, but it’s just a little too late.\n\nThat play may speak to Christie’s ability to hold the Kings’ defense together. Stojakovic is an infamous statue on the perimeter, and maybe they simply bank on Christie’s ability to recover more than Stojakovic’s ability to stay in a defensive stance.\n\nFinally, before we get into his clear strengths on defense, here’s another 50/50 play. Webber is weirdly screened by Van Exel which Christie reads immediately, so he switches onto Nowitzki to prevent the spot-up three. Then, Bibby loses Nash on a straightforward cut. Mavericks score an easy two.\n\nChristie could have easily helped and shut down that cut by Nash, but he didn’t, and ultimately, this was where my disappointment arises in such a highly touted defensive player. Guys like Giannis, LeBron, and Garnett can sniff out and completely blow up an offense, and while you’ll see evidence of Christie being disruptive, I saw no sign of superhuman recovery.\n\nWhat I saw signs of was peskiness. Christie could be like a gnat (a lanky gnat) that could switch 1-4 (sometimes 4), jump passing lanes, and dodge screens. Here he is hounding Cassell from halfcourt. He avoids a Garnett screen, pokes the ball away, gets caught on a second Garnett screen, recovers, and causes a turnover.\n\nStanding at 6’6″ and having such a long reach made him perfect for making life difficult for players creating in the halfcourt. When Van Exel tries to take him off the dribble, Christie easily tips the shot.\n\nHis quick reflexes also allowed him to capitalize and bait offensive players into making mistakes. Garnett times Christie’s subtle shift backwards, but Christie lunges and tips the pass.\n\nThese next two plays showcase his ability to amplify offensive mistakes. In the first, Nowitzki stumbles and tries passing the ball, but Christie reads and reacts. In the second, he perfectly helps on a driving Nash to force the pass to Finley who bobbles the pass. Before Finley can recover, Christie causes the turnover.\n\nWhile most of these plays show up on the stat sheet, his intelligent use of angles to cut off passing lanes don’t appear on the ESPN ticker. Here, the Wolves look to leverage Garnett’s tremendous passing ability by having Cassell run through a quick down screen, but Christie face-guards him, and Garnett is forced into a tough jumper.\n\nThen, while Divac cleans up and grabs the rebound, Christie switches onto and bodies Nowitzki for a full possession keeping him from getting the ball and away from the rebound.\n\nHe clearly relished in his ability to chase smaller guards and body forwards, and like I said before, he often had to cover for some of his defensively deficient teammates. I would be interested to see him unleashed on a team with other defensive savants.\n\nOffensively, Christie is uninteresting. Most of the time, the Kings would run an action, and he would just stand above the break. He wouldn’t hesitate to shoot either a long two or a three, and while defenses didn’t shadow him, he was reliable enough with the jumper.\n\nI think Daryl Morey just vomited after that last one.\n\nWhen matched onto a smaller guard, he leveraged his strength and passing to create easy opportunities. The first video shows him bullying Van Exel in the paint. The second is more prolonged, but it ends with him grabbing an offensive board and drawing a foul.\n\nHe didn’t initiate much offense, but he showcased a solid passing ability. Ben Taylor’s Passer Rating scores him at a 7.6 (out of 10) for the season which would have been second on his team (behind Divac). This was boosted by his smart extra passes as opposed to creating easy opportunities for his teammates.\n\nEven though he spent a large percentage of possessions standing at the perimeter, he definitely knew how to move without the ball, and he even flashed some proto-Steph Curry movement like in this possession. He doesn’t get the shot (Stojakovic missed a wide-open pass to him), but the drive, pass, and re-position is beautiful.\n\nLike many role players, he would sometimes get a little too confident about his own abilities and toss up a contested midrange jumper, drive a little out of control, or throw an errant pass, but he mostly stayed within his abilities.\n\nAll things considered, I don’t see Christie as being a player that can shift a game on either side of the court. On offense, he stays within his role while providing good passing and passable shooting. On defense, he can stick to quicker ball-handlers, body up bigger players, and play a sort of free safety position.\n\nGoing back to my first question about the advanced metrics, Christie scores so well because everything he is good at is portable: they can be included on high-achieving teams without encroaching on his teammates’ skills. He’s definitely great at defensive especially for a guard, and his shooting and passing make him a great role player.\n\nFinal Evaluation\n\nRole: Top 10, fourth or fifth best player on a team\n\nSkillset (compared to other players at his position):\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Portability 5 4 7 5 9\n\nI’m not so sure about where I ranked him on defense. I feel like that’s a little low, but it still scaled out as a lower level “elite” skill for him. He definitely is not a 6, and I could see the case for it being an 8. His portability is so high because he could literally be placed on any team and make an impact. I didn’t give him a perfect 10 because his shooting leaves something to be desired.\n\nPerception in Current NBA: Many would view him in the same light as Avery Bradley which would actually help his image because most fans are enamored with 1-on-1 defense regardless of how valuable it actually is.\n\nReality: He’s bigger, stronger, more impactful, and simply better than Bradley in every conceivable way. The poster Winsome Gerble from RealGM compared him to an older Andre Iguodala which I definitely like though I think Iggy was better at defense and creating while significantly worse at shooting.\n\nArticle Length: ~4,000 words, so a lot of reading.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n+/- Stats\n\n+/- Per 100 Possessions\n\nOffensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and Net Rating\n\nOn/Off Per 100 Possessions\n\nRelative Offensive and Defensive Ratings\n\nCalculating Expected Wins and Net Rating\n\nIndividual Offensive, Defensive, and Net Ratings\n\nBeing a modern NBA fan is a daunting task. Not only are there multiple games to watch every single night but analysts also sling advanced metrics like multiplication facts. The latter is what I want to address today because as far as I’m concerned, fans don’t have an on-ramp for learning these metrics. A new fan, besides having to learn names, historical players, and an ever-changing playoff picture, must acclimate him or herself quickly or fall behind at the water cooler (or wherever new fans discuss the NBA. Reddit? Twitter?). Just look at this excerpt from Zach Lowe’s most recent column for ESPN:\n\nThey fall apart whenever [Vucevic] sits. Orlando has outscored opponents by 4.5 points per 100 possessions with Vucevic on the floor, but opponents have obliterated them by almost a dozen points per 100 possessions when he rests. The difference — plus-16.2 — is the 11th-fattest among all rotation players, per NBA.com.\n\nThis reminds me of the scene in “The Matrix” where Cypher is explaining to Neo that he “no longer even sees the code” while looking at the code for the matrix. To Cypher, it’s as simple as a first language, but to Neo, it’s an impervious wall of nonsense that offers no simple way to decipher it.\n\nZach Lowe’s multiple references to per 100 possessions stats and +/- jargon acts as the same way: most NBA analysts would breeze through that passage while newer or more casual fans would struggle with this second language.\n\nMy goal in this article is to start from scratch to clearly explain what these numbers mean, how they are contextualized, and how it can be applied to evaluating individual players. Hopefully, this can be a skeleton key for those wanting to wade further into the swamps of NBA analytics. Let’s begin at the beginning though, so feel free to jump down to later sections if you find any of the earlier information too simple.\n\n+/- Stats for Teams and Players\n\nThe simplest statistic that acts as the base for most NBA analytics is the basic +/- stat that can be applied to both teams and individual players. For teams, it shows by how many points a team wins or loses by while for players it shows by how many points his or her team outscored or was outscored by the other team. Let’s look at an example from yesterday’s Rockets vs. Trailblazers example.\n\nThe Rockets won 111-104 meaning that the Rockets’ +/- is +7 while the Trailblazers +/- is -7. After a period of multiple games, we can see start seeing trends about better teams having a higher +/- than worse teams, and it actually becomes a way to differentiate top teams. For instance, if two teams are both 10-2 after the first 12 games, it would be simple to point to them as being equals; however, if team A has an average +/- of +10 and team B has an average +/- of +3, we might draw some different conclusions about which team is actually better and which team has been the recipient of some luck (which we’ll discuss later).\n\n+/- becomes a bit messier when it comes to evaluating players though. What it shows is by how many points a team outscores its opponent while a player is on the floor or by how many points a player’s team is outscored while he or she is on the floor. For instance, take the Rockets’ basic box score from the aforementioned game:\n\nHouston Rockets +/- Eric Gordon -5 Chris Paul +8 James Harden -15 P.J. Tucker -17 Clint Capela -7 Gerald Green +18 Nene Hilario +14 Danuel House +24 James Ennis +15\n\nInstead of the boiled down +7 that the Rockets earned during the game, it shows how well the Rockets played when each player was on the court. When P.J. Tucker was in the game, the Trailblazers outscored the Rockets by 17, but when Danuel House was in the game, the Rockets outscored the Trailblazers by 24.\n\nThe NBA is all about evaluating sample sizes, and one game is certainly not enough to evaluate teams or players. Does this game mean that Danuel House is the Rockets’ best player and should usurp all of Harden’s minutes? No, but if he consistently scores a higher +/- then his teammates, then it might be time to evaluate what he’s doing on the court to drive this consistent success. This is the sort of evaluation that earned Shane Battier a fruitful career.\n\nThe issue with just using +/- is that it’s noisy and favors teams that play a faster pace. Currently, the Hawks lead the league with 105.5 possessions a game while the Grizzlies play at thumping 94.9 possessions a game. Over the course of an 82 game season, the Hawks would have 869 more possessions to rack up a + or -. This is where per 100 possessions comes in.\n\n+/- Per 100 Possessions\n\nOnce we have +/- data, we can start playing around with it to normalize it for the league. To evaluate a single game on a per 100 possessions basis, we must take each team’s score, divide it by the pace of the game, and multiply that number by 100. The equation is as follows:\n\nPoints Per 100 Possessions = (Team Score/Team Pace)*100\n\nSo, if a team scores 103 points at a pace of 100 possessions, its points per 100 possessions would be 103\n\nLet’s look again at the previous Rockets/Trailblazers game. The Rockets scored 111, and the Blazers scored 104. Both teams played at a pace of 91.8 possessions. This means that the Rockets scored 121 points per 100 possessions, and the Blazers scored 113.1 points per 100 possessions.\n\nRockets Points Per 100 Possessions = (111/91.8)*100\n\nBlazers Points Per 100 Possessions = (104/91.8)*100\n\nOnce we have these two new numbers, we can figure out by how many points per 100 possessions the Rockets won by which turns out to be approximately 8, and while this 8 seems too close to the original +7 that they actually won by, this point differential becomes more significant over a longer period of time.\n\nFurthermore, this helps to normalize the score to show that this was a more decisive victory than a much faster-paced game. Let’s pretend that the game was played at a pace of 110 possession. This would make the Rockets’ and Blazers respective points per 100 possessions 101 and 94.5 making this point differential per 100 possessions only 6.5 as opposed to 8. Now we’re beginning to see a difference.\n\nOnce again though, this game-by-game analysis provides little insight into a team’s ability. We need two more factors: 1) more data to provide a broader picture and 2) an explanation of how a team is performing on offense and defense. Offensive rating, defensive rating, and net rating provide a better insight.\n\nOffensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and Net Rating\n\nI argue that this is the stage that all NBA fans should aspire towards understanding.\n\nSimply put, here are definitions for each of these terms\n\nOffensive Rating – how many points per 100 possessions a team scores\n\nDefensive Rating – how many points per 100 possessions a team allows\n\nNet Rating – a team’s offensive rating minus its defensive rating (which shows by how many points per 100 possessions a team outscores its opponent or is outscored by its opponent).\n\nIn the previous section, we were looking at a team’s game-level offensive and net rating. The Rockets scored 121 points per 100 possessions, so its offensive rating was 121. Since the Blazers scored 113 points per 100 possessions against the Rockets, the Rockets’ defensive rating was 113. When you subtract those numbers, the Rockets’ net rating was 8.\n\nOnce again, this is just a single-game statistic, but it becomes immensely more valuable when calculated across many games. The following chart shows every NBA team’s offensive rating, defensive rating, and net rating as of 12/12 (sorted by net rating):\n\nRk Team ORtg DRtg NRtg 1 Milwaukee Bucks 114.6 105.1 +9.5 2 Toronto Raptors 114.8 106.7 +8.1 3 Boston Celtics 110.9 103.3 +7.6 4 Oklahoma City Thunder 109.2 102.5 +6.7 5 Denver Nuggets 112.4 106 +6.4 6 Golden State Warriors 115.9 110.1 +5.8 7 Indiana Pacers 108.4 103.6 +4.8 8 Charlotte Hornets 113.2 109.9 +3.3 9 Philadelphia 76ers 110.5 108.1 +2.4 10 Los Angeles Lakers 109.7 107.5 +2.2 11 Los Angeles Clippers 112.8 110.7 +2.1 12 Dallas Mavericks 110 107.9 +2.1 13 New Orleans Pelicans 114.1 112.3 +1.8 14 Portland Trail Blazers 112.3 110.7 +1.6 15 Memphis Grizzlies 107.1 106.6 +0.5 16 Minnesota Timberwolves 110.3 110.4 -0.1 17 Miami Heat 107.6 107.9 -0.3 18 Utah Jazz 107.9 108.5 -0.6 19 Sacramento Kings 110.1 110.8 -0.7 20 Detroit Pistons 107.4 108.6 -1.2 21 Houston Rockets 112.5 113.7 -1.2 22 Brooklyn Nets 109.5 111.4 -1.9 23 San Antonio Spurs 111.4 113.4 -2 24 Orlando Magic 106.5 110 -3.5 25 Washington Wizards 109.1 113.8 -4.7 26 New York Knicks 107.6 114.2 -6.6 27 Cleveland Cavaliers 107.4 116.1 -8.7 28 Atlanta Hawks 102.3 112.1 -9.8 29 Chicago Bulls 100.6 111.6 -11 30 Phoenix Suns 102.3 114.2 -11.9 League Average 109.6 109.6\n\nThese are some statistics that analysts should start to feel confident about using. They provide some interesting insights and raise even more interesting questions about luck and evaluating teams. For instance, the Raptors currently have the best record in the NBA at 22-7 (75.9% win rate), but the Bucks boast a higher net rating with a worse record (18-8 with a 69.2% win rate). So, which team is currently better? That’s a question that would need to be parsed out by even more specific numbers, but the per 100 statistics show that the Bucks clearly have an edge over the “best” team in the league.\n\nNow, before diving deeper into comparing teams, it’s necessary to take a step sideways to discuss how players can impact offensive/defensive/net ratings with On/Off numbers.\n\nOn/Off Per 100 Possessions and Basic Player Evaluation\n\nEarlier in this article, I discussed how players can leave an imprint on a game with his or her +/-. On/Off per 100 possessions takes the same basic principles as before and applies it to how teams perform while a player is on the court versus when a player is off the court. If you take a team’s net rating when a player is on the court and subtract it by the team’s net rating while that player is not on the court, then you have a player’s on/off per 100 possessions. The equation is as follows:\n\nOn/Off Per 100 Possessions = Team Net Rating With Player – Team Net Rating Without Player\n\nThis shows that, per 100 possessions, the team performs that many points better or worse. Let’s use LeBron James as an example.\n\nLeBron with the Lakers NRtg On the court 5.9 Off the court -0.9 On/Off Per 100 6.8\n\nThis means that the Lakers perform 6.8 points per 100 possessions better when LeBron James is on the court versus when he is not on the court. If we apply this to the team chart above, this difference would essentially transform the 76ers into the Bucks (just by comparing their net ratings). More specifically, we can see that the Lakers perform at the same level as the 4th best team in the league when LeBron is on the court (the Thunder at +6.7 per 100 possessions) as opposed to playing like the 19th best team (the Kings at -.9).\n\nJust like in the previous section though, this provides too broad of an analysis of what LeBron brings to the table, so we can begin parsing this into offense and defense. A player’s offensive on/off per 100 possessions is then how many more points per 100 possessions a team scores while a player is on the court versus when that player is sitting, and a player’s defensive on/off per 100 possessions is how many points per 100 possessions a team is scored on while a player is on the court versus when that player is off the court.\n\nA defensive on/off per 100 possessions is the first stat that we’ll look at that shows value when the number is negative meaning that a lower negative number means that a player contributes more on the defensive end. I will emphasize this throughout.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at LeBron’s On/Off per 100 possessions numbers to see where he’s adding value.\n\nORtg DRtg On 115.1 109.3 Off 111.3 112.2 On/Off Per 100 3.8 -2.9 (Remember, a negative number is a good thing for defensive on/off ratings!)\n\nAccording to this chart, the Lakers are about 3.8 points per 100 possessions better on offense when LeBron players and about 2.9 points per 100 possessions better on defense when he plays.\n\nIt is important to note that claiming that LeBron adds 3.8 points/100 on offense and 2.9 points/100 on defense would be mathematically dishonest. The fact is that LeBron is just one of five players on the court for his team and just one of ten players on the court at one time. Not only that but the only nine players do not remain consistent throughout, so it’s impossible to parse out exactly what LeBron is adding to the team; however, given enough data points which, in this case, means games in a season and number of seasons, we can start to draw conclusions about individual players if they consistently boast strong on/off numbers.\n\nOn/off metrics have a couple of other issues to consider. First, a player who starts will generally be playing with and against other starters most of the time, so they are playing with and against the best competition which is not taken into account by the final numbers. Second, we can only really use on/off per 100 possessions honestly with players who have played in the majority of his or her team’s games otherwise we would be considering games where the player simply doesn’t play in the “off” metrics.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s necessary to switch back over to team analysis before diving into another way to analyze player impact on a team. To see how much of an impact a player has on a team, we need to normalize team performance to show how teams can be compared across a single season and multiple seasons.\n\nRelative Offensive Rating and Relative Defensive Rating\n\nFrom year to year, average team performance has shifted on both offense and defense. Since the 2000-01 season, four of the five highest offensive ratings came from teams in 2016, 2017, or 2018, and the lowest (best) defensive ratings came from teams prior to the 2005 season. Does this mean that teams are better on offense and worse on defense now?\n\nWell, yes and no. Through various rule and stylistic changes, the NBA is the most efficient that it’s ever been, but it’s also the most difficult to defend. Because of this, the league average offensive rating and defensive rating has sky-rocketed in the last few years meaning that teams are scoring and allowing more points per game.\n\nSo, to more honestly evaluate team performance, it’s necessary to compare offensive and defensive ratings relative to the rest of the league. Equations for relative offensive and defensive ratings are as follows\n\nrelative offensive rating (rORtg) = team offensive rating – league average offensive rating\n\nrelative defensive rating (rDRtg) = team defensive rating – league average offensive rating (once again, negative numbers are better)\n\nAs an example, let’s use the team with the league-best net rating: the Milwaukee Bucks. Their Offensive Rating is 114.6, and their defensive rating is 105.1. The league average for both offensive rating and defensive rating is 109.6, so we just need to subtract that from the Bucks’ numbers.\n\nrORtg = 114.6 – 109.6 = 5\n\nrDRtg = 105.1 – 109.6 = -4.5 (remember, smaller and more negative is good)\n\nAccording to this, the Bucks’ relative offensive rating is 5 which means that their offense produces five more points per 100 possessions than league average, and their relative defensive rating is -4.5 which means that their defense prevents 4.5 more points per 100 possessions than league average. All together this adds up to their 9.5 net rating (another equation for net rating is as following: NRtg = ORtg – DRtg. This allows for negative relative defensive ratings to have a positive impact).\n\nHow do these numbers compare to the league? Let’s update the previously posted table with the league’s current team ratings by replacing its information with relative offensive and defensive ratings sorted again by net rating:\n\nRk Team rORtg rDRtg NRtg 1 Milwaukee Bucks 5 -4.5 +9.5 2 Toronto Raptors 5.2 -2.9 +8.1 3 Boston Celtics 1.3 -6.3 +7.6 4 Oklahoma City Thunder -0.4 -7.1 +6.7 5 Denver Nuggets 2.8 -3.6 +6.4 6 Golden State Warriors 6.3 0.5 +5.8 7 Indiana Pacers -1.2 -6 +4.8 8 Charlotte Hornets 3.6 0.3 +3.3 9 Philadelphia 76ers 0.9 -1.5 +2.4 10 Los Angeles Lakers 0.1 -2.1 +2.2 11 Los Angeles Clippers 3.2 1.1 +2.1 12 Dallas Mavericks 0.4 -1.7 +2.1 13 New Orleans Pelicans 4.5 2.7 +1.8 14 Portland Trail Blazers 2.7 1.1 +1.6 15 Memphis Grizzlies -2.5 -3 +0.5 16 Minnesota Timberwolves 0.7 0.8 -0.1 17 Miami Heat -2 -1.7 -0.3 18 Utah Jazz -1.7 -1.1 -0.6 19 Sacramento Kings 0.5 1.2 -0.7 20 Detroit Pistons -2.2 -1 -1.2 21 Houston Rockets 2.9 4.1 -1.2 22 Brooklyn Nets -0.1 1.8 -1.9 23 San Antonio Spurs 1.8 3.8 -2 24 Orlando Magic -3.1 0.4 -3.5 25 Washington Wizards -0.5 4.2 -4.7 26 New York Knicks -2 4.6 -6.6 27 Cleveland Cavaliers -2.2 6.5 -8.7 28 Atlanta Hawks -7.3 2.5 -9.8 29 Chicago Bulls -9 2 -11 30 Phoenix Suns -7.3 4.6 -11.9\n\nAt this point, this table doesn’t tell us anything new. The Warriors boast the best rORtg and the Thunder boast the best rDRtg, but we knew this information from seeing that the Warriors had the best offensive rating and the Thunder had the best defensive rating. The true value of relative ratings lies in two places: 1) comparing teams from different seasons and 2) comparing player impact on teams (which I’ll discuss in an upcoming section).\n\nThe following chart compares the top ten offensive ratings since the 2000-01 season and the top ten relative offensive ratings from the same seasons:\n\nRank Team▲ ORtg Year Rank Team▲ rORtg Year 1 Golden State Warriors* 115.6 2017 1 Dallas Mavericks* 9.2 2004 2 Phoenix Suns* 115.3 2010 2 Phoenix Suns* 8.4 2005 3 Houston Rockets* 114.7 2018 3 Golden State Warriors* 8.1 2016 4 Houston Rockets* 114.7 2017 4 Phoenix Suns* 7.7 2010 5 Golden State Warriors* 114.5 2016 5 Dallas Mavericks* 7.7 2002 6 Phoenix Suns* 114.5 2005 6 Phoenix Suns* 7.4 2007 7 Phoenix Suns* 113.9 2007 7 Sacramento Kings* 7.4 2004 8 Portland Trail Blazers* 113.9 2009 8 Dallas Mavericks* 7.1 2003 9 Toronto Raptors* 113.8 2018 9 Los Angeles Clippers* 6.8 2015 10 Utah Jazz* 113.8 2008 10 Golden State Warriors* 6.8 2017\n\nWhile this chart shows an overlap between among five teams (2016 and 2017 Warriors and the 2005, 2007, and 2010 Suns), five new teams arise from comparing the relative offensive ratings. In fact, the 2004 Mavericks rank as having the 31st highest offensive rating while holding the highest relative offensive rating showing that even though they were playing in a year with a low average offensive rating, their offense, while not absolutely better than other offenses this century, was the best offense relative to their season.\n\n(As a quick aside, looking at the top ten relative offensive ratings this century shows an incredible three year run by the Mavericks [2002-04]. It also shows that six of these ten teams were run by Steve Nash).\n\nAt the end of the day, we can never truly compare teams or players from different generations (much less years) because of a variety of factors. We can only compare them to their contemporaries, and relative offensive and defensive ratings allow for these comparisons.\n\nNow, from this century’s data on team performances, it’s possible to calculate expected win percentage and net rating, so I’ll do that before explaining individual relative offense and defensive rating to allow for an actual conclusion to this article.\n\nCalculating Expected Wins and Net Rating\n\nEarlier in this article, I referenced luck in terms of teams having a certain amount of wins. With respect to the 2018 Bucks and Raptors, the Bucks should have a better record because their net rating is currently better.\n\nTo figure out exactly how many wins equals what net rating and vice versa, it’s necessary to plot every teams’ performance this century. The following scatter plot shows all 536 teams’ wins with their respective net ratings:\n\nWins correlate well with net rating, but it’s not perfect.\n\nBefore calculating it though, let’s do a quick mathematical thought experiment. If a team has a net rating of 0, that means, on average, the team scores the same amount of points per 100 possessions as they allow; however, if this were to hold consistent from game to game, that means the team should end every game with a tie. We know this is impossible, so the most logical alternative is that the team is outscored half its games and outscores its opponent in half its games meaning that they would have a record of 42-42.\n\nLet’s calculate how accurate this has been this century. To do this, we have to calculate the slope intercept of the above graph which means we have to see where the trendline crosses the y-axis. This ends up being approximately 41 meaning that a net rating of 0 has, this century, an expected win outcome of 41 wins in a season. The slope of the line is approximately 2.5 meaning that each point in net rating (either positive or negative) is worth about 2.5 wins. Below is a win expectancy chart based on net rating by a factor of .5 (I have provided data to the theoretical limit of net rating based on possible wins):\n\nNet Rating Expected Wins 16 81.46 15.5 80.20 15 78.93 14.5 77.67 14 76.40 13.5 75.14 13 73.87 12.5 72.61 12 71.34 11.5 70.08 11 68.81 10.5 67.55 10 66.28 9.5 65.02 9 63.75 8.5 62.49 8 61.22 7.5 59.96 7 58.69 6.5 57.43 6 56.16 5.5 54.90 5 53.63 4.5 52.37 4 51.10 3.5 49.84 3 48.57 2.5 47.31 2 46.04 1.5 44.78 1 43.51 0.5 42.25 0 40.98 -0.5 39.72 -1 38.45 -1.5 37.19 -2 35.92 -2.5 34.66 -3 33.39 -3.5 32.13 -4 30.86 -4.5 29.60 -5 28.33 -5.5 27.07 -6 25.80 -6.5 24.54 -7 23.27 -7.5 22.01 -8 20.74 -8.5 19.48 -9 18.21 -9.5 16.95 -10 15.68 -10.5 14.42 -11 13.15 -11.5 11.89 -12 10.62 -12.5 9.36 -13 8.09 -13.5 6.83 -14 5.56 -14.5 4.30 -15 3.03 -15.5 1.77 -16 0.50\n\nWhen applying this information to the earlier chart listing team net ratings, we can see that the Bucks have an expected win outcome of about 65 wins while the Raptors have an expected win outcome of around 61 wins.\n\nA large number of factors play into this data not correlating perfectly with wins such as blowouts and poor clutch performances, but it might provide a better look at which teams are performing the best.\n\nFor instance, based on this information, it’s possible to conclude that 2016 Warriors (who went 73-9 on the season) were actually not the best team this century (or even in their same year). Their net rating ranks 4th, and their expected wins compared to the three other teams with a higher net rating are as follows:\n\nTeam▲ Year Wins Net Rating Expected Wins Wins Difference Golden State Warriors* 2017 67 11.6 70.3 -3.3 San Antonio Spurs* 2016 67 11.3 69.57 -2.57 Boston Celtics* 2008 66 11.3 69.57 -3.57 Golden State Warriors* 2016 73 10.7 68 5\n\nThis small bit of data reveals three interesting insights: 1) the 2016 Warriors outperformed their net rating; 2) the 2017 Warriors were actually better than the 2016 Warriors; 3) the three teams who have higher expected wins all underperformed their net rating.\n\nNow that we know how significant even one point for net rating is, we can apply relative offensive and defensive ratings to players to determine how much impact they have on a team.\n\nIndividual Offensive, Defensive, and Net Ratings\n\nThis is a statistic that I learned from reading Ben Taylor’s magnum opus, and I’m convinced that it’s a solid way to evaluate player impact without diving into the more complex statistics.\n\nIn a previous section, I discussed on/off metrics that showed how a team performed with and without a player, but I also addressed some of the drawbacks. This metric provides a different means of evaluating teams with and without players. This is fairly complex and requires multiple pieces of data while producing multiple statistics for individuals.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out a team’s relative offensive and defensive ratings in games when a specific player plays. For this, we want to use a player who plays significant minutes on a team to ensure he actually has an impact. To walk through calculating this, I’ll use Victor Oladipo since he has played in 17 of Indiana’s 28 games this year. The following chart shows the Pacer’s rORtg, rDRtg, and net rating in games where Oladipo plays versus when he sits, and the second chart shows a new statistic that I’m coining individual relative offensive (iaORtg) and defensive rating (iaDRtg):\n\nrORtg (positive is good) rDRtg (negative is good) NRtg With Oladipo -2.02 -6.26 4.24 Without Oladipo -0.1 -6.8 6.7\n\nirORtg (positive is good) irDRtg (negative is good) irNRtg -1.92 0.53 -2.45\n\nLet’s unpack this.\n\nThe first chart shows that when Oladipo has played this year, the Pacers’ offense has performed about 2 points per 100 possessions worse than league average, and their defense has been better than 6 points per 100 possessions than league average. However, when Oladipo does not play, their offense is just .1 points worse, and their defense is 6.8 points better than league average. So, individual offensive and defensive ratings show the net effect a player has on a team.\n\nirORtg = team rORtg with player x in the lineup – team rORtg without player x in the lineup\n\nirDRtg = team rDRtg with player x in the lineup – team rDRtg with player x in the lineup\n\nirNRtg = irORtg – irDRtg\n\nNumbers are a fickle tool, so I am not stating that Oladipo is a bad player, but objectively, the stats show that he has had a negative impact on the Pacers this year. How much of an impact? What do these numbers mean?\n\nRemember from above that each point in net rating equals about 2.53 wins. If you multiply a player’s irNRtg by 2.53, then we’ll get how many wins that player contributes using the net rating model meaning that the Pacers are on track to lose approximately 6 more games this season when Oladipo plays. We can show this through using the expected win model from above:\n\nNet Rating Expected Wins With Oladipo 4.24 51.7272 Without Oladipo 6.7 57.951\n\nAnd we can break this down even more by a player’s offense and defense by applying this same equation to a player’s irORtg and irDRtg:\n\nirORtg Expected Offensive Wins Added irDRtg\n\nExpected Defensive Wins Added\n\nOladipo -1.92 -4.8576 0.53 -1.3409\n\nThe issue with using an impact metric like this is that you need to have a player who missed substantial time without other significant players also being out. For example, we can’t evaluate LeBron over the past two seasons because he hasn’t missed any time, and we can’t evaluate Curry from this season because his absences mostly coincided with Draymond’s missed games.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis has been a lengthy and thorough walkthrough of some simple and complex impact metrics. I have covered the following impact metrics:\n\n+/- Stats\n\n+/- Per 100 Possessions\n\nOffensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and Net Rating\n\nOn/Off Per 100 Possessions\n\nRelative Offensive and Defensive Ratings\n\nCalculating Expected Wins and Net Rating\n\nIndividual Relative Offensive, Defensive, and Net Ratings\n\nVarious other impact metrics exist such as Ben Taylor’s CORP, ESPN’s RPM, and Jacob Goldstein’s PIPM, but those dive even deeper into the weeds of player performance.\n\nFor now, if you use this article as a guide moving forward while evaluating players, I promise that you’ll have a better grasp of advanced analytics in the NBA.\n\nArticle Length: ~2,300 words or about 12-16 minutes of reading.\n\nBack on April 18th of this year, esteemed sports analyst Bill Simmons had Kevin Durant on his podcast titled “The Bill Simmons Podcast.” You can find a link to excerpts from the interview and the actual podcast here.\n\nNow, for a bit of a backstory. Kevin Durant has now been on Bill’s podcast a total of five times which is more than any other player on that podcast. Durant’s demeanor on most of these podcasts can be described as cold, salty, and sensitive as discussed in this Reddit thread.\n\nUltimately, this is okay. Not everyone needs to be Mr. Sunshine during an interview, but the way that Simmons doesn’t push back against many of Durant’s points is what takes many NBA folks by surprise (disclaimer: it’s weirdly difficult to find actual articles about this, so if you want to dive deeper into this conversation, I would suggest searching it out on Twitter or the NBA Subreddit). Simmons is a bright and creative dude who does his best work when he’s free-wheeling about NBA conspiracies, historical rankings, player values, etc. which makes his performances on these podcasts all the more jarring.\n\nIt might seem random that I’m dedicating an entire post to criticizing this one podcast when I could be focusing on other, louder folks in the industry who spout vitriol such as Colin Cowherd and Skip Bayless; however, I’m a big Bill Simmons fan, and I generally love listening to his NBA takes.\n\nNow, during this April 18th podcast, Durant unleashed a fairly passionate rant regarding this generation of NBA fans who uses “analytics” to analyze the game. Now here’s how I’m going to do this: below is a lengthy excerpt from that interview. Within that excerpt, I have annotated my own thoughts in green to respond to some of the comments that I consider…well, for lack of better terms, utter bullshit. The comments are as follows:\n\nDurant: People don’t watch games ’cause they can look at analytics on Twitter. … The eye test, man, you gotta watch games if you really want to know what the game is about, you know what I’m saying? But if, you know, guys not trying to get embarrassed because they don’t want to be on the latest meme — come on, man. What are we doing? Basketball is about getting embarrassed.\n\nSimmons: We swung too far with the advanced metrics this season. People started doing the five-man lineups like 10 games into the year.\n\nThis is as classic of a straw man argument as one can find. Bill is referring to the NBA Stats where you can filter through every 5-man lineup who has stepped out on the court and analyze them to see which 5-man lineups played the most, scored the most, produced the worst +/-, etc. In the scope of statistics, this is a flawed stat if you’re looking for any concrete evidence about a player because it looks at the interaction between five players. Basketball is a game of looking to draw meaningful conclusions from small sample sizes, but most NBA analytics folk aren’t using a 10-game sample size to explain anything groundbreaking. It’s a way to look at possible trends going in to the future. For instance, the 5-man lineup with the highest +/- in October was Washington’s Bradley Beal, Marcin Gortat, Kelly Oubre, John Wall, and Otto Porter. That didn’t pan out during the rest of the year, but at that time, that lineup was as good as any in the league, so why not roll with it?\n\nRich Kleiman: But you’re a little bit to blame for that [Simmons].\n\nDurant: You’re an analytics guy?\n\nSimmons: No, I’m not — I like it, but I don’t like the five-man lineup and the plus-minus.\n\nSo, Simmons is and is not a fan of analytics? Once again, he cites the 5-man lineup, but now he cites plus-minus as well. Basic plus-minus (which I assume Bill is referncing) essentially states how a team performs when a player is on the court versus when he is off. A +5 would mean that the team outscored the opposing team by 5 while the player was on the court. This is a deeply flawed statistics in that there are four other players on the court playing with you at all times, so it’s essentially fruitless to parce out anything meaninful about an individual player. What I just said is common knowledge among the NBA analytics community, and citing it as “analytics” is silly.\n\nUsing that stat as a primer, we have an abundance of actual statistics like BPM, PIPM, WOWY, Real Plus-Minus, and WOWYR. These are all useful iterations of a flawed stat that Bill parades out as the end-all-be-all of analytics.\n\nDurant: I don’t like analytics at all.\n\nSimmons: I think that stuff goes too far.\n\nDurant: I like field goal percentage defense, I like field goal percentage, I like …\n\nSimmons: Turnovers.\n\nDurant: Turnovers. I like rebounds, I like the real stats, but the “true shooting percentage” and “effective field goal percentage,” and all that stuff — c’mon, man. It’s flawed.\n\nSimmons: It’s funny, your coach [Steve Kerr] told me — what were the three stats that he said? Turnovers, opponent field goal percentage, and rebounds were the three things he looks at.\n\nDurant: Yeah, that’s all — when I look at a stat sheet, and [during] timeouts, I look at opponent’s field goal percentage, rebounds, and assists. That’s what I look at.\n\nKleiman: Not free throws?\n\nDurant: And free throws.\n\nThis is a confusing section whose confusion will become more clear in a second. Are they talking about individual stats or team stats? If individual stats, then Bballbreakdown lists opponent field goal percentage as a stat to “Absolutely, Never Ever Use” because of the replicability of defensive rotations and the way in which they assign certain defensive players to being a primary defender.\n\nRebounding is another stat that means two very different things. A team that outrebounds another team might say something general about their hustle; therefore, you want your big guys to grab a huge percentage of rebounds, right?\n\nNot necessarily. For instance, Robin Lopez often grabs a very small share of defensive rebounds while on the court; however, the Bulls themselves grab a much higher share of defensive rebounds while Lopez is on the court which, if you looked just at his paltry defensive rebounding numbers, you might assume he is not contributing to. After seeing these numbers though, we can go back into the game film to watch why Lopez is helping the Bulls grab more rebounds.\n\nSimmons: The funny thing is, the box score was great — the basketball box score is fantastic.\n\nTranslation: These arbitrary categories that somebody randomly invented in the past are so much better than numbers that we have developed after 80 years of the game’s existence.\n\nKleiman: It’s all you needed.\n\nSimmons: You can learn a whole shitload from it. You can tell. I was looking at free throw attempts … trying to figure out what was going on with Carmelo Anthony, whether he was just hitting a different phase of his career, and you go back to earlier seasons, when he’s getting to the rim — [he was averaging close to] nine, nine and a half free throw attempts a [game].\n\nDurant: He’s a stretch-4 now, so it’s like, he’s not getting the isos like he used to get.\n\nSimmons: But that’s something you could learn pretty easily — he’s just shooting jump shots.\n\nDurant: But you gotta watch the games and see that.\n\nThis is simply false. You can very easily track the players with the most isolations over the last three years to see how many possessions per game a player is isolating. Melo isolated 3.1 times a game last year as oppossed to 5.3 the year before. And I did all that without watching a single game in the last 30 seconds.\n\nAlso on the topic of Melo, a reason that he scored so badly isn’t just that he was taking so many jumpshots and not isolating. As we just saw, he only isolated 2.2 possessions/game less this last year. He simply shot poorly. He shot 37.3% on catch-and-shoot jumpers vs. 42.3% the year prior. Once again, I found this in 30 seconds of not watching a game.\n\nSimmons: And then I watch the game and it follows up, yeah. … But I’m saying I look up numbers to see if they back up what I’m watching.\n\nYES BILL!!! YOU’RE SO CLOSE! JUST SAY YOU CAN DO BOTH!\n\nDurant: Yeah, yeah, you can’t look at numbers first and then watch.\n\nSimmons: I think that’s where we get into trouble is people —\n\nDurant: ’Cause they’re lazy — they don’t want to watch games. It’s too long, it’s too hard to watch games.\n\nHere it is. Out of everything else that was said during this podcast, this one irked me the most. To me, this is an example of gatekeeping where Durant and Simmons are controlling what it means to be a fan. We’ve seen this sort of thing with video games (oh, you play “Angry Birds” and “Candy Crush”? Just because you play games doesn’t mean that you’re a gamer. To be a gamer, you need to play 40 hours/week of…), political opinions (oh, you’ve thoroughly researched this topic? Well you’re simply not old enough to understand what this actually means), and other areas of life.\n\nThis issue of gatekeeping boils down to one important question: at what point can a “fan” be allowed to have an opinion? Do they need to intently watch a team (and a particular player) once? Twice? Ten Times? Regardless, let’s figure out how much time that means.\n\n(For the following math, let’s assume that the schedule works out perfectly in every situation) If you watch every single team once, then that’s a total of 15 games (you can watch two teams at a time, and cover 30 teams in 15 games). On national TV, 2.5 hours is set aside for an NBA game, so that’s roughly 37.5 hours which is roughly a week’s worth of a full-time job. If you watch each team twice, that’s 70 hours, and if you watch each team ten times, that’s 375 hours (150 games) which is 9.3 full work weeks.\n\nI think if you quit your job and watched NBA games instead for 9.3 weeks, nobody would doubt your fandom; however, you have only watched 150 games. In a season, there are a total of 1,230 games or about 3,075 hours (about 76 full work weeks).\n\nThis leads me to a couple of conclusions: watching each team 10 times is only about 12 percent of the season, and, if you quit your full-time job and watched NBA instead during that time, you would need an extra 24 weeks in the year to accomplish that. Do you feel comfortable with analyzing basketball through only “the eye test” when you’ve watched 12% of the season? Do you have Hermione’s Time Turner? I assume that the answer to both of those questions is no.\n\nBut I’m not finished because I was extremely aggravated during this podcast. Let’s pretend that I want to have an informed opinion on Atlanta Hawks 2017-18 rookie John Collins. If I watched every single NBA game that was nationally televised on a basic cable network, here’s how many times I would’ve seen Collins: 0\n\nThe Hawks were never on ESPN, ABC, or TNT. They were on NBATV twice. So to watch and have an opinion on John Collins, I would’ve needed to expand my TV package to include NBATV or purchased a subscription to NBA League Pass.\n\nSo, before I start going out of my way to tune into Hawks games to evaluate John Collins, you better believe that I’m going to use some analytics first to determine what I’m looking for. In education, we call these learning targets: it’s not a conspiracy to undermine the amount of people watching the NBA.\n\nSimmons: Or they’re watching games, but half the time when they’re watching they’re looking at the internet versus actually watching.\n\nDurant: Yeah, it’s a bunch of culture vultures in the game right now, it’s a bad place. Can I make a PSA real quick?\n\nSimmons: Please, do it.\n\nDurant: Aight, so all you blog boys, and you fanboys that’s gonna use everything I say and create an article, watch a basketball game … I just wanted to say that.\n\nSimmons: [Laughs]\n\nDurant: All these guys are gonna write articles about, and get real mad about, what I say tonight.\n\nYou’re right.\n\nSimmons: Yeah, probably. … They like this stuff, though.\n\nDurant: They like it, but they gonna put their emotions into it — it’s not about you. Watch a basketball game, enjoy the game, stop worrying about me so much. I just wanted to say that. … So, yeah, I just wanted to tell the blog boys out there who in their feelings about everything I say —\n\nKleiman: “Blog boys.”\n\nDurant: Blog boys, is what I call ’em\n\nIn a future post, I’ll discuss more explicitly why we need to marry “watching games” with “analytics.” I tried searching some articles out, but it seems that I’m so embedded in my niche NBA Twitter community that I forget what isn’t known to less plugged in NBA fan.\n\nFor now, I just wanted to highlight why the whole “Blog Boy” phenomenon is more dangerous and infuriating than it seems on the surface. If you’d like to see what other twists this conversation took, I invite you to go back to the podcast and give it a listen. If you think I’m being unfair in my criticism, or you think that I should include something else, please hit me up on Twitter (where I’m most active), Facebook, or leave a comment at the bottom of this article!\n\nArticle length: about 3,000 words (the second longest post behind this one)\n\nThis is it! The final section of a seven part series! Don’t quit on me now. Dig deep and find that dark place that helps you push to a new height. Do it! Go back and read part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, part 5, and part 6. It’s a lot of reading, I know, but you’ll hopefully find some mild entertainment.\n\nJust to make things easier, here’s the complete roster along with each player’s skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Mike Conley 8 7 7 4 Deron Williams 9 6 4 4 Ray Allen 6 7 5 5 Klay Thompson 4 8 7 4 Manu Ginobili 7 7 7 5 Paul George 5 6 8 6 Peja Stojakovic 6 8 4 6 Shawn Marion 3 6 9 8 Draymond Green 8 4 10 6 Ben Wallace 2 1 10 9 Yao Ming 4 7 8 8 Giannis Antetokounmpo 7 7 8 7\n\nSince this piece has three parts, I’m going to split it into two sections by combining the coach selection and team strategy because I believe that they go hand-in-hand. Then, once the strategy is spelled out, I’ll explain why certain players didn’t make the team in the context of the strategy.\n\nReady? Ready.\n\nCoach/Strategy\n\nSince I have to choose a coach that has not won Coach of the Year, my pool of extremely talented coaches is limited. I narrowed it down to two, and those two do NOT include the legendary Jerry Sloan (who definitely deserved CotY at one point or another) because of his curmudgeonly demeanor, his “my way or the highway” attitude, his old-school play style, and his war with Deron Williams. Look, Sloan was an incredible coach, and I wish him all the best with his current health, but I need someone who is going to manage personalities better, promote a more free-flowing offense, and have players shoot more threes. Personally, I think Sloan’s style stymied the likes of canonball players like Kirilenko, but that’s another conversation for another day.\n\nMy two coaches come down to Brad Stevens and Rick Adelman, and ultimately, I’m going with Stevens. Adelman coached two Portland teams to the NBA Finals (1990, 1992) and Portland and Sacremento to two Conference Finals (1991, 2002 respectively), and was described as a real player’s coach. So why not go with Adelman? Simple: I’m biased.\n\nUSA Today\n\nI’m biased towards more recent coaches because the last six or so NBA seasons has created a (semi) position-less and three-point revolution. Stevens has embraced this new NBA, and beyond that, the Celtics have embraced him as their leader. Just look at how Jae Crowder and Isaiah Thomas revitalized their careers in Boston. That’s not a coincidence; that’s a buy in. Part of that has to do with his players loving to play with him, and part of it is his focus on fundamentals, team-oriented basketball, and defense. Perfect. Sign the man up.\n\nSo let’s talk strategy.\n\nSince we’re dealing with an 82-game season, I want to establish some consistency so that there’s no guesswork game-to-game. We’ll definitely change up lineups once in a while, but in general, here’s who I imagine being in the starting lineup.\n\nStarters:\n\nMike Conley, Ray Allen, Paul George, Draymond Green, and Ben Wallace\n\nNBA.com\n\nDEFENSE!! This lineup is just stupid defensively. Ray Allen is by far the worst defender, and honestly, he’s not that bad. I fiddled around with Draymond and Ben starting together, but that defensive flexibility was too enticing for me to pass up. Both can switch out on a pick-and-roll (Draymond doing so on an elite level), and both can protect the rim better than most. Ben isn’t going to provide any offense (besides offensive boards), and Draymond won’t be that dangerous scoring-wise, but he is a tremendous facilitator, and can’t be left open from three.\n\nAll three of Mike Conley, Paul George, and Ray Allen can stretch the floor at an elite level. Paul George ranked in the 84th percentile in spot-up threes and Conley ranked in the 90th percentile. This shooting data doesn’t exist for 2001, but I’m sure Allen would be right around those numbers as well at an even higher volume. Ultimately, scoring for this unit will heavily come from these three.\n\nI don’t want to step on Stevens’ toes with setting up minutes, so I’ll just talk through my favorite lineup possibilities (this will seem very familiar if you’ve read Bill Simmons’ book).\n\nMost Unselfish Passing:\n\nMike Conley (maybe Deron), Manu Ginobili, Peja Stojakovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Draymond Green.\n\nInside Hoops\n\nThis is just brilliant. The only player who might hold the ball for too long is Giannis, but after a few reps, he’d assimilate perfectly with this group. Peja is the only middling defender, but he, Giannis, and Draymond could seamlessly switch.\n\nSpacing:\n\nDeron Williams (or Conley), Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, Peja Stojakovic, and Draymond Green.\n\nAre you seeing why I’m giddy about Draymond? Dude fits into pretty much any kind of lineup. This lineup definitely sacrifices defense with Deron, Ray, and Peja, but it’s offensive potency is off the chart. Just give the ball to Deron, have Ray, Peja, and Klay run through screen, and have Draymond set some picks. The other team is forced to defend the three-point line 1-5. Poor defenders would be exposed quickly.\n\nDefensive Nightmare (my favorite option):\n\nGiannis, George, Marion, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nI’m speechless. Here, we run point-Giannis with George helping out a bit, and the rest is just free-form. Would the offense be ugly? Definitely, but the defense would be stifling. 1-5 could legitimately switch better than any other lineup in history. Even the 2017 Warriors might struggle to score against them.\n\nAlso, since 2000, the 2012 Thunder have averaged the most blocks per game at 8.2. This single lineup averages 8.2 blocks per game…\n\nFast-break\n\nWilliams, Klay, Marion, Giannis, Draymond\n\nAny of the five can bring the ball up, Deron can facilitate, Giannis and Marion are relentless, and Klay can’t be left alone. Good luck keeping up with this.\n\nKeep a Lead With a Minute Left\n\nConley, Manu, Ray, Peja, and Yao.\n\nConley has the lowest free-throw percentage with 86%. Good luck (have I said this for every lineup so far? Weird).\n\nThese lineups are all fine and dandy, but if I’m preparing for anything, can I pull together a lineup that can stand against the best lineups in history? Let’s take a look.\n\n2017 Warriors (Curry, Klay, Iggy, Durant, and Draymond)\n\nI mean, why not start off with the best lineup ever?\n\nConley, Klay, Giannis, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nJesus, that Warriors lineup still might be better! The only reason I put in Wallace instead of Marion is I need to expose the Warriors’ only weakness: rebounding. Wallace would punish them on missed shots, and that might be the only way to expose them. All five of them can switch well enough with Conley’s size being the only issue.\n\n2001 Lakers (Fisher, Kobe, Fox, Horry, and Shaq)\n\nConley, Klay, George, Peja, and Wallace (or Yao)\n\nThe Hoop Doctors\n\nThis is a much easier lineup to handle because my main concerns are 1) make sure my guards can make Kobe’s life hell and 2) slow down Shaq as much as possible. Wallace is one of the only players to effectively guard him, and if that doesn’t work out, Yao is one of the other players to effectively guard him. The rest of the lineup’s offensive firepower would be too much, and Shaq can’t switch against four of the five players.\n\n2013 Heat (Chalmers, Wade, Battier, LeBron, and Bosh)\n\nConley, Ginobili, George, Marion, and Wallace\n\nonehotseason.com\n\nThe Heat were an excellent trapping defense, so it’s important to have multiple ball-handlers on the court. Both Marion and George have had mild success guarding LeBron, and since both Wade and LeBron thrive off scoring in the point, having Wallace as the last line of defense is essential. Plus, Marion and Wallace will absolutely punish the Heat on the boards.\n\n1986 Celtics (Johnson, Ainge, Bird, McHale, Parish)\n\nWilliams, Klay, George, Draymond, and Yao.\n\nPinterest\n\nThis is a really tough lineup to defend. They passed the ball effortlessly, destroyed teams in the paint, and were lead by apex Bird. I opted for Williams over Conley because Conley might just be too small to be that effective defensively. Williams wouldn’t be posted up that easily. Yao would thrive in this situation because neither McHale nor Parish could stretch out to shoot a three. All of Klay, George, and Draymond could switch onto Bird and bother him.\n\n1996 Bulls (Harper/Kerr, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, and Longley)\n\nDeron, Klay, George, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nneoGAF\n\nI really like my chances against the GOAT’s best team. Jackson’s Triangle Offense usually works best with big guards, like Jordan and Harper, so having Williams over Conley is important because Williams won’t get bullied around. George, Klay, and Draymond all can switch onto either Jordan and Pippen while making their lives a bit more difficult. Wallace is one of the best options for curbing Rodman’s otherworldly rebounding. Also, what are the odds of Draymond, Rodman, and Wallace starting Malice in the Palace part two?\n\n1987 Lakers (Magic, Scott, Green, Worthy, and Kareem)\n\nGinobili, George, Peja, Draymond, and Wallace\n\nRantSports\n\nThis Lakers lineup doesn’t resemble any modern lineup because 1) they made a total of 74 three-pointers in this year (Scott made 65 of those) and 2) they have a classic “dinosaur” center in Kareem who is way past his prime; however, their position-less flexibility between Green, Magic, and Worthy made them formidable on defense especially with Kareem lurking in the back.\n\nTo counter this, I opted with Manu for a bit more craftiness than Williams, and I picked Peja because he doesn’t have to worry about chasing too many guards on the perimeter. As documented in “Airplane,” Kareem didn’t work that hard on defense later in his career, and I think Kareem couldn’t contain Wallace on the boards while causing problems with their paint-heavy offense.\n\n1983 Sixers (Cheeks, Toney, Dr. J, Iavoroni, and Moses)\n\nWilliams, Allen, Giannis, Draymond, and Yao\n\nivanjordanproductions.weebly.com\n\nWhy not Wallace over Yao? Because I want to take advantage of any deficiencies that Moses has on defense. Yao will force him to work on the side of the ball that he struggles with the most: defense. Wallace would help mitigate his offensive rebounding numbers, but I think it’s more pertinent to have him deal with an offensive force in the post.\n\nAs for Dr. J, both Giannis and Draymond will match his length and strength. Both can dare the Doctor to shoot jumpshots while making any drives, his preferred method of scoring, strenuous.\n\nFrom these teams, I wanted to show that the roster we have built is prepared to face any sort of roster. With all of the two-way forwards, we’re best prepared to face modern offenses that are predicated on three-pointers and driving, but we’re still prepared for anything….\n\nBut what about the players who were cut? Could we beat a team of players scorned? If we were to build a team using Team USA’s strategy, we would just take the best players regardless of fit. Could a team of players scorned beat us? The twelve-man roster (which I’m constructing with significantly less thought) is as follows:\n\nGuards: John Wall (2017), Kyle Lowry (2016), Jimmy Butler (2017), Brandon Roy (2009), Vince Carter (2001)\n\nForwards: Carmelo Anthony (2014), Andrei Kirilenko (2004), Blake Griffin (2014), Paul Millsap (2016), Gordon Hayward (2017)\n\nCenters: Rudy Gobert (2017), Marcus Camby (2008)\n\nTo some folks, this might actually look like a better team than the one that we’ve built. I agree that this team has more offensive talent, but it would struggle with spacing issues and personality issues (especially alpha status between Butler, Roy, Carter, Wall, and Melo). Let’s pretend that their coach Rick Adelman makes them all like each other. How does our team match up? Well this team’s best lineup, in my opinion, is as follows:\n\nWall, Butler, Hayward, Anthony, and Kirilenko (or Gobert).\n\nSole Collector\n\nThis lineup can easily catch fire, and their individual offensive talent is off-the-charts. Plus, Butler, Hawyard, and Kirilenko (kinda Melo) can switch on defense and cause a bit of mayhem. All five players are comfortable bringing the ball up especially on the break, and they all must be defended for spot-up shots (though you can definitely give up that shot to Wall, Butler, and Kirilenko). So to counter this, I would toss out the following:\n\nConley, Ginobili, Allen, George, and Draymond\n\nFight small ball with small ball. In a single game situation, the other team might beat us once in a while, but I’ve constructed the team to last 82 games plus a playoffs. I’m rolling with our guys.\n\nTo finally cap off everything, I’m going to go through some of the players that I cut and briefly (I’ll try) defend why I cut them. Here it goes.\n\nDefending My Cuts\n\nCarmelo Anthony 2014\n\nI’ve never been a huge believer in Melo. He’s been to the Conference Finals once, shown a poor attitude (like when he refused to sub out of a game in Denver), doesn’t defend particularly well, and he isn’t a willing passer. He’s a transcendent scorer, but I value that less than other attributes.\n\nBlake Griffin 2014\n\nFull disclosure: Blake was on the team until I started writing this. He’s a tremendous passer and a dominant scorer and rebounder. His perimeter defense is actually underrated, and his jumpshot is serviceable. Unfortunately, I think he’s most effective with the ball in his hands, and I wanted to move away from players like that. With the smaller roster, Blake would probably be pushed into the center position, but I can’t have a center that can’t defend the rim (for reference, Blake ranks between Channing Frye and Enes Kanter here. Not great company).\n\nJimmy Butler 2017\n\nThe savior of Chicago this past year, Jimmy exploded as an incredible two-way player. Unfortunately his alpha complex pissed of Rose and Noah a few years ago, and his three-point shooting isn’t enough to be a reliable spot-up man. He can score and facilitate, but like Griffin, he needs the ball. It’s a shame because we could’ve used his defense.\n\nJohn Wall 2017\n\nSimply put, Wall’s half-court scoring ability is atrocious. He’s dominant on the fastbreak, and he passes as well as anyone, but he can’t reliably score with the game on the line (side note: I’m not a big fan of judging a player off one game, but this article does a good job of summing up my concerns). He shot 34% on open and wide open threes last year. Plus, he’s had some personality issues with people throughout the years.\n\nKyle Lowry 2016\n\nYou know that one restaurant that consistently has great food? I mean, that place where you walk in with some buddies, order an appetizer, and everyone is fighting over the last piece of it? Then, when the meal comes, conversations are curbed and replaced by your friends Instagramming the food, loud and constant “MMMMs,” and the the repetition of the phrase, “We have to come back here!” It’s been a great meal, so you all dive in on a dessert, one of those big ones that everyone shares with a fork. Silver slices delicate chocolate/apple/milky goodness, and you plop it in your mouth. Pause. You all look nervously at one another. Chewing slows down, and at least one person conspicuously lifts a napkin to their lips. The dessert is chalky/bitter/undercooked/eggy/ bland. It literally wipes the delicious taste of your entree from your mouth, and you’re forced to stop at a local doughnut shop on the way home to avoid this agonizing experience. That’s Kyle Lowry’s regular season and post-season in a nutshell.\n\nBrandon Roy 2009\n\nLook, I love Brandon Roy. He’s unnervingly clutch, led the second best offensive team in 2009, and garnered the following praise from Kobe Bryant:\n\nKobe Bryant was asked who the toughest player for him to guard in the Western Conference on the John Thompson Show the other day. This was Kobe’s response:\n\n“Roy 365 days, seven days a week. Roy has no weaknesses in his game.”\n\n– Ryne Nelson, “Kobe Bryant: Roy over Durant,” 2010\n\nThe issue with Roy is that his game isn’t suited for a star-studded, egalitarian basketball team. Like Jimmy Butler (and, appropriately, Kobe), Roy dominated with the ball in his hands with a series of step-backs, pull-ups, and drives. He facilitated at a solid level, but not at a game-changing level.\n\nVince Carter 2001\n\nHere’s an excerpt of misdeeds Carter committed against Toronto:\n\n(a) his being accused in the Tacoma News Tribune of tipping off the Seattle SuperSonics about the Raptors’ plays — a month before he stopped playing for Toronto; (b) distorting his face in derision and mocking the Air Canada Centre crowd for chanting “MVP” at Chris Bosh during a Raps-Nets game this season; and, worst of all, (c) telling broadcaster John Thompson he didn’t push himself as hard as he could have when he worked and lived north of the border.\n\n– Adam Proteau, “How Our Love for Vince Carter Turned to Hate,” 2007\n\nNot cool with any of that. Sorry Vince.\n\nKyrie Irving 2017\n\nI fought with this one for a while because of his Finals experience and nearly unprecedented isolation scoring ability, but he’s not a willing passer, possibly doesn’t put winning first, is one of the worst defenders in the leauge, and, according to NBAWOWY data, hasn’t led the Cavs to a positive On/Off differential without LeBron on the court with him. In short: I think Kyrie is extremely overrated.\n\nRudy Gobert 2017\n\nHaving Gobert back up Wallace would’ve been an immovable defensive choice, but his injury in the first round of the playoffs concerns me. Also, he doesn’t have the intangible leadership abilities of Yao.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko 2004\n\nKirilenko was a superstar, and I strongly believe that a combination of injuries and Jerry Sloan’s coaching style stifled an illustrious career. He played 13 years too early, for his defensive switching ability might rival Draymond’s. I ultimately went with Giannis over him because they were the same age (using AK47’s 2004 season), and I wanted somebody who was more dominant on the break. I still kind of regret not bumping someone else for AK47…\n\nFor now, that’s a good enough list of players and why they didn’t make the team. If you’re just dying to know why I cut 2007 Josh Smith or 2005 Elton Brand, please tweet at me, comment on this post, or hit me up on Facebook.\n\nThat’s it! You have stuck with this series through thick and thin. I’m sure you’ve disagreed with some things along the way, but I feel very comfortable with the team that we have constructed. After 10,000 some words, this still feels incomplete, so if I think of anything else, I’ll revisit the series at some point in the future.\n\nAs always, all stats from Basketball Reference, Stats.NBA, and NBAWOWY.\n\nArticle length: about 2,700 words.\n\nThis is it, the conclusion of the actual roster construction. Please take some time and go read part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, and part 5. Last three players. Let’s do this!\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo 2016-17\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – Most Improved Player, All-NBA 2nd Team, 7th in MVP Voting, All-Star, 6th in Two-Point Field Goals, 9th in Free Throws, 9th in Total Steals, 5th in Total Blocks, 10th in PER, 7th in Block Percentage, 9th in DWS, 10th in WS, 8th in BPM, 4th in DBPM, and 4th in VORP.\n\nPlayoffs – 3rd in Steals Per Game, 5th in Blocks Per Game, and 1st in Defensive Rating\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nYep, I’m taking a homerific flyer on Giannis. In general, I prefer players who are a little bit older – a little bit more seasoned – and are battle tested in the playoffs. Giannis is neither of these two: he’s only 22, and he just went through his first playoffs as a significant contributor (where, I might add, I was pleasantly impressed). Furthermore, he played most effectively with the ball in his hand, and he pretty much as no jumpshot even though he plays the 3 or 4 position.\n\nUltimately, I’m taking Giannis because he is the most dynamic player in the NBA. Westbrook is more dynamic on the offensive end, and Draymond is more dynamic on defense, but when you look at both ends of the court, nobody brings it with the same intensity as Giannis. In fact, his intensity has drawn the ire of both John Wall and LeBron James for what I consider petty reasons, but anyone who brings it against The King and gets the best of him is a competitor in my book.\n\nNot only does Giannis bring a high level intensity on a nightly basis, but he has a unicorn-like skillset that allows him to dominate both ends. Steve Shea, a mathematics professor, developed a couple of defensive statistics called IDR and PDR. The short version is that IDR quantifies a player’s interior defense while PDR quantifies a player’s perimeter defense (for more info, read this article). I grouped the top 20 performers in each category and plotted them on a scatter plot. The results are as follows:\n\nLet’s unpack this. This graph can be split into four quadrants: positive defenders in the paint and on the perimeter (the upper right quadrant), positive perimeter defenders and negative paint defenders (the bottom right quadrant), positive paint defenders and negative perimeter defenders (the upper left quadrant), and negative defenders in the painting and on the perimeter (the bottom left quadrant). The trend line shows that, at least for this sample, when interior defense increases, perimeter defense decreases. The two points I circled are dominant in both: the furthest right is Draymond, and the other is Giannis. Giannis is the only player out of this top-40 sample to score above a 4 in both categories (PDR=4.7; IDR=4.3), but to be fair, Draymond was very close and boasted the second highest perimeter score (PDR=8.1; IDR=3.8). That level of defensive flexibility is invaluable in today’s NBA.\n\nAs I said before though, Giannis’ unique abilities aren’t simply on the defensive end. Even though he has a terrible jumpshot, he makes up for it in other ways. The two most efficient play types in the NBA are cuts and transition possessions, and Giannis ranks highly in both. Check out the following two graphs. The first plots out the top-20 transition scorers by total transition possessions last year.\n\nFor anyone interested, the inefficient but relentless player with ~550 possessions is Westbrook. Giannis’ 1.28 points per transition possession (league average is 1.104) beat out LeBron, Curry, Thomas, Wall, and Harden (the only two he didn’t beat out were Beal and Durant). Transition buckets can be a moral shredder for the opposition and moral booster for a team, and nobody electrified the NBA like Giannis on the fast-break last year.\n\nThe next chart plots out the top-20 players by total cut possessions through last year.\n\nRudy Gobert outpaced everyone with the total number of cut possessions, but Giannis’ 1.5 points per cut possession (league average is 1.89) topped all of the top-20 in efficiency. For being unable to provide typical floor-spacing, Giannis maximizes his abilities to keep defenders on their toes.\n\nBeyond all this technical jargon, Giannis is simply a good dude who brings a certain charm to the locker room. You can never have enough guys like this around, and with all that said, that’s why I feel good about the Giannis pick (one other player is creepily similar to Giannis’ skillset, but I’ll discuss that in the final section). Giannis’s skillset is as follows:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Giannis 7 6 8 7\n\nNow to my final two selections….and admittedly, I could be swayed on either one with a convincing argument. For now, let’s welcome these two to the roster.\n\nYao Ming 2008-09\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – All-NBA 2nd Team, All-Star, 6th in Defensive Rebounds, 8th in Total Rebounds, 6th in Total Blocks, 8th in Field Goal Percentage, 5th in TS%, 9th in Block Percentage, 8th in Defensive Rating, 5th in DWS, 10th in WS, and 8th in WS/48.\n\nPlayoffs – 5th in Rebounds Per Game, 3rd in Defensive Rebound Percentage.\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nYao is, by pretty much every modern NBA standard, a dinosaur: he’s enormous, not particularly mobile, and his skillset is better equipped for a 2002 roster than a 2017 roster. Even he stated that players of his size would struggle in today’s league because of the popularity of the three-pointer. Take that as you will, but remember that Yao was always one of the most modest NBA players. I strongly believe that he’d find a role on a title contender.\n\nIn a Grantland piece about conservative defenses (defenses that don’t foul or force turnovers much), Lowe stated the following about elite rim protectors:\n\nSure enough, the list of good ultraconservative teams includes teams featuring peak Tim Duncan and Yao Ming. Broaden the criteria just a tad — by mere fractions of percentage points — and more Duncan/Yao teams pop up, along with the very best Dwight Howard–era Orlando teams. Adelman’s defenses in Houston may have been the best in the league over a three-year semi-healthy Yao stretch, and they all played the same way — low turnovers, low fouls, and a “passive” pick-and-roll defense in which Yao dropped back toward the rim and the Rockets’ perimeter defenders funneled ball handlers toward either Yao or the sidelines.\n\n-Zach Lowe, “The Delicate Balance of an NBA Defense,” 2014\n\nLooking at the roster we have constructed so far, I can assure you that it’s defensive scheme will be much less conservative with players like George, Marion, Giannis, and Draymond roaming around; however, having Ben Wallace and Yao allows for more defensive flexibility.\n\nBeyond his defense, Yao provides paint presence on offense that this team simply doesn’t have. He was immeasurably skilled posting up, and he could provide some midrange floor-spacing for players driving to the basket. Lineups wouldn’t be able to run-and-gun as effectively with Yao, but in a half-court set, he might be the most valuable player on the team because of the double teams that he would demand. I know that he would be exhausted against a small-ball lineup, but who in the modern NBA could guard him one-on-one? DeAndre Jordan? Rudy Gobert? A healthy Joel Embiid? A motivated Dwight Howard? The point is that the number is very low, and even during Yao’s time when much larger centers roamed the paint, teams needed to double team him, and Yao’s intelligent passing would go far surrounded by the likes of Klay, Peja, Conley, and Ray. There’s a reason that Bill Simmons listed him 7th in his NBA Trade Value column back in 2009. The only players he listed above Yao were Kobe, Wade, Duncan, Chris Paul, Howard, and LeBron. Pretty good company.\n\n12/12 from the field? What?\n\nWe also can’t talk about Yao’s offense without looking at his absurd free throw percentage. He shot 86% from the line in 2008-09 (90% in the playoffs) while standing at 7′ 6″ and weighing over 300 pounds! Now you have to double him because fouling him is just about the worst offensive strategy. In fact, if you look at the top-20 free throw percentage seasons by a player standing 7′ or taller, Yao takes four of the spots and holds the tenth best season ever (Dirk takes 11 of the spots and holds the top-nine best season ever…soak that in for a second).\n\nFinally, and the main reason I chose him instead of a couple of other centers, Yao was simply an extraordinary teammate. Players loved playing with him, and star players rarely showed the support and excitement that Yao displayed. In the oft hyperbolic The Players’ Tribune, Jeff Van Gundy, usually known for his hyper-criticism, wrote a touching piece about coaching Yao. Just go read the article because it is a glowing piece about an exceptional person. One segment stood out to me though:\n\nMuch like Tim Duncan and Steve Nash, Yao was a unifying leader. I believe that if a great player is also a compassionate, caring, unselfish teammate, then his team’s chemistry is going to be exceptional. That’s what Yao did every day, in every way.\n\nIf you go back and watch Rockets games from that era, don’t pay attention to what Yao does when he was on the court. Instead, pay attention to the 15 minutes a game when he was on the bench. On every good play, he was standing up and cheering as loud as any fan. Whenever a timeout was called, Yao’s the first man off the bench to greet his teammates.\n\n– Jeff Van Gundy, “The Coaching Honor of a Lifetime,” 2017\n\nThere’s a reason that the Suns tracked high-fives this last season. Camaraderie matters.\n\nYao’s skillset is as follows:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Yao 4 7 8 8\n\nWe have one player left, and my concerns about him have nothing to do with his skill-level. Let’s see if it’s all worth it.\n\nDeron Williams 2009-10\n\nPhoto Credit: Zimbio\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – All-NBA 2nd Team, 9th in MVP Voting, All-Star, 2nd in Total Assists, 3rd in Assist Percentage, 10th in OWS and 9th in OBPM.\n\nPlayoffs – 1st in Assists Per Game and 3rd in Assist Percentage.\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nYears ago, before Deron’s ill-fated performance in the 2017 Finals, asking if Chris Paul or Deron Williams was the better point guard was (supposedly) a legitimate question. In 2008, GM Dumars said the following:\n\nThey are the best two young point guards in the league. In fact, I don’t see how you can rank any point guard ahead of them. They have an ability not only to be great themselves but to make their teammates and teams better. If you and I are picking between the two, I’ll take the one you don’t take and be the happiest man in the room.\n\n– Ric Bucher, “How Do You Know…Who’s Better?”, 2008\n\nThat time has long since passed, and my setiments on the argumet can be summarized nicely by Mr. Barbour:\n\nIn the case of who the best point guard in the NBA is, the answer is indisputably Chris Paul with no basis for arguing any differently. Every time the question of who is the best NBA point guard is asked and the answer given is not Chris Paul, it is both an insult to Paul and a display of ignorance by the answerer.\n\n– David Barbour, “Chris Paul vs. Deron Williams: Ending the Debate Once and for All,” 2010\n\nDespite those strong words, Deron Williams was still an extraordinarily good point guard that ran a well-oiled offense. What entices me about Deron is his ability to succeed both with the ball and off the ball. It’s common knowledge that Deron excelled running the pick-and-roll, but if you go back and watch film of those Jazz teams, he would often dish the ball immediately and either post up or run through some screens. Unfortunately, we don’t have shot data from this year, but if we did, I’d be willing to bet that Deron was a top-tier post-up guard and an above-average spot up shooter.\n\nOn his post-up ability, Deron has always been a bulkier point guard. While his rival, Chris Paul, was more lithe and slippery, Deron was built like a line-backer, and he knew how to use his size and strength to abuse smaller guards which makes sense considering his interest in MMA and his state championship in wrestling.\n\nThe issue with that size is how detrimental it is to his speed. Deron wasn’t a particularly good defender, but for guards who like to post-up, I’d say he was actually solid; however, he might be a defensive liability if we were playing the Warriors. Curry and Thompson are the last two guys you’d want Deron guarding.\n\nOne interesting fact about Deron is that he didn’t rely on the pick-and-roll as much as much as sports pundits would have you believe. Jerry Sloan’s reason for this is as follows:\n\nYou’ve got to learn how to play other ways than just strictly pick-and-roll. Most of the time, other guys are just standing in the pick-and-roll. We try to run other stuff where they’re not standing and stay active in other parts of the game.\n\n– Jonathan Abrams, “The Pick-and-Roll is the N.B.A.’s Old Reliable,” 2009\n\nThat’s another plus for Deron because it shows that he can thrive in varied NBA offenses. Will I use him with Draymond Green in a pick-and-roll with Peja and Klay in opposite corners? Absolutely, but he will also bring more to the offense than that skillset.\n\nTo sum this all up, I have a couple of deep concerns about Deron that are really making me reconsider this selection. First of all, he essentially drove legendary coach Jerry Sloan out of Utah because Deron wanted more flexibility in the offense. Many stories have circulated about Sloan’s tight and old-school grip on the team, but this sort of behavior regarding a coach is unacceptable.\n\nThe most damning anecdote about Deron comes from Paul Pierce and his time in Brooklyn. While none of what he says is flattering, this excerpt really hits Deron hard:\n\n“Before I got there, I looked at Deron as an MVP candidate,” Pierce said. “But I felt once we got there, that’s not what he wanted to be. He just didn’t want that.\n\n“I think a lot of the pressure got to him sometimes. This was his first time in the national spotlight. The media in Utah is not the same as the media in New York, so that can wear on some people. I think it really affected him.”\n\n– Jackie MacMullen, “Wizard’s Paul Pierce Speaks the Truth,” 2015\n\nJesus, what have I done with this selection??? Look, my psycho-analysis of this tells me that Deron struggled being the leader of a team both on the court and emotionally. He had all the physical tools, but he didn’t have the killer mentality to be “the guy.” On this team though, I don’t want him to be that guy. I want him to thrive as a backup point guard that can come in and wreak havoc with a lineup of dangerous shooters and fastbreak freaks. I want him to run off ball, hit open threes, throw some no look lobs, and post-up smaller guards. I want Deron’s talent. Let’s hope Ben Wallace can keep him in check.\n\nHere’s Deron’s skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Williams 9 6 4 4\n\nThere you have it! The team is finally assembled! The final roster is as follows:\n\nGuards: Mike Conley, Deron Williams, Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, and Manu Ginobili\n\nForwards: Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Peja Stojakovic, Shawn Marion, and Paul George\n\nCenters: Ben Wallace and Yao Ming\n\nTune in next time when I break down the roster, talk about strategy, select a coach, and defend why I didn’t choose certain players (I can hear Carmelo and Blake fans sharpening their pitchforks already).\n\nThanks to Basketball Reference, NBAWOWY, and Stats.NBA for the user-friendly stats.\n\nArticle length: about 2,200 words.\n\nPlease check out part 1and part 2 to catch yourself up. So far, the team has Mike Conley, Ray Allen, and Draymond Green.\n\nI’m a big fan of what Boston has been doing this offseason with stockpiling forwards. Currently, after the recent Avery Bradley trade, they have Brown, Tatum, Hayward, Morris, and Crowder all of whom deserve ample playing time. Bleacher Report alludes to this in a recent interview with Stevens:\n\nThe new era of the NBA requires versatility to win, and the Boston Celtics are adjusting.\n\n“I don’t have the five positions anymore,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said, per Kareem Copeland of the Associated Press. “It may be as simple as three positions now, where you’re either a ball-handler, a wing or a big.\n\n“It’s really important. We’ve become more versatile as the years have gone on.”\n\n– Rob Goldberg, “Brad Stevens Says Celtics Have 3, Not 5, Positions Now,” 2017\n\nEven though he’s not 100% correct on that, I like this mentality, and this is the sort of versatility we’ll need on our team. So, let’s continue by adding the most versatile defensive center in all of NBA history.\n\nBen Wallace 2003-04\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – All Defense 1st-Team, All-Star, 7th in MVP Voting, 2nd in Offensive Rebounds, 2nd in Defensive Rebounds, 2nd in Total Rebounds, 6th in Total Steals, 2nd in Total Blocks, 1st in Defensive Rating, 1st in Defensive Win Shares, 1st in DBPM, and 4th in VORP.\n\nPlayoffs – T-2nd Total Minutes, 1st in Offensive Rebounds, 1st in Defensive Rebounds, 1st in Total Rebounds, 1st in Steals, 1st in Blocks, 1st in Defensive Rating, 1st in Defensive Win Shares, 3rd in Win Shares, 1st in DBPM, 1st in VORP, and 2nd in BPM.\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nI admittedly have a soft spot for Ben Wallace. When I first really started getting into basketball, Big Ben was by far my favorite player. That interest dissipated for a while, but in the advent of advanced stats and old game footage, he’s climbed his way back into one of my all-time favorites.\n\nDepending on who you ask, Wallace is the best or at least a top-5 defensive player in the history of the NBA. His teams have always showcased astounding defensive abilities even when he was past his prime, and the mid-2000s Pistons were some of the stingiest defensive teams of all time. Just like Bill Russell before him, some discount just how effective he was on defensive because of his size (he’s listed at just 6’9″), but I believe that his height was actually helpful on two fronts: first, since he was strong like an ox, his low center of gravity made him near impossible to back down, and second, he was able to step out and switch on defense.\n\nIn our current league, Wallace wouldn’t deal with as many post-ups as the mid-2000s, but some players like Whiteside still shoot around 5 times per game from the post. What greatly intrigues me about Ben was his switching ability combined with his rim protecting ability (much like Draymond Green like I discussed in this article). I highly suggest that you spend some time watching some game footage from the Pistons and Magic playoff series in 2003 where Tracy McGrady, possibly the most dominant offensive threat at the time, bashed his head against Pistons’ wall. You’ll see that on many pick-and-rolls, Wallace simply switches onto McGrady without the guard fighting over the screen. This is part of their defensive scheme! If Wallace can “guard” (“guard” meaning as well as anyone can guard a transcendent scorer) on some defensive possessions, then we can trust him to handle most any taller shooting guards and forwards (I’m thinking guys like Hayward, Butler, LeBron, George and not necessarily smaller players like Curry or Thomas).\n\nBesides some advanced stats like VORP, DBMP, and Basketball Reference’s Defensive Rating, we don’t have much to quantify Wallace’s impact on the defensive end. One of my favorites (but still very flawed) is the On/Off Ratings, but these only go back to 2009 (and NBAWOWY’s data expands even less), so the last Wallace season that we can look at is his post-prime Cavaliers stint. In his more limited role, he still posted the best On/Off Defensive Rating on the team holding opposing offenses to a stifling 94.9 points/100 possessions while he was on the court and 101.6 points/100 possessions while he was off. Imagine how useful prime Wallace would have been….But let’s use numbers and not just imagine! When I tweeted at NBA Math for Ben Wallace’s numbers compared to everyone else in history on defense, they sent the following image with Rudy Gobert and Mark Eaton highlighted:\n\nUsing data from 1973 onward, this graph plots TPA which plots Offensive Points Added and Defensive Points Saved. Eaton is red, Wallace is yellow, and Gobert is blue. While Wallace is clearly a negative on the offensive end, this shows that his defensive abilities are nearly unmatched (just in case it’s difficult for you to read the axes, dots on the far right indicate a huge offensive impact while dots higher up indicate a huge defensive impact). Let’s look at his theoretical skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Ben Wallace 2 1 10 9\n\nWhile Ben’s rebounding faltered a bit from being a 10 in previous years, I opted for his 2003-04 season because of the ferocity and confidence with which he played throughout the playoffs. He went toe-to-toe with apex Shaq and never blinked. His defense throughout that year is also possibly the best in the modern NBA by most every metric. I want his tenacious D (and the pick-and-roll defense of destiny) and unmatched work ethic. I hate using teammate praise because you generally have to take it with an ocean of salt, but Jerry Stackhouse hyped up Wallace with some of the highest praise possible:\n\n“I’ve played with a lot of great players: Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Grant Hill,” says the Wizards guard. “Ben Wallace’s name belongs in that list too, but for some reason people don’t think of him as the kind of player whose name belongs on the marquee. I don’t understand why. He belongs way up at the top.”\n\n– ESPN.com, “From the Archives: A Ben Wallace Feature Article,” 2006\n\nEdit: As if he were reading my blog, Jerry Stackhouse said on Zach Lowe’s Podcast that he literally released today that if he were to rank the best players with whom he ever played, it would be in this order (skip to about the 51-minute mark):\n\nDirk Nowitzki\n\nGrant Hill\n\nAllen Iverson\n\nBen Wallace\n\n[Wizards] Michael Jordan\n\nThat is some crazy high praise!\n\nPlus, Ben Wallace (with the exception of Karl Malone) has the greatest bodybuilder physique in NBA history.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nI can’t believe I’ve taken so long to make my next pick, but if I’m building a team that exemplifies championship pedigree, I can’t go further without bringing this guy into the fold.\n\nManu Ginobili 2007-08\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – Sixth Man of the Year, All-NBA 3rd Team, 6th in WS/48 minutes, 3rd in BPM, 4th in OBPM, and 4th in VORP\n\nPlayoffs – 3rd in Total Three Pointers Made\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nManu might be the most underrated player in NBA history, and if you do a Google dive into the great things people have said about him, you could easily fill a week’s worth of reading. I’ll try and condense my favorites, but the clear takeaway is that Manu is a crafty playmaker who competes with a vicious drive. It’s tough to glean any of this from Manu’s numbers, but his lack of numbers actually shows something even more important to me: a willingness to sacrifice personal stardom for the greater good. Pop convinced him that coming off the bench would help the team succeed, and after a long career, Manu walks away as one of the winningest basketball players in history.\n\nManu brings a resume to this team that screams “leader” and “winner” (remember, this is prior to 2008): Three championships (2003, 2005, 2007), two Italian MVP awards (2001, 2002), a Euroleague Finals MVP (2001), an Italian Cup MVP (2002), a FIBA Americas Championship MVP (2001), and, one of the most impressive basketball accomplishments ever, an Olympic Gold where he led Argentina to its first and only gold medal in basketball that includes a victory over the USA team that had Duncan, LeBron, Melo, AI, Wade, and Amar’e (2004).\n\nDuring a pickup game with free agents back in September of 2007, Manu dived out of bounds through three players to retrieve a ball, and the player to whom he saved it scored. Zach Lowe writes that the following happened\n\n[Popovich] gathered everyone and asked them: “What does that play mean to you?” Popovich told them Ginobili wanted to win more than anyone on the floor, and that if the Spurs wished to repeat after their 2007 title, they would all need to play that hard. Popovich walked away, and everyone thought the speech was over. Suddenly, he turned: “And Manu: It’s f—ing September. Never do that again in September.”\n\n“I was honestly scared and afraid for how he would hold up over time,” Popovich said. “I get chills thinking about it now.”\n\nDuncan laughed at the memory. “Things like that happened with Manu,” he said. “It was like, ‘Manu, dude, calm down. We are just trying to make it out of practice in one piece.'”\n\n– Zach Lowe, “Welcome to Manu’s Basketball Familia,” 2016\n\nA competitive drive means very little if you don’t have the skills to back it up. Ginobili had the skill plus some. Besides his absurd passing ability and popularizing of the ubiquitous Euro-Step, Manu’s offensive game included absolutely no holes. He simply had no weaknesses. In an excellent article by Michael Lewis, Lewis speaks with defensive aficionado Shane Battier about how to defend certain players. Battier begins by discussing Kobe and ends with Manu. The bolded section is my emphasis:\n\nPeople often say that Kobe Bryant has no weaknesses to his game, but that’s not really true… For instance, the numbers show [Battier] that Allen Iverson is one of the most efficient scorers in the N.B.A. when he goes to his right; when he goes to his left he kills his team. The Golden State Warriors forward Stephen Jackson is an even stranger case. “Steve Jackson,” Battier says, “is statistically better going to his right, but he loves to go to his left — and goes to his left almost twice as often.” The San Antonio Spurs’ Manu Ginóbili is a statistical freak: he has no imbalance whatsoever in his game — there is no one way to play him that is better than another. He is equally efficient both off the dribble and off the pass, going left and right and from any spot on the floor.\n\n– Michael Lewis, “The No-Stats All-Star,” 2009\n\nThe greatest description that I’ve ever read of how to be an effective basketball player (or, really anything) comes from an obscure two-part blog post by “DewNO” where he combines the philosophy of Jorge Borges and the skillset of Manu Ginobili. In this, he states:\n\n“What if being a great player isn’t about having the best or the most spots, or having a tall, high release? What if being a great player means that being chased off your spot…is itself one of your spots?”\n\n– DewNO, “Manu and Borges: The Infinite Chase, Part 1”, 2012\n\nfollowed by:\n\nYou can force Manu to take bad shots. It’s even possible – depending on the phases of the moon – to convince him to launch a three from contortions that make even Manu subject to chance. And he does miss sometimes. But you can’t chase him off his spot, because he has only one. His spot is basketball itself, and chasing him off his spot? Well, you can try your hardest, but the chase is also going to be basketball (a little trickier, certainly) so he’s going to handle it pretty well. Don’t blame yourself.\n\n– DewNo, “Manu and Borges: The Infinite Chase, Part 2,” 2012\n\nIt’s a sexy way of saying “expect the unexpected,” but Manu embodied this playstyle. His snaking moves and crafty demeanor, as Battier discusses above, makes him impossible to slow down because if you guard him as well as you can, that new, uncomfortable position will become Manu’s best spot. You can’t guard a player that can so creatively play offense on the fly.\n\nPersonally, #8 is my favorite, but man you can’t go wrong with any of these. #1 is simply ridiculous.\n\nI didn’t spend much time discussing Manu’s defense because there’s not much information about it. Most defensive statistics point to him being above average, but this could be skewed by his excellent ability to steal the ball. Ginobili always had a nack for knowing the offense’s next move, so, like a “Roamer” that I discuss in this article, Ginobili’s value on defense lies in his disruption. Could he stay in front of his man? Absolutely. Was he a lockdown 1-to-1 defender like Avery Bradley? No, but his abilities proved to be more valuable than simple footwork. Look no further than his game-winning block against James Harden in the 2017 playoffs (let me remind you that Manu is 39 in this clip and Harden was voted 2nd in MVP):\n\nOr how about that time he blocked Kevin Durant’s dunk on the break:\n\nManu’s skillset then breaks down as follows:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Manu Ginobili 7 7 7 5\n\nSo far, our team has the following players: Mike Conley, Ray Allen, Draymond Green, Ben Wallace, and Manu Ginobili. Is that our starting five? Who knows, but I’ll spend a full article discussing possible lineups, strengths, weaknesses, and fuller reasons for why I picked certain players (some players’ worths are contingent upon other players being with them).

To me, this was a no-brainer pick even though Conley has never been an all-star, never been on an All-NBA, and the only accolade he’s ever won was All-Defense 2nd Team (and garnering a 5th place MVP vote in 2013-14). I know that calling Conley underrated has become a platitude, but dammit, it’s true! You can count on one hand the number of players who are tougher than Conley, and the best display of this is when he broke his face during the 2015 playoffs, had the multiple breaks surgically repaired, and missed ONLY ONE GAME! Please read the article that I just linked for a gory account. Just in case you don’t, here are a couple of snippets:\n\n“That night, I was throwing up,” Conley said. “And every time I threw up—because when you do it, you can’t really control this—I’d have to open my mouth. It would just kill me because I couldn’t really open my mouth. Then, all of a sudden, blood would come out of my nose and I was like: I think I’m dying. It was crazy.”\n\n“After I got the CAT scan, they told me I did have a blowout fracture,” Conley said. “I had three fractures at that point: one under my eye, one on the side of my eyebrow, and then there was one that was a displaced fracture almost where my jaw is.” Doctors also told Conley that he had very nearly broken his jaw and likely had a broken nose.\n\n-Rob Mahoney, 2015\n\nAlso, that game for which he returned was game 2 against the eventual champion Warriors. Conley led the Grizzlies to a victory after shooting 8/12 from the field….\n\nSo what? Plenty of players are tough, and if that’s my only crit"
