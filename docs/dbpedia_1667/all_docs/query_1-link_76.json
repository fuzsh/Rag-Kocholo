        "text": "Greatness is intoxicating to watch, but for fans there's also a romance to the idea of the \"late bloomer.\" Ultra-gifted superstar Michael Jordan managed to have it both ways: While Jordan soared as a professional basketball player, he was once was cut from his high school team. The late bloomer reminds us that hard work can pay off and that we aren't trapped in our current circumstances. Of course, at least in a league filled with the tallest, strongest, highest-leaping men, the late bloomer's arrested development is often caused by things outside of his control: the shadow of a more famous player an unstable franchise. Sometimes the bloom is tied to maturation or grit; sometimes it's simply linked to leaving a dysfunctional team.\n\nThe idea of a late bloomer is worryingly subjective, so Stacker dove into the numbers to find a formula with which to anchor a list. Stacker used data from the website Basketball Reference, calculating a combined average for where every NBA player ranked for BPM, VORP, PER, and WS in a given season.\n\nBPM stands for Box Plus/Minus which weighs a player's shooting efficiency, minutes, rebounds, steals, blocks, assists, and more to find how a player stacks up compared to an average NBA player. VORP stands for Value Over Replacement Player and is quantified by dividing a player's BPM by a theoretical replacement player to see how many times more or less valuable they are than that minimum salary player. PER is a stat that measures a player's per-minute efficiency. WS stands for Win Shares and measures the number of points a single player produces and attempts to credit the percentage of his team's wins that he created.\n\nFrom there, Stacker found players that did not finish in the top 50 average rankings in the NBA during the first five years of their career, but who then made it into the top 25 for at least one season after that. In total, 19 players since 1974 fit the bill; they're ranked from 19 to one based on the gap between their highest scoring year and their first five-year, pre-bloom average.\n\nNBA playoffs prominently featuring late bloomers like Tobias Harris and D'Angelo Russell—two stars who needed a change of scenery to come into their full potential—offer the perfect moment to read about the most dramatic late blooms of the NBA's from 1974–2017."
