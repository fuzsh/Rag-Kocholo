        "text": "Celebrity\n\nBronny James\n\n73\n\nBronny James is a legend in his father's mind. Son of NBA legend, LeBron James. Bronny hopes to make a name for himself in the NBA. And with the help his father, LeBron James, forcing the Lakers into drafting Bronny out of nepotism, Bronny's dream of hearing his name called out on draft night finally came true. Granted, he had to wait until the second round, but still it's quite an achievement. Now, he has to prove he deserves the opportunity. Bronny James wasn't the best player on his high school basketball team, but he did make the McDonald's All American team in high school, and he got to play for USC, where his playing time was limited. He didn't have the best college experience, and he suffered a cardiac arrest that nearly ended his career before it got started. Against the advice of experts to stay in school for a few more seasons, Bronny declared for the draft after one season in college. Now, LeBron James gets to make history, and Bronny got his wish.\n\nNba\n\nTHE NBA\n\n443\n\nYou are in the NBA draft and you are the 60th player that got drafted in NBA, and many people don't accept that you are the one who they got, you will need to prove that you deserve to be in the league. (you can choose who you are, name, height, weight, which college you from, etc)\n\nRealistic\n\nPresident LeBron\n\n226\n\nLeBron James is now retired from the NBA. Thank god. Now that he's retired, he wants to run for president of the United States. He has zero political experience apart from voicing his political beliefs on social media. But, he figures if an idiot like Trump can be elected, then there's no reason to think he can't do the same. You are a news reporter at his presidential campaign rally.\n\nRealistic\n\nYao Ming\n\n57\n\nYao Ming was a huge star in the Chinese basketball league, where he would win mvp, and the title for the Shanghai Sharks. When he was drafted into the NBA, he continued his sucess making several all star appearances. While he never won an NBA title, he did bring the audience from China into the NBA which helped the league grow more into a global brand over time.\n\nCelebrity\n\nMark Price\n\n16\n\nMark Price was arguably one of the most underated players in NBA history. Mark Price is considered one of greatest shooters in NBA history, and he was known for his deadly range beyond the arc. He was a journeyman NBA player for most of his career, but he played his best years for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He would make several all star appearances, and he won the three point contest twice. He's also ranked as one of the all time leaders in free throws made and percentage. Mark wasn't a flashy player, as he mainly just did his job on the court.\n\nRealistic\n\nBen Wallace\n\n44\n\nBen Wallace is arguably one of if not the greatest defensive player of all time. He could guard multiple positions from the one to the five on the basketball court. He was named defensive player of the year several times, and he's been on several NBA all defensive teams throughout his career. He lead the league in rebounds twice, and he led the league in blocks in 2002. Ben Wallace played a huge role helping the Pistons make back to back NBA finals appearances, while winning one of them against the Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, the Detroit Pistons would lost their title defense the following year against the San Antonio Spurs. Ben Wallace was mostly a journeyman NBA player, who played on multiple teams throughout his career. However, his most successful stint was with the Detroit Pistons, where he'd win his only championship. Ben Wallace was a high energy lock down defender who could guard almost anyone, and he was a great help defender as well.\n\nCelebrity\n\nMagic Johnson\n\n40\n\nEarvin Johnson is considered arguably the greatest passer in nba history. Mainly known for his no look passes, and sometimes behind the back no look passes. Magic could also play any position on the basketball court from point guard, shooting guard, power forward, small forward and center. He mainly played point guard throughout most of his career. Nicknamed \"Magic\" because of his prolific passes to generate an up tempo offense that was uncommon in the nba. This would later give the Los Angeles Lakers the nickname \"showtime Lakers.\" Magic Johnson was very charismatic off the court in interviews, but on the court? He could trash talk with the best of them. Magic won a national championship with Michigan State in college, and he would go on to win multiple championships in the nba with various appearances in the nba finals during the 1980s. He's a former Olympic champion from the 1990s original dream team. Forced into retirement because of his HIV positive status.\n\nRealistic\n\nCheng Wynn\n\n7\n\nCheng sucks playing basketball in spite of the fact that he's been playing it since he was a kid. He barely made it as a bench warmer as one of the worst college teams in the nation. And when he tried out for the NBA G-league, he didn't make the cut. However, when he heard how the WNBA might allow biological men who identify as women to play for their league, he jumped at the opportunity. Openly lying that he's a lesbian girl trapped in a man's body, or a biological man who identifies as a lesbian woman. He figures since men are naturally stronger and faster than women generally, he'll easily dominate in the WNBA. You can be whoever you want.\n\nCelebrity\n\nLarry Bird\n\n43\n\nLarry Bird played for the Boston Celtics in arguably the best era in nba history. Larry Bird was known for his killer instincts on the court, and he was quite the trash talker too. Larry Bird is arguably one of the best shooters in nba history as well, as he still remains the only nba player to ever score double figures in a game without missing. a shot. Larry Bird would go on to win multiple championships during the 1980s, and he helped his team to make multiple finals appearances. Although he shared an intense on the court rivalry with both Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, he remained good friends with them off the court. Larry Bird is still regarded as one of the best Boston Celtics players to have ever played. Some would even argue he was the team's best player historically. One thing is for sure. Larry Bird would always put on a show for his fans and his opponents. Like Michael Jordan, Larry didn't just want to win. He wanted to beat the best while doing it.\n\nRealistic\n\nKevin Johnson\n\n31\n\nKevin Johnson is arguably one of the most underated players in NBA history. He made the all star team several times in the 90s after earning most improved player award in 1989. He played alongside fellow hall of famer in Charles Barkley, and they both helped lead the Phoenix Suns to the NBA finals together only to lose in six games to the Chicago Bulls. Kevin Johnson wasn't the most flashy player in the NBA, but he was a solid point guard that could play defense, and he was a pass first point guard. If not for having most of his career derailed by injuries, Kevin Johnson may have been one of the best point guards of all time.\n\nRealistic\n\nAllen Iverson\n\n21\n\nAllen Iverson was always a controversial player in the NBA because he broke the mold of what many expected out of an NBA superstar at the time. When many NBA players tried to present a wholesome family image for the media, Allen wasn't shy about staying true to who he was, as he grew up in the streets. Allen Iverson may have talked like a gangsta, but he always played with a lot of heart on the basketball court. Granted, he was often criticized for not taking practices seriously enough by his coaches, but Allen Iverson just wanted to do things his way. Allen Iverson never won an NBA title, but he had the heart of a champion nonetheless. Allen Iverson won rookie of the year and an mvp a few years afterwards. He wasn't a great defender, but he had quick hands that allowed him to rack up steals easily for his team. Allen Iverson led his Philadelphia 76ers team to the NBA finals, after being crowned mvp. Unfortunately, they would get outmatched in the NBA finals by the Lakers\n\nRealistic\n\nReggie Miller\n\n12\n\nNicknamed \"Miller Time.\" Before Steph Curry became known for his range, Reggie Miller was infamously known for draining three pointers all the time in the NBA. He was also named the most clutch shooter of all time by various sports media in the 1990s, even over Michael Jordan who was ranked a close second to Reggie Miller. Reggie wasn't much of a defender, but he knew how to move without the ball. He also was deadly beyond the arc, as he even shot two three pointers in a row to beat the New York Knicks once. Reggie Miller is also the only player that lead his team to push the 1990s Chicago Bulls to seven games in the playoffs. Unfortunately, Reggie Miller never won a championship. He only made it to the NBA finals once, but his Indiana Pacers team was outmatched by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nRealistic\n\nShaquille O'Neal\n\n29\n\nIt's Shaquille O'Neal. He's gone by many nicknames in his career from being known as \"The Diesel\", \"The big Aristotle\", and \"Big Shamrock\" to name a few. Shaquille O'Neal was arguably the biggest and most dominant big man of the 2000s era, as he was so fast and strong that hardly anyone could stop him unless they made him shoot free throws. Shaquille was a notoriously bad free throw shooter to the point that he set records with his low free throws made and percentages. Shaquille was drafted by the Orlando Magic, and he helped lead them to the NBA finals where they would get swept by the Houston Rockets. Shaquille O'Neal would eventually sign with the Los Angeles Lakers where he would go on to win three championships in a row in the early 2000s, and another title years later when he was traded to the Miami Heat. Shaquille was quite the trash talker, and he wasn't afraid to make his opinions known publicly to the media.\n\nRealistic\n\nHakeem Olajuwon\n\n15\n\nNicknamed \"The Dream.\" Hakeem Olajuwon was ahead of his time. Although he could post up and rebound with the best centers in the NBA, he also had a great mid range game too that often helped spread the floor for his teammates. Hakeem could play like a guard in spite being seven feet tall. I know in the modern NBA, that's common considering the NBA has been more about positionless basketball. But back in the 80s and 90s when Hakeem played? It wasn't that common, so Hakeem was unique for his time. He won back to back titles for the Houston Rockets, and he was part of the third dream team for team USA after he got his green card to become an official citizen of the United States. Hakeem was born in Lagos, Nigeria. His patented move was the shake and bake move that was infamously used during his second title run. His coach would say, \"Never underestimate the heart of a champion.\" Hakeem certainly had the heart of a champion.\n\nRealistic\n\nDennis Rodman\n\n26\n\nDennis Rodman was known for being one of the most obnoxiously physical and trash talking nba players in history. Nicknamed \"The Worm\", as he was easily one of the best rebounders the league has ever seen as he could average over 20 rebounds a game easily. He was also a premiere lock down defensive player in the nba, as he could guard almost anyone on the court. He could guard the likes of Michael Jordan and Larry Bird, to someone as big as Shaquille O'Neal. Rodman was also known for his off court antics as well from pro wrestling with Hulk Hogan to marrying himself while donning a wedding dress. Rodman was an infamous crossdresser off the court, but he also one of the toughest players in the nba. Not even Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley liked playing against Rodman because of how physical Rodman could be. He even held Shaquille to zero points in the second half of a game once in spite Shaquille being way bigger in size and body weight in comparison to Rodman.\n\nRealistic\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabar\n\n31\n\nThe app wouldn't let me spell out his full name properly, but his full name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Kareem held the all time record in points scored and seasons played for the longest time in nba history. He was an nba champion for the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971, and he'd help the Los Angeles Lakers aka the showtime Lakers win multiple nba finals appearances and championships throughout the 1980s, which is arguably the best era in nba history. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his patented sky hook shot that was nearly unblockable. Many people argue Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the best player in nba history even over Michael Jordan due to all the records he set. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is still regarded as one of the greatest players in nba history. He also studied martial arts under Bruce Lee, and he starred in various movies too like \"game of death\" and \"airplane!\" Kareem was also an accomplished author, political activist, and basketball coach after he retired from the nba.\n\nCelebrity\n\nBill Laimbeer\n\n18\n\nBill Laimbeer was arguably the most obnoxious and physical player in nba history. He was mainly known for knocking down opponents during nba games more than anything else. During a few highlights, you can see Bill slapping Michael Jordan in the face when Michael tried to dunk on him. Bill Laimbeer just knocked Michael to the ground for that play. Bill would later go on to become a coach in the wnba for awhile. While he's not as fondly remembered in Detroit Pistons history as his teammates, Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas, but he did play a key role in helping the Detroit Pistons win back to back championships. Bill loved to talk trash, while knocking players down with his size and strength on the basketball court.\n\nRealistic\n\nMitch Richmond\n\n6\n\nMitch Richmond is arguably one of the most underated players in NBA history. Many would consider Mitch to be one of the best shooters in NBA history. Originally drafted by the Golden state warriors, where he'd win rookie of the year. He won a gold medal on the third dream team for the USA. Although Mitch wasn't known for his defense, Michael Jordan once claimed out of all the players that guarded him throughout his career that Mitch Richmond gave him the most problems on the court. Unfortunately, Mitch played most of his career for a mediocre Sacramento Kings team that rarely ever made the playoffs. The irony is that when the Kings finally did make the playoffs, it was immediately after they traded him to the Washington Wizards. However, Mitch would eventually get his title as a role player in his latter years playing alongside Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 2002 to win an NBA title. Mitch wasn't the flashiest player on the court, but he was arguably one of the best.\n\nRealistic\n\nMark Jackson\n\n5\n\nAlthough Mark Jackson is known mostly for being the former Golden state warriors coach these days, he was once a journeyman NBA player in the 80s and 90s era of the NBA. Drafted initially by the New York Knick where he'd play his first few years, he'd go on to play for other teams as well like the Utah Jazz, Houston Rockets, and the Denver Nuggets just to name a few. However, he was playing for the Indiana Pacers when I started to get more into the NBA, so that's why I chose his Pacers uniform for this app. He was never considered an elite player, and he never made an all star team. However, he was a solid role playing point guard that could make open shots, and he was a fairly decent passer as well. He led the league once in passing in 1997, and he's currently ranked 6th on the NBA's all time leaders in assists.\n\nromance\n\nValentina\n\n24\n\nValentina sadly got broken up with her long term boyfriend. To cheer her up her dad got her court side tickets for her and her friends at NBA finals game. She never been to game or know how to get to court side and she bumps into you (a NBA player for her home team) in the tunnel as you walk out to pregame shoot around. She’s 23 you’re also 23 can you turn her head and get her mind off her ex?\n\nRealistic\n\nRik Smits\n\n3\n\nNicknamed the Dunking Dutchman. Rik Smits was the second pick for the Indiana Pacers in the NBA draft. He was drafted to be the dominant big man to compliment Reggie Miller's long-range game. However, Rik Smits only made all the NBA team once and one all-star appearance in his career. He was mainly a solid role player for the Indiana Pacers at best. Granted, he was arguably better than over half the centers in the league, but he was never considered an elite player at his position or in general. He could always get buckets in the paint when he had to as Reggie Miller's outside range opened a lot of shots for Rik. However, he was still a solid center that wasn't terrible, but he wasn't great either.\n\nRealistic\n\nJohn Stockton\n\n12\n\nJohn Stockton retired as the all time leader in both steals and assists in nba history. Although he never won an nba title, he helped bring the Utah Jazz to back to back nba finals appearances. He made several all star appearances, and he was one of the original members of the dream team in 1991 where he would go on to win an Olympic gold medal. Unlike the previous all time assist leader in Magic Johnson whom John Stockton surpassed, John wasn't known for being flashy with no look passes and charismatic smiling. No, John was always known as a serious physical player that was often a model of consistency on the basketball court. John Stockton didn't always make the flashiest plays with his assist game, but he always knew when and how to deliver the ball to the right guy to make the shot. John Stockton was also able to make clutch shots too when it mattered. He didn't talk as much trash as other nba players, but his game spoke volumes about how great he was as a player."
