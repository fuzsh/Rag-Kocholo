        "text": "CHAPEL HILL, NC (NEWS RELEASE) — As part of the celebration of the centennial of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association, the NCHSAA has released the fourth and final list of its “100 To Remember” series.\n\nThe list of “100 To Remember: Male Athletes” highlights one hundred of the top male athletes in NCHSAA history. A special committee, including school administrators and coaches from across the state as well as sports media, put together the list in a series of meetings.\n\nMany people made nominations for the lists on the NCHSAA web site. Association records and archives were also consulted, as well as members of the committee offering names for discussion.\n\n“Coming up with a list of ‘100 To Remember’ was a tremendous challenge,” said Davis Whitfield, commissioner of the NCHSAA. “So many individuals have participated, coached or been involved with the rich history and tradition of the first 100 years of the NCHSAA. This group of distinguished individuals not only served their schools, school systems and communities in an exceptional fashion, but our Association as well.”\n\nDuring the 2013 year in which the 100th anniversary is celebrated by the NCHSAA, four “100 To Remember” lists have been released. The first involved administrators, including athletic directors, principals, superintendents or others involved with the administration of athletics at a local or statewide level. The second list was coaches, followed by female athletes. The male athletes list was the final one released.\n\nThe development of the lists and the discussions certainly fit in with the slogan for the centennial: “Honoring the Past, Embracing the Present and Shaping the Future.”\n\nAll of the 100th anniversary lists are posted on the NCHSAA website under the special 100th portal.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION\n\nCENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n100 TO REMEMBER – MALE ATHLETES\n\nE.J.
