        "text": "Andrew Perna is under the weather today, so he's asked me to fill in for him on the Daily Rundown for March 26th's games.\n\n- DET 89, TOR 82\n\nThe Raptors scored just 33 first half points, but exploded for 28 in the third and fourth quarters to defeat the Pistons 89-82 to climb one game over .500 for the season. Ford and Calderon combined to outplay Billups (per 40 FIC of 21.0 and 20.4 respectively compared to 18.2 for Billups) while Rasho Nesterovic had nine rebounds, four blocks and 15 points.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nChauncey Billups, DET - 17.8\n\nT.J. Ford, TOR - 15.3\n\nChris Bosh, TOR - 15.0\n\nRodney Stuckey, DET - 10.5\n\n- MIA 96, NYK 103\n\nMiami was unable to get that coveted 14th win of the season during their final trip to Madison Square Garden of the year. Ricky Davis had a very good game, scoring 28 points on 7-10 shooting from 3-point territory. For the Knicks, Jamal Crawford scored 24 points and grabbed four steals while David Lee went for 15 points and 16 rebounds.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nJamal Crawford, NYK - 17.0\n\nDavid Lee, NYK - 16.5\n\nRicky Davis, MIA - 23.8\n\nKasib Powell, MIA - 9.0 (17.1 per 40)\n\n- CHI 99, PHI 121\n\nBehind an outstanding 18 assist night from Andre Miller, the Sixers inched even closer to the playoffs while the Bulls inch out of it. The Sixers shot 54% from the field while the Bulls continued their season-long shooting woes by going 34-86. Louis Williams scored 23 points in 23 minutes on 8-13 shooting.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nAndre Miller, PHI - 28.5\n\nLouis Williams, PHI - 21.5 (37.4 per 40)\n\nThabo Sefolosha, CHI - 19.8\n\nThaddeus Young, PHI - 14.8\n\n- MIL 96, ATL 115\n\nJoe Johnson scored 28 points while dishing out eight assist in Atlanta's comfortable win over the Bucks. Off the bench, Josh Childress chipped in 20 while Zaza Pachulia grabbed eight rebounds. Only Andrew Bogut fared considerably well for the Bucks, scoring 27 and grabbing nine (six offensive) rebounds.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nJoe Johnson, ATL - 19.6\n\nJosh Childress, ATL - 20.0\n\nAndrew Bogus, MIL - 23.5\n\nZaza Pachulia, ATL - 14.1\n\n- NOH 100, CLE 99\n\nIf Chris Paul and LeBron James are having an MVP war, then the point guard won this game and the battle. Paul scored 15 points and had a monstrous 20 assists; Paul was responsible (either by dishing or passing) for 71% of the Hornets' field goals Wednesday. LeBron had 21 points and eight rebounds, but Zydrunas Ilgasuskas' 29 and 15 is what kept Cleveland afloat.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nChris Paul, NOH - 24.5\n\nLeBron James, CLE - 18.0\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas, CLE - 25.4\n\nPeja Stojakovic, NOH - 16.1\n\n- PHX 97, BOS 117\n\nThe Celtics avenged their loss in Phoenix by outscoring the Suns 60-40 in the second half of their 117-97 victory. Kevin Garnett scored 30 points on 12-19 shooting but had just three rebounds. Rajon Rondo scored 14 points with six rebounds and six assists.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nKevin Garnett, BOS - 25.0\n\nPaul Pierce, BOS - 18.6\n\nAmare Stoudemire, PHX - 17.9\n\nRaja Bell, PHX - 1.8\n\n- IND 117, NJN 124\n\nDevin Harris had another great game in a Nets uniform, scoring 22 points and dishing 15 assists in the Nets' 124-117 victory over Indiana. Sidenote: On the irony scale, how significant would it be if Jason Kidd misses the playoffs with Dallas while the Nets slide in?\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nDevin Harris, NJN - 27.8\n\nJosh Boone, NJN - 16.3\n\nVince Carter, NJN - 18.6\n\nMike Dunleavy, IND - 28.8\n\n- MIN 86, HOU 97\n\nThe Rockets did enough to squeak past the Timberwolves, mainly by outrebounding them by a margin of 20. Luis Scola had 18 and 18 while Tracy McGrady was one assist shy of a triple double. Carl Landry, Luther Head and Bobby Jackson were all pivotal off the bench for Rick Adelman.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nLuis Scola, HOU - 20.8\n\nTracy McGrady, HOU - 19.5\n\nAl Jefferson, MIN - 19.5\n\nCarl Landry, HOU - 8.1 (20.3)\n\n- LAC 88, SAS 97\n\nThe Spurs are yet again on the doorstep of a 50 win season. Tim Duncan had 26 points and 12 rebounds, shooting 80% from the floor. As a team, San Antonio shot 50% from the floor, while holding the Clippers to just 39%.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nTim Duncan, SAS - 26.9\n\nMichael Finley, SAS - 11.3\n\nAl Thornton, LAC - 14.0\n\nJosh Powell, LAC - 9.3 (37.0 per 40)\n\n- MEM 106, SAC 107\n\nKevin Martin's 36 points was barely enough to knock off the Grizzlies at Arco Arena. Brad Miller had 15 points and 17 boards while Ron Artest scored 24.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nBrad Miller, SAC - 26.6\n\nKevin Martin, SAC - 21.8\n\nJavaris Crittenton, MEM - 12.3 (19.6 per 40)\n\nRon Artest, SAC -14.3\n\n- WSH 104, SEA 99\n\nKevin Durant continues his improved play, scoring 32 points on 13-22 shooting in the Sonics' narrow loss to Washington. Antawn Jamison had 17 points and 12 rebounds, while Roger Mason had 22 points in almost 22 minutes off the bench.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nAntawn Jamison, WSH - 20.4\n\nKevin Durant, SEA - 18.4\n\nNick Collison, SEA -18.3\n\nRoger Mason, WSH - 13.3 (25.2 per 40)\n\n- CHA 108, LAL 95\n\nPerhaps karmic influences were present following the Bob Delaney call in Monday's win at Golden State, but the Bobcats' impressive 2nd quarter put them ahead 57-44 at halftime and it was enough to stave off the Lakers. Jason Richardson scored 34 points on 13-28 shooting while Gerald Wallace went for 15 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.\n\nGame FIC Scores\n\nGerald Wallace, CHA - 20.8\n\nJason Richardson, CHA - 20.4\n\nLamar Odom, LAL - 19.3\n\nKobe Bryant, LAL - 9.8\n\n?
