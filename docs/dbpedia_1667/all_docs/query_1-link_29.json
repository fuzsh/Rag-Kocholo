        "text": "About Me\n\nName: David Friedman\n\nLocation: United States\n\n\"A work of art contains its verification in itself: artificial, strained concepts do not withstand the test of being turned into images; they fall to pieces, turn out to be sickly and pale, convince no one. Works which draw on truth and present it to us in live and concentrated form grip us, compellingly involve us, and no one ever, not even ages hence, will come forth to refute them.\"--Alexander Solzhenitsyn (Nobel Lecture)\n\n\"The most 'popular,' the most 'successful' writers among us (for a brief period, at least) are, 99 times out of a hundred, persons of mere effrontery--in a word, busy-bodies, toadies, quacks.\"--Edgar Allan Poe\n\n\"In chess what counts is what you know, not whom you know. It's the way life is supposed to be, democratic and just.\"--Grandmaster Larry Evans\n\n\"It's not nuclear physics. You always remember that. But if you write about sports long enough, you're constantly coming back to the point that something buoys people; something makes you feel better for having been there. Something of value is at work there...Something is hallowed here. I think that something is excellence.\"--Tom Callahan"
