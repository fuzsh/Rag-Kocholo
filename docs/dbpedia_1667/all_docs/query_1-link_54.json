        "text": "Explore the 10 best high school basketball teams of all time. The list includes teams as far back as 1952 and as recent as 2022. In addition, the list features several different regions of the United States. What are the teams judged off? Star power, strength of schedule, coaching, points differential and overall chemistry. Enjoy, drop us a comment and let us know who we missed.\n\n1) 1981-1982 Dunbar (Baltimore, MD) (29-0)\n\nPlayers: Muggsy Bouges (NBA), Reggie Lewis (NBA), Reggie Williams (NBA), David Wingate (NBA), Gary Graham (UNLV), Tim Dawson (Miami), Keith James (UNLV), Darryl Woods (Virginia Union), Jerry White\n\nNotable Wins: Camden (NJ), DeMatha (MD), John Caroll (MD), Flint Hill (VA), Cardinal Gibbons (MD)\n\nHead Coach: Bob Wade\n\nHere comes trouble, no question the Dunbar Poets are number one on the list. An unstoppable force going a combined 60-0 from 1982 to 1984. Arguably, the greatest collection of high school talent ever assembled on one roster. Subjects of the book Boys of Dunbar, the Poets had three future first round NBA draft picks in Reggie Williams, who was the national player of the year as a senior, point guard Muggsy Bogues and Reggie Lewis, who was actually a reserve player on the 1982 and 1983 team. The statistical calculations of 3 players drafted in the first round on the same high school team is 4,037,639 to 1. The media ranked Calvert Hall number 1 and Dunbar number 3 to begin the season. Camden of New Jersey was sandwiched in between at 2, Calvert Hall beat Camden in Philly by 5. Dunbar beat Camden at Camden by 29. But Calvert Hall and Dunbar were not scheduled to play that year and never did. Baltimore Sun ran an article called \"The Greatest Game Never Played”.\n\nDunbar played many of the top teams in the country and won by an average of 36.5 ppg. Included among those games, was a 29-point victory over New Jersey powerhouse Camden. Throughout the season no one really came within single digits of Dunbar. When Dunbar ventured up to Camden, the fans were laughing at 5-foot-3 point guard Muggsy Bogues, but the Poets led by 33 points at halftime and won 84-59 to end a 17-year Camden home winning streak. Wingate had 37 points against Camden, while Muggsy finished with 15. They won both the Lake Clifton Tourney and the Cap City Classic. Virginia’s Flint Hill had the pleasure and misfortune of encountering Dunbar on an “on” night. Flint Hill was rated in the Top 25 nationally. To accommodate the overflow crowd, the dream matchup was held at Morgan State College. 5 Flint Hill players later went on to D1 programs, it didn’t matter as Flint Hill got embarrassed in front of all those fans. They also beat famed powerhouse DeMatha of Maryland (67-55). Following the Dematha game they blew out John Caroll high school. While they finished the season ranked #2 behind Calvert Hall, most real experts agreed the Dunbar squad was the best team in 1982. The 1982-1983 season following David Wingate’s and Gary Graham’s graduation, saw Dunbar named national champions after another undefeated season (31-0).\n\nThe teams floor general 5-3 Muggsy Bouges was one of the most unique basketball players to ever take the court. His stifling full court defense and constant ball pressure gave opposing players nightmares. Bouges was a confident leader on the court, running the offense like a symphony. The 5-3 lead guard would go on to be the shortest player ever selected in the first round of the NBA draft.\n\nReggie Williams was the squads top prospect, the 6-7 forward was a future NBA lottery pick. Dunbar coach Bob Wade said, “Williams is like E.F. Hutton, when he speaks, the other guys listen.” Williams averaged 24.3 ppg and 12 rpg as a junior. He also shot over 90% from the free throw line. Famed scout Howie Garfinkel called Williams, “the kind of athletes candy bars are named after”. Reggie Williams had the perfect mixture of athleticism and touch. The future Georgetown Hoya was the primary scorer on the team and he was incredible while slashing to the hoop. Williams also had a lethal mid-range jump shot. During his senior season, USA Today voted Reggie the National High School Player of the Year.\n\nThe pair of senior stars at guard, Georgetown bound All-American David Wingate and UNLV commit Gary Graham supplied leadership to the Poet team. Wingate won a national championship in college and went on to a multi year NBA career. He was known for his pressure defense and his explosive offensive game. Graham was a shooting threat who also supplied pressure defense.\n\nJunior Reggie Lewis was the best kept secret on Dunbar, the future NBA All-Star lacked the hype of some of his teammates. But Lewis was an electric scorer off the bench for the Poets, providing several timely baskets. The teams bench may have been the greatest of all time. 6-6 junior Tim Dawson started a handful of games and helped the Poets inside with his great leaping ability. Future Clemson commit, Mike Brown also came off the bench as a 6-4 guard. 5-7 Virginia Union commit Darryl Woods also came off the bench. The future UNLV guard Keith James came off the bench with Lewis, Dawson, Brown and 5-7 Woods.\n\nCoach Wade was a strict disciplinarian, who ran practices like a boot camp. He knew that his team was going to need a whole new set of standards to live by, other than what they had been exposed to in life. Coach Wade had a special corporal punishment regimen he would impose on the players for infractions, ranging from cutting class, to missing the open wing man on the fast break. The \"ghetto dun-bells\" were bricks wrapped in tape and Poet practice jerseys for padding. Upon rule violation, players could be seen and heard doing jumping jacks and cross-country runs, with their bricks in hand. Wade felt the \"ghetto dun-bells\" gave his players stronger legs and wrists than their opponents. Above all, he believed in defense and pressure. He tried to instill in his players the same discipline he learned from Vince Lombardi as a defensive halfback for the Washington Redskins in 1969. Those selfless messages got repeated over and over at practice. Wingate insists Dunbar practices were harder than games. They were definitely longer. Practice started at 4 and went until the team got things right. “Sometimes we’d practice till 10:30, 11 at night,”\n\nA mind blowing collection of talent when you take into account all 12 players grew up within 7 miles of one another. A far cry from the prep teams and loaded private school teams of the present. There have been several documentaries made about this team, including Baltimore's Boys from ESPN. A public school team will never again match the pure talent of the 82 Poets.\n\n2) 1992-1993 Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, VA) (36-0)\n\nPlayers: Jerry Stackhouse (NBA), Jeff McGinnis (NBA), Mark Blount (NBA), Makhtar NDiaye (NBA), Alex Sanders (Louisville), Curtis Staples (Virginia), Jermaine Smith (UNLV), Mike Brittan (Memphis), Tavares Johnson (Xavier)\n\nNotable Wins: Rice (NY), Charlotte Christian (NC), Artesia (CA), Crenshaw (CA)\n\nHead Coach: Steve Smith\n\n36-0 on their way to USA Today National Champions, they blew out opponents by an average of 37.3. Oak Hill’s best and deepest team of all time. This might have been the team that started the upward trend toward loaded prep school basketball. The 1993 team held the distinction at playing during a time when loaded prep schools and academies were mostly a thing of the future.\n\nCoach Steve Smith said it best “Our 2004 team was really good but that, 93 team might be the best team we’ve ever had.” “They were all high division 1 players, I really didn't have a problem keeping them happy. “We had probably two players at every position,” Smith said. “The depth we had was more than on any other team we’ve had. We had four Division I players that didn’t start, but they all bought into their role.” Smith is one of the top high school coaches of all time, and has led his teams to more than 5 mythical national championships.\n\nThe most hyped team of the decade, they routinely received ink in multiple national newspapers every week. They were only tested twice all season. They obliterated multiple teams, including a 96-8 victory again John Battle High School.\n\nLed by the McDonald’s All-American tandem of Jeff McGinnis and Jerry Stackhouse. Stackhouse was one of the top 3 players in the nation, he recently transferred from Kinston, North Carolina. The swingman went on to a borderline hall-of-fame career in the NBA. As a senior in 1993 Stackhouse averaged 28 points and 12 rebounds. Many thought that Stackhouse was the best guard prospect since Michael Jordan. McGinnis paced the team with 8 assist per game, while chipping in 14 points per game. Both McGinnis and Stackhouse went on to play at North Carolina.\n\nOak Hill had one of the best front lines in the history of high school basketball. Highlighted by future NBA players Mark Blount and Makhtar NDiaye. Blount was an elite rim protector, routinely intimidating the opposing team. Their role players were top notch, including Alex Sanders, Curtis Staples, Jermaine Smith, Mike Brittan and Tavares Johnson. The bench filled with high divsion-1 players, was one of the greatest second units of all time.\n\nTheir interior muscle was overwhelming, as Sanders, N’diaye, and Johnson each tipped the scales at 240+ lbs. At the Holiday Prep Classic in Las Vegas, that beat up teams that included prep legend Felipe Lopez and his Rice HS squad from NYC, as well as many of the best teams from California. That team filled Oak Hill’s little 400-seat Turner Gymnasium with SRO crowds that ballooned closer to 900 many wearing Tar Heel blue whenever Oak Hill played marquee games.\n\n3) 1988-1989 St. Anthony (Jersey City, NJ) (32-0)\n\nPlayers: Bobby Hurley (NBA), Terry Dehere (NBA), Rodrick Rhodes (NBA), Jerry Walker (Seton Hall) Danny Hurley (Seton Hall), Sean Rooney (Duquesne), Felix Ortiz (Radford), Woodrow Williams (Buffalo), Lamont Street (Wagner)\n\nNotable Wins: Miami Senior (FL), Flint Hill (VA), Elizabeth (NJ), Artesia (CA), Archbishop Molloy (NY), Tolentine (NY), Cardinal Hayes (NY), Christian Brothers Academy (NJ)\n\nHead Coach: Bob Hurley\n\nThere are several unique traits of the 1989 St. Anthony squad. The school has no home gym, they have no scholarships to give out and the enrollment for students was just over 300. Led by Legendary coach Bob Hurley and three future NBA first round draft picks. The 89 team was Hall-of-Fame coach Hurley’s greatest collection of talent. Only 2 of the 32 wins, were not by double digit margins. The Friars' average winning margin of 28 points, and it's easy to see why they were voted national high school basketball champions by USA Today and Street & Smith's.\n\nThe 1989 squad featured Bobby Hurley (son of the coach), Terry Dehere and Rodrick Rhodes, each of whom was a first-round NBA draft pick. Hurley was New Jersey's premier guard, and one of the best in the country. Eventually he would excel in college at Duke, leading the Blue Devils to the Final Four 3 times.\n\nRodrick Rhodes was a bonafide guard nationally and one of the top athletes in his high school class. Rhodes was merely a freshman, but his talent was clear. By the time he was a senior, he was a top-five recruit in the country, and eventually slid into the starting lineup at the University of Kentucky as a true freshman.\n\nDehere was a key scorer and long range shooter for the Friars. He was good enough as a senior to earn a scholarship to Seton Hall. He finished his collegiate career with almost 2,500 points and a trip to the Final 4.\n\nJerry Walker, who played for Seton Hall, was an intimidating forward. At 6-7 and 240 pounds, Walker displayed the physical attributes and aggressiveness atypical of high school post players. He was one of the nation's best forwards, and helped the Pirates win two Big East titles.\n\nThe center position was manned by Sean Rooney and Felix Ortiz, who were both 6-7. Guards Woodrow Williams, Lamont Street and Darren Savino rounded out the team for the friars. Another important bench player was sophomore Danny Hurley (Bobby’s brother), the future college star helped contribute off the bench with his phenomenal offensive game.\n\nThat '89 season saw St. Anthony win three national tournaments and defeat teams from 10 different states. The Friars beat nationally-acclaimed Miami Senior and Flint Hill. They also knocked off state rivals Elizabeth and Christian Brothers. That year, the Friars won their own Skyline Classic tournament, defeating Artesia of California, a team that featured Ed O’Bannon and an Archbishop Molloy team featured a young Kenny Anderson. The Friars also defeated New York powers such as Tolentine and Cardinal Hayes. They also became the first New Jersey team to win the season-ending Tournament of Champions, which matches all the divisional winners in the state. They beat rival Elizabeth in multiple games during the year. The team finished with the legionary number 1 ranking in the nation.\n\nThe Miami Senior win (68-55) came on a late run with Bobby Hurley limited by an ankle injury. Against powerhouse Flint Hill Prep (64-45), St. Anthony's blew them out by 20. They sold out practically every gym they played in that season.\n\n\"I remember walking around my neighborhood with TV cameras following me around,\" recalled Walker. \"It was such a big story at the time because we didn't have a gym and we were the No. 1 team in the country. I remember being on Regis & Kathie Lee, just getting so much exposure. Dateline, People Magazine. It was crazy. We were like rock stars.” At the end of the season the St. Anthony's win streak reached 50.\n\n4) 2019-2020 Montverde Academy (Montverde, FL) (27-0)\n\nPlayers: Cade Cunningham (NBA), Scottie Barnes (NBA) Dariq Whitehead (NBA) Moses Moody (NBA), Caleb Houston (NBA), Day’Ron Sharpe (NBA), Ryan Nembhard (Gonzaga), Langston Love (Baylor), Zeb Jackson (VCU), Keegan Harvey (GW)\n\nNotable Wins: Won City of Palms in Florida, Won John wall Invitational Raleigh, HoopHall Classic, Ducanville (TX), Yates (TX), Tampa Catholic (FL), DeMatha Catholic (MD), McEachern (GA), IMG (FL), Patrick School (NJ), IMG (FL), Scotlandville (LA), Long Island Lutheran (NY)\n\nCoach: Kevin Boyle\n\nThe team was so impressive that I had to completely revise the entire list. They navigated a national schedule with ease, taking on formidable opponents and remaining undefeated. The roster boasted two top 5 seniors of 2020, Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes, both future top 5 picks in the NBA Draft. Not only did they showcase these two outstanding talents, but the team also had 6 future NBA players, with a total of 11 players heading to Division 1 schools. With that tough national schedule they had an average winning margin of 39 points per game. Out of all the great teams that Kevin Boyle has coached, the 2020 Monte Verde team was his best.\n\nAmong the future NBA draft picks were Dariq Whitehead (Duke), Caleb Houstan (Michigan), Day’Ron Sharpe (UNC), and Moses Moody (Arkansas), who each played a crucial role on the team. Impressively, Montverde had 8 players ranked in the top 65 of their high school class, including 5 five-star prospects. They showed great balance, with seven players averaging 8.3 points per game or more, led by Cunningham's 13.9.\n\nCunningham, arriving from Dallas before his sophomore year, initially considered a fringe five-star recruit, transformed into a point guard maestro at Montverde. His exceptional command of the game paved the way for a stellar career at Oklahoma State, ultimately leading to his selection as the first overall pick in the NBA draft. Scottie Barnes, a versatile 6’8 forward, stood out as a premier player. Joining Montverde after transferring from University School in Fort Lauderdale, Barnes proved to be an elite defensive force, capable of guarding multiple positions. His contributions were instrumental in the team's success, and he later excelled at Florida State, securing the NBA Rookie of The Year title in 2022.\n\nMoses Moody, often underrated, showcased his skills as a 6’6 shooting guard, combining sharpshooting with lock down defense. His seamless synergy with Cunningham made him a valuable asset. Moody's impactful presence on the court led to his selection as a first-round NBA Draft pick after a standout year at Arkansas. Adding to their formidable lineup, senior big man Day’Ron Sharpe, a recent transfer to Montverde, brought a commanding presence inside at 6’9 and 225 pounds. His contribution solidified the team's dominance.\n\nDespite facing tough competition in the City of Palms Classic title game against IMG Academy, resulting in their lone single-digit victory (63-55), Montverde managed to defeat them three other times during the season. In total, the Eagles triumphed over 12 FAB 50 ranked clubs (at the time of the match up). Unfortunately, the cancellation of the GIECO Nationals due to the COVID-19 Pandemic prevented them from potentially facing three more ranked opponents. Montverde Academy clinched its fifth FAB 50 title in the past eight seasons, solidifying its status as the best overall team in that time frame.\n\n5) 2005-2006 Lawrence North (Indianapolis, IN) (29-0)\n\nPlayers: Mike Conley (NBA), Greg Oden (NBA), Stephen Van Treese (Louisville), Damian Windham (Chicago St.),\n\nNotable Wins: Dunbar (OH), Proviso East (IL), Pike, Franklin Central, North Central, Glenbrook North (IL)\n\nCoach: Jack Keefer\n\nIn 2003, Greg Oden and Mike Conley became the first freshmen to start for head coach Jack Keefer and the two have been linked ever since. After back-to-back state titles, 2006 had all the makings of a dream season. They became the first Indiana team to win the mythical national championship since Crispus Attucks in 1955. The season prior the Wildcats finished with a 24-2 record, winning the last 16 games of the season. The Wildcats might have had the best inside/outside duo in high school history.\n\nThey made their way through a vaunted national schedule to reach a 31-0 mark. Lawrence North beat up on Dunbar (Ohio) featuring five-star guard Daequan Cook in a nationally televised game. The game was held at Butler University and was a blowout from the start. They played another game on ESPN2, as they took on future pro Eric Gordon and North Central. They embarrassed Franklin featuring future NBA big man Juwan Johnson. Another marquee out-of-state match-up against Jon Scheyer and Glenbrook North in Evanston, Ill. The Wildcats went on the road and beat the nationally-ranked Spartans in front of a capacity crowd. By the end of season their winning streak had reached 45 games.\n\n\"Oden was the best big man that Indiana's ever had, and Conley's the best point guard Indiana's ever had,” a local writer would comment. Regarded by many as the top high school basketball player in America, many thought Oden was the most dominant big since Shaquille O’Neal. The 7-foot center dominated the post for four seasons and was a runaway Indiana Mr. Basketball. He helped Ohio State reach the national championship game in his one season there. He was the pied piper in Indy and puts the sold out sign on the ticket office everywhere he goes. As a senior, Oden averaged 22.1 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game while shooting 74 percent from the floor.\n\nDon't forget about Mike Conley. The future NBA All-Star was a blur with the ball in his hands, he remained a consistent force for the Wildcats. As a senior, the point guard averaged 16.5 points and 4.2 assists. Conley and Oden would star together at Ohio State as Freshman, where they led the Buckeyes to the 2007 NCAA tournament title game.\n\n6-5 Damian Windham was a solid contributor from the wing for the Wildcats. Brandon McDonald was a defensive player who locked up opposing teams top offensive players. Future Louisville Cardinal Stephen Van Treese backed up Oden at center.\n\nThe Wildcats won three Class 4A championships in a row, going 72-4 along the way. A sellout crowd of 18,345 at Conseco Field house witnessed history as Lawrence North became only the third team to win three consecutive state titles. In the championship game they rolled over Muncie Central 80-56. Greg Oden had 26 points and Mike Conley went for 21.\n\nThe team was even the subject of a book Uncaged: The Rise of Greg Oden, Mike Conley, and the National Champion Lawrence North Wildcats by Dave Krider. In the illustrious history of Indiana basketball, no team has been better over a three-year stretch. The facts remain the Wildcats lost just four games in three years, beat opponents by nearly 20 points a game, won three straight state championships and were named national champions for the 2005-06 season. The book also highlights the duo's success in the summertime with the Spiece Indy Heat.\n\n6) 1989-1990 Southwestern (Detroit, MI) (30-1)\n\nPlayers: Jalen Rose (NBA), Vashon Lenard (NBA), Howard Eisley (NBA), Garland Mance (St. Bonaventure), Elton Carter (Penn State)\n\nNotable Wins: Saginaw (MI), Cooley (MI), Pershing (MI)\n\nHead Coach: Perry Watson\n\nAfter title game losses in 7 of the previous 8 seasons, Southwestern finally delivered coach Watson's first championship in the 1990 State Finals. Senior Howard Eisley and junior Voshon Lenard were sensational in their own right, but it was Jalen Rose who starred for the Prospectors. Aside from the big three, they had plenty of division one talent up an down the roster. 8 of the players on the roster went on to play d-1 basketball. Perry Watson’s 1991 squad, which featured seniors Jalen Rose and Voshon Lenard, may have gotten the recognition as the country’s top team. But it was the school’s 1990 squad, that featured Rose, Leonard, and senior Eisley, that laid the groundwork for the national acclaim. The team was as disciplined and hard working as any team ever. They would run around the school, even hallways on rainy days. Words were rarely exchanged if a loss did occur. And you can be assured they would practice that night. Three of the best players in the state of Michigan, and in the country. \"That 1990 team would rip your face off before they let you score a basket,\" said T.C. Cameron, an expert on Michigan high school sports. They also played in Detroit at a time in which the Detroit Public School League, was among the best in the nation.\n\nDuring his high school years, Jalen Rose led the Prospectors to state titles his junior and senior seasons. Over his 14-year NBA career, he totaled over 13,000 points. In his junior season, the versatile 6-7 Rose averaged 18 points, 6 assists and 8 rebounds. Rose played mostly point guard and forward for the Prospectors. An interesting side note to this team, Chris Webber was anticipated to enroll at Southwestern as a freshman in 1988 (instead enrolling at Detroit Country Day).\n\nJunior guard Voshon Lenard was a long-range shooting specialist who was part of back-to-back state title teams at Southwestern. At 6-5, Lenard had good enough size and athleticism to land a scholarship for Minnesota. He went on to star in the NBA, where he scored over 6,700 points.\n\nHoward Eisley was the senior leader of the Prospectors. The 6-2 guard was a lethal shooter and tough defender. As one of the top players in the state Eisley routinely drilled clutch shots for the Prospectors. He would go on to play in the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals with the Utah Jazz.\n\nSt Bonaventure commit Garland Mance was a role player for Southwestern. The 6-4 forward provided depth for the state champions. Mance went on to a successful college career at St. Bonaventure, averaging double digit points for his career. Elton Carter played on the inside for the Prospectors, before playing in the Big 10 at Penn State.\n\nTheir state championship game was both a celebration and triumph. After head coach Watson struggled to win the big one, Southwestern prevailed with a 67-54 victory over Saginaw. The program was controversial because rival coaches accused Watson of recruiting players, a charge the coach has always denied. In the broader view, it hardly mattered. City kids were succeeding. Few could argue that Watson wasn’t a positive influence. This team was so talented that legendary Yankee Derek Jeter claimed to have played this team in high school, after the game he simply decided basketball wasn't his sport.\n\n7) 2015-2016 Chino Hills (Chino, CA) (35-0)\n\nPlayers: Lonzo Ball (NBA), Onyeka Okongwu (NBA), LaMelo Ball (NBA), LeAngelo Ball (UCLA), Eli Scott (LMU), Andre Ball (Pepperdine) Cameron Shelton (NAU),\n\nNotable Wins: Bishop Montgomery, Mater Dei, Montverde Academy (FL), Patrick School (NJ), Foothills Christian, Jefferson (NY), High Point Academy (NC), Bishop Gorman (NV),\n\nCoach: Steve Baik\n\nLed by the trio of the Ball brothers, the team had plenty of other talent on the roster. This team faced a national schedule which showcased their abundance of talent and depth. The team played at a blistering speed offensively, running their full court break. Chino Hills was one of the most exciting high school basketball teams of the 2000s, averaging 98 points per contest and tying the state record with 18 100-point games in 2015-2016. There average margin of victory was 28.4 per game.\n\nMcDonalds All-American and future NBA lottery pick Lonzo Ball was the unquestioned leader of the team. The pass first 6-6 point guard was drawing comparisons to Jason Kidd as early as his sophomore season. His senior season was something to behold, averaging over 25 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds, 5 steals. He provided suffocating full-court defense for all four quarters. The team also includes his brothers LaMelo Ball (freshman) and LiAngelo Ball (junior) who is also committed to UCLA. Junior LiAngelo Ball averaged over 27 points as a junior. The little brother LaMelo had an outstanding freshman season averaging over 16 points and 4 assists.\n\nChino was led inside by intimidating 6-8 freshman Onyeka Okongwu. The rising recruit led the team with 5 blocks per game. Okongwu's shot-blocking skills were game changing in the final month of the season. He went on to averaged 8 points, 7 rebound and 5 blocks as a freshman. A 5-star recruit of the 2019 class, Okongwu recently committed to play basketball for USC.\n\n6-5 swingman Eli Scott contributed to the Huskies success. Scott helped with a bevy of showtime dunks and inside rebounding. He averaged over 15 points and 8 rebounds as a senior. The LMU signee would go on to average more than 12 points per game during his freshman season in college, a true sign of this teams depth. Sophomore and future Pepperdine commit Andre Ball was barely good enough to touch the floor for Chino only averaging 4 points per game.\n\nThe Huskies captured a City of Palms Classic title while notching a signature win over Montverde Academy. The Huskies also beat Jefferson and The Patrick School to win the City of Palms Holiday Tournament. 3 days later the team traveled to another national tournament in the Maxpreps Holiday Classics. There they took down Seattle Prep, Milwaukee King and Redondo Union. They defeated seven preseason ranked FAB 50 teams after New Year’s, including No. 36 Bishop Montgomery 71-67 in one of California’s most anticipated regular-season games in recent memory. They beat Foothills Christian twice featuring 5-star recruit Tj Leaf. In February, they matched up with Nevada's top squad Bishop Gorman who featured 3 of the top bigs in the country. They were no match for Chino’s run and gun style, as the Huskies won 98-81. The California Open division playoff was especially tough in 2016, as Chino faced three top 50 opponents on their way to the state crown. No team from California ever played tougher national competition. In the CIF Southern Section Open Division semifinals they demolished a good Mater Dei team 102-54. Before beating down Sierra Canyon 105-83 and Foothills Christian 82-62. They once again beat Bishop Montgomery in the Southern California final. The state championship game saw them cruise over De La Salle 70-50.\n\nThe state championship victory clinched a 35-0 season and assured a mythical national championship. It cemented the school's first state title and erased a bitter defeat in last year's Division I double-overtime championship loss. Considering the Huskies defeated 11 top 50 teams in the country this year, fans wondered if they are the best team in state history. Lonzo Ball had an answer ”We believed before the start of season we had the chance to be the best ever,\" he said. \"Tonight sealed it in our minds.” Said Chino Hills coach Steve Baik, whose team scored at least 100 points 18 times, which tied a state record: \"We have to be in the conversation. Our body of work is pretty impressive. Historians will need to take a hard look.\"\n\n8) 2013-2014 Montverde Academy (Montverde, FL) (27-1)\n\nPlayers: DeAngelo Russell (NBA), Ben Simmons (NBA), Justin Bibbs (Virginia Tech), Jayln Patterson (LSU), Jordan Caroline (Nevada), Chris Egi (Harvard), Ifeanyi Umezurike (St. Francis). Ahmaad Rorie (Oregon), Christ Koumadje (Florida St.), Makinde London (Chattanoga), Ifeanyi Umezurike (Saint Francis)\n\nNotable Wins: Norcross (GA), Providence School (FL), Lincoln (NY), Paul VI (VA), Christ the King (NY), Roselle Catholic (NJ), Huntington Prep (WV), Oak Hill (VA)\n\nHead Coach: Kevin Boyle\n\nBeginning in the early 90’s several powerhouse prep schools started to gain stream, schools with the ability to recruit talent nationally. This may have been one of the best prep school rosters ever assembled, led by the unstoppable combination of future NBA lottery picks DeAngelo Russell and Ben Simmons. Along with 2 top-3 NBA picks, came a roster loaded with 8 division-one prospects. Legendary coach Kevin Boyle continued his dominance, posting a 27-1 record. All while facing a daunting national schedule.\n\nBen Simmons helped guide Florida's Montverde Academy to three consecutive National High School Invitational championships. Simmons and Russell became roommates and together led the school to national championships in 2013 and 2014. Russell recalls a young Simmons. \"Ben's always been as good as he is,\" Russell said. \"Off the court, you could never guess how old he was. On the court, his game was very mature back then.” The 6-foot-10 Simmons came into the NBA touted as a point-forward. His versatility and passing skills were apparent as a teenager. As a junior in 2014, Ben Simmons posted 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists. The future number 1 overall pick was the star of the 2014 NHSI championship game, scoring 24 points, grabbing 12 rebounds and dishing out five assists in his team's 71-62 victory over Oak Hill Academy.\n\nDeAngelo Russell attended Central High School in Louisville before transferring to Montverde Academy for his sophomore season. In 2014, he helped Montverde win back-to-back High School National Tournament championships. He later played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic. Russell averaged 19.3 points, 4.7 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game as a senior. The guard became the first player in the school’s history to have his jersey and number retired.\n\nFuture NCAA tournament star Jordan Caroline mostly played inside for the Eagles. The son of NFL star Simeon Rice had a big senior season averaging 14 points and 7 rebounds. The future Nevada star was one of the more slept on recruits in the 2013 class. He went to Nevada where he would score over 1,700 points and 600 rebounds before entering his senior season.\n\nSenior Justin Bibbs started at guard for the Eagles before going on to play for the University of Virginia Tech. He currently plays in the NBA’s developmental league. Jayln Patterson went on to play at LSU after his prep career. Chris Egi a 6-7 forward went on to play at Harvard. Both Egi and Patterson were key contributors off the bench for the Eagles.\n\nWhen it comes to strength of schedule, this team ranks first of all time. The Eagles’ championship at Dick’s Nationals capped off a season in which it beat 16 teams that were at some point ranked or included in the final FAB 50. They routed Oak Ridge in a nationally televised ESPN game 93-57. At the Bass Pro tournament they beat Village Christian, Christ the King and White Station. The won the vaunted City of the Palms tournament by defeating Milton, Lincoln, Providence School and Paul VI. Additional signature wins came over Huntington Prep, Roselle Catholic, Wheeler, Norcross and Sagemont. They faced off with Karl Anthony Towns and his St. Jospeh team from New Jersey, before prevailing 79-70.\n\nIn a controversial game they took on Curie Metro Chicago featuring five star Cliff Alexander. If it weren't for a loss to Curie at the Spalding Hoophall Classic that was later ruled a forfeit, this team would be higher on this list. In the opening rounds of the National High School Tournament they beat national power Huntington Prep. The Eagles defeated No. 3 Oak Hill Academy 71-62 in the finals of the National High School Tournament to capture their second consecutive mythical national title.\n\n9) 1996-1997 Mt. Zion Christian Academy (Durham, NC) (27-1)\n\nPlayers: Tracy McGrady (NBA), George Mazyck (Missouri), Travis Spivey (Kansas), Corey Hightower (TCU), Max Owens (North Carolina), Brian Williams (American)\n\nNotable Wins: Carter (TX), Harvard-Westlake (CA), Atlantic Shores Christian (VA)\n\nCoach: Joel Hopkins\n\nAt the time, recruiting gurus unanimously agreed that this could be the best prep team ever assembled. With 10 players on Mount Zion's having played at the division one level. Mount Zion not only held its own in preseason scrimmages with the crosstown Duke University varsity, ranked No. 10 in the Associated Press college poll, but also earned early national prep rankings ranging from No. 1 to No. 3 in the country. Their crown jewel was none other than the number 1 recruit in America, Tracy McGrady.\n\nTracy McGrady was a relative unknown out of Auburndale, Florida before he received an invite to the prestigious Adidas ABCD camp. He came out of the camp as the number 1 player in America. The recruiting newsletter Hoop Scoop praised Tracy as \"the sleeper of the decade.\" Talent guru Bob Gibbons, who hadn't placed Tracy among his top 500 prospects before the summer, installed him at No. 2 behind forward Lamar Odom of Redemption Christian Academy. Nearing the end of the summer McGrady had his pick of top prep schools across the country. He chose to head to the basketball crazed state of North Carolina and play for Mt. Zion. \"If I didn't come to Mount Zion, I might still be getting into trouble somewhere back in Florida,\" McGrady commented after his time at Mount Zion. During his year in North Carolina he averaged 27.5 points, 8.7 rebounds and 7.7 assists and was named national high school player of the year by USA Today. He got drafted 9th overall in the 1998 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors. Legendary recruiting analyst, Tom Konchalski, said, “McGrady came out of nowhere. There hasn’t been anyone like that since Michael Jordan in ‘80, when he came to Five Star and bowled people over.” (Jordan, a late bloomer, was once cut from his high school team.)\n\nThe team's talent extended beyond McGrady, with senior small forward Brian Williams weighing scholarship offers from UCLA and Maryland, despite not cracking the starting lineup. Max Owens, a 6-foot-5-inch senior wing guard, played at North Carolina after graduation. George Mazyck, a 6-9, 280-pound senior center, played at Missouri, choosing them over Cincinnati, Georgia Tech, and others. Travis Spivey, a 6-2 senior point guard, shifted his commitment from football as a defensive back for Miami, to replace Jacque Vaughn as the back court leader at Kansas. Corey Hightower, a 6-6 senior forward, showcased his future potential to round out the starting five.\n\nOne of their dominating performances included a 103-69 victory over Carter High School of Dallas, with McGrady recording impressive numbers: 34 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 blocks. In the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic in Las Vegas, Tracy McGrady won tournament MVP honors by scoring 24 points in Mount Zion's 63-55 victory over Harvard-Westlake of North Hollywood, California.\n\n10) 1978-1979 Southwest (Macon,GA) (28-0)\n\nPlayers: Jeff Malone (NBA), Terry Fair (Georgia), Michael Hunt, Bobby Jones (Western Kentucky), Hook McCarthy, Eric Hightower (GA Southern),\n\nNotable Wins: Oak Hill Academy, Northeast Macon, Bristol (TN), Vanguard (FL), St Johns (DC), Baylor Prep (TN)\n\nCoach: Duck Richardson\n\nSouthwest Macon may have been the best kept secret in the history of high school basketball. The engine of the team was head coach Duck Richardson, once described by one of his players as “The Black Hitler”. The Southwest team single handily changed the perception of basketball in the south. They ran the table to win their second straight state title. Every key player from the 1978 state title team was returning in 1979. Southwest set out to be the first team from the south to win a national championship in basketball. Led by 3 of the best players the state has ever produced, Southwest packed arenas across the East Coast and South. They were not overly big, but the Pats were abundantly skilled and stocked with talent.\n\nFuture NBA All-Star Jeff Malone was a bonafied scorer that averaged over 20 points per game for over 13 seasons in the NBA. The 6-foot-4 Malone taunted opponents with his silky-smooth jump shot, shooting out to 25 feet. Malone went on to break the all-time scoring record at Mississippi State University, was a lottery pick in the 1983 NBA Draft, and a two-time All-Star. In 13 NBA seasons, he averaged over 19 points per game, shot 51 percent from the field, 81 percent from the free-throw line, and was a certified lock-down defender. Malone had been groomed since his freshman season to be the teams scorer, he did not disappoint leading the team in scoring during the 1979 season.\n\nA 6-8 physical specimen and McDonald’s All-American selection, Terry Fair could run like a deer. On offense he could finish above the rim and alter shots on defense. Fair went on to play at the University of Georgia, where he set several scoring and rebounding records. He led the Bulldogs to the 1983 Final Four. Malone and Fair would become high school All-Americans in ’79.\n\nWhile Fair and Malone were spectacular, but it was Michael Hunt who was the team’s unquestioned leader. The 6-4 lead guard was an extension of coach duck on the floor. A gritty swingman, Hunt was the coach on the floor and an extension of Duck, and he took extreme pride in his role. Bobby Jones was the 5’10 junior point guard who contributed a nice blend of scoring and distributing. Jones played college ball at Western Kentucky and set the all-time assists and steals record for a number of years until they were broken. Henry “Hook” McCarthy was a 6’3 junior power forward that was an X-factor on the team. Other complementary players included 6’2 guard Clint Whitehead, 6’4 big man Alonzo “Mickey” Patrick, Carl “Ironhead” Tyler, Glenn Harden and Eric Hightower, a top-tier athlete with noticeable jumping ability that helped him land a basketball scholarship at Georgia Southern University.\n\nDon “Duck” Richardson was the harshest disciplinarian in all of high school basketball, often compared to Indiana general Bobby Knight. Duck had no place for egos on his team, and he had neither the time nor the tolerance for self-pity. The stories about Duck seem fictional but the coach went on to win 8 titles in his time at Southwest. Duck was doing things way before other coaches and trainers. He would routinely run full-court passing drills while players wore weighted vest and threw 50-pound weighted balls to each other at full speed to rebounding/box-out drills to three-man weaves to defensive slides. Terry Fair commented “We trained like no other team ever trained. His work ethic…I’ve never seen anything like it. For me, I call him the Black Hitler. Fatigue was not an option. Ask any guy from that era and there say the games were much easier than the practices.” Fair shared a story so cruel and so unusual we had to share it “This man made me get out of the shower and do line drills butt-naked,” says an animated Fair. “Hell yeah, that man crazy.”\n\nAt a time when teams didn’t play a national schedule, the Patriots looked to challenge themselves facing several out of state opponents. They slaughtered vaunted Oak Hill Academy by 51 and whipped St. John's, Bristol, Vanguard and Baylor Prep in a burly out-of-state schedule. They won back to back state tournament games 82-45 and 104-57. They beat their rival Northeast Macon, 4 times during the year. The Southwest-Northeast rivalry hit its apex in 1979 as both were legitimate state championship-caliber teams.\n\nThey were one of the first high schools to be sponsored by Nike. Coach Richardson was one of the first coaches to work the famous Nike All-American camp that took place in Georgia. Sonny Vaccaro got in contact with Coach Richardson and offered to pay for their warmup clothing and shoes.\n\nThere's no questioning Southwest’s greatness, the teams average margin of victory was 29 in the regular season and 27.5 during the state playoffs. The team averaged over 88 points per game in an era without a 3-point line, their defense was stifling. The Patriots were loaded with 13 players who are said to have gone on to play college ball of some sort. When it was all said and done multiple players had success at the next level. They finished with the No. 1 overall ranking in the country capturing the first High School National Championship for a southern school.\n\n11) 2003-2004 Oak Hill Academy (38-0) (Mouth of Wilson, VA)\n\nPlayers: Rajon Rondo (NBA), Josh Smith (NBA), Dayshawn Wright (Syracuse), KC Rivers (Clemson) Brian Johnson (Miss St.), Bamba Fall (SMU), Aaron Scott (UC Riverside)\n\nNotable Wins: 5 Tournament Titles, Iolani Prep Classic in Hawaii, The Glaxo Smith Kline Invitational, Lainer (MS), Moeller (OH)\n\nCoach: Steve Smith\n\nRajon Rondo and Josh Smith led a loaded Oak Hill team that took home the vaunted national title. Veteran coach Steve Smith made sure his players stayed in stride. The McDonalds All-Americans were perhaps the most exciting tandem in the history of High School basketball.\n\nRajon Rondo averaged 21 points, 3 rebounds and 12 assists per game. He set the school record for assists at Oak Hill's with 303 assists, no short feat when considering Rod Strickland, Jeff McGinnis, Brand Jennings, and others have played point guard for Oak Hill. Rondo was an absolute dynamo setting the single game record with a career high 31 assists. The Kentucky signee was the top defensive guard in the entire country, showing flashes of his future in the NBA.\n\nJosh Smith created much of the buzz for this Oak Hill Academy team with his highlight-producing athleticism. For the year he averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists, 6 blocks, and 3 steals. The top 5 senior in America, took advantage of a big senior year by jumping straight to the pros and was drafted 17th overall by Atlanta.\n\nThe Warriors flashed plenty of talent outside of Rondo and Smith. Syracuse commit Dashawn Wright and 7 footer Bamba Fall patrolled the paint for Oak Hill. Shooting guard KC Rivers helped to stretch defenses with his deep 3 point range.\n\nThe closest winning margins were by five points over Dougherty and 10 points versus Moeller (Ohio) and the Warriors claimed titles at Iolani Prep Classic in Honolulu, the GlaxoSmithKline Invitational in Raleigh, N.C., the Mountain State Coal Classic in Beckley, W.Va., and won marquee games at the NIKE Extravaganza in Los Angeles and the Prime Time Shootout in Trenton, N.J.\n\nCoach Steve Smith said his 2003-04 team with Rondo and Josh Smith was among his very best. While the legendary 1993 Oak Hill team had more depth than this club, the starting five on this club matches up with any previous team, according to head coach Steve Smith. The late Tom Konchalski, the legendary New York scout who passed in 2021, ranked this Oak Hill’s teams among the greatest high school teams he ever witnessed.\n\n12) 1954-1955 Cripus Attucks (Indianapolis, IN) (30-1)\n\nPlayers: Oscar Robertson (NBA), Albert Maxey (Nebraska), Willie Merriweather (Purdue)\n\nNotable Wins: Rosesevelt Gary (IN), Northeast Macon (GA), Bristol (TN), Milan-Hickory (IN), Lafayette Jefferson (IN)\n\nCoach: Ray Crowe\n\nThere were a ton of great achievements by this Oscar Robertson led Indiana state champ. \"There's a lot of insensitivity still out there,\" Robertson said. \"Because it's a black school, people just don't care. Nobody cares about black issues. And I simply won't stand for that. Not with what we accomplished.\" Oscar was probably the greatest high school and collegiate player to ever live. He led Attucks to 3 State titles in Indian’s vaunted state tournament. Aside from Robertson they had plenty of star power to match up with anyone. In 1954, Attucks lost in the state quarterfinals to eventual state champions Milan, whose story would later be the basis of the classic 1986 movie Hoosiers. In 1955, Attucks finished with a 30-1 record and the first ever state title for an all black starting five. In the 1955-1956 season they won a second straight Indiana state title, becoming the first team in Indiana to secure a perfect season and compiling a state-record 45 straight victories. The Tigers average margin of victory was 28 points in the regular season and 23 points during the tournament. The team played with pace and pressure defense never before seen in America. They were a new type of basketball team, and a very dominant one at that.\n\nAt the time, Oscar Robertson was the greatest prep player in the history of basketball. The future NBA hall-of-famer went on to play for the University of Cincinnati where he was twice named the NCAA Player of the Year. Robertson dominated his high school career winning Indiana’s Mr. Basketball as a senior. Following the season he was named MVP of Indiana-Kentucky all-star game. Robertson was an Olympic team co-captain and was an innovator in the NBA by averaging a triple-double over a season. As a junior for Attucks, he averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds. Robertson ended his high school career by scoring 39 points before 15,000 fans at Butler Fieldhouse.\n\nBesides Robertson, the Tigers featured forward Willie Merriweather. As a senior in 1955, he averaged over 18 points per game. He would go on to star at Purdue and play semipro basketball. He was good enough to be elected into the Indiana State Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nGuard Albert Maxey played basketball at Nebraska after his high school career. He was also elected to the Indiana State basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nAttucks played a in a time where Indiana’s state playoff had no size discrimination, meaning it was a one division open tournament. In the playoffs Attucks defeated New Albany 79–67 in the state semifinals. In the Championship game at Historic Hinkle Fieldhouse, Attucks rolled over Gary Rosesevelt 97-74. Robertson led the way with 30 points as Merriwather contributed 21 points. After their championship game wins, the team was paraded through town in a regular tradition, but they were then taken to a park outside downtown to continue their celebration, unlike other teams. Robertson stated, \"[Officials] thought the blacks were going to tear the town up, and they thought the whites wouldn't like it. The Tigers were social pioneers, being the first African-American team to win a state basketball championship during a period in which they had difficulty finding opponents and accommodations. Immediately after winning the championship game, the team, cheerleaders and fans were denied the tradition of riding a firetruck and celebrating by riding around Monument Circle. The omission of the traditional celebration left the team’s players, including Basketball Hall of Fame member, Oscar Robertson, to conclude that they simply “weren’t wanted.” Their success changed things and went well beyond the realm of high school sports.” There is even a distinct piece of Attucks history at the Black History Museum. Spread between tributes to Martin Luther King Jr. and the Tuskegee Airmen is a letterman's jacket from the 1956 undefeated state champs and a medallion from the 1955 trailblazers. There are pictures and trophies, paintings and plaques commemorating everything the Crispus Attucks basketball teams of the 1950s were able to accomplish.\n\n13) 1972-1973 DeMatha Catholic (Hytesville, MD) (30-1)\n\nPlayers: Adrian Dantley (NBA), Kenny Carr (NBA), Billy Langloh (Virginia), Ron Satterthwaite (William & Mary), Eric Coard (Nebraska), Buzzy O’Connell (Stetson), Vern Allen (Niagara),\n\nNotable Wins: St Johns (DC), Gonzaga (DC), Calvert Hall (DC), Archbishop O’Connell (MD), Carroll (MD)\n\nCoach: Morgan Wootten\n\nDeMatha is a basketball institution led by gatekeeper Morgan Wooten. They play in one of the top conferences in America. Their dominance as a program has reached more than 50 seasons. The 1973 team was the best DeMatha ever had. This team had an unbelievable amount of size and discipline. They were headlined by the tandem of 6-6 Adrian Dantley and the 6-7 Kenny Carr, both future NBA lottery picks.\n\nFormer UCLA basketball coach John Wooden described Morgan Wootten when he said, \"I know of no finer coach at any level – high school, college or pro. I stand in awe of him.” On October 13, 2000, Coach Morgan Wootten was inducted into the Hall of Fame, one of three high school basketball coaches ever so honored. His overall record at the time was 1,210 wins and 183 losses. During his coaching career at DeMatha, he received job offers from North Carolina State, Georgetown, Duke, Wake Forest, and Virginia. Wootten turned down the offers, according to Sports Illustrated, because the Maryland job, was the only college job he wanted. The 1973 DeMatha team was coach Morgan Wooten’s most talented team.\n\nFacing one of the top leagues in America, Dematha faced several out of state schools as well. They won the Alhambra Catholic Invitation Tournament, beating Mater Christi, Power Memorial and Leo High School.\n\nAdrian Dantley was the greatest player in DeMatha history and one of the best ever produced in the Washington area. The athletic forward was a smooth outside shooter, a force on the inside with an explosive first step, and a master of psychology. “Nobody had a work ethic like Adrian Dantley,” Morgan Wootten said. He practiced obsessively, even on Christmas Day, when he would pick up the gym key from Coach Wooten's house. As a freshman in 1969, Wooten received a knock on the door. He was shocked when their stood the 6-4 Dantley, on not just any morning but Christmas morning. As a senior leader in 1973 Dantley averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds per game. During his career, he led DeMatha to a combined 57-2 record, earning high school All-America honors.\n\nThe 6-7 Kenny Carr was an unbelievable power forward for Dematha. As a junior in 1973 Carr dominated the paint, before heading off to NC State. Eventually he was drafted by the Lakers 6th overall in the 1977 NBA draft. Giving the 1973 team, 2 NBA lottery picks.\n\nBilly Langloh was a speedy 6-3 guard that went on to play in the ACC for the University of Virginia. He had a good career at Virginia averaging 11 points per game. As a senior in 1973 Langloh was one of the primary guards for Dematha. Buzzy O’Connell was the primary ball handler for the Stags. O’Connell ran Wootten’s offensive system just to coaches liking.\n\nThe team featured guard Ron Satterwaite who played at William & Mary. Eric Coard seldom played until his senior season, he played good enough to earn a scholarship to the University of Nebraska. Vern Allen started at center for the Stags, his role was mostly to rebound and play defense. He was good enough to play at the University of Niagara.\n\nThe Stags only had one loss on the year and it came to Baltimore powerhouse Dunbar. ”I will never forget that game,\" Wootten said several years ago. \"We had played St. John's the night before, and we came up to Baltimore the next day and just got outplayed. The place was packed, and Sugar's guys came to play. Skip Wise was unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.” Wise scored 39 points (22 in one of the most dominating fourth quarters ever) on an array of long jump shots and slashing drives that left the crowd in an absolute frenzy.\n\nAlthough they didn’t finish the season with the vaunted number one ranking, few doubt they were the best team in the nation. The team was absolutely dripping with talent, under the leadership of Morgan Wooten it was hard to deny their greatness. They played in one of the toughest leagues in America and only lost a game to a standout individual performance.\n\n14) 1968-1969 Washington High School, (Indianapolis, IN) (31-0)\n\nPlayers: George McGinnis (NBA), Steve Downing (NBA), Wayne Pack (ABA)\n\nNotable Wins: Marion (IN), Vincennes (IN), Tolleston (IN)\n\nCoach: Bill Green\n\nMany consider this to be the best team in the history of Indiana. A pair of 6-9 All-Americans in George McGinnis and Steve Downing. \"Sheer talent,\" McGinnis said. \"That's what I remember the most. We played with such force.” McGinnis went on to a storied career in the NBA and ABA. Both Downing and Pack played professional basketball.\n\nThey were indeed supremely talented. At 6-8, McGinnis had the body of Adonis and could run the floor like a gazelle. His senior running mate, 6-9 Steve Downing, would have been an Indiana Mr. Basketball front-runner almost any other year. Before playing in the ABA, point guard Wayne Pack played collegiately for Tennessee Tech between 1970 and 1973. He scored over 1,200 points for the Golden Eagles, adding over 400 assists. Jim Arnold, a 6-3 offensive whiz, would have been a No. 1 option for most teams. Louis Day was a standout defender, and Kenny Carter and Kenny Parks added depth up front.\n\nMr. Basketball of Indiana, George McGinnis scored 148 points in his last four games of the state tournament for a 37-point average. In an All-Star game against Kentucky, he had 53 points and 30 rebounds. McGinnis was as dominant as any player in Indiana high school basketball history.\n\nIt took 12 more years for another team to make it through the end of the season without a loss. The Continentals had to get through a final four that included Marion, Vincennes and Gary Tolleston. The four teams came in with an aggregate record of 110-1. Washington trailed Marion by 10 points going into the fourth quarter before rallying for a 61-60 win on a jumper by Downing. McGinnis scored 35 points in the final game as the Continentals held off Gary Tolleston, 79-76.\n\n15) 2001-2002 Westchester High School (Los Angeles, CA) (32-2)\n\nPlayers: Trevor Ariza (NBA), Hassan Adams (NBA), Bobby Brown (NBA), Brandon Heath (SDSU), Ashanti Cook (Georgetown), Brandon Bowman (Georgetown), Marcus Johnson (UConn), Scott Cutley (Kent State), Keith Everage (San Jose State), John Clemmons (Cal State Fullerton)\n\nNotable Wins: Mater Dei (CA), Farifax (CA), Oakland Tech (CA), Miami Christian (FL), All Hallows (NC), St. Raymond (NY), Long Beach Polly (CA)\n\nCoach: Ed Azzam\n\nThey were named the USA Today No. 1 team in the nation to start the season. The Comets featured seven high Division I college players, including four seniors who signed letters-of-intent in guard Hassan Adams (Arizona), forward Brandon Bowman (Georgetown), guard Ashanti Cook (Georgetown), guard Bobby Brown (Cal State Fullerton) and guard Brandon Heath (San Diego State). In addition, forward Trevor Ariza (UCLA) was regarded as one of the top juniors in the nation. Coach Ed Azzam was named the Cal-Hi Sports State Coach of the year in 2002.\n\nSenior Hassan Adams was a McDonalds All-American after averaging 18 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists. The 6-4 swingman was a defensive dynamo and was named California Mr. Basketball in 2002. Trevor Ariza was just beginning to scratch the surface of his potential. Still the junior averaged 12 points and 12 rebounds. Ariza would be named California's Mr. Basketball the next season in 2003, marking the first time since 1971 and '72 that different players from the same school took home the honor in back-to-back seasons. The Commets had several scorers including Brandon Heath and Bobby Brown. Each was a bonafide scorer at the division one college level. The San Diego State recruit Heath averaged 14.8 points and 3.7 rebounds for Westchester, the sharpshooter extended defenses with his 3-point shooting. Ashanti Cook and Brandon Bowman both went on to attend Georgetown. Only a freshman, future UCONN committ Marcus Johnson played sparingly off the bench.\n\nThis team had a special connection to the young Los Angeles Clippers, including Darius Miles & Quentin Richardson. Miles explains “We were so young that we couldn’t really go to the clubs, so we used drive around L.A. going to high school basketball games. We always used to go to Westchester High games because they had the prettiest girls. Westchester had a really good team, so we used to go watch Trevor Ariza and Hassan Adams and Bobby Brown and those boys. I don’t know how it got started, but they’d throw up their fists after they made a three. So we’d be hanging with them, and they’d be like, “Come on, when you gonna shout us out? You gotta do it. Show us some love.” Eventually that celebration turned into the young Clippers signature head tap celebration.\n\nFor Westchester players, Nike made a substantial investment in the team, shelling out more than $50,000. From headbands to high-tops, each Comet player received more than $2,000 in gear--including five pair of the newest top-of-the-line shoes. The team had its expenses to a prestigious holiday tournament in Houston paid for by a Nike affiliate. Westchester also played in three other out-of-state events last season, trips worth about $20,000 that were paid for almost entirely by organizers seeking a prominent headliner for their tournaments. Their partnership with Nike and their reputation to land star transfers led to them being suspended for the playoffs during the 2004 season.\n\nWestchester captured the prestigious City of Palms Tournament in Fort Myers, Florida, with Trevor Ariza being named tournament MVP. They defeated Miami Christian by the score of 88-55, which marked their second straight title. They won both the City Section Title and The CIF Division 1 State Final in 2002. They beat Oakland Tech led by future pro Leon Powe, North Carolina committ Quentin Thomas and Miami committ Armando Surratt. In the end, a 9-0 run to start the game by Westchester of Los Angeles proved decisive in its wildly-entertaining 80-75 victory over Oakland Tech. Adams led the way with a game-high 24 points and seven rebounds, Heath added 20 and Georgetown-bound Brandon Bowman had 18. The following season they still managed to go 33-3, capturing the State Championship in 2003 and again in 2005. In 2003 they beach Oakland Tech again by the score of 73-63, with Trevor Ariza leading the way with 30. They ended the season at 32-2 with many considering them the best Los Angeles team ever. The 2005 team would featured highly ranked national recruits like Amir Johnson and Gabe Pruitt.\n\n16) 2000-2001 Willowridge Sugar Land (Houston, TX) (39-0)\n\nPlayers: TJ Ford (NBA), Daniel Ewing (NBA), Ivan McFarlin (NBA), Kenny Taylor (Baylor), Andre Watson (Southern Idaho), Curtis Walker (Tyler JC)\n\nNotable Wins: Slam Dunk To The Beach Tournament (DL), Clements (TX), Hightower (TX), Elkins (TX), Bryan (TX)\n\nCoach: Ronnie Courtney\n\nWillowridge won a Texas record of 62 consecutive games to conclude the 2001 season.

Cat quick point guard Ford led Willowridge at the point guard position. He was one of the top recruits in the country, averaging 12 points, 9.4 assists and 7.8 steals . He later went on to star at Texas and was a lottery pick in the NBA draft. Daniel Ewing the team’s off guard was a highly touted recruit as well. Ewing paired with Ford to make the best back court in the country, as Ewing averaged over 22 points per game. Ewing stared at Duke before playing over 5 seasons in the NBA. Ultra athlete and Oklahoma State commit Ivan McFarlin held down the paint for Willowridge.\n\nIn the Texas state final Willowridge took on Bryan, who kept the game close, but the Vikings didn't have enough to get by the Eagles. The 16,204 fans in attendance saw Willowridge extend there winning streak. Willowridge was recognized as the Number Two team in the country in USA Today's Super 25 boys basketball rankings. Although they faced the best Texas had to offer, critics reasoned that they could have faced tougher conception.\n\n\"We have a lot of confidence in each other,\" Willowridge guard T.J. Ford said. \"We believe in each other. We said (beforehand) we're going to go 39-0. We're never playing in the blue uniform again, let's leave it all on the court.\"\n\n17) 2016-2017 La Lumiere (La Porte, IN) (29-1)\n\nPlayers: Jaren Jackson (NBA), Jordan Poole (NBA), Brian Bowen (McDonalds All-American), Tyger Campbell (UCLA), Jeremiah Tilmon (Missouri), Isaiah Coleman-Lands (Miami Ohio)\n\nNotable Wins: Findlay Prep (NV), Sierra Canyon (CA), IMG Academy (FL), Montverde Academy (FL), New Albany (IN)\n\nCoach: Pat Holmes\n\nWire to wire ranked as the No. 1 in the USA Today rankings and concluded with an impressive 29-1 record, securing victory over Montverde Academy in the 2017 Final.\n\nThe starting five was a powerhouse of talent, each position seamlessly complementing the others.

Brian Bowen and Jordan Poole provided a punch to the team's outside scoring, both proving to be excellent shooters with remarkable length, causing havoc for opposing teams.\n\nTheir lone loss came against a formidable Sierra Canyon team with a score of 76-74, led by Marvin Bagley III with 21 points and nine rebounds, and Remy Martin contributing 18 points and 13 assists.\n\nLeading scorer Brian Bowen had a stellar performance with 19 points in a tight 54-52 victory over then-No. 7 Findlay Prep in a DICK’S Nationals semifinal, while Jackson demonstrated his prowess with 19 points and 12 rebounds in a commanding 64-52 defeat of then-No. 16 Wasatch Academy. In the Championship game Bowen had 15 points and 7 rebounds and Jaren Jackson had 17 points in a 70-52 defeat of then-No. 8 Montverde Academy.

Guided by the extraordinary talent of junior Lamar Odom, this team was being hailed as the greatest New York team ever just halfway through the season. The Royals showcased an unparalleled back court, featuring two NBA-quality point guards in Speedy Claxton and Eric Barkley, demonstrating exceptional ball-handling skills. Ira Miller, a 6-5 senior guard, rounded out the starting five for the Royals. The team boasted a multitude of scoring options during the 1996 season, with Barkley averaging 15 points, Claxton 17 points, Odom 15 points, and senior Ira Miller contributing 14 points. Notably, they started the 1996 season ranked fifth in USA Today's preseason poll.\n\nOdom shot up 6 inches before his Sophomore season (1995), transforming him from a 6-2 guard into a 6-8 point forward. He patterned his game after that of Lloyd Daniels. The man known to most as \"Sweet Pea\" was a legend in New York City, a 6'8\" guard-forward hybrid whose ability to play the point at his size made him both a spitting image of Magic and a model for Lamar. As Odom told Sports Illustrated: \"People used to call me Little Lloyd.”\n\nThe story of this remarkable team began in 1995 when they secured the Catholic League title. Odom, broke the school record for blocked shots (95) while averaging an impressive 15 points and 10 rebounds. In the Catholic league title game against St. Raymond’s, Odom solidified his nation wide status by scoring 36 points, breaking the individual scoring record set by Lew Alcindor (Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and tied by current NBA players Kenny Anderson and Felipe Lopez. Odom's Royals lost to Stephon Marbury's Lincoln High School squad in the 1995 Federation tournament.\n\nFast forward to 1996, and the team breezed through the competition before entering the New York City playoffs. Lamar Odom led his team to a decisive 73-55 victory over St. Raymond of the Bronx in a Catholic High School Athletic Association Class A Intersectional quarterfinal game at Manhattan College. In the Catholic league semi-finals, they secured a 68-46 victory over St. Francis Prep, with Lamar Odom contributing 16 points, 21 rebounds, 5 assists, and 6 blocks, and Eric Barkley adding 17.\n\nThe stage was set for the most legendary game in New York City history. In the final, Rice pulled off a shocker by defeating Christ The King in an instant New York City classic. The Royals seemed to have the game under control late when Ira Miller was fouled. Christ the King appeared to take the final lead when Ira Miller hit two foul shots to put his team up 63-62 with 7.8 seconds remaining in overtime. Then Rice’s Bevon Robin scored the winning basket on a coast-to-coast layup with 1.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter, sealing an upset victory.\n\nOdom was named The New York Times Player of The Year in 1996. The next season he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas and was named Parade magazine National Player of the Year.

At 6’6 Black had tremendous size and passing ability for a lead guard. 6-7 forward Ron Holland, was the number 1 ranked junior in the nation. The McDonald's All-American Black was named District 11-6A Offensive Player of the Year, but it was Holland named its overall player of the year after averaging 15 ppg, 8 rpg, 2 spg on 60% shooting.

MaxPreps had them ranked #1 in the nation at the end of the season, ESPN had them ranked #3 behind Mount Verde and Link Academy, both of who lost to Duncanville.\n\n“I’ve been coming down here for 28 years,” McKinney’s head coach, said after a 69-49 loss to Duncanville in Saturday’s 6A state championship game. “I’ve seen a lot of great teams ... I’m not so sure that team we just played here is not the best I’ve ever seen down here.” “I agree,” Duncanville coach Peavy said. “That was our goal this year, right? We wanted to be considered one of the best teams to ever come through Texas.” “We went and played against everybody we could,” Peavy said. “We went around the country. We played Montverde, we beat — I don’t know why they don’t give us credit for it, because it was a scrimmage — but our guys played against Sunrise and beat them by 20, our guys played against Link and beat them. We did stumble against Richardson, and I feel like these guys did a great job of bouncing back and finishing off what we planned on.”\n\n20) 2002-2003 Saint Vincent Saint Mary (Akron, OH) (32-0)\n\nPlayers: Lebron James (NBA), Romeo Travis (Akron), Dru Joyce Jr (Akron), Sian Cotton (Ohio State Football)\n\nNotable Wins: Mater Dei (CA), Westchester (CA), Oak Hill (VA), Strawberry Mansion, Chester (PA), Dunbar (MD)\n\nCoach: Dru Joyce\n\nOne of the early teams to receive multiple appearances on national television led by future NBA superstar LeBron James, often considered one of the best high school players ever.

Travis continued his impressive career at the University of Akron, where he achieved player of the year honors as a senior. The team's point guard, Dru Joyce, also had a standout senior season, contributing with his long range shooting. Post-season, he continued his career at the University of Akron.\n\nTheir story was brought to life in a documentary film called More Than A Game. The core of the team played together through grade school and high school. Something that is rare for any high school team ranked nationally.\n\nSaint Marys faced a challenging schedule, featuring several nationally televised games. They started the year with a decisive 82-60 victory over Oak Hill on ESPN and continued their dominance by defeating nationally ranked Mater Dei in southern California by 20 points on ESPN2 in December.

Garnett was the number 1 prospect on the entire planet. The 6-11 forward from Mauldin, South Carolina moved from his home to join one of the country's best guards in Ronnie Fields. Garnett and his little sister moved to inner city Chicago for Garnett's senior year to form one of the most unstoppable duos in basketball history.\n\nFields was an absolute airshow, at one time he challenged Michael Jordan to a dunk contest as a high school junior. He was so spectacular even his misses were stuff of legend. Before an injury derailed his career, he was one of the top guards in the country. Garnett showcased his skills on his way to becoming the first prep to get drafted in the NBA since Moses Malone in 1978. During his senior season he averaged 26 points, 18 rebounds, seven assists and six blocks a game in a competitive Chicago Public School League. Garnett was the National Player of the Year in 1995 and became the first high school player picked in the NBA draft in 20 years, when he was selected No. 5 overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The team also featured future Arizona Wildcat Michael Wright, only a freshman at the time.\n\nCoach Willie Nelson had this to say about Garnett “He seems to bring out the best in people and always seems to find a way to smile about everything. He doesn’t think about a lot of the pressures of life. Everybody who meets him, as he turns around and walks away, they’ll say: `That’s a nice kid.’ Long after he’s gone, he’ll still be here. Everybody will remember.”\n\nThe St. Louis Coca-Cola Shootout was one of the best high school tournaments in the mid 90’s. Garnett’s presence brought NBA executives and scouts Jerry West, Bernie Bickerstaff and Ed Manning to Kiel Center to watch Farragut matchup with Vashon High School out of St. Louis. KG finished with 24 points and 15 rebounds and sparked the late charge along with Ronnie Fields (20 points) to edge St. Louis Vashon 58-55. The tournament also featured Mainland out of Daytona Beach featuring Vince Carter, and Lincoln out of Brooklyn featuring Stephon Marbury. They also won the Proviso West Holiday Tournament Championship 1994 against Chicago Vocational School and a loaded Westinghouse Team.\n\nThey were able to beat Carver High in front of a sold out crowd in the Chicago Public League final. This team was a part of one of the biggest upsets in High School Basketball history. In the 1995 Illinois State Quarterfinal Farragut faced off against Thornton High. Thornton was loaded with talented athletes like sophomore center Melvin Ely and future NFL players Antwaan Randle-El, Napoleon Harris, and Tai Streets (The 95’ Thornton Football team was upset in the State Playoffs). Shutting down 6-11 Kevin Garnett with an aggressive game plan, Thornton held on for a 46-43 victory over the top-ranked Admirals before a crowd of 12,229 in the Class AA quarterfinals. Because of the loss Farragut finished ranked No. 3 in the Super 25 in 1994-95 and won its first Public League championship.\n\n22) 1992-1993 Simon Gratz Philadelphia, PA (Philadelphia, PA) (31-0)\n\nPlayers: Rasheed Wallace (NBA), Terrell Stokes (Maryland), Lynard Stewart (Temple), Aaron “AO” Owens (D2 All-American), Shawn “Reds” Smith (La Salle), Alem Watson, Rondell Turner (Rhode Island), Jamahai Redmond\n\nNotable Wins: Strawberry Mansion (NJ), Roman Catholic (PA), Reading (PA), Proviso East (IL), DeMatha Catholic (MD), Shawnee (NJ), Dunbar (MD), St. Patrick (NJ)\n\nCoach: Bill Ellerbee\n\nA 31-0 record and a Public League championship only begin to tell the story of the greatness of head coach Bill Ellerbee's Bulldogs. The third Public League championship in four years, Gratz won by an average score of 69-39\n\nNot only did Gratz have a slew of Division I guards and forwards, it had a dominant centerpiece in 6-11 All-American center Rasheed Wallace. Wallace was a man amongst boys. He averaged 16 points, 15 rebounds, and seven blocks per game, despite spending many fourth quarters on the bench with the game's outcome already decided. If Wallace's talent wasn't enough to intimidate opposing teams, the nascent reputation of his temper was. Wallace remains the only player to ever have been ejected from the McDonald's All-American game.\n\nWith constantly being double-teamed, Wallace unselfishly got his teammates involved — and they rose to the occasion. Second team all-city selection Rondell Turner actually led the team in scoring. Fellow forward Jamahal Redmond was also a key cog in the Gratz attack. Lynard Stewart (6-10), who went to Temple, also saw some minutes.\n\nThe team's guard play was almost equally impressive. Junior Shawn \"Reds\" Smith was a second team all-city selection who played at LaSalle. Sophomore Terrel Stokes would later head to Maryland. Alem Watson, who started at guard, could certainly hit a big 3-pointer in a pressure situation.\n\nSonny Hill, who has witnessed all of the city's great teams and players since the early 1950s, said \"This Gratz team would be able to beat Gene's team (77’ West Philadelphia). As great as Gene was, he would have a difficult time, at 6-6, against someone as tall and as good as Rasheed. I mean, he just closes the inside off. \"Then, there's the depth factor. Gene's team didn't have people coming off the bench like Turner and Stewart. With them, you're talking some heavy artillery.\"\n\nAll of the Gratz's players jelled beautifully, especially in the playoffs, winning the city semifinals and finals by a combined 38 points. They would face a tough National schedule winning the prestigious Myrtle Beach tournament in South Carolina before playing a bevy of nationally ranked teams. They went on to win the PA State Championship in 1993 to cap their perfect season by defeating Franklin Learning Center 63-45.\n\n23) 1979-1980 West Memphis (30-0) (West Memphis, AR) (31-0)\n\nPlayers: Keith Lee (NBA), Michael Cage (NBA), Aaron Price (Memphis), Stanley Andrews, Tim Harrell (D-3 All American)\n\nNotable Wins: Marion (AR), Searcy (AR), Sylvan Hills (AR)\n\nCoach: Bill Terwilliger\n\nHands down the best team in the history of Arkansas basketball. West Memphis featured two future NBA players in Keith Lee and Michael Cage. The two formed the core of a team that outscored opponents by an average of almost 20 points per game during a 30-0 run in the 1979-1980 season. During Lee’s junior and senior season, the team would go undefeated winning the state championship with ease. They finished the season ranked third in the nation. 1981 saw another unblemished season as they finished 30-0 again, despite the graduation of Michael Cage.\n\nThe team was one of the biggest in high school basketball history. The front line was 7’0, 6’10 and 6’7 featuring the beast that was Michael Cage. Teams of this size were seldom seen back then, the absence of a three point line made the matchup that much more daunting for opposing teams. Despite trailing, opposing teams would regularly hold the ball for the entire game to keep them from shooting. Don’t forget Michael Cage had the best Jheri Curl in the history of basketball. Cage went on to a notable college career at San Diego State and 15 years as one of the NBA's most dominant rebounders. Cage's NBA career included stops with the Los Angeles Clippers, Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets. There was an appearance in the Western Conference semifinals with the SuperSonics in 1990, and a 63-victory season with the Sonics in 1993-1994. But nothing like the time at West Memphis. \"I had known these guys since first grade,\" Cage said. ”To me, we were just all guys from the neighborhood. All the sudden people started talking to us about how special we were. We just wanted to win. We were all guys from a neighborhood who liked to play with each other.” said Cage. Harrell went on to an All-America career at NAIA Central Bible College in Springfield, Missouri. Keith Lee went to Memphis, where he starred for the Tigers before going on to the NBA.\n\n\"When he was a senior, Keith's junior year, Keith might have gotten more points or numbers, but at crucial times Michael was the one that would step up and get the key rebound,\" Terwilliger said. \"Lots of times it doesn't show up on the stats, but he was the one that drove us to a lot of those wins.” \"It was just really like a dream come true,\" Cage said. There State title win in 1980 was the schools first Arkansas state title. After Cage graduated, West Memphis had another undeafted season, their winning streak went to 60 which still stands as an Arkansas state record.\n\n24) 2005-2006 North College Hill (Cincinnati, OH) (26-1)\n\nPlayers: OJ Mayo (NBA), Bill Walker (NBA), Keenan Ellis (UAB), Darion Goins (Bowling Green), Damon Butler, Nathaniel Glover, Andre Evans, Dwayne Parks\n\nNotable Wins: Strawberry Mansion (NJ), Roman Catholic (PA), Proviso East (IL), DeMatha Catholic (MD), Shawnee (NJ), Dunbar (MD), St. Patrick (NJ)\n\nCoach: Jamie Mahaffey\n\nMayo and Walker were celebrities before ever stepping feet on North College Hill campus. North College Hill could have been described best as a random public school on the outskirts of Cincinnati. They did not have any rich basketball history and had serious financial trouble before Mayo and Walker arrived. OJ Mayo was a child prodigy, playing varsity as a 7th grader and averaging over 20 points per game in the state of Kentucky. O.J. and Bill were best friends since elementary school, they were seen as saviors of a financially strapped school and its athletic department. As freshman the two seemingly arrived on campus out of nowhere, prompting the high school to call in PR agencies to seek advice on how to deal with all the new media request.\n\nThis was a very young team headlined by juniors Mayo and Walker, both top five basketball players in their class at the time. OJ was not only one of the most hyped recruits ever but he also possessed a smooth offensive game that was well beyond his years. He was so confident that he challenged Michael Jordan at his own camp. You can see the footage here. Walker was a 6’6 forward that was an insane athlete who walked on air with tip dunks and explosive moves to the basket. On the season, Mayo averaged 27.9 ppg while Bill Walker averaged 22 points and 10 rebounds. They were not without help, as 6’11 top 50 junior Keenan Ellis controlled the paint averaging 11.5 points a game. Swingman Andre Evans contributed 8.9 points per contest. John Lasonczyk, a North College Hill patrolman and the school’s resource officer, sat on the NCH bench to keep autograph seekers away from players during games. He often chased fans from the team bus.\n\nThe Trojans brash showtime style and trash talking antics rubbed many critics the wrong way. However they were a fun and joyous team to watch. They made national headlines by beating a Wellston Ohio team by 104 points. They beat a Patterson team led by veterans players like Jordan Hill and Davon Jefferson by a score of 75-63.\n\nIn a game that was called a high school national championship. North College Hill took on Oak Hill Academy. North College Hill had won 40 straight games entering the contest with Oak Hill. The talented Warriors team were led by Ty Lawson, Mike Beasley, and Nolan Smith. NCH was without 6-11 big man Keenan Ellis who was suspended for the contest. The loss of Ellis was big for NCH who lacked size and depth on the roster. Despite a spectacular 43 points from OJ Mayo and 24 from Bill Walker, the Trojans suffered their only loss of the season.\n\nThey won back to back state titles in 2005 and 2006. They won it all by defeating Ironton 71-65 in the 2005 state final, with Bill Walker going for 19 and Mayo going for 22. They won the 2006 State Title by beating Flegeland St. Joseph, led by David Lighty, by a score of 90 to 73. Mayo led the way with 34 and Walker scored 22 points for the Trojans. They finished the season ranked 2nd in the nation by USA Today, behind only Oak Hill Academy.\n\n25) 1997-1998 Miami Senior High School (Miami, FL) (34-1)\n\nPlayers: Steve Blake (NBA), Udonis Haslem (NBA), Sylbrin Robinson (Florida), Antonio Latimer (Southern Missouri), Andre Johnson (NFL)\n\nNotable Wins: Fairfax (CA), Coral Gables (FL), Braddock (FL), Edgewater (FL), Learning Center (PA)\n\nCoach: Frank Martin\n\nThis team had a lot of Miami flavor with heavy ties to both the Miami Hurricanes and Florida Gators. The Stingarees had become the Yankees of Florida high school basketball, earning sponsorship from Nike and traveling to prestigious tournaments around the country. They went 36-1 in 1997, Martin's second season, and his 1998 team was easily the best in the state, featuring future pros Udonis Haslem and Steve Blake. Miami senior forwards Udonis Haslem (6-foot-9), Sylbrin Robinson (6-10) and Antonio Latimer (6-8) made up one of the most imposing front lines in the country. All four of their stars were named All Made County by the Miami Herald.\n\nThey played in a gym known as “The Asylum”, a dim and hazy, filled with dirty orange light filtering down from overhead bulbs. Thousands of crazed fans would pack this gym every time Miami Senior High took the court. The school drew a lot of controversy and eventually a future suspension from the transfer of point guard Steve Blake. “The Orange Bowl Crew” as they were known, would work University of Miami home football games to earn money for the basketball team to travel. The Stingrays also featured future NFL superstar and future Miami Hurricane wide receiver Andre Johnson.\n\nFrank Martin was a seriously intimidating coach and that was from his time in college at Kansas State. Imagine what he was like in high school. He gets my vote for the new age Bob Knight. The team almost added another star player when Florida Gator committ Tedd Dupay considered jumping from Mariner High School to Miami Senior. The McDonalds All-American eventually decided against the move.\n\nJunior transfer Steve Blake, provided Miami with an elite guard. The 6 foot 3 guard, averaged 10 points and eight assists while playing less than 16 minutes a game. Udonis Haslem Averaged 14.2 points and 8.0 rebounds a game on the season. Haslem would go on to play for both the Florida Gators and Miami Heat, becoming a home town favorite.\n\nTheir lone loss of the season came after they flew across the country to Hawaii to play in the Iolani Classic. They won their first two games before falling in to Provo, Utah in the Semi Final. They won the following game against Fairfax Log Angeles to give them 3rd place in the tournament. The following week they beat the Learning Center out of Philadelphia in the Chelsea Mass Shootout.\n\nWith five players scoring in double digits, Miami High manhandled Edgewater, 89-56, to clinch the Class 6A boys state basketball title at The Lakeland Center. Edgewater junior Marquis Daniels wowed the crowd with a game-best 24 points, including numerous acrobatic shots.For the 4,256 fans in attendance, the victory was a familiar sight as Miami rolled to its seventh state title in the last nine seasons. The victory was also Miami’s 67th in a row against a Florida school, one shy of the state record for large-school competition. The Stingrays finished 36-1 and were ranked in the top 10 nationally by three publications. They were ranked No. 2 in one national poll this past season and No. 4 by USA Today.\n\nThe 1999 season had a few great teams competing for the USA Today Title. DeMatha featured a pair of stars in Keith Bogans and Joe Forte, St. Patrick (New Jersey) featured Al Harrington, Dominguez had a freshman Tyson Chandler and Tayshaun Prince. Whitney Young was the number 1 team in Chicago, they featured Quentin Richardson and St. Johns (Georgia) had two of the highest recruits in the nation in Jason Capel and Damian Wilkins. I think the 98 Miami Senior High team could have beat any of them.\n\n25) 2003-2004 Abraham Lincoln (Brooklyn, NY) (31-3)\n\nPlayers: Sebastian Telfair (NBA) , Antonio Pena (Villanova), Eugene Lawrence (St. Johns), Nyan Boateng (NFL), Yuri Matsakov (Umass Lowell)\n\nNotable Wins: Atlanta Southwest Christian (GA), Edgewater Orlando (FL), Cardozo (NY)\n\nCoach: Dwayne “Tiny” Morton\n\nThe only team in New York City history to win 3 straight titles was led by New York’s all time leading scorer. NBA lottery pick Sebastian Telfair and longtime coach Dwayne “Tiny” Morton led the Railsplitters to a 31-3 record in 2004, while facing national competition. Telfair and his teammates were featured in the ESPN documentary Through The Fire. They played the number 1 recruit in the nation Dwight Howard and future McDonalds All-American Javaris Crittenton on ESPN. The game was attended by stars like Jay-Z, Derek Jeter and Rick Pattino. The team had plenty of fire power besides Telfair in Villanova commit Antonio Pena, Eugene Lawrence who played at St. Johns and Ryan Boatning an athletic swingman that went on to play division 1 college football. Since 2004, New York City has not showcased a better high school basketball team.\n\nSebastian Telfair entered his senior season as a 5-star recruit and a top 10 national player. The cousin of Stephon Marbury, Telfair garnered significant attention, initially making headlines as a Coney Island schoolboy featured in Slam Magazine as the best 7th grader in the nation. His reputation continued to swell, and before the 2004 campaign, Telfair shared the cover of Slam Magazine with LeBron James. Throughout that summer, he played for Jay-Z’s EBC team at Rucker Park. As his popularity soared, ESPN decided to produce a full-length documentary on the Lincoln team. Telfair's impressive performance during the 2004 season surpassed expectations, elevating him into the NBA Draft lottery—a feat considered unlikely at the season's outset. His highlights included being named New York’s Mr. Basketball, setting the state career scoring record, and achieving the Lincoln single-game record with an impressive 61 points.\n\nAntonio Pena, a versatile 6-8 forward, played a pivotal role as the team's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder. His contributions extended to the interior presence he provided for the Railsplitters. Nyan Boateng, an athletic wing, was ranked as the 10th best shooting guard recruit out of high school by Rivals.com. He was also ranked as the 20th best wide receiver in the country. He would go on to play Football at the University of Florida before embarking on a short NFL career. Guard Eugene Lawrence, who formed a phenomenal backcourt tandem with Telfair, played college basketball at St. Johns.\n\nIn a December re-match against Edgewater High of Orlando that was televised on ESPN2, Telfair led Lincoln to a 82-77 victory, scoring 16 of his 27 points after spraining his ankle. The victory avenged a five point loss from the previous season. The following month against Harvard-Westlake at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, he scored 37 points in front of a host of NBA suits, including Celtics boss Danny Ainge and Lakers G.M. Mitch Kupchak, as Lincoln won 85-82. On Feb. 7 he had 30 points, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer to dispatch Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy and its star Center, future No. 1 pick Dwight Howard.\n\nHe led Lincoln to a 74-65 win over nationally ranked Cardozo High in New York City Public League Final in 2004 with 14 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and no turnovers. “That felt unbelievable,” Telfair said after he led Lincoln to a 74-65 win over top-seeded Cardozo in the PSAL championship, the team’s third in as many years. “It’s a great way to end things here.” Flushing native Antonio Pena had 15 points and eight rebounds and Nyan Boateng added 10 points for Lincoln, which became the first team in the 100-year history of the PSAL to win its third consecutive crown. Sebastian Telfair walked off the court during the final seconds last night, soaking in the adulation of the 12,021 fans at the Garden. Lincoln might be higher on the list but a 66-52 loss to Mount Vernon in the State playoffs dashed their state title hopes.\n\nGreatest High School Basketball Teams of All Time - Honorable Mention\n\n1957 Middletown (OH), 1959 McClymonds (CA), 1964 Power Memorial (NY), 1968 Compton (CA), 1971 Washington High East Chicago (IN), 1974 Verbum Dei (CA), 1977 West Philadelphia (PA), 1977 T.C.
