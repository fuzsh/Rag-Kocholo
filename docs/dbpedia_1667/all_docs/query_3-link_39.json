A cable authorization may be required.\n\nThe FOX Sports GO mobile app can be downloaded for free from the iTunes App Store, Google Play, Amazon App Store or the Windows Store, and the games are now available internationally.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season will have free live stats. Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the small bar graph icon on the scoreboard at the top of the page for the event of your choosing.\n\nHome games can also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nScouting Creighton\n\nCreighton has won six straight games to improve to 10-2 this season, including wins over No. 12 Texas Tech (83-76 in OT on Nov. 29), Nebraska (95-76 on Dec. 7), Oklahoma (83-73 on Dec. 17) and Arizona State (67-60 on Dec. 21).\n\nThe Bluejays are 8-0 at home this year, with each victory by nine points or more.\n\nCU returns five of its top six scorers from a year ago, a group led by guards Marcus Zegarowski (18.4 ppg., 4.7 apg.), Ty-Shon Alexander (16.3 ppg., 6.3 rpg.) and Mitch Ballock (13.0 ppg., 5.4 rpg.). The trio have accounted for 100 three-pointers and 61.2 percent of CU's overall points thus far.\n\nAnother player to keep an eye on is junior forward Denzel Mahoney, who debuted on Dec. 17 and had 14 points in wins over both Oklahoma and Arizona State.\n\nThe Bluejays have played this year without the services of senior guard Davion Mintz (9.7 ppg., in 28.8 mpg. last season) and sophomore center Jacob Epperson (4.8 ppg last season) due to injury.\n\nOverall, Creighton returns nine lettermen and four starters from last year's team that finished 20-15 and tied for third in the BIG EAST Conference with a 9-9 league record. The Bluejays advanced to the quarterfinals of the NIT with victories over Loyola (Chicago) and Memphis before falling at TCU.\n\nScouting Midland\n\nAn NAIA team located in Fremont, Neb., Midland is 3-8 this season. That record does not include a 72-53 exhibition setback at Nebraska-Omaha on Nov. 7th.\n\nLaurence Merritt leads Midland with 17.9 points per game. His 28 three-pointers and 50.9 percent marksmanship from three-point range lead the team, as well.\n\nAlso averaging in double-figures are Bowen Sandquist (11.6 ppg.) and Kylan Smallwood (10.9 ppg.).\n\nThe Warriors average 77.7 points per game and allow 84.9 points per contest, though they do win the board battle by 6.7 rebounds per contest.\n\nSeries History vs. Midland\n\nCreighton is 3-0 all-time against Midland, with all three meetings taking place more than 90 years ago.\n\nCreighton won 43-17 and 59-14 on back-to-back days in December of 1921 before claiming a 63-6 decision on Dec. 12, 1925 in the most recent meeting. That 63-6 victory remains the largest margin of victory for any game in Bluejay history.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-1 in his career against Midland, with both meetings taking place when McDermott was head coach at Wayne State from 1994-2000.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his 10th year as head coach at Creighton. He is 217-111 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 497-306 in his 26th season and is 366-242 in his 19th Division I campaign. Alan Huss, Paul Lusk and Terrence Rencher assist McDermott.\n\nMidland vs. Division I Opponents\n\nTonight will be Midland's sixth game since 2006 against a Division I opponent.\n\nThe Warriors are still in search of their first win in those games.\n\nDate Opponent Score\n\nNov. 7, 2019 at Nebraska-Omaha L 72-53\n\nNov. 7, 2012 at Nebraska L 68-40\n\nDec. 28, 2010 at South Dakota L 93-69\n\nNov. 29, 2009 at South Dakota L 104-71\n\nDec. 21, 2008 at South Dakota L 86-64\n\nDoes This Count?\n\nSaturday's game will count towards Creighton's win/loss record, and all statistics will count just like any other regular-season game for the Bluejays.\n\nThe only places the game will not count is in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) or NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET), which does not include results against non-Division I opponents.\n\nThe game will count as an exhibition game for Midland and the stats will not count for the Warriors, nor towards Midland's win/loss record.\n\nAgainst Non-Division I Foes\n\nCreighton doesn't play many teams that are not Division I, but did defeat Truman State (101-69) in 2017, Bemidji State (94-46) in 2018 and Coe (110-60) last year.\n\nThe Bluejays have not lost to a non-Division I team in the regular-season since falling at Hawaii-Hilo on December 29, 1993 in the Big Island Invitational.\n\nThe Bluejays have not lost at home to a non-Division I team in the regular-season since losing to then-Division II foe Nebraska-Omaha on December 11, 1982.\n\nLast Midland Meeting Made History\n\nThe last time Creighton and Midland met way back in 1925, the Bluejays posted a 63-6 victory. It remains the largest margin of victory in Creighton history.\n\nHere's a list of Creighton's largest winning margins ever. The 113-58 triumph over Longwood on Dec. 9, 2016 is the CHI Health Center Omaha record.\n\nMost Lopsided Wins\n\nOpponent Margin Score Date\n\nMidland 57 63-6 12/12/25\n\nUT Arlington 56 106-50 11/17/02\n\nRegis 55 93-38 11/30/73\n\nLongwood 55 113-58 12/09/16\n\nMorningside 54 105-51 02/17/61\n\nUSC Upstate 54 116-62 12/20/17\n\nDrake 53 79-26 02/14/33\n\nNorthern Colorado 51 105-54 12/02/59\n\nSouth Dakota State 51 67-16 01/11/27\n\nMaryland-Eastern Shore 51 87-36 12/15/17\n\nThe 10 Wins of Christmas\n\nCreighton went 10-2 prior to Christmas, the seventh time in program history that CU picked up 10 or more wins by December 25th.\n\nFive of those occasions have taken place under Greg McDermott.\n\nEach of the previous six times it's been done, Creighton won at least 21 games that year. All but one of those teams reached the NCAA Tournament and all but two clubs also won a postseason contest.\n\nMost Wins by December 25th\n\nW-L Season Final W-L Postseason?\n\n10-1 1963-64 22-7 NCAA (1-2)\n\n10-2 2008-09 27-8 NIT (1-1)\n\n10-1 2011-12 29-6 NCAA (1-1)\n\n11-1 2012-13 28-8 NCAA (1-1)\n\n12-0 2016-17 25-10 NCAA (0-1)\n\n10-2 2017-18 21-12 NCAA (0-1)\n\n10-2 2019-20 TBD TBD\n\nMoving On Up\n\nCreighton was 56 in the initial NET rankings released on Dec. 16, and that figure has surged to 24 after wins over Oklahoma and Texas Tech since then.\n\nAfter meeting Midland, CU will play 16 of its final 18 regular-season games against teams that currently own a top-51 NET rating.\n\nThey Call It A Winning Streak\n\nCreighton enters Saturday's contest vs. Midland with a six-game winning streak, the program's longest since starting the 2016-17 campaign with a 13-0 record.\n\nThis is the 10th different win streak of six or longer under Greg McDermott. A win vs. Midland would be CU's seventh such streak of seven or more.\n\nEach of Creighton's last six times that Creighton has had a win streak of seven or longer, that Bluejays team has reached the NCAA Tournament at year's end.\n\nLongest Creighton Win Streaks Under McDermott\n\nWins Dates Snapped By\n\n13 - Nov. 11 - Dec. 28, 2016 #1 Villanova, 80-70\n\n11 - Dec. 31, 2011 - Feb. 1, 2012 at Northern Iowa, 65-62\n\n11 - Dec. 1, 2012 - Jan. 15, 2013 at Wichita State, 67-64\n\n10 - Dec. 3, 2013 - Jan. 14, 2014 at Providence, 81-68\n\n8 - Feb. 14 - March 16, 2012 vs. #4 North Carolina, 87-73\n\n7 - Nov. 11 - Dec. 4, 2011 at Saint Joseph's, 80-71\n\n6 - Dec. 11, 2010 - Jan. 1, 2011 Missouri State, 67-55\n\n6 - Nov. 9-24, 2012 Boise State, 83-70\n\n6 - Feb. 27-March 22, 2013 vs. #6 Duke, 66-50\n\n6 - Nov. 29, 2019 - Present ? ? ?\n\nDecember To Remember\n\nCreighton is currently 5-0 in the month of December. With a victory on Saturday vs. Midland, CU will own its first unbeaten December since the 2012-13 team.\n\nEach of CU's last two teams (2008-09 and 2012-13) to go unbeaten in December also won their regular-season league title.\n\nShooting Star\n\nMitch Ballock did not make a three-pointer in Creighton's season-opener, but has drained multiple trifectas in each of the 11 games since then.\n\nBallock is Creighton's first player with 10 (or more) straight games of two or more three-pointers since Ethan Wragge did it in 16 straight games from Nov. 28, 2013 - Jan. 4, 2014.\n\nPrior to Wragge, the last Bluejay with a streak of 10 or more was Kyle Korver, who ended his career in 2003 with 13 straight games of multiple trey's.\n\nBy comparison, only three players in the NBA had active streaks of 11 straight games or longer with multiple three-pointers through December 22nd:\n\nRk. Streak Name, Team Next\n\n1. 28 James Harden, Houston 12/23\n\n2. 14 Duncan Robinson, Miami 12/23\n\n3. 12 Damian Lillard, Portland 12/23\n\nMahoney Makes Debut\n\nThe Dec. 17 win vs. Oklahoma marked the first appearance in a Creighton uniform for Denzel Mahoney, who regained his eligibility after CU's first semester concluded.\n\nMahoney didn't start for the first time in 65 contests as a collegian, but didn't have to wait long. He checked in just 18 seconds into the game after an early foul on Christian Bishop and drained his first three-pointer as a Bluejay just more than two minutes later. Mahoney finished the game with 14 points, one rebound, one assist and a steal in 29 minutes of action.\n\nMahoney averaged 19.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game the last time he was on the court during the 2017-18 season at Southeast Missouri State.\n\nIn two seasons with the Redhawks from 2016-18, Mahoney scored 1,091 points and grabbed 298 rebounds. He made 121 three-pointers while connecting at a 39.5 percent clip and also sank 314-of-380 free throw attempts (82.6 percent).\n\nMahoney is the sixth player in Greg McDermott's 10 seasons to make his Creighton debut with 14 points or more, as seen below. Of those six men, only Marcus Foster had 14 points or more in his second game, as well. Foster had eight straight games of 15+ points to open his Bluejay career.\n\n14+ Points in CU Debut Under Greg McDermott\n\nPts. Name Season Game 2 Game 3\n\n19 Marcus Foster 2016-17 15 16\n\n18 Khyri Thomas 2015-16 4 11\n\n18 Ricky Kreklow 2014-15 5 4\n\n16 Doug McDermott 2010-11 10 12\n\n15 Devin Brooks 2013-14 4 16\n\n14 Denzel Mahoney 2019-20 14 TBD\n\nGetting Defensive\n\nCreighton has held each of its past three opponents under 40 percent shooting from the field, limiting the offensive production of UTRGV (.397), Oklahoma (.333) and Arizona State (.354).\n\nIt's the first time that the Jays have done that in three straight games since a four-game streak from Dec. 17-31, 2013, against Arkansas-Pine Bluff, California, Chicago State and Marquette.\n\nCreighton has now held six opponents under 40 percent this season after doing it a total of seven times in 35 games a year ago.\n\nCreighton is 90-16 under Greg McDermott all-time when holding foes under 40 percent marksmanship.\n\nLast season Creighton ranked 286th in opponents' field goal percentage (.457). This year's team is holding foes to 42.0 percent shooting (it's best since .407 in 2012-13), a figure that ranks 76th-best nationally. The best finish by one of McDermott's Creighton teams in field goal percentage defense is 77th by the 2012-13 club.\n\nGo Big Or Go Home\n\nCreighton owns four regular-season non-conference wins this winter from teams that are in the Big Ten, BIG EAST, Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, Big 12 or Pac-12 Conferences.\n\nIt's just the third time since CU dropped its independent status in 1977 that the Bluejays have picked up four such wins in the same winter. The 2016-17 club had six such wins, while the 2012-13 squad also had four.\n\nAfter going 22-12 in such games under Dana Altman from 1994-2010, Creighton is 28-12 under Greg McDermott.\n\nHere's a list of Creighton's yearly regular-season non-conference records in the past 25 seasons against teams from those top leagues:\n\nYear W-L \"Major\" Conference Victories\n\n1994-95 0-2 -\n\n1995-96 0-1 -\n\n1996-97 1-3 Florida\n\n1997-98 1-1 Nebraska\n\n1998-99 3-1 Iowa, Baylor, Oklahoma State\n\n1999-00 3-0 Iowa, Baylor, Nebraska\n\n2000-01 2-0 Providence, Nebraska\n\n2001-02 1-0 Nebraska\n\n2002-03 2-0 Notre Dame, Nebraska\n\n2003-04 1-0 Nebraska\n\n2004-05 3-0 Missouri, Ohio State, Nebraska\n\n2005-06 1-1 Nebraska\n\n2006-07 0-1 -\n\n2007-08 2-0 DePaul, Nebraska\n\n2008-09 1-1 DePaul\n\n2009-10 1-1 Nebraska\n\n2010-11 0-3 -\n\n2011-12 3-0 Iowa, Nebraska, Northwestern\n\n2012-13 4-0 Wisconsin, Arizona State, Nebraska, Cal\n\n2013-14 3-0 Arizona State, Nebraska, Cal\n\n2014-15 2-1 Oklahoma, Nebraska\n\n2015-16 2-3 Rutgers, Nebraska\n\n2016-17 6-0 Wisconsin, Washington St., NC St., Ole Miss, Nebraska, Arizona St.\n\n2017-18 3-1 Northwestern, UCLA, Nebraska\n\n2018-19 1-3 Clemson\n\n2019-20 4-1 Texas Tech, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona St.\n\nChristian Puts In Work Before Christmas\n\nAfter a first half that saw him fail to record a point, rebound or blocked shot vs. Arizona State, sophomore Christian Bishop came up big in the second half against the Sun Devils.\n\nBishop had 12 points, nine rebounds and two blocked shots after halftime, helping Creighton to overcome a halftime deficit in the 67-60 win.\n\nBishop is the first Bluejay with a half of at least 12 points, nine rebounds and two blocked shots since Gregory Echenique had 13 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks before halftime vs. Houston Baptist on Dec. 17, 2011.\n\nCreighton has not had a player post a double-double in the same half since Doug McDermott had 17 points and 10 rebounds in the first half of a win on March 21, 2014 vs. Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nBallock Joins Top 10\n\nMitch Ballock leads Creighton with 37 three-point baskets this season, which gives him 176 in his Bluejay career.\n\nThe 176 trifectas rank 10th-most in program history, but he's just one trey away from tying Duan Cole for ninth place.\n\nOnly seven Bluejays have ever reached 200 or more triples, and Ballock (and classmate Ty-Shon Alexander) could join Kyle Korver and Ethan Wragge as the only Bluejays to reach that milestone as juniors.\n\nMost Career 3FG, Creighton History\n\n3FG Name Years\n\n371 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n334 Ethan Wragge 2009-14\n\n274 Doug McDermott 2010-14\n\n245 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n212 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n206 Jahenns Manigat 2010-14\n\n200 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n185 Matt Roggenburk 1986-90\n\n177 Duan Cole 1987-92\n\n176 Mitch Ballock 2017-Pres.\n\n171 Isaiah Zierden 2013-17\n\n168 Marcus Foster 2016-18\n\n161 Ty-Shon Alexander 2017-Pres.\n\nBallock For 3, Blocks That Is\n\nAfter a career-high three blocked shots on December 7th vs. Nebraska, Mitch Ballock ranks second on the Creighton team with eight swats this season.\n\nBallock is the first Bluejay with both three blocked shots and three made three-pointers in the same game since Kenny Lawson Jr. had three blocks and three treys vs. Missouri State on March 24, 2010. That game was also the final one of the Creighton sideline for Dana Altman.\n\nWhat A Line -- 30-6-9\n\nMarcus Zegarowski had 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists in Creighton's 95-76 win over Nebraska on Dec. 7th.\n\nThe 30 points were the second-highest figure of his career, the six assists tied a season-high, and his nine rebounds were a career-best.\n\nHe's the first Bluejay with at least 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists in the same game since at least 1979-80.\n\nZegarowski is just the fourth Creighton player with a game of at least 30 points and nine rebounds in the same game under Greg McDermott, joining Cole Huff, Kenny Lawson Jr. and Doug McDermott (11x).\n\nZegarowski is also just the second Creighton player under Greg McDermott with a game of at least 30 points and six assists, joining Marcus Foster vs. Georgetown (35 points, 6 assists) on Feb. 19, 2017.\n\nZegarowski is the nation's only player with a 30/9/6 game this season, and the only man in the last 10 years to do it without attempting a free throw.\n\nZegarowski had 20 points, eight rebounds and a then-season-high seven assists vs. Oklahoma on Dec. 17, the first Bluejay with those numbers in the same game since Ryan Sears had 25 points, eight rebounds and eight assists vs. Southern Illinois on Jan. 8, 2000.\n\nMore Z's Please\n\nMarcus Zegarowski is currently leading Creighton with 18.4 points per game and 4.7 assists per game.\n\nCreighton hasn't had a player average more than 15 points and 3.5 assists per game for a full season since Vernon Moore (21.0 ppg., 5.0 apg.) in 1984-85.\n\nA 6-2 guard, Moore shot an incredible 67.4 percent in 1984-85 back in the days before the three-point shot. Zegarowski is shooting 64.6 percent from two-point range this year, and last season led the BIG EAST in three-point percentage.\n\nZegarowski and Iowa State's Tyrese Haliburton are the only men in the country who are shooting 64.0 percent or better from two-point range while averaging 4.5 assists per game or more through games of December 22nd.\n\n3 x 3\n\nCreighton's backcourt features three of the nation's best shooters, as Ty-Shon Alexander, Mitch Ballock and Marcus Zegarowski have combined to shoot 100-for-239 (41.8 percent) as a group from deep.\n\nAlexander, Ballock and Zegarowski are one of two trios in the country with 31 or more three-pointers through games of Dec. 22nd, joining the North Florida grouping of Carter Hendricksen, J.T. Escobar and Ivan Gandia-Rosa. When CU defeated North Florida on Nov. 22nd, Creighton's trio shot 10-for-20 from deep, while the UNF trio shot 4-for-21 from downtown.\n\nCreighton is 14-3 all-time when Alexander, Ballock and Zegarowski all score in double-figures, including a 7-1 mark this winter with seven straight victories. The trio had combined for at least 50 percent of Creighton's points in each of the last 12 games dating back to CU's final contest last season before scoring \"just\" 26-of-67 points in last Saturday's win at Arizona State.\n\nAlexander The Great\n\nTy-Shon Alexander owns the Creighton team lead in rebounds per game (6.3) and is second on the team in points per game (16.3).\n\nSince 1992-93, only three Bluejays (Doug McDermott, Rodney Buford and Kyle Korver) have finished a season averaging at least 16.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.\n\nAll three men went on to play at least five seasons in the NBA.\n\n16.0 PPG & 5.5 RPG - Creighton Players Since 1991-92\n\nName Year PPG RPG\n\nDoug McDermott 2013-14 26.7 7.0\n\nDoug McDermott 2012-13 23.2 7.7\n\nDoug McDermott 2011-12 22.9 8.2\n\nRodney Buford 1996-97 19.6 5.6\n\nRodney Buford 1997-98 18.9 7.3\n\nRodney Buford 1998-99 18.6 7.2\n\nKyle Korver 2002-03 17.8 6.4\n\nTy-Shon Alexander 2018-19 16.3 6.3\n\nA Good Start\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 12 games in recent seasons.\n\nOf note, Creighton has started 8-4 or better after 12 games in 21 of the past 23 seasons.\n\nCreighton Stats Through 12 Games, Since 1994-95\n\nYear W-L PPG FG% 3FG 10+ PPG guys\n\n2019-20 10-2 77.9 .467 117 4\n\n2018-19 8-4 84.8 .518 146 4\n\n2017-18 10-2 92.3 .521 134 3\n\n2016-17 12-0 89.8 .538 120 4\n\n2015-16 8-4 86.2 .497 109 4\n\n2014-15 9-3 73.3 .441 106 2\n\n2013-14 10-2 82.9 .492 136 2\n\n2012-13 11-1 78.9 .509 107 2\n\n2011-12 10-2 84.3 .506 111 2\n\n2010-11 8-4 67.3 .426 85 3\n\n2009-10 5-7 70.8 .447 98 1\n\n2008-09 10-2 76.9 .445 106 3\n\n2007-08 9-3 77.4 .468 100 2\n\n2006-07 8-4 68.0 .433 69 2\n\n2005-06 8-4 69.4 .414 86 3\n\n2004-05 9-3 68.7 .434 93 2\n\n2003-04 12-0 71.2 .467 75 1\n\n2002-03 11-1 83.8 .520 116 1\n\n2001-02 7-5 76.2 .451 71 3\n\n2000-01 10-2 75.8 .446 95 4\n\n1999-00 9-3 73.3 .459 96 2\n\n1998-99 10-2 76.2 .466 90 2\n\n1997-98 8-4 77.4 .473 88 2\n\n1996-97 5-7 65.4 .407 66 2\n\n1995-96 6-6 65.8 .389 69 2\n\n1994-95 5-7 65.0 .396 81 4\n\nI'll \"Half\" More Of That Please\n\nCreighton's 48-22 halftime lead vs. Nebraska marked the fourth time in NU's last eight meetings in Omaha that the Bluejays had led by 20 or more points at halftime.\n\nCreighton is 180-33 all-time under Greg McDermott when leading at halftime, and is 8-1 when up at halftime this winter.\n\nCU's Largest Halftime Leads Since 2000 vs. Nebraska\n\nDate City Half Score Final Score\n\n11/24/07 Omaha CU 47-20 (+27) CU 74-62\n\n12/08/13 Omaha CU 51-25 (+26) CU 82-67\n\n12/07/19 Omaha CU 48-22 (+26) CU 95-76\n\n12/11/05 Omaha CU 31-11 (+20) CU 70-44\n\n11/29/08 Lincoln CU 31-18 (+13) NU 54-52\n\n12/21/02 Lincoln CU 46-35 (+11) CU 81-73\n\n12/06/12 Lincoln CU 28-17 (+11) CU 64-42\n\n12/10/03 Omaha CU 33-23 (+10) CU 61-54\n\nHave A Half\n\nCreighton led 48-22 at halftime on Dec. 7 vs. Nebraska, which ranks as one of its largest halftime leads in the last 30 years.\n\nFour of Creighton's largest halftime leads this season have come in the past five games, as that figure has grown from 14 (Texas Tech) to 15 (Oral Roberts to 26 (Nebraska) before going to 21 vs. UTRGV.\n\nIt was the first time Creighton played four straight games with a halftime lead of 14+ points for the first time since Nov. 22-Dec. 6, 2003, which also happened to be the first four CU games in CHI Health Center Omaha history.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's largest halftime margins since 1990-91.

That includes CU's most points (3,150) and rebounds (1,087).\n\nIn fact, on December 12 NBCSports.com named McDermott as its National Player of the Decade.\n\nCreighton is currently 230-120 this decade, the most wins in any decade in program history. CU won 229 games from Jan. 1, 2000 - Dec. 31, 2009.\n\nA full list of Creighton's statistical leaders can be found on page 12 of these notes.\n\n100,00 Fans, Again\n\nWith 134,572 fans to date, this season marks the 18th straight season of 100,000 or more home fans for the program. The streak that started in the final season (2002-03) of the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton has led its conference in average home attendance each of the last 16 completed seasons, and is once again leading the way in the BIG EAST in 2019-20.\n\nNCAA Hosts\n\nCreighton will host the First and Second Round of the 2020 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at CHI Health Center Omaha on March 20 & 22.\n\nIt's the fifth time since 2008 that Omaha has been selected to host, joining 2008 (1st Weekend); 2012 (1st Weekend); 2015 (1st Weekend); 2018 (Regionals) and 2020 (1st Weekend).\n\nTaking out Dayton, which annually hosts the First Four, CHI Health Center Omaha will host more NCAA Tournament games from 2008-20 than any other venue. In addition, CHI Health Center Omaha will host five different years in that span, which trails only Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis from 2008-20.\n\nMost NCAA Tournament Games Hosted, 2008-20\n\nRk.

In the 1997-98 season, the award was named in honor of the legendary Oscar Robertson, \"The Big O.\" In addition, the USBWA selects an All-America team and All-District teams, players and coaches of the year.\n\nAlexander is averaging 16.3 points per game this season for Creighton, and tops the club with 6.3 rebounds per game. The Charlotte, N.C., native is shooting 42.7 percent from three-point range and 84.3 percent at the charity stripe. Alexander, who is also on the watch list for the Jerry West Award Shooting Guard of the Year and the John R. Wooden Award, was named a Preseason All-BIG EAST choice.\n\nAlexander is one of four BIG EAST players on the list, as he's joined by Markus Howard (Marquette), Myles Powell (Seton Hall) and Omer Yurtseven (Georgetown).\n\nCreighton's Doug McDermott took home the Oscar Robertson Trophy as men's national player of the year following the 2013-14 season.\n\nThe 2019-20 Oscar Robertson Trophy will be presented at the NCAA Final Four in Atlanta in April. The winner will be also be honored at the annual USBWA Awards Luncheon at the Missouri Athletic Club in St. Louis on Mon., April 13, 2020.\n\nWrecked 'Em\n\nBefore Creighton scored 83 points on Nov. 29, Texas Tech had allowed only one team to score more than 80 points since the start of last year -- 85 by Virginia in the 2019 NCAA Tournament title game.\n\nCreighton's 46 points in the first half tied the most by any TTU foe in a half since the start of last season, something only Kansas did (in Lawrence).\n\nCreighton's 51.7 percent shooting was the best by a Texas Tech opponent since Oklahoma State shot 52.2 percent on Feb. 21, 2018. The Red Raiders had played 53 games since then before facing CU.\n\nAnother One Bites The Dust\n\nThe Nov. 29 win vs. No. 12 Texas Tech marked the seventh straight season that Creighton has knocked off a top-25 opponent.\n\nCreighton is now 34-145 all-time against ranked teams, and 11-13 since the start of the 2016-17 season against ranked teams.\n\nGreg McDermott is 16-30 as Creighton coach against top-25 foes, more than twice as many top-25 wins as any other coach in program history. Prior to McDermott's arrival, Creighton was 18-115 all-time against top-25 foes.\n\nBouncing Back\n\nCreighton doesn't lose many games by 20 or more points, as it did on Nov. 28 vs. San Diego State. However, each of the last 12 times it has happened, Creighton has answered with a victory in its next game.\n\nThree of CU's last four losses by 20+ points were followed with a win over a ranked team.\n\nCreighton's Losses by 20+ Points Since 2000\n\nDate Loss by 20+ Points Next Game Result\n\n03/07/08 Illinois State 73, CU 49 03/18/09 CU 73, Bowling Green 71\n\n02/11/12 Wichita State 89, #17 CU 68 02/14/12 CU 88, Southern Illinois 69\n\n03/23/14 #23 Baylor 85, #16 CU 55 11/14/14 CU 104, Central Arkansas 77\n\n01/25/15 #4 Villanova 71, CU 50 01/28/15 CU 77, St. John's 74\n\n01/31/15 #21 Georgetown 67, CU 40 02/04/15 CU 79, Xavier 72 (OT)\n\n11/19/15 #14 Indiana 86, CU 65 11/23/15 CU 85, Rutgers 75\n\n02/03/16 #3 Villanova 83, CU 58 02/06/16 CU 88, DePaul 66\n\n01/25/17 Georgetown 71, #16 CU 51 01/28/17 #16 CU 83, DePaul 66\n\n01/13/18 #10 Xavier 92, #25 CU 70 01/17/18 CU 80, #19 Seton Hall 63\n\n02/01/18 #1 Villanova 98, CU 78 02/07/18 CU 76, DePaul 75\n\n02/20/18 Butler 93, CU 70 02/24/18 CU 89, #3 Villanova 83 (OT)\n\n11/28/19 San Diego State 83, CU 52 11/29/19 CU 83, #12 Texas Tech 76 (OT)\n\nOvertime Odds & Ends\n\nAfter going 1-3 last year in overtime, Creighton improved to 1-0 in overtime games this season with its Nov. 29 victory over No. 12 Texas Tech.\n\nCreighton has now won at least one overtime game in each of the past three seasons.\n\nThe team to score first in overtime has won 17 of Creighton's last 20 overtime games.\n\nCreighton is now 58-49 all-time games to go to overtime, including a 44-43 mark in single-overtime games.\n\nCreighton is now 5-5 in games to go to overtime at a neutral site.\n\nGreg McDermott improved to 8-5 as Creighton's coach in overtime contests and is 19-13 as a Division I head coach in overtime games.\n\nCreighton has played back-to-back overtime games just five times in school history, and just once in the last 25 years (Dec. 9 & 13, 2014).\n\nCreighton is now 4-11 all-time in overtime games against top-25 foes.\n\nLast year's team played four overtime games, tying the school record of four previously done in 1989-90 and again in 2001-02.\n\nMore information on Creighton's overtime history can be found on page 167 of the program's 2019-20 media guide.\n\nSophomore Scorers\n\nMarcus Zegarowski scored a career-high 32 points in the Nov. 29 victory over Texas Tech, becoming the latest Bluejay sophomore to pile up the points. He then added 30 points on Dec. 7 vs. Nebraska.\n\nEach of the last three Creighton players to score 30 or more points have done it as a sophomore. Besides Zegarowski vs. Texas Tech and Nebraska, Mitch Ballock had 39 points vs. DePaul last season, and Ty-Shon Alexander added 36 vs. No. 16 Clemson on Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nIn addition to Zegarowski, Ballock and Alexander, one other player on the Bluejay roster has scored 30 or more points. That player is Denzel Mahoney, who scored 30+ points twice as a sophomore at Southeast Missouri State in 2017-18, and once as a freshman in 2016-17 with the Redhawks.\n\nCreighton's last non-sophomore to score 30 points or more was then-senior Marcus Foster's 32 points vs. UT Arlington on Dec. 18, 2017.\n\nAmong The Nation's Best\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranks nationally since Greg McDermott was hired in 2010, per Basketball-Reference.com.\n\n2010-11 through Dec. 22, 2019\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\n3FG Made 2,911 2nd\n\n3FG Percentage .385 4th\n\nAssists 5,315 4th\n\nFG Percentage .481 5th\n\nFG Made 8,936 9th\n\nWins 217 31st\n\nWinning Percentage .662 35th\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 863 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. The streak is the nation's 17th-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (through 12/26)\n\nRk.

Bishop scored 10 points during CU's 20-2 run to open the second half.\n\nHe then had eight points, five rebounds and a career-high three assists at Michigan on Nov. 12.\n\nDuring CU's trip to Australia, Bishop averaged 15.7 points per game, including a 25-point outburst in CU's final contest vs. Bullets Invitational.\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nIncluding its Nov. 5 win over Kennesaw State, Creighton hasn't trailed in its home opener in 10 of the past 20 seasons (2000-01, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2016-17 and 2019-20).\n\nIn 284 games at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 79 of those contests, a staggering 27.8 percent of the time.\n\nUnder Greg McDermott at home, Creighton is\n\n137-32 and hasn't trailed in 54 of those games.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 80.99 points per home game (13,688 points in 169 home games), a figure that climbs to 84.92 points in non-conference home games (7,473 points in 88 home games).\n\nCreighton is 109-5 all-time at CHI Health Center Omaha when scoring 80 or points and had won 90 straight non-conference home games since Dec. 7, 1991 when scoring 80+ points before falling 103-92 to No. 1 Gonzaga on Dec. 1.\n\nNifty Fifty Leads To Postseason?\n\nCreighton shot 52.4 percent from the floor in its lid-lifter against Kennesaw State on Nov. 5.\n\nCreighton has made the postseason each of the last nine times in which it has made at least 50 percent of its field goal attempts to open the year, with seven of those postseason trips being NCAA Tournament berths. The last time that didn't hold true was 1991-92, when CU shot 51.0 percent in the opener but finished just 9-19.\n\nCreighton has shot 50 percent or better in six of its last eight season-openers.\n\nCU Season-Opener Field Goal Percentage 50+%\n\nSince 1993-94\n\nFG% Year Opponent Postseason\n\n.541 1997-98 UMKC NIT\n\n.524 1998-99 Towson State NCAA\n\n.569 2000-01 Western Illinois NCAA\n\n.594 2002-03 UT Arlington NCAA\n\n.500 2012-13 North Texas NCAA\n\n.556 2013-14 Alcorn State NCAA\n\n.528 2015-16 Texas Southern NIT\n\n.508 2016-17 UMKC NCAA\n\n.558 2017-18 Yale NCAA\n\n.524 2019-20 Kennesaw State ? ? ?\n\nAustralia Recap\n\nCreighton got a head start on the 2019-20 season with a trip to Australia from August 1-13. The Bluejays spent the majority of their time in Sydney, Cairns and the Gold Coast, and went 2-1 in three games while Down Under.\n\nFive men averaged in double-figures in CU's three games, led by Mitch Ballock (18.3 ppg.), Christian Bishop (15.7 ppg.) and Davion Mintz (13.3 ppg.).\n\nAmong the activities on the adventurous trip were climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge, SCUBA diving and snorkeling along the Great Barrier Reef, a visit to Hartley's Crocodile Farm, zip lining and a high ropes course at the Tree Top Challenge and whitewater rafting.\n\nFor photos, videos and diaries from the trip, visit https://gocreighton.com/JaysDownUnder.\n\nForeign Tours Lead To Early Success\n\nCreighton is coming off a trip to Australia in August, which it hopes will prepare the team for early victories as past trips have done.\n\nThis year's team is off to a 10-2 start after going to Australia in August.\n\nA 2015 trip to Italy helped the Bluejay start the season 5-1.\n\nA 2011 trip to the Bahamas helped get the Bluejays ready for a 7-0 start.\n\nA 2007 trip to Canada paid dividends as Creighton started 5-0.\n\nIn 2003, the Bluejays also went to Canada and started the subsequent season 12-0.\n\nWhere In The World Is Ty-Shon Alexander?\n\nBasketball took Ty-Shon Alexander all over the globe this summer.\n\nThe Charlotte, N.C., native stayed in Omaha for much of the summer before heading to the Chris Paul CP3 Elite Guard Camp in mid-July in Winston-Salem, N.C. Alexander then went to Providence, R.I., for USA Basketball training camp from July 21-26.\n\nThe team, which consisted solely current and former of BIG EAST players, then departed for Lima, Peru, where it played five games in five days from July 31-Aug. 4 and won the bronze medal.\n\nAlexander then boarded a plane in Lima and flew nine hours to Los Angeles, Calif., where he had about two hours to change terminals and get through customs to board a 15 hour flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia.\n\nUpon arriving in Sydney, the jet-lagged junior once again had to clear customs and met the Creighton team at the gate as it was boarding a three-hour flight to Cairns.\n\nNot surprisingly, minutes for a tired and travel-weary Alexander were closely monitored during the team's final two games in Australia.\n\nAlexander Gets Preseason Hype\n\nLeague coaches didn't give Ty-Shon Alexander anything more than Honorable Mention All-BIG EAST acclaim following last season, but don't tell that to the publishers of Street & Smith's.\n\nThe magazine named Alexander as a Preseason Second Team All-American in its annual basketball issue.\n\nAlexander was also named to the John R. Wooden Award Preseason Watch List, the Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award Watch List and was a Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST choice.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 20 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, none larger than the 18-point deficit the Bluejays overcame against then-No.18 Oklahoma on Nov. 19, 2014. Ten of those 20 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nCreighton's largest comeback to win in 2018-19 was a 12-point deficit it rallied from to defeat East Tennessee State on Nov. 11.\n\nCreighton owns 11 victories since 2000 in which it has won after overcoming a deficit of 15 points or more, as seen below:\n\nOvercoming Double-Digit Deficits, CU Since 2000\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n19 Wichita State 01/28/06\n\n18 #17 Western Kentucky 11/27/01\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 Missouri State 02/12/03\n\n17 DePaul 11/09/07\n\n17 Rhode Island 03/18/08\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 TCU 01/26/03\n\n16 at Drake 02/04/06\n\n16 New Mexico 11/16/08\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n15 Wichita State 02/02/08\n\nGetting Votes A Good Sign\n\nCreighton received four votes in the Associated Press preseason poll, good for 40th place.\n\nIt's the fifth time that Creighton has picked up votes in the preseason poll under Greg McDermott. Each of the first four times that's happened, the Bluejays would finish top three in the league, reach the finals of the conference tournament, and play in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPreseason Poll Votes Under Greg McDermott\n\nYear Preseason Rank League Finish NCAA's?\n\n2011-12 34th 2nd, MVC Yes\n\n2012-13 16th 1st, MVC Yes\n\n2013-14 27th 2nd, BIG EAST Yes\n\n2016-17 22nd T-3rd, BIG EAST Yes\n\n2019-20 40th TBD TBD\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked seventh in the preseason BIG EAST Conference poll that was selected via a vote of league coaches.\n\nSeton Hall edged Villanova by one point to be named league favorites for the first time since 1992-93, as both the Pirates and Wildcats garnered five first place votes.\n\nXavier was third, with Marquette and Providence tying for fourth place. Georgetown was tabbed sixth, just ahead of Creighton, while Butler, St. John's and DePaul round out the poll.\n\nSeton Hall standout Myles Powell was named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year, and was joined on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Team by Ty-Shon Alexander (Creighton), Kamar Baldwin (Butler), Alpha Diallo (Providence), Markus Howard (Marquette) and Naji Marshall (Xavier).\n\nCreighton has met or exceeded its preseason BIG EAST prognostication every year since joining the league, as seen below:\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Preseason Poll History\n\nYear Preseason Actual Preseason All-BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 3rd 2nd Doug McDermott (1st)\n\n2014-15 9th T-9th -\n\n2015-16 9th 6th -\n\n2016-17 3rd T-3rd Maurice Watson Jr. (1st); Marcus Foster (HM)\n\n2017-18 5th T-3rd Marcus Foster (1st); Khyri Thomas (HM)\n\n2018-19 9th T-3rd Martin Krampelj (HM)\n\n2019-20 7th TBD Ty-Shon Alexander (1st)\n\n#ProJays\n\nCreighton has five NBA players on NBA contracts as Kyle Korver (Milwaukee Bucks), Anthony Tolliver (Portland Trail Blazers), Doug McDermott (Indiana Pacers, Justin Patton (Oklahoma City Thunder) and Khyri Thomas (Detroit Pistons) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2019-20, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 36 of the last 37 years.\n\nKorver ranks fourth in NBA history with 2,393 three-pointers and is 10th in league history with 42.82 percent marksmanship from three-point range. He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10, and is the only player in league history to lead the NBA in three-point percentage four times. Korver is shooting 38.2 percent from three-point range this season and averages 6.2 points per game.\n\nTolliver is averaging 3.3 points and 2.9 rebounds per game this season for the Trail Blazers.\n\nMcDermott is in his sixth season in the NBA, and second with the Indiana Pacers. He is averaging 9.7 points and 3.0 rebounds per game this year while shooting 47.1 percent from three-point range (fifth-best in the NBA this season).\n\nPatton is on his fourth organization since being the 16th pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. He signed with the Thunder in August and has played in two games this season for OKC. He has also spent time with the OKC Blue in the G-League, where he plays for former Bluejay Grant Gibbs.\n\nThomas was the 38th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded minutes later to the Detroit Pistons. Thomas was a two-time BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year who has played in two games this winter for Detroit, but underwent foot surgery on Nov. 13th that will sideline him for six weeks.\n\nDowntown Duo\n\nCreighton is one of two schools that return a pair of players who each made 95 or more three-pointers at their current school last season, joining UTSA.\n\nCreighton's Ty-Shon Alexander drained 97 triples last year, two more than Mitch Ballock's 95.\n\nUTSA's dynamic duo includes Keaton Wallace (121) and Jhivvan Jackson (104).\n\nCreighton made a school-record 372 three-pointers a year ago, which ranked tied for fifth nationally.\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 19 of the previous 21 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 21 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas. Kentucky and Florida have done it in 20 of the last 21 seasons.\n\nCreighton and Syracuse each are in the 19-of-21 seasons club.\n\nMost 20-Win Seasons, Last 21 Years\n\nTeam 20-Win Seasons 2018-19 W-L\n\nGonzaga 21 33-4\n\nDuke 21 32-6\n\nKansas 21 26-10\n\nKentucky 20 30-7\n\nFlorida 20 20-16\n\nCreighton 19 20-15\n\nSyracuse 19 20-14\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 284 regular and postseason contests at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time in the 17-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 234-50 (.824) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Friday (19-0).\n\nCreighton's Nov. 25, 2017 win over SIU Edwardsville was the program's 200th at the facility, coming in its 242nd home game. CU's 100th win came on Nov. 17, 2010, a 63-58 win over Louisiana.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 22,182-18,609 in games at CHI Health Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.58 points per game. Creighton has not trailed 79 different times.\n\nCreighton is also 28-30 all-time in the 58 games at the arena in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 7-11 when down by 10+ points at halftime in the facility, and 35-25 when trailing at halftime at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 137-32 (.811) at CHI Health Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including an 82-6 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 253-50 (.835) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nFull House\n\nLast year Creighton averaged 15,980 fans per game at home, good for seventh place. The Jays average of 17,108 prior to the NIT would have placed the program sixth.\n\nIt's the 14th straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the eighth straight season in the top-10.\n\n2018-19 Attendance Leaders\n\nRk.
