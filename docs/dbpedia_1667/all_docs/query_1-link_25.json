        "text": "Here’s one of the funny things to me about ranking draft picks so far. The NBA has essentially been around for 73 years. In order to get this to the nice, round number of 70, I decided I wouldn’t include the BAA years. Those were the three seasons before the NBL and the BAA joined forces to form the NBA. In ranking the number one, number two, and number three picks over the past couple weeks, there were almost no consequences in doing so. I really didn’t cut out any big players in NBA history, so I felt really good about the decisions I made.\n\nThen came the number four picks. In 1948, Dolph Schayes was the fourth pick of the BAA Draft by the New York Knicks. He was also picked in the NBL Draft by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. The Blackhawks traded him to the Syracuse Nationals, which offered Schayes a lot more money than the Knicks did. He decided to play there. Over the next 15 years, Schayes had a Hall of Fame career. He spent 14 of those seasons with Syracuse before ending his career in Philadelphia. He was a champion, a 12-time All-Star, and a 12-time All-NBA selection.\n\nOther than cutting out one of the best players over the first 15 years of the NBA’s history, I feel pretty good about not ranking the BAA Draft selections. Here are links to the rest of the picks we’ve done so far.\n\nRanking No. 1 picks | Ranking No. 2 picks | Ranking No. 3 picks\n\nHere’s what will factor into the ranking of these fourth picks in NBA history:\n\nHow good was this guy? (For more recent picks/active players, how good do they project to be? And yes, I’m totally guessing with that.)\n\nWhat were their accolades during their careers?\n\nHow much did he bring to the franchise?\n\nDid they bring championships to that franchise?\n\nDid they ruin things for their franchise?\n\nStatistical accomplishments\n\nWas anybody better taken after them?\n\nAre these things all weighted differently? Yes, they are. Is this going to be subjective? Almost entirely! Also, we’re not counting the territorial picks that existed from 1949 until 1966 when the draft was reworked. And sometimes greatness as a top pick overall will outweigh whether or not they accomplished greater things for another franchise later on.\n\nLet’s dig into this week’s Power Rankings, which come in the form of ranking the 70 number four picks in NBA history. (I did not count the BAA years)\n\n1. Chris Paul, Wake Forest, New Orleans Hornets, 2005\n\nAccomplishments: Rookie of the Year, All-Rookie, All-Star (10x), All-Star Game MVP, All-Defense (1st team 7x, 2nd team 2x), All-NBA (1st team 4x, 2nd team 3x, 3rd team 1x)\n\nChris Paul is going to make the Hall of Fame. He has a great chance at finishing his career with the second most assists and steals in NBA history — both behind John Stockton. CP3 has been one of the best point guards of his generation and one of the best point guards of all-time. He has almost every accolade you could possibly want. However, he still hasn’t been to the NBA Finals, and he obviously doesn’t have a championship. A lot of people will hold that against him and some of the flameouts in the postseason have been rough. But we shouldn’t lose sight of the historic career CP3 has put together.\n\nTop three picks: Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee), Marvin Williams (Atlanta), Deron Williams (Utah)\n\nNotable picks after: Danny Granger (17), David Lee (30), Monta Ellis (40), Lou Williams (45)\n\n2. Dave Cowens, Florida State, Boston Celtics, 1970\n\nAccomplishments: Rookie of the Year, All-Rookie, All-Star (8x), All-Star MVP, All-Defense (1st team 1x, 2nd team 2x), All-NBA (2nd team 3x), MVP, Championship (2x), Hall of Fame\n\nThe 10-year run of Dave Cowens is pretty insane when it comes to his accomplishments. He helped John Havlicek tack on two more championships to his career, and was the driving force of that title team in 1976 when Boston beat Phoenix in the NBA Finals. Cowens led the Celtics in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in the 1977-78 season. He was the first player in NBA history to do that (mostly because blocks haven’t always been tracked officially). He ranks 10th all-time in minutes per game and ninth all-time in rebounds per game. He made a brief comeback in Milwaukee following a two-year retirement, but his run with the Celtics was legendary.\n\nTop three picks: Bob Lanier (Detroit), Rudy Tomjanovich (San Diego), Pete Maravich (Atlanta)\n\nNotable picks after: Calvin Murphy (18), Tiny Archibald (19)\n\n3. Russell Westbrook, UCLA, Seattle SuperSonics, 2008\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (9x), All-Star MVP (2x), All-NBA (1st team 2x, 2nd team 5x, 3rd team 1x), MVP\n\nFor decades, people wondered if anybody would ever average a triple-double for a season like Oscar Robertson did. Magic Johnson seemed like a candidate. LeBron James seemed like a candidate. But in the post-Kevin Durant era in Oklahoma City, Russell Westbrook became the guy to do it. And he did it three straight seasons. The first year he did it, he won the scoring title and MVP. But playoff success without Durant leading the way has escaped Westbrook and his many accolades. Now that he’s with James Harden for the time being, we’ll see where his career goes, but Westbrook is going to end up being one of the most polarizing players of his era.\n\nTop three picks: Derrick Rose (Chicago), Michael Beasley (Miami), OJ Mayo (Minnesota)\n\nNotable picks after: Kevin Love (5), Goran Dragic (45)\n\n4. Dikembe Mutombo, Georgetown, Denver Nuggets, 1991\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (8x), All-Defense (1st team 3x, 2nd team 3x), All-NBA (2nd team 1x, 3rd team 2x), Defensive Player of the Year (4x), Hall of Fame\n\nWho wants to rank Mutombo? Dikembe Mutombo had an unbelievable career, especially when you look at his defensive accolades and think about the other players in his era. He won four Defensive Player of the Year awards playing against guys like Alonzo Mourning, Hakeem Olajuwon, Gary Payton, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, and Patrick Ewing. Mutombo is 20th all-time in career rebounds. Only Hakeem Olajuwon officially blocked more shots than Mutombo. He helped engineer one of the most shocking 1-8 upsets in first-round history. Not to mention, every single interview with him has been delightful because of his voice.\n\nTop three picks: Larry Johnson (Charlotte), Kenny Anderson (New Jersey), Billy Owens (Sacramento)\n\nNotable picks after: Steve Smith (5)\n\n5. Chris Bosh, Georgia Tech, Toronto Raptors, 2003\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (11x), All-NBA (2nd team), Championship (2x)\n\nChris Bosh’s career was cut short by blood clots, and we were just beginning to see what it looked like for him to stretch his legs as a star player with championship understanding. He was a stat-producer in Toronto, who teamed up with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami. Until they won titles, he got hammered left and right by pundits and fans who didn’t understand the game enough to know how valuable he was. He helped modernize the NBA big man with small ball, and turned into one of the smartest defensive players in the league. He sacrificed All-NBA consideration to win titles. It would’ve been great to see what he could do in an extended stretch after LeBron went back to Cleveland.\n\nTop three picks: LeBron James (Cleveland), Darko Milicic (Detroit), Carmelo Anthony (Denver)\n\nNotable picks after: Dwyane Wade (5)\n\n6. Rasheed Wallace, North Carolina, Washington Bullets, 1995\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (4x), Championship\n\nBall don’t lie! Rasheed Wallace’s talent gets forgotten a bit because of a couple things. 1) It didn’t feel like he came close to maximizing his potential and 2) he played in an era of power forward titans. But talk to any of those guys (Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Webber, etc.) and they’ll always give an exhale before discussing just how good he was and tough he was to play against. He’s most remembered for the outbursts and the technical fouls, but his scoring ability and defensive excellence should be the story with him. When the Detroit Pistons acquired him in 2004, they became a championship team. They don’t beat the Lakers that year without him.\n\nTop three picks: Joe Smith (Golden State), Antonio McDyess (LA Clippers), Jerry Stackhouse (Philadelphia)\n\nNotable picks after: Kevin Garnett (5), Michael Finley (21)\n\n7. Lou Hudson, University of Minnesota, St. Louis Hawks, 1966\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (6x), All-NBA (2nd team)\n\nIn Lou Hudson’s second year in the NBA, he played just 46 games because he was called to serve in the military. When he came back to the NBA for the 1968-69 season, Hudson started lighting everybody up. It started a six-year run for Hudson in which he made the All-Star Game every single season and he averaged 25.2 points on 49.7 percent shooting from the field. He was a great athlete that could get almost any scoring opportunity he wanted in those days.\n\nTop three picks: Cazzie Russell (New York), Dave Bing (Detroit), Clyde Lee (San Francisco)\n\nNotable picks after: Jim Barnett (8)\n\n8. Glen Rice, Michigan, Miami Heat, 1989\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (3x), All-Star MVP, All-NBA (2nd team, 3rd team), Championship\n\nGlen Rice had a 15-year career and a good one at that. But from 1991 to 1998, he was torching opponents. He put up 22.2 points per game during that time with a 57.1 percent true shooting. His peak happened in 1996-97 when he put up 26.8 points with a league best 47.0 percent from deep. T0ward the end of his career, he was traded from Charlotte to the Lakers, and he helped Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal grab their first ring together. But by then, Rice wasn’t nearly the scorer we were used to seeing. He was lethal in Miami. He was even deadlier in Charlotte. Great career.\n\nTop three picks: Pervis Ellison (Sacramento), Danny Ferry (LA Clippers), Sean Elliott (San Antonio)\n\nNotable picks after: Tim Hardaway (14), Shawn Kemp (17), Vlade Divac (26), Clifford Robinson (36)\n\n9. Lamar Odom, Rhode Island, Los Angeles Clippers, 1999\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, Sixth Man of the Year, Championship (2x)\n\nOn some level, it felt like Lamar Odom was a bit of a disappointment. Mostly because he had the talent, size, and athleticism to be one of those Kevin Garnett or Chris Webber-esque do-it-all superstars. Maybe it was the difficult life he endured or maybe it was wasting his developmental NBA years with the Clippers, but he never quite found that level of stardom. However, finding his way to the Lakers helped turn him into a vital member of two championship teams. Odom was capable of taking over games with his scoring or his playmaking. He was someone Kobe Bryant trusted, and ultimately had a wildly successful career. But it felt like he was destined for a bit more.\n\nTop three picks: Elton Brand (Chicago), Steve Francis (Vancouver), Baron Davis (Charlotte)\n\nNotable picks after: Richard Hamilton (7), Shawn Marion (9), Ron Artest (16), Andrei Kirilenko (24), Manu Ginobili (57)\n\n10. Alvan Adams, Oklahoma, Phoenix Suns, 1975\n\nAccomplishments: Rookie of the Year, All-Rookie, All-Star\n\nThe big man from Oklahoma played 13 seasons in the NBA and he might have peaked in his rookie year. That’s not to say the rest of his career was bad, but Alvan Adams averaged 19.0 points (career-high), 9.1 rebounds (tied for second highest career year), and 5.6 assists (career-high) during that rookie campaign. He won Rookie of the Year and made his lone All-Star Game. His scoring and rebounding plummeted in the second half of his career, but Adams put up 16.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game over his first seven seasons.\n\nTop three picks: David Thompson (Atlanta), Dave Meyers (LA Lakers), Marvin Webster (Atlanta)\n\nNotable picks after: Daryl Dawkins (5), Gus Williams (20), World B. Free (23)\n\n11. Stephon Marbury, Georgia Tech, Milwaukee Bucks, 1996\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star (2x), All-NBA (3rd team 2x)\n\nIt felt like Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett were going to be the new tandem in the NBA that everybody feared moving forward. Instead, he let ego and max salary disparities between him and KG get to him. While his individual exploits never quite turned into much team success, he was pretty amazing to watch. His athleticism and power made him a cannonball at the point guard position. From 1998 to 2005, Marbury averaged 21.7 points and 8.3 assists per game over four different franchises. He’s also turned himself into quite the ambassador for the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nTop three picks: Allen Iverson (Philadelphia), Marcus Camby (Toronto), Shareef Abdur-Rahim (Vancouver)\n\nNotable picks after: Ray Allen (5), Kobe Bryant (13), Peja Stojakovic (14), Steve Nash (15), Jermaine O’Neal (17)\n\n12. Antawn Jamison, North Carolina, Toronto Raptors, 1998\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, Sixth Man of the Year, All-Star (2x)\n\nAn infamous draft night swap with the Golden State Warriors sent Vince Carter to Toronto and Antawn Jamison to The Bay. Carter ended up being the bigger star and the better pro, but Jamison was really good too. He dropped 51 points in back-to-back games early in his career, and he was often used as a scoring matchup advantage at the power forward position. He could score from everywhere. Jamison averaged over 20 points per game for two different franchises. He put up 20.2 each night in five seasons with the Warriors and 20.8 each night in six seasons with the Wizards. In his one year coming off the bench before it happened more late in his career, he won Sixth Man of the Year with Dallas. In his final season, he made it into the 20,000-point club for his career.\n\nTop three picks: Michael Olowokandi (LA Clippers), Mike Bibby (Vancouver), Raef LaFrentz (Denver)\n\nNotable picks after: Vince Carter (5), Dirk Nowitzki (9), Paul Pierce (10), Rashard Lewis (32)\n\n13. Byron Scott, Arizona State, San Diego Clippers, 1983\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, Championship (3x)\n\nByron Scott was an unbelievable running mate in the backcourt for Magic Johnson once Michael Cooper was no longer the guy on the wing. His best season happened in 1987-88 when he averaged 21.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 4.1 assists while helping the Lakers win another championship. Scott was a key Lakers contributor and starter until he got traded to the Pacers in 1993. By then, he wasn’t the scorer he used to be, but he was always a reliable shot-maker. Better players were taken after him, but the Lakers nailed it with this pick.\n\nTop three picks: Ralph Sampson (Houston), Steve Stipanovich (Indiana), Rodney McCray (Houston)\n\nNotable picks after: Dale Ellis (9), Jeff Malone (10), Derek Harper (11), Clyde Drexler (14), Doc Rivers (31)\n\n14. Dick Barnett, Tennessee State, Syracuse Nationals, 1959\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star, Championship (2x)\n\nIt took a few stops before Dick Barnett got to the New York Knicks, but that’s where he shined the most. Barnett started in Syracuse and then tried a year in the ABL before his contract was sold to the Lakers. Six years into his career, the Lakers traded him to the Knicks and that’s where he took off. Over his first four seasons with the Knicks, Barnett averaged 18.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game. In his fifth season in New York, he was the second leading scorer in the Knicks’s run to the championship. He won a second ring with them in 1973, but he barely played and wasn’t a factor. He only made one All-Star Game, but helping the Knicks win that ring put him in New York elite status for decades.\n\nTop three picks: Bob Boozer (Cincinnati), Bailey Howell (Detroit), Tom Hawkins (Minneapolis)\n\nNotable picks after: Johnny Green (5)\n\n15. Jerry Sloan, Evansville, Baltimore Bullets, 1965\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star (2x), All-Defense (1st team 4x, 2nd team 2x), Hall of Fame\n\nLong before Jerry Sloan became a Hall of Fame coach, he was an excellent defender on the wing and a player starring for the Chicago Bulls. Their deepest playoff run happened with the Bulls losing in the Western Conference Finals (yes, Western) in a Game 7 to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the title in the next round. Sloan put up 14 points and 11 rebounds in that Game 7, but the Bulls couldn’t overcome a 6-of-26 shooting performance by Bob Love. Still, Sloan had a really good career after leaving Baltimore for Chicago in the expansion draft. Sloan had a five-year stretch averaging 16.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 3.0 assists for Chicago. He still made two of his All-Defense First Team selections after that stretch.\n\nTop three picks: Fred Hetzel (San Francisco), Rick Barry (San Francisco), Dave Stallworth (New York)\n\nNotable picks after: Billy Cunningham (5), Dick Van Arsdale (10), Tom Van Arsdale (11), Bob Love (33)\n\n16. Kristaps Porzingis, Latvia, New York Knicks, 2015\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star\n\nKristaps Porzingis looked like the savior of the New York Knicks after fans booed his selection on draft night. Then he tore his ACL in an All-Star season, and found a way out of the Knicks organization. Now he’s working his way back alongside Luka Doncic in Dallas, and it looks like he could end up being a big reason this Mavericks team is impossible to stop on offense. His ability to stretch the floor and protect the rim is really good, but he still needs to be more reliable in all facets of his game. It’s probably a good thing for him he got away from the Knicks.\n\nTop three picks: Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota), D’Angelo Russell (LA Lakers), Jahlil Okafor (Philadelphia)\n\nNotable picks after: Devin Booker (13)\n\n17. Mike Conley, Ohio State, Memphis Grizzlies, 2007\n\nAccomplishments: All-Defense (2nd team)\n\nIn terms of accolades, Mike Conley comes up short. Most people will remember that he briefly held the biggest contract in NBA history during the salary spike of 2016 when he signed for $153 million over five years. Conley has been one of the best point guards in the middle of the floor for the past few years (when healthy), and he’s been a great defensive option at the position. Nobody foresaw Conley outperforming his high school and college teammate Greg Oden when they were drafted in 2007, but he’s carved out a really good career for himself. Not just at the bank.\n\nTop three picks: Greg Oden (Portland), Kevin Durant (Seattle), Al Horford (Atlanta)\n\nNotable picks after: Marc Gasol (48)\n\n18. Jamal Mashburn, Kentucky, Dallas Mavericks, 1993\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star, All-NBA (3rd team)\n\nBy his second season in the NBA, Jamal Mashburn was putting up 24 points every night. The Dallas Mavericks had the super promising core of Jason Kidd, Jim Jackson and Mashburn. Most people would have predicted this to be the team of the future. But then we had a locker room torn up by a R&B singer and Mashburn’s body started to fail him. He played just 18 games his third season and was traded to Miami halfway through his fourth season. After a few seasons in Miami, Mash found his way to the Hornets. In his second-to-last season, he put up 21.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 5.6 assists to make All-NBA Third Team. He also made the All-Star Game that season. But his knee rebelled against him the next season. He had micro-fracture surgery in the 04-05 season and never played again. But he was one of the biggest matchup problems in the league for a few years when he was healthy.\n\nTop three picks: Chris Webber (Orlando), Shawn Bradley (Philadelphia), Anfernee Hardaway (Golden State)\n\nNotable picks after: Allan Houston (11), Sam Cassell (24), Nick Van Exel (37)\n\n19. Micheal Ray Richardson, Montana, New York Knicks, 1978\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star (4x), All-Defense (1st Team 2x)\n\nDrugs cut the NBA career of Micheal Ray Richardson short when the NBA suspended him for a couple years in 1986. By the time he was reinstated, he decided to play overseas and not return to the NBA. So we only got eight years of MRR reeking havoc on the league. In those eight years, Richardson could really score, set up teammates, and take the ball away from opponents. He led the NBA in steals three times in eight years. His 2.6 steals per game average ranks second all-time. The full season he played before the suspension, Richardson averaged 20.1 points, 8.2 assists, and 3.0 steals. Magic Johnson is the only other player in NBA history to put up 20-8-3 for a season like that.\n\nTop three picks: Mychal Thompson (Portland), Phil Ford (Kansas City), Rick Robey (Indiana)\n\nNotable picks after: Larry Bird (6), Reggie Theus (9), Maurice Cheeks (36), Michael Cooper (60)\n\n20. Jaren Jackson Jr, Michigan State, Memphis Grizzlies, 2018\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nAfter this potential NBA eight-game warm-up in Orlando, Jaren Jackson Jr played in all eight games would put him at 120 games played in two seasons. Unfortunately, health and a pandemic have cut a couple of seasons short for him. But when he plays, JJJ looks like a prototypical big man of the future. He’s a threat to stretch the floor. Jackson has incredible timing on blocking shots. He can move his feet well on the perimeter. He’s not much of a rebounder, but that’s really his only fault. The Grizzlies absolutely found their Marc Gasol replacement on the first try.\n\nTop three picks: Deandre Ayton (Phoenix), Marvin Bagley III (Sacramento), Luka Doncic (Atlanta)\n\nNotable picks after: Trae Young (5), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)\n\n21. Sam Perkins, North Carolina, Dallas Mavericks, 1984\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nSam Perkins was a fine pro with a long career. But being taken one spot ahead of Charles Barkley definitely hurts his stock here. Perkins was pretty emblematic of how big men and perimeter shooter were viewed, and the change that occurred during these times. In his first 8.5 seasons, Perkins took 381 3-pointers and made just 24.9 percent of them. It came during a time when the 3-point shot was mostly just thought of as a gimmick. Once he was traded to Seattle in his ninth season, Perkins all of a sudden became a threat. Over his next 8.5 seasons, Perkins took 1,967 3-pointers and made 38.3 percent of them. Some of that came during the shortened 3-point line era, but he was now primarily a floor-spacing big man.\n\nTop three picks: Akeem Olajuwon (Houston), Sam Bowie (Portland), Michael Jordan (Chicago)\n\nNotable picks after: Charles Barkley (5), John Stockton (16)\n\n22. Chuck Person, Auburn, Indiana Pacers, 1986\n\nAccomplishments: Rookie of the Year, All-Rookie\n\nThe Rifleman! Chuck Person was a gunner, a scorer, and a trash-talker. His first six seasons in the NBA saw him as a lethal scorer for the Indiana Pacers. He could drop 40 on an opponent in the blink of an eye. And he’d let you know about it. One of the most fun first-round series of that era happened between a boisterous Chuck Person and an aging Larry Bird. But they talked smack to each other and battled for five games. After his time with the Pacers, Person was mostly a gunner off the bench for teams. When he retired in 2000, he was seventh all-time in 3-pointers made. Until 2015-16, he held the record for most 3-point makes off the bench for a season. Mirza Teletovic eventually broke it.\n\nTop three picks: Brad Daugherty (Cleveland), Len Bias (Boston), Chris Washburn (Golden State)\n\nNotable picks after: Ron Harper (8), Mark Price (25), Dennis Rodman (27), Jeff Hornacek (46), Drazen Petrovic (60)\n\n23. Xavier McDaniel, Wichita State, Seattle SuperSonics, 1985\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star\n\nXavier McDaniel, as a member of the Seattle SuperSonics, was a monster on the court. He was a tough guy and that’s how a lot of people remember him. They recall him going forehead to forehead with Michael Jordan in a playoff game. But his Sonics days preceded that and he had a four-year stretch with 21.6 points and 6.8 rebounds averages while making 49.6 percent of his shots. He had brief stops in Phoenix and New York before he signed with the Celtics in 1992. X-Man was more enforcer by then than scorer, but he was a fun role player.\n\nTop three picks: Patrick Ewing (New York), Wayman Tisdale (Indiana), Benoit Benjamin (LA Clippers)\n\nNotable picks after: Chris Mullin (7), Detlef Schrempf (8), Charles Oakley (9), Karl Malone (13), Joe Dumars (18), Terry Porter (24)\n\n24. Aaron Gordon, Arizona, Orlando Magic, 2014\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nWe are still waiting for Aaron Gordon to turn into an outside shooter and open up his offensive game, but his high-flying ways and defensive capabilities have turned him into a very valuable member of the Orlando Magic. Gordon has turned into pretty good passer and initiator under Steve Clifford. However, his scoring has regressed and he’s dealt with injuries a couple times in his career. People mostly remember him for losing dunk contests and then saying he got robbed. Maybe he did get robbed by Dwyane Wade, but I think Magic fans would rather he become remembered for production in real games.\n\nTop three picks: Andrew Wiggins (Cleveland), Jabari Parker (Milwaukee), Joel Embiid (Philadelphia)\n\nNotable picks after: Nikola Jokic (41)\n\n25. Tristan Thompson, Texas, Cleveland Cavaliers, 2011\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, Championship\n\nI wonder what we would feel about Tristan Thompson if Cleveland never makes the most incredible comeback in NBA Finals history. He’s a great rebounder, and one of the best offensive rebounders of his generation. He turned himself into a very valuable defender, especially in the pick-and-roll. We’re about to see the next era of his career as he hits free agency in the offseason. But Thompson never looked like a franchise big man. Should he have developed into one? Maybe? Already having Kyrie Irving on Cleveland from that same draft lessens the necessity for the Cavs to get great things from Thompson. But then again, he did help them win a title in 2016. He more than gave them their return on investment, and he was a lot better than the two guys taken directly ahead of him.\n\nTop three picks: Kyrie Irving (Cleveland), Derrick Williams (Minnesota), Enes Kanter (Utah)\n\nNotable picks after: Kemba Walker (9), Klay Thompson (11), Kawhi Leonard (15), Jimmy Butler (30), Isaiah Thomas (60)\n\n26. Shaun Livingston, Peoria Central High School, Los Angeles Clippers, 2004\n\nAccomplishments: Championship (3x)\n\nHe was supposed to be the next Magic Johnson or Anfernee Hardaway. A tall point guard who could figure out how to dominate the game with his skills and size at the position. Then in his third season, as he was gaining traction and improving, Livingston had arguably the most horrific knee injury in basketball history. Over the next 3.5 seasons, Livingston played in just 48 games for four different teams. From 2010-2014, Livingston found his footing with Charlotte, Milwaukee, Washington, Cleveland, and Brooklyn. Then in 2014, he found his way to the Warriors and became a key contributor off the bench, winning three championships. He’s the poster athlete for perseverance in the NBA and just retired after an inspiring career.\n\nTop three picks: Dwight Howard (Orlando), Emeka Okafor (Charlotte), Ben Gordon (Chicago)\n\nNotable picks after: Andre Iguodala (9)\n\n27. Jim Jackson, Ohio State, Dallas Mavericks, 1992\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nIn his third season, Jim Jackson was putting up over 25 points per game for the Dallas Mavericks before an ankle injury took him down. Less than two years later, rumors about a love triangle involving Jackson, Jason Kidd, and Toni Braxton grew pretty loud and Jackson was eventually traded to New Jersey. It started a vagabond career for Jackson, as he played for 11 teams over the next 10 seasons. That’s 12 teams total for Jackson, and he only managed to clear 100 games played for Dallas at the beginning of his career and Houston at the end. Everything else was a quick stop in each spot. He was traded seven different times in his career and never came close to that Dallas production.\n\nTop three picks: Shaquille O’Neal (Orlando), Alonzo Mourning (Charlotte), Christian Laettner (Minnesota)\n\nNotable picks after: LaPhonso Ellis (5), Tom Gugliotta (6), Latrell Sprewell (24)\n\n28. Tyreke Evans, University of Memphis, Sacramento Kings, 2009\n\nAccomplishments: Rookie of the Year, All-Rookie\n\nReke Havoc! That was the battle cry of everybody in Sacramento during the historic Rookie of the Year season for Tyreke Evans. He averaged 20-5-5, joining LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies in NBA history to put up 20-5-5 each night. Then… regression hit hard. Some of it came because of injuries, including a pretty debilitating plantar fasciitis. Some of the regression hit because he ignored the left side of the floor when he ran a pick-and-roll. Once teams figured out how to stay in front of him, he was pretty neutralized and he started to become pretty ordinary. He still has a 15.7 points per game scoring average for his career, but he’s suspended until 2021 due to violating the anti-drug policy of the NBA.\n\nTop three picks: Blake Griffin (LA Clippers), Hasheem Thabeet (Memphis), James Harden (Oklahoma City)\n\nNotable picks after: Steph Curry (7), DeMar DeRozan (9)\n\n29. Greg Ballard, Oregon, Washington Bullets, 1977\n\nAccomplishments: Championship\n\nIn Greg Ballard’s rookie season, he was a small part of the Washington Bullets team that captured the NBA championship. The next season, he was on the Bulls team that lost in the NBA Finals to Seattle, but they still made it. He must have thought this league was simple. After that, he never made a deep playoff run again. He turned into a guy who dropped 18 points per game in back-to-back seasons, but didn’t have a lot of team success. After getting traded to Golden State in 1985, Ballard spent three seasons in The Bay, but didn’t play at all in his last season there. He played two games in Seattle in 1988-89 on a 10-day deal, but that was the end of his career.\n\nTop three picks: Kent Benson (Milwaukee), Otis Birdsong (Kansas City), Marques Johnson (Milwaukee)\n\nNotable picks after: Walter Davis (5), Bernard King (7), Jack Sikma (8), Cedric Maxwell (12), Norm Nixon (22), James Edwards (46), Eddie Johnson (49)\n\n30. Dennis Scott, Georgia Tech, Orlando Magic, 1990\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nDennis Scott was one of the best sharpshooters of his era, and when he retired in 2000, he ranked ninth all-time in 3-pointers made. Granted, teams hadn’t been taking the 3-pointer seriously for all that long by the turn of the millennium, but 3D was one of the best. He shot just under 40 percent for his career from deep (39.7), and he set the single-season record for 3-pointers made in 1996 with 267. That number still ranks 13th all-time in single-season makes and only six players have bested that total. However, it also happened during a three-year stretch when the league moved the 3-point line in. Still, Scott was one of the best perimeter threats of the ’90s while mostly playing for the Magic.\n\nTop three picks: Derrick Coleman (New Jersey), Gary Payton (Seattle), Chris Jackson (Denver)\n\nNotable picks after: Elden Campbell (27), Toni Kukoc (29), Antonio Davis (45)\n\n31. Tom Boerwinkle, Tennessee, Chicago Bulls, 1968\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nTom Boerwinkle was a great rebounder and a great passing big man for the Chicago Bulls in the 1970s. He did a lot to set up Bob Love and Chet Walker. However, his decade-long career didn’t look incredibly remarkable by any means. He was just a good big man, and sometimes that’s all you can ask out of a high pick.\n\nTop three picks: Elvin Hayes (San Diego), Wes Unseld (Baltimore), Bob Kauffman (Seattle)\n\nNotable picks after: Don Chaney (12)\n\n32. Antonio Daniels, Bowling Green, Vancouver Grizzlies, 1997\n\nAccomplishments: Championship\n\nAntonio Daniels spent roughly a quarter of his career coming off the bench, but he was one of the better veteran presences a team could have in those second units for a long time. He was rescued from the Vancouver Grizzlies right after his rookie season, and he helped the San Antonio Spurs win their first NBA championship in 1999. But the offseason before their second title in 2003, he was sent to Portland. Daniels was a strong point guard with springs in his legs.\n\nTop three picks: Tim Duncan (San Antonio), Keith Van Horn (Philadelphia), Chauncey Billups (Boston)\n\nNotable picks after: Tracy McGrady (9)\n\n33. John Shumate, Notre Dame, Phoenix Suns, 1974\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nJohn Shumate could have had a much better career, but he battled blood clots and lung ailments from the beginning of his time in the NBA. He sat out his true rookie season because of a blood clot in his lung, then came in and made All-Rookie by averaging 11.7 points for Phoenix and Buffalo (traded in-season). He spent seven seasons in the NBA but only managed to play five of those. He played for six different teams before retiring.\n\nTop three picks: Bill Walton (Portland), Marvin Barnes (Philadelphia), Tom Burleson (Seattle)\n\nNotable picks after: Scott Wedman (6), Jamaal Wilkes (11), Maurice Lucas (14), George Gervin (40)\n\n34. Chris Morris, Auburn, New Jersey Nets, 1988\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nGoing one spot ahead of Hall of Famer Mitch Richmond is tough for Chris Morris in these rankings. He had a solid career, but the New Jersey Nets absolutely could have used Richmond’s scoring prowess more than reliable production from Morris. He’d give you double digits in scoring, but he didn’t exactly take games over for the Nets. He signed with the Utah Jazz in 1995 and made a couple of NBA Finals as a bit role player for them in 1997 and 1998. But Morris was mostly just a nice role player who never quite looked like the scorer we saw in that senior year at Auburn.\n\nTop three picks: Danny Manning (LA Clippers), Rik Smits (Indiana), Charles Smith (Philadelphia)\n\nNotable picks after: Mitch Richmond (5), Rod Strickland (19)\n\n35. Cody Zeller, Indiana University, Charlotte Bobcats, 2013\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nObligatory mention that Giannis and Gobert were not projected to be anything close to what they developed into. Now that we got that out of the way, Cody Zeller has actually been a relatively valuable member of the Hornets in his tenure. I’m just not sure if that’s because he’s pretty good or because the rest of the options for Charlotte are that bad. He’s had some injury issues over the past couple seasons, but Zeller is a mobile big man who can play in just about any NBA rotation. He’s the definition of a solid big in the modern game.\n\nTop three picks: Anthony Bennett (Cleveland), Victor Oladipo (Orlando), Otto Porter (Washington)\n\nNotable picks after: CJ McCollum (10), Steven Adams (12), Giannis Antetokounmpo (15), Rudy Gobert (27)\n\n36. De’Andre Hunter, Virginia, Los Angeles Lakers, 2019\n\nAccomplishments: Nothing official yet\n\nLike most people, I’m not quite sure what to think with De’Andre Hunter, but I do like him as a nice role player for a long time. He’s about a league average 3-point shooter after a year in the NBA, and he can defend even for a rookie. He has good size and he’s not going to take away from what the Hawks want to do on offense. Defensively, they’ll need to join him in becoming serious about that end of the floor. But Hunter looks like a solid pick for Atlanta in the draft night wheeling and dealing.\n\nTop three picks: Zion Williamson (New Orleans), Ja Morant (Memphis), RJ Barrett (New York)\n\nNotable picks after: Rui Hachimura (9), Tyler Herro (13)\n\n37. Donyell Marshall, Connecticut, Minnesota Timberwolves, 1994\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nNine teams in 15 seasons for Donyell Marshall in the NBA. He had good runs with Toronto, Golden State and Utah. His most famous accomplishment in the NBA is probably holding the 3-pointers made in a game record for a while. Kobe Bryant set the record in 2003 and Marshall tied it in 2005. That record stood for almost 11 years until Steph Curry tied it in early 2016 and broke it in late 2016. Marshall was a pretty good rebounder and a great floor-stretcher to the corners. He was on the Cavs team that miraculously made the Finals in 2007. Marshall was the first jersey I ever got when he was a rookie on the Minnesota Timberwolves. 12-year old me was so excited. He got traded to the Warriors 40 games later.\n\nTop three picks: Glenn Robinson (Milwaukee), Jason Kidd (Dallas), Grant Hill (Detroit)\n\nNotable picks after: Juwan Howard (5), Eddie Jones (10), Jalen Rose (13)\n\n38. Kenny Sears, Santa Clara, New York Knicks, 1955\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star (2x)\n\nKenny Sears played eight years in the NBA and he had a three-year run from 1957 to 1960 in which he averaged 19.4 points and 11.2 rebounds. Both of his All-Star selections happened during that three-year stretch. He also led the league in field goal percentage twice with 49.0 percent and 47.7 percent, respectively. This is back when guys would regularly shoot in the high 30s and be considered great, so they must have thought 49.0 percent from the field was the stuff of warlocks.\n\nTop three picks: Dick Ricketts (St. Louis), Maurice Stokes (Rochester), Jim Loscutoff (Boston)\n\nNotable picks after: Jack Twyman (8)\n\n39. Eddie Miles, Seattle University, Detroit Pistons, 1963\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star\n\nPerhaps, you’ve heard “The Man with the Golden Arm” when Miami Heat play-by-play announcer Eric Reid celebrated a Wayne Ellington 3-pointer. Well, Eddie Miles was the original “Man with the Golden Arm” in the NBA. His third season in the NBA was his best and most celebrated year, when averaging 19.6 points per game earned Miles an All-Star selection for the combo guard. But 6.5 of his nine years in the NBA occurred with Detroit, so he rarely got chances to use his shooting prowess in the playoffs. He only made three appearances and one of those happened with the Pistons. He did have a three-year run in which he averaged 18.5 points per game.\n\nTop three picks: Art Heyman (New York), Rod Thorn (Baltimore), Nate Thurmond (San Francisco)\n\nNotable picks after: Gus Johnson (10)\n\n40. Luke Jackson, University of Texas-Pan American, Philadelphia 76ers, 1964\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie, All-Star, Championship\n\nNot that Luke Jackson that you’re remembering from Oregon. This is the original Luke Jackson. Well, not the first one ever probably, but the first one ever in the NBA. This Luke Jackson made the All-Star Game his rookie season, won an NBA championship with Wilt Chamberlain his third season, and played eight pretty productive years in the NBA. It was that title-winning 76ers team that broke the Boston Celtics’ streak of eight straight championships.\n\nTop three picks: Jim Barnes (New York), Joe Caldwell (Detroit), Gary Bradds (Baltimore)\n\nNotable picks after: Jeff Mullins (5), Mel Counts (7), Willis Reed (8), Paul Silas (10)\n\n41. Len Chappell, Wake Forest, Syracuse Nationals, 1962\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star\n\nLen Chappell played in the final season in Syracuse, before the franchise became the Philadelphia 76ers. Then one game into his second season, the New York Knicks purchased his contract. In 78 games with the Knicks that season, he put up 17.3 points and 9.8 rebounds, earning his only All-Star selection. Chappell lasted nine seasons in the NBA, playing for a total of eight teams. None of his stops were as productive as his time with the Knicks. He also played one season in the ABA before retiring in his early 30s.\n\nTop three picks: Bill McGill (Chicago), Paul Hogue (New York), Zelmo Beaty (St. Louis)\n\nNotable picks after: John Havlicek (8), Chet Walker (12), Don Nelson (17)\n\n42. Drew Gooden, Kansas, Memphis Grizzlies, 2002\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nDrew Gooden played 14 years in the NBA and he was on 11 different teams during that time. He even got traded halfway through his rookie season. He was traded six different times. His best season also happened to be his first season with LeBron James in 2004-05. He put up 14.4 points and 9.2 rebounds per game. Two years later, he was a member of the Eastern Conference champs LeBron dragged to the Finals. He was just a solid big man who played nearly 800 regular season games for his career and he started most of the games he played in. We’ll probably remember him for the weird hair square he kept at the base of his head for a short time.\n\nTop three picks: Yao Ming (Houston), Jay Williams (Chicago), Mike Dunleavy (Golden State)\n\nNotable picks after: Amar’e Stoudemire (9), Tayshaun Prince (23)\n\n43. Ray Scott, University of Portland, Detroit Pistons, 1961\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nRay Scott spent nine years in the NBA with most of his time coming with Detroit before he was traded to Baltimore. Instead of playing for the Buffalo Braves after the expansion draft in 1970, Scott made his way to the ABA for a couple seasons. Scott was regarded as a great shooting big man from the perimeter, but he also shot 40.5 percent from the field for his career. This was before the 3-point line so maybe he just missed a bunch of layups? Scott averaged 14.9 points and 10.5 rebounds for his career.\n\nTop three picks: Walt Bellamy (Chicago), Tom Stith (New York), Larry Siegfried (Cincinnati)\n\nNotable picks after: Tom Meschery (7)\n\n44. Reggie Williams, Georgetown, Los Angeles Clippers, 1987\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nReggie “Silk” Williams lasted 10 years in the NBA before retiring in 1997. He spent two seasons and a week with the Los Angeles Clippers before they traded him with Danny Ferry (who was holding out as a rookie) to Cleveland for Ron Harper and picks. Williams played for three different teams that season. Five games with the Clippers before they traded him. Then he was waived in February by the Cavs before signing with San Antonio the rest of the season. Most of his time in the NBA came with Denver, where he actually averaged 18.2 points and 17.0 points, respectively, in his first two full seasons there. Scottie Pippen going right after him is rough for the Clippers’ draft history.\n\nTop three picks: David Robinson (San Antonio), Armen Gilliam (Phoenix), Dennis Hopson (New Jersey)\n\nNotable picks after: Scottie Pippen (5), Kevin Johnson (7), Reggie Miller (11), Mark Jackson (18)\n\n45. Kelvin Ransey, Ohio State, Chicago Bulls, 1980\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nKelvin Ransey came out of the NBA gates scoring pretty well. He was traded to Portland on draft night, where he spent his first two seasons averaging 15.6 points and 7.0 assists. Then Portland traded him to Dallas for Wayne Cooper and the pick that would become Terry Porter. A year later, Dallas traded him to New Jersey for Foots Walker and the pick that would become Bill Wennington. I just wanted to type out “Foots Walker” here. Ransey retired after three declining seasons wit the Nets to become a preacher.\n\nTop three picks: Joe Barry Carroll (Golden State), Darrell Griffith (Utah), Kevin McHale (Boston)\n\nNotable picks after: Kiki Vandeweghe (11)\n\n46. Dion Waiters, Syracuse, Cleveland Cavaliers, 2012\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nThe Dion Waiters selection at 4 in 2012 was confusing then. He got a promise early on from Cleveland and we never heard much about his draft stock after that. He knew he was locked in. Everything ultimately ended up working out for Cleveland because LeBron James came back and gave them a title, but Waiters was one of many drafting/personnel mistakes they made during this stretch. He had a brief revival with Miami, earning himself a big contract, but ultimately Waiters has proven to be a disappointing Syracuse product. Or maybe it’s unfair to say disappointing considering most were confused why he was taken there in the first place.\n\nTop three picks: Anthony Davis (New Orleans), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (Charlotte), Bradley Beal (Washington)\n\nNotable picks after: Damian Lillard (6), Andre Drummond (9), Draymond Green (35), Khris Middleton (39)\n\n47. Eddy Curry, Thornwood High School, Chicago Bulls, 2001\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nIt’s safe to say Eddy Curry ended up as a bust in the NBA. He started out making pretty solid progress through his first four seasons, before an irregular heartbeat ended his fourth year. He refused to submit DNA tests to determine if he had a congenital heart condition, so the Bulls traded him to the Knicks in a sign-and-trade for six years and $60 million. This was back when Isiah Thomas was trying to acquire all of the bad contracts in the league. In 2006-07, Curry set a career-high with 19.6 points per game. The next season, he was out of shape and ended up playing 85 games over the next six seasons in the NBA.\n\nTop three picks: Kwame Brown (Washington), Tyson Chandler (LA Clippes), Pau Gasol (Atlanta)\n\nNotable picks after: Jason Richardson (5), Joe Johnson (10), Richard Jefferson (13), Zach Randolph (19), Tony Parker (28), Gilbert Arenas (31)\n\n48. Wesley Johnson, Syracuse, Minnesota Timberwolves, 2010\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nFor some reason, Wesley Johnson was a higher rated prospect as a wing than Gordon Hayward and Paul George. And whether or not it would have worked out, grabbing him instead of DeMarcus Cousins to pair next to Kevin Love was also a curious David Kahn decision. One of many. He’s roughly three years older than George and Hayward. He had one good season of shooting in college, and he defended in that Jim Boeheim 2-3 zone. After two mediocre seasons in Minnesota, he was moved to Phoenix in a salary dump. He kicked around with the Lakers and Clippers for the next five seasons. But ultimately, he was a defender who wasn’t that good at defense, and a shooter who is 33.7 percent from deep for his career. Hayward and George ended up… better.\n\nTop three picks: John Wall (Washington), Evan Turner (Philadelphia), Derrick Favors (New Jersey)\n\nNotable picks after: DeMarcus Cousins (5), Gordon Hayward (9), Paul George (10)\n\n49. Al Wood, North Carolina, Atlanta Hawks, 1981\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nIt was only 19 games into his NBA career before Al Wood was traded to the San Diego Clippers. The Hawks passed on Tom Chambers to get Wood, then traded him to the Clippers where he teamed up with Chambers. Eventually, they’d be traded to Seattle together, where Wood had his most productive seasons — averaging 13.7 points on 47 percent shooting. Injuries and battles with alcohol ended his career early, but he could really shoot.\n\nTop three picks: Mark Aguirre (Dallas), Isiah Thomas (Detroit), Buck Williams (New Jersey)\n\nNotable picks after: Tom Chambers (8), Rolando Blackman (9), Larry Nance (20), Eddie Johnson (29)\n\n50. Leon Douglas, Alabama, Detroit Pistons, 1976\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nSome real heat was drafted after Leon Douglas in 1976, which knocks him down in these rankings. He had a decent career, appearing in over 450 games. His production for the Pistons definitely outperformed what he did for Kansas City, after he signed there. Detroit received draft pick compensation for him going to the Kings, which ended up being Kelly Tripucka. The Pistons eventually traded Tripucka for Adrian Dantley.\n\nTop three picks: John Lucas (Houston), Scott May (Chicago), Richard Washington (Kansas City)\n\nNotable picks after: Adrian Dantley (6), Robert Parish (8), Alex English (23), Dennis Johnson (29)\n\n51. Tyrus Thomas, Louisiana State, Portland Trail Blazers, 2006\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nTyrus Thomas was a one-and-done player, who surprised a lot of people in his freshman season at LSU. He could jump out of the gym, but he was just a three-star recruit coming out of high school. Then he rocked the rim on both ends of the floor on a great Tigers team. He turned it into the fourth selection in the 2006 draft, getting traded to the Bulls for LaMarcus Aldridge on draft night. After that? He was trending in the right direction before a broken forearm in his fourth season led to him losing his starting job to rookie Taj Gibson. He was traded to Charlotte, who amnestied him three years later. That was about it for a guy who made nearly $50 million based on two huge tournament performances against Duke and Texas in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nTop three picks: Andrea Bargnani (Toronto), LaMarcus Aldridge (Chicago), Adam Morrison (Charlotte)\n\nNotable picks after: Brandon Roy (6), Rudy Gay (8), Rajon Rondo (21), Kyle Lowry (24), Paul Millsap (47)\n\n52. Marcus Fizer, Iowa State, Chicago Bulls, 2000\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nAfter a monster junior season at Iowa State, Marcus Fizer was snatched up by the Chicago Bulls in what’s turning out to be one of the worst drafts of the last 40 years. Fizer peaked with 12.3 points per game his second season, but tore his ACL halfway through his third season. A little over a year later, the Charlotte Bobcats picked him in the expansion draft, but he never made the roster. He played another season, this time in Milwaukee. But he had to play in the D-League before getting three more NBA games in with New Orleans in his sixth season on a 10-day deal. Over the next decade, Fizer played for 12 teams around the world in various professional environments.\n\nTop three picks: Kenyon Martin (New Jersey), Stromile Swift (Vancouver), Darius Miles (LA Clippers)\n\nNotable picks after: Mike Miller (5), Jamal Crawford (8), Michael Redd (43)\n\n53. Dick Schnittker, Ohio State, Washington Capitols, 1950\n\nAccomplishments: Championship (2x)\n\nDick Schnittker played one season before leaving for two seasons due to military service during the Korean War. Schnittker was acquired by the Minneapolis Lakers in the dispersal draft from the Capitols in 1951, but he didn’t actually join the Lakers on the court until the 1953 playoffs. He played in three games in the division finals against Fort Wayne before the Lakers defeated the Knicks in five games in the NBA Finals. He was the first player to play in the NBA Finals for a team after not playing in the preceding regular season. Tracy McGrady was the last player to do that in 2013 with the Spurs. Schnittker won two titles, but barely contributed in either playoff run. He played six seasons in the NBA and was done before he turned 30.\n\nTop three picks: Chuck Share (Boston), Don Rehfeldt (Baltimore), Bob Cousy (Tri-Cities)\n\nNotable picks after: Larry Foust (5), George Yardley (7), Bill Sharman (24)\n\n54. Win Wilfong, University of Memphis, St. Louis Hawks, 1957\n\nAccomplishments: Championship\n\nWin Wilfong won an NBA championship in just his second season with the St. Louis Hawks. He didn’t have a huge impact on the title, but he did play in all 11 games of their playoff run. Shortly after, he was traded to Cincinnati where he had his best season with 10.1 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.7 assists. He must have felt like he was the point guard of the future for the Royals. Then Cincinnati drafted Oscar Robertson to be their point guard of the future.\n\nTop three picks: Hot Rod Hundley (Cincinnati), Charlie Tyra (Detroit), Jim Krebs (Minneapolis)\n\nNotable picks after: Sam Jones (8)\n\n55. Corky Calhoun, Pennsylvania, Phoenix Suns, 1972\n\nAccomplishments: Championship\n\nIn eight NBA seasons, Corky Calhoun never made it through a third season with a team. His first two with Phoenix eventually saw him traded during season 3. After nearly two seasons with the Lakers, Calhoun signed with Portland for their championship season. He contributed a bit, but mostly just played bit parts throughout his career. After two seasons with Portland, he was traded to Indiana, and they cut him after he played seven games that season.\n\nTop three picks: LaRue Martin (Portland), Bob McAdoo (Buffalo), Dwight Davis (Cleveland)\n\nNotable picks after: Paul Westphal (10), Julius Erving (12)\n\n56. Terry Driscoll, Boston College, Detroit Pistons, 1969\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nTerry Driscoll didn’t join the Pistons until after he spent a year in Italy playing pro basketball. But once he joined Detroit, he… really didn’t do much. Pistons waived him after his rookie season and Baltimore claimed him. They waived him a year later and he signed with Milwaukee, where he played 134 of his 274 career games. He played for four teams during his five years. Driscoll went back to Italy after his time in the NBA.\n\nTop three picks: Lew Alcindor (Milwaukee), Neal Walk (Phoenix), Lucius Allen (Seattle)\n\nNotable picks after: Jo Jo White (9), Norm Van Lier (34), Bob Dandridge (45)\n\n57. Ken Durrett, La Salle, Cincinnati Royals, 1971\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nKen Durrett signed a contract for $1 million with Cincinnati back when he was drafted. The kicker was it was structured to pay out until 1991. Not quite a Bobby Bonilla contract, but close to it. However, a knee injury that plagued Durrett in college ended up cutting his career short after just four seasons and 120 games in the NBA.\n\nTop three picks: Austin Carr (Cleveland), Sidney Wicks (Portland), Elmore Smith (Buffalo)\n\nNotable picks after: Fred Brown (6)\n\n58. Greg Kelser, Michigan State, Detroit Pistons, 1979\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nGreg Kelser had a productive rookie season averaging 14.2 points per game, which ended up being his career-high. But the real noteworthy thing is the “rivalry” he had with Larry Bird. Kelser’s Michigan State team defeated Bird’s Indiana State team in 1979 for the NCAA title. There was also some guy named Magic Johnson involved, I believe. But because of that loss, Bird often wanted to destroy any team Kelser played for (in six seasons, he played on four teams). Kelser said he didn’t want to be friends with Bird and when Larry was asked about that, he said he didn’t recall Kelser doing anything of note in the NBA. Bird’s teams were 11-1 against Kelser.\n\nTop three picks: Magic Johnson (LA Lakers), Dave Greenwood (Chicago), Bill Cartwright (New York)\n\nNotable picks after: Sidney Moncrief (5), Vinnie Johnson (7)\n\n59. Mike Green, Louisiana Tech, Seattle SuperSonics, 1973\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nMike Green didn’t start his professional basketball career with Seattle. He signed with the Denver Rockets in the ABA instead, and played there for three years until the NBA/ABA merger. Once Green made it to Seattle, he only lasted 85 games before being traded to San Antonio in his second season. He only played four seasons in the NBA. He was an All-Star in the ABA, but that’s it.\n\nTop three picks: Doug Collins (Philadelphia), Jim Brewer (Cleveland), Ernie DiGregorio (Buffalo)\n\nNotable picks after: Swen Nater (16), George McGinnis (22), Caldwell Jones (32)\n\n60. Jackie Moreland, Louisiana Tech, Detroit Pistons, 1960\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nJackie Moreland played five years in the NBA before taking a couple years hiatus. Then he ended up playing in the ABA for the New Orleans Buccaneers for three seasons in which he was a much more productive player than his days with the Pistons. He retired in 1970 and became an engineer on the construction of the Superdome in New Orleans. However, he died of pancreatic cancer a year later — four years before the Superdome opened.\n\nTop three picks: Oscar Robertson (Cincinnati), Jerry West (Minneapolis), Darrall Imhoff (New York)\n\nNotable picks after: Lenny Wilkens (6)\n\n61. Bill Garnett, Wyoming, Dallas Mavericks, 1982\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nI don’t have anything interesting to say about Bill Garnett other than he played an even 300 games in his NBA career. He once had a 21-point (career-high), 7-rebound, 3-block game off the bench in a game in which Fat Lever helped beat his Pacers team with a 13-point, 15-assist, 10-steal triple-double\n\nTop three picks: James Worthy (LA Lakers), Terry Cummings (San Diego), Dominique Wilkins (Utah)\n\nNotable picks after: Fat Lever (11), Sleepy Floyd (13)\n\n62. Richie Regan, Seton Hall, Rochester Royals, 1953\n\nAccomplishments: All-Star\n\nRiche Regan played just three years in the NBA. He was named an All-Star in his second season. That year, he averaged 9.8 points, 3.1 assists, and 2.9 rebounds while shooting 32.9 percent from the field. Unless he had the most unbelievable post All-Star break slump of all-time, I’m going to say that was a bad All-Star selection.\n\nTop three picks: Ray Felix (Baltimore), Bob Houbregs (Milwaukee), Jack Molinas (Fort Wayne)\n\nNotable picks after: Frank Ramsey (5), Cliff Hagan (13)\n\n63. Josh Jackson, Kansas, Phoenix Suns, 2017\n\nAccomplishments: All-Rookie\n\nThe Phoenix Suns gave up on Josh Jackson after two seasons. They traded him to Memphis, and the Grizzlies are trying to figure out if there’s anything here to develop. He had some success this season in the G-League, but his game at the NBA level has been lacking to say the least. There aren’t a lot of people in the NBA currently that optimistic about Jackson, but perhaps he can pull things together, focus his effort in developing, and carve out a long career for himself.\n\nTop three picks: Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia), Lonzo Ball (LA Lakers), Jayson Tatum (Boston)\n\nNotable picks after: De’Aaron Fox (5), Donovan Mitchell (13), Bam Adebayo (14)\n\n64. Dragan Bender, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Phoenix Suns, 2016\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nThe Phoenix Suns gave up on Dragan Bender after three years, declining his fourth year option on the rookie deal. It’s rare that something like this happens. Milwaukee and Golden State kicked the tires on him this season, but he’s still pretty bad. He was supposed to be a big man who could space the floor, but he can’t shoot. He may need to head back to Europe and refine his skill set, or just stay there for the rest of his professional career.\n\nTop three picks: Ben Simmons (Philadelphia), Brandon Ingram (LA Lakers), Jaylen Brown (Boston)\n\nNotable picks after: Pascal Siakam (27)\n\n65. Dick Rosenthal, Notre Dame, Fort Wayne Pistons, 1954\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nDick Rosenthal played the majority of his 85 NBA games in his rookie season, when he clocked in for 67 contests. Then he went into the military for a year before coming back for one more season. The most notable thing about him is he became the Athletic Director for Notre Dame in the 1980s and fired Digger Phelps from coaching the men’s team after 20 seasons.\n\nTop three picks: Frank Selvy (Baltimore), Bob Pettit (St. Louis), Gene Shue (Philadelphia)\n\nNotable picks after: Red Kerr (6), Richie Guerin (17)\n\n66. Sonny Dove, St. John’s, Detroit Pistons, 1967\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nSonny Dove played just five years of professional basketball, and only two of those years came with the Detroit Pistons before he left for the ABA. He was much more of a scorer in the ABA than his brief time in the NBA, but retired from basketball after shattering his leg in a basketball accident. He got into sports broadcasting after his playing days, but died early at the age of 37 in an accident as a taxi driver.\n\nTop three picks: Jimmy Walker (Detroit), Earl Monroe (Baltimore), Clem Haskins (Chicago)\n\nNotable picks after: Walt Frazier (5)\n\n67. Zeke Sinicola, Niagara University, Fort Wayne Pistons, 1951\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nZeke Sinicola only played two seasons in three years with the Fort Wayne Pistons, totaling 12 games. His second season had him away from the NBA as he served in the Army during the Korean War. So why didn’t he last longer in the NBA? Sinicola roomed with Jack Molinas when they were on the Pistons together. Remember Molinas from the No. 3 picks post? He was banned because of the point-shaving scandal in college. Well, Zeke’s brother believes the Pistons cut him from the team because he came from a neighborhood with mob ties. And that Zeke, despite his best efforts to not be involved with anything Molinas had going, was a victim of where he came from.\n\nTop three picks: Gene Melchiorre (Baltimore), Mel Hutchins (Tri-Cities), Marcus Freiberger (Indianapolis)\n\nNotable picks after: Lew Hitch (19)\n\n68. Pete Brennan, North Carolina, New York Knicks, 1958\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nPete Brennan only played one year and 16 games in his NBA career. He didn’t play after that, so the highlight of his basketball career was definitely his heroics for the Tar Heels.\n\nTop three picks: Elgin Baylor (Minneapolis), Archie Dees (Cincinnati), Mark Farmer (New York)\n\nNotable picks after: Hal Greer (13), Wayne Embry (22)\n\n69. Ron Shavlik, North Carolina State, New York Knicks, 1956\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nRon Shavlik only played eight games over two seasons in the NBA. He scored 10 points and grabbed 23 rebounds in 74 minutes of action. But that’s all the run he got in the NBA. However, he did contribute to basketball in one other way. He’s the grandfather to Duke legend Shavlik Randolph, who played eight seasons in the NBA. Taking Ron Shavlik, an All-American big man at NC State, over Elgin Baylor may have been a mistake (Baylor would be drafted again in 1958 number one overall).\n\nTop three picks: Si Green (Rochester), Bill Russell (Boston), Jim Paxson (Minneapolis)\n\nNotable picks after: K.C. Jones (8), Elgin Baylor (26), Sam Jones (30)\n\n70. Joe Dean, Louisiana State, Indianapolis Olympians, 1952\n\nAccomplishments: None\n\nJoe Dean never actually played in the NBA. Instead of joining the Olympians in 1952, Dean went on play Bartlesville Phillips 66ers in the National Industrial Basketball League. If you’ve ever heard the term “string music” when describing a shot that hit nothing but net, Dean came up with it in his illustrious career as a college basketball announcer. “Mr. String Music” is also credited with coining “tickling the twine,” which we’ve all definitely heard. But alas, he was drafted four and never played in the NBA. So he’s last.\n\nTop three picks: Mark Workman (Milwaukee), Jim Baechtold (Baltimore), Dick Groat (Fort Wayne)\n\nNotable picks after: Clyde Lovellete (9)\n\n(Top photo: Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images)"
