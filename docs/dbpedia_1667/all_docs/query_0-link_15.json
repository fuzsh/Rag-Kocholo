        "text": "On August 3rd, 2000, the Detroit Pistons signed-and-traded forward Grant Hill to the Orlando Magic for center Ben Wallace and guard Chucky Atkins (Both Wallace and Atkins signed and traded as well).\n\nAfter a 20-62 start during the 1993-94 NBA season, the Detroit Pistons ended up with the third pick in the 1994 NBA Draft. The club selected Duke forward Grant Hill with that pick. A two-time NCAA Champion, Hill had collected his share of awards in college. He was a two-time All-American in college and was named ACC player of the year in his final season. Hill also became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots.\n\nAdding Hill was a step in the right direction for a Pistons franchise in the process of trying to rebuild after their success in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s with the “Bad Boy” Pistons. Hill joined a Pistons team relatively thin on talent.\n\nA part of the Bad Boy teams that won two championships, Joe Dumars was an aging All-Star and Detroit’s best player when Hill arrived. The team also had 1993 first round picks Lindsey Hunter and Allan Houston as solid building blocks.\n\nAfter being drafted, Hill signed an eight-year, $44.28 million contract with an escape clause after the sixth year of the deal. With Hill on board, the Pistons started off a respectable 7-5. The wheels would fall off soon, as the team lost 20 of its next 24 games. Though Hill impressed on the court, Detroit struggled as a team, going 28-54 under head coach Don Chaney.\n\nHill was far better than expected and showed the complete package as he posted 19.9 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 5.0 APG, 1.8 SPG and 0.9 BPG in 70 games and 38.3 MPG. He made the NBA All-Star team in his rookie year after leading all vote getters. Hill was named co-Rookie of the Year after tying in votes with Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Kidd.\n\nIn the 1995 offseason, Detroit fired coach Chaney and his staff. Vice president of player operations Billy McKinney also resigned. The Pistons hired Doug Collins in a dual role to take on both positions.\n\nDetroit also added bruising big man Otis Thorpe in a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. Detroit had a mediocre 5-9 start during the 1995-96 season. Detroit gradually rose up the standings as the season progressed and by the end of the season found themselves in seventh place in the East with a 46-36 record. It was the team’s first playoff appearance in four years.\n\nA major reason behind the team’s growth was their rise on defense. Originally last in defense the previous year, Detroit rose to seventh in defensive efficiency. Hill was the centerpiece of Detroit’s new attack. In his second season, Hill managed 20.2 PPG, 9.8 RPG, 6.9 APG, 1.3 SPG and 0.6 BPG in 80 appearances and 40.8 MPG.\n\nOnce again, Hill was the leading vote getter for the NBA All-Star Game. He beat out Michael Jordan for the top spot despite Jordan returning for his first full season after coming out of retirement. Hill also earned a spot on the All-NBA second team.\n\nThe Pistons faced the 60-22 Orlando Magic in the first round of the playoffs. Hill had 21 points and 11 rebounds in the opener, but Magic sharpshooter Dennis Scott hit six threes and had 23 points in a 112-92 Orlando rout. Magic star Shaquille O’Neal had 29 points as the Magic took a 2-0 series lead with a 92-77 win.\n\nAll five Magic players scored in double figures and the Magic used a pivotal third quarter run to capture Game Three 101-98 and the series 3-0. In Hill’s first taste of playoff action, he managed 19.0 PPG on 50% shooting, 7.3 RPG, 3.7 APG and 1.3 SPG in 38.3 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons suffered a major setback in the summer of 1996 when guard Allan Houston left the team for the New York Knicks in free agency. Detroit flirted with free agents Dikembe Mutombo and Juwan Howard, but struck out on both players. Instead, the Pistons acquired forwards Grant Long and Stacey Augmon from the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nWithout Houston, Detroit was expected to take a step back for the 1996-97 season. The Pistons surprised many with their play early on. The team won eight of their first nine games and ended up with a 20-4 start. The Pistons had the second best record in the NBA at 43-14 after 57 games. They would struggle in the final 25 games, going 11-14. The weak finish dropped the Pistons from the third seed with homecourt advantage in the opening round to the fifth seed and a road matchup in the first round.\n\nHill was fantastic and was the engine that drove Detroit’s resurgence. He appeared in 80 games and managed 21.4 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 7.3 APG, 1.8 SPG and 0.6 BPG in 39.3 MPG. Hill finished third in MVP voting, made the All-Star team for the third consecutive year and earned his first nod on the All-NBA first team.\n\nDetroit matched up with the 56-26 Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. Dikembe Mutombo had 26 points and 15 rebounds and the Hawks pulled away late in an 89-75 victory. Hill had 29 points and 5 rebounds in the second game as Detroit used a 29-15 fourth quarter score to steal a game on the road 93-80. He also had a nasty finish over Mutombo.\n\nAs the series scene shifted, Hill and Lindsey Hunter combined for 50 points in a 99-91 win. In Game Four, the Hawks faced elimination on the road, but they built a double digit lead and held on with a twelve-point victory that evened the series 2-2.\n\nIn the fifth and final game, Detroit looked to upset the Hawks and built an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter. The Hawks answered as they rallied to tie the game. With the game tied 77-77, Mutombo had two key blocks on Hill and Christian Laettner and Steve Smith both hit clutch shots that gave Atlanta an 82-77 lead late.\n\nThe Pistons had a chance to tie, but Terry Mills missed a three that would’ve tied the score with five seconds left. Atlanta ended up winning 84-79 and eliminated Detroit 3-2. For the series, Hill produced 23.6 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 5.4 APG, 0.8 SPG and 1.0 BPG in 40.6 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons traded veteran Otis Thorpe to the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1997 offseason. Detroit signed center Brian Williams to a seven-year deal and guard Malik Sealy to bolster their rotation. The team had lost veterans Terry Mills and Michael Curry to the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks respectively.\n\nThe 1997-98 season was a year of disappointment in Detroit. The Pistons began the season 2-0, but dropped the next five games to fall to 2-5. An injury to Joe Dumars left Detroit in a rough spot. The team could never cross over .500. In late December, the Pistons made a move, trading Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jerry Stackhouse and Eric Montross.\n\nThe trade didn’t provide immediate help. With the team at 21-24, the Pistons fired Doug Collins and named assistant coach Alvin Gentry as his replacement on an interim basis. Hill and Collins had their struggles together in the player-coach dynamic.\n\nDetroit still could never right the ship and finished out of the playoffs with a 37-45 record. Hill still had a strong individual performance, amassing 21.1 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 6.8 APG, 1.8 SPG and 0.7 BPG in 81 games and 40.7 MPG. He made his fourth consecutive All-Star team while also earning a place on the All-NBA second team.\n\nThe NBA lockout happened after the ‘97-‘98 season. After it ended, Detroit returned with veterans Loy Vaught, Jud Buechler and Christian Laettner added to the fold.\n\nDetroit went on several streaks during the 1998-99 season. They experienced four winning streaks of at least three games and had four losing streaks that reached three games as well. The team was in seventh place after 43 games with a 23-20 record. Detroit won six of their final seven games to move into fifth place with a 29-21 mark.\n\nHill appeared in all 50 games. He managed 21.1 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 6.0 APG, 1.6 SPG and 0.5 BPG in 37.0 MPG. Hill made the All-NBA second team for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe Pistons went on to the playoffs where they matched up with the Atlanta Hawks for the second time in three years. In the series opener, Hill had 26 points on 10-of-18 shooting, but he got no help from his team. Every other player on Detroit combined for 44 points on 18-for-57 shooting (31.5%). Atlanta won the game 90-70.\n\nDetroit continued their cold shooting in the series, going 28-for-72 (38.9% shooting) in an 89-69 loss. In the third game, Detroit stymied the Hawks, holding Atlanta to just 63 points in a 16-point win. Hill had 23 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists in Game Four as Detroit evened the series 2-2 with a 103-82 blowout win.\n\nThe series finale saw former Piston Grant Long go for 26 points and help Atlanta eliminate Detroit with an 87-75 win. Hill had 21 points, but shot 10-for-27 in the elimination game. Overall, Hill compiled 19.4 PPG on 45.7% shooting, 7.2 RPG, 7.4 APG and 2.0 SPG during the series.\n\nAfter the season, Joe Dumars and Brian Williams — now named Bison Dele — retired. Detroit signed former Pistons Terry Mills and Michael Curry to bolster their rotation.\n\nDetroit dropped their first four games of the 1999-00 season. The team was inconsistent again, falling below .500 while also rising with numerous winning streaks. After a three-game losing streak that left the team at 28-30, coach Alvin Gentry was fired and replaced by assistant George Irvine.\n\nUnder Irvine, Detroit managed to play better, going 14-10 in the final 24 games. The team ended up 42-40 and barely made the playoffs as the seventh seed. Throughout the latter stages of the season, Hill dealt with a sprained ankle that caused him to exit early in an April 15th game against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nHill didn’t play the rest of the regular season. He finished up with 74 games played and compiled 25.8 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 5.2 APG, 1.4 SPG and 0.6 BPG in 37.5 MPG for Detroit during the 1999-00 season.\n\nHill’s ankle never improved in time for Detroit’s first round matchup with the Miami Heat. Hill still went through long hours of treatment and therapy on his left ankle so that he could play in the playoffs.\n\nHill gave it a go in Game One, but was limited, playing 34 minutes and going 3-for-9 in a 95-85 loss to the Heat. Hill said he felt great during pregame of the second game, but he heard a pop in his ankle and left in the second half after participating in 21 minutes (9 points).\n\nThe Heat took the second game in close fashion. Forward Jamal Mashburn made a shot that won Miami the game 84-82. Hill was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. With Hill out for the rest of the playoffs, Detroit dropped the final game of the series 91-72. Miami completed the 3-0 sweep.\n\nBen Wallace became a member of the Orlando Magic when he was acquired along with Tim Legler, Terry Davis and Jeff McInnis from the Washington Wizards for center Isaac Austin. Wallace was the only one of those four players acquired to stay with the Magic for the 1999-00 season.\n\nOriginally seen as just an expiring contract, Wallace proved his worth in Orlando and established himself as a legitimate NBA rotation player. The Magic acquired point guard Chucky Atkins as a training camp invite in 1999.\n\nA local product, Atkins was undrafted out of South Florida in 1996. He had played one season with the La Crosse Bobcats of the Continental Basketball Association and two seasons with Cibona of the Croatian basketball league, where he won back-to-back championships in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe point guard had joined the team for Summer League and then training camp. He outplayed competitors Lee Mayberry and Louis Bullock and earned a spot on the roster as a backup point guard to starter Darrell Armstrong.\n\nOrlando was a surprise team early on. Expected to be a cellar dweller, Orlando started off strong with a 15-11 record after 26 games. The team proceeded to lose 13 of their next 14 games. At 16-24, the Magic could’ve packed it in, but fought. At 31-36 in March, Orlando won seven consecutive games to get to 38-36 and take the eighth spot.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks were two games in the loss column behind Orlando at this point. Both the Bucks and Orlando would play two times in the final eight games. The Bucks won the two final games which included a pivotal 85-83 win in the penultimate game of the regular season. The win clinched a playoff spot for Milwaukee (41-40) since they held the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Magic (40-41). Orlando was eliminated from the playoffs with the loss.\n\nThough the ending was bitter, Orlando was a pleasant surprise with a 41-41 mark. Several previously unknown players stepped up and the Magic team gained the nickname “Heart & Hustle.” Led by Darrell Armstrong and Bo Outlaw, the Magic team featured seven undrafted players who stepped on the court during the season.\n\nWallace and Atkins were both a part of that undrafted brigade. Wallace provided energy as he started at power forward during the season. He appeared in 81 games (all starts) and produced 4.8 PPG on 50.3% shooting, 8.2 RPG, 0.8 APG, 0.9 SPG and 1.6 BPG in 24.2 MPG during the 1999-00 season with Orlando.\n\nAtkins participated in 82 games and averaged 9.5 PPG on 42.4% from the field, 1.5 RPG, 3.7 APG and 0.6 SPG in 19.8 MPG off the bench for Orlando the previous season.\n\nHill signed a seven-year, $92.8 million contract. He initially sought a four-year deal, which would allow him an opportunity to renegotiate a more lucrative contract after his 10th season in the league. The sign-and-trade allowed Hill to get an annual raise of 12.5% rather than 10%.\n\nA sign-and-trade became an option since Detroit wanted to keep their exception for a free agent. McGrady and Hill earned max years and more money in annual raises.\n\nDeVos also had the advantage of knowing Hill’s dad, Calvin Hill, from his days as a running back for the Dallas Cowboys. Active in the Christian Reformed Church, DeVos helped start prayer services for the Cowboys and other professional sports teams. \"Grant said to me: ‘My Dad said this would be a good place for me,’ “ DeVos told me.\n\nAtkins signed a four-year, $22.5 million deal with Detroit. Wallace agreed to a six-year contract worth $30 million total.\n\nWith Orlando acquiring both Hill and McGrady and not giving up much, many saw this as a major win for Orlando.\n\nOrlando was considered one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference coming into the 2000-01 season. Injuries would severely destroy those hopes. Hill’s left ankle problems were more serious than initially predicted.\n\nHill (13.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 6.3 APG and 1.3 SPG) participated in the first two games of the season before going on the injured list for five weeks. He returned for two more games before being shut down. Hill eventually had surgery on the left ankle, ending his season prematurely. Despite missing 78 games, he made the All-Star team after being voted in by fans.\n\nThe new additions and injuries to Hill caused Orlando to struggle with a 5-11 record early on. They went through a stretch where they went 14-3 and managed to finish the season 43-39. The mark was good enough for a playoff berth.\n\nWith Hill out for the entire season, the Magic were shorthanded going into their matchup with the second-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in the opening round. Milwaukee took the first game by 103-90. They took a 2-0 lead after a 103-96 victory in Game Two. Tracy McGrady had 42 points, 8 rebounds and 10 assists as Orlando made the series 2-1 with a 121-116 overtime win. The Bucks ended the series with a 112-104 win on the road.\n\nIn the 2001 offseason, Orlando looked to bolster their frontline. The big men on the team were grinders, rebounders and defenders, but lacked low-post scoring ability. It made Orlando a perimeter-oriented offense. Looking to balance out the team, McGrady helped the teampursue former teammate Antonio Davis. The Magic failed in the Davis sweepstakes, but they eventually settled on signing veterans Horace Grant and Patrick Ewing.\n\nHill could never get his ankle right during the 2001-02 season. He appeared in 14 games before shutting it down for the season after surgery to remove bone spurs in his problematic left ankle. Hill finished his second season with 16.8 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 4.6 APG and 0.6 SPG in 36.6 MPG.\n\nThe Magic began the 2001-02 campaign with a lukewarm 13-17 start. The Magic rebounded once again and finished 44-38. Orlando ended up in the fifth spot of the Eastern Conference playoff seeding. They matched up with the Charlotte Hornets in the first round.\n\nCharlotte took the first game by just one point in the series opener after a turnover by Tracy McGrady on the final possession. McGrady had 31 points and backup guard Troy Hudson contributed 26 points as the Magic evened the series with a 111-103 overtime win.The third game also went to an extra frame, but this time the Hornets would come out on top 110-100. The Hornets would take care of Orlando in Game Four, blowing them out 102-85 and winning the series 3-1.\n\nThe 2002 offseason saw Orlando make small additions in rotation players Jacque Vaughn and Shawn Kemp. Hill was in and out of the Magic lineup with ankle problems once again during the 2002-03 season. He had played 29 games when he decided in mid-January of 2003 to stop playing after dealing with left ankle soreness. Hill would be listed as out indefinitely, but really he would end up mission a year and a half of action. He finished his ‘02-‘03 campaign with a stat line of 14.5 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 4.2 APG and 1.0 SPG in 29.1 MPG.\n\nOrlando finally had a decent start, going 5-1 in their first six games. The team would be up and down. They were 27-28 when they dealt Mike Miller and Ryan Humphrey to the Memphis Grizzlies for Drew Golden and Goran Giricek. Not much changed, as the Magic went 16-11 over the final 27 games to finish 42-40.\n\nOrlando made it into the playoffs as the eighth seed and battled the defensive juggernaut Detroit Pistons. Orlando stunned Detroit with a 99-94 win after McGrady poured in 43 points. McGrady had 46 in Game Two, but Detroit evened the series with an 89-77 victory.\n\nIn the third game, Detroit took a double digit lead, but Orlando came back and managed to win 89-80. McGrady had 27 points and 9 assists in Game Four as Orlando won 100-92 and took a 3-1 series lead.\n\nThe Pistons routed the Magic with a 98-67 in Game Five. Pistons guard Chauncey Billups put up 40 points in the sixth game and the Pistons won 103-88. Billups had 37 points in Game Seven and rookie Tayshaun Prince came alive in Game Seven with 20 points in a 108-93 rout. It completed an amazing series comeback for Detroit. For Orlando, it was the third consecutive season the team could not get out of the first round.\n\nIn the 2003 offseason, Orlando signed forward Juwan Howard and guard Tyronn Lue in free agency. Hill was once again out for the season. Orlando won their first game, but lost the next 19 games to fall to 1-19. Coach Rivers was let go after the team went 1-10 and replaced by assistant Johnny Davis. The Magic finished the ’03-‘04 campaign 21-61. The mark was the worst record in the NBA.\n\nOrlando won the 2004 NBA Draft lottery and selected Atlanta high schooler Dwight Howard with the number one overall selection. Standing at 6′10″ with unique athleticism, Howard was Orlando’s center of the future.\n\nMeanwhile, McGrady had expressed his unhappiness and displeasure with carrying a struggling franchise. His dislike for new management and uneasiness with carrying such a heavy burden led to him asking for a trade. McGrady was dealt to the Houston Rockets with Lue, Juwan Howard and Reece Gaines to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis, Cutting Mobley and Kelvin Cato.\n\nAnother bright spot was the return of Hill. With his ankle surgeries behind him, Hill was finally ready to play. Orlando had the best record in the Eastern Conference through 19 games (13-6).\n\nThe team struggled a bit after, but still maintained a playoff spot. After defeating the New Jersey Nets on March 5, the Magic were 31-27 and in the fifth spot of the playoffs. Orlando took a dive, losing 19 of 24 games. During that stretch, head coach Johnny Davis was fired and assistant Chris Jent became interim coach for the remainder of the year.\n\nHill was relatively healthy, but a shin injury caused him to miss 13 of the team’s final 27 games. Orlando ended up with a 36-46 record that season and out of the playoffs. appearing in 67 games. Still, Hill was the unofficial comeback player of the year, proving that he could still perform at a high level despite his previously devastating injury setbacks. Hill earned his first All-Star nod in four years and compiled 19.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.4 SPG in 34.9 MPG.\n\nAfter the season, the Magic hired head coach Brian Hill. Hill had coached the Magic previously from 1993-1997. Grant Hill suffered a sports hernia injury that required surgery. He missed the first 19 games of the season, and was in and out of the lineup with a re-occurrence of the same hernia injury. Hill was limited to 21 games (17 starts) and compiled 15.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 2.3 APG and 1.1 SPG in 29.2 MPG.\n\nNew coach Brian Hill had the Magic playing slower and he implored ball movement. That clashed with the serial dribbling Francis. Francis and Hill’s relationship went sour when Francis refused to re-enter a game against the Seattle Supersonics on January 11th. The Magic suspended Francis and sent him home for two games before reinstating him following a meeting with coach Hill and team executives.\n\nEventually, the Magic dealt Francis to the New York Knicks for Trevor Ariza and Anfernee Hardaway. The move cleared cap space for the Magic to be players in free agency in 2007 when Hill became a free agent. Orlando finished 36-46 during the 2005-06 season and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.\n\nOrlando got off to a strong start during the 2006-07 campaign. They began the season tops in the Eastern Conference with a 14-5 record. The Magic reached 22-14 at one point, but they went 7-22 over their next 29 games to fall to 29-36. The Magic stayed in the playoffs despite a paltry 34-41 record with seven games left. Orlando went 6-1 in the final seven games to finish 40-42. The mark placed them in the eighth spot in the East.\n\nHill was relatively healthy, but did miss some time due to resting for precautionary measures, tendinitis in his left knee and a left foot injury. The 6′8″ forward appeared in 65 contests (64 starts) and contributed 14.4 PPG, 3.6 RPG, 2.1 APG and 0.9 SPG in 30.9 MPG.\n\nOrlando entered the 2007 playoffs and matched up with the number one-seeded Detroit Pistons in the first round. In the series opener, all five Pistons starters scored in double figures as Detroit won 100-92. Pistons guards Chauncey Billups and Richard “Rip” Hamilton combined for 43 points in an eight-point victory for the Pistons in the second game.\n\nDetroit took control in the third game, routing Orlando 93-77. In the fourth game Detroit used a late 14-7 run in the final 2:44 to win 97-93 and seal up the 4-0 series sweep. Hill was solid in the series, producing 15.0 PPG on 50% shooting, 5.5 RPG, 3.8 APG and 0.5 SPG in the sweep.\n\nAfter the season, Hill became a free agent. With many interested suitors, Hill opted for a contender rather than a payday. He signed with the Phoenix Suns on a two-year, $3.8 million deal with a player option in the second year.\n\nHill’s tenure with the Magic was wrecked by injuries as he missed 281 games in his first four years. The most games he played in any season was the 2004-05 season where he played 67. Hill ended his time in Orlando with 16.4 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 3.1 APG and 1.1 SPG in 200 career games. The point forward shot 50% from the field and 79% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nWallace and Atkins joined the new look Pistons team and both became permanent starters.\n\nAtkins started for a few years, but eventually was replaced by Chauncey Billups who went on to win Finals MVP for the 2004 Pistons Championship, and Atkins was involved in the trade that brought the Pistons Rasheed Wallace and helped put them over the hump for a title.\n\nBen Wallace became the defensive anchor for Detroit from 2000-2006. He won defensive player of the year four times and has a championship to show for it, so this trade is the perfect example for trades that have turned a complete 180 in terms of the winners and losers of the trade.\n\nAtkins was traded before the trade deadline to the Boston Celtics in a three-team, seven-player deal that brought Rasheed Wallace to Detroit from the Atlanta Hawks. Atkins ended his three and a half year run in Detroit with 10.1 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 3.3 APG and 0.7 SPG in 265 games. The 5′11″ guard shot 41% on FGs, 37% from three and 71% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nWith Rasheed Wallace inserted into the lineup, Detroit became a terror for the opposition. Their starting lineup complemented by a strong bench. Detroit lost their first two games after the trade, but won 20 of their final 24 games to finish with the second best record in the Eastern Conference at 54-28.\n\nBen Wallace had another strong performance during the ‘03-‘04 season. He experienced an increased role in the team’s offense, attempting 3.3 more shots per 36 minutes. Wallace earned a spot on the All-NBA second team and the NBA’s All-Defensive first team. Wallace did not receive his third Defensive Player of the Year trophy, losing out to Indiana’s Ron Artest.\n\nHe made his third All-Star team as a starter at center. Wallace appeared in 81 games (all starts) and managed 9.5 PPG, 12.4 RPG, 1.7 APG, 1.8 SPG and 3.0 BPG in 37.7 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons went on to the playoffs where they battled the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. Wallace had 17 points, 13 rebounds and 3 steals in a 108-82 Pistons rout in the series opener at Detroit. Detroit found themselves down by 15 point in the second half of Game Two. They came back and had a chance to tie late, but Rasheed Wallace fumbled a pass out of bounds with 4.1 seconds left. The Bucks made two free throws and won the game 92-88.\n\nAfter losing homecourt advantage, the Pistons rebounded well. They used a 53-36 second half advantage to win 95-85. Hamilton had 27 points and 6 assists as Detroit got greedy in Game Four and took another game in Milwaukee with a 109-92 blowout.\n\nThe Pistons closed out the series in Game Five with a comfortable 91-77 win that saw Tayshaun Prince lead the way with 24 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists. For the series, Wallace finished with 10.6 PPG on 47.7% shooting, 13.4 RPG, 2.4 APG, 2.6 SPG and 3.0 BPG in 38.6 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons moved on to the Semifinals where they attempted to right their wrongs against a New Jersey Nets team that swept them in the Conference Finals the previous year. Detroit made a powerful statement in the first game, holding the Nets to 56 points on 19-for-70 shooting in a 22-point rout.\n\nThe backcourt of Billups and Hamilton chipped in 28 points apiece in Game Two as Detroit took a 2-0 lead with a 95-80 victory. The Nets had built a 12-point edge at halftime of that game, but Detroit outscored them 61-34 in the second half. Heading to New Jersey, the Nets jumped on Detroit in the third game, leading by as much as 21 points in the first half. Detroit would slightly close the gap, but never seriously threatened as New Jersey won 95-80.\n\nIn Game Four, Nets guard Jason Kidd had a triple double (22 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists) and the Nets used a 30-16 third quarter edge to even the series 2-2 with a 94-79 win. Game Four would go down as a classic playoff game. Neither team led by more than four points in the fourth quarter. New Jersey took an 88-85 lead after a free throw from Kerry Kittles with 2.9 seconds left.\n\nWith no timeouts, Tayshaun Prince inbounded the ball to Chauncey Billups. Billups took a few dribbles before banking in a 43-foot three-pointer at the buzzer. The shot tied the game and sent it into overtime. The game would go into three overtimes and was a war of attrition. Four players on each team fouled out, leading to wonky lineups that both teams had never played.\n\nIn the end, the Nets won 127-120 thanks to timely shots from Richard Jefferson (31 points and 11 rebounds) and Brian Scalabrine (17 points and four threes). Facing elimination and a tough road game, the Pistons were in a tough spot. The Nets jumped out to a 15-4 lead early, but Detroit showed resolve and outscored the Nets 46-21 in the rest of the first half to build a 50-36 halftime lead.\n\nNew Jersey kept the game close in the second half, but the Pistons held on for an 81-75 win. Ben Wallace had 20 rebounds in the game (nine offensive rebounds). In the seventh and final game, all five Pistons starters scored in double figures. Detroit led by as much as 25 in a 90-69 snoozer. For the series, Wallace saw heavy minutes (41.6 MPG) in the series as he put up 11.7 PPG, 14.3 RPG, 2.3 APG, 2.3 SPG and 2.4 BPG.\n\nDetroit moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals where they battled the 61-21 Indiana Pacers. Led by Jermaine O’Neal and Ron Artest, Indiana was an equally fierce defensive team.\n\nThe series opener was a slugfest. With the game tied with 31.7 seconds left, Pacers veteran Reggie Miller nailed a three to give Indiana a 77-74 lead. Detroit had three chances to tie, but missed three consecutive three point shots in a 14-second span. Indiana ended up taking the first game 78-74.\n\nBefore Game Two, Rasheed Wallace guaranteed a Pistons win. The defensive intensity would rise a couple of notches. The Pistons had 19 blocks and none were more important than a fourth quarter moment that went down in Pistons history.\n\nWith 23.9 seconds left and Detroit up 69-67, Chauncey Billups was stripped by Pacers guard Jamaal Tinsley. After Indiana recovered the ball, it was pitched ahead to Miller who was out in front of the crowd. Prince came from seemingly out of nowhere to block Miller’s layup with 17.9 seconds left. With the shot clock turned off, Indiana was forced to foul. Detroit ended up winning the game 72-67 and tieing the series 1-1.\n\nAs the series scene shifted to Detroit, the Pistons jumped on Indiana immediately, taking a 27-14 lead in the first quarter of Game Three. Indiana would close the gap, but never seriously threatened Detroit as the Pistons won 85-78.\n\nFor Game Four, the Pacers made a lineup change, inserting Austin Croshere into the starting lineup for Jeff Foster. Known as a solid three-point shooter, Croshere would space the floor, allowing Artest and O’Neal to operate in the paint.\n\nCroshere hit three treys and scored 14 points and Artest led the way with 20 points as Indiana evened the series and took homecourt advantage back with an 83-68 win. In Indiana, Hamilton has 32 points and Detroit stifled the Pacers offensive attack, holding them to 32.9% shooting in an 83-65 beatdown.\n\nGame Six saw the Pacers insert Al Harrington over Croshere. The Pacers jumped out to a 23-11 lead after the first quarter. Both teams would struggle to score, but Detroit closed the gap at halftime to a six-point deficit. The game was tight throughout the second half. A flagrant foul by Artest on Hamilton with 3:57 left in the game seemed to change the momentum of a 59-59 score.\n\nAfter the flagrant, Detroit outscored Indiana 10-6 to win the game 69-65 and the series 4-2. For the series, Wallace amassed 7.8 PPG, 15.5 RPG, 1.5 APG, 1.0 SPG and 3.2 BPG in 39.5 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons advanced to the NBA Finals and matched up against the Los Angeles Lakers. It was Detroit’s first Finals appearance in 14 years. Led by three-time champions Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal, the Lakers were a heavy favorite over the Pistons.\n\nIn the first game, the Pistons let O’Neal and Bryant produce 59 points, but shut down their teammates. The rest of the Lakers team scored 16 points on 20% shooting in an 87-75 Pistons win. Game Two saw Kobe Bryant go off for 33 points.\n\nThe Lakers held the lead for most of the game, but Detroit managed to use a second half burst to take a three-point lead with 10.9 seconds remaining. Bryant hit a three with 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter that forced overtime. In the extra frame, the Lakers dominated, outscoring Detroit 10-2 in a 99-91 win.\n\nIn the third game, Detroit never trailed as they walloped the Lakers 88-68 at home. Game Four was closer, but Detroit used a 32-24 fourth quarter advantage to win the game 88-80. The Pistons took home the championship in Game Five with a comfortable 100-87 victory that saw the Karl Malone-less Lakers struggle.\n\nDetroit captured their first championship since 1990 and their third overall. Wallace managed a double double in a tough series matchup against O’Neal. The former Virginia Union standout produced 10.8 PPG, 13.6 RPG, 1.4 APG, 1.8 SPG and 1.0 BPG during the series.\n\nAfter their title run, the Pistons lost Mehmet Okur and Mike James in free agency to the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves respectively. They picked up former All-Star Antonio McDyess to bolster their bench.\n\nDetroit got off to a sluggish start in their title defense season. The team was 4-3 when they entered an early season rematch with their rival, the Indiana Pacers. The Pacers pulled away late in the game at Auburn Hills, but the final score would be an afterthought.\n\nWth 45.9 seconds remaining in the game, the Pacers held a 97–82 lead. Wallace went up for a shot attempt and was fouled from behind by Ron Artest in an aggressive manner. The hard foul by Artest led to Wallace shoving the Pacers forward in the face with both hands. The incident caused multiple players and coaches from both teams to get in between Wallace and Artest, and separate both players.\n\nAfter the spat, Artest went to lie down at the scorer’s table. Wallace threw a towel at Artest. The fight took a dangerous turn when a spectator named John Green, threw a plastic cup of a beverage that hit Artest in the chest. He leapt off the table and made a bee line into the crowd like the Tasmanian devil. Artest grabbed the wrong patron.\n\nPacers guard Stephen Jackson — a 2004 offseason acquisition — followed Artest into the stands and punched a different fan. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller, Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons’ Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting.\n\nThe melee continued and the game was unable to finish as Pacers players were escorted to the locker room with Pistons fans hurling debris at them. The situation was a black eye for the NBA. The image of players fighting with fans on national television left a burning image in the minds of every viewer.\n\nAfter the ugly situation, NBA commissioner David Stern handed out aggressive punishments for all players involved. Wallace was suspended for six games. The Pacers players faced stiffer suspensions because of their actions in the stands and in interactions with fans.\n\nThe Pistons still continued on with a sluggish start. They went 12-12 in their first 24 games. At the halfway mark of the season, Detroit was just 23-18 and had the fourth best record in the East. The Pistons would turn it on in the second half of the season, going 31-10 over the final 41 games. This stretch included a key 17-5 record in the last 22 contests. That placed Detroit second in the Eastern Conference with a 54-28 record.\n\nWallace regained his Defensive Player of the Year crown and managed to earn spots on the All-NBA third team and the NBA’s All-Defensive first teams. He also made his third consecutive All-Star team. For the season, Wallace appeared in 74 games and compiled 9.7 PPG, 12.2 RPG, 1.7 APG, 1.4 SPG and 2.4 BPG in 36.1 MPG.\n\nThe Pistons met the Allen Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the 2005 postseason. The series opener saw Philadelphia take a 28-12 lead early on. Detroit turned things around and outscored the Sixers 94-57 the rest of the way as they won easily 106-85.\n\nGame Two saw the backcourt duo of Rip Hamilton and Chauncey Billups combine for 43 points as Detroit took a 2-0 lead with a 99-84 victory. Game Three took place in Philadelphia and the 76ers responded well at home. Iverson (37 points and 15 assists) controlled the game and the Sixers pulled away late in a 115-104 win.\n\nDuring the 2005-06 season, Wallace won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year in five seasons. He earned his third placement on the All-NBA second team and his fifth consecutive nod on the All-Defensive first team. Wallace also made the All-Star team for the fifth consecutive season. Overall, Wallace participated in all 82 games and amassed 7.3 PPG, 11.3 RPG (fourth in the NBA), 1.9 APG, 1.8 SPG (tenth) and 2.2 BPG (ninth) in 35.2 MPG.\n\nIn the 2006 offseason, Wallace became a free agent. The Pistons offered him a four-year, $48 million deal. The Chicago Bulls blew that offer out of the water with a four-year, $60 million contract. Citing Wallace’s age (31) and declining athleticism, Detroit chose not to raise their offer and let Wallace sign with Chicago.\n\nWallace ended his Pistons tenure with a stat line of 7.9 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 1.7 APG, 1.6 SPG and 2.8 BPG. The defensive stalwart shot 47% from the field and 42% from the charity stripe in six years.\n\nGrant Hill opening statements in introductory press conference (via Magic.com):\n\n“First of all I would like to thank all of you for waiting patiently. I’d like to thank the Lord for this day. It is truly a blessing to be able to play where you want to play. I must admit, I don’t really have a speech to give. My wife said to remember the five B’s. She said ‘be brief, brother, be brief’, so I think she’s a little hungry. I got a chance last summer to see what Orlando was doing and how they were taking the risk. It was a gamble to do what they did. I was really impressed with that.\n\n“Also, the signing of Coach Rivers and seeing what this team did last year and how they responded to him. How they came out with a lot of heart and a lot of hustle. When we played against them they just played so hard and I was so impressed by that. I was a big fan of theirs, and I kind of felt that if I were to leave Detroit, this is where I wanted to go.\n\n“Of course, coming down here in July and having an opportunity to meet with the entire organization - Mr. DeVos, John Gabriel, Coach Rivers, some of the players - this was the place I wanted to be. My brain, my heart and my gut were saying to be here. So, I’m excited and I’m looking forward to training camp if you can believe that. I’m looking forward to getting down here, getting acclimated, and playing along side (Tracy McGrady), Darrell (Armstrong), Monty (Williams) and all the other guys. So I’m really excited and thankful for the day.”\n\nWhy he chose Orlando:\n\n“I kind of felt all along that if I was to leave Detroit this is where I wanted to go. I’ve been a big fan of this organization, from afar, for the 5-6 years that I’ve been in the league. I think coming down here the first day and just being around the different players. What was really impressive, and I’m not sure if I should say this, is Horace Grant had good things to say and he’s a guy who got traded.\n\n“He was saying good things about the team and the organization and just everything about it. It felt like it was a good fit for me. So I pretty much knew then. If there was any kind of indecision, after my visit I knew for sure that this is where I wanted to be.”\n\nOn how good the Magic will be:\n\n“I think from the owner all the way down the goal here is to win a championship. I think that we are all here on the same page and we are all shooting for that same goal.\n\n“I think we have one of the better teams in the NBA and one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. I know that there are a lot of factors - health, meshing, team chemistry, and all those things - but I’m really excited about this upcoming season and also the postseason. I’ll leave all the predictions to [the media] and to the barbershops. I just go out there and play ball.”\n\nOn the pressure that comes with high expectations:\n\n“I don’t really look at it, and I never really have, as pressure. I look at it as opportunity. I had six years in Detroit that were great times. I had great relationships that were established. I think that sometimes to embrace the future you have to let go of the past. The good and the bad that has happened,\n\n“It’s time to move on. I look forward to the challenges that are ahead here in Orlando and I look forward to establishing new relationships and accomplishing new things with this organization. There is always pressure, but I think that there are probably teams that don’t have expectations. And I think that the expectations are high is a sign that we are supposed to be pretty good and I really like that. I really look forward to that. I look forward to getting to know these guys a little bit better and getting to know their games.\n\n“One of the things that really impressed me about these guys last year was just how selfless they are. They just seem like they came out and played and played hard and all wanted to win. I think that Tracy [McGrady] and myself are the same way. We want to win. We don’t care about stats or any of that, we just want to win. I think that it is a good environment and a good bunch of guys and I think that there will be pressure, but that’s fun.”\n\nOn his previous ankle problems:\n\n“I went and saw the doctors yesterday. About another two weeks of therapy and rehab, then I’m down here playing pick up ball and back to 100 percent. So, I’ll have a good five weeks to work out with these guys and get acclimated, not just to the team but to the area. I feel great. It’s kind of a big tease to be in a gym and not being able to play. I’m definitely looking forward, for the first time in a long time, to training camp. I look forward to getting out there and running.”\n\nHow he was really impressed with Orlando’s previous season:\n\n“I was just impressed about this particular team. I just like the way they play. I was by myself putting my wife through watching games on NBA.com, watching the Magic play. They could be playing the Clippers and watching the game it was exciting. So, hopefully I can come in and add to that and fit in with the guys, and Tracy as well. I just look forward to that. It’s going to be a lot of fun.”\n\nOn the process of sealing the deal with Orlando:\n\n“I just wanted to make sure, first and foremost, that it was okay with our team here in Orlando. I didn’t want to be in a situation where it didn’t do well for us. Everything worked out well for everybody. At first I thought maybe a four-year deal, but every time I came down here in July I added a year on so now it’s seven. So, I’m just happy to be here and I look forward to everything.”\n\nOn if he left Detroit on good terms:\n\n“I think so. Joe (Dumars) has a vision and has a plan but it may take some time. They may even follow the Orlando Magic model. I think everything is okay Sometimes those things are hard to do. Especially when you’ve been in a certain situation for a long time. But like Mr. Gabriel said, they got what they wanted. They got two guys that they feel will be a part of their organization. Regardless of whether I did a sign and trade or not they still were going to go there. So, everyone comes out a winner, and that’s the most important thing.”\n\nOn what intrigued him about the city of Orlando:\n\n“I’d say it’s the weather, too. We played here in Orlando, this past year, in January and we left a snowstorm in Detroit when we came down and I was overdressed, as usual. Man it was nice, really nice. I always liked the area, the city, and the people here in the city, the few times I’ve been around. Like I said, I’ve always admired this area and I always wanted to play here if I were to leave Detroit and it’s happened so I’m excited.”\n\nOn what the the opportunity would’ve been like to play with Tim Duncan and what he expects playing with Tracy McGrady:\n\n“It would have been nice, but Tim’s got to do what he’s got to do. We are all individuals, but I think that there was this perception that we were going to do the same thing. I just wanted him to make his own decision and be comfortable with his decision and I respect that, whatever he did. I still think, though, that we are going to accomplish what we set out to accomplish. We have a very good team and we have high expectations and high goals and we want to go out there and win. It will be interesting to see what happens.\n\n“I don’t know what the predictions are. I know that L.A. (Lakers) was picked to finish fourth in the West last year. So, sometimes predictions are off. I look forward to going out there and proving that we could win. I feel that Tracy [McGrady] will help us win. I just marvel at the way he plays. He’s multi-talented. A lot of guys can just score or just do one thing. He can do everything.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to watch him get better and blossom into one of the best players in the league if not the best. I’m honored to play with Tracy McGrady. I look forward to playing with him and playing with all these guys and just trying to get better and better as a team and win as many games as we can.”\n\nBen Wallace on how he originally wanted to stay in Orlando (via Orlando Sentinel):\n\n“I wanted to stay, but the business side of the game took over. I enjoyed myself in Orlando. I felt like I had found my niche, and I was just getting to learn my way around.”\n\nHow he feels the Magic won’t really miss him:\n\n“People say the Magic may miss me, but I look at it realistically. They got two great players [Hill and McGrady] instead. So, hopefully, they won’t miss as many shots, and they won’t need that much rebounding. You never know who will step up in my place. Maybe I was just getting in somebody’s way.”\n\nHow he has no bitterness towards the Magic:\n\n“There is no bitterness toward the Magic. It was just business on both sides. Last season was special, everyone with one goal and no egos. We just played hard every night. It was an exciting, emotional season. I’ll miss it, but I’ll show the fans in Detroit what I can bring to the table.”\n\nHow his rebounding will help the Pistons (via Detroit Free Press):\n\n“There’s no team in the league that can run the fast break if they don’t have the ball. Hopefully I can get some transitions going, do all the little things.”\n\nOn how he felt about leaving Orlando in a 2001 interview (via Orlando Sentinel):\n\n“I would have liked to stay in Orlando, but it was a business decision, and they just weren’t able to make the kind of offer that Detroit did. It was tough at first, but decisions had to be made. I think I’ve done OK.”\n\nChucky Atkins on signing with the Pistons (via Battle Creek Enquirer):\n\n“I’ve been here for a whole week waiting to get this done. I wanted to make sure that I go to a team that had the style of play that could work for me. The up-and-down style, the fast breaks, that was perfect for me because that’s my specialty. Talking to Joe (Dumars), that just pretty much sealed the deal, because he’s trying to rebuild a championship team.”\n\nOn his role:\n\n\"My role is to be a point guard. I want to be a pure point guard, get the ball to people when they need the ball, score when I’m called upon to score.”\n\nOn rookie point guard and teammate Mateen Cleaves:\n\n“I think he brings a lot to this team, and I do to, so that’s great. We’re going to have a young team. Joe’s trying to bring in some other young, active guys, so, you know, we’re going to grow up together.”\n\nOn the style of play being a good fit (via Detroit Free Press):\n\n“I’ve been waiting for it to get done. I feel a lot better now. I think this is a golden opportunity for me because they have an up-tempo style, which is suitable for me, and this is where I wanted to be.”\n\nOrlando Magic owner and RDV chairman Rich DeVos opening statement in introductory press conference (via Magic.com):\n\n“Well, we’ve had a lot of slogans around this team like ‘why not us, why not now.’ We used that line a long time ago, but it’s time to re-use it again because this is a special time for this franchise, this city, and for our team. I know we are going to pay a lot of attention to two wonderful young men here today, but I don’t want to neglect the wonderful team we had this past year as well. We have had an awesome bunch of young men on our team.\n\n“In my view, these guys came here because of what they represented and the message they sent as the kind of a team we had. So, the players are a part of a mix that made it possible for these guys to come and join us as well. So, to the guys that are here today, we want to congratulate you as well today because you are a part of setting this whole thing up. I don’t think I have ever had a more enjoyable year with a fine bunch of young men as we had this past year. So, thanks guys for a wonderful year.\n\n“I think some of the press used the ‘relaunching’ or the ‘new era’ that we are entering as a team and bringing on some new supportive talent. They add to what we’ve had and they make us a much, much better team. We’re happy to have these stars here, or I guess I would have to say superstars because I always thought we had stars; we have all stars on this team.\n\n“So, we’re honored today to welcome two special young men to our organization. We look forward to where we’re going. You must understand that when Gabe (John Gabriel) came to us as a family and talked to us about what we were going to do and how we were going to get there, the key mission was that we were not going to settle for mediocrity.\n\nHe said, ‘If you guys want to be mediocre, that’s ok. We can do a patch job and add a few players, or we can go and make some drastic changes and go for the gold.’ With Bob (Vander Weide)’s encouragement, and everyone else’s around here we decided to go all the way. We understood the gamble and we understood that we might have a dry year. We didn’t have a dry year.\n\n“But then we come to a day like this. I sometimes feel like I’m in church because what a day this is. What a day the Lord has made for us to be here together and to celebrate a new level of excellence that we’re looking for. No mediocrity, we’re going for the best. Adding to the mix that we had and enriching the whole flavor of this organization.\n\n“So our salute to Bob, to Gabe, and to all the staff people who have worked hard at it. Also to our family who said ‘we’ll take the risk that we might have a bad year.’ I didn’t work out that way, so the Lord blessed us again. Here we are with a relaunching, and it is our great tribute to Bob and to Gabe and to all the staff who led us to this point and was willing to take it on.“\n\nOn the choices made by McGrady and Hill:\n\n“For both of these guys this is the first time that they have had the freedom to make the choice where they wanted to play. That’s a very, very different situation. They chose us and we chose them. Now that’s the beginning of a very healthy marriage. It’s not a forced one, like on draft night, where that’s where you go and that’s where you go.\n\n“This is something where you say, ‘that’s where I want to be,’ and that changes the whole mindset of how people come together, wanting to make something happen, not just accepting what’s happened. I think that is what beings to set us for the continuation of the spirit that we have here and that Gabe (John Gabriel) put and Doc [Rivers] put in motion.”\n\nHow he and the Magic convinced Hill to sign (via Detroit Free Press):\n\n“We showed Grant who we were and what we are about.”\n\nHow he defines the 1999-00 Magic roster:\n\n“[Players] who don’t care about their own numbers, only how the team did…. We can put together a bunch of high-quality people who can win, even without superstars.”\n\nOn teams that are small markets:\n\n“There’s an ebb and flow of teams. Stars want to catch a team that’s on the way up. Would Grant have come to us two years ago? No. The Pistons have had their championships, they’ve got to go through some dry years.”\n\nMagic general manager John Gabriel opening statements in press conference (via Magic.com):\n\n“I would like to echo the excitement on behalf of the entire organization that we bring to you these two new players today. But I think our owner is being a little bit too modest. Without Rich (DeVos) and his family and ownership, and Bob Vander Weide’s commitment and courage to take some major risks without a safety net, we would not be here today. It was all of fifteen months ago that we started this project, this relaunching, but it was an enjoyable one.\n\n“I think we all would say that. We enjoyed last year very, very much. The month of July was a little tough to go through as we all sat and waited, but we are all so proud of the job our entire staff did. Thanks to our coaches, who have not taken a day off, including the real coach of the year Doc Rivers.\n\n“A special thanks for the cooperation of two people who should be recognized; Arn Tellem who represents Tracy (McGrady), Mr. Lon Babby for all of his work and cooperation in getting this done. The impact on the floor that these two young men will make will be immediate. We have two new go-to guys to go with our heart and hustle team.\n\n“But the thing that we are all so excited about is that you will feel these two young men’s presence in our community, and their commitment to the community, and their contributions to Central Florida immediately as well.”\n\nOn the team’s goal in free agency:\n\n“Our vision was to bring the best basketball players, the best basketball players we could through free agency to this organization. And we got the two best players in free agency brought to this organization. Mission accomplished.”\n\nOn how far the franchise has come after making so many changes to the roster in the previous year:\n\n“It feels great. We all were concerned a little bit 14 months ago. When you break something apart when you have such stability in guys like Nick Anderson and Horace (Grant) that were here a long long time, you never know for sure what your next step is going to look like. But Doc got a young group of players to embrace his style, to accept him, to trust him, and just take us on a ride that we haven’t been exposed to here in a long long time.\n\n“That was that each and every night, that team was going to play hard. Our fans wanted that, and I think really appreciated it. To bring everything to a conclusion with the acquisition of these two players, I don’t think we could have dreamed of a better result.”\n\nOn having so many different players on the roster in the previous year:\n\n“I’m not doing it again, I’ll tell you that. In some scouting reports, though, we knew a little about people because we had so many of them on our team already. But you go through this once in a basketball lifetime.”\n\nOn why the team chose to acquire Hill and McGrady in sign-and-trade deals:\n\n“It really didn’t affect us, the cap room didn’t. It was a deal in doing sign-and-trades with both Toronto and Detroit everyone came out winners and I think we also were capable of being consistent with our past in regards to our compensation of players. We wanted the situations that would pay them the most and that is what we chose.”\n\nDetroit Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars on adding Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins (via Detroit Free Press):\n\n“We brought in a young point guard who can flat-out push the ball up the court, and we brought in an awesome rebounder and shot blocker. You have to feel better about it as a team, but you don’t stop there. It’s just a couple of pieces to the puzzle.”\n\nHow the sign-and-trade element of the deal worked out:\n\n“We talked to Orlando a couple of times about it, and their initial reaction was that they would be fine without a sign-and-trade in terms of whatever Grant was looking for. Yesterday, they called and said they would be willing to do a sign-and-trade. For us, it was nice. By doing a sign-and-trade, we are officially over the salary cap, and that’s the only way you can have your $2.25-million exception. It gives us a little more flexibility to keep looking for more players.”\n\nMagic head coach Doc Rivers’ opening statement in introductory press conference of Hill and McGrady (via Magic.com):\n\n“First of all, thanks to the family. John Gabriel, I don’t think, gets enough credit. He had to take a risk on me - a coach who had no experience. Then he had to tell a coach who had no experience that he was going to tell all the players with a lot of experience that they were leaving, and it worked. So thanks to John and the family. But the one point I want to make today is that this is not the end, it’s the beginning. This is just the beginning. We have more players now, and now we need to play.\n\n“We have somewhere we want to go, we know where that is, and we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of meshing to do. There is a chance that we will have up to five different players on this basketball team. But it’s a challenge that I think we are all looking forward to. Really, I can’t wait for it to get started.”\n\nOn how the additions of Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady will impact the team:\n\n“Not much at all really. I think, hopefully, we’ll be fun to watch win. As fun as we were last year, and we were, we had just great guys and great players. We still have those in place and I think that we’ve just added to it. Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady are good basketball players, we all know that, but I think what people keep missing is that they are good people and they just mix in with what we have. It’s what we were looking for.\n\n“I think we were fortunate this year and Gabe (John Gabriel) brought it up one day that this is a free agent crop, this summer, of not only great players, but great people. So that mixes with what we are trying to do, so I am really looking forward to it.”\n\nOn how far the team has come:\n\n“It’s gratifying, but we’re not done. Maybe I’m getting competitive all of a sudden now that the ink is dry. I’m thinking more of where we want to go. The bottom line is we want to be the winner some day. We don’t want to just do a lot of winning. I’ve said that for a year now and that will be what I will continue to say until we are the winner.”\n\nOn the vast amount of roster changes in the past year:\n\n“I remember in the summer league, we thought about doing the name tag thing. Then after summer league when we got to pro camp it was the same thing. I don’t know how many people could have pulled that off. That was John. He had to do all the transactions. He had the late nights. Some of those late nights he was probably thinking about what he was going to tell me about his latest transaction. But, it’s amazing how it has come about and how it has worked out.”\n\nOn what positions Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady will fill on the team:\n\n“I won’t have a position. I’ll call them basketball players. You can probably ask any coach in the NBA right now, ‘If you had Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill right now, would that be a problem?’ and I would say that most of them would say, ‘No.’\n\n“I understand the question. The question is who is the two and who is the three and they can be called whatever they want to be, two or three, it’s up to them. Again, it’s just playing basketball and that is how I am going to look at it. I understand that, I’ve had that a lot. But, I think that they are both twos and they are both threes and I think that is what makes it so special.”\n\nDetroit Pistons Coach George Irvine on losing Grant Hill (via Port Huron Times Herald):\n\n“We still have some work to do. Losing Grant Hill, that’s a big loss. We’re not trying to fill Grant’s shoes… What we are trying to do is improve at every position.”\n\nOn the new Pistons:\n\n“We’re not a big, strong, physical team. I think both these guys coming in, Ben [Wallace] in particular, you got to just look at him to see that he’s a physical player. He’s tough, there’s no doubt about it. Chucky’s a little different. He’s a little guy in size, but he’s tough mentally, they both are.”\n\nOn Ben Wallace (via Detroit Free Press):\n\n“Ben is the kind of player that helps you win games. We lacked a real physical player last season, and all you have to do is look at Ben and you see a tough, physical presence. He’ll allow us to play different combinations together, where last year it was difficult to play certain combinations.”\n\nOn Chucky Atkins:\n\n“Chucky is very quick, a good shooter. He will be able to guard, you know we’re going to play up-tempo. I’m happy with him.”\n\nFrom CNNSI.com\n\nImage Credit:\n\nGrant Hill: Image via NBAE/Gary Bassing\n\nBen Wallace: Image via Getty Images/Ray Amati"
