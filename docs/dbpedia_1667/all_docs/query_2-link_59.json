Golden State played just one game without its versatile forward this season—a regular-season loss to the Nuggets—and will have a tough time making up for its emotional leader's absence.\n\nWith Green suspended and the Splash Brothers yet to explode against the Cavaliers, there isn't an obvious pick for Finals MVP despite the Warriors' 3–1 advantage. Andre Iguodala, last year's Finals MVP, has turned in another strong showing against LeBron James and Co. Klay Thompson has been solid on both ends despite failing to catch fire. And Stephen Curry finally came on strong in Game 4, scoring 38 points in a decisive win.\n\nWith so much uncertainty around this year's race, SI.com paneled its NBA experts and asked: Who should win 2016 NBA Finals MVP?\n\n• MORE NBA: Should Draymond Green have been suspended for Game 5?\n\n​\n\nWho should win 2016 NBA Finals MVP?\n\nBen Golliver: Andre Iguodala. I give the nod to Golden State's sixth man, who just so happens to be the reigning Finals MVP, because of his consistency and positive impact across the four games and because Draymond Green, the other leading candidate, was tagged with a one-game suspension for Game 5. Tasked first with limiting LeBron James, Iguodala has done an exceptional job, regularly poking the ball loose from James, contesting his shots, denying him clear paths to the basket, and keeping him off the free throw line. Cleveland's hopes in this series required an A or A+ level performance from James, and Iguodala is a major reason why James has been close to a B or B+ to date. It's not just the defense: Iguodala's passing and playmaking ability has been a key to Golden State's offense throughout this series. His 4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio speaks to his excellent decision-making, and he has often picked apart Cleveland's aggressive defense by finding cutters. Add it all up, and Iguodala is a team-best +54 through four Finals games, easily topping Draymond Green (+36) and Stephen Curry (+12). Honestly, I might be swayed into the Curry camp if he follows up his 38-point performance in Game 4 with title-delivering brilliance on Monday. For now, though, Iguodala is the guy.\n\n• MORE NBA: Lee Jenkins: The birth of the Warriors' Death Lineup\n\nRob Mahoney: Andre Iguodala. Were it not for his suspension, I would’ve picked Draymond Green—the Warriors’ most essential overall defender, their most effective center, a leading playmaker (5.8 assists per game in the Finals), and competitive rebounder no matter how much size he gives up. Yet the thought that Green will miss Game 5 can’t help but tip the scales when that single game could amount to 20% of the completed series. Iguodala seems the next-best choice. Things could still shake up if the series extends or if Stephen Curry closes out in spectacular fashion, though to this point it’s hard to work around the stellar two-way play of Iguodala. His matchup with LeBron James is only the beginning; Iguodala has deftly switched around to cover all kinds of opponents and found ways to stay near enough to the action to disrupt it. He isn’t scoring in volume, though the offense runs more smoothly in his presence due to his timely drives, back-breaking shooting, and eager facilitation. Give the man his due and another piece of hardware.​\n\nGallery: Sports Illustrated's 100 best NBA Finals photos over the years\n\n100 Best NBA Finals Photos\n\n2016\n\nLeBron James holds up the shiny gold trophy in what might be his sweetest championship yet, the one he is so proudly bringing home to his native northeast Ohio just as he promised to do when he returned to the Cavaliers two summers earlier.\n\n2015\n\nLeBron James loses the ball as he tries to fend off Andre Iguodala in Game 1 between the Warriors and Cavaliers. Golden State won the game and the series 4-2. Iguodala became the first player to win the Finals MVP award without having started every game in the series. He was tasked with guarding LeBron, who made only 38.1 percent of his shots when Iguodala was in the game.\n\n2015\n\nSteph Curry goes to the left hand against J.R. Smith to score two of his 25 points in Game 6. The Warriors defeated the Cavs 105-97 to clinch the franchise's first NBA title since 1975.\n\n2014\n\nA year after an excruciating loss to the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, Tim Duncan and the Spurs got their revenge, winning the title in five games.\n\n2013\n\nRay Allen lets loose a series-changing three over Tony Parker in Game 6. With Miami down 3-2 in the series, it was the veteran Allen who sent the game to overtime and an eventual Heat victory. With a huge momentum boost, Miami went on to win the series.\n\n2013\n\nLeBron James led Miami to the finals for a third straight year and to a second consecutive title, duking it out with the Spurs for seven games. James won his second Finals MVP award with another series of stellar showings.\n\n2012\n\nLeBron James soars over Kevin Durant in Game 3. James got the championship monkey off his back in a big way, averaging 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists in the series.\n\n2012\n\nLeBron James battled cramps in Game 4 and was unable to finish out a 104-98 Heat victory. He still had 26 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists.\n\n2011\n\nDirk Nowitzki avoids traffic to drop in the game-winner for Dallas in Game 2. Nowitzki's clutch shot capped a furious 15-point fourth-quarter Mavs comeback. Dallas would knock off favored Miami and the \"Big Three\" of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in six games in a rematch of the 2006 Finals.\n\n2010\n\nKobe Bryant looks to shoot over Rajon Rondo in Game 6 between the Lakers and Celtics. Kobe averaged 29 points per game in the series, en route to his second consecutive Finals MVP award.\n\n2010\n\nKevin Garnett bodies a driving Kobe Bryant in a tight Game 7. The Celtics-Lakers rivalry was renewed in a back-and-forth series that saw Los Angeles come out on top for a second straight title.\n\n2010\n\nPau Gasol owned the paint in Game 7 with 19 points and 18 rebounds to push the Lakers to an 83-79 win.\n\n2009\n\nPau Gasol hugs Kobe Bryant near the end of a series-clinching Game 5. The duo was crucial to L.A.'s five-game victory over Orlando, with Bryant named Finals MVP and winning his first title out of Shaquille O'Neal's shadow.\n\n2008\n\nAveraging nearly 22 points per game, Finals MVP Paul Pierce paired with offseason acquisitions Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to return the Celtics to their championship ways against the rival Lakers. The win marked the first title for each of the three stars.\n\n2007\n\nSan Antonio's Tony Parker was named Most Valuable Player of the series, averaging 24.5 points per game in the sweep.\n\n2007\n\nTim Duncan and the Spurs spoiled LeBron James' first Finals, limiting him to 35.6% shooting and efficiently sweeping the series.\n\n2006\n\nDwyane Wade, at just 24 years old, catalyzed the Heat past Dallas in six, memorably scoring 42 points and leading a comeback from a 13-point deficit with six minutes left in Game 3. The series marked Wade's arrival as a superstar, as he averaged nearly 35 points and eight rebounds per game to lead Miami to its first title.\n\n2005\n\nBen Wallace and Manu Ginobili battle for a loose ball in Game 5 between the Pistons and Spurs. The past two NBA champs traded blows in a tough series that went seven games, with San Antonio coming out on top.\n\n2005\n\nRobert Horry, better known as \"Big Shot Rob,\" buries the three to win Game 5 for San Antonio.\n\nTim Duncan drives to basket against Rasheed Wallace in Game 7 between the Spurs and Pistons. Duncan scored a game-high 25 points and 11 rebounds as he led San Antonio to their third title and won his third Finals MVP award.\n\n2004\n\nShaquille O'Neal of the Lakers and Rasheed Wallace of the Pistons grapple for a rebound. Detroit impressively dispatched L.A.'s O'Neal-Kobe Bryant tandem in five games.\n\n2004\n\nChauncey Billups hoists the trophy as the Pistons celebrate their championship. With a penchant for making shots in critical moments, Billups was named Finals MVP.\n\n2003\n\nDavid Robinson of the Spurs dunks on Jason Collins of the Nets in Game 5. San Antonio took the series in six games, with Robinson teaming up with the core of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili winning their first title together.\n\n2003\n\nFinals MVP Tim Duncan came up huge for San Antonio in the Game 6 series-clincher with 21 points, 20 boards, 10 assists and eight blocks.\n\n2002\n\nShaquille O'Neal and the Lakers blew away the Jason Kidd-led Nets in a four-game sweep. O'Neal averaged more than 36 points per game as L.A. took home a third straight title.\n\n2001\n\nShaquille O'Neal was simply too much for Philadelphia to handle in the series, winning his second straight Finals MVP honors and contributing a near quadruple-double in Game 2 with 28 points, 20 rebounds, nine assists and eight blocks.\n\n2001\n\nKobe Bryant of the Lakers avoids 76ers center Dikembe Mutombo in Game 4. Though still overshadowed by Shaquille O'Neal, the 22-year-old Bryant continued to shine in his own right, averaging nearly 25 points for the series.\n\n2001\n\nSixers guard Allen Iverson dribbles the ball against Tyronn Lue of the Lakers during Game 1. Bolstered by the dynamic Iverson's 48 points, Philadelphia pulled off an upset, 107-101.\n\n2000\n\nRon Harper of the Lakers shoots over Pacers center Rik Smits in Game 4.\n\n2000\n\nReggie Miller averaged more than 24 points per game, but couldn't shoot Indiana past Shaq and the Lakers in what would be the only Finals appearance of his career.\n\n2000\n\nKobe Bryant drives to the basket against Dale Davis and Reggie Miller in Game 6 between the Lakers and Pacers.\n\n2000\n\nShaq and Kobe celebrate after winning Game 6 against the Pacers for the championship.\n\n1999\n\nSpurs center David Robinson blocks Marcus Camby of the Knicks in Game 4. San Antonio, led by Robinson and a young Tim Duncan, took up the mantle post-Jordan and defeated the Knicks in five games for its first title.\n\n1999\n\nMarcus Camby of the Knicks blocks Spurs guard Avery Johnson in Game 3. Johnson would have the last laugh, hitting a last-minute shot to close out New York in Game 5.\n\n1998\n\nMichael Jordan drains the game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell of the Utah Jazz in Game 6. It would be MJ's last shot as a Bull, but not his last in the NBA — he unretired, of course, in 2001.\n\n1997\n\nKarl Malone of the Jazz dunks over Dennis Rodman and Ron Harper of the Bulls in Game 1. Malone and point guard John Stockton posed a challenge to the Bulls with their efficiency, but Michael Jordan and company found ways to win yet again.\n\n1997\n\nGame 5, which came to be known as \"The Flu Game,\" saw Michael Jordan compete through severe illness to come up big for Chicago. Jordan brought the Bulls back from a 16-point deficit, improbably scoring 38 points in a 90-88 win after spending much of the past 24 hours confined to his hotel bed. At the end of the game, Jordan collapsed into Scottie Pippen's arms in what became an iconic moment.\n\n1997\n\nIn Game 6, it wasn't Jordan or Pippen (though they combined for 62 points) but rather Bulls guard Steve Kerr who sealed Chicago's fifth title, with a 17-footer.\n\n1996\n\nDennis Rodman grabs a rebound against the Sonics in Game 1. Rodman averaged nearly 14 boards per game in the playoffs for the Bulls, who acquired the power forward from San Antonio before the season.\n\n1996\n\nScottie Pippen of the Bulls and Sam Perkins of the Sonics battle for a rebound. Pippen led Chicago in assists on the series, and the Bulls took their fourth championship, emboldened by Jordan's return from a two-year retirement.\n\n1995\n\nHakeem Olajuwon averaged nearly 33 points on the series to bolster the Rockets to a second straight title in a four-game sweep.\n\n1995\n\nClyde Drexler scored 25 points in a Game 3 win that all but sealed the series.\n\n1994\n\nHakeem Olajuwon was named Finals MVP, averaging nearly 33 points for the series to bolster the Rockets to their first title, in a four-game sweep.\n\n1994\n\nStar centers Hakeem Olajuwon of the Rockets and Patrick Ewing of the Knicks duked it out in 1994 in a series that went seven games.\n\n1994\n\nIn Game 6, Olajuwon blocked a potential game-winning three by Knicks guard John Starks to secure the win and send the series to a final game.\n\n1993\n\nMichael Jordan battles Suns guard Kevin Johnson beneath the hoop.\n\n1993\n\nSuns star Charles Barkley celebrates Phoenix's Game 5 win. Though \"Sir Charles\" averaged 27.3 points and 13 rebounds, it wasn't enough to lift the Suns past Chicago. Years later, he would admit the series made him realize Jordan was the superior player.\n\n1993\n\nScottie Pippen of the Bulls drives to the basket against the Suns. Pippen averaged 21.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 7.7 assists in the series.\n\n1992\n\nMichael Jordan and the Bulls appeared in their second Finals to face Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers. The debate about who was better between MJ and Clyde was effectively silenced as Jordan hit six first-half threes in Game 1, famously shrugging at the broadcast table after hitting the sixth one. Jordan's dominance set the tone for the series.\n\n1991\n\nMichael Jordan skies for a dunk over Lakers center Vlade Divac in Game 2, a 107-86 Chicago win. Jordan scored 33 points on 15-of-18 shooting, including his famous hand-switching layup to lead the Bulls.\n\n1991\n\nWith his parents at his side, Michael Jordan holds the Chicago Bulls' first-ever championship trophy after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in five games.\n\n1990\n\nJoe Dumars of the Pistons defends Terry Porter of the Trail Blazers in Game 1. The backcourt of Isiah Thomas (27.6 points per game) and Dumars (20.6) propelled Detroit to the championship in five games. Vinnie Johnson hit the series-clinching jumper at the end of Game 5.\n\n1989\n\nPistons forward Dennis Rodman snatches a board against the Lakers. Detroit ended L.A.'s bid for a third straight title with a four-game sweep after Magic Johnson injured his hamstring early in Game 2.\n\n1988\n\nA new challenger emerged from the Eastern Conference as Detroit's \"Bad Boys,\" starring point guard Isiah Thomas took on the Lakers. With Detroit up 3-2 going into Game 6, Thomas scored 25 gritty third-quarter points playing on a sprained ankle. It wouldn't be enough — L.A. won Game 6 103-102, with 28 points from James Worthy.\n\n1988\n\nIn Game 7 James Worthy (42) again shouldered the load for Los Angeles, recording a triple-double with 26 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists to secure another Lakers title and Finals MVP accolades.\n\n1987\n\nBoston, L.A., Bird and Johnson would meet in the Finals for the last time in 1987. Los Angeles won in six games with the core of Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar and Worthy again proving to be the cream of the crop.\n\n1987\n\nMagic Johnson drains his famous junior sky hook over Robert Parish and Kevin McHale to win Game 4 for the Lakers at the buzzer. Johnson was named Finals MVP.\n\n1986\n\nLarry Bird battles Hakeem Olajuwon under the hoop. The Celtics would win their second title in three straight finals appearances, paced by the dominant Bird (24 points, 9.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game), who posted a triple-double in the series-clinching Game 6.\n\n1985\n\nRival stars Magic Johnson of the Lakers and Larry Bird of the Celtics battle beneath the rim in Game 1 of the 1985 Finals. L.A. pulled the series out in six games thanks to vintage play from 37-year-old Kareem Abdul Jabbar.\n\n1984\n\nKevin McHale of the Celtics delivers an extremely hard foul on Lakers forward Kurt Rambis in Game 4. The Boston-Los Angeles rivalry was reignited with an epic seven-game clash between the teams.\n\n1984\n\nLos Angeles forward James Worthy rises to score over Boston's Larry Bird during a 119-108 Game 6 Lakers victory.\n\n1983\n\nJulius Irving of the Sixers soars to the rim in their third finals matchup with the Lakers in four seasons. This time Philadelphia would prevail in a four-game sweep.\n\n1983\n\nFinals MVP Moses Malone was dominant in Philadelphia's sweep of Los Angeles, averaging 25.8 points and 18 rebounds per game while outplaying L.A. center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n1982\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Lakers squared off against Julius Erving and the Sixers in a rematch of the 1980 finals. The Lakers once again prevailed in six games.\n\n1982\n\nMagic Johnson attacks the hoop against the Sixers.

The Lakers went on to lose that game and dropped the series to New York, 4-3.\n\n1969\n\nSam Jones of the Celtics dribbles around Jerry West of the Lakers.

St. Louis.\n\n1949\n\nLakers center George Mikan (99) gets his hair mussed by teammates after leading Minneapolis to its first-ever championship. Mikan set a Madison Square Garden scoring record with 48 points in a 101-74 victory over the Knickerbockers. The Lakers' 101 points also set an all-time team high scoring mark at the Garden.\n\nMatt Dollinger: Stephen Curry. If Andre Iguodala claims his second straight Finals MVP, he could have a strong case for Springfield, but I've got a feeling Stephen Curry steals the hardware from his deserving teammate. As much as this has been the season of the Warriors, it's also been a coronation of Curry. He won his second straight MVP—and the first unanimous selection in league history. He led his team to 73 wins. He cemented his status as the best player in the league. And he reinvented the way the game is played on the perimeter. Could voters be swayed into a \"lifetime achievement\" award for Curry's 2015–16 showing? Curry proved to be an effective decoy in the first two games of the Finals. Then he dropped 38 in a critical Game 4 win. It'd only be fitting for Curry to piggy-back off that momentum and explode one more time at Oracle Arena. A fire has been lit under the Warriors after Draymond Green's suspension. Can't you see Curry putting the Warriors on his back and torching the Cavaliers to finish them off? Curry started the Finals off slow, but the stage is set for a grand finale.\n\n​​\n\nDeAntae Prince: Klay Thompson. Stephen Curry has endured multiple injuries, violent swings from game to game and rare bouts with poor shooting in the Finals. Draymond Green, the Warriors' emotional leader, let his emotions get the best of him when tested by LeBron James in an obvious attempt to rid Golden State of one of its best players. Through this all, Klay Thompson has been a rock for the Warriors. While others, like Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, have stepped up and embraced the moment, Thompson has been the most consistent Warrior this postseason. If his Game 5 mirrors the 25–point performance before it and the Warriors close out without Green, Thompson could step to the forefront for Golden State.\n\n• MORE NBA: The Architect: Meet the man who built the Warriors"
