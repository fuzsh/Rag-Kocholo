        "text": "On this day in 1988, former Boston Celtics big man Luke Cameron Harangody was born in Decatur, Illinois.\n\nHarongody would play his college ball with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he won three consecutive Second Team All-American honors between 2008 and 2010, winning Big East Player of the Year in 2008 before being selected 52nd overall by the Celtics in the 2010 NBA draft, signing a two-year deal with the team in August of that year. He would debut against the Detroit Pistons in November, playing 49 games for the team before being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with center Semih Erden for draft assets.\n\nIt is also the date of the trade that sent Celtic guard Michael John \"Red\" Wallace to the (now defunct) Toronto Huskies for guard Charlie Hoefer. Wallace had been one of the Celtics signed to the team in its inaugural season of 1946-47 even before there was a draft to be taken in, playing 85 games for Boston over two seasons, averaging 5.5 points per game.\n\nCharlie Hoefer - Boston Celtics/file\n\nHoefer also played parts of two seasons with the Celtics, though just 42 games in which he put up 5.3 points per game.
