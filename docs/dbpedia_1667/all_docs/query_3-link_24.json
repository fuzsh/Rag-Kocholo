        "text": "DALLAS -- The jaw-dropping baskets by Tracy McGrady were expected. The clutch baskets by Mike James and Jon Barry? Well, that's why McGrady feels so good about his chances of finally winning a playoff series.\n\nThe Auburndale star scored the majority of his 34 points during the first three quarters to help the Houston Rockets build a big lead, then James and Barry helped protect the shrinking margin in the final period, preserving a 98-86 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the firstround series Saturday.\n\n\"I feel this is my time,\" said McGrady, who also had six assists and five rebounds. \"I'm more confident than ever.\"\n\nMcGrady's early heroics, highlighted by a long 3-pointer with the shot clock about to expire and Dirk Nowitzki's hand in his face, helped Houston take a 19point lead early in the second quarter. The Rockets were up by double-digits until the closing minutes of the third, then Dallas got to 75-71 with 9:16 left.\n\nJames, who played on Detroit's championship team last season, scored Houston's next three baskets with two jumpers and a wild layup around Nowitzki. Barry followed with a 3-pointer and the Rockets were back up 84-73 and just 5:52 to play.\n\nJames finished with 16 points, and Barry had 8. Nowitzki led Dallas with 21.\n\n----------------\n\nHOUSTON (98) -- McGrady 14-27 3-3 34, Bowen 2-7 0-0 4, Yao 3-8 5-6 11, Sura 3-6 2-2 8, Wesley 4-6 0-0 9, Barry 3-7 0-0 8, Mutombo 1-3 6-7 8, James 713 2-2 16, Padgett 0-1 0-0 0.

But they hit 20 of their 31 shots the rest of the half and led 57-31 at intermission.\n\nLaFrentz led the Celtics with 21 points and broke the record for 3pointers set by Scott Wedman in Game 1 of the 1985 NBA finals, won by the Los Angeles Lakers.

(22,076).\n\nShaq Unsure if He'll Play\n\nMIAMI -- Saying his bruised right thigh still hampers his mobility, Miami center Shaquille O'Neal returned to practice Saturday -yet was coyly noncommittal about whether he'll be playing when the Heat open their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series today against the New Jersey Nets.\n\nO'Neal was injured a week ago and hadn't been on the court since. Miami coach Stan Van Gundy said he expects O'Neal, who missed the last two regular-season games, to play in today's Game 1 against the Nets.\n\nThe 12-time All-Star sounded less certain.\n\n\"You've got to start off in the right way,\" O'Neal said. \"I've never missed a playoff game, I don't think. This is the first time where I'm going in iffy-iffy.\"\n\nO'Neal still is undergoing multiple treatments daily to alleviate pain and swelling in the leg. If O'Neal cannot play, then former Nets center Alonzo Mourning -who asked out of New Jersey since he did not consider the team to be a championship contender -- is Miami's probable starter."
