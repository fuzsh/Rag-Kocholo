Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are one of three active NBA teams that trace its lineage to the founding of the Basketball Association of America in 1946, but unlike the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, the Warriors didn’t remain in their original location.\n\nThe Philadelphia Warriors were begun by minor-league hockey club owner Peter Tyrrell and the franchise spent its first 16 seasons in the City of Brotherly Love, playing its home games at the Philadelphia Arena throughout its stay, while also playing in the newer Philadelphia Convention Center at times from 1952-62.\n\nEddie Gottlieb, the team’s first coach and general manager, purchased the team from Tyrrell in 1952 until he sold it to a group of Bay Area investors led by Franklin Mieuli, who moved the team to San Francisco in 1962.\n\nThe San Francisco Warriors played … just about everywhere.\n\nThey were at the Cow Palace for their first two seasons, spent two seasons playing at both the San Francisco Civic Auditorium (now known as the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium) and Memorial Gym on the campus of the University of San Francisco before returning to the Cow Palace in 1966.\n\nIn 1971, the Warriors moved across the bay to the Oakland Coliseum Arena (now known as Oracle Arena) and were renamed the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThat’s been their home since, except for the 1996-97 season, when they played at the San Jose Arena while Oakland Coliseum Arena was being renovated and rechristened The Arena in Oakland.\n\nThe Warriors have won four titles, two each in Philadelphia and Golden State. The Warriors won the initial BAA championship in 1947, defeating the Chicago Stags in six games and took down the Fort Wayne Pistons in five games to win the NBA title in 1956.\n\nGolden State swept the favored Washington Bullets to capture the championship in 1975, but it would be a 40-year wait to get back to the Finals. The Warriors topped the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the 2015 NBA title.\n\nPhiladelphia lost in the Finals to the Baltimore Bullets in 1948, while the San Francisco version of the Warriors lost to the Celtics in 1964 and to the Philadelphia 76ers in 1967.\n\nIn 2015-16, however, the Golden State edition of the Warriors learned that history is a fickle mistress.\n\nAfter going 68 seasons without a 60-win season, Golden State upped the ante last season with an NBA-record 73-9 regular season.\n\nBut as Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus told Keanu Reeves’ Neo in The Matrix, “Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.”\n\nThis record-setting unit ended its season making the wrong kind of history, becoming the first team in NBA Finals history to lose after taking a 3-1 lead.\n\nThe franchise is 2,590-2,884 in its 70 seasons, with its .473 winning percentage ranking 20th among the 30 active teams in the NBA.\n\nThe club has made 32 playoff appearances in 70 years and has topped the 60-win plateau twice–the last two seasons.\n\nThere have been seven 60-loss seasons, but the worst winning percentage came in 1952-53, when Philadelphia finished 12-57 (.174).\n\nThe record for most losses in a season came in 2000-01 when the Warriors were 17-65. The team was 17-63 in 1964-65, 19-63 in 1997-98 and 1999-2000, 20-62 in 1987-88, 21-61 in 2001-02 and 22-60 in 1984-85.\n\nThe six consecutive playoff appearances the Warriors had in Philadelphia at the start of the franchise remains the longest such streak in team history.\n\nBut Golden State had a stretch of 12 straight seasons, 1994-95 through 2005-06, without seeing the postseason.\n\nGottlieb served the longest as general manager, from the franchise’s inception in 1946 to August 1963. Bob Feerick had the position from August 1963 to June 1974, Al Attles was GM from June 1976 to May 1986 and Don Nelson served from December 1987 to February 1995.\n\nCurrent GM Bob Myers has been in his post since April 2012.\n\nThe Warriors have had two Executive of the Year winners, Dick Vertlieb in 1974-75 and Myers in 2014-15.\n\nAttles is the franchise’s winningest coach, going 557-518 in the regular season and 31-30 in the playoffs from 1970-83. Nelson was 422-443 and 14-21 in two stints, 1988-95 and 2006-10. Gottlieb went 263-318 and 15-17 from 1946-55.\n\nCurrent coach Steve Kerr was hired in May 2014 and is 140-24 in the regular season and 31-14 in the postseason, becoming the third Warrior coach to be named Coach of the Year in 2015-16.\n\nAlex Hannum was named in 1963-64 and Nelson won the honor in 1991-92.\n\nThe Warriors have had the No. 1 pick three times in their history, once in the lottery era.\n\nIn 1965, San Francisco selected Davidson’s Fred Hetzel. In 1980, Golden State went with Joe Barry Carroll from Purdue and in 1995, Maryland’s Joe Smith was the top pick.\n\nThey have picked second once, third six times and fifth six times. The Warriors have never had the No. 4 overall selection.\n\nHere are the 25 best players in the history of the Philadelphia/San Francisco/Golden State Warriors. Players had to have appeared in 150 games and averaged a minimum of 20 minutes per game for the team to qualify for this list.\n\n1988: Eric Sleepy Floyd #21 of the Golden State Warriors drives upcourt during an NBA game in the 1988-89 season.

Moved to small forward the following season and returned to the 4 spot in 1965-66, Meschery remained with the Warriors until he was left exposed to the expansion draft in May 1967.\n\nSelected by the Seattle SuperSonics, Meschery finished his career in the Northwest.\n\nIn six seasons in Philadelphia and San Francisco, Meschery averaged 12.9 points and 8.5 rebounds in 30.4 minutes per game, shooting 42.4 percent from the floor and 74.7 percent at the line. He does not appear on any of the franchise’s all-time leaderboards.\n\nHe spent four years with the Sonics before retiring after the 1970-71 season.\n\nIn September 1971, Meschery was hired to coach the ABA’s Carolina Cougars. He spent one season in that post, going 35-49 and missing the playoffs before resigning in April 1972.\n\nA renowned poet in retirement, Meschery taught high school English in Reno, Nev., until retiring in 2005, and his son, Matthew Meschery, is a former lead vocalist for the band OPM.\n\nNEW YORK, NY – APRIL 17: Retired basketball player Cazzie Russell attends the Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival Gala: ‘When The Garden Was Eden’ during the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival at BMCC Tribeca PAC on April 17, 2014 in New York City.

He was also part of their NBA championship club in 1970.\n\nHe was third in the league in free-throw shooting for Los Angeles in 1975-76.\n\nRussell was waived by Los Angeles in October 1977 and signed with the Chicago Bulls in January 1978.\n\nUnsigned after the 1977-78 season, Russell played the 1978-79 season in the Western Basketball Association and in 1980-81 in the Eastern Basketball Association before retiring.\n\nBasketball: Golden St. Warriors Latrell Sprewell #15 in action vs Utah Jazz.

Sprewell was also named both All-NBA and All-Defensive in 1993-94.\n\nHe was fourth in the NBA in three-pointers and led the league in minutes per game in 1993-94. He was third in minutes per game in 1994-95 and 1996-97, as well.\n\nBut his time with the Warriors came to an infamous and ignominious end when he was waived and suspended by the NBA for a year after choking coach P.J. Carlesimo during a Dec. 1, 1997, practice.\n\nAn arbitrator later reinstated his contract and reduced the suspension to the remainder of the 1997-98 season, but his time with the Warriors was done.\n\nIn January 1999, he was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\n\nIn parts of six seasons in Golden State, Sprewell averaged 20.1 points, 4.7 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 1.7 steals in 40.0 minutes per game, shooting .436/.332/.791.\n\nAn All-Star in 2001 with the Knicks, he also helped New York to the NBA Finals in 1999.\n\nSprewell was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in July 2003 as part of a four-team deal and wound up retiring after going unsigned as a free agent in the summer of 2005.\n\nHe is 10th in NBA history with an average of 38.6 minutes per game.\n\nBasketball: Golden State Warriors Bernard King (30) in action, jump ball vs New Jersey Nets Mike O’Koren (31) at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena.\n\nOakland, CA 12/3/1980\n\nCREDIT: Andy Hayt (Photo by Andy Hayt /Sports Illustrated/Getty Images)\n\n(Set Number: X25132 )\n\nBernard King\n\nSF, 1980-82\n\nBernard King had endured a turbulent season with the Utah Jazz, punctuated by a half-season suspension following his arrest in January 1980 on five felony charges, pleading guilty to lesser counts.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors took a chance on the talented but troubled small forward, acquiring him from the Jazz in September 1980 in exchange for Wayne Cooper and a second-round pick in 1981.\n\nKing was an All-Star in 1982 for the Warriors and an All-NBA selection in 1981-82.

Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAndre Iguodala\n\nSF, 2013-16\n\nAndre Iguodala was one of the premier free agents on the market after the 2012-13 season and it was the Golden State Warriors who landed him.\n\nAfter agreeing with the tenacious wing defender on a four-year, $48 million deal in July 2013, the Warriors acquired him via a sign-and-trade deal from the Denver Nuggets, also acquiring Kevin Murphy from the Utah Jazz.\n\nGolden State sent a 2018 second-round pick to the Nuggets while dispatching Brandon Rush, Richard Jefferson and Andris Biedrins along with first-round picks in 2014 and 2017 and second-rounders in 2016 and 2017 to Utah.\n\nIguodala was an All-Defensive selection in 2013-14 for the Warriors.\n\nBut the arrival of coach Steve Kerr in 2014 sent Iguodala’s career in a new direction as a sixth man.\n\nAs Golden State won its first championship in 40 years in 2015, Iguodala stole the show in the NBA Finals, becoming the first non-starter to earn Finals MVP honors.\n\nHe did start three of the six games in the victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.3 steals in 37.1 minutes per game while shooting .521/.400/.357.\n\nIguodala missed some time in 2015-16 with a sore hamstring and a sprained ankle, averaging 7.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.1 steals in 26.6 minutes per game on .478/.351/.614 shooting in his 65 games.\n\nHe wasn’t as big a factor in the Finals rematch with Cleveland, averaging 9.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 34.1 minutes per game, shooting .466/.304/3-for-9 and starting two of the seven games in the loss to the Cavs.\n\nIn three seasons with Golden State, Iguodala has averaged 8.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.3 steals in 28.5 minutes per game, shooting .474/.351/.623.\n\nHe opted to leave college after averaging 12.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game as a sophomore at Arizona.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers drafted the rangy swingman with the ninth overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft and he blossomed.\n\nHe was a first team All-Rookie selection in 2004-05, earned All-Defensive honors in 2010-11 and was an All-Star in 2012 while with the Sixers.\n\nIguodala led the NBA in minutes per game in 2008-09 and was fourth in steals in 2006-07.\n\nIn August 2012, he was part of a mammoth four-team trade that wound up with him in Denver.

Paul Arizin did that one better, becoming a star at the collegiate and pro levels after not playing high school basketball at all.\n\nSpotted in a Catholic Youth Organization game in Philadelphia, Arizin wound up making the team at Villanova … and then some. He was an All-American as a senior, averaging more than 25 points per game, and was the Philadelphia Warriors’ territorial selection in the 1950 NBA Draft.\n\nArizin was a 10-time All-Star in 12 years with the Warriors—missing only in the two seasons he was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.

The Warriors filed suit in a California court and got an injunction that prevented Barry from playing for Oakland until 1968.\n\nHe signed a future contract with the Warriors in August 1969 that would take effect at the end of his ABA deal in 1972.\n\nWhile in the ABA, he was a four-time All-Star and four-time All-ABA performer.
