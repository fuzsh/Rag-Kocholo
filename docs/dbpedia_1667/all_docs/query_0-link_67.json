        "text": "Marcus Merriweather scored 29 points for Shelton State while A.J. Lynch and Brandon Moss both scored 20. Jalen Houston added 10 points.\n\nAt the end of the first half, the Bucs led 52-44. As soon as the whistle blew in the second half, Shelton State took control of the game, maintaining a constant 20-point lead.\n\nJay Watkins scored 27 points to lead Gadsden State.\n\nShelton State will host Snead State at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.\n\nWoodlawn 53, Pinson Valley 43\n\n,\n\nGerald Maddox led the way with 15 points in the win for Woodlawn (16-7). Josh Murrell added 13 points and Quinterian McConico had nine points and eight blocks. Marcus Merriweather paced Pinson with 15 points.\n\nCenter Point 51, Pinson Valley 29\n\n,\n\nJust call the third quarter of Thursday’s game between Center Point and Pinson Valley the Jeff and Darreyl Show.\n\nAfter a first half in which the two teams exchanged more turnovers than field goals, Center Point’s Jeffrey Hodge and Darreyl Purnell combined to form a two-way force as the Eagles outscored the Indians by 21 points in the third quarter on their way to a 51-29 victory in the semifinals of the Jefferson County Large Schools Tournament at Gardendale.\n\nPlaying without leading scorer Michael Gilmore and his sprained right wrist, Center Point advances to face top-seed Clay-Chalkville in today’s 8 p.m. final.\n\nIn that third frame alone, Hodge scored 14 points, including three 3-pointers, and Purnell had five points and two emphatic blocks to help break open a one-point contest at halftime.\n\nThe Eagles (13-8, 4-1 Class 5A, Area 10) combined quick hands on defense, forcing four steals in the third quarter, and a fast-breaking offense to completely overmatch the sluggish Indians (14-11, 2-4). At one point during the period, Center Point came up with three steals on consecutive Pinson Valley possessions, scoring at the other end each time.\n\n“We came out slow,” Purnell said. “Everybody came out slow.”\n\nThen the second half rolled around. Purnell scored 10 of his 14 points over the final two quarters, sprinkling in all four of his blocks and a two-handed alley-oop dunk in traffic.\n\nHodge swished all three of his 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter and subbed out with a game-high 19 points.\n\n“He’s a great shooter,” Purnell said. “Once he shoots with confidence, he’s all right.”\n\nDemarco Herrod added 13 points for the Eagles, who led, 21-20, at halftime.\n\nMarcus Merriweather led a cold-shooting Indians team with nine points. Pinson Valley took a 10-4 lead midway through the first quarter but was outscored, 47-19, the rest of the way.\n\nPinson Valley 59, Gardendale 53\n\n,\n\nPinson Valley fell behind 22-8 at the end of the first quarter before rallying to beat the host Rockets in the first-round of the Jefferson County Tournament at Gardendale.\n\nCody Farley had 13 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Indians (14-10). Marcus Merriweather added 12 points. Nathan Sheffield scored 18 points and Juan Jackson 11 to lead Gardendale.\n\nWoodlawn 63, Pinson Valley 45\n\n,\n\nJames Thomas’ fingerprints were all over Friday night’s game at Woodlawn.\n\nThe 5-foot-8 senior’s numbers proved it: 10 points, six rebounds, eight assists and five steals.\n\nThe final score reinforced it. The Class 5A No. 5 Colonels blitzed their way to a 63-45 win over Pinson Valley.\n\nSo far so good for Thomas, who led the charge in just his third game for a new team. The Restoration Academy transfer recorded four of his five steals in the first quarter. His intensity was infectious.\n\n“That’s our mentality, defense,” Thomas said. “We don’t worry about scoring anymore.”\n\nAnd why would the Colonels (12-5, 3-2 Class 5A, Area 10) worry about scoring? Thomas’ bulldog play on defense led to easy looks for four quarters. Seemingly every other trip down the floor ended with a fast-break bucket, including alley-oop dunks for Woodlawn big men Quinterian McConico and Josh Murrell.\n\nA 14-all tie after one quarter turned into Woodlawn’s 39-26 advantage at halftime. Then, in the third quarter, the Colonels stuck to the same formula, exerting suffocating, full-court pressure and end-to-end defense.\n\nThe Indians (13-10, 2-3) couldn’t keep up. Cody Farley scored 18 points to lead the visitors, but he was hampered by foul trouble in the first half. By the time he checked back into the game, the Colonels had already left a cloud of dust in their wake.\n\nMcConico finished with 18 points and three blocks, while Gerald Maddox added 16 points for Woodlawn.\n\nBesides Farley, Marcus Merriweather had 11 points for Pinson Valley. No other Indian finished in double digits.\n\nCredit the Colonels for that. But most of all, credit Thomas, who started it all.\n\n“He brings a defensive mentality, a physical presence,” Woodlawn coach Demetrius Turner said. “Everything starts with the point guard. He’s like the head, and he sets the tone.”\n\nThompson 70, Pinson Valley 62\n\n,\n\nDemarcus Threatt had 23 points, six rebounds, five assists and five steals to lift Thompson (14-5). Jaylon Jones added 11 points and five rebounds for the Warriors, while Kevin Howard had 15 points for Pinson with Marcus Merriweather adding 14 and Cody Farley 12.\n\nPinson Valley 58, Pleasant Grove 55 (OT)\n\n,\n\nZach Jackson's 14 points led Pinson Valley (12-7), Cody Farley added 12 points and Marcus Merriweather added 11 points and eight assists. Victor Barnes led Pleasant Grove (5-13) with 19 points, KeJuan James had 18 and Barry Smith 16.\n\nA 25-point second half helped host Albertville secure a berth in Friday's WQSB Holiday Classic title game. Pinson Valley, which was ahead 22-21 at halftime, got 18 points from Cody Farley and 12 points from Marcus Merriweather. The Indians (10-7) will play John Carroll for third place.\n\nPinson Valley 72, Hewitt-Trussville 66 (OT)\n\n,\n\nCody Farley had 27 points and 11 rebounds while Marcus Merriweather added 26 points, including four 3-pointers, for Pinson Valley (8-6). Hewitt-Trussville put three players in double figures -- Jarvis Calhoun with 16, Ryan Dickey with 15 and Carr Tigner 12.\n\nShades Valley 63, Pinson Valley 45\n\n,\n\nShades Valley turned a 29-27 halftime deficit into a 52-35 lead with a 25-6 advantage in the third quarter on the way to beating visiting Pinson Valley. Nate Ward and Kimani Key scored 14 points each to lead the Mounties (6-6) while Jirus Horton and James Rivers contributed 10 points each. Kristian Horn and Kevin Howard led the Indians (6-6) with 12 points each and Marcus Merriweather had 11.\n\nPinson Valley 56, Gardendale 50\n\n,\n\nCody Farley scored 17 points and Marcus Merriweather added 16 to lead visiting Pinson Valley (7-4). Jeremy Gardner led Gardendale (3-5) with 16 points and Nathan Sheffield had 12.\n\nClay-Chalkville 65, Pinson Valley 47\n\n,\n\nClay-Chalkville got balanced scoring to pick up a victory. Dedric Barnes and Marcus Baldwin each scored 12 points and Cory Judkins added 11 for Clay-Chalkville (6-3). Baldwin also had seven rebounds to lead the winners. Marcus Merriweather had 13 points to lead Pinson Valley (8-4) while Cody Farley added 11.\n\nCenter Point 52, Pinson Valley 43\n\n,\n\nPinson Valley’s Cody Farley had eight points and six rebounds in the first quarter of Tuesday night’s contest at Center Point. But a sprained right ankle at the end of that opening frame limited him the rest of the way as the Eagles took the lead in the second quarter and never trailed again in a 52-43 victory over their class 5A rivals.\n\nMichael Gilmore scored seven of his 14 points in the fourth quarter to lead Center Point (2-6). Jeffrey Hodge added 13 points for the Eagles.\n\nThe Indians (6-4) dominated the glass in the early going, snagging six offensive rebounds in the first quarter on their way to a 14-13 lead after eight minutes.\n\nBut following the 6-foot-7 Farley’s injury, Center Point assumed the role of aggressor, both on the boards and with the ball in their hands.\n\n“Drive and kick, that’s all they did,” said Farley, who finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds. “We just weren’t in position.”\n\nWith the Eagles leading 45-36 and less than three minutes left, Gilmore drove from the top of the key and tossed in an acrobatic layup despite drawing a hard foul that sent him sprawling. He hit the ensuing free throw to extend the lead to 12, and Center Point held on from there.\n\nFor the Eagles, center Darryl Purnell scored all four of his points in the third quarter, but they came on a pair of rim-rocking dunks.\n\nKristian Horn had 12 points and 10 rebounds for Pinson Valley, while Marcus Merriweather finished with nine points.\n\nHewitt-Trussville 60, Pinson Valley 50\n\n,\n\nHewitt-Trussville scored 19 points in the fourth quarter to win at home. Jarvis Calhoun led Hewitt-Trussville (4-4) with 23 points. Ryan Dickey, Luke Davis and Carr Pigner each added nine points for the Huskies. Marcus Merriweather and Cody Farley each had 15 points to lead Pinson Valley (6-\n\nPinson Valley 75, Moody 63\n\n,\n\nDouble-doubles by Cody Farley and Kristian Horn along with 15 points by Kevin Howard and 12 points by Marcus Merriweather led host Pinson Valley (6-2). Farley had a game-high 26 points and 10 rebounds while Horn had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Moody's Josh Daniel scored 24 points, Anthony McMillan had 17 points and Justin Wilson added 10 points.\n\nGadsden City 62, Pinson Valley 56\n\n,\n\nJalan Strong's 17 points and a 19-12 fourth quarter advantage helped Gadsden City to a win at the Bryant Bank Thanksgiving Classic. Kevin Howard led Pinson Valley (4-2) with 20 points while Marcus Merriweather added 11 points with six assists.\n\nPinson Valley 61, Shades Valley 58\n\n,\n\nMarcus Meriweather and Kristian Horn each scored 16 points to pace Pinson Valley (2-1) while Cody Farley added 15 points. James Rivers topped Shades Valley with a game-high 18 points while Jirus Horton added 16 points.\n\nPleasant Grove 58, Pinson Valley 50\n\n,\n\nBarry Smith scored 25 points and Pleasant Grove outscored Pinson Valley 16-7 in the fourth quarter to claim the road win in the season opener for both teams. Victor Barnes added 12 points for the Spartans. Marcus Merriweather had 13 points and Kristian Horne 10 to lead the Indians.\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic 64\n\n,\n\nTyler Madison's putback on Ty Lollar's airball at the buzzer gave the Shelby County Wildcats (20-5) the Class 5A, Area 8 title at John Carroll. The Cavaliers' Marcus Merriweather had scored a basket with nine seconds remaining to tie the score 64-64. Lollar, the tournament MVP, led Shelby County with 23 points. Tae Lewis added 17 points and Jordan Simon 14. Andra Sledge's game-high 28 points led the Cavalierws (15-10) and Merriweather had 18.\n\nJohn Carroll 54, Chelsea 41\n\n,\n\nAndra Sledge scored 12 of his game-high 18 points in the second quarter to lead top-seeded John Carroll into the area finals. The Cavaliers (15-9) trailed 10-6 heading into the second quarter, but went on a 10-0 run midway through the quarter to take a lead they would never give up.\n\nBrandon Horton led Chelsea (11-18) with 14 points and Jake Ganus had 10. Marcus Merriweather chipped in 14 for John Carroll.\n\nHoly Family 56, John Carroll Catholic 51\n\n,\n\nDe'Ontaye Curtis had 16 points and Aaron Billingsley had 12 as Holy Family (15-11) edged John Carroll Catholic. Andra Sledge led John Carroll with 21 points and Marcus Merriweather added 18.\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic 67, Holy Family 64\n\n,\n\nChris Turk scored 21 points to lead a balanced attack as the Cavaliers (16-8) turned back the eighth-ranked Class 2A Tornadoes (11-8). John Carroll also got 10 points each from Antonio Hullum, Marcus Merriweather, Justin Coleman and Jalil Zinnerman. D.J. Mosley had 16 points, Petez Watts 13 and Deontaye Curtis 12 to pace Holy Family.\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic 54, Parkway Christian 52 (OT)\n\n,\n\nMarcus Merriweather hit two free throws with 15 seconds left in overtime to lift host John Carroll Catholic to a win over Parkway Christian (15-11), ranked No. 8 in Class 1A.\n\nParkway had forced the overtime period when Walter Arnold hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with 36 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nChris Turk led John Carroll with 24 points and nine rebounds while Merriweather added 12 points.\n\nArnold led Parkway with 24 points.

Sure, the Dragon had defeated John Carroll, their opponent in the Class 5A, Area 9 final, by 30 points two weeks ago.\n\nBut fresh in their mind was a three-point loss to the Cavs earlier in the season, the Dragons’ first loss of the season.\n\n“No big heads,” said Isaiah Maston.\n\n“Thirty-two minutes,” added Derrunya Wilson. “We had to play 32 minutes.”\n\nMaston and Wilson sparked a 17-0 run to end the third quarter and lead fourth-ranked Wenonah to a 67-43 win over John Carroll in the Class 5A, Area 9 final at Parker.\n\nWenonah will play host to Pinson Valley, who lost the Area 10 title to Woodlawn Monday night, in the subregional Friday night. John Carroll will travel to play Woodlawn.\n\nWilson had five of his game-high 17 points in the run and Maston had eight of his 15 points, including a pair of 3-pointers, that turned a slight 34-29 edge with 5:06 left in the quarter into a 54-29 domination by the time the quarter buzzer sounded.\n\n“We just came to play,” Wilson said. “I told them we had to go hard.”\n\nThe Cavaliers (18-10) had a couple of spurts of their own, pulling within 20-19 midway through the second quarter with a 10-1 run and getting within five with an 8-4 spurt to start the third quarter.\n\nBut each time the Dragons (26-4) answered. Wenonah ran off a 10-2 spurt to end the first half for a 30-21 lead, then bombarded the Cavaliers to end the third.\n\n“They are a fine team,” Cavaliers coach Larry Harbin said. “They play defense well and they rebound well. Size-wise we were a little mismatched.”\n\nWenonah finished with four players in double figures. Jeremy Bogus added 13 points and Chase Sadler had 11.\n\nChris Turk, who was hampered by foul trouble in the first half, led John Carroll with 14 points. Marcus Merriweather had 12 and Justin Coleman added 10.[\n\nShelby County 60, John Carroll 58\n\n,\n\nShelby County's Jordan Simon and Ty Lollar combined for 44 points as the Wildcats held off John Carroll in Class 5A, Area 8 action.\n\nThe Cavaliers (11-8, 5-1) fought back from a 45-31 deficit midway through the third period and took a 55-53 lead with 1:43 left in the game on Andra Sledge's two free throws. Shelby County tied it on a running 6-footer by Simon and took the lead for good on Tyler Madison's layup with 1:25 remaining.\n\nSimon put the Wildcats (13-4, 4-1) up 59-55 on two more free throws with 26.7 seconds left, but Sledge was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 5.7 seconds and nailed all three free throws. After Simon made the second of two free throws with 3.6 seconds left, Sledge couldn't get off a shot under heavy Wildcats pressure.\n\nSimon finished with 24 to Lollar's 20 while John Carroll's Sledge scored 28 points and Marcus Merriweather added 14.\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic 56, Briarwood Christian 42\n\n,\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic (11-7, 5-0 Class 5A Area 8) got 15 points from Marcus Merriweather, 13 from Andra Sledge and 10 from Jalil Zinnerman. Chad Davis led Briarwood Christian with 10 points.\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic 56, Chelsea 55\n\n,\n\nJohn Carroll Catholic closed the game on an 11-0 run that was finished off by a five-foot bank shot by freshman Marcus Merriweather as the Cavaliers edged host Chelsea. Andra Sledge led John Carroll (10-7, 4-0 Class 5A Area 8) with 24 points while Merriweather finished with 13. Jake Ganus scored 18 to pace Chelsea.\n\nJohn Carroll 59, Shelby County 58\n\n,\n\nAndra Sledge's layup as time expired lifted John Carroll over Shelby County. Ty Lollar gave Shelby County a 58-57 lead on a 3-pointer with five seconds remaining before Sledge drove the length of the court for the game-winner.\n\nSledge led the Cavaliers (9-7) with 17 points and Lollar led Shelby County with 17 points. Marcus Merriweather and Jalil Zinnerman each added 12 for John Carroll, and Jordan Simon scored 15 for Shelby County.\n\nJohn Carroll 44, Moody 43\n\n,\n\nMarcus Merriweather's two fourth-quarter 3-pointers sparked a John Carroll rally that overcame a six-point Moody lead. The host Cavaliers (6-2) sealed their victory when Kris McCord stole a Blue Devils inbound pass and dribbled away the game's remaining seconds. Merriweather finished with 12 points while teammate Andra Sledge had a game-high 19 points. Moody's Tyler Hamby had 14 points.\n\nJohn Carroll 53, Holy Spirit 49\n\n,\n\nDouble-figure scoring by Andra Sledge, Marcus Merriweather and Kameron Wood led host John Carroll (5-1) to its triumph over 10th-ranked Class 1A Holy Spirit (7-1). Sledge scored a game-high 16 points, Merriweather had 15 points while Wood scored 10 points and grabbed six rebounds.

Lynch and Cole Stockton had 14 points each for the Buccaneers. Lynch added five steals. Marcus Merriweather had 12 points, and Elliot Abraham eight rebounds.\n\nShelton State (1-0) hosts Birmingham-Southern's junior varsity at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.\n\nWallace State's basketball teams make huge statement with sweep over ranked Shelton State squads\n\nJanuary 28, 2014\n\nHANCEVILLE – Wallace State’s basketball teams made a resounding statement Monday night against rival Shelton State, sweeping the Bucs at home for first time since the 2009-10 season.\n\nMorgan Smith’s contested layup with 9.3 seconds left proved to be the game winner in a thrilling 62-61 victory for the Lady Lions in the opener, and sophomore Jestin Lewis poured in a season-high 31 points for the Wallace State men in the finale, lifting the Lions to a 92-85 victory at Tom Drake Coliseum.\n\nMuch seems to be at stake each time Wallace State plays Shelton State, but with the sweep, both Wallace State teams are now all alone atop the Alabama Community College Conference (ACCC) North Division. Adding to Monday’s significance, was the Wallace State men (18-4, 4-0) extending its winning streak to 11 games while snapping the Shelton State men’s 12-game streak.\n\nBeforehand, the Lady Lions won their 14th game in its 15 tries, defeating the previously once-beaten and fifth-ranked Lady Bucs, snapping their 18-game winning streak. Wallace State (18-3, 3-0 ACCC) also remained a perfect 10-0 at home.\n\n“It’s a big night for both programs and the Wallace State athletics program as a whole. Obviously the rivalry run deep, but it’s special when Wallace State can beat Shelton State twice in the same night. I told the guys before our game that a few years ago the state championship in each sport was decided between both teams,” said Wallace State men’s coach John Meeks. “A lot of factors contributed to us being successful in this game. Our sophomores wanted this win big time.”\n\nWallace State’s men never trailed against the ninth-ranked Bucs. Four different players scored for Wallace State less than two minutes into the game, helping the Lions surge out to a 9-2 lead, and the Lions later extended it to 17-6 with 14:40 left in the first half.\n\nWallace State earned its biggest lead of the first half, a 10-point advantage, after Quinterian McConico’s slam with 3:52 remaining pushed the cushion to 36-26. Wallace State then led 41-31 with 2:13 left before Shelton State battled back with one of its strongest runs. The Bucs closed the first half on a 7-0 surge, putting a lid on it courtesy of a 3-point play by Dexter Hood.\n\nWallace State led 41-38 at the half.\n\nThe Lions put the game out of reach early in the second half, orchestrating a quick 14-4 run. Freshman Lee Moore capped off the run with a slam dunk at the 13:46 mark, handing the Lions a 55-42 lead. Minutes later, the Lions received 3-pointers from Moore, Lewis and Marcus Burwell on consecutive possessions to grab a 70-54 advantage with 8:24 left.\n\nIt took until the closing minute for Shelton State to trim the gap to single digits.\n\nMeeks felt Wallace State’s fast start in both halves was imperative.\n\n“Our guys stepped up and responded big time. We are beat up. We have a bunch of guys who are sick, so we’re having to play crazy matchups. Assistant (coach) Tommy Suitts is doing a fantastic job of helping me make sure our guys are getting enough rest,” Meeks said. “The transition game is important to us, and we were able to score a lot on the fast break. We also shot the ball well. Jestin Lewis, Marcus Johnson and Lee Moore have been unbelievable for us all season. When one is not at his best, the other two are going to be great. Jestin and Lee stepped up in this game. They were able to score and they also defended two of the better guards in the conference.”\n\nLewis, a Mercer commitment, has scored 18, 23, 29 and 31 points in Wallace State’s four conference wins.\n\nMoore also had a big night for Wallace State, pouring in 24 points. Cody Farley added nine points for the Lions, Marcus Burwell had eight and McConico added seven.\n\n“This win is nice, but we have to make sure it doesn’t define us. It’s a conference win and a step in the right direction. We protected home court like you need to do in this conference. It’s all about taking care of business,” Meeks said. “We’ll consider celebrating a lot if we’re cutting down the nets in March. Right now, we’ve got to focus on not laying an egg when we got to Lawson State on Thursday.”\n\nMarcus Merriweather led Shelton State in the loss with 20 points. Jalen Houston added 18 points and Moss scored 17.\n\nNorth Jefferson News, Gardendale, AL\n\n— When Mark Louis took the court this season, he was usually the shortest player out there.\n\nHe was also usually the fastest.\n\nIt was his speed and ball-handling abilities that helped Louis lead Mortimer Jordan to another 20-win season, and it’s why we have picked him as The North Jefferson News 2013 Boys Basketball Player of the Year.\n\nLouis beat out another flashy point guard, Marcus Merri­weather of Pinson Valley, who was the runner-up for the honor. Like Louis, Merriweather was a speedster (but a bit taller), and not afraid to take the ball straight to the rack, averaging almost 20 points per game. But Merri­weather was more of a playmaker for the Indians, whereas Louis was also content to dish the ball when the opportunity arose — he averaged five assists per game to go with 14 points.\n\nLouis is joined by fellow Blue Devils Ben Hardiman and Orion Recke on the NJN All-Star Team, while Merriweather is joined by Pinson forward Jonathan Mara­ble, who averaged close to a double-double — 10.6 points and nine rebounds per contest.\n\nLocust Fork was the only local boys team that spent a significant amount of time in the top 10 of their class, and has three players on our squad: outside threat Clay Smith, playmaker Dillon Burton and Kyle Hornbuckle.\n\nPlaymakers Juan Jackson of Gardendale, Caleb Thompson of Tabernacle Christian and Blake Byrd of Corner also made our list.\n\nThe NJN All-Star boys basketball team is selected by Sports Editor Robert Carter, in consultation with local coaches.\n\n1/3/2015\n\nHUNTSVILLE – In a game that saw 11 lead changes and the scored tied eight times, Jackson State edged Alabama A&M 70-67 Saturday night at Elmore Gym.
