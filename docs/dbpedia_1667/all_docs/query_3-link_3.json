        "text": "Basketball competition\n\nThe 2004 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2003–04 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the NBA Finals. Chauncey Billups was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThe 2004 playoffs was the first appearance for the Memphis Grizzlies in their nine year history which began in Vancouver. However, they failed to win a single game in their first 3 playoff appearances (2004, 2005, 2006), before earning their first playoff game and series victories in 2011.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, entered their eighth consecutive post season.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets made the playoffs for the first time since 1995.\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets made their final postseason appearance as a member of the East. They would not make the playoffs again until 2008, as a member of the West (the result of a realignment with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2004–05 NBA season). Their playoff series with the Miami Heat, led by Dwyane Wade, was the last playoff series where the home team won all seven games until 2008's Boston–Atlanta and Boston–Cleveland playoff series.\n\nThe Houston Rockets made playoffs for the first time since 1999. As a result, 2004 was the first time in 14 years that all Texas teams made the playoffs, and the second time (first in ten years) that all former ABA teams made the playoffs. This was Steve Francis' only career playoff appearance.\n\nThis was the first postseason since 1998 without Allen Iverson or Tracy McGrady.\n\nThe Miami Heat and the New York Knicks both made the playoffs for the first time since 2001. This marked Dwyane Wade’s first postseason appearance and the start of four straight playoff appearances for the Heat. For the Knicks, on the other hand, this was their last appearance until 2011.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz missed the playoffs for the first time since 1982 and 1983, respectively.\n\nGame 4 of the Spurs–Grizzlies series was the last NBA game ever played at Pyramid Arena. That game and Game 3 of the same series were the only playoff games to take place in The Pyramid before the Grizzlies moved to FedExForum in the autumn of 2004.\n\nWith their series win over the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves won their first playoff series in franchise history.\n\nWith their first round series loss to the Sacramento Kings, the Dallas Mavericks lost a first round playoff series for the first time since 1990. As of 2024, this remains the Kings’ most recent series victory.\n\nGame 5 of the Spurs–Lakers series was extremely notable for both teams’ last shots. Tim Duncan scored a two–pointer to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds remaining. However, Derek Fisher would hit the game winning shot as time expired to give the Lakers a 74–73 victory in San Antonio.\n\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Miami Heat, the Indiana Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since their NBA Finals run in 2000, after which they significantly changed the makeup of their team (yet still made the playoffs every year).\n\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Sacramento Kings, the Minnesota Timberwolves made their first conference finals appearance in franchise history. They didn't return to the conference finals until 2024.\n\nGame 2 of the Pistons–Pacers series was notable for Tayshaun Prince’s block of Reggie Miller’s late game layup.\n\nGame 6 of the Timberwolves–Lakers series was the last Minnesota Timberwolves postseason game until 2018.\n\nWith their Conference Finals win over the Indiana Pacers, the Detroit Pistons made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1990.\n\nIn a shocking upset, the Detroit Pistons beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games to win the NBA Championship.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers clinched the best record in the NBA and had earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs. However, when Indiana lost to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, home court advantage for the NBA Finals switched to the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers, who had posted a better regular season record at 56–26 than the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons at 54–28.\n\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nIndiana Pacers (61–21) (clinched Central division)\n\nDetroit Pistons (54–28)\n\nNew Jersey Nets (47–35) (clinched Atlantic division)\n\nMiami Heat (42–40)\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (41–41, 3–1 head-to-head vs. MIL)\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (41–41, 1–3 head-to-head vs. NOH)\n\nNew York Knicks (39–43)\n\nBoston Celtics (36–46)\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves clinched the best record in the Western Conference and had home court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs. However, when Minnesota lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers gained home court advantage for the NBA Finals because the Lakers posted a better regular season record at 56-26 than the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons at 54–28.\n\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (58–24) (clinched Midwest division)\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (56–26) (clinched Pacific division)\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (57–25)\n\nSacramento Kings (55–27)\n\nDallas Mavericks (52–30)\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (50–32)\n\nHouston Rockets (45–37)\n\nDenver Nuggets (43–39)\n\nConference Quarterfinals Conference Semifinals Conference Finals NBA Finals E1 Indiana* 4 E8 Boston 0 E1 Indiana* 4 E4 Miami 2 E4 Miami 4 E5 New Orleans 3 E1
