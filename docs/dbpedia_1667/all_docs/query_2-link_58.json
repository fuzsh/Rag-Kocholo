Coach Phil Jackson added his 11th, matching Russells total and possibly putting a cap on his remarkable career if he decides to leave the Lakers.\n\nThis one is by far the sweetest, because its them, Bryant said after the Lakers beat Boston for the first time in a Game 7. This was the hardest one by far. I wanted it so bad, and sometimes when you want it so bad, it slips away from you. My guys picked me up.\n\nRon Artest (6'7''-G-79, college: St.John's) added 20 points for the Lakers, who didnt exactly show a champions poise while making just 21 shots in the first three quarters, even hovering around 50 percent at the free throw line.\n\nYet with Bryant driving the lane for eight free throws and Pau asol (7'0''-F/C-80) finally coming alive with nine of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, Los Angeles reclaimed the lead midway through and hung on with a few more big shots from Gasol, who had 18 rebounds, and Artest, a first-time champion as the only newcomer to last seasons roster.\n\n'Well, first of all I want to thank everybody in my hood, Artest said in an ABC interview right after the game. I definitely want to thank my doctors my psychiatrist, she really helped me relax a lot.'\n\nJackson won his fifth ring in Los Angeles to go with his half-dozen from Chicago. And it might be the last: Weary of the regular-season grind and facing a likely pay cut with the Lakers, Jackson hasnt determined his future, though he previously said another title would make him more likely to chase an unprecedented fourth threepeat next season, when hell be 65.\n\n'I've got to take a deep breath. Ive got to take some time to think about this', Jackson said, wearing a satisfied grin underneath his championship hat. 'This was great. Ill wait to make that decision in a week.'\n\nWith his hands already full, maybe Jackson will follow Russells lead and put that 11th championship ring on a chain around his neckand Bryant isnt likely to settle for just one handful of rings.\n\nHe made that clear to his coach.\n\nHe knows how bad I want him back, Bryant said. Ive been openly blunt about how much I want him back.\n\nWith their fifth title in 11 seasons, the Lakers moved one championship behind Bostons 17 banners for the overall NBA lead.\n\nAmid the confetti and streamers after the final buzzer, Magic Johnson (6'10''-G-59, college: Michigan St.)) rushed the court to congratulate Bryant, who now has the same number of titles, and to hug Artest.\n\nPaul Pierce (6'7''-F-77, college: Kansas) had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who just couldnt finish the final quarter of a remarkable playoff run after a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Kevin Garnett (6'10''-F-76) added 17 points, but Boston flopped in two chances to clinch the series in Los Angeles after winning Game 5 back home.\n\nListen, give the Lakers credit, Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. They were terrific.\n\nRivers knows changes are coming, even saying afterward that the 10-11 Celtics will be different than the 09-10 team.\n\nWe were the tightest, most emotional, crazy group Ive ever been around in my life, Rivers said, adding that hell wait a while before deciding on his oft-speculated future.\n\nHe called this team crazy close and throughout the playoffs, the Celtics only got closer. Down by 14 in their first playoff game against Miami, they won that night and rode that instant burst of confidence not only past the Heat, but through Cleveland and Orlando in the next two rounds.\n\nThe Celtics were a .500 team for the final two-thirds of the season, prompting many to wonder if they could turn it back on for the playoffs.\n\nThat question was answered long ago. Yes, they couldand one or two more stops on Thursday, theyd have won an 18th title.\n\nTheres a lot of crying in that locker room, Rivers said. A lot of people who care. I dont think there was a dry eye. A lot of hugs, a lot of people feeling awful. Thats a good thing. Showed a lot of people cared.\n\nThe Celtics had never lost a seventh game in the finals. Despite nursing a lead through most of the night while holding the Lakers to ridiculously low shooting percentages until the final minutes, Boston couldnt close it out on the coast, becoming just the seventh team to blow a 3-2 finals lead after winning Game 5.\n\nThe Lakers tied it at 61 on Artests three-point play with 7:29 left, and Bryants free throws 90 seconds later gave the Lakers their first lead of the second half. The Lakers forged ahead by five points before Bryant and Sasha Vujacic (notes) hit free throws in the final seconds to keep Los Angeles ahead by at least two points on every possession.\n\nBryant said he had to downplay the magnitude of the rivalry during the series, but it was a gigantic part of his motivation for this title, without question.\n\nBecause it was Lakers-Celtics, the best rivalry in league history.\n\nAnd because it was against the team that denied him a title in 2008, the Celtics then blowing out the Lakers in Boston in Game 6 two years ago for their 17th championship.\n\nThat loss drove Bryant all last season, and drove him again Thursday night.\n\nHe was not at his best in Game 7, and acknowledged as much. Didnt matter he still captured the finals MVP award, after averaging 28.6 points in the series.\n\nHes won three straight crowns before, and is already eyeing another three-peat try.\n\nLets go for it again, Bryant said, moments before hoisting the finals MVP trophy.\n\nThe Lakers will hold a parade Monday, with the team riding floats from Staples Center down Figueroa Street to the USC campus in downtown Los Angeles. A rally at the Coliseum last year attracted 95,000 fans, but the Lakers are skipping the arena in favor of a more interactive celebration, the team said.\n\nThe Lakers will relish this title because they took it from the Celtics, their greatest rivals, with fourth-quarter poise and defense. The teams have met in 12 NBA finals, but the Lakers won for just the third time.\n\nExactly two years to the day after Boston beat the Lakers by 39 points to clinch the 2008 title, Los Angeles got revenge for perhaps the most embarrassing loss of Bryants careereven if he did little more than grab 15 rebounds for most of the night.\n\nThe Celtics had much more poise from the opening tip in Game 7, playing vicious defense that forced Los Angeles to miss 21 of its first 27 shots. Bryant and Gasol were a combined 6 for 26 in the first half.\n\nBut forget how it looked, because history will. Bryant even did something Jerry West and Magic Johnson n never could: He beat the hated Celtics in Game 7 of the finals.\n\nThe Lakers are the first team to rally from a 3-2 deficit to win a finals since Houston did it in 1994, beating the New York Knicks. Although Los Angeles stumbled to the brink of elimination for the first time in these playoffs last weekend in Boston, Bryants teams still are spectacular finishers: Theyve closed out their playoff opponents on the first try 10 times while winning three straight Western Conference titles over the last three years.\n\nNOTES: Home teams improved to 14-3 in Game 7 in the finals. No road team has won a title in Game 7 since 1978. The Lakers are 14-1 in a seventh game at home, losing only the 1969 finale to Boston. Garnett nearly flattened Jack Nicholson when he chased a loose ball into the front row in the second quarter, but the Lakers most famous fans got back up smiling. Other fans near courtside included Jake Gyllenhall, Kirsten Dunst, Ryan Seacrest, Timbaland, director Todd Phillips and George Lopez in purple-and-yellow plaid pants.\n\nNBA All Star Game set attendance record as East All Stars win again -\n\nDwyane Wade (6'4''-G-82, college: Marquette) scored 28 points and 11 assists while leading the East All Stars to a 141-139 victory and earned the MVP honors.\n\nHowever LeBron James (6'8''-F-84) also put on a spectacular dunk show while scoring 25 points. Chris Bosh (6'11''-F-84, college: Georgia Tech) played very well and scored 23 points.\n\nCarmelo Anthony (6'8''-F-84, college: Syracuse) led the West in scoring with 27 points and the Dallas Mavericks Dirk Nowitzki (6'11''-F-78) scored 22 points.\n\nThe marquee event at the 2010 NBA All Star Weekend took place on Sunday evening at the Cowboys Stadium in a record crowd of 108,713 fans.\n\nAll weekend the talk was about this tremendous venue built by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.\n\nThe jumbo stadium scoreboard was bigger than the actual basketball court.\n\nAll types of stars from the sports and entertainment industry were in attendance at the annual NBA event.\n\nUsher provided the pre-game entertainment and Alicia Keys performed at halftime.\n\nThere were nine new first time all stars playing in the 59th NBA All Star game.\n\nCarmelo Anthony scored 17 points in the first half for the West All Stars.\n\nThe East took a 76-69 half time lead with a balance attack from LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Dwight Howard (6'10''-F-85).\n\nIn the second half the East controlled the game with great uptempo play from LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.\n\nIn the fourth quarter the West made a run to narrow the lead.\n\nChauncey Billups (6'3''-G-76, college: Colorado) and Dirk Nowitzki made some key plays down the wire to force the game down to the final possession.\n\nCarmelo Anthony missed a tough 3pt attempt and the East escaped with a victory.\n\nThe game was very competitive in the final quarter and was terrific finish to a great all star weekend in Dallas.\n\nNate Robinson (5'9''-G-84, college: Washington) became the first three time winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Champion at the All Star weekend in Dallas.\n\nHe defeated Demar DeRozan (6'7''-F-89, college: USC) in the final with a spectacular final dunk.\n\nHe threw the basketball off the backboard and jumped outside the dotted line and dunked the ball backwards.\n\nThe overall competition was one of the weakest dunk contest in NBA All Star Weekend history.\n\nThere were too many missed dunks and not too many spectacular dunks .\n\nPaul Pierce (6'7''-F-77, college: Kansas), Chauncey Billups (6'3''-G-76, college: Colorado) and Stephen Curry (6'3''-G-88, college: Davidson) all advance to the final shootoff in the three point contest.\n\nHowever Paul Pierce surprised everyone by becoming the first Boston Celtic to win the NBA 3pt shooting contest since Larry Bird .\n\nThe Saturday night festivities began with the Haier Shooting Stars competition. This event always features a city team with a current NBA, WNBA and a former NBA player.\n\nThe final round feature Los Angeles and the team from Texas.\n\nThe Texas team won the competition in blistering form by finishing all six stations in 34 seconds.\n\nDirk Nowitzki (6'11''-F-78), Becky Hammonds and Kenny Smith represented Texas in a quality fashion.\n\nThe second event was the Skills Challenge which is a competition featuring point guards. Steve Nash won the event for the second time outdueling Deron Williams in the final.\n\nAll-Star Rosters -\n\nEastern Conference\n\nJames\n\nGarnett\n\nWade\n\nIverson\n\nHoward\n\n23 LeBron James (6'8''-F-84) of Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n5 Kevin Garnett (6'10''-F-76) of Boston Celtics\n\n3 Dwyane Wade (6'4''-G-82) of Miami Heat\n\n3 Allen Iverson (6'1''-G-75) of Philadelphia 76ers\n\n12 Dwight Howard (6'10''-F-85) of Orlando Magic\n\n15 # Alfred Horford (6'10''-F/C-86) of Atlanta Hawks\n\n4 Chris Bosh (6'11''-F-84) of Toronto Raptors\n\n34 Paul Pierce (6'7''-F-77) of Boston Celtics\n\n3 # Gerald Wallace (6'7''-F-82) of Charlotte Bobcats\n\n2 Joe Johnson (6'8''-F-81) of Atlanta Hawks\n\n9 # Rajon Rondo (6'1''-G-86) of Boston Celtics\n\n1 # Derrick Rose (6'4''-G-88) of Chicago Bulls\n\nHead Coach: Stan Van Gundy\n\nWestern Conference\n\nAnthony\n\nDuncan\n\nBryant\n\nNash\n\nStoudemire\n\n15 Carmelo Anthony (6'8''-F-84) of Denver Nuggets\n\n21 Tim Duncan (6'10''-F-76) of San Antonio Spurs\n\n24 Kobe Bryant (6'6''-G-78) of Los Angeles Lakers\n\n13 Steve Nash (6'3''-G-74) of Phoenix Suns\n\n1 Amare Stoudemire (6'10''-F-82) of Phoenix Suns\n\n16 Pau Gasol (7'0''-F/C-80) of Los Angeles Lakers\n\n35 # Kevin Durant (6'9''-G/F-88) of Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n41 Dirk Nowitzki (6'11''-F-78) of Dallas Mavericks\n\n50 # Zach Randolph (6'9''-C-81) of Memphis Grizzlies\n\n3 Chris Paul (6'0''-G-85) of New Orleans Hornets (injured)\n\n1 Chauncey Billups (6'3''-G-76) of Denver Nuggets\n\n7 Brandon Roy (6'6''-G-84) of Portland Trail Blazers (injured)\n\n35 # Chris Kaman (7'0''-C-82) of Los Angeles Clippers\n\n8 # Deron Williams (6'3''-G-84) of Utah Jazz\n\nHead Coach: George Karl\n\n# - denotes first-time selection"
