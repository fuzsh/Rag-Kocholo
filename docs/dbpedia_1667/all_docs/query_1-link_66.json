We brainstormed with some of the top minds in the history of local hoops.\n\nWe enlisted the help of Hall of Fame coaches, athletic directors, players, sports writers and referees. We debated for months over who’s in, who’s out and where they rank.\n\nThe result is an impressive collection of the top 75 Section III players, in order.\n\nWhat's the criteria to make this list? We considered high school performances, what the players did in college and, in many cases, pro basketball and beyond.\n\nWe know some will disagree over who we included or left off and where they’re ranked.\n\nThat's what makes this so fun.
