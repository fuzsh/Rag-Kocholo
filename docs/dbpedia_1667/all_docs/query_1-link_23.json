        "text": "Article Length: ~900 words or about 4-7 minutes of reading.\n\nI strongly suggest checking in on my previous articles about the nth best players on a team. Here’s a Sparknotes version: we make a mistake when we say that a player is “the best player” because his value is dependent on his role, so we need to differentiate between “first-best,” “second-best,” “third-best,” etc. players. This is why it would be smarter to pair Harden with Gobert instead of Harden with Westbrook (oops) because you want players who can maximize their own skills without encroaching on anyone else’s.\n\nOften, this sort of team-building works because there simply aren’t that many “first-best” players in the league. But what if there were? What if you could choose literally any player like in Bill Simmons’ wine-cellar team or my Universe Cup team or my 2nd-Tier Universe Cup team. For the sake of a challenge, let’s look at my Universe Cup team. Here were the rules when I wrote about this three years ago:\n\n1). I can only choose specific players/years from the 2000-2001 season onward and 2). Instead of a seven game series, I’m choosing a team for a full 82-game season along with the four rounds of traditional NBA playoffs. I dig the alien theme, so let’s imagine our teams are competing for intergalactic supremacy in the first ever Universe Cup season.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “The Universe Cup: Part 1,” 2016\n\nWhen you can select literally any combination of players over the last nineteen years, how do you do so while following my theoretical framework on building a cohesive team? Here, let me illustrate this for you. The following is a list of the best players from the 2000s:\n\nGuards: Nash, Kobe, Curry, Harden, Wade, Allen, Thompson, Parker, Kidd, Carter, Westbrook, Ginobili, Billups, Rose, Iverson, Wall\n\nForwards: LeBron, Garnett, Nowitzki, Durant, Kawhi, Melo, Giannis, Webber, Gasol, Marion, Stoudemire, McGrady\n\nCenters: Shaq, Duncan, Wallace, Jokic, Embiid, Howard, Cousins, Yao\n\nJust from the guards list ALONE, you would have to cut four players to make a twelve-man roster. From the group in total, you would need to cut twenty-four players. TWENTY-FOUR!!!!!\n\nWhen I originally made my team, I selected the following twelve:\n\nGuards: Kobe (2008-09); Chris Paul (2008-09); Wade (2008-09); Curry (2014-15); Allen (2000-01)\n\nForwards: LeBron (2012-13); Garnett (2003-04); Durant (2013-14); Dirk (2005-06); Kawhi (2015-16)\n\nCenters: Duncan (2002-03); Shaq (2000-01)\n\nAt first glance, that list looks great, but it looks a little unstable after careful scrutiny. Let’s list some of these off.\n\nCurry is bumped up to 2015-16. He stays.\n\nKawhi has improved dramatically since 2016, but does his current skillset work with this group?\n\nWait, where’s James Harden? Where’s Giannis? Do either of these guys mesh?\n\nDoes it make sense to have both Kobe and Wade?\n\nDoes ball-dominant Chris Paul need to be there?\n\nIs Dirk’s shooting enough to make up for defensive and passing woes?\n\nRay Allen? Oh yeah, he brings some much needed spot-up shooting….but Ray Allen?\n\nOkay, let’s take a breather………………………………………………\n\nIn developing the concept of the “best, first-best player,” I conceived of the best teams only having one of these players (unless, of course, the players could also play a secondary role like Curry or Durant); however, this might only be the case in reality when teams generally have access to only one of these kinds of players. In an ideal world, maybe Harden would like to take a break from iso-ing and spot-up in the corner. Maybe LeBron would like to set off-ball screens as a distraction. Right now, it wouldn’t make sense for LeBron to do that if the next best player on the court is Kyle Kuzma, but what if Durant, Curry, and Shaq were all on the floor with him? We’ve seen him take on a significantly higher pass-first, secondary role in the Olympics, so maybe he would excel as the not first option. Maybe.\n\nFurthermore, if LeBron or Harden were to get injured (…like they were…), their teams would suck. If a team has a player that can step up and handle that role, the drop-off wouldn’t be as painful. But then the question becomes how many “first-best players” should be on a team? Let me frame this question another way: if you had to only choose three of the following players (based on a single season peak), who would you pick: LeBron, Durant, McGrady, Harden, Wade, Kawhi, Paul, and Kobe?\n\nSure, you can go ahead and pick them all, but who’s doing the “second-best,” “third-best,” and “fourth-best” player responsibilities? Who is spotting up in the corner? Who is becoming the defensive powerhouse? Who is setting off-ball screens? Who is fighting centers in the paint? Who is NOT touching the ball for five-straight possessions?\n\nThis question right here is the rift between “eye-test” and “blog boy” fans. Even though it’s sacrilegious, it is necessary to cut some of the greatest “first-best” players of all time to make room for guys who can fill those roles better. Is Draymond Green better than Kobe? No, but is Draymond Green better at taking three shots in a game, setting hard screens, and playing all-league defense on five positions? Yes, and it’s frankly not even close.\n\nWhat do we make all of this? What should the Universe Cup team look like? I honestly don’t know. I think I would replace Ray with Klay. I also think Draymond and Giannis should make it, but that actually hurts the overall shooting. I’m leaning towards dropping Paul, and maybe I’d replace either Kobe or Wade with McGrady or Kawhi. Nash adds some solid spacing too if I can squeeze him in.\n\nHopefully, I’ll sit down one of these days and actually hash it out, but until then, I’ll let these thoughts marinate a little bit more.\n\nFinal thought: watch quarters 2-4 of the Spain vs. USA gold medal game from the 2012 Olympics to see a clear example of too many players whose skillsets encroach upon one another.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,100 words or about 6-8 minutes of reading.\n\nMy last article on the question of who is the best player remained mostly abstract. While it’s an abstract question, I want to try and provide some concrete answers by applying it to NBA players from the 2018-19 season. This will be extremely difficult to do because everything concrete begins with philosophical abstractions, so you’ll just have to roll with my logic (or disagree with me on Twitter).\n\nIf all NBA players were placed in a fantasy draft and I had to start from nothing, who would I select first? The answer to this question is the answer to who the “best, first-best” player in the league is. To me, this comes down to two players: LeBron or Steph. I really really want to pick LeBron for this because I still believe that he can reach transcendent levels better than any other player in the league on both sides of the ball, but the knock against him (like most players) is that he works best in a specific team-build: defensively proficient shooters. If for some reason I’m not able to lock down adequate players like that in subsequent rounds, I’m afraid that he’ll lose value.\n\nOn the other hand, Curry, being the “best, second-best player” in the league (we’ll get to this), means that he will retain his value regardless of whom is selected in subsequent rounds; furthermore, we’ve seen Curry literally be the “best, first-best” player on the greatest regular season team in history.\n\nGoing back to my first round of the draft, here’s a rough outline the “best, first-best” players in the league (the guys that you would want to draft in the first round of a fantasy draft):\n\nCurry\n\nLeBron\n\nDurant\n\nGiannis\n\nKawhi\n\nHarden\n\nDavis\n\nJokic\n\nEmbiid\n\nIf you don’t have one of these nine players on your team, you cannot win a championship right now. Does that mean that the other twenty-three teams in the league should give up? No. You never know when another player is going to skyrocket into this stratosphere of players (Giannis, Jokic, nor Embiid were at this level last year).\n\nThe next tier, the “best, second-best” players become trickier to explain. Players can overlap between different levels of being the “best” player, but not all of them will. Curry will also top this list, but LeBron won’t be on it because if you are making your second round selection and LeBron is somehow still on the board, he would turn into your “best, first-best” player because he would most strongly dictate how your team would play. These are the players who either need a player a tier above them to cover some gap in their own skillset or tier 1 players who can seamlessly provide extraordinary value without the ball (e.g. defense, shooting, passing).\n\nHere are the “best, second-best” players in the league:\n\nCurry\n\nDurant\n\nDavis\n\nJokic\n\nEmbiid\n\nGeorge\n\nGobert\n\nLillard\n\nButler\n\nTowns\n\nWalker\n\nGriffin\n\nSome order of Vucevic, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, Paul, Westbrook, and Nurkic\n\nBelow this tier are the “best, third-best” players who will generally fill one of two templates: players who excel in a valuable and malleable skills (defense/shooting) while struggling in other areas (think Danny Green and his shooting vs. shot creation and passing) and players who excel in multiple areas that are malleable while not necessarily leading a team through significant scoring or playmaking (think Pascal Siakam and Draymond Green). Here are those players:\n\nStephen Curry…yes, I would place him first at literally any round of the draft. I believe he would fit literally in any lineup; therefore, I won’t include him in later lists.\n\nDraymond\n\nPascal Siakam\n\nAl Horford\n\nKlay\n\nKyle Lowry\n\nMarc Gasol\n\nKhris Middleton\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\n\nJosh Richardson\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nJoe Ingles\n\nBuddy Hield\n\nMcCollum\n\nEric Bledsoe\n\nMyles Turner\n\nCapela\n\nSteven Adams\n\nAre we starting to see a pattern? The most successful teams this year had multiple “best, nth-best” players at different and appropriate tiers. Just from these first three tiers, let’s compare some of the top teams (tier 1 – position; tier 2 – position; tier 3 – position):\n\nToronto (1 – 5; 0; 3 – 3, 6, 7)\n\nGolden State (2 – 1, 3; 0; 2 – 2, 5)\n\nMilwaukee (1 – 4; 0; 3 – 8, 9, 15)\n\nPhiladelphia (1 – 9; 2 – 9, 13; 0)\n\nPortland (0; 1 – 8; 3 – 14)\n\nThree of the four conference finalists had a tier one player, and the only one without (Portland) was swept by the Warriors. While neither Milwaukee nor Toronto had a clear-cut “2nd best player,” they both had strong “3rd best players” at multiple positions. After watching how both teams came together, it’s clear that Toronto’s “3rd best players” were simply a better fit in their lineups.\n\nJacob Goldstein’s PIPM model, which calculates a player’s defensive and offensive impact on a team in a way that takes into account their boxscore production and plus/minus data (for a refresher, check out my article on impact metrics), provides some interesting insights into this “best player” conversation. For 2018-19, the top players are pretty expected: Giannis, Curry, Embiid, etc., but as you go down the list, a few odd names pop up. After LeBron at 14, the following players appear: Vucevic, Brook Lopez, Draymond, Holiday, Drummond, Bledsoe, Danny Green, followed by Kawhi. A simple explanation is that the statistic is flawed because someone like Danny Green (Kawhi’s teammate) couldn’t have had a more positive impact than Kawhi.\n\nThe truth is that these players – the Siakams, Greens, Horfords – all can provide more value than a tier 1 player if they are placed in the perfect “nth” role. Having a perfectly fitting “third-best” player can yield more value than a poorly fitting “first-best” player. This explains why someone like Kemba Walker ranks 50th in this statistic: even though he is tremendously talented, he should not be placed in a “first-best” role.\n\nHopefully, this provides some grounding for my claim that the best player is not always the best player. If I were as in-depth as is necessary, each of these lists would be fluid depending on who was selected in previous rounds. For instance, a player like Lillard would be a better “2nd best player” next to LeBron while Gobert might be “better” next to Harden. I simply don’t have the time to map out an entire fantasy draft matrix contingency.\n\nOnce again though, this is why Steph Curry should be rated much higher than he already is. Also, shout out to Robert Covington who is probably the “best, fourth-best player” in the league.\n\nNote: if you want access to the PIPM data, they exist in a few spreadsheets, so searching them out on Twitter is probably your best bet. Jacob Goldstein is the owner.\n\nAddendum: I tweeted a more in-depth explanation of the different tiers, so instead of incorporating those thoughts into this article, I’ve just included the tweets here.\n\nArticle Length: ~900 words or about 4-7 minutes of reading.\n\n“Who is the best player?” is both the most interesting and least interesting question in all of sports. Usually, it is answered lazily with faulty or simplistic logic; however, I think it’s often the case that the one asking the question is more at fault than the one answering. The issue with the question is the question itself because the best player is never always the best player.\n\nI think that when most people ask the question, they usually mean something like “which player gives his team the best chance to win a championship?” This can be boiled down to any level of competition such as “which player gives their team the best chance to win this pickup game?”\n\nThe issue with how this iteration of the question is answered is in how it is interpreted. Most people perceive it as “starting from scratch, which player will give their team the best chance to win?” In the NBA (and all other professional sports), no player is being drafted, traded, or signed to a team that has literally no other players which makes the player’s value dependent on the other players on the team. This splits the original question into two separate questions: a hypothetical one and a reality-based one. My aim is to answer the former (Ben Taylor answers the latter with his own statistical-based response for 2018-19).\n\nTo hypothetically answer who the best player in the league is, it’s necessary to ask a series of questions which are as follows:\n\nIf the league entered a full fantasy draft, who would be selected first overall to give his team the best chance to win a championship?\n\nWho would be selected second?\n\nWho would be selected third?\n\nAnd this line of questioning would continue until a full roster of twelve players was created. Actually selecting the players is obviously where this hypothetical becomes tricky.\n\nThe common parlance for maximizing a superstar on a team is “building around” him. This implies that a player’s skillset requires some level of fit to ensure success (for a much deeper dive of this, check out my article series from a couple of years ago). It also means that a player who contributes significantly to winning WITHOUT being able to fit into any system should be selected first. Let me explain.\n\nIf I have the first pick in an all-time draft and I select Michael Jordan first, my choices for subsequent picks drop significantly because I shouldn’t look for another player who plays guard, maximizes his skills by having the ball, and scores a lot. Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, and James Harden might still be on the board in the second round, but all of their skills would encroach significantly on MJ’s skills reducing the impact that either would have on the team.\n\nIs this annoyingly pedantic and blog boyish? Should you just select the “best” possible player no matter what? NO! That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of “best” in this situation! Real, actual players don’t come with a handy 2K rating that shows some objective level of skill that they have. If it’s my turn to select my third player in a draft and I already have LeBron and Gobert, who should I choose given the following three players: Danny Green, Donovan Mitchell, or Nikola Vucevic. Most people would list both Mitchell and Vucevic as better players than Danny Green, but given the context, Danny Green would actually be the “better” player. How? Because, in this case, Green is the “best, third-best” option available based on how his skills complement LeBron and Gobert.\n\nI propose that each player should be described as the “best, nth-best” player where “n” is the round in the fantasy draft in which the player would hypothetically be selected. Looking back to the first iteration of the question “who is the best player?” most people consider only players who would be the “best, first-best player” player which is why Stephen Curry is often so underrated.\n\nThe magic of Curry is that the scalability of his skillset is so immense that he could theoretically be the “best” player in any round of the fantasy draft. His off-ball movement, shooting, and off-ball screening have such an independent value that he could be plugged into any system with significant returns. Contrast this with Harden who derives almost all of his value from having the ball.\n\nThroughout these last few years, the Warriors have built their immense success on matching players who are either the “best” or one of the “best” at multiple rounds of our fantasy draft. Some people argue that Durant is the “best, first-best” in the league. Curry has a similar “first-best” impact, but he is also the “best, second-best” player by a margin that we have never seen in the league. Klay and Draymond are both the “best, third or fourth-best” players with Draymond possibly being the all-time “3rd-best” player (competing with the Bulls’ Rodman and the Celtics’ Garnett).\n\nAs a sports community, we often ignore the contingent and necessary value of players: the 90s Bulls, 2000s Lakers, 2010s Warriors, and 2000s Spurs all had one of the “best, first-best players” along with the “best, second-best” player and multiple other “best, nth-best” players. A player like Stephen Curry who can fluidly transition between being the best at different roles should be viewed in a much more positive light than we view him.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,100 words or about 6-8 minutes of reading.\n\nThis article was written prior to all games on 11/23, so statistics are reflective of those games.\n\nFor anybody who missed the intro to the Simulation league (first of all, read part 1, part 2, and part 3) here’s a quick summary of what’s going on:\n\nI took every team in the league, chose one player on the team to be in his prime, chose one historical player to join the team, and simulated the season on 2k19 day-by-day. This “Simulation League” is occurring at the same time as reality.\n\nBefore diving into the numbers and discussing where simulation and reality converge/diverge, it’s important to explain what statistics I’ll be using and why I’m using them.\n\nrORtg = relative offensive rating – this takes a team’s offensive rating and subtracts the league average offensive rating from it to see how much above or below average a team’s offense is.\n\nrDRtg = relative defensive rating – Same as rORtg but for defense.\n\ndrORTg – difference relative offensive rating – the difference between the simulation team’s offense and reality’s performance\n\ndrDRtG = difference relative defensive rating – same as drORTg but for defensive rating\n\ndNRTg = difference net rating – the difference between the simulation team’s net rating and reality’s net rating\n\nI will also be using Per 36 minutes stats to normalize between the Simulation League and reality.\n\nWithout further ado, here is how reality is fairing compared to the simulation followed by the Simulation League’s performance:\n\nSimulation Teams drORtg (positive is good) drDRtg (negative is good) dNRtg (positive is good) Atlanta Hawks 13.52 -7.29 20.80 Boston Celtics 6.52 -4.09 10.60 Brooklyn Nets -3.88 0.41 -4.30 Charlotte Hornets -12.48 3.61 -16.10 Chicago Bulls 5.62 -1.39 7.00 Cleveland Cavaliers 3.02 -9.09 12.10 Dallas Mavericks 1.32 1.71 -0.40 Denver Nuggets 1.22 0.41 0.80 Detroit Pistons 1.82 4.31 -2.50 Golden State Warriors 1.42 -9.89 11.30 Houston Rockets 9.52 -0.29 9.80 Indiana Pacers -3.98 5.11 -9.10 LA Clippers -7.58 4.21 -11.80 LA Lakers -5.78 3.01 -8.80 Memphis Grizzles -6.98 7.01 -14.00 Miami Heat 8.72 -3.29 12.00 Milwaukee Bucks -5.48 3.91 -9.40 Minnesota Timberwolves -0.28 -3.49 3.20 New Orleans Pelicans -4.78 2.61 -7.40 New York Knicks -6.48 2.11 -8.60 OKC Thunder 3.12 5.01 -1.90 Orlando Magic -1.38 0.31 -1.70 Philadelphia 76ers 0.72 -0.69 1.40 Phoenix Suns 2.72 -7.59 10.30 Portland Trail Blazers -1.48 8.21 -9.70 Sacramento Kings -2.58 6.11 -8.70 San Antonio Spurs 0.72 3.91 -3.20 Toronto Raptors -1.98 -8.69 6.70 Utah Jazz 3.32 -3.39 6.70 Washington Wizards 2.02 -3.09 5.10\n\nSimulation Team ORtg DRtg Net Rating rORtg (positive is good) rDRtg (negative is good) Atlanta Hawks 115.70 105.50 10.20 6.02 -4.19 Boston Celtics 112.50 100.10 12.40 2.82 -9.59 Brooklyn Nets 107.20 112.40 -5.20 -2.48 2.71 Charlotte Hornets 102.20 112.90 -10.70 -7.48 3.21 Chicago Bulls 108.20 110.40 -2.20 -1.48 0.71 Cleveland Cavaliers 109.30 105.80 3.50 -0.38 -3.89 Dallas Mavericks 110.80 110.10 0.70 1.12 0.41 Denver Nuggets 113.80 107.10 6.70 4.12 -2.59 Detroit Pistons 110.30 113.00 -2.70 0.62 3.31 Golden State Warriors 116.50 100.90 15.60 6.82 -8.79 Houston Rockets 120.50 110.90 9.60 10.82 1.21 Indiana Pacers 105.00 110.50 -5.50 -4.68 0.81 Los Angeles Clippers 106.80 114.40 -7.60 -2.88 4.71 Los Angeles Lakers 106.20 113.60 -7.40 -3.48 3.91 Memphis Grizzlies 100.80 111.80 -11.00 -8.88 2.11 Miami Heat 115.90 105.80 10.10 6.22 -3.89 Milwaukee Bucks 111.00 108.00 3.00 1.32 -1.69 Minnesota Timberwolves 108.30 109.40 -1.10 -1.38 -0.29 New Orleans Pelicans 110.00 115.00 -5.00 0.32 5.31 New York Knicks 101.50 116.00 -14.50 -8.18 6.31 Oklahoma City Thunder 113.10 108.90 4.20 3.42 -0.79 Orlando Magic 106.40 110.20 -3.80 -3.28 0.51 Philadelphia 76ers 109.30 107.60 1.70 -0.38 -2.09 Phoenix Suns 106.30 106.50 -0.20 -3.38 -3.19 Portland Trail Blazers 111.60 117.30 -5.70 1.92 7.61 Sacramento Kings 106.40 116.60 -10.20 -3.28 6.91 San Antonio Spurs 110.70 114.80 -4.10 1.02 5.11 Toronto Raptors 112.00 97.00 15.00 2.32 -12.69 Utah Jazz 111.10 107.30 3.80 1.42 -2.39 Washington Wizards 111.10 111.00 0.10 1.42 1.31\n\nOkay, there’s a lot to unpack here after 18ish games! The first surprise story is the Atlanta Hawks whose simulation is boasting a whopping 20.8 drNRtg which is the equivalent of turning the current Milwaukee Bucks into the current Phoenix Suns. This is a combination Vince Carter leading the league in TS%, Trae Young’s above average TS%, and Hakeem’s general dominance.\n\nThe number that actually stands out the most is Simulation Toronto’s defense which is currently a transcendent 12.69 points above average. This is by far the best relative defense in history, and if we look at Ben Taylor’s chart regarding Bill Russell, it’s actually about a full point better than Russell’s best defensive season.\n\nThe other statistic that really stands out is Houston’s Simulation offense. If we look at last year’s Reality Rockets, its offense was a shade over 6 points better than average which led the league. The Simulation Rockets’ ORtg of 120 is a full 10.82 points over average on offense! I’m not sure if it’s the absurd spacing and passing that they have or a statistical anomaly, but we’ll see if Gerald Green, Melo, and Harden can remain in the top 10 for TS% all year (to be more specific, Melo is averaging 24.4 on 55/54/73 splits. I expect his 3P% to go down and his FT% to go up); however, CP3 and Pippen are leading the team in +/- respectively with an 11.1 and 9.7 per game.\n\n(Side note: for anyone furiously shaking his or her head at my use of such archaic stats, 2K isn’t the shining beacon of statistical analysis).\n\nTwo teams whose immense struggles are puzzling to me are the Lakers (KG+prime LeBron) and the Knicks (MJ+KP).\n\nFor the Lakers, its simulated counterpart is performing 5.78 points worse on offense and 3.01 points worse on defense. In reality, I envisioned KG and LeBron’s carrying any offense/defense with their brilliant passing and whirling defensive presence, but somehow that was lost in cyberspace. We’ll see if they can right the ship, but man they look rough right now.\n\nThe Knicks itself isn’t more puzzling, but MJ’s performance is. He’s currently averaging 18/7.2/4.9 on 50.7/31/92 splits which would be his weakest scoring season EVER including his woeful Wizards days. If the Knicks want any sort of chance to be competitive, they’ll need 30+ from MJ a night.\n\nA third team whose defense is wretched beyond comparison is the Portland Trail Blazers. I chose to insert Shaq as their center because, even with Dame and C.J., their defense outpaced their defense by a couple of points. The Simulated Blazers currently have a defense that is 7.61 points worse than average which is a full 2 points worse than the league-worst Reality Cavaliers and 3 points worse than last year’s league-worse Reality Suns. Both Shaq and Damn are in the top ten in scoring with fantastic efficiency, but they have to fix their defensive struggles.\n\nLet’s highlight a couple of statistical standouts throughout the season. The first is, of course, Wilt Chamberlain who has averaged 22.8 points and 18.1 rebounds with 8.5 of those being offensive! His 19.6 ORB% would tie for the 7th highest all-time (believe it or not, but Jakob Poeltl is the current all-time leader from this season. That won’t hold up). Wilt has also had five 20/20 games two of which are as follows: 28/25 with 16 offensive boards and a very Wilt 39/28 game.\n\nOn 11/07, Wade dropped 21 dimes.\n\nCurry started the season with a 45/10/5/4 while shooting 7/11 from three.\n\nShaq’s first game was a 42/22/3/3/4 with a +20.\n\nTrue to form, Oscar Robertson is averaging a huge 22.6/13.1/13.6 all of which is leading the Suns. He has not had a single 20/20 game yet, but he did have a 21/19/17 night on 10/24.\n\nBlake Griffin’s boasted a 32/25 while shooting 11/12 from the stripe in his first game. Oh, he was also a +52.\n\nFinally, here are the current front-runners for MVP (based on my snap judgment where I significantly value team performance):\n\nSteph Curry: 31.8/6.4/6.9/1.9/0 on 52.7/44.3/95/5 shooting – 15-4 record\n\nHakeem Olajuwon: 22.4/12.1/2.2/1.1/3.1 on 52.9/0/84.1 shooting – 15-3 record\n\nDwyane Wade: 24.3/5.2/10.8/2.1/1.1 on 53.9/47.4/79.8 shooting – 12-5 record\n\nNikola Jokic: 17/12.9/7/1.4/1 on 52.5/49.1/88.1 shooting – 14-4 record\n\nBill Russell: 12.2/14.2/3.2/1.8/2.9 on 58.7/33.3/64.6 shooting – 13-5 record\n\nThis has been the first check-in with the simulation league. I’ll have to discuss players that have fit seamlessly and players who might have worked better on another team (ahem…trade MJ for Barkley…). If you have any specific statistics you’d like to know or any other information about the league so far, check out my Twitter account where I’ll continue tweeting updates, or just ask!\n\nArticle length: about 1,700 words\n\n(Edit from the future: here are the links to part 2 and part 3).\n\nThe 2016-17 season has unveiled the greatest team in NBA history: The Golden State Warriors. Most fans would incorrectly argue that the ’96 Bulls hold that throne even though Jordan and Pippen were past their primes (Pippen just barely), their post play was insufficient, and their depth was undesirable. Bill Simmons in his The Book of Basketball also points to the watered down of talent in the league at that time (2010). Simmons might argue that the ’86 Celtics still reign as the greatest ever, and I must say, it makes for a very intriguing debate about time periods; however, the sheer dominance of the Warriors’ starters along with the productivity of their bench still convince me that no team could beat them in a seven-game series.\n\nThis post isn’t interested in debating which team is the best and why though. My interest lies in the team construction that makes a team dominant and successful. Why are the ’86 Celtics and ’17 Warriors regarded as the best? What do (did) they have that other teams don’t? And, of course, what could theoretically make them better? Ultimately, this theoretical framework will inform a forthcoming article (series?) where I construct the Second Tier Universe Cup Team. If you’re anything like me, you’ll find this new wrinkle more interesting than the first.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous article where I criticized Team USA’s Olympic team after analyzing the best superstar duos and trios in history:\n\nThis lays a solid groundwork for showing what is required to be the best for superstars to mesh: at least a dominant scorer, multiple excellent defenders, and multiple above average playmakers with one excellent playmaker.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “Building a Super Team and Other Observations,” 2016\n\nThe question now is broader and requires more definitions though because no theory (even basketball theory) is complete with pedantic definitions, so buckle up, and I promise that the end result of reading this series will be worth it for looking at basketball with a new perspective.\n\nAt their core, it seems that every basketball player can be boiled down to four distinct archetypes much like an RPG like “The Elder Scrolls.” These archetypes depend on four core skills: playmaking, scoring, defense, and rebounding. One can reduce each of these skills near infinitely to capture the myriad subtleties involved with the beautiful game, but I won’t spend much time doing that now. If you want a weird, philosophical dive into a Borgesian analysis of Ginobili’s creativity, then I urge you to read this and this article. I will try and differentiate a bit between very different skillsets within these archetypal skills such as offensive rebounding vs. defensive rebounding and off-ball shooting scorers vs. isolations scorers.\n\nJust replace these with basketball terms, and you basically have what I’m talking about.\n\nI have broken down each of these archetypal categories into a 0-10 scale where each number is associated with a tier of ability (again, like an RPG). This scale is as follows: Transcendent- 10-9; Elite – 8-7; Proficient – 6-5; Average – 4; Sub-par – 3-2; Inadequate – 1-0. I’ll discuss the meaning behind each of these a little later.\n\nIs this an exact science? Oh goodness no, but it’s a good place to start when trying to define team building. My gut tells me, as I more simply stated in that aforementioned article, that successful teams have an abundance of playmakers and defenders, at least one player who can score at will, and adequate rebounding.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? To me, a playmaker is a player that can create offense for his teammates. Most people look to assists to measure this, but the skill goes far beyond that. It includes players who help the offense function smoother through unselfishness and a skillset that draws their opponents’ attention. For example, players like Magic Johnson and Steve Nash score very high in this category because of how they can set their teammates up to make easy shots (they also post extremely high assist totals). Conversely, Stephen Curry and LeBron James would also score very high despite their average assist numbers because of their different abilities – Curry’s tremendous gravity and LeBron’s strength and IQ – promote teammate success. Essentially, if a playmaker is on the court, his team’s offense shouldn’t stagnate. We can differentiate playmakers in three ways: excellent passers who set up individual teammates for easy shots (let’s call them “Dime Droppers”), unselfish passers who don’t hold the ball too long during an offensive possession (let’s call them “Cogs”), and players who excel in both these categories (“Floor Generals”).\n\nA scorer then is a player who can score the basketball. Groundbreaking, right, but the intrigue lies in the details. How do you compare a scorer like Dominique Wilkins and Peja Stojakovic? How do you compare Ray Allen with Tracy McGrady? How do you compare Shaq with Kobe? Differentiating these abilities is key to building a successful lineup because basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills (to me, this is the true beauty of the Warriors’ offense, and I will get to that later). If a team has five Carmelo Anthonys, every Carmelo won’t average 30 points per game on good efficiency. While we can definitely differentiate scorers into many many categories, let’s just stick to just a few for now: players who need the ball in their hands to create scoring opportunities (“Ball Dominant”), floor spacers who score efficiently off spot-up and other off-ball shooting possessions (“Floor Spacers” actually has a classic ring to it), and players who can either (or both) dive to the basket or run in transition for easy scoring opportunities (“Runners”), and the combinations of these skills (it’s tough coming up with names).\n\n…basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “NBA Theory: Player Archetypes and Team Construction Part 1,” 2017\n\nA defender is a player who makes it more difficult for the other team to score. By far, this is the most difficult to quantify statistically, and even with the advent of analytics, we have no great way to express a player’s defensive worth through a singular number, so specific player categorizations are more open for debate. This makes comparing the worth of two players’ defensive impacts extremely difficult as discussed by Ben Dowsett. Which would be more impactful for a team defense: Gobert’s stalward rim-protection or Draymond Green’s ability to seamlessly switch 1-5? As always, the answer is that it depends. Defense can be broken down to four different categories: a defender who can shut down a single matchup (“Lockdown Defender”), a player who protects the basket effectively (“Rim Protector”), switch-happy players that can defend multiple positions and allow the team to switch more smoothly (“Chameleons” because they can blend in with any system), and players who can disrupt offenses off the ball by playing free safety, so to speak (“Roamers”).\n\nFinally, rebounders are players who clean the glass either on the offensive or defensive glass. Like scoring, this is probably best quantified through the many advanced statistics at our disposal such as Offensive Rebound Percentage and Contested Rebounds. This can be split into two categories: players who excel at grabbing offensive rebounds (“Offensive Rebounders”) and players who excel at grabbing defensive rebounds (“Defensive Rebounders”).\n\nBefore I can apply this theory to any specific player, it’s first necessary to define each level of grading on the above continuum. Starting at the bottom (now, where am I?), we have “Inadequate” which applies to a deficiency in the specific skill that significantly hurts the team. This is a bit tricky because some skills aren’t as important for certain positions such as rebounding and, to a small degree, defense for point guards while a center who isn’t a good rebounder would cause a net negative for his team. Scoring a “Sub-par” means that a player has a deficiency in a certain skill, but that deficiency isn’t as much of a concern as an Inadequate skill. Think of Andre Roberson’s free-throw shooting as a good example. It’s poor enough that teams can employ the “Hack-a” strategy against him which significantly hurts the Thunder; however, if he were just above this level where teams couldn’t target him, I would consider that “Sub-par.”\n\nBeing “Proficient” and “Average” are very difficult to differentiate between, but I would draw the line at reliability. A player who is “Proficient” in a specific skill is one who can, most of the time, execute that skillset. Players like J.R. Smith add an extra level of difficulty in this because he defies the reliability aspect of this definition; however, I would feel comfortable with him shooting open threes over most any “Average” shooters while the apex of his skillset is significantly higher than “Average” shooters.\n\nHere’s where things get interesting and where teams are truly constructed. Players who fall within the “Elite” and “Transcendent” levels are those who are considered stars. Remember this: teams cannot be successful without “Elite” or higher skills in multiple skillsets (I’ll discuss which ones a little later). On a definitional level, these are the two easiest levels to differentiate between. A player with an “Elite” skillset means that they are one of the best in the league at the time that they are (were) playing at that skillset. Players who have a “Transcendent” skillset means that they are in the upper echelon of that skillset regardless of time. You could pluck them out of their temporal playing moment and plop them in any time period, and they would still be one of the best. Their ability “transcends” time.\n\nNow we can get to the interesting part and apply these definitions to actual players to see what team makeups have been successful. Just as a reminder, players cannot be judged as a conglomeration of their entire careers. A player must be chosen during a specific year of their career that spans both the playoffs and the regular season. You can apply this to either one of the two, but you miss out by not judging a player based off the entirety of the season and post-season. In the next article, I’ll lay out how this will look for specific players.\n\nArticle Length: ~2,200 words or about 10-13 minutes of reading\n\nThe season is well underway, and I haven’t written a single blog post about it so far. I’ve tried tweeting more this season, but honestly that’s not my cup of tea. I tried (in the last couple of days) being more active on Facebook, but again I think social media just isn’t my forte. So I apologize for ignoring tons of important happenings around the league, but my post for today is one that I wanted to release before the season began. We’ve past the quarter mark, so unfortunately, I know too much to make it quite as fun.\n\nThis blog post is based off a classic sports question: if I could start an NBA team with any two players, who would I pick? I’ll do three variations of his question today regarding this season, the next five seasons, and the next ten seasons. For the first part, I want to start a team by choosing only two players to start. My one and only goal for the season is to win a championship. For the second part, my only goal is to win as many championships in five years, and the pattern continues for the third part. Let’s get started.\n\nQuestion One: which two players do I choose to win a championship this season?\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, LeBron is a lock for one of the two spots. Even as his age rises, his production remains at an astoundingly high level, and nothing illustrates that more than last Finals where he led both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks while dragging his down-and-out Cavaliers from a 3-1 deficit against the unanimous MVP in Curry and the greatest regular season team in NBA history. Truly a storybook Finals for LeBron, the Cavaliers, and the city of Cleveland. Even this year where LeBron has taken his biggest step back in scoring, his team leads the Easter Conference, and he’s still in the top 5 MVP candidates for the year. You cannot convince me that LeBron isn’t worthy of selection.\n\nThe second choice is much more difficult, and honestly I tried writing this post a couple of months ago, but I became so frustrated by not being able to select a second player that I just left it alone. In my opinion, only two players deserve to be in the conversation, and interestingly enough, they are currently teammates: Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry (side note: Anthony Davis is really close to also being included, but I can’t trust his porcelain structure to remain intact for an entire season/post-season). Most would say that Curry is the obvious choice as he is coming off one of (if not the) most impressive season in NBA History (playoffs excluded), but the two things that greatly concern me about him are his defense and his performance post knee injury. Like Bird before him, Curry makes up for his poor one-on-one defensive attributes by being an above average team defender which helped him lead the league in steals per game, but those instincts aren’t enough completely cover his defensive woes as the Cavaliers game-plan in the Finals proved.\n\nKevin Durant has proven this season that he can fit right into an already established team by simply taking more efficient and more open shots. I was worried that Durant would struggle with the Warriors game-plan which is predicated off ball movement and player movement (the latter of which never being Durant’s strong suit), but he has done a marvelous job of letting himself move off the ball. In the past, Durant’s defense has been hit-or-miss at best, but starting with the Warriors/Thunder playoff series last season, Durant has been on a tear defensively, and with the Warriors, he has posted career highs in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and blocks along with his second best defensive rating during a season.\n\nMy final verdict is that I would start a team with LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Their games complement each other perfectly as LeBron looks to facilitate and run the plays as Durant likes to, well, score efficiently. When locked in, they would become the most terrifying defensive duo on the league, and on the fastbreak, no duo in history could hold a candle to them. Currently LeBron leads the league in fastbreak points per game (where he shoots 76.5%) and Durant is fifth in the league (where he shoots 60.6%).\n\nVerdict: LeBron/Durant\n\nHindsight verdict 2015-2016: LeBron/Curry\n\nQuestion Two: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next five seasons?\n\nFive years is a long time in the basketball world. Five years ago the Miami Heat were just coming off an embarrassing Finals loss to the Dallas Mavericks led by god-mode Nowitzki. In the present, Nowitzki will probably retire after the end of the season. The point is that choosing who will be consistently successful over the course of five years is extremely difficult if not impossible. Five years ago, Curry only played 26 games, and people thought that his career would be lost to injuries. Mind-blowing huh?\n\nPlayers within the 23-27 year-old range are more than likely the best candidates for this thought experiment. Right around 29 is general a player’s prime, but many players find their best seasons to be right around 31-33. Unfortunately, this means that LeBron won’t make my duo. For as many minutes as he has played already, I can’t see him staying this productive until he’s 36-37. Sorry ‘Bron.\n\nDurant is 28 and some change, but I’m going to have to select him as my first option. Along with my defense of him above, I have a strong feeling that his game will age gracefully a-la Kobe, MJ, and Dirk who learned to dominate the midrange and post-game. His length and size will always make him a serviceable defender as well.\n\nLike the first question, the second choice here is much tougher. LeBron is the perfect starting point because he works best with other high-volume scorers e.g. Kyrie Irving and Dwyane Wade. Durant is not like this, and I’m not quite sure what kind of player would complement him the best (besides LeBron). I’m not picking Curry because A), I don’t think he’s necessarily the best choice for Durant’s sidekick, and B) did you know Curry is actually a couple hundred days older than Durant? I don’t see Curry’s dominance holding up as he hits his early thirties.\n\nDurant needs to be with a player that doesn’t look to score as a first option. Durant can run an offense well-enough, but I would preferably have a different, better playmaking player running the show. Or, I could go a different direction and select a hard-nosed, defensive menace of a post-player. Why am I not immediately jumping at the chance to pair Anthony Davis and Durant to make the longest duo in NBA history? Well I’m not sold on Anthony Davis. He has the range, athleticism, and defensive speed of a young Kevin Garnett, but he simply doesn’t playmake well (he has more turnovers than assists this season), he shoots too many jumpshots, and he is extremely fragile. Am I overthinking things? Of course I am. Really I think a great complement for Durant would be Draymond Green, but I feel that I’d be wasting my second pick if I didn’t take a more elite player.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’d regret not taking Davis. I can’t imagine a team with quick enough or big enough defenders to guard both of them adequately…hell teams can’t guard either one adequately as it is! With the right defensive scheme too, teams would struggle mightily with a Durant/Davis switching scheme. The possibilities are endless.\n\nQuick explanation: I feel that so far, Westbrook, Harden, and Leonard have been swept under the rug. Westbrook and Harden (especially Westbrook) are putting up anomalous seasons, the likes of which we have never witnessed. Both of them are magnificent to watch, and they truly are winners. Unfortunately, I can’t trust Westbrook’s decision making, and Harden’s defensive awareness and leadership leave much to be desired. Leonard to me is still a solid tier beneath these players, and I think he’s a much better fit with a primary defender and playmaker than a straight up scorer.\n\nVerdict: Kevin Durant/Anthony Davis\n\nHindsight Verdict 5 years ago (2011-12): LeBron/Durant\n\nQuestion Three: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next ten seasons?\n\nLeBron will be 41. Durant will be 38. Vince Carter will be 40ish days from 50. I think it’s time to really scout the young guns. Right now, this is the most excited that I can recall being excited for a current batch of young talent such as Karl Anthony Towns, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving (dude is only 24??), Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, D’Angelo Russell, and the list goes on. The next 15 years will be extremely exciting to watch develop.\n\nTwo huge factors contribute to my decision about these two players: who will contribute sufficiently to win soon (front-loaders) and who will contribute consistently for the next 10 years (back-loaders). If I focused primarily on that 19-24 year-old range, the two top front-loaders are Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. Irving has been a starting point guard for two Finals qualifying teams, and iced a game 7 to win the Finals against the 73-9 Warriors. Irving is not afraid of the moment, and Davis is seasoned enough to jump right into the playoffs.\n\nIn a shocking twist of events though, I will not be selecting either of these two players. Kyrie Irving is a truly special scorer, and in isolation situations this season, nobody stacks up to him. The below scatter plot show the 15 players who attempt the most field goals per game in an isolation situation. The Y-Axis shows those players’ effective field goal percentages. Remember: being above the line is a good thing.\n\nWhile he is special as a scorer, I think that he’s somewhat lost as the main ball-handler. He needs a player like a LeBron, Giannis, Draymond, or any player with whom Curry would thrive. As the above link also discusses, his defense leaves much to be desired.\n\nI really can’t put my finger on why I’m not as high on Anthony Davis. Maybe it’s his injury history, his overrated defense, his poor playmaking ability, or a combination of the three. Davis is special, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think he’s as special as some might make you believe. He’s long and athletic, which is a combination, as I’ve discussed previously, is one that I cherish. So what two players could impossibly long and athletic enough to fit my desires? What players really seem to be on the brink of revolutionizing the league? I’ll tell you who, but I must admit that I’m wildly biased in my first pick. I choose Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nGiannis finally made the leap this year. As I’ve tweeted about before, Giannis is in the running for defensive player of the year. He also can (somewhat) play and guard all five positions, and is confidently leading a Middleton-less Bucks squad above .500. Giannis is legit, and the fact that he only recently turned 22 means that he’s only going to get better and smarter. His athleticism may dwindle slightly as he ages, but his length never will. He still makes plays that nobody in the league can make, and the last player to make similar plays was a younger dude named LeBron James (and oddly enough, a younger Josh Smith).\n\nPorzingis is a unicorn through and through. We simply have never seen anybody like him before. He runs like a deer, plays incredible post defense, shoots a very consistent jumpshot, and has an even temperament. I don’t want to throw the name Dirk out there yet, so I’ll let the stats back me up.\n\nSome may scream that KAT or Embiid should get the nod over him if I’m going to go with a lanky, potential-filled big man, but KAT’s defense is overrated, and he has a tendency to jump into hero-ball mode. Embiid, much like Davis, scares me with his injury history. Maybe he’ll become a post player like we’ve never seen, but maybe he’ll be the next Greg Oden….I’m not denying that Embiid’s potential and skill is off the chart. Much like Oden, Embiid is incredibly skilled and locked into playing defense. Check out this second scatter plot showing the 21 players who defend the most shots at the rim per game. The lower the plot point, the lower the percentage to which the defender holds his opponent to.\n\nThe two lowest points? Embiid and Porzingis. When defending the rim, they cause their opponents to shoot 15.7 percentage points and 14.4 percentage points respectively worse than the shooter would normally shoot.\n\nVerdict: Giannis/Porzingis\n\nHindsight Verdict 10 years ago (2006-07): LeBron James/Tim Duncan (closely followed by Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade as a second choice)\n\nAll stars are either from Basketball Reference or NBA Stats. Graph data extracted from NBA Stats play type data.\n\nArticle length: about 1,500 words or 7-12 minutes of reading.\n\nBefore I really dive into this newest installment, I’m going to take this moment to announce some slight changes to the actual posts on NBAcademic. Lately, my posts have been much longer than I intended which A) emulates the not-so-great side of the (RIP) Grantland articles which makes people lose interest quickly, and B) sucks up an immense amount of my time (not that I would rather do anything than glorified NBA fan fiction for a living). Because of these two reasons along with the fact that I truly do plan on writing an a book on defining the greatest player of all time, I hope to significantly shorten up my posts. Whether or not I will be successful in stifling my propensity to ramble about basketball is yet to be determined.\n\nThis final post before the end of the regular season deals with building a new hypothetical team (with much less detail) with some new rules. The construction of this 12-man roster must adhere to the following rules: 1) players are selected based on their 2015-16 performance, 2) the team’s salary cap CANNOT exceed 84.7 million dollars (the soft cap is 70 million, but I’m using the luxury tax cutoff to give myself some more leeway. If this really pisses you off, we can certainly discuss it), 3) all player salaries will be rounded to the nearest $100,000, and finally 4) only one rookie contract on the team.\n\nI toyed around with the team a bit, and more than anything, I decided on players that can either shoot threes, handle versatile duties, or defend at an elite level. Below are the players I selected along with their respective salaries (in millions).\n\nGuards:\n\nStephen Curry – 11.4\n\nJJ Redick – 6.9\n\nAvery Bradley – 7.7\n\nJJ Barrea – 4\n\nPatty Mills – 3.6\n\nForwards:\n\nLeBron James – 23\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo – 2* (Rookie Contract)\n\nJae Crowder – 6\n\nDirk Nowitzki – 8.3\n\nCenters:\n\nTim Duncan – 5\n\nHassan Whiteside – 1\n\nIan Mahimi – 4\n\nWhen I was making the team, I also wanted to as closely copy the Warriors’ roster style as I could. Think of the players in this way: Curry=Curry, Thompson=Redick, Barnes=Crowder, Green=LeBron; Giannis, Bogut=Duncan. When viewed through that lens, a lineup with those five should be absolutely devastating because everyone on this team improves upon (or nearly so) the skill of the player they are replacing (with the exception of Thompson vs. Redick possibly).\n\nThe obvious top choice for my team here is Steph Curry because he is both the best player in the NBA right now (though LeBron and Durant are very closely nipping at his feet), and he is paid a criminally low salary (with respect to other NBA players of course). You could literally pay for two Currys on your team for the price of one LeBron! That opens up some flexibility in signing a huge contract player, much like LeBron.\n\nHonestly, I think LeBron and Curry’s play-styles complement each other perfectly. LeBron is a willing and passer who loves surrounding himself with 3-point shooters (see Ray Allen, JR Smith, Kyrie Irving, Shane Battier, Daniel Gibson), and relishes in getting players open three-point shots. Imagine the opportunities that LeBron would get in the typical Curry/Green pick-and-rolls that result in 4 vs. 3 scenarios.\n\nhttp://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/11/8/9693292/lebron-james-showed-off-his-x-ray-vision-by-throwing-a-one-handed\n\nA one-handed, offhand (sorta) lob pass for the corner three. Brilliant.\n\nLet’s watch some more of his passing brilliance.\n\nBoth Crowder and Bradley bring that Brad Stevens coached Celtics toughness that I so respect. Crowder is a strong, quick-handed beast of a defender with very high defensive IQ. Not only does he rack up tons of steals, but he also forces them. Bradley handles defense with a different skillset which mostly includes incredible athleticism, lightning fast lateral quickness, and exceptional timing. Bradley is without question one of the pestiest defenders in the league with his ability to latch onto a player and chase him through a network of screens. This article nicely describes a game-study of Bradley and Crowder’s defensive effects. If you have the time and/or the resources, go back and watch the Warriors/Celtics game that Boston won. Bradley showcases his lockdown D brilliantly. A final note about both of these Celtics players is that both are very reliable three-point shooters, and 3-D guys around LeBron are extremely valuable.\n\nOne of my favorite defensive plays ever.\n\nYes, Tim Duncan is old, and yes, he is not the player that he used to be, but at the end of the day, he is anchoring one of the greatest defensive teams in history and is leading the league in Defensive Box Plus Minus (just ahead of Gobert, Millsap, Draymond, and Jordan). Now how does he still manage this? Well I don’t like to hyperbolize, but in my opinion, Duncan has one of the top-5 Defensive IQs in NBA history (which also includes some list of MJ, Pippen, Payton, Rodman, Russell, and Wallace) which he uses to never be out of position on a defensive play. Seriously watch the man rotate around and cover for his teammates. He is always right where he is supposed to be. That’s the only reasonable way to be an effective defender at 90 years old.\n\nGiannis ends up coming off the bench for this team because, as I expressed above, I think Crowder complements the starting lineup better. Crowder allows for better spacing and is excellent without the ball in his hands (this is a friendly remind to read Benjamin Morris’ “The Hidden Value of the NBA Steal”). While Giannis is a freakishly bothersome defender because of his length, his IQ on that end of the court has not caught up to his body, much like that gangly 7th grader on the court who bounds around like an injured gazelle. Also, Giannis is tremendous with the ball in his hands and would play the Draymond position well which are the two things LeBron thrives it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely going to run the Giannis/LeBron lineup to see the most devastating fastbreak combination since, well ever.\n\nNow imagine them on the same team…..I’m not going to choose which is better by the way.\n\nBecause I want Duncan starting and I know that he will probably need his rest, I needed solid backup centers that could spell him when the time came. Whiteside perfectly slipped into that 6th man role this year, and as the season has progressed, he has grown in maturity, IQ, and general skills. He may be a black-hole in the post, but when you’re shooting over 60% from the field, sometimes passing seems like a poor decision. Either way, he stretches the floor moderately well, blocks shots with timing that rivals Ben Wallace’s, and puts shots back with fierce intensity.\n\nDirk is my biggest gamble on the team. All-in-all, he’s a great guy that easily meshes with any roster and would happily accept any role. He continues to be the most important cog in a moderately successful Mavericks team despite being 37-years-old. He’s averaging 20 PPG while providing the typical spacing that has made him so dangerous through the years. He has lost a step when playing defense and while driving to the bucket, but with the right lineups, both of those issues can easily be hidden.\n\nAs for Mahimi, Mills, and Barrea, these are three players that more or less will sparingly get playing time. They all solidly fill a role where they don’t have to do much besides rebound, shoot threes, or bring a general amount of toughness. I trust any one of them out on the court, so if the injury bug ever strikes, they could seamlessly move into the rotations without screwing up the flow the team had.\n\nJust so that I squash a criticism before somebody brings it up, I left Damian Lillard’s absurdly low 4.2 million dollar rookie contract off the team for three reasons: 1) I’m greatly intrigued by Giannis’ flexibility and play style especially when combined with LeBron, 2) with Curry and LeBron on the team, Lillard would be the third offensive options, and I don’t know how well he would function with not being the primary ballhandler, and 3) he’s one of the worst defenders in the league. Seriously, Harden gets an unbelievable amount of criticism for his lackluster effort, but Lillard is miles worse. I don’t want to make the same mistake Cleveland made by pairing LeBron with two subpar superstar defenders (though, I have to admit, Curry has made great improvements this year).\n\nThink you can make a better team using the 84.7 million dollar cap? Let me know by hitting me up on any one of my forms of social media. I’m not particularly active on any of them (another change that needs to occur), but I promise that I will respond.\n\nCitations:\n\nWilliams, Jared “Defending Basketball’s Best Play: The Steph/Draymond Pick and Roll”\n\nWesterholm, Tom “Boston Celtics analysis: Jae Crowder, Avery Bradley, perimeter defense shut down Washington Wizards”\n\nMorris, Benjamin, “The Hidden Value of the NBA Steal”\n\nNathan, Alec “The Case for Hassan Whiteside as the NBA’s Most Improved Player”\n\nArticle length: about 1,300 words or 7-11 minutes of reading.\n\nWow it’s been a long time since I’ve posted something. It’s been a wild ride so far this season too, so I apologize for not bringing you my top-shelf content a bit more frequently, especially with the semi-recent destruction of ESPN’s Grantland.\n\nBut enough about that, let’s talk basketball. What I want to introduce today is a thought experiment that takes up more of my thinking than I would like to admit. If any of you have read Bill Simmons’ basketball-biblical text The Book of Basketball, then you will notice the concept, although I’m changing it a bit. In his book, he assembled what he called “The Wine Cellar Team” which is the best twelve-man roster he could assemble in all of NBA history to compete in an epic 7-game series against a group of aliens…..no for real, that’s totally the premise. What makes this more intriguing than other similar discussions is the wrinkle that he chose players not based off an arbitrary “in their prime” statement. For instance, in picking Michel Jordan, which Jordan do you choose? ’92-93? ’96-97? Personally, I’d take the ’92-93 Jordan (understand the wine reference?) for reasons that are a bit off topic to explain here. As pedantic as it may seem, it really adds a level of analysis when deciding on the perfect time.\n\nIn general, I’m more interested in post-2000’s NBA action, so my series today adds two other rules to the equation: 1). I can only choose specific players/years from the 2000-2001 season onward and 2). Instead of a seven game series, I’m choosing a team for a full 82-game season along with the four rounds of traditional NBA playoffs. I dig the alien theme, so let’s imagine our teams are competing for intergalactic supremacy in the first ever Universe Cup season.\n\nChoosing twelve players over the past fifteen years is much more difficult than one might originally think. When it comes to lasting for a full season, it takes personalities that can mesh, different and complimentary skills, longevity and resistance to injury, and, simply put, guys that can flat out ball. Now twelve players is a very short list, so please please please note that I am not choosing the greatest players of the 21st century. Far from it. I want to assemble the most cohesive, complimentary team known, with, of course, some high-profile names. Because of this, guys that you might immediately think as automatic picks will be left off the team, and it is NOT because I want to cause a controversy. Once I complete the team, I will go over and defend why certain players didn’t make the team and who was right on the bubble.\n\nAt least one of these players will be making my team.\n\nOne final note is that since I have taken players’ full season and playoffs into account, I will be excluding the 2015-2016 season until it has concluded. Believe me, a couple players have been making the case from this season, but it’s too early to tell.\n\nWithout further ado, here is the Earth’s official Universe Cup Roster (and by official I mean I will more than likely be updating and editing it at the end of every year, or in the middle of next week).\n\nThe Starters:\n\nLeBron James ’12-13: Regular Season PPG: 26.8, RPG: 8, APG: 7.3, FG%: 56.5; NBA Champion; Finals MVP; MVP; 2nd in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting; Advanced Stats: led league in Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), Box Plus/Minus (BPM), Offensive Box Plus Minus (OBPM), Win Shares (WS), Offensive Win Shares (OWS), and WS/48, and PER\n\nTim Duncan ’02-03: Playoffs 24 games, PPG: 24.7, RPG:15.4, APG: 5.3, BPG: 3.3; NBA Champion; Finals MVP; MVP; All Defensive 1st Team; Advanced Stats: Led league in WS; highest VORP in NBA playoffs history\n\nYou can argue with me all you want, but these two are the greatest players of our generation, but putting them exactly in the NBA hierarchy is for another day. I want to take the time defending the specific years chosen because I don’t think anybody will argue with them starting.\n\nLeBron’s specific year was a bit difficult because of his absolutely ridiculous 2008-2009 campaign, and even though he was younger and more athletic in that year, I still defend ’12-13 as being the clear-cut choice. The one thing that stands out to me is his unprecedented efficiency at a league-leading volume. Not only did he lead the league in 2-point shots, he also was second only to Deandre Jordan in 2-point percentage. To make that more impressive, 30+ percent of LeBron’s shots came as 2-pointers from at least ten feet away (at least 229 of his 765 field goals) whereas about 7 of DJ’s 314 field goals (2.2%) were from the same range; instead, 179 field goals (57%) of DJ’s field goals were dunks. Don’t tell me that’s not mind-boggling.\n\nBeyond his efficiency, LeBron showed a newly developed poise after shedding his villainous role and winning a championship. The weight of being ringless had been lifted, and he could more naturally let his game flow alongside a declining but still effective Wade. LeBron is a selfless passer whose propensity to go for the homerun assist can actually be a bit of a detriment; however, I will always take a pass-first player of LeBron’s caliber because ball-movement is a top-down mentality in the NBA. Not only that, but LeBron has proven himself to be one of the most deadly passers in NBA history.\n\nNow let us talk about Tim Duncan. Most would argue that his game is as boring as the preceding sentence, but one man’s boring is another man’s unwavering consistency. The Spurs have never had a season with a winning percentage below 61% (approximately 50 wins) since drafting Tim Duncan. In fact, they would have 18 straight seasons of at least 50 wins had it not been for the lockout shortened 1998-99 season. They have also won been to the Finals six times with a total of five championships. Duncan has been the cornerstone of that dynasty.\n\nNo matter the situation, Duncan seems to have adapted his game to fit it. Many people forget the young, athletic Duncan around whom the Spurs offense completely focused. He beat teams with post-up, turnarounds, and coast-to-coast finishes off rebounds.\n\nYeah, that’s Duncan absolutely posterizing dudes….and hitting a clutch three (fun fact: that was Duncan’s only three that season).\n\nTwo of the most underrated aspects of Duncan’s game were his defense and his passing. Playing during the Garnett, Wallace, Camby era, Duncan never got his due share for his defensive anchoring prowess (he led the league in defensive win shares four times…it’s a travesty that he never won DPOY). Along with that, Duncan was always willing to give up the ball. Popovich’s perfectly implanted offense once the big-three became established would never have worked had Duncan not been such a selfless, winning obsessive leader. This doesn’t mean that he didn’t have an absolute killer instinct that rivaled anybody in NBA history. His greatest performance appropriately came in the 2003 NBA finals where he dropped an astonishing 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks. For those of you counting at home, that’s two blocks away from a quadruple double…in the Finals. Duncan was, and always will be, a freak.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t get as far as I would have liked in the inaugural post of this series. Now that I have laid the groundwork though, the rest should dedicated solely to player selection making the whole process that much faster. Now you all will have to wait in uncontrollable anticipation to see which of your favorite stars made the cut.\n\nArticle length: about 1,400 words or 7-10 minutes of reading.\n\nSport, above all else, is an artistic expression. Each individual sport is differentiated by the multi-faceted minutiae developed only through the tedious hours practicing them. At the base of it all, fandom is defined by how much a sport’s subtleties appeals to your aesthetic senses. Is it the heavy hits of football, the soaring dunks of basketball, or the scorpion kicks of soccer that fill you with an overwhelming sense of vicarious euphoria, or the even more subtle route defenders, pick dodgers, or triangle passers?\n\nWhenever NBA.com releases a new highlight video, I honestly feel cheated when a certain play doesn’t make the cut. When Giannis takes the ball the length of the court, spins between two defenders, and dunks on a player, I leap out of my seat and want share it with the world. I run to my roommates’ rooms. I text my friends. I Tweet it. It doesn’t matter who sees it as long as somebody, anybody, shares my adrenaline-fueled excitement. The trick is finding somebody that will actually share that feeling.\n\nThis post was inspired by a conversation I had with my girlfriend about dunking. In summation, she essentially asked me what the big deal about dunking is. “Why do you care so much about being able to do it? Can’t every guy that plays basketball dunk? Isn’t a three-pointer more impressive?”\n\nLet’s be honest, I love to play basketball, and with that, I love to share my victories in basketball. My girlfriend has only known me as one that can dunk, and with her not being around many other basketball players, and with me having to personally show her a few times, she didn’t appreciate the difference between a successful rim-grazer when the wind is with you, and an in-traffic, head-at-rim slam after single-handedly breaking down a defense.\n\nThis is me (theoretically speaking).\n\nThis is an aesthetic expression of athleticism.\n\nTrust me, I’m not making fun of her, not by any means. I’ve watched wrestling before. I understand that what I’m watching is the culmination of thousands of hours of practice, grueling workouts in the weight room, and personal sacrifices that don’t show to the typical fan, but it just doesn’t, for lack of better terms, get me going. At the end of the day, that’s what appeals to me about basketball: that empathetic connection I have during every single play.\n\nThat’s the metaphysical space of a highlight that most intrigues me: the connection between my empathy and my desire to emulate the play. If you play basketball, or any sport for that matter, what is your play style? Do you like to score from long range, or shut-down the other team’s best player? Chances are those are the highlights that most intrigue you. Hell, think of it from the perspective of a prospective fiction writer: does she find herself slowly copying the style of her favorite author, even when drafting an email to her friends? Thought so.\n\nWhen I grab a rebound at my local gym, I try to push the subject. I throw it ahead, sprinting down the court, imagining myself finishing the play through contact like LeBron, rising above the defense like Charles Barkley, or freezing the defense with a sensory-defying no-look pass.\n\nProblem is, when I pound that ball down the court at break-neck speed, some sneaky defender inexplicably picks my pocket. Every. Single. Time. It’s like I’m an inadequate dribbler or something, but that can’t be possible. Right? Well the truth is that this is happening at a college rec facility with talent that never made it even to a D1 college for basketball. Imagine trying to do that against players that are paid millions of dollars to prevent you from making that same move. Imagine also being seven inches tall and forty pounds heavier when you make that move. That’s exactly what I couldn’t wrap my head around when Blake Griffin danced around the Nuggets like he was a member of the Globetrotters.\n\nIt looks so easy right? The difficult thing to grasp when you see somebody dribbling through a phalanx of defenders as if they were merely statues, or when you see somebody pull up from thirty feet when he is defended heavily by a, and I can’t stress this enough, professional defender is that there isn’t anything physical, anything tangible that can explain that move.\n\nWhen Curry bamboozles the entire Clippers roster, he’s not doing it with an iron-wrought body or with God-given athleticism. Some psychology or neurobiology major would probably stick their nose up at me and haughtily describe the exact development of neural pathways after hundreds of hours of repetition, but for once let’s just leave aside the science and just contemplate what that means. Curry has no distinguishing physical feature that allows him to perform that move. I have everything within my physical repertoire to perform that exact move right now, but can’t because of his mind-body connection developed through practice.\n\nThere’s a scene in “The Matrix” where Neo is literally plugged into a computer program and downloads the requisite mind-body connection to perform Kung-Fu at an unparalleled level. This prompts the famous battle scene between Morpheus and Neo where Morpheus drops the realest advice ever: “Don’t think you are. Know you are,” following by, “Quit trying to hit me and hit me!”\n\nTheoretically, what then allows for Neo to learn Kung-Fu instantaneously? It’s that moment of being plugged in that is holding all of humanity from becoming a dribbling, shooting freak like Steph Curry. It is that moment when one lets his subconscious grab the reigns of an action, when the thousands of hours of practice and repetition overrule the overbearing grasp of the mind, when it is no longer dribbling through the greatest defenders on the planet but the simple action of rendering the basketball extension of your body, much like how one handles breathing on a moment-to-moment basis. It’s a learned instinct, a conditioned response to some external stimuli that drives the NBA’s greatest highlights. Ray Allen didn’t plan on hitting the biggest three-pointer in NBA history when, in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals, Chris Bosh collected a LeBron James miss and kicked it out to a back-pedaling Allen. If I were to approach Ray right now to ask him what he was thinking when that ball was coming his way, I bet he would respond with, “Nothing.” The greatest NBA players, and the greatest NBA highlight reel players, were also some of the most cerebral players of all time, but part of that intelligence required them to understand when to just let go.\n\nKia recently released a couple of commercials starring Blake Griffin within “The Zone.” As comical as those commercials are, that best represents the exact space I’m trying to describe. It is a nonphysical space of a special part of the subconscious that is tapping into the wealth of tediously practiced skills. It is a rare space where one knows she is “on fire,” and can perform accordingly. It is that state of mind where one stands above his own subconscious takeover like a puppeteer and actively controls his own body’s succumbing. I can’t find the exact clip, but I remember once Jalen Rose and Bill Simmons talking about Kobe’s 81 point game. Simmons asked Rose if Kobe was talking any trash during the game, and Rose said, “No.” That is the definitive zone game, where Kobe had somehow tapped into his subconscious to make it bend at his will. That is an extra level of focus. One cannot enter the zone without already having the requisite ability developed, without having the requisite neural pathways blazed, and most importantly as Morpheus was telling Neo, without having the knowledge that you, plain simply, can. Don’t think about dunking on, crossing over, blocking, or shooting in the grill of your opponent. As Nike would say, “Just do it.” That my friends is all it takes to make an NBA highlight."
