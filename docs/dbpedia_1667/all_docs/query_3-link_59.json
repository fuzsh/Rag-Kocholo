        "text": "Editor’s Note: Find more of Jonathan Wasserman’s coverage of the 2023 NBA Draft on Bleacher Report or to read this article on BleacherReport.com, click here.\n\n(B/R) — For the past year-plus, Bleacher Report and the collective NBA world have watched and scrutinized the 2023 draft class. Whether from afar or up close in person, the study around each prospect has been rigorous. And it’s all led to this.\n\nThursday officially marks Victor Wembanyama Day the 2023 NBA Draft, and while no one expects the San Antonio Spurs to get cute at No. 1, genuine debates begin immediately following with the second overall pick.\n\nWhat happens next is in the hands of the 30 NBA franchises. They’ve done their homework; now it’s time to put their studies to the test.\n\nBelow you’ll find B/R’s final mock draft as we see it today.\n\n*Editor’s note: Some of the following analysis and intel was published in a previous Mock Draft.\n\n> Round 1\n\nPosition: PG\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nAge: 19\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets drafting Brandon Miller will lead to more trade talk around the No. 3 pick, given how difficult it is to picture a rotation with Scoot Henderson, Damian Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe.\n\nRegardless, someone seems likely to take Henderson at No. 3, given the perception that there is a gap between him and the field. Portland could also take him as the best player available and look to make a deal after the draft.\n\nAttention would naturally shift to Lillard for any possible trade request. The Blazers could also shop Simons and talk themselves into Henderson playing more of a facilitator role and taking some pressure off Lillard as he ages into his 30s.\n\n19. Golden State Warriors: Brandin Podziemski\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nTeam: Santa Clara\n\nAge: 20\n\nBrandin Podziemski strengthened his first-round case at the combine, leaving scouts more confident that his shot-making, playmaking and rebounding can translate.\n\nThe Santa Clara guard would give Golden State’s second unit some extra creation and shot-making.\n\n41. Charlotte Hornets (via Thunder): Seth Lundy (Penn State, SF, 23)\n\nTeams looking for shooting will have Seth Lundy highlighted on their boards after he hit 92 3-pointers and lit up NBA combine scrimmages with his balanced mechanics and quick, confident release\n\n42. Washington Wizards (via Bulls): Marcus Sasser (Houston, PG/SG, 22)\n\nTeams have been scared off by smaller scoring guards, but Marcus Sasser’s ball-handling and shooting versatility should be convincing enough for one team to picture a useful bench spark.\n\n43. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hawks): Kobe Brown (Missouri, SF, 23)\n\nKobe Brown will likely have to lose some weight from his 250-pound frame, but his shooting and passing skills point to an NBA fit and the second round.\n\n44. San Antonio Spurs: Sidy Cissoko (Overtime Elite, SG/SF, 19)\n\nMissing a signature skill hurts Sidy Cissoko, but his combination of secondary playmaking, capable shot-making and the defensive tools should create enough versatility for Round 2.\n\n45. Memphis Grizzlies: Jalen Pickett (Penn State, PG, Senior)\n\nJalen Pickett’s production and effectiveness with his shot-making and passing could sway a second-round team to look past his old man’s game and age (23).\n\n46. Atlanta Hawks (via Pelicans): Keyontae Johnson (Kansas State, SF/PF, 23)\n\nShooting, strong defensive tools and toughness should help Keyontae Johnson generate second-round interest from teams who see a two-way role player.\n\n47. Los Angeles Lakers: Terquavion Smith (North Carolina State, SG, 20)\n\nScouts have concerns over Terquavion Smith’s inefficiency and defense, but his shot-making and pick-and-roll offense should keep interest alive in the second round.\n\n48. Los Angeles Clippers: Jalen Wilson (Kansas, SF/PF, 22)\n\nThough Jalen Wilson struggled at the NBA combine, his college production, improved shot-making and strong frame will keep him in second-round conversations.\n\n49. Cleveland Cavaliers (via Warriors): Toumani Camara (Dayton, SF, 23)\n\nFrom the Portsmouth Invitational to Elite Camp and the NBA combine, Toumani Camara was productive throughout while offering an appealing mix of offensive versatility, capable shooting and high activity levels.\n\n50. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Heat): Chris Livingston (Kentucky, SF, Freshman)\n\nThis late, a team can bet on 19-year-old Chris Livingston’s high school shot-making and slashing, which didn’t pop as often in Kentucky’s deeper lineup.\n\n51. Brooklyn Nets: Emoni Bates (Eastern Michigan, SF, 19)\n\nWhile there is skepticism over Emoni Bates’ limited frame, athleticism for separating and feel for the game, the combination of 6-foot-8 size and shot-making could get him drafted this late.\n\n52. Phoenix Suns: Mouhamed Gueye (Washington State, PF/C, 20)\n\nIn a draft with limited true bigs, Mouhamed Gueye should hear his name called after a productive season that highlighted a combination of post skill, mid-range touch, face-up driving potential and rebounding motor.\n\n53. Minnesota Timberwolves (via Knicks): Ricky Council IV (Arkansas, SG/SF, 21)\n\nRicky Council IV is falling after a poor NBA combine and few signs of three-point improvement. He’ll be in the late second-round mix based on his explosiveness, creation flashes and two-point shot-making.\n\n54. Sacramento Kings: Tosan Evbuomwan (Princeton, PF, 22)\n\nThis late, it’s worth taking a flier on a unique big like Tosan Evbuomwan, an outstanding passer for a big who’s flashed glimpses of open shot-making and driving.\n\n55. Indiana Pacers (via Cavaliers): Jordan Miller (Miami, SF, 23)\n\nMarginal shooting improvement this season created some optimism, though Jordan Miller will draw second-round looks for his slashing, finishing and wing defense."
