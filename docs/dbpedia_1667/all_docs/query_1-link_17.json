        "text": "Members of the Pistons touch the NBA Finals trophy after they defeated the Lakers, four games to one, in the 2004 championship series. Would the 2004 Pistons raise the trophy had they played the 2017 Warriors? (Ryan Garza | Flint Journal file)\n\n2004 Pistons vs. 2017 Warriors a contrast in styles\n\nBy Scott DeCamp | sdecamp1@mlive.com\n\nIt was only a week ago that Rasheed Wallace said that his 2003-04 NBA champion Detroit Pistons squad would “run through” this year's Golden State Warriors team.\n\nBoth teams were loaded with talent and, Monday night, the Warriors claimed the NBA title with a 4-1 series win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nBut is Sheed right? Would the 2004 Pistons take down the Warriors?\n\nIn the ’04 finals, the defensive-minded Pistons put the clamps down on a Los Angeles Lakers team that featured Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Karl Malone and Gary Payton. The Pistons won the series in five games, allowing the Lakers to eclipse 90 points just once and limiting them to 80 points or fewer in three of the five games, including only 68 in Game 3.\n\nThe current group of Warriors is a high-octane outfit that operates on an offense-first approach. And while the Warriors may have more so-called “star power,” you could make a good argument that the Pistons’ mentality and the sum of their parts was better.\n\nWould it be enough?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com file and Associated Press)\n\nStarting point guard: Chauncey Billups vs. Steph Curry\n\nChauncey Ba-ba-ba-Billups was the engine for the Pistons’ title team in 2003-04 and he earned MVP honors in the NBA Finals. That season, the 6-foot-3 point guard averaged 16.9 points, 5.7 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. Billups shot 39.4 percent from the floor, 38.8 percent from 3-point range and 87.8 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nLike many leading players, Billups also had some intangibles that helped elevate his team. In the NBA Finals, he elevated his scoring average to 21 per game. With those things in mind, it’s debatable who had/has a bigger impact on his team – Billups or Steph Curry.\n\nThere is only one Steph Curry, though. The 6-3 prolific scorer averaged 25.3 points, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 1.8 steals this season while shooting 46.8 percent from the field, 41.1 percent from long range and 90 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nEdge: Curry\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com and Associated Press)\n\nStarting shooting guard: Richard Hamilton vs. Klay Thompson\n\nTake Klay Thompson out of the lineup, or get him on an off-night, and the Warriors can still win in many cases. Without Richard Hamilton, the Pistons didn’t stand a chance.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Hamilton was the Pistons’ leading scorer throughout the 2003-04 season at 17.6 ppg along with 4.0 assists, 3.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals per contest. He shot 45.5 percent from the floor and 86.8 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nThe 6-7 Thompson is a much more prolific shooter at 46.8 percent from the floor and 41.4 percent from 3-point range while averaging 22.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.1 assists this season. In the event that Thompson had to guard Rip, could he have kept up? Hamilton was the best at moving away from the ball and getting into position to score.\n\nEdge: Hamilton\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com and Associated Press)\n\nStarting small forward: Tayshaun Prince vs. Kevin Durant\n\nLet’s just cut to the chase on this one. As good a defender as Tayshaun was, he would have had his hands full containing Durant, especially the Durant who has shown up for these NBA Finals and earned series MVP.\n\nA knee injury sidelined the 6-foot-9 Durant in the regular season, when he was averaging 25.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists while shooting 53.7 percent from the floor, 37.5 percent from the long line and 88 percent from the foul line. But he returned to form and then some.\n\nIt's not that Prince was chopped liver. The 6-9 wing made solid contributions on the stat sheet with 10.3 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 2.3 apg. He'll forever be remembered for that timely, highlight-reel block of Reggie Miller earlier in the playoffs in 2004. But Prince is not Kevin Durant.\n\nEdge: Durant\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com and Associated Press)\n\nStarting power forward: Rasheed Wallace vs. Draymond Green\n\nIs there much point in comparing and contrasting measurables and stats with these guys? The 6-foot-11 Rasheed had four inches on Draymond and he averaged 3 ½ more points per game in 2003-04 than what Green did this season. But Draymond is Sheed’s equal when it comes to nastiness on the floor and trash talk.\n\nWe’ll throw the respective numbers out there anyway. Wallace averaged 13.7 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.1 steals and 2.0 blocks while shooting 43.1 percent from the field, 31.9 percent from 3-point land and 70.4 percent from the free-throw line. Green averaged 10.2 points, 7.9 rebounds. 7.0 assists, 2.03 steals and 1.39 blocks while shooting 41.8 percent from the floor, 30.8 percent from 3 and 71 percent at the line.\n\nThis one’s a toss-up: Sheed was an intimidating presence who would also stretch the floor, but Draymond is a true point-forward who makes things happen for others with his passing and basketball smarts.\n\nEdge: Push (yes, this is a cop-out)\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com file and Associated Press)\n\nStarting center: Ben Wallace vs. Zaza Pachulia\n\nThis really is no comparison. Wallace was so much more of a factor than Pachulia is. Big Ben was menacing, while Zaza pretty much just takes up space.\n\nPachulia shoots the ball better than Wallace did, at 53.4 percent from the floor compared to 42.1 percent, but Ben pulled down more than a dozen rebounds per game – more than twice as many as Zaza. Plus, Wallace averaged just under 10 points and three blocks, while Pachulia was at 6.1 points and 0.47 blocks this season.\n\nBig Ben had the intimidation factor, while Zaza seems like more of the goon/hack variety.\n\nEdge: Wallace\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com file and Associated Press)\n\nSixth man: Corliss Williamson vs. Andre Iguodala\n\nThis individual matchup may have never materialized on the floor as they’re different types of players.\n\nCorliss Williamson was a load at 6-foot-7, 245 pounds, and he was productive in his 20 minutes per game off the bench with 9.5 points and 3.2 rebounds. Andre Iguodala is more wiry and athletic, and he’s no less productive at 7.6 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.4 assists in about 14 ½ minutes per game.\n\nIf you’re talking 2004 Williamson vs. 2017 Iguodala, then Iguodala probably has the upper hand.\n\nEdge: Iguodala\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com file and Associated Press)\n\nPistons bench vs. Warriors bench\n\nIncluding sixth man Corliss Williamson, the Pistons’ bench in 2003-04 went a solid six deep with the likes of Mehmet Okur, Lindsey Hunter, Mike James, Chucky Atkins and Elden Campbell. That group averaged better than 40 points per game.\n\nThe Warriors’ bench also went about six deep, including Iguodala, who is joined in the main reserve group by Shaun Livingston, David West, JaVale McGee, Ian Clark and Patrick McCaw. This group contributed about 33 points per contest.\n\nWhile both teams’ benches would be considered solid if not strong, the Pistons’ group of reserves seemed to be stronger overall.\n\nEdge: Pistons\n\n(Photos courtesy of MLive.com file and Associated Press)\n\nCoach: Larry Brown vs. Steve Kerr\n\nOne is a Hall of Fame coach. The other is not – not yet, anyway.\n\nLarry Brown has been there, done that. In fact, it was during his first season with Detroit in 2003-04 during when he led the Pistons to the NBA title. The Warriors’ Steve Kerr is stacking up wins as fast as anybody and he wrapped up a second championship in three seasons.\n\nBut, for now, Brown has the coaching edge based on his experience and achievements.\n\nEdge: Brown\n\nThe Warriors' Kevin Durant, left, and Draymond Green have had plenty of times to celebrate this season. (Marcio Jose Sanchez | Associated Press)\n\nWarriors set the pace in 2016-17\n\nThe 2016-17 Warriors put up a gaudy 67-15 record in the regular season, far and away best in the league. They were the top-seeded team in these playoffs, and they certainly played like it. The Warriors finished with a 16-1 record in the playoffs, their lone loss coming in Game 4 against the Cavaliers.\n\nHow would the 2003-04 Pistons squad have fared in today’s NBA? Would they have still been 54-28 like they were back in that most recent title season? That season, the Pistons finished second in the Central Division behind the rival Indiana Pacers. The Pistons were the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nAre you ready to let the 2004 Pistons-2017 Warriors NBA Finals play out? Here we go below:\n\nGolden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant (35) is jacked up during his big Game 1 performance. (Ben Margot | Associated Press)\n\nChampionship faceoff: Game 1\n\nWarriors 105, Pistons 98\n\nGolden State has home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, so the first two games of the hypothetical NBA Finals are played on the West Coast.\n\nThe well-rested Warriors get off to a hot start before the jet-lagged Pistons find their legs and make a game of it. The Pistons pull within two, 89-87, early in the fourth quarter before they run out of gas. The Warriors are able to hold on.\n\nRasheed Wallace and Draymond Green waste no time with their war of words, getting assessed double technicals in the first quarter but somehow keeping their cool the rest of the way.\n\nKevin Durant continues to roll in the playoffs after he suffered a scary knee injury in the regular season, and he posts a triple-double for the Warriors with 27 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Richard Hamilton leads the Pistons with 22 points, four rebounds and five assists.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson celebrates as he walks off the floor following his team's Game 2 victory. (Marcio Jose Sanchez | Associated Press)\n\nGame 2\n\nWarriors 97, Pistons 94 (OT)\n\nDesperately trying to avoid slipping in an 0-2 hole, the Pistons pull out all the stops in Game 2 of the NBA Finals at Oracle Arena. They nearly pull it off, but a Klay Thompson 3 from the right corner at the buzzer forces overtime and Steph Curry’s back-to-back triples in the final minute of the extra session prove to be back-breakers.\n\nChauncey Billups scores a game-high 29 points, outdueling Curry in the point-guard matchup, but the effort is not enough to push the Pistons over the top.\n\nCurry finishes with 22 points on 6-of-14 shooting from long range. Thompson adds 17 points despite missing his first 12 attempts from 3-point range before making the pivotal 13th try forced OT.\n\nThe game is heated throughout, fueled by the antics of none other than Rasheed Wallace and Draymond Green.\n\nRasheed Wallace, right, and Richard Hamilton celebrate during a timeout called by the Warriors in the second quarter of Game 3.\n\nGame 3\n\nPistons 92, Warriors 78\n\nThis is the last NBA Finals series to be played at The Palace of Auburn Hills, and the Pistons return home to a raucous crowd.\n\nDetroit’s defense locks down Golden State’s perimeter and limits the Warriors to their lowest point total in three seasons in what was essentially a must-win for the Pistons. In another physical game, Rasheed Wallace comes to play for the Pistons in scoring a playoff-high 24. Sheed adds eight boards and four blocks in the inspired effort.\n\nDespite an uncharacteristic defensive performance from Draymond Green, the Saginaw native scores a team-high 18 points for the Warriors in a homecoming of sorts.\n\nThe Pistons could not afford to fall into a 3-0 hole and they managed to avoid it with a familiar effort.\n\nThe Pistons' Chauncey Billups, left, offers instructions to Corliss Williamson. (MLive.com file)\n\nGame 4\n\nPistons 115, Warriors 110\n\nDetroit’s grinding defense went missing at different moments during Game 4, but it did enough at key times to allow the Pistons to outscore the Warriors and even the series at two games apiece.\n\nThe series resumes with Game 5 and shifts back to Oracle Arena, where Golden State is 8-0 these playoffs.\n\nIn Game 4, Chauncey Billups again has the hot hand with a team-high 23 points on 5-of-8 shooting from 3-point land.
