        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - Detroit Pistons coach Flip Saunders said his team is totally different than it was at this time last year because of a renewed focus.\n\nThat's not good news for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nChauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton each scored 20 points, leading the Pistons to an easy 95-69 victory over Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Saturday night.\n\nThe Pistons are still kicking themselves for losing to the Miami Heat in the conference finals last year - after winning the title in 2004 and coming just short of repeating - and vowed to show how determined they are to at least get back to the NBA finals.\n\nIf the Eastern Conference's top-seeded team keeps playing like they have been, they will have a shot.\n\nDetroit was aggressive on defense, getting into passing lanes with their feet and hands, and balanced on offense.\n\nThe Pistons will host Game 2 on Monday night.\n\nChicago's Ben Gordon averaged 25.5 points and Andres Nocioni added 12 a game in the first-round sweep over the Heat, but were held to just seven and two points, respectively. Former Piston Ben Wallace had nine points, eight rebounds and a block.\n\nLuol Deng scored 18 and Kirk Hinrich had 15 for the Bulls, who led only once in the series opener.\n\nDetroit took control with a 13-2 run midway through the first quarter, but didn't put Chicago away until the opening minutes of the fourth.\n\nThree Pistons made 3-pointers in the first 2 minutes of the final quarter for a 19-point lead before going ahead 86-60 a few minutes later.\n\nCHICAGOÊ(69) - Deng 7-16 4-7 18, Brown 1-3 1-2 3, B.Wallace 4-5 1-3 9, Gordon 2-9 2-2 7, Hinrich 6-7 0-0 15, Duhon 1-7 2-2 5, Nocioni 1-8 0-0 2, Thomas 1-5 3-4 5, Sefolosha 0-3 5-8 5, Allen 0-7 0-0 0. Totals 23-70 18-28 69.\n\nDETROITÊ(95) - Prince 5-13 2-2 13, R.Wallace 4-10 2-2 13, Webber 1-3 3-4 5, Hamilton 8-18 3-3 20, Billups 7-14 3-4 20, McDyess 3-8 0-0 6, Hunter 0-3 0-0 0, Delfino 3-6 0-0 6, Maxiell 5-6 2-3 12, Murray 0-1 0-0 0, Davis 0-0 0-0 0. Totals 36-82 15-18 95."
