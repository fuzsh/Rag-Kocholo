When it was over, Kenseth stepped out of character a bit and celebrated by doing doughnuts by the finish line with his Ford. \"A million bucks, boys!\" he screamed to his crew over the two-way radio. \"You guys are the best!\" Kenseth beat Newman by about five car-lengths, with the Chevrolets of Tony Stewart, Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. rounding out the top five .\n\nNewman surprisingly eschewed a pit stop before the final 20-lap segment, and the rest of the leaders changed four tires. Even with that advantage, Kenseth decisive had a hard time making pass. He tried a couple of times to get below Newman, but couldn't complete the move. Finally, coming off Turn 4 with four to go, Newman's Dodge began to slide sideways, which was the only opening Kenseth needed.

The Tampa Bay captain is finally headed to the Stanley Cup finals in his 22nd NHL season, and the rest of the Lightning are making their first trip, too. \"Obviously you dream about this day and for it to happen, and you don't know how you're going to feel,\" the 40-year-old Andreychuk said Saturday night. \"I don't really feel relief. I feel excitement more than anything else.\" The Lightning beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals, sending Tampa Bay into the Cup finals against the Calgary Flames, who won the Western Conference title in six games over San Jose .\n\nGame 1 of the best-of-seven series is Tuesday night in Tampa. \"I feel excitement for what's happened to our club, the improvements we've made in the last three years, and everybody in that locker room should be pretty proud of the situation we're in,\" Andreychuk said. \"Our job is not done yet. We feel that this is another step. We have to be focused .\n\nObviously, we can enjoy this tonight, but then we've got to get back to work.\" Andreychuk has played more regular season games (1,597) than any other active player without appearing in the Cup finals. Two other teams he played on Toronto in 1993 and Colorado in 2000 lost Game 7 of the conference finals. \"It's great to finally see him get a chance at the Cup,\" said forward Fredrik Modin, who scored one of Tampa Bay's goals. \"But at the same time, we are all pretty excited for ourselves, too.\" Ruslan Fedotenko also scored for Tampa Bay, and Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 22 shots as the Lightning rebounded from a disappointing loss Game 6. The Flyers were denied their first trip to the finals since 1997, but didn't go down without a fight after rallying to tie Game 6 late in 1 AL regulation and winning it in overtime .\n\nKeith Primeau and Simon Gagne saved Philadelphia's season on Thursday, and goalie Robert Esche kept Game 7 from getting out of hand. \"Right now, I'm just disappointed for the players,\" Philadelphia coach Ken Hitchcock said. \"Back in January and February we weren't a very good hockey club against Tampa, and now we got to this stage.\" Fedotenko's deflection on the power play gave the Lightning a Mike Conroy The Associated Press Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal grabs a loose ball in front of Detroit's Ben Wallace in the second half of the Pacers' 78-74 victory in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday. Miller's 3-pointer leads Pacers to win in Game 1 Indiana opens Eastern Conference finals with 78-74 victory over Detroit By Chris Sheridan The Associated Press INDIANAPOLIS Reggie Miller did what Reggie Miller does. After missing his first six shots, Miller drilled a 3-pointer with 31.7 seconds left to break the game's final tie and lead Indiana past Detroit 78-74 Saturday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals .\n\n\"You knew it was coming,\" Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal said. \"He's going to make one big-time shot, and he thrives on the biggest shot.\" Miller's 13-year career has been marked by his clutch shooting, particularly in the playoffs and often from 3-point range. Fans of the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets have seen him make several devastating 3s, and now the folks in Detroit have experienced that same sickening Miller Time feeling. 1-0 lead late in the first period. Modin scored 4:57 into the second to make it 2-0 and whip a sellout crowd of 22,117 for Tampa Bay's first Game 7 into a frenzy .\n\nKim Johnson's goal trimmed Philadelphia's deficit to 2-1 midway through the second, and Esche stopped 17 shots in the period to keep the Flyers in the game. Neither team managed to win two straight in the series, just the 11th matchup in NHL history to go to Game 7 with the teams alternating victories in the first six. clock, we're in in in in in in in in in in the penalty and we airball a 3 we can't win that way,\" said Pistons coach Larry Brown, who feels his team has less offensive talent than an Indiana team, that presents unique matchup problems. Game Monday night. Miller helped the Pacers overcome a fourth-quarter offensive drought in which they were held scoreless for a stretch of nearly four minutes by Detroit's intense O'Neal led Indiana with 21 points and 14 .\n\nrebounds, Ron Artest scored 17, Al Harrington had 14 and Tinsley 13. Hamilton scored 23, Billups had 18 and Ben Wallace added 11 points and 22 rebounds for the Pistons, who got little (four points, five fouls, three turnovers) from Rasheed Wallace, whose only postgame comment was to guarantee a Game 2 victory. Indiana won despite shooting 33 percent, getting outrebounded 47-41 and being held to 30 secondhalf points 13 in the third quarter and 17 in the fourth. \"That's pretty much what I was expecting,\" O'Neal said. \"There weren't any surprises out there tonight.\" Lakers aim to put T'Wolves in 0-2 hole By Dave Campbell The Associated Press Tampa Bay's Darryl Sydor, left and Pavel Kubina celebrate their 2-1 Game 7 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday .\n\nChris O' Meara Associated Press \"When he shot it, I pretty much knew he was going to make it,\" said Detroit's Richard Hamilton, who was defending Miller on the play. \"The guy's been making those shots all his career.\" With the score tied at 74, Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal missed a difficult turnaround jumper from the left baseline. Jeff Foster tipped the rebound to a teammate, and the Pacers had another chance. Miller popped free off a screen set by Foster, took a pass from Jamaal Tinsley and buried his 3 to make it 77-74. \"All I need is to have a half-second of daylight,\" Miller said .\n\n\"Law of averages. You're either a hero or goat. It's a 50-50 shot, and I'll take my chances. I practice that shot every day.\" Hamilton missed a 3-pointer for Detroit and O'Neal was fouled on the rebound with 19.8 seconds left, but he missed both foul shots to give the Pistons another chance. Chauncey Billups and Rasheed Wallace both airballed 3-point attempts, and Miller made the second of two free throws with 6.6 seconds left to seal Indiana's 14th consecutive home victory .\n\n\"There's seven seconds on the MINNEAPOLIS Once again, the Minnesota Timberwolves have thrown away their homecourt advantage. It didn't cost them in the last round against Sacramento, but overcoming an early disadvantage against the Lakers looks like a much greater challenge. \"If we go down 0-2 to this team, it's going to be very difficult to fight back,\" Timberwolves guard Fred Hoiberg said after Friday's 97-88 loss to Los Angeles. The Wolves rallied against the Kings, losing the first game at Target Center before winning the next two including Game 3 at Sacramento to regain control of the series. The top-seeded Timberwolves then won at home in Games 5 and 7 to advance to the Western Conference finals .\n\nNow, the Timberwolves are preparing to host the Lakers in Game 2 tonight (6:30 p.m., TNT). \"Our history is we've been pretty good in Game 2s,\" coach Flip Saunders said Saturday. \"We've always made pretty good adjustments and had some success.\" To start, Minnesota must reduce those careless turnovers eight of 15 came in the second quarter. That won't be an easy task, either, with point guard Sam Cassell limited, at best, because of a bad back. Cassell was held out of practice Saturday, but plans on playing tonight .\n\nJourneyman Darrick Martin is the only other true point, and he didn't play Friday. That leaves Hoiberg, Latrell Sprewell and Kevin Garnett, the league MVP, to bring the ball up the floor when Cassell isn't out there. Of course, when Garnett is at the top of the key, he can't initiate the pick-and-roll or use his long arms to post up on the block. Finishing with a substandard 16 points and 10 rebounds in the first game while facing constant double and triple teams, Garnett was spread pretty thin, Did he feel that way? \"A little bit, but that's what I've got to do,\" Garnett said. \"Sam's not an option right now, so I have to find ways to get my teammates involved.\" PLAYOFF SCOREBOARD Wednesday saves) .\n\nTampa Bay, Khabibulin NHL San 12-4 (23-22).
