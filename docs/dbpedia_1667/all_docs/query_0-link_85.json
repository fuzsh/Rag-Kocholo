Who are their 25 best players?\n\nJun 16, 2016; Cleveland, OH, USA; A general view of a painting outside of Quicken Loans Arena prior to game six of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors. Mandatory Credit: Amber Searls-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers were one of three expansion franchises to join the NBA in 1970, part of a growth spurt during which the NBA nearly doubled from nine teams to 17 in a span of four years.\n\nNick Mileti was the original owner and “Cavaliers” beat out such entries as Jays, Foresters and Presidents in a name-the-team contest conducted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nPlaying their first four seasons in the intimate, 9,900-seat Cleveland Arena, the Cavaliers didn’t reach the playoffs until year six, two years into their stay at the Richfield Coliseum south of Cleveland.\n\nBut the franchise took a dire turn in 1979, after Mileti sold his shares to minority owner Joe Zingale, who in turn sold the team to Ted Stepien early in 1980.\n\nThe Stepien era was disastrous, so much so that the man has an NBA rule named after him. The Stepien Rule is the clause by which teams aren’t allowed to trade first-round picks in consecutive years.\n\nStepien threatened in 1982 to move the team to Toronto, but George and Gordon Gund stepped into the breach and purchased the team.\n\nThe NBA, as a sweetener to the deal, awarded the franchise extra first-round picks from 1983-86 to help more rapidly heal the damage done by Stepien’s wheeling and dealing.\n\nThe team made the postseason eight times in a nine year span from 1988-96, moving to the newly built Gund Arena (now known as Quicken Loans Arena) in downtown Cleveland in 1994.\n\nDan Gilbert purchased the Cavaliers in 2005 and remains the owner.\n\nIn 46 seasons, Cleveland has made only 20 playoff appearances.\n\nThe Cavs have made the postseason five straight seasons on two separate occasions (1992-96 and 2006-10). Their longest playoff drought was a seven-year stretch from 1999-2005.\n\nAnd for the long-suffering Cleveland fan base, the Cavaliers provided quite a tonic in June when they captured their first NBA title, becoming the first team to win the NBA Finals after trailing 3-1 and beating the Golden State Warriors in seven games.\n\nThe city had been bereft of a champion since the NFL’s Cleveland Browns won the league title in 1964. You have to go back to 1948 to find a World Series championship for MLB’s Cleveland Indians.\n\nCleveland has lost twice in the NBA Finals. In 2007, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs and in 2015, Cleveland lost to the Warriors in six games.\n\nThey have a winning percentage of .464 (1,728-1,996) in their history, ranking 22nd among the 30 active franchises.\n\nThe Cavs have two 60-win seasons, including a franchise-record 66 in 2008-09. Cleveland was 61-21 in 2009-10.\n\nConversely, the club has had 60 or more losses four times. They set a franchise record with 67 defeats in their inaugural campaign in 1970-71 and tied that mark in 1981-82. The Cavaliers lost 65 games in 2002-03 and 63 in 2010-11.\n\nThe Cavaliers have had 10 general managers in 45 seasons, with Wayne Embry the longest-tenured from June 1986 through June 1999. Bill Fitch doubled as coach and general manager from April 1973 through May 1979 and Jim Paxson was GM from June 1999 through April 2005.\n\nCurrent general manager David Griffin took over the club on an interim basis in February 2014 and has had the position on a permanent basis since May of that year.\n\nEmbry is the only Executive of the Year award winner in franchise history, receiving the honor in 1991-92 and 1997-98.\n\nThe team has employed 20 different coaches, with Lenny Wilkens (1986-93) the winningest coach in franchise history at 316-258 in the regular season and 18-23 in the playoffs.\n\nMike Brown served two stints (2005-10 and 2013-14) and was 305-187 with a 42-29 playoff record. The franchise’s first coach, Fitch, was 304-434 from 1970-79 and went 7-11 in the postseason and Mike Fratello (1993-99) went 248-212 and 2-12 in the playoffs.\n\nCurrent coach Tyronn Lue has been on the job less than a full season, leading the Cavaliers to a 27-14 record after David Blatt was fired in January. His postseason record is 16-5.\n\nFitch was the NBA Coach of the Year in 1975-76 and Brown took the honor in 2008-09.\n\nEven though they are a relatively young franchise, the Cavaliers have had the No. 1 overall pick six times—the most in league history.\n\nThose picks included Austin Carr of Notre Dame in 1971, North Carolina’s Brad Daugherty in 1986, LeBron James of Saint Vincent-Saint Mary High School in Akron, Ohio, in 2003, Duke’s Kyrie Irving in 2011, Anthony Bennett of UNLV in 2013 and Kansas’ Andrew Wiggins in 2014.\n\nCleveland has picked second once, third once and fourth twice, never selecting fifth.\n\nHere are the 25 best players in the history of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Players had to have appeared in 150 games and averaged a minimum of 20 minutes per game for the team to qualify for this list.\n\nNEW YORK – CIRCA 1978: AustinCarr #34 of the Cleveland Cavaliers dribbles the ball while defended by Earl Monroe #15 of the New York Knicks during an NBA basketball game circa 1978 at Madison Square Garden in the Manhattan borough of New York City.

Life after pro basketball has been tough at times for Ehlo, who has battled an addiction to painkillers that led to a run-in with the law.\n\nCLEVELAND, OH – CIRCA 1972: Sidney Wicks #21 of the Portland Trail Blazers drives on Jim Brewer #52 of the Cleveland Cavaliers during an NBA basketball game circa 1972 at the Cleveland Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.

He was taken second overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1973 NBA Draft and, despite putting together a solid career, was dogged by that lofty selection.\n\nBrewer spent two seasons as a reserve before taking over as the starting power forward in 1975-76, which also happened to be the season the Cavaliers reached the postseason for the first time.\n\nHe was an All-Defensive selection in 1975-76 and again in 1976-77 before returning to a reserve role.\n\nBrewer was traded in February 1979 along with the ubiquitous “future considerations” to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Earl Tatum.\n\nIn parts of six seasons with Cleveland, Brewer averaged 7.5 points and 7.7 rebounds in 27.1 minutes per game, shooting 44.1 percent from the floor and 59.5 percent at the foul line.\n\nIn September 1979, he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, where he spent one season.\n\nHe was swapped to the Los Angeles Lakers in October 1980, where he was part of their 1982 NBA title team, and played three seasons in Italy before retiring in 1985.\n\n19 Dec 1994: Forward Tyrone Hill of the Cleveland Cavaliers drives to the basket during a game against the Chicago Bulls at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois.

Cleveland got back Sherman Douglas from the Bucks and Shawn Kemp from the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nThe Cavs brought Hill back in an August 2001 trade along with Jumaine Jones from the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Traylor, Matt Harpring and Cedric Henderson.\n\nHill was waived in February 2003.\n\nIn parts of six seasons with Cleveland, Hill averaged 10.8 points and 9.2 rebounds in 29.8 minutes per game, shooting .521/0-for-5/.650.\n\nAs a senior at Xavier, Hill averaged 20.2 points and 12.6 rebounds per game.\n\nHe was the 11th overall pick by the Warriors in the 1990 NBA Draft.\n\nIn March 1999, Hill was traded to Philadelphia.\n\nIn March 2003, he returned to the 76ers as a free agent.\n\nHill signed with the Miami Heat in November 2003, retiring after he was waived less than a month later.\n\nUNITED STATES – NOVEMBER 01: Basketball: Cleveland Cavaliers Carlos Boozer (1) in action, making dunk vs Portland Trail Blazers Zach Randolph (50), Portland, OR 11/1/2003 (Photo by Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) (SetNumber: X69558 TK1)\n\nCarlos Boozer\n\nPF, 2002-04\n\nCarlos Boozer had earned All-America honors as a junior at Duke, averaging more than 18 points and nearly nine rebounds per game before opting to turn pro, but his draft stock plummeted because of concerns over his weight.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers finally took him off the board in the second round, 34th overall.\n\nThe weight thing never was an issue, as it turns out, and Boozer was an All-Rookie selection in 2002-03, when he was third in the NBA in field-goal percentage, and he was fifth in the league in rebounding in 2003-04.\n\nThe Cavaliers lost Boozer, however, in July 2004 when they declined to match an offer sheet extended to the restricted free agent by the Utah Jazz.\n\nIn two seasons with Cleveland, Boozer averaged 12.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in 29.8 minutes per game, shooting .528/1-for-7/.769.\n\nHe went on to become a two-time All-Star and an All-NBA pick in 2007-08 with the Jazz.\n\nBoozer agreed to a deal with the Chicago Bulls and moved there in a sign-and-trade in July 2010.\n\nWaived by the Bulls via the amnesty clause in July 2014, Boozer was claimed off waivers two days later by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe did not play in 2015-16 and reportedly has a deal to play this season in China.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, IN – CIRCA 1983: World B.
