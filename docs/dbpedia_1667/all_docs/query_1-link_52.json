        "text": "The Red Sox traded for former Cy Young-winning righthander Jake Peavy in a three-team, seven-player deal that was announced just before midnight Tuesday July 30.\n\nIn the deal, the Red Sox spun off Jose Iglesias to the Detroit Tigers along with three lower-level prospects. The Sox also obtained Triple A righthander Brayan Villarreal from Detroit.\n\nThe Sox sent righthanders J.B. Wendelken and Francelis Montas and infielder Cleuluis Rondon to the White Sox. Chicago also obtained outfielder Avisail Garcia from Detroit.\n\n“We’re really excited to bring Jake here. He’s obviously a proven major league starter. He’s had a ton of success in his career,’’ Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington said. “If there was one thing we could do, if we could pull it off, it’s add a starting pitcher.’’\n\nIn 45 starts since the beginning of 2012, Peavy has won 19 games and has a 3.61 ERA. But Peavy is not the same pitcher he was when he won the 2007 National League Cy Young. He had a 3.25 ERA from 2002-08 and it has jumped to 4.00 since. He also has had numerous physical issues since 2008.\n\nTyler Seguin\n\nOn Thursday, July 4, less than 24 hours before the NHL free agency period was set to begin, the Bruins set off some Independence Day fireworks of their own, shipping 21-year-old Tyler Segin, along with Rich Peverley and prospect Ryan Button, to the Dallas Stars in exchange for forward Loui Eriksson and three prospects.\n\nSeguin, taken with the No. 2 overall pick in 2010 that the Bruins acquired after trading star Phil Kessel to the Toronto Maple Leafs, was supposed to be the Bruins’ centerpiece of the future. He was just that in his first couple of seasons in the NHL, scoring 40 goals and tallying 49 assists for 89 points in his first two seasons, and helping the Bruins win the 2011 Stanley Cup when he was just a rookie.\n\nHe performed fairly well in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 campaign, with 32 points in 48 games, but essentially disappeared during the playoffs, recording only one goal and seven assists over 22 games in the Bruins’ Stanley Cup Finals loss to the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAfter Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli expressed concerns with Seguins’ off-ice maturity, saying that “he’s got to become more of a professional,’’ he decided that three years had been enough and it was time for the Bruins to move in another direction, getting a two-way player in Eriksson who looks to be a better fit in coach Claude Julien’s system. Seguin will now look to get his career back on track in Dallas, where it is reported he will be moved back to center, the position he grew up playing all the way through juniors after spending three seasons in Boston on the right wing.\n\nPaul Pierce\n\nAfter being the undisputed face of the franchise for a decade and a half, the Celtics finally said goodbye to team captain Paul Pierce, who has been playing basketball in Boston since he was drafted by the Celtics out of Kansas in 1998.\n\nOn June 27, the Celtics agreed to a trade in which they will send Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Terry to the Brooklyn Nets for Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Keith Bogans, and three first-round picks. The 35-year-old Pierce has been a fan favorite for in Boston for his entire Celtics career, and built himself up from a kid from Inglewood, Calif., into a future Hall of Fame player who was the 2008 NBA Finals MVP. His jersey number, 34, will undoubtedly be hanging from the TD Garden rafters some day.\n\nPierce, who was a 10 time All-Star with Boston, averaged 21.8 points per game over his 15 seasons with the Celtics, while grabbing six rebounds per game and averaging over 36 minutes per game, starting all but three of the 1,102 games he played with Boston. It seems a shock that Pierce will not get to retire wearing Celtics’ green, but no matter what, he will go down as one of the greatest players in Celtics history.\n\nKevin Garnett\n\nKevin Garnett, who has spent the past six seasons with the Celtics, will also head to Brooklyn to finish out his Hall of Fame career, joining Pierce and Jason Terry in a trade that netted the Celtics Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Keith Bogans, and three first-round picks.\n\nGarnett was drafted out of high school in 1995 by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and singlehandedly turned that franchise around, leading Minnesota to eight straight playoff appearances and a berth in the 2004 Western Conference Finals. The 2004 NBA MVP averaged more than 20 points per game in nine of the 12 seasons he spent in Minnesota and was regarded as the greatest player in franchise history.\n\nDespite all of his individual success, he had still never won an NBA title, let alone even appear in the Finals with the Timberwolves, and that changed in the summer of 2007, when he was traded to the Celtics for five players, cash considerations, and a 2009 first round pick. Garnett’s impact in Boston was immediate, winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in his first season with the Celtics, and, along with Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, led the Celtics to their first NBA title in 22 years. His presence helped the Celtics reach another NBA Finals two seasons later in 2010, and get to one game away from another appearance in 2012.\n\nGarnett has been named to 15 All-Star teams in his career, winning the 2003 All-Star Game MVP, and has been named to 12 All-Defensive teams.\n\nDoc Rivers\n\nDoc Rivers had been the head coach of the Celtics for nine seasons when it was announced on June 23 that the Celtics had agreed to release him from his current coaching contract to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, who gave the Celtics a first-round draft pick in return.\n\nRivers, who took over the Celtics job in 2004-05, is regarded as one of the most successful coaches in Celtics history, bringing the Celtics to the playoffs in all but two of his seasons as head coach, including winning the Eastern Conference Championship twice and the NBA Finals once.\n\nRivers coached the Orlando Magic for five seasons prior to being hired by the Celtics, winning the award for NBA Coach of the Year in 2000. He has coached two NBA All-Star games, in 2008 and 2011, and had a winning percentage of .577 in his nine years coaching Boston.\n\nHis 416 career regular season victories is third on the all-time Celtics coaching lists, behind just Red Auerbach and Tommy Heinsohn, and his 59 playoffs wins is also third in Celtics history, behind Auerbach and K.C. Jones.\n\nJaromir Jagr\n\nFollowing the 2013 trade deadline deal that fell apart for Jarome Iginla, the Bruins were able to acquire another future Hall of Famer, netting Jaromir Jagr from the Dallas Stars. Jagr, who starred for the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1990s, winning two Stanley Cups and cementing his status as one of the most prolific scorers of all time, came to Boston to provide a veteran presence and drive to bring this Bruins team to the next level.\n\nAfter several tries on different lines, Jagr finally found a home with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand on the second line, scoring two goals and seven assists in 11 regular season games with the Bruins. Jagr didn’t score any goals with the B’s in the playoffs, but recorded 10 assists and provided a lot of energy to that second line that helped Patrice Bergeron tie for second in playoff goals with nine, en route to setting the NHL record for most years between Stanley Cup Finals appearances (21).\n\nJagr left the team following the Bruins’ run to the Finals, but nevertheless left a lasting, if brief, legacy of his few months in Black and Gold.\n\nAqib Talib\n\nWith the Patriots’ secondary needing a boost halfway through the 2012 season, New England made a surprising move, acquiring cornerback Aqib Talib from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Nov. 1, 2012. Talib, a former first-round pick by Tampa Bay in 2008, was under suspension from the NFL at the time of the trade for violating the league’s policy on performance enhancing substances. His suspension was lifted on Nov. 12, and Talib saw his first game action on Nov. 18 against the Indianapolis Colts and recorded seven tackles and returned an interception 59 yards for a touchdown.\n\nTalib proved to be just what the Patriots were looking for in their secondary, making his presence felt by opposing receivers for the rest of the season, making 19 tackles in six regular season games. He recorded 10 tackles in the Patriots’ AFC Divisional game against the Houston Texans, but injured himself and was forced to leave the game. He came back to play against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship game, but re-aggravated the injury and was not a factor in the Patriots 28-13 loss.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent following the season, Talib re-signed with New England on a one-year contract for 2013, and will begin his first full season as a Patriot this September.\n\nJohn Farrell\n\nAfter the disaster that was the 2012 Boston Red Sox season, the team knew it needed to move in an entirely new direction. After firing manager Bobby Valentine, the Red Sox went back to a coach that they knew very well, and believed would be the perfect man for the job: John Farrell.\n\nFarrell, who served as the Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007-2010, took an opportunity to be the head coach of the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, where he served for two seasons. In his two seasons with the Blue Jays, Farrell led the team to records on 81-81 and 73-89, respectively. In 2011, he was named as a coach of the American League All-Star team by Ron Washington.\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that the Red Sox and Blue Jays had reached a deal to let John Farrell be hired by the Red Sox in exchange for shortstop Mike Aviles.\n\nIn the first half of his first season as Red Sox manager, Farrell had the team back on track from the start, and the Red Sox went 48-33 in their first 81 games, a winning percentage of .592, and the best record in the American League.\n\nFarrell also managed to create a winning culture despite not having the big-money stars like the Yankees, Angels, and others.\n\nAdrian Gonzalez, Carl Crawford, Josh Beckett\n\nIn the offseason before the 2011 season, the Red Sox went out and made perhaps the biggest combined splash of the winter: signing Carl Crawford to a seven-year, $142 million contract and trading for Adrian Gonzalez, who they then signed to a seven-year, $154 million extension. Crawford never really took off in Boston, but Gonzalez was an instant star, leading the team to the best offensive numbers in the American League for most of 2011 and was regarded as a strong candidate for AL MVP.\n\nBut after the September collapse, in which the Red Sox blew an 8.5 game lead in the wild card standings to miss the playoffs, the team plummeted in 2012 under new manager Bobby Valentine.\n\nJosh Beckett, who was the 2007 ALCS MVP and Boston’s ace of the pitching staff for half of a decade, began to fall out of favor with fans and management alike due to his poor performances and reported lack of professionalism for the team and his job.\n\nSo on August 26, 2012, the Red Sox decided to make the most expensive total trade in history, sending Gonzalez, Crawford, and Beckett, along with infielder Nick Punto, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for James Loney, Allen Webster, Ivan De Jesus, Rubby De La Rosa, and Jerry Sands.\n\nThe trade, which exchanged over a quarter of a billion dollars in salary, will save the Red Sox more than $250 million in salary through 2018. Though seen at the time as the Red Sox giving up on the 2012 season, it ultimately ended up paying off, as Boston, free from high salary constraints, was able to sign key 2013 players such as Shane Victorino, Mike Napoli, and Jonny Gomes, who have the Red Sox at first place in the American League halfway through the 2013 season.\n\nKevin Youkilis\n\nAfter the Red Sox terrible start to the 2012 season, in which then-manager Bobby Valentine remarked that the team had “hit rock bottom,’’ Boston attempted to salvage their season by trading away third baseman Kevin Youkilis. Arguably one of the most popular Red Sox in the past decade, Youkilis had never gotten along with Valentine, and after the emergence of Will Middlebrooks at third base, the Sox decided that Youkilis was expendable, and, on June 24, traded him to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility player Brent Lillibridge.\n\nYoukilis was a star for eight and a half seasons in Boston, finishing third in 2008 AL MVP voting, and played in three All-Star games, won a Gold Glove as a first baseman, and helped the Red Sox to two World Series championships. After finishing out the season with the White Sox, Youkilis signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees for 2013, with the plan to be the Yankees’ regular third baseman while Alex Rodriguez was on the extended DL.\n\nChad Ochocino\n\nThis deal, the subject of speculation for some time, became reality July 28, 2011, when the Patriots followed their stunning trade for defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth by acquiring Ochocinco from the Cincinnati Bengals for late round draft picks in both 2012 and 2013.\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick had said before that he has a great deal of respect for the Ochocinco, who returned the verbal favor. The former Chad Johnson, 33, had 67 catches for 831 yards and four touchdowns for the woeful Bengals in 2010. He has 766 career regular-season receptions for 11,059 yards and 67 touchdowns.\n\nThe former star receiver never panned out in New England, lasting just one forgettable season in 2011.\n\nAlbert Haynesworth\n\nThe giant defensive lineman – he was listed at 6-foot-6, 330 pounds – was once among the most dominant defensive linemen in the NFL and he was chosen for the Pro Bowl twice. But he’ll always be remembered for stomping Cowboys center Andre Gurode’s head while he was with the Titans, as well as his multiple failed conditioning tests and ensuing spat with Redskins coach Mike Shanahan that led to his suspension for the final month of last season.\n\nThe trade cost the Patriots only a fifth-round draft pick. He only played six games for the Patriots in 2011, recording just two tackles and no sacks, before New England cut its losses and released Haynesworth, who would then be signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nKendrick Perkins\n\nThe shock value of some trades lies in the player or players who arrive. In other cases, it’s who is departing, and that was definitely the case with Kendrick Perkins, a fan favorite who came back from a knee injury ahead of schedule in 2011 and was considered one of the key pieces as the Celtics made a run at another NBA championship.\n\nBut team president Danny Ainge decided the need for a forward was greater, and dealt Perkins and guard Nate Robinson to the Oklahoma City Thunder for forward Jeff Green and center Nenad Krstic in stunning moves at the trading deadline in February of 2011.\n\nTomas Kaberle\n\nThe Bruins made some key upgrades prior to the NHL trading deadline in February of 2011, but the top move was trading with the Toronto Maple Leafs for veteran defenseman Tomas Kaberle in exchange for forward Joe Colborne, whom they chose in the first round of the 2008 draft, and a conditional draft pick. They also traded for center Chris Kelly, center Rich Peverley and defenseman Boris Valabik to clear the cap space needed for Kaberle.\n\nAdrian Gonzalez\n\nEnding one of the longest pursuits of a player in modern Red Sox history, power-hitting first baseman Adrian Gonzalez was introduced by the team at a Fenway Park ceremony in December of 2010. The Red Sox sent three prospects – pitcher Casey Kelly, outfielder Raymond Fuentes and first baseman Anthony Rizzo – to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Gonzalez, who had been coveted by the Red Sox and their fans for several years.\n\nRandy Moss\n\nThere was stunning news the morning of Oct. 6, 2010: The Patriots had traded star wide receiver Randy Moss to the Vikings for a third-round draft pick. The move was foreshadowed by a postgame rant after the season opener in which Moss expressed his displeasure over the Patriots’ refusal to negotiate a contract extension. Then, just two days before the trade, Moss had no receptions in a Monday night victory over the Dolphins, the first time Moss had gone without a catch since 2006. His stay in Minnesota was short-lived. After the Vikings lost to the Patriots on Halloween, Moss delivered another postgame gem, this time expressing his love for the Patriots and regret for leaving.\n\nJarrod Saltalamacchia\n\nAt the time the Red Sox pulled the trigger on a 2010 deadline-day deal with the Rangers for the catcher in exchange for prospects, it was seen as little more than an afterthought. But following the departure of Victor Martinez after the season, Saltalamacchia found himself thrust into the starting role by the time spring training rolled around in February of 2011.\n\nRichard Seymour\n\nIn a move that sent shockwaves across the NFL, the Patriots traded five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Richard Seymour on Sept. 22, 2009 to the Oakland Raiders Sunday in exchange for a 2011 first-round draft choice. Seymour was part of all three Patriots teams that won Super Bowls.\n\nPhil Kessel\n\nThe Bruins shipped the winger to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sept. 18, 2009 for a first- and second-round draft pick in 2010 and a first-round pick in 2011. Kessel, whom the Bruins drafted in 2006 with the fifth overall pick, and coach Claude Julien clashed over playing style and the trade had been in the works about three months prior, but fell apart over a miscommunication about the pieces involved.\n\nVictor Martinez\n\nOn July 31, 2009, the Red Sox acquired switch-hitting Indians All-Star catcher Victor Martinez at the trade deadline for pitcher Justin Masterson and two prospects. The Sox also shipped Adam LaRoche to Atlanta for first baseman Casey Kotchman in a separate deal. Martinez shined for the Red Sox in 2010, but signed a four-year deal with the Detroit Tigers in November of 2010.\n\nMatt Cassel, Mike Vrabel\n\nCassel played quite capably throughout 2008, the season Tom Brady missed because of a knee injury, and led the Patriots to an 11-5 record, but the team missed the playoffs. Two months after the season ended, Cassel was traded to the Chiefs — run by ex-Patriots personnel boss Scott Pioli — on Feb. 27, 2009 along with Mike Vrabel for a second-round draft pick. Vrabel was the more shocking aspect of the trade. The versatile linebacker — he was sometimes used in a receiving role — was a fan favorite who won three Super Bowls with the Patriots and was named to the Pro Bowl in 2007.\n\nManny Ramirez\n\nOn July 31, 2008, controversial Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-team trade right at the trading deadline. In the deal, Ramirez was shipped to LA, and left fielder Jason Bay was shipped from Pittsburgh to Boston. The Pirates received third baseman Andy LaRoche, brother of Red Sox first baseman Adam LaRoche, and pitcher Bryan Morris from the Dodgers, and righthander Craig Hansen and outfielder Brandon Moss from the Red Sox.\n\nKevin Garnett\n\nThe blockbuster deal to bring the forward from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Celtics completed the “Big Three” that would deliver Boston its 17th NBA title. The Celtics sent five players — Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Sebastain Telfair and Theo Ratliff — as well as two draft picks to Minnesota on July 31, 2007.\n\nRay Allen\n\nThe guard was the first acquisition the Celtics made to form the “Big Three.” On June 28, 2007 — the night of the NBA Draft — the Celtics sent Delonte West, Wally Sczerbiak and the rights to their first-round draft pick, Jeff Green, to the Seattle SuperSonics in order to team Allen up with Paul Pierce, and later Kevin Garnett.\n\nRandy Moss\n\nOn April 29, 2007, the second day of the NFL draft, the Patriots acquired Randy Moss from the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a fourth-round selection in the 2007 draft, giving Tom Brady a true deep threat that would lead to a record-setting season in 2007. Brady set the single-season touchdown pass mark (50), and Moss set a record for touchdown receptions in a season (23).\n\nWes Welker\n\nOn March 5, 2007, the Patriots obtained receiver Wes Welker from the Miami Dolphins for a second- and a seventh-round pick in the 2007 draft. Welker became a favorite target of quaretrback Tom Brady, and was a fan favorite in Foxborough as well.\n\nWelker had five 1,000-yard receiving seasons for the Patriots and was named to the Pro Bowl five times. He left after the 2012 season to sign with the Denver Broncos as a free agent.\n\nJoe Thornton\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2005, just a few months after the center signed a three-year, $20 million contract, he was shipped to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Marco Sturm, Wayne Primeau and Brad Stuart. Thornton, the No. 1 pick in the 1997 NHL Draft spent parts of eight seasons with the Bruins.\n\nJosh Beckett, Mike Lowell\n\nOn Nov. 24, 2005, during general manager Theo Epstein’s brief leave of absence from the Red Sox, the team picked up two players who played key roles in Boston’s 2007 World Series championship. Beckett, a righthanded pitcher, and Lowell, a Gold Glove third baseman, were acquired along with reliever Guillermo Mota, but at a steep price. Boston’s top prospect, shortstop Hanley Ramirez, was the key to the deal with the Florida Marlins. Pitchers Anibal Sanchez, Harvey Garcia and Jesus Delgado were also sent to Florida. Beckett was the MVP of the 2007 ALCS and Lowell was the MVP of the 2007 World Series.\n\nCorey Dillon\n\nThe Patriots traded a second-round pick in the 2004 draft to acquire the running back from the Cincinnati Bengals on April 19, 2004. Dillon spent the final three seasons of his career in New England and won a Super Bowl ring in 2004 following a 1,635-yard season.\n\nNomar Garciaparra\n\nTrading shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Cubs at the July 31 deadline in 2004 was a defining moment for Red Sox GM Theo Epstein, and there can be no questioning it helped Boston win its first World Series in 86 years. He dealt the team’s marquee player “in one of the most momentous transactions in the modern annals of the 103-year-old franchise,” wrote the Globe’s Bob Hohler at the time. After making the deal, Epstein said: ”It was with mixed emotions that we let Nomar go. He’s been one of the greatest Red Sox of all time.” The Red Sox received shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins in a multi-team deal.\n\nCurt Schilling\n\nLess than a month after spending Thanksgiving dinner with the Schillings in 2003 and trying to convince Curt to accept a deal to Boston, Epstein made his biggest deal to that point: Acquiring Schilling from Arizona in exchange for Casey Fossum, Brandon Lyon, and two minor leaguers. Schilling won 21 games for the Red Sox in 2004 and had legendary performances against the Yankees and Cardinals in the postseason.\n\nAntoine Walker\n\nOn Oct. 20, 2003, the Celtics traded the forward, along with guard Tony Delk, to the Dallas Mavericks for forwards Raef LaFrentz and Chris Mills, guard Jiri Welsch and a 2004 first-round draft pick (which was used to draft Delonte West). Walker had been drafted sixth overall by the Celtics in the 1996 draft.\n\nDrew Bledsoe\n\nThe notion of ever seeing Drew Bledsoe in another uniform seemed distant in the mid-90s when the quarterback was leading the Patriots to new heights, including a Super Bowl appearance in 1997. But the emergence of Tom Brady when Bledsoe went down in 2001 to a serious injury ultimately made Bledsoe expendable, and he was traded to the Buffalo Bills on draft day in 2002 for a first-round pick in 2003.\n\nRay Bourque\n\nThe defenseman spent 20 seasons with the Bruins, but asked for and received a trade in 2000 that gave him his one and only Stanley Cup victory. Bourque was sent to the Colorado Avalanche along with Dave Andreychuk in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier and Samuel Pahlsson. He scored four goals and had six assists for the Avalanche during their 2001 playoff run that ended with a victory over the Devils in the Cup finals."
