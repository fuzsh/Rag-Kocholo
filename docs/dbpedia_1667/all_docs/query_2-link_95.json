        "text": "“In between games, I didn’t sleep much. I lost weight. The stress level was high. There was no pleasure.”\n\nThose are Rick Fox’s memories from the breathtaking 2002 Western Conference finals against the Sacramento Kings. The series concluded with Fox’s Lakers grinding out a Game 7 overtime victory, in enemy territory, despite the best efforts of the league’s loudest fans. The crestfallen Kings would never come closer to an NBA title, splintering before becoming a league laughingstock. Meanwhile, the Lakers easily dispatched New Jersey in the Finals, never guessing it would be their last title before Kobe Bryant’s deteriorating relationship with Shaquille O’Neal forced Shaq’s trade to Miami. What separated the Kings and Lakers in their epic 2002 series? A miraculous shot, missed free throws, a few unseemly whistles, and two wide-open misses. That’s it.\n\nThis series had everything: a blossoming rivalry between the league’s marquee franchise and the aesthetically pleasing, swift-passing, oft-cutting Kings; verbal grenades lobbed back and forth; allegations of tainted food and officiating conspiracies; the burnishing of Big Shot Rob’s reputation; and even the involvement of a onetime dark horse presidential candidate. These were the two best teams in basketball, so nobody was surprised when the last four games of the series were decided in the final minute. Legacies were sealed; legacies were lost. With Miami gunning for its own three-peat in 2014, we forget sometimes how difficult it is to win three straight titles. The 2002 Lakers were the last team to pull it off. And nobody traded haymakers with them like the Kings.\n\nThe Kings haven’t won a title since 1951, back when they were playing in Rochester as the Royals. Since then, they’ve moved from their original home to Cincinnati to Kansas City to Sacramento — and last year, nearly to Seattle. All those stops have one thing in common: Across 63 years, no Kings team has played in the NBA Finals. In the 1960s, Oscar Robertson’s Royals kept running into Russell’s Celtics and Wilt’s Sixers. In 1981, an underdog Kings team got steamrolled by Moses Malone. And from 2000 through 2002, the Kings drew the short straw historically, peaking right as Shaq and Kobe were turning the NBA into their own personal buddy cop movie. That they played for Los Angeles only made it worse.\n\n“It was the big city of California against what was perceived to be this sleepy, little capital town of California,” said Scott Howard-Cooper, who covered the NBA for the Sacramento Bee during the series. “North versus South. Established versus wannabe. There were so many things that drew them together.”\n\nThey ended up bringing the best out of each other. Neither team would ever be quite the same. The following is an oral history featuring many participants in and witnesses to that series. Everyone quoted is listed with his or her job title at the time of the series, in the summer of 2002.\n\nI. The Roads to Battle\n\nII. The Trilogy Takes ShapeGame 1, May 18, 2002\n\nIII.
