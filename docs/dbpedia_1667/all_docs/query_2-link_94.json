To me, this was a no-brainer pick even though Conley has never been an all-star, never been on an All-NBA, and the only accolade he’s ever won was All-Defense 2nd Team (and garnering a 5th place MVP vote in 2013-14). I know that calling Conley underrated has become a platitude, but dammit, it’s true! You can count on one hand the number of players who are tougher than Conley, and the best display of this is when he broke his face during the 2015 playoffs, had the multiple breaks surgically repaired, and missed ONLY ONE GAME! Please read the article that I just linked for a gory account. Just in case you don’t, here are a couple of snippets:\n\n“That night, I was throwing up,” Conley said. “And every time I threw up—because when you do it, you can’t really control this—I’d have to open my mouth. It would just kill me because I couldn’t really open my mouth. Then, all of a sudden, blood would come out of my nose and I was like: I think I’m dying. It was crazy.”\n\n“After I got the CAT scan, they told me I did have a blowout fracture,” Conley said. “I had three fractures at that point: one under my eye, one on the side of my eyebrow, and then there was one that was a displaced fracture almost where my jaw is.” Doctors also told Conley that he had very nearly broken his jaw and likely had a broken nose.\n\n-Rob Mahoney, 2015\n\nAlso, that game for which he returned was game 2 against the eventual champion Warriors. Conley led the Grizzlies to a victory after shooting 8/12 from the field….\n\nSo what? Plenty of players are tough, and if that’s my only criteria, then why not sign Metta World Peace (Ron Artest at the time) who had the courage to consider fighting all of Detroit? Jonathan Abrams of (RIP) Grantland outlines how Conley developed into the intellectual, gritty leader that he is today. Furthermore, the dude has never received a technical foul. I like that intangible combination of quiet but tough leadership. He and Ray will ground the calm personality of our team.\n\nConley is also a rare point guard who is dominant on both ends of the floor. He specifically specialized in defense earlier in his career, and he showed that in the 2012-13 season when The Grizzlies played their worst defense when he was off the floor (even worse than when Gasol would sit).\n\nAfter years of toiling in the Western playoffs, Coach Fizdale stepped in and provided Conley with new offensive confidence, helping Conley reach new heights as an offensive player. According to NBAWOWY, The Grizzlies played significantly better when Conley was on the court versus when he shared the court with Gasol or when Gasol was on the court without Conley:\n\nGrizzlies: 2016-17 Regular Season\n\nPoints/100 Poss Points Allowed/100 Poss Net Rating Conley (no Gasol) 113.7 105.6 8.1 Gasol (no Conley) 106.5 105.7 0.8 Conley + Gasol 112.1 109.7 2.4 No Conley or Gasol 100.1 110 -9.9\n\nFor comparison, an 8.1 Net Rating would’ve ranked second-best in the league behind the Warriors’ staggering 12.1 and above the Spurs’ 7.9.\n\nTo me, Conley’s appeal lies in his ability to both run an offense and play off-the-ball. Players like John Wall and Rajon Rondo are excellent “Dime Droppers,” but without the ball, their best skill is rendered useless. Conley can step away to provide some necessary spacing and allow for the offense to move more fluidly. Just like how I talked about Curry’s ability as a “Cog,” remember that Conley was second in the league in secondary assists (behind Curry).\n\nStepping away from these advanced metrics for a moment, the game that solidified Conley’s place on this team occurred this year against the 61-win Spurs and their ridiculous two-way superstar Kawhi (against whom the Grizzlies won two games). Conley’s game 4 performance was spectacular as he went toe-to-toe with Leonard before leading the Grizzlies to a two-point victory:\n\nStarters MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS +/- Kawhi Leonard 44:10:00 14 30 0.467 7 10 0.7 8 8 1 1 7 8 3 6 0 4 4 43 +18 Mike Conley 41:52:00 13 23 0.565 4 8 0.5 5 7 0.714 0 9 9 8 1 0 3 3 35 +9\n\nOn a theoretical level, Conley’s skillset breakdown looks as follows:\n\nMike Conley 2017 – Playmaking (Elite– 8); Scoring (Elite– 7); Defense (Elite– 7); Rebounding (Average– 4)\n\nWe now have one Elite “Floor Spacer” and one Transcendent “Floor Spacer” along with two offensive talents who are able to put aside their egos for the betterment of the offense. What we’re lacking at this point is “Transcendent” defensive players, so let’s move in that direction for the next couple of players.\n\nDraymond Green 2015-16\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – All-Defense 1st Team, 7th in MVP voting, All-Star, 8th in total rebounds, 7th in total assists, 6th in DWS, 10th in WS, 9th in BPM, 4th in DBPM, and 9th in VORP.\n\nPlayoffs – 1st in total minutes, 1st in total rebounds, 1st in defensive rebounds, 3rd in assists, 3rd in steals, 1st in blocks, 5th in OWS, 1st in DWS, 3rd in WS, 7th in BPM, 5th in DBPM, and 3rd in VORP.\n\nRegular season/ Playoff Stats\n\nSeason Age Tm Lg Pos G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% 2P 2PA 2P% eFG% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2015-16 25 GSW NBA PF 81 81 34.7 5 10.1 0.49 1.2 3.2 0.388 3.7 6.9 0.537 0.551 2.8 4.1 0.696 1.7 7.8 9.5 7.4 1.5 1.4 3.2 3 14 2015-16 25 GSW NBA PF 23 23 38.2 5.2 12 0.431 1.7 4.5 0.365 3.5 7.5 0.471 0.5 3.4 4.7 0.738 1.7 8.3 9.9 6 1.6 1.8 2.4 3.5 15.4\n\nLook, I know that usually my posts are filled with some statistical jargon that alienates some of the NBA fanbase. I know that sometimes my actual writing is lost within a series of hyperlinks, graphs, and acronyms that take the soul out of writing. Sometimes though, it’s completely necessary to whip out some numbers that are just mind-boggling.\n\nFor example, during the 2015-16 season, the same season that Curry went absolutely nuclear with possibly the greatest offensive season we’ve ever seen, the Warriors captured the most wins in regular season history before losing to the Cavaliers in a 7-game Finals series. By playing around with NBAWOWY’s On/Off numbers, we can see which lineups were must effective during a specific timeframe. The following are the Warriors Offensive Rating (Points/100 Possessions) and Defensive Rating (Points Allowed/100 Possessions) depending on Curry’s and Green’s on-court presence.\n\nWarriors: 2015-16 Regular Season\n\nPoints/100 Poss Points Allowed/100 Poss Net Rating Green (no Curry) 110.4 102.1 8.3 Curry (no Green) 112.9 110.6 2.3 Green + Curry 120.2 100.7 19.5 No Green or Curry 102.1 112.8 -10.7\n\nIs this officially the perfect statistic for comparing teammates? No statistic is perfect, but boy does it tell an interesting story. Not only did the Warriors’ offense thrive with Green leading without Curry, their defense was absolutely stifling. Even more interesting though is how well these two meshed to garner the Warriors a 19.5 net rating. Even even more more interesting is their numbers during the Finals:\n\nWarriors: 2015-16 Finals\n\nPoints/100 Poss\n\nPoints Allowed/100 Poss Net Rating Green (no Curry) 117 94.7 22.3 Curry (no Green) 108 111.5 -3.5 Green + Curry 110.1 111.2 -1.1 No Green or Curry 97.4 119.7 -22.3\n\nBefore we leap to any conclusions, this is over the course of seven games which yields a significantly smaller sample size rendering the numbers more volatile; however, it tells me that even after winning a championship, Green brought his absolute A-game to defend their honor (not that Curry didn’t. The Cavs just matched up very well with him last year).\n\nI chose to start with those numbers because, well, to be honest, Draymond’s game isn’t particularly sexy. He doesn’t score in bunches or in flashy ways. He doesn’t catch fire from three, and he doesn’t (often) chase players down on the break. He doesn’t whip no-look passes, and he doesn’t posterize players. Draymond is simply one of (if not the) greatest offensive/defensive engine in history.\n\nBy engine, I mean a couple of things. First, his defensive versatility allows him to literally guard all five positions (check out my earlier post where I claim that five Draymonds would be the best defensive lineup possible) and defend the rim at an elite level. With the NBA’s defenses becoming all the more complicated with threes and picks flying everyone, it’s more important than ever to have a player that can step out and contest a shooter (without being beat off the dribble).\n\nSecondly, his passing ability is tremendous for a forward. Mike Brady of the pro-Warrior “Golden State of Mind” blog where he claims that Draymond is the actual MVP of the Warriors states the following:\n\nLast season Draymond Green and LeBron James were the only two front court players in the top 10 for Points created by assists (per game)The only other front court players inside the top thirty were Nicolas Batum (20th), Blake Griffin (29th) and Kevin Durant (30th).\n\nThis season Draymond Green is currently ranked 8th in that same category and is also 8th in secondary assists (the pass to the player who makes the assist), while also sitting sixth in assist to turnover ratio.\n\n-Mike Brady, 2016\n\nGranted, his anger and propensity to kick genitalia possibly cost the Warriors the Finals series, but with this uniquely modern skillset, I can’t afford to not have Draymond on our team. He brings so much to the table, and looking back to Morris’ defense of Rodman, Green might just be in the top-5 “third best” players in history.\n\nBefore closing, let’s look at his theoretical skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding\n\nDraymond 8 4 10 6\n\nDraymond is the ultimate “Cog” and “Chameleon.”\n\nAs a closing thought, Draymond had an all-time great Finals game-7 performance that was overshadowed by the King. He scored 32 points on 11-15 shooting (6-8 from 3), grabbed 15 rebounds, and dished 9 assists. I respect any two-way role-player with that kind of grit in the biggest game of the season.\n\nStats from basketball reference, stats.nba, and NBAWOWY.\n\nArticle Length: about 1,400 words.\n\nRemember when I wrote that long series about the best team I could assemble of players post-2000? If not, go ahead and catch yourself up with part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, and part 5. If you’re not going to read those lengthy, hypothetical choices, let me quickly explain what’s going on here.\n\nFor “The Universe Cup” series, the premise is that Earth has been selected to join an 82-game intergalactic season by submitting a 12-man roster. We have no idea how these aliens (multi-dimensional athletic beings…whatever works for you) will play, but we’ll assume that they have an anthropomorphic build so as to not change the integrity of basketball. Oh, and if we don’t win the championship, Earth is destroyed, so the fate of the world hinges on our team’s success in the season and post-season that is structured just like the NBA.\n\nI was never 100% pleased with my previous series, and after some reflection, I realized it’s because I sacrificed building a cohesive team to award different players lifetime achievement awards. Instead of reworking that series with the same set of rules, I decided to try again with much more stringent regulations. Here are the rules for The Second-Tier Universe Cup.\n\nPlayers must be selected starting after the 1999-2000 season (so any season starting with 2000-01).\n\nOnly 12 players can be chosen.\n\nPlayers must be chosen along with a specific year (so I wouldn’t be able to say “LeBron James in his prime.” I’d have to choose something like 2009 LeBron, 2013 LeBron, or 2017 LeBron (the year indicates the year in which the Finals took place, so 2009 means 2008-2009). The year will encompass both the player’s regular season and post-season.\n\nInjuries play a factor, but this can be flexible depending on how you defend your choices (this will be more clear as I continue).\n\nPlayer selections are limited by the following restrictions (THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING). A player is ineligible if he has won any of the following awards at any point in his career:\n\nFinals MVP\n\nMVP\n\nFirst Team All-NBA\n\nA coach must be selected.\n\nRule #5 renders the following twenty-nine players ineligible: Shaq, Duncan, Webber, Iverson, Kidd, McGrady, Kobe, Garnett, Nowitzki, Nash, LeBron, Amar’e, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Wade, Durant, Rose, Harden, Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Curry, Leonard, DeAndre Jordan, Westbrook, Billups, Tony Parker, Pierce, and Iguodala. (For anyone keeping track, this disqualifies every single member of the Universe Cup Team….except one…)\n\nWith these rules and the theoretical underpinnings I laid out in this, this, and this, article, it’s time to start choosing which players will make my team. Trust me, this is an extremely difficult question, and I’m only 80% confident in all twelve of my selections. Let’s get started\n\nThe Second-Tier Universe Roster\n\nAs the curator of this team, it would be irresponsible for me to just jump in and start selecting the classically “best” remaining players. If you recall from the NBA archetypes, I need to choose players whose skillsets mitigate diminishing returns which turn out to be “Cogs” (players who effectively and unselfishly move the ball) and “Chameleons” (players who can easily switch and defend multiple positions). Along with these, I need at least a couple “Elite” scorers, but I have to make sure that they’re not all ball dominant! I also need to make sure that I have an abundance of “Floor Spacers” (players who efficiently shoot open, spot-up threes) to open up the floor for post play and driving. Also, those “Floor Spacers” should be able to defend somewhat (think Warriors over Cavs). Finally, rebounding never hurt anyone.\n\nBeyond all of these skillsets though, I need some intangibles that cannot be quantified by statistics. Sure, youthful NBA players toss up the best statistics, but veterans who have played in many playoffs and (hopefully) won a championship or two are the strongest willed. Let’s start with the players who I immediately chose for the team with no hesitation (not necessarily the starters…I’ll get into that later).\n\nRay Allen 2000-2001\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season: 2nd in total three-pointers made; 1st in Offensive Win Shares (OWS); 2nd in Effective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%) and True Shooting Percentage (TS%); 3rd in Win Shares (WS); 5th in Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)\n\nPlayoffs: 1st in total three-pointers made, 1st in Offensive Win Shares, 4th in Win Shares, 2nd in Offensive Box Plus/Minus (OBPM), 2nd in Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)\n\nRegular Season/ Playoffs Stats\n\nSeason Age G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% 2P 2PA 2P% eFG% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2000-01 25 82 82 38.2 7.7 16 0.48 2.5 5.7 0.433 5.2 10.3 0.506 0.557 4.2 4.8 0.888 1.2 4 5.2 4.6 1.5 0.2 2.5 2.3 22 Season Age G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% 2P 2PA 2P% eFG% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2000-01 25 18 18 42.7 8.8 18.4 0.477 3.2 6.6 0.479 5.6 11.8 0.476 0.563 4.4 4.8 .919 1.1 3.1 4.1 6 1.3 0.6 2.4 2.4 25.1\n\nRegular Season/ Playoffs Advanced Stats\n\nSeason Age G MP PER TS% 3PAr FTr ORB% DRB% TRB% AST% STL% BLK% TOV% USG% OWS DWS WS WS/48 OBPM DBPM BPM VORP 2000-01 25 82 3129 22.9 0.61 0.357 0.299 3.7 11.8 7.8 20.4 2.1 0.5 12.1 24.4 11.5 2.2 13.7 0.211 6.5 -0.9 5.6 6 2000-01 25 18 768 23.7 0.613 0.36 0.26 2.8 7.4 5.2 27.1 1.7 0.9 10.4 24.9 3.2 0.4 3.6 0.223 7.5 -0.5 7 1.7\n\nIs this my Bucks homerism showing? Nah, Ray Allen also made my Universe Cup TeamTeam, and was the only member to avoid the restrictions of joining this team. People forget how truly great Ray Allen was. His greatest moments in occurred later in his career such as shooting 8/8 from three in the 4th quarter and overtime to beat the Suns in 2006, Scoring 51 points against the Bulls in the 2009 playoffs, and hitting the biggest shot in NBA history against the Spurs in 2013.\n\nAllen’s 2000-01 season was his all-around best season though where he seamlessly switched between primary ball-handling and off-ball duties. Playing next to notorious chuckers Sam Cassell and Glen “Big Dog” Robinson, Allen still managed to score 20+ points on absurd efficiency. He completely stepped up his game during the playoffs, and out-dueled Iverson in the Conference Finals whose Sixers may have received some help from the refs.\n\nConference Finals Stats\n\nRk Player Age G GS MP FG FGA 3P 3PA FT FTA ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS FG% 3P% FT% MP PTS TRB AST STL BLK 1 Allen Iverson 25 6 6 274 64 186 12 36 43 55 5 24 29 41 13 2 19 15 183 0.344 0.333 0.782 45.7 30.5 4.8 6.8 2.2 0.3 1 Ray Allen 25 7 7 293 66 141 28 55 30 31 6 17 23 38 6 4 15 20 190 0.468 0.509 0.968 41.9 27.1 3.3 5.4 0.9 0.6\n\nConference Finals Advanced Stats\n\nRk Player Age G GS MP TS% eFG% ORB% DRB% TRB% AST% STL% BLK% TOV% USG% ORtg DRtg GmSc 1 Allen Iverson 25 6 6 274 0.435 0.376 1.9 10.6 5.8 31.3 2.7 0.6 8.3 38.1 97 108 17.1 1 Ray Allen 25 7 7 293 0.614 0.567 2.4 6.2 4.4 27.5 1.1 1 8.8 28.7 123 111 19.9\n\nOkay, efficiency aside, this was a pretty close contest. But you never thought that Ray was anywhere near Iverson’s level did you? If you go back and watch games from that series, you’ll see that Ray actually guards Iverson most of the time because Cassell was such a sieve on defense. While Ray’s defense wasn’t anything to write home about, he was at least serviceable before his knees starting shutting down on him. There’s a reason that he was the best offensive player on the team with the highest offensive rating when Kobe, Shaq, T-Mac, Kidd, Duncan, and Garnett, were all near the top of their games.\n\nNow for the important part: Ray’s skillset.\n\nRay Allen 2001 – Playmaking (Proficient– 6); Scoring (Elite– 7); Defense (Average– 5); Rebounding (Proficient– 5)\n\nIf we were to break this down even further, he’d definitely be a Transcendent “Floor Spacer” which is precisely the kind of scorer that we need.\n\nTo successfully function as a team, it’s important to have personalities that can mesh. Not everyone can have the maniacal drive of Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant. You also need some mellow players, and this Undefeated article beautifully describes Ray’s professionalism:\n\nWhile Allen appeared to be cool with most of his Celtics teammates, he rarely engaged in any foolishness in the locker room when the media was there or on the team flights, sources said. He was often a loner who kept to himself. Once he completed his weight lifting, shooting and treatment, he typically left the Celtics’ training facility while others hung around, a source said.\n\nand\n\nAllen was always in amazing shape as if he was training for the Boston Marathon, which his mother, Flo Allen-Hopson, ran several times. One Celtics employee said Allen often ate chicken and salads. He rarely ate so-called bad foods and didn’t drink alcohol.\n\nHe definitely was an influence on me in that aspect,” Pierce said. “I changed the way I was eating and my diet. He influenced a lot of the young guys. He didn’t drink. He ate well. He was the cleanest NBA player you can come up with.\n\n-Marc J. Spears, “Ray Allen Was the Most Interesting Man in the NBA — On and Off the Court,” 2016\n\nI definitely want a player with this skillset and demeanor. Come aboard Mr. Allen.\n\nNow that we have the legwork out of the way, the next installments will focus exclusively on the player selections.\n\nStats from basketball reference, stats.nba, and NBAWOWY.\n\nArticle Length: about 2,100 words.\n\nThe “Part 3” in the title means that you’re doing yourself a disservice by not reading part 1 and part 2, but if it’s a choice between reading this one or reading none, then by all means continue on.\n\nPart 2 ended with a discussion about Klay, Durant, and Steph seamlessly blending their scoring abilities because of the particular ways (mostly floor spacing) that they all score.\n\nOn a theoretical level, this means that for a scorer to mitigate diminishing returns for other scorers on the team, they need to be an “Elite” or better “Floor Spacer” which Thompson, Durant, and Curry all are. Jordan and Pippen, the two main scorers for the Bulls, are not “Elite” floor spacers. While both were at least “Proficient” “Cutters,” you couldn’t reliably count on their spot up ability which is why they were successful with only one “Transcendent” scorer in Jordan because nobody was better at being “Ball Dominant” than he. As for the Celtics, McHale needed the rock to score since he mastered the greatest array of post moves in NBA history. On the other hand, Bird was a masterful “Cutter,” and the original “Floor Space” which allowed McHale more room to operate.\n\nOn scoring though, James Harden’s ominous claim about the Warriors that there’s “Only one basketball“ seems to somewhat miss the point. Harden is literally correct that only one person maximum can score per a single possession, but there’s so much more to a team’s offense beyond scoring. When you have players who unselfishly pass the ball, and when other teams need to seriously guard every single player on the court (unlike how teams treat Tony Allen, Andre Roberson, Joakim Noah, etc.), ball movement works to both get players open shots and tire defensive players. If you look at team passing and assist data, the Celtics followed by the Warriors led the league in total passes per game with the Warriors followed by the Celtics leading the league in assists per game. Intuitively, this points towards passing as being a skill that isn’t affected as much by diminishing returns; however, and this is an important differentiation, you need multiple “Cogs” and/or “Floor Generals” to fully take advantage of this skill. Having multiple “Dime Droppers,” players similar to Chris Paul and John Wall, can easily diminish their skills because only one player maximum can score an assist during any scoring possessions. While it may help open up the floor for another “Cog” on the court, that specific ability is less useful when grouped together than a “Cog’s” ability.\n\nThis brings us to the skillset that seems to be mostly unaffected by diminishing returns: defense. Much like scoring and passing though, not all aspects of defense can be multiplied advantageously for the team. Ultimately, this is what differentiates Draymond Green’s defense and Rudy Gobert’s defense and why Green will win DPOY later this month. Rudy Gobert is tremendous at defending the rim, but his inability to switch on defense opens him up to being bamboozled by quicker guards.\n\nDraymond defends the rim at an elite level while being able to switch onto any position in the league. This is what people mean when they say somebody can guard 1-5: the player can switch onto a player of any position and not give up a noticeable advantage. Check out this scatter plot of the fifteen players who contested the most shots per game at the rim (of players who played at least sixty games). The lower the “X” on the graph, the better the rim protector.\n\nNotice the “x” on the far right and way at the bottom? That’s Gobert, meaning that he contested the most shots at the rim per game and made the shooter miss that shot at a higher percentage (-12.8 percentage points off their usual shooting percentage at the rim) than most anyone else. What about that other “x” that’s even a little lower than Gobert’s? Oh yeah, that’s Draymond…with that incredibly rare combination of lateral speed, strength, and rim protecting ability, Draymond is one of the greatest defenders we’ve ever seen, and both Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe have acknowledged that on their respective podcasts. Also, notice that Jokic is garbage at rim protection. Players literally shoot better at the rim when he is defending.\n\nIf I had a lineup of five Gobert’s, they would do an excellent job of rotating to protect the rim, and no shot in the paint would be easy against them, but faster guards who can shoot would toast them at the perimeter. Not a lineup of Draymond Greens. They could effectively protect the rim and switch on a pick-and-roll. Ultimately, that would be the best defensive lineup in NBA history, and I don’t think it can realistically be topped ( a possible defensive lineup that would be better: Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan. Even then, the five Draymonds would be better. A fantastical better lineup would be three [or four] Scottie Pippens with two [or one] Olajuwons [or Ben Wallaces]. These are the deep questions that I tweet about with no response from more established sports writers. I also stand by my change from Garnett to Olajuwon or Wallace). The following video does a great job of illustrating Draymond’s versatility on the defensive end by showing him switch onto every Blazer in one possession.\n\nI haven’t discussed rebounding as much because, at the end of the day, it’s the least important skillset to consider when building a team. The LeBron Heat years never had a player average over 8.3 rebounds per game, and during their 66-win season, LeBron led the team with 8 rebounds per game (he also led the team with 6.9 rebounds per game in 2013-14). If you argue that their success was an outlier because they had LeBron, then you’re missing the point. LeBron is not inherently dominant and a game changer. LeBron, like all basketball players, happens to fit a very particular archetype that is conducive to success that doesn’t include rebounding.\n\nLook, rebounds are plenty important, and even Dean Oliver identified rebounds as one of the Four Factors in winning, but it’s easily covered up or dominated by a single player. The incredibly innovative Benjamin Morris (again…) proved this in his epic defense of Dennis Rodman as possibly the greatest player of all time (no hyperbole…maybe). It’s a very long read, but one of the greatest pieces of sports analytics out there. Here’s a snippet of a conversation he recalls having with one of his buddies about Dennis Rodman being “the best 3rd best player” ever. This on its own may change the way that you think about star power and team construction:\n\n“Well, it’s tough to say when it’s hard to even define ‘third-best’ player, but [blah blah, ramble ramble, inarticulate nonsense] I guess I’d say he easily had 1st-best player value, which [blah blah, something about diminishing returns, blah blah] . . . which makes him the best 3rd-best player by a wide margin”.\n\n“How wide?”\n\n“Well, it’s not like he’s as valuable as Michael Jordan, but he’s the best 3rd-best player by a wider margin than Jordan was the best 1st-best player.”\n\n“So you’re saying he was better than Michael Jordan.”\n\n“No, I’m not saying that. Michael Jordan was clearly better.”\n\n“OK, take a team with Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman on it. Which would hurt them more, replacing Michael Jordan with the next-best primary scoring option in NBA history, or replacing Rodman with the next-best defender/rebounder in NBA history?”\n\n“I’m not sure, but probably Rodman.”\n\n“So you’re saying a team should dump Michael Jordan before it should dump Dennis Rodman?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know for sure, I’m not sure exactly how valuable other defender-rebounders are, but regardless, it would be weird to base the whole argument on who happens to be the 2nd-best player. I mean, what if there were two Michael Jordan’s, would that make him the least valuable starter on an All-Time team?”\n\n“Well OK, how common are primary scoring options that are in Jordan’s league value-wise?”\n\n“There are none, I’m pretty sure he has the most value.”\n\n“BALLPARK.”\n\n“I dunno, there are probably between 0 and 2 in the league at any given time.”\n\n“And how common are defender/rebounder/dirty workers that are in Rodman’s league value-wise?”\n\n“There are none.”\n\n“BALLPARK.”\n\n“There are none. Ballpark.”\n\n“So, basically, if a team had Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman on it, and they could replace either with some random player ‘in the ballpark’ of the next-best player for their role, they should dump Jordan before they dump Rodman?”\n\n“Maybe. Um. Yeah, probably.”\n\n“And I assume that this holds for anyone other than Jordan?”\n\n“I guess.”\n\n“So say you’re head-to-head with me and we’re drafting NBA All-Time teams, you win the toss, you have first pick, who do you take?”\n\n“I don’t know, good question.”\n\n“No, it’s an easy question. The answer is: YOU TAKE RODMAN. You just said so.”\n\n“Wait, I didn’t say that.”\n\n“O.K., fine, I get the first pick. I’ll take Rodman. . . Because YOU JUST TOLD ME TO.”\n\n“I don’t know, I’d have to think about it. It’s possible.”\n\n-Benjamin Morris (2011)\n\nHere’s what Morris is implying in a nutshell: Michael Jordan’s skillset as the GOAT compared to, for argument’s sake, LeBron’s skillset is a smaller margin of dominance as the first option than Dennis Rodman’s skillset over the next best possible third option because Rodman’s unparalleled “Transcendent” dominance in his skillset. Morris even offhandedly references “Diminishing Returns” because Rodman’s skills blend in so fluidly compared to “Ball Dominant” scorers and other popular skillsets.\n\nLet’s not forget that Dennis Rodman was also a 1st Team all Defense for multiple years, so he still combines his “Transcendent” rebounding with “Transcendent” defense. He’s the guy, like Draymond, that you want not as your first option, but as your third-onward option.\n\nWhat does all this mean when constructing a team? It helps point us in the correct direction when somebody inevitably asks the following question: if you could make the best team possible choosing from the following group, who would you choose? Endless possibilities exist to answer this question, but it should somewhat follow this formula:\n\nAn emphasis on as many “Cogs” (players who effectively move the ball) and “Chameleons” (players who can switch onto multiple positions on defense) as possible since they yield the least diminishing returns when grouped together.\n\nAt least one or two “Elite” or better scorers. If you choose multiple scorers, make sure that they are either “Floor Spacers” or “Cutters.”\n\nYou absolutely need “Floor Spacers.” Don’t fall into the same trap as the Cavaliers and just build with “Floor Spacers” that can’t defend though. The Warriors have an excellent selection that can both defend and pass.\n\nIt never hurts to have a couple of players that can rebound. Most elite teams have a “garbage” player of some kind.\n\nOne thing that I never discuss in all of this is the necessity of leadership and having players that aren’t afraid of the moment. Bill Simmons discusses the best teams as those that have “been there” before (2010). They have won championships, so they bring a level of swagger that helps to shed any doubt on the team. I still need to think on this a bit more before I write any further, but I want to acknowledge that this is an important aspect of successful teams. I immediately think of Chauncey Billups or any player that brings a “Veteran Presence” to a team who contributes more than the box score indicates.\n\nOkay, let’s recap quickly because I just spilled a ton of cyber ink in this series.\n\nAll NBA players (and any basketball players ever) can be broken down into four archetypal skillsets which can then be broken down more: Playmaking, Scoring, Defending, and Rebounding.\n\nThe goal of team construction centers around mitigating diminishing returns of specific skills. It’s not enough to just have the “best” players, for those players’ skills must complement each other in a way that they don’t encroach upon each other’s skills.\n\nEach one of these skillsets can be ranked from “Transcendent” to “Inadequate” depending on the player.\n\nAn analysis of specific players and their skillsets (such as Draymond, Curry, Durant, and Gobert) reveal that dominance in a specific subset of each skillset is more important than generally just being a good “scorer.”\n\nAn overview of a few of the greatest teams in history reveals that “Cogs” and “Chameleons’ are the two subsets of the skillsets that most effectively mitigate diminishing returns.\n\nHopefully this helps to orient discussions about team construction and how to choose the most effective lineups. This also serves as a useful (and lengthy) introduction to my next team building project which I will once again unveil in multiple parts. Let’s see how difficult it is to not break my own rules!\n\nAll statistics either from basketballreference.com or stats.nba.com\n\nArticle length: about 1,700 words\n\n(Edit from the future: here are the links to part 2 and part 3).\n\nThe 2016-17 season has unveiled the greatest team in NBA history: The Golden State Warriors. Most fans would incorrectly argue that the ’96 Bulls hold that throne even though Jordan and Pippen were past their primes (Pippen just barely), their post play was insufficient, and their depth was undesirable. Bill Simmons in his The Book of Basketball also points to the watered down of talent in the league at that time (2010). Simmons might argue that the ’86 Celtics still reign as the greatest ever, and I must say, it makes for a very intriguing debate about time periods; however, the sheer dominance of the Warriors’ starters along with the productivity of their bench still convince me that no team could beat them in a seven-game series.\n\nThis post isn’t interested in debating which team is the best and why though. My interest lies in the team construction that makes a team dominant and successful. Why are the ’86 Celtics and ’17 Warriors regarded as the best? What do (did) they have that other teams don’t? And, of course, what could theoretically make them better? Ultimately, this theoretical framework will inform a forthcoming article (series?) where I construct the Second Tier Universe Cup Team. If you’re anything like me, you’ll find this new wrinkle more interesting than the first.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous article where I criticized Team USA’s Olympic team after analyzing the best superstar duos and trios in history:\n\nThis lays a solid groundwork for showing what is required to be the best for superstars to mesh: at least a dominant scorer, multiple excellent defenders, and multiple above average playmakers with one excellent playmaker.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “Building a Super Team and Other Observations,” 2016\n\nThe question now is broader and requires more definitions though because no theory (even basketball theory) is complete with pedantic definitions, so buckle up, and I promise that the end result of reading this series will be worth it for looking at basketball with a new perspective.\n\nAt their core, it seems that every basketball player can be boiled down to four distinct archetypes much like an RPG like “The Elder Scrolls.” These archetypes depend on four core skills: playmaking, scoring, defense, and rebounding. One can reduce each of these skills near infinitely to capture the myriad subtleties involved with the beautiful game, but I won’t spend much time doing that now. If you want a weird, philosophical dive into a Borgesian analysis of Ginobili’s creativity, then I urge you to read this and this article. I will try and differentiate a bit between very different skillsets within these archetypal skills such as offensive rebounding vs. defensive rebounding and off-ball shooting scorers vs. isolations scorers.\n\nJust replace these with basketball terms, and you basically have what I’m talking about.\n\nI have broken down each of these archetypal categories into a 0-10 scale where each number is associated with a tier of ability (again, like an RPG). This scale is as follows: Transcendent- 10-9; Elite – 8-7; Proficient – 6-5; Average – 4; Sub-par – 3-2; Inadequate – 1-0. I’ll discuss the meaning behind each of these a little later.\n\nIs this an exact science? Oh goodness no, but it’s a good place to start when trying to define team building. My gut tells me, as I more simply stated in that aforementioned article, that successful teams have an abundance of playmakers and defenders, at least one player who can score at will, and adequate rebounding.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? To me, a playmaker is a player that can create offense for his teammates. Most people look to assists to measure this, but the skill goes far beyond that. It includes players who help the offense function smoother through unselfishness and a skillset that draws their opponents’ attention. For example, players like Magic Johnson and Steve Nash score very high in this category because of how they can set their teammates up to make easy shots (they also post extremely high assist totals). Conversely, Stephen Curry and LeBron James would also score very high despite their average assist numbers because of their different abilities – Curry’s tremendous gravity and LeBron’s strength and IQ – promote teammate success. Essentially, if a playmaker is on the court, his team’s offense shouldn’t stagnate. We can differentiate playmakers in three ways: excellent passers who set up individual teammates for easy shots (let’s call them “Dime Droppers”), unselfish passers who don’t hold the ball too long during an offensive possession (let’s call them “Cogs”), and players who excel in both these categories (“Floor Generals”).\n\nA scorer then is a player who can score the basketball. Groundbreaking, right, but the intrigue lies in the details. How do you compare a scorer like Dominique Wilkins and Peja Stojakovic? How do you compare Ray Allen with Tracy McGrady? How do you compare Shaq with Kobe? Differentiating these abilities is key to building a successful lineup because basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills (to me, this is the true beauty of the Warriors’ offense, and I will get to that later). If a team has five Carmelo Anthonys, every Carmelo won’t average 30 points per game on good efficiency. While we can definitely differentiate scorers into many many categories, let’s just stick to just a few for now: players who need the ball in their hands to create scoring opportunities (“Ball Dominant”), floor spacers who score efficiently off spot-up and other off-ball shooting possessions (“Floor Spacers” actually has a classic ring to it), and players who can either (or both) dive to the basket or run in transition for easy scoring opportunities (“Runners”), and the combinations of these skills (it’s tough coming up with names).\n\n…basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “NBA Theory: Player Archetypes and Team Construction Part 1,” 2017\n\nA defender is a player who makes it more difficult for the other team to score. By far, this is the most difficult to quantify statistically, and even with the advent of analytics, we have no great way to express a player’s defensive worth through a singular number, so specific player categorizations are more open for debate. This makes comparing the worth of two players’ defensive impacts extremely difficult as discussed by Ben Dowsett. Which would be more impactful for a team defense: Gobert’s stalward rim-protection or Draymond Green’s ability to seamlessly switch 1-5? As always, the answer is that it depends. Defense can be broken down to four different categories: a defender who can shut down a single matchup (“Lockdown Defender”), a player who protects the basket effectively (“Rim Protector”), switch-happy players that can defend multiple positions and allow the team to switch more smoothly (“Chameleons” because they can blend in with any system), and players who can disrupt offenses off the ball by playing free safety, so to speak (“Roamers”).\n\nFinally, rebounders are players who clean the glass either on the offensive or defensive glass. Like scoring, this is probably best quantified through the many advanced statistics at our disposal such as Offensive Rebound Percentage and Contested Rebounds. This can be split into two categories: players who excel at grabbing offensive rebounds (“Offensive Rebounders”) and players who excel at grabbing defensive rebounds (“Defensive Rebounders”).\n\nBefore I can apply this theory to any specific player, it’s first necessary to define each level of grading on the above continuum. Starting at the bottom (now, where am I?), we have “Inadequate” which applies to a deficiency in the specific skill that significantly hurts the team. This is a bit tricky because some skills aren’t as important for certain positions such as rebounding and, to a small degree, defense for point guards while a center who isn’t a good rebounder would cause a net negative for his team. Scoring a “Sub-par” means that a player has a deficiency in a certain skill, but that deficiency isn’t as much of a concern as an Inadequate skill. Think of Andre Roberson’s free-throw shooting as a good example. It’s poor enough that teams can employ the “Hack-a” strategy against him which significantly hurts the Thunder; however, if he were just above this level where teams couldn’t target him, I would consider that “Sub-par.”\n\nBeing “Proficient” and “Average” are very difficult to differentiate between, but I would draw the line at reliability. A player who is “Proficient” in a specific skill is one who can, most of the time, execute that skillset. Players like J.R. Smith add an extra level of difficulty in this because he defies the reliability aspect of this definition; however, I would feel comfortable with him shooting open threes over most any “Average” shooters while the apex of his skillset is significantly higher than “Average” shooters.\n\nHere’s where things get interesting and where teams are truly constructed. Players who fall within the “Elite” and “Transcendent” levels are those who are considered stars. Remember this: teams cannot be successful without “Elite” or higher skills in multiple skillsets (I’ll discuss which ones a little later). On a definitional level, these are the two easiest levels to differentiate between. A player with an “Elite” skillset means that they are one of the best in the league at the time that they are (were) playing at that skillset. Players who have a “Transcendent” skillset means that they are in the upper echelon of that skillset regardless of time. You could pluck them out of their temporal playing moment and plop them in any time period, and they would still be one of the best. Their ability “transcends” time.\n\nNow we can get to the interesting part and apply these definitions to actual players to see what team makeups have been successful. Just as a reminder, players cannot be judged as a conglomeration of their entire careers. A player must be chosen during a specific year of their career that spans both the playoffs and the regular season. You can apply this to either one of the two, but you miss out by not judging a player based off the entirety of the season and post-season. In the next article, I’ll lay out how this will look for specific players.\n\nArticle length: about 1,700 words or 9-13 minutes of reading.\n\nThe MVP polls are closed, and all we can do now is wait until June 26th for the NBA’s inaugural regular season award show. I don’t want to waste valuable space complaining about that now, so I’m just going to get right to the point of this article.\n\nNBA.com has a place where fans can vote for their top 5 MVP candidates which is precisely how media members have already cast their ballots. Two days ago, I cast my more-than-likely meaningless ballot where I finally decided on who deserves MVP for the 206-17 season.\n\nAnd I voted for Stephen Curry.\n\nI’ll reveal the rest of my hand with my full five-player ballot:\n\nStephen Curry\n\nJames Harden\n\nRussell Westbrook\n\nKawhi Leonard\n\nLeBron James\n\nI didn’t plan on writing this article until I realized that nobody (save for Benjamin Morris who I will cite more later) held my opinion that Curry should be MVP. Trust me, I’ve read countless articles, spoken to a few fans, and listened to podcast after podcast, and everyone from Nate Duncan, Danny Leroux, and Zach Lowe to Bill Simmons, Brian Windhorst, and Joe House claimed that Westbrook, Harden, and sometimes Leonard deserved it. Curry was always an afterthought, but a couple of these NBA fanatics admitted that Durant would’ve had a chance had he not been injured. Look, I don’t claim to be smarter about basketball than any of these folks. Their job is literally to watch, talk about, and write about basketball, but I wouldn’t consider myself a common fan. I’ve done my research, watched tons of games, and used Benjamin Morris as my guiding light. Just trust me enough to read this and see if I can’t sway you just a little bit from Westbrook or Harden.\n\nMy main premise stands on the idea that winning a championship is the most important part of an NBA season. It’s not controversial to claim that almost all players/coaches/fans/GMs/etc would take a championship over any other accolade. If this is the case, shouldn’t the MVP be given to the player that provides the best chance of winning a championship? Obviously, this isn’t the only part of one’s season-long resume to consider, but it should be the most salient one. Because of this, I value a player that takes a team from good to great more than a player that takes a team from bad to good.\n\nWith that said, here are the candidates and their records, playoff seed, and full NBA seed:\n\nWestbrook 47-35, 6 (10)\n\nLeBron 51-31, 2 (8)\n\nHarden 55-27, 3 (3)\n\nKawhi 61-21, 2 (2)\n\nAnd what about my pick for MVP?\n\nCurry 67-15, 1 (1)\n\nOh, and there have only been 5 teams EVER with a better record than the current Warriors (including last year’s Warriors). Six other teams in NBA history have won 67 games including Curry’s 2014-15 Warriors. Westbrook and Harden take their teams from pitiful to good. Curry takes them from great to transcendent (as proven by my above numbers). Let’s also take a look at a net rating comparison between the MVP candidates as published by Benjamin Morris:\n\nJames and Westbrook had a lot more ground to make up, but Curry, unlike Harden and Leonard, was able to take a good team to greatness.\n\nCody! Durant joining the Warriors made them a cheat code which means Curry forfeits MVPs for the rest of his career.\n\nNot so fast. Durant missed 18 games (about a quarter of the season) this year, so we have a solid enough sample size to analyze in that time even with the Warrior’s “depleted” depth this year without Bogut and Ezeli and with Iguodala and Livingston aging. During this 18 game stretch, guess which team had the best record in the league? If you guessed the Rockets, Spurs, Cavs, or Thunder, then you’re wrong (Spurs were second though). The Warriors popped off a 15-4 record while boasting an 11 net rating during that time. The second-best net rating during that time was the Trailblazers…..with a 6.6 (remember, net rating is offensive rating [points per 100 possessions] minus defensive rating [points allowed per 100 possessions]).\n\nDo you realize how good an 11 net rating is? If you look at the entire 2016-2017 season, it’s better than every single team’s net rating. As a quick comparison, the Warriors with pre-Durant injury had a net rating of 12.7 through the first 57 games, and a whopping 13.4 net rating if you toss out their embarrassing first game when the Spurs showed them the business. However, the Durant-less Warriors’ net rating is only lower than 2015-16 Spurs, 73 win Warriors, and the 69-win Bulls team from 1996-97 (the furthest back NBA.com’s numbers go).\n\nAccording to basketball reference, only 4 teams have ever boasted a higher net rating (MOV [margin of victory] for basketball reference) than 11: the 71-72 Lakers, the 70-71 Bucks (represent), 71-72 Bucks (represent), and the 95-96 Bulls. Granted, Basketball reference’s MOV statistic is a tad different than net rating, but since the 2016-17 Warriors’ pace was 99.9, the two numbers should be almost identical. The only teams that have grabbed a higher net rating than the Durant-less Warriors this year were teams that had the following teammates: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson, and Bob Dandridge; and finally, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Elgin Baylor (for part of the season). We’re talking a team led by the trio of Curry, Green, and Thompson. You’re telling me that Curry isn’t valuable on a transcendent scale?\n\nBenajamin Morris, the author of the pantheon NBA articles “The Hidden Value of the NBA Steal” and “The Case for Dennis Rodman,” wrote the most convincing piece of 538’s “The Case for” MVP series where he selected Curry. Morris includes the following statistical image in his article:\n\nThis basically shows that Curry’s presence on the court simply makes his teammates much more efficient shooters than the other MVP candidates, and really, the comparison isn’t really close; however, this model obviously has a fair bit of noise since it’s somewhat dependent on his teammates’ abilities to shoot the basketball independent from his presence which Westbrook’s teammates are simply not as good at. Still though, these shooters are clearly finding their mark much better with Curry hanging around the perimeter.\n\nThe clearest case study of Curry’s transcendent value is a college game between Loyola and Davidson on November 25, 2008. Through this season, Curry led the NCAA in scoring with an average of 28.6 points per game, but during this November matchup, Curry was held scoreless. He took and missed all three of his shots, and his statline was as follows:\n\nPLAYERS MIN FG 3FG FT OFF DEF REB AST STL BLK TO PF PTS Curry 32 0-3 0-1 0-0 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 3 0\n\nCurry’s Davidson won this game with a score of 78 to 48. How did this happen? According to the NYTimes, “The scene was surreal: Davidson’s Stephen Curry standing in the corner with two defenders draped over him while his teammates were playing in a virtual four-on-three power play, making one wide-open 3-pointer after another.” This is not hyperbole. Jim Patsos, Loyola’s coach, ran a triangle-and-two defense with the full intention to stop Steph Curry from scoring. Because of this, Curry’s teammates wrecked Loyola. Here are the other starters’ statlines from that game:\n\nPLAYERS MIN FG 3FG FT OFF DEF REB AST STL BLK TO PF PTS Rossiter 31 2-4 0-0 2-2 3 3 6 6 2 2 1 2 6 Lovedale 29 8-14 0-0 4-5 1 9 10 0 0 0 2 0 20 Barr 25 6-12 6-11 0-0 1 3 4 1 1 0 0 0 18 Paulhus Gosselin 16 0-0 0-0 0-0 1 1 2 3 0 0 1 4 0\n\nSo, should Lovedale be considered the MVP of this game with a 20-10 statline?\n\nHarden and Westbrook are putting up historical numbers, but Westbrook’s historically high usage and assist rate show me that he doesn’t know how to impact a game without the ball which Curry has mastered. Harden, LeBron, and Westrbook dominate the ball, and the offense runs through them. The Warriors’ offense runs because of Curry. The best statistic to show this is that Curry led the league in secondary assists and plays for the team that leads the league in secondary assists (a secondary assist is when a player passes the ball to the player that throws an assist).\n\nUnfortunately, Curry has two things going against him: a narrative and history. Nobody wants to admit it, but a narrative is the single greatest determiner of an MVP every season, and nothing is sexier this year than Westbrook, being left at the alter by Durant, going full god-mode and dragging the Thunder to a 6th spot in the West. It was so easy and fun to track his triple double progress that we got lost in the actual point of NBA basketball: to win. Sure, Westbrook’s clutch stats are astounding, and the Thunder would have lost significantly more games without him, but that’s too small scale. The Thunder have no chance of winning the title, and I would nearly put my life savings on the Warriors winning it all this year.\n\nHistory, the other thing going against Curry, is hitting him from three different angles: Westbrook will be the second player since Oscar in the 60s to average a triple double, Harden will score and assist more points than any player ever, and LeBron will continue clawing at MJ’s GOAT status. Even Bill Simmons wrote that this season belongs to Westbrook. After losing to Davidson, Patsos, the aforementioned Loyola coach, presciently stated, “I’m a history major. They’re going to remember that we held him scoreless, or we lost by 30?” He’s correct. We’re going to remember that Westbrook averaged a triple double. We’re going to remember that Harden created more points than any other player in history. We’re going to remember that LeBron still lurked in the NBA shadows until the Finals rolled around. We’re going to remember that the unanimous MVP in Curry was part of a team that blew a 3-1 lead in the finals a year ago. We’re not going to remember that Chef Curry (the Silent Assassin) raised his team’s net rating to be similar to two of the greatest teams of all time.\n\nIf you believe that a player’s true value lies in his ability to make his team an actual candidate to win the title, then based on the 2016-17 regular season, Curry is the clear choice. Even if you remove Durant from the Warriors, Curry’s team is still the favorite to win it all. Looking back at the fateful Loyal vs. Davidson game, we need to move away from evaluating players solely on what they can do with the ball; we need to put a greater emphasis on how a player can impact the game without the basketball in his hands.\n\nArticle Length: ~2,200 words or about 10-13 minutes of reading\n\nThe season is well underway, and I haven’t written a single blog post about it so far. I’ve tried tweeting more this season, but honestly that’s not my cup of tea. I tried (in the last couple of days) being more active on Facebook, but again I think social media just isn’t my forte. So I apologize for ignoring tons of important happenings around the league, but my post for today is one that I wanted to release before the season began. We’ve past the quarter mark, so unfortunately, I know too much to make it quite as fun.\n\nThis blog post is based off a classic sports question: if I could start an NBA team with any two players, who would I pick? I’ll do three variations of his question today regarding this season, the next five seasons, and the next ten seasons. For the first part, I want to start a team by choosing only two players to start. My one and only goal for the season is to win a championship. For the second part, my only goal is to win as many championships in five years, and the pattern continues for the third part. Let’s get started.\n\nQuestion One: which two players do I choose to win a championship this season?\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, LeBron is a lock for one of the two spots. Even as his age rises, his production remains at an astoundingly high level, and nothing illustrates that more than last Finals where he led both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks while dragging his down-and-out Cavaliers from a 3-1 deficit against the unanimous MVP in Curry and the greatest regular season team in NBA history. Truly a storybook Finals for LeBron, the Cavaliers, and the city of Cleveland. Even this year where LeBron has taken his biggest step back in scoring, his team leads the Easter Conference, and he’s still in the top 5 MVP candidates for the year. You cannot convince me that LeBron isn’t worthy of selection.\n\nThe second choice is much more difficult, and honestly I tried writing this post a couple of months ago, but I became so frustrated by not being able to select a second player that I just left it alone. In my opinion, only two players deserve to be in the conversation, and interestingly enough, they are currently teammates: Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry (side note: Anthony Davis is really close to also being included, but I can’t trust his porcelain structure to remain intact for an entire season/post-season). Most would say that Curry is the obvious choice as he is coming off one of (if not the) most impressive season in NBA History (playoffs excluded), but the two things that greatly concern me about him are his defense and his performance post knee injury. Like Bird before him, Curry makes up for his poor one-on-one defensive attributes by being an above average team defender which helped him lead the league in steals per game, but those instincts aren’t enough completely cover his defensive woes as the Cavaliers game-plan in the Finals proved.\n\nKevin Durant has proven this season that he can fit right into an already established team by simply taking more efficient and more open shots. I was worried that Durant would struggle with the Warriors game-plan which is predicated off ball movement and player movement (the latter of which never being Durant’s strong suit), but he has done a marvelous job of letting himself move off the ball. In the past, Durant’s defense has been hit-or-miss at best, but starting with the Warriors/Thunder playoff series last season, Durant has been on a tear defensively, and with the Warriors, he has posted career highs in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and blocks along with his second best defensive rating during a season.\n\nMy final verdict is that I would start a team with LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Their games complement each other perfectly as LeBron looks to facilitate and run the plays as Durant likes to, well, score efficiently. When locked in, they would become the most terrifying defensive duo on the league, and on the fastbreak, no duo in history could hold a candle to them. Currently LeBron leads the league in fastbreak points per game (where he shoots 76.5%) and Durant is fifth in the league (where he shoots 60.6%).\n\nVerdict: LeBron/Durant\n\nHindsight verdict 2015-2016: LeBron/Curry\n\nQuestion Two: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next five seasons?\n\nFive years is a long time in the basketball world. Five years ago the Miami Heat were just coming off an embarrassing Finals loss to the Dallas Mavericks led by god-mode Nowitzki. In the present, Nowitzki will probably retire after the end of the season. The point is that choosing who will be consistently successful over the course of five years is extremely difficult if not impossible. Five years ago, Curry only played 26 games, and people thought that his career would be lost to injuries. Mind-blowing huh?\n\nPlayers within the 23-27 year-old range are more than likely the best candidates for this thought experiment. Right around 29 is general a player’s prime, but many players find their best seasons to be right around 31-33. Unfortunately, this means that LeBron won’t make my duo. For as many minutes as he has played already, I can’t see him staying this productive until he’s 36-37. Sorry ‘Bron.\n\nDurant is 28 and some change, but I’m going to have to select him as my first option. Along with my defense of him above, I have a strong feeling that his game will age gracefully a-la Kobe, MJ, and Dirk who learned to dominate the midrange and post-game. His length and size will always make him a serviceable defender as well.\n\nLike the first question, the second choice here is much tougher. LeBron is the perfect starting point because he works best with other high-volume scorers e.g. Kyrie Irving and Dwyane Wade. Durant is not like this, and I’m not quite sure what kind of player would complement him the best (besides LeBron). I’m not picking Curry because A), I don’t think he’s necessarily the best choice for Durant’s sidekick, and B) did you know Curry is actually a couple hundred days older than Durant? I don’t see Curry’s dominance holding up as he hits his early thirties.\n\nDurant needs to be with a player that doesn’t look to score as a first option. Durant can run an offense well-enough, but I would preferably have a different, better playmaking player running the show. Or, I could go a different direction and select a hard-nosed, defensive menace of a post-player. Why am I not immediately jumping at the chance to pair Anthony Davis and Durant to make the longest duo in NBA history? Well I’m not sold on Anthony Davis. He has the range, athleticism, and defensive speed of a young Kevin Garnett, but he simply doesn’t playmake well (he has more turnovers than assists this season), he shoots too many jumpshots, and he is extremely fragile. Am I overthinking things? Of course I am. Really I think a great complement for Durant would be Draymond Green, but I feel that I’d be wasting my second pick if I didn’t take a more elite player.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’d regret not taking Davis. I can’t imagine a team with quick enough or big enough defenders to guard both of them adequately…hell teams can’t guard either one adequately as it is! With the right defensive scheme too, teams would struggle mightily with a Durant/Davis switching scheme. The possibilities are endless.\n\nQuick explanation: I feel that so far, Westbrook, Harden, and Leonard have been swept under the rug. Westbrook and Harden (especially Westbrook) are putting up anomalous seasons, the likes of which we have never witnessed. Both of them are magnificent to watch, and they truly are winners. Unfortunately, I can’t trust Westbrook’s decision making, and Harden’s defensive awareness and leadership leave much to be desired. Leonard to me is still a solid tier beneath these players, and I think he’s a much better fit with a primary defender and playmaker than a straight up scorer.\n\nVerdict: Kevin Durant/Anthony Davis\n\nHindsight Verdict 5 years ago (2011-12): LeBron/Durant\n\nQuestion Three: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next ten seasons?\n\nLeBron will be 41. Durant will be 38. Vince Carter will be 40ish days from 50. I think it’s time to really scout the young guns. Right now, this is the most excited that I can recall being excited for a current batch of young talent such as Karl Anthony Towns, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving (dude is only 24??), Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, D’Angelo Russell, and the list goes on. The next 15 years will be extremely exciting to watch develop.\n\nTwo huge factors contribute to my decision about these two players: who will contribute sufficiently to win soon (front-loaders) and who will contribute consistently for the next 10 years (back-loaders). If I focused primarily on that 19-24 year-old range, the two top front-loaders are Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. Irving has been a starting point guard for two Finals qualifying teams, and iced a game 7 to win the Finals against the 73-9 Warriors. Irving is not afraid of the moment, and Davis is seasoned enough to jump right into the playoffs.\n\nIn a shocking twist of events though, I will not be selecting either of these two players. Kyrie Irving is a truly special scorer, and in isolation situations this season, nobody stacks up to him. The below scatter plot show the 15 players who attempt the most field goals per game in an isolation situation. The Y-Axis shows those players’ effective field goal percentages. Remember: being above the line is a good thing.\n\nWhile he is special as a scorer, I think that he’s somewhat lost as the main ball-handler. He needs a player like a LeBron, Giannis, Draymond, or any player with whom Curry would thrive. As the above link also discusses, his defense leaves much to be desired.\n\nI really can’t put my finger on why I’m not as high on Anthony Davis. Maybe it’s his injury history, his overrated defense, his poor playmaking ability, or a combination of the three. Davis is special, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think he’s as special as some might make you believe. He’s long and athletic, which is a combination, as I’ve discussed previously, is one that I cherish. So what two players could impossibly long and athletic enough to fit my desires? What players really seem to be on the brink of revolutionizing the league? I’ll tell you who, but I must admit that I’m wildly biased in my first pick. I choose Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nGiannis finally made the leap this year. As I’ve tweeted about before, Giannis is in the running for defensive player of the year. He also can (somewhat) play and guard all five positions, and is confidently leading a Middleton-less Bucks squad above .500. Giannis is legit, and the fact that he only recently turned 22 means that he’s only going to get better and smarter. His athleticism may dwindle slightly as he ages, but his length never will. He still makes plays that nobody in the league can make, and the last player to make similar plays was a younger dude named LeBron James (and oddly enough, a younger Josh Smith).\n\nPorzingis is a unicorn through and through. We simply have never seen anybody like him before. He runs like a deer, plays incredible post defense, shoots a very consistent jumpshot, and has an even temperament. I don’t want to throw the name Dirk out there yet, so I’ll let the stats back me up.\n\nSome may scream that KAT or Embiid should get the nod over him if I’m going to go with a lanky, potential-filled big man, but KAT’s defense is overrated, and he has a tendency to jump into hero-ball mode. Embiid, much like Davis, scares me with his injury history. Maybe he’ll become a post player like we’ve never seen, but maybe he’ll be the next Greg Oden….I’m not denying that Embiid’s potential and skill is off the chart. Much like Oden, Embiid is incredibly skilled and locked into playing defense. Check out this second scatter plot showing the 21 players who defend the most shots at the rim per game. The lower the plot point, the lower the percentage to which the defender holds his opponent to.\n\nThe two lowest points? Embiid and Porzingis. When defending the rim, they cause their opponents to shoot 15.7 percentage points and 14.4 percentage points respectively worse than the shooter would normally shoot.\n\nVerdict: Giannis/Porzingis\n\nHindsight Verdict 10 years ago (2006-07): LeBron James/Tim Duncan (closely followed by Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade as a second choice)\n\nAll stars are either from Basketball Reference or NBA Stats. Graph data extracted from NBA Stats play type data.\n\nArticle length: about 1,300 words or 6-10 minutes of reading.\n\nSince 1999, Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan have combined to both win 55% of all NBA championships and partake in 72% of all Finals. The only other teams to win championships were the Heat (three of them), Pistons (one), Celtics (one), Mavericks (one), Cavaliers (one), and Warriors (one). Only twelve of the thirty teams in the league made an NBA Finals appearance. I don’t quite know what that means in relation to other sports, but for out purposes, it means that Duncan and Kobe left their little, winning fingerprints all over the 2000s. It’s no question that they are, so far, the 1a and 1b players since the turn of the century (with LeBron nipping at their heels).\n\nNow, if you’re like me, 1a and 1b aren’t good enough. One of them has to be better than the other! Either Tim Duncan or Kobe Bryant was the greater basketball player. It really isn’t that simple though. Let’s look at the usual arguments, shall we?\n\nRingzzz – Both Kobe and Tim won five championships. It’s a tie.\n\nAccolades – Duncan has 2 MVPs to Kobe’s 1; Kobe has 18 all-star appearances to Duncan’s 15; both Kobe and Duncan have 15 all-NBA awards; Duncan has 15 all-defensive awards to Kobe’s 12. Duncan edges Kobe out with that second MVP\n\nMain Playoff statistics all-time – scoring: Kobe (3rd) Duncan (6th); rebounding: Duncan (3rd) Kobe (42nd); assists: Kobe (9th) Duncan (29th); blocks: Duncan (1st) Kobe (39th); steals: Kobe (6th) Duncan (36th). I guess it’s a draw?\n\nMain regular season statistics all-time – scoring: Kobe (3rd) Duncan (17th); rebounding: Duncan (7th) Kobe (110th); assists: Kobe (29th) Duncan (94th); blocks: Duncan (6th) Kobe (184); steals Kobe (15th) Duncan (148th). Again, I guess it’s a draw?\n\nI could go on and on, but the main point is that these two have had ridiculously successful careers without clearly being better than the other. Most fans would undoubtedly say that Kobe Bryant was the better player, and they would cite such things as his 81 point game, his frequent buzzer beaters, his terrifying work-ethic stories, and his electric play-style. Father Time Duncan, on the other hand, made a career out of being a perfect team defender, patenting the bank shot, and being a perennial punching bag for The Onion. One of them ended their career with a 60-point scoring outing in a regular season game after a grandiose farewell tour, and the other lost in a playoff heartbreak and officially retired months after the final whistle. The two players could not be more diametrically opposed.\n\nSo, we need to go deeper.\n\nThe biggest difference between these two players is the polar opposite personalities with teammates and their respective organizations. While Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers played possibly the most dominant three-year stretch of basketball of all time, Shaq’s departure sent LA into a spiral of Kobe chuckery that kept LA at mid-level success until the free agents started pouring in. During that time frame, coach Phil Jackson released a book where he stated the following:\n\n“I won’t coach this team next year if [Kobe] is still here. He won’t listen to anyone. I’ve had it with this kid.”\n\nLo and behold, Rudy Tomjanovich took over as the head coach during the next season. Kobe was left to suffer with Chris Mihm and Smush Parker who Kobe publicly disparaged for being terrible in comparison to Nash’s teammates. This culminated in 2007 when Kobe publicly demanded to be traded to either the Chicago Bulls or the Detroit Pistons. This of course quickly disappeared after Pau Gasol joined the Lakers, and the team made three more Finals appearances and scored two more championship trophies. Kobe finally surpassed Shaq’s ring count, but he sure pissed off plenty of people on the road.\n\nAt this point, I want to be absolutely clear that I am not biased in any way shape or form. If you search for positive stories about Kobe Bryant, every single one of them revolves around a maniacal work ethic story that rivals your grandpa’s annual Thanksgiving tale about single-handedly winning World War II. I’m actually convinced that Kobe has a Derek Zoolander-esque backstory, but instead of assassinating world leaders, he was brainwashed to shoot the basketball while having no actual personality.\n\nIn Duncan’s case, you cannot find a bad comment about him. Really the only “dirt” you can dig up on him is that he almost left the Spurs to join forces with Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady on the Magic back in 2000. Actually, if you dig deep enough, you will find that Tim Duncan co-authored a chapter in a psychology book. The chapter is entitled, “Blowhards, Snobs, and Narcissists: Interpersonal Reactions to Excessive Egotism.” I am not kidding you. In Gregg Popovich’s press conference following Tim’s announced retirement, Popovich literally said that he would rather have dinner with Tim Duncan than Mother Theresa, the Dalai Lama, or even Jesus.\n\nBut what does this all have to do with greatness? Who cares about personality when we’re discussing the greatest players of all time? Well with two players that are so similar, it’s necessary to dig as deep as we can to find an answer. From both the eye test and interview accounts, I think it’s safe to assume that Tim was a better teammate than Kobe. Both were great leaders and both won multiple championships (both as the main option and as a sidekick), but playing with Tim ultimately yielded the better experience.\n\nAnd overall, that experience translated into victories. Discounting the 50-game lockout shortened year in 1999, the Spurs have won at least 50 games every year since Duncan joined them. I really don’t have to tell you how remarkable that is, so I’ll let Fran Blinebury continue for me:\n\n“To match San Antonio’s clip, a Major League Baseball team would need 107 wins, a figure that’s only been met 14 times in history and just once (Seattle Mariners, 116) since 2001.”\n\nIf winning is the gauge we’re using, Duncan wins by a landslide.\n\nThis upcoming final point is one that really obscures the whole situation: at what point was Tim actually the best player in the league? This Deadspin article tries answering the question by listing the player with the highest VORP in the league since 1996 (VORP is a fancy advanced metric that quantifies a player’s value into a single stat), and by that metric, Tim was best during the 2001-2002. It also ranks Steve Francis as the best in 2000-2001 with Kobe not ranking as the best in any year. Please reread that sentence and try making sense of it. Let’s look at other advanced metrics and if Tim or Kobe ever ranked at the top for any of them:\n\nBPM (Box Plus Minus)—Duncan in 2002 and 2003. Kobe never.\n\nWin Shares—Duncan in 1999 and 2003. Kobe in 2001.\n\nWin Shares per 48—Duncan in 2003. Kobe never.\n\nWhile relying on statistics is greatly flawed, they at least paint part of the picture in showing how valuable somebody is, but that’s another conversation for another time. The stats seem to think that Tim was at least in the conversation right around the early 2000s with Kobe possibly flirting with the conversation. Now, this seems to go against all conventional wisdom since everyone in the gym yells “KOBE” during their triple-teamed fadeaways instead of Tim.\n\nMaybe that’s the point. Maybe our folk knowledge about Kobe has actually been off all this time. Maybe the incredible shots, the highlight dunks, the lockdown defense, and the insane work ethic stories are simply a smokescreen over an immensely talented player whose contributions required very specific personnel to win it all. Do I necessarily believe this? Maybe a tad, but as a whole, it undersells just how truly dominant Kobe was since the turn of the millennium.\n\nThat can only leave us with one conclusion then: Tim Duncan, with all things considered, was a greater player than Kobe Bryant.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nTony Manfred and Scott Davis, “22 examples of Kobe Bryant’s insane work ethic”\n\nJack Moore, “A Tribute to Tim Duncan’s ‘Uncool” Bank Shot”\n\nThe Onion, “Tim Duncan Offers To Do Taxes For Entire Spurs Team”\n\nESPN.com, “Kobe Bryant’s farewell tour”\n\nJohn Magalango, “Phil Jackson details clashes with Kobe Bryant”\n\nMark Medina, “Kobe Bryant riffs on Smush Parker, Kwame Brown, Jodie Meeks”\n\nESPN.com, “Kobe Bryant Says He’d Like to be Traded”\n\nTim Casey, “Tales of a Failed Big Three.”\n\nDuncan’s psychology article, “http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4757-9354-3_6”\n\nRob Perez, “Gregg Popovich opens up about Tim Duncan’s career during retirement press conference”\n\nFran Blinebury, “Givens in life: Death, taxes and the Spurs’ 50-win seasons”\n\nTom Scocca, “Who Was The Actual Best Player In The NBA Every Year During Kobe Bryant’s Career?”\n\nArticle length: about 1,600 words or 8-11 minutes of reading.\n\nI’m back. Though When MJ said those words, it may have meant more to the sport’s world than when I say it, but still, it feels good to return from my proverbial baseball sabbatical to write some more thrilling takes on the NBA.\n\nSince I last wrote an article, a lot has happened. Like a lot a lot starting from the beginning of the playoffs. Here’s my quick and dirty take on a couple of them:\n\n-Curry’s regular season was absolutely astounding and some have even called it the greatest offensive regular season in NBA history right next to Jordan in ‘88-89 and Wilt in ’61-62. Too bad he hasn’t been able to produce as well in the finals.\n\n-LeBron James is certainly happy about Curry’s lack of production in the finals, and he has fully inserted himself back into discussion about being the GOAT. Believe me, I still think that MJ is solidly the GOAT at the moment (and that Kareem still holds number two by a slight margin), but if LeBron can continue his string of Finals runs by maybe even one more, he leap frogs Kareem in my opinion. If he topples the revamped Warriors? Well scoot over MJ because you’re sharing the front seat. LeBron beating the 2016-2017 Warriors would be like David beating Goliath who takes the year to train with Rocky, infuse adamantium into his skeletal structure, and acquire Mjornir before David beats him again.\n\n-Kevin Durant to the Warriors? Are you actually kidding me? Everyone who is not excited about this is lying to you. This is the kind of absurdity that fans pull off in NBA 2K by taking control of the AI run teams and turning off the salary cap. We are literally seeing the greatest regular season team in history is adding one of the most complete players in the game who also boasts one of the most potent offensive games in NBA history. Whatever happens is going to be fun…as long as Curry and Durant’s injury history don’t catch up to them.\n\n-I’m really sick of superhero movies.\n\nThis penultimate point about Warrior’s super team opens up a relevant discussion about what it takes to construct a super team (please see the Universe Cup part 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for construction in practice) especially after Team USA’s struggle against a physical Australian team who held Team USA to 39% shooting versus their 50% shooting. We simply won based on the fact that we have some of the singularly most talented players in the world who helped give us a +10 advantage in three pointers made and a whopping +13 advantage in offensive rebounds..\n\nBut how? How can a team filled with the best talent in the world (sorta) struggle against a team with no discernable superstar? For a more philosophical twist on the discussion, check out my old post on talent and aesthetics in the sport. For a more theoretical approach aiming at team building, please continue reading.\n\nFirst, let’s break-down Team USA by position:\n\nGuards: Butler, DeRozan, Irving, Lowry, and Thompson\n\nForwards: Anthony, Barnes, Durant, George, and Green\n\nCenters: Cousins and Jordan\n\nThis is a big, strong team that plays no nonsense defense, cleans the glass like Windex, and can take anyone off the dribble. The team is noticeably missing any playmakers beyond Draymond Green and somewhat Kyle Lowry. That’s it. Durant has put up wonderful assist numbers for a forward and Thompson played within an unselfish offensive unit during the season, but ultimately, neither them nor anyone else on the team can do what LeBron, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Jason Kidd, or Deron Williams did for past Olympic teams. It’s not quite as easy as that because, as I cited above, many of the premier players in the league opted out of playing, but this team construction shows a blatant disregard for basic team structuring that has helped teams like the Spurs keep up their immense success for nearly two decades.\n\nSo let’s go ahead and look at some of the most successful teams in history and why their star power prevailed over others. Let’s look at the greatest teams of all time and see which groupings of superstars worked and why:\n\n1996-97 Chicago Bulls – Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman\n\n1986-1987 Boston Celtics – Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish (honorable mention of Bill Walton on the bench)\n\n2012-2013 Miami Heat – LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh\n\n2000-2002 Los Angeles Lakers – Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant\n\n1987-1988 Lost Angeles Lakers – Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy\n\n2015-2016 Golden State Warriors – Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson\n\n1971-1972 Lost Angeles Lakers – Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Elgin Baylor (sorta).\n\n1983-1984 Philadelphia 76ers – Moses Malone, Julius “The Dr.” Erving, and Andrew Tomey\n\n1997-2016 San Antonio Spurs – Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili (almost), and Tony Parker (almost)\n\nWhile this isn’t by any means a comprehensive list, this lays a solid groundwork for showing what is required to be the best for superstars to mesh: at least a dominant scorer, multiple excellent defenders, and multiple above average playmakers with one excellent playmaker. The biggest exception that stands out is the early 2000s Lakers who had possibly the most destructive post-season force in Shaq.\n\nBesides the obvious outlier that will always occur, the significant thing is that superstars that mesh MUST fulfill all of the aforementioned qualities. That’s why players like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Scottie Pippen, and Larry Bird are so historically great: they are phenomenal at multiple aspects of the game. With Pippen and Jordan, You have two of the historically greatest wing defenders, two of the greatest playmakers, and possibly the greatest scorer. With Wade and LeBron, you have two of the historically greatest playmakers, two of the greatest scorers, and two of the greatest defenders.\n\nHere’s the thing that everyone forgets about: the third star. This is where the 2015-2016 Cavaliers really show their weakness. If one or both of the other two superstars are prominent scorers, that third start NEEDS to be extremely effective without the ball which again leads to Benjamin Morris’ article on irreplaceability that simply states that basketball only has one ball on the court, so a team of George Gervin, Dominique Wilkins, and Allen Iverson wouldn’t be quite as effective as 2K would have you believe. With LeBron and Kyrie being the main superstars of the Cavs, you have LeBron who is a premier scorer, defender, and playmaker, and Kyrie who is a premier scorer. Kevin Love’s skillset also happens to be scoring with rebounding which if you have noticed, is not listed with the required skills. In theory, he stretches the floor for two players that create a lot of space, but he still needs the ball to be the 26-13 superstar in the making that he was in Minnesota.\n\nSo if the Cavaliers were my playground and I had free reign over any player to take Love’s spot, I would want a player that defends at a very high level and creates plays at a moderately good level, and a player who is preferably a big man. Let’s rank them by excellent matches to not-great-but-still-better-than-Love matches:\n\nExcellent: Draymond Green, Paul Millsap, and Kawhi Leonard,\n\nSolid: Derrick Favors and Tim Duncan (prime Tim would’ve been perfect)\n\nNot-great-but…: Al Horford and Dwight Howard\n\nThis isn’t a comprehensive list, but you get the idea. You know who didn’t fully grasp the idea? Whoever the hell constructed this year’s Olympic squad. Sure, we have the some of the best players in the game, but it seems like we chose players strictly off merit instead of who fits the best which is a whole different debate. I fall squarely on the side that we need to make a team that will mesh well. The current team has defenders that stretch to next Tuesday, a couple of great scorers, and a transcendent scorer, but we only have one above average to great playmaker in Green. This is unacceptable.\n\nTruth be told, I have to be fair to the selection committee because between injuries and players dropping out of contention, they weren’t left with the most ideal squad. The only players that they actually cut are as follows: Michael Conley, Kenneth Faried, Rudy Gay, Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala, and Kevin Love. Had it been my choice, I would have dropped Harrison Barnes and DeMar DeRozan for Conley and Iguodala. Conley provides a more traditional floor-general as a point guard who also boasts one of the better offensive and defensive IQs in the league. Iguodala skyrocketed to one of my favorite players in the league this past year by making himself one of the most valuable players on the greatest regular season team in history while coming off the bench! That sort of selflessness along with his ability to lockdown the best players in the league and act as the de facto point guard without scoring the rock is priceless.\n\nTo summarize, the greatest NBA teams need to have their superstars exhibit these abilities: At least one but not all three must be an excellent scorer, at least two need to be excellent defenders, and at least two need to be above average playmakers (with bonus points to those who are excellent playmakers). Team USA’s 2016 Olympic team doesn’t quite embody that theory and instead opted for multiple players who are most successful in isolation. Because of our sheer skill level, we will still win the gold medal in the Olympics, but as Australia showed us, we are not invincible.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDieter Kurtenbach, “Stephen Curry just finished the greatest individual regular season in NBA history”\n\nKen Berger, “Curry deserves LeBron-like criticism after laying another Finals egg”\n\nKirk Goldsberry, “True Value: Breaking Down Kevin Durant’s Past, Present, and Future”\n\nJoe Barnathan, “Why Elgin Baylor Is an NBA Champion”\n\nAllThatAmar, “Rio Olympics 2016: Team USA Basketball Final Roster and analysis”\n\nMike Prada, “The 7 ways to understand Mike Conley’s brilliance”\n\nZito Madu, “Andre Iguodala is the superhero the Warriors don’t need until they do”\n\nCody Houdek, “The Universe Cup” Part One through Five\n\nCody Houdek, “Aesthetics, Metaphysics, ‘The Matrix,’ and the NBA”\n\nArticle length: about 1,500 words or 7-12 minutes of reading.\n\nBefore I really dive into this newest installment, I’m going to take this moment to announce some slight changes to the actual posts on NBAcademic. Lately, my posts have been much longer than I intended which A) emulates the not-so-great side of the (RIP) Grantland articles which makes people lose interest quickly, and B) sucks up an immense amount of my time (not that I would rather do anything than glorified NBA fan fiction for a living). Because of these two reasons along with the fact that I truly do plan on writing an a book on defining the greatest player of all time, I hope to significantly shorten up my posts. Whether or not I will be successful in stifling my propensity to ramble about basketball is yet to be determined.\n\nThis final post before the end of the regular season deals with building a new hypothetical team (with much less detail) with some new rules. The construction of this 12-man roster must adhere to the following rules: 1) players are selected based on their 2015-16 performance, 2) the team’s salary cap CANNOT exceed 84.7 million dollars (the soft cap is 70 million, but I’m using the luxury tax cutoff to give myself some more leeway. If this really pisses you off, we can certainly discuss it), 3) all player salaries will be rounded to the nearest $100,000, and finally 4) only one rookie contract on the team.\n\nI toyed around with the team a bit, and more than anything, I decided on players that can either shoot threes, handle versatile duties, or defend at an elite level. Below are the players I selected along with their respective salaries (in millions).\n\nGuards:\n\nStephen Curry – 11.4\n\nJJ Redick – 6.9\n\nAvery Bradley – 7.7\n\nJJ Barrea – 4\n\nPatty Mills – 3.6\n\nForwards:\n\nLeBron James – 23\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo – 2* (Rookie Contract)\n\nJae Crowder – 6\n\nDirk Nowitzki – 8.3\n\nCenters:\n\nTim Duncan – 5\n\nHassan Whiteside – 1\n\nIan Mahimi – 4\n\nWhen I was making the team, I also wanted to as closely copy the Warriors’ roster style as I could. Think of the players in this way: Curry=Curry, Thompson=Redick, Barnes=Crowder, Green=LeBron; Giannis, Bogut=Duncan. When viewed through that lens, a lineup with those five should be absolutely devastating because everyone on this team improves upon (or nearly so) the skill of the player they are replacing (with the exception of Thompson vs. Redick possibly).\n\nThe obvious top choice for my team here is Steph Curry because he is both the best player in the NBA right now (though LeBron and Durant are very closely nipping at his feet), and he is paid a criminally low salary (with respect to other NBA players of course). You could literally pay for two Currys on your team for the price of one LeBron! That opens up some flexibility in signing a huge contract player, much like LeBron.\n\nHonestly, I think LeBron and Curry’s play-styles complement each other perfectly. LeBron is a willing and passer who loves surrounding himself with 3-point shooters (see Ray Allen, JR Smith, Kyrie Irving, Shane Battier, Daniel Gibson), and relishes in getting players open three-point shots. Imagine the opportunities that LeBron would get in the typical Curry/Green pick-and-rolls that result in 4 vs. 3 scenarios.\n\nhttp://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/11/8/9693292/lebron-james-showed-off-his-x-ray-vision-by-throwing-a-one-handed\n\nA one-handed, offhand (sorta) lob pass for the corner three. Brilliant.\n\nLet’s watch some more of his passing brilliance.\n\nBoth Crowder and Bradley bring that Brad Stevens coached Celtics toughness that I so respect. Crowder is a strong, quick-handed beast of a defender with very high defensive IQ. Not only does he rack up tons of steals, but he also forces them. Bradley handles defense with a different skillset which mostly includes incredible athleticism, lightning fast lateral quickness, and exceptional timing. Bradley is without question one of the pestiest defenders in the league with his ability to latch onto a player and chase him through a network of screens. This article nicely describes a game-study of Bradley and Crowder’s defensive effects. If you have the time and/or the resources, go back and watch the Warriors/Celtics game that Boston won. Bradley showcases his lockdown D brilliantly. A final note about both of these Celtics players is that both are very reliable three-point shooters, and 3-D guys around LeBron are extremely valuable.\n\nOne of my favorite defensive plays ever.\n\nYes, Tim Duncan is old, and yes, he is not the player that he used to be, but at the end of the day, he is anchoring one of the greatest defensive teams in history and is leading the league in Defensive Box Plus Minus (just ahead of Gobert, Millsap, Draymond, and Jordan). Now how does he still manage this? Well I don’t like to hyperbolize, but in my opinion, Duncan has one of the top-5 Defensive IQs in NBA history (which also includes some list of MJ, Pippen, Payton, Rodman, Russell, and Wallace) which he uses to never be out of position on a defensive play. Seriously watch the man rotate around and cover for his teammates. He is always right where he is supposed to be. That’s the only reasonable way to be an effective defender at 90 years old.\n\nGiannis ends up coming off the bench for this team because, as I expressed above, I think Crowder complements the starting lineup better. Crowder allows for better spacing and is excellent without the ball in his hands (this is a friendly remind to read Benjamin Morris’ “The Hidden Value of the NBA Steal”). While Giannis is a freakishly bothersome defender because of his length, his IQ on that end of the court has not caught up to his body, much like that gangly 7th grader on the court who bounds around like an injured gazelle. Also, Giannis is tremendous with the ball in his hands and would play the Draymond position well which are the two things LeBron thrives it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely going to run the Giannis/LeBron lineup to see the most devastating fastbreak combination since, well ever.\n\nNow imagine them on the same team…..I’m not going to choose which is better by the way.\n\nBecause I want Duncan starting and I know that he will probably need his rest, I needed solid backup centers that could spell him when the time came. Whiteside perfectly slipped into that 6th man role this year, and as the season has progressed, he has grown in maturity, IQ, and general skills. He may be a black-hole in the post, but when you’re shooting over 60% from the field, sometimes passing seems like a poor decision. Either way, he stretches the floor moderately well, blocks shots with timing that rivals Ben Wallace’s, and puts shots back with fierce intensity.\n\nDirk is my biggest gamble on the team. All-in-all, he’s a great guy that easily meshes with any roster and would happily accept any role. He continues to be the most important cog in a moderately successful Mavericks team despite being 37-years-old. He’s averaging 20 PPG while providing the typical spacing that has made him so dangerous through the years. He has lost a step when playing defense and while driving to the bucket, but with the right lineups, both of those issues can easily be hidden.\n\nAs for Mahimi, Mills, and Barrea, these are three players that more or less will sparingly get playing time. They all solidly fill a role where they don’t have to do much besides rebound, shoot threes, or bring a general amount of toughness. I trust any one of them out on the court, so if the injury bug ever strikes, they could seamlessly move into the rotations without screwing up the flow the team had.\n\nJust so that I squash a criticism before somebody brings it up, I left Damian Lillard’s absurdly low 4.2 million dollar rookie contract off the team for three reasons: 1) I’m greatly intrigued by Giannis’ flexibility and play style especially when combined with LeBron, 2) with Curry and LeBron on the team, Lillard would be the third offensive options, and I don’t know how well he would function with not being the primary ballhandler, and 3) he’s one of the worst defenders in the league. Seriously, Harden gets an unbelievable amount of criticism for his lackluster effort, but Lillard is miles worse. I don’t want to make the same mistake Cleveland made by pairing LeBron with two subpar superstar defenders (though, I have to admit, Curry has made great improvements this year).\n\nThink you can make a better team using the 84.7 million dollar cap? Let me know by hitting me up on any one of my forms of social media. I’m not particularly active on any of them (another change that needs to occur), but I promise that I will respond.\n\nCitations:\n\nWilliams, Jared “Defending Basketball’s Best Play: The Steph/Draymond Pick and Roll”\n\nWesterholm, Tom “Boston Celtics analysis: Jae Crowder, Avery Bradley, perimeter defense shut down Washington Wizards”\n\nMorris, Benjamin, “The Hidden Value of the NBA Steal”\n\nNathan, Alec “The Case for Hassan Whiteside as the NBA’s Most Improved Player”"
