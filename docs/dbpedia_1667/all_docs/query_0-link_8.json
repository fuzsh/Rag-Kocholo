        "text": "William Sallaz/Getty Images\n\n11. Milwaukee Bucks: Eric Snow\n\nEric Snow was a solid facilitator and a committed defender whoranks third in assists and fourth in steals among 1995 picks. But it'd be a gross understatement to call his scoring a weakness. Of the 331 players to debut since 1990 and attempt at least 5,000 shots in their careers, Snow ranks322nd in true shooting percentage.\n\nIt'll be a long time before we see another point guard attempt53.7 percent of his shots from 10-23 feet—or start 551 games with a 20.8 percent hit rate on threes.\n\nBut as proof that there's more to the game than scoring efficiently, Snow's teams were almost alwaysbetter with him on the floor.\n\n12. Dallas Mavericks: Corliss Williamson\n\n\"Never Scoreless\" Corliss Williamson averaged 17.6 points per 36 minutes in his 12-year career, spending time as a starter with the late-'90s Kings and then transitioning into a (high-scoring) reserve role with the Pistons in the early 2000s.\n\nA decent rebounder but a consistent defensive negative, Williamson checks in at No. 12 among 1995 draftees with 34.7 win shares and is one of onlyeight players in this class to record a 40-point game.\n\n13. Sacramento Kings: Travis Best\n\nThis draft is remarkably short on ball-handlers who could shoot, which is why Travis Best, a backup for the vast majority of his career, moves up 10 spots from his original position to land at No. 13. He and Stoudamire are theonly point guards picked in 1995 with at least 5,000 points, 2,000 assists and a three-point percentage north of 34.0 percent.\n\nBest was a bench mainstay on several late-'90s Pacers teams that made deep playoff runs, and he had three years in which he hit better than 37.0 percent from deep. He's alsofirst in steal rate in this class among guys who saw action in at least 500 games.\n\nThat's enough two-way value to justify a significant climb up the draft order.\n\n14. Boston Celtics: Fred Hoiberg\n\nAmong high-volume three-point shooters, which we'll define as players who got up at least 500 career threes, only Barry tops Fred Hoiberg's 39.6 percent conversion rate. Though he never scored more than the 9.1 points per game he averaged in 2000-01 with the Bulls, Hoiberg definitely went out on top, calling it a career after leading the league with a ridiculous 48.3 percent long-range accuracy mark in 2004-05.\n\nBonus: His 115 wins as a head coach give him 115 more than anyone else drafted in his class.\n\nJOHN MOTTERN/Getty Images\n\n15. Denver Nuggets: Bob Sura\n\nWhen Bob Sura could get his shot to fall, he performed like a low-end starter, which is saying something now that we've exited the lottery portion of the re-draft. For example, his 1999-00 season with the Cavs, one of just three years in which the combo guard posted a true shooting percentage above the league average, was worth 4.9 win shares, a figure that ranked in the top 100 leaguewide.\n\nA 6'5\" combo guard who had some serious explosion in his younger years, Sura was also a flashy passer who played with noticeable swagger. Despite starting less than a third of his 657 career games, he managed to post four 20-point, 10-assist efforts—fifth-most in the class.\n\n16. Atlanta Hawks: Bryant Reeves\n\nBig Country came off the board at No. 6 in 1995, and if not for a career marred by injury, the plodding-but-skilled center might have retained that spot here. Weight issues and back trouble struck in his fourth season. But prior to that, Reeves looked the part of a lottery talent.\n\nIn his first three years, he averaged 15.2 points and 7.8 rebounds, ranking seventh and second in the class to that point, respectively. He's the last man off the board in our re-draft with a 40-point game on his resume, but it's not fair to slot him any higher in light of a career that only spanned six seasons.\n\n17. Cleveland Cavaliers: Gary Trent\n\nA burly combo forward with a real knack for scoring against second units, Gary Trent is fifth in the 1995 class (among players with at least 500 career games) with an average of 15.9 points per 36 minutes. He's also one of just seven guys from that same sample to post a career effective field-goal percentage above 50.0 percent.\n\nNever much of a defender, Trent was a forceful finisher who powered his way to close range often and finished at a 66.2 percent clip inside three feet. He's also the only 1995 selection with a son currently on an NBA roster.\n\n18. Detroit Pistons: Alan Henderson\n\nAlan Henderson scored 14.3 points per game with a 53.4 true shooting percentage in 1997-98, his third (and best) NBA season. The 6'9\" power forward won Most Improved Player that year but couldn't quite sustain the baseline he set going forward.\n\nThough he'd average double-digit points in the next three seasons, his scoring efficiency dipped below the league average until a late-career rejuvenation. He got his true shooting percentage back above the league average in each of his final three years, splitting them between the Mavericks, Cavs and Sixers.\n\n19. Detroit Pistons: Greg Ostertag\n\nIf you close your eyes, you can still see Greg Ostertag bracing himself for Shaquille O'Neal to take a power dribble and hit him in the chest with that battering ram of a left shoulder. Ostertag, listed at 7'2\" and 280 pounds, took plenty of punishment from Shaq and the West's other hefty bigs during the Utah Jazz's many deep playoff runs in the late 1990s, none of which resulted in a ring.\n\nMichael Jordan was waiting for them both times they reached the Finals.\n\nThat a player of Ostertag's size shot under 50.0 percent from two-point range for his career tells you everything you need to know about his (lack of) offensive impact. But those Jazz teams were excellent, and they trusted Ostertag to play a significant role in meaningful games.\n\n20. Chicago Bulls: Eric Williams\n\nA better scorer than you remember, Eric Williams was one of just 11 picks from 1995 to average at least 10.0 points per game as a rookie. He followed that up with a jump to 15.0 in his second season. After a trade to Denver (thanks to Celtics head coach Rick Pitino's ill-advised housecleaning), Williams got off to a hot start, averaging 19.8 points per game.\n\nSadly, a torn ACL ended what looked like a breakout campaign after just four games. The 6'8\" wing was never the same after that, though he hung around for a total of 12 seasons and 658 career games.\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\n21. Phoenix Suns: Tyus Edney\n\nThis may seem high for a player who logged just 226 games over four NBA seasons. But Tyus Edney's peak, which came in his rookie year, was good enough to warrant this slot.\n\nAfter running the show for the national champion UCLA Bruins, Edney averaged 10.8 points and 6.1 assists while shooting 36.8 percent from three in 80 games (60 starts) for the Sacramento Kings. His role and production would diminish from that point on, but there were only a dozen seasons of at least 10.0 points and 6.0 assists produced by this entire class—and only four featured three-point shooting as accurate as Edney's.\n\nNobody would have guessed it on draft night, but Edney had the most NBA success among players from that 1994-95 Bruins squad...unless you count current Warriors general manager Bob Myers.\n\n22. Charlotte Hornets: Andrew DeClercq\n\nDeClercq, a 6'10\" center, would only stick with the Dubs for two seasons before landing in Boston for the 1997-98 campaign. He spent the bulk of his time with the Magic, for whom he played his final five NBA seasons, often as a starter.\n\n23. Indiana Pacers: Jason Caffey\n\nAmong the first NBA players to sport the spider web-on-the-elbow tattoo, Jason Caffey was a 6'8\" power forward who did his best work with the Warriors during the 1999-00 season, the only campaign in which he started more than 50 games.\n\nHe averaged 12.0 points and 6.8 boards that season (not bad for a guy who finished his career at 7.3 points and 4.4 rebounds per game), and he turned in some truly impressive efforts for a horrendous Dubs team that needed production wherever it could find it.\n\nCaffey's best game came in his first Warriors season following a mid-year trade from the champion Chicago Bulls. He hung 28 points, 12 boards, three assists and two steals on the Phoenix Suns in an April 13, 1998 loss, providing hope that, somehow, Golden State had stolen a gem from the mighty Bulls.\n\nTurns out, not so much.\n\n24. Dallas Mavericks: Kevin Ollie\n\nIt took a while, but we've finally got our first undrafted player.\n\nKevin Ollie was a game-managing point guard who coaches from 11 different NBA teams trusted to run the second- and third-unit offense. Though he averaged just 3.8 points and 2.3 assists for his career, his 662 games rank 15th in the class. He's proof that absent dynamic production, a steady hand that doesn't make mistakes is sometimes enough to prolong a career.\n\n25. Orlando Magic: Cherokee Parks\n\nA national champ as a freshman at Duke, Cherokee Parks didn't live up to his original No. 12 draft slot, but he hung around for nine seasons, which is quite an achievement this late in the re-draft first round.\n\nHis best year came in 1997-98 when he started 43 of the 79 games he played, averaging 7.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 21.6 minutes per contest.\n\nIt's a shame the 6'11\" big man bagged his three-point shot after a rookie year in which 10.5 percent of his attempts came from beyond the arc. Parks was just 7-of-26 on treys that season, but he was consistently solid on long twos and might have added a rare spacing dimension if he'd been encouraged to stretch the floor a bit more.\n\n26. Seattle SuperSonics: Matt Maloney\n\nOur second and final undrafted player, Matt Maloney gets into the first round entirely on the strength of his first two seasons with the Houston Rockets. From 1996-97 to 1997-98, the point guard played and started 160 total games. And as a rookie, he shot a blistering 40.4 percent on threes and also started all 16 playoff games for a Rockets team that reached the conference finals.\n\nHis days as a difference-maker were effectively done by 1999, but it's not easy to find a guy as battle-tested as Maloney (even if he wasn't in the fight for long) this late in the draft.\n\n27. Phoenix Suns: Don Reid\n\nHe couldn't score at all (3.6 points per game and 75.7 percent of his buckets were assisted), but Don Reid is one of just three players picked in 1995 with a career rebound rate above 12.0 percent and a block rate above 4.0 percent.\n\nAmong classmates who logged as many as Reid's eight seasons, he ranks fifth in win shares per 48 minutes. Though his contributions were inconspicuous unless you were scouring advanced metrics over two decades ago, the hard-working 6'8\" power forward made a real impact in limited playing time off the bench.\n\n28. Utah Jazz: Cory Alexander\n\nA useful three-point specialist and facilitator during the first three years of his career, Cory Alexander teased the league by averaging 14.0 points, 6.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds in 23 games following a mid-year move to the Denver Nuggets once he was waived by the San Antonio Spurs in 1998. He played over his head during that brief stretch and lost his long-range stroke the following season.\n\nStill, the point guard shot at least 37.3 percent from distance in each of his first three seasons and is one of only 20 picks from 1995 to finish his career with a positive VORP.\n\n29. San Antonio Spurs: Chris Carr\n\nDon't feel bad for Chris Carr, a six-year vet who barely scrapes his way into the first round. He went 56th overall to the Suns in the real draft, so this is a significant leap for the bouncy 6'5\" wing.\n\nCarr couldn't dribble or pass (310 career turnovers to 294 assists), but he was a streaky three-point shooter on the catch and baptized more than his share of victims with high-rising dunks. He was also the runner-up to Kobe Bryant in the 1997 Dunk Contest.\n\nIt feels right to close out this re-draft with a sweet lob from Garnett, our first pick, to Carr, our last.\n\nStats courtesy of Basketball Reference unless otherwise noted."
