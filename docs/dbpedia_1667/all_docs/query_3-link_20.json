        "text": "Article length: about 3,000 words (the second longest post behind this one)\n\nThis is it! The final section of a seven part series! Don’t quit on me now. Dig deep and find that dark place that helps you push to a new height. Do it! Go back and read part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4, part 5, and part 6. It’s a lot of reading, I know, but you’ll hopefully find some mild entertainment.\n\nJust to make things easier, here’s the complete roster along with each player’s skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Mike Conley 8 7 7 4 Deron Williams 9 6 4 4 Ray Allen 6 7 5 5 Klay Thompson 4 8 7 4 Manu Ginobili 7 7 7 5 Paul George 5 6 8 6 Peja Stojakovic 6 8 4 6 Shawn Marion 3 6 9 8 Draymond Green 8 4 10 6 Ben Wallace 2 1 10 9 Yao Ming 4 7 8 8 Giannis Antetokounmpo 7 7 8 7\n\nSince this piece has three parts, I’m going to split it into two sections by combining the coach selection and team strategy because I believe that they go hand-in-hand. Then, once the strategy is spelled out, I’ll explain why certain players didn’t make the team in the context of the strategy.\n\nReady? Ready.\n\nCoach/Strategy\n\nSince I have to choose a coach that has not won Coach of the Year, my pool of extremely talented coaches is limited. I narrowed it down to two, and those two do NOT include the legendary Jerry Sloan (who definitely deserved CotY at one point or another) because of his curmudgeonly demeanor, his “my way or the highway” attitude, his old-school play style, and his war with Deron Williams. Look, Sloan was an incredible coach, and I wish him all the best with his current health, but I need someone who is going to manage personalities better, promote a more free-flowing offense, and have players shoot more threes. Personally, I think Sloan’s style stymied the likes of canonball players like Kirilenko, but that’s another conversation for another day.\n\nMy two coaches come down to Brad Stevens and Rick Adelman, and ultimately, I’m going with Stevens. Adelman coached two Portland teams to the NBA Finals (1990, 1992) and Portland and Sacremento to two Conference Finals (1991, 2002 respectively), and was described as a real player’s coach. So why not go with Adelman? Simple: I’m biased.\n\nUSA Today\n\nI’m biased towards more recent coaches because the last six or so NBA seasons has created a (semi) position-less and three-point revolution. Stevens has embraced this new NBA, and beyond that, the Celtics have embraced him as their leader. Just look at how Jae Crowder and Isaiah Thomas revitalized their careers in Boston. That’s not a coincidence; that’s a buy in. Part of that has to do with his players loving to play with him, and part of it is his focus on fundamentals, team-oriented basketball, and defense. Perfect. Sign the man up.\n\nSo let’s talk strategy.\n\nSince we’re dealing with an 82-game season, I want to establish some consistency so that there’s no guesswork game-to-game. We’ll definitely change up lineups once in a while, but in general, here’s who I imagine being in the starting lineup.\n\nStarters:\n\nMike Conley, Ray Allen, Paul George, Draymond Green, and Ben Wallace\n\nNBA.com\n\nDEFENSE!! This lineup is just stupid defensively. Ray Allen is by far the worst defender, and honestly, he’s not that bad. I fiddled around with Draymond and Ben starting together, but that defensive flexibility was too enticing for me to pass up. Both can switch out on a pick-and-roll (Draymond doing so on an elite level), and both can protect the rim better than most. Ben isn’t going to provide any offense (besides offensive boards), and Draymond won’t be that dangerous scoring-wise, but he is a tremendous facilitator, and can’t be left open from three.\n\nAll three of Mike Conley, Paul George, and Ray Allen can stretch the floor at an elite level. Paul George ranked in the 84th percentile in spot-up threes and Conley ranked in the 90th percentile. This shooting data doesn’t exist for 2001, but I’m sure Allen would be right around those numbers as well at an even higher volume. Ultimately, scoring for this unit will heavily come from these three.\n\nI don’t want to step on Stevens’ toes with setting up minutes, so I’ll just talk through my favorite lineup possibilities (this will seem very familiar if you’ve read Bill Simmons’ book).\n\nMost Unselfish Passing:\n\nMike Conley (maybe Deron), Manu Ginobili, Peja Stojakovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Draymond Green.\n\nInside Hoops\n\nThis is just brilliant. The only player who might hold the ball for too long is Giannis, but after a few reps, he’d assimilate perfectly with this group. Peja is the only middling defender, but he, Giannis, and Draymond could seamlessly switch.\n\nSpacing:\n\nDeron Williams (or Conley), Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, Peja Stojakovic, and Draymond Green.\n\nAre you seeing why I’m giddy about Draymond? Dude fits into pretty much any kind of lineup. This lineup definitely sacrifices defense with Deron, Ray, and Peja, but it’s offensive potency is off the chart. Just give the ball to Deron, have Ray, Peja, and Klay run through screen, and have Draymond set some picks. The other team is forced to defend the three-point line 1-5. Poor defenders would be exposed quickly.\n\nDefensive Nightmare (my favorite option):\n\nGiannis, George, Marion, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nI’m speechless. Here, we run point-Giannis with George helping out a bit, and the rest is just free-form. Would the offense be ugly? Definitely, but the defense would be stifling. 1-5 could legitimately switch better than any other lineup in history. Even the 2017 Warriors might struggle to score against them.\n\nAlso, since 2000, the 2012 Thunder have averaged the most blocks per game at 8.2. This single lineup averages 8.2 blocks per game…\n\nFast-break\n\nWilliams, Klay, Marion, Giannis, Draymond\n\nAny of the five can bring the ball up, Deron can facilitate, Giannis and Marion are relentless, and Klay can’t be left alone. Good luck keeping up with this.\n\nKeep a Lead With a Minute Left\n\nConley, Manu, Ray, Peja, and Yao.\n\nConley has the lowest free-throw percentage with 86%. Good luck (have I said this for every lineup so far? Weird).\n\nThese lineups are all fine and dandy, but if I’m preparing for anything, can I pull together a lineup that can stand against the best lineups in history? Let’s take a look.\n\n2017 Warriors (Curry, Klay, Iggy, Durant, and Draymond)\n\nI mean, why not start off with the best lineup ever?\n\nConley, Klay, Giannis, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nJesus, that Warriors lineup still might be better! The only reason I put in Wallace instead of Marion is I need to expose the Warriors’ only weakness: rebounding. Wallace would punish them on missed shots, and that might be the only way to expose them. All five of them can switch well enough with Conley’s size being the only issue.\n\n2001 Lakers (Fisher, Kobe, Fox, Horry, and Shaq)\n\nConley, Klay, George, Peja, and Wallace (or Yao)\n\nThe Hoop Doctors\n\nThis is a much easier lineup to handle because my main concerns are 1) make sure my guards can make Kobe’s life hell and 2) slow down Shaq as much as possible. Wallace is one of the only players to effectively guard him, and if that doesn’t work out, Yao is one of the other players to effectively guard him. The rest of the lineup’s offensive firepower would be too much, and Shaq can’t switch against four of the five players.\n\n2013 Heat (Chalmers, Wade, Battier, LeBron, and Bosh)\n\nConley, Ginobili, George, Marion, and Wallace\n\nonehotseason.com\n\nThe Heat were an excellent trapping defense, so it’s important to have multiple ball-handlers on the court. Both Marion and George have had mild success guarding LeBron, and since both Wade and LeBron thrive off scoring in the point, having Wallace as the last line of defense is essential. Plus, Marion and Wallace will absolutely punish the Heat on the boards.\n\n1986 Celtics (Johnson, Ainge, Bird, McHale, Parish)\n\nWilliams, Klay, George, Draymond, and Yao.\n\nPinterest\n\nThis is a really tough lineup to defend. They passed the ball effortlessly, destroyed teams in the paint, and were lead by apex Bird. I opted for Williams over Conley because Conley might just be too small to be that effective defensively. Williams wouldn’t be posted up that easily. Yao would thrive in this situation because neither McHale nor Parish could stretch out to shoot a three. All of Klay, George, and Draymond could switch onto Bird and bother him.\n\n1996 Bulls (Harper/Kerr, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, and Longley)\n\nDeron, Klay, George, Draymond, and Wallace.\n\nneoGAF\n\nI really like my chances against the GOAT’s best team. Jackson’s Triangle Offense usually works best with big guards, like Jordan and Harper, so having Williams over Conley is important because Williams won’t get bullied around. George, Klay, and Draymond all can switch onto either Jordan and Pippen while making their lives a bit more difficult. Wallace is one of the best options for curbing Rodman’s otherworldly rebounding. Also, what are the odds of Draymond, Rodman, and Wallace starting Malice in the Palace part two?\n\n1987 Lakers (Magic, Scott, Green, Worthy, and Kareem)\n\nGinobili, George, Peja, Draymond, and Wallace\n\nRantSports\n\nThis Lakers lineup doesn’t resemble any modern lineup because 1) they made a total of 74 three-pointers in this year (Scott made 65 of those) and 2) they have a classic “dinosaur” center in Kareem who is way past his prime; however, their position-less flexibility between Green, Magic, and Worthy made them formidable on defense especially with Kareem lurking in the back.\n\nTo counter this, I opted with Manu for a bit more craftiness than Williams, and I picked Peja because he doesn’t have to worry about chasing too many guards on the perimeter. As documented in “Airplane,” Kareem didn’t work that hard on defense later in his career, and I think Kareem couldn’t contain Wallace on the boards while causing problems with their paint-heavy offense.\n\n1983 Sixers (Cheeks, Toney, Dr. J, Iavoroni, and Moses)\n\nWilliams, Allen, Giannis, Draymond, and Yao\n\nivanjordanproductions.weebly.com\n\nWhy not Wallace over Yao? Because I want to take advantage of any deficiencies that Moses has on defense. Yao will force him to work on the side of the ball that he struggles with the most: defense. Wallace would help mitigate his offensive rebounding numbers, but I think it’s more pertinent to have him deal with an offensive force in the post.\n\nAs for Dr. J, both Giannis and Draymond will match his length and strength. Both can dare the Doctor to shoot jumpshots while making any drives, his preferred method of scoring, strenuous.\n\nFrom these teams, I wanted to show that the roster we have built is prepared to face any sort of roster. With all of the two-way forwards, we’re best prepared to face modern offenses that are predicated on three-pointers and driving, but we’re still prepared for anything….\n\nBut what about the players who were cut? Could we beat a team of players scorned? If we were to build a team using Team USA’s strategy, we would just take the best players regardless of fit. Could a team of players scorned beat us? The twelve-man roster (which I’m constructing with significantly less thought) is as follows:\n\nGuards: John Wall (2017), Kyle Lowry (2016), Jimmy Butler (2017), Brandon Roy (2009), Vince Carter (2001)\n\nForwards: Carmelo Anthony (2014), Andrei Kirilenko (2004), Blake Griffin (2014), Paul Millsap (2016), Gordon Hayward (2017)\n\nCenters: Rudy Gobert (2017), Marcus Camby (2008)\n\nTo some folks, this might actually look like a better team than the one that we’ve built. I agree that this team has more offensive talent, but it would struggle with spacing issues and personality issues (especially alpha status between Butler, Roy, Carter, Wall, and Melo). Let’s pretend that their coach Rick Adelman makes them all like each other. How does our team match up? Well this team’s best lineup, in my opinion, is as follows:\n\nWall, Butler, Hayward, Anthony, and Kirilenko (or Gobert).\n\nSole Collector\n\nThis lineup can easily catch fire, and their individual offensive talent is off-the-charts. Plus, Butler, Hawyard, and Kirilenko (kinda Melo) can switch on defense and cause a bit of mayhem. All five players are comfortable bringing the ball up especially on the break, and they all must be defended for spot-up shots (though you can definitely give up that shot to Wall, Butler, and Kirilenko). So to counter this, I would toss out the following:\n\nConley, Ginobili, Allen, George, and Draymond\n\nFight small ball with small ball. In a single game situation, the other team might beat us once in a while, but I’ve constructed the team to last 82 games plus a playoffs. I’m rolling with our guys.\n\nTo finally cap off everything, I’m going to go through some of the players that I cut and briefly (I’ll try) defend why I cut them. Here it goes.\n\nDefending My Cuts\n\nCarmelo Anthony 2014\n\nI’ve never been a huge believer in Melo. He’s been to the Conference Finals once, shown a poor attitude (like when he refused to sub out of a game in Denver), doesn’t defend particularly well, and he isn’t a willing passer. He’s a transcendent scorer, but I value that less than other attributes.\n\nBlake Griffin 2014\n\nFull disclosure: Blake was on the team until I started writing this. He’s a tremendous passer and a dominant scorer and rebounder. His perimeter defense is actually underrated, and his jumpshot is serviceable. Unfortunately, I think he’s most effective with the ball in his hands, and I wanted to move away from players like that. With the smaller roster, Blake would probably be pushed into the center position, but I can’t have a center that can’t defend the rim (for reference, Blake ranks between Channing Frye and Enes Kanter here. Not great company).\n\nJimmy Butler 2017\n\nThe savior of Chicago this past year, Jimmy exploded as an incredible two-way player. Unfortunately his alpha complex pissed of Rose and Noah a few years ago, and his three-point shooting isn’t enough to be a reliable spot-up man. He can score and facilitate, but like Griffin, he needs the ball. It’s a shame because we could’ve used his defense.\n\nJohn Wall 2017\n\nSimply put, Wall’s half-court scoring ability is atrocious. He’s dominant on the fastbreak, and he passes as well as anyone, but he can’t reliably score with the game on the line (side note: I’m not a big fan of judging a player off one game, but this article does a good job of summing up my concerns). He shot 34% on open and wide open threes last year. Plus, he’s had some personality issues with people throughout the years.\n\nKyle Lowry 2016\n\nYou know that one restaurant that consistently has great food? I mean, that place where you walk in with some buddies, order an appetizer, and everyone is fighting over the last piece of it? Then, when the meal comes, conversations are curbed and replaced by your friends Instagramming the food, loud and constant “MMMMs,” and the the repetition of the phrase, “We have to come back here!” It’s been a great meal, so you all dive in on a dessert, one of those big ones that everyone shares with a fork. Silver slices delicate chocolate/apple/milky goodness, and you plop it in your mouth. Pause. You all look nervously at one another. Chewing slows down, and at least one person conspicuously lifts a napkin to their lips. The dessert is chalky/bitter/undercooked/eggy/ bland. It literally wipes the delicious taste of your entree from your mouth, and you’re forced to stop at a local doughnut shop on the way home to avoid this agonizing experience. That’s Kyle Lowry’s regular season and post-season in a nutshell.\n\nBrandon Roy 2009\n\nLook, I love Brandon Roy. He’s unnervingly clutch, led the second best offensive team in 2009, and garnered the following praise from Kobe Bryant:\n\nKobe Bryant was asked who the toughest player for him to guard in the Western Conference on the John Thompson Show the other day. This was Kobe’s response:\n\n“Roy 365 days, seven days a week. Roy has no weaknesses in his game.”\n\n– Ryne Nelson, “Kobe Bryant: Roy over Durant,” 2010\n\nThe issue with Roy is that his game isn’t suited for a star-studded, egalitarian basketball team. Like Jimmy Butler (and, appropriately, Kobe), Roy dominated with the ball in his hands with a series of step-backs, pull-ups, and drives. He facilitated at a solid level, but not at a game-changing level.\n\nVince Carter 2001\n\nHere’s an excerpt of misdeeds Carter committed against Toronto:\n\n(a) his being accused in the Tacoma News Tribune of tipping off the Seattle SuperSonics about the Raptors’ plays — a month before he stopped playing for Toronto; (b) distorting his face in derision and mocking the Air Canada Centre crowd for chanting “MVP” at Chris Bosh during a Raps-Nets game this season; and, worst of all, (c) telling broadcaster John Thompson he didn’t push himself as hard as he could have when he worked and lived north of the border.\n\n– Adam Proteau, “How Our Love for Vince Carter Turned to Hate,” 2007\n\nNot cool with any of that. Sorry Vince.\n\nKyrie Irving 2017\n\nI fought with this one for a while because of his Finals experience and nearly unprecedented isolation scoring ability, but he’s not a willing passer, possibly doesn’t put winning first, is one of the worst defenders in the leauge, and, according to NBAWOWY data, hasn’t led the Cavs to a positive On/Off differential without LeBron on the court with him. In short: I think Kyrie is extremely overrated.\n\nRudy Gobert 2017\n\nHaving Gobert back up Wallace would’ve been an immovable defensive choice, but his injury in the first round of the playoffs concerns me. Also, he doesn’t have the intangible leadership abilities of Yao.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko 2004\n\nKirilenko was a superstar, and I strongly believe that a combination of injuries and Jerry Sloan’s coaching style stifled an illustrious career. He played 13 years too early, for his defensive switching ability might rival Draymond’s. I ultimately went with Giannis over him because they were the same age (using AK47’s 2004 season), and I wanted somebody who was more dominant on the break. I still kind of regret not bumping someone else for AK47…\n\nFor now, that’s a good enough list of players and why they didn’t make the team. If you’re just dying to know why I cut 2007 Josh Smith or 2005 Elton Brand, please tweet at me, comment on this post, or hit me up on Facebook.\n\nThat’s it! You have stuck with this series through thick and thin. I’m sure you’ve disagreed with some things along the way, but I feel very comfortable with the team that we have constructed. After 10,000 some words, this still feels incomplete, so if I think of anything else, I’ll revisit the series at some point in the future.\n\nAs always, all stats from Basketball Reference, Stats.NBA, and NBAWOWY.\n\nArticle length: about 2,200 words.\n\nPlease check out part 1and part 2 to catch yourself up. So far, the team has Mike Conley, Ray Allen, and Draymond Green.\n\nI’m a big fan of what Boston has been doing this offseason with stockpiling forwards. Currently, after the recent Avery Bradley trade, they have Brown, Tatum, Hayward, Morris, and Crowder all of whom deserve ample playing time. Bleacher Report alludes to this in a recent interview with Stevens:\n\nThe new era of the NBA requires versatility to win, and the Boston Celtics are adjusting.\n\n“I don’t have the five positions anymore,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said, per Kareem Copeland of the Associated Press. “It may be as simple as three positions now, where you’re either a ball-handler, a wing or a big.\n\n“It’s really important. We’ve become more versatile as the years have gone on.”\n\n– Rob Goldberg, “Brad Stevens Says Celtics Have 3, Not 5, Positions Now,” 2017\n\nEven though he’s not 100% correct on that, I like this mentality, and this is the sort of versatility we’ll need on our team. So, let’s continue by adding the most versatile defensive center in all of NBA history.\n\nBen Wallace 2003-04\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – All Defense 1st-Team, All-Star, 7th in MVP Voting, 2nd in Offensive Rebounds, 2nd in Defensive Rebounds, 2nd in Total Rebounds, 6th in Total Steals, 2nd in Total Blocks, 1st in Defensive Rating, 1st in Defensive Win Shares, 1st in DBPM, and 4th in VORP.\n\nPlayoffs – T-2nd Total Minutes, 1st in Offensive Rebounds, 1st in Defensive Rebounds, 1st in Total Rebounds, 1st in Steals, 1st in Blocks, 1st in Defensive Rating, 1st in Defensive Win Shares, 3rd in Win Shares, 1st in DBPM, 1st in VORP, and 2nd in BPM.\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nI admittedly have a soft spot for Ben Wallace. When I first really started getting into basketball, Big Ben was by far my favorite player. That interest dissipated for a while, but in the advent of advanced stats and old game footage, he’s climbed his way back into one of my all-time favorites.\n\nDepending on who you ask, Wallace is the best or at least a top-5 defensive player in the history of the NBA. His teams have always showcased astounding defensive abilities even when he was past his prime, and the mid-2000s Pistons were some of the stingiest defensive teams of all time. Just like Bill Russell before him, some discount just how effective he was on defensive because of his size (he’s listed at just 6’9″), but I believe that his height was actually helpful on two fronts: first, since he was strong like an ox, his low center of gravity made him near impossible to back down, and second, he was able to step out and switch on defense.\n\nIn our current league, Wallace wouldn’t deal with as many post-ups as the mid-2000s, but some players like Whiteside still shoot around 5 times per game from the post. What greatly intrigues me about Ben was his switching ability combined with his rim protecting ability (much like Draymond Green like I discussed in this article). I highly suggest that you spend some time watching some game footage from the Pistons and Magic playoff series in 2003 where Tracy McGrady, possibly the most dominant offensive threat at the time, bashed his head against Pistons’ wall. You’ll see that on many pick-and-rolls, Wallace simply switches onto McGrady without the guard fighting over the screen. This is part of their defensive scheme! If Wallace can “guard” (“guard” meaning as well as anyone can guard a transcendent scorer) on some defensive possessions, then we can trust him to handle most any taller shooting guards and forwards (I’m thinking guys like Hayward, Butler, LeBron, George and not necessarily smaller players like Curry or Thomas).\n\nBesides some advanced stats like VORP, DBMP, and Basketball Reference’s Defensive Rating, we don’t have much to quantify Wallace’s impact on the defensive end. One of my favorites (but still very flawed) is the On/Off Ratings, but these only go back to 2009 (and NBAWOWY’s data expands even less), so the last Wallace season that we can look at is his post-prime Cavaliers stint. In his more limited role, he still posted the best On/Off Defensive Rating on the team holding opposing offenses to a stifling 94.9 points/100 possessions while he was on the court and 101.6 points/100 possessions while he was off. Imagine how useful prime Wallace would have been….But let’s use numbers and not just imagine! When I tweeted at NBA Math for Ben Wallace’s numbers compared to everyone else in history on defense, they sent the following image with Rudy Gobert and Mark Eaton highlighted:\n\nUsing data from 1973 onward, this graph plots TPA which plots Offensive Points Added and Defensive Points Saved. Eaton is red, Wallace is yellow, and Gobert is blue. While Wallace is clearly a negative on the offensive end, this shows that his defensive abilities are nearly unmatched (just in case it’s difficult for you to read the axes, dots on the far right indicate a huge offensive impact while dots higher up indicate a huge defensive impact). Let’s look at his theoretical skillset:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Ben Wallace 2 1 10 9\n\nWhile Ben’s rebounding faltered a bit from being a 10 in previous years, I opted for his 2003-04 season because of the ferocity and confidence with which he played throughout the playoffs. He went toe-to-toe with apex Shaq and never blinked. His defense throughout that year is also possibly the best in the modern NBA by most every metric. I want his tenacious D (and the pick-and-roll defense of destiny) and unmatched work ethic. I hate using teammate praise because you generally have to take it with an ocean of salt, but Jerry Stackhouse hyped up Wallace with some of the highest praise possible:\n\n“I’ve played with a lot of great players: Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Grant Hill,” says the Wizards guard. “Ben Wallace’s name belongs in that list too, but for some reason people don’t think of him as the kind of player whose name belongs on the marquee. I don’t understand why. He belongs way up at the top.”\n\n– ESPN.com, “From the Archives: A Ben Wallace Feature Article,” 2006\n\nEdit: As if he were reading my blog, Jerry Stackhouse said on Zach Lowe’s Podcast that he literally released today that if he were to rank the best players with whom he ever played, it would be in this order (skip to about the 51-minute mark):\n\nDirk Nowitzki\n\nGrant Hill\n\nAllen Iverson\n\nBen Wallace\n\n[Wizards] Michael Jordan\n\nThat is some crazy high praise!\n\nPlus, Ben Wallace (with the exception of Karl Malone) has the greatest bodybuilder physique in NBA history.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nI can’t believe I’ve taken so long to make my next pick, but if I’m building a team that exemplifies championship pedigree, I can’t go further without bringing this guy into the fold.\n\nManu Ginobili 2007-08\n\nNotable Accolades: Regular Season – Sixth Man of the Year, All-NBA 3rd Team, 6th in WS/48 minutes, 3rd in BPM, 4th in OBPM, and 4th in VORP\n\nPlayoffs – 3rd in Total Three Pointers Made\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Stats\n\nRegular Season/ Playoff Advanced Stats\n\nManu might be the most underrated player in NBA history, and if you do a Google dive into the great things people have said about him, you could easily fill a week’s worth of reading. I’ll try and condense my favorites, but the clear takeaway is that Manu is a crafty playmaker who competes with a vicious drive. It’s tough to glean any of this from Manu’s numbers, but his lack of numbers actually shows something even more important to me: a willingness to sacrifice personal stardom for the greater good. Pop convinced him that coming off the bench would help the team succeed, and after a long career, Manu walks away as one of the winningest basketball players in history.\n\nManu brings a resume to this team that screams “leader” and “winner” (remember, this is prior to 2008): Three championships (2003, 2005, 2007), two Italian MVP awards (2001, 2002), a Euroleague Finals MVP (2001), an Italian Cup MVP (2002), a FIBA Americas Championship MVP (2001), and, one of the most impressive basketball accomplishments ever, an Olympic Gold where he led Argentina to its first and only gold medal in basketball that includes a victory over the USA team that had Duncan, LeBron, Melo, AI, Wade, and Amar’e (2004).\n\nDuring a pickup game with free agents back in September of 2007, Manu dived out of bounds through three players to retrieve a ball, and the player to whom he saved it scored. Zach Lowe writes that the following happened\n\n[Popovich] gathered everyone and asked them: “What does that play mean to you?” Popovich told them Ginobili wanted to win more than anyone on the floor, and that if the Spurs wished to repeat after their 2007 title, they would all need to play that hard. Popovich walked away, and everyone thought the speech was over. Suddenly, he turned: “And Manu: It’s f—ing September. Never do that again in September.”\n\n“I was honestly scared and afraid for how he would hold up over time,” Popovich said. “I get chills thinking about it now.”\n\nDuncan laughed at the memory. “Things like that happened with Manu,” he said. “It was like, ‘Manu, dude, calm down. We are just trying to make it out of practice in one piece.'”\n\n– Zach Lowe, “Welcome to Manu’s Basketball Familia,” 2016\n\nA competitive drive means very little if you don’t have the skills to back it up. Ginobili had the skill plus some. Besides his absurd passing ability and popularizing of the ubiquitous Euro-Step, Manu’s offensive game included absolutely no holes. He simply had no weaknesses. In an excellent article by Michael Lewis, Lewis speaks with defensive aficionado Shane Battier about how to defend certain players. Battier begins by discussing Kobe and ends with Manu. The bolded section is my emphasis:\n\nPeople often say that Kobe Bryant has no weaknesses to his game, but that’s not really true… For instance, the numbers show [Battier] that Allen Iverson is one of the most efficient scorers in the N.B.A. when he goes to his right; when he goes to his left he kills his team. The Golden State Warriors forward Stephen Jackson is an even stranger case. “Steve Jackson,” Battier says, “is statistically better going to his right, but he loves to go to his left — and goes to his left almost twice as often.” The San Antonio Spurs’ Manu Ginóbili is a statistical freak: he has no imbalance whatsoever in his game — there is no one way to play him that is better than another. He is equally efficient both off the dribble and off the pass, going left and right and from any spot on the floor.\n\n– Michael Lewis, “The No-Stats All-Star,” 2009\n\nThe greatest description that I’ve ever read of how to be an effective basketball player (or, really anything) comes from an obscure two-part blog post by “DewNO” where he combines the philosophy of Jorge Borges and the skillset of Manu Ginobili. In this, he states:\n\n“What if being a great player isn’t about having the best or the most spots, or having a tall, high release? What if being a great player means that being chased off your spot…is itself one of your spots?”\n\n– DewNO, “Manu and Borges: The Infinite Chase, Part 1”, 2012\n\nfollowed by:\n\nYou can force Manu to take bad shots. It’s even possible – depending on the phases of the moon – to convince him to launch a three from contortions that make even Manu subject to chance. And he does miss sometimes. But you can’t chase him off his spot, because he has only one. His spot is basketball itself, and chasing him off his spot? Well, you can try your hardest, but the chase is also going to be basketball (a little trickier, certainly) so he’s going to handle it pretty well. Don’t blame yourself.\n\n– DewNo, “Manu and Borges: The Infinite Chase, Part 2,” 2012\n\nIt’s a sexy way of saying “expect the unexpected,” but Manu embodied this playstyle. His snaking moves and crafty demeanor, as Battier discusses above, makes him impossible to slow down because if you guard him as well as you can, that new, uncomfortable position will become Manu’s best spot. You can’t guard a player that can so creatively play offense on the fly.\n\nPersonally, #8 is my favorite, but man you can’t go wrong with any of these. #1 is simply ridiculous.\n\nI didn’t spend much time discussing Manu’s defense because there’s not much information about it. Most defensive statistics point to him being above average, but this could be skewed by his excellent ability to steal the ball. Ginobili always had a nack for knowing the offense’s next move, so, like a “Roamer” that I discuss in this article, Ginobili’s value on defense lies in his disruption. Could he stay in front of his man? Absolutely. Was he a lockdown 1-to-1 defender like Avery Bradley? No, but his abilities proved to be more valuable than simple footwork. Look no further than his game-winning block against James Harden in the 2017 playoffs (let me remind you that Manu is 39 in this clip and Harden was voted 2nd in MVP):\n\nOr how about that time he blocked Kevin Durant’s dunk on the break:\n\nManu’s skillset then breaks down as follows:\n\nPlaymaking Scoring Defense Rebounding Manu Ginobili 7 7 7 5\n\nSo far, our team has the following players: Mike Conley, Ray Allen, Draymond Green, Ben Wallace, and Manu Ginobili. Is that our starting five? Who knows, but I’ll spend a full article discussing possible lineups, strengths, weaknesses, and fuller reasons for why I picked certain players (some players’ worths are contingent upon other players being with them). Stay tuned!\n\nStats from basketball reference, stats.nba, and NBAWOWY.\n\nArticle Length: ~3,300 words or about 18-25 minutes of reading.\n\nBuckle up ladies and gentlemen because this is hopefully the longest post you’ll ever see on this blog.\n\nJust in case you have 30+ minutes to use on reading my musings on the NBA, here are links to part 1, part 2, part 3, and part 4. This may just be the most intriguing part to the whole series because here is the place that most other sites that do sports hypotheticals drop the ball: the place where they defend their choice to leave certain individuals off lists such as ESPN in their top ten point guards of all time (where Stephen Curry was ranked fourth over the likes of Thomas, Kidd, Nash, and Paul) leaving Gary Payton and Mark Price off the list.\n\nI don’t plan on competing with A Song of Ice and Fire in length, so to save some time, I’m going to format my defenses a little different. I’ll pick a player’s specific year, but I won’t list all of the relevant stats next to his name; furthermore, my descriptions will be significantly shorter so that I can include only the most pertinent details, for I have quite a few players that I cut. Let’s get started. So to have some semblance of order, I’ve split the players into three categories: Bubble Players (the few players that were either originally on the team or heavily considered), Big Names (the best players of the 2000s that didn’t make the cut), and Star Glue Guys (players I considered based off their intangibles). Let’s begin.\n\nBubble Players:\n\nYao Ming 2008-09\n\nI’m going to be completely honest, Yao was actually on my roster until I started writing part 4. For real, I had every intention to put him on until I really looked at the flexibility of the roster’s positions. With Yao, I would have two players in Shaq and Yao that cannot play any other position other than the center position, and neither player is built to handle a small-ball lineup defensively. Shaq gets a pass because his physical domination overwrites any quick, defensive lapses he may cause.\n\nMy original reasons for Yao included his beautiful personality and his wet midrange game (well, almost midrange. He shot 45% from 10-16 feet in 2008-09). Not only that, but his former coach Jeff Van Gundy was very open about Yao’s complete dominance. A player that’s 7′ 6″ and can stretch the floor relatively well would always prove useful, but in the end I picked Dirk for his greater ability to stretch the floor and his flexibility in playing the four or the small five.\n\nTracy McGrady 2002-03\n\nThis will be the year that many people forget as time goes on. T-Mac made a legitimate argument for himself as the best player in the NBA by tossing up some astounding number, and, for those of you into advanced stats, this is the year T-Mac tied the second highest OBPM (offensive box plus-minus: a stat that tries to quantify a player’s offensive production on the court) of all time. If that sound dubious, the stat passes the sight test. Of th top ten OBPMs in history (counting this year), Jordan takes up three, LeBron takes up three, Curry takes up two, and T-Mac and Chris Paul take up one.\n\nT-Mac’s greatest detriment was his inability to ever leave the first round of the playoffs (not counting his Spurs stint which I outlined in this article). While this didn’t speak to his ability to carry a team especially on the offensive end, it spoke more to his inability to inspire his teammates to rise up to the next level. For a great description of T-Mac’s career, read Bill Simmons’ account of the unfortunate aspects of his career. Beyond his mentality, what he brings to the table talent-wise could be replicated by one of Durant, LeBron, Kobe, or Wade.\n\nSteve Nash 2006-07\n\nI’m going to lay out two players’ shooting percentages laid out in the following format: FG%/3P%/FT% – shooting percentages from 0-3 feet/3-10 feet/10-16 feet/16-3P. One will be Stephen Curry from 2015-16 and the other will be Nash from 2006-07. Can you guess which is which?\n\nPlayer A: 51.2%/45.9%/90.4% – 69.3%/44.9%/47.5%/46.8%\n\nPlayer B: 53.2%/45.5%/89.9% – 67.6%/55.4%/50%/52.2%\n\nWell obviously player B is Curry right? Wrong. Nash was absolutely destructive from anywhere on the court, and, combining his hyper-efficiency with his uncanny ability to find teammates for easy buckets, Nash was a top offensive player of all time. One need not look any further than Joe Johnson to find the extreme impact Nash has on his teammates. Johnson played with Nash for one season in Phoenix back in 2004-05 when he had a career high in 3P%. His second highest percentage in his career was in 2013-14 when he shot 40.1% while making 2.1 3s a game. With Nash, Johnson shot a staggering 47.8% while making 2.2 3s a game. That’s an insane difference.\n\nI just couldn’t pick Nash though because, since Curry and Nash are so similar, like I have documented before, having both would be somewhat redundant especially since both are small, poor defensive point guards. Curry at least has solid team defensive awareness whereas Nash was truly just an awful defender. Let’s just remember him by his passing and his shooting percentages.\n\nDwight Howard 2010-11\n\nDwight is truly polarizing player. On one hand, he is clearly the best center post-Shaq in the NBA and should be known as one of the greatest defensive centers of all time, but on the other, he has faced continued criticism from retired and current players alike. Many of those criticisms are called for, but in general, Dwight was dominant.\n\nHoward missed the cut for the team because of his unvaried and unpolished offensive game, and his awful personality which has pissed off organizations from the Lakers to the Magic and individuals like Stan Van Gundy, Kobe, and James Harden. If he’s Shaq’s direct backup, then the team would really have no variation between the two centers on the team. Both dominant in the areas near the basket and provide needed bulk. If Howard doesn’t get his playing time though, which he would looking at how the roster shakes out, I’m afraid he would throw too much of a fit and not work well in the locker room.\n\nManu Ginobili 2006-07\n\nIf I were to make a list of the most underrated players of all-time, Ginobili would certainly make that list. His willingness to sacrifice notoriety by coming off the bench (and playing for the Spurs) really hampered his chances of being known as an all-time great, but to be completely honest, he’s a top five shooting guard since the dawn of the millennium (Kobe, Wade, and Allen are the only three above him for sure, depending on the position at which you list Iverson). His crafty maneuvers, popularization of the Euro-step, unbelievable passing, and ice-cold veins make him the perfect addition to any team. Could he lead a playoff successful team as the number one guy? I don’t think so, but as a second or third (or in this team’s case, twelth) banana, Ginobili would be completely invaluable.\n\nTo me, the only two problems are his streakiness and his need to have the ball in his hands. The former of those issues isn’t necessarily the biggest detractor especially if you’re meant to bring some gusto off the bench, but in the end I opted for consistency and lockdown defense (Kawhi). Saying he needs the ball isn’t calling him a ball-hog in any sense of the word, but Manu simply works better as an on-ball playmaker of which this team already has an abundance.\n\nBig Names:\n\nAllen Iverson 2000-01\n\nIf anybody actually cares enough to get emotional over my articles, my leaving Iverson off the post-2000s team is probably the most I’ve pissed anyone off. Sure, it’s easy to look back now and scoff at his ridiculous inefficiency, his low assist numbers before going to Denver, and his lack of a reliable three point shooting, but Iverson typifies the generic and usually meaningless phrase of somebody playing his heart out. Iverson consistently played over forty minutes a game, and that was going balls-to-the-walls every second he was out there. At 165 pounds and barely six feet tall, Iverson took more punishment going to the rack then anybody maybe ever (Wade follows close behind if we’re counting just the 2000s). While not the strongest or greatest one-on-one defender, his unparalleled hustle and ball-hawking were terrifying for opposing offenses. The following two videos are actually my two favorite plays by Allen Iverson (jump to 3:53 in the second video). Truly the definition of the heart-and-soul of Philly.\n\nHe gets the steal, loses and regains his balance, and makes the layup all in 3.9 seconds.\n\nMarc Jackson never had a chance here. Iverson was going to get that ball.\n\nReliving some of these moments and discussing his greatness is making me slightly second-guess myself, but my criticisms of AI are substantial. Unfortunately, the “practice” rant is always brought up as a detriment to AI but in a way that misses the point. AI’s reasoning behind that news conference was that playing ball was so natural to him, so instinctual, that he didn’t understand the need to go to a structured event to learn more about it. Iverson didn’t display an aversion to practicing (you don’t get that good without tens of thousands of hours in the gym), but he did display an aversion to structure and authority which worries me on a team where cohesiveness and unselfishness is of the utmost importance (and where I already have my quota of selfishness in Shaq and Kobe). Sorry AI, but because of the aforementioned inneficiency and the attitude problem, I can’t pick you for your perpetual hustle and heart….it so kills me just because I would love to have a lineup with AI and KG. Just imagine…\n\nJason Kidd 2002-03\n\nWhen NBA players talk about other NBA players, it’s always necessary to take their comments with an ocean of salt. That said, earlier this year, LeBron stated that he would choose Jason Kidd as the NBA legend with whom he would like to play. While I wouldn’t necessarily go in that direction, but truth be told, Jason Kidd is really an unappreciated player who should be higher on everybody’s all-time PG list, like ESPN’s where Stephen Curry is listed at number 4…. Most everybody knows his wizardry with passing the ball, connecting with Vince Carter on countless alley-oops, but his intelligence goes way beyond his assist numbers. Some of the plays he made were mind-boggling in that he knew where everybody on the court should be and will be better than they do. Check out some of these videos I’ve posted below. Stupid intelligence.\n\nAlso, being a solidly built 6’4″ PG, Kidd was one of the greatest PG defenders in NBA history. He could switch easily between guarding the one and the two, and locked down his unfortunate matchup. This was because of his combination of athleticism and awareness on the court. Point is, Kidd was stupidly good.\n\nUnfortunately, Kidd really was a poor shooter from pretty much everywhere on the court. His FG% of 41% isn’t really indicative of his efficiency on the court since the majority of his shots came from three, and he shot a respectable percentage at the rim; however, his greatest skill of being a floor general might be overshadowed by having guys like Paul, LeBron, and Wade on the team who also excel with the ball in their hands. Sure, Kidd would be extremely helpful particularly on the defensive end, but his strengths don’t match up with the rest of the team.\n\nCarmelo Anthony 2012-13\n\nMelo is that one star who has been right on the cusp of being one of the best for essentially his whole career. He consistently has been one of the most dangerous scorers in the league for the past 10 years, and his teams (used to be) perennial playoff threats. Now after deciding to not leave the Knicks for the Bulls in the summer of 2014, Melo has essentially wiped out any chance of leading a team to the championship. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is that Melo is a tremendous scorer who would be ridiculously productive as a 3-4 who stretches the floor with his ability to get really hot (like when he scored 37 points in 14-and-a-half minutes on 10-12 shooting from three against Nigeria in the 2012 Olympics).\n\nThe issues with Carmelo are that he’s not a particularly willing passer or defender, and he plays bully ball where guys like LeBron and Shaq are going to be roaming. As much as I would love to test out a lineup of Curry, Allen, Durant, Carmelo, and Shaq, Melo just isn’t worth it.\n\nChris Webber 2001-02\n\nI was really rooting for Webber to make my team honestly. His unselfish passing, ability to stretch the floor, and solid defensive instincts made him what appeared to be a lock for the team, but, for a couple or reasons, I just can’t trust him. First and most obviously are his well documented injuries during his Sacremento days. During the 2000s, he only played 70 or more games once (and it was 70 in 2000-01) because of his continued knee troubles. Second, and not just because of the notorious Michigan State mishap, but Webber just wasn’t a clutch player. Sure, he has some magnificent games in crunch time such as his 51 point 26 rebound explosion against the Pacers in 2001, but even that performance didn’t translate to a win. Third, and most importantly as Zach Lowe points out in this wonderful description of Webber’s career, Webber really wasn’t particularly good at the gritty details required to win. He grabbed uncontested rebounds, overpassed instead of becoming aggressive, and took too many possessions off on the defensive end. Webber’s IQ on the offensive side would have been perfect for the squad, but it just doesn’t outweigh the negatives for him.\n\nRussell Westbrook 2015-2016\n\nWestbrook seems to always have a parade of critics shouting out some new narrative which he subsequently proves wrong: he’s a ball-hog – he averages 10.8 assists a game; he’s inefficient – he has a true shooting percentage of 55.7%; he’s not a great defender – he averages over two steals and has a DBPM of 2.3 which matches Ron Artest’s DBPM during his DPOY season. So what’s the problem? On paper, Westbrook is the perfect player (basically), and, if you only pay attention to what other stars say like Kobe Bryant say about him, you’d think he would be leading his team to the best record in NBA history.\n\nWell, plain and simply, I can’t trust Westbrook. I have a few specific moments in mind, but the video I posted below does a good job of showing the sort of thing I’m talking about.\n\nHe finishes with extreme authority, but only shoots 59% from 0-3 feet from the basket which is about three percentage points better than Tony Allen. My only explanatino for this is an inabillity to slow the hell down. Westbrook’s best quality of going 100% every second he’s on the court is what gets him into the most trouble on both ends of the court. He tries to become Michael Jordan in the fourth quarter, gambles for wild steals on many possessions, and falls in love too much with the three-point shot. I can’t have a loose canon like this on the team (I already have my hands full containing Kobe).\n\nStar Glue Guys:\n\nChauncey Billups 2007-08\n\nIf I had been decided entirely on picking a twelth man solely for his leadership qualities, it would have been Chauncey. He encompasses the old adage of a true professional, and he brought that attitude to him every single day regardless of whether or not it was a practice or a game. Jonathan Abrams of Grantland (RIP) masterfully explains how Billups’ journey in the NBA turned in a way to make him one of the most respected players of the 2000s. While he will always be immortalized by his Mr. Big Shot nickname, he was a bit overrated in that aspect comparatively to other stars, but that confidence from him and his teammates shows something even more telling: Billups was the de facto man of a very successful franchise.\n\nWhile Billups’ volume three-point shooting at a 40+ percentage would have been perfect as the off-ball leader on this team, his defensive abilities concerned me slightly. He was the leader of one of the stingiest defenses the NBA has ever seen, but much of that needs to be attributed to Big Ben and Tayshaun Prince. That would have been find if I ddin’t already have a couple of players whose defense is a tad concerning to me (Curry, Allen, Durant, and Dirk), so I opted for the defensive aficionado in Kawhi. I hope I don’t regret not taking the quintessential leader.\n\nTony Parker 2008-09\n\nThe stea dy, underappreciated point guard is once again left off a team of which he is clearly worthy. Parker never had eye-popping stats which will unfortunately render him essentially unknown within the next couple of decades. Nobody will remember that during the majority of the Tim Duncan era, Parker was right by his side as the whirling dervish in the paint, contorting his body every which way to finish over, around, and under any competitor. Pop took the time to really lay into him early in his career which helped Parker to become the current unshakeable leader. He runs the Spurs motion offense as well as anybody, and shoots the midrange ball dangerously enough to cause a defensive nightmare on the pick-and-roll.\n\nThe two largest issues with Parker are his three-point shooting and his defense. His first season was the only season in which he made at least one threee-pointer a game. His quickness and intelligence helped him work around this deficiency, but for a backup player receiving limited minutes, I need a player that’s more specialized and less skilled across the board.\n\nBen Wallace 2003-2004\n\nOne of the best, if not the best defensive player in the history of the game, a conclusion drawn from both anecdotal evidence, other’s opinions, and essentially every advanced statistic for calculating defense. His 03-04 season ranks as the 12th highest DWS season ever (only three players made the list above him: Dave Cowens (once), Wilt (twice), and Bill Russell (eight times…wow)), and it ranks as number two all-time in DBPM (behind his 2002-03 season) and is one of five of his seasons to appear in the top ten for the same stat. Ben Wallace won games with his defense.\n\nI think we all know what the issue is. Let me throw some numbers at you: 42.1, 42.4, and 45. Those are his FG%, two-point percentage, and his free-throw percentage respectively. Wallace was useless at scoring the basketball. His offensive rebounding prowess helped him to still contribute tremendously on the offensive end, but, even for the best defensive player since Dennis Rodman (or maybee even Bill Russell), I really cannot have such a liability on the offensive end.\n\nThere you have it folks! You slogged through countless words to find my true thoughts on the most cohesive team that I could muster post-2000. You’ve also seen why I picked those players, and why I left certain players off the list. I apologize if this article seemed rushed at all for any particular player, but as you can see, it already dragged on a bit too long. If you have any thoughts on any of these sections or would like me to discuss anything else in further detail, please let me know.\n\nCited Articles:\n\nESPN.com, “All-Time #NBArank: Magic Johnson tops list of greatest point guards”\n\nAbrams, Jonathan, “The Legacy of Yao”\n\nHoudek, Cody, “The Great “Greatness” Debate: Tracy McGrady Vs.
