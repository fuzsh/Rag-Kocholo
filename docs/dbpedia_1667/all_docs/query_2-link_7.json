        "text": "Aaron MContributor III\n\nNBA Playoffs 2011: Most Memorable Playoff Performance in Each Team's History\n\n0 of 30\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nOnly eight teams remain in the NBA playoffs.\n\nThere are some teams with long, illustrious playoff histories such as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, while there are others like the Memphis Grizzlies, who are trying to create their own history.\n\nThe playoffs have been widely entertaining thus far.\n\nThere has been a distinguishable increase in intensity in comparison to the regular season. There have been upsets, but most importantly, there has been the effort, drive and motivation witnessed in the star players who have the burning passion to lift the title.\n\nPlayers are going on the floor each night and giving it everything they have.\n\nThis slideshow looks historically at each NBA team.\n\nIt looks at individuals who have lifted their team and wrote a page in the history books with just one memorable performance.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBoston Celtics: Bob Cousy Scores 50\n\n1 of 30\n\nOn March 22, 1953, Bob Cousy played a remarkable game that would forever cement his name in the history books.\n\nPrior to this date, the Celtics had never won a playoff series. However, this was about to change.\n\nIn a four-overtime thriller, the Boston Celtics prevailed over Syracuse, led by the efforts of the \"Houdini of the Hardwood\" Bob Cousy.\n\nThe Celtics defeated Syracuse 111-105 after four overtimes, and Cousy scored 50 points. He capitalized off Syracuse, who managed to commit a stunning 55 fouls. Thirty of Cousy's 50 points game from the free throw line, as he went 30-32 from the free throw line.\n\nHowever, what is most remarkable about this performance isn't the points. It wasn't his ability to get to the line. It was the long one-handed shot, five seconds before the buzzer.\n\nThat shot sent the game into the fourth overtime, and that particular shot made all the difference in the world.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: Magic Johnson Works Magic\n\n2 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nOn May 15, 1984, Magic Johnson lifted the Lakers to victory and wrote his name in the history books.\n\nIn Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Johnson contributed with six points, five steals, seven rebounds and two blocks. However, it was the 24 assists that led to the Lakers beating the Suns by a score of 118-102.\n\nThe 24 assists were the difference in a game where previously, assists didn't matter much.\n\nHe changed the dynamic of the game as the Lakers flourished under the \"showtime\" high tempo system, and these 24 assists are tied with John Stockton's 24 as the most assists ever in a playoff game.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: Bob Pettit Puts on the Performance of a Lifetime\n\n3 of 30\n\nCaptivating, magical, immaculate, stunning and insurmountable.\n\nJust some of the words that still would never be able to accurately describe Bob Pettit's Game 6 performance in the 1958 NBA Finals.\n\nThey were called the St. Louis Hawks, and Bob Pettit cemented them in the history books forever.\n\nBob scored 50 points in Game 6, the deciding game in which the Hawks won the championship. What is most incredible is that there were times when he was double and triple teamed and still found a way to score.\n\nWhat is most stunning about this performance is the fact that he scored 18 of the final 21 points and carried the Hawks all by himself.\n\nDallas Mavericks: Dirk Saves the Season\n\n4 of 30\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nIn 2006, the Mavericks were leading the conference semifinals series against the Spurs by a lead of 3-1.\n\nThe Mavericks slipped and let the Spurs back into the series, where it would all be decided in Game 7. Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks to what would only be the second time in NBA history that a road team won a Game 7 in overtime.\n\nNowitzki hit a big three in the fourth quarter that saved the Mavericks' season. He poured in 37 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nHe found a way to drive to the basket and didn't settle for jumpers, and as a result, he saved the Mavericks and they ended up in the NBA Finals.\n\nWhere would the Mavericks be without Dirk?\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: Z-Bo Leads the Grizz to a Series Win\n\n5 of 30\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nYou don't have to look deep into the past for this one.\n\nOn April 29, 2011, Zach Randolph carried the No. 8 seed Grizzlies past the No. 1 seed Spurs in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nRandolph scored 31 points in this series-deciding Game 6. What is most remarkable about this performance is the way he closed the game.\n\nScoring 17 points in the fourth quarter, Randolph stepped up and scored 13 points in the final 4:24 remaining in the game. He scored 13 of the Grizzlies' final 20 points.\n\nThe Grizzlies won 99-91 and still remain in the hunt for the title.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Gus Williams Puts on a Stunning Back to Back Performance\n\n6 of 30\n\nThe 1979 NBA Finals took place between the Washington Bullets and the Seattle Supersonics, who are now referred to as the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nGus Williams carried the Sonics with back to back performances. He had 31 points in Game 3 of the Finals and did better in Game 4 with 36 points.\n\nThe Bullets simply had no answer for Williams, who scored with ease every time he touched the ball.\n\nSixty-eight points in two games, Williams was the difference in this series, and the Sonics went on to win the title in five games.\n\nMiami Heat: Flash Wins It for the Heat\n\n7 of 30\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nDwyane Wade will never forget Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals\n\nHe scored 42 points and added a career high 13 rebounds. He scored 15 in the fourth quarter and ignited a 22-7 run which saw the Heat erase a 13 point deficit.\n\nDwyane \"Flash\" Wade was unstoppable the entire series.\n\nHe went onto win the NBA Finals MVP, averaging 34.7 points per game in the NBA Finals, third highest in NBA history.\n\nWithout Dwyane Wade religiously putting up points well over 30 points, the Heat would have never have come close to winning the title.\n\nChicago Bulls: Michael Jordan and the \"Flu\" Game\n\n8 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nNo memorable playoff list is complete without the \"Flu\" game.\n\nMichael Jordan did it all while barely being able to move. In Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals, Jordan was visibly sick.\n\nHe was diagnosed with a stomach virus that saw him barely make it out of bed. However, three hours before tip off, Jordan woke up and found himself at the Delta Center.\n\nVisibly shaken and pale, Jordan started the game cold and not contributing much in the first quarter. This all changed in the second, as he started to hit his shots and added 17 points in the quarter.\n\nHe finished the game with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and one block.\n\nThe Bulls won 90-88.\n\nIn a game where most athletes would be in bed watching it on television barely able to move, Jordan was on the court giving it everything he had.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nToronto Raptors: Vinsanity Steals the Show\n\n9 of 30\n\nBrian Bahr/Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2001 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals, there was a duel between two future Hall of Famers.\n\nAllen Iverson vs Vince Carter.\n\nCarter carried the Raptors throughout the series and poured in 33 points in Game 6. He was simply unstoppable and carried the team onto Game 7, where he'd eventually miss a buzzer beater.\n\nIt has been 10 years, and the Raptors have not reached that level of success since.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Iverson Torches the Raptors\n\n10 of 30\n\nDave Sandford/Getty Images\n\nThe Answer was all over the Toronto Raptors in the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nGame Five would make him stand out. He was the league's MVP and scored 52 points, including a stunning 29 in the first half.\n\nAll this while playing with a sprained thumb.\n\nIverson compared the basket to an ocean and simply could not miss. He scored eight from the three point land, and he is the second player ever to score 50 or more twice in a playoff series.\n\nJordan did it against Cleveland in 1988.\n\nDenver Nuggets: Carmelo Anthony Leads the Nuggets to Their Own Page in History\n\n11 of 30\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nOn April 27 2009, Carmelo Anthony had 26 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Pretty good.\n\nHe scored all of his 26 points in the third quarter. Fantastic.\n\nThe Nuggets beat the Hornets by a score of 121-63.\n\n58 points was the margin of victory for this Nuggets team, a victory that would see them tied for highest margin of victory ever in the playoffs.\n\nWhat is amazing is that they did this in New Orleans. Dirty.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: Rookie Alonso Mourning Sinks the Celtics\n\n12 of 30\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nThe last thing Celtics legend Kevin McHale will remember about his career is being stunned by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nRookie Alonso Mourning hit a 20 foot jumper with 0.4 seconds left, and the Hornets stunned the Celtics by a score of 103-102. They went on to win the series.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Elton Brand Wins It for the Clippers\n\n13 of 30\n\nLisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images\n\nHistorically speaking, the Clippers do not have much to cheer about.\n\nThey have been plagued by terrible upper-management, players who don't live up to standards and the fans have to deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, who have been a success story for decades.\n\nHowever, Elton Brand gave the Clippers' faithful some joy. During the 2006 Western Conference Semifinals, Brand scored 30 points and added 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Clippers won the game 118-106 and forced a Game 7, where they were destroyed by a score of 127-107.\n\nNew York Knicks: Ewing Leads the Knicks\n\n14 of 30\n\nTim DeFrisco/Getty Images\n\nWith the Knicks down 2-1, Patrick Ewing stepped up.\n\nWillis Reed had a great performance in 1970, but Ewing brought the Knicks back to life with his performance in Game 4.\n\nHe scored 44 points,13 rebounds, seven steals and five blocks.\n\nThe Knicks beat the Celtics by a score of 135-108 because Ewing simply did it all.\n\nIndiana Pacers: Reggie Miller Shuts Up Spike and Company\n\n15 of 30\n\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nNo one will ever forget this performance.\n\nDuring Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, Reggie Miller took the game into his own hands.\n\nHe had 39 points, 25 of which were in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat is memorable about this performance was the fact that he'd look over to Spike Lee after every shot and simply taunt him.\n\nHe grabbed his crotch and made a choking motion; how could anyone ever forget?\n\nHe took on everyone inside Madison Square Garden and came out on top.\n\nOrlando Magic: Shaq Tries to Win but Can't Beat Hakeem\n\n16 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nShaq did everything he could during the 1995 NBA Finals, but he just was not good enough. His best performance came during Game 2 of the Finals, where he added 33 points, his highest of the series.\n\nIt still was not good enough, as the Magic were swept by the Houston Rockets in Four.\n\nShaq would go on to win four NBA Titles, but if you were to ask him, I bet he'd tell you this series stings the most.\n\nHouston Rockets: The Dream Leads His Team\n\n17 of 30\n\nAndy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nHakeem Olajuwon is one of the few players to average over 30 points in every game of an NBA Finals Series.\n\nHe scores over 30 in every game during the 1995 NBA Finals and won the title for the Magic. He was unstoppable and his most memorable performance was Game 2.\n\nOlajuwon scored 34 points, and the Rockets went on to win the game by a score of 117-106.\n\nIt was a series in which The Dream could not have been stopped.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Davis and Jackson Stun the Mavericks\n\n18 of 30\n\nJed Jacobsohn/Getty Images\n\nPlaying with a strained hamstring, Bron Davis brushed it off as the eighth ranked Golden State Warriors defeated the first place Dallas Mavericks in the opening round of the 2007 playoffs.\n\nStephen Jackson made seven three-pointers in Game 6 while Baron Davis, hurt, added 20 points.\n\nThe Mavericks were stunned, and the Oracle Arena was the place to be at the time; the atmosphere was simply electric.\n\nSacramento Kings: Peja Leads the Kings to a Massive Comeback\n\n19 of 30\n\nOtto Greule Jr/Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the Sacramento Kings found themselves down by 19 early in the second quarter in Game 4 of the opening round against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nAfter missing 22 consecutive shots, it seemed like they were headed for defeat.\n\nThen Peja hit the \"on\" switch.\n\nHe could not miss, scoring 37 points, and went 14 of 14 from the free throw line.\n\nThe Kings won the series and were headed to the second round of the playoffs, their first time in over 20 years.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: Bill Walton Intimidates Philadelphia\n\n20 of 30\n\nDuring Game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals, Bill Walton held his own, and it paid off.\n\nScoring 23 points, Walton helped the Trail Blazers win their first and only NBA Title. However, his 23 points were not the most significant stat.\n\nWalton had eight blocks and was a terror in the paint for Philadelphia, who were rattled by his interior presence.\n\nLater on, Julius Erving would refer to Walton as \" an inspiration.\"\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Tim Duncan Does It Again\n\n21 of 30\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA Finals, Tim Duncan was the difference that led the Spurs to victory and forced the Pistons into the depths of defeat.\n\nDuncan added 25 points, 11 rebounds and three assists in a low-scoring affair that saw the Spurs win the decisive Game 7.\n\nHe took over in the fourth, and the season all came down to that quarter. With an effortless hook shot, he could not have been stopped and also picked up the 2005 NBA Finals MVP award.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Robertson Cements His Legacy\n\n22 of 30\n\nDuring the 1971 NBA Finals, it was all about Oscar Robertson.\n\nRobertson had played 10 seasons and had never come close to an NBA championship, but that was about to change. The Bucks took a 3-0 series lead heading into Game 4.\n\nRobertson stepped up during Game 4 and cemented his legacy. He contributed with 21 first half points and 30 total points.\n\nHe was 11-15 from the field and had nine assists.\n\nThe Bucks swept Baltimore, and Oscar got his first taste of victory.\n\nUtah Jazz: The Mailman Delivers\n\n23 of 30\n\nBrian Bahr/Getty Images\n\nThe 1997 NBA Finals was all about Michael Jordan, but we can't forget Karl Malone.\n\nKarl Malone bested Michael Jordan on this night, adding 37 points and 10 rebounds while shooting .517 from the floor.\n\nThe Jazz won the game 104-93 and were back in the series after being down 0-2.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats: Gerald Wallace Gets a Double-Double\n\n24 of 30\n\nBrian A. Westerholt/Getty Images\n\nNot much historical significance here.\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats made the playoffs for the first time during the 2009-10 NBA playoffs.\n\nThey were fed to the Orlando Magic, who decimated them. However, during Game 1, Gerald Wallace added 25 points and 17 rebounds.\n\nA phenomenal effort in a losing cause as the Bobcats lost 89-98 and were swept in the series.\n\nNew Jersey Nets: Kidd with the Triple-Double\n\n25 of 30\n\nTom Pidgeon/Getty Images\n\nThe least memorable series I could think of was in 2002, when the Lakers swept the Nets.\n\nThe Dynastic Lakers were just too powerful; however, Game 1 was a very close game, and Jason Kidd did everything he could to keep the Nets in the game.\n\nAdding 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, Kidd went to work on the Lakers and came out on top; shame his team didn't.\n\nDetroit Pistons: Joe Dumars Handles the Lakers\n\n26 of 30\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James Does Everything He Could in a Losing Effort\n\n27 of 30\n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nIt is almost impossible to mention the Cleveland Cavaliers and not mention LeBron James.\n\nDespite how the relationship ended, for seven years he was their star, their franchise.\n\nThe 2007 NBA Finals was the closest LeBron and Cleveland would ever come to a championship, and while they were swept in four games, LeBron put on a memorable performance in Game 4.\n\nScoring 24 points and 10 assists, LeBron did everything he could to keep them in the game. They lost 83-82 and have never achieved that level of success again.\n\nWashington Wizards: Charles Johnson Wins It for the Bullets\n\n28 of 30\n\nThe Seattle Supersonics were the stronger team during the 1978 NBA Finals, but the Washington Bullets were a fierce, gritty team.\n\nIt all came down to Game 7, and while Wes Unseld was the hero for the Bullets in this series, Charles Johnson poured in 19 during Game 7 and won the game for the Bullets.\n\nHe had signed a 10 day contract with the Bullets that season and ended up staying. He scored 80 points in the final four games of the 1978 NBA Finals and won them the series.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: Garnett Wins It for the Wolves\n\n29 of 30\n\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nGarnett is not the most likable athlete, but in 2004, he was carrying the Timberwolves.\n\nDuring Game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Garnett scored 32 points and added 21 rebounds. He even hit a three pointer.\n\nThe Wolves won the game by a score of 83-80 and went on to the Western Final, where they lost to the Lakers.\n\nWithout Garnett, the Wolves would have never made the playoffs, let alone make it to the conference finals.\n\nPhoenix Suns: Barkley Does It All\n\n30 of 30\n\nTim DeFrisco/Getty Images\n\nAnother game, another Jordan victory.\n\nDuring Game 2 of the 1993 NBA Finals, Jordan had 42 points. How could anyone forget?\n\nBarkley did the exact same thing.\n\nYou can't forget what Barkley did, which was everything he could to keep the Suns in the game.\n\nHe had 42 points, 13 rebounds and four assists.\n\nMost importantly, he shot an immaculate 61.5 percent from the field.\n\nThe Bulls won the game 111-108, but what an effort by Barkley!\n\nX"
