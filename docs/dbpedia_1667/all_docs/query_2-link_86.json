        "text": "My bad i forgot he went to the Lakers. I thought he retired but then came back to them so it wasnt like he left the Jazz for the Lakers? correct me if im wrong please cause yeah im unsure on that.\n\nI HATE THE CELTICS. The fact they went 7 games with the Hawks brought a smile to my dial. New Orleans r gonna win it all. They r on fire.\n\nWell we are allowed to hate some teams (just not the Knicks of course) and players sometimes for no reason. LOL.\n\nHmm from what I recall, Malone didn't really retire until after that Lakers season.\n\nYa. New Orleans are proving me wrong. And I'm happy about it. Like I said in the \"End of Season Awards Predictions\" thread, Chris Paul deserves the MVP a little more than Kobe, but this year is Kobe's year. I'd rather the Hornets win and get a chance at the Finals than those boring Spurs. Plus I hate Bruce Bowen. He's the dirtiest player ever. He sucks! Let's just hope it doesn't end up like the 2004 Lakers-Spurs series. The heavily favored Lakers \"dream team\" were down 0-2 with Parker owning Payton, and then suddenly Lakers won 4 straight. Hornets have to deliver the hammer right away in game 3. Don't give any more chances to San Antonio.\n\nThe Hornets are 2-0 vs the Spurs, are they the better team?\n\nNO is a perfect team, Great PG, SG who plays good D and can score, SF who shots lights out, PF who has all the tools and is full of fire, C who controls the paint, and a rookie with boatloads of pontental and good work ethic. My jealousy wants me to hate em.\n\nByron Scott!\n\nThe Hornets are definitely stacked.\n\nWhat amazes me most is how careful Paul is with the ball. In the 7 games thus far this postseason, he has 85 assists to just 9 turnovers.\n\nThey definitely have all the tools needed to make a serious run, even in the strong West. In addition to all their talent on the floor, they have a coach who has been to the Finals as a player and a coach. So he knows what to expect.\n\nWhen I seen how Bryron Scott coach his practices back in 2002-3 of the Nets, I was told that all the coaching format credit should go to assistant coach Eddie Jordan & Mike O'Koren. And that was the format that all three coaches could not get Marbury to follow alongside of KVH.\n\nByron Scott build the fastest backcourt in the NBA with Kidd & Kittles.\n\nNow he build an atrocious swift backcourt with Chris & Peterson.\n\nDid Byron hold a grudge against Kidd? 4-1\n\nThe Byron Scott Hornets vs Spurs 7 game series with the Homecourt in favor.\n\nPure DEFENSE!\n\nin the Cavs vs Celtics Playoff Series.\n\nBoston won the first game which was tight down the stretch to the final seconds of the game.\n\nKing James shot 2-18 fg, and gave out 10 turnovers.\n\nWhile Pierce shot a 2-14 fg, 6 turnovers, and his buddy Ray Allen shot 0-4 fg, and donated 4 turnovers.\n\nThe Cavs actually have the three players that could beat the Celtics Big-3 in 6 games in their lineup of \"6.8 James, 6.7 Pavlovic, and 6.7 Szczerbiak\". These 3 players are G/F that knows how to space the court on offense & defense. When you add a 6.2 PG-Gibson and a 6.10 Center Varegao the Celtics become overmatched (with 4-peremeter shooters).\n\nCavs coach Brown seem scared to put in all three of his scoring G/F at the sametime keeping one on the bench resting.\n\nI hope he seen in this first game the Boston clamp on Lebron in the paint is a defensive plan structured early in the regular season that worked, and still is working in the postseason.\n\nHere's some Knick Playoff talk\n\nHow is it that coach Byron Scott's young Hornets team are able to beat the Championship Spurs 3 games in the playoffs, and coach D'Antoni's Phoenix Suns had a hard time winning 1 game this playoffs vs the same Spurs that knocked them out of last year playoffs.\n\nThe question most asked since the trading deadline was how much did coach D'Antoni have to do with the Shaq trade.\n\nWhen the most important question should've been the Kurt Thomas trade, and why did'nt the Suns pick-up a walking Kurt Thomas before the Spurs did? Did'nt Kurt Thomas play a very important role in the Suns postseason last year?\n\nWhen the Hornets WON the first two games of the Spurs series coach D'Antoni knew he was FIRED...\n\nHere's some Knick Playoff talk\n\nHow is it that coach Byron Scott's young Hornets team are able to beat the Championship Spurs 3 games in the playoffs, and coach D'Antoni's Phoenix Suns had a hard time winning 1 game this playoffs vs the same Spurs that knocked them out of last year playoffs.\n\nThe question most asked since the trading deadline was how much did coach D'Antoni have to do with the Shaq trade.\n\nWhen the most important question should've been the Kurt Thomas trade, and why did'nt the Suns pick-up a walking Kurt Thomas before the Spurs did?

You brought this thread back. If its knicks news make another thread. If you wanna post about the NBA go into the right section. Whats the deal kiyaman? Can you read? Heres a picture for you to jack off to.\n\nWe have several playoff threads in the nba section.\n\n/thread\n\nOne of the mods needs to delete this thread.\n\n/thread\n\nNichols cant read.\n\nWe Have a NBA Section for Threads like this\n\n/ the f*ckin thread\n\nPlease Rady anyone delete this thread\n\nAll NBA related posts belong here:\n\nhttp://www.knicksonline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=9\n\nMSGKnickz, you still dont get it do you?\n\nHow many regular posters on this board has you seen posting on the NBA Postseason thread?\n\nThis is a Knick Board that team has not seen the Postseason in any of Isiah Thomas full seasons with this Knick team (4 seasons).\n\nWe are losing touch with the big difference between regular season games and the Postseason games series by not commenting on it on this board.\n\nWe would rather comment on fantasy trades, fantasy draft picks, rather than talk about the lowest winning team in the playoffs (Atlanta Hawks), making the highest winning team in the playoff (Boston Celtics) play all seven games in a series. Why? How? What was different from regular to postseason?\n\nThis post was to compare all 16 playoffs teams to our Knick team from the head coach, coaching-staff, the systems, and all the players positions.\n\nExample:\n\nGame 5 of the Boston vs Detroit series showed how the perfomance of a Role-Player (Kendrick Perkins) could step-up his skillz & talent to the next-level to help his team win a playoff game.\n\nKendrick Perkins get the MVP of Game-5 with a 38 minute performance shooting 8-11 FG for 18 points, grabbing 16 rebounds, 2 steals, and 2 blockshots.\n\nNow that's a decent \"Role-Player\" to have in a teams rotation.\n\nYou dont expect these big numbers from a role-player, but when they do show up you know this player been adding this to the team just in smaller numbers.\n\nPG-Rajon Rondo 7 pts, 13 ast, 6 rbd, and 4 steals, in helping win this playoff game is another \"Role-Player\" that deserve his Props for his overall performance.\n\nWe Knick-Fans should know that we have such \"Role-Players\" on our controversal Knick roster in the players \"David Lee, Renaldo Balkman, Wilson Chandler, and Nate Robinson\". All earning $2 million and under per season.\n\nOur Knick Role-Players could use a tight group of 3 to 4 leadership teammates like (KG, Pierce, and Ray, or Billups, RIP, Prince, and Wallace), which perfomance is all on the \"Same-Page\" so they could follow their lead."
