        "text": "The question is often posed, “If you had everyone in NBA history to choose from, what would your team be?” Invariably, the starting lineup is whomever the person thinks are the best players in NBA history at their position, as they commit the fallacy of composition, assuming that what is true of each part of a whole will be true of the whole itself, and then they load the bench with MVPs. A poster on one basketball message board said:\n\nPeople always seem to be pretty similar on their ultimate unbeatable teams (i.e. prime Magic Johnson, prime MJ, prime Bird, prime Kareem, prime Duncan, prime Olajuwon, prime so on and so on), but if you think about it does it really make sense? All of those guys in their prime would be the guy the team ran through, the centerpiece, the seed from which the rest of the team grew. So they would definitely be good (as the Dream Team proved when they all took limited roles in the name of winning) but would they work out as a team throughout a season? Wouldn’t there be major problems with touches and chemistry if everyone felt as though they were being under-utilized?\n\nThis is something people rarely seem to consider, and I am in agreement. It’s emblematic of what I call the “NBA 2K” mentality. I find it much more interesting to limit a team to one Top 10 player of all time, have a limit on the number of players who were First Team All-NBA, and limit the bench to players who actually came off the bench. It also requires some actual thought, as a team of Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Jordan and Magic takes no thought whatsoever, nor does it show any originality. Synergy, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts, is imperative.\n\nSo I began a project to create a “dream team” for each of the “consensus Top 10” players in NBA history, with every player from every era in NBA history available to choose from, to construct an ideal team that complements what they bring to the table. We read and hear people complaining about the teammates of certain players. The aim is to eliminate such complaints by putting everyone on equal footing, with his own custom-made team with teammates specifically chosen to complement him.\n\nWhen creating these teams, I had the 1980s in mind as a baseline. “Could I see this team competing in the 1980s with the best the decade had to offer?” is what I ask myself when forming this teams. With every player in NBA history available to choose from, one would expect such teams to be a bit better than your average team, but at the same time I want them to be realistic relative to the level of talent available. For instance, it would be impossible under any circumstance to assemble a team of prime Shaq, prime Duncan, and prime Bird or LeBron, which is the kind of lineup you typically see in “Dream Team” scenarios. That would require other GMs just standing around for some unknown reason and allowing one person to select his whole team before allowing everyone else to choose from his leftovers. I act like they’re going to be competing in an 82-game season against similarly constructed teams. With that in mind, here is my first attempt at such a dream team:\n\nRUSSELL’S J IS NASHTY IN MILLER TIME\n\nSTARTING LINEUP\n\n1963-64 Bill Russell\n\nRussell is the cornerstone and captain of the team. He was the centerpiece of the greatest dynasty in the history of professional sports, his Boston Celtics winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966, and 11 in 13 years. Before joining the Celtics he led the University of San Francisco Dons to a 57-1 record and back-to-back NCAA championships in 1955 and ’56, including a then-record 55-game winning streak (since surpassed only by UCLA), and led the 1956 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal at the Melbourne Olympics by an average margin of 53.5 points per game, which is still the largest in Olympic history (by comparison, the 1992 Barcelona Dream Team won by an average of 43.8 points per game). After Red Auerbach retired as Celtics’ coach in 1966, Russell took over, going 162-83 and winning two NBA championships (1968 and 1969) in his three seasons as player-coach before retiring in 1969 after winning his 11th NBA title. In 1980, for the NBA’s 35th anniversary, the Professional Basketball Writers’ Association of America voted Russell the greatest player of all time; in 1999, Sports Illustrated named him the Greatest Team Player of the 20th Century; in 2009, the NBA Finals MVP award was re-named the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his honor.\n\n“Defense wins championships.” It is due to Bill Russell that this oft-repeated adage exists. “From high school to the NBA, I played 21 years of organized basketball and won 18 championships, including the record 11 NBA titles, by focusing on our being the better defensive team,” Russell wrote before Game Two of the 2004 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Lakers. Prior to Russell’s arrival, “When you played the Celtics, Cousy would get 20 and Sharman and Macauley would get their 20,” said Charley Eckman, who coached the Fort Wayne Pistons from 1954 to 1957, “but you could still beat them by 20” (Terry Pluto, Tall Tales: The Glory Years of the NBA, in the Words of the Men Who Played, Coached, and Built Pro Basketball, p. 118). “You’d get into a lot of 140-135 games with those old Boston teams,” said Tom Gola, who played 10 seasons in the league with the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors and New York Knicks in 1955-56, 1957-58 to 1965-66. “They tried to outscore you. When they were hot, they could score at will but they could never stop anyone” (ibid). After Russell joined the team, the Celtics became the greatest defensive dynasty in NBA history. Dean Oliver, when discussing the findings for his book Basketball on Paper on APBR two years prior to the book’s publication, said, “I’m coming up with [rather remarkable numbers] for those Celtic defenses. They are so good that I have been having trouble believing them. […] What it says about the Celtics of the ’60’s is that they were the most consistently dominant defensive unit ever” (Aug 27, 2002). “The greatest dynasty in NBA history was also the best multi-year defensive team in NBA history,” said Neil Paine on Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nRussell’s defense launched the Boston Celtics’ fastbreak. When he blocked shots, he didn’t swat the ball out of bounds—which merely results in a clock stoppage with the other team maintaining possession of the ball; he would either: (a) hit the bottom of the ball causing it to pop up in the air, which he would then grab as if it were a rebound and dish to the wings to start the fast break, or (b) direct the ball to a teammate, who would then take off in the other direction. These resulted in four-point swings, the two points Russell took away from the opposing team, and the two points the Celtics subsequently scored on the break.\n\nIn the 2013 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, Kirk Goldsberry and Eric Weiss presented a paper entitled “The Dwight Effect: A New Ensemble of Interior Defense Analytics for the NBA.” In it, they wrote:\n\nWe assert that “dominant” interior defense can manifest in two ways: reducing the shooting efficiency of opponents, and also reducing the shooting frequency of opponents. […] We also contend that dominant interior defenders often deter shots from even happening. Many NBA players will be reluctant to “challenge” a dominant interior player or be more likely to “settle” for a jump shot further from the basket. […] This is what we call the “Dwight Effect” – the most effective way to defend close range shots is to prevent them from even happening. Although Howard does not lead the league in blocks, he does lead the league in “invisible blocks,” which may prove to be markedly more significant. When Howard is protecting the basket, opponents shoot many fewer close range shots than average, and settle for many more mid-range shots, which are the least productive shots in the NBA. (pp. 4-5)\n\nBefore “The Dwight Effect” was “The Russell Effect”. With Russell patrolling the hardwood, the highest-percentage shot in basketball became a bad shot. “Russell is not big for a center—only 6-10—but he’s so smart and so quick he has complete control of the middle of the court,” said Jerry West. “He stops guys from driving and shooting and passing near the basket because he blocks so many shots and intercepts so many passes he inhibits the other guys” (Jerry West with Bill Libby, Mr. Clutch: The Jerry West Story, p. 97). He would come out of nowhere to block players’ shots, and chase players down, swoop in and block their shots from behind, like Tayshaun Prince did to Reggie Miller’s potential game-tying basket in Game 2 of the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals—Russell’s chase down block on St. Louis Hawks’ guard Jack Coleman at the end of regulation in Game 7 of the 1957 NBA Finals saved the game for the Celtics, which they won in overtime. This caused players to be perpetually fearful of Russell, causing them to hesitate when they didn’t know where he was, trying to locate him lest he come out of nowhere to block their shot again. Tom Hawkins of the Cincinnati Royals dubbed it “Russellphobia”: “It’s a thing that happens to people when they play the Celtics,” he said during the 1964-65 season. “I have seen guys going in for an unmolested layup—I mean nobody near them—and just when they get up there, they suddenly look nervously over their shoulder for Russell to fall on them” (Bob Ottim, “The Panic Is On Again.” Sports Illustrated, Nov 9, 1964). “One time I got around Heinsohn and went in for a lay-up and Russell blocked it,” said Bob Pettit. “Later I got around Heinsohn again, went in for the layup and again Russell blocked it. The next time I got around Heinsohn and went in for the layup, Russell was nowhere near me, but I missed the shot because I was looking for him” (Bob Pettit with Bob Wolff, Bob Pettit: The Drive Within Me, pp. 79-80).\n\nThe problem was compounded by the fact that Russell “block[ed] as many shots away from the basket as underneath it […]” (Alan Paul, “MVP.” SLAM Magazine, Dec 6, 2010). “Bill Russell used to be able to go out and block shots,” said Marty Blake, NBA Director of Scouting Services in an interview conducted for the NBA’s 50th anniversary. “You’ve got to differentiate that from Wilt Chamberlain, who would block the shots coming to the basket, but Russell would go out and deter you from shooting.” “Russell would chase you everywhere,” said Johnny “Red” Kerr, who played 12 seasons with the Syracuse Nationals, Philadelphia 76ers and Baltimore Bullets from 1954-55 to 1965-66. “I’ve taken 20-footers that were blocked by Russell” (Johnny Kerr & Terry Pluto, Bull Session: An Up-Close Look at Michael Jordan and Courtside Stories About the Chicago Bulls, pp. 111-12). In addition, Russell had the quickness to double-team and trap, help on the pick-and-roll, help a teammate when his man got by him, and still recover back. He also had the timing to block shots as soon as the ball left a shooter’s hand, so he wouldn’t bite on pump fakes, but waited until the shooter released the ball. “He had a great skill of not ever being faked into the air,” said Pete Newell. “If you ever see a picture of him, you’d always see a flexed knee. […] I don’t think I ever saw a guy pump-fake him in the air and shoot over Russell” (Mark Heisler, Giants: The 25 Greatest Centers of All Time, pp. 14, 17).\n\nAnd Russell brought a psychology to it all. “Properly applied it was as much psychological as actual,” Russell said (Go Up For Glory, p. 157). “[Y]ou don’t try to block every shot. What you try to do is intimidate your opponent with the idea that you might block any shot” (pp. 123-24). He knew it was physically impossible to block every shot—he conceded he could only block 8-10% at most, so he set up residence in opposing shooters’ heads so that he could alter shots without even having to be physically present. Elvin Hayes, who retired in 1984 having played more games (1,303) of anyone in NBA history, said of Russell that he was “the most intimidating force in the history of basketball. Even without blocking a shot. He could mess up your mind or your shot just by being out there” (Thomas Bonk, “Hayes Ends An Era.” Eugene Register-Guard, Apr 13, 1984).\n\nOf all the greats in the NBA’s all-time top ten, Russell is the only one to dominate the game without the ball in his hands. He blocked shots to teammates, and when he grabbed a rebound, “No one should ever forget that Bill’s purpose in getting the ball was to give it to his teammates” (K.C. Jones with Jack Warner, Rebound [Boston: Quinlan Press, 1986], p. 85). “To this day, no one can match his defense,” wrote Thomas Boswell of The Washington Post. “If you had to pick an all-time team to play for your life, you might pick Russell above anyone, even Michael Jordan, because of his fire, his brains, his leadership. Of course, you’d only take Russ first if you could pick great scorers later. Then you’d have Bill, the only player for whom there’s no ‘comparable'” (The Washington Post, Jun 12, 2002).\n\nIn March 1999, I was in Boston for the announcement of the May tribute to re-retire my number. The Celtics asked me if I would speak to the present team, which, at that point, were on a nine-game losing streak and were not playing together as a unit. You may be thinking, how does a guy old enough to be a modern player’s grandfather connect and communicate with guys on that team? The answer is in finding common ground.\n\nI began by telling them that despite that so much had been written about me being the most unselfish player, I was the most egotistical player they would ever meet. All kinds of nervous smiles were coming back at me from people who were not sure what was coming next. These smiles disappeared when I said, “Do you know the difference between your ego and mine? My ego is not a personal ego, it’s a team ego. My ego demands—for myself—the success of my team. My personal achievement became my team achievement. The single greatest disappointment in my career was when I was hurt and we didn’t win a twelfth title.” These talented young players all looked at me with strange expressions on their faces. I could almost read their minds. Here was Bill Russell, the guy with eleven championship rings on his ten fingers, telling them that the only thing that mattered to him was how his team did. But that’s exactly was I was saying. Thirty-plus-years later, the only regret I have are about those two years when the Celtics didn’t win. My career was never about personal statistics. It was never about contracts or money. I never paid attention to MVP awards or how many endorsements I had lined up—only how many titles we won.\n\n(Bill Russell with David Falkner, Russell Rules: 11 Lessons on Leadership From the Twentieth Century’s Greatest Winner [New York: Dutton, 2001], pp. 37-38)\n\nThat same year, Frank Deford wrote in Sports Illustrated, “The finest team player ever is by nature a loner who, by his own lights, achieved such group success because of his abject selfishness. You will never begin to understand Bill Russell until you appreciate that he is, at once, consistent and contradictory” (Frank Deford, “The Ring Leader: The greatest team player of all time, Bill Russell was the hub of a Celtics dynasty that ruled its sport as no other team ever has.” Sports Illustrated, May 10, 1999). “Arrogant yet cooperative, selfless but self-assured—such were the complex endowments of the greatest center of all time,” Ken Shouler wrote (The Experts Pick Basketball’s Best 50 Players in the Last 50 Years, p. 153).\n\nRussell’s simple key to a successful team was to encourage each player to do what he did best. “Remember,” he says, “each of us has a finite amount of energy, and things you do well don’t require as much. Things you don’t do well take more concentration. And if you’re fatigued by that, then the things you do best are going to be affected.” The selfishness of successful team play—”I was very selfish,” he declares—sounds paradoxical, but a team profits if each player revels in his strength. Still, Russell points out, there is a fine line between idealistic shared greed and typical self-gratification. “You must let your energy flow to the team,” he says.\n\n(Frank Deford, “The Ring Leader: The greatest team player of all time, Bill Russell was the hub of a Celtics dynasty that ruled its sport as no other team ever has.” Sports Illustrated, May 10, 1999)\n\nSince his ego demanded the success of his team, he concentrated his energies and focused his efforts towards making his teammates better for the express purpose of bringing about victory for his team. “I always thought that the most important measure of how good a game I’d played was how much better I’d made my teammates play,” Russell said (Second Wind, p. 149). “He approached the game in a way modern athletes would find very difficult to appreciate,” said Tom Heinsohn. “He wasn’t about me, me, me. He was about team, team, team” (Boston Globe, May 27, 1999). Russell’s approach is also difficult for the modern fan to appreciate as well. But enabling each player to better do what he did best was in his own best interest because it enabled him to achieve the standard by which he judged himself:\n\nMy approach was it’s a team game. And the only important stat, if you want to call it that, is the final score. And so I was only interested in winning. But that goes back to my high school and college days. […] My junior year in college, I had what I thought was the one of the best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the MVP at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man. So I made a conscious decision: “What I’ll do is I will try my very best to win every game. So when my career is finished it will be a historical fact I won these games, these championships, and there’s no one’s opinion how good I am or how good other guys are or comparing things.” And so as I chronicle my career playing basketball, I played organized basketball for 21 years and I was on 18 championship teams. So that’s what my standard is: playing a team game and my team winning.\n\n“He saw early that the key to basketball was not individual statistics, but winning the game,” said Bill Bradley. “Armed with that knowledge, he applied his enormous competitive energies to orchestrating victory” (Life on the Run, p. 183). “I used to tell people I thought Bill Russell had a neurotic need to win,” said Heinsohn, who came in the league the same year Russell did in 1956-57 and played nine seasons with him before retiring after the 1964-65 season. “They’d laugh, but I wasn’t trying to be funny. You talk about being obsessed! There are very few men in everyday America who’d be willing to put into their jobs what Russell put into his” (Tommy Heinsohn and Joe Fitzgerald, Give ’em the Hook, p. 99). “None of us had ever seen a more dominant player,” said Gene Conley, who played three seasons with Russell from 1958-59 to 1960-61, winning three NBA titles, “a guy who wouldn’t let us lose” (Tall Tales, p. 341).\n\nIn the introduction to her book The Virtue of Selfishness, Ayn Rand wrote, “In popular usage, the word ‘selfishness’ is a synonym of evil; the image it conjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achieve his own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but the gratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment. Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word ‘selfishness’ is: concern with one’s own interests” (p. 5). In the article “Isn’t Everyone Selfish,” Nathaniel Branden wrote, “To be selfish is to be motivated by concern for one’s self-interest. This requires that one consider what constitute’s one’s self-interest and how to achieve it—what values and goals to pursue, what principles and policies to adopt. […] Selfishness entails: (a) a hierarchy of values set by the standard of one’s self-interest, and (b) the refusal to sacrifice a higher value to a lower one or to a nonvalue” (Ayn Rand, The Virtue of Selfishness, pp. 53-54). Russell valued winning above all else, and he steadfastly refused to sacrifice that for anything less. “In order to win you have to get yourself past a lot of things that may not be vital to winning but make you feel good, like scoring a lot of points,” Russell wrote in Second Wind. “You have to forgo the pleasure of proving a point, because what somebody else wants you to prove may be inconsistent with the way you should play to win” (p. 123). In his battles with arch-rival Wilt Chamberlain, Russell didn’t allow himself to become distracted from the primary goal. “What I had to do was discipline myself to never get in a numbers game with him,” said Russell. “In other words, if he gets 40, I gotta get 40. If he gets 30 rebounds, I gotta get 30 rebounds. Because then I’d be playing his game and not my game. And my game consisted of doing things that made my teammates effective.” His concern was making his team play better and the opposing team play worse (Second Wind, p. 149) so that his could win. “I never knew what my statistics were and I didn’t care,” Russell said. “I felt it was about creating an atmosphere in which my team couldn’t lose” (Bill Russell with Alan Steinberg, Red and Me: My Coach, My Lifelong Friend, pp. 68-69).\n\n“A genuine selfishness—that is: a genuine concern with discovering what is to one’s self-interest, an acceptance of the responsibility of achieving it, a refusal to ever betray it by acting on the blind whim, mood, impulse or feeling of the moment, an uncompromising loyalty to one’s judgment, convictions and values—represents a profound moral achievement,” Branden wrote (Ayn Rand, The Virtue of Selfishness, p. 56). Russell is the exemplar par excellence of rational self-interest. He wrote in Second Wind, “The Celtics played together because we all knew that it was the best way to win. […] [I]f individual combat would have won championships, we’d have been fighting each other” (p. 127). It was a pragmatic realization of what needed to be done in order to bring about victory in a team sport. “Burning pride in his accomplishments pushes Russell to the heights” (The Telegraph-Herald, May 27, 1961), and his accomplishments are the accomplishments of his team. This explains the seeming paradox of how he could be—in his own words—”very selfish,” yet the greatest team player of all time without any contradiction. No one was more single-mindedly dedicated to winning as Russell was. “Winning was my life,” Russell said. “There was nothing subjective about that. And how I contributed to that achievement or helped others succeed was the only goal. […] I didn’t have to have the ball to be effective, or help others be effective, because it was what I did that was invisible that made the greatest contribution” (The Perfect Team: The Best Players, Coach and GM—Let the Debate Begin!, p. 231). Since his team’s achievement was his personal achievement, it was in his interest to help others be effective so that his team could win. To that end he scouted his teammates in order to be able to play to their strengths and cover their weaknesses. “The highest compliment you can pay a man is that he made other people around him better,” said John Havlicek. “Russell did that more than anyone else. Ever” (Ken Shouler, The Experts Pick Basketball’s Best 50 Players in the Last 50 Years, p. 154). “We were the players we were because of Russell,” said Satch Sanders. “We also rose higher because of him. […] Russell made people more effective. We all added to our games because of him” (ibid).\n\nRussell ensured that his teammates could play their games better, while doing whatever else the team needed in order to win. Russell led the team in scoring during the ’62 postseason and Finals—scoring 30 points and grabbing 40 rebounds in the deciding Game 7 in which his entire frontcourt fouled out—and ’66 Finals. After Bob Cousy retired in 1963, Russell realized that since K.C. Jones couldn’t run an offense like Cousy could, he would have to change his game to pass more “to ensure the offense kept its flow and motion” (Russell Rules, p. 167). Before Cousy’s retirement, Russell averaged 3.1 assists per game in 493 games. Afterwards, Russell averaged 5.0 assists per game in 470 games, passing for a (at the time) career-high 370 assists (9th in the league) the first year after Cousy’s retirement, and leading the team in assists in the 1965 and ’66 postseasons—since then, only Wilt Chamberlain (1967), Bill Walton (1977) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1994) duplicated Russell’s feat of leading their team in assists on title teams as centers. In the 1969 postseason, as the Celtics were about to face the New York Knicks in the Eastern Division Finals, Russell looked for clues as to what allowed the Knicks to have success against them during the regular season (6-1 against Boston), and noticed that he hadn’t shot much against the Knicks, which allowed Willis Reed to help out on defense and Walt Frazier to drive shooters toward Reed. “The answer for the play-offs was clear. Don’t give Willis Reed that kind of freedom. To break the defense, I needed to shoot the ball. It was as simple as that” (Russell Rules, pp. 123-24). And so Russell averaged 16.3 points against the Knicks in the Eastern Division Finals after averaging a career-low 9.9 points per game during the regular season and 11.3 against the Knicks, and the Celtics won in six.\n\nFor the first part of his rookie season, Havlicek was so unselfish that he would always pass the ball, even when he was wide open. He thought a team player is one who passes all the time, which is not true. A team player is simply one who does all he can to help the team win. This may mean shooting more, rebounding more, sitting on the bench more—anything. (Russell Rules, p. 124)\n\n“Russell’s greatest value was his capacity for comprehending precisely what he needed to do at a given moment, during a given night or a given series to best assist his team to victory” (Monte Poole, “Russell tops all-time playoff team.” Oakland Tribune, Jun 14, 2009). Russell did whatever it took in order for the team to win, because that’s what his ego demanded. “In team sports, individual ego can be detrimental and devisive, and unfortunately we see it too often around us in society and culture,” Russell said. “In sports, it’s defined by rewarding individual achievement in team sports” (Russell Rules, p. 38). The modern-day poster children of the divisiveness of individual ego are Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. After the Lakers won their first NBA title since the Showtime Era in 2000, Kobe wanted to win the scoring title and MVP award when the Lakers won with the offense going through Shaq—”We’re all like, ‘what’s he thinking about?'” one Laker said anonymously. “It’s not like we didn’t win the title last season. Doesn’t he know how he got his ring? No one expected this” (Mitch Lawrence, “An L.A. season of discontent.” New York Daily News, Jan 30, 2001); after being privately told by coach Phil Jackson a week into the 2000-01 season that he wanted Kobe to resume last season’s role of letting the offense go through Shaq and taking over during the last seconds of a possession or last minutes of a game, he said in an interview with ESPN The Magazine, “Turn my game down? I need to turn it up. I’ve improved. How are you going to bottle me up? I’d be better off playing somewhere else.” Meanwhile, Shaq said, “I have to be fed the ball. When the dog is fed, he’ll guard the yard. When he’s not, anybody can come in,” didn’t stay in shape, and delayed needed surgery on his toe until the 2002-03 preseason, saying, “I got hurt on company time, I’ll heal on company time.” In his 1993 book The Winner Within, former Lakers’ coach Pat Riley called it “The Disease of Me”: “When the Disease of Me afflicts the strongest members of a team, or even its coaches, they develop an overpowering belief in their own importance. Their actions virtually shout the claim, ‘I’m the one.’ They try to prove that they really are as important as the fawning press and idolizing fans think” (The Winner Within, p. 41). The Lakers were dethroned by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals, and after losing in five to the Detroit Pistons in the NBA Finals the following season, Shaq was traded to the Miami Heat. “It did not have to be this way, a dynasty shattered to bits by ego, pride and money,” wrote Howard Beck in The New York Times, “but that is the fate Jackson, Bryant and O’Neal sowed when individual agendas and personality clashes overwhelmed their fragile camaraderie” (Dec 24, 2004). “Petty but erosive forces usually attack whatever it is that makes a championship team special,” Russell wrote in Second Wind two decades prior. “[I]t’s much harder to keep a championship than to win one. After you’ve won once, some of the key figures are likely to grow dissatisfied with the role they play, so it’s harder to keep the team focused on doing what it takes to win” (p. 144). And that’s why Russell is the first choice in this project to build an all-time dream-team around. He “got it” better than any player in NBA history; unlike modern players, his ego “was only sated by team success” (Murray R. Nelson, Bill Russell: A Biography, p. 96), and his sole focus will be on doing whatever is necessary in order for the team to win. American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker John C. Maxwell said that “A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.” With Russell setting the tone, the rest of the team will follow his lead.\n\nI chose ’64 Russell because the team will be built around Russell’s rebounding and defense, and this was his best rebounding and defensive season. Russell wrote in Second Wind that he considered 1964 his best year (p. 154). He led the league with a career-best 24.7 rebounds per game, and also led the league with 21 games of 30 or more rebounds (second place, Wilt Chamberlain with four). Russell had the second-highest rebounding game of the season—Jerry Lucas with the NBA season high of 40 rebounds Feb. 29, 1964, and Chamberlain was the only other player to appear on the top ten, once:\n\n40 — Jerry Lucas, Cincinnati at Philadelphia, February 29, 1964\n\n36 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. Philadelphia, March 3, 1964\n\n34 — Bill Russell, Boston at St. Louis, November 9, 1963\n\n34 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. Baltimore, February 6, 1964\n\n33 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. Philadelphia, November 1, 1963\n\n33 — Bill Russell, Boston at Cincinnati, November 2, 1963\n\n33 — Bill Russell, Boston at New York, February 8, 1964\n\n33 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. San Francisco, February 15, 1964\n\n32 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. San Francisco, November 30, 1963\n\n32 — Wilt Chamberlain, San Francisco vs. Boston, January 7, 1964\n\n32 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. Cincinnati, January 10, 1964\n\n32 — Bill Russell, Boston vs. Detroit, March 8, 1964\n\nIn the postseason, Russell grabbed 23.3% of all available rebounds during the time he was on the floor:\n\nTRB%\n\n100 * (TRB * (Tm MP / 5)) / (MP * (Tm TRB + Opp TRB))\n\n100 * (272 * 480) / (451 * (628 + 615)) = 23.29\n\nLooking at the top rebound rates in NBA postseason history:\n\nNBA Single Season Playoff Records for Total Rebound Pct\n\nPlayer TRB% Year Team\n\n1.

Bill Russell 23.29 1964 BOS\n\nRussell’s 1964 would rank 10th on the list. Taking a closer look, Ben Wallace, who’s just ahead of Russell, averaged 2.6 blocked shots a game in the 2002 postseason. He had no games of double-figure blocked shots, not blocking more than five: 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4. Russell had at least two double-figure block games: Game 1 of the Eastern Division Finals against Cincinnati, and Game 1 of the NBA Finals against San Francisco. Going up the list in ascending order, George Johnson and Dwight Howard are the only players who were shot-blockers. And Reggie Evans didn’t even play 20 minutes a game—he averaged 18.9 minutes and 7.4 rebounds a game in the 2005 postseason, and 18.0 minutes and 7.3 rebounds a game in the 2012 postseason.\n\nJohnson averaged 2.29 blocks in 23.6 minutes per game in the 1981 postseason, leading the playoffs in block percentage (5.7). Howard averaged 2.61 blocks in the 2009 postseason, leading the playoffs in blocks (60). The following postseason Howard led the playoffs in blocks for the second consecutive year (49), averaging 3.5 blocks a game and led the playoffs with an 8.1 block percentage, up from 5.3 the previous postseason. But his rebound percentage dropped from 24.5 to 19.4, and his rebounds per game went from 15.3 to 11.1. No one on the list who grabbed a higher percentage of rebounds during a postseason than Russell did in ’64 blocked as many shots as he did. More about shotblocking and rebounding opportunities here.\n\nRussell has the top six single seasons in NBA history in terms of defensive win shares, with 1963-64 standing atop the list:\n\nRank Player DWS Season Tm\n\n1.

Bill Russell 11.33 1960-61 BOS\n\nIt was his first season without Bob Cousy, who retired the previous year. Prior to the season, Dell Pro Basketball/Hockey/Football 1964 wrote of the upcoming season:\n\nBill Russell is the man who revolutionized basketball. This year he takes on a new role: Full responsibility for keeping the old regime in power.\n\nIt’s not really a change in Russell, but a change in circumstances.\n\nIn 1956, his arrival at center of the already high-scoring Boston Celtics transformed a perennial near-miss team into a perennial champion. Since then, the Celtics have finished first in the Eastern Division seven years in a row. In six of them they’ve gone on to win basketball’s World Series, the playoffs. The one year they missed—1958—they missed because Russell sprained an ankle and couldn’t play in the deciding games.\n\nBut it wasn’t Russell alone that made the Celtics the Yankees of basketball; it was the combination of Russell and Bob Cousy. Before Russell came, Cousy was already established as a wizard playmaker, a great scorer, and outstanding leader. Russell provided the element Cousy missed—possession of the ball.\n\nNow, however, Cousy has retired. Will the Celtics, hailed as the best basketball team ever assembled when both Russell and Cousy were present, maintain their dominance of the league? They didn’t dominate it when they had Cousy but no Russell; will they now with Russell and no Cousy?\n\nThat’s the fundamental question of the 1963-64 pro basketball season.\n\nThe Celtics won one more game without Cousy than they did with him the previous season, and their SRS improved from 6.38 points better than average to 6.93 points better than average. In the Eastern Division Finals, the Celtics faced the Cincinnati Royals, who extended them to seven games the previous season and were the choice to upend the Celtics’ reign. “I’m not exactly what you’d call an impartial witness,” said Cousy before the series. “But my personal feeling is that Boston is going to have less trouble with Cincinnati this year than it did last season. I like the Celtics in five games—six at the most. And I haven’t forgotten that the Royals made us go the full distance against them a year ago. […] Bill Russell is the key to the whole thing. If he has a great series, the Celtics could beat Cincinnati in five. If he’s just good, it’s going to take Boston a little longer” (Tuscaloosa News, March 31, 1964).\n\nThe Celtics dispatched the Royals in five, with Russell averaging 15 points and 29.2 rebounds. Cincinnati was the league’s highest-scoring team during the regular season at 114.7 points per game, and averaged 118.4 in the previous round against Syracuse. But in what Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford called “the best sustained defense ever put up by a pro team,” Boston held them to 93.2 points per game—an 18.7 percent decrease, and held league MVP Oscar Robertson—who averaged 30.4 points on 53.6% shooting and 65.7% true shooting, 8.2 rebounds and 11.2 assists in the previous round—to 28.2 points on 39.8% shooting and 49.6% true shooting, 9.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists. In the first game, Russell had a triple-double of 18 points, 31 rebounds and 11 blocked shots in leading Boston to a 103-87 win, shutting out the Royals for the first five minutes of the game, snuffing Jack Twyman, Wayne Embry and Robertson. And after the Royals won Game 4 after falling behind 3-0 to avoid a sweep, Russell had 20 points, 35 rebounds, seven assists, six blocked shots and three steals to close the door on the Royals 109-95. “The Boston Celtics are like a classic automobile—to be altered only when they can be functionally improved,” wrote Phil Elderkin of the Christian Science Monitor. “They sometimes seem to do things backward, like emphasizing defense in what everybody knows is a shooter’s game. But it is also a fact that a good defensive team can have a poor offensive night and still win. That is, providing it has a center named Bill Russell” (The Christian Science Monitor, Apr. 11, 1964).\n\nIn the NBA Finals against archrival Wilt Chamberlain and the San Francisco Warriors, Russell limited MVP runner-up Chamberlain to 29.2 points on 51.7% shooting and 50.9% true shooting after Chamberlain averaged 38.6 points on 55.9% shooting and 56.3% true shooting in the Western Division Finals against the St. Louis Hawks, as the Celtics also defeated the Warriors in five. In the first game, Russell had a near triple-double of nine points and game highs of 25 rebounds and 11 blocked shots, holding Chamberlain completely scoreless for 21 consecutive minutes through the second and third quarters. In one sequence, Russell blocked a fadeaway by Chamberlain, and when Nate Thurmond grabbed the loose ball and took it back up to dunk it, Russell blocked that too. Chamberlain finished with 22 points for 9-for-20 shooting, but “only 13 of them came while Russell was in the game” (Beaver County Times, Apr 20, 1964). “Bill played a helluva game,” Chamberlain said afterwards. In the deciding Game 5, Russell had 14 points, 26 rebounds, a team-high six assists and seven blocked shots, and after Chamberlain cut it to 101-99 with 19 seconds left, Russell grabbed the offensive rebound of a Tom Heinsohn miss and dunked it for the clinching basket as the Celtics won 105-99 for their sixth consecutive NBA title—an all-time pro sports record, eclipsing the five straight won by baseball’s New York Yankees (1949-53) and hockey’s Montreal Canadiens (1956-60). And so the question of whether the Celtics would continue to dominate with Russell and no Cousy was answered: Yes. Russell would go on to win four more titles without Cousy to end his career with a grand total of 11.\n\nJerry West wrote of the ’63-64 Celtics:\n\nCousy, Ramsey, and Jim Loscutoff retired, and Willie Naulls was the only player of consequence they added, but I honestly believe this was the best team I’ve seen since I’ve been in the NBA.\n\nCousy was great. Unfortunately, I saw him only at the end of his career when he undoubtedly was past his peak, but I could see why he was regarded as the most spectacular little man ever to play in the NBA. He was a brilliant and flashy ballhandler and the greatest long passer I ever saw, though Oscar was and is the best short passer. Bob was also well regarded as a person, sort of the unofficial spokesman for the players in the league, so Boston undoubtedly missed his leadership. But he did not seem to me to be an outstanding defensive ball player and when Boston got K. C. Jones into the regular lineup, and off the bench where he was being wasted, the Celtics’ defense became tough all over the court, their greatest asset, and their team play seemed to pick up.\n\n(Jerry West with Bill Libby, Mr. Clutch: The Jerry West Story [Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969], p. 122)\n\nIn an article for Sports Illustrated in 1969, Russell said, “I think our 1963-64 team was the best [Sanders, K. C. Jones, Heinsohn, Ramsey, Sam Jones, Havlicek, Russell]. It was easily the best defensive team we ever had—maybe that’s why it’s my favorite—and maybe the best of all time. I rate it best despite the fact that it was only good offensively, not great. Maybe that’s the key to it. We knew our offensive shortcomings and we worked hard to overcome them.”\n\nOn Basketball-Reference.com, Neil Payne took a look at the ’63-64 Celtics in “Anatomy of a Champion.” Payne wrote,\n\nDespite winning all of those championships, the Celtics were not a strong offensive team during the early 1960s. After finishing last in the league in FG% in 1961 and 1963 with Cousy at the helm, Boston was at it again in ’64, ending the year ranked 9th out of 9 teams. The Celtics’ 2nd-ranked 113.0 PPG was merely an illusion of pace — Boston easily took the most FGAs of any team in basketball, 654 more than Philadelphia, the next-closest team. […] Luckily, the Celtics weren’t especially interested in keeping their FG% up, as long as their opponent’s FG% was kept way down.\n\nThe ’64 Celtics only shot 37.9% against Cincinnati, but held Cincinnati—who shot 48.4% the previous series—to 35.2%. They shot 40.7% in the Finals against San Francisco, but held San Francisco—who shot 45.0% the previous series—to 39.3% shooting. The ’64 Celtics were the worst-shooting team in the postseason at 39.3%, but they won the title because they held their opposition to 37.2% shooting. Which proved the truth about what Phil Elderkin said about a good defensive team being able to have a poor offensive night and still win so long as it had Bill Russell at center. “When I came to the Celtics, I believed that it was possible to win games with defense alone,” Russell said. “My team made me a prophet in my own time” (Russell Rules, p. 122).\n\nI see many people choose 1962 for Russell because it was his best scoring season. But if scoring were the priority, then most people wouldn’t choose Russell in the first place. Since I’m choosing him for his rebounding and defense, I’m selecting the best rebounding and defensive season of the best defensive player ever, in which he anchored the greatest defensive team relative to era in NBA history.\n\n2006-07 Steve Nash\n\nNash fills Bob Cousy‘s role of recipient of Russell’s outlet passes and controlled blocks, and orchestrator of the fast break. Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News wrote, “In all the big ways, even looking smaller than the height at which he is listed, he is the modern version of Bob Cousy” (May 29, 2010). “Bill Russell told ABC viewers during Monday’s Phoenix-San Antonio halftime that NBA MVP Steve Nash reminds him of Bob Cousy. ‘When he was running the fast break, you knew you were going to get a shot,’ Russell said. ‘There was incentive to run. That’s the same thing Steve Nash does for Phoenix’ ” (The Telegraph, Jun 4, 2005).\n\nIn 1991, Sports Illustrated ran an article by Jack McCallum entitled “The Breaks of the Game: Is the Old-Fashioned Fast Break an Endangered Species, or is it Just in Hibernation?” Terry Pluto continued on the subject in Chapter 7 of his 1995 book Falling From Grace, entitled “Stranglers on the Sidelines.” It began with Bob Cousy saying that while modern day players were more physically equipped to play the running game, they actually ran less than they did in his era. The problem was the coaches restricting the players and micromanaging from the sidelines.\n\nIn June of 2004, Steve Nash signed with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent; in the 2004-05 season he sparked the greatest offensive turnaround in NBA history as the Suns went from 94.2 points per game in 2003-04 (11th) to a league-leading 110.4 points per game in ’04-05 with Nash, a record increase of 16.2 points per game. Their offensive rating improved from 101.4 (21st in the league) to 114.5 (1st), an improvement of 13.1 points per 100 possessions. The Suns improved from 29-53 before Nash to an NBA-best record of 62-20 with Nash, a 33-game turnaround that ranked as the third-greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history, behind the 35-game turnaround of the 1989-90 San Antonio Spurs and the 36-game turnaround of the 1997-98 Spurs. In the process, he sparked a fast break renaissance. In his Book of Basketball, Bill Simmons credited Nash with helping to bring back the dying art forms of passing and fast breaks. Writers such as Dennis Hans of the New York Times wrote that the Nash-led Suns were a “homage to much faster times.” “I love watching Phoenix because it reminds me of the [’80s] Lakers,” said Magic Johnson, “just dominating as far as the fast break is concerned, and they’re forcing everyone else to try to be up-tempo. Even [today’s] Lakers are trying to run. The question is whether [the Suns] can do it like [the Showtime Lakers] did it in the playoffs. Will they let teams slow them down in the playoffs? We never let that happen. I hope that they [keep running] because a lot of fans enjoy their style.”\n\nBut despite the crowd-pleasing style of play, and the desire of fans, writers and former players to see the Suns win a championship and reverse the trend that began with the Bad Boy Pistons’ consecutive titles, the Suns could never get over the hump. After Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum spent the 2005-06 season following the Suns as an assistant coach, documenting their day-to-day activities and writing about it, he was interviewed by Gelf magazine:\n\nGM: NBA writers/commentators frequently allude to the old NBA adage that “defense wins championships.” After spending a year watching the Suns, do you get the feeling that this is true? Do you believe a team like Phoenix (or past Dallas teams) could win a title by following D’Antoni’s system?\n\nJM: Providing a three-word adage, no matter what it is, is far too simplistic. The Heat won last year because Dwyane Wade morphed into Michael Jordan. The Spurs and Pistons won partly because they could lock you down and partly because they could score in the halfcourt a high percentage of the time. The D’Antoni system could absolutely produce a champion. The Suns are not a horrific defensive team, don’t forget, merely an average one. If the system doesn’t produce a champion, it’s not because the system is essentially flawed; it’s because other teams were better.\n\nGM: So if the system can work, and it’s just a matter of trying to match up well against other playoff teams, how might D’Antoni tweak the team’s roster to get the team to the Finals?\n\nJM: Two ways. Suddenly turn Stoudemire or Boris Diaw into a defensive, rebounding force. Or get a guy like that. Now, I agree that isn’t easy. Kurt Thomas is that guy but, when he plays big minutes, the Suns worry that he takes too much away from their seven-second style.\n\nRussell is the “defensive, rebounding force” Nash needed but never had. Russell would do for Nash what he did for Bob Cousy, who won six NBA titles after Russell came on board. “He was super box office; he did things with a flourish,” Hall of Fame coach Alex Hannum of Cousy. “But he didn’t play very good defense” (Eugene Register-Guard, May 25, 1979). “Auerbach called Cousy ‘electrifying.’ He said his one-time guard could do it all. ‘He could run, shoot and pass,’ said his former boss. ‘Defense? Well … he didn’t have to. He had ‘the boy’ the back of him.’ ” (Auburn Citizen, 1980). “Cousy […] never was a good defensive player,” said Hall of Fame guard Slater Martin, who played 11 years in the league with the Minneapolis Lakers, New York Knicks and St. Louis Hawks. “With Russell, he never had to worry about guarding anyone, and he never did. If his man drove by Cousy, he’d just run down to the other end of the court knowing that Russell would get the rebound and throw one of those great outlet passes for him” (Terry Pluto, Tall Tales, pp. 345-46). Nowadays no one even talks about Cousy’s defense. Many don’t even know it was ever an issue.\n\n“Bob Cousy was a great teammate. But in our approaches to the game, he and I were complete opposites,” said Russell.\n\nI approached the game defense first, then offense. He approached the game offense first and then, maybe, some defense. I never had a negative thought about that—he was always a great team player and a really good guy. But you can’t win championships with just an offensive approach. Over our time together, I think I helped him appreciate that because, years later, he told me that his most lasting memory of our first championship together was a defensive play I made. After I watched him play a dozen games or so, and had a few brief conversations with him to learn more about his approach, I figured out how to help him to help us win more games. If we were on defense and his man got by him, I’d slide over and pick him up to keep him from getting a layup. On offense, after I’d get a rebound, I’d start deliberately looking for Cousy to get him outlet passes to start fast breaks. Probably a third of the shots I blocked for Cousy were off his men. But I never criticized him, behind his back or to his face.\n\nThe way I looked at it was that his flaws on defense triggered our offense. I’d block a shot and outlet it and get it going the other way, turning it into a strength. Also, it demonstrated to the other guys that if their man got by them, I’d be there to back them up, too, and I would never complain about it. Instead, I would find a way to incorporate their defensive lapses into our offensive system. I think that was one of my most gratifying contributions to the team. And Red perceived that.\n\nAfter I’d been there about a month, Cousy walked over to me in practice and said, “I know when you get a rebound, you look for me. So what I’ll do is, after they take a shot and you rebound it, I’ll go to that spot over there. Look for me there first.” He had started to appreciate what I was doing for him. By the end of that year, our team scoring average was the highest in franchise history. That was based on my defensive rebounding and outlet passing, mostly to Cousy. The other team would shoot and, four seconds later, we’d be making a layup at the other end. But, really, all I did was help Cousy do better what he did best.\n\n(Bill Russell with Alan Steinberg, Red and Me: My Coach, My Lifelong Friend [New York: HarperCollins, 2009], pp. 129-31)\n\nRussell made it so that Cousy’s defense wasn’t a problem, and enabled Cousy to do what he did best. Likewise, Russell will make it so that Nash’s defense isn’t a problem, enabling Nash to do what he does best. Looking at the Phoenix Suns and the Boston Celtics pre-Russell, there’s a parallel to be drawn between the two teams. At the beginning of the 1954-55 season, Lou Chapman of the Milwaukee Sentinel wrote that there “isn’t a team—in college or in the play-for-pay ranks—that can match the Celtics’ offensive.” He continued, “you’d think a team with such a terrific potential would be making a shambles of the league standings. But the Celts have a .500 record on 12-12—good for only third in the NBA’s Western Division. What’s the Eastern team’s Achilles heel? A porous defense” (The Milwaukee Sentinel, Dec 23, 1954). After the Syracuse Nationals defeated the Celtics 116-110 in Game 2 of the Eastern Division Finals that season, the Associated Press wrote, “The Boston Celtics have Easy Ed Macauley, Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman. But they don’t have much defense and as a result the Syracuse Nationals have a 2-0 lead in their best-of-5 playoff for the Eastern championship of the National Basketball Assn.” (The Telegraph, Mar 25, 1955). (The Celtics lost the series in four.) That sounds exactly like what was said about the Suns. After the Celtics traded for Russell, Bill Gates of the Christian Science Monitor wrote, “with Russell entering the picture, the Celtics’ one glaring weakness—defense—should be alleviated considerably” (Christian Science Monitor, Dec 17, 1956). It was. “Russell’s tremendous skills in rebounding, defense, and shot blocking were exactly what we needed and we started a dynasty that has not been equaled or matched in any other professional sport today,” said Bill Sharman (Charles Salzberg, From Set Shot to Slam Dunk: The Glory Days of Basketball in the Words of Those Who Played It, p. 140). The difference between the two teams is the fact that the Celtics got Russell and the Suns didn’t. “Once we got Russell, end of story,” said Cousy. “To ultimately win, I doubt whether you can win with only offense” (The New York Times, Apr 22, 2005). That was exactly what Russell said: you can’t win championships with just an offensive approach. Russell would have given the Suns exactly what they needed as well, but he played during the late-50’s and the 1960s, not the 2000’s.\n\nOn the Phoenix Suns subforum on RealGM one Suns fan said, “the team needs a superior defender who is ON court, someone who runs the defense like nash runs the offense.” Another replied, “I really like your thought of someone leading the team defensively the same way Nash leads offensively.” Russell is that player. Russell and Nash would have a symbiotic relationship, Russell making the team better defensively, while Nash makes the team better offensively. Russell was so dominant defensively that he was able to lead the Celtics to title after title after title despite below-average offenses. Nash ran historically great offenses in Phoenix, but didn’t have enough defense to win. Together they’re the perfect complementary pairing.\n\nWith Russell, Nash can play the exciting brand of ball that aficionados of fast-break basketball want to see, and—with Russell providing interior defense and rebounding—run and gun all the way to multiple NBA championships, silencing the naysayers who say an up-tempo style of basketball can’t win in the postseason.\n\n1994-95 Reggie Miller\n\nMiller is an amalgamation of Bill Sharman and Sam Jones. Sharman led the league in free-throw percentage a record seven times and shot 88.3% from the line for his career (3,143 of 3,559). Miller led the league in free-throw percentage five times—third all-time behind Sharman and Rick Barry—and shot 88.8 percent from the line for his career (6,237 of 7,026). Bob Cousy said of Sharman, “He was in constant motion, running the court in a circle and running his defensive man into picks. Eventually, he either ran his man into the ground or wiped him out on a pick and was open. Then his shot was automatic” (Terry Pluto, Tall Tales, p. 114). The same is true of Miller, “the most tireless offensive player since John Havlicek, always running, always forcing the defense to account for his whereabouts” (Mark Kriegel, “In the End, It’s Reggie Again.” New York Daily News, Jun 2, 1999).\n\nWhen asked to give his all-clutch team, Wilt Chamberlain replied, “Sam Jones. Jerry West had the reputation of being a clutch shooter, but I don’t think he wanted the ball as much as everyone wanted him to have it. He didn’t beg for the last shot. Sam Jones wanted it. The man had ice in his veins. I’ve never seen a guy shoot the big ones like him” (Scott Osler, “Wilt the Stilt: Chamberlain Holds Court.” Anchorage Daily News, Jan 9, 1982). Chamberlain spoke from experience, being on the wrong end of two Sam Jones game-winners in the NBA Finals in 1962 and 1969. Reggie Miller is also one of the most clutch shooting guards in NBA history, joining Jones, West, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant.\n\nMany of Miller’s contemporaries have lauded his ability to step up in the clutch. “He’s one of the greatest clutch players I’ve ever seen, if not the greatest,” said Isiah Thomas. “I think you’ve got to rank him up there with Jordan, in terms of guys who can just make it from anywhere” (New York Daily News, May 3, 2002). “I’ve never seen a better clutch shooter in my life than Reggie,” said Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown, who played pro basketball for four seasons from 1967-68 to 1971-72 and coached Miller from 1993 to 1997 (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jun. 7, 2001). “Larry Bird once paid Miller the ultimate compliment, noting that when coaching the Pacers he often had the urge to insert himself into the lineup at the end of games. But alluding to Miller, Bird added, ‘I’d probably put myself in to pass him the ball’ ” (Indianapolis Star, Apr. 20, 2005). In a 2005 interview with Marvin R. Shanken, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado, Michael Jordan named Reggie Miller as the best clutch player of his contemporaries. On RealGM, ElGee wrote about how Miller raised his scoring in the postseason from the regular season higher than anyone, and did so against the most difficult group of defenses. Jordan and Kobe will have their own teams, and Miller, unlike Jones or West, played in the modern era with the three-point line. West is the better player, but the objective isn’t to make the team too “stacked.”\n\nI like pairing Miller with Russell because, together, neither one would have to do anything different from what they actually did on their respective teams. Russell will set picks for Miller the same way he did for Bill Sharman, Sam Jones, and John Havlicek. “My game is, going to the boards, setting picks and blocks for our shooters, and scoring a little myself” (The Christian Science Monitor, Apr. 4, 1968). “Russell didn’t score a point for the Celtics, but his picks from the high post keyed the Boston attack” (Hartford Courant, May 6, 1969). “Boston Garden fans were thrilled and excited by seeing No. 6 sail above the players for rebounds, leap with perfect timing to block shots, unselfishly set picks for teammates and in doing so bring Boston 11 World Championships in 13 years” (The Telegraph, Aug. 1, 1969). And Miller will come off those picks to hit shots just as he did for the Pacers. Unlike the case for many people’s Dream Teams, playing together won’t require either player to have to change their games—an important aspect that is never taken into consideration. And the fact that he doesn’t need the ball to score makes him a perfect backcourt mate for Nash, since he won’t take the ball out of his hands. Russell, Nash and Miller are a synergistic trio as none of them will have to play any differently than they actually did in order to play together. All they have to do is do what they do best.\n\nOn a thread entitled “Am I the only one who thinks Reggie Miller wasn’t that great?” on Yahoo Answers!, one person said of Miller, “what effectively separated him from the players of the upper echelon was his inability to create his own shot. His offensive repertoire consisted solely of running defenders off screens for wide open jumpers. He was more or less a Rip Hamilton with a longer range. To his credit, Reggie was an exceptional pure-shooter and clutch performer but his one-dimensional game and inadequacies in all other aspects of the game make him a second-tier star at best.” But that’s okay. There’s never been a team assembled in NBA history on which every player could “do it all.” In Second Wind, Russell wrote, “By design and by talent the Celtics were a team of specialists, and like a team of specialists in any field, our performance depended both on individual excellence and on how well we worked together. None of us had to strain to understand that we had to complement each other’s specialties; it was simply a fact, and we all tried to figure out ways to make our combination more effective” (pp. 126-27). When people pick their teams, most often they focus on choosing players who can “do it all” individually, never thinking instead about how each player can complement each other’s strengths and cover for their weaknesses. In Russell Rules, Russell wrote, “on our team, all of us—from the coach to the last guy on the bench—understood that the key shots at the end of the game were almost always going to be made by one player, Sam Jones. Every team needs a “go to” person, and Sam was ours. To win we knew we had to create the opportunity for him to take those shots…” (p. 9). Miller will be Russell’s closer, and since he isn’t a great off-the-dribble guard and is dependent on his teammates’ picks to get off his shot, Russell will get Miller open. Just as he did for Jones, he will create the opportunity for Miller to take the big shots: When Sam Jones hit the series-winner over Wilt Chamberlain in Game 7 of the 1962 Eastern Division Finals, it was Russell who set the pick to get him open.\n\nMiller also brings a je ne sais quoi to the team. “I love being the villain,” he said. “You’ve got to remember the NBA is the entertainment business, like Billy Joel or Michael Jackson. When we take the floor, we have to perform, entertain people. And I love being booed. It really gets me going. The bad guys are supposed to wear black. That’s OK. I’ll be the bad guy.” And he had the chutzpah—the cojones—to not back down from Jordan, which will be useful when going against a Jordan-led team, in addition to his “almost singular ability to get under Jordan’s ultra-cool skin” (The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 16, 1998). Miller wasn’t intimidated by Jordan, which is what I want in a shooting guard. “Reggie Miller’s not intimidated by Michael, and that’s the key,” Charles Barkley said in February of 1998 when asked if the Pacers could beat the Bulls in a seven-game playoff series. “Everybody says they’re not intimidated by Michael, but that’s not true” (Dave Anderson, “Sports of the Times: Has Garden Heard Last Boos for Barkley?” The New York Times, Feb 23, 1998). No, he isn’t better than Jordan, but he doesn’t have to be. All he has to do is what he’s on this team to do. Not being better than Jordan didn’t stop him from hitting a game-winner on him in a playoff game:\n\nHis was the only team to take Jordan’s Bulls to seven games during their championship years. And on this team he won’t have to carry the offensive load as he did on his Pacers team.\n\nIn Nash and Miller, I wanted to recreate the Cousy-Sharman backcourt. In the 1957-58 season, Carl Underwood wrote, “Russell leaves most of Boston’s shooting to such deadeyes as Bill Sharman and Bob Cousey […]” (Lodi News-Sentinel, Feb 26, 1958). On this team he can leave the shooting to such deadeyes as Reggie Miller and Steve Nash. They are the most efficient backcourt it is possible to assemble. They also give the team two “coolers,” Bill Simmons’ nickname “for elite FT shooters who ice games at the line” (The Book of Basketball, p. 340). Nash and Miller have a combined free-throw percentage of 89.8 percent. In the closing minutes of a close game where the opposing team is forced to foul, the ball will always be in the hands of one of the backcourtsmen. So if it comes down to a free-throw shooting contest, that will be one the opposition will be doomed to lose.\n\n1991-92 Larry Nance\n\nNash and Miller are my ideal starting backcourt for Russell, but they’re defensively lacking. So that means I need to choose for the frontcourt players who can defend and run the floor. That makes Nance the perfect fit at forward: he’s athletic (40″ vertical), can play defense, block shots, rebound, run the floor and finish on the break. None of the other running power forwards (e.g., Malone, Barkley, Tom Chambers) played defense on Nance’s level: two-time Second Team All-Defense, one-time First Team All-Defense. He blocked 2,027 shots in his 13-year career, averaging 2.20 per game, retiring eighth all-time and first among forwards. If facing a team with Patrick Ewing or Bob McAdoo in the pivot drawing Russell away from the paint, Nance is still there. If facing a team with Dirk Nowitzki at power forwards, pulling Nance away from the basket, Russell is there.\n\nI liked the idea of having dual shotblockers as the San Antonio Spurs had in Duncan and Robinson from 1997-98 to 2002-03. Robinson averaged 2.63 (5th in the league), 2.43 (9th), 2.29 (6th), 1.79 (15th), and 1.73 (16th) blocked shots per game, and Duncan 2.51 (6th), 2.52 (7th), 2.34 (9th), 2.48 (4th), and 2.93 (3rd). “Resonance” is defined as “the effect produced when the natural vibration frequency of a body is greatly amplified by reinforcing vibrations at the same or nearly the same frequency from another body.” RusseNance is the effect produced on opposing offenses and slashers when the frequency of shots blocked is amplified by reinforcement from an additional shotblocker. The St. Louis Hawks used to try to take Russell from under the basket with Clyde Lovellette. “No big man in the league shoots from outside like Clyde. If anybody can pull Russell away from those boards, Lovellette can” (Christian Science Monitor, Apr 7, 1961). “When he is bombing the basket from outside big Bill Russell must leave the under-the-basket area to go out and harass him. Russell’s periodic absence from under the basket allows the other Hawks to drive in with layups” (Williamson Daily News, Apr 8, 1961). That tactic won’t work against this team, as there’ll still be Nance to contend with.\n\nPhil Elderkin of The Christian Science Monitor wrote after Philadelphia acquired Wilt Chamberlain in 1965, “Russell can leave the pivot occasionally against other rivals to help out his teammates on defense. But he has to devote full coverage to Chamberlain — an edge which only Philadelphia enjoys against the Celtics” (Nov. 4, 1965). Four-time All-Star forward Rudy LaRusso, who played seven seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers from 1960-61 to ’66-67, said, “Because we didn’t have a talented center to occupy Russell, he could roam around on defense and help guard West and Baylor” (Terry Pluto, Tall Tales, p. 249). After Game 2 of the 1969 NBA Finals, which LA won 118-112 to take a 2-0 lead, Elgin Baylor said, “Russell can’t afford to come out and contest the ball as much as he did before. He has to stay back there and keep an eye on Wilt” (The Los Angeles Times, Apr 26, 1969). Here Russell will have Nance alongside him—a luxury he never had, so opposing teams will still have reason to worry if Russell’s occupied by his defensive assignment.\n\nOffensively, Nance has range on his shot out to 20 feet. “Nance […] expanded his career with an outside game that includes one of the league’s most accurate jump shots. ‘The jump shot has prolonged my career,’ Nance said. ‘I guess I was a slam dunker to rival them all, but now the jump shot is one of my major weapons’ ” (Herald-Journal, Feb 17, 1993). “[W]hen it’s falling […], the jumper allows me to fake and drive. And it opens up other things for other people” (South Florida Sun Sentinel, ‎May 13, 1992). He played seven seasons with Mark Price, who was the best pick-and-roller in the game, so he’ll be the primary pick-and-roll partner for Nash, who at one point was called “this era’s Mark Price, running two-man games, pick-and-roll and pushing the ball as well as anyone in the NBA” (Chicago Tribune, Nov 4, 2004).\n\nOn the Phoenix Suns subforum on RealGM, one Suns fan said:\n\nAmar’e Stoudemire was the perfect PnR partner. He could catch on the move, maneuver athletically, dunk with power, finish through contact, make free throws, and nail quick, high-release jumpers on the pick-and-pop. But his horrendous defense was perhaps the barrier that prevented the Nash-Stat Suns from breaking through in the playoffs. The Suns always lost to a team with an elite big who worked Stoudemire over.\n\nThere may not be a better PnR partner offensively. But it may be impossible to win a championship with Stat as a core part of your defensive frontline. Who is the best defensive upgrade who can get it done in the PnR with Nash?\n\nNance fits perfectly, filling Amaré Stoudermire’s role in the pick and roll with exponentially better defense. In order to have a fast-break team that’s also good defensively, Nance is the perfect fit at the 4. In 1991-92, Nance averaged 17.0 points on 53.9 percent shooting (10th in the league) and 58.6 percent true shooting (17th), 8.3 rebounds, 2.9 assists, a career-high 3 blocked shots (3rd [behind David Robinson (4.49) and Hakeem Olajuwon (4.34)]) and 0.99 steals in 35.6 minutes per game. He shot a career-best 82.2 percent from the line, led the league in lowest turnover percentage (6.9%), finished fourth in the league in offensive rating (career-best 124.9), ninth in offensive win shares (career-best 8.2) and 10th in win shares per 48 minutes (career-best .204), had a career-high in win shares (12.2—11th in the league), and was Second Team All-Defense.\n\nAfter being traded from the Phoenix Suns with Mike Sanders and a 1988 1st round draft pick to the Cavaliers for Tyrone Corbin, Kevin Johnson, Mark West, a 1988 1st round draft pick, 1988 2nd round draft pick and 1989 2nd round draft pick in February ’88, Nance’s center during his five seasons with the Cavs was Brad Daughterty. “I thought Daugherty, at times, he wasn’t a great defensive player,” said John “Hot Rod” Williams. “I thought, at times on defense, he wasn’t there for us. He could’ve blocked some shots that he didn’t. But he had me and Larry on either side and he had a lot of stuff from other people. Price knew that if his man got by, me and Larry were gonna try to block the shot. There weren’t a lot of layups. […] Teams had to beat us from the outside with big shots. Like the shot Michael Jordan beat us with. He knew he had to hit that shot.” On this team Nance’s center is the greatest defensive player of all time. “I like blocking shots more now than ever,” Nance said during the 1991-92 season. “I think the fact that we have a great shot-blocker like (Hot Rod) Williams makes me even better” (Akron Beacon Journal, Feb 26, 1992). On this team Nance will be even better with the greatest shot-blocker of all time as his frontcourt partner. He and Russell would form one of the greatest defensive tandems ever. During the 2012 off-season there was talk about Dwight Howard and Josh Smith coming together. Looking around the internet, this is a sample of what people had to say about the hypothetical pairing:\n\nCould you imagine him [Josh Smith] playing alongside Dwight Howard? Opposing players would think twice before even looking at the rim with Howard and Smith patrolling the front court together.\n\nPairing Josh Smith and Dwight Howard = No Layups and No Dunks.\n\nThe Magic would be nigh on impossible to score on with Josh roaming in front of Dwight. That would be one terrifying defensive team.\n\nDefense would be stellar with Smith and Howard. No layups ever.\n\nJosh Smith and Dwight would make up one of the best rim protecting duo’s in NBA History. Anything weak around the rim will be smacked outta there.\n\nA frontline of Howard and Smith is a definite no fly zone for slashers.\n\nA frontcourt tandem of Smith and Howard would be one of the most defensively dominant duos in NBA history.\n\na front court of Smith and Dwight would be [a] shotblocking nightmare and great on the open court.\n\nThe same would be the case with a Russell/Nance frontcourt. Russell is the original, while Dwight Howard was one of a long line of “next Bill Russells,” and Larry Nance was Josh Smith in the ’80s with the jumper Smith lacks, and without the questionable shot selection and low basketball IQ. “The No. 1 reason the Nash-Era Suns have never won a championship is because our defensive frontcourt has always hovered between mediocre and horrendous,” one Suns fan said on RealGM. “When was the last time a team won an NBA championship without an elite defensive frontcourt??” On this team, Nash will no longer have that problem.\n\n1975-76 Julius Erving\n\nWith Russell, Nash, Miller, and Nance, that leaves small forward as the position that the lead scorer would come from. The ideal player for that spot is Prime Dr. J, as in ABA Dr. J, complete with Afro, wearing #32 for the Nets.\n\nIn 1975-76, Erving had one of the greatest peaks ever. “Julius Erving is the best player I’ve ever seen outside of Bill Russell,” said New York Nets’ coach Kevin Loughery (Tonawanda Evening News, Jan 3, 1977). But most importantly, the reason why he’s the ideal choice is because he’s a team player.\n\nROD THORN: Of all the players I’ve been around, no one has had a more dramatic effect on his teammates, his league and even how the game is played than Julius. Jordan is a better overall player, because he can do some of the things that Doc couldn’t, and certainly Jordan has had a profound impact on pro basketball. But Julius was such a leader and he understood his position on the team and in the league as a spokesman. He knew that how he acted and what he did was very important.\n\nHe would do little things for the other guys on the team. In Larry Kenon’s rookie season, he was having a tough time and was depressed. After our pregame meeting one night, Julius told me, “Don’t worry about Kenon. I’ll take care of him.”\n\nEarly in the game, Doc had a clear lane for a dunk, but he spotted Kenon open and passed off so Kenon could dunk. By the end of the first quarter, Kenon had 12 points, most of them on passes from Julius. Kenon ended up with a 30-point night and was all smiles. After the game, Julius told the reporters about how great Kenon had played and how Kenon was very important to the team.\n\nJulius was aware that his teammates needed attention and a pat on the back. He also knew that reporters would come to him for quotes because he was so patient with everybody. So Julius would talk about different guys on the team and he did it sincerely, so it didn’t sound like he was just some star blowing smoke.\n\nAnother player Julius helped was Brian Taylor, a guard from Princeton who was a very sensitive kid. Brian sometimes felt as though he had gotten lost in Julius’s shadow. Julius would occasionally take him to dinner, talk to him and talk about Brian to the reporters. Julius just had a sense of what it meant to be a teammate.\n\n(Terry Pluto, Loose Balls: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990], pp. 320-21)\n\nThat’s the perfect attribute for a lead scorer on a Russell-led team. More important than simply the ability to put a lot of points on the board is being able to fit within the team concept. “Erving did whatever he could to help his team win and he may have been less interested in personal stats than just about any other player of comparable greatness” (David Friedman. “Re: Julius Erving on the Art of Knowing When to Dunk–And When Not to Dunk.” 20 Second Timeout. 30 Jun 2008). He would fit right in on a team led by Bill Russell. There isn’t an equal or better scorer who is as team-oriented, which makes him the only choice. He was the lead scorer for the Nets as he led them to two NBA titles, he fit in with Philadelphia when they had George McGinnis, Doug Collins and World B. Free, was the lead scorer again, and fit in with Moses Malone when he was acquired by the 76ers. He’s demonstrated a willingness to do what the team needs. But on this team he can be the #1 option. Unlike most (all?) all-time dream teams you see, there’s a clear offensive hierarchy, with Erving at the top, Miller #2, and Nance #3, with Nash distributing.\n\nKen Shouler said of Erving, “there may never have been a better player at going to the basket” (Ken Shouler, “One Hundred to Remember,” in Total Basketball: The Ultimate Basketball Encyclopedia, ed. Ken Shouler, Bob Ryan, Sam Smith, Leonard Koppett, and Bob Bellotti [Toronto: Sport Classic Books, 2003], p. 588). In 1979, Curry Kirkpatrick of Sports Illustrated wrote:\n\nDr. J’s game has always been one of refined speed, finesse and creativity and lightning movement in the open court when he elected to come down from the rafters and engage in man-to-man confrontations. What the pros call “breaking down” an opponent is something Erving could and still can do better than anyone. In the NBA, however, everybody doubles up on him, which is natural, but teams also pack defenders down low, clog the lanes and (sh, keep this a secret now) zone the bejeezus out of the Doctor. This makes it practically impossible for Erving to consistently drive to the hole for the swoop baskets by means of which he developed his Dr. J reputation.\n\n(Sports Illustrated, Mar 26, 1979)\n\nDuring the 1977 NBA Finals, Joe Juliano of United Press International wrote: “with George McGinnis hopelessly mired in a shooting slump and center Caldwell Jones offering little more than bringing the ball upcourt, Erving has drawn two, and sometimes three, Blazers around him each time he’s touched the ball” (Times-Union, Jun 2, 1977).\n\nBut with Miller and Nash on the perimeter, teams won’t be able to double Erving, leaving open lanes for him to drive to the basket, and Larry Nance also provides spacing to spread the floor. “Larry Nance made much of his living hanging around the wing, hitting the open 15-footer after his defender would leave to collapse on Price” (Washington Times, Sep 28, 1995). “Larry Nance had an important 16 points and nine rebounds, opening up things just enough by hitting perimeter jumpers” (Washington Post, May 1, 1989). He has spacing here that he never had before. Here is an example of complementarity, and the importance of choosing teammates that complement each other and better enable them to do what they do best.\n\nRussell is the dominant center Erving didn’t have in the NBA in 1977 contending with Bill Walton, ’78 contending with Wes Unseld, or ’80 and ’82 contending with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and didn’t have till ’83, with Moses Malone, who required him to sacrifice his offense and become a second option—going from 24.4 points per game (5th in the league) to 21.4, a 12.3% decrease—to accommodate Malone, who averaged a career-high 31.1 points per game the previous season—second in the league to George Gervin’s 32.3, and led the Sixers with 24.5 points per game (5th in the league). “[T]he offensive emphasis was to go to Moses inside and Andrew [Toney] outside, and I was kind of like the man in the middle,” Erving said in December of ’84. “Even though I got my shots and scored a lot, I wasn’t the priority” (Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Dec 12, 1984). Unlike Malone, Russell won’t take anything from Erving’s offense, but will only enhance it, enabling “the most scintillating open court player in history” (Philadelphia Inquirer, Nov 14, 1986) to get out into the open court more frequently. Here, Erving will be the priority and the #1 option. Russell will get the ball off the backboard (or block it) to Nash, who’ll get the ball to Erving in the open court. Playing with this team, Erving will be a fixture on SportsCenter, as everyone on the team will understand that getting Erving additional opportunities in transition will increase their chance of winning.\n\nDefensively, the addition of Erving gives this team shotblocking at all three frontcourt positions.\n\n’76 Erving had a game-preserving block with four seconds left to seal a 110-108 win over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the ABA Semifinals, and blocked two shots in the last two minutes of Game 3 of the ABA Finals against Denver. Russell, Nance, and Erving would form the greatest shot-blocking frontcourt ever, making Nash and Miller’s defense not a problem at all.\n\nBENCH\n\nAfter setting up depth charts and running simulations, I’m going with a nine-man rotation. I see many people list 10 for their dream teams, but in playing actual games, 10 is too many, as you won’t be able to give everyone enough minutes that they’ll all be happy with. I’ve seen people reference All-Star Games when defending the construction of their team, but the All-Star Game is nothing more than a glorified exhibition game. I’ve seen others reference the 1992 Barcelona Dream Team, but that team was vastly superior to the competition and was never in any danger of losing, so lineups and playing time didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things—they weren’t going to lose. I design my dream team as if it’s competing in an 82-game season against other similarly-constructed teams. Which means playing time matters, shots matter, fit and chemistry matters. So with that said, the choices for my bench:\n\nSixth Man: Manu Ginóbili, 2007-08\n\nGinóbili will fill the John Havlicek sixth man role. He’ll be the top scorer and playmaker of the second unit. He provides a change of pace from Miller in that he can create for himself and others instead of coming off screens. During the Nash Era, Phoenix Suns fans expressed the need for an additional playmaker. “I think Phoenix needs someone who can attack the basket off the dribble (similar to Ginobili and Parker),” one fan said on Arizona Sports Fans Network. “Right now the offense runs through Nash and he can’t do it for long periods of time.” Ginóbili could run the offense while Nash sits, and the offense wouldn’t fall apart. “If Ginobili was on the suns, they would probably kick everyone’s ass fairly efficiently,” one poster said on SpursTalk.com. “What has seemed to be the Sun’s big problem in the Nash era is that there really hasn’t been a highly skilled ball handler/playmaker that can spell Nash when he sits, which means he doesn’t rest much, and offensive production tends to decline when he is sitting. Manu could remedy that problem. Get Nash more rest without an offensive decline. Plus Manu is consistently clutch.” I must reiterate, always for each potential choice on a dream team, first and foremost in mind should be how that player is synergistic with the rest of the team. It isn’t about throwing a bunch of names together, but how well they fit together.\n\n“Combo guards and ‘tweeners’ have long been dangerous players to have on your roster,” Andrew McNeil wrote on 48 Minutes of Hell. “On the one hand, they can provide production in unexpected areas. On the other, they can torpedo a potentially strong defensive lineup. But in the case of Manu Ginobili, his ability to play both guard positions is a blessing for the Spurs in that it gives flexibility to the team without sacrificing defense. Whether in the NBA or abroad, Ginobili is the best of both worlds.” Ginóbili can play at the same time as Nash, when Miller sits, or he can run the offense when Nash sits. He can run with them in transition, or he could operate in the halfcourt should the opposing team happen to slow them down. As Rob Mahoney of The New York Times wrote, “Whether San Antonio is pushing the pace or grinding out games, Manu Ginobili thrives. He isn’t dependent on one system over another, and yet his versatility makes him a vital part of both approaches. […] He’s thrived in every offensive capacity; half-court, transition, secondary break—Ginobili is a man for all paces.” Russell’s J is Nashty in Miller Time can field a three-point lineup of Nash, Ginóbili and Miller with Russell in for offensive rebounding purposes, or Nash could run with Ginóbili and my next pick in the second unit and have three-point shooting and defense.\n\nSeventh Man: Michael Cooper, 1986-87\n\nCooper fills the Satch Sanders role. Cooper, a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Teamer, three-time All-Defensive Second Teamer, and 1986-87 Defensive Player of the Year is the defensive stopper. He is the man who will have the task of guarding the Michael Jordans, Kobe Bryants, Jerry Wests, Dwayne Wades, Clyde Drexlers, George Gervins, and any other high-scoring wings the team will face. Larry Bird consistently maintained that Cooper was the best defender who ever guarded him. But on this team he’ll have the greatest defensive player ever behind him, along with the best shot-blocking forward of the ’80s, enabling him to be even more aggressive than he was. He will back up the small forward and shooting guard positions, be a wingman on the break, provide three-point shooting, and can also play point guard as well. He was a must for me on this team.\n\nPF: 2007-08 Leon Powe\n\nOne thing the team lacks is a post-up big man. Powe averaged 7.9 points on 57.2 percent shooting and 62.9 percent true shooting and 4.1 rebounds in 14.4 minutes per game (19.8 and 10.1 per 36) in 2007-08. In the postseason he averaged 5.0 points on 49.3 percent shooting and 56.8 percent true shooting and 2.7 rebounds in 11.7 minutes per game. “Leon Powe was the best low post scorer on the championship team, bar none,” said Bob Ryan. One problem with teams such as this is getting everyone enough minutes. It’s completely unrealistic when people put starters on the bench—see Allen Iverson and Pau Gasol as examples of how players of that caliber react at coming off the bench, and they never think about how many minutes these players are going to get. Since Powe averaged 14.4 minutes per game, he would be fine with playing 13 minutes a night behind Nance, since he wouldn’t be asked to do anything other than what he actually did in reality. Powe’s 2007-08 season is the best for a bench player who played such limited minutes.\n\nC: 1975-76 Nate Thurmond\n\nThurmond is the defensive anchor when Russell takes a breather, and is also a bigger body for when facing a Shaq-led team. Russell’s quickness, agility and intelligence enabled him to cover large areas of the court and have a defensive impact greater than any player in NBA history, but there’s a tradeoff. Thurmond can’t cover as much ground as Russell, but he’s better physically equipped as a post defender, and he actually came off the bench this season and was pivotal in the Cleveland Cavaliers’ success that season in what was called the “Miracle of Richfield.” After being pressed into starting duty after starting center Jim Chones’ broken toe, Thurmond’s defense on Dave Cowens was key in enabling the underdog Cavaliers to extend the Celtics to six games. “I’m not near the player on offense I once was,” he said, “but on defense I’ve still got a lot left” (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 18, 1976).\n\nPeople who don’t know much about the game commonly liken Russell to Ben Wallace. Despite the inaccuracy of that comparison, to continue along those lines, if Russell is Ben Wallace, then Thurmond would be his Cliff Robinson/Rasheed Wallace. ” ‘We talk about Ben so much being a great defensive player because he blocks a lot of shots,’ Jerry Stackhouse said, ‘but I don’t think there is a better position defender in the league than Cliff’ ” (Detroit News, Mar 4, 2002). “Ben Wallace, named NBA Defensive Player of the Year on Saturday, owes an assist to Cliff Robinson, according to Carlisle. ‘Cliff being added to the equation really helped us win more games this year,’ Carlisle said. ‘It helped Ben become a better defensive player and it helped us be a better team. Ben is a great, great player, but Cliff’s presence has meant a lot to all of us” (Detroit News, Apr 21, 2002). “I’m not sure Ben Wallace is Defensive Player of the Year without Cliff Robinson playing next to him, guarding, usually the best frontcourt guy every night. It allows Ben to roam, block shots, and rebound. Without the luxury of a [Cliff Robinson], I’m just not sure Ben would have gotten that type of recognition or had that kind of year. I’m sure he wouldn’t have had that kind of year” (Michael Smith, “Cliff Notes Worth Studying: Robinson’s Career is Matched by Few.” Boston Globe, May 7, 2002). “Wallace’s strength is more as a help defender, not one-on-one” (USA Today, May 22, 2003). “Rasheed has allowed Ben to go back to being a weak-side defender instead of an on-ball defender. Rasheed is a souped-up version of Cliff Robinson from last year” (Detroit News, Apr 11, 2004). Thurmond is also 6-11, but 10 pounds bigger and stronger than the 230-pound Rasheed. “[B]urly 6-11 Nate Thurmond, the strongest center around with Wilt Chamberlain sidelined […]” (The Milwaukee Sentinel, Jan 17, 1970). “You had to take guys like Wilt and Nate Thurmond outside, because if you tried to stay down and muscle inside with a guy that big and strong, you were trying to beat him at his game, and eventually he would win,” said Elvin Hayes in an interview with SLAM Magazine in 2010 (Alan Paul, “Vitamin E.” SLAM Magazine, Dec 2010). Thurmond was consistently able to contain Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the chosen season, Thurmond held league MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to 3-for-14 shooting (21.4%) in the fourth quarter of the Cavaliers’ 99-98 win over the Lakers Dec. 22. Kareem finished the night with 13-for-33 shooting (39.4%). Imagine the luxury of being able to bring him into a game and put him on a post player with Russell causing havoc on help defense?\n\nThe 2003-04 Detroit Pistons, after acquiring Rasheed Wallace, won 20 of their last 26 games, allowed 78.9 points per game (as opposed to 86.8 points per game pre-Sheed; no team in NBA history had allowed less than 80 points per game game over the course of a season since the institution of the 24-second shot clock in 1954), held five consecutive opponents below 70 points, and won eight consecutive games by at least 15 points. If Ben and Rasheed Wallace could do this together, it makes one wonder what Bill Russell and Nate Thurmond would do together. Since this team would play at a faster pace than the Pistons their raw points-per-game numbers wouldn’t be as low as the Pistons’, but what would the defensive efficiency be when Russell and Thurmond were both on the court?\n\nRob Mahoney writing about the Oklahoma City Thunder, who had Kendrick Perkins, Serge Ibaka and Nick Collison, wrote, “Many N.B.A. teams have one effective big man on defense and several others who make do despite their troublesome instincts or their lack of athleticism or proper defensive foundation. The Thunder are fortunate to have three bigs capable of playing stellar defense—a bonus that goes far beyond luxury.” Russell’s J is Nashty in Miller Time has an even better trio of defensive big men in Bill Russell, Larry Nance and Nate Thurmond. In selecting my bench I only wanted to have players who actually came off the bench. Typically on their dream teams, people load the bench with MVP winners who would never consent to being relegated to a mere bench player. Since I had the opportunity to pick Thurmond without violating my self-imposed rule of only choosing bench players who actually came off the bench, I had to jump at the chance. There isn’t another backup center who played the defense in the playoffs that Thurmond did during the 1976 postseason. He was exactly what I was looking for, and the fact that he was the second-best defensive center of his era to the man who’s starting made him irresistible.\n\nMy only concern is that Russell’s normally going to play 38 minutes a game, leaving only 10 for Thurmond. As I said, people never consider how they’re going to divy up the minutes of their players. When facing a Shaquille O’Neal led team Thurmond will gain more playing time than normal, but he might be the only player who might not be satisfied with his minutes, going from the 17.4 he averaged for Cleveland to 10. He’s perfect, so I really hope it won’t be a problem, and I won’t have to choose a lesser player who would be more used to playing the minutes that would be available to him.\n\nSo that’s the four-man bench rotation, making this the complete lineup:\n\nRUSSELL’S J IS NASHTY IN MILLER TIME\n\nDepth Chart\n\nC – 1963-64 Bill Russell (38) / 1975-76 Nate Thurmond (10)\n\nPF – 1991-92 Larry Nance (35) / 2007-08 Leon Powe (13)\n\nSF – 1975-76 Julius Erving (35) / 1986-87 Michael Cooper (13)\n\nSG – 1994-95 Reggie Miller (33) / 2007-08 Manu Ginóbili (11) / 1986-87 Michael Cooper (4)\n\nPG – 2006-07 Steve Nash (33) / 2007-08 Manu Ginóbili (11) / 1986-87 Michael Cooper (4)\n\n*Depth chart and playing time are subject to change depending on individual matchups\n\nJust missing the cut: Nate McMillan, 1993-94\n\nMcMillan was someone I really liked, and I liked the idea of being able to throw a defensive backcourt of Cooper and McMillan against opposing wings, which would be the GOAT defensive backcourt off the bench, able to press and trap and wreak havoc with Russell and Nance behind them, but there simply weren’t enough minutes to go around. Ginóbili is the offensive anchor of the second unit, and Cooper is the defensive ace, so both had to stay, leaving McMillan as the odd man out, a luxury I simply had no room for. I really hate not having room for him though, as he would have played the K. C. Jones role, only with better rebounding and passing.\n\nOFFENSE\n\nFrom simulations, the point distribution of the rest of the starters seems to come out to: Erving at ~22-24 points per game, Miller at ~18-19 (with the ability to scale up when needed), Nance at ~ 16-17, and Nash at ~14-15. Russell doesn’t care so long as the team wins. Erving averaged 23.1 ppg in Philly in ’78-79 with Doug Collins as the second-leading scorer at 19.5, and averaged 21.6 in Philly in ’76-77, with George McGinnis averaging 21.4, Doug Collins 18.3, and World B. Free 16.3, at a pace of 108.3. Nance averaged 16.2 ppg his first year in Cleveland, 16.3 in ’89-90 (with Ron Harper averaging 22.0, Mark Price averaging 19.6, Hot Rod Williams averaging 16.84, and Brad Daughtery averaging 16.83 at a pace of 95.0), and 16.5 in ’92-93 (with Daugherty averaging 20.2, and Price averaging 16.5 at a pace of 94.8), the year following the chosen season. Nash averaged 14.5 ppg his last year in Dallas (with Dirk Nowitzki averaging 21.8, Michael Finley averaging 18.6, and Antawn Jamison averaging 14.8 at a pace of 93.2), and 15.5 his first year in Phoenix (with Amaré Stoudemire averaging 26.0, Shawn Marion averaging 19.4, and Joe Johnson averaging 17.1 at a pace of 95.9). So—which was important when choosing players for the team—the starters would be able to put up production similar to that which they’re already accustomed to. They could do exactly what they actually did, which is something few people consider when making their teams.\n\nThe top four scorers average ~ 70-75 points a game. Looking at other all-time great teams for a similar point distribution, the top four scorers on the ’84-85 Lakers were Kareem (22.0), Magic (18.3), Worthy (17.6) and Scott (16.0), who combined to average 73.9 points per game. Looking at Russell’s Celtics teams, in 1964-65 Sam Jones posted the highest scoring average of any Celtic of the Russell Era, with a team-leading 25.9 points per game, John Havlicek averaged 18.3, Russell 14.1 and Tom Heinsohn 13.6 for a cumulative average of 71.9 points per game. So the scoring is realistic, and they will function together like an actual team.\n\nI’ve never once seen anyone in forming their dream teams make sure that their players will score at a rate similar or equal to what they actually did, and thus everyone will be happy with. Since the standard everyone uses for ranking players is whether or not they’re “a #1 option” who can “carry a team offensively,” the result is the starting lineups of their dream teams (and oftentimes their benches as well) are invariably loaded with players who were #1 options their whole careers. Somehow it doesn’t occur to them that these players can’t all be #1 options while playing together, and so someone will be scoring less than they’re accustomed to—and we’ve seen in real life what happens when players aren’t happy with the shots they’re getting.\n\nAnd this is why I didn’t chose 1961-62 Russell when considering the team I was going to build. If I already have Erving, Miller, Nash, and Nance, then I don’t need the extra scoring from Russell, as the scoring distribution is perfect already. The career-high rebounding is more important to the team to get Nash out on the break with Erving and Nance more frequently. This is why a player’s highest-scoring season isn’t always the season that should be chosen for these teams; one should consider the rest of the players on the team when selecting a season and how it will mesh with the other players.\n\nDoc and Reggie are the go-to guys down the stretch. ’76 Erving scored 10 of the Nets’ last 11 points and hit the game-winner at the buzzer in Game 1 of the ABA Finals against the Denver Nuggets—his 44th and 45th points of the evening—to give the Nets a 120-118 win in Denver where they’d never won in 11 meetings, scored 37 points in the second half and 25 in the fourth quarter of Game 2 to set pro basketball records in a losing effort in a 127-121 loss (eleven years later, Eric “Sleepy” Floyd broke both records by scoring 29 in the fourth quarter and 39 in a half en route to a 51-point night in Game 4 of the 1987 Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers to lead his Golden State Warriors to a 129-121 win, and Isiah Thomas tied his pro basketball championship series record in Game 6 of the 1988 NBA Finals against the Lakers in a 103-102 loss), and scored the Nets’ last eight points—six in the last 30 seconds—in a 117-111 win in Game 3; in the prior round his dunk with 14 seconds left in Game 4 of the ABA Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs put the Nets in front for the first time since early in the first quarter, and his additional free throw gave the Nets a 110-108 win to tie the series at 2-2. And Miller is one of the greatest clutch players in NBA history. He hit over 30 game-winners in his career, and in the chosen year scored 8 points in 8.9 seconds to lead the Pacers back from a 105-99 deficit with 18.7 seconds remaining to a 107-105 win in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals after trailing by six. Miller takes the pressure off Erving of having to make the big shot all the time as he had to for the Nets, and Erving does the same for Miller. ’07 Nash also had an effective field-goal percentage of 78.0 percent (64.0% FG, 53.8% 3-Pt FG) with a shot to tie or take the lead, which was best in the league.\n\nREBOUNDING\n\nRussell is the team’s leading rebounder, typically grabbing ~ 21-24% of available rebounds, ~ 30-33% of available defensive rebounds, and ~ 9-11% of available offensive rebounds. For a modern point of comparison to aid in what those percentages would look like, Dwight Howard in 2007-08 had a TRB% of 21.7, a DRB% of 31.6, and an ORB% of 10.9, averaging 14.2 rebounds, 10.8 defensive rebounds, and 3.4 offensive rebounds per game in 37.7 minutes per, and in 2011-12 had a TRB% of 21.9, a DRB% of 33.1, and an ORB% of 11.0, averaging a career-best 14.5 rebounds, 10.8 defensive rebounds, and 3.7 offensive rebounds per game in 38.3 minutes per. Erving is the second-leading rebounder, grabbing ~ 11-13% of available rebounds, ~ 15% of available defensive rebounds, and ~ 7-8% of available offensive rebounds. That’s rebounding at the same rate as LeBron James, but LeBron wasn’t the offensive rebounder, and was a better defensive rebounder. The only star small forward who comes closest to all those percentages is Carmelo Anthony, who in 2007-08 had a TRB% of 11.0, a DRB% of 14.9, and an ORB% of 7.0, averaging 7.4 rebounds, 5.1 defensive rebounds and 2.3 offensive rebounds per game in 36.4 minutes per. Nance grabs ~ 10-11% of available rebounds, ~ 12-13% of available defensive rebounds, and ~ 7% of available offensive rebounds. Among power forwards, Larry Johnson in 1994-95 had a 10.7 TRB%, 13.8 DRB%, and 7.3 ORB%, averaging 7.2 rebounds, 4.9 defensive rebounds and 2.3 offensive rebounds per game in 39.9 minutes per, 6.5, 4.4 and 2.1 per 36.\n\nOn RealGM, one poster by"
