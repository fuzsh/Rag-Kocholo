AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - Detroit Pistons coach Flip Saunders said his team is totally different than it was at this time last year because of a renewed focus.

That's not good news for the Chicago Bulls.

Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton each scored 20 points, leading the Pistons to an easy 95-69 victory over Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Saturday night.

The Pistons are still kicking themselves for losing to the Miami Heat in the conference finals last year - after winning the title in 2004 and coming just short of repeating - and vowed to show how determined they are to at least get back to the NBA finals.

If the Eastern Conference's top-seeded team keeps playing like they have been, they will have a shot.

Detroit was aggressive on defense, getting into passing lanes with their feet and hands, and balanced on offense.

The Pistons will host Game 2 on Monday night.

Chicago's Ben Gordon averaged 25.5 points and Andres Nocioni added 12 a game in the first-round sweep over the Heat, but were held to just seven and two points, respectively. Former Piston Ben Wallace had nine points, eight rebounds and a block.

Luol Deng scored 18 and Kirk Hinrich had 15 for the Bulls, who led only once in the series opener.

Detroit took control with a 13-2 run midway through the first quarter, but didn't put Chicago away until the opening minutes of the fourth.

Three Pistons made 3-pointers in the first 2 minutes of the final quarter for a 19-point lead before going ahead 86-60 a few minutes later.
