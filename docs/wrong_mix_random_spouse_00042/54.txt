His first Hollywood role was in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot: “Welcome to Hellmouth.” He has appeared in many TV shows as a guest-star, been on many talk shows, and has also been in many movies such as Conception, No Way Home, etc. He is currently playing the role of CSI: NY's Danny Messer. He also turns to his father and sister for advice on how to portray a better police officer because his father is a former police officer and his sister is a police officer.

In his spare time, he paints, reads poetry, writes songs, and plays guitar. He has his own band named “Ceesau.” It includes Giovinazzo as lead vocals and rhythm guitar, John Patrick Annedori as lead guitar and backup vocals, and Micheal Brasic on drums.
