INTRODUCTION. “Friends among journalists have often invited me to write a little history for them of our Exhibition work at Earl’s Court, but I have never found the time to do so, and, to be frank, I would rather con¬ tribute my humble share towards making history than write it.”— Mr. Whitley , at the German Athenaeum , October 29, 1890. IF good and beneficent actions are worth re¬ membering, then surely it is fit and Work and proper that due space in the chronicles Worttu of a time, already crowded with the personal records of great achievements, should be devoted to the work of a man whose doings well entitle him to a place in the hearts of his grateful countrymen. That man is Mr. John Robinson Whitley, the originator and organiser of the four National Exhibitions which have done so much to familiarise Englishmen, who never travelled in any of these countries, with the arts, the industries, the products, the life and customs of America, Italy, France, and Germany ‘ — nations the most diverse and representative. On 14 INTRODUCTION. a photograph of himself, which the German Emperor presented to the Postmaster-General of the Empire, Herr von Stephan, the author of the Universal Postal Union and other remedies against inters national isolation and ignorance, His Majesty wrote these words : — “ Intercourse between the nations is the main characteristic of this nineteenth century of ours at its close. The barriers separating nations are thus overthrown, and new relationships established between them.” Now, surely, few have done more to promote the progress of this “ international intercourse ” than the man who, in spite of enormous difficulties, which only invested his object with a greater charm, and without any profit to himself beyond the satisfaction of having been engaged in a good work, has year after year presented his fellow-countrymen with living pictures of foreign nations in miniature- pictures in which the elements of instruction and recreation were harmoniously combined. If such a man is not a public benefactor, to whom, then, should the term exclusively apply ? And if a man proves himself to be a praiseworthy citizen, ought not honourable mention of his services to be placed on fair record ? We think it should, and we propose to do so, letting facts speak for them¬ selves, without comment or embellishment on our part, and using, by preference, the words of other witnesses as the basis and backbone of our simple narrative. INTRODUCTION. 15 And first as to the personality of Mr. John Robinson Whitley, who is a native of York- Bio_ shire (where he was born in 1843), and has graphical, inherited all the virtues, physical and mental, of that fine and famous breed of Englishmen. “Fit Via T the motto of the Whitley family, seems singularly appropriate in the light of its Exhibition member’s Samson-like physique and resistless force of character. He was educated partly in England, and partly in France and Germany, and there were but few in this latter country of Turn-Vereine who could hold their own at gymnastics with the stalwart young Yorkshireman. Subsequently he had opportunities of travelling through the chief countries of Europe, which enabled him to become an excel¬ lent linguist, speaking French, German, and Italian with fluency — an accomplishment which simply proved indispensable to him in the task of organising his life-pictures of these three nations. And as for his insight into the practical mechanism of such work — that was acquired when, as manager of his father’s engineering business, he went with products of the firm successively to the Paris Exhibition of 1867, to that of Moscow in 1872, of Lyons in the same year, of Vienna in 1873, and of Paris in 1878. It was here (in Paris) that Mr. Whitley’s aptitude for affairs was recognised by about fifty of the leading exhibitors, British and other, who paid him the compliment of asking him to represent their interests, a trust he fulfilled with the greatest success. 16 INTRODUCTION. Ill-health from overwork induced him to relin¬ quish his share in the family business, and to seek rest, combined with new ideas, in travel ; and it was during this period that he made him¬ self acquainted, among other things, with the art treasures of Paris, Florence, Naples, and Pome. The technical experience he thus amassed was further increased when Mr. Whitley entered into a temporary partnership with Mr. Frederick Walton, the inventor of u linoleum,” with the object of developing Mr. Walton’s patents for an adaptation of this material, in a modified form, to decorative pur¬ poses. To the new ornamental fabric Mr. Whitley gave the name of “ Lincrusta- Walton,” a title by which it is now known as extensively as linoleum itself. In the process of developing the manufacture and use of this novel and artistic product, Mr. Whitley’s influential connections, mercantile and social, in all parts of Europe and America, rendered comparatively easy for him the task of creating a new and artistic industry in Paris and New York. Works for the manufacture of the new material were erected, and while adding a new industry to those which pre¬ viously flourished in the busy marts selected for the process of production, Mr. Whitley introduced from them to the other centres of wealth and civilisation a method of tastefully adorning domestic interiors which is now as popular as it has proved successful. The organisation of this new and artistic industry occu¬ pied Mr. Whitley about three years. INTRODUCTION , 17 Such the comprehensive training that was un¬ consciously preparing him for the serious Character_ work of his life, a work for which he istics- possessed and acquired qualifications that could scarcely be found combined in any other single man. Overflowing energy and incisive edge, a keen busi¬ ness faculty, a high degree of administrative skill, a daring spirit of enterprise, a personal knowledge of foreign countries and customs, great linguistic acquirements, refined perceptions in art coupled with a sense of being at home in all the fields of modern industry, a philanthropic heart, dauntless courage and an inflexible will — these are qualities, it must surely be admitted, which rarely go to the making up of any one character, and which rendered Mr. Whitley just the very man to undertake the task of bringing home to the minds and doors of his fellow-countrymen the life of foreign nations in concrete and concentrated form. A keen judge of character wrote of him: — “ In business it is impos¬ sible to come into contact with him without feeling that he is a born organiser and administrator, combining in a rare degree a wonderful regard for detail with resistless energy and the faculty of persuading others to see things as he does. This latter power may well be the result of a naturally sympathetic temperament, which enables him to enter into the feelings of those with whom be has to deal, and to satisfy their just claims and wishes, often by personal sacrifices, without losing sight of 2 18 INTRODUCTION. the great objects to which his efforts are, from time to time, directed. He judges character with rapid intuition ; and his great and varied experience in the management of large bodies of men has given him a facility possessed by few persons for directing opera^ tions of magnitude; while his talent for unsparing hard work, and his cheery and genial manner have made him generally popular with those who have been brought into immediate relations with him.” And perhaps we had better complete this personal portraiture by quoting the following characterisation of Mr. Whitley from the Phrenological Magazine “ The photograph of this gentleman indicates several strong points of character. He is well sustained by a high degree of vital temperament, and has an ample amount of blood, breathing power, and digestive apparatus. He is full of animal life, is warm and ardent, if not impulsive and excitable, throws a great amount of feeling into everything he does, and cannot be a half-and-half kind of man. The entire base of his brain is large and has a strong hold on life, and he believes in living as he goes along. He has great executive power, is in his element when he is pushing business, or business is pushing him. He does not mind opposition and ordinary obstacles ; they only nerve him to greater work. “He possesses great perceptive power, is a practical man governed by observation and experience, he soon surveys the whole field, knows what is going on around him, and keeps the run of affairs of the day. He is a good judge of stock and the quality of things, he lays his plans quickly, is able to make the most of his situation, and if necessary could put much in a small space. He has the power to organise, systematise, and arrange matters. He makes correct calculations as to profit, loss, cost, and so forth. INTRODUCTION. 19 Possesses a liigli order of ingenuity and versatility of talent, and can do many different things equally well ; he is not much given to abstract thought, but readily takes an idea and applies it in some tangible form. He is characterised for intuition, is a quick * discerner of character, motives, truth, and the most practical way of coming at a subject, has strong imagination, much general scope of mind, and is liable to take liberal if not extravagant views of things. He is versatile in his manner, and far from being awkward or odd. He is lively, wide awake, and sympathetic, is easily interested in what is taking place, at once falls into sympathy with other persons, and has the power of exerting quite a distinct influence over others. He has great magnetic power, has all the indications of ambition and desire to excel, has also the indications of hope and enterprise, but none too much fear and restraint. His danger is in going too far rather than not far enough, of attempting to do too much rather than the reverse. His power lies in his brain and nervous system as well as in a high order of lung and heart power, which aid greatly in sustaining the brain in its efforts. He has fair conversational gifts and is youthful and easy in his manner and address, and draws people to him rather than repels them from him.” Physiognomical Studies delineates Mr. Whitley's chief characteristics as follows ; — . . * “He possesses an enormous front head, the length from the ear to the outer corner of the eye denoting a quick intellect and mar¬ vellous powers of comprehension. The eyes are set deep in their sockets, denoting great shrewdness and keenness of perception. The downward projection of the eye-brow at the outer corner indicates contest, and ambition to excel. The straightness of the eye -brow at the inner extremity means truth and sincerity. The fulness in the centre of the forehead is due to the development of the organ of memory. The transverse wrinkle over the top of the 20 INTRODUCTION. nose indicates authority and command. The nostril has a proud and spirited curl. The thinness of the bridge of the nose means generosity.” It is with such a mental, moral, and physical Objects and equipment that Mr. Whitley addressed Motives, himself to his life-task, as to the real nature and objects of which he himself had better be heard. In an address to the members of the “ German Athenaeum,” in London (October 29, 1890), he said : — “The Exhibitions at Earl’s Court are solely the outcome of private initiative. Being a strong believer in private initiative and individual effort, I make reference to this point with a profound feeling of pride and satisfaction. Civilisation has its dark as well as its bright sides, and one of its dark sides is that as soon as men are imbued with a desire to realise a conceived ideal (no matter how noble it may be), if there is the slightest possibility of its bringing its own reward in the form of material gain, or increased woildly possessions to those who devote themselves to the working out of the idea, many rush to the conclusion that nothing but the greed of fame, or fortune is the mainspring and reason of the arduous efforts such idealists may put forth. Those who rush to this conclusion do not appear to under* stand that the very pursuit and realisation of a congenial idea constitute in themselves a deep fount of exquisite pleasure. As well might one endeavour to maintain that all men who hunt the bear or the bison do so simply for the hides of the poor brutes, or that the artist has no other enjoyment in conveying his con¬ ceptions to canvas than that of reflecting upon the number of ‘ bawbees ’ it will bring him. This series of National Exhibitions is novel in character, and on that account I have had to be prepared to encounter adverse criticism from those who are unacquainted with our ideal or with our intentions. Men who leave INTRODUCTION. 21 old and beaten tracks, in all countries and in all 5-ges, must be tenacious of purpose and brave with the courage and enthusiasm of their own views, if they mean to conquer. It is comforting to re¬ member that just those persons who do not see into what the picture will develop which the artist has in his mind, or what net result to the history of humanity will accrue from the efforts of organisation, are the very persons who, later, are the loudest in praise of the work when completed ; and very often those enterprises which meet with strenuous opposition on the part of the persons they are chiefly to benefit are afterwards hailed with thanks and blessings through all time. “ No one need be surprised when I say that if an Exhibition may be compared to a bed of roses, it may be so likened not only for its perfume, but also for its thorns. I remember one friend’s remark about Exhibition work : 1 C'est magnijique , mais ce ?i'est x>as la guerre.' That friend only saw the outer wrappings, for no heavier work has ever fallen to the lot of soldiers in war-time than that which falls upon two or three of the men who lead in Exhibit tion work ; and when I have completed my self-imposed task, I can assure you that any other combination of labours I may hereafter undertake will appear to me easy in comparison with that of orga¬ nising the National Exhibitions at Earl’s Court. . . * “ I am certainly not wrong in declaring that no Exhibition ever produced practical results for the exhibitors unless the organisers had previously laid all their plans, had previously realised exactly the object to be attained, and had previously determined not to be deterred by any power on earth from the accomplishment of their work, for although Exhibition work is to all appearance a peaceful task, there is no peace for him who undertakes it. His existence is a prolonged battle, and if he quails before the spear thrust or the bullet, he may as well save himself much pain and infinite worry by exemplifying in his conduct the old adage, that prudence is the better part of valour. If, however, he can collect himself and resist the first attacks of those who, despite his intention of helping and benefiting them, waylay him with hidden weapons and lie in ambush for him, he will perhaps learn to despise their methods of 22 INTBODUCTION. warfare, and to prefer, nay, almost to welcome with fierce joy the onslaught of his bitterest, but open foes. They at least fight with the edge of the sword and in the light of day, and the bravest wins the field. But it is the poisoned shaft of the false friend which is most to be feared ; and such shafts are numerous, as those well know who, after the heat and burden of the day, find time and leisure to draw them from their bleeding flesh. . . . “ For organising an Exhibition, the most indispensable requisite is patience. Committees, heads of departments, exhibitors, agents, contractors or soi-disant contractors, all ask to be received and to have their claims immediately granted. In order to be moderately successful, an organiser of Exhibitions should begin by throwing the ideas contained in his brain into a kaleidoscopic condition, so that, by means of a mental shake, he may obtain an ever- constant, yet ever- varying combination, taking care always to have an arrange¬ ment ready for the exigencies of the moment. In the course of time this sort of intellectual gymnastics comes to be almost natural and even amusing. And, indeed, the psychological condition of one who is called to this work would produce an interesting series of illustrations if the photographer’s art could reproduce the evolutions of the brain as well as those of the body. . . . £‘ Not one of the Exhibitions at Earl’s Court has received any subsidy from any Government or corporation. We have neither had the benefit of a guarantee fund, nor the loan of a battalion of trained assistants. What has been done has been done by two or three men, and the portion of work which I allotted to myself has been so heavy that, unless I had found intense pleasure in it, I should long ago have suspended it. What has chiefly sustained me and enabled me to keep up a sufficient head of steam to carry me through the work has been the encouraging reflection that, perhaps, when the quartette of ‘ Life-Pictures ’ representing some of the arts and industries of America, Italy, France, and Germany shall have been painted, or, if you will, when the volume in four chapters shall have been written and bound, then a few of what Goethe would have called schone Seelen may recognise that the aim of my heavy work has been construction and not destruc- INTRODUCTION. 23 tion, and that, though I shall have fought four battles, it will have been without the loss of one life. . . . “ What almost makes one blush to acknowledge one’s reasons for the efforts put forth is the fact, that what we are pleased to term * business ’ and ‘ business methods ’ so rule the world now-a-days, that a man makes confession of the real motives which inspire what he thinks his magnum opus, as I am now doing for the first time, in a spirit almost of contrition, and with a prayer to be for¬ given. If the greed of gold had been the moving factor in my efforts to paint realistic pictures of the working life of foreign nations at Earl’s Court, then assuredly the first Exhibition of the series would, so far as I am concerned, have also been the last ; and if the series has not been up to that standard of excellence which one would have wished, it should be remembered that, so far from receiving even moral support from Governments and Principalities, we have had, with the exception of Italy, to struggle against their coolness. “ One of the greatest anomalies I know, and one which I am unable to fathom, is that, whilst some Governments are un¬ willing to patronise (even to the extent of lending a few exhibits from their unique collections of works of art) undertakings of such an important character as Exhibitions organised by private and peaceful initiative, yet the same Governments will readily support bodies of men who by private initiative open out commerce in distant lands at the point of the sivorcl ; and, indeed, support them so thoroughly, that those Governments themselves will eventually direct these purely commercial operations, and levy taxes upon the people wherewith to defray the cost. Yet this state of things — this huge anomaly — is such an accepted axiom, that it is almost considered as impertinent, or at any rate as indi¬ cative of mere enthusiasm, when men come forward to establish closer and more friendly relations with foreign peoples without the use of the sword, and without levying a tax upon either life or property, when men, in short, would rather assist in causing those conglomerations of humanity we call ‘ Nations ’ to work together, than to incite them to maim and slay each other, 24 ■INTBODUCTION. “ I have long been convinced of the utter inutility of endeavouring to reform this state of things— this huge anomaly — by the praise¬ worthy but chimerical projects of Peace and Philantliropical Societies and other cognate organisations. I prefer to endeavour to demonstrate by deeds what mere talk will never prove, that is to say, that the oftener we bring artists, manufacturers, and merchants of one country into close and intimate contact with buyers in other countries, the sooner shall we reduce aimless fighting and friction to a minimum, and convert wasting passions into well-ordered power for the good of the greatest number. The thirst for blood won’t come to men who are absorbed in hard and honest work. I am proud to aid in fostering emulation between different nationalities, for whilst this kind of emulation occupies their energies they will have neither the time nor the taste for butchering one another. Bringing men from one country to work with men of another does more for peace than writing dozens of books about the horrors of war. For my own part, after ten years’ labour as an engineer, and ten years more of mercantile experience in London, I felt, before commencing the organisation of the American Exhibition of 1887, that, of all spheres open to me, the carrying out of my favourite idea, viz., the organising of a series of National Exhibi¬ tions in London, Tournaments of Labour, so to speak, would afford me the greatest satisfaction, because it appeared to me that one of the highest forms of human effort is to extend the know¬ ledge and usefulness of arts, industries, and commerce. It seemed, and still seems to me, that he who spends years of hard work in piactically inducing nations to enter into closer working relations with one another, does perhaps fully as much for the good of man¬ kind and for the progress of civilisation, as if he were to limit himself to writing theoretical treatises on the subject in his study. ^ ^ien I have completed my task next year, and shall have retired into private life, I shall not, from a pecuniary point of view, have been enriched by the series of National Exhibitions held in London ; on the contrary, the realisation of my favourite idea will have cost me many thousands of pounds. And with INTRODUCTION. 25 pride I confess it, for it will always be a source of immense satisfaction to me to remember, that I have been the means of bringing the workers of four of the greatest nations in the world into close and worthy relations with my own countrymen, and I really cannot conceive of any more useful method of spending one’s efforts and means.” * Surely Prince Albert the Good could not have been animated by higher or sounder mo- Previous tives than those, when he set himself to Exhlbltlons- bring about the Great International Exhibition of London in 1851, and thus inaugurate a new era of international rapprochement and world-shrinkage. But though this great World-Pair constituted a new departure in itself, it had been preceded by national exhibitions reaching even into dim antiquity. For do we not read, in the Book of Esther, that Ahasuerus, in the third year of his reign, “ showed the riches of his kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and four score days ” ? Moreover, exhibitions not inter¬ national, except in the sense that they consisted to a large extent of the spoils of conquered countries, were held at Rome during the last days of the Republic and the infancy of the Empire ; but the invasion of the barbarians was fatal to any of the triumphs of peace, and there were no exhibitions * Mr. Whitley voluntarily relinquished, from the outset, his right to participate in whatever pecuniary surplus might accrue from the Exlii* bitions, to those providing the funds, by announcing to the respective Committees, previous to the opening of each of the Exhibitions, his intention to present to such Institutions, as they might select, any pecu¬ niary surplus resulting to himself from his own personal investment of funds, in connection with his Quartette of Life-Pictures. 26 INTRODUCTION . from the time of Nero till the Middle Ages were well advanced. At Venice, in 1268, during the Dogeship of Lorenzo Tiepolo, there was a good industrial exhibition, accompanied by a procession of the trades and an aquatic fete. The fairs held at Leipzig and Nijni Novgorod in Europe, as well as at Tantah, half-way between Cairo and Alexandria, during the Middle Ages, had many of the characteristics of modern exhibitions ; while at Leyden, in 1689, the Dutch held a singular fair, at which they exhibited a great number of the most curious products of the East. Of modern exhibitions the first of the series, as far as we can gather, was held in London in 1756, when the Society of Arts offered prizes for improve¬ ments in the manufacture of tapestry, carpets, and porcelain ; while five years later a similar exhibition was got up by the same Society, the objects shown being agricultural and other machinery, and a gentle¬ man was engaged to explain the merits thereof. In 1797 a collective display of the art factories of Sevres, the Gobelins, and of the Savonnerie, was commenced within the deserted walls of St. Cloud ; and the last three days of the same year witnessed an official “ exposition ” in the Champs de Mars, on which occasion Napoleon, who had just returned from his successful campaign in Italy, caused the art spoils from Venice, Borne, and Milan to be paraded through the streets. A second official exhibition was held in 1801 in the Louvre, and this time INTRODUCTION. 27 juries of specialists examined the objects shown, awarding gold medals. “ There is not an artist or an inventor,” wrote the jury, “who, once obtaining thus a public recognition of his ability, has not found his reputation and his business largely increase ” — and the words were remarkable. After various other exhibitions held at Paris in the following years, the series was interrupted by the wars of the Empire till 1819, when the fifth was again held in the courtyard of the Louvre, under the presidency of Louis XVIII. there being 1,622 exhibitors ; while in 1849, the final one of the series boasted of no fewer than 4,500 com¬ petitors. Meanwhile, the same idea had taken root in Dublin, where a series of triennial exhibitions, said to have had very satisfactory results on Irish trade, was started in 1827 by the Boyal Dublin Society. In the following year a National Depository was opened in the Eoyal Mews, Charing Cross, “ for the exhibition of specimens of new and improved produc¬ tions of artisans and manufacturers of the United Kingdom,” but the project did not succeed. During the first half of the present century a number of national exhibitions had been held in various parts of Germany, and in particular one at Berlin in 1844, which drew to it 3,040 exhibitors ; and, indeed, exhi¬ bitions confined to the products and manufactures of the country in which they were held had taken place in almost every country of Europe long before 1851 - — the year in which the Prince Consort made quite a 28 INTRODUCTION . new departure with his huge and memorable World- Fair, and which marks the commencement of what has been called the Era of Exhibitions. The Great London Exhibition was followed by those of New York and Dublin in 1853; Melbourne and Munich in 1854; while in 1855, during the Crimean war, the French followed suit with their grand industrial gathering at the Palais de lYndustrie, which is still standing on the Champs Elysees. After that there were national exhibitions in various Euro¬ pean countries, but the next great World-Fair was held in London in 1862 (the Poet Laureate inditing an ode, and Sir Sterndale Bennett composing the music for the opening) ; while Dublin again imitated the example of London in 1865, and Paris in 1867 sought to eclipse her exhibition glories of 1855. Between 1867 and 1870 there were minor exhibitions in various parts of Europe, and annual exhibitions of various kinds in London between 1870 and 1874; but the next great International Exhibition, or Welt - Ausstellung , took place at Vienna in 1873, the num¬ ber of exhibitors being nearly 26,000. Then came, in 1876, the Grand Centennial Exhibition at Phila¬ delphia (in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of American Independence), where the display of machinery was the finest ever made, and the number of visitors approached ten millions. Two years later Paris again took up the tale with an International Exhibition on a still greater scale than any of its predecessors ; while, in 1879, Sydney led the way for INTRODUCTION. 29 tlie Southern Hemisphere, and was followed next year by her sister-city, Melbourne. During the next five years no fewer than fifty exhibitions were held in various parts of the world.* In 1883 South Kensington began a series of most successful Exhibitions, under the patronage of the Prince of Wales and the direction of Sir Philip * The following is a List of the Exhibitions that were held in various parts of the world from 1880 to 1885 Food , Agricultural Hall, October, 1880 ; Light , Alexandra Palace, October, 1880 ; Fisheries (Inter¬ national), Berlin, 1880; Earthenware, Cement , &c.

Cunliff e-Owen. The first of this series, the Fisheries Exhibition (popularly called “ The Fisheries ”), was held in 1883, followed by the Health Exhibition (or “ Healtheries ”) in 1884, the Inventions Exhibition in 1885, and concluded by the Colonial and Indian Exhibition (the “ Colinderies ”) in 1886. It was at the first meeting of the Royal Commission of the last named that Lord Derby remarked; “ There was a time, a few years ago, when it was said exhibitions were played out, and that it would be well, for a time at least, to discontinue them. I do not know whether that feeling was ever justified by the facts ; it may have represented a passing phase of opinion in London, but it is not the case now. We have had recent experience, and we have seen that what¬ ever the ostensible object of the Exhibition, whether appliances of health, fisheries, forestry, or whatever the subject may be, the interest that is felt in these exhibitions is unabated and ever increasing.” It was under the motive force of this conviction that Mr. Whitley addressed himself to the task of achieving what had never been attempted before — a fascinating enough problem for a man over¬ flowing with courage, energy, and initiative power — namely, to organise in the heart of his own country an Exhibition confined exclusively to the “ arts, inventions, manufactures, products, and resources ” of another. CHAPTER II. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. (1887.) “ When was ever sncli an Exhibition held in a foreign country, without Government assistance, by any other nation in the whole annals of the world ? 15 * — The Nineteenth Century , June, 1887. “ United by a common language, a common spirit of commercial enter¬ prise, and a common regard for well-regulated liberty .” — Canning. “ It has always been a favourite idea of mine to bring the life of the Old and the New World face to face.” — Oliver Wendell Holmes. NEW departure in the history of Exhibi¬ tions was made in the year 1887, 102 years after John Adams, the first Opportune¬ ness of Exhibition. Minister of the United States who came on a friendly mission to Great Britain, presented his credentials to King George III. This anniversary also received an additional, and, indeed, its main interest, from the fact of its being the Jubilee Year of Queen Victoria ; and it was, therefore, a charming coincidence that the triumphs and celebrations of this memorable year should have included an Exhibition in London of the progress in arts and industries made # Referring to the Exhibition which is the subject of this chapter. 32 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON . by one of Mother England’s oldest and greatest of daughters — an Exhibition which was at the same time an outward and visible sign that the unhappy estrangement between parent and offspring, origina¬ ting in the reign of Her Gracious Majesty’s grand¬ father, had now at last, in this Jubilee Year of hers, given place to mutual feelings of perfect reconcilia¬ tion. And could anything thus have been happier than the time and manner of this result ? It came about in this way. In the month of How it April, 1884, Mr. Whitley found himself in originated. ]^ew York after a tour undertaken for the restoration of his health, that had been some¬ what impaired by twenty years of hard work — a tour which had extended to the West Indies, Mexico, California, and other portions of the United States. Whilst in New York, on the homeward journey from San Francisco, he acci¬ dentally learnt, that several American gentlemen meant to organise in London, for the following year, an Exhibition of the arts, manufactures, and pro¬ ducts of North, Central, and South America. Said Mr. Whitley * : — “ This interested me much, for, having quite recovered my health, I was willing to engage in an undertaking which promised congenial employment for my activity ; and this idea of an American Exhibition in the British Metropolis was exceedingly attractive to me, for I felt sure that, if it were properly managed, it would afford * In an address to a meeting of manufacturers held in the rooms of the Board of Trade, Philadelphia, November 19, 1885. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION . 33 me most interesting employment, as my experience at great inter¬ national exhibitions was such as to justify my conviction, that an American Exhibition in London would be most popular. ... I was aware of the vast progress made by Americans in manufactures and commerce, and I had a strong desire to associate myself with them in the future, and to assist them to extend their relations with the Old World, and in the British Colonies; for I felt and feel sure that Europe, with its teeming millions, already looks to the United States as the vanguard in the march of both material and moral progress, and I preferred, on the occasion of my recommencing active work, to associate myself with those in the foremost ranks, rather than remain in the rear guard. I saw what an excellent oppor¬ tunity such an Exhibition would afford to Americans for making an official debut in the biggest market-place of the Old World, and it was the reverse of unpleasant to picture to myself the great possi¬ bilities for the best good of the United States, and the United Kingdom, from such a national undertaking, if only carried out with judgment, honesty of purpose, and energy.” Mr. Whitley accordingly put himself into com¬ munication with the gentlemen who had Preparatory originated the idea, and he offered to stages, render them such assistance as he could, on con¬ dition that the Exhibition should not be of the international character they contemplated, but be confined to exhibits from the United States ; for it seemed to Mr. Whitley that it was time to initiate a thoroughly new departure in exhibitions, viz., that of one nation exhibiting alone in the metropolis of another. Eventually they agreed to this modifica¬ tion, and work was at once commenced ; but though thus begun in 1884, and intended to bear full fruit in 1886, it was 1887 before it reached its com- 3 34 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. pletion, for reasons which will afterwards be de¬ tailed. Meanwhile it may he said that the inherent diffi¬ culties of the organising task undertaken by Mr. Whitley proved of a nature that would have deterred or defeated all but those possessed of the stoutest and most determined hearts. As he himself once truly said * : — “ An Exhibition organiser does not need to be a genius. He must merely possess good health and the fixed determination that nothing shall stop him. The work is special only because of the multitude of details. You will be able to form some idea of what I mean when I mention to you a detail connected with one department of the work : during the organisation and direction of the American Exhibition alone, I enjoyed the privilege of being compelled to read 27,000 letters, most of which had to be answered. ... I pass over the period which elapsed between my finding myself with the entire organisation of an Exhibition upon my hands and the opening day. If I tried your patience by giving a detailed history of that period, it would be simply a record of one long 1 uphill struggle, and I well remember wondering, at the opening ceremony, whether I were still a man or had become a machine. I may briefly state that four months before the Exhibition opened, the site at Earl s Court and West Brompton was a cabbage gaiden. We had more than 2,000 men in two In Ins Address at the German Athenaeum, October 29, 1890. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 35 gangs — one set working by day, and one by night. I was navvy, clerk, host, and cicerone by turns, and occasionally found myself fast asleep, from sheer fatigue, as I stood.” But this is anticipating somewhat. Mr. Whitley’s proposal having been accepted, practical work began by his consulting preliminary some of the most prominent men in Great Wp^“cl Britain as to how such an undertaking was opinion, likely to be received by the English public, which, of course, would contribute by far the larger number of visitors to see this practical evidence of the progress made by Americans in arts and industries. The result was that a number of gentlemen, repre¬ senting almost every class of society in England, declared, that they thought such an Exhibition as the one proposed would not only be of the greatest possible interest and value, but extremely popular with the masses. Representative Americans were next consulted, and the answer from the other side of the Atlantic was identical with the one received from Englishmen, though much more modest ; for Americans desired to know, first of all, whether even a peaceful invasion on their part, such as contem¬ plated, would really be welcomed in the Old World. The better to prove to the people of America that they would be most cordially received with the truest hospitality and friendship, a Council of Welcome was immediately formed by Mr. Whitley in England, con¬ sisting of about a thousand gentlemen distinguished in 36 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. art, literature, science, manufactures, and commerce ; * while the Press of the Anglo-Saxon world, with The Times at its head, hailed the proposed under¬ taking in words of warmest appreciation, and within about a twelvemonth of the time when the proposal was first mooted, it had been made the subject of about 8,000 laudatory articles in the newspapers of the two countries. It having thus been demonstrated, in a general way, that there were no insuperable objections to the undertaking on the part of the British public, it became necessary to determine the best manner of organising and developing the whole scheme. Hitherto all great Exhibitions had been under the fostering care of one Government or another. But it was naturally unbecoming that the United States Government should take the initiative, and ask per¬ mission for an official Exhibition to be held in the * The following were the Vice-Presidents of the Honorary Council of Welcome:— His Eminence Henry Edward, Cardinal Manning; His Grace the Duke of Roxburghe ; His Grace the Duke of Manchester, Iv.P. ; His Grace the Duke of Northumberland ; His Grace the Duke of Wel¬ lington ; His Grace the Duke of Sutherland, K.G. The following were the Executive Committee: — Lord Ronald Gower; John R. Whitley, Esq.; Sir H. P. De Rathe, Bart.; E. North Buxton, Esq.; Sir Charles Clifford, Bart. ; Sir J. J. Cogliill, Bart. ; Wilkie Collins, Esq.; Sir Joseph Fayrer j Sir John R. Heron- Maxwell, Bart. ; Henry Irving, Esq. ; Dr. Morell Mackenzie ; Sir John E. Millais, Bart. Colonel Paget Mosley ; Major S.

The Honorary Secretary was J. Stephen Jeans, Esq. It is inter¬ esting to note that Lord Charles Beresford joined the Council of Welcome November 20, 1884, by letter from Bab-el-Kebir, near Wady-Halfa— which was “peace and war” with a vengeance. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 37 Metropolis of the United Kingdom, just as it would have been equally absurd to expect that the British Government should invite American citizens to come and exhibit in London evidences of their wealth and progress in civilisation, seeing that, however much an Exhibition of this kind might prove interesting to the individual Englishman, it could not possibly concern the British Government as such. It there¬ fore devolved upon private persons to take the initiative, either in an individual or in a corpo¬ rate capacity. It was, of course, evident that the adoption of this course would provoke criticism from all those who had been in the habit of looking for governmental aid in such undertakings. This prospective criticism, however, only acted as an additional incentive to Mr. Whitley, and the American colleagues whom he had invited to associate themselves with him, to demonstrate what individual effort could accomplish. The plans ot organisation were presented in detail to the principal United States Consuls resident in Europe— “ those watch-dogs of American interests abroad” — and, without exception, the enterprise was commended in the warmest and most unreserved terms by these gentlemen, who well knew what would be the re¬ quirements for a thorough representation of the ever-increasing industries and resources of the New World.* Letters of the warmest commendation and encouragement were received by Mr. Whitley, among others, from the United States Consuls at St. Petersburg, Bradford, Berne, Munich, Diisseldorf, Leeds, Frankfort- 38 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON Of course, the National Government could not be asked to give any pecuniary assistance ; to have done this would have been to abandon the funda¬ mental principle of the idea. But its originators hoped that so complete a display of the products and resources of the States and Territories of the Union could be made, that any capitalist seeking an investment, or any discriminating man desirous of fixing his home there, would, after several visits to the proposed Exhibition, be in a position to arrive at a reliable conclusion as to what it would be best for him to do ; and that in this way the Exhibition would become, as it did, a national undertaking in the broadest and best sense of the term. To carry out to a successful issue so great an Formation undertaking as an Exhibition in London of ot the “ arts, inventions, manufactures, and products ” of so vast a country as the United States of America, it was manifest to Mr. Whitley, that one of his first tasks must be to call to his assistance the best and most trustworthy men obtainable on both sides of the Atlantic — to form his Cabinet, so to speak ; and the chief of the Ameri¬ can section of this Cabinet was ultimately found in Colonel Henry S. Bussell, of Boston, a man of the on-the-Main, Genoa, Palermo, Bristol, Moscow, Dresden, Stockholm, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Stettin, Dundee, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Dublin, Sheffield, Nottingham, Vienna, Cardiff, Bordeaux, Rheims, London, Brussels, Belfast, Marseilles, Barcelona, Constantinople, Paris, Birmingham, Rotterdam, Cognac, Bremen, Antwerp, Havre, Cadiz, Leghorn, Bologna, Edinburgh, Rome, Catania, Berlin, Malta, Falmouth, Southampton, &c.

Another valuable acquisition to the American Committee was made in the person of General General A. J. Goshorn, of Cincinnati, who, Gosborn- having been Director-General of the great Phila¬ delphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, was a tower of organising strength. He wrote Mr. Whitley as follows : — “ Cincinnati, 0 “ 25th November, 1885. “ Dear Sir, — I was extremely pleased to meet you last week in New York, and I now wish to convey to yourself and your colleagues my thanks for all the particulars which you have communicated to me regarding the important work you have undertaken. It is a new work both in its essence and in its arrangement, and I am sure that it will promote greatly the material interests of our country, and more especially of those industries which will take steps to he worthily represented at the Exhibition. Everything promises that the Exhibition will be a complete success, and that it will be to the advantage of exhibitors to join you. You may count on my sympathy and fall encourage¬ ment in the great work you have undertaken. “ A. J. Goshorn. The Hon. E. B. Washburne, too, ex-Minister of the United States at Paris, consented to become prominently associated with an Wasllburn0‘ undertaking which, as he himself said at a banquet given him by the supporters and promoters of the Exhibition in Philadelphia, “ the City of Brotherly Love,” “would conduce to a better knowledge of 40 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. tlie resources and capacities of our country, and bind together two great nations in closer ties of amity and goodwill.”* Finally, and above all, Mr. Whitley succeeded in procuring for his scheme the .better to President count enance and patronage of the Hon. Grover Cleveland. Qjevejan^ President of the United States, with whom he had twro interviews in the course of his various visits to America, and to wdiom he addressed the following letter, which, though dated from Philadelphia at a subsequent period, had better be quoted, in part, here : — “ I desire to convey to you some faint expression of tlie pleasure * Replying to the toast of his health at this banquet, Mr. Washburne said : “ I accepted, Mr. Chairman, the position of the president of the American Exhibition in London, so honourably tendered, only after much Hesitation. I believed that the position should have gone to a man of more experience in such matters, but when I saw the names of all the honourable gentlemen and experienced administrators who are associated with it, I yielded my first impressions. I found that I was to be associated with gentlemen whom I deemed it a high honour to be con¬ nected with in such an enterprise, and one which promised so much to my country. The proposition of an American Exhibition in England, in the heart of the greatest city in the world, was a happy inspiration ; it gives our country an opportunity to make known to England and to all Europe what has been our progress in the arts, the sciences, and in manufactures, and in the development of all those great industries which have been subordinated to the uses and purposes of man. There were, I believe, 10,000,000 admissions to the Centennial Exhibition ; of this number, I am told, it has been estimated that not more than 1 per cent, were Europeans. If the Centennial did so much to make America known abroad, how much will be accomplished by this American Exhibition, where, of the millions who will go to see it, not more than 1 per cent, will be Americans all the rest being foreigners. It will tell the story of her greatness to the furthermost ends of the earth. England stretches out her hand of welcome. Let us grasp it in the spirit in which it is proffered. Let us show to the whole world how much has been accom¬ plished where liberty, regulated by law, has been sublimated to the highest degree.” THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 41 you Lave afforded my colleagues and myself by being associated, as Honorary President, with the first American Exhibition of the Arts, Manufactures and Resources of the United States ever held beyond the limits of the national territory. By accepting this position you recognise and encourage American commerce, and foster American industries. “By similar action the rulers of Europe, who can justly lay claim to enlightenment, have always had cause for self-congratulation, whether the Exhibition of which they were the Honorary Presidents happened to be governmentally managed or not. In this instance it was obvious that an Exhibition held in the British metropolis, and exclusively devoted to the Arts, Inventions, Manufactures, Products, and Resources of the United States, could not be initiated by the Government of this country, and hence the United States Government has not been askel, and will not be asked, to vote any funds for the undertaking. But it will be invited to become an exhibitor in the same manner as the great Corporations, Railroads, and private firms have been invited to become exhibitors. Just in the same way as the people of Great Britain are now daily applauding the efforts of the Prince of Wales to extend England’s friendly relations with other Powers by the three annual Exhibitions he has held in London ; and just in the same way as the British people are further applauding the Prince’s efforts to aid, through the forthcoming Colonial and Indian Exhibition, in bringing about a federation of the British Empire, so the American people will recognise the interest you take in the welfare of your own country by extending your coun¬ tenance to this new departure, fraught as it is with so much prospective advantage to American trade and industries. “ Under the active and cordial guidance of the Hon. E. B. Wasli- burne, of Illinois, Gen. A. J. Goshorn, of Cincinnati, and the other officers of the Exhibition, you may safely rely upon the American Exhibition in London becoming one of which Americans will have every reason to be proud.” 42 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON . Certainly Mr. Whitley’s Cabinet, whether active A i or honorary, could not have been filled by American better men in America than President Cleveland, Mr. Washbnrne, Colonel Bussell, and General Goshorn, Major Burnet Landreth, Col. E. A. Buck, Mr. W. D. Guthrie, &c. ; while in England he was fortunate in being able to enlist the practical sympathy and support of such men as Lord Bonald Gower, Mr. John Priestman, Mr. Alfred Pickard, and Mr. Vincent A. Applin.* * A memorandum, written by Mr; Whitley in 1887, says : “ After I originated the idea of the Exhibition in its present form, Mr. Alfred Pickard joined me, and has done nothing else since. Two months later Mr. Applin joined us, and has done nothing else since. One month after Mr. Applin came, Lord Ronald Gower joined us. Three months later Mr. Speed was invited by me to represent our enterprise in the United States. This was in November, 1884, and in December of the same year Mr. Priestman joined us. Some time during 1885 Major Burnet Landreth fortunately became associated with us ; and almost simultaneously Mr. Guthrie, Colonel Buck, Colonel Griffin, Mr. Bierstadt, and Governor Furnas joined. In September, or October, 1885, Colonel Russell joined us, also Mr. William Goldring, and finally in 1886 the following gentle¬ men were induced to join the standard : Mr. Rufus M. Smith, Mr. John Sartain, Dr. Norvin Green, Mr. John Lucas, Mr. Thomas Cochran, Mr. N. K. Fairbank, General John R. Carson, Mr. H. T. Coleman, Mr. W. H. Thomson, Colonel William Edwards, Colonel L. N. Dayton, Mr. John English Green, and Mr. W. Lee Thornton, whilst Mr. Alfred Johnson and Mr. T. C. Penfield joined us since the commencement of this year (1887).” With regard to the personalities of the above-named gentlemen, the following details were published at the time of the Exhibition : Colonel Henry S. Russell, of Boston, the President of the Exhibition, is one of the most highly esteemed men in New England. James Russell Lowell, late Minister to England, said of him, “ During our Civil War he was a gallant soldier, and in private life he has always been an excellent and useful citizen. I have known him all his life, and never knew any¬ thing of him but good.” Colonel Russell is a man of large resources, and is prominently identified with the Bell Telephone interests in America. Writing in October, 1885, to Mr. Whitley, Mr. Edward VINCENT A. APPLIN THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 43 American Head¬ quarters and Exhibition Organ. At the invitation of a number of those who contributed to make the “ Centennial ” the success it was, the Organising Board selected Philadelphia as its headquarters in the United States, that it might profit by the valuable assistance of many who had gained experience in the management of the great International Exhibition of 1876, and who, indeed, looked upon the proposed American display in London as a natural sequence of that great gather- Atkinson, the well-known statist of Boston, U.S., said : “I congratulate you upon the appointment of Col. Henry S. Bussell as President of the American Exhibition, proposed to be held in London next May. When he accepts this offer his name will give a reason for confidence in the management of the Exhibition which may have been somewhat lacking in this section up to this time. His appointment and acceptance may therefore give such assurance of adequate contributions from the manu¬ facturing sections of the East as will render the Exhibition a true exponent of American art, industry, and manufactures.” — Captain Burnet Landreth, of Philadelphia, is a member of the great seed firm of D. Landreth and Sons. He served with distinction during the wars of the rebellion, and his experience as a soldier developed in him great abilities as an executive officer. He was Chief of the Bureau of Agri¬ culture at the Centennial Exhibition of 187G, and gave to that depart¬ ment remarkable prominence and importance. — Mr. John Gilmer Speed is a well-known journalist, having been managing editor of the Neiu york World, He is the author of a “Life of Keats,” and editor of his letters, and was connected with the United States Transport Bureau at the Centennial Exhibition. — Lord Bonald Gower, brother to the Duke of Sutherland, was educated with the Prince of Wales, has travelled widely, and is a sculptor and art connoisseur of repute. His book, “ My Reminiscences,” bears evidence of the breadth of his views on all matters of international interest. He has been also for a long time trustee of the National Gallery. — Mr. Vincent Augustin Applin is a member of the Incorporated Law Society, and Solicitor of the Supreme Court. His thorough knowledge of English law made his services invaluable to the enterprise, and his devotion to and efficiency in the work have been most admirable. During several weeks’ en¬ forced absence of Mr. Whitley, in December, 1886, the whole of his 44 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. ing. The better, moreover, to popularise and promote the Exhibition idea, no less than with the view of meeting the numerous inquiries whicdi were constantly being received in reference to it, as well as in order to keep intending ex¬ hibitors, Members of the Council of Welcome and of the General Council, and others fully advised of the progress made by the Executive Council, it was determined to publish a monthly journal ; and the first number of The American Eagle* was issued March 4, 1885 — that being work rested upon Mr. Applin’s shoulders. — Colonel J. T. Griffin, of New York, had been for 25 years identified prominently with the manufacture and improvement of agricultural machinery, and was the pioneer in introducing the result of American ingenuity in that direction to Great Britain, Europe, and the Colonies. He was one of the founders of the Agricultural Engineers Association in England, of which he was for three successive years president. He has likewise been identified with the promotion in London of many large companies, for the purpose of developing the resources of his native country. — Mr. E. A. Buck, of New York, is well known as the Editor of the Spirit of the Times, and prominently identified with several railway enterprises. His journal is the authority in America on all American sports and kindred matters, and he is himself an enthusiastic sportsman as well as an able man of business. — Mr. W illiam Lee Thornton is an Englishman, though born in Russia. He was a Director ot Thornton’s Woollen Mills Company, and interested in various industrial enterprises in Russia. — Mr. William D. Guthrie, of New York, is a member of the firm of Seward, Da Costa, and Guthrie, one of the most prominent legal firms in the United States, acting, as they do, for such institutions as the Bank of England, the Cunard Steamship Company, the Adams Express Company, and other corporations of equal standing and importance. Mr. Guthrie, by his legal acumen and eloquence, has placed himself at the very front of the junior Bar, and has still found time to identify himself with many other public movements as well as important private enterprises. — Mr. John Priestman is well known as the European Manager of Bradstreet’s Mercantile Agency, a position of great responsibility. On the opening ot the Exhibition this organ dropped the “ Ecijle THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 45 the day of the inauguration, as President of the United States, of Mr. Grover Cleveland, during whose administration the American Exhibition was to be held. The monthly issue was about 15,000 copies, which were sent to the members of the Council of Welcome, and of the General Council of the American Exhibition ; to all Members of Legislature in Great Britain and America, to leading manufacturers, merchants, and agriculturists in the United States. Governors of States and Territories, Mayors of the principal United States Cities, the Editors of the principal journals and magazines in Europe, America, and the Colonies, to United States Ministers and Consuls throughout the world, and to the principal Bankers, Hotel Proprietors, Railroad and Steamship Companies, &c., of Europe and the United States.

On every hand, from prince to peasant, he received the most hearty assurances of support, the President of the French Republic even suggesting the holding in and became The American — “ The Daily Official Programme and Journal of tlie Exhibition.” 46 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. Paris of a similar American display, as one which would be very popular and warmly welcomed.* Wherever, too, in the United States the objects and details of the undertaking had been discussed, they had been favourably received by the repre¬ sentative manufacturers, merchants, and citizens generally, from Maine to California, and from the Lakes down to the Gulf of Mexico ; and volumes of newspaper cuttings exist to prove that no great undertaking had ever been commented upon by the public and the Press less unfavourably than the proposed American Exhibition. Taken in connection with the offers of assistance from the principal Governors of States and Mayors of American Cities, and with the reports of United States Consuls in Europe respecting the importance of the Exhibition, the following short extract from the Report of the Board of the United States Com¬ missioners at the “World’s Industrial and Cotton Cen¬ tennial Exposition ” (New Orleans), was most encou¬ raging. “ The Committee thinks, however, that to the United States this American Exhibition is of so much vaster importance than any other ever held or * A Paris telegram to The Times , dated April 10, 1885, said:— “ Mr. John Eobinson Whitley, Director-General of the American Exhibition, which opens in May, 1886, in London, and Lord Ronald Gower, a member of the Executive Council, were entertained at luncheon to-day by President Grevy, in the Palace of the Elysee. The President of the Republic takes a deep interest in this the first Ex¬ hibition held in Europe by the Transatlantic Sister Republic, and suggests that a similar Exhibition in Paris would be most popular and most warmly welcomed.” THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION, 47 projected, that it should be the bounden duty of every citizen of our country to contribute in every way possible to the end that the Exhibition of next year may be a thorough and faithful exposition of the arts, manufactures, products, and resources of every State and Territory of the Union.” Accord¬ ingly a memorial was unanimously adopted and signed on the 25th of April, 1885, in New Orleans, by the above-mentioned Board, praying that the Presi¬ dent of the United States and the Governors of the various States and Territories should use their best endeavours to see “that the arts, manufactures, products, and resources of the whole country be properly displayed at the American Exhibition in London ” ; praying also that the Congress of the United States would make suitable provision for an official exhibit, and assist the States and Ter¬ ritories in their efforts to display their material achievements and resources. The memorial further petitioned that Congress would see fit to authorise the use of public vessels in transporting the official exhibits of the National Government, the States and the Territories, to and from London. As it turned out, the prayer of this memorial was never fulfilled in its entiiety, thanks to the combined effects of malice and misrepresentation, coupled with other causes ; but none the less was this petition a signal proof of the popularity of the Exhibition idea throughout the States. But as the United States Government was not 48 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON . and could not have been asked to vote any funds for the undertaking itself, it was necessary to provide them from other sources. The funds required for preparatory work were at once subscribed, Mr. Whitley himself making the largest contribution.* Thus the work of organisation went on rapidly and well, on both sides of the Atlantic; Another Tour in and in September, 1885, Mr. Whitley America. aga«n sa£e(i for New York, whence he undertook another tour among the chief centres of industry in America. Amongst other well-known Americans who promised to exhibit was Mr. George M. Pullman, who personally entertained Mr. Whitley, showing him over the town of Pullman, near Chicago, which was even then of such extent that the trip could be made on a locomotive. Mr. Pullman offered to exhibit a model (covering an area of about 10,000 sq. feet) of his beautiful little city ; but this exhibit, like many other interesting ones, was not sent to London owing to the postponement of the Exhi- * Some weeks before the opening of the Exhibition Mr. Whitley determined to arrange, if possible, for some well-known firm of accountants, not only to audit the books of the undertaking, but also to keep the books, his desire being not to incur even a moral re¬ sponsibility in this connection. After conferring with Messrs. Tur- quand, Youngs, Weise, Bishop, and Clarke, the well-known accountants, of Coleman Street, he gave that firm the preference and engaged their services. From March, 1887, until the close of the German Exhibition in October, 1891, Messrs. Turquand, Youngs, and Co., therefore superintended the whole of the accounts, the importance of which may be estimated by the fact that about half a million pounds sterling passed through their hands during that period. Their management of the book-keeping of the Exhibitions was beyond all praise. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 49 bition, concerning which more anon. Of this tour the culminating point was reached at Philadelphia, where, in the Board of Trade Ptooms, thanks to the influence and exertions of Mr. Burnet Landreth, Mr. Whitley addressed a representative meeting of manufacturers, exporters, and others on the objects of his proposed Exhibition. It was on this occa¬ sion that he was offered a complimentary banquet by a “ Council of Welcome” in Philadelphia;* * Of this complimentary banquet (Nov. 21, 1885) the Philadelphia Press gave the following account : — “ Thirty-one gentlemen in evening dress sat around a big oval table in the banqueting-room of the Hotel Bellevue, Philadelphia, last night. Big bushes of chrysanthemums and carnations filled the centre of the table, and ropes of ivy were strung from chandelier to chandelier, over the heads of the company. At the centre of the table, in the President’s chair, sat Thomas Cochran, President of the Guarantee Trust Company. At his right was the broad-shouldered, fine-featured Director-General of the American Ex¬ hibition to be held in London next summer, John Robinson Whitley, in compliment to whom the company had assembled. Besides Mr. Whitley and Mr. Cochran, the chairman, there were at table : — The Hon. William D. Kelly, Hon. Thomas H. Dudley, James Dobson, W. A. Patou, Thomas Dolan, Charles Emory Smith, Thomas M. Walter, General vjrubb, John Dobson, Thomas Donaldson, A. E. Ford, Henry C. Terry, Samuel Horner, jun., Thomas D. Wattson, William H. Nixon, Ralph F. Cullinan, E. C. Knight, Joseph M. Wilson, J. Henry Zeilin, Colonel II. S. Russell (of Boston), John G. Speed (of New York), Simon H. Stern (of New York), Frederick Godholz, Burnet Landreth, John Lucas, Frank Wells, Mayer Sulzberger, Julius Chambers, and Jerome Carty. Mr. Cochran, in a few introductory remarks, said that he would do all he could to promote the success of the Exhibition, and to remove pre¬ judices that he understood existed against it. Mr. Stern spoke enthu¬ siastically of the prospects of the enterprise, and added, ‘ It is impossible, in my opinion, that the Exhibition can be anything but a success.’ Mr. Whitley himself, in a conservative tone, explained the purpose and scope of the proposed show. Judge Kelly said: ‘Let us, as a people, give prosperity to this Exhibition, and show the English people that by the planting of their insular seeds in a country which invites to activity and the best impulses, man has been developed and may be developed.’ Mr. Dudley responded to the toast of ‘ Commerce,’ Charles Emory 4 50 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. and from this banquet he hastened home to London (in December, 1885) with his schemes so far matured, that little now remained to he done save the allotment of space and the issuing of orders for the construction of the buildings at Earl’s Court, where a site, combining more advantages than any other in the United Kingdom, had at last been selected for the American Exhibition. It was when the preparations for the Exhibition Difficulties had reached this advanced stage, towards the end of 1885, that a difficulty cropped up which at first threatened to frustrate the whole enterprise. This was the postponement of the Exhibition from 1886 to 1887, in spite of the cogency of the reasons which had induced its organiseis to select the former of these years, and which had also found favour with the public of both countries. Had it not been determined to hold the American Exhibition at the same time as the British Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington (in 1886), the great American nation would have been the only one amongst the English speaking races unrepresented in the British rnetro- ^.ft0 T1^e ^res8> Frank Wrells to the ‘Educational Features o: twr 0DSi’ Ca° 0nel Eusse11 to <New England/ and John Lucas tc onsuar ervice.^ The occasion altogether was a decided success.’ tiring Ins various visits to the principal American cities Mr. Whitlej fW, “ “a<J® ““ honorary member of the following clubs Tit _ ituiy the Union League,” and the “Saturday Night” Clubs, oi New Lork ; the “Somerset,” the “ Uniou,” and tlie “ St. Botolph” Clubs; T e»„°n ’ wbe C, ™ag0 Club ” and “ Union Club,” Chicago ; the “ Union “Pernh, H°U^’ ,I’lldadelphla ; the “Queen City Club,” Cincinnati; the ■ mas Club, Louisville (Ky.) ; and the “Hartford Club,” Hartford, THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 51 polis; and was not America every bit as much an English colony, albeit free and independent, as Aus¬ tralia ? As one American versifier put it : — “ To fcliee, 0 Mother England, it is meet That we, who from thy womb inherited The blood of nations; from thy tongue our tongue, And from thy books the justice of our laws, Should in maturer years our offerings bring, And at thy feet our fruit of progress lay.” Besides, it was calculated that one Exhibition would aid the other, as the opportunity of inspecting both would double the practical value of each, no less than the advantage and enjoyment of all their visitors. In 1886 large numbers of visitors, in¬ cluding some of the wealthiest Princes, Rajahs, Parsees, &c., were expected from India, and this was thought to be an additional inducement to hold the American Exhibition in that year, as thus affording an opportunity, for the first time, of bringing American sellers into direct communication with buyers from the East. “ The year 1886,” wrote The Times , u will apparently be a busy one in Exhibitions, and there is a certain fitness in the proposal that a great Colonial and great xAmerican Show should take place simultaneously.” But though the synchronous holding of the two Exhibitions was thus looked upon ap¬ provingly by the outside public, the idea in high, encountered anything but favour among quaiteis- the direct promoters of the Colonial Show, who 52 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDOti. feared that the success of an undertaking in which the Prince of Wales was known to be most deeply interested might be imperilled by something in the nature of a competitive enterprise. Mr. Whitley and his friends, to whom the fears and wishes existing in those high regions were duly communi¬ cated in an indirect and unofficial manner, were thus confronted with a very grave difficulty, and there ensued much anxious cabling between London and New York. For it was clear that the postpone* ment of the Exhibition would expose its authors to the risk of forfeiting many exhibitors, as also to the certain loss of a considerable sum of money, while “ marking time*” The correspondence between Consul - General Waller and Mr. Whitley * sufficiently ex* Postpone- . ° ment of the plained from what high authorities came that “ consensus of counsel and advice” which ultimately influenced the Executive Council’s decision — but only faintly indicated the pressure which had been brought to bear against holding the American Exhibition simultaneously with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition.

THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION . 53 “unison of opinion” for holding the Exhibition a year later had received the warm support of His Excellency the Hon. E. J. Phelps, United States Minister to Great Britain, and of Governor T. M. Waller, the United States Consul-General in London, that the Executive Council felt justified in seriously considering so important a change in their plans. The argument of courtesy, however, to the Management of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition (preparations for which were initiated prior to those of the American one) gained the day and decided the question. So the English Director-General of the Exhibition determined, though at the prospect of very great pecuniary sacrifice to himself and detriment to his plans, to defer to the well-known desire of the illustrious patron of the Colonial Gathering, and telegraphed across the Atlantic that the Exhibition had been postponed till the year 1887.* The result was what many had feared, and some foreseen. In the States postponement Disastrous was, naturally enough, held to be tan- tamount to doubt and failure, and a large ment- number of intending exhibitors at once withdrew * As The Times wrote : “ The Executive Council of the American Exhibition announce that the date of opening the Exhibition has been changed from May 1 of the present year to May 2, 1887. The considera¬ tions which have influenced the Executive Council are, it is stated by Mr. J. B. Whitley, the Director-General of the Exhibition, largely based upon the claims of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition to undivided support and attention this year. From the correspondence that has passed between Mr. Whitley and Consul-General Waller it is clear that 54 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON tlieir names. Thus the enterprise was threatened with total collapse, and this particular kind of danger was increased by the secret play of those unworthy motives and passions which spring from personal jealousy, malice, and misrepresentation. That motives of this character had been busily at work was clearly proved a few months later, when General Goshorn, of Cincinnati, suddenly withdrew his name from the General Council, although at first he had been one of Mr. Whitley’s warmest supporters. Comparing, therefore, the letter* which General Goshorn had written him in November, 1885, with the one (24th of June, 1886) in which General Goshorn now announced his inexorable resolve to cut his connection with the Exhibition enterprise, it was no wonder that Mr. Whitley, in replying to the General, referred to his defection as u the most disheartening and embarrassing contre¬ temps which had arisen since the commencement of our work”; adding, that he “ should have supposed that he (the General) would be the last man to jump ashore almost as soon as his foot had touched the deck of a ship bound upon so fruitful and beneficent a mission.” On the other hand, it was, perhaps, some little comfort for Mr. Whitley to know how Colonel H. S. Russell (who had now become President of the Exhibi- the action of the council in deferring the Exhibition is intended, and it ns hoped that it may be considered, in the light of an International courtesy.” See p. 39 ante , TEE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 55 tion) had written to its Director in America (Mr. Landreth) : — “ To my mind any of us will be acting dishonourably if we turn tail on Mr. Whitley till we know from him that we are to stop. For myself, I have seen no indication of his inability to carry out all he has set forth. One year ago I made full inquiry, here and in England, as to his character and ability, and I have never had the least cause to change the very favourable impression which I received from all. Let us be fair, and not desert him now before he shows any weakness.” Another most vexatious thing with which Mr. Whitley also had to contend was the with- In America drawal of President Cleveland from the agam- Honorary Presidency of the Exhibition, the first citizen of the United States himself having also been successfully worked upon by the foes of the enterprise. But, far from disheartening him, these difficulties only served to render Mr. Whitley all the more determined to achieve his aim and belie his detractors. He at once returned to America, and, accompanied by his most trusted lieutenant and friend, Mr. Applin, visited some of the most im¬ portant States and cities, including Boston, Hartford, New York, AVashington, Chicago, Cincinnati, Louis¬ ville, Philadelphia, Ac., lecturing, persuading, ques¬ tioning and being questioned, removing false impressions, and bringing back stray sheep to the fold. But many of the most valuable and representative had already wandered away beyond recovery, especially in the Eastern States, and in 56 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. spite of all his exertions, the prospect was by no means so encouraging as it might have been. On the second occasion of his visiting Washing- o o west versus ton, Mr. Whitley was sitting at an hotel East. window, waiting for a promised inter¬ view with President Cleveland, when his attention was arrested by the passing of a strange proces¬ sion. It was not a circus, though somewhat like one, perhaps, at first sight, but only the “ Wild West ” Show of a personage (more of whom hereafter) popularly known as “ Buffalo Bill ” — a Show which presented living and moving pictures of a fast -vanishing phase of national exist¬ ence, on the ever - receding frontier - line between the territory of the wdiite man and the happy hunting-grounds, or “ reservations,” of the redskins. While contemplating this curious pageant, this presentation of the conflicting forces of semi¬ savagery and civilisation, a sudden thought struck Mr. Whitley. “ Why not console ourselves,” he asked, “ for the defection of the Eastern States by enlisting on our side those of the West ? Is not ‘ Buffalo Bill,’ with his cowboys and his Indians, every bit as much a genuine product of American soil as Edison’s telephones or Pullman’s railway cars ? And is it not even more unique and finite as interesting ? Would not the people of Among the promised exhibits thus lost through the cruel opposition to Mr. Whitley’s scheme, originating in England, and espoused in America, was a model of the town of PuUman, occupying an area of about 10,000 square feet — not to mention the Pullman Car industries. THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 57 England hail with delight an opportunity of seeing, at first hand almost, a phase of American life familiar to them only in the romances of Fenimore Cooper ? ” No sooner thought than done, and the following day “ Buffalo Bill” had agreed to come over to London with all his personnel of rough-riders and redskins, and all his panoramic appurtenances of forest and prairie-life in the Far West. “ Probably,” said Mr. Whitley afterwards, “ the boss cowboy, ‘Buffalo Bill,’ was never more surprised in his life, by either Indians or buffaloes, than he was by me, on the day I walked through a morass of mud in a field near Washington City, and told him that if he would bring his picture of life in the £ Wild West ’ to London, I would ensure him a hearty welcome, pay his expenses, and reward his services hand¬ somely. He is not a man easily frightened, and he accepted the invitation. His success was so great, that I was afraid he would destroy the harmony of the whole, for this ‘ Wild West ’ hue stood out in such bold relief, that it threw the other parts of our picture into the shade, and increased our regret at the large Eastern firms having left us in the lurch.” This regret was all the deeper, that it was useless bemoaning the cruel misrepresentations of those who were the cause of those Eastern manufacturers having withdrawn from participation in the Exhibition ; for, interesting and novel as this Wild West “ exhibit” might prove, yet nothing was ever farther from Mr. 58 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. Whitley’s original conception of the picture of “ America in Miniature,” which he set himself to draw than the introduction of such a predominance of deep local colour.” The manufacturing States of the East having, however, been frightened off, it was useless repining, and Mr. Whitley therefore sensibly determined to cut his coat according to his cloth. But nothing caused him more acute disappointment than being compelled to modify his picture in so radical a manner, and he fervently “made oath” that, in succeeding exhibitions of the “national” series, the arena section should not stand out so prominently as to be out of proportion with the rest. It has previously been said that, four months Exhibition before the Exhibition opened, the site of it at Earl’s Court and West Brompton was a huge cabbage-garden ; and within this brief in¬ terval, thanks to the energy with which Mr. Whitley superintended the working of 2,000 men in two gangs one set labouring by day, and one by night it had been tastefully laid out and substantially covered with all the buildings and appliances necessary for the success of the forthcoming Show. “Jt ls interesting to myself,” said Mr. Whitley m 1890, “to look back and recall the difficulties I rad in bringing the railway companies who own the and to understand the advantages to themselves o such a series of Exhibitions, and then to compare t eir ^ iew s at that period and the views they hold o ay, when, from being a no-rent-producing asset, THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION . 59 that land is now so productive to the District Bailway Company that their competitors, the Metro¬ politan Bailway Company, seriously think of taking a leaf from their book, and erecting exhibition buildings at Wembley Park.” But he did at last, by dint of much hammering and arguing, succeed in proving to his landlords, “who are several of the most important railroad companies in England,” that their interests were identical with those of the Exhibition Management ; and this he proved so conclusively that “ not only have they placed this unique site at our service at a merely nominal rent, hut are also cordially affording us every assistance in the way of approaches, stations, advertising, Ac.” And certainly the site was as advantageous as it was unique. Occupying the triangular space, twenty-four acres in extent, between Earl’s Court, West Brompton, and West Kensington, the Exhibi¬ tion grounds, with four railway stations in their immediate vicinity, were thus placed in direct communication with the whole of England, Scotland, and Wales. At these four railway stations no fewer than six hundred trains were timed to arrive daily, at the service of the ten millions of people living within one hour’s distance by rail of the Exhibition, as well as of the five millions living within half an hour’s journey, not to speak of the 150,000 strangers who, it was calculated, entered the City of London daily. Altogether, for accessibility, the site at Earl’s Oourt, with its four railway stations and five 60 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. entrances, was probably not equalled by any other in the United Kingdom. The main Exhibition building was constructed of Buildings *ron anc* 8'lass> in the simplest yet most and substantial manner, the length of the principal gallery being 1,140 feet, and its width 120 feet. Annexed was a refreshment saloon 90 feet wide by 240 feet long, and close to it the Fine Art Building, consisting of seven rooms, which, owing to the immense value of the works they were erected to contain, were built of brick and rendered perfectly fireproof. Without taking into account the gangways, passages, and the rooms required for the display of paintings and statuary, a covered space of from about 7,000 to 8,000 square metres with wooden flooring was available for exhibition purposes ; also 3,000 square metres of wall space in the large Industrial Gallery, and from 2,000 to 3,000 square metres of wall space in the Fine Art Galleries. Moreover, from 2,000 to 3,000 square metres were available in the gardens for those exhibitors who preferred to erect special pavilions. Finally, a large amphitheatre had also been erected; with seats for 15,000 to 20,000 persons, this construc¬ tion being intended for monster fetes and for repre¬ sentations of the national life, manners, and customs of the country exhibiting. After the manner of Ameri¬ can cities, the Exhibition main building and outer grounds were laid out in avenues and streets running at right angles to each other, and furnished with the THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. 61 nomenclature peculiar to New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. Never before, certainly, in the history of this country, at any rate, had buildings and Mechanism gardens of equal extent been constructed of the and arranged — one may almost say con- Exhlbltlon* jured up — in so short a space of time ; but all these results, as well as the minor triumphs of organisa¬ tion, had only been achieved by a truly Herculean power of grappling with and overcoming difficulties. Writing to a friend after the success of the Exhibition was no longer doubtful, Mr. Whitley said : — “ Remembering what this site of ours was a few months ago, you will now, doubtless, be astonished at the great length of the Main Building, with its handsome facades ; at the beauty of the Gaidens won out of a cabbage-field and a sea-kale swamp ; at the huge dimensions of the galleries in the Wild West section; at the quiet and repose which characterise the six rooms filled with choice specimens of American paintings ; as well as at the little army of janitors, policemen, turnstilemen, and clerks (whose ranks are still very numerous in spite of the fact that I have lightened and simplified their labour by turning over the whole of the bookkeeping and supervision of the accounts to Messrs. Turquand, Youngs, and Co.) ; at the Switchback Railway and the Toboggan Slide ; at the Band Stand, which is the largest in London ; at the seven bridges we had to build, including the huge structure over the railway tracks ol the London and North Western, the Great Western, the London, Brighton, and South Coast, the West London Extension, and of the London and South Western Railway Com¬ panies. This bridge (the ‘Washington’) had to be built almost exclusively on Sundays, as the railway companies would not allow 62 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. men to work, with trains passing under, except between midnight on Saturday and midnight on Sunday, when the traffic was reduced to a minimum, for fear of timber or tools falling. Consider again, my friend, that gas, water, and drain-pipes had to be laid over the whole twenty-four acres, and connected with the main culverts; that 10 ten-thousand-candle power lights had to be supplied to the Grounds, as well as 250 two thousand-candle power lights which had to be erected on masts in the main building, &c., and a tank for the surplus supply of water capable of holding 150,000 gallons ; that roads had to be constructed throughout the whole of the Grounds, and that about 10,000 loads of soil had to be carted over sleepers (laid down expressly for the purpose) to form the huge mounds which may now be seen on the Wild West section; that artists had to be employed for months painting the scenery of the Rocky Mountains for the arena ; that in the midst of all these preoccupations I had to negotiate with thirty-seven railway companies throughout the United Kingdom for conveying additional hundreds of thousands of passengers during the excursion season to and from the four stations on the Grounds ; that I had to make special arrangements with the Metropolitan Police and for the services of a Fire Brigade ; that plans for every ‘ stick and stone ’ connected with each single structure on the whole twenty- four acres had to be submitted in duplicate, and in some cases sixfold, to the Metropolitan Board of Works ; that music and liquor licenses had to be obtained and renewed ; that contracts had to be made with boiler and engine makers for the supply of engines and appliances for giving motive -power to the Main Building, and to supply power to the dynamos both for the Mam Building, Gardens, and Wild West. Then finally consider that I have not only received no financial assistance from either the American or English Governments, but, on the contrary, have had to struggle against a very active, persistent, and almost venomous opposition, originating in an official source ; — and then, perhaps, you will understand me when I say that, for months at a stretch, I felt as if I wTere working in a mine a thousand feet below the surface of the earth, a mine with no outlet to the light THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION . 63 of day, and a mine which was but an underground ‘edition of a cercle vicieux. “ Very few persons — three at most — have the slightest conception of the inferno I have gone through, since April, 1884, 'for the sake of ‘ our American Cousins.’ ” Classifica¬ tion of Exhibits. We have thus sufficiently described the nature and extent of the Exhibition Buildings and Grounds, and now we must give a general enumeration of their varied contents which the British public were invited by Mr. Whitley to come and see. No fewer than 1,078 American pro¬ ducers and manufacturers had responded to his call, and their exhibits were classified and set forth in Six Departments, viz. : — I. Agriculture. II. Mining and Metallurgy. III. Machinery. IV. Manufactures. Y. Education and Science. YI. Fine Arts. And truly when all these Departments were ready tor public inspection (as they were by the 9th of May, 1887), they constituted, with all their inevitable incompleteness and shortcomings, a display at once surprising and instructive. How varied and comprehensive were the opportunities of exhibitors may be judged from the following classification ; — 64 NATIONAL EXHIBITIONS IN LONDON. Department I. — Agriculture. CLASS 1.
