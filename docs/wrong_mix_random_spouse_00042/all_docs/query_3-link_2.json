        "text": "Highest Rated: 78% Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998)\n\nLowest Rated: 13% The Learning Curve (1999)\n\nBirthday: Aug 24, 1973\n\nBirthplace: Staten Island, New York, USA\n\nActor Carmine Giovinazzo gained notoriety as a main cast member of one of television's most popular crime dramas. After relocating to Los Angeles in 1997, the native New Yorker began to quickly accrue television credits with guest spots on such series as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (The WB/UPN, 1997-2003) and \"Pacific Blue\" (USA Network, 1996-2000). Headway into a feature film career was made with a supporting turn in the Kevin Costner baseball drama \"For the Love of the Game\" (1999) and Ridley Scott's harrowing military docudrama \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001). The most fruitful relationship of his professional career began with Giovinazzo's 2002 appearance on the long-running forensic procedural \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (CBS, 2000-15), which soon led to turns on the spin-offs \"CSI: Miami\" (CBS, 2002-12) and \"CSI: NY\" (CBS, 2004-13), making him the first actor to appear on all three shows. Given a regular cast role as Detective Danny Messer on the latter series, Giovinazzo had landed a plum role on one of TV's most dependable franchises.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n78% Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss\n\n77% Black Hawk Down\n\n60% Terror Tract\n\n57% The Big Brass Ring\n\n46% For Love of the Game\n\n13% The Learning Curve\n\nPhotos\n\nCarmine Giovinazzo Graceland, Carmine Giovinazzo, 'Home', Season 2, Ep. #11, 08/27/2014, ©USA Graceland, Carmine Giovinazzo, 'The Head of the Pig', Season 2, Ep. #10, 08/20/2014, ©USA CSI: New York, Anna Belknap (L), Carmine Giovinazzo (C), Sela Ward (R), 'Reignited', Season 9, Ep. #1, 09/28/2012, ©CBS The Player, Carmine Giovinazzo, 'The Big Blind', Season 1, Ep. #4, 10/15/2015, ©NBC CSI: New York, Gary Sinise (L), Sela Ward (C), Carmine Giovinazzo (R), 'Unspoken', Season 9, Ep. #4, 10/19/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Gary Sinise (R), 'Unspoken', Season 9, Ep. #4, 10/19/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Hill Harper (L), Carmine Giovinazzo (C), Anna Belknap (R), 'Season 9', 09/28/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Anna Belknap (R), 'Kill Screen', Season 8, Ep. #15, 04/06/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Anna Belknap (C), Eddie Cahill (R), 'Kill Screen', Season 8, Ep. #15, 04/06/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Anna Belknap (C), Eddie Cahill (R), 'Kill Screen', Season 8, Ep. #15, 04/06/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Gary Sinise (L), Anna Belknap (C), Carmine Giovinazzo (R), 'Near Death', Season 8, Ep. #18, 05/11/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Anna Belknap (L), Carmine Giovinazzo (C), Sela Ward (R), 'Reignited', Season 9, Ep. #1, 09/28/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo, 'Reignited', Season 9, Ep. #1, 09/28/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Hill Harper (L), Sela Ward (C), Carmine Giovinazzo (R), 'Reignited', Season 9, Ep. #1, 09/28/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Hill Harper (C), Sela Ward (R), 'Where There's Smoke...', Season 9, Ep. #2, 10/05/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Gary Sinise (L), Carmine Giovinazzo (R), 'Unspoken', Season 9, Ep. #4, 10/19/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Sara Mornell (L), Brooklyn Silzer (C), Carmine Giovinazzo (R), 'Unspoken', Season 9, Ep. #4, 10/19/2012, ©CBS CSI: New York, Daniel Roebuck (L), Carmine Giovinazzo (C), Gary Sinise (R), 'White Gold', Season 9, Ep. #14, 02/01/2013, ©CBS CSI: New York, Carmine Giovinazzo (L), Anna Belknap (R), 'Flash Pop', Season 8, Ep. #14, 03/30/2012, ©CBS\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit No Score Yet No Score Yet Duke Dare (Character),\n\nProducer - 2018 No Score Yet No Score Yet Pledge of Allegiance Frankie (Character) - 2003 No Score Yet 44% Columbo Likes the Nightlife Tony Galper (Character) - 2003 77% 88% Black Hawk Down Sgt.
