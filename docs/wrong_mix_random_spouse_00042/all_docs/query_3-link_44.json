        "text": "Carmine Giovinazzo -- who plays Detective Danny Messer on \"CSI: NY\" -- was busted for DUI in Scottsdale, AZ last week ... and cops say he couldn't have been a nicer guy during the arrest.\n\nAccording to the police report, obtained by TMZ, cops located 39-year-old Carmine swerving all over all the road around 2:40 AM on Monday January 21.\n\nWhen cops approached the vehicle, Carmine was reportedly \"immediately apologetic and told [officers] he had been driving erratic because he was lost and using the GPS.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Carmine -- who had two passengers in the white Jeep Wrangler he was driving -- explained he was not from AZ.\n\nCops say Carmine stank of booze, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring his speech. When asked if he had been drinking, cops say the actor fessed up to having scotch at the W Hotel.\n\nCarmine was eventually arrested for DUI. The arresting officer says Carmine \"repeatedly apologized to me and told me he didn't want to be an 'a**hole.'\"\n\nThe cop added, \"[Carmine] thanked me many times for not treating him like a criminal and showing him respect.\"\n\nCops say Carmine's blood alcohol level registered at .149 -- almost twice the legal limit in AZ."
