Growing up, Giovinazzo was an avid athlete. He graduated from Port Richmond High School in 1991 and attended Wagner College on a baseball scholarship. He had hoped to become a professional baseball player, but a serious back injury dashed his career plans; with the support of his family, he turned to acting. He studied acting at Wagner College and HB Studios, and spent four years working mostly non-paying roles in the New York area.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1997, Giovinazzo moved to Los Angeles. Not long afterward, he successfully landed his first Hollywood role in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot, in which his character was the show's first on-screen victim. Afterwards, he appeared in numerous guest-starring roles on television and in film, including Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, For Love of the Game, The Big Brass Ring, and Black Hawk Down. He was also cast as one of the stars of the short-lived UPN sitcom Shasta McNasty, which was nominated for a Peoples Choice Award. Other films in which he had starring roles include In Enemy Hands with William H. Macy, and Players with Freddy Rodriguez and Peter Dobson. He played Tony Galper, the victim in \"Columbo Likes the Nightlife\", the final episode of the TV series Columbo.\n\nGiovinazzo was cast as forensic scientist Danny Messer on the hit TV series CSI: NY and is the first actor to appear in all three CSI series; his CSI: NY character was introduced in the CSI: Miami episode \"MIA/NYC NonStop\" (along with the other cast members of CSI: NY), and he guest-starred in the third season of the original, Las Vegas-based CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as a street racer named Thumpy G, in the episode \"Revenge is Best Served Cold\", though it is never specified that this guest spot was in any way related to his character on CSI: NY. Giovinazzo penned the sixth season vampire-themed episode \"Sanguine Love\", joining series leads Melina Kanakaredes and Gary Sinise, who have also written episodes for the series.\n\nStarting from 2014, Giovinazzo began portraying the recurring role of Sid Markham in the second season of the USA television series Graceland. In this series, he reunited with his former CSI: NY co-star, Vanessa Ferlito.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGiovinazzo plays the guitar, and writes songs and poetry. He is also a painter, mostly in oils, and one of his paintings appeared in the \"Tri-Borough\" episode of CSI: NY. He is currently a lead vocalist in the band Ceesau, which released one album, Era of the Exposed (2008). The song \"Tear To Spare\", from this album, was played in the CSI: NY sixth-season episode \"Sanguine Love\", which Giovinazzo wrote.\n\nGiovinazzo is a cousin of Buddy Giovinazzo and Larry Romano.\n\nGiovinazzo married actress Vanessa Marcil on July 11, 2010, in a private ceremony in New York City. Giovinazzo filed for divorce in August 2012 on the basis of irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in March 2013.\n\nHis sister Alise, coincidentally, worked for the NYPD.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n-\n\nUn$uited (TV Series) (pre-production) as\n\nDamian\n\n- The Hard Way - Damian\n\n2023\n\nHigh Desert (TV Series) as\n\nNick Gattchi / Nick Gatchi\n\n- I Need a Hero (2023) - Nick Gattchi\n\n- This Doesn't Have to Be a Tragedy (2023) - Nick Gattchi\n\n- A Nod Is Not a Hello (2023) - Nick Gatchi\n\n- Get Judy off the Bed (2023) - Nick Gatchi\n\n2022\n\nThe Offer (TV Mini Series) as\n\nSonny Grosso\n\n- A Stand Up Guy (2022) - Sonny Grosso\n\n- The Right Shade of Yellow (2022) - Sonny Grosso\n\n2022\n\nBreaking as\n\nKen Pierce\n\n2020\n\nRuby Red (Short) as\n\nJim\n\n2020\n\nBatwoman (TV Series) as\n\nJohnny Sabatino\n\n- If You Believe in Me, I'll Believe in You (2020) - Johnny Sabatino\n\n2020\n\nChicago Med (TV Series) as\n\nTyler Clemons\n\n- Who Should Be the Judge (2020) - Tyler Clemons\n\n2019\n\nDuke as\n\nDare\n\n2016\n\nCriminal Minds (TV Series) as\n\nAndrew Meeks\n\n- A Badge and a Gun (2016) - Andrew Meeks\n\n2015\n\nThe Player (TV Series) as\n\nRay Capello\n\n- The Big Blind (2015) - Ray Capello\n\n2014\n\nGraceland (TV Series) as\n\nLieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- Chester Cheeto (2015) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- B-Positive (2015) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- Faith 7 (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- Echoes (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- Home (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- The Head of the Pig (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- The Ends (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- Los Malos (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n- The Unlucky One (2014) - Lieutenant Sid Markham\n\n2004\n\nCSI: NY (TV Series) as\n\nDanny Messer\n\n- Today Is Life (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- Blood Actually (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- Seth and Apep (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- White Gold (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- Nine Thirteen (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- Civilized Lies (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- Command+P (2013) - Danny Messer\n\n- The Real McCoy (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Blood Out (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Late Admissions (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Clue: SI (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- The Lady in the Lake (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Misconceptions (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Unspoken (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- 2,918 Miles (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Where There's Smoke (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Reignited (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Near Death (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Unwrapped (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Sláinte (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Kill Screen (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Flash Pop (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- The Ripple Effect (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Brooklyn Til I Die (2012) - Danny Messer\n\n- Who's There?
