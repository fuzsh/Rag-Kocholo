By the strictest deﬁnition, phytochemicals are chemicals derived from plants. However, the term is often used to describe the large number of secondary metabolic compounds found in and derived from plants. These metabolites exhibit a number of nutritional and protective functions for human welfare such as colorants, fragrances and ﬂavorings, amino acids, pharmaceuticals, hormones, vitamins and agrochemicals. Besides food, ﬁbers, fuel, cloth and shelter, a vast number of wild plants can hence provide important sources for medicines, especially in developing countries for their traditional health systems. Natural products have inspired and provided the foundation to the bulk of FDA-approved compounds and there is tremendous increase in natural products and natural products derived compounds that have been registered against many prevailing diseases. Natural product industry has shown tremendous growth and is expected to continue to do so in the near future. The present series compiles reference information on various topics and aspects about phytochemicals, including their potential as natural medicine, their role as chemo-preventers, in plant defense, their ecological role, their role in plants as well as for pathogen adaptation, and disease resistance. Volumes in the series also contain information on methods such as metabolomics, genetic engineering of pathways, molecular farming, and obtaining metabolites from lower organisms and marine organisms besides higher plants. The books in the series are hence of relevance in various ﬁelds, from chemistry, biology, biotechnology, to pharmacognosy, pharmacology, botany, or medicine. Each volume is edited by leading experts and contains authoritative contributions by renowned authors.

Bioactive molecules are present in all the food consumed, and we come to know more about them with the availability of more and more sophisticated tools and techniques. As we know more about beneﬁts of food and their molecules, we intend to improve food quality and fortify the food for human welfare and disease prevention. The aim of the book is to present the state of information about bioactive molecules present in various foods we consume daily and their effect on our physical and mental state of body. The concept of functional foods is of recent origin, but in old civilizations like that of China and India, there are sayings about consumption of selected food and their effect on well-being. Hence history is being revisited. Selection, cultivation, and domestication of plants for human welfare is almost 9,000 years old which is reconﬁrmed by a recent report from the remains of domesticated crop plants at an archaeological site in southwest Amazonia. Plants are easy to catch as compared to animals, and hunting evolved with evolution of tools and techniques with civilization of men. Thus, fruits, tubers, bulbs, and seeds were easy to gather and consumed by early men. Some chapters deal with cultivation and improvement of nutrients in food plants. The debate about food consumption and vegetarian and nonvegetarian diet or consumption of various fatty acids in oils (PUMA, MUFA, omega-3 FA) may continue for another decade. With the new facts coming out day by day, this scene changes for a while and then resets to a new concept. Whatever the diet regimen, a cereal, a pulse, and a fruit make an essential part of all diets. With the advent of new and sophisticated technology, more information available about bioactive molecules present in the food, best combinations of food components to meet nutritional requirement, and fate of ingested molecules as well as their beneﬁcial effects are known. Major part of the book is devoted to this aspect. Consumers have become very attentive to quality, safety, and health beneﬁts of food. This has direct repercussion on food industry to develop such foods, especially processed and packaged foods and particularly in terms of calorie, quality, nutritional value, and bioactive molecules present in them. Market for nutraceuticals and food supplements is growing at rapid pace with increasing middle class in developing countries and elderly population in developed countries. Therefore, this is a very\n\nv\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\ntimely compilation of information about bioactive molecules present in our daily food. Longevity of life is associated with preferential consumption of selected food which can prevent diseases and keep overall health in good condition. Society is keen to know the beneﬁts of organic food, bioactive molecules present in their food, and possibility of food fortiﬁed with beneﬁcial molecules. This has direct impact on research related to this ﬁeld by all those involved in food cultivation, processing, and production including meat quality. Certain chapters are devoted to this aspect in the book. The book is divided into ten parts (I. Favorable Regimen for Good Health and Epidemiological Studies, II. Proteins and Their Biological Activity, III. Lipids and Their Biological Activity, IV. Food Carbohydrates and Derived Compounds, V. Food Carotenoids, VI. Food Polyphenols, VII. Functional Foods, VIII. Agricultural Practices and Food Quality, IX. Methods of Food Analysis and Quality Control, X. Miscellaneous Case Studies) covering entire gamut of bioactive molecules present in daily foods like cereals (carbohydrates), pulses, and other sources (peptides and proteins); oils (lipids, fatty acids); mushrooms, wine, and fruits and vegetables (carotenoids, polyphenols, etc.); and ﬁbers and methods of analysis of some foods. Concepts like French paradox, Mediterranean diet, healthy diet of eating fruits and vegetables, vegan and vegetarian diet, and functional foods are also described with suitable case studies. Well-recognized international specialists in their respective ﬁelds of research contributed these chapters. This book will be useful to all those working in the ﬁeld of botany, phytochemistry, pharmacy, drug delivery, molecular biology, forestry, biotechnology, industrial food, and medical products. This work is arranged in 78 well-illustrated chapters. Because of the voluminous work for the treatise, this project was spread over almost 2 years, from concept to print. We would like to acknowledge the cooperation, patience, and support of our contributors who have put their serious efforts to ensure the high scientiﬁc quality of this book with up-to-date information. We are thankful to the staff at Springer, namely, Drs. S. Costa, S. Blago, and N. Clifford, for their professional support in this project.

Structurally, phenolic compounds are characterized by the presence of one or several phenolic groups, conferring their complexity and allowing to classify them into ﬂavonoids\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines\n\n5\n\n(polyphenol) or nonﬂavonoids. This large class of compounds has a well-established antioxidant activity and other beneﬁcial effects on human health. However, its interactions in human body after dietary ingestion should be better addressed. Polyamines are a group of aliphatic amines, ubiquitously produced by humans and vegetables. These compounds are able to bind to many cellular macromolecules as DNA, RNA, and proteins, conferring them the ability to promote cell proliferation, signal transduction, and membrane stabilization. Phenolics and polyamines are produced by vegetables, whereas in human organism, only polyamines can be synthesized. Considering the possible interaction of these dietary components, this chapter summarizes some phytochemicals in vegetables and the mechanisms by which these compounds are absorbed, metabolized, and affect physiological functions in humans.\n\n2\n\nPhenolic Compounds\n\nPhenolic compounds constitute an important class of secondary metabolites, notably in function of its recognized antioxidant activity, which confers quality to the food and beneﬁcial potential to the human health. These antioxidants neutralize the free radicals, by inhibiting or interrupting the chain of initiation/propagation of oxidative reactions, converting the free radicals in less harmful molecules, and repairing the oxidative damages in human cells [1]. The functionality and stability of these phytochemicals in the human body depends not only on the quantity, but also on their location in the food matrix, on the presence of other bioactive compounds and, mainly, on the binding and/or interaction between these compounds and other molecules. Interestingly, the interaction between polyphenols and biogenic amines metabolic pathways should be pointed out to emphasize the role of both molecules on the healthy or harmful characteristics of a certain food. Derived from the secondary plant metabolism, phenolic compounds constitute a group of molecules with a diversity of functions in the plant and different beneﬁcial properties for health [2, 3]. The antioxidant activity and the free radical scavenging capacity depend on their structure, number of hydroxyl groups (OH), and position on the structure [4]. These heterogeneous characteristics are due to the complex metabolic pathways, for which the phenolic compounds are synthesized and the shikimic acid pathway is the most important biosynthesis route [5, 6]. By the shikimate pathway (present in plants and absent in animals), the binding of primary metabolism occurs (carbohydrates production) with the secondary metabolism, using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4-P, pentose phosphate pathway), synthesizing chorismate, from which aromatic amino acids can be synthesized, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These amino acids are used in the protein synthesis and also as secondary metabolites, including phenolic compounds, meaning that this biosynthetic route may contribute as a regulator of primary and secondary plant metabolism [7–9]. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24) catalyzes the synthesis of trans-cinnamic acid from phenylalanine. In addition to PAL, tyrosine ammonia-lyase\n\n6\n\nH. A.

TAL catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-coumaric acid [9]. On the other hand, tyrosine can be converted in DOPA (3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine) by tyrosine dehydrogenase and in dopamine (biogenic amine) by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC; EC 4.1.1.27) (Fig. 1). Both enzymes are relevant for phenolic compounds synthesis. On the other hand, phenolic compounds may be oxidized by polyphenol oxidases (PPO, EC 1.10.3.2 or EC 1.14.18.1), such as tyrosinase, cresolase, catecholase, diphenolase, and phenolase or peroxidases (POD, EC 1.11.1.7). High POD and PPO activities are related to the production of browning compounds, with decrease in the commercial value and loss of quality, including nutritional beneﬁts [10, 11]. To reduce oxidative enzymes activities (PPO and POD), it may be necessary for physical and chemical treatments to guarantee the nutritional quality, maintaining some phytochemicals contents, such as anthocyanins, other phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity [12–15].\n\n3\n\nPolyamines/Biogenic Amines\n\nPolyamines and/or biogenic amines have been investigated in food matrixes due to the interest regarding the nutritional paradox and its possible action as antioxidants. Previous studies indicate a possible role of polyamines, present abundantly in food of the Mediterranean diet, with the prolongation of human life [16]. Diamines, as\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines\n\n7\n\nputrescine, and polyamines (spermidine and spermine) can be formed through the decarboxylation of speciﬁc amino acids [17]. The biogenic amines are the aliphatic, cationic organic compounds of low molecular weight, formed after amino acids decarboxylation or by amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones [18, 19], which include histamine, serotonin, tyramine, 2-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and agmatine. In raw vegetables, the amines are formed from the activity of some enzymes, while in processed foods they are formed by the action of microorganisms, which can often be, depending on the amine found and on the concentration, a signal of contamination [20]. In mammals, the polyamines can be synthesized, obtained from the diet, or even, synthesized for intestinal microorganisms. In mammals, the putrescine biosynthesis comes from the ornithine decarboxylation by the action of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (EC 4.1.1.17), forming the diamine putrescine. In plants, there is an alternative pathway by the action of arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19) forming putrescine. Arginine is decarboxylated by ADC, forming agmatine, which forms N- N- carbamoylputrescine by the action of agmatine iminohydrolase (AIH, EC 3.5.2.12). The enzyme N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (CPA, EC 3.5.1.53) converts the product in putrescine (Fig. 1). The suppression of the putrescine synthesis from arginine could increase the amount of available arginine available for the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is responsible for maintaining normal vascular functions [21], retarding the progression of vascular diseases associated to the aging process. The diamine cadaverine is produced by microorganisms and originated from lysine decarboxylation, by lysine decarboxylase [22]. Both in mammals and plant cells, spermidine is formed from the addition of aminopropyl group in putrescine by the action of spermidine synthase (SPDS, EC 2.5.1.16) and spermine synthase (SPMS, EC 2.5.1.16) and adds another aminopropyl group to the spermidine, forming spermine. In parallel, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is decarboxylated by SAM decarboxylase (SAMDC, EC 4.1.1.50) and provides aminopropyl groups to the formation of spermidine and spermine. All three, ODC, ADC, and SAMDC, are regulatory enzymes (rate-limiting) of the polyamines synthesis [23, 24]. The polyamines oxidation occurs via amines oxidases. Diamine oxidase (DAO, EC 1.4.3.6) oxides putrescine or cadaverine in primary amino groups, forming 4- aminobutanal, which cyclics, forming delta-1-pirroline and hydrogen peroxide, and polyamine oxidase (PAO, EC 1.5.3.3) oxides spermidine and spermine. Tri- and tetramines oxidations produce hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1). During the polyamines oxidation, there is also a formation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a nonprotein amino acid that acts as a endogenous molecular marker, with inhibitory action of neurotransmitters in animal cells [25]. The food enriched with GABA became popular due to their functional effects and regarding the health in the arterial pressure regulation, cardiac frequency, relieve of pain, and anxiety [26]. Polyamines present a series of functions in cells from prokaryotes and eukaryotes organisms. In plants, they have an important role in the growth,\n\n8\n\nH. A. Gomez-Gomez et al.\n\ndifferentiation, synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, membrane stability, resistance, senescence, programmed cells death, adaptive responses to the environment, among others [27–30]. In addition, these molecules in mammals are involved in some diseases as Alzheimer and cancer [31]. Studies demonstrate increase in polyamines levels in the urine and serum [32], as well as induce the activity of enzymes involved in the polyamines synthesis, as ODC in tumor cells [33]. Biotic and abiotic stresses lead to oxidative stress, which is, many times, quickly manifested with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are important signaling molecules, but are toxic in high concentrations. ROS affect many cell functions by damaging the nucleic acids, oxidizing proteins, and causing lipid peroxidation [34]. The polyamines have a double role against the ROS accumulation in stressful conditions and are considered osmoprotectors and ROS scavengers. The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are positively charged at physiological pH and can bond to membrane cell groups negatively charged and prevent damages caused by stress factors in plants [35]. In addition, polyamines can interact with negatively charged molecules as DNA and RNA through electrostatic bonding [36]. This bonding stabilizes the DNA structure, mainly by bonding with spermidine and spermine [37, 38]. Spermidine and spermine (not putrescine), when in high concentrations (above 10 mM), provide protection against damages from DNA radiation [39]. However, in submM levels, it is ineffective and can slightly promote damages caused by gamma radiation. Other studies afﬁrm that the polyamines have the ability to induce the DNA compaction and aggregation, besides acting as a scavenger of free radicals, mainly OH generated by gamma irradiation [39, 40], thus becoming a DNA protector cell. The antioxidant action of some biogenic amines and polyamines correlates to the quantity of amino groups in their chemical structures. Studies have shown that amines as dopamine present a higher in vitro antioxidant capacity (through DPPH test), comparing to other natural antioxidants, as ascorbic acid [41]. In addition, it has been claimed that the increased intake of polyamines present in foods led to augmented intracelular amounts of these metabolites, promoting vascular health in humans. The increase in intracelular polyamines suppresses the enzymatic activity required for their synthesis. Some biogenic amines (histamine, tryptamine, tyramine, putrescine, and cadaverine) are undesirable in high concentrations in the food, because they can promote respiratory problems, headaches, cardiac palpitations, hypertension, or hypotension, among other allergic diseases. Simultaneously, some polyamines (e.g., putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in high concentrations can cause the proliferation of cancer cells [42]. The association of polyamines to cancer growth/progression may be related to polyamines catabolism. The excessive ingestion of food rich in polyamines, with a consequent increase of its content in the cells, can induce apoptosis, possibly due to the increasing peroxide content which is the product of the degradation of di- and polyamines by the oxidative enzymes DAO and PAO [43], leading to the cell death.\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines\n\n9\n\nThe intake of polyamines by feed and to control of some diseases has been studied by many researches groups, with the intention of decreasing or preventing damages provoked by these amines. Cipolla et al. [44] observed, in patients with prostate cancer, that reducing polyamine diet and partial intestinal decontamination was beneﬁcial to improving the life quality and pain control. The authors also describe that 3 months after the end of this treatment, the pain came back.\n\n4\n\nProcessing Methods – Effects in the Content of Phenolic Compounds and Polyamines\n\nChanges in the phenolic compounds and polyamines compositions are of great complexity because they vary according to the structure and the type of analyzed food, besides the cooking method used to its preparation. The most of the vegetables and some fruits are preferably consumed after some type of thermal processing, which causes favorable changes in the ﬂavor and texture, increasing the food palatability. Previous studies indicate that the retention of phytochemicals and the antioxidant properties after the cooking vary considerably among the different vegetables, among the methods used in their preparation, and mainly, among the speciﬁc analyzed compounds [45, 46]. The phenolic compounds are generally considered stable to the heat, and the occasional loses in the different thermal processes are probably attributed to lixiviation. Studies indicate that rutine and other polyphenols present in vegetables (e.g., asparagus) do not degrade when heated. The rutine’s stability to heat was conﬁrmed by recovering the compounds from the water used in the boiling process [47]. Generally, methods that do not use water, e.g., steaming, lead to an increase in the total phenolic compounds, ﬂavonoids and phenolic acids in comparison to the in natura vegetables [48]. This can be explained by the rupture of complexes among the phenolic compounds and other compounds (e.g., proteins) generated by the extraction by steam, resulting in a better availability of these compounds [49]. The polyamines are original from amino acids, such as arginine and ornithine, which act as precursors and can suffer decarboxylation processes by the action of putrefactive bacteria. This explains why a higher concentration of polyamines is found after the fermentation of products as sauerkraut, some sausages, cheeses, and wines [50–52]. In addition, it is known that the processing of vegetables, such as the heating or freezing, can rupture the cell wall, leading to the liberation of these compounds that were free or binding to the membrane, inducing an increase of bioavailability of some compounds [49, 53]. However, for polyamines there are no differences on the content, in organic or conventional green beans, after thermal processing [46]. Besides this, organic green beans presented higher spermidine and spermine contents. These data can be important when the relation of polyamines with diets for cancer patients is studies, as described by [44], or even when it is wanted to obtain food with antioxidants, since these amines are considered free radicals scavengers [54]. Thus, studies with polyamines acting as antioxidants and their relation to diets should be deepened, due to the duality of these substances function.\n\n10\n\n5\n\nH. A. Gomez-Gomez et al.\n\nOrganic Versus Conventional Fruits and Vegetables\n\nSeveral studies highlight the beneﬁts of ingesting of organic foods, due to the higher content of some bioactive compounds and higher antioxidant activity, besides being free of chemical residues [46, 55–57]. The plant exposition to a stressful environment, as attack by insects or fungi, can induce the production of natural defense substances, as well as the phenolic compounds [58, 59]. The organic plant-based food contains higher polyamines levels (that can be protection mechanisms against many types of stress) in comparison to the conventional farming [57]. Studies with fruits indicate an increased polyamine content and a protective effect against damages caused by biotic and abiotic factors in the membranes [60]. However, this proﬁle was not veriﬁed in collard green, where the highest putrescine levels were found in the conventionally cultivated vegetables [57]. Currently, the pharmaceutical industry has searched for organic plants with higher contents of bioactives. It is known that the interaction between different food metabolites (as biogenic amines and polyphenols) and their biosynthetic pathways can contribute to the healthy or harmful characteristics of the own food. In a research developed in our laboratory using two jambu cultivars (Acmella oleracea cv. Jambuarana and Nazaré), a medicinal plant used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and also consumed by the population from North region of Brazil, the polyamines levels was affected by the cultivation practice. Organic jambu (both varieties) showed higher spermine content in leaves and spermine and spermidine in inﬂorescences compared with the conventional fertilization. Besides the polyamines levels, the phenolic compounds content was increased by the organic cultivation [61]. The results show that the organic cultivation can induce positive alterations regarding the antioxidants levels. Biotic or abiotic stress can induce high phenolic compound contents by increasing the activity of the enzymes. Phenolic compounds act as cell protectors against free radicals generated by stress [62, 63]. Some plant-based foods produced under moderate stress, such as organic farming, tend to show higher antioxidant activity due to phytochemical levels, such as phenolics, compared with conventional ones. Organic food may contain more phenolic compounds due to the absence of agrochemicals, which collaborates in the defense against some types of stress [30]. An increased 139% in the total phenolic content of organic tomatoes in relation to conventional farming, which may be a consequence of increased PAL activity, was observed during development [64]. Even after the processing, this quality seems to be maintained. Organic tomato juice presents higher phenolic compounds levels and higher antioxidant activity when compared to those conventionally grown [65].\n\n6\n\nBeneficial Effects of Phenolic Compounds\n\nPhenolic compounds play an important role in sensory characteristics and are responsible for some organoleptic properties such as aroma, color, taste, bitterness, and astringency in fruits and vegetables, as well as their derivatives [66, 67].In addition,\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines\n\n11\n\nthey are directly or indirectly related to quality and health beneﬁts. Flavonoids, anthocyanins, tannins, and resveratrol (stilbene) have proven action against different diseases in humans [68–71]. Quercetin shows beneﬁcial properties and is found in onion, apple, brassicas, among other vegetables. This ﬂavonoid has antidiabetic, anti- inﬂammatory, and anticancer activity [72]. Other ﬂavonoids, such as kaempferol and catechin, act as antioxidants. Studies demonstrated the inhibition of tumor cell growth, reducing the progression of breast cancer in a rat model after treatment with both ﬂavonoids [73, 74]. Some species of the genus Citrus, Brassica, Allium, and Mallus contain kaempferol, a ﬂavonoid with potential to be used in individuals with cardiovascular diseases. In vitro studies showed its action on the decrease of cellular apoptosis induced by LDL cholesterol in human cells and antithrombotic action [75–77]. Beneﬁcial effects are enhanced with resveratrol, a molecule considered effective in preventing different pathological conditions, for example, in the reduction of blood pressure and repression of lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and lipid levels [78, 79]. In vitro studies demonstrate that this stilbene has a beneﬁcial effect as a coadjutant in the control of norovirus, a pathogenic agent involved in food diseases (at great risk in the elderly and in the immunocompromised). In addition, the resveratrol action has been demonstrated in the expression of genes that decrease insulin resistance, meaning possible beneﬁcial effects for diabetics [80, 81]. Anthocyanins are natural pigments found in fruits and vegetables. These compounds provide blue, purple, and red colors and with proven activity as nutraceuticals. Grapes and their derivatives are sources of antioxidant substances and are rapidly absorbed, with various physiological activities in animal cells [82]. Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside is present in a large number of fruits and vegetables, and studies have been demonstrated its protective effect against lipopolysaccharideinduced lung injury by lowering cholesterol levels and suppressing the inﬂammatory response [83]. This anthocyanin has also shown to decrease the negative effects of free fatty acids, decreasing insulin resistance through the activation of cellular and cytoprotective antioxidant genes [84], as well as having preventive or complementary activity against inﬂammatory chronic diseases [85, 86]. It was demonstrated by in vitro study using Morus alba L. that the presence of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside, together with cyanidin 3-rutinoside, has an inhibitory effect on the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. Malvidin-3-O-β-glycoside, the main anthocyanins in grapes, is a potent anti-inﬂammatory; it aids in the balance and inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory pathways, promoting cardiovascular health beneﬁts. When malvidin-3-O-β-glycoside is in combination with peonidine, there is an increased beneﬁcial effects activity. Studies in vitro and in vivo showed decreases of transcription of genes encoding proinﬂammatory cytokines, causing a decrease in anti-inﬂammatory activity in arthritic rats [87, 88]. Pelargonidine, another anthocyanin found in large quantities in grapes and derivatives, has a neuroprotective effect, improving memory deﬁcit by mitigating oxidative stress, helping to reduce the symptoms of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, pelargonidine provides potential beneﬁts against atherosclerosis in albino mice. This compound acts against stress generated by environmental toxicants (urethane and diepoxybutane), compounds classiﬁed as possible human carcinogens [89–91].\n\n12\n\nH. A. Gomez-Gomez et al.\n\nDelphinidin also has a beneﬁcial activity and its anticancer action has been demonstrated. In vitro study has demonstrated inhibition of proliferation and migration of ovarian carcinoma cells. This effect may be an important health response, meaning a potential natural chemotherapeutic to prevent the development and progression of cancer cells [92, 93]. In addition, it has regenerative effect on cells exposed to UVB radiation (100 mJ/cm2), demonstrating great potential in protecting skin damaged by the sun. Several phenolic acids have been studied in reducing symptoms or diseases. It has been demonstrated that p-coumaric acid has the ability of eliminating free radicals and lowering LDL cholesterol [94]. Ferulic acid has been related to the protection of oxidative stress in rat renal tissue caused by cisplatin (anticancer agent). The use of this phenolic acid avoided renal damage and helped to recover the histological parameters of the kidney under normal conditions [95]. Chlorogenic acid found in sweet potatoes and coffee has antibacterial and anti-inﬂammatory activity and can inhibit tumors. Besides that, this phenolic acid has protective effects on the liver and antihypertensive function. In rats with the cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, chlorogenic acid improves pathological lesions in brain tissue, reducing mortality. Studies demonstrated an effect against prostatic hyperplasia in mice, besides reducing the negative effects of high consumption of glucose and lipids, avoiding the occurrence of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer in humans [96–98].\n\n7\n\nInteraction of Phenolic Compounds and Polyamines on Plants\n\nBesides the effect of some polyphenols on the polyamines, the plants can form phenolamides, which are polyamines combined by amide bonding with some phenolic acids such as coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, through the substitution of 1, 2, or 3 amino groups. This combination of the phenolic acids that occurs with the aliphatic polyamines (putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, and spermine) forms the basic amides. When occurs the bonding with the aromatics (tyramine, tryptamine, dopamine, and octopamine) or with aliphatics, forms the neutral amides [99, 100]. The phenolamides has been described as speciﬁc secondary metabolites and related to the development of plants defense mechanism, and the structure of these molecules are similar to the ones found in the insects toxins [101]. The phenolamides content can be affected in response to the pathogens attack, as during the hypersensitive reaction towards fungi or virus diseases. Some plant organs, as the leaves, can synthesize phenolamides as defense mechanism, decreasing the pathogens action [99]. Reference [102] describes an increase of phenolamides and decrease of the powdery mildew infection. Reference [103] suggests that the low incidence of virus diseases in ﬂowers and seed can be related to the phenolamides content. However, in some cases of host-pathogen interactions, especially during the hypersensitive reaction towards fungi or viruses, leaves of\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines\n\n13\n\nvegetative plants synthesize some phenolic amides at the same time as defense mechanisms, limit pathogen expansion. Many foods can produce harmful substances from the oxidation of fatty acids [104] with mutagenic and carcinogenic activities during the processing, the storage, or by contaminants [105]. In order to ﬁght the oxidation, synthetic or natural antioxidants can be used. Some species contain high phenolamides levels that can be used as antioxidants. Reference [106] described phenolamides in Piper and demonstrated a higher antioxidant capacity compared to alfa-tocopherol, and feruperine showed an antioxidant activity almost as high as BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene).\n\n8\n\nInteraction of Phenolic Compounds and Polyamines on Human Health\n\nStudies that related the beneﬁcial effects of the interaction of the phenolic compounds with the polyamines indicate that phenolic compounds, as the chatequins, interact with the biosynthetic pathways of polyamines. This reaction occurs speciﬁcally reducing the production of histamine and putrescine due to the inhibition of the histidine decarboxylase (HDC; EC 4.1.1.22) and ODC activities and increase spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity, which promotes the polyamines catabolism [107, 108]. High activity of ODC is characteristic of the tumor cells [109], and the inhibition of ODC expression may be one of several targets involved in the antiproliferative effects of resveratrol [42]. Resveratrol and piceatannol (Piceat) (derived from resveratrol) also were able to reduce the ODC levels in Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells [110]. This enzyme is directly related to the cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis. Similar results were observed by [42], where resveratrol induced a decrease in the ODC activity in Caco-2 cells and a signiﬁcant decrease of intracellular putrescine content. However, it did not affect the SAMDC activity, not affecting the content of spermidine and spermine. Polyphenols has the ability to targeting polyamines or biogenic amines. Besides the possible synergic activity of both compounds, some classes, as ﬂavonoids, have shown the capacity of blockage key enzymes from biogenic amines biosynthetic pathways [108]. Dopamine and serotonin play critical role in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease. Both biogenic amines are essential for serotonergic and dopaminergic systems to regulate the neurotransmission. Most of the psychotropic drugs used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and psychostimulants, exerted their pharmacological actions by interfering with serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission. Thus, deregulations in their levels (amines) are a key step in the control of neurological diseases. It is interesting to note that epigallocatechin gallate and epigallocatechin showed the ability to interact with and bind to the enzyme Dopa decarboxylase (converts L-Dopa and L-5hydroxytryptophan into dopamine and serotonin, respectively), leading to its irreversible inhibition [111]. Histamine is other biogenic amine that can be regulated by\n\n14\n\nH. A. Gomez-Gomez et al.\n\nepigallocatechin gallate. To produce histamine neurons, mast cells, basophils, and monocytes/macrophages, among others, produce the enzyme HDC that catalyzes the conversion of histidine in histamine. A dual effect of epigallocatechin gallato was observed against histamine. The ﬁrst was demonstrated in rat basophilic leukemia cells that epigallocatechin gallato prevented histamine release from mast cells [112]. The second effect was observed in mammalian cells, where epigallocatechin gallato demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of HDC activity [113]. Interestingly it has also been reported that high concentrations of some phenolic compounds affect biogenic amine production by inhibiting lactic acid bacterial growth [114]. Low levels of biogenic amines in some types of wines can be related to the presence of large phenolic compounds quantities (e.g., anthocianins and stilbenes) that, by inhibiting the activity of naturally present bacteria, can reduce the formation of histamine, tyramine, and putrescine. Usually the polyphenols are not absorbed by small intestine, and it has been estimated that only 10% is absorbed and the remaining 90% is metabolized in the large intestine by gut microbiota or excreted [115]. The polyphenols conversion in the human gut is a complex process and should be considered when assessing the bioavailability of plant compounds. For example, compounds as procyanidins are poorly absorbed in its original molecular structure, but the human gut microbiota might play an important role in the absorption process. This interaction was observed in the conversion of catechin and epicatechin [116]. Bacterial strains Eggerthella lenta and Flavonifractor plautii, isolated from human feces, showed the capacity to convert both compounds in active metabolites. The strain Eg. lenta was able to cleave the heterocyclic C-ring of both (+)-catechin and ()-epicatechin to produce a common precursor, 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol, that was subsequently converted in 5-(30 ,40 -dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone and 4-hydroxy-5-(30 ,40 -dihydroxyphenyl) valeric acid by F. plautii strain (Scheme 1). To produce catechin metabolites, bacterial strains promote cleavage and/or dehydroxylation of C and A rings of catechins molecules and the B ring is preserved. Despite the well-known antioxidant capacity induced by polyphenols, several of these compounds act as redox-dependent poisons against type II enzymes [117]. This poisoning effect is the capacity of enhance DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II and depends on the number of -OH groups on the B and C-rings. Considering that many anticancer drugs target the type II enzyme, this feature can represent an interesting mechanism by which dietary polyphenols or its metabolites act preventing cancer [118]. Two of the most consumed beverages worldwide are coffee and tea, and both beverages are source or phenolic compounds. These beverages have shown several beneﬁcial effects on health, in part due to the high content of phenolic substances. Tea is a rich source of catechins, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate, compounds which can promote diverse effects in humans. Catechins and its metabolites may be involved in the insulin signaling pathway, regulation of various transcription factors, and inhibition of pro-oxidant enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase, lipooxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and xanthine oxidase [119]. Similarly to tea, the coffee consumption may induce different\n\n1\n\nHealth Benefits of Dietary Phenolic Compounds and Biogenic Amines OH\n\nOH OH\n\nOH\n\nA\n\nC O\n\nHO\n\n15\n\nC\n\nA B\n\n(+)-Catechin\n\nO\n\nHO\n\nB OH\n\nOH\n\n(-)-Epicatechin\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nEggerthella lenta\n\nCommon precursor Flavonifractor plautii OH\n\nOH HO\n\nHO\n\nH O\n\nHO O\n\nO OH 5-(3',4'-Dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone\n\n4-Hydroxy-5-(3',4'-Dihydroxyphenyl) valeric acid\n\nScheme 1 Conversion of (+)-catechin and ()-epicatechin by human intestinal bacteria.

[116])\n\nhealth beneﬁts, according to the processing method used to obtain the beverage. Green coffee beans contain large amounts of chlorogenic acids, a family of watersoluble phenols formed by the esteriﬁcation of ()-quinic acid with one or more cinnamic acids. However, with the roasting process of coffee grains, the chlorogenic acid progressively decreases in relation to light to dark roasting degree. In addition to effects in phenolic compounds, the roasting process induces the formation of Maillard reaction products (high molecular weight products). Some of these high molecular weight compounds (such as melanoidins, which also have antioxidant capacity) increase in dark roasting compared to light roasting [120]. It is well known that polyphenols and melanoidins present in foods and beverages are involved in their antioxidant activity [121]. Therefore, the antioxidant capacity of coffee beverages is not only contributed by the components originally present in green grains, but also by the components generated during the roasting process.\n\n16\n\nH. A. Gomez-Gomez et al.\n\nCoffee is probably the richest dietary source of chlorogenic acid, with a single dose of espresso coffee supplying 24–423 mg [122]. Nonespresso beverages are also rich sources, and many regular coffee drinkers can easily consume 1–2 g per day of this phenolic compound, surpassing even the intake coming from fruit and vegetables. In addition to chlorogenic acid, other polyphenols, phenolic acids, and melanoidins have been linked to several health beneﬁts, such as suppression of "
