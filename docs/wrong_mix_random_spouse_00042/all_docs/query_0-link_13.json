Passports. — As far as actual travelling is concerned, Passports are not necessary. The Green Ticket-cases supplied by Thos. Cook & Son, with their Travelling Coupons, are so well known throughout the Continent, that officials of every grade accept them as credentials. Passports should, however, be taken. They must be produced in order to obtaiii registered letters, and they will frequently obtain admittance to museums when closed against the general public. Thos. Cook & Son will procure Passports if desired, or British sub- jects can obtain them from the Foreign Office. The Regulations of the Foreign Office are as follows : — British subjects can be supplied with Passports on application to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Downing Street. One Passport only is necessary for a family. Recommendation on Behalf of Applicants. British subjects may obtain a recommendation signed by any Mayor, Provost, or other Chief Magistrate in the Corporate Towns of the United Kingdom, or by any Magistrate or Justice of the Peace, or by any Minister of Religion of whatever denomination, or by a Physician, Surgeon, Solicitor, Banker, or Notary, resident in the United Kingdom. N.B. — In writing the Forms, all Christian and Surnames must be written in: fyll. The Address of the Bearer of the Passport must be stated, and he and every other gentleman {if several be iticluded in one pass'poYi\\^ ^xA every Man-servant, must be described as **Bn\\.\\s\\v ^>3\\y\\^Q.\\s.,^'' ^evx XNawsKs* being given in fuJi. Female Servants, EngWsVv ot ¥oxev^, ^^^^ wcX^^^ named, but must be classed as ** Women Sstvaivls\" 2 INTRODUCTORY. Foreigners must obtain their Passports from their own Consul. Specimen Letter of Recommendation Form, to be presented at Downing Street with application : — \"The undersigned, yb^« Jones, Clergyman of the Church of England, residing at 8, York Terrace, Carlisle, in the County of Cumberland, hereby certifies that William Brown, whose signature is written at foot, is a British bom Subject and requires a Passport to enable him to travel on the Continent. \"Signed — John Jones, M.A., Vicar of St. Bede's. William Brown, 44, Castle Row, Carlisle. **To H.M. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,\" Persons wishing Thomas Cook & Son to obtain a Passport for them must send a letter in the above form to their Offices, Ludgate Circus, giving at least two clear days' notice before the Passport is required. Time of Visit and Plan of Tour. — Spring and autumn are the best seasons for visiting Northern Italy. May and October are the pleasantest months. No one who can go at any other time should select the months of June, July, or August. The hot summer season is nowhere pleasant, while the winter climate of Lombardy and Piedmont is colder than that of England. Pisa and Venice, being sheltered, are agreeable winter quarters, and the whole of the towns along the Riviera are charming in January, and all through the cold spring months. During early spring and late autumn, the direct railway route, going by Turin, and returning by the South of France, or vice versa, is the best. The length of the tour must depend entirely upon the purse of the traveller, and the time at his disposal. The chief centres of attraction are Florence, Venice, Genoa, and Milan, each of which demands a longer stay than any of the subordinate towns. Through Tourist Tickets from London to any of the chief towns, usually available from 15 to 30 days, may be obtained at any of the Offices of Thomas Cook & Son. These tickets give the right of stopping at all the principal towns en route, and entitle the passenger to 56 pounds weight of luggage, between London and the Italian Frontier. • Circular Tickets, of which there are twelve different varieties, can also be obtained of Thomas Cook & Son. These tickets give the right of stopping at every town on the route, and are available from 35 to 50 days. By their use the traveller can save 45 per cent, upon the Italian Railways e. Luggage. — Golden rules for tourists : Carry as little luggage as pos- eur/ reduce it to the fewest possible packages. \"Nevei Vton^X 'wJCti V-^ci CUSTOM-HOUSES — MONEY. 3 trunks if you can make one do. Buy your trunk of as strong a construc- tion as possible, and with a good lock, for it will be severely tested. Never send luggage to Italy by petite vitesse {Anglice^ goods-train). Never part from it unless absolutely obliged, and see it through the Custom-houses yourself. If you follow these rules, and carefully lock your room in your Hotel whenever you leave it, you have a fair chance of reaching home with all the valuables you possessed at starting. Custom-houses. — The examination at the Douanes on the journey are little more than a formality. Tobacco and spirits are the contraband chiefly sought for by the officials. Travellers would do well not to carry anything subject to duty, and declare when called upon that they have nothing excisable. Money. — Circular Notes are the best currency to take on leaving London. Thomas Cook & Son issue these from their Banking Department, They can be cashed at any of the Continental Banks, and also at all the Hotels where Cook's Coupons are available. The convenience of being able to cash them after bank hours is considerable. A small supply of Italian money should be taken, for porters, fees, etc. This can be obtained from the Banking Department of Thomas Cook & Son, at the Chief Office, Ludgate Circus, or any of their Branch Offices.

The currency of the country is chiefly paper, of value ranging from 50 centesime to 100 lire. Tourists making a long stay in Italy should buy a purse specially constructed to hold the small \"flimsies\" which will be heaped upon them whenever they exchange English or French currency. French gold is the best metal currency to take to Italy. It is con- venient in size, and is the standard which regulates Italian exchange. English and French money are worth considerably more than Italvasv paper A napoleon is usually worth 22 lire, sixvd ^tv lLTi\"^Y^ vs^^w^.^;^ 274 lire. The traveller who pays in gold \"has XYveri^V \\.«^ xeSsisfc ^» ^s^^ paper in change, unless the current rate of excivaLn^e ^s\"a^^c^«^^. vXNa k 4 INTRODUCTORY. proprietors in correspondence with Thomas Cook & Son invariably allow the exchange. Travellers should never take local notes, as they are very hard to get rid of, except in the district where they are issued. The national notes are called \" Biglietti Consorziali,\" and are the only paper current in all parts of Italy. At Railway Stations change is not given for Italian paper. Climate. — When travelling in Northern Italy, it is as well to have plenty of wraps. The Italians themselves seem quite indifferent to cold, but carpets and stoves are indispensable in winter. It is impossible to be too careful in wet weather, or after sunset. Those who visit Northern Italy in summer should avoid exposure to sun, and remain in-doors during the full heat of the day, making use of their mornings and evenings. Bedroom and sitting-room windows should alwa)rs be closed at night, both from con- siderations of health, and to avoid being plagued by mosquitoes. Travellers should be very careful not to over-exert themselves. Fatigue and the heat combined generally cause diarrhoea, to which foreigners are specially liable. Hotels. — All the Hotels in correspondence with Thomas Cook & Son are first-class, and may be patronized with confidence, being clean, well- appointed, and moderate in their charges. Second-class Hotels are rarely clean or comfortable. Visitors should dine at Table d'Hote, or the price of their rooms will be raised. Those who pay their hotel bills in cash should obtain a clear understanding on arrival as to what they are going to be charged, and, as a precaution, would do well to ask for their bill frequently. For a prolonged stay in any town, Hotels Meubl^s, and private apart- ments are most convenient. When one or two rooms are taken, a verbal agreement is generally enough ; but any person wishing to take an apart- ment or suite of rooms should have a contract drawn on stamped paper, and submitted, before signature, to a banker, or other resident, who knows the customs of the town. Cook's Hotel Coupons combine convenience and economy in travel- ling. They are available in nearly six hundred of the finest and best hotels on the Continent, and in no way confine or restrict the movements of the traveller. Each separate coupon calls for a definite object, as bedroom, with lights and attendance, or breakfast, or dinner. The tourist gives up the coupon calling for what he actually orders. For example, he may dine or sleep in Paris, and breakfast at Macon, or sleep and breakfast in one town, and dine in the next, as best suits him. Unused coupons need be no emharrassmentf as their value is refunded at Cook's L.oivdoiv 0?^c^, HOTELS — ROUTES. 5 Friends travelling in company should always, if possible, occupy a double-bedded room. According to the Continental system of building, the small rooms with single beds are on the upper floors ; and being more in demand than double-bedded rooms, persons who are willing to occupy the latter have always an advantage. Travellers holding Cook's Hotel Coupons should inform Hotel proprie- tors of the fact on entering the house. The omission of this formality causes confusion in the cashier's accounts, and Hotel keepers, as a rule, bestow every attention upon those who adopt Cook's Hotel system. The advantages of Cook's Hotel Coupons may be thus summed up : — I. Great saving of time, temper, and expense. II. Great advantage of knowing that you are going to a comfortable Hotel. III. Advantage of knowing beforehand exactly what your Hotel accom- modation will cost you. IV. Advantage of being able to fix address before starting, so that friends can send letters or telegrams to wait your arrival. V. Advantage of being able to insure accommodation in the busiest season. Travellers with Cook's Coupons, who bespeak accommodation by letter or telegram, are always provided for. N.B. The service or attendance included in the Bedroom Coupon is that of the house — porterage and boots are extra. Special attentions on the part of the servants should always be rewarded by a slight gratuity. The Hotel Coupons now in operation on the Continent of Europe con- sist of three distinct series, and are specially arranged for the double object of meeting the requirements of travellers of various nationalities, and in accordance with the system of Hotel management, which varies in difierent parts of the Continent. Series A provides for bedroom, lights, and service, plain breakfast or tea, dinner at Table d'H6te, at the uniform rate of 8s., or lo francs, per day. Series B provides for meat breakfast or Dejeuner b, la Fourchette, dinner at Table d'flote, bedroom, lights, and service, at the rate of 8s, 6d. per day. Series C, or Full-board Series, provides for bedroom, lights, and ser- vice, plain breakfast or tea, meat breakfast or Dejeuner ct la Fourchette^ and dinner at Table d'Hote, at the rate of los. per day. These are the ordinary features of Continental Hotel l\\fe^ ?i5^ €ssfc^^€^sv^J, regarded as extras, and as such payable m ca&Yi. , The coupons are accepted at full value at oive ox xcvot^ oi n^^ ^^^^^^^io>s! Hotels in each of the chief cities, tovms, aad ^\\ace?. ol von^^sX ^^\"^^.o 6 INTRODUCTORY. Switzerland, Italy, on the banks of the Rhine, and at a great many places in France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria, etc. Shopping.— Many Italian shops now profess to sell at fixed prices ; but the salesmen will generally take two-thirds or three-fourths of the sum marked. In all other cases sellers demand prices much higher than they expect to get, and those who pay the first price asked are sure to be taken in. Beggars and Fees. — The beggars in Italy are nearly as numerous and annoying as the fleas. The greater part of them are impostors, and should be dismissed with the words, ** Non c^h niente,'* which mean, ** Nothing for you.\" If anything is given, it should be the smallest possible coin. Fees should also be regulated by a moderate scale. English and Americans, as a rule, are too lavish. They demoralize the people, and make unpleasantness for other travellers by giving lire where half-lire would do, or fifty-centesime notes where they should give sous. The best plan is to consult your Hotel keeper in regard to porterage, fees to carriage- drivers, etc Conveyances. — The usual cab fares are as follows : — For one journey within the town, i lira ; for the first hour, i 1. 50 c, and for each addi- tional half-hour, 75 c. It is usual to give about twenty per cent, extra to the driver. After midnight the fares are double. Small articles of luggage that can be stowed inside the carriage are free ; trunks on the outside, 20 c. each. ' Omnibuses from the difierent Hotels await the arrival of all the through trains. Each omnibus has the name of the Hotel inscribed on it in large gilt letters. On arriving, the traveller should call out the name of the Hotel he intends to stay at, whereupon he will find plenty of persons ready to direct him to the omnibus of the Hotel. Museums and Public Galleries are usually open to the public from I to 3. On Sundays and Thursdays there is no charge for admission ; on other days the charge is i lira. All Museums are closed on New Year's Day, Epiphany, the Monday and Tuesday of the Carnival, Palm Sunday, Easter Sunday, Ascension, Whit Sunday, Corpus Christi {F6te de Dieu\\ Festa de la Statuto, Assumption, and Christmas Day. Theatres. — Operas and ballets constitute the sole programme at the Italian Theatres. The ballets are very superb ; they consist of three acts, and last firom half an hour to three-quarters. The performances commence ^tStop, and generally end after midnight. In summer there are open-air performances, at which smoking is permitted. CHURCHES. 7 Churches should be visited in the morning, both on account of the light, and because they are then open free. The Churches of Italy are magnificent in architecture, and, at the same time, treasures of sacred and legendary art, those which are poorest outside being often richest in internal decoration. It should not, however, be forgotten that while they are open to the inspection of all the world, the chief end for which they were constructed is the worship of God — a fact which tourists, especially Protestants, are apt to lose sight of. It is, unfortunately, too common a thing to see a congregation at its devotions disturbed by the noisy tread of English or American tourists, armed with opera-glasses, guide-books and other acces- sories, and conversing in tones much above a stage \"aside.'* These lapses arise from want of thought. The Editor once saw a Member of the Society of Friends reproved by the verger of a college in Oxford, for keeping his hat on while in the college chapel. When asked to remove his hat, he pleaded his religious belief, but was met with the unanswerable reply, ** We have a prejudice, if you like to call it so, in favour of taking off the hat in church. If you come intp our church, you should respect our prejudice.\" Needless to say, the hat was removed. A word to the wise is enough. English Churches. — In all the large towns the chief Hotels exhibit notices of the English services. It is not necessary, therefore, to refer to them specially. Post and Telegraph Arrangements. — Letters for tourists should be very distinctly addressed, and the name of the town always in Italian. A visiting card will usually suffice as proof of identity when claiming ordinary letters, but for registered letters a passport is indispensable. Postage- stamps are sold at the post-offices, and many of the tobacco shops. Letters for any country in the postal union cost 25 c. This arrangement comprises all the countries in Europe. Registered letters require a fee of 30 c. In all the large towns the post-offices are open from 8 or 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Telegrams from any town in Italy to any other town cost i lira for 15 words — this to include the name and address of the receiver, and name of the sender. Telegrams from Italyx to London, or any part of the United Kingdom, cost 50 c. per word. The forms should be worded as follows : — First the receiver's name and address, next the message, and finally the name of the sender. Example — \"John Smith, Exchange, Hull, England. Impossible to leave Tuim lo-da.'^. 8 INTRODUCTORY. At foot of the form is a separate line, in which should be inserted the address of the sender. Tobacco. — All Italian tobaccos and cigars are a Government monopoly, but in the large towns fair cigars of foreign make are sold in the best shops at 25 to 60 c. each. In every tobacco shop a light is kept burning for public use. Mosquitoes. — These insects are very troublesome, both along the Riviera and in Italy, especially in autumn. Mosquito curtains should be supplied round the bed. They should be shaken before going to bed, and care should be taken that no mosquitoes are within them. Bedroom windows should not be left open while a light is burning within. i Jlppraarh^s U Jlalg*— llailuiag %mit6. FROM PARIS TO TURIN. Via Mont Cenis. THE journey from Paris to Turin may be accomplished in twenty-two hours. The route is Fontainebleau, Tonnerre, Dijon, Macon, Bourg, Amb^rieux, Culoz, Aix-les-Bains. For those who travel direct from Paris to Turin, the best train is that which leaves Paris at about 8pm., arriving at six the following evening. This train passes through the finest scenery — that of the Italian Alps — about mid- day. There is no special feature in that portion of the route which is passed during the night. Those who prefer to break the journey will find convenient resting-places at Macon, Chambery, or Aix-les- Bains. Macon (Hotel, see list in Appendix). — A great wine centre of the Burgundy district, capital of the Department of the Seine-et- Loire. Population, 18,000. The remains of a fine Romanesque Cathedral are interesting. Macon is about 9 hours from Paris. Aix-les-Bains (Hotel, see list in Appendix). — A cele- brated spa, possessing sulphur springs at a temperature of 113 degrees. A large I'hermal Establishment, with baths and pump-room, has been recently built. A pleasant excursion may be made by steamboat to Haute Combe, a Cistercian Abbey on the Lac de Bourget, The trains leaving Paris at 8.30 in the morning will reach Aix-les-Bains the same evening. Chambery (also a convenient stopping-place). — A quiet and pretty town, with nothing very remarkable to attract mere sight-seers, but it has beautiful scenery around it, and there are many pleasant places in the neighbourhood easily accessible. A short boulevard in the town, lined with firie old trees, is one of the chief things in Chambery, and a large tuowvxcaKoX \\.<2k General de Boigne, a native who made a ioT\\w.w^ m Vcv^va..^ -as^^ bequeathed it to the town, is also on lYie Y>o\\x\\eNax^. ^ 10 PARIS TO TURIN. Leaving Chambery, a number of small stations are passed, and very fine views are obtained on either side. Then a series of tunnels have to be gone through, and the train arrives at Modane (Hotel, see Appendix. Station Buffet). — Travel- ling either tvay, hand luggage is examined at Modane, as the French trains go no further. Carriages are changed at Modane, and the fresh one into which the traveller enters is lighted with gas unusually brilliant for railway light, and the carriages are ornamented, as on all Italian railways, with antimacassars of crochet work. The best views are on the right side of the carriage. Passing round the little town of Modane, the remains of Fell's Railway are seen, the ingenious construction which formerly di^ duty over the Mont Cenis. The train soon begins the ascent ; two short tunnels are passed, and then the great tunnel is entered. Mont Cenis Tunnel. — As early as 1857 experiments were undertaken before a Government commission, to see if the idea of a tunnel through the Alps, which had long occupied the minds of engineers in France and Italy, was practicable. A machine was invented, to work by means of air highly com- pressed, which compressed air, after it had performed its duty, should be made available as a source of ventilation. As soon as this machine was tested, and found to work, bridges, roads, and houses were constructed, and in November, i860, five \" compressors *' were at work. But it was not until 1863 that the work went successfully ahead. Up to that time the ma- chinery was found to do little more than manual labour would do 5 but in that year great improvements were made in the machinery, and wonderful progress was effected, so that in 1870 the work was complete. The history of the scheme, the description of the machinery, constructed by Sommeiller, Gran- dis, and Grattoni, the failures and successes, have been so often told, that it will only be necessary here to say that the tunnel is from seven to eight miles long, and the passage occupies about 35 minutes. It is 26 feet wide and 19 high, and is built up with good walls of masonry throughout. It rises from the north (3904 feet above the sea) *' by a gradient of 2 in 91, to its highest point, 4377 feet, or 3480 feet below the range of Alps overhead. It then descends by a slope of i in 2000 to its south opening near Bardonneche, on the Italian side, 4344 feet above the sea.\" ** Mont Cenis\" is not a suitable name for the tunnel, as that Alpine height is at ieast 16 miles away from any point of it. PARIS TO TURIN. II The actual mountains under which the tunnel passes are the Col de Fr^jus, the Grand Vallon (the highest), and the Col de la Rue. One of the most wonderful things in connection with the tunnel is that there is no vertical shaft ; it could therefore only be Worked from the two mouths towards the centre, and it could not have been worked at all if machinery had not been invented which should bore the tunnel and supply air at the same time. There is nothing disagreeable in the passage. The air is not as close or unpleasant as in the Underground Railway in London. The carriages are all well lighted, and the tunnel itself is lighted at convenient distances throughout. Emerging from the tunnel, the scene at whatever time of the year is very striking. When the snow is upon the ground, and the sun is shining^ the blaze of light is dazzling, insomuch as to be positively painful. The scene around is wild, lonely, almost savage. In the summer the prospect is singularly beautiful } and at all times the sensation of travelling by rail at that great height is pleasant from its novelty. Every mile of the journey from Bardonneche, until the train reaches the level land in the valley of the Po, is full of interest, • and many of the views obtained are of exquisite beauty. Fol- lowing the course of the torrent of Bardonneche, the beautiful valley of the Dora Riparia is reached ; and although there are twenty-five tunnels to be passed, the views obtained at intervals are exquisite. The wild and romantic gorge, the peaks and passes of surrounding mountains, curious little villages nestling beside great rocks, and all around vegetation of rich growth and fruitfulness. Then after passing Chaumont Station, the traveller looks down upon the town of Susa, backed by its great mountain Roche-Melone, on the summit of which is a chapel which appears to be really, as it is almost, inaccessible. It was founded by a Crusader, Bonifazio. Some have maintained that Hannibal led his army to the summit of the Roche-Melone, after travelling through the Mont Cenis pass, in order to strengthen the courage of his men with the widely extending prospect of Italy. From the railway the great curiosity of Susa, the Arch of Augustus, is seen. It was built by Julius Cottius, b.c. 8, in honour of the Emperor. The inscription is scarcely decipherable.

Ambrogio is approached, the traveller will see on the right a mountain, at the top of which is the Sagra (di San Michele della Chiesa). It was foanded in the ti'nth century, tongues of fire from heaven descending (as the Greek fire does in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem) to light the candles at its consecration. Some hundreds of monks dwelt here, and the services of the church ceased not day or night. Many curiosities are to be seen here, and many legends of miracles are told. One hideous sight was, until a short time since, to be seen : a double row of corphes were placed on the steps leading to the churchy the bodies having been, by some means peculiar to the locality, preserved. All who entered the church had to pass this double row of defunct persons, and on special occasions the sight was rendered doubly ghastly from the fact that fanciful vestments were placed upon them, and their heads were wreathed with flowers. The bodies are still exposed to sight, but not in the obtrusive manner of former years. I'he character of the scenery now changes entirely. Moun- tains and ravines are left behind, and the train speeds on its way through the plain of Piedmont. Four stations — Avigliana, Rosta, Alpignano, Collegno — are passed, and the traveller arrives at Turin. FROM PARIS TO GENOA. Via Lyons, Marseilles, and the Corniclie Route. The journey from Paris to Marseilles may be accomplished by express train in i6i hours. The route is Fontaineblean, Tonnerre, Dijon, Macon, and Lyons. The latter place is reached in 9} hours. The best direct train from Paris to Marseilles leaves the Garc do Lyon, Paris, at 8.30 a.m., and arrives before midnight. Lyons (for Hotel, see Appendix). -^Population, 324,000. Principal sights : the Palais des Beaux Arts, with a good picture gallery and archnological museum ; the Cathedral of St. John Baptist ) the Hotel de Vdle, and the Pare de la Tete d'Or. Lyons is remarkable for the beauty of its situation, and the fine lews that are to be obtained, notably from the Height of wrmWs and the Observatory, The city \\s si^lewivdVY built. PARIS TO GENOA. 1 3 and some of its streets and squares may be favourably compared with any in £urope, especially the Place Louis le Grand, in which is the statue of Louis XIV. There is plenty to occupy the tourist for a day in Lyons> if he wishes to break the journey here. Resuming the railway, the principal places passed are Vienne, Valence, Orange, Avignon, and Aries. Marseilles (Hotel, see Appendix). — Population, 30,000. An exploration of this great Oriental port and harbour, the principal seaport of France, cannot fail to prove of interest, although there are many much less important towns which con- tain far greater interest for the ordinary traveller. Although the city has many foreign and almost Oriental aspects, and although its history can be traced from the time when, 600 B.C., certain Greeks founded a colony, and named the place Massilia, up to the time when the name of Gambetta became associated with it, the traveller who visits it will be reminded more of Liverpool than of any other place. From the Fort St. Jean, at the entrance of the harbour, a good view will be obtained of the Mediterranean, but this will be seen to greater advantage further on. The Cathedral is new and uninteresting. The Bourse is handsome. The Musee de Longchamp contains a few good pictures. The Zoological Gardens are no better or no worse than zoological gardens generally are. Admirers of Dumas' exciting story of Monte Christo may make a pilgrimage to the Chateau d'lf, where Mirabeau also was imprisoned 3 but those who do not care for the journey can get a view of the castle from the Church of Notre Dame de la Garde. I^eaving Marseilles, the railway passes through charming scenery, continually increasing in beauty ; rocky passes, olive plantations, pretty villages, and glimpses of the sea. In two hours or less the train arrives at Toulon (Hotel, see Appendix). — Toulon is the great naval port and arsenal of France, and visitors will find little here except memorials of war to interest them. The village of Hy^res (Hotel, see Appendix), is a charming .little place, and is resorted to by invalids as a winter residence, the air being very beneficial to those suffering from pulmonary complaints. Twice a week steamboats leave Toulon for Corsica, which is reached in 22 to 24 hours. English doctors, English church service, and \" English spoken,*' will all be found here. Cannes (Hotel, see Appendix). — ^o^\\3\\^xXoYk^ ^o^^^o. Cannes is very delightfully situated, and \\s l2i\\xvo>3iS ^ >^^ ^ofw 14 PARIS TO GENOA. over as a winter resort for consumptive and other delicate per- sons. The surroundings are even prettier than the town itself, and both in Cannes and in the villages, apartments may be found for wintering. Nice (Hotel, see Appendix). — The capital of the French Department of the Alpes Maritimes, was founded in the fifth century, B.C., and named Nicaea, which name is still preserved in the Italian name Nizza. It was the birthplace of the great French general Massena, and also of Garibaldi. The town generally resembles a very gay and charming French Bains-de-mer, or watering place, with a very extensive English quarter. Invalids of all European countries, especially England, Russia, and Grermany, flock here in thousands during the winter, for the climate, which is delightful. In the hot summer months the town is quite deserted. There are no antiquities, churches, or art galleries of importance ; life in Nice is one round of gaiety. Public promenades, bands, sea-bathing, balls, regattas, etc., furnish constant employment for the young and gay, while the old and invalids drink in enjoyment from the ever-changing beauties of the sea and sky, flanked by the fertile slopes of the Maritime Alps. The town stands on the Bate des Anges, On the right bank of the Bay is the foreign quarter, with the beautiful promenade des Anglais facing the sea. In the centre the new town, with its fine hotels, broad streets, and excellent shops ; on the left the old town, with its narrow dirty streets. Those who have time to spare would do well to devote two or three days to Nice and to its environs, which are as charming as the town itself. Monaco (population, i,joo) is a pretty little place, a per- fect gem of a capital^ as befits a city which was formerly the centre of the smallest monarchy in the world. It is little better than a huge village, but its crowds of visitors, its fortifications, its really imposing buildings, and, above all, its picturesque sur- roundings, impart to it a certain amount of impressiveness, not to be found in many places of greater pretensions. From the heights which command the city, the view afforded of the Medi- terranean is singularly beautiful, and goes far to explain the popularity of Monaco. The Prince of Monaco still exercises sovereign rights, although the Customs and Post-office are under French govem- ent. The chief attraction to visitors is the Casino, which is nostj if not the only, public establishment In Europe where Laii Im PARIS TO GENOA. 15 gaming is permitted. It stands in beautiful grounds, command- ing a fine view. Musical performances are given twice a day, and classical concerts on Thursdays. Very few visitors arrive at Monaco without trying their fortunes at the gaming table, and few quit it without leaving behind them a souvenir of more or less value. From Monaco to Mentone the tour is delightful. There are picturesque glens, lofty crags, gloomy ravines, peaceful valleys, extensive pine forests, noisy torrents, and all the grandly fasci- nating charms which the landscape-painter vainly strives to re- produce on canvas. Here is Roquebruna, concerning which there is a curious tradition to the effect that the land on which the village is situated slipped^ buildings and all, from the hill above. It certainly has a curious appearance — the tall white houses looking as if they were propped up by immense cliffs and buttresses of stone. The railway tunnelling here is of a very heavy character ; and where there are cuttings, they are so vast that even tunnelling would seem to be cheaper. Mentone (Hotel, see Appendix). — Population, 5j^oo« Mentone, like Nice, is a great resort of English invalids, who come hither to enjoy the warm atmosphere of the \" Sunny South,\" that they may gain strength to fight the insidious foe which continually threatens their existence. Its great charm is the scenery which surrounds it. Sheltered by the lofty wooded mountains at the back, it coquettishly peeps forth towards the blue waters of the Mediterranean. The atmosphere here is singularly clear, and sometimes the refraction is so great that the island of Corsica, which is more than a hundred miles dis- tant, seems but a few leagues off. When twilight approaches, this vision vanishes, not suddenly as it came, but slowly melting away into the shadows. The last two hours of daylight are, as a rule, the pleasantest time on the promenade, which, although never brilliant, generally presents an animated and agreeable picture, as characteristic of life at Mentone as the Promenade des Anglais is of Nice. Pedlars spread their laces on the low boundary wall ; Greeks and Algerians in gorgeous costume dis- play all manner of scarlet cloths and glittering gewgaws 5 but only for this peculiar mode of merchandise, one would be half tempted to imagine himself back in England, for the voices he hears are mostly English, the costumes he sees have the true insular cut and style.

Between Mentone and Ventimiglia is passed the huge ravine which separates France from Italy. This ravine forms one of the sights of Mentone. Its sides are formed by fearful preci- pices, torn and splintered by tremendous convulsions. The crags, which tower far above the head of the spectator, are really in danger of toppling over, for the little streams of water which trickle down their bleak sides are slowly undermining their stabijity. Long grasses, curious ferns, and creeping plants, grow on the stone ledges, and trail over the numerous fissures. A path, about two feet wide, sometimes only twelve inches, winds round the abyss at a tremendous elevation 5 and it is quite common to see the peasants walking rapidly along this perilous route with large bundles on their heads or backs. A torrent leaps into the gorge at its narrowest recess, and tum- bles in a succession of cascades from height to height, until it reaches its stony bed below. At the narrowest part of the chasm it is crossed by the slender bridge which for many years formed the only means of communication at this point between the two countries. One side of the bridge is guarded by French, and the other by Italian soldiers. Ventimiglia is the Italian frontier town, in ancient times a place of considerable military importance 3 previous to the first French revolution it formed the frontier town of Piedmont on the Genoa side, and its walls have witnessed many a mur- derous conflict between the troops of the Counts of Provence and those of the Dukes of Savoy. Luggage is examined at the Douane. Bordigliera is a picturesque place, resorted to, as so many towns are hereabout, by invalids. It is celebrated principally for the cultivation of the palm j and it is from this town that the forests of branches which on Palm Sunday impart such a pecu- liar aspect to the interior of St. Peter's and the other churches are supplied. The trees are very carefully tended, but notwithstanding the heat of the climate and the advantages of the situation, they never attain any remarkable size ; nevertheless they give quite an Oriental character to the scenery, and the adjacent houses are quite of an Eastern type. Some substantial-looking edifices, surrounded by large gardens, have fine old doorways and high walls, ornamented with singular carvings and grotesque figures 0/ animals. Bat to an English eye, pet\\iaps lYvc clD\\^i ?l\\Xx^si- PARIS TO GENOA, 1 7 tion of the place is not the palms, but the little tracts of ver- dant grass land near the coast. A meadow is a rare sight in the western Riviera, and even at Mentone people cannot obtain a plot of grass sufficiently large and level for the purposes of croquet, and the lovers of the game are consequently obliged to content themselves with a sandy yard on the beach. San Remo (Hotel, see Appendix), population ii,ooo. — This is one of the most ancient of towns, and yet the most modern of health resorts, the cheapness of hotel living being not its least advantage. In some respects it is almost equal to Mentone ; the air is bracing, the hotels are not too near the sea, and it possesses a cheerful and pleasant aspect. It is a favourite resort of English invalids, who generally speak in favourable terms of the character of the inhabitants. Compared with Grenoa and other Italian cities, San Remo possesses few architectural attrac- tions, but its streets and buildings have a character of their own, especially in the older portions of the town. A recent writer says : — \" The streets lead for the most part under vaulted passages 3 the houses rest upon old arches, and there is a strange air of gloom and twilight quiet about the whole place. How human beings can inhabit such extraordinary burrows is a marvel to any one who for the first time threads this vast labyrinth ; there are shops and cafes which daylight never enters. The lower storeys of the buildings might as well be underground 3 yet though the air is chill and damp like that of a cellar, the clean- liness of old San Remo is noticeable, and the town contrasts strongly with the mud and evil odours of its neighbours. Dark as its passages are, they are by no means dismal. Strange arches and buttresses, between the lofty old houses, and intended for the purposes of strengthening the buildings, are overgrown with mosses and ferns. Here and there one sees a very fine old gateway or a magnificent staircase, which would escape eyes that had not become habituated to the gloom of the place. Near the modern portion of San Remo are some fine old structures with marble stairs, red marble pillars, and wonder- fully carved ornaments in stone. The dwellers in these odd habitations seem to have been in great fear of mediaeval robbers and brigands. Their lower windows were guarded by strong iron bars, their doors were of strong metal, and they had loop- holes for the purpose of reconnoitring their possible 2>s&\"^\\«aXs», The enemies of such a community as tlae cxVax^xv^ oi ^^xx '^evxNO must have had peculiar difficulties to encoxxtiXet \\}cvce«. ^'t^^^^ 1 8 SAN REMO TO GENOA. centuries ago. All the entrances to the streets were barred, and a few resolute men could have defended each narrow alley against a thousand.\" The journey from San Remo to Genoa is the least interesting part of the railway route, in some respects, inasmuch as it is vexatious. Just as the fine peeps of glen and mountain, sea or village^ are at hand, the train has a habit of dashing into a tunnel. Leaving San Remo, many exquisite villages and towns are passed : among them Oneglia, the birthplace of Andrea Doria ; Alassio, a pleasant seaport ; Albenga, a very old town, with many interesting architectural renjains, but not a healthy place ; and Loano, where the French Republicans gained their first victory in Italy, 179J. Between this station and Savona, the scenery, which is exceedingly fine, is to a great extent lost in the railway journey. Savona is a large and prosperous town, with 25,000 inhabitants, and contains much that is worth seeing — notably the Cathedral and Dominican Church, both with good paintings. Savona was the birthplace of Sixtus IV. and Julius II., and Chiabrera, a celebrated Italian poet. There is a railway from Savona to Turin. (See p. 59.) Cogoleto is interesting as being the traditional birthplace of Christopher Columbus. The tradition, however, is somewhat doubtful, notwithstanding an inscription over a house, which runs as follows : — ** Hospes, siste gradum. Fuit hie lux prima Columbo : Orbe viro majori heu nimis arcta domus? Unus erat mundus. * Duo sunt/ ait ille. Fuere. \" Stations Pra and Pegli are then passed, and after another run through tunnels^ Genoa is reached. Genoa. (See p. 61). Although the route from Nice to Genoa is much cheaper by train than by road, those who can spare the time and the money to travel by carriage over the old Corniche road will be well repaid. The route presents one unbroken succession of natural beauties, traversing bold and lofty points of the mountains, wooded and fertile slopes, and near the coast highly cultivated fields. In some places the passes skirt precipitous cliffs, washed by the deep ultramarine of the Mediterranean, and crowned with ancient ruins. In others it traverses large olive plantations, ^ . while figs, vines, oranges, lemons, oleanders, and myrtles, lend beauty and perfume to the landscape. Altogether, it is difficult INNSBRUCK TO VERONA. 1 9 to imagine anything more beautiful or more varied than the scenery of the Riviera'. The carriage journey will take full two days, and cost pro- bably three times as much as the railway. Those who can neither afford time nor money for this route will do well to break the railway journey at the principal stations. Between Nice and Genoa there are four or five trains a day, and as the time taken in the whole journey is only from six to eight hours, much may be done in a day when time is very limited j or it will well repay the traveller to linger some days en route. FROM INNSBRUCK TO VERONA. Via the Brenner Route. The journey from Innsbruck to Verona may be accomplished in ten to twelve hours ; and at Verona the train can be taken to Padua and Venice (see p. no), or to Brescia, Bergamo, and Milan (see p. 95), or by the new line of railway to Mantua and Modena (see p. 100), and from thence to Florence. Innsbruck (for Hotel, see Appendix). — Population, 16,000. A very pleasant town, the capital of the Tyrol. The situation is delightful, and in the environs most picturesque scenery abounds. The principal sights are the Franciscan Church, containing the celebrated monument of Maximilian I., with 28 colossal bronze statues around it 3 and the tomb of Hofer. The Museum contains fine specimens of the natural history of the Tyrol. Soon after leaving Innsbruck the ascent commences. The rail keeps company with the road nearly all the way. In the early part of the journey there is not much to be seen, as tunnel after tunnel is entered. The glimpses afforded, however, show that the valley narrows, grows more wildly romantic, and from the station Matrei to the station Brenner the scenery is mag- nificent. The Brenner Pass is the oldest and lowest of the Alpine routes ; it is 4650 feet above the sea, and the mountains are 2000 feet above that, forming the watershed between the Black Sea and the Adriatic. Near the Brenner station (the summit of the pass) is the old post-house. Unfortunately, railways cannot always be so constructed, nor the sta^\\w\\!s»\\i^^^ placed, as to give the traveller the best po\\t\\\\s ol w.^ eu Toule* At the summit of this pass there is teaW^ VvX.^e \\.o \\>^ ^t^^- 20 INNSBRUCK TO VERONA. Descending, however, towards Botzen, a variety of excellent views are obtained 3 and as we glide along mere ledges of rock, as it seems, with precipices deep down below and heights above, and pines, larches, and other trees standing mysteriously on jutting rocks and crags, the traveller is amply repaid for selecting this route, which, next to the Mont Cenis, is the most popular as well as the most convenient into Italy. Amid the distractions of so many varied forms of scenery, attention must be paid to the marvellous engineering skill exercised in the construction of the railway. For a distance of 21 miles it rises at a gradient of i in 40, until it reaches the Brenner station, and then descends by a series of zigzags less steep, but not less wonderful in their construction. Between Innsbruck and Botzen twenty-three tunnels are passed. After leaving the Brenner, the principal stations are, Ster- %ing, ^loy feet above the sea level 5 Franzenfeste, 2460 feet, where is the Franzenfeste fortress, which commands the Bren- ner Route; Buxen, 1833 feet, formerly an episcopal see, which was dissolved in 1803 — the episcopal palace still remains; Klausen, 1670 feet, formerly a Rbaecian fortress, and, later, a Roman fort, called Sabiona, still later an episcopal palace, and finally a baronial castle. Below Klausen the valley narrows into a picturesque rocky gorge, contrasting with the fair pastures around it. Botzen (for Hotel, see Appendix). — There are few towns in the Tyrol more charming than this delightful old town of Botzen ; and none more important from a commercial point of view. It is celebrated amongst other things for its fairs, which are held four times a year. Latterly much attention has been called to the Dolomite Mountains, and Botzen is the station from which they are most accessible. These moun- tains, named after a French geologist, Dolomieu, are among the wonders of the world. They are of yellow and slaty limestone, utterly treeless, and by atmospheric and other influences have been fashioned into *' playing fantastic tricks before high heaven.\" Ruined castles, mouldering towers, weird, witch-like ravines and gorges, — everything, in short, that imagination can suggest, may be seen in this wondrous region. Nothing re- markable is to be seen between Botzen and Trient. Trient (German; Tridentum, Latin; Trento, Italian). — There is much in this old town to interest the antiquarian. It is of £truscan origin, and possesses several ruins of castles, etc , of very ancient date. The Cathedral is a handsome building. VIENNA TO TRIESTE. 21 eleventh to fifteenth century. S. Maria Maggiore is celebrated as being the place where the famous Council of Trent was held, 1545-63. The church contains a picture of the scene, with nearly 300 portraits. Several beautiful deviations from the railway route may be made from Trent, among them may be enumerated the follow- ing:— Trent to Riva (Lake Garda). — An omnibus leaves daily in the summer, starting at about 9 a.m. Fare, two shillings. Carriages may also be obtained from the Hotels. The carriage route is much more beautiful than the journey by rail. Those who prefer to walk can do so in seven hours. Trent to Bassano. — Ten hours by diligence at a fare of 6 francs, along the direct Venice Road, through the narrow valley of the Fersina. A line of railway connects Bassano with Padua. Leaving Trient, the journey is continued through the valley of the Adige; then Roveredo, pleasantly situated on the Leno, is reached ; the town is the centre of the silk trade, and is thoroughly Italian in all its characteristics. Ala is the station of the Austrian and Italian Custom-house, where a cursory ex- amination of luggage is made. The town is celebrated for the manufacture of velvet. At Peri the traveller is in Italy. The line traverses the rocky Chiusa di Verona, where a battle was fought in the time of Frederick Barbarossa by Germans against the Milanese ; and then, passing a few unimportant stations^ the train arrives at Verona. Verona (see p. 103). Verona to Venice (see p. no). Verona to Milan (see p. 95). FROM VIENNA TO TRIESTE. Via the Semmering Railway. Vienna (for Hotel, see Appendix). — This route to Italy scarcely comes within the scope of the present volume ; it is, however, an exceedingly interesting journey, although it does not present so many attractions in scenery as others. The time occupied by ordinary trains is from 22 to 24 hours. Ex- press, 15. Between Vienna and Baden there aie Tcvaxc^ XsasA.- some villas, parks, and ruined castles.

At Gloggnitz the Semmering railway commences j and as the ascent is made, the views, especially those from the left window of the carriage, are exceedingly fine. Then the valley of Reichnau is crossed by a handsome viaduct. A series of tunnels are passed through, and Semmering, the highest part of the line, is reached. De- scending into Styria, valleys and glens are passed in rapid succes- sion, until the train arrives at GratZ, the capital of Styria — very picturesque in itself and in its surroundings. The country becomes more fertile between Gratz and Marburg. At Cilli the hills are beautifully wooded. One of the most curious por- tions of the journey is after leaving Steinbruck, when the train enters a valley shut in by lofty hills of limestone, and so narrow as to give the impression that every minute the train will be running into a tunnel. Laibacb. is the capital of Carinthia, and is the last station of importance before reaching Adelsberg, famous for its stalactite caverns. Adelsberg itself is a poor little place with about 1,500 inhabitants ; the *' grotto \" is nearly a mile from the station, and at least three to four hours should be devoted to the visit. The traveller must bear in mind that going singly to the grotto is rather an expensive affair, and that the expenses are reduced in proportion to the number forming a party, — for two persons the charge is £1 2S. jd. In addition to the saving of expense, it should be borne in mind that every traveller with an additional candle adds an additional interest to the scene, which is not to be seen with- out strong illumination. Those who make this journey, and have proposed beforehand to stop at Adelsberg, will do well to provide themselves with a magnesium torch or a good coil of magnesium wire ; many express great disappointment in con- sequence of this lack. The caverns were known at a very early period, but fresh discoveries were made in 18 19, when a labourer accidentally broke through a screen of stalactite and found that the caverns travellers had hitherto lauded so much were but as the vestibule into the great Temple of Nature. There is no question that these caverns are well worth seeing ; the stalactites are wonderful j and so are the curious freaks in the formation of the stalagmites— such as the Two Hearts, the Sword of Damocles, the Pulpit, etc. ; but the most impressive thing is to hear the dashing of water, and to look down into the subterranean river. It is in this river that the blind lizard-fish {Proteus Anguinus) is found, specimens of f^A/cA may generally be purchased in the inn at Adelsberg. VIENNA TO TRIESTE. 2$ There is a strange fascination in this grotto. The traveller feels he is standing in a '* house not made with hands,\" almost eter- nal in its duration ^ and there is a feeling which creeps over one in a place like this as if great secrets lay round about you on every hand^ and the heart calls out for some great prophet of Science to explain these ** mysteries lain hid from the founda- tion of the world.\" Many minds, however, many thoughts : and here is the reflection of a modern writer : — \" No sound was to be heard but the steady drip, drip, from the lofty roof, above which rose the mighty mass of the super- incumbent mountain. I felt my mind deeply impressed with the vastness of those periods of time during which that sound had continued, unheard by human ear, and while these vast vaults had been untrodden by human footsteps ; yet during all these cycles Nature had been slowly hanging her stalactites above and dropping her stalagmites to the ground. \"Before the antiquity of the cavern, that of Thebes and Carnac, of the pyramids of Egypt and the ruins of Jerusalem, lost its hoariness, and seemed to be but a thing of yesterday. I felt humbled as I thought of the brief span of human existence on the earth ; but the contemplation of man*s moral nature and immortality correspondingly elated my mind. How much greater was intelligent and rational man than these pillars of chalk J and throughout what uncounted ages would his death- less spirit endure, long after some convulsive crash must have broken in upon their slumbers and shivered them into thousands of insignificant fragments ! \" Adelsberg is twenty-three miles from Trieste 3 the first part of this short distance is desolate and dreary to the last degree, and it is a relief to have the view shut out by the tunnels. Com- pensation is more than made, however, by the glorious view which opens before the traveller as he reaches Nabresina. • There stretches before him a panorama of the Adriatic, the city of Trieste, and the beautiful coast of Istria. It is, perhaps, one of the most startling scenes that can be found anywhere. Near the station of Grignano, on the point of land which stretches into the sea, is the beautiful Castle of Miramar, where once dwelt the unfortunate Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, whose death in 1867 is yet fresh in memory.

In the summer there are two diligences daily, the journey occu- pying about 16 to 1/ hours. Coire is an episcopal residence, with mediaeval palace, and within the Court the Cathedral of St. Lucius, the oldest part of which is attributed to the 8th century. For six miles the road is level, and there is little to see. Passing through the little village of Ems, and crossing the Rhine by a covered bridge, Reichenau is reached. In its chateau Louis Philippe, then Due de Chartres, seeking refuge from the fury of the French Revolution, resided from October 1793 to July 1794, under the assumed name of Chabot. The road increases in interest as the journey progresses. Small towns and villages are passed, and on the summits of rocky and barren crags in this romantic region houses and churches are seen perched like doves on the roofs of high buildings ; dark brown goats are also browsing on the cliffs 3 vegetation is rich, and the sides of the road are starred with flowers. Thusis (for Hotel, see Appendix) is at the confluence of the Nolla with the Rhine — a pretty village, in the midst of fine scenery. Crossing the Nolla, a very remarkable view is ob- tained. The valley of the Rhine is encircled by a guardian chain of lofty mountains, on a lower one of which stands the ruins of a castle, said to be the most ancient in Switzerland, dating near]y two thousand years ago ! Then the COIRE TO COLICO. 2$ Via Mala is entered. It is a remarkable fissure, three to four miles long, a few feet wide, 1500 feet high, formed by a natural convulsion — as is obvious from the sides sharply cor- responding — made available by human art for every requirement of traffic or travel. The carriage road, peifectly protected by a parapet, is hewn out of the rock, from 200 to 500 feet above the thin Rhine, whose waters can be heard moaning below. At the Verlorene Loch, or Lost Gulf at Y'lk Mala, it is as though the grandeur of nature had been concentrated on this wild spot. It looks as if a great convulsion had thrown up these perpendicular mountains fifteen hundred feet high, then rent them asunder, just wide enough to make a passable road, and had sent a narrow, bottomless stream through the great gorge, down so deep, that the eye can scarcely follow it in its sluggish course. The river is crossed three times, and at the second bridge the view either way is grand in the extreme. Leaving the Vi^i. Mala, the valley of Schams is entered, the green meadows and neat cottages of which form a grateful relief after the gloomy terrors of the awful chasms from which the traveller has just emerged. Passing Zillis and Andeer, wiih their ruined castles and legendary associations, a kind of minor Vi^ Mala is entered, known as the Roffna Ravine, a wild gorge three miles long, through which the bright waters of the Rhine precipitate themselves in a remarkable series of cascades and falls. Leaving the gorge behind, the spacious snow-fields of the Einshorn reveal themselves 5 while further on the noble Alpine landscape of the Rheinwaldthal bursts into view. The little village of Splugen (for Hotel, see Appendix) is 4800 feet above the level of the sea. Here tra- velleis stop for refreshments. Off again, over the Rhine, through the long gallery or tunnel, and up, by means of numerous zigzags, to the summit of the Splugen Pass. Crossing the frontier, the descent into Italy is commenced. '* I have crossed by Mont Cenis Pass, the St. Gotthard, and the Simplon,\" says a recent traveller, '* and though each has its own peculiar attractions, yet the Splugen Pass is truly the most magnificent road over the Alps. No one can go over this road, and enter into the spirit of it, without feeling that the mind has been enlarged by communion with Nature in her noble grandeur.\" This opinion is held by many who have beeoT£\\ft -a^cc^wvXsA. with the characteristics of the different routes.

Then through the Llro Valley, the rugged aspect of which is somewhat softened by the rich luxuriance of the vast chestnut forests below. Rapidly the features of the landscape begin to change their aspect. The regions of firs and pines, of overhanging precipices and roman- tic waterfalls, of frowning rocks and yawning chasms, are left for a land of beautiful vineyards, stately olive-groves, and golden cornfields. Ghiavenna (for Hotel, see Appendix) is a capital resting-place. Very charming is the locale of the town. It is situate on the Maira, at the entrance to the Val Bregaglia. From Chiavenna the character of the scenery again changes, and all around there are mountains hemming in the valleys, and wild ravines, forming singular contrasts to the quieter scenes. The falls of the Maira near here form a perfect picture. Cross- ing swift rushing rivers, and leaving the realms of eternal snow behind, cornfields, vineyards, and mulberry-groves are passed. Riva is the last village on the road. The Lake of Riva is skirted, and the diligence stops at Colico, where the steamboat is waiting to convey the tourist across the silvery waters of the beautiful lake, whose distant sails \" For floating birds we take, Bathing in azure wave their plumes of snow — Wherein shore, tower, and town their mirror make.\" From Golico to Como, see p. 39. II. FROM MARTIGNY OVER THE SIMPLON TO ARONA. Martigny (for Hotel, see Appendix). From Martigny to Sion and Sierre by rail. The first part of this route exhibits numerous traces of the frightful inunda- tions frequent here. In Martigny are shown water-marks which prove that sometimes the whole valley is flooded up to the first- floor windows, and all up the valley there are similar indications of torrent desolation. These devastations are principally during the spring, when the snow has begun to melt. The traveller is now in a region of ancient castles. Every eminence seems to 'have had, at one time or another, its own particular fortress. At Si'oa there are two such edifices in ruinS) another castle MARTIGNY TO ARONA. 27 becoming observable as the town is more closely approached. Here the shale mountains are beautifully terraced, like those of the Rhine. A mulberry plantation here, a ruined castle there, and then Sierre (for Hotel, see Appendix), where the railway journey terminates. The diligence leaves here daily, and takes about twenty-two hours to accomplish the journey to Arona. Over the Rhone, past hills formerly the resort of brigands, past Alpine villages, glistening church-towers, waterfalls, castles, rocks, valleys, snow mountains, alternations of sterility and fertility, past Leuk, Susten, Tourtemagne, Viege, or Vispach (whence numerous tours may be made to the glacier region of Zermatt), and we are in Brigue (Brieg — for Hotel, see Appen- dix), where the work of ascent really commences. Here we bid farewell to the romantic valley of the Rhone, and enter upon the land which Mr. Laing quaintly epitomises as one of \" ava- lanches, snows, glaciers, winding roads, with cataracts and precipices below, and clouds and blue sky above, and all the other romantic furniture of Alpine scenery.\" The road now pursued was constructed by Napoleon, after the famous battle of Marengo. The scenery becomes wilder and grander at every turn. Bridge: after bridge is crossed, gallery after gallery gone through, houses of refuge passed by, and then comes the stu- pendous panorama of the Alps, the real grandeur of which is beyond the power of words to paint, and which forms a sight well worth the whole cost of the journey from England. ** In the distance is an eagle soaring majestically through the air j below is heard the distant Alpine horn, or the shepherd's melodious pipe, its notes commingling with the tinkling of numerous sheep-bells. Higher and higher we rise, from the very roots of the mountains, the picture varying in beauty at every turn — now the dizzy precipices below, now the craggy heights above,\" until the summit of the pass, 6600 feet • above sea level, is reached. Further on is the Hospice, capable of giving refuge to 300 persons, managed by pious Augustine monks. The little village of Simplon is situated about 1400 feet below the summit. Through a black and craggy rending asunder of the granite Alps, the descent into Italy is commenced ; a foaming torrent cutting summersaults below at every step, and straight up, above the gloomy preci- pices, the lowering clouds of heaven. Marvellous are the winding tunnels which commence after passing \\3afc ^-axxvoxi.^ Gorge of GrOndo, said to be the wildest aad ^xaxi^^s\\»*vcL^^ AljRS. These gigantic tunnels are hewn out ol a scX\\^ xaas»^ ^^ 28 MARTIGNY TO TURIN. rock, which seemed to impede the further progress of the road, and which took eighteen months to excavate — loo men, in gangs of eight, working in turns day and night. On emerging from the tunnels, a scene of stupendous majesty meets the eye. Hissing and roaring, the boiling waters of the Fressinone dash over the rocks above into the tremendous gorge below. On either side rise rocks more than 2000 feet in height, the whole forming a picture of almost terrific sublimity. More cascades, more fearful ravines, more lofty crags, and then the diligence arrives at Gondo, the last Swiss village. MARTIGNY TO TURIN, Over the St. Bernard Pass— 28 Hours. This route, though inferior in beauty to many others, is nevertheless interestmg, but is best adapted for pedestrians, a part of the route being by bridle path, where mules only can be used. The journey can be accomplished in two days : viz., from Martigny to Aosta in 17 hours, from Aosta to Turin 9 hours. For those who do not wish to cross the Pass, but only intend visiting the Hospice St. Bernard, the best return route is by the Col de Fenetre and through the Val Ferret. After leaving Martigny the carriage road crosses the Dranse. Just beyond here the road to Chamonix diverges to the right. The road now runs along the Dranse Valley, past Le Brocard and Le Bourgeaud to Les Vallettes, at a height of 1978 feet. About a mile further on the Dranse flows through a narrow gorge, after issuing from a tunnel 70 yards long. At Sembrancher meet two streams, one from the Val de Bagne, the other from the St. Bernard. On the S.W. is seen Mont Catogne, 8530 feet in height. After leaving Orsieres the road again crosses the Dranse,and rises through the upper valley, affording a fine view of Mont Velan, which can be seen nearly as far asBourg St. Pierre. After passing Rive Haute, it makes along curve, which walkers may cutoff. Liddes, a fair sized village, is next reached, where mules to the Hospice may be hired. The mountains seen to the left are the Meringuier and the Maisons Blanches. The road next passes Bourg St. Pierre, and just beyond crosses the Deep Gorge of the Dranse de Valsorey. It was at this point that the passage of the Alps was made by the first Napoleon. At Cantine de Proz is the highest pasture land in the valley, where the carriage road ends. Ascent of xbe Mont Velan can, if MARTIGNY TO TURIN. 29 desired, be made from this point. The bridle path now crosses the pastures of the Plan de Proz, and leads direct to the Hospice, which is situated at a height of 8120 feet. (For particulars, see Cook's \" Switzerland. \") The bridle path now descends between a small lake and the Plan de Jupiter, where a statue erected to the Pennine Jupiter formerly stood. By the side of this lake the Swiss frontier is marked and Italian territory commences. About one hour brings the traveller to St. Remy, the first Italian village. Here can be obtained carriages for Aosta. The country now resumes a fertile aspect. Cultivated land begins at St. Oyen, and increases in quantity as the road de- scends past Gignod and Signaye, where begin the extensive vineyards of Aosta. The mountain seen on the right is the Rintorj in front are the Beccadi Nona, and Mount Emilius, and on the left Monte Rosa. Aosta is a beautifully situated village with a population of 7760. Here are to be seen interesting Roman remains of the time of Augustus. The ascent of the Becca di Nona may be made from here. From its summit, upwards of 10,000 feet, is a splendid view of the whole chain of Mont Blanc and of the Monte Rosa. From Aosta a diligence starts daily to Ivrea, passing by Chatillon, St. Vincent, Montjovet, and Verrex. Beyond this is the picturesque Fort Baid, which in 1800, when defended by 400 Austrians, kept the entire French Army at bay for a week. The road soon crosses the Lys, a torrent coming down from Monte Rosa to Pont St. Martin. After passing the village of Carema and Settimo-Vittone, it descends through a pleasant and picturesque country to Ivrea. The trains from this village to Turin are frequent ; distance 39 miles, and time of journey about two hours. I sella, the frontier town of Switzerland and Italy, is shortly reached. Crevola, with its rock-gallery, gorge, and bridge, passed, a completely new scene unfolds. *' Now the scenery softens,\" says another writer ; \" the Val d'Ossola expands — a charming relief and contrast to past horrors. Luxuriant verdure, plants, vines, insect voices, mellowing tints, the very air ' breathing of the sweet south' ; yes, this is Italy indeed ! '* There is little to tarry for at Domo d'Ossola (for Hotel, see Appendix). More and more delightfully Italian becomes the journey. ^o'Omcw^ can exceed its highly picturesque cVvaxacleT, ^i^^e^va^'^ ^^ FariaJo is approached.

Here, too, the beautiful LagO Maggiore suddenly bursts into view, heightening inconceivably the rich glories of the landscape ; and in the distance is seen I sola Madre, one of the charming islands which stud the lake. After reaching Baveno (where many travellers stay, in order to visit the Borro- mean Isles — seep. ^6), the diligence journey is continued over a road almost wholly supported by granite pillars, by the side of the famous lake ; and passing numerous villas and gardens, it rattles at full speed through the streets of Arona. For Arona, and Tour of the Lago Maggiore, see p. 34. III. FROM LUCERNE OVERTHE ST.GOTTHARD TO COMO. Lucerne (for Hotel, see Appendix). — From Lucerne the steamboat is taken from one end of the lake to the other. It is considered one of the most charming steamboat journeys in Switzerland — perhaps in the whole world. At Fluelen (for Hotel, see Appendix) the diligence is taken. The journey from hence to Camerlata (the station near Como, for Milan) takes generally about twenty-four hours. In the summer season there are two diligences daily. At Altorf (or Altdorf), the capital of the canton of Uri, the colossal statue of William Tell is passed — marking, it is said, the spot where the Swiss hero stood when he aimed at the apple on his son's head. A little farther on is Burglen, the birthplace and home of Tell ; then crossing the Schachenbach (in the waters of which the hero perished while struggling to save a child), and skirting the meadow forming the popular meeting place of the canton, Klus is reached. Then Silenen, and Amsteg, and several minor places follow in rapid succession, the road rising gradually, and the scenery ever}'where being of the most romantic de- scription imaginable. After leaving Amsteg, the road crosses the Reuss, which here dashes madly along, foaming and leap- ing over its rocky bed. The ascent of the St. Gotthard is here commenced : it is not, as many suppose, a single peak or inence, but a mountainous group, presenting many peculiar tures. The region now traversed has occupied a prominent ition in modem Continental history. In the valley of the fss and Its surrounding neighbourhood sevetal of the dead- LUCERNE TO COMO. 3 1 liest struggles occasioned by the outbreak of war between France, Germany, and Russia, in 1799, took place; the French, after their defeat of the Russian general, occupying the road as far as the Hospice of St. Gotthard, the materials of which Were used by them as fuel. After frequently grossing and recrossing the Reuss, and pass- ing Wasen and Wattingen, Goschenen is reached. About one mile beyond this is the entrance to Great St. Gotthard Tunnel. This gigantic enterprise, now near its completion, will when finished bring Italy into direct railway connection with Central Europe, and shorten the mail route to Brindisi by several hours. Visitors are not admitted to the Tunnel, which, although completed, will probably not be open for traffic for a year or tWo. Shortly after passing the entrance begins the dark and rocky pass of the Schollenen, which is three miles in length. In it, about three and a half miles from Goschenen, stands the Devil's Bridge, which spans the falls of the Reuss, 100 feet in height. Here a tremendous battle was fought in 1799, between the French and Austrians, numbers of whom perished in the abyss beneath. The bridge is a modem structure ; the old bridge, the ruins of which, covered with creeping plants, are yet visible, was blown up by the Austrians while being forced back by the French, during the conflict. Although as a rule good prose is preferable to verse, espe- cially in a work intended to be a useful guide, the following lines so well apply to this interesting spot that no apology is needed for their insertion. ** Called the Devil's Bridge : With a single arch, from ridge to ridge, It leaps across the terrible chasm Yawning beneath us, black and deep, As if, in some convulsive spasm, The summits of the hills had cracked, And made a road for the cataract That raves and rages down the steep !

As this is only one mile from the Devil's Bridge, it is a good place to break the journey at, or else at Hospenthal (for Hotel, see Appendix), about ij mile farther on. From Hospenthal, where the road to the Furca diverges, the road becomes steeper, ascending by numerous windings, each more and more impressive, till the summit of the path is reached. At Albergo del St. Gotthard, 6900 feet above the level of the sea, is the famous Hospice, where superior Newfoundland dogs may be purchased, at somewhat high rates, by those fond of canine companions. A pause is made at the post-house for some time, while the travellers dine. It is in the St. Gotthard that the Rhine, Rhone, and Reuss have their source. Hepworth Dixon, in \" The Switzers,\" says, in speaking of the St. Gotthard : — ** Her cardinal peak is Galen-stock, — the peak now towering on our right, — a fount of light and beauty in this sombre realm, which ancient shepherds, coming up the valleys of the Rhone and Reuss in search of fortune, called the 'Pillar of the Sun.* He is the Saul of the St. Gotthard group, — above the tallest of his brethren : Gerstenhorn, Lucendro, Mutt-horn, Spitzbt-rg, Six Madu'n,— though all these mountains are of Anak breed. Three glaciers hang above his hoary neck, and shiver down his sturdy sides : the Tiefen glacier on his northern flank, the Siedeln glacier on his southern flank, and the Rhone glacier (which has many feeders) on his western flank. These glaciers drip by different ravines, and descend to different seas. Above his summit floats a canopy of cloud, from under which at times leap fire and wind and hail — those rival demons of this upper air, which shake and daze the earth in their plutonic and mag- netic strife. About his feet, low down among the ruts and wrecks of ice, lie caves of wondrous beauty and uncounted wealth. Three years ago a cave was entered by this Tiefen glacier, when the noblest crystals in the world were found. The rock was topaz. Fragments lay about in heaps, each broken piece a hundred pounds to two hundred pounds in weight. Some fifteen tons of topaz were removed from this great hiding- place of nature in a single year. What sage can count the marvels yet in lurking near this Pillar of the Sun ? \" Crossing the Ticino, the spot is seen where the Russian General Suwarrow, seeing his grenadiers waver under the fearful lire of the French, caused a grave to be dug, declaring he would ^p buried at the place where, for the first time, his soldiers had LUCERNE TO COMO. 33 retreated. The effect was electrical. With a loud cry they furiously charged the French, driving them back to Lucerne : the Devil's Bridge, destroyed a second time by the French, being crossed by means of planks suspended from the soldiers' scarves. Descending the Yal Tremola, a wild and dismal valley in which avalanches are not uncommon, Airolo is reached, where stands a tower more than a thousand years old, and where the sound of the Italian language reminds the traveller that he is almost in another country. The route now becomes exceed- ingly beautiful ; picturesque ravines, mouldering ruins, foaming cataracts, huge masses of rock, and other romantic features, imparting fresh charms to the landscape. Passing Faido, the scenery becomes more Italian in appearance. The masses of snow which encumbered the roadside have completely disap- peared, and everywhere the prospect brings to mind the artistic productions of Claude. The rich sunshine sparkles on the roofs of the numerous church- towers, cascades leap in a thousand fanastic forms over the time-beaten cliffs, while here and there the mulberry, the tig, and the vine lend fresh attractions to the view. Then in swift succession the towns of Giornico (where 15,000 Milanese were ingloriously routed by 600 Swiss in 1478), Bodio, Poleggio, and Osogna, situated at the base of a rocky peak, are passed. Two or three small villages follow, then the Moesa is crossed, and the road passing ArbedO (where, in 1422, 3,000 Swiss were defeated by 24,000 Milanese), brings to view the frowning walls and lofty turrets of Bellinzona (for Hotel, see Appendix). Omnibus may be taken from here to Magadino (p. 34). Travellers who intend to visit Lake Mag- giore take the train ac Bellinzona for Locano. Travellers for Milan direct take train at Lugano. The position of the fortress - town was formerly one of great strength. Nothing can surpass the superb character of the landscape at this point. Near Cadenazzo, emerging from the charming valley of the Ticino, through which the traveller has so long been pleasantly travelling, and, passing through a rich chestnut wood and past various mountains and villages, he arrives at Lugano (for Hotel, see Appendix). Passing by the east side of the Lake of Lugano, we arrive at Melide, where the lake is crossed by means of a stone dam, erected some years since at a cost of 700,000 francs. At Mendrisio is seen Monte Generoso, **The Rigi of Italian Switzerland,'* and a favourite resort of the tiL^^\\vexv^^A botanist desirous of enriching his coWecUoiv 'w\\>^\\ ^^^^cvaxtTsSk <^ the Jlora of the Southern Alps.

The route is by rail from Milan to Lecco, and hence by steamboat and diligence to Bellaggio, Menaggio, Porlezza, Lugano, Porto Caresio, Varese, Laveno, Locarno, Pal- lanza, Stresa, Isola Bella, to Arona, and thence by rail to Milan. Full particulars of the departures and arrivals of the trains, steamboats, etc., will be found in the Indicator e Ufficiale, or Bradshaw of the Italian railways. LAGO MAGGIORE. From Magadino to Arona. Lago Maggiore (the Greater Lake) is the largest of all the lakes that lie embosomed in the beautiful scenery at the foot of the Alps, on the Italian side. It was the Lacus Ferlanus of the Romans — is about forty miles long, and varies considerably in width. Near Arona it has more the appearance of a broad river ; at Baveno, between which town and Laveno is its greatest width, it is about five miles wide. The scenery is unequal, the northern part being much finer than the southern. The glory of the lake culminates in the neighbourhood of Baveno and Stresa, and these are the favourite halting-places of visitors, as they command views of the strangely beautiful Borromean Isles, and the deep bold bay in which they are situated. Three rivers flow into the lake : the Ticino, from St. Gotthard and Bernar- dino ; the Toccia, from Domo d'Ossola ; and the Tresa, from Lago Lugano. In the summer-time there are three Steamboats daily. The journey from Magadino to Arona takes about six hours, and the fare is about fL\\t francs. Ample information may be obtained as to times of starting, fares, and other kindred sub- jects, from the announcements to be seen at all Hotels in the ^HJ|hbourhood. Those who can only afford a short time for the ^^^fc*hould go at once to Baveno (or halt there if they have ■inrer the Simplon — see p. 26), or Stresa, a delightful halt- \"ej and visit the Borromean Isles. In taking a boat ITALIAN LAKES — MAGGIORE. 35 from either place, however, let the tourist see to it that he is Dot swindled. At the best the fares are extravagantly dear. If time permits, a voyage up and down the lake should be made. At different times of the day^ and under different lights, it is surprising what varied effects are seen. A Tour of the Lakes may be made thus : — ^Visit Lago Maggiore, and terminate the journey at Luino (see below). Take diligence or carriage to Lugano (p. 44). Make the tour of the lake, and terminate the journey at Porlezza (p. 44). From Porlezza take omnibus or carriage to Menaggio, on the lake of Como (p. 41) ; and if Lago d'Iseo (p. 46) and Lago di Garda are to be visited, terminate the Como journey at Lecco, and take train via Bergamo (p. 95). [W. and E. stand for right and left going down the lake.] Magadiiio (E.) — Let not the traveller think that this miserable place represents the towns of the lake, or that the view he gets over the wretched delta of the Ticino gives him the faintest clue to an idea as to what the lake really is. Maga- dino is stale, flat, unprofitable, and, moreover, very unheal£y. But the boats start from here, downward journey j or from Arona (p. 38), up ward journey, and this infliction must be borne. Locarno (W.), across the lake, is the first town to stop at. It is one of the three capitals of Tessin, Tessia, or Ticino — a bustling little place ; and on market days (every alternate Thursday) it is gay with the curious costumes of the neigh- bouring villagers. The chief curiosity here is a pilgrimage church (Madonna del vSayjo), with the fourteen stations of thecross. Above it, at the top of the hill, a glorious view is to be obtained. Ascona (W.) — ^A ruined castle above. BrissagO (W.) abounds with orange and lemon orchards, figs, olives, and pomegranates, and strong cigars. Notice the rows of cypresses leading to the church. The high hill is Mont Limidario (6550 feet). Canobbio (W.) — A pretty place, at the entrance of the Val Cannobbino. The church is said to have been designed by Bramante, and the frescoes therein are by Gaudenzio Ferrari. Maccagno (E.) — Uninfluential. The narrowest part of the northern end of the lake is here. Luino (E.) — Lnportant, because those who are making a tour of the Italian lakes will take the diligence from this town (or private carriage for about fifteen francs), and enjoy oa<^ ^^ the sweetest drives that heart can concewe Vo Ym^wio V:^. vJ^* Every step of the way is interesting, Lxxmo \\s \\tA.ex^^^xa%^^^'S^ 36 ITALIAN LAKES — BORROMEAN ISLAND?. the fact of its being the birthplace of Bernardino Luini, with whose paintings we shall become familiar in the Italian gal- leries. Cannero (W.) is a very fruitful place, and from the boat looks enchanting, especially when the sun is shining in his strength. The two islands opposite the town, with the two ruined castles, were once inhabited by the Messrs. Mazzarda, four brigand brothers, who were the terror of well-doers and the praise of tho«!e who did evil in the fifteenth century. Horrible stories are told of what they did and the terror they inspired. OggebbiO (W.)— Unimportant. Porto (E.)— Ditto. LaveilO (E.) is a charming spot, deriving its chief attrac- tion from the beautiful mountain // Sasso del Ferro. From its summit can be seen Milan on the one hand and Monte Rosa on the other. From Laveno to Intra, and from Pallanza to the Isles, attention must be paid to the glorious glimpses of mountain scenery, including Monte Rosa, the Strahlhorn, and the Simplon. From Laveno to Varese, see p. 4j. Intra (W.) — A business-like, prosperous town. Silk winding from the cocoon is carried on to a great extent here. And now, all about, wonders and beauties multiply, and every view is marvellously interesting. Pallanza (W.)— (For Hotel, see Appendix). Baveno (W.) — From either of these delightful towns the Isles can be easily visited. Baveno is the point from whence travellers proceed over the Simplon. (Seep. 26). From Pal- lanza a most pleasant journey may be made (by omnibus daily) to the LagO d'Orta, a picturesque lake nine miles long, and a fine centre for excursions. (See p. 45). The Borromean Islands Are four in number ; three of them belong to the noble Lom- bard family of Borromeo — viz., Isola S. Giovanni, Isola Bella, and Isola Madre. The remaining island of the group is Isola Superiore, or Dei Pescatori (the Fishermen's Island). \" The principal attraction to most travellers is the I sola Bella (or Beautiful Island). This particular island, which is thoroughly artificial, is rather curious than picturesque or beauti- ful ; but it tells well at a distance, with its lofty palace, its ter- iwces, and forma] groves and gardens, and contrasts in a striking ITALIAN LAKES — BORROMEAN ISLANDS. 37 manner with the simplicity or wild nature of the other islands, while it calls for that tribute always due to the art and industry of man when they have overcome great natural diffi- culties. \" We learn from an old Lombard writer that originally the [sola Bella was nothing but a bare rock, cut through and through, in some directions, by the constant lashing and biting of the waves, which are occasionally sufficiently stormy. Aboiic the year 1670, the wealthy Count Vitaliano Borromeo conceived the idea of converting this rock into what he considered a terrestrial paradise. He began by quarrying a portion of the rock to get materials to build with, after which he erected pilasters, arches, walls, and buttresses j and that part of the work being done, he, at an immense expense, caused earth to be brought in boats from the mainland, and had it laid down over all, to form a sufficiently deep, compact, and productive soil. Tree-planting, gardening, and house-building followed, and in process of time the island became what we now see it. To those who had seen it before, and who came upon it sud- denly after its metamorphosis, it may indeed have appeared an enchanted island j and even now there is something magical about it. The upper terrace commands varied and enchanting views. To the south, on the water's edge, is the little white town of Stresa, with its exquisite villas ; above Stresa are vine- yards and cottages ; and again, above these, green hill-sides and pasture-land dotted with fawn or cream-coloured cattle. To the north-west are the forked summits of the Simplon, on which the snow never melts ; to the north and north-east the Monte Rosa and other magnificent Alps. To the east the lake spreads far away, to where it washes the feet of the gentle hills about Lavena and Cerro ; and to the west is the bay, with the town of Baveno.\" The Chateau contains some good pictures, and other objects of interest, accessible to visitors ; amongst them the room in which Napoleon slept the night before the battle of Marengo. The fee to the gardens is one franc, and the chateau one franc ; less for a party of two or three. I sola Madre is a charming place, with seven terraces beautifully laid out and tended.

I sola di S« Giovanni is not so interesting as any of the others. The steamers stop at Isola Bella, and passengers are conveyed without extra charges for landing or embarking. As there are five or six a day, those who wish can break their journey here. The steamer now proceeds to Stresa (for Hotel, see Appendix). — Stresa is a pleasant place, surrounded with fine scenery, landscape and waterscape. From here the Monte Motterone may be ascended; it is 4174 feet above the lake, and the view equals, if it does not rival, that from the Rigi ; the plains of Lombardy and Piedmont, with the cathedral of Milan in clear view ; six of the Italian lakes, with their picturesque islands and surroundings 5 the rivers Sesia and Ticino meandering in streams of silver : and, on the other hand, the great mountains from Monte Rosa to Ortler in the Tyrol. From Stresa the drive to Arona is pleasant.

Maria, con- taining the chapel of the Borromeo family, in which is a fine painting by Gaudenzio Find, an old and rare master 5 it is a Holy Family, with smaller pictures of saints, and a portrait of the Countess Borromeo, who presented it to the church. A short distance from the town, half an hour's walk to the north of the railway station, is the colossal Statue of San Carlo Borromeo. Carlo Borromeo was born at Arona, Oct. 2, 1538 5 he died and was buried at Milan in Nov., 1584 (see p. 71)5 and in 1600 he was canonized. This statue, erected in 1697, is sixty-six feet high, and stands on a pedestal forty feet high ; the head and hands and feet are bronze, while the robe is of wrought copper. The good saint stands with his hands outstretched in blessing 5 and sacred as the name is in these parts, one would have thought he might have been left to stand and bless his native town in peace.
