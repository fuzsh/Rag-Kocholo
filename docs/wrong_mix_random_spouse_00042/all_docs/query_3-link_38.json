        "text": "Carmine Giovinazzo may have a DUI on his record, but at least he was apparently polite about it! The CSI: NY star, 39, was arrested for DUI in Scottsdale, Ariz. on Jan. 2, with police reporting that he was \"immediately apologetic.\"\n\nAccording to the report (via E! News), Giovinazzo, who lives in California, initially claimed he was lost and distracted trying to work his GPS. But the actor, who plays Detective Danny Messer on the CBS drama, then confessed to drinking scotch at the nearby W hotel before driving himself and friends.\n\nAfter being given a field sobriety test and blowing nearly twice the legal limit, he was booked at a nearby jail.\n\nGiovinazzo's arresting officer noted in his report that the star \"thanked me many times for not treating him like a criminal and showing him respect.\" He added, \"Carmine was very polite and cooperative with me throughout the investigation.\""
