        "text": "Carmine Giovinazzo (CSI: NY) and Jon Sklaroff (24, Life) have landed recurring roles on USA Network‘s police drama Graceland. Giovinazzo will play Sid Markham, the head of LAPD’s Gang Task Force. Sid is more mind than muscle and uses his intelligence and ability to read people as a way to build relationships and close cases — but that doesn’t mean he’s not prone to acts of violence here and there. Briggs (Daniel Sunjata) grows close to him, seeing Sid as a helpful tool in taking down a cartel. Sklaroff will play Fritz, who has has made his living in the vilest way possible: through human trafficking. He uses intimidation and brutality to keep “his property” in line. The depravity of his operation leaves the team reeling.\n\nRelated: 2014 USA Network Pilots\n\nGraceland marks Giovinazzo’s first TV gig since his lead role as on Danny Messer on CSI: NY, which wrapped its nine-season run last year. His credits also include such films as Black Hawk Down and For Love Of The Game. He is repped by Elevate Entertainment. Sklaroff’s recent credits include Vegas and The Closer and next appears in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He is repped by Ellis Talent Group, The Marshak/Zachary Company and Paradigm."
