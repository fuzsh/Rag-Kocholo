        "text": "He has been acting for thirteen years, but Carmine Giovinazzo originally wanted to become a baseball player. Why did Giovinazzo become an actor?\n\nCarmine Dominick Giovinazzo was born on August 24, 1973 in Staten Island, New York. He made short films, but remembers no particular time of thinking about becoming an actor. He grew up as an athlete, playing roller hockey, basketball, and baseball. But, due to a serious back injury, Giovinazzo's hopes were crushed. He started to get emotionally depressed. But, with the help from his family, he turned to acting. (rottentomatoes.com)\n\nHis first Hollywood role was in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot: “Welcome to Hellmouth.” He has appeared in many TV shows as a guest-star, been on many talk shows, and has also been in many movies such as Conception, No Way Home, etc. He is currently playing the role of CSI: NY's Danny Messer. He also turns to his father and sister for advice on how to portray a better police officer because his father is a former police officer and his sister is a police officer.\n\nIn his spare time, he paints, reads poetry, writes songs, and plays guitar. He has his own band named “Ceesau.” It includes Giovinazzo as lead vocals and rhythm guitar, John Patrick Annedori as lead guitar and backup vocals, and Micheal Brasic on drums.\n\nAs you can see, Giovinazzo is a hero because, after he was depressed about his serious back injury and losing his career, he got back out there and did something great, became an actor."
