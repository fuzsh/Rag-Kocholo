To this end, 10 HCV proteins, 10 human TLRs, and 41 proteins from the TLR-induced downstream pathways were considered from the prevalence of intrinsic disorder. Mapping of the intrinsic disorder to the HCV-TLR interactome and to the TLR-based pathways of human innate immune response to the HCV infection demonstrates that substantial levels of intrinsic disorder are characteristic for proteins involved in the regulation and execution of these innate immunity pathways and in HCV-TLR interaction. Disordered regions, being commonly enriched in sites of various posttranslational modifications, may play important functional roles by promoting protein–protein interactions and support the binding of the analyzed proteins to other partners such as nucleic acids. It seems that this system represents an important illustration of the role of intrinsic disorder in virus–host warfare.

The test incorporated different rodent species that dwell in different habitats and display different life and motor styles. Testing was performed in a three-dimensional Y-maze in which the basis was horizontal and, by rotating it, one arm of the maze could be pointing upwards at a certain angle and the other arm pointed downwards at the same angle. All the tested species displayed a general preference for descent, with rodents from complex habitats being less affected by inclination compared with rodents from flatlands. Unlike laboratory rats, wild species traveled greater distances along the lower compared to the upper maze arm. All the rodents initially tended to travel the entire length of the inclined maze arms, but such complete trips decreased with the increase in inclination. When introduced into the maze from top or bottom, flatland dwellers traveled mainly in the entry arm. Overall, when given the choice to ascend or descend, all the tested species displayed a preference to descend, perhaps as attraction to the ground, where they usually have their burrows.

We determined the concentrations of the 67 most abundant metabolites in the eye lenses of the following 14 species from 6 orders of the class Aves (Birds): the Black kite (Milvus migrans), Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), Northern raven (Corvus corax), Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), Godlewski’s bunting (Emberiza godlewskii), Great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus), Great tit (Parus major), Hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes), Hooded crow (Corvus cornix), House sparrow (Passer domesticus), Rock dove (Columba livia), Rook (Corvus frugilegus), Short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) and Ural owl (Strix uralensis). Further analysis shows that the statistical approaches generally used in metabolomics can be applied for differentiation between species, and the most fruitful results were obtained with hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). We observed the grouping of conspecific samples independently of the sampling place and date. The HCA tree structure supports the key role of genomics in the formation of the lens metabolome, but it also indicates the influence of the species lifestyle. A combination of genomics-based and metabolomics-based phylogeny could potentially resolve arising issues and yield a more reliable tree of life.

Most anthropological methods for predicting population affinity rely on complete crania or cranial parts. However, complete parts are frequently not found in forensic and bioarchaeological contexts. In contrast, the petrous portion of the cranium presents a unique rate of preservation in the field. Therefore, this study aimed to develop stepwise discriminant function formulae to determine population affinity using measurements on three-dimensional models of the human adult bony labyrinth. The sample utilised consisted of 30 German, 38 African Zulu, and 30 Oneota individuals. A total of four function equations were developed. The function involving all three populations presented an average accuracy of 90.8%. Mathematical equations were also derived to discriminate between Zulu and Germans (91.2%), Zulu and Oneota (95.5%), as well as Oneota and Germans (96.7%). These results indicate this new method of population affinity identification is highly successful, even with fragmentary remains.

A total of 111 children and adolescents who underwent liver ultrasonography with ATI for suspected hepatic steatosis were included. Participants were classified into the normal, mild, or moderate–severe fatty liver group according to grayscale US findings. Associations between clinical factors, magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction, steatosis stage and ATI values were evaluated. To determine the cutoff values of ATI for staging hepatic steatosis, areas under the curve (AUCs) were analyzed. Factors that could cause measurement failure with ATI were assessed. Of 111 participants, 88 had successful measurement results. Median ATI values were significantly increased according to steatosis stage (p < 0.001). Body mass index (BMI) was a significant factor for increased ATI values (p = 0.047). To differentiate fatty liver from normal liver, a cutoff value of 0.59 dB/cm/MHz could be used with an AUC value of 0.853. To differentiate moderate to severe fatty liver from mild fatty liver, a cutoff value of 0.69 dB/cm/MHz could be used with an AUC value up to 0.91. ATI can be used in children as an effective ultrasonography technique for quantifying and staging pediatric hepatic steatosis.

Four strains were studied: Chlorella vulgaris UAL-1, Chlorella sp. UAL-2, Chlorella vulgaris UAL-3, and Chlamydopodium fusiforme UAL-4. The highest biomass productivity was found for C. fusiforme, with a value of 0.38 ± 0.01 g·L−1·day−1. C. vulgaris UAL-1 achieved a biomass productivity of 0.31 ± 0.03 g·L−1·day−1 (the highest for the Chlorella genus), while the N-NH4+, N-NO3−, and P-PO43− removal capacities of this strain were 51.9 ± 2.4, 0.8 ± 0.1, and 5.7 ± 0.3 mg·L−1·day−1, respectively. C. vulgaris UAL-1 showed the greatest potential for use as a biostimulant—when used at a concentration of 0.1 g·L−1, it increased the germination index of watercress seeds by 3.5%. At concentrations of 0.5 and 2.0 g·L−1, the biomass from this microalga promoted adventitious root formation in soybean seeds by 220% and 493%, respectively. The cucumber expansion test suggested a cytokinin-like effect from C. vulgaris UAL-1; it was also the only strain that promoted the formation of chlorophylls in wheat leaves. Overall, the results of the present study suggest the potential of producing C. vulgaris UAL-1 using centrate and wastewater as well as the potential utilisation of its biomass to develop high-value biostimulants.

This index can be regarded as an effect trait that is useful for predicting ecosystem processes impacted by animal burrow ventilation. The special feature, and presumably an advantage, of BIPc, compared to alternative recently developed benthic macrofauna-based bioirrigation indices, lies in its ability to distinguish the taxa-specific score values between diffusion- and advection-dominated sediment systems. The usefulness of the BIPc index was compared against the estimates of the well-established community bioturbation potential index (BPc). The BIPc index displayed a moderately but significantly stronger correlation with estimates of irrigation rates derived from tracer experiments. Using a random forest machine learning approach and a number of available relevant environmental predictor layers, we have modelled and mapped the spatial differences in this ecosystem functioning expression. The key species contributing to bioirrigation potential in the study area were identified. The interannual variation in BIPc was assessed on a small exemplary dataset. The scores required to calculate the index, that were assigned to 120 taxa dominating abundance and biomass in the region, are provided for reuse. The utility, temporal variability and uncertainty of the distribution estimate are discussed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a short MEP (Vivifrail; <4 weeks) on improving frailty in post-COVID-19 older adults after intensive care units. Methods: To develop a retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the functional gait training program based on selected Vivifrail MEP in a single-group and applied to patients admitted with a diagnosis of post-COVID-19 functional impairment. The MEP was carried out for 3 weeks, with daily sessions lasting 40 min. Patients included were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the protocol by using the Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB), the number of falls in the last year, the number of falls with medical attention, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the presence of dementia, the Trunk Control Test (TCT), the Tinetti balance and gait test, Barthel Index, Medical Research Council Sum Score (MRCSS) and handgrip strength dynamometry. Results: The results of this study show statistically significant improvements in physical fitness and frailty with increases in the Short Physical Performance Battery (Z = 9.12, p < 0.001) by means of the MET applied in its short version (<4 weeks) showing even clinically relevant improvements (>2.5 points). Statistically significant improvements were also found in Medical Research Council Sum Score (Z = 12.345, p < 0.001), Barthel Index Score (Z = 12.272, p < 0.001), Trunk Control Test (Z = 12. 36, p < 0.001), Tinetti–POMA (Z = 12.293, p < 0.001) including the balance (Z = 12.11, p < 0.001), gait (Z = 12.164, p < 0.001) subscales and in the hand dynamometry (Z = 12.172, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The selected Vivifrail MEP is effective and safe for improving frailty in post-COVID-19 older adult’s patients.

In recent years, resistant M. bovis isolates, especially to fluoroquinolones, have been reported globally as a result of the extensive usage of antimicrobials in the treatment of bovine pneumonia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bovine Mycoplasma spp. isolated from the respiratory tracts of cattle in Egypt and to assess the fluoroquinolones resistance in the recovered mycoplasma isolates via broth microdilution and conventional PCR techniques. Conventional phenotypic methods identified 128 mycoplasma isolates (32%) from 400 different samples, with M. bovis being the predominant spp. (61%), followed by M. bovirhinis (15%). Of note, mycoplasma isolates were rarely isolated from total healthy lung tissues (7/55, 12.7%), but they were frequently isolated from pneumonic lungs (31/45, 68.9%). All the examined mycoplasma isolates (n = 76) were sensitive to tilmicosin, tylosin, tulathromycin, spiramycin, and spectinomycin (100% each), while 60.5% and 43.4% of the examined isolates had high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values to enrofloxacin and doxycycline, respectively. Three and two mycoplasma isolates with high enrofloxacin MICs were confirmed to be M. bovis and M. bovirhinis, respectively, by PCR assays. All molecularly confirmed mycoplasma isolates (n = 5) were positive for the gyrA gene (100%); meanwhile, three isolates (60%) were positive for the parC gene. In conclusion, our findings revealed alarming resistance to enrofloxacin and doxycycline antibiotics; thus, antimicrobial usage must be restricted and molecular techniques can help in the rapid detection of the resistant strains.

Twenty microarray datasets were selected and analyzed separately to identify hub differentiated expressed genes and compared to identify all the deregulated genes and transcription factors in common between the three types of cancer and those unique to lung cancer. The winning DEGs analysis allowed to identify an important number of TFs deregulated in the majority of microarray datasets, which can become key biomarkers of general tumors and specific to lung cancer. A coexpression network was constructed for every dataset with all deregulated genes associated with lung cancer, according to DAVID’s tool enrichment analysis, and transcription factors capable of regulating them, according to oPOSSUM´s tool. Several genes and transcription factors are coexpressed in the networks, suggesting that they could be related to the establishment or progression of the tumoral pathology in any tissue and specifically in the lung. The comparison of the coexpression networks of lung cancer and other types of cancer allowed the identification of common connectivity patterns with deregulated genes and transcription factors correlated to important tumoral processes and signaling pathways that have not been studied yet to experimentally validate their role in lung cancer. The Kaplan–Meier estimator determined the association of thirteen deregulated top winning transcription factors with the survival of lung cancer patients. The coregulatory analysis identified two top winning transcription factors networks related to the regulatory control of gene expression in lung and breast cancer. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests that cancer has an important coregulatory network of transcription factors related to the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer. Moreover, lung cancer has a group of genes and transcription factors unique to pulmonary tissue that are coexpressed during tumorigenesis and must be studied experimentally to fully understand their role in the pathogenesis within its very complex transcriptomic scenario. Therefore, the downstream bioinformatic analysis developed was able to identify a coregulatory metafirm of cancer in general and specific to lung cancer taking into account the great heterogeneity of the tumoral process at cellular and population levels.

The exogenous application of hormones (estradiol and methyltestosterone) can change the direction of gonadal differentiation of P. sinensis to produce sex reversed individuals. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis of four types of P. sinensis (female, male, pseudo-female, and pseudo-male) gonads were compared. Quantitative analysis of 6107 labeled proteins in the four types of P. sinensis gonads was performed. We identified 440 downregulated and 423 upregulated proteins between pseudo-females and males, as well as 394 downregulated and 959 upregulated proteins between pseudo-males and females. In the two comparisons, the differentially expressed proteins, including K7FKG1, K7GIQ2, COL4A6, K7F2U2, and K7FF80, were enriched in some important pathways, such as focal adhesion, endocytosis, apoptosis, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, which were upregulated in pseudo-female vs. male and downregulated in pseudo-male vs. female. In pathways such as ribosome and spliceosome, the levels of RPL28, SRSF3, SNRNP40, and HNRNPK were increased from male to pseudo-female, while they decreased from female to pseudo-male. All differentially expressed proteins after sexual reversal were divided into six clusters, according to their altered levels in the four types of P. sinensis, and associated with cellular processes, such as embryonic development and catabolic process, that were closely related to sexual reversal. These data will provide clues for the sexual reversal mechanism in P. sinensis.

Regarding this issue, the World Health Organization has promoted research studies that aim to develop new strategies using natural products. Although they are often competitive with synthetic pharmaceuticales in clinical performance, they lack their critical drawbacks, i.e., the environmental impact and the high economic costs of processing. In this paper, the isolation of a highly performant antibacterial and antifungal lipophilic natural mixture from leaves of savoy and white cabbages is proposed as successful preliminary results for the valorization of agricultural waste produced in cabbage cultivation. The fraction was chemically extracted from vegetables with diethyl ether and tested against two Candida species, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus reference strains. All the different fractions (active and not active) were chemically characterized by vibrational FT-IR spectroscopy and GC-MS analyses. The extracts showed high growth-inhibition performance on pathogens, thus demonstrating strong application potential. We think that this work, despite being at a preliminary stage, is very promising, both from pharmaceutical and industrial points of view, and can be proposed as a proof of concept for the recovery of agricultural production wastes.

Although more than 150 genetic variants have been correlated with elite athlete status, genetic foundations of competition-facilitating behavior influencing elite performances are still scarce. This is the first study designed to examine the distribution of genetic determinants in the athletic performance of elite rink-hockey players. A total of 116 of the world’s top best rink-hockey players (28.2 ± 8.7 years old; more than 50% are cumulatively from the best four world teams and the best five Portuguese teams), who participated at the elite level in the National Rink-Hockey Championship in Portugal, were evaluated in anthropometric indicators/measurements, training conditions, sport experience and sport injuries history. Seven genetic polymorphisms were analyzed. Polymorphism genotyping was performed using the TaqMan® Allelic Discrimination Methodology. Rink-hockey players demonstrated significantly different characteristics according to sex, namely anthropometrics, training habits, sports injuries and genetic variants, such as Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) rs731236 (p < 0.05). The Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) rs324420 A allele was significantly associated with improved athletic performance (AA/AC vs. CC, OR = 2.80; 95% Cl, 1.23–6.35; p = 0.014; p = 0.008 after Bootstrap) and confirmed as an independent predictor among elite rink-hockey players (adjusted OR = 2.88; 95% Cl, 1.06–7.80; p = 0.038). Our results open an interesting link from FAAH-related biology to athletic performance.

This work aims at investigating sexually dimorphic features in fibular proximal and distal epiphyses through geometric morphometrics methods. A total of 136 left fibulae, from two Italian and one South African identified skeletal collections were virtually acquired through CT and laser scanning and analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. Statistical analyses were performed on shape, form, and size variables. Results show that fibular epiphyses are smaller with narrower articular surfaces in females than in males in both extremities. Relevant sexual differences emerge in fibular form and size for the two Italian samples but not for the South African one, likely for its small sample size. Discriminant analysis on form principal components (PCs) offers accuracy above 80% when the samples are pooled, and reaches accuracy of 80–93% when the Italian samples are considered separately. However, our method on form PCs was not successful for the South African sample (50–53% accuracy), possibly due to the small sample size. These results show relevant morphological variation in relation to fibular form and size, with a degree of accuracy that indicates the utility of the present method for sexing human fibulae in both forensic and bioarchaeological contexts for Italian samples.

However, the pathways and genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis at the key developmental stages of Citrus aurantium L. are not fully understood. This study found that the total flavonoid concentration gradually decreased as the fruit developed. Additionally, it showed that neohesperidin was the main flavonoid in the early stages of sour orange fruit development. However, as the development stage progressed, naringin content increased rapidly and emerged as the main flavonoid component. From 27 cDNA libraries, RNA sequencing yielded 16.64 billion clean bases, including 8989 differentially expressed genes. We identified 74 flavonoid related unigenes mapped to the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. A total of 152 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase genes (UGTs) were identified from C. aurantium L. transcriptome database, in which 22 key flavonoid-correlated UGTs were divided into five main AtGT groups: E, G, I, L, M. We observed that the ethylene responsive factors (ERF) and myeloblastosis (MYB) family mainly regulated the key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Overall, our study generated extensive and detailed transcriptome data on the development of C. aurantium L. and characterized the flavonoid biosynthesis pattern during its fruit developmental stages. These results will benefit genetic modification or selection to increase the flavonoid content in sour oranges.

The northern boundary of Pinus taiwanensis Hayata is here; thus, climate information is well recorded in its tree rings. Based on developed earlywood width (EWW), latewood width (LWW) and total ring width (RW) chronologies (time period: 1887–2014 year) of Pinus taiwanensis Hayata in the Tongbai Mountains in central China, this paper analyzed characteristics of these chronologies and correlations between these chronologies and climate factors. The correlation results showed that earlywood width chronology contains more climate information than latewood width chronology and total ring width chronology, and mean temperature and mean maximum temperature in May–June were the main limiting factors for radial growth of Pinus taiwanensis Hayata. The highest significant value in all correlation analyses is −0.669 (p < 0.05) between earlywood width chronology and May–June mean temperature (TMJ) in the pre-mutation period (1958–2005) based on mutating in 2006. Thus, this paper reconstructed May–June mean temperature using earlywood width chronology from 1901 to 2005 (reliable period of earlywood width chronology is 1901–2014). The reconstructed May–June mean temperature experienced eight warmer periods and eight colder periods and also showed 2–3a cycle change over the past 105 years. The spatial correlation showed that the reconstructed series was representative of the May–June mean temperature variation in central and eastern China and significant positive/negative correlation with the sea surface temperature (SST) of the subtropical Pacific Ocean and the tropical Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean from the previous October to the current June. This also indicated that May–June mean temperature periodic fluctuations might be related to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropical Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. The results of this study have extended and supplemented the meteorological records of the Tongbai Mountains and have a guiding significance for forest tending and management in this area.

This study is a validation test of the Total Difference Method (TDM). The posterior-anterior radiographs of 10 adults were assessed by two observers using three modes: the Freehand Mode largely followed the original protocols; the Overlay Mode utilized a tracing overlay; and the Semi-Auto Mode used the overlay and macro, walking the user through multiple steps. The modes were evaluated for the time taken to complete each image and the accuracy and repeatability of the line lengths, midline assessment, and angle placement. The repeated measures analysis of variance results for the intra-observer error revealed differences in bias in the angle placement and line length mean error between the rounds and modes. The differences between the rounds were approximately consistent for each mode, suggesting observer error. Significant differences in the inaccuracy of the angle placement and the line lengths between observers by mode were evident; in post hoc testing, the Freehand Mode and Overlay Mode had the greatest error in both variables (p.adj < 0.0001). The Semi-Auto Mode retained no significant error for angle inaccuracy and had the fewest errors for line length inaccuracy (p.adj < 0.01). When using the Semi-Auto Mode, the time was 46.1% faster than that of the Freehand Mode and 34% faster than that of the Overlay Mode (F2,18 = 52.71, p < 0.0001); time slightly improved with method familiarity. The results suggest that the technique required for the TDM can reliably be repeated, and the semi-automated macro improves accuracy and efficiency, but only after the users are familiar with the method and macro procedures.

AM also had therapeutic effects in various animal experimental models of disease. However, treatment required continuous administration as the half-life of native AM is short in blood. To resolve this, we developed four human IgG1 and IgG4 Fc-fusion proteins containing full-length hAM or hAM residues 6-52. (2) Methods: We used mammalian cells to produce recombinant Fc-AM derivatives and tested the pharmacokinetics and biological activity of Fc-AM. (3) Results: We developed four Fc-fusion AMs (Fc-AM), which are long-acting AM derivatives in mammalian cells. Fc-AM had a prolonged half-life in blood and retained its ability to bind to the AM1 receptor. Fc-AM (6-52) induced higher cAMP levels for the receptor than Fc-AM. After the administration of IgG1-AM (6-52) or IgG4-AM (6-52) to rats, tissue transfer to the kidney and small intestine was observed. In addition, treatment with IgG4-AM (6-52) inhibited blood pressure increase in spontaneously hypertensive rats. (4) Conclusions: Fc-AM produced from mammalian cells can be easily prepared and might be an effective novel therapeutic agent.

The aim of this review was to highlight the use of muscle oxygenation in exercise interventions in clinical trials and to present the technological characteristics related to the equipment used in these studies. PubMed, WOS, and Scopus databases were reviewed up to December 2021. Scientific articles that evaluated muscle oxygenation after exercise interventions in the sick adult population were selected. The PEDro scale was used to analyze the risk of bias (internal validity). The results were presented grouped in tables considering the risk of bias scores, characteristics of the devices, and the effects of exercise on muscle oxygenation. All the stages were carried out using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The search strategy yielded 820 clinical studies, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria. This review detailed the characteristics of 11 NIRS devices used in clinical trials that used physical exercise as an intervention. The use of this technology made it possible to observe changes in muscle oxygenation/deoxygenation parameters such as tissue saturation, oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin in clinical trials of patients with chronic disease. It was concluded that NIRS is a non-invasive method that can be used in clinical studies to detect the effects of physical exercise training on muscle oxygenation, hemodynamics, and metabolism. It will be necessary to unify criteria such as the measurement site, frequency, wavelength, and variables for analysis. This will make it possible to compare different models of exercise/training in terms of time, intensity, frequency, and type to obtain more precise conclusions about their benefits for patients.

However, the functional role/expression of vitamin A receptors (Rarα, β, and γ) in pancreatic β-cells is not clear yet. Accordingly, we performed a series of bioinformatics, molecular and functional experiments in human islet and INS-1 cells to evaluate the role of Rarβ on insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell function. Microarray and RNA-sequencing (RAN-seq) expression analysis showed that RARα, β, and γ are expressed in human pancreatic islets. RNA-seq expression of RARβ in diabetic/hyperglycemic human islets (HbA1c ≥ 6.3%) revealed a significant reduction (p = 0.004) compared to nondiabetic/normoglycemic cells (HbA1c < 6%). The expression of RARβ with INS and PDX1 showed inverse association, while positive correlations were observed with INSR and HbA1c levels. Exploration of the T2D knowledge portal (T2DKP) revealed that several genetic variants in RARβ are associated with BMI. The most associated variant is rs6804842 (p = 1.2 × 10−25). Silencing of Rarβ in INS-1 cells impaired insulin secretion without affecting cell viability or apoptosis. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels were elevated and glucose uptake was reduced in Rarβ-silenced cells. mRNA expression of Ins1, Pdx1, NeuroD1, Mafa, Snap25, Vamp2, and Gck were significantly (p < 0.05) downregulated in Rarβ-silenced cells. For protein levels, Pro/Insulin, PDX1, GLUT2, GCK, pAKT/AKT, and INSR expression were downregulated considerably (p < 0.05). The expression of NEUROD and VAMP2 were not affected. In conclusion, our results indicate that Rarβ is an important molecule for β-cell function. Hence, our data further support the potential role of VA receptors in the development of T2D.

After death, scientific evidence is required in forensic investigations in order to collect as much information as possible on the death circumstances and personal identifiers of the deceased victim. We summarize the associations between the molecular mechanisms of biological rhythms and forensically relevant aspects, including post-mortem interval and cause of death, entomological findings, sex, age, ethnicity and development. Given their importance during lifetime, biological rhythms could be potential tools to draw conclusions on the death circumstances and the identity of a deceased person by mechanistic investigations of the different biological clocks in a forensic context. This review puts the known effects of biological rhythms on the functions of the human organism in context with potential applications in forensic fields of interest, such as personal identification, entomology as well as the determination of the post-mortem interval and cause of death.

Our aims were to assess H. halys-induced tissue damage in tomatoes via computer tomography and to confirm the results of imaging obtained by analytical methods. Our examination confirmed the intensification of the change in the inner structure of damaged tomatoes as a function of time. The tendency of this destruction triggered by bug saliva grew exponentially from the exocarp layer to the inner placenta. The destruction of the plant tissue was aggravated by an increase in the number of bugs, as it was unequivocally evinced by the shell thickness assays. The results of the assessment of the antioxidant capacity of tomato mesocarp showed a distinct decrease in the antioxidant capacity of the samples obtained from H. halys-infested tomatoes. This indicates that the ferric-reducing antioxidant power value was related to the degradation processes of the mesocarp tissue in tomato fruit caused by the watery saliva released by H. halys. The presented experimental method can be suitable for the qualitative control of the vegetable items intended for trade, which can help for the isolation of tomatoes damaged by bugs immediately after harvest.

In recent years, the natural resources of O. bidens have been drastically reduced due to overfishing and the destruction of the water environment. The in vitro culture and long-term preservation of germ stem cells are the key technologies to keep genetic resources from degeneration. However, except for the establishment of the first long-term cultured medaka spermatogonia cell line (SSC) capable of producing sperm in vitro in 2004, no other long-term cultured SSC line has been found in other fish species. In this study, we successfully established another long-term-cultured spermatogonial stem cell line from Opsariichthys bidens (ObSSC). After more than 2 years of culture, ObSSC had a diploid karyotype and stable growth, with the typical gene expression patterns of SSC. Under in vitro culture, ObSSC could be induced to differentiate into sperm and other different types of somatic cells. In vivo, ObSSC could differentiate into different cells of three germ layers upon being transplanted into zebrafish embryos. Our research helps to explore the potential and regulation mechanism of fish SSC differentiation and spermatogenesis in vitro, provides a new way for solving the problem of fish genetic resource degradation and lays a foundation for further research on fish germ cell transplantation.

Studies on the biological effects of nocturnal decreased oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) on coral reefs are very scarce. Coral reefs are fundamental for supporting one quarter of all marine species and essential for around 275 million people worldwide. This study investigates acute physiological and photobiological responses of a scleractinian coral (Acropora spp.) to overnight hypoxic conditions (<2 mg/L of O2). Bleaching was not detected, and visual and physical aspects of corals remained unchanged under hypoxic conditions. Most photobiological-related parameters also did not show significant changes between treatments. In addition to this, no significant differences between treatments were observed in the pigment composition. However, hypoxic conditions induced a significant decrease in coral de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and increase in DNA damage. Although the present findings suggest that Acropora spp. is resilient to some extent to short-term daily oxygen oscillations, long-term exposure to hypoxia, as predicted to occur with climate change, may still have deleterious effects on corals.

We compared six taxonomic groups according to their energetic characteristics and the time of evolutionary divergence. We transformed the slope of the regression lines to the common value and analyzed three criteria for comparing BMR of different taxa regardless of body size. Correlation between average field metabolic rate (FMR) of the group and its average BMR was shown. We evaluated the efficiency of self-maintenance in ordinary life (defined BMR/FMR) in six main groups of endotherms. Our study has shown that metabolic scaling in the main groups of endothermic animals correlates with their evolutionary age: the younger the group, the higher the metabolic rate, but the rate increases more slowly with increasing body weight. We found negative linear relationship for scaling exponents and the allometric coefficient in five groups of endotherms: in units of mL O2/h per g, in relative units of allometric coefficients, and also in level or scaling elevation. Mammals that diverged from the main vertebrate stem earlier have a higher “b” exponent than later divergent birds. A new approach using three criteria for comparing BMR of different taxa regardless of body mass will be useful for many biological size-scaling relationships that follow the power function.

The objective of this study is to provide reference intervals (RIs) for 44 key hematological, blood biochemistry, blood gasometry and hormones biomarkers for the three most economically important farmed salmonid species in Chile (Atlantic salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout) during the freshwater (presmolt and smolt age range) and seawater stages (post-smolt and adult age range). Our results confirmed that the concentration or activity of most blood biomarkers depend on the salmonid species, age range and/or the interaction between them, and they are often biologically related to each other. Erythogram and leukogram profiles revealed a similar distribution in rainbow trout and coho salmon, but those in Atlantic salmon were significantly different. While the activity of the most clinically important plasma enzymes demonstrated a similar profile in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, coho salmon demonstrated a significantly different distribution. Plasma electrolyte and mineral profiles showed significant differences between salmonid species, especially for rainbow trout, while Atlantic salmon and coho salmon demonstrated a high degree of similarity. Furthermore, electrolytes, minerals and blood gasometry biomarkers were significantly different between age ranges, suggesting a considerably different distribution between freshwater and seawater-farmed fish. The RIs of clinically healthy fish described in this study take into account the high biological variation of farmed fish in Chile, as the 3.059 individuals came from 78 different fish farms, both freshwater and seawater, and blood samples were collected using the same pre-analytical protocol. Likewise, our study provides the Chilean salmon farming industry with standardized protocols that can be used routinely and provides valuable information to improve the preventive vision of aquamedicine through the application of blood biomarkers to support and optimize health, welfare and husbandry management in the salmon farming industry.

Methionine is an essential amino acid that contributes to protein formation, fetal development, and milk synthesis; thus, is likely to have positive effects on the weight and size of the newborn and, afterward, milk yield and milk composition, which may improve growth patterns of the progeny. To test these hypotheses, we used 60 pregnant multiparous Alpine goats with similar live weights and gestational ages (~Day 100 of pregnancy; Mean ± SD; 1410 ± 14 days old and 50.4 ± 6.6 kg) and were separated into two groups: control and supplemented with the delivery. Treatments were T-MET (n = 30; received 1% herbal methionine Optimethione® dry matter based on from Day 100 of the pregnancy to delivery) or T-CTL (n = 30; served as the control and did not receive methionine). The methionine powder provided individual supplementation and was adjusted every week as the live weight and dry matter intake changed. At birth, the weight, body mass index (BMI), birth type, and sex of the kids were determined. Subsequently, the progeny was weighed weekly up to weaning. Two weeks after parturition, the milk composition was recorded weekly, and the milk yield was recorded monthly. The maternal live weight at the start (Mean ± SEM; T-CTL: 50.5 ± 1.1 vs. T-MET: 50.3 ± 1.3 kg) and end (T-CTL: 54.2 ± 1.3 vs. T-MET: 52.8 ± 1.4 kg) of the experiment did not differ statistically among treatments (p > 0.05); however, daily live weight changes tended to differ between groups (T-CTL: 73 ± 10 vs. T-MET: 51 ± 7 g day−1; p = 0.06). The birth weight (T-CTL: 3.1 ± 0.1 vs. T-MET: 3.5 ± 0.1 kg; p < 0.001), daily live weight change (T-CTL: 121 ± 6 vs. T-MET: 141 ± 6 g day−1; p < 0.01), and weaning weight (T-CTL: 8.3 ± 0.2 vs. T-MET: 9.3 ± 0.3 kg; p < 0.01) differed between treatments. The BMI at birth (T-CTL: 0.28 ± 0.01 vs. T-MET: 0.3 ± 0.01 units kg m−2; p < 0.01) and at weaning (T-CTL: 0.85 ± 0.1 kg vs. T-MET: 1.00 ± 0.06 units kg m−2; p < 0.05) differed between treatments. Milk components (protein, fat, lactose, and solids non-fat) and milk yield were similar between treatments (p > 0.05). It is concluded that the inclusion of methionine in the maternal goat diet during the last third of gestation increases the birth and growth variables of the progeny but without significant influence on the milk yield and composition.

The current study was undertaken to analyze the variation and pattern of plant species composition along a vertical gradient in northwestern Himalaya, India. A total of 18 sites were selected along an elevation gradient ranging from 2200 to 3900 m asl positioned at an interval of 100 m. The Renyi diversity profile, non-metric multidimensional scaling based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity metric and beta diversity components among the elevation belts were calculated. Furthermore, to study the influence of altitude on species richness and diversity, a generalized additive model was created. Two hundred and ten plant species representing 66 families and 147 genera were recorded. The Renyi diversity profiles show that the lower and mid-altitudes had rich species diversity. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis show a considerable variation in the total plant species composition among the studied elevation belts. The observed multiple-site Sorensen dissimilarity index across the studied elevation belts was very high. The contribution of species replacement or the turnover component to the observed dissimilarity was much higher than the nestedness component. Furthermore, the herbaceous and tree richness showed a significant decrease with increase in elevation; however, the richness of shrubs showed a bimodal pattern. The present study increases our understanding of the trends and patterns of species richness along the vertical gradient in the Himalayan region.

In addition to its well-known activities in promoting neuronal survival, neuron differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, neuronal BDNF also regulates energy homeostasis by modulating the hypothalamus’s hormonal signals. In the past decades, several peripheral tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue, were demonstrated as the active sources of BDNF synthesis in response to different metabolic challenges. Nevertheless, the functions of BDNF in these tissues remain obscure. With the use of tissue-specific Bdnf knockout animals and the availability of non-peptidyl BDNF mimetic, increasing evidence has reported that peripheral tissues-derived BDNF might play a significant role in maintaining systemic metabolism, possibly through the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in the various tissues. This article reviews the autocrine/paracrine/endocrine functions of BDNF in non-neuronal tissues and discusses the unresolved questions about BDNF’s function.
