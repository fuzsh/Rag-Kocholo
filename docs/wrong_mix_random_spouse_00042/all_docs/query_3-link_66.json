        "text": "3\n\nposted by phelpsfanatic2\n\nWhen a serious back injury sidelined Carmine Giovinazzo in college, his dreams of becoming a professional baseball player were put aside and he turned to acting. He appeared in short and independent films before getting his break in the pilot episode of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" His feature film credits include \"Black Hawk Down,\" \"The Red Zone,\" \"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,\" \"For Love of the Game,\" \"The Big Brass Ring\" and \"In Enemy Hands.\" His television credits include guest-starring roles in \"The Guardian\" and CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, both on CBS, as well as \"UC: Undercover\" and \"Providence.\" For the past few years, he has been writing a film for an ensemble cast titled \"The Brink of Black.\" Giovinazzo was born and raised in New York and lives in Los Angeles. His birth date is August 24.\n\ni got this from: link"
