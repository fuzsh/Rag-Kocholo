Although Napoleon never once set foot in Naples, during this brief decade southern Italy was a peripheral but also an integral part of the imperial system. Like the other territories ruled directly and indirectly by France, the Kingdom’s function was to supply men, equipment, and money for the emperor’s wars, raw materials for French manufactures, and markets for French products. However, because the French never succeeded in dislodging the former Bourbon rulers and their British allies from Sicily, the long coastlines of the southern Italian mainland formed the empire’s most southerly frontier and for almost ten years only the narrow Straits of Messina separated the emperor’s troops from those of France’s principal adversary.¹ Napoleon’s Mediterranean Kingdom also had an important part to play in the dynastic politics of empire. Its ﬁrst ruler was the emperor’s brother Joseph, until he was moved to Madrid in 1808 to ﬁll the recently vacated Spanish throne and succeeded by Napoleon’s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. The tensions with Paris that developed after Murat’s arrival in Naples would vividly expose the deep contradictions on which the imperial project was founded, and in 1811 Murat came very close to sharing the fate of Louis Bonaparte, who had been deposed as king of Holland a year earlier. Unlike Louis, Murat survived but the tensions remained, and in the hope of retaining his kingdom in 1814 Murat joined forces with the emperor’s enemies. A year later Murat rallied once again to the imperial cause after Napoleon’s ﬂight from Elba, but his defeat shortly afterwards by the Austrians at the battle of Tolentino in May 1815 brought the ‘Napoleonic episode’ in Italy to a ﬁnal close, although Murat’s personal denouement was still to come.² The history of Napoleon’s Mediterranean Kingdom illustrates many of the broader contradictions on which the short-lived imperial enterprise was ¹ ‘The southern end of the Italian peninsula was, in one sense, the strategic centre or turning point of the great war between France and England’: Johnson (1904) i., p. viii. However, that is more true for the period before rather than after 1806; see Mackesy (1957). ² For the ‘Napoleonic episode’ see Bergeron (1972). The principal modern biographers of Murat are Valente (1941/65) and Tulard (1983), but the most comprehensive modern historian of the period is Pasquale Villani (see Villani, ‘Il decennio francese’, in Galasso and Romeo (eds.) (1986), now reprinted in Rao and Villani (1995), 179–282).\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nfounded.³ But what has attracted attention above all to the brief interlude of French rule in southern Italy are the reforms that were undertaken. Within months of taking control, the new French rulers set about remodelling the Kingdom in accordance with the templates established by the revolution in France and its aftermath. Feudalism was abolished and the monarchy was reorganized around the system of central and local administration established by the Constitution of Year VIII in France. The tax system was similarly brought into line with France, and direct taxes were reorganized around a single land tax. The debts of the previous monarchy were redeemed through the sale of the lands of over 1,300 religious houses, the Code Napoléon was introduced and the administration of justice reorganized. In 1810 Joachim Murat established a feudal commission that visited every community in the Kingdom to resolve outstanding litigation over former feudal rights, and at the same time divided the former feudal and common lands amongst the inhabitants of the rural communities. Writing shortly after the event, Pietro Colletta claimed that ‘Never has society undergone political convulsions comparable to those experienced in the Kingdom of Naples at the start of the nineteenth century.’⁴ Allowing for a degree of exaggeration, it was nonetheless true that there was nothing comparable in the other territories ruled directly or indirectly by France to the reforms that took place in southern Italy. Yet for over a century, historians of modern Italy have argued that the failure of those reforms to take root in the South marked the decisive moment when the destinies of the two Italies—the North and the South—became ﬁnally and irrevocably set on different and divergent paths. While the rest of Italy embraced modernity and moved closer to the political and cultural models set by the most advanced western European nations, the South turned its back and limped into the nineteenth century still shackled to the ancien régime. These arguments were not made at the time, however, but much later in the closing decade of a century that had seen Italy achieve independence and nationhood. Yet, while the ﬁrst generation of Italian historians was hard at work celebrating Italy’s heroic struggles for independence and forging the founding myths of the new nation, the country faced a prolonged economic and political crisis that came close to overthrowing the fragile constitutional monarchy established barely three decades earlier. In addition to serious and widespread internal unrest that resulted in the military occupation of Sicily in 1893 and of the city of Milan in 1898, Italy also suffered a devastating and humiliating colonial defeat at the battle of Adowa in 1896 that came as a heavy psychological blow to the most ardent supporters of the new nation.⁵ ³ ‘[T]he very notion of Napoleon’s empire as a conceivable, potentially durable form of European international politics, or as a leading one, is a contradiction in terms’: Schroeder (1994), 394. ⁴ Colletta (Cortese, 1957), ii. 214. ⁵ On Italian insecurities, see Chabod (1962); the most thorough English account of the crisis of the 1890s is Duggan (2002), 640–7.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nIt was in this context of apprehension and introspection that the ‘Southern Problem’ forced itself on the attention of the new nation. There had been serious unrest in the South in the years immediately after Uniﬁcation, the scale of which the authorities attempted to minimize by dismissing the disturbances as mere acts of brigandage. However, more troops were needed to suppress the so-called brigandage, and more lives were lost than in all the Italian wars of independence.⁶ By the 1890s, although the epicentre of popular unrest had shifted to the North, the discontents of the South had exposed the desperate conditions of poverty and distress that persisted there thirty years after Uniﬁcation. The evident disparities between the two Italies were an open contradiction to claims that the Risorgimento had uniﬁed Italians, while the mass emigration that followed, as at ﬁrst thousands and then millions of southerners abandoned their homes in search of work and better lives across the Atlantic, raised even greater fears. Many of the new nation’s staunchest supporters saw in the mass exodus a haemorrhage of the nation’s life-blood that posed a mortal threat to its survival.⁷ Against these forebodings, ways had to be found to defend the Risorgimento, reassert national unity, and absolve the new Italy of responsibility for the conditions of the South. Not for the ﬁrst time history came to be written backwards, and the creative force of the Risorgimento was salvaged by insisting that the Southern Problem was primarily a legacy of the past. The principal architect of this interpretation was one of the most formidable intellectual champions of the Risorgimento, the Neapolitan philosopher and historian Benedetto Croce. A southerner himself, and deeply proud of his southern origins, Croce was among the ﬁrst to argue that centuries of foreign misrule and exploitation had turned the South into ‘a paradise inhabited by devils’.⁸ It was Croce who ﬁrst adopted and adapted the term ‘passive revolution’ to describe the South’s failure to respond to the innovative forces of the modern era. The phrase had originally been coined by Vincenzo Cuoco, a member of the Neapolitan Republic in 1799 who shortly afterwards became its ﬁrst historian, but it was only when Croce borrowed it a century later that the ‘passive revolution’ came to encapsulate everything that had made the pre-Uniﬁcation South different. For Croce, the deep moral decay of southern society was the reason the emancipating forces unleashed by the Enlightenment and the European revolutions had resulted in nothing more than a ‘passive revolution’ in the South. The forces of change had evoked strongly positive responses, but only from a progressive and isolated minority, which was why the reform movement that had ﬂourished in Naples in the second half of the eighteenth century failed to achieve signiﬁcant or lasting changes. However, for Croce nothing demonstrated more dramatically or tragically the backwardness ⁶ Davis (1988), 168–86; Riall (1997). ⁷ On perceptions of the South before and after Uniﬁcation see Dickie (1999) and Moe (2002). ⁸ Davis (1999), 350–7. On the origins of the ‘paradise inhabited by devils’ see Croce’s often misrepresented essay in Uomini e cose della vecchia Italia (1956), i. 69–87.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nand corruption of southern society than the fate of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. The Republic had been established following the defeat of the royal army in the winter of 1798, and after the king of Naples had unwisely yielded to pressure from his British allies to attack the small French garrison that had occupied Rome and set up a Republic there earlier in the year. The defeat of the Bourbon army and the ﬂight of the king and his courtiers to Sicily on Nelson’s men-o’-war, led to a French invasion and the declaration of a Republic in Naples in January 1799. The Neapolitan Republic had a very short life and like its sister republics elsewhere in Italy was left defenceless once the French Directory decided to withdraw its troops from the Italian peninsula in April. But when the Republic fell in June, the immediate agents of its destruction were Admiral Lord Nelson’s warships and the counter-revolutionary masses that rallied enthusiastically to the banners of the Holy Faith—the Santafede—raised by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo. Writing a century after the event, Croce transformed the rise and fall of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799 into one of the founding myths of the new Italian state. The young visionaries who had supported the Republic were portrayed as the ﬁrst martyrs of the new Italy, although Croce also argued that their lives had been sacriﬁced in a noble but hopeless cause. Although they had allowed themselves to be inﬂuenced too heavily by foreign political models, the cultural backwardness of the South meant that their lofty ideals could never have been realized. In any case the true voices of the South in 1799 were not theirs, but those of the ignorant and brutish masses who ﬂocked to the banners of the Santafede, urged on by a fanatical clergy and a corrupt ruling class. For Croce, the triumph of the counter-revolution in 1799 revealed why in the South the innovative and creative forces of the revolutionary era were destined to lead only to forms of ‘passive revolution’. When another French army invaded the South in 1806 to place Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Naples, the outcome would inevitably be the same. As a good Italian nationalist, Croce again refused to accept that reforms introduced by a foreign force of occupation could have any constructive force. In any case it was already too late; everything creative in the South had already been destroyed in the tragedy of the Republic. The reforms introduced by the French were bound to fail. They were based on alien models imposed from above and took little account of Neapolitan customs and culture. Above all they evoked no creative responses in a society that was irretrievably corrupted and incapable of achieving its own redemption.⁹ By demonstrating that the regeneration of the pre-Uniﬁcation South could not come from within, but only through the emancipating force of the liberal values and institutions of which the new Italy was the bearer, Croce brilliantly reconciled the backwardness of the South with the creative spirit of the Risorgimento.

The numerous studies published shortly after the turn of the new century to mark the centenary celebrations of France’s ﬁrst empire included a closely documented study of Joseph Bonaparte’s reforms in Naples by the distinguished French archivist Jacques Rambaud. In keeping with the spirit of the time, Rambaud portrayed Napoleon as a stern but wise schoolmaster who had brought the lessons of modernity to a continent still locked in the black night of the ancien régime. In this perspective, the Neapolitans inevitably ﬁgured as inattentive pupils who had been unwilling to learn from the models set by the Grande Nation, and Rambaud sadly concluded that there was no clearer warning of the fate that awaited those who failed to heed the empire’s civilizing mission than the sad state of southern Italy a century after the French had departed.¹¹ In the meantime, as the rapid industrialization of many parts of northern Italy further accentuated the relative backwardness of the South, Croce’s optimistic claim that the new Italy would solve the problems of the South was coming under increasingly critical scrutiny. For socialists, in particular, the backwardness of the South revealed not only the limits of national unity but was also the principal obstacle to the progress of democracy in Italy.¹² Once the crisis that followed the First World War had swept away Italy’s fragile constitutional monarchy and led to the establishment of the Fascist dictatorship, those arguments were taken up and developed by one of Mussolini’s most eminent victims, the communist leader Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci devoted his long and painful conﬁnement in Fascist jails to reworking Croce’s liberal master narrative of the Risorgimento in Marxist terms, and in what would later be known as the Prison Notebooks the struggles for Italian Uniﬁcation were portrayed instead as the victory of a narrow and deeply conservative ruling class that never fully acquired the qualities of a modern capitalist bourgeoisie. Following the lead given by earlier socialist observers like Gaetano Salvemini, Gramsci argued that the backwardness of the South was the rock on which the democratic aspirations of the Risorgimento had foundered. At this point Gramsci also invoked Vincenzo Cuoco’s ‘passive revolution’, although unlike Croce he acknowledged that the abolition of feudalism at the beginning of the nineteenth century had brought important changes in the South, most notably the wholesale expropriation of the southern peasantry who lost the ¹⁰ See Davis (1999), 350–7. ¹¹ ‘Educateurs sévères et peu modérés sur le prix de leurs lecons, les Français n’ont pas trouvé l’affection de leurs élèves: c’est le sort des “professeurs d’energie”.

However, Gramsci insisted that the French reforms had failed to create a new capitalist landowning class, leading instead to a ‘passive revolution’ that both anticipated and determined Italy’s later ‘missing bourgeois revolution’. Just as the backward and reactionary South had blocked the democratic forces of the Risorgimento, once Uniﬁcation had been achieved the backward South and its reactionary landowners remained the principal obstacles to the political development of the new Italian state.¹³ When Gramsci’s prison writings were published posthumously after the fall of Mussolini’s regime they ensured that the South would hold a central place in the debates on the historical roots of Fascism that followed. But the South was already at the centre of Italy’s new political agendas. The southern regions had borne the brunt of the interwar Depression and the Fascist regime’s economic and colonial policies, and following the invasion of Sicily in 1943 had for two years been subject to military operations and Allied occupation. The damage to the economy and the sufferings of the civilian population were as terrible as anywhere in Europe, and lay behind the social unrest and political protests that continued well after the end of the Second World War. Among the political parties that founded Italy’s new democratic Republic in 1947 there was broad agreement that the need to ﬁnd a solution to the ‘Southern Problem’ was one of the most pressing challenges for Italy’s reborn democracy.¹⁴ However, those concerns were also shared outside Italy, and as fears grew that the discontents of the southern population might give rise to communist inﬁltration the South ceased to be simply an Italian problem, and the Italian Mezzogiorno was to be the theatre for the biggest internationally funded rural development programme in post-Second World War Europe. Economists, anthropologists, and sociologists came from all over the world, but mainly from the United States, to test the latest development theories and turn the South into the foremost site of pre-modernity in contemporary Europe.¹⁵ Meanwhile, the South was acquiring notoriety through other channels, ﬁrst literature and then cinema. The South was the leading protagonist in both of Italy’s post-war international best-selling novels—Carlo Levi’s Christ Stopped at Eboli and Tomasi di Lampedusa’s The Leopard. In both the South was portrayed as a world that had somehow remained outside history and resisted the encroaching forces of modernity. Through cinema and television those images reached even wider international audiences and turned the South into a universally recognizable metaphor of pre-modernity.¹⁶ ¹³ See especially ‘Alcuni temi della quistione meridionale’ (ed. De Felice and Parlato, 1966), 121–60, but also Fubini (ed.) (1959) and Hoare and Nowell Smith (1971). ¹⁴ Allum (1973), Tarrow (1973). ¹⁵ D’Antone (ed.) (1996). ¹⁶ While there are now a number of studies on earlier stereotyping of the South (e.g. Dickie, 1999; Moe, 2003), much less has been written about contemporary perceptions of the South. For the South in contemporary Italian literature, however, see Dombroski in Schneider (ed.) (1998) 261–76.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nAs those metaphors have become more universal they have inevitably also moved further and further from both present and past realities, while more recent research has begun to question many of the fundamental assumptions on which they are premised. Quite apart from the sheer improbability that a chunk of premodern Europe might miraculously survive unchanged down to the present, the images of backwardness and immobility are of little help in explaining why the South is still in many respects a problem today. The rural world that constituted the ‘Southern Problem’ after the Second World War has long since vanished. Living standards in the South today are around the national norms, while levels of consumption are comparable to those in the wealthiest parts of Europe. Yet levels of productivity in southern Italy also remain among the lowest in Europe, economic and social infrastructures are poor, and organized crime, maﬁa, and political corruption persist.¹⁷ The problems present in the South today seem, however, to be more directly the consequence of the ways in which the southern regions have been incorporated into the modern Italian state than that of some vague and in any case immeasurable notion of ‘backwardness’.¹⁸ Rethinking what makes the South different today raises questions about the past, and above all about the ideological models that have reduced Italian history to a simple Manichean struggle between modernity and backwardness embodied by the North and the South. That dichotomy is based on nineteenth-century notions about state building and progress that can only appear outdated at a time when historians are more ready to acknowledge both the inherently contradictory forces of modernity and the persistence of the Old Order in even the most advanced of the nineteenth-century states.¹⁹ But these dichotomies also derive from abstract and often deeply ahistorical generalizations that ﬁt the North no better than the South, and take little if any account of the deep economic, political, cultural, and historical diversities that feature no less prominently in the North than in the South. Even in geographical terms the boundaries that separate the North from the South remain elusive.²⁰ Although outdated these dichotomies continue to colour the ways in which Italy’s political and social histories in the age of the Risorgimento and since are portrayed.²¹ It is the central contention of this book, however, that the neat ¹⁷ See Bevilacqua (1994), Lumley and Morris (eds.)

Its destiny— monarchy, republic, anarchy, despotism—could well be taken from the pages of the Esprit des Lois.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ncontrasts between a modernizing North and a backward South are anachronisms that have subsequently come to distort the history of the North before Uniﬁcation no less seriously than that of the South. A reconsideration of what made the South different before Uniﬁcation therefore calls for a more general reconsideration of the dynamics of political change in Italy as a whole in the century before Uniﬁcation. This book began as a study of the brief period of Napoleonic rule at the start of the nineteenth century that was supposedly the site of the original ‘passive revolution’. In the light of modern scholarship on the Napoleonic enterprise, however, both the notion of the ‘passive revolution’ and that of the exceptionality of the South in the century before Uniﬁcation become questionable. Seen in the broader context of Napoleonic Europe, southern Italy was not the norm but an anomaly. No comparable reforms were attempted in any of the other peripheral imperial territories. In Poland, for example, even the political privileges of the nobility survived, and despite the abolition of feudalism the seigneurial order was not touched in the German territories. The reasons for this seemed obvious enough to Count Beugnot, one of the empire’s most seasoned administrators, who reported that feudalism was so deeply embedded in the fabric of the countries that made up the Kingdom of Westphalia that to eradicate it would take decades, perhaps even centuries: ‘one would have to go back four or ﬁve centuries to ﬁnd similar examples in France’.²² But even in those states that were closer to France in terms of political and institutional organization, recent studies show that the reforming zeal of the French administrators has often been exaggerated. Despite the emperor’s obsessive insistence, attempts to implement key reforms—for example, the introduction of the Code Napoléon—were generally minimalist, and very often it was the local elites who took the initiative to rewrite imperial prescriptions to suit their own political agendas.²³ Why, then, the attempt to make Naples a model of the empire’s modernizing mission? Once that question is posed, the weakness of the claim that everything was imposed from above becomes evident. There was nothing in the career proﬁles of either Joseph Bonaparte or Joachim Murat to indicate an active commitment to reform. To be sure, the men Napoleon sent to advise his brother were ‘experts in the business of annexation’.²⁴ All were seasoned administrators who were also deeply skilled in the more sinister political arts, but all but one left with Joseph in 1808. Thereafter, Murat relied more heavily on Neapolitan administrators, but although their roles were important, their presence and collaboration alone are not sufﬁcient to explain either the momentum of change or the very varied responses to change. But it was dramatic history’. An even more extreme version of the Manichaean view of the historical origins of the North–South divide can be found in Putnam (1994). ²² Woolf (1991), 52. ²³ Fahrmeir, in Rowe (ed.) (2003), 107–20. ²⁴ Woolf (1991), 50.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nTo a far greater extent than historians have been prepared to acknowledge, the changes that took place in southern Italy after 1806 were driven and shaped from below. In part, the scale of the French reforms reﬂected the gravity of the crisis of the ancien régime monarchy in the South, which confronted the French invaders with challenges that could not safely be deferred. Public ﬁnances were on the point of collapse and the creditors of the ancien régime monarchy were threatened with ruin. There was no cash in the government treasuries and taxes were not being raised. Public administration and the administration of justice were in chaos and needed to be completely reconstructed. From the moment that the French rulers set about these tasks, however, their initiatives were shaped by the interventions of different social groups and interests. To explain why, it is necessary to turn back to the earlier period of Bourbon reformism, which is where this book begins. The pursuit of dynastic autonomy led the Kingdom’s new Bourbon rulers to copy initiatives being taken by other Italian and European rulers in the same period. It was not the initiatives taken to strengthen the monarchy and its resources that made the South different, but the context in which these were attempted. As these questions carry us backwards in time into the eighteenth century, the images of an immobile and unchanging South begin to disintegrate and instead reveal a society, an economy, and a political system inseparably caught up in the changes that were everywhere beginning to undermine the fabric of the European ancien régime. The changes taking place in the South in the half century that preceded the revolution in France were often experienced in particularly intense and disruptive forms, but they differed in degree, not in kind, from those concurrently taking place elsewhere in Italy and Europe. The same was true of the political crisis that overwhelmed the Bourbon monarchy in the ﬁnal decade of the eighteenth century. In every Italian state, attempts by the rulers to establish more effective forms of centralized bureaucratic government created deep political divisions, gaining support in some quarters but provoking powerful resistance in others. While in some important respects distinctive, in substance the crisis in the South was rooted in the same contradictions and tensions that caused the Habsburg rulers of Tuscany and Lombardy to abandon reform and reverse measures already implemented.²⁵ In the South, those reactions were particularly polarized, but were not essentially different, nor did the crisis of the ancient régime monarchy in the South follow lines essentially different from those of other Italian states. In reality the South in 1799 never quite lived up to its later notoriety as the home of the Italian counter-revolution. The savagery of the Neapolitan Sanfedists was not invented and quickly acquired a notoriety that haunted successive generations ²⁵ For the economic forces that were transforming the European ancien régime, see Aymard (1978).

But the carefully contrived retrospective reconstructions of the fate of the Neapolitan Republic deliberately failed to acknowledge that in 1799 Italy as a whole was the theatre for a second Vendée, or that the Neapolitan Republic was in all essential respects remarkably similar to its sister republics in the rest of Italy. The exceptionality of the South has been heavily overstated, but what is missing most crucially from the imagery of the ‘passive revolution’ are the quite exceptional forms of political mobilization taking place in many different parts of the South by the end of the eighteenth century. These found expression in the political battles that followed the founding of the Republic, but they can also be traced to the earlier campaigns against feudalism. There were many reasons for this, not least being the monarchy’s efforts to recruit the local communities to its campaign against feudal privilege. The actions of the royal courts, together with the presence of the masonic lodges that with government support spread to the most remote provincial centres in the closing decade, all contributed to generate forms of political mobilization that had no parallels elsewhere in Italy. As a result, local conﬂicts in the South were drawn into broader political and juridical struggles whose vocabularies they assimilated. This would be evident in the struggles that followed the founding of the Republic in 1799, and again during the short period of French rule. As in the rest of Italy, French rule in the South met with ﬁerce opposition as well as active support and collaboration. Like the other Italian states, the South paid heavy sacriﬁces to the imperial cause in terms not only of lives and tributes, but also of persistent danger and disorder. The Kingdom was permanently at risk of attack and invasion, while the escalation of brigandage was a direct consequence not only of conscription and economic hardship but also of the massive volume of contraband goods that ﬂooded into southern Italy as a direct result of the emperor’s Continental blockade. Murat’s own insecurity in the imperial enterprise and the Kingdom’s vulnerable position on the frontier of empire created important political opportunities that the southern elites did not let pass, and in particular gave rise to demands for constitutional government that found wide support in southern Italy during the ﬁnal years of French rule. The breadth of support for the constitutional project is not easily reconciled with the later imagery of the ‘passive revolution’, and suggests that the South had embarked on a path of political development that was not so much different but in some respects precocious in comparison with the other Italian states. Those differences were also evident in 1815 when the restored Bourbon rulers retained the administrative and institutional changes made by their French predecessors more fully than any other Italian rulers. Indeed, in 1816 these were extended to Sicily as well, which as a result lost its centuries-old autonomy as a separate crown. The consolidation of a post-feudal bureaucratic autocracy gave new impetus to the demands for constitutional government, which found expression in the revolutions of 1820–1 on the mainland and in Sicily.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nThe nine months of constitutional government and freedom of speech that followed demonstrate how profoundly the retrospective lens of the ‘passive revolution’ has distorted the histories of both the North and the South before Uniﬁcation. The revolutions of 1820–1 in the South were the epilogue to the decade of French reforms, and the debates that took place in the local and regional assemblies and in the petitions submitted to the National Parliament focused above all on the threats that the centralist and autocratic reorganization of the state posed to regional and local autonomies. Although those debates took place only in the South in 1820–1, similar developments were taking place in every other Italian state. Everywhere the post-feudal order was founded on the expansion and extension of centralized power at the expense of local autonomies, and especially the powers formerly exercised at local levels by sections of the elites. Everywhere in Italy these tendencies were the principal cause of political tension in the Restoration states, and everywhere opposition to the new forms of centralized autocracy came as much from the old patrician families who were the principal victims of the new forms of autocratic power as from the elites of more recent origin.²⁶ The difference was that in the South these changes had come earlier and more abruptly. This was partly because of the scale of the crisis of the ancien régime monarchy and partly because of the ways in which forms of agrarian paternalism and deference that in other parts of Italy would survive until much later in the century were eroded at a much earlier stage. In March 1821 the precocious political dialogue in the South was abruptly cut off by the Austrian invasion, which was also a reminder that political developments in pre-Uniﬁcation Italy were determined as much by realities of imperial subordination as by the force of revolution. The South was not unique in this respect either: all the Italian rulers, even the House of Savoy, were dependent on direct or indirect foreign support. But again the consequences were especially acute in the South, where the Bourbon dreams of dynastic autonomy had been amongst the ﬁrst victims of the revolutionary wars. In 1815 the South passed from formal imperial subjection to France and informal colonial subordination to Great Britain to become a satellite of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1821 Habsburg bayonets enabled the Bourbon rulers to regain their throne, but the realities of colonial subordination caused the monarchy to make a bid for autonomy by promoting the Kingdom’s economy and protecting its nascent industrial centres. That bid ended in conﬂict with Great Britain and failure, but even though the Bourbon bid for economic autonomy was motivated exclusively by dynastic objectives it anticipated the policies that would be adopted by the rulers of the Kingdom of Piedmont–Savoy two decades later. Retrospectively, Italians wrote the history of Uniﬁcation around the idea of the nation and nationalism, so it is easy to forget the other forces that made the ²⁶ On the importance of patrician discontent as a factor in opposition to Habsburg rule in Lombardy see Meriggi (1983, 1987), and on Tuscany see the important recent study by Thomas Kroll (2005).\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nsurvival of independent dynastic states on the Italian peninsula increasingly difﬁcult. Even the most powerful, the Kingdom of Piedmont–Sardinia, survived the crisis by ceasing to be a regional dynastic state. The forces that brought about the collapse of the Bourbon monarchy in the South were essentially the same as those that undid the other Italian rulers. The retrospective contrasts between a modernizing North and a backward South have not only imposed differences that did not exist, but also obscured those that did. The Napoleonic decade was a critical moment in the history of the Italian South, as it was in the histories of the Italian peninsula and of Europe. However, it was not the decisive turning point that subsequently came to dominate the master narratives of Italian history. The political and social changes taking place in the South in the half century before Italian Uniﬁcation mirrored, and in many cases even anticipated, those occurring in other parts of Italy. Everywhere in Italy those changes brought new insecurities, even though in the South the impact of these changes would prove to be especially disruptive. Two ﬁnal points: throughout this Introduction and in the pages that follow the South refers to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in other words the southern mainland and Sicily. But although Sicily has a critical role in different parts of the narrative that this book seeks to unfold, it is not treated in as much detail as the mainland or as it deserves. The reasons for this are essentially practical. Sicily and the mainland were different countries, with different institutions, laws, and customs. To have written as fully about Sicily as the mainland provinces would have required extensive additional archival research that would have made a long book even longer, but this inevitably results in imbalances of which I am very much aware. Secondly, anyone writing about this period must be enormously indebted to the remarkable expansion in historical research and debate on the pre-Uniﬁcation South in recent decades. Some of the breadth of that research will be evident from the bibliographies that follow, without which this study could not have been attempted. Since overwhelmingly this is the work of Italian historians, which is not easily accessible to those who do not read Italian, it is important to remind anglophone readers that far from travelling some distant or exotic terre incognitae the chapters that follow move across some of the most deeply researched and closely debated territories in modern Italian history.\n\nPART I ABSOLUTIST NAPLES\n\nItaly in 1748, from G. Holmes (ed.), The Oxford Illustrated History of Italy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997).\n\n1 The Ancien Régime in the South INTRODUCTION: HOW THE EUROPEAN REVOLUTION CAME SOUTH Sir William Hamilton, who from 1763 served for thirty-six years as Britain’s special envoy to the rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, liked to describe his posting as a ‘remote and indolent corner of the world’. In the closing years of the century, however, this remote corner of the world found itself at the centre of the political storms that swept through Europe in the wake of the revolution in France.¹ In part this was because the central and eastern Mediterranean had in the intervening decades come to acquire new importance in European politics. Trade between the Mediterranean countries and northern Europe had increased notably in these years, but the region’s new strategic importance derived above all from the colonial struggles between Britain and France that after the American War of Independence had shifted to the Indian subcontinent. In the meantime, the expansionist projects of Tsarist Russia had led to a sequence of conﬂicts with the Ottoman Turks that culminated in the Russian annexation of the Crimea in 1783 and a major war begun in 1787 and fought by the Russians and the Austrians against the Turks. These conﬂicts were a new cause of political uncertainty for the whole of south-eastern Europe and for the states that bordered on the Adriatic and the eastern Mediterranean. Those broader connections would become apparent when Napoleon Bonaparte’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 threw southern Italy into crisis. The expedition’s aim was to cut England’s lines of communications with India, a project that was wrecked by Nelson’s victory at the battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. The wider signiﬁcance of Nelson’s victory was evident not only from the baronetcy and the acclaim won by the British admiral, but also from the handsome cash bounty he received from the grateful governors of the East India Company.² Naples and its rulers were less fortunate. After his victory, the hero of the Nile headed for Naples to repair his ships, recover from his wounds, and become ¹ Sir William served as the British envoy in Naples until 1799; see Constantine (2001) and Fothergill (1969). ² Vincent (2003), 272.\n\n16\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\ninfatuated with Sir William Hamilton’s young wife, Emma. The crisis of the Neapolitan monarchy quickly followed. The king of Naples, Ferdinand IV, had already been pressed into the coalition against France in 1793, and now he came under renewed pressure from Nelson, the Hamiltons, and the queen to launch an offensive against the French forces that had occupied Rome earlier in the year. The campaign was a disaster. The Neapolitan army was defeated and disintegrated; the king ﬂed and was carried on Nelson’s ships with his courtiers to the safety of Sicily. The mainland, in the meantime, was invaded by a French army and in January 1799 a republican government was proclaimed in Naples. In June the monarchy was restored, thanks to Nelson’s ships and a popular royalist insurrection, aided and directed by Russian and Turkish troops. The presence of the Russian, Albanian, and Turkish troops that joined the assault on the Republic and its French ally in 1799 was a clear sign of the broader dimensions of the conﬂict that momentarily converged on the central Mediterranean and the Italian peninsula. But only the particular constellation of powers and forces was new. Like the other Italian states southern Italy was used to living on the peripheries of empire and its destinies had always been shaped by the shifting alignments and counter-alignments of Europe’s power politics.³ The immediate cause of the crisis of the Neapolitan monarchy in 1799 was the renewal of war in Europe, but it was also driven by internal tensions and conﬂicts directly linked to the attempts by the Bourbon rulers to transform their kingdom into a viable dynastic state. Before it became an independent dynastic state in 1734, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had for two centuries been the eastern frontier of the Spanish empire and its ﬁrst line of defence against the Ottoman Turks.⁴ After a brief interlude of Austrian government the Kingdom acquired its autonomy with the accession of a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons. The Kingdom’s new rulers were now faced with the same challenges that confronted their counterparts throughout Europe. To secure their kingdom and their dynastic ambitions, the new rulers needed to improve its defences and strengthen its military forces. However, that required revenues and resources that the monarchy did not have and could only acquire by increasing its power and authority. That in turn meant diminishing the autonomous jurisdictions, the privileges, and monopolies exercised by the feudal nobility, by the Church, and by the self-governing corporations with which the ancien régime princes shared power.⁵ It was not the dynastic ambitions of the Neapolitan Bourbons that were unusual, but the scale of the obstacles to achieving them. The Kingdom was poor and weak. It had no effective army or navy, while the royal administration was limited. The Kingdom consisted of the separate crowns of Naples and Sicily that were joined only in the person of the ruler: both Kingdoms had their own laws, customs, institutions, and constitutions, and in both Naples and Sicily the privileged orders exercised independent jurisdictions, and enjoyed wide ﬁscal ³ See Galasso (1994).\n\n⁴ Ibid.\n\n⁵ Scott (ed.) (1990); Bonney (ed.) (1999).\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n17\n\nexemptions and many important exclusive rights. The monarchy’s jurisdictions were limited, and to make matters worse most of its revenues had been permanently disposed of by the Spanish rulers in the previous century. During the early years of Spanish rule the Kingdom’s ﬁnancial and administrative institutions had been extensively reorganized, but these constructive developments had been overthrown in the ﬁnancial crisis that overwhelmed the Spanish monarchy in the seventeenth century when the Kingdom’s principal assets and revenues were plundered to ﬁnance Spain’s European wars and pay its creditors. The beneﬁciaries were the privileged orders and corporations who exploited the needs and weaknesses of the Spanish monarchy to increase their privileges, powers, and exemptions, as well as hordes of small investors who purchased venal ofﬁces and shares in the tax farms put up for sale.⁶ By the start of the eighteenth century, therefore, both the degree to which power was decentralized in the South and the institutional weakness of the southern monarchy were indeed exceptional in comparison with the other major Italian principalities. Much of the Kingdom was ruled not by the royal courts, but by the feudal courts that answered to lay and ecclesiastical feudatories or to the tribunals that represented powerful corporate bodies like the city of Naples. The new rulers nonetheless tried to follow the lead set by other European princes to acquire the revenues without which neither the trappings nor the substance of dynastic autonomy could be attained. As the king’s chief minister, Bernardo Tanucci, put it: ‘Principini, ville e casini: Principoni armate e cannoni.’⁷ The Bourbon rulers of Naples wanted big palaces, big guns, big armies, and big ships, too. Yet none of these could be achieved without reducing the ﬁscal exemptions, autonomous jurisdiction, and power sharing on which the whole political ediﬁce of the ancien régime in the South was founded. That meant conﬂict with the most powerful interests in the Kingdom: the privileged orders, the Church, and the great self-governing corporations. Similar dramas were being played out in absolutist states throughout Europe, and although from state to state the balances between the different forces varied, everywhere the Old Order resisted. As in the rest of Europe, the dynastic projects of the Bourbon rulers were also played out against a backdrop of changes that were undermining the economic as well as the political foundations of the European ancien régime. Even though the origins of these changes were often distant, they nonetheless had far-reaching consequences throughout the European peripheries, including the Italian peninsula. One of the most tangible signs of the changes that were the source of new wealth and a new capacity for consumption could be seen in the growing numbers of curious foreign travellers who tramped the itineraries ⁶ The tax farms were known as arrendamenti, from the Spanish word arrendar (‘to yield’). See De Rosa (1958/2005) and Calabria (1991). ⁷ ‘Little princes need little palaces and little villas: big princes need big armies and big guns.’ Simioni (1925), 40.\n\n18\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\nof the Grand Tour. Many began to ﬁnd their way to Naples, where they might well have been entertained by Sir William Hamilton, who even wrote to London to express his concern over the amounts of money they spent.⁸ These wealthy travellers were living testimony of the consumer revolutions taking place by the mid-century elsewhere in Europe.⁹ They did not bring these revolutions to Italy, but the growing numbers of foreign merchant ships beginning to visit the Mediterranean ports revealed how economic expansion in other parts of Europe was already giving rise to new demand for goods that the Mediterranean economies produced in plenty, in particular grain, olive oil, silk, wool, and citrus fruits. Especially during the years of the long European peace that preceded the revolutionary wars, British and French merchants and shipping were only the most prominent among those visiting the ports of the Mediterranean and the Levant. Exports grew at quite a modest pace, but enough to cause commodity prices to rise and generate powerful new incentives for increasing agricultural output.¹⁰ The consequences were deeply contradictory. Except in the fertile Po valley and the irrigated lower Milanese plain that won the admiration of the English agronomist Arthur Young at the end of the century, in most parts of Italy farming was geared mainly to subsistence needs and access to more distant markets was limited.¹¹ In most cases, agricultural production could be increased only by bringing more land under cultivation. But everywhere land was a scarce and inelastic resource. In part, geography and climate were the reasons for this since much of the Italian peninsula is dominated by the chain of the Apennine Mountains that runs from the Alps to Sicily. Outside the Po valley, good irrigated farmland was hard to ﬁnd, and many of the principal cereal-growing regions—such as the Apulian plateau known as the Tavoliere or the hinterlands of central Sicily— suffered from lack of irrigation and severely inadequate rainfall, which resulted in thin and infertile topsoils that required extended periods of fallow and grazing between crops. There were also pockets of more fertile land, of course, which in the South were often found close to the main cities—the Neapolitan Campagna Felix, the Terra di Bari, and the area around Reggio Calabria: in Sicily, Palermo’s fabled Conca d’Oro and the areas surrounding Messina, Catania, Siracusa, and Noto. However, over the centuries soil erosion had also turned vast areas of previously fertile farm land into malaria-infested and uninhabitable swamps, a problem aggravated by the clearance of woodland from the lower upland slopes that caused thin topsoils to be washed from the hillsides by spring rains. As demand for wheat and other cashcrops grew, woodland clearances were already assuming a scale in many parts of southern Italy that seriously alarmed contemporaries.¹² ⁸ Acton (1965), 169. ⁹ De Seta (1996). ¹⁰ Caracciolo (1973); Chorley (1965); Romano (1951). ¹¹ See Cafagna (1962).

In eighteenth-century Europe feudalism took many different forms. While serfdom survived only in the East, in many parts of western Europe feudatories no longer exercised independent jurisdictions, although they did enjoy important ﬁscal and political privileges. In Italy, the meaning of feudal titles and the scale of feudal property varied not only from state to state, but also within states. In the Tuscan Grand Duchy it was unknown, but remained extensive in Piedmont and Lombardy, although in both cases the ﬁscal and political privileges of the feudatories had in most cases been heavily curtailed.¹³ In the South by no means was all land held in feudal tenure, but feudal property was nonetheless more extensive than in any other part of Italy or indeed western Europe. In most parts of the Kingdom, feudal courts were responsible for the dayto-day administration of justice and the maintenance of order. Feudal landowners were entitled to raise levies over the local communities subject to their feudal jurisdiction. These rights and levies were countered, without being balanced, by the numerous collective use-rights that the local communities exercised on feudal land as well as on the extensive common lands that constituted one of the principal resources of the rural poor. These included the right to pasture animals at certain times of year, to fell timber for fuel and building, to glean after the harvest, to gather chestnuts, to hunt for game in the woodlands, or to ﬁsh in the ponds and swamps. Unlike private property, the ownership of feudal land was therefore strictly conditional and the land remained subject to multiple uses and rights.¹⁴ As unprecedented rates of demographic expansion caused demand for land to increase during the course of the eighteenth century, the constraints imposed by feudal obligations and collective use-rights became more visible and vexatious, and the title by which both were exercised began to be challenged. As these rights became more contentious, so did all forms of property rights, giving rise not only to growing confusion but also to conﬂict. In response to rising commodity prices and land rents, the feudal landowners were often the ﬁrst to violate feudal regulations by creating illegal enclosures, denying the local communities their collective use-rights, or occupying sections of the common lands. Given the inelastic supply of land, these actions threatened the livelihood of the rural communities, whose survival depended on their customary and seasonal use-rights on feudal land and access to common land. The assault on these collective rights triggered reactions similar to those that brought market forces and the moral economies of the rural communities into conﬂict in eighteenth-century England.¹⁵ In many parts of southern Italy these developments gave rise to conﬂicts not only between rural communities and neighbouring lay and ecclesiastical feudatories, but also between neighbouring villages. The situation was further ¹³ Villari (1961). ¹⁴ Villani (1974); Villari (1961). ¹⁵ On the ways in which rising prices and population growth caused the relative value of feudal revenues to decline, see Aymard (1978), 1155–69, Thompson (1994).\n\n20\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\ncomplicated by the prevalence of transhumant grazing along most of the Apennine chain in central and southern Italy. Every spring and autumn, millions of sheep made their way back and forth between upland summer pastures and winter grazing on the coastal plains. For these seasonal migrations to take place, the ﬂocks enjoyed rights of passage across private and public land that had been protected by law since the ﬁfteenth century. However, as enclosures spread, as more land came under the plough and as woodland was cleared, the transit routes were threatened, which created other potentially dangerous conﬂicts. Powerful interests were at stake, and it was no accident that brigandage and the transhumant economy were closely linked since many of the larger ﬂocks were owned by powerful landowners who did not hesitate to employ armed retainers to defend their property and their rights.¹⁶ Changes being felt throughout all the agrarian economies of the Italian peninsula, therefore, were often experienced in particularly dramatic and disruptive form in the South. Not all parts of southern Italy and Sicily were affected in equal ways, or indeed even at the same time. However, the fragility of the southern economies, the delicate balances between scant resources and the needs and interests of different sections of the population, made change not only difﬁcult, but also ensured that it could rarely be achieved gradually. As a result, the forces of change often gave rise to conﬂicts that challenged the foundations of the agrarian order and undermined the forms of agrarian paternalism and deference that in other parts of Italy would survive until much later. Unwittingly, the monarchy’s campaign against feudalism in the South served to exacerbate these conﬂicts. Throughout Europe, more or less enlightened attempts by the rulers to reduce feudal privileges and give more freedom to market forces gave rise to varied forms of popular resistance, which in many cases caused these initiatives to be abandoned. This was the case both in Austria and in Lombardy, where in the ﬁnal decade of the eighteenth century many of Joseph II’s earlier reforms were abandoned or even reversed. The same happened even in the proverbially tranquil Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where at the end of the century popular resistance also caused many of the liberal reforms introduced by Grand Duke Peter Leopold to be abandoned.¹⁷ In southern Italy, however, the impact of the monarchy’s campaign against feudalism was different. Because the monarchy had no bureaucracy of its own, it relied primarily on the royal courts and tribunals to challenge and check feudal privileges. For that reason, the crown’s agents actively encouraged local communities to bring legal suits against powerful feudal neighbours. Ironically, these attempts to use feudal law—as opposed to more arbitrary and absolutist measures—to combat feudal abuses brought the campaign against feudalism to ¹⁶ See esp. Villari (1961), 14–58; Marino (1988), 255–9; Russo (2002). ¹⁷ On the Habsburg territories see Capra (2005) 218–33; on Tuscany, Cochrane (1973), Lichﬁeld (1986), and Turi (1969/99).\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n21\n\nthe most distant towns and villages of the Kingdom and played an important part in escalating local conﬂicts that neither the crown nor the courts had the means to resolve.¹⁸ The monarchy’s campaign against feudalism in the South therefore also played a critical part in undermining local systems of power and authority. The projects and ideas of the reformers played a part in this, too, of course, and especially as their projects began to be debated in the provinces, thanks mainly to the rapid increase in masonic lodges, whose numbers multiplied in the last decades of the century, often with the open support of the government.¹⁹ Well before the revolution of 1789 and the crisis of the Neapolitan monarchy, there were clear signs that the European revolutions had found their way to the South by many different paths. By the closing years of the century these gentlemanly debates were taking place against a noisier background of conﬂicts in which the voices of the rural poor could also be clearly heard. The South was not a world locked into some timeless past, where every attempt at change met with resistance and failure. In every aspect of political, social, economic, and social life, the prevailing idiom had become change, often radical and deeply disruptive change. Indeed, it was the deeply disruptive impact of change on the fragile foundations of southern society that explains why the crisis of the ancien régime monarchy at the end of the century opened the way to a broader crisis of social as well as political institutions. The crisis that affected the Italian ancien régimes as a whole came in the South to take forms that were also distinctive.\n\nSEEKING SECURIT Y Before they could change their Kingdom, its new rulers ﬁrst had to secure it. From 1504 to 1707 the crowns of Naples and Sicily had been possessions of the Spanish monarchy, ruled by Spanish viceroys whose courts were respectively in Naples and Palermo. The independent dynastic state that came into being in 1734 was a direct consequence of the decline of Spanish power, and speciﬁcally of the War for the Spanish Succession that followed the death of the last Spanish Habsburg emperor, Charles II, in 1700.²⁰ The conﬂicts lasted nearly half a century and focused on Spain’s possessions in Italy, which as well as Naples and Sicily included Milan and Sardinia. First the Spanish were driven out of southern Italy by the Austrians, who in 1707 placed ¹⁸ See especially Rao (2002), 63–113, and Rao (2005), 142–67. Sicily was different: see Chapter 3. ¹⁹ Giarrizzo (1995), 406–20. See also Ferrone (1982/1995, 1989/2000); Chiosi (1986, 1992). ²⁰ The result was not one but three wars, which started when Louis XIV of France declared his grandson, the Duke of Anjou, successor to the Spanish crown (the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–14)), followed by the War of the Polish Succession (1733–8), and ﬁnally the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–8).\n\n22\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\na Habsburg Archduke on the throne of Naples.²¹ The Austrians occupied Sicily in 1720 and held the South until the War of the Polish Succession, when Bourbons once again regained the upper hand. In 1733 it was agreed that the son of King Philip V of Spain, the Spanish Infante Don Carlos who had inherited from his mother the title of Duke of Parma, should become the ruler of what would be an independent kingdom of Naples and Sicily.²² In 1734 a Spanish army retook Sicily and Naples; Philip V renounced his own claims in favour of Don Carlos, who became king. The Habsburg emperor Charles VI grudgingly agreed and in return the Bourbons acknowledged Habsburg claims to Milan, the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza, and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. They also pledged that the thrones of Sicily and Naples should never revert to the Spanish monarchy.²³ The ﬁrst priority for Charles of Bourbon²⁴ was to secure the safety of his Kingdom. Spain was too weak to offer effective protection, and for two centuries the Kingdom had relied on Spanish armies and navies for its defence. As a result the Kingdom had only a small army and no navy, even though its extensive coastline was exposed to attack by other European powers and by Barbary corsairs that marauded on the Kingdom’s merchant shipping and ﬁshing vessels. The crumbling watch towers that remain to this day had been built to warn inhabitants of the coastal settlements of impending raids, whose principal aim was to capture prisoners to be sold as slaves in North Africa.²⁵ The new Kingdom had more powerful enemies, however. Austria remained hostile, as did Great Britain. When Spain and France went to war over the Austrian Succession in 1740, the new Austrian empress Maria Theresa worked hard to foment opposition to the new dynasty amongst the Neapolitan and Sicilian nobles, many of whom remained strongly pro-Austrian. But when Naples remained stubbornly neutral, Commodore Martin led a British naval squadron into the Bay of Naples on 18 August 1742 and threatened to bombard the city unless the Bourbon rulers joined the coalition against France.²⁶ The pro-Austrian revolt by the nobles never materialized, however, and two years later at the battle of Velletri the king of Naples got the better of an Austrian army that had been sent to depose him.²⁷ ²¹ In 1713 Spain lost Sicily, which under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht passed to the Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, whose family ﬁnally acquired an ardently coveted royal title. When the Austrians occupied Sicily in 1720 the Piedmontese rulers had to make do with the less desirable island of Sardinia, which nonetheless still carried a royal title that the rulers of the House of Savoy kept until they became kings of Italy in 1861. ²² To win the support of Philip V of Spain, the French monarchy offered to drop its claims to the Medici and Farnese inheritance in Italy: this was the inheritance of Philip’s wife, Elizabeth Farnese, the last surviving descendant of the two great families that had dominated central Italy since the sixteenth century; see Lynch (1989), 137–41. ²³ At the Peace of Vienna 1735, which was reconﬁrmed in 1738. ²⁴ Don Carlos took the titles Charles VII in Naples and Charles III in Sicily; however, he is always referred to by the title he assumed upon becoming king of Spain in 1759: Charles III. ²⁵ See Colley (2002). ²⁶ This was the ﬁrst of four threats by the British navy to bombard Naples in the century that followed: the threats were repeated in 1799, 1815, and 1840. ²⁷ Treaty of Fontainebleau, 25 October 1743: see Barra (no date), 4–6.\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n23\n\nCommodore Martin’s visitation exposed the Kingdom’s extreme military and naval vulnerability, and it was only when the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 brought the War of the Austrian Succession to an end that the Bourbon monarchy in the South could ﬁnally enjoy some degree of security. This enabled Charles to turn his attention to reorganizing his Kingdom and building palaces, but his days in Naples were numbered. Following the death of his hopelessly insane halfbrother, he inherited the throne of Spain and took his leave for Madrid in 1759.²⁸ Since his own eldest son was also mad, his second son took the title of Infante of Spain, while the crowns of Naples and Sicily went to his eight-year-old third son, whose own mind was far from stable. The boy-king took the titles of Ferdinand IV of Naples and Ferdinand III of Sicily,²⁹ and until he came of age in 1767 the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council headed by Bernardo Tanucci, the Tuscan lawyer who served as principal minister throughout Charles’s time in Naples.³⁰ Charles’s departure to Spain occurred in the middle of the Seven Years War (1756–63), the bloodiest and most costly of Europe’s eighteenth-century conﬂicts that nonetheless ﬁnally caused France and Austria to become allies. That alliance brought western Europe the relatively long period of peace that lasted until 1792 that was the background for the numerous experiments in absolutist reform and the intellectual debates of the Enlightenment.³¹ It also saw Naples leave the diplomatic protection of Madrid to enter the orbit of Habsburg Vienna, a diplomatic shift that was consummated in 1768 when Ferdinand of Naples married the sixteen-year-old daughter of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, the Archduchess Maria Carolina.³² The Neapolitan marriage marked an important extension of Habsburg inﬂuence in Italy. Maria Carolina’s bother, the emperor Joseph II, escorted her on her nuptial journey to Naples. Another brother, Peter Leopold, was Grand Duke of Tuscany, while her sister Maria Amalia was married to the Duke of Parma, Don Felipe of Bourbon, who was the ﬁrst cousin of the king of Naples.³³ After giving birth to her ﬁrst male child in 1776, the young queen exercised her right to become a member of the Council of State and within a year had engineered Tanucci’s downfall. Tanucci’s fall after forty-four years in government marked the defeat of the ‘proSpanish’ party in Naples, and the queen quickly set about constructing her own party while the king spent most of his time hunting.³⁴ The young queen’s aim was ²⁸ Philip V died in 1746 and was succeeded by Charles’s half-brother, who ruled as Ferdinand VI until his death in 1759 at the age of forty-six without heirs. ²⁹ He is generally known by the Neapolitan title, until the Act of Union in 1816 when he became Ferdinand I. ³⁰ Bernardo Tanucci (1698–1793). ³¹ Schroeder (1994), 3–52. ³² Maria Carolina (1752–1814) bore Ferdinand 17 children. ³³ Another sister, Maria Cristina, was governor of the Low Countries, while in 1770 yet another sister, Marie Antoinette, would of course marry the future Louis XVI and in 1774 become the queen of France: Dumas (1864), i. 190. ³⁴ In 1787 Goethe commented, ‘Naples itself appears to be happy, free and lively, vast numbers of people running about in mingled confusion, the king is out hunting, the queen is expecting\n\n24\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\nto imitate the reforms being introduced in Vienna by her brother, the emperor Joseph II, and she needed a minister willing to assert the power of the monarchy over the feudal nobility and the Church and build a dynastic army and navy. She found her man in 1778 when her brother Peter Leopold sent an energetic administrator named John Acton to Naples to advise on building a navy. Born in France but descended from an English Jacobite family, Acton had served in the French navy before going to Tuscany to advise the Grand Duke on naval matters. He now followed Tanucci’s footsteps from Florence to Naples, where his task initially was to advise on naval matters. However, the queen soon gave him the job of reorganizing the army and expanding the Kingdom’s economy and trade. Within two years of his arrival, Acton was the queen’s favourite and by repute also her lover. In 1779 he was appointed Secretary for the Navy and in 1780 acquired the posts of Secretary for War and Finances, making him the most powerful minister at the Neapolitan Court.³⁵ Acton’s project for building an independent navy and reorganizing the army gave the government’s reform programme a new sense of urgency. Anxious to acquire British approval Acton sought the good ofﬁces of the British envoy, Sir William Hamilton. The new relations between Naples and Vienna had made the British less hostile to the Neapolitan government, and as commercial competition between Britain and France increased, and as the size of France’s Mediterranean ﬂeet grew, Britain’s interest in developing new markets in the Two Sicilies and in gaining access to the Sicilian ports had also grown. Although Britain’s principal trade entrepôt in the western Mediterranean was Livorno in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, apart from Gibraltar and the Balearic Islands Britain had no secure naval stations in the Mediterranean and few allies capable of providing port facilities in times of war.³⁶ The Neapolitan government was also interested in ﬁnding ways to promote its foreign trade. New commercial treaties were negotiated with the Habsburg Empire, the Ottoman Porte, the Bey of Tripoli, Denmark, the Dutch Republic, Morocco, Sardinia, and Russia. Negotiations with Britain collapsed, however, when the British refused to give up the major commercial privileges they enjoyed under the terms of a very one-sided treaty signed with Spain in 1667.³⁷ Despite this failure, the volume of British imports—especially salt cod, and colonial and manufactured goods—grew rapidly in the second half of the century and faster than France’s trade with Naples, which was also expanding.³⁸ This was a source of great alarm for the reformers who feared that the Kingdom risked\n\na child, and so things could not be better’ (Naples, 25 February, 1787): cited in Saine and Sammons (1989), 152. ³⁵ See entry by Nuzzo, in DBI, i. 206–10; Barra (no date), 108. ³⁶ De Divitiis and Giura (1997). ³⁷ The privileges included a ﬂat rate reduction on all landing duties and the right not to be inspected by Neapolitan customs ofﬁcers. See Nuzzo (1971), 280–1. ³⁸ Nuzzo (1990), 457.\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n25\n\nbecoming a colonial supplier of raw materials to Britain.³⁹ These fears also fuelled rumours that the queen and Acton were agents of British commercial interests, and these were eagerly seized on by the remnants of the pro-Spanish faction that had never hidden its hostility to the Austrian queen.⁴⁰ But those attacks were also directed at the increasingly absolutist and arbitrary style of government adopted by the queen and her favourite minister.\n\nTHE CHURCH Perhaps the most dangerous enemy of the new dynasty was the Pope. For centuries the papacy had claimed that the rulers of the Kingdom were its feudal vassals, which meant that the Pope claimed the exclusive right to sanction any change of dynasty. In symbolic recognition of their status as vassals the rulers of Naples every year made the gift to the Pope of a white palfrey (known as the chinea) laden with gold and precious jewels.⁴¹ However, the Pope’s power in the Kingdom was far from symbolic, and as well as important jurisdictional rights and the revenues attached to them Rome was the source of extensive and very lucrative ecclesiastical patronage. For that reason it also exercised great political inﬂuence, and had many committed supporters amongst the feudal aristocracy as well as the clergy. In the early eighteenth century Rome’s power and patronage in the Kingdom came under attack. The case against Rome was set out most cogently in Pietro Giannone’s Civil History of the Kingdom of Naples, a treatise ﬁrst published in 1723 which subsequently became an obligatory point of reference for the later Neapolitan reform movement. In his tract, Giannone depicted the history of the South as a prolonged struggle for freedom from the papacy, which had always been the ally of the Kingdom’s foreign invaders. He concluded that the Kingdom would never be free of papal oppression until it was ruled by an independent secular prince.⁴² Giannone’s treatise drew on a much older tradition of hostility to the papacy, and earlier Neapolitan writers had frequently depicted Spain as the papacy’s accomplice in suppressing Neapolitan liberties. In the seventeenth century, papal hostility to all forms of new learning, to science and the new rationalist philosophies, had encouraged the popularity of ‘libertine’, rationalist, and secularist philosophies in southern Italy. Since the university was closely controlled by the ³⁹ Galanti, Breve Descrizione (1792), ii. 334–5.The surplus with France probably offset the deﬁcit in the Kingdom’s accounts through bills discounted in England and Holland, but either way this was clear evidence that the volume of the Kingdom’s foreign trade was increasing in the second half of the century: see Salvemini in Imbuglia (2000), 44–69; also Chorley (1965), 13–38; Romano (1951), 92–5. ⁴⁰ Nuzzo (1990), 437–535. ⁴¹ This ceremony was one of the most colourful of the annual pageants of papal Rome: Tanucci threatened to end it in 1767 but this did not happen until 1788 at the height of the anti-curial campaign: see Rambaud (1908), 294. ⁴² Chiosi (1987), 371–467.\n\n26\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\nSpanish vice-regal authorities and supporters of papal supremacy, a strong tradition of private schools had also taken root in Naples.⁴³ In the new political circumstances following the founding of an independent dynastic state, opposition to Rome would play an important role in creating the intellectual background from which the Neapolitan reform movement would emerge. However, hostility to Rome also went hand in hand with asserting the autonomy of the new dynastic rulers, and helps explain the enthusiastic reception for Freemasonry in southern Italy. It was the ﬁrst patron of Freemasonry in Naples, the Prince of Sansevero, who in 1744 appealed to Charles III to follow the example of the Elector of Prussia and declare himself a mason, create a new aristocracy of the virtuous, and establish a national army.⁴⁴ The king did not respond to that appeal, but in 1741 the government had negotiated a new Concordat in which Rome made important concessions, including waiving certain tax exemptions for religious houses. The Concordat also enabled the government to begin reducing the number of convents and religious houses in the Kingdom considered to be excessive.⁴⁵ However, the standing of the new ruler with the opponents of papal power was greatly enhanced in 1744 when the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Spinelli, was accused of secretly plotting with Rome to introduce the Inquisition into Naples. The charges against Spinelli mobilized all the opponents of Rome, and the king’s decision to order an inquiry that conﬁrmed the accusations was warmly greeted by the anti-papal faction. It also revealed the highly divisive nature of ecclesiastical politics, however. In Rome the royal intervention was furiously attacked and opposition to the papal curia in Naples was attributed to the spread of ‘a Republican and British spirit’ encouraged by the unchecked circulation of works by Giannone, Locke, and Montesquieu.⁴⁶ In Naples, however, the Pope’s protests also found many supporters, including the Jesuits, most of the regular clergy, and S. Alfonso Maria di Liguori, the city’s most popular and inﬂuential preacher who in his widely attended sermons regularly denounced all those who challenged the authority of Rome as libertines and Freemasons.⁴⁷\n\nTHE CAPITAL The Kingdom that Charles of Bourbon inherited in 1734 was not only the oldest monarchy on the peninsula, but also the largest.⁴⁸ At the time of Charles’s accession the population of the mainland was estimated at four million, with nearly ⁴³ Chiosi (1987), 371–467. ⁴⁴ Ibid.; Ferrone (1989/2000); Giarrizzo (1995). ⁴⁵ Moricola (1994) 27–8: 22% of the 75,000 priests and clerics in the Kingdom resided in Naples. ⁴⁶ Chiosi (2000), 452–4. ⁴⁷ Ibid. ⁴⁸ Before the House of Savoy—the oldest ruling dynasty in Italy, indeed in Europe according to their apologists—acquired their royal title in 1713, the only other Italian ruler with the title of king was the Pope; the papa-re.\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n27\n\nanother million in Sicily. The Kingdom also contained Italy’s two largest cities. Naples, whose population was estimated at between 350,000 and 400,000 at the end of the eighteenth century, was still the third largest city in Europe after London and Paris. Palermo, with around 120,000 inhabitants was much smaller, but at the end of the century still slightly larger than Rome. The other southern cities were both smaller and less numerous than their northern counterparts.⁴⁹ For the French traveller Charles de Brosse, Naples was the only Italian city in the eighteenth century that had the feel of a capital, and the new Bourbon rulers set out to make it a monument to their dynastic ambitions.⁵⁰ Naples was in many respects the perfect theatre for such an enterprise. Set in surroundings of extraordinary natural beauty and drama, the city was also a treasure-trove for eighteenth-century tastes. Here the traveller could admire the spectacle of Mount Vesuvius in eruption, visit the sites of the ancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii where excavations had recently begun to yield remarkable artefacts of antiquity, or tour the fabled Phlegrean Fields, which offered an unrivalled choice of classical sites, mythological references, and natural wonders. As well as some of the ﬁnest Baroque architecture in Italy, the city’s streets and public squares were a constant pageant of folklore and festival that was outshone only by papal Rome. Scarcely a day passed without processions to celebrate a neighbourhood saint or patron, in which monks and friars from the many religious houses, members of the lay confraternities, the penitents, the sick, the halt, the maimed, the lame, and the blind formed the permanent supporting cast. Nor could the visitor miss the famous lazzaroni, most often depicted as exotic beggars idly reclining in picaresque semi-nudity on the harbour walls.⁵¹ Even more exotic was the fabled cuccagna, an elaborately choreographed spectacle that was part public charity and part display of royal muniﬁcence. For days food, ﬂour, wine, meats, and live animals—cows, calves, goats, kids, sheep, lamb, geese, capons, and other fowl—were piled high on towers constructed in one of the main piazze of the city. On the appointed day and hour a signal was given, the guards stood back and the populace invaded the piazza to take whatever could be carried. The pell-mell that ensued took place under the benevolent gaze of the prince and his courtiers, who watched from the lofty safety of a balcony. More often cited than seen, the cuccagna embodied the exotic and the barbaric that caught the travellers’ fascination. But if the city’s pageantry had deep roots in ⁴⁹ The next largest on the mainland was Foggia with 20,000 inhabitants, followed by a number of towns whose populations varied between 10,000 and 20,000. In Sicily, Catania and Messina were the largest cities after Palermo, with a number of other towns of around 8,000 inhabitants: see Galasso (1997), 42–4. ⁵⁰ Many other reactions were far less complimentary; discerning discourses in travellers’ tales are a ﬂourishing industry: see Calaresu (1999), Moe (2002), Naddeo (2005), but the fullest critical anthologies remain Mozzillo (1992) and Venturi (1972). See also Galasso, ‘Lo stereotipo del napoletano’, in idem (1994), 171–225. ⁵¹ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe noted perceptively that they were not beggars, but stevedores whose brief work shifts were combined with long periods of enforced idleness: Naples May 28, 1787, in Saine and Sammons (1989 ), 262–7; cf. also Boyle (1992), 458–66, 478–81.\n\n28\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\nthe culture of its popular neighbourhoods, much had also been invented in the course of the eighteenth century as the city became the principal site for parading the glory and grandeur of the new dynasty. Once the Kingdom had been secured from foreign enemies, Charles III set about making his capital reﬂect to the glory of the new dynasty. The result was an unprecedented building spree designed to rank Naples with the leading capital cities in Europe, embellished with a dazzling array of sumptuous royal palaces, villas, hunting lodges, theatres, and monuments in and around the capital that aimed to surpass the grandest princes in Europe.⁵² The greatest of these projects was the vast palace built on the principal landward approaches to the city at Caserta. Designed by Luigi Vanvitelli, work begun in 1754 and was completed within only twenty-two years.⁵³ But Caserta was only one of the many grandiose new monuments that transformed the appearance of Naples and its surrounding area. Work also began to enlarge the royal palace in the centre of the Naples, while new royal residences were built at Capodimonte, at Portici, and near the recently opened excavations at Herculaneum, all of which were accompanied by sumptuous and elegant new villas build for wealthy courtiers and nobles.⁵⁴ Elegant hunting lodges and follies paid tribute in addition to the king’s passion for hunting, which was inherited as an obsession by his third son who in 1767 would succeed him as Ferdinand IV. These great building projects brought artists and craftsmen from all over Europe to the city, among them the Bohemian painter Antol Raffael Mengs, who had accompanied Charles III’s child-bride, Maria Amalia⁵⁵ from her father’s Court in Dresden, Angelika Kauffman,⁵⁶ Philip Hackert,⁵⁷ and Wilhelm Tischbein,⁵⁸ who ﬁrst came to Naples with Goethe and was later appointed director of the Accademia delle Belle Arti in 1789.⁵⁹ Among the numerous portraits commissioned to celebrate the new dynasty, the most prominent background themes were the buried Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and Mount Vesuvius.⁶⁰ Excavation of the archaeological sites ⁵² See especially De Seta (1981, 1992, 1999). ⁵³ Luigi Vanvitelli’s (1700–73) reputation had been made in Rome where he had been the chief architect and supervisor of buildings at St Peter’s in the 1720s. As well as a new harbour for the papal port of Ancona and the monumental cemetery at the shrine of the Madonna of Loreto, he also designed the Jesuit chapel in Lisbon and the residence of the Habsburg Archduke of Milan. ⁵⁴ On the ‘ville vesuviane’ see De Seta (1981), 152–83. ⁵⁵ The daughter of the Elector of Saxony (and King of Poland) who became Charles’s child-bride in 1737 at the age of 13. ⁵⁶ Angelika Kauffmann (1741–1807): born in Switzerland she worked in London from 1766 to 1781, then moved to Italy with her husband Antonio Zucchi. ⁵⁷ Philip Hackert (1737–1807): a Prussian landscape painter who moved from Rome to Naples where he was appointed court painter by Ferdinand IV. ⁵⁸ Wilhelm Tischbein (1751–1829) was director of the Academy from 1789 to 1799, then returned to Germany and became the court painter to the Duke of Oldenburg at Eutin.

These were followed by colour reproductions of paintings on the Greek and Roman vases found at the same sites in volumes edited by mysterious Baron d’Hancarville and Sir William Hamilton.⁶¹ The city as a result came to be closely identiﬁed with the new enthusiasm for neoclassical art, and it also provided the English pottery-master Josiah Wedgwood with the design for the highly successful line of Etruria ware that was directly inspired by Hamilton’s reproductions of the classical paintings found at Pompeii and Herculaneum.⁶² Vesuvius was hardly less important in linking the city to contemporary fascination with the natural sciences, although few observers could resist the unscientiﬁc temptation of linking the volcano to the character of the Neapolitans. Sir William Hamilton was not only the volcano’s indefatigable record keeper but also its principal publicist. He made the difﬁcult and frequently dangerous ascent to the crater almost seventy times, generally in the company of a retinue of foreign visitors and often immediately after major eruptions.⁶³ The city had much else to reﬂect the glory of the new dynasty and long before the arrival of the Bourbons was famed as the ‘European capital of music’.⁶⁴ With four conservatories the city continued to attract the leading musical talents of the age, among them Paisiello and Cimarosa.⁶⁵ In addition to its rich tradition of street theatres and puppet stalls, where Pulcinella and his entourage drew on an older Neapolitan tradition of the commedia dell’arte, the city also boasted ﬁve permanent theatres.⁶⁶ One of Charles III’s ﬁrst initiatives was to rebuild and enlarge the San Carlo theatre to keep an eye, so it was said, on what his nobles were doing at night. But the broader signiﬁcance of the monarchy’s role as leader and arbiter of cultural taste was unmistakable.⁶⁷ The new theatre was connected to the royal palace, making it an extension of the Court. ‘Groundlings’ were admitted on occasion, but only the nobility and wealthiest non-noble families were eligible for subscriptions to the boxes, which were allocated personally by the king. The season ran from the Christmas holidays to Lent and was where the nobility met, entertained, ⁶¹ And came to play an important role in establishing the neo-classical style: see Jenkins in Jenkins and Sloan (1996), 40–60. ⁶² Ibid. ⁶³ See Constantine (2001), 195; on Baron d’Hancarville see Rousseau, in Rousseau and Porter (1987). ⁶⁴ The ﬁrst performance of Pietro Mestasio’s Didone Abbandonata in 1724 made Naples the birthplace of European melodrama. Handel’s opera Partenope was ﬁrst performed in 1730, while Giovanni Pergolesi’s Serva Padrona launched the new fashion for opera buffa that would quickly be taken up in all the courts and capitals of Europe: De Benedetto in Imbruglia (2000), 135–50. ⁶⁵ Ibid. ⁶⁶ The San Carlo, the Fiorentino, the Teatro Nuovo, the San Carlino, and the Teatro del Fondo. ⁶⁷ Croce, I Teatri (1947).\n\n30\n\nAbsolutist Naples\n\nplayed cards, ate, drank, and conversed while following the action on stage by means of mirrors set at the rear of the boxes.⁶⁸ The king was not the only source of artistic patronage, however, as there were also many private patrons in the city. In the past, the great religious houses and churches had been the principal patrons of artists and architects, but in the eighteenth century wealthy lay patrons became more prominent. The glory of the great palaces built by the new rulers was reﬂected in those of leading nobles like the Duke della Torre and the Prince of Francavilla, which also housed outstanding collections of paintings and ﬁne art. The splendid baroque family chapel of the Prince of Sansevero with its famous masonic devices was built during the reign of Charles III, while the ‘Vesuvian villas’ built for leading courtiers and noblemen at Herculaneum were the ﬁnest expression of the Indian summer of the Kingdom’s eighteenth-century cultural renaissance. Numerous private patrons played their part in this, including Tanucci’s friend, the wealthy Tuscan banker Bernardo Intieri, who funded the new chair in political economy at the University of Naples—the ﬁrst not only in Italy but in Europe—created in 1754 for Antonio Genovesi. But wealthy patrons were active in many other branches of the arts, especially music and the theatre.⁶⁹ By contrast, the monarchy’s promotion of the arts and sciences was always politically motivated and selective. Tanucci was no friend of the new ideas of the Enlightenment, but he understood that the arts, sciences, and learning were essential trappings of the modern prince.⁷⁰ He was responsible for founding the Accademia del Disegno in 1752, which later became the Accademia delle Belle Arti and three years later the Accademia Reale Ercolanese, which was responsible for cataloguing the papyri and other treasures discovered during the excavations at Herculaneum. The complaint most frequently heard in the 1780s, however, was that royal patronage of the arts and sciences was penny-pinching and uncertain. Whatever funds were available were directed to prestigious regalian monuments, and even the plans to transfer the collection of artworks that Charles inherited from his mother Elizabeth Farnese to Naples ran into major problems. Nor was the monarchy willing to support wider academic and scientiﬁc projects, and despite repeated appeals from the world of letters and learning the Royal Academy for Sciences ⁶⁸ Rosselli (1984), 82–3; Sorba (2001), 93–153. ⁶⁹ Francesco Saverio de Rogati, a jurist and a music lover, was the protégé of Vito Giuseppe Millico, who was the most acclaimed Neapolitan castrato of the time. De Rogati was director of the Royal College of Music (later the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella). The Prince of Campofranco and the Lucchesi Palli family were also leading patrons of musicians and the theatre: see Di Benedetto in Imbruglia (2000), 148–9. ⁷⁰ He banned possession of Voltaire’s Dictionary and Fénélon’s Reﬂections on the Conscience of a King as an offence punishable by two years imprisonment on the grounds that ‘We do not hold it advisable to place in the hands and mouths of the common people ideas that criticise our rulers.’ See Rotondo (1984), 492; on censorship and publishing in Naples see Rao (1998) and Luise (2001).\n\nThe Ancien Régime in the South\n\n31\n\nfounded by the Austrian government in 1732 was not re-established until 1778 and even then suffered from severe lack of resources.⁷¹ Nonetheless, by the end of the century Naples had become an established station on the European Grand Tour. That was good for business, but not good enough to make a signiﬁcant contribution to the city’s economy. In economic terms, the greatest impact of the monarchy’s initiatives came from the work and demand created by its building projects, and when it came to promoting trade and manufacturing enterprises royal interventions followed conventional mercantilist logic. Charles III’s government established a variety of royal manufactures whose main purpose was to provide luxury goods and apparel for use at court and to reduce the need for imports.⁷² There were also a number of more utopian initiatives, and after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 the convents of San Giuseppe di Chiaia and of the Carminello were converted into pauper schools under royal patronage.⁷³ The most unusual of these utopian schemes came toward the end of the century when in 1789 the Royal Silk Works was founded at San Leucio near the royal palace at Caserta. The aim was to improve the quality of silk fabrics by using the most modern techniques, but what made the project remarkable were the utopian regulations for the community of silk workers introduced three years later and supposedly drafted by the king himself. They and their families were provided with housing, schools, and medical services, while strict equality between the sexes was to be observed and dowries were banned.⁷⁴ The San Leucio colony was established after the revolution in France and just before the monarchy cut all its ties with the reform movement and was most probably inspired by the utopian colonies founded by the Jesuits in Paraguay. Similar South American models also inspired the greatest monument to the monarchy’s paternalism, the Royal Hospice for the Poor (Reale Albergo dei Poveri) in Naples. This too had been started by Charles III, to match the monumental poo"
