        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Who says you can't go home again?\n\nPort Richmond High school rolled out the \"Red Raider\" carpet Thursday for one of its own, television and screen actor Carmine Giovinazzo, who returned to his alma mater as principal for a day.\n\nAs Giovinazzo walked in the door, he was greeted and high-fived by members of the school's baseball team and the school mascot. Cheerleaders performed a special cheer dedicated to him, and the school's jazz band burst into a chorus of the CSI:NY theme.\n\nThe Mariners Harbor native, who grew up on Staten Island, graduated from Port Richmond in 1991. He played baseball both at Port Richmond and at Wagner College -- and even worked out with the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field before a back injury curtailed his career on the diamond.\n\nThat's when Giovinazzo moved on to Los Angeles and an acting career that would make him one of the best-known faces in prime-time television in his role as detective Danny Messer on the CBS-TV series \"CSI: New York,\" which wrapped up its long run earlier this year.\n\nLater in the day Giovinazzo was presented with an honorary \"Raider of the Month\" plaque by principal Timothy M. Gannon, and served a catered lunch prepared by students in the school's award-winning culinary arts class.\n\nGiovinazzo encouraged students to work hard in their classes, pursue their dreams and aspirations, and get involved in the high school experience rather than just leaving at the end of the day. He discussed how he went from playing ball in high school, to falling into the profession of acting, becoming a success and \"staying grounded\" -- all of which he attributed to his Staten Island roots and the \"good foundation\" he received at Port Richmond.\n\n\"It is truly an honor to be wide-received and to remember the very steps I took in this building... I often drive past it when I visit town, but to be here today is something else,\" he told students.\n\nStudents in the school's television and media arts program sat down for an interview with Giovinazzo, which will air later this month on the school's new television series titled \"Good Morning, Port Richmond.\"\n\nThe teens were impressed.\n\n\"Listening to him speak today really encouraged me to never give up on what I want to pursue in the arts, and thanks to him, I am going full steam ahead,\" said Port Richmond senior and student organization president Arielle Rosario.\n\n\"To think someone who made it big like him once walked the halls and graduated from Port Richmond High School,\" said senior class president Adam Kostandy, who escorted Giovinazzo on a tour of the building. \"It makes me feel as if I can achieve something big as well.\""
