Two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and crewmembers based at the Army Aviation Support Facility at Albany International Airport in Latham joined two additional New York State Police helicopters to drop water along the fire line to help contain the wildfire that began May 3. The crews used water buckets, known by the trademarked name of Bambi Buckets, to scoop up water from nearby lakes or rivers and dump the water on wildfires. U.S. Army National Guard photo by Col.
