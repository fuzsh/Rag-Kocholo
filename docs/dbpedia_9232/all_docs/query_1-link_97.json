        "text": "Federal Funding Will Be Used To Purchase New Extraction Equipment\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $43,968 in federal funding for the Summitville Fire District in Sullivan County. The funding was allocated through the Department of Homeland Security’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) and will be used to replace old and outdated extraction tools.\n\n“It is essential that we provide our firefighters with the equipment they need to stay safe on the job,” said Senator Schumer. “Our first responders are our local heroes and our first line of defense for safety and security. By allowing the courageous firefighters of the Summitville Fire District to purchase new extraction equipment, this grant will help ensure their health and safety in any emergency.”\n\n“With this federal investment, the Summitville Fire District will be able to purchase new equipment to help them best prepare for emergencies in our communities,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We need to do everything we can to protect the first responders who risk their lives every day in the face of danger. I was proud to fight for this funding and I will always work to make sure that our local fire departments have the resources they need to do their jobs.”\n\n“These extrication tools will replace our hydraulic tools which are older and requires a lot more manpower. This will be great assistance to our firehouse,” said Robert Hufcut Sr., Summitville Fire Chief.\n\nGillibrand wrote to the FEMA earlier this year to support the Summitville Fire District’s grant application. The full text of Gillibrand’s letter is available here.\n\nThe AFG Program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the Department’s United States Fire Administration. The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to the applicants that most closely address the program’s priorities and demonstrate financial need. More information on the AFG Program can be found here.\n\n###"
