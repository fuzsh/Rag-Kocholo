        "text": "JP McHale Controls Termite Activity in Summitville, NY?\n\nJP McHale is a leading termite control and pest prevention company catering to Summitville, New York and the greater Northeastern area. Termite treatment is one of the services we provide. At JP McHale, we utilize the Sentricon system, the world’s leading brand for termite management. How do you get rid of termites, you ask? You don’t need to worry about doing that yourself or damage to your home. We use the same Presidential Green Award certified solution as those in use on the Statue of Liberty and the White House.\n\nOur termite remediation system is armed with AlwaysActive technology. Our environmentally friendly solution and termite traps will monitor and provide around-the-clock protection. JP McHale’s organic termite control prevents water contamination and runoffs and is genuinely green.\n\nTermite control methods are incorporated into our Home Pest Prevention packages, too, including Home Pest Prevention Plus and Home Pest Prevention Complete. If you’re looking for the final word on how to get rid of termites without tenting, look no further than JP McHale.\n\nWhat Are the Early Warning Signs of Termites\n\nTermites tend to burrow under your Summitville, NY, home, so termite tubes found in the mud and dirt around your home’s foundation are good things to look out for. Hollow sounding wood is a clear-cut and classic alarm bell in termite detection. While termite bites are possible, they seldom happen. Look for strange patterns in your woodwork, too, as these almost certainly indicate the presence of termites."
