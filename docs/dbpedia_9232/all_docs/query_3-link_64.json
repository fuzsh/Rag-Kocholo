        "text": "This auction requires that the winning bidder pay a Buyer's Premium of 10.00% of the winning bid amount. (The Buyer's Premium covers the costs associated with the auction).\n\nThis amount will be added to the winning bid and will be included in the total purchase price paid by the Buyer to the Seller.\n\nSome sellers buy large \"pools\" of under-valued properties from banks. The seller may not inspect every property prior to sale. The seller represents these properties to the best of their knowledge. In some rare cases, property may have severe damage or be subject to county/city orders not described in the auction. It is highly recommended that interested bidders arrange for an external inspection personally or through a designate and that they contact the county or city in which the property is located to confirm the status of the property.\n\nBid4Assets reminds all potential real estate bidders that it is your responsibility to complete all due diligence needed to determine the condition, market value, or investment value of this asset prior to placing a bid. Necessary due diligence items may include, but are not limited to,\n\nA satisfactory inspection of the property\n\nCompletion of a title search\n\nInvestigating back property taxes and\n\nOther - liens and encumbrances such as unpaid utility bills.\n\nBy placing a bid, you acknowledge that any statements made by the seller about the condition or market value of the property are subjective, and do not release you from your responsibility to perform due diligence. Please contact Bid4Assets if you believe that a seller is intentionally misrepresenting a property in their auction."
