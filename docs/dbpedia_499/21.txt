New York City's BLACK ARMY JACKET was one of the key players in the powerviolence movement of the '90s. Featuring musicians that have played in such bands as Discordance Axis, Hope Collapse, Human Remains, and Municipal Waste, BAJ specialized in a unique strain of grinding hardcore that was as memorable as it was relentless. This highly_anticipated vinyl reissue of the bandÍs 1998 "222" album includes a complete remix from the original tapes, two unreleased bonus tracks from the sessions, striking new cover art courtesy of Godmachine, a poster of the cover art and a screen printed patch, plus DL card.
