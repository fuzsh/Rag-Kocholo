Since taking the fashion world by storm with denim brand Current/Elliott in 2008, longtime design collaborators Emily Current and Meritt Elliott have made more than a name for themselves with their vintage-inspired creations. In 2015, the duo co-founded THE GREAT., an apparel brand that realized their love for everything Americana in easy-to-wear staples with feminine charm. Today, the brand continues to serve its classically cool aesthetic by way of graphic sweatshirts, laid-back bell-bottoms and carefree florals.
