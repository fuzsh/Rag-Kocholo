        "text": "Elmer P. Gibson was a high-ranking African American Army Chaplain who served in World War II and the Korean War. He was an advocate for desegregating the military, and practiced desegregation as a chaplain, by holding integrated church services in the Aleutian Islands and other places. Later in life he served as an advisor to President Harry S. Truman and was a college president.\n\nElmer P. Gibson was born in 1903, in Greensboro, North Carolina. His father, Reverend Lewis B. Gibson was formerly enslaved. His mother was Cornelia Adeline Pettiford Gibson. While in high school, Gibson was licensed to preach at St. Matthew’s Methodist Episcopal Church in Greensboro. Gibson attended Lincoln University, a historically black university in Oxford, Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1926 and began work as a deacon.\n\nGibson was the first African American graduate of his seminary, Crozer Theological, in Chester Pennsylvania in 1930. He was ordained as a minister in 1928 and received a third degree in 1932 from the University of Pennsylvania. From 1933 to 1941, Gibson was the pastor of John Wesley Methodist Church in Salisbury, Maryland. During this time Gibson married Jeffery Melnese Wilson and they began a family. The Gibsons had a daughter (Cornelia) and a son (Elmer H.).\n\nAs the United States became involved in World War II, Gibson was commissioned in the Army’s Chaplain Corps as a First Lieutenant in 1941. He first worked with the 367th Infantry Regiment (Colored). He then transferred to the newly formed 364th Infantry Regiment (Colored), 92nd Infantry Division. The 364th was mostly made up with people from the 367th. Gibson and his family moved with the Infantry to Phoenix, Arizona and then Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi. Gibson and the 364th were deployed to the Aleutian Islands on Christmas Day, 1943.\n\nGibson was not only the regimental chaplain, but often the only Army chaplain available on Adak and Shemya Islands, in the Aleutians. He presided over integrated church services since there were no other chaplains. Gibson’s devotion to integration was noted, and he received the Legion of Merit award in 1945. His commanding officer, Brig. Gen. John F. Goodman wrote, “He is a great believer in bringing the white and colored races into a sensible toleration of each other. I believe him to be one of the best Chaplains I have seen since being in the service.”\n\nThe award citation noted that Gibson “directed religious activities of the 364th Infantry Regiment in an exceptionally meritorious manner. He successfully handled all press releases for the colored troops on the islands and fulfilled all his tasks with untiring devotion to duty and conducted religious services not only for Negro troops but for other troops as well. He was an outstanding officer, leader, and a man of great capacity for work and by his untiring devotion, loyalty, understanding, and keen personal interest in the welfare of others contributed in no small measure to the morale of not only the men in the 364th Infantry Regiment but all others with whom he came in contact. His professional ability, tolerant outlook and unremitting devotion to duty reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.”\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Gibson returned to civilian life. He had the opportunity to continue his military chaplaincy career, but he declined. He would not have been given the rank of other chaplains (Major). In 1946, Gibson took an Army examination, passed. He was appointed to the Regular Army by President Harry S. Truman. Gibson received a permanent rank of Major and became one of the highest ranked African Americans in the Army.\n\nGibson continued his advocacy to integrate the Army. He became an advisor to President Truman. In that role, he helped make plans and policies to completely desegregate the entire Armed Forces. In 1948, President Truman issued Executive Order 9981. It established equal treatment and opportunity in the military, regardless of race. Gibson testified before the Committee on Equal Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services (also called the Fahy Committee) on the topic of integration. He continued to promote integration, since it took the military branches awhile to put in place desegregation.\n\nGibson was promoted to Lit. Colonel in 1950 while stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey. He became the first African American Army Post Chaplain in US history. He supervised almost two dozen other chaplains, both black and white, at Fort Dix, beginning in 1951. In May, 1952, Gibson arrived in Korea. He worked as the Assistant Corps Chaplain for the US Army 10th Corps (another first). Gibson’s duties included ministering to injured soldiers; talking and praying with soldiers waiting to for evacuation; providing chapel services for troops; ministering at local Korean Christian churches; and giving food and clothes to Koreans. Gibson remained in Korea until October of 1953.\n\nGibson was awarded the Bronze Star Medal because he “frequently visited the front-line troops, often under fire, to conduct religious services and see to their spiritual guidance and well-being.” Gibson finished his military career as 2nd Infantry Division Chaplain at Fort Lewis, Washington. He retired in 1957 as Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nAfter retiring from the military, Gibson moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Temple University for a master’s degree in Educational Psychology. Gibson graduated in 1959, the same year he became president of Morristown College, a historically black college in Morristown, Tennessee. Gibson retired in 1969, and the college closed its doors for good in 1994, the same year that Gibson died. He was 90 years old and was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery (Section 64, Site 565).\n\nReferences"
