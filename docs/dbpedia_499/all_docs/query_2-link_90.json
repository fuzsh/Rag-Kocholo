        "text": "There's been no major US reaction to the situation between Israel and Hezbollah today as officials are \"waiting to see what happens next\", says our US correspondent Mark Stone.\n\nAfter a day consisting of \"just short statements\" from politicians in America and across Europe, there are \"one of two things\" that could happen next, Stone says.\n\nOne option, he says, is that a deal is reached on a ceasefire in Gaza, \"which would then allow Hezbollah to say 'we're going to stop attacking Israel from the north'\".\n\nBut with that looking \"unlikely\" after Israel and Hamas failed once again to come to an agreement following several days of high-level talks in Cairo, Stone says exchanges of fire across the border will continue and could lead to a potential \"miscalculation, a large loss of life on one side or the other, and then the whole thing spirals\".\n\n\"There's an unbelievably uncomfortable game of brinkmanship that continues here,\" Stone adds.\n\nHe notes that US officials speaking on the sidelines of the Cairo talks have said ceasefire discussions are ongoing.\n\nTalks in Cairo aimed at negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have ended with no agreement, the Reuters news agency reports, citing two Egyptian sources.\n\nThe sources reportedly said that neither the militant group nor Israel agreed to several compromises suggested by mediators.\n\nAs we've been reporting this evening, Hamas said it has rejected new Israeli ceasefire conditions which it claims deviated from a US proposal put forward in July (more detail in 21.10 post).\n\nA reporter for the US outlet Axios has separately cited a US official as saying talks in recent days had been \"constructive\" and would \"continue over the coming days\" in order to \"address remaining issues and details\".\n\nWe've more detail to bring you following our earlier report that Hamas has rejected new Israeli conditions put forward in long-running Gaza ceasefire negotiations (see 18.49 post).\n\nThe group said earlier that it was committed to the 2 July proposal it previously agreed to.\n\nIt's now emerged that Hamas has accused Israel of backtracking on a promise to withdraw its troops from a narrow stretch of land along Gaza's southern border with Egypt.\n\nIt added that Israeli officials had proposed other new conditions, such as screening displaced Palestinians on their return to northern Gaza.\n\n\"We will not accept discussions about retractions from what we agreed to on July 2 or new conditions,\" Hamas official Osama Hamdan told its Al-Aqsa TV.\n\nBack in July, the militant group accepted a US proposal to start talks on releasing its remaining hostages, a source told the Reuters news agency."
