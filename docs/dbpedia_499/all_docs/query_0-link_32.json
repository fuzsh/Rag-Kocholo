        "text": "WYNNE, Ark. (KAIT) - Wynne residents will have to decide in November if they wish to keep Jennifer Hobbs as their town’s mayor.\n\nEarlier this week, a group calling for her removal submitted a petition to remove Hobbs.\n\nThe Cross County Clerk’s Office confirmed Thursday that it had verified the 1,092 signatures submitted by “Always a Jacket” and that the measure will be on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n\n“You can keep going the way you’re going and not recognize your town in January of 2027 when a new mayor would be sworn in, or you can change course now,” said Princella Smith, spokesperson for “Always a Jacket.”\n\nThe group’s concerns stem from the mayor’s response to the Wynne tornado in 2023. They claim the mayor was not prepared to respond to the tragedy, and the recovery has been disastrous.\n\n“I have personally spoken with numerous Wynne residents who feel ignored or forgotten,” said Smith in a statement.\n\n“It’s frustrating because I know that my team and I have put countless hours into the recovery for Wynne after the tornado,” Hobbs told K8 News. “It’s frustrating that someone that doesn’t even live in our community can cause this much division.”\n\nSmith hasn’t called Wynne home in years, but she said she has several reasons to care.\n\n“The petition was filed by residents of Wynne, Arkansas,” Smith said. “What I did was I used my abilities to come home and to help my hometown and to empower them.”\n\nSmith said housing is one of the major issues the mayor has not addressed.\n\n“We have several people in FEMA trailers whose deadline is October,” she said. “Some of some people’s deadlines was in June to exit the FEMA trailers. Where is their option to live? This mayor has made zero moves to bring any affordable housing into this town.”\n\nIn a statement to K8 News, Hobbs said the city already had a housing problem before the tornado ripped through.\n\n“Recovery does not happen overnight; recovery doesn’t happen in six months or 18 months or 24 months. Recovery takes time,” Hobbs said. “Private citizen recovery is not and cannot be funded by city funds, and the city does not receive funds from any organization for personal citizens’ recovery.”\n\n“The city can’t force somebody to come in and build an apartment complex or build a new subdivision. That’s an expensive thing, and in the economic times that we’re in right now, we’re not seeing a lot of that come to fruition,” she said.\n\n“Always A Jacket” alleges the mayor has delayed rebuilding the E.U. Deshay Park building despite the city receiving $500,000 in insurance money.\n\n“She took that money and tucked it away,” Smith said.\n\n“The decision to rebuild or not rebuild the building at E. U. Deshay Park does not rest in my hands,” Hobbs countered. “The decision should have been made earlier this spring by the city council; however, they chose to delay the vote until September....The city council decides how the city’s money is spent, not the mayor.”\n\nShe said the money received from the insurance proceeds remain held in a certificate of deposit account.\n\n“We do have that money sitting in a CD and a decision has not been made,” Hobbs said. “That is not my decision. That is a city council decision that will come to a vote on Sept. 17 as to whether we rebuild that.”\n\nSmith said not all issues stem from the tornado. She said the city has dealt with a flooding issue for years, and progress hasn’t been made on that.\n\nBack in June, the mayor said the city met with the Army Corp of Engineers to address the issue.\n\nDespite the petition and complaints, Hobbs believes she is the right person to serve as Wynne’s mayor.\n\n“I’m here for as long as the people will have me,” she said. “We’re going to keep, keep pushing on.”\n\nTo report a typo or correction, please click here."
