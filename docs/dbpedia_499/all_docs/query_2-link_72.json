        "text": "Pictured: Flint and Tinder Stretch Ripstop Waxed Field Jacket\n\nThe M-65 field jacket became standard issue to United States troops in 1965 during the Vietnam Conflict. A successor to the M-51 field jacket issued to troops during the previous war, the M-65 was heavier, outfitted with more features, and better suited to fend off the cold and often rainy conditions experienced in the jungles of Vietnam thanks to a heavyweight cotton canvas construction. Like the M-51 and M-43 jackets used before it, the new version sported an olive green colorway along with a concealable hood, adjustable cuffs, snap buttons, and a plethora of large pockets throughout for carrying extra gear in the field.\n\nThe military field jacket hasn’t changed very much over the past 50 years since the M-65 was introduced, save for a few extra style cues including colors, materials, and subtle changes that don’t skew far from the original design.\n\nNow, long after the Army field jacket has gone by the wayside for gear better suited for combating the cold and rain, the field jacket design has gained even more popularity in the fashion world. You don’t have to be an enlisted soldier to enjoy the stylish looks and functional benefits of a quality field coat, because they look great while out in the city, perform just as well at the campsite or on the trail, and offer plenty of storage pockets for toting your EDC essentials. If you’re interested in adding this classic staple to your wardrobe, here are our picks of the best military-style field jackets available right now, in no particular order.\n\nFlint and Tinder Stretch Ripstop Waxed Field Jacket\n\nFor a hard day’s work swinging an axe, baling hay, or hauling in a fishing line, you’ll want the Flint and Tinder Stretch Ripstop Waxed Field Jacket for sure. It’s made using an ultra-tough waxed canvas cotton fabric that shrugs off rain and wind like a beast, with just enough Spandex blended into the mix that you can stretch and swing your arms comfortably.\n\nThe soft brushed flannel interior adds both extra warmth on cool days and a nice layer of friction-reducing protection to keep your skin free of irritation. Best of all, you’ll look effortlessly cool thanks to the double-stacked chest, relaxed fit, and waist pockets.\n\nPrice: $198\n\nAriat Calumet Field Jacket\n\nWant a jacket as tough as your favorite cowboy boots? The Ariat Calumet is just what you’re looking for. The jacket is wonderfully weather-resistant, thick enough to keep out the cold and wind while still being lightweight and flexible. The advanced fabric combines organic cotton with sturdy nylon and polyester to deliver maximum durability and comfort both.\n\nWith the covered zip placket and snap cuffs, you can seal the jacket up tight even against the worst spring and autumn winds and chills, and the fabric lining on the cuffs add an extra layer of protection to keep your arms warm.\n\nPrice: $325\n\nFlint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket\n\nIf there exists the one jacket you’ll want to don when you leave the house (or the tent, cabin, or trail) its this one. The Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket from Flint and Tinder is immediately comfortable, features durable Martexin sailcloth construction, and is flannel-lined for versatility and warmth during the cooler months.\n\nIt develops a handsome patina based on the crease patterns of each individual, adding a personalization factor to this stylishly utilitarian jacket that’ll hold up for decades to come.\n\nPrice: $298\n\nMission Workshop Eiger Wax Canvas Field Jacket\n\nMission Workshop seems to have it all figured out when it comes to making sleek, commute-friendly gear for the guy on the go — gear that, all at once, is still crafted with great character and style. Retailing for an investment-level $785, this jacket comes packed with all the heritage, history and style you could ask for, available in sleek colors like black and charcoal, plus traditional colors like olive.\n\nA jacket that’s both, as the brand says, water-resistant and refined? Sign us up. We’d wear this with slim dark denim, a classic chambray shirt and suede chukka boots — that’s timeless, easy-going and functional style at its best.\n\nPrice: $785\n\nOrvis Foliage Waxed Field Coat\n\nHeading out into misty, rainy, stormy, or chilly weather? Pull on the Orvis Foliage Waxed Field Coat and you won’t have to worry about a thing. This jacket is made using a natural-waxed organic cotton exterior and recycled polyester lining that will shrug off water and offer surprising warmth against both biting winds and late-season cold.\n\nThe welted handwarmer pockets are spacious enough to fit your hands even if you’re wearing gloves, and the technical moleskin lining is both soft and excellent for retaining body heat. Pop up the soft, lined collar and pull the hood over your head, and you’ll be protected against everything short of a full-blown rainstorm or heavy snowfall.\n\nPrice: $250 $140\n\nFilson Foul Weather Jacket\n\nWorried about an impending storm or the approach of winter? With the Filson Foul Weather Jacket, you don’t need to be. This bad boy is built to shield you from even the foulest weather (it’s right there in the name), using a midweight, tightly-woven, oil-finish waxed canvas Shelter cloth once used by military tents.\n\nIt’s constructed with no seams at the shoulders that can leak, and the two-way front zipper, snap-close storm flap, snap-tab sleeve cuffs, detachable hood, and adjustable waist and hem all help to keep out wind and wet. When the weather threatens to turn very cold, the interior zipper lets you double down on the insulation by adding a zip-in liner to the dry finish Cover Cloth. The jacket will shrug off snow, sleet, rain, and mud with ease, and all it takes to keep it clean is a quick wipe-down with a damp rag and occasional re-waxing.\n\nPrice: $395\n\nOuterknown Voyager Jacket\n\nLooking for something a bit lighter and more comfortable to wear all autumn and spring long? Try the Outerknown Voyager Jacket. Made from an organic cotton military slub twill, the fabric has a lovely texture that both looks unique and feels soft against your skin.\n\nIt’s inspired by the M65 field jackets used by the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, and its midweight makes it suitable to wear during both the warmer and cooler months. Best of all, it’s got a very “laid back” look that will pair nicely with everything from your favorite jeans to chinos to technical pants.\n\nPrice: $298 $208\n\nFaherty Reserve Four Pocket Field Jacket\n\nThe Faherty Reserve Four Pocket Field Jacket is built for guys with a lot of items in their EDC loadout. The four pockets—two chest, two waist—give you plenty of storage space for your daily essentials, with room to spare, and the button closures ensure everything you’re carrying stays firmly where it belongs.\n\nThe fit is relaxed but with a classic silhouette that will cater to guys with a few extra pounds around their midsection. Made from a lightweight blend of polyester (including recycled), it’s the ideal jacket to keep you warm during the cooler summer and autumn days before winter chill sets in for real.\n\nPrice: $398\n\nBrooks Brothers Field Jacket\n\nNeed a bit of extra coverage and protection? The Brooks Brothers Field Jacket adds a few extra inches onto the hem so you’ve got more length to block out the wind and cold. The cinching at the waist accentuates a slim physique while calling attention to your broad shoulders.\n\nBuilt into the tall collar is a zip-out hood that offers excellent protection against wind and rain. Made from pure polyester, it’s light, wind-resistant, and stylish enough you can wear it to work, out for a date, or around town.\n\nPrice: $298\n\nJ.Crew Field Jacket\n\nJ.Crew designed this field jacket based on the M51 Army-issue jacket that has become so recognizable—and such a well-loved style choice. The addition of a drawcord at the waist lets you adjust it to your physique, and the drawcord at the hem ensures you can cinch the jacket tight to keep out the wind and cold.\n\nThe pure cotton fabric is made with a sateen weave that’s smooth to the touch and has an eye-catching texture that will only grow more beautiful over time, especially with its garment-dyed finish. With two chest and two waist pockets, you’ve also got plenty of storage space for your phone, tools, keys, and other daily essentials.\n\nPrice: $268\n\nBelstaff Fieldmaster Jacket\n\nThe Belstaff Fieldmaster Jacket is built for versatility and functionality both. The six-ounce waxed cotton exterior will shrug off rain and sleet, while the cotton and viscose inner linings will keep out wind and cold.\n\nThe integrated underarm ventilation prevents overheating on warm days, but the high collar, adjustable throat latch, and storm flap all protect you when the days are cool or rainy. Thanks to the reinforcements at the shoulders and elbows, you can wear this jacket over a long day of hard work and know it will more than keep up with you.\n\nPrice: $595\n\nBarbour Sapper Waxed Cotton Jacket\n\nBarbour has a penchant for crafting modern clothing with some serious vintage flare, as seen with their legendary Steve McQueen Rexton Jacket. It’s only natural then, that they pay homage to the military field jacket, a classic favorite for everyday wear on the street. The Sapper Field Jacket features a medium weight 6 ounce waxed cotton exterior with a weatherproof treatment, an assortment of pocket storage, and all the trimmings that make it a win in the field and out.\n\nPrice: $450\n\nBarbour Classic Beaufort Jacket\n\nFor dependable style through fall and winter, there’s long been one brand to turn to for classic British heritage and iconic style — that brand is Barbour, and from the big screen (as seen in “Skyfall”) to your next big cold-weather adventure, they’ve got you covered (literally and figuratively).\n\nSpecifically, the Barbour Classic Beaufort Jacket is a weather-resistant waxed cotton jacket made to get around the city and go in the field in equal measure. It’s got a classic design complete with plenty of pockets for everyday carry essentials — that classic design also lends itself to versatility and plenty of wearability. This is the type of jacket that goes with inky blue denim, a chambray shirt and brown leather boots as well as it pairs with a white Oxford shirt, grey chinos and leather sneakers in equal measure — and we’d wager you’re going to want to try it out as often as you can when the weather takes a turn for the worse.\n\nPrice: $425\n\nOrvis Heritage Field Coat\n\nFor more than a century, Orvis offered some of the best in outdoor apparel. It’s no surprise that they’ve brought back to market the classic field coat, subtly updated for taking on the elements this winter season. Gusseted underarm panels offer superior ventilation for those in warmer climates, while the waxed canvas construction will repel rain, snow, and wind when you need it to most — during the frigid temperatures of the fall and winter. Wear it year after year, it will only become better-looking with age.\n\nPrice: $275\n\nFilson Tin Cloth Field Jacket\n\nLeave it to Filson to deliver consistently, season after season, when it comes to the best men’s style gear and the most rugged picks you can get your hands on. And if you’ve been in search of the best field jacket on the market, you’re in luck, because that’s exactly what the Filson Tin Cloth Field Jacket brings to the table. It’s as tough as it gets, crafted from the brand’s legendary Tin Cloth fabric to stand up to the elements. Pair it with a Filson henley and work pants when the going gets tough out there.\n\nPrice: $465\n\nAlpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket\n\nTake this out into the field with you, and you’ll be ready for anything. The Alpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket is patterned after the classic field jacket worn by the U.S. military, manufactured to military specifications and complete with all the military functions you want and need.\n\nIt’s got pockets enough for anything you want to carry, is incredibly durable, and finished with a wind- and water-repellent coating that will keep you warm and dry through all but the worst storms. The blend of cotton and synthetic fabrics make it both comfortable and highly practical to use for any outdoor or work activity.\n\nPrice: $250\n\nKUHL Kollusion\n\nExpecting heavy rains and cold? Venturing into dense forests or climbing to high altitudes? Then this jacket is the one you’ll want to pack for sure. The KUHL Kollusion is made with a combination of cotton, polyester, and nylon, with a waterproof wax finish that can withstand rain and wind like a boss.\n\nThe waxed finish will actually develop a unique patina as it ages, so each one of these jackets will become a work of art in their own right. The body-mapped fabric will stretch and flex with your movement, and has been reinforced to maximize durability in the areas most prone to wear. With a total of seven spacious pockets—including a dual-compartment left chest pocket—you’ve got all the space you could need for your EDC items.\n\nPrice: $199\n\nTriple Aught Design M-65 Field Jacket\n\nLooking for something that can withstand cold weather, heavy rain, and snow? The Triple Aught Design M-65 Field Jacket is built to do exactly that. Made from sturdy cotton, it’s treated with a C6 DWR finish that “meets light rainwear requirements”.\n\nIt’s built to be a “shell”, so it doesn’t have a lot of insulation (great for layering atop a vest or sweater) but offers excellent wind- and water-resistance. The relaxed fit, bi-swing back, adjustable cuffs, locking waist cinch, and articulated arms all combine to make this one of the most free-moving, work-friendly fields jackets on our list.\n\nPrice: $385 $308"
