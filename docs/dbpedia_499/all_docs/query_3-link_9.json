        "text": "Black Army Jacket\n\nBlack Army Jacket was an American grindcore/powerviolence band. They released one full length album and many 7\" EPs, splits and compilation appearances. Their ex-members can now be found in bands like Hope Collapse, Municipal Waste, Matt Pond PA, Burnt By The Sun and Birds of Prey. The band was started by Andrew Orlando (ex-guitarist of Milhouse and owner of Reservoir Records) and Carlos Ramirez after they met at a Fugazi show on Long Island, NY. They were both fans of bands like Terrorizer, Ass√ºck and Napalm Death and wanted to create a band in those styles."
