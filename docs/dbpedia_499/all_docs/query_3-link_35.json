If you’ll be more active and in a colder environment, you’ll need a jacket that offers warmth without sacrificing mobility.\n\nWhat are the main features of the M-65 field jacket?\n\nAn iconic jacket, this army jacket is wind and water-resistant, has a hood that can be stowed away in the collar, and has excellent insulation. Though no longer in use by the US military, the M-65 is still a quality, reliable jacket that’s guaranteed to give you protection and style.\n\nHow do new military jackets and military surplus jackets vary?\n\nIf they are USGI jackets, they’ve all been designed, made, and tested to military standards; they won’t differ in durability, reliability, or quality. The condition of surplus jackets, however, can vary. While in good usable condition, they may have minor superficial defects such as color fading."
