        "text": "A Muslim woman living in Northern Ireland says nowhere feels safe for many families after recent racist attacks.\n\nJane, not her real name, says rising Islamophobia means parents are afraid to bring their children to play parks during the summer holidays.\n\nSimilar fears have been expressed by a Nigeria-born community worker in Belfast, Israel Eguaogie.\n\nHe said a summer scheme in the city had to be cancelled for security reasons.\n\nThere have been a series of racially-motivated attacks and violent disorder since Saturday, following an anti-immigration protest in Belfast.\n\nJane, who wears a hijab, told BBC News NI nowhere felt safe any more.\n\nâThe prominent narrative has been against Muslims but itâs also people who are visibly different,\" she said.\n\nâVisible minorities - whether thatâs black families, Asian families, anyone with a different skin colour, different accent - I think are thinking twice today about where theyâre going to take their children â¦ even to the park.\n\nâEven in the small regional towns that we havenât heard so much about thereâs been added graffiti, thereâs been things said, thereâs been maybe comments made that have just made people a little concerned â¦ is there anywhere safe in Northern Ireland?\"\n\nJane said some families were considering moving to Scotland, Wales or parts of England where there has not been unrest in recent days.\n\nShe said there had been an escalation in racism in Northern Ireland in recent months, not just the past week.\n\nAt the same time, she said she had been encouraged by offers of support.\n\n\"Donât underestimate the small gestures, the people who have sent messages just saying: âI hope youâre safe, I hope your family are safe', offering to go to the shops with someone if they donât feel safe,\" she said.\n\nâThose neighbourly, beautiful moments.\n\n\"They mean a lot in a period like now.â\n\nMr Eguaogie is involved with a number of organisations including Belfast City of Sanctuary and Diverse Youth NI, and has been in Northern Ireland for 14 years.\n\nHe said the recent trouble had been âabsolutely disgracefulâ and âshockingâ.\n\nâIt has put everybody including myself in a state of fear and panic where people do not know what else to do,â he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.\n\nâYou have lived in a community for quite a long time that has been very peaceful and welcoming and all of a sudden your door is smashed in, thatâs shocking.â\n\nHe said a number of activities planned for young people from ethnic minorities had had to be cancelled.\n\nâWe have had to reassure parents, please keep your children at home and Muslim women should stay at home because they are a target because of the hijab,â he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister said people involved in recent disorder in Northern Ireland were \"causing destruction to their own communities\".\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party Emma Little-Pengelly told reporters at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine that nothing was achieved by violence."
