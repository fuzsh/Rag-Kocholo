        "text": "Make decisions that you won’t regret. Otherwise, bad decisions will come back and haunt you.\n\n1922 is a Netflix film directed by Zak Hilditch based on Stephen King’s novella of the same name. With his farmland in financial trouble and a marriage that is on its last string, a father convinces his son that the only way to solve their problem is to kill his wife. Little does he know of the haunting consequences that surround such a crime.\n\nI love the direction of 1922 and how it's a story based on a letter of confession dealing with the past. While the film is based around a grueling murder, the horror of 1922 is about haunting decisions and how they affect you.\n\nI was very impressed with Thomas Jane’s conniving performance as Wilfred James. Jane is no stranger to Stephan King's films. If someone told me that this was the same actor who played David Drayton is 2007’s The Mist, I would not believe them because Jane’s character contrasts everything about the reluctant hero David.\n\nJane is very convincing, especially his thick southern accent, which makes it tough to understand what he is saying at times. He is in a constant battle with his conscious throughout the entire movie, which makes his appearance a lesson for all who are in the midst of struggling with a decision.\n\nDylan Schmid’s performance as the inwardly fighting good boy, Henry, was very well-acted. Viewers have to look closely as he spends most of his battles inside his head. One of my favorite parts about Schmid is how well he can act like a well-behaved boy who takes to all orders but his face says something very different, wanting to run away.\n\nAlthough Molly Parker’s brief, albeit memorable, performance as Arietta James was short, she was incredible, stinging her husband with her own opinion. Decisions will come back and haunt you.\n\nThere are many incredible performances in this film that are short but create an impact. I especially enjoyed Kaitlyn Bernard as Shannon, Henry’s girlfriend. Meek and quiet, she is also in search of a life of her own with Henry.\n\nAlong with a few other actors to add to the suspenseful drama, a pack of critters joins the cast easily making the viewers feel unsettled. Everything from their loud squeaks, scurrying around in places you don’t want to imagine and infesting the home was nightmarish.\n\nAnd yet, despite the horrible crime he made his own son taken part in, Wilfred still tries to be a good father. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. While they still had rough patches, I liked the scenes between Jane and Schmid. Jane especially had a genuine reaction when his son leaves a note behind that no parent wants to see.\n\nCinematography is outstanding! As a farmer one has the privilege of a fantastic view of sunflowers, an incredible sunset, and grassy fields. I also love the startling music. It is so eerie and makes quite a character of its own. And the shocking make-up is very on point, especially in a couple of creepy scenes involving Molly Parker.\n\nThe second half of the film lagged. It has already made its point but continues on with viewers witnessing Wilfred beat himself down for his decisions. I also feel that scenes with Henry and Shannon in the latter half of the were unneeded. Audiences could have easily interpreted on their own what their outcome turned out to be.\n\n1922 is an eerie and well dramatized Stephan King adaptation. Now you’ll think twice about your decisions. Find it on Netflix now."
