        "text": "Buster Keaton: The Blacksmith and The Paleface - Digitally Remastered Heralded as one of the great stars of American cinema, Buster Keaton often wrote, directed and starred in his own productions. He was best known for his silent films and his early shorts stand as a testament to his budding creativity and talent. \"The Blacksmith,\" from Keaton and collaborator Malcolm St. Clair, follows a hapless blacksmith as he attempts to repair cars and shoe horses. In \"The Paleface,\" the iconic funnyman stars as Little Chief Paleface, the leader of a Native American tribe who must defend his land against greedy oil barons."
