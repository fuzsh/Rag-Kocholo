        "text": "A century ago, Danish filmmaker Benjamin Christensen released his first horror picture. The 105 minute movie called “Häxan” is considerably ahead of its time.\n\nIt’s a mix of documentary styled narration (placards since its silent) explaining the history and evolution of witchcraft. What’s unique is the interwoven dramatized scenes that are dispersed throughout.\n\nDemons, Witches, and the Devil himself\n\nThe movie is divided into seven parts; each serving as a lesson in historical times, beginning with the concept of demons in Ancient Egypt. Benjamin Christensen, who also stars in the film as The Devil himself, was an innovative force. His mastery of cinematography in a time devoid of effects and editing is marvelous. Considering 1922 isn’t old – it’s ancient. I would love to have had the opportunity of picking his brain.\n\nModern audiences won’t be scared. This film should be viewed with an appreciation of cinematic and horror history. But the bones for fright are there. Some of the scares are unintentional. Just watching people from one-hundred years ago can be a bit chilling. And the ambiguous nature of several scenes is creepy.\n\nThe color palette Benjamin Christensen uses to film with are seemingly otherworldly. One scene depicted a cauldron of witches flying in the night sky and it was really cool. And I was shocked to discover actual jump scares – one of which got me.\n\nYou will have to watch it on mute. The score is ludicrous and kills any scary moments in a way my filmmaking brethren from the ’20s so often do.\n\n“Häxan” isn’t the type of thing you curl up on the couch to watch with your significant other. But it would be perfect to have on in the background at a Halloween party. On mute, of course. It has chilling moments and characters. And would serve as an excellent conversation piece.\n\nKudos to Benjamin Christensen for crafting a unique horror film.\n\n“Häxan” is available to watch on YouTube here.\n\nSupport the Site: Consider becoming a sponsor to unlock exclusive, member-only content and help support The Movie Buff!"
