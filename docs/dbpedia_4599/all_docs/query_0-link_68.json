        "text": "STEVENS: Taken together with The Boat, the period encompassing The Paleface, Cops, and My Wife’s Relations clearly represents a problematic time in Keaton’s career, presumably traceable to his troubled marriage to Natalie Talmadge (or, as Keaton insisted, his marriage to the entire Talmadge clan). Whatever difficulties Keaton encountered in his personal life seem to have impacted on the films in both positive and negative ways. It is striking how Hard Luck, which deals with suicide and a failed relationship, has an extremely upbeat tone, whereas The Boat, which deals with a happy marriage, is notable for its atmosphere of confinement, disappointment and directionlessness.\n\nIf the problem with The Boat is that it is assembled from material which is, on the whole, ideologically innocuous, and which Keaton does not subject to any kind of sustained challenge, his following short, The Paleface, has precisely the opposite problem. The ideological material out of which it is fashioned is so complex and riddled with contradictions that Keaton doesn’t have a hope of assembling it into a coherent shape.\n\nIn a touch which testifies to his growing confidence as a filmmaker, Keaton delays the introduction of Buster by approximately three minutes.\n\nSALLITT: Yes, this is the first time he used this kind of conventional movie introduction, isn’t it? I wonder if maybe he was starting to feel the desire to work in a more conventional narrative mode. The Boat shows more narrative coherence than any of the previous shorts (with the possible exception of One Week), and even The Playhouse felt like a little movie, albeit one that emphasised location and mood over story.\n\nSTEVENS: The opening scenes depict the plight of Native Americans with surprising historical accuracy, showing “oil sharks” conspiring to rob an Indian tribe of their land. Once the tribe’s chief learns of this, he orders his warriors to “Kill first white man that comes in that gate”. The first white man to appear is, of course, Buster, carrying a butterfly net — the absolute embodiment of innocence. Yet (and here is where the ideologically contradictory nature of Keaton’s material starts to kick in), he eventually manages to trick his captors into believing that he is impervious to fire (he has actually created some asbestos underwear), and adopting him as a member of their tribe. So Buster’s innocence is a very American kind of innocence, the kind described by Robert Stone in his novel A Hall of Mirrors (1967): “In all situations we must and shall display an innocence so vast and awesome that the entire world will be reduced by it. American innocence shall rise in mighty clouds of vapor to the scent of heaven and confound the nations!”\n\nThe Native Americans stalk Buster in exactly the same manner as the cops of his next film (and several of his previous films). Buster is the individual constantly in opposition to the group, and it makes little difference (at least initially) whether this group is representative of the authoritarian tendency, or one of that tendency’s most notable victims.\n\nThe Paleface’s second half, in which Buster joins the tribe and helps them defeat the oil sharks (“Us Indians must stick together”), is quite splendid.\n\nSALLITT: No doubt there’s some silliness in the depiction of the Indian tribe that doesn’t play so well today… but Keaton’s timing and use of shot length is wonderful in the first part of The Paleface. Of course, there’s the delicious way he draws out his first appearance, knowing that the audience knows who is going to walk through that gate. But I also love those droll shots where Keaton’s obsession with the butterfly looks momentarily like evasive action or confrontation with the hostile tribe — especially that extreme long shot in which Keaton stalks toward the butterfly on Big Joe’s head, with several long moments of stasis before all hell breaks loose. And then there’s the wonderful gag sequence in which Keaton toys with the Indian who doesn’t realise that Keaton has pulled the stake he is tied to out of the ground. Keaton cuts to close-ups of the Indian and of himself, as if some meaningful exchange between them is going to occur — and then cuts back to long shot for the sudden, hilarious conclusion.\n\nThat forty-five degree gravel slope that Keaton descends is one of his most staggering natural locations. He puts the camera very, very far away, and then makes sure that he bounces high enough into the air during his descent to register on the camera as a frantic speck instead of a calm one.\n\nFor me, the second half isn’t quite as inventive as the first. But I still think the film is a pretty good effort.\n\nSTEVENS: What is really striking about this short is the casual manner in which Keaton tackles material that would still be considered “daring” almost 30 years later (Broken Arrow [Delmer Daves, 1950]) and even 70 years later (Dances With Wolves [Kevin Costner, 1990]). Here, Buster not only throws in his lot with the enemies of American imperialism, he actually enters into a romantic relationship with an Indian woman (something that sits rather oddly alongside the fear of miscegenation expressed in Seven Chances). It is important to note that Buster does not marry the “Indian squab” (as he refers to her in an intertitle). Quite the contrary: we see Buster and the woman start to kiss. An intertitle reading “Two years later” appears. The following image returns us to the previous image: Buster and the woman are still kissing. They pause for breath… then resume the kiss. Buster has here entered into what we might describe as a long-term relationship, but one based entirely on sexual passion. The affair is neither transitory, nor subject to those frustrations Keaton associates with marriage.\n\nKeaton’s attitude towards the ways in which his society accommodates heterosexual desire is clarified by his next two films. In Cops, the object of Buster’s love is shown to be a cold-hearted capitalist interested only in his money — no need to wait for years of marriage to corrupt this relationship! In My Wife’s Relations, Keaton goes even further, showing Buster getting married purely as the result of a misunderstanding. The conversation between Buster and his “beloved” that appears at the start of Cops is framed in such a way that Buster, seen through the bars of a gate, appears to be inside a prison, while the marriage of My Wife’s Relations is depicted as akin to a prison sentence (which is what the bride and groom initially believe the judge is handing out) — the film’s happy ending has Buster heading off to Rio for a divorce, as if he were a convict escaping from jail. The link between romantic love and marriage is totally severed. Keaton has thus gone full circle, reviving the ethos of the Roscoe Arbuckle films, which portrayed romantic relationships as wonderful and marriages as ordeals… but reviving it as part of an explicitly oppositional project, rather than as a problem to which the films can propose no solution. If Arbuckle encouraged us to believe (against all the evidence he presented) that his happy young lovers who can’t wait to marry each other will not turn into yet another of these films’ ubiquitous unhappily married couples, Keaton goes out of his way to demonstrate the opposite. Taken together, The Paleface, Cops and My Wife’s Relations suggest that heterosexual desire can only be sustained outside the institution of marriage (and, indeed, outside of “civilised” society).\n\nCOURSODON: The starting point in Cops is a typical Harold Lloyd-type situation: Boy must “succeed” in life in order to win the girl. Buster, though, goes about it very differently from Lloyd. First an unexpected stroke of luck: he comes into some money (stolen money, actually — but isn’t capitalism based on theft?). However, he immediately invests most of it unwisely, buying cumbersome goods (the furniture of a family who’s moving) for which there is no apparent market. Moreover the purchase is an act of charity — not a wise move when you’re aiming to make a fortune (millionaires become philanthopists only after they’ve made their fortune). Then, in order to dispose of the purchase he must make an extra investment, buying a horse and cart… This entire first section of the film is structured around the circulation of money and mistaken identity or misidentification (and the opening shot is a typical Keatonian misleading setup: Buster is behind bars — but they’re only the bars of a garden iron gate). The mistakes are deftly articulated: the man in the taxi cab thinks he has retrieved the money, but it’s only the empty wallet; Buster thinks that the crook is the owner of the furniture and that the horse and cart are for sale; the actual item for sale (a jacket) was hidden by the horse and cart, echoing the deceptive framing of the opening.\n\nCops has some of Keaton’s most striking use of space — urban space in this case. Empty, Chirico-like streets suddenly fill with hundreds of uniformed cops in pursuit of Buster. The cart with its pile-up of furniture is a wonderfully incongruous sight amid the marching policemen… And as usual there is a nice balance between amazing acrobatics and sly little touches — like the two men simultaneously peering into the bottomless trunk from which Buster has just escaped, or Buster going back into the doctor’s house to retrieve his hat.\n\nThe film is full of great gags, some of which have been analysed to death by a number of French writers — see the boxing glove gag (which I discussed at length in my book, challenging some of the claims in a semiological analysis).\n\nSALLITT: There’s a precise shade of dark humour in the early scenes of Cops that I find delicious. It’s balanced precariously between innocence and cruelty, between harmlessness and harmfulness. First there’s the theft: it starts from the familiar convention that the victim, Big Joe Roberts, deserves to lose his money. But Buster is obviously a practised pickpocket — look at the surreptitious gesture with which the wallet emerges from his sleeve! And, given Big Joe’s nastiness, Buster’s guilt is nil. No more is said about his shady past — but the pickpocketing joke is much funnier because this bit of moral turpitude comes out of nowhere.\n\nCOURSODON: And the scene where he picks up Roberts, puts him in the cab, then pulls out the wallet from his sleeve is done in one shot, as if to prove that Keaton has actually picked the man’s pocket… However, whether he is a practised pickpocket or not is largely irrelevant because the comic hero doesn’t have a backstory. His past is a blank slate. He begins existing when each new film begins.\n\nSALLITT: And then there’s the family who loses everything they own. They exhibit no Big Joe-style nastiness to justify the loss — and, to counterbalance this, Buster does not know he is stealing. But there’s still cruelty in this situation, and Buster taps into our latent antisocial side to sharpen the laughs.\n\nCOURSODON: Destruction of property is a constant of silent comedy. Usually it is not perceived as a more or less dramatic loss the way it would be in real life (or serious drama) either because of the unreality of everything, or because the victim somehow “deserved it” (as in the case of Roberts and his wallet). Keaton takes a chance by creating a comparatively realistic situation — a family is moving — and making the (future) victim nice instead of a villain. When the cart load collapses and the furniture is destroyed the viewer may feel a pang of sympathy for the moving family — but then the father is revealed as the chief of police, and thereby becomes the hero’s nemesis together with the other cops. A clever juggling act.\n\nSALLITT: The scenes where both Buster and the pater familias watch each other load the furniture, assuming that the other is helping selflessly, are filmed in a long shot that lets the tension build, and is increasingly funny precisely because the interaction remains completely friendly. Finally, the family, thinking Buster to be an expressman, gives him their new address. Uncomprehending, Buster looks at the card and throws it away! The joke is that the gesture can look both completely innocent and utterly cruel, depending on the context we give it. As we can already gather from the way that Buster “packs” the family’s vase in a suitcase, things won’t go well for the property owners.\n\nYou mentioned the sense of space in the film — it is so beautiful that I stop laughing sometimes just to marvel at it. I especially love the stately procession of the horse-drawn wagon, with Buster trying to take a nap while the deep-focus city unscrolls in the background.\n\nThe hundreds and hundreds of cops that are the film’s gimmick are a reflexive element, a communication between Keaton and his audience: everyone knows that silent comedy cops are for chasing, so here is the biggest chase of all! I think of Cops as Keaton’s North by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, 1959), in a way: his attempt to take a simple entertainment form to a heightened level of interest through formal audacity and reflexivity.\n\nThe grim ending doesn’t seem to be a true expression of a dark worldview: it’s so purely a narrative twist, abbreviated and telegraphic. I think Keaton felt some desire at this point in his career to push the boundaries of comedy audiences, to see how much he could challenge their expectations and still make them laugh.\n\nThere’s something about My Wife’s Relations that appeals to me, and I always root hard for it, but I can’t avoid feeling that long sections of it (the whole second half, mostly) aren’t interesting enough. I wonder whether Keaton felt that the tenement setting was too depressing for audiences, and so contrived to move the family to posh uptown digs.\n\nCOURSODON: Well, it’s not really a contrivance. The structure of the film is a shift from Buster’s mistreatment to a sudden reversal of attitude from the family when he is thought to be about to inherit a fortune, then back to the original mistreatment when it transpires that it was a mistake. His being sent on a quest for a mansion worthy of a millionnaire echoes Natalie’s and her mother’s and sisters’ insistence that Keaton acquire a magnificent residence. He bought their palatial home on South Ardmore Avenue in April 1922 — the very month he shot My Wife’s Relations. And the mother and sisters moved in with them because they wanted to be near Natalie during her pregnancy.\n\nA few words about Keaton’s matrimonial situation: From the beginning, it seems there was something a bit “off” in the marriage. Keaton hadn’t seen Natalie for two years (in New York he had been an occasional guest of the Talmadge sisters and their mother) when he apparently got a letter from her saying that she was available. (Her two sisters were famous actresses and now both married; Nate had flopped as an actress in small parts in her sisters’ films, and she was bored and anxious to marry, too.) In February 1921 Variety announced their engagement — then a month later said it was off. They were finally married in May in Bayside, Long Island, at the house of the aforementioned Joe Schenck, Norma Talmadge’s wealthy producer husband who would become Keaton’s own producer and later nemesis…\n\nConstance called the marriage “a mail-order romance” and the Talmadge clan, if not Schenck himself, seem to have looked down upon Keaton as a lowly comedian (although he had made a string of outstanding and very successful two-reel comedies in 1920, they don’t seem to have recognised Keaton’s genius or appreciated his talent), someone somewhat “inferior” to them socially and artistically — but still, somehow, acceptable for poor Natalie.\n\nNatalie’s main occupations at the time seem to have been shopping and autographing Constance’s fan photos. As I said, when she became pregnant her mother, Peg, and her recently divorced sister, Connie, moved into the Keatons’ house to take care of her. Soon after, Schenck and Norma moved The Constance Talmadge Productions from New York to Hollywood so the entire clan was on Keaton’s back. “The walls were bulging,” he said…\n\nShortly before the baby arrived, Natalie decided to move to a large twenty-room mansion — apparently Keaton was not consulted. And there you roughly have the background to My Wife’s Relations.\n\nSALLITT: I perversely like the tenement scenes in the film, partly because I like the audacity of setting a comedy in such an unattractive environment. The film could be taken as one long ethnic slur against the Irish, but at least the slur isn’t gratuitous: the family’s unpleasantness is central to the film’s concept.\n\nCOURSODON: At this time in America, the Irish were still widely considered somehow “inferior” — like all ethnic groups, but Keaton seems to be portraying the crudeness and vulgarity of “the lower classes” rather than the Irish proper… There’s one specific dig at the Irish in the gag where Buster, in order to be able to eat some steak (everybody has been grabbing the food before he has a chance), pulls out a leaf from the wall calendar, turning Thursday into Friday. As good Catholics (apparently their only positive quality) the family members then abstain from eating the meat.\n\nSALLITT: Some of the jokes at the dinner table — the choreographed spearing of the dinner meat, dumping the coffee into the sugar bowl — are quite funny. Best of all is the slightly unnerving scene in which the ostensibly sleeping Keaton revenges himself on his wife with a series of quite violent blows. The wife’s comeback, leaving Keaton for dead with shards of broken glass on his face, concludes the sequence in a satisfying way: the battle is not one-sided\n\nNext: The Blacksmith, The Frozen North, & Daydreams"
