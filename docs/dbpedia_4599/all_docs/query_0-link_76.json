        "text": "Despite the many announcements of its death, the western has recently reappeared in American cinema and literature, reinvigorating a tradition that spans from James Fenimore Cooper’s Hawkeye to the Lone Ranger and John Wayne. Among the many recent productions, this volume considers American films, literature, and music, produced between 1985 and 2011: movies such as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Roberto Ford, The Ballad of Little Jo, Brokeback Mountain, 3:10 to Yuma, Don’t Come Knocking, the TV series Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman, the novels Blood Meridian, God’s Country, and hick-hop music. Matching western, men’s, literary, and film studies, Bordin reads the western as a gendered cultural product, which comments on pivotal contemporary themes such as issues of fatherhood, homosexuality, gaze, and race and gender appropriations. Building upon Judith Butler’s notion of the performative nature of gender, Bordin analyzes how the western interacts with models of American masculinity, confirming the genre’s crucial role in the American cultural and ideological landscape at the turn of the new millennium.\n\nThis article outlines the historical conditions surrounding the reception of the first cycle of talkie Westerns produced by Hollywood studios from 1929 to 1931. While these films have largely been treated by contemporary scholarship as merely descendents of silent Westerns and crude forebears of the genre’s later sound-era classicism, this article removes them from that teleological trajectory to situate them within the historical debates surrounding the transition to sound. By highlighting the generic designation ‘outdoor film’ and linking it to the notion of ‘natural’ sound that formed a key point of the marketing for sound on film systems, this article provides a listening model for understanding the varied aesthetic strategies by which these films worked out an approach to sound within the ideological constraints of the classical Hollywood studio system.\n\nThe two great comedians in the history of cinema, Charlie Chapin and Buster Keaton, embody the two extremes of comic excess. Despite their contemporaneousness, Chaplin and Keaton produce opposing forms of comedy, and in this way, they show how comedy can emerge through exclusion from the social order or through that order’s internal contradictions. Chaplin embodies exclusion, while Keaton exposes an internal excess within society.\n\nIn the mythology of the American West, range wars pitted ranchers against farmers, insiders versus outsiders, each struggling to control access to land, each fighting to preserve the freedom and opportunities that first drew them to the frontier. The film, Boys Don't Cry (2000), set on the contemporary Plains and based on actual events, tells of insiders and outsiders who attempt to claim a place. The individuals at the center of the film challenge symbolic fences and attempt border-crossings as they struggle to construct and live with their identities. Plains citizens are depicted to erect and police societal fences, denning who belongs in this landscape and who does not, a parallel to the mythic conflict between ranchers and farmers. Common to all these range wars are debates over masculine identity. The film constructs a Plains landscape that is once again frontier, spatially as well as metaphorically.\n\nThis licentiate establishes the conceptual and methodological foundation for a doctoral thesis on how film creates and sustains a symbolic universe. Rather than addressing the ultimate thesis problem, the purpose of this licentiate is to lay the groundwork for that project. It introduces and examines the film Unforgiven as the empirical data, and it locates Unforgiven in the genre and tradition of the Western film. The licentiate has five subsidiary purposes: 1) it discusses the theoretical and methodological perspective of symbolic interactionism; 2) it describes and examines the Western genre in film and earlier media; 3) it proposes a basic typology for the Western film; 4) it presents a synopsis and overview of the film Unforgiven, and 5) it reviews the literature on Unforgiven, extracting key themes to establish the thematic taxonomy that permits a robust analysis of the film."
