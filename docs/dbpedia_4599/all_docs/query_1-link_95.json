        "text": "Being a lifelong fan of the horror genre, F.W. Murnau’s Nosferatu is a film that has been firmly lodged in the “must-watch” area of my mind for many years. My personal taste in horror was primarily founded on the infamous ‘Hammer Horror’ films in their 1960s iterations. Their mastery of Gothic darkness and tone, coupled with their overtly campy styling, gave them a particularly seductive quality. I remember fondly, sitting transfixed by the awesomely intimidating Christopher Lee, blood-dripping from his lips, eyes burning with ferocity, and relishing in the physiological rush that I had previously never known existed. This enjoyment progressed into the more mature Horror cinema of the 1970s; from the macabre Wicker Man (not the hilariously atrocious Nic Cage version), to the palpable violence of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the disturbing satanic musings of films like The Omen and The Exorcist (I had a very liberal upbringing!). The shared defining factor in what continued to draw me to these films was their meticulous creation of brooding atmosphere, their intelligent building of tension and their well-crafted ambient and musical soundscapes. In the proceeding decades, these characteristics seem to have been abandoned for gore-porn and cheap scares (cue loud violin scare as the camera pans around a darkened room…yawn). So, when Andrea chose Nosferatu as her 1920s selection, I was most eager to sit back and gain a deeper appreciation of what spawned the decades of film that I love.\n\nNosferatu: A Symphony of Horror belongs to the same German Expressionist movement as the previously discussed Metropolis, albeit several years earlier. It acts as an adaptation of Bram Stoker’s infamous 1897 novel Dracula, but, due to not being able to gain copyrights, the screenwriter Henrik Galeen figured, like any good pioneers would, ‘bollocks to that nonsense’, changed a few names and just made it anyway. Nosferatu appears to be an archaic word derived from the Romanian Nesuferit meaning “offensive or “troublesome” (I suppose being attacked and drained of blood would be fairly troublesome.) Understandably, the Stoker estate found this rather irksome; subsequently a court order called for all copies to be destroyed. Luckily, some sneaky member of the production or distribution process must have hidden copies, as the film survived and, as most controversial things tend to, started enjoying strong underground popularity, becoming one of the earliest cult films in the process.\n\nThe idea and production of the film was brought into being by a most fascinating character, a German artist and occultist named Albin Grau. Under the moniker of Master Pacitius, Grau was a high-ranking member of the German magical order “The Pansophia Lodge”, a Rosicrucian order which (without becoming too sidetracked) became “Fraternitas Saturni” in 1925 after a dispute with occultist extraordinaire and general madman Aleister Crowley – which also lead to Grau severing ties with the lodge.\n\nGrau was inspired to shoot a film focused on vampirism during his service in The First World War, in which a Serbian farmer recounted to Grau how his father was an undead vampire, as one is want to do. Creating Prana Film in 1921, Grau was responsible for much of the visuals and tone of the film, enlisting the help of director F.W. Murnau to bring his vision to life. Prana Film was intended to continue producing an array of supernatural and occultist films, but, due to their aforementioned copyright shenanigans, the studio went bust, leaving Nosferatu as their one and only title.\n\nThe film begins as any good Gothic horror should: in a tumult of church organ and dusty calligraphic scrawls. After setting the appropriate mood, the film introduces us to our antagonist Thomas Hutter (Jonathan Harker from Dracula) and, well, where to even begin? If there is one thing about the film that depreciated my enjoyment of it, it was this character. I suppose what Murnau’s direction was going for was a sort of pompous naivety in the character, but, the ludicrously German sounding Gustav von Wangenheim, imbued the role with a jarring gay abandon, reducing the character at times to little more than a man continuously caught between incredulous bafflement and guffawing buffoonery. By comparison, it makes Keanu Reeves’ much maligned depiction of Harker in 1992’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula almost praise-worthy. Apparently von Wangenheim appeared in over 200 films in his lifetime, so I’m sure the guy had acting chops, but in this particular instance, the performance was just too overindulgent to ignore.\n\nMy hatred of Hutter put aside, the film proceeds to show his relationship with his wife Helen (someone has to love that smile I guess), whom he dotes on by bringing her flowers and generally just being a swell guy. Hutter then sets off to work, and we are introduced to the first notion that not all is well in the world of Wisborg (the fictional German setting). We are introduced to Knock, estate agent and Hutter’s boss, and, let’s just say the guy is at least mildly concerning…\n\nKnock informs Hutter that “His grace the Count Orlok from Transylvania” wishes to purchase a property in the era and that Hutter has to go visit him to get the papers in order. He suggests to Hutter that he “…might have to go to a bit of trouble…a little sweat and maybe…a little blood…” This is no concern for as daring a dandy as our Hutter however, who characteristically throws back his head in rapturous laughter, for some reason.\n\nHutter informs his beloved that he must travel far away to “the land of thieves and phantoms”, which, I can’t decide whether is a not-so-subtle gibe at Romanians, or, is just supposed to sound ominous – decide for yourselves. Hutter entrusts his wife to the care of his wealthy friend, because, God knows, she wouldn’t be able to survive without Hutter’s daily charm and witty conversing. Thus, Hutter sets off on his grand journey, eventually making his way to The Carpathians and finding himself at a local tavern, run by an innkeeper with one of the most impressive fake moustaches in cinema history.\n\nEverything is jovial, until Hutter, being the pampered little swine that he is commands the proprietor to “Quickly! Bring me my dinner! I’m on my way to Count Orlok’s Castle!” Cue the murmured shock and glances-over-shoulders! Clearly these simple village folk know something we do not! The innkeeper then informs Hutter that he can’t go any further, as there is a “Werewolf” roaming about. Hutter responds in his usual fashion – laughing manically – and agrees to stay the night.\n\nSo Hutter tucks himself into his totally normal elevated bed and proceeds to scare himself by reading a book entitled Of Vampyres Terrible Phantoms and the Seven Deadly Sins. This scene is interspersed with shots of the frightened villagers hearing the fearsome werewolf, which is puzzlingly a Hyena, prowling the wilds. In the morning, enlisting the help of the locals, Hutter heads off towards the Count’s castle. They stop at a mountain pass, the locals, superstitiously refusing to go any further. So Hutter leaps down, slinging his luggage over his shoulder and nonchalantly wanders into the wild like an olden days Bear Grylls. Some of the more cinematically beautiful shots are during Hutter’s time traversing the hills and forests of Transylvania (these scenes were actually shot in Slovakia), and when juxtaposed with the proceeding scenes, which take place in the castle, serve to further the sense of oppression and claustrophobia that such an environment calls for.\n\nAs Hutter haphazardly meanders around getting progressively more lost, he hears a carriage approaching. The phantasmagoric carriage is one of the more charming practical-effect driven devices used during the film. The carriage and horses are draped in heavy cloth, presumably to give a Gothic, funeral procession type feel. This is quite impactful, but, in doing so, clearly affected both the visibility and maneuverability considerably, as the carriage often veers off-road into the treeline, and seemingly had to move so cautiously, that the entire sequence was sped up in order to give the impression of them hurtling along – which was most enjoyable to be fair. They also decided to have a section of the scene displayed in its negative form to add extra spooooookiness.\n\nHutter, obviously, hitches a ride with the ghoulish horseman and heads up to the castle. It is here that we first encounter Max Schreck in instantly recognisable guise as the bizarre Count Orlok. I shan’t go into the debate regarding whether the way that the Count is portrayed is deliberately anti-semitic or not. I neither have the credentials, nor the platform upon which to do so effectively. If such critical debate interests you, then there are myriad sources out there to fuel such interest, please feel free to do so. What I shall say, however, is that the design of the character is extremely effective at instilling a sense of deep unease in the viewer. The use of such extensive makeup and prosthetics, runs the risk of rendering the character ineffective, almost pantomime-villain, but I feel they achieved the necessary degree of balance with the visual representation, and, along with Schreck’s contorted, inhuman movements, Orlok enters the realm of Freud’s ‘Uncanny’. Familiar, yet unfamiliar, eerie, even slightly obscene, there are obvious reasons why the visage of the character is still ingrained into our consciousness almost 100 years later.\n\nThe scenes within the confines of Orlok’s castle are easily the best and most visually atmospheric of the film. Murnau expertly plays with light and shadow in a manner that exquisitely befits the Gothic nature of the narrative. It is here that one begins to fully realise the enormity of the eventual influence Nosferatu would have on the horror genre and film as a medium. These sections of the film would go on to spawn a legacy of reverence and imitation, and effectively aided in solidifying the hallmarks of Gothic horror; the single Gothic setting; the dichotomy of dark and light – both visually and thematically; the claustrophobia; the burgeoning and swelling of atmosphere and ominous elevation of dread as the tension builds. All of these elements are at play here, building upon one another to culminate in a crescendo of sensation. These are the moments that cement the film’s place in the canon of cinema, these are the moments that one thinks about upon mention of Nosferatu.\n\nThe story essentially progresses in line with the plot from Dracula from hereon. If you are unaware of that plot, which I refuse to believe possible, here is the briefest of summation’s: Hutter, after being bitten, falls ill and then subsequently escapes the castle and is picked up by members of a local convent. Orlok, meanwhile, boards a ship, in order to reach his newly purchased home. Whilst on the ship, he feeds on the crew, wiping them out before the ship docks at Wisborg. Here, he moves into a house neighbouring Hutter’s and, using his vampiric wiles, attempts to seduce Mrs Hutter, before Hutter returns and Orlok is defeated by succumbing to sunlight (I told you I’d be brief). The film dilutes the full plot of Dracula somewhat by omitting the Van Helsing character and Ellen Hutter (Mina) has a much more direct role in the demise of Orlok. The nature of vampirism also seems to be changed somewhat from Bram Stoker’s incarnation, in that Orlok’s victims all die, rather than become vampires themselves. The implications of this are that Orlok becomes a far less romantic character than Dracula himself. He becomes a harbinger of death and decay, demonstrated most acutely by his frequent transformation into writhing masses of rats and the notion that the town’s population are all being overcome by plague.\n\nOverall, I am happy that I finally took the time to sit down and watch Nosferatu. It deserves its place in the annals of film history, and has many moments that perfectly encapsulated what I expected of it. In some respects I did feel rather conflicted however. The film is split into three acts, and the first and third are much weaker than the middle scenes showcasing the initial contact with Orlok. Galeen’s Expressionist influenced screenplay and Grau’s imagination are allowed to flourish when the film is about imagery and atmosphere, but become considerably less powerful during the cohesive narrative parts of the film. Schreck’s performance as Orlok is as eerie and as culturally impactful as I had hoped, I just wish we had seen more of it, rather than the infuriating galavantings of Hutter.\n\nOne other thing I failed to mention, but is of great importance, is the score. The score is understandably a vital element in a silent film, and, as I alluded to in my introduction, can have a profound effect on the success of a horror film as a whole. Unfortunately, the score on the version we watched was really not strong enough for the ideas and concepts trying to be conveyed. I’m not sure if this was the original score, or if it was one added at a later date – the history of the film’s music was rather confusing. In scenes that were clearly supposed to be dark and brooding, there are these weirdly out of place, almost comedic sections of music, that very much downplay the menacing nature of Orlok at times. There are various pieces that sounds, at least somewhat intentionally ominous, even menacing, but in general, the soundtrack was just all over the place, and detracted from the overall feel of the film, which was a great pity. Andrea theorised that maybe the film would have been far too scary for people if they had also included a genuinely scary score, perhaps she is right! Hutter’s theme was incredibly annoying however, so at least that was effective.\n\nI think, in summation, the late great Roger Ebert described this film most aptly: “It doesn’t scare us, but it haunts us”, and, as a fan of horror, that is the kind of sensation I endeavour to be left with – a haunting unease. Despite the few niggling annoyances I have, I would still recommend checking the film out, if not for pure cinematic enjoyment, then at least for the profoundly endearing performance of Orlok and to see the blossoming of cinematic techniques that still pervade into the cinema of today."
