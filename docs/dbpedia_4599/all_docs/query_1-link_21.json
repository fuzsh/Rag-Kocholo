        "text": "“1922” is a movie that gets under your skin. It maintains a menacing vibe from start to finish without ever relying on overused gimmicks or formulas.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 24, 2022\n\n1922 unsettles more than it scares and seeks to be a slow-burner, which is refreshing but it is marred by the tedious pace. '1922' is also too character-driven for its own good.\n\nFull Review | Mar 9, 2021\n\nFor those King fans who know nothing is more horrifying than the horrors of man, 1922 delivers a mix between There Will Be Blood and Edgar Allen Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart, featuring Jane at his darkest and most disturbing.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Apr 22, 2020\n\nFor fans of King, ghost stories, and small-scale cinema, 1922 is a real gem.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Dec 9, 2019\n\nAlmost unanimous praise aside, I will say that 1922's final chapter does run a tad too long...but what it does capitalize on is the root and themes of King's best works.\n\nFull Review | Sep 10, 2019\n\n1922 works well as a physical representation of the guilt that consumes the protagonist. [Full Review in Portuguese]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Sep 3, 2019\n\nThe premise of 1922 isn't as instantly catchy as Gerald's Game or as flashy as It, but the adaptation is successful - I could hear Stephen King's voice coming through loud and clear.\n\nFull Review | Aug 26, 2019\n\nIn cinemas, it might have been overshadowed by flashier rivals, but perhaps, on demand, this slow, but winningly bleak little tale will find the audience it deserves.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Aug 26, 2019\n\nIt is a tale of human guilt, divine consequence, and good old fashioned King-ly horror, with a performance by Thomas Jane that only solidifies his standing as a leading actor who Hollywood continues to underappreciate.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 26, 2019\n\n1922 is a compelling and gripping look at murder, the act and the aftermath, and its simplicity helps propel it in to one of the most sophisticated Stephen King cinematic adaptations.\n\nFull Review | Aug 26, 2019"
