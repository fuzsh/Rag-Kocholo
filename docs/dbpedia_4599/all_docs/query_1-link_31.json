        "text": "This year, the undisputed, er, king of Stephen King adaptations was Andy Muschietti’s IT: a lovingly-crafted slice of Eighties nostalgia with a colourfully menacing villain and a host of showy supernatural scares. Netflix’s 1922, an original production for the streaming service from Australian director Zak Hilditch, is a different beast altogether: small and outwardly unremarkable, yet furtively disturbing, a little like the rats that scurry through it as both motif and source of horror. In the grand and wildly varied canon of King adaptations, it’s no showstopper, but it’s certainly not a turkey either.\n\nAt heart, it’s a grim story, plainly told. Nebraskan farmer Wilfred James (Thomas Jane) looks back at the year he murdered his wife, and – in time-honoured fashion – failed to prosper from his deed. Based on the King novella of the same name, and set against a wide backdrop of open skies and whispering cornfields, it’s primarily about guilt and regret, and about the “conniving” stranger hiding inside ordinary men and women, driving them to unspeakable crimes.\n\nThe reason it works so well, in large part, is down to Jane (who also starred in Frank Darabont’s similarly compelling King adaptation The Mist). The actor spends the entire duration of the movie speaking in an exaggerated rural drawl – an attempt, he has explained in interviews, to recreate the original, uncorrupted regional accent of Nebraska. The effect of this could easily have been ridiculous. The rest of the cast (including Molly Parker as James’s wife Arlette and Dylan Schmid as son Henry) are all perfectly convincing, after all, but no one else has gone to quite the same lengths.\n\nInstead, however, the accent works, making us think of James as a man married to his land, whose roots go deep, and whose farming background is in his blood. The voice belongs with his fields, and the sky – and it’s this unshakeable inner love, ultimately, that leads him to his crime.\n\nArlette has inherited land from her father and plans to leave her husband, taking their boy with her to the city, and depriving James of the chance to expand his land and leave it to his son. Perhaps the most evil thing he does, in his desperation and greed, is to bring his child in on the crime, exposing the 14-year-old to the taint of murder.\n\nRather amusingly – but then again, when did Netflix movie categorisations ever make sense? – the film is classed among the service’s “Scary Halloween favourites”. A jumpy, enjoyable seasonal treat this – emphatically – is not. The gorier scenes, in which Arlette’s body is consumed by rats that then symbolically “haunt” the increasingly disturbed James, are certainly effective. But 1922 is ultimately more about inner horror than it is jump scares.\n\nLike Netflix’s other recent King adaptation Gerald’s Game, it’s also worth seeking out on its own merits. In cinemas, it might have been overshadowed by flashier rivals, but perhaps, on demand, this slow, but winningly bleak little tale will find the audience it deserves."
