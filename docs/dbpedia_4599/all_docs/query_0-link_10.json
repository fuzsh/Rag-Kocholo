        "text": "The Paleface is a Buster Keaton comic western, in which Buster is sentenced to death for trespassing on Native lands.\n\nI’d sort of been dreading this one, based on the name alone, assuming it wouldn’t have aged particularly well (it has not aged particularly well). I wasn’t expecting it to be quite so tedious and jokeless though.\n\nThere’s a few bits of good classic Buster here, with possibly the best “getting onto a horse” joke in his repertoire, and a section where he falls down a hill for a minute or so, but mostly I found it slightly wearying, to be honest.\n\n___________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched this on blu-ray again. The screenshots are from this slightly shorter version on youtube.\n\n2. Also hooray, I am actually up to 1922 now.\n\n3. Finally doing my job.\n\n4. It’s strange, though, how, with each passing year it feels like I’m catching up to now a bit more.\n\n5. Despite 100 years ago always being 100 years ago.\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information"
