        "text": "We are lucky to be able to watch Nosferatu for a variety of reasons. We are fortunate because it was one of the first vampire movies, and had a great influence on the direction of future vampire stories. It is also a fine example of German Expressionism, a movement that created a look that would be imitated by other horror movies, and even thrillers and film noirs.\n\nHere I speak my personal opinion, but I think we are lucky to have Nosferatu because it is the first and best adaptation of the Dracula story on screen, and I would even go so far as to say it is the best vampire movie ever made. It managed to combine entertainment with artistic quality in a way that is frequently lacking in vampire films.\n\nHowever the most important reason that we are fortunate to be able to see Nosferatu is that we nearly did not have the movie saved for posterity at all. The movie was made by Prana Film, who did not take the trouble to obtain permission from the family of Bram Stoker, author of the original book.\n\nAfter making this one film, Prana dodged copyright infringement laws by declaring themselves bankrupt. The Stoker family responded by ordering that all copies of Nosferatu should be destroyed. Thankfully they were not, and Nosferatu has survived long enough to be watched nearly a hundred years later.\n\nDespite a few name changes, the story is essentially the same as that in the book. The events of the film are told with images and the use of intertitles, as with most silent films. Here the intertitles are presented as if they are a historian’s account written later, an early example of a film that tried use realistic methods to tell a fantastic story.\n\nA clerk called Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is employed by a disreputable employer called Knock (Alexander Granach). This twisted and fiendish man is at the centre of ugly rumours concerning his character, none of which rumours are disclosed to us.\n\nKnock asks Hutter to go on a journey to meet a client who wishes to move to a house opposite that of Hutter. “You will have a marvellous journey. And, young as you are, what matter if it costs you some pain–or even a little blood?” Knock explains.\n\nThe journey is to a place in the Carpathian Mountains, and as Hutter approaches, there are a number of warning signs. The customers of an inn warn him not to go out after dark, as this is when the spirits are stronger. A wolf scares off Hutter’s horses and he is obliged to take a room for the night. Here he finds a mysterious manuscript called ‘The Book of the Vampires’ which discusses the birth of a mysterious being called Nosferatu:\n\n..and it was in 1443 that the first Nosferatu was born. That name rings like the cry of a bird of prey. Never speak it aloud…Men do not always recognize the dangers that beasts can sense at certain times.\n\nHutter laughingly dismisses the book and continues on his journey. However as he approaches Nosferatu’s castle, the coachman refuses to go any further, saying this is the ‘land of phantoms’. Instead another sinister carriage emerges, led by a driver whose face is swathed in cloth.\n\nThe driver takes Hutter to the castle where he meets his host, Count Orlok (Max Schreck). This hideous phantom of a man greets Hutter amiably, but shows a disturbing interest in an injury where Hutter draws blood, and in a picture of Hutter’s wife: “What a lovely throat!” Orlok comments. It soon becomes clear that this mysterious Count of nocturnal habits is Nosferatu, a vampire, and Hutter wakes with bite marks on his throat.\n\nHutter escapes from the castle, but Nosferatu travels to Wisborg to take up the residence opposite the Hutters, and it is clear he has designs on Ellen Hutter (Greta Schröder). Ellen reads The Book of the Vampires, and realises that Nosferatu can only be defeated if a pure woman offers her blood freely to the vampire and keeps him there until daylight.\n\nThis is one respect in which Nosferatu anticipates later vampire stories. Whilst daylight only weakened Dracula in Stoker’s original novel, it kills vampires in this movie, and the same convention has been observed in vampire movies ever since. Other tropes such as crucifixes, garlic, holy water and a stake to the heart will have to wait for later Dracula movies.\n\nThe scene also hints at the eroticism that would later become a part of vampire stories. The idea of an undead male biting on a woman’s neck has given the vampire story a sexual frisson that has been capitalised on by almost all writers of this sub-genre ever since.\n\nIn Nosferatu this possible sexual undertone is very vague because Nosferatu is not in any way a physically attractive vampire. Later Draculas would be charming, theatrical and good-looking. Nosferatu is a creature that is frightening and repellent. In make-up Max Schreck’s appearance is nightmarish and ugly, so much so that a 2000 movie was made offering a fictional account of the making of Nosferatu, in which the other characters were afraid that Schreck really was a vampire.\n\nNosferatu is a bringer of plague and rats. He even looks diseased. He does not create new vampires with his bite. He only kills victims. Soon after Nosferatu arrives in Wisborg, the plague follows him, and we see lines of coffins in procession along the street.\n\nImages of death surround Nosferatu. The clock in his home marks time with a skeleton. He sleeps in a coffin, and he needs earth from his home with him at all times. This leads to one of the movie’s many sinister images, as we watch the newly-arrived vampire walking the streets of Wisborg at night carrying his coffin under his arm.\n\nHe not only brings plague and death, but madness too. The presence of his master drives Knock insane. The estate agent is placed in an asylum where he sits feeding on insects. When Knock escapes from the asylum, his malignant presence, laughing at the citizens from rooftops, causes him to be scapegoated for the sickness affecting Wisborg citizens.\n\nIndeed Nosferatu resembles a cadaver himself. His features are desiccated and pale, and his movements are twisted and ungainly as if the rigor mortis of death had set into his limbs before he began to walk again.\n\nThere is also something of the animal in Nosferatu’s appearance. He is thin and bald, with large bat ears and white eyes. In contrast to later vampires, his fangs are at the front of his teeth like those of a rodent. His hands are like claws, and we see the shadow of them reach out towards his victims. Indeed Nosferatu’s shadow dominates the movie, most notably in a famous sequence where we see his shadow climbing the stairs to visit Ellen.\n\nThe movie lacks a strong hero to counterbalance Nosferatu. Hutter is barely able to escape from Orlok’s castle alive, and he seems helpless in the face of his new neighbour. Professor van Helsing appears in the movie, but his role is smaller. He is no vampire hunter here, but his studies of polyps and the Venus fly trap show us other weird creatures that prey on others. Like many movie scientists he is a Jack of all trades, and can even operate as a medical doctor.\n\nIt is left to Ellen to make the necessary sacrifice that will kill the vampire. Ellen seems like a doomed character from the start. Dressed in black like a widow, her melancholic personality contrasts with the laughing features of her husband. Ellen is given to premonitions when something bad is happening. When Hutter is menaced by Nosferatu, she begins sleepwalking on her balcony, and her cries seem to deter the monster from harming her husband.\n\nAfter his arrival in the neighbouring apartment, Nosferatu seems to beckon to her from his window. She accepts his offer and destroys the vampire but at the cost of her life. The final ending is downbeat, but the plagues does end as a result of her actions.\n\nF W Murnau, the movie’s director, does take the time to cover one of the book’s more memorable events which is often omitted from later Dracula adaptations. I can only assume that the later moviemakers felt reluctant to have so dramatic a scene too early in the film, which is a pity as the scene is genuinely haunting.\n\nThis is the scene where Nosferatu travels to Wisborg on board the Demeter. This unhappy ship travels with its evil cargo on board, and the crew begin to die from a mysterious plague. This is traced down to the mysterious coffin-shaped box in the hold, but before a crew member can open it, the lid flies off and Nosferatu rises, his rigid body elevating as if by magic.\n\nAnother camera shot taken from below shows Nosferatu lurching across the schooner. The position of the camera makes Nosferatu look even more menacing. The scene ends with the sight of the ghost ship, with nobody left alive on it, sailing into port. These images are cross-cut with scenes of Hutter and Knock, showing how different events in the movie are related to one another.\n\nCross-cutting was a rare technique at this time, but Murnau uses it on a few occasions in this film. For example, Nosferatu’s visit to Hutter’s chamber is intercut with scenes of Ellen sleepwalking and calling out, giving the impression that a psychic link connects the two incidents.\n\nHorror movies were in their infancy at this time, and we have none of the jump-scares that have punctuated the genre ever since. There is a hint of what is to come in the fact that characters often occupy the edge of the screen rather than the centre, just as they occupy the fringes of our imagination.\n\nIs Nosferatu still frightening today? Was it ever frightening? This is hard to say. People were not used to any kind of horror movie when Nosferatu first came out, and it was sufficiently scary to get banned in Sweden until 1972.\n\nNowadays Nosferatu does not seem frightening. The established conventions were not yet in place, and it does not talk the same language as the horror movies we are used to seeing. However if Nosferatu does not terrify us, it does have the ability to freeze the blood. The film is packed with disturbing and memorable images that stay with the viewer for a long time. How many of today’s fear-inducing horror movies can do that?"
