        "text": "ALFRED HITCHCOCK has shamelessly reverted to an old story and to the cinematic style that made him famous in the Thirties with his new film, \"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\" Yet those who recall his early pictures made in England—including the one that had the same theme and tag as this one—will not be distressed by this news.For Mr. Hitchcock contrived some lively thrillers with his formula of mystery and suspense, and he made international intrigue popular when it was getting an evil name. He virtually educated critics in the techniques and refinements of the \"chase.\"So it shouldn't distress his ardent public to learn that he has cleverly combined his old style and modern screen processes of VistaVision and color in his new picture, which is at the Paramount.The story is lean and fluid. An American family—father, mother and young son—are sightseeing in Marrakesh, Morocco (this is where the scenic stuff comes in), when suddenly a Frenchman is murdered in cold blood before their eyes. Dying, the Frenchman whispers a cryptic message to the man, who happens to be a doctor. This makes him the man who knows too much.That's the beginning of the mystery. The \"chase\" follows close on its heels when the son is kidnapped by a British couple who pretend to be traveling friends. And the suspense is henceforth accumulated as the father and mother fly to London to seek their son, who they realize is being held hostage to keep the father from revealing what he knows.We wouldn't dare tell you what follows in the way of an international plot to assassinate a foreign prime minister at a symphony-choral concert in Albert Hall. And we wouldn't even tell you the import of the knowledge the father has. Suffice it to say that Mr. Hitchcock spins a fast tale that sweeps incongruously through a taxidermist's shop, a cultist chapel, a foreign embassy and the crowded concert hall.Fast, did we say? It better had be, for the story that John Michael Hayes has revamped from the original script of Charles Bennett and D. B. Wyndham-Lewis is quite absurd, and it would be death to leave the audience a moment to stop and think. But logic and credibility were never Mr. Hitchcock's long suits. He depends upon daring deception. And that's what he has in this film.James Stewart tops his job in \"Rear Window\" as the man who knows too much, and Doris Day is surprisingly effective as the mother who is frantic about her child. She also has a dandy sequence in which she signals to the boy with a song. Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie are properly creepy as the British couple who snatch the boy, Christopher Olsen is good as the latter and Reggie Nalder merits a shriek as the man with the gun.Even in mammoth VistaVision, the old Hitchcock thriller-stuff has punch.\n\nTHE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LIUCH, screen play by John Michael Hayes, based on a story by Charles Bennett and D.

Yves BrainvilleLIST \"While the City Sleeps,\" which was exposed at the Criterion yesterday, as another shiny, sometimes over-dramatic illustration of the movie-makers' love of the newspaper \"game.\"Since it is full of sound and fury, murder, sacred and profane love and a fair quota of intramural intrigue, a viewer is left wondering if the tycoons of the giant Kyne publishing combine ever bother to cover such mundane stories as the weather. But while this journalistic jamboree is more flamboyant than probable, a tight and sophisticated script by Casey Robinson and a clutch of professional performances make \"While the City Sleeps\" a diverting and workmanlike fiction.The title of this excursion to the scenes of crime and communications is a misnomer. No one dozes at The New York Sentinel or its news services. A young and obviously disturbed killer dispatches a comely lass. The publisher, who wants the story played big, suddenly goes to his reward and his playboy son takes over by dangling the offer of a top job to four of his executives. The idea is that it will go to the gent who helps to crack the case.The flower of romance also flourishes in the busy city room. The paper's Pulitzer Prize star reporter goes for the syndicate chief's secretary. That suave operator is hand-in-glove with a designing sob sister. And, the young publisher's beauteous and leggy wife is cozy with the syndicate's photo service chieftain.As has been noted, this dizzying course of crime and caresses can be distracting, and the winner of that executive plum, an observer feels at the film's conclusion, is bound to become an ulcer case. It's not really important, though.Although they are enacting variants of familiar roles, the performers do justice to their assignments: Dana Andrews, as the handsome, realistic and cynical Pulitzer Prize man; Sally Forrest, as his girl; George Sanders, as the polished but conniving syndicate chief; Vincent Price, as the publisher; Rhonda Fleming, as his two-timing spouse; Thomas Mitchell, as the managing editor; John Barrymore Jr., the \"mama's boy\" who likes to kill blondes as much as he adores comic books, and Ida Lupino, as the amorous sob sister.Director Fritz Lang has kept things moving at a lively clip. And, while the long arm of coincidence seems a lot stronger here than the arms of the law and journalism, \"While the City Sleeps\" is likely to keep the customers awake.\n\nNewspaper StoryWHILE THE CITY SLEEPS; screen play by Casey Robinson; based on the novel \"The Bloody Spur\" by Charles Emstein; directed by Fritz Lang; produced by Bert Fricdlob and presented by R.

Sandy WhiteROSSANA PODESTA, who ignited a war in the title role of \"Helen of Troy,\" inflames a little old Mexican village in general and two Mexican fugitives in particular in \"Rosanna,\" which came to the World yesterday.In this Mexican-made drama (with English voices dubbed in), she doesn't breathe fire like some of the tempestuous, earthy Italian screen queens. But with the signorina it's not the acting—it's the architecture.The story is simple. One of the villagers sums it up: \"One woman, two men, means trouble.\" There's a scarcity of dialogue, too. Quite often the camera concentrates on shots of the ocean waves crashing against the rocks, and on closeups of the two fugitives, portrayed by Crox Alvarado and Armando Silvestre, and, of course, the signorina.It all adds up to a slight suspense story. But it does emphasize that, if Marilyn Monroe is the girl most likely to thaw out Alaska, the Antarctic Chamber of Commerce ought to seek out Rossana Podesta."
