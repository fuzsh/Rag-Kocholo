        "text": "Ho. Ly. Shit. What a goddamn movie this is! Shot with noirish brilliance by the legendary Gabriel Figueroa, Victims of Sin is 300 pounds of brutality and emotion packed into a magnificent 90-minute bag, all built around a spectacular performance by Ninón Sevilla.\n\nSevilla plays Violeta, a woman who refuses to be beaten down either by her life or the men in it, fighting — physically, when necessary — for survival with a riveting ferocity. She is astonishing character, and Sevilla embodies her with complete abandon, embracing every emotion with absolute commitment, and infusing her dances with an athleticism and knowing sensuality that make it impossible to take your eyes off her.\n\nThe first time Violeta performs at La Maquina…\n\nVictims of Sin or Victimas del Pecado is the kind of gritty, at-times-fun, melodramatic wallop to the senses I live for. Part of the niche genre where Mexican filmmaking adapted and absorbed the film noir tendencies, this film presents nearly ten different musical numbers interspersed between a swift but endearing gangster plot line that revolves around the existence of a baby. The one swaddled, whining soul disturbs the equilibrium of the Changó nightclub where the desperate mother and ruthless, evil father abandon the child in order to maintain a reputation that will sustain them both. Yet, a Rumba dancer with a heart of gold saves the child to raise as her own--the only individual willing to take on her liveliness and the additional…\n\nGabriel Figueroa is considered one of Mexico's best cinematographers during their Golden Age (época de oro) of cinema (1940-1959), and in VICTIMS OF SIN (Víctimas del Pecado, 1951) his camera captures the tequila shots, the cigar smoke, and the low lights of the nightclub life so observantly, you can practically smell and taste the scene. Now that's mise-en-scène.\n\n\"We are making realism\", states actress Ninón Sevilla in an archival documentary cine de rumberas from 1984. A Cuban-Mexican actress and dancer, who so popular at the time, that she internationalized the icon of the rumbera character on film, and has one of her more important roles here with director Emilio Fernández. VICTIMS OF SIN is in many ways similar to the…\n\nWhere has this film been all my life! I blind bought it during the recent Criterion- Barnes & Noble sale. It's like finding a gem! Cuban born Mexican actress Ninón Sevilla stars as Violeta, a dancer forced to walk the streets performing the oldest profession. Sevilla really knocked my socks off. I was immediately transfixed by her beauty and presence. She's both tough as nails and heartbreakingly vulnerable. What a star!\n\nI was no less impressed with director Emilio Fernández. He packs a lot in just 84 minutes. The chiaroscuro cinematography is stunning. Most of the film takes place at night. The contrasting of light and the dark is so beautiful. It'd be a shame to watch this as a bootleg.…\n\nNew 4K restoration\n\nIt's melodrama to the highest degree, but I think that there's also a lot to be admired about how Victims of Sin speaks to the plight of the impoverished, especially at the hands of rich men who think the world is at their command. To no one's surprise, the men are mostly horrible - the women are the ones with the most responsibilities looking out for the people around them, even when they know that their own stature where they are would be put at risk as a result of what they do. But the way that Emilio Fernández makes it clear that this is a film about the human spirit, especially given the film's title, is…\n\nPart neo-noir, part melodrama, part dance film, all perfection. I love movies about how brutal the world is, how impossible it can feel to try and be a decent person and survive, and yet they still offer a tiny glimmer of hope that helps you keep going. The characters are beautifully drawn, within moments of meeting them you get a rich sense of who they are as people that allows them to subvert expectation or fulfill those initial assumptions. The story takes wild turns I wasn’t expecting, boldly going there at every turn — some absolutely brutal moves for 1951 that rocked me to my core.\n\nWorld-building is at top-tier here. There aren’t a ton of locations, but they’re all…"
