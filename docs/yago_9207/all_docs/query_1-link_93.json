All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.\n\n‘EL INDIO: THE FILMS OF EMILIO FERNÁNDEZ’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through March 13). In an appraisal of a Mexican noir retrospective at MoMA in 2015, J. Hoberman, writing in The New York Times, quoted the director Emilio Fernández as saying, “There is only one Mexico: the one I invented.” But MoMA’s new series on Mr. Fernández, perhaps the best-known filmmaker from what is often called the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, suggests that his onscreen Mexico was incredibly varied. “Enamorada” (Friday, and March 10 and 12) begins as a sort of western set during the Mexican revolution before turning into a variation on “The Taming of the Shrew” after a rebel leader (Pedro Armendáriz) falls for the daughter (María Félix) of a man he had arrested. In a darker register, “Salón México” (Sunday, and March 9 and 13) centers on a nightclub worker (Marga López) who struggles, Mildred Pierce-like, to save money for her younger sister. She finds the prospect of salvation in a sympathetic, widowed police officer (Miguel Inclán). Both films were shot by the great Gabriel Figueroa, Mr. Fernández’s frequent cinematographer.\n\n212-708-9400, moma.org\n\n‘NEIGHBORING SCENES: NEW LATIN AMERICAN CINEMA’ at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (through March 4). The highlights of this annual series include “Gabriel and the Mountain” (Saturday), based on the true story of a Brazilian tourist — a friend of the director’s — which earned two prizes at last year’s Critics’ Week in Cannes, and “Lightning Falls Behind” (Sunday). Set in Costa Rica, it centers on a pair of teenage girls who discover a body in the trunk of a car.\n\n212-875-5601, filmlinc.org"
