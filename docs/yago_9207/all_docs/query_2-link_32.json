        "text": "Between 1945 and 1947 Emilio Fernandez, the director ofclassics like Maria Candelaria (1943a) and Flor Silvestre (1943b) and Mexico's most significant auteur, made two films with Hollywood studio RKO: La perla/ Pearl (l946a) and The Fugitive (Ford1948a). Through analysis of these films and their production context,as well as insights gained from the production files, this article will attempt to shed new light on the role Fernandez and these inter-American films played both in Hollywood's postwar mission in the United States, Mexico and Latin America and in Mexico's own national industry.\n\nThis paper contributes to the debate on racialized and deracialized representations of the category of indigeneity in Mexican cinematography during the Golden Age (1935–1959) as a response to the post‑revolutionary nation‑building project. Based on the analysis of representative movies of that period, I argue that the cinematography reflected indigenista public policies, aimed at homogenizing the society by incorporating indigenous people to the society as Mexicans. Insofar as the state narrative displaced the notion of indigeneity towards the “past” – as a foundation of the national cultural heritage – movie industry romanticized and exoticized the indigenous, but at the same time, it portrayed indigenous characters as submissive and even obsolete, thus perpetrating the colonial archetype of oppression. Images situated in the present, however, rejected any ethnic differentiation, and instead replaced it with a class‑based model of social interactions, but in reality the “raceless” ...\n\nSince it began in the 1970s, feminist film theory has revolutionized the way that films and their spectators can be understood. This book focuses on the groundbreaking work of Laura Mulvey, Kaja Silverman, Teresa de Lauretis, and Barbara Creed. Each of these thinkers has opened up a new and distinctive approach to the study of film and this book provides the most detailed account so far of their ideas. It illuminates the following six key concepts and demonstrates their value as tools for film analysis: • the male gaze • the female voice • technologies of gender • queering desire • the monstrous-feminine • masculinity in crisis. Shohini Chaudhuri shows how these four thinkers construct their theories through their reading of films as well as testing their ideas with a number of other examples from contemporary cinema and television. She concludes that the concepts have not remained static over the past thirty years but have continually evolved with the influence of new critical debates and developments in film production, signalling their continuing impact and relevance in an era that is often unthinkingly branded as ‘post-feminist’."
