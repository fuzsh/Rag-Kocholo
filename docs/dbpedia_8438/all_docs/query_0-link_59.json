        "text": "The charm of Malawi doesnâ€™t solely rely on hospitality. Malawi's mix of cultures - drums, dance, masks and languages - continue to fascinate visitors. Locals welcome the interest in their daily life and few visitors will leave without experiencing some of Malawi's traditional elements. Many Malawians are descendants of the Bantu people who migrated to Malawi across Africa for hundreds of years until the 15th century. Malawi is home to more than 12 different ethnic groups, each of which is represented by unique traditional dances, rituals and arts and crafts. The largest ethnic group is the Chewa, whose mother tongue, Chichewa, is predominantly spoken in Malawi.\n\nMasks are commonly used in various dances and ceremonies, but these are usually specific to the ethnic group with the most known being the 'Gule Wamkulu' performed by the Nyau of the Chewa. Malawian dances have a deeper meaning than superficial ones and have therefore been handed\n\ndown to the present day as part of Malawi's cultural heritage.\n\nMany visitors fondly mention that the highlight of their journey to Malawi was the Malawians they met in the villages and at the markets. And many return because they feel Malawi is their second home. Wewelcome you with all our hearts. Come and visitMalawi, the Warm Heart of Africa.\n\nThe official language of Malawi is English, but the national language is Chichewa\n\nwhich is spoken particularly in the south and central regions of the country. In the north,\n\nChitumbuka is the most widely spoken language. There are many other languages,\n\nincluding Yao, Ngoni and Nyanja. Chichewa is classified as a Bantu language, which\n\nincludes almost all languages spoken in sub-equatorial Africa, including 40 languages\n\nindigenous to Malawi. Many Bantu languages share a common pronunciation, grammar\n\nand a closely related vocabulary and speakers of other Bantu languages such as Swahili,\n\nShona and Zulu can recognize many similar and identical words in Chichewa. English\n\nis the official language in education, and Malawians in urban areas speak English\n\nfluently. Even in rural areas, people rarely encounter the linguistic communication\n\nbarriers found in other African countries.\n\nMalawians are, by and large, honest, conservative, good-humored, and\n\nmild-tempered. They tend to be quiet and are always smiling. The Malawian\n\ntraits of discipline, hard work, and perseverance come from a long tradition\n\nof strict social discipline that is imparted from birth. Children in Malawi\n\nlearn to fear and respect elders. These attitudes are implanted at different\n\nstages of life, but the most important time for this is at puberty, when both\n\ngirls and boys undergo community counseling. For strangers, this strict\n\ndisciplinary code translates into warmth and helpfulness. Visitors are\n\nwelcomed with open arms, offered meals and, where necessary, a typical\n\nMalawian village as a community will host or help a total stranger. The\n\nlegendary hospitality of Malawians is well known to people who have\n\nvisited or worked in Malawi.\n\nSince 1994, Malawi has been a multi-party democracy. The President is both head of state and head of government, elected by universal suffrage every five years and can serve up to two terms. The Cabinet is appointed by the President and executive power is exercised by the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the National Assembly,\n\nwhile the judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches. Local government is exercised in 28 districts within three regions, with administrative officers and district commissioners that are appointed by the central government. People aged 18 and above have the right to vote.\n\nGULE WAMKULU\n\nGule Wamkulu was initially performed by members of the Nyau brotherhood which is a secret society of initiated Chewa men, at the request of the village chief around the 17th century. In modern times, it is mainly performed at funerals and memorial services, and also at celebrations such as chiefs' inaugurations, weddings and after the harvest.\n\nVIMBUZA\n\nVimbuza is a dance performed to heal mental illness as part of traditional healing and is\n\npopular among the Tumbuka people of northern Malawi.\n\nTCHOPA\n\nTchopa is a dance practiced by the Lomwe community in southern Malawi. It is commonly performed in celebration of a good harvest or successful hunting, or during dedications to ancestral spirits after calamities such as drought or disease outbreaks.\n\nMGANDA\n\nMganda has its origins in the system of military parades and musical bands introduced to Nyasaland (now Malawi) by British officers of the Kings' African Rifles (KAR) during\n\nthe colonial period."
