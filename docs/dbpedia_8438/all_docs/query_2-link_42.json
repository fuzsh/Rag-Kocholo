        "text": "by Erwin Van der Meer\n\nEvil spirits and demonic forces are very real issues today. Van der Meer reflects on how the Church in Africa has responded and action steps to move forward biblically.\n\nIn the traditional African worldview there are many evil spirit\n\nforces that make life unsafe and are understood as the main threat to\n\nhuman prosperity and health (Lagerwerf 1987, 5ff; Pretorius 1987, 127).\n\nThese evil powers typically work through people who are in allegiance\n\nwith them (Imasogie 1993, 63) and are identified as witches, sorcerers,\n\nwizards, or Satanists (Imasogie 1993, 63; Khathide 2007, 338; Van\n\nBreugel 2001, 211ff).\n\nHowever, since the term “witch” (mfiti) is most commonly\n\nused as a generic term for all of these, I will use this term in the\n\nrest of this article. In Malawi, there are newspaper articles on a\n\nregular basis about witchcraft, Satanism, magic, and demonic activity.\n\nWhile some beliefs may appear to be irrational and many of the\n\nsupernatural events can be explained by science, at times they seem to\n\npoint to genuine supernatural activity of a malicious nature. The\n\nquestion for the missionary, missiologist, and Christian worker in such a\n\ncontext is: How do we respond appropriately to the fear of witchcraft\n\nand the evil supernatural in the African context?\n\nThe Traditional African Worldview in Malawi\n\nThe traditional African worldview understands the spirit world and the\n\nmaterial world as constantly interacting. Events in the material world\n\naffect the spirit world and vice versa. From an evangelical Christian\n\npoint of view, we may assert that neither the Western modernist nor the\n\nAfrican worldview is fully correct. Nevertheless, the African worldview\n\ndoes agree with biblical teaching that the spiritual world affects the\n\nmaterial world and vice versa. However, biblical teaching disagrees with\n\nthe African worldview about what kind of interaction takes place.\n\nIn Malawi, the witch is believed to work in alliance with evil\n\nspirits to cause disease, misfortune, or death by means of evil magic. A\n\npeculiar feature in Malawian witchcraft belief is that witches are\n\nthought to spiritually eat their victims (this first part is believed in\n\nmany parts of Africa) and also the physical bodies of their victims in\n\ngraveyards after they have died (Van Breugel 2001, 213-216).\n\nUnderstandably, this greatly contributes to insecurity, fear, and\n\nanxiety. Anyone in Malawi who takes time to go beyond superficial\n\ncontacts and looks under the surface will discover that most Malawians\n\nfeel exposed to evil supernatural attacks. A Malawian media analyst\n\ndescribed Malawi as a country full of fear of witchcraft (Zingani 2005,\n\n15). In 2008, an article appeared in a national newspaper under the\n\ntitle “A Witchcraft-Infested Society” (Chandilanga 2008, 4-5).\n\nProtestant Christian Responses to Witchcraft\n\nThere have generally been two responses to witchcraft: the modernist response and the Pentecostal response.\n\nThe modernist response. The most common response to\n\nwitchcraft and other African traditional beliefs among missionaries in\n\nthe colonial era was labelling witchcraft as superstition and therefore\n\nof no consequence. This response, influenced by the modernist worldview\n\nof the time, basically ignored and trivialized the African fear of\n\nwitchcraft and evil supernatural powers as superstition. The belief was\n\nthat it would gradually disappear when people were properly educated\n\n(Burnett 2003; Isichei 2004, 286; Khathide 2007, 340-342; Onyinah 2002,\n\n107-108). Consequently, when African people expressed their fear of\n\nevil spirits, witchcraft, or other evil supernatural forces, many\n\nmissionaries denied the existence of evil spirits and magic rather than\n\nclaim the power of Christ over them (Hiebert 1982, 41). Not only liberal\n\nChristian missionaries, but also many conservative missionaries\n\noperated from the same modernist paradigm.\n\nUnfortunately, this approach did not meet the pastoral need of\n\nthe African believers, who urgently sought deliverance from what they\n\nperceived as harassment by evil spirits, curses, and witchcraft. As\n\nChristianity did not appear to have a solution for the problem of\n\nwitchcraft, many Africans continued to seek assistance from the\n\ntraditional healers and diviners (Hiebert 1982, 39; Khathide 2007, 32;\n\nLagerwerf 1987). In spite of improved education and continuing church\n\ngrowth in Africa, witchcraft is one of the most enduring and pervasive\n\nelements of African traditional religion in the twenty-first century\n\n(Isichei 2004, 285; Onyinah 2002, 108ff).\n\nThe Pentecostal response. Not all Western missionaries\n\nignored the reality of the evil supernatural. Pentecostal missionaries\n\ntended to take the African concerns seriously and identified the spirits\n\nas demons, and magic and witchcraft as the work of demons. People who\n\nwere harassed by spirits were prayed for and demons were cast out in\n\nsometimes elaborate exorcism sessions, while charms and similar\n\nparaphernalia were burned (Hackett 2003, 61ff).\n\nInstead of telling Africans that their earlier superstitions were\n\ncrippling and should be abandoned, Pentecostals affirmed that there was\n\nindeed a spiritual reality underlying the African fear of the spirits.\n\nThey also taught and demonstrated the delivering power of Jesus Christ\n\nin prayers for healing and exorcism (Clark 2001, 83). From a pastoral\n\npoint of view, the Pentecostal approach was more relevant to the African\n\nthan the modernist approach.\n\nNevertheless, the tendency to label almost all African\n\ntraditional practices as demonic and satanic (Onyinah 2002, 111) fails\n\nto deal with the issues underlying the outward forms of witchcraft and\n\nAfrican traditional religion. This tendency to demonize other cultures\n\nand religions can still be observed in the writings of C. Peter Wagner\n\nand other strategic level spiritual warfare proponents and hinders\n\ngenuine contextualization of the gospel in Africa (Van der Meer 2009,\n\n125, 185, 221, 229ff, 263ff).\n\nNowadays, almost all churches in Malawi include exorcistic\n\nactivities, often called “deliverance ministries.” Failure to offer such\n\nservices means losing members to other churches that do provide such\n\nspiritual help. Some scholars refer to this phenomenon as the\n\nPentecostalization of Christianity in Africa (Onyinah 2002, 111).\n\nThe Problem of Syncretism\n\nThe introduction of a personalized Devil and the association of the\n\nspirits of the African traditional religion with demons to some extent\n\nauthenticated and strengthened the belief in witchcraft (Onyinah 2002,\n\n111).\n\nIn many cases, this led to a syncretism between Christian and\n\ntraditional beliefs and practices. One can find African pastors,\n\nbishops, prophets, or apostles who do exactly what the diviners did\n\nbefore Christianity came. By means of supernatural revelation, they\n\nallegedly diagnose illnesses (including spiritual afflictions and\n\ncurses) and reveal hidden sins (Strohbehn 2005, 55-56).\n\nThe same method is used to sniff out the witches and sorcerers,\n\nbut often innocent people are accused and punished. The main problem is\n\nthat the alleged “supernatural insight” of the pastor, prophet, or\n\ncharismatic leader takes the place of the Bible as the source of\n\nrevelation (Oosthuizen 1979, 22). The well-documented life and ministry\n\nof the “Christian” spiritual healer Nchimi Chikanga in Malawi is a good\n\nexample of such a Christianized diviner and witch-finder (Soko 2002).\n\nIn some parts of Africa, such practices have led to “Christian”\n\nwitch hunting, including torture and murder (Bourdillon 2002, 11). Some\n\n“prophets” have publicly accused people of witchcraft without any\n\nevidence (Hoskins 2004, 59). This is a powerful means of social control\n\nwhich instills fear in church members and keeps them behaving well, but\n\noften denigrates into psychological or other abuse (Hoskins 2004, 59).\n\nIt is not uncommon for pastors to demonize colleagues who appear\n\nmore successful. This may take the form of the former accusing the\n\nlatter of being in league with the Devil (Hackett 2003, 67ff). In\n\nMalawi, I have personally witnessed such accusations being made to\n\npastors within the evangelical Church. This form of Christianity is not\n\nso much focused on the crucified Christ or obedience to the risen Lord\n\nas it diminishes Jesus as yet another powerful name used magically\n\nwithin an African traditional religious framework.\n\nWe must heed Paul Hiebert’s caution that while taking the evil\n\nsupernatural seriously, we must also guard against Christianity itself\n\nbeing adapted into a new form of magic (Hiebert 1982, 45ff). Ironically,\n\nboth the modernist and magical approaches reflect a mechanistic\n\nworldview—a formula approach to reality that allows humans to control\n\ntheir own destiny—the modernist based upon scientific formulas of\n\ncause-and-effect in accordance with natural laws and the magical based\n\nupon a spiritual formula in accordance with presumed spiritual laws\n\n(Hiebert 1982, 45ff; Lowe 1998, 148-151; Van der Meer 2009, 207).\n\nIn genuine religion, we strive to obey the will of God, for we\n\ntrust in him. In magic, we seek our own wills, confident that we know\n\nwhat is best for ourselves (Hiebert 1982, 46). It is therefore mandatory\n\nthat as a missiological community we find ways and means to address the\n\nproblem and fear of witchcraft in the Malawian context and beyond.\n\nBiblical Considerations\n\nIf we consider the point of view of the Bible writers concerning evil spirits,1\n\nwe see that they affirm the existence of such evil supernatural forces\n\nin the form of Satan and the demons, but without the sense of fear which\n\nis so prevalent in Malawian society. Neither does the Bible affirm the\n\nexcessive supernatural powers attributed to evil spirits or their human\n\nallies such as Satanists, witches, and sorcerers. Here are some biblical\n\nexamples.\n\n• The Job account affirms that Satan, when allowed by God, can at\n\ntimes exercise great power in order to harass and even kill people,\n\nusing either what we would term “natural disasters” or by raising up\n\nother humans against them. Relegating all demonic miracles and power\n\ndisplays to psychological factors and delusions is to ignore biblical\n\nteaching, notwithstanding the fact that a lot of what passes for\n\nmiracles and supernatural events may indeed be trickery and deceit.\n\n• The confrontation between Moses and the magicians shows that\n\nthe latter were able to perform extraordinary feats, such as making\n\ntheir staffs turn into snakes (Ex. 7:11-12) and turning water into blood\n\n(Ex. 7:22).\n\n• In the New Testament, Simon the sorcerer performed amazing\n\nmiracles that held people in awe (Acts 8:9-11). Nevertheless, Satan can\n\nexercise power only within limits set by God (Job 1:12, 2:6).\n\n• Jesus teaches that nothing happens outside of God’s intimate\n\nknowledge and control—not even a small bird falling from the sky (Matt.\n\n10:29).\n\nIn the African context, it is essential that we stress biblical teaching on issues related to witchcraft in\n\nBible\n\nstudies, sermons, and literature. In theological training, witchcraft\n\nbeliefs must be addressed from a biblical, church historical, and\n\ncontextual perspective, preferably interactively in discussion groups,\n\ncase studies, and field research.\n\nWitchcraft beliefs are a serious pastoral problem. In the\n\ncommunity, even in the church, people live in fear and suspicion of one\n\nanother. Problems, inefficiencies, corruption, and sin are often not\n\naddressed outside of a fear standpoint. Conflict is avoided at any cost\n\nas supernatural revenge is feared by the potential whistle-blower (Van\n\nBreugel 2001, 230-231). The fear of witchcraft is also detrimental for\n\nsocietal progress and the development of a community and country\n\n(Lagerwerf 1987, 40).\n\nIf the Church learns to respond to the witchcraft beliefs and\n\nfears effectively, then it can make an enormous difference in Malawian\n\nsociety. Besides teaching and preaching, we should:\n\n• offer special prayers for protection;\n\n• offer counseling, combined with prayers of exorcism for those who experience demonic harassment; and\n\n• encourage songs, stories, and testimonies which stress the supremacy\n\nof Christ to counter the often unsubstantiated stories which stress the\n\nevil power of witchcraft and Satanism.\n\nBattle Not against Flesh and Blood\n\nScripture stresses that our battle is not against flesh and blood, but\n\nagainst the spiritual powers (Eph. 6:12). In order to counter\n\nwitch-hunting practices, we need to stress that we must love the sinner\n\n(even our enemies), while hating the sin. Biblically speaking, both\n\nwitch and witch-finder (diviner) are in need of salvation and need to\n\nrepent and turn to Christ. Below are action steps we can take to counter\n\nthese practices.\n\n• Engage in discussion. Instead of accusing people\n\nof witchcraft on the basis of no or very flimsy evidence, we may, by\n\nmeans of group discussion, seek to influence people behaviorally in\n\norder to help them break through the cycle of suspicion and false\n\naccusations. Discussion could begin with, “How would you feel if you\n\nwere accused of witchcraft?” This would help people to look at the issue\n\nfrom the perspective of the accused.\n\n• Share relevant scripture. We can share core biblical\n\nteachings, such as loving one’s neighbor (Matt. 22:34-40) and doing to\n\nothers what we would have them do to us (Matt. 7:12).\n\n• Remind others of human tendencies. It may also be\n\nhelpful to educate people about the human tendency of scape-goating and\n\nto demonstrate how this is counterproductive (Lagerwerf 1987:33).\n\n• Come alongside those who are persecuted. In a context\n\nwhere no one dares to take up the plight of those accused of witchcraft\n\nout of fear of being branded a witch as well, as God’s servants we\n\nshould take a strong stance of solidarity. We must protect those who are\n\ntargeted by the community, shelter those whose homes are burned down,\n\nand provide general assistance.\n\n• Engage political structures. We must call upon the government and the legal fraternity to act justly.\n\n• Take part in cleansing. We may even employ a\n\nChristianized version of a traditional cleansing ritual, which could\n\ninclude prayers to God to cleanse the person from anything evil which\n\nmay have entered his or her life knowingly and unknowingly. We can then\n\nprovide a certificate that he or she has gone through this ritual so as\n\nto assist re-integration in the community.\n\nJust as in scripture, there are people today who practice\n\nwitchcraft either out of malice, selfishness, or because of a sense of\n\npowerlessness.2 Some people claim to be or to have been\n\nwitches because they like the attention that comes with it. Others may\n\nsimply be brainwashed by the culture or the community into believing\n\nthey are witches. A child who is repeatedly told that he or she is a\n\nwitch may eventually believe and even act upon it.\n\nSometimes people may misinterpret dreams, sinful temptations, and\n\nother evil impulses as evidence that they are witches (Friedman 1991,\n\n194ff). Some need pastoral counseling; others may need psychological\n\ntreatment. Some “witches” need deliverance ministry (e.g., if they are\n\nunder the influence of an evil spirit who gives them supernatural\n\ninsights or powers like the girl in Philippi; see Acts 16:16-18).\n\nDealing with Those Afflicted by Evil Spirits\n\nSeveral points must be made here.\n\nMercy and love. In Malawi, people who are afflicted\n\nby evil spirits are commonly thought to be evil themselves. It is\n\nsignificant, however, that in the Gospels, Jesus always treats them as\n\nvictims. In Mark 5:1-20, we see that while the community chained down a\n\ndemon-possessed man, Jesus shows love and compassion. We must show mercy\n\nand love to those under the influence of an evil spirit so that we may\n\nsee them delivered and saved by the power of Christ. We should not fear\n\nthe evil one, nor fight against flesh and blood, but bring people out of\n\ndarkness into the light of Christ.\n\nStyles and methods of exorcism. Styles and methods of\n\nexorcism fall outside the scope of this article (cf. Lagerwerf 1987,\n\n55-72); however, whatever format we decide upon, our trust must be in\n\nChrist, who has all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18) to set a\n\nperson free from being afflicted by evil spirits.\n\nOur faith should not be in the employment of a certain method,\n\nlest we fall into the trap of Christian magic. I personally appreciate\n\nthe method of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania, where a group\n\ngathers around the demon-afflicted person and sings hymns and prays for\n\ndeliverance. This demonstrates Christian family love and solidarity\n\nwith those oppressed by the evil one (Lagerwerf 1987, 61).\n\nIn spite of the possible public relations value of aggressive\n\npublic exorcisms, exorcism sessions which last several hours can easily\n\nlead to psychological abuse and trauma and have little in common with\n\nbiblical accounts of exorcism.\n\nPastoral counseling. In pastoral counseling of the\n\ndemonically-afflicted, we must keep in mind that there is not always a\n\nsharp distinction between psychological problems, moral degradation, and\n\ndemonic affliction. It is often through deception and false beliefs\n\nthat Satan has a hold on people’s minds, resulting both in sinful and\n\nerratic behavior (Eph. 4:17-19).\n\nMay the Lord help us as we seek to help those living in fear of\n\nthe works of the Evil One in Malawi and other parts of the world.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. The Bible does not attribute much power to magic and witchcraft, but\n\ninstead exposes it as a fraud and far inferior to the power of God (Acts\n\n13:6-12). Inasfar as evil spirits are concerned, the Bible teaches that\n\nthe spiritual powers, described as Satan and his demons, have been\n\ndefeated and disarmed and have been rendered powerless by Christ (Col.\n\n2:15). Although disarmed, the powers still seek to pollute the hearts\n\nand minds of people by means of deceit and temptation. The powers\n\ninspire false beliefs (1 Tim. 4:1), idolatry (1 Cor. 10:20), persecution\n\n(1 Pet. 5:8-9; Rev. 2:13), and sin (Eph. 2:1-2; 4:27ff).\n\n2. It is outside the scope of this article, but it appears that\n\nwomen in patriarchal societies, both in Europe and Africa, are more\n\nlikely to be involved in witchcraft or other occult activities than\n\ntheir male counterparts. It is possible that this is simply the\n\nperception of the community, especially the male part who fear the\n\nundermining of their power. However, it is equally possible that the\n\noppressed or powerless seek to assert some measure of power and control\n\nby involving themselves in (supernatural) activities that the oppressors\n\nor those in power fear.\n\nReferences\n\nBourdillon, Michael. 2002. “The Significance of Witchcraft in the Training of Clergy.” Chiedza, (Arrupe College Journal) 5(2):10-15.\n\nBurnett, David G. 2003. “Spiritual Conflict and Folk Religion.”\n\nAccessed August 31, 2010 from\n\nlausanne.org/all-documents/folk-religion.html.\n\nChandilanga, Herbert. 2008. “A Witchcraft Infested Society.” Weekend Nation (March 15-16): 4-5.\n\nClark, Matthew S. 2001. “The Challenge of Contextualization and Syncretism to Pentecostal Theology and Missions in Africa.” Journal of Asian Mission 3(1):79-99.\n\nFriedman, Kajsa Ekholm. 1991.
