        "text": "Malawi is affectionately called the Warm Heart of Africa. The people here are friendly and welcoming. The sun shines every day, so you get more than enough vitamin D. But what makes Malawi really special is that your own heart will be warmed here. In this blog you read why we are head over heels in love with this country, and why you will also feel butterflies as soon as you set foot on Malawian soil!\n\nTravelling to the Warm Heart of Africa\n\nIt may sound strange, but there’s something in the air here. Something that immediately ensures that you know that Malawi is different from other countries. The whole continent has this, but in the Warm Heart of Africa you feel it even stronger.\n\nAfter living and working in South Africa for six years, we decided to build a better life in Malawi in 2019, together with our close friend Howard. To get this new chapter in our lives off to a good start, we first gave ourselves a holiday. Instead of driving straight to the Warm Heart of Africa, we completed a wonderful road trip through Botswana and Zambia.\n\nThese are fantastic opportunities and secretly along the way we kept our eyes and ears open to any possibilities of settling there. As we crossed the border into Malawi, we were thankful we hadn’t decided to stay anywhere. We hadn’t seen much of the country, and yet we were sure; we feel at home here!\n\nMalawi has a mind of its own\n\nWe had the idea to first get to know the country a bit better. Maybe after a while we could find a job somewhere, to work on our tour company 1 2 Travel Africa without financial pressure.\n\nAs we’ve experienced more often after that, the Warm Heart of Africa has a mind of its own. Going on an adventure first was not meant to be. We got a job right away. We had only been in the country for a week, and we already called ourselves Lodge Manager. Each one of us at one of the best accommodations in Malawi’s capital Lilongwe.\n\nThis turned out to bring many more adventures than we expected. We have met countless nice people there, and made very useful contacts as well. And for hours, the people in our teams told us about the country they are so proud of. Their Malawi, their Warm Heart of Africa.\n\nMalawians have a warm heart\n\nThey told us about the young democracy, full of dreams and ambitions. We heard stories about extraordinary people in this country. Malawians have broad shoulders, and an even broader smile. We feel safe and welcome wherever we go. Your heart will certainly jump for joy here too. Especially if you come from a country where people are no longer used to have a nice conversation with a stranger. Or to even smile at all!\n\nA lack of medical facilities means that a few people have missing teeth. That doesn’t make their smile any less beautiful. In fact, they mainly laugh with their eyes and from their warm heart anyway. You immediately feel that it’s all genuine, making your trip even more beautiful.\n\nBreath-taking nature\n\nAnother reason that you will fall in love with the Warm Heart of Africa, is the stunning nature.\n\nFirstly, you’ll find the famous Lake Malawi here, which is about the size of half the United Kingdom. There you can do quite a few laps! Fortunately, slow snorkelling is also an option. Lake Malawi is home to more different fish species than any other lake in the world. Most are colourful cichlids that swim undisturbed around you. Be amazed by the different shades of blue, yellow, red and green. Even the black, white, grey and brown fish are by no means boring.\n\nThis freshwater lake is crystal clear. It has a pleasant temperature all year round, also contributing to the name the Warm Heart of Africa!\n\nOn safari in the Warm Heart of Africa\n\nAlthough people mainly think of the lake when you mention Malawi, you also have the chance to see the Big 5 here during your safari. It is heart-warming to see that more and more people are fully committed to nature conservation. No one is denying that there are still challenges, but Africa’s newest Big 5 safari destination is making huge strides.\n\nBy the way, the Big 5 has been expanded to the even more special Magnificent 7. Cheetahs and African wild dogs are doing great here, and add extra adrenaline on safari.\n\nCombine your game drives with a unique boat safari on the Shire River in southern Malawi to feel perfectly happy. Certain times of the year, you can also go on a walking safari. If you’re into something a little more adventurous, you can even go with the park rangers to track endangered black rhinos on foot. This species also feels perfectly at home in the Warm Heart of Africa.\n\nFill your heart with warmth in Malawi\n\nDon’t underestimate how beautiful the nature reserves with little or no wildlife are. Malawi has magical valleys, towering mountains and enchanting forests. Enjoy a wonderful balance between activities such as horse riding, mountain biking and hiking, and completely relaxing in the same beautiful nature. Experience a feeling of ultimate freedom when you do your yoga or meditation exercises on top of a mountain after a tough hike. Fill your lungs with clean air, your head with positive thoughts and your heart with warmth.\n\nWhatever the reason is that you travel to Malawi, you will feel like coming back to life here. See the world from a different perspective, let your energy flow and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
