        "text": "Introduction\n\nMalawi is a landlocked country in southeastern Africa. It has spectacular highlands and large lakes. Lake Nyasa (which is also known as Lake Malawi) accounts for more than one-fifth of Malawi’s total area. Before Malawi gained independence in 1964, it was known as Nyasaland. Lilongwe is the capital, though the judiciary meets in Blantyre. Area 45,853 square miles (118,760 square kilometers). Population (2024 est.) 20,271,000.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nMalawi stretches about 520 miles (840 kilometers) from north to south and varies in width from 5 to 100 miles (8 to 160 kilometers). It is bordered by Tanzania to the north, Mozambique to the east and south, and Zambia to the west.\n\nMuch of the country is covered by a high plateau 2,500 to 4,500 feet (760 to 1,370 meters) above sea level. The East African (or Great) Rift Valley, the most prominent physical feature, runs along the eastern border. (A rift valley is a long system of rifts, or breaks, in Earth’s crust.) The East African Rift Valley contains Lake Nyasa—the third largest lake in Africa and one of the deepest lakes in the world. In the north the land rises to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) in the Nyika Plateau. A prominent feature of the intensely cultivated Shire Highlands in the south are the Mulanje Mountains, which reach 9,849 feet (3,002 meters), the highest point in the country.\n\nThe Shire River, the principal river of Malawi, is the only outlet of Lake Nyasa. The Shire flows through adjacent Lake Malombe and receives several tributaries before joining the Zambezi River in Mozambique.\n\nMalawi’s subtropical climate has abundant precipitation, especially in the highlands. There are two main seasons: dry (from May to October) and wet (from November to April). Temperatures are mild at the higher elevations but rise to well over 100 °F (38 °C) in the lower Shire River valley. July is the coldest month, and October and November are the hottest months.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nForests and woodlands occupy roughly one-third of Malawi’s total land area. Woodlands with acacia trees occur along rivers and in fertile plateau areas. Miombo woodlands, consisting of an open cover of deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves seasonally), are common in dry regions. Grasslands and evergreen forests are found together in the highlands. Malawi’s natural vegetation has been altered significantly by human activities. Much of the original woodland has been cleared. Swamps have been drained and cultivated, and rivers have been dammed to support irrigation. About three-fifths of the country’s land is used for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe country’s rich animal life is protected in several game parks. The major ones are Lengwe for antelope; Kasungu for elephants, hippopotamuses, and lions; and Nyika for giraffes, zebras, and buffalo. The lakes and rivers of Malawi contain hundreds of species of fish. Lake Nyasa is particularly noted for its biodiversity, or variety of plant and animal life. An enormous range of fish species inhabit the lake. The southern region of the lake, as part of Lake Malawi National Park, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984. The most common and commercially significant fish found in Malawi include tilapia, catfish, and minnows.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nPeople\n\nMalawi derives its name from the Maravi, a Bantu people who first settled in the region some 600 years ago. Major ethnic groups today include the Chewa, Lomwe, Yao, Ngoni, Tumbuka, Sena, Manganja, Tonga, Nyanja, and Ngonde (Nkonde). Each group speaks a Bantu language. Chewa is spoken by the majority of the people. English, however, is the official language.\n\nMore than three-quarters of the people adhere to Christianity. Of the Christian population, the majority are members of various Protestant or independent Christian denominations. The remainder are Roman Catholic. Muslims constitute about one-seventh of the population. A small number of Malawians practice traditional African religions.\n\nMalawi’s population is largely rural. Less than one-fifth of the people live in urban areas. The major cities include Lilongwe, Blantyre, Zomba, and Mzuzu. Population growth is very high.\n\nCulture\n\nVarious traditional arts and crafts form part of Malawi’s culture. Wood carving is a prominent activity. A variety of musical forms are also important. Many traditional songs and dances feature the drum as the major musical instrument. Among the most notable of these dances are ingoma and gule wa mkulu, performed by men, and chimtali and visekese, performed by women.\n\nImportant artifacts of Malawian history, art, and culture are preserved in the country’s museums, including the Malawi Museum in Blantyre and the Cultural & Museum Centre Karonga. Another site of historical and cultural significance is the Chongoni Rock-Art Area in central Malawi. Named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2006, the area features numerous rock paintings, the oldest of which may date back to the 6th century bc. The paintings were made by ancient farmers and hunter-gatherers in the area.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nPrimary education is free and compulsory (required) for eight years beginning at age 6. Secondary education begins at age 14. Efforts have been made to meet the demand for more teachers and schools. Literacy among Malawians age 15 and over is a little more than 60 percent. Higher education is available at the University of Malawi, Mzuzu University, and the Domasi College of Education. There are also several vocational training centers in Malawi.\n\nHealth care services are inadequate. Health facilities include hospitals at Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu, and Zomba. District hospitals and rural clinics also operate throughout the country. However, there are shortages of both medical personnel and supplies. Malnutrition is widespread, and the infant mortality rate is high. There is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and schistosomiasis (a tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms). Life expectancy is about 72 years.\n\nEconomy\n\nMalawi’s economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Today the sector contributes more than one-quarter of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of goods and services produced in a year. Agricultural products account for a large proportion of the country’s export earnings. Malawi has some of the most fertile soils in south-central Africa. Corn (maize), potatoes, sugarcane, tea, tobacco, cassava, and plantains are among the most important crops. Goats, cattle, pigs, and sheep are the main livestock raised. Lake Nyasa provides a rich harvest of fish. More than three-quarters of the labor force works in agriculture. However, the agriculture system favors large estate farms, and most of the population remains impoverished.\n\nIndustry forms a small component of the economy. Among the manufactured goods produced are cement, tobacco products, refined sugar, construction materials, and processed timber. Malawi satisfies much of its own domestic need for products such as cotton textiles and canned foods. Mineral industries are mostly limited to the mining of coal and the quarrying of limestone for cement production. Water resources are plentiful. About four-fifths of Malawi’s electricity is generated from hydroelectric power.\n\nServices make up a growing sector of the economy. The sector now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP and employs about one-fifth of the labor force. Trade is an important service activity. Foreign trade is dominated by exports of tobacco, tea, and sugar and imports of refined petroleum, medicine, machinery, and fertilizer. Malawi’s main trading partners include South Africa, China, Belgium, the United States, and Egypt. Many see Malawi’s natural wealth, including its wildlife reserves and national parks, as a source of great tourism potential. A variety of sites have been marked by the government for development as ecotourism destinations.\n\nMalawi has two railway links to the sea. One runs from Lilongwe to the port of Beira, Mozambique. The second line links Salima on Lake Nyasa to the city of Cuamba, Mozambique, before continuing to the port of Nacala. The backbone of Malawi’s road system is represented by a road running from Blantyre in the south to Lilongwe in the center and through to Mzuzu in the north. About a quarter of all roadways in the country are paved. International airports are at Lilongwe and Blantyre.\n\nGovernment\n\nMalawi is a multiparty republic administered by a three-branched government. The executive branch is headed by a president. The president is elected by popular vote to a five-year term and may be reelected to a second term. The president serves as both chief of state and head of government. A cabinet is appointed by the president. The legislative branch of the government consists of the National Assembly, a unicameral (single-chambered) body of 193 representatives. Each representative is elected by popular vote to serve for five years. The judicial branch of the government is headed by the Supreme Court of Appeal, whose chief justice is appointed by the president. The Supreme Court of Appeal hears appeals from the High Court, which has judicial authority over all civil and criminal cases. All citizens over the age of 18 are allowed to vote.\n\nHistory\n\nThe vicinity of Lake Nyasa was inhabited in the period between 8000 and 2000 bc. Bantu-speaking peoples entered the region between the 1st and 4th centuries ad. They established separate states. About 1480 they founded a kingdom known as the Maravi Confederacy, which controlled most of what is now central and southern Malawi. In northern Malawi the Ngonde people founded a kingdom in about 1600. In the 18th century a group of people from the eastern side of Lake Nyasa created the Chikulamayembe state to the south of the Ngonde.\n\nThe slave trade pushed into the area, where it flourished in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Islam spread into Malawi in the 1860s. Christianity was introduced about the same time by missionaries such as David Livingstone. In 1878 the British-sponsored African Lakes Company began building trading posts. Britain established colonial authority in 1891, creating the Nyasaland Districts Protectorate. It was called the British Central Africa Protectorate from 1893 and Nyasaland from 1907. It was made part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953.\n\nNyasaland became a self-governing colony in February 1963. It achieved independent status under the name Malawi on July 6, 1964, and joined the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. It became a republic in 1966. The economy prospered in the 1970s with the help of foreign aid and capital investment, but by the mid-1990s the country was deeply dependent on foreign aid.\n\nThe 1966 constitution established the country as a one-party state. That year former prime minister Hastings Kamuzu Banda was elected president. In 1971 he was made president for life. Banda established a dictatorship that violently suppressed political opposition. During his tenure, international concerns arose over human rights abuses. Parliamentary elections held in 1978—the first held since independence—were subject to his approval.\n\nIn 1993, while Banda was recovering from a serious illness, the government stripped him of his title of president for life. The following year, in the country’s first multiparty presidential election, Bakili Muluzi was elected president. A new constitution was adopted in 1995. The constitution provided the structure for transforming Malawi into a democratic society. Muluzi was reelected for a final five-year term in 1999. Although he freed political prisoners and reestablished freedom of speech, he later faced accusations of corruption. He also drew criticism for his failure to address Malawi’s growing problems, particularly the increased incidence of AIDS and rampant poverty.\n\nMuluzi’s handpicked successor, Bingu wa Mutharika, died in office in 2012. The country’s vice president, Joyce Banda, assumed the presidency, becoming the first woman to serve as head of state in southern Africa. Malawi’s economic growth rate more than doubled during her time as president. However, Banda’s chances to secure a full term in the 2014 presidential election were hurt by a massive fraud and corruption scandal. The scandal allegedly involved some members of her cabinet. Banda lost the election to Peter Mutharika, brother of the former president.\n\nCiting widespread voting irregularities, Malawi’s Constitutional Court annulled (or declared invalid) Peter Mutharika’s 2019 presidential election victory over challenger Lazarus Chakwera. The court ordered a new election to be held, and in June 2020 Chakwera defeated Mutharika by a decisive margin. Chakwera focused much of his efforts as president on eliminating government corruption."
