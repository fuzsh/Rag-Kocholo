        "text": "BLANTYRE, Malawi, Monday, July 6—Nyasaland became the independent African state of Malawi early today in a din of jubilation.\n\nAfricans stomped, shouted and danced at the ending of 73 years of British colonial rule in this Central African land.\n\n“Ufulu! Ufulu!” (Freedom! Freedom !), they cried.\n\nAt least 40,000 people had crowded into Central Stadium here for the independence ceremonies. Twelve bonfires blazed into the night sky from the ancient hills where tribal leaders lie buried.\n\nThe change came at 12:01 A.M. (6:01 P.M. Sunday, Eastern daylight time).\n\nThe acquisition of sovereignty made Malawi the 37th country in restless, emerging Africa to achieve independence. Nearly all its 3.9 million inhabitants are blacks; there are only 8,000 whites.\n\nTo emphasize the change from the colonial past, the country's name was altered from Nyasaland, which meant land of “broad waters,” to Malawi, land of “flaming waters. The name is taken from a tribal word that described how rays of sun glinted off Lake Nyasa.\n\nA hush fell on the stadium as the moment of independence approached. Official guests from more than 60 countries and the Vatican stood for the final playing of the British anthem, “God Save the Queen.”\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, represented Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.\n\nIn the darkness, to the muffled roll of military drums, the Union Jack was lowered for the last time. Seconds later, to a cacophony of screams, exploding fireworks and rattle of bean‐filled gourds, the new red, green and black colors of Malawi were unfurled from the ceremonial flagpole.\n\nThe crowd screamed its acclaim for Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda the American‐educated physician who will be Malawi'sfirst Prime Minister.\n\nAt that moment, miles away to the south, an African climber unfurled a second flag on the 9,843‐foot summit of Mount Mlanje, the country's highest peak.\n\nToday was considered a particular triumph for Dr. Banda, now in his sixties. It coincided with the date of his return here six years ago to lead the country's black majority. He had been abroad for four decades.\n\nIt also followed his earlier success in breaking Nyasland away from the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasland because he felt the federation had been dominated by whitecontrolled Southern Rhodesia. The federation, which was organized in 1953, collapsed last year as a result."
