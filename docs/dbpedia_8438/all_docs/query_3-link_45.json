        "text": "What’s Malawi’s predominant religion?\n\nA majority of Malawians are Christian. 33.5% identify as Protestant, 17.2% identify as Roman Catholic, and another 26.2% belong to other Christian denominations.\n\nWhy is Malawi poor?\n\nMalawi’s poverty can be traced to multiple factors, including susceptibility to natural disasters, illiteracy, lack of infrastructure, political unrest, and one of the highest HIV infection rates in the world.\n\nWhat is Malawi known for?\n\nMalawi is reputed to be one the friendliest countries on the African continent, earning the nickname “the warm heart of Africa.” Its people have a reputation for welcoming strangers and tourists to enjoy the country’s beautiful natural resources such as wildlife, landscapes and Lake Malawi. Unfortunately, Malawi is also known for high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and one of the world’s highest HIV infection rates.\n\nWhat are the main causes of water crisis in Malawi?\n\nOne of the main causes of the water crisis in Malawi is lack of infrastructure and the disrepair of existing wells. In many villages, even a community well is too great a luxury for the people to afford, and in those cases, families must find other ways to meet their needs. Women and girls are usually tasked with water collection, and they may need to walk an hour or more to reach the nearest water source — usually a muddy stream or hand-dug hole beside a dry river bed, where ground water can be dipped out.\n\nHow is the Catholic Church addressing poverty in Malawi?\n\nThe Catholic Church is reaching out to poor communities with God’s love by providing practical solutions. Since one of the biggest needs of poor families is clean water, the Diocese of Karonga is repairing old water wells in impoverished communities. When the Church shares clean water, it opens the door to sharing the truth of the Living Water, Jesus Christ."
