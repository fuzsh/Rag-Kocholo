        "text": "CAADP Compact: Malawi signed the CAADP Compact on 19April 2010.\n\nCapacity Building: Demand-driven, modular, short-term pilot measures for agricultural training (along selected value chains) were offered by public and private agricultural training institutions for 200 young ‘agripreneurs’ of which 60 were women.\n\nNEPAD also supported Malawi in conducting an Independent Technical Review (ITR) of the NAIP from 10 – 16 September 2010. Malawi’s investment plan known as the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) focuses on three areas: food security and risk management, commercial agriculture, agro-processing and market development, and sustainable agricultural land and water management. Malawi also received support in conducting Agricultural Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs) practices using the Monitoring African Food and Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) tools. A public expenditure study on the country’s agricultural sector was carried out in 2013.\n\nMalawi is one of the countries receiving support in establishing its Strategic Analysis Knowledge Support System (SAKSS) to inform and guide the CAADP implementation process.\n\nBusiness: Its first CAADP Business Meeting was held from 28 - 29 September 2011.\n\nFunding: Malawi received funding from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP), a multilateral mechanism by the G20 to address funding of country and regional agriculture, amounting to amounting to USD 39.6 million.\n\nResults:\n\nThe fertilizer subsidy programme started in 2004/2005 has resulted in increased yields in the first six years. For the first time in many years Malawi registered surplus harvests after the introduction of the Fertiliser Subsidy Input Programme (FISP), with the average being 1.2 million metric tons.\n\nIncreased productivity and production has resulted in food self-sufficiency in the first six years of FISP\n\nFISP has contributed to increased farm incomes and therefore a reduction in poverty in the first six years\n\nEngagement of the private sector through public-private partnerships has proven to be essential in the agricultural sector.\n\nOther best practices in Malawi include the uptake of nutrition sensitive agriculture production, intensified use of certified seeds and the increased use of drip irrigation.\n\nInvestment Plan\n\nSigned Country Compact\n\nTechnical Review Report\n\nClick here for more information...\n\nProject : TAH programme\n\nDescription : This is phase I of the continental connectivity programme that focuses on completion and standardisation of the TAH missing links by 2030\n\nProject : Single African Sky phase 1 (design and initial implementation)\n\nDescription : Single African Sky is a continental programme that will create a high-level, satellite-based air navigation system for the African continent\n\nProject : Yamoussoukro Decision implementation\n\nDescription : Accelerate Yamoussoukro Decision implementation by identifying countries that are ready to fully implement it, and discussing and agreeing with both their governments and airlines to launch the voluntary club on a full membership basis\n\nProject : ICT Enabling Environment\n\nDescription : This programme would improve the environment for the private sectors to invest in high-speed broadband infrastructure\n\nProject : ICT Terrestrial for Connectivity\n\nDescription : This programme has two main components : secure each country connection by at least two broadband infrastructure and ensure the access to submarine cable to all landlocked countries\n\nProject : Internet Exchange Point (IXP) programme\n\nDescription : The aim of this programme is to provide Africa with adequate internet node exchange to maximise internal traffic\n\nProject : North–South Power Transmission Corridor\n\nSector : Energy\n\nDescription : 8,000 km line from Egypt through Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe to South Africa\n\nProject :North-South Multimodal Corridor\n\nDescription : This programme is designed to modernize the highest priority multimodal ARTIN corridor\n\nin Southern Africa on modern standards and facilitate travel of people and goods across the borders between South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and DRC\n\nProject : Beira-Nacala Multimodal Corridors\n\nDescription : Rehabilitation/reconstruction of railway and road links, including one-stop border posts along the corridors. Improvement of capacity at the ports, including capital dredging at Beira Port. Natural resources development, including Moatize Coal Field in the Zambezi Valley will use the ports as main export gateways\n\nProject : Lusaka-Lilongwe ICT Terrestrial Fibre Optic (DFS)\n\nDescription : Provide redundancy and reduce landed prices of internet capacity. Additional capacity\n\n(Secondary).\n\nTechnical capacities were strengthened to establish and manage functional biosafety systems for the safe use of modern agricultural biotechnology. Other technical support included national biosafety training workshops, biosafety short courses at African institutions and partner institutions outside Africa, notably at Michigan State University in the USA, biosafety internships, technical consultation support, and biosafety information resources.\n\nBiosafety short courses form an integral component of ABNE activities in Africa. In 2014, ABNE presented a biosafety short course at Makerere University in Uganda and agricultural biotechnology short courses at Michigan State University in the USA. A total of 24 regulators drawn from Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe gained broad insights into the basics of biosafety science, policy and regulation, GM crop risk assessment and management, and biosafety communication and awareness creation.\n\nClick here for more information...\n\n1. On-going technical support to strengthen the national-level knowledge management platform.\n\n2. Undertook the Measuring the Cost of Hunger in Africa: Malawi was among the second phase countires (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda) to implement the COHA study. The overarching objective of the multi-country study led by the AUC, NEPAD, WFP and UNECA, is to catalyse coordinated action and inform the design of nutrition-oriented policy frameworks and programmes, with greater investments to eradicate child undernutrition on the continent.\n\n10 findings from the “Measuring the Cost of hunger” study in the first and second phase countries:\n\nAfrica's share in the world's undernourished population has increased from 18 to 28 percent.\n\nOnly one in five children suffereing from undernutrition occur before the child reaches the age of one year.\n\nMost health costs associated with undernutrition occur before the child reaches the age of one year.\n\nBetween 7 to 18 percent of repetitions in schoold are associated with stunting.\n\nStunted children achieve 0.2 to 1,5 years less in school edication.\n\n8 to 33 percent of all child mortality is associated with undernutrition.\n\nChild mortality associated with undernutrition has reduced national workforces by 1 to 13.7 percent.\n\n40 to 67 percent of current working-age population suffered from stunting as children.\n\nThe annual costs associated with child underbutrition are estimated at 1.9 to 16.5 percent of the equivalent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nImproving the nutritional status of children is a priority that needs urgent policy attention to accelerate socio-economic progress and development in Africa.\n\nIn Malawi, ATVET was established in August 2014. A mapping exercise was initially conducted to established the status of ATVET and identify relevant actors and institutions who can support the implementation of this project. The actors and stakeholders identified included Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational Education and Training Authority(TEVETA), National Council for Higher Education(NCHE), Public ATVET institutions (Malawi College of Fisheries, Community Colleges {Naminjiwa, Mponela, Mbandira Ngara} and Residential Training Center-Lisasadzi ,Thuchira ), Private ATVET institutions namely DAPP Mikolongwe Vocational Training School, Stephanos Vocational Training Centre, St John’s of God Institute of Vocational Training, Private Sector and National Employer and Employee bodies such as ECAM,MCCCI.\n\nSubsequently, two more studies were conducted; one was to identify skills needs along value chains, and the other was an analysis of the organisational capacity of ATVET institutions.\n\nTwo value chains in horticulture (mango and pineapple) and one in aquaculture have been selected in Malawi. The project will support the development of specific curricula and occupational standards for these value chains. An orientation on Competence-Based Education and Training (CBET) has been completed, whose aim was to prepare participating institutions for effective implementation.\n\nThe process of curriculum development is currently in progress, with national and international consultants involved in the project. There are plans to integrate ATVET into the Malawi Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (Malawi’s National Agricultural Investment Plan) and Qualification Frameworks to ensure that ATVET is implemented in a systematic approach.\n\nAdvocacy and Strengthening of Negotiation Capacities on Post-2015 Development Agenda through the Common African Position (CAP)\n\nGlobal Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC)\n\nThe Global Partnership is an inclusive political forum bringing together governments, bilateral and multilateral organisations, civil society and representatives from parliaments and the private sector, committed to strengthening the effectiveness of development co-operation to produce maximum impact for development. Through its multi-stakeholder platform, the Global Partnership provides support, guidance and shares knowledge to boost development impact with a strong country focus, and to ensure a degree of coherence and collaboration among all development stakeholders on co-operation flows and policies. It offers a global mechanism to ensure co-operation is based on Busan principles of ownership, results, inclusiveness; and transparency and accountability to deliver tangible results on the new SDGs.
