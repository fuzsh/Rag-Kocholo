        "text": "What the World Food Programme is doing in Malawi\n\nFood assistance\n\nWFP supports the Government in responding to emergency by providing food and cash-based transfers to those affected, including refugees. WFP also provides cash-based transfers to 52,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Dzaleka refugee camp, in partnership with the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nSchool meals and nutrition\n\nWFP supports education through the provision of daily meals to 825,000 schoolchildren in 778 primary schools and 140 pre-primary schools. In 2022, WFP Malawi transitioned to a home-grown school feeding approach that uses fresh foods bought from local smallholder farmers. This provides a consistent market for the farmers, and fresh, locally produced nutritious food for school children. As part of the humanitarian El Niño response, WFP aims to extend school-meal programmes as emergency support to 440,000 children, and assist the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition for 88,000 children.\n\nLivelihoods\n\nWFP’s “changing lives” agenda in Malawi focuses on asset creation, climate-smart agriculture, increased access to finance (savings and loans), crop insurance, management of post-harvest losses, and linking smallholder farmers to markets. WFP is working with farmers to provide water for year-round crop production, and equipping communities with solar-powered irrigation and pumps. These are especially important this year due to El Niño-induced dry spells, helping communities grow crops during the dry season to mitigate crop losses.\n\nCapacity strengthening\n\nWFP provides technical assistance to emergency preparedness and response institutions in Malawi, aimed at enhancing the humanitarian response amid increasing climate-induced emergencies. This covers areas including coordination, weather forecasting and monitoring of anticipatory action. WFP is supporting the Ministry of Health to improve warehouse good practices and data quality management by providing supervision for health facilities.\n\nSupply chain services\n\nWFP provides services through the Logistics Cluster to the National Disaster Management Agency and humanitarian and development partners to enhance logistics coordination and supply chain management. WFP also provides access to on-demand services to Government, humanitarian and development actors to augment their capacity to ensure more effective and efficient interventions.\n\nIn focus\n\nIn Southern Africa, El Niño drought leaves a trail of scorched harvests and hunger\n\nStory\n\nMalawi: A boot camp maps the way for climate resilience amid hunger in southern Africa\n\nStory\n\n3 ways WFP protects people and planet (while tackling hunger)\n\nStory\n\nMalawi: Devastation caused by cyclone Freddy is a ‘wake-up call on the climate crisis’\n\nStory\n\nHow a donation of fertilizers for countries in Africa comes not a minute too soon\n\nStory\n\nRural Women's Day: With rains unreliable, Malawi's farmers harness sun instead\n\nStory"
