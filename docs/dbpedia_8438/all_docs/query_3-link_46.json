        "text": "Development cooperation between Iceland and Malawi started in 1989, through Iceland's bilateral development agency, the Icelandic International Development Agency (ICEIDA). When ICEIDA was incorporated into the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 2016 the cooperation moved to the Ministry. The incorporation did not bring about any change in the cooperation between the two countries. An Icelandic Embassy was formally established in Lilongwe in 2004.\n\nIn the beginning, the focus was entirely on development in the fisheries sector by Lake Malawi but around the turn of the century ICEIDA's strategy changed and increased emphasis was placed on providing support for improvement of basic services (health, education, and water and sanitation) of rural communities in Mangochi District.\n\nSince 2012, focus has been on a programme-based approach (PBA) at district level in Mangochi District, in collaboration with Mangochi District Council and the Ministry of Local Government. Mangochi District is the second largest district in the country, with approximately 1.2 million people. Following satisfactory results of cooperation between Iceland and Malawi, the two countries intend to deepen and broaden the bilateral development cooperation. After a successful and good collaboration with Mangochi District since 2012, Iceland has agreed to scale up its development cooperation in Malawi by partnering with Nkhotakhota District Council. The collaboration is planned to start in 2022. This follows a request by the Government of Malawi asking Iceland to expand its support to other district councils in the country. An assessment done by the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs on a potential new district partner in Malawi led to Nkhotakhota being identified as a suitable partner for Iceland, based on size, needs and potential alignment of priority sectors. As well as working on a district level in Malawi, Iceland also works with UN Agencies and Civil Society Organisations in Mangochi District and at the national level.\n\nThe overall goal of Iceland's development cooperation is to reduce poverty and hunger and promote general well-being in its partner countries, underpinned by the SDGs and the cross-cutting themes of human rights, gender equality and the environment. Iceland's development cooperation in Malawi aligns with Iceland's policy on international development cooperation, Iceland's Bilateral Development Cooperation Strategy and the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Iceland's development cooperation in Malawi 2023-2026.\n\nMangochi Basic Services Programme – MBSP\n\nThe main aid modality for Iceland in Malawi is a programme-based approach at district level, with local governments taking responsibility for ownership and implementation of programmes. The overall objective of the current programme support, the Mangochi Basic Services Programme, is to facilitate the efforts of the Malawi Government and Mangochi District Council, in particular, to improve livelihoods and socio-economic living conditions in rural communities in Mangochi District. This should result in a more resilient population and a more resourceful one for self-sufficiency. The MBSP aims to strengthen the delivery of basic services in the district through providing the Mangochi District Council with support and improved provision and use of basic services in these areas:\n\nImproved health care, particularly in maternal and neo-natal health as well as improving community-based health services in rural communities of Mangochi District.\n\nPrimary education, providing more equitable access to education and improve the quality of education.\n\nImproved and increased access to clean, safe drinking water as well as improved sanitation and hygiene practices with the use of adequate sanitation facilities to reduce waterborne diseases and to promote better health and well-being.\n\nCommunity development for youth and women, emphasising economic empowerment and access to literacy and skills training.\n\nStrengthen the capacity and ability of Mangochi District Council to deliver quality services and ensure successful implementation of the programme.\n\nThe first phase of the Mangochi Basic Services Programme started in 2012 and ended in 2016 with the second phase of the programme, Mangochi Basic Service Programme II, following until 2021. Iceland extended the second phase of the programme to March 2023.\n\nUnder the Mangochi Basic Services Programme (MBSP) special emphasis is placed on improving access to and use of quality maternal and child health services as the maternal mortality ratio in Malawi is high. Furthermore, support is provided to improving health services infrastructure in hard-to-reach areas, such as health posts, maternities, staff houses, waiting homes and guardian shelters. The new maternity ward at the Mangochi District Hospital which was opened in 2019 by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation, Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, has transformed the quality care in Mangochi for expecting mothers. Capacity building and trainings of health care staff is also a part of the MBSP, including support to Health Surveillance Assistants who play a key role in the provision of community-based health services which is very challenging in a district with 1.2 million inhabitants spread over 6,000 km2.\n\nPublic health results of the Mangochi Basic Services Programme since 2012:\n\nThe provision of quality education is a big challenge in Malawi. The education sector is underdeveloped and struggles with fulfilling its obligations to its students in terms of infrastructure, qualified teachers, teacher to student ratio and appropriate teaching materials.\n\nThe MBSP focuses on improved quality of primary education services in 12 targeted schools where 30,000 students have benefitted through a holistic approach. This includes, strengthening teaching and learning environment of the schools, construction of new classroom blocks and teachers’ houses, provision of teaching materials, adequate hygiene and sanitation facilities, safe drinking water as well as special changing rooms for girls menstruating. School meals are provided at each school which has contributed to improved school enrolment and keeping students in school, particularly girls.\n\nCapacity building of teachers and school managers is provided as well as construction of teachers houses close to school grounds. In addition, MBSP also supports early childhood development (ECD) and two ECD centres have been built where programmes are operated.\n\nEducation results of the Mangochi Basic Services Programme since 2012:\n\nIncreased and sustainable access to improved safe water sources, improved sanitation and hygiene practices in rural communities in Mangochi District as well as better management of water points and the water sector is a priority under the Mangochi Basic Services Programme. Four communities in Mangochi District have gained Open Defecation Free Status, meaning all households are provided with safe drinking water and adequate hygiene and sanitation facilities. As a result, no cases of waterborne diseases such as cholera have been detected since 2012 and fewer children suffer from diarrhoea than before. With improved sanitation and hygiene facilities it has also been possible to slow down the spread of Covid-19.\n\nWater and Sanitation results of the Mangochi Basic Services Programme since 2012:\n\nGender inequality is widespread in Malawi and poses a serious challenge to development efforts in the country. Malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriages in the world, girls are less likely to receive education than boys, gender-based violence is very common and economic opportunities are less available to women as well as youth. Gender equality is a main priority in all of Iceland's development interventions including the Mangochi Basic Services Programme, both direct and mainstreamed interventions.\n\nThe integration of gender perspectives under the MBSP has been a crucial focus area in the field of maternal and infant health as well as within the education sector to prevent school dropout of adolescent girls. Furthermore, improvements in water and sanitation have a significant effect on health, environment and workload of women and girls who bear the main responsibility of fetching water. With new water points (boreholes and wells), access to safe and clean water is guaranteed and walking distance to water points is shortened, leading to time savings for women and girls, less physical strain, and more safety.\n\nUnder the MBSP, 580 women and youth are being trained as a part of a pilot activity in economic empowerment. The interventions are intended to address gender inequalities in economic opportunities and reduce poverty levels prevalent in targeted rural areas of Mangochi District. 13 women and youth business groups are participating and receive capacity building in strengthening technical and entrepreneurial skills, such as production and business skills as well as getting access to markets, financial services, and material support in agriculture.\n\nGender equality and youth empowerment results of the Mangochi Basic Services Programme:\n\nAbout Malawi\n\nMalawi is a landlocked country in southern Africa sharing common borders with Zambia, Tanzania, and Mozambique. The capital of Malawi is Lilongwe. Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa, covers about one-fifth of the country’s total area. Malawi is a small country about the size of Iceland. Estimated population is 20.1 million people, making it one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. The majority of the population (80%) live in rural areas and depend on subsistence farming for their livelihoods.\n\nThe main characteristic of the population is its young age structure, with 77% of the total population under the age of 24 which has implications for socio-economic development in the country. Malawi is amongst the poorest countries in the world ranking number 169 out of 191 on the Human Development Index (HDI)"
