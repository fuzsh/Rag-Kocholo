        "text": "Center for International Private Enterprise / Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation\n\n1. Background\n\nThe Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation is a public-private partnership for trade-led growth, supporting governments in developing and least-developed countries in implementing the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement. Alliance projects cut through red tape and end costly delays at borders by bringing together governments and businesses of all sizes as equal partners to deliver targeted trade reforms. The Alliance is led by the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the World Economic Forum, in cooperation with Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). It is funded by the governments of the United States (USAID), Canada (Global Affairs Canada), and Germany (BMZ -Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development).\n\nCIPE, on behalf of the Alliance, is implementing a project to empower Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Women Owned Businesses (WOBs) in Malawi by enhancing their trade capabilities and knowledge. MSMEs and WOBs in Malawi face multiple challenges in accessing global markets chief among them are limited access to finance, lack of market information, inadequate infrastructure, regulatory, and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nThe project is divided into two components:\n\nC1: Export training program: The training program aims to bolster the export capabilities of MSMEs, women-owned and women-led businesses in Malawi. The training program will primarily target agricultural businesses, leading export sector, located in Blantyre and Lilongwe. It aims to benefit those businesses that have the potential of exporting to neighboring markets, taking advantage of the new opportunities offered by the AfCFTA.\n\nC2: HS Classification and Tariff Information Tool: At the heart of facilitating smoother trade operations, this component introduces a user-centric solution aimed at simplifying the process of HS product classification and accurately determining applicable duties and tariffs based on product origins. This tool is envisioned to be an indispensable resource for traders, streamlining their operations and enhancing compliance with international trade regulations.\n\nKey local stakeholders supporting the project:\n\nMalawi Revenue Authority\n\nMinistry of Trade and Industry\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Development Institute\n\nNational Association of Small and Medium Enterprises\n\nClearing and Forwarding Agents Association of Malawi\n\nIndigenous Customs Clearing and Forwarding Agents\n\nIn line with Component 2, CIPE is seeking the expertise of a firm to undertake the development of the HS Classification and Tariff Information Tool. This endeavor is crucial for equipping Malawian traders with the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of international trade, fostering growth and sustainability in the global marketplace.\n\n2. Objective\n\nDevelop a modern HS Classification and Tariff Information tool to simplify the process to accurately identify HS codes and tariff information for all products. It is anticipated that this tool will be primarily used by traders in Malawi, specially MSMEs which may not have access to specialized customs brokerage services. The tool must be in line with Malawi Customs and Excise Tariff and the different trade agreements that the country has signed.\n\nThe developer of the HS tool will also be required to provide:\n\na technical support and intensive maintenance service of 60 calendar days after the date of the Go-Live, and\n\nan additional 15-month period of technical support and maintenance of the tool that will start after the intensive maintenance period.\n\na training program to a group of private and public sector users.\n\n3. Scope of Services Requested\n\nThe selected company must work together with the Alliance Team and project stakeholders to develop the HS tool.
