        "text": "Since the early 2000s, FHI 360 has collaborated with the government of Malawi to mitigate the effects of HIV and AIDS, improve livelihoods, promote food security and strengthen education. Working closely with national and local partners, we have provided a range of HIV services, carried out programs that improve the detection of tuberculosis (TB) and promoted community participation in integrating services for treating HIV and TB.\n\nThrough the Expanding Malawi HIV/AIDS Prevention with Local Organizations Working for an Effective Epidemic Response (EMPOWER) project, FHI 360 supports the government of Malawi’s commitment to epidemic control by stopping HIV transmission and preventing new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women.\n\nThrough the Meeting Targets and Maintaining Epidemic Control (EpiC) project, FHI 360 partners with and strengthens the capacity of the government of Malawi, civil society organizations, other PEPFAR-implementing partners and the private sector to introduce HIV prevention and treatment innovations and expand HIV services. The EpiC project also supports the government of Malawi in bolstering its health systems to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19.\n\nFHI 360 has supported the government of Malawi’s efforts to increase demand for quality, sustainable, priority health services and products. The Health Communication for Life project expanded individuals’ opportunity, motivation and ability to use these health resources while building the capacity of the government and key institutional partners to support national social and behavior change communication programming.\n\nIn recent years, FHI 360’s work in Malawi has expanded beyond health to include programs that strengthen the quality and structure of Malawi’s education systems. We have increased access to low-cost, appropriate and effective mother-tongue reading materials for primary school students and supported the efforts of Malawi’s Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to create a decentralized educational structure that responds to the specific needs of communities.\n\nToday, FHI 360 continues to help Malawi address human development challenges by building the capacity of local nongovernmental organizations to develop and sustain high-quality programs. We also participate in technical working groups that identify effective ways to expand and strengthen future projects in Malawi."
