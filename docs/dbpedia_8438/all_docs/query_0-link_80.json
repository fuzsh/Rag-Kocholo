        "text": "Malawi is home to many tribes who have settled in the land over centuries. This melding of people has resulted in a mixture of many languages, including Chichewa, Yao, Tumbuka, Nyakyusa-Ngonde, Sena and more, making up about 16 total languages.\n\nAs a result of British colonization in the 1800â€™s, English became the official language of Malawi, and is often the second language that students learn in school. Government business is also done in English. Most Malawians speak at least some English, though only about 25% can read or write English.\n\nChichewa is the national language of Malawi and is spoken by about half of the population. It is a Bantu language spoken by the Maravi people who came to Malawi in the 16th century or earlier. Under the direction of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Chichewa was declared the national language and all other languages were removed from public use. As Malawi has modernized, the language has changed, with Chichewa spoken in rural villages being different from the language spoken by those living in cities.\n\nThe Yao language also derives from the Maravi people, and is spoken by about 2 million people in Malawi, primarily around the southern region of Lake Malawi bordering on Mozambique.\n\nSpoken primarily in the northern region, Tumbuka is also a Bantu language common across some parts of Africa. It has an estimate of 2 million speakers in total spread across Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania. Tumbuka was eliminated from public use by President Banda, but has seen resurgence in recent years, with new radio programs and books in Tumbuka."
