        "text": "General Information\n\nMalawi is a developing nation classified as low income. Located in southern Africa (east of Zambia and south of Tanzania), the climate is classified as tropical dry winter in the north and humid equatorial (long dry season) in the south.\n\nVaccinations\n\nYellow Fever\n\nSee also: Library article for Yellow Fever\n\nAlthough yellow fever does not occur in Malawi, an official yellow fever vaccination certificate may be required depending on your itinerary.\n\nRequirement: A certificate proving yellow fever vaccination is required for travelers aged ≥ 1 year coming from countries with risk of YF transmission. This also applies to airport transit stops (no exit through immigration checkpoint) longer than 12 hours in risk countries.\n\nOther Vaccines\n\nDepending on your itinerary, your personal risk factors, and the length of your visit, your health care provider may offer you vaccination against cholera, COVID-19, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, or typhoid fever. Routine immunizations, such as those that prevent tetanus/diphtheria or \"childhood\" diseases, should be reviewed and updated as needed.\n\nMalaria\n\nSee also: Library article for Malaria\n\nThe following is current information as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC):\n\nWHO—International Travel and Health (current online update, Country List)\n\n(2018) Malaria risk due predominantly to P. falciparum exists throughout the year in the entire country.\n\nRecommended prevention in risk areas: C – Risk of P. falciparum malaria, in combination with reported chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. Mosquito bite prevention plus atovaquone–proguanil or doxycycline or mefloquine chemoprophylaxis (select according to reported side effects and contraindications) a\n\naAlternatively, for travel to rural areas with low risk of malaria infection, mosquito bite prevention can be combined with stand–by emergency treatment (SBET).\n\nWHO Country List footnote: When available, the date of the most recent update or confirmation is indicated in parentheses in the country list. If no date is indicated, the most recent update or confirmation was provided before 2013.\n\nCDC—Health Information for International Travel (current online edition)\n\nAreas with malaria: All.\n\nDrug resistance3 : Chloroquine.\n\nMalaria species: P. falciparum 90%; P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax 10% combined.\n\nRecommended chemoprophylaxis: Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, or tafenoquine.4\n\n3 Refers to P. falciparum malaria unless otherwise noted.\n\n4 Primaquine and tafenoquine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency. Patients must be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting primaquine or tafenoquine. See Tafenoquine Approved for Malaria Prophylaxis and Treatment for more information.\n\nOther Concerns\n\nTravelers' Diarrhea\n\nSee also: Library article for Travelers' Diarrhea\n\nHigh risk exists throughout the country, including in deluxe accommodations. Community sanitation and food safety measures are generally inadequate. Some itineraries (e.g., remote destinations, austere accommodations) and activities (e.g., ecotourism, eating street or local-market food) further increase risk.\n\nTravelers should observe food and beverage precautions, which reduce the likelihood of illness.\n\nTravelers should carry loperamide for self-treatment of diarrhea and, if risk is moderate to high, an antibiotic to add if diarrhea is severe. Consult a knowledgeable health care provider regarding which antibiotic is appropriate for you and most effective for your destination.\n\nOther Food-Borne Illnesses\n\nPrecautions to prevent brucellosis may be needed.\n\nInsect- and Arthropod-Borne Diseases\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis, dengue, onchocerciasis, tick-bite fever may pose a risk. Personal protective measures are important.\n\nOther Disease and Health Risks\n\nAdditional concerns include anthrax disease, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, helminths, leptospirosis, plague, schistosomiasis, sexually transmitted infections, snakebites, tuberculosis.\n\nConsular Advice\n\nTerrorism Risk\n\nNo intrinsic risk of attack by terrorist groups exists, but unforeseen attacks are possible.\n\nCrime\n\nHigh risk of violent crime (armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking) and moderate risk of petty crime exists throughout the country, especially in Lilongwe (particularly on Kenyatta Drive and in the area between Old Town and Capital City), Blantyre, and other cities; on or near public transportation; near Mount Mulanje.\n\nTheft of valuables from unattended accommodations is common.\n\nScams involving false befriending have been reported.\n\nRisk exists of robberies and/or assaults occurring after consuming intentionally drugged food or drink; tourists are frequently targeted.\n\nCivil Unrest\n\nProtests and demonstrations occur throughout the country and have the potential to turn violent without warning. Bystanders are at risk of harm from violence or from the response by authorities. Disruption to transportation, free movement, or the ability to carry out daily activities may occur.\n\nUnsafe Areas\n\nA dangerous security environment may exist in areas surrounding Mount Mulanje.\n\nWater Safety\n\nRent water sports equipment from reputable operators. Scuba dive only with personnel certified by PADI or NAUI, and use equipment only from PADI- or NAUI-certified dive operators.\n\nOther Safety Threats\n\nRisk exists for fatal wildlife attacks on safaris and in game parks and reserves. Travelers should closely follow park regulations, always maintain a safe distance from wildlife, and should not exit vehicles or protected enclosures.\n\nTransportation Safety\n\nSignificant risk of traffic-related injury or death exists. The road traffic death rate is more than 24 per 100,000 population, the highest risk category. Carefully assess the safety of transportation options before any road travel.\n\nSeat belt laws are poorly enforced.\n\nDrunk driving laws are poorly enforced.\n\nStructural standards for vehicles may not meet international standards.\n\nNatural Disasters\n\nThe rainy season is from November through April. Floods, mudslides, and landslides may occur.\n\nSeismic activity frequently occurs.\n\nConsular Information\n\nSelected Embassies or Consulates in Malawi\n\nUnited States: [+265] 0-177-3166; mw.usembassy.gov\n\nCanada: Canada does not have an embassy or consulate in Malawi.\n\nUnited Kingdom: [+265] 1-772-027; www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-lilongwe\n\nAustralia: [+265] 0-999-960-120\n\nMalawi's Embassies or Consulates in Selected Countries\n\nIn the U.S.: www.malawiembassy-dc.org\n\nIn Canada: www.madagascar-embassy.ca\n\nIn the U.K.: www.malawihighcommission.co.uk\n\nIn Australia: malawi.com.au\n\nVisa/HIV Testing\n\nHIV testing is not required to obtain a tourist, work, or residence visa."
