        "text": "Selected Literature\n\nSupporting countries in using evidence for policymaking is an objective shared by many organizations and initiatives. Under the KIX initiative for which UNESCO IICBA manages the KIX Africa 19 Hub and collaborates with KIX Africa 21, the focus is on six themes: (i) learning assessment systems (ii) early childhood education; (iii) teaching and learning (iv) the data challenge; (v) gender equality; and (vi) equity and inclusion. For each topic, a link is provided to the GPE-KIX Discussion paper written at the start of the initiative in 2019 and additional publications that could be useful for policy. By necessity, to keep this brief short, only a few resources can be mentioned, but additional resources can be accessed through digital repositories listed below. A brief note on UNESCO IICBA research is also provided.\n\nLearning Assessment Systems [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Learning assessment tools and systems are essential to gauge and improve learning outcomes for students. A primer on large scale assessments from the World Bank provides guidance on such assessments, as does a review of learning assessments in Africa from UNESCO IIEP. Among regional assessments, PASEC (Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems) for francophone countries in West and Central Arica and SEACMEQ (Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality) for anglophone countries in East and Southern Africa are the best known. These instruments target primary schools. Other tools that focus and assess the learning outcomes of young learners include the Early Grade Reading and Mathematics Assessments (EGRA/EGMA). Supported and funded primarily by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), these assessments are administered by different agencies such as the World Bank, RTI International and others across the continent. The West African Examinations Council also provides guidance on examinations and certificate accreditation in Anglophone countries of West Africa Also interesting is PISA for development which is being piloted in secondary schools in a few African countries.\n\nMalawi participates in the SEACMEQ program and has also participated in the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment. The Malawi national examination systems consists of the Primary School leaving Certificate taken in the final grade of primary school, the Junior Certificate of Education taken in the second year of secondary school of Education (PSLCE) and the Malawi School Certificate of Education taken in the fourth year of secondary school. The Ministry of Education and the Malawi National Examinations Board (MANEB) administer national examinations. Currently Malawi does not have a national assessment framework but has cited this as an area to address in its National Education Sector Investment Plan 2020-2030.\n\nImproving Teaching and Learning [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. How teachers and students interact and engage is key to improve learning outcomes. Cost-effective approaches pr ‘smart buys’ to improve learning in low-income countries are discussed in a World Bank report. Teaching is paramount, and therefore so are teacher policies to ensure that successful teachers make for successful students. Standards for the teaching profession were proposed by Education International and UNESCO with regional standards available from the Africa Union Commission, including a framework for standards and competencies.\n\nMalawi follows a 8-4-4 structure that involves eight years of primary education, four years of secondary education (separated by lower and higher secondary education lasting two years each) and four years of tertiary education.\n\nStrengthening Early Childhood Care and Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. Experiences children undergo in early childhood can affect their entire life. Nurturing care is essential. Essential interventions in early childhood include pre-primary education. Yet less than half of young children in Africa benefit from pre-primary education according to the Global Education Monitoring report 2021. The Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) is a tool by UNICEF that can be used to measure the overall well-being of children aged 2-5. It does this by assessing their development in key areas such as literacy and numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development, and learning capacity. The Office of Research at UNICEF maintains a webpage with useful links to organizations working on child-related themes organized by subject, including early childhood.\n\nIn Malawi, 59% of children aged 3-4 are developmentally on track according to the ECDI. On a national scale, approximately 34 percent of children between the ages of 3 and 5 participate in ECE. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the ECE attendance rates between children whose mothers attended higher education (48%) and children whose mothers did not attend higher education (26%). Notably, children who attend ECE are more likely to be developmentally on track than those who do not attend, by a margin of 22 percentage points, according to a 2021 MICS-EAGLE report. A 2023 UNESCO publication notes that Early Childhood ECD is a top priority outlined in the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategic Paper, Vision 2063, and aligns with international commitments like Education for All and SDGs. ECD is acknowledged as a fundamental component of basic education, serving as the initial crucial phase toward attaining universal education goals. Basic data on early childhood development are available from a nurturing care profile.\n\nAchieving Gender Equality In and Through Education [GPE-KIX Discussion Paper]. The cost of gender inequality is massive, as is the cost of not educating girls, including in Africa. When girls lack education, this affects their earnings in adulthood, the number of children they will have and their health, as well as their agency, among others. When girls are not in school, they are also at higher risk of child marriage, with again high costs for them, their children, and society. In Africa, the African Union’s International Centre for the Education of Girls and Women in Africa supports member states on girls’ education. According to UNICEF MICS-EAGLE findings, at the primary level, girls finish primary school at a higher rate (38%) than boys (29%). However, this pattern changes at senior secondary school level with 16% of boys completing as compared to 15% of girls suggesting factors specific to girls that impede their education. A 2022 UNICEF report on Child Marriage in Eastern and Southern Africa estimates that 4 in 10 young women were first married or in union before the age of 18. 52% of women aged 20 to 24 years who were first married or in union before age 18 had no education as compared to 14% who had at least a secondary education.\n\nData Management Systems Strengthening [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Education management information systems (EMIS) are key for management. They can also support evidence-based policymaking. In Africa, the African Union’s Institute of Education for Development supports member states on EMIS. In addition to EMIS data, other data sources including household surveys, school surveys, student assessments, and impact evaluations of pilot interventions are essential to inform policy. According to a joint 2020 UNESCO and Global Partnership for Education report, Malawi utilizes OpenEMIS as its EMIS platform.\n\nEquity and Inclusion/Leaving No One Behind [GPEKIX Discussion Paper]. Equity and inclusion are major challenges for education systems. Gender, disability, ethnicity, indigenous status, poverty, displacement, and many other factors may all lead some children to lack access to education. In Africa especially, gaps in educational outcomes between groups may be large, as illustrated in the case of disability. Equity must be at the center of education policy on the continent. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are two major international frameworks related to disability-inclusive education exist.\n\nIn 1994, the government's flagship Free Primary Education (FPE) program abolished tuition fees and all other education-related costs up to Grade 8. In 2018, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announced that the government would abolish fees in public secondary schools. Mandatory primary education starts at the age of six and continues for a duration of eight years. However, disparity in educational attainment between children from the richest and poorest wealth quintiles is evident at all levels of schooling. For example, in primary school, 67% of children from the richest quintile complete their education, compared to only 11% from the poorest quintile. Similarly, at the senior secondary level, only 43% of children from the richest quintile complete their education, while less than 2% of children from the poorest quintile do so. according to MICS EAGLE (2022) findings. Malawi ratified the CRC in 1991 and ratified the CPRD in 2009. According to MICS-EAGLE report, 14% of children aged 5 to 17 across the country have at least one functional difficulty. Children without functional difficulties have a 5% higher attendance rate at the primary level (94% vs 89%) and a 5% higher attendance rate at the lower secondary level (13% vs 7%) than their peers with functional difficulties.\n\nNote on UNESCO IICBA Research. IICBA recently launched a new program of applied research on teacher and education issues in Africa. A total of 200 publications have been completed from January to September 2023, including studies, discussion papers, training guides, reports, knowledge briefs, event summaries, and interviews. Several of those publications focus on Malawi. All publications are available on IICBA’s website.\n\nCountry Policies\n\nInformation on Malawi’s education system and policies is available on the website of the Ministry of Education which covers basic and higher education while the Ministry of Labour covers technical education and vocational training (TVET). The National Education Sector Plan (2020-2030) is the flagship policy guiding the sector. The 2019 Malawi Education Sector Analysis report provides information on pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary, and adult education. Malawi does have a teaching service commission.\n\nA few organizations aim to capture education policies on specific themes across countries, including Malawi. UNESCO’s Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER) covering the themes of the Global Education Monitoring reports, including: inclusion in education (2020 Report), non-state actors in education (2021/22 Report), technology in education (2023 Report) and leadership in education (2024/25 Report, forthcoming). PEER also covers additional topics on key SDG 4 issues, including financing for equity, climate change communication and education, and comprehensive sexuality education.\n\nKnowledge Repositories\n\nOnly a few links to the literature on education by theme for Malawi, Africa, and globally were provided earlier to keep the brief short, but repositories of digital resources facilitate access to the literature. A few of those repositories are listed below by alphabetical order:\n\n3ie Development Evidence Portal (DEP): DEP is a repository of rigorous evidence on what works in international development, including in the area of education.\n\nAERD: The African Education Research Database hosted by the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge collates research by African scholars on education.\n\nAfrican Development Bank: The Bank has publications that cover a range of topics, including education. It also hosts ADEA which also has selected publications.\n\nGlobal Partnership for Education: GPE is one of the largest funders for education in Africa. It collaborates with Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to build and mobilize evidence on education through the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE KIX), which has a Library of research outputs.\n\nJ-PAL: The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab maintains a database of impact evaluations and policy publications, quite a few of which are about education.\n\nRePEc: Research Papers in Economics is a large archive of research on economics, including the economics of education. It can be searched through IDEAS.\n\nTeacher Task Force (TTF): The TTF is collaborative across many organizations hosted by UNESCO. It maintains a Knowledge Hub with resources on teacher policies.\n\nUNESCO HQ: UNESCO is the lead agency in the UN systems on education. Its Digital Library includes UNESCO Open Access which includes most UNESCO publications.\n\nUNESCO GEM: UNESCO publishes annually a Global Education Monitoring Report on a different theme each year with associated resources and background papers.\n\nUNESCO IICBA: IICBA is a Category 1 Institute at UNESCO. It conducts research on education in Africa with several publication series and maintains a digital repository.\n\nUNICEF: Publications can be found under Reports, the Office of Global Insight and Policy, and the Office of Research. Also of interest is the Data Must Speak initiative.\n\nWorld Bank: The Open Knowledge Repository provides access to the Bank’s research. It includes a section on Africa with country pages including for Malawi.\n\nMany organizations maintain websites that include country pages with useful information. Examples include the GPE Malawi Country Page; World Bank Malawi Country Page; UNESCO IIEP Country Page. Many organizations also maintain blogs on education issues, often with stories on Africa. Examples include Education for All (Global Partnership for Education), Education for Global Development (World Bank), Education Plus Development (Brookings Institutions), and World Education Blog (UNESCO). Beyond blogs focusing on education, blogs on Africa more generally may also provide useful resources. This includes Africa Can End Poverty and Nasikiliza (the World Bank’s two blogs for sub-Saharan Africa ) and Arab Voices (the Bank’s blog for the Middle East and North Africa).\n\nData\n\nIt is often useful to download data for Malawi and other countries from multi-country databases. The largest database on development, including education data, is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). The World Bank also maintain the Education Statistics (EdStats) database. Both World Bank databases rely in part for education on data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics. UNESCO also maintains the Global Education Observatory and the World Inequality Database in Education (WIDE), as well as a wide range of other databases. Specific estimates are occasionally maintained by other agencies. For example, UNICEF provides data on out-of-school rates, adjusted net attendance rates, completion rates, foundational learning skills, information communication technology skills, youth and adult literacy rates, and school-age digital connectivity. Another useful reference is StatCompiler which provides data at various levels of aggregation from Demographic and Health Surveys across countries and over time, including Malawi. For comparison purposes, data from the OECD for member and partner countries (including South Africa) can be useful.\n\nReferences\n\nReferences are available through the links provided in this brief."
