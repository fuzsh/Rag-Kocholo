We were treated to a presentation from an extremely talented young Belmont Academy pupil, called Matthew McColm. He has set up his own company, DevelopX Creative, which designs and develops brands that help tell clients’ stories. DevelopmentX specialise in accessible design for create user-friendly interfaces for fast-growing start-ups and public sector bodies and powerful branding for start-ups. Brand refresh or a new website are DevelopX’s specialities.

“Not only is their design work brilliant, but they are also someone who listens, has a great approach to feedback and learning, has a positive and friendly attitude, and has been a real pleasure” is a quote from a senior officer from an existing client.

DevelopmentX created a beautiful website for the Tarbolton Community Council that is fully accessible to WCAG 2.1 Standards.

Even in with his young age, which Matthew admitted was and still is an obstacle to his business, he has secured contracts with some major local companies, however he still allots many, many hours to charitable causes.

Through VASA (Voluntary Action South Ayrshire) Matthew has been working towards the Saltire Awards which are the Scottish Government’s way of celebrating, recognising and rewarding the commitment, contribution and achievements of young volunteers aged 12-25 in Scotland. These awards are delivered locally.

For young people, the Saltire Awards are progressive meaning they can achieve awards over four levels:

The Challenge

The Approach

The Ascent

The Summit

The Awards also fit neatly with the national Curriculum for Excellence helping youngsters to become a successful learner, confident individual, responsible citizen and effective.
