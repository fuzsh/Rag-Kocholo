        "text": "Cybersecurity is huge challenge and risk of our time. Everyone is affected, and risks to low-capacity organizations are even greater. We need more experts to help address this challenge. There is new government program that provides scholarships for students who commit to working to help government address this challenge. If you know students interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity and other tech, info here https://sfs.opm.gov/\n\nInstitutions are moving to adopt a new bachelor's degree format. A few months ago Brigham Young University - Idaho and Ensign College received approval from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities to offer a 3-year bachelor's degree. This was made possible by eliminating electives and reducing the credit hour requirement from 120 to 90. Yesterday, American Public University has announced the launch of a 3-year bachelor's degree in #cybersecurity after receiving approval from accrediting bodies. #highereducation #marketresearch #regulation #onlinelearning #onlinedegree https://lnkd.in/eG45qGXz\n\nCelebrating the completion of my Master's in Cybersecurity from Purdue! üéì Key insights: 1. Be studious rather than curious and ask more questions. ü§î It drives collective enlightenment‚Äîembrace the conversational learning model. 2. Cyber talent needs passion beyond profit. ‚ù§Ô∏è Diversity of background enriches our field. 3. Education must lay the groundwork, teaching us to navigate the abstractions of cyber. üß† It‚Äôs about adapting fast, not just knowing tools. Here‚Äôs to applying these lessons at the helm. üöÄ You can view my work, and papers, and watch several of my presentations here üòÅ [Grad School Papers and Presentations](https://lnkd.in/gDiDiM5r)\n\nAuthorship attribution of code involves identifying the creator of a given piece of code, especially in the context of increasing malware and sophisticated mutation techniques that result in a proliferation of malware variants. Addressing this challenge requires methods to examine the authorship of malicious code, and code authorship attribution techniques prove crucial in identifying and categorizing malware authors. This information aids in predicting the tools and techniques employed by specific malware authors, as well as the propagation and evolution of the malware. Yesterday, we had the Deans Award for Research Excellence (DARE) presentations and award ceremony, which fosters collaboration between gifted undergraduates and faculty for impactful research. I am delighted to announce that Xie He, who contributed to one of our projects at the Behaviour-Centric Cybersecurity Center (BCCC) entitled \"How wrote this code? AI know it!\" received the DARE Poster Honorable Mention award.

I'm just 4 days from the official start of my Doctorate program. I finished the Orientation earlier this week and today, took advantage of the Early Access to my first two courses. I've already written my introduction and initial discussion board posts. Next up, a couple of 5-page papers! I often emphasize to my students that maintaining momentum is crucial in their degree program. Consistency in daily efforts is key to sustaining progress and achieving success! #momentum #cybersecurity #doctoralstudent\n\nLast week I finished my second #Engineering degree, computer engineering, with an average grade of 8.9. Good grade but ugly üò¢ My final project was a #CTFs competition on offensive security for the students of the UNED. After 12 straight years studying mathematics and computer science, I am not tired of studying (quite the opposite in fact) but I am tired of taking exams. And tbh, maybe I'm a little burnt out too. Nothing important, but it's many years doing exams and more exams and trying to do my best in each one of them. Now it's time for a little rest... but I am also looking forward to continue doing bug bounty, research and publishing on my blog. I have a lot of interesting material to publish that I couldn't publish before due to lack of time. Good luck in your goals, almost everything can be achieved with effort and illusion. #cybersecurity #security #informationsecurity #infosec #pentest #pentesting #cybersec #websecurity #hacking #ethicalhacking #vulnerabilities #engineer #EngineeringLife #EngineeringStudents\n\nWelcome to Purdue Polytechnic‚Äôs What‚Äôs Next series! In this series we highlight recent grads and share examples of the endless potential for Purdue Polytechnic students. Join us in celebrating their achievements and wishing them well in all that is coming next! üëè Our first highlighted graduate is Apoorva Shrivastava, a recent Cybersecurity graduate. What‚Äôs Next for Apoorva? A position as a Cyber Defense and Engineering Associate! Congratulations Apoorva and to all of our inspiring graduates! #PurdueWeDidIt #IndustryReadyDayOne"
