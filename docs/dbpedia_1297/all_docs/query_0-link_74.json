        "text": "The Amazing Selene (Jacinda Barrett) is the villainess in the 1998 episode \"Do You Believe In Magic?\" for the TV series \"NightMan\".\n\nThe episode starts off with Johnny Domino (Matt McColm) playing the saxophone in a nightclub. While he is playing, a beautiful girl wanders in and sits down. However, he has a vision of her changing into a demon. When he finishes playing, he walks over to the bar and introduces herself as Lucy Devlin, who is working for Billboard Magazine. She knows all about his playing career as well as his extra curricular activities.\n\nLater that night Johnny is attacked in his apartment by the NightMan suit remotely. He wakes up terrified, and the suit is missing. He determines that it was during a nervanic nightmare.\n\nLucy is hired as a magician entertainer at the House of Soul anniversary party by Jessica Rodgers (Felecia M. Bell). As a performer, she is known as The Amazing Selene. However, she uses black magic techniques to send Charlie, Frank and Raleigh to another dimension, where they find themselves in their own private hell. Charlie a police officer is suddenly locked up with a criminal he was responsible to bringing to justice. Frank, Johnny's father finds himself at his son's 8 year-old birthday party. Raleigh finds himself driving in a convertible roadster and being pulled over by Charlie a police officer, who suddenly doesn't know him. After threatening he would arrest him, and then letting him go, Charlie is pulled over by a second police car. Now there are two Charlie's attempting to arrest him.\n\nIt is soon discovered that Selene is a monstrous witch/sorceress who assumes a female human form as Lucy Devlin. Besides the magic she performs, she also is seen playing with tarot cards. By touching the cards, NightMan is sent to his own dimension, where he reunites with his deceased mother Betsy.\n\nHe is later able to overcome Selene's tricks by changing into the NightMan suit and winning the battles for his friends and bringing them back to reality.\n\nJohnny is able to get a death grip on Selene, but the vision begins to fade away. The last thing we hear her say is that Johnny turned out to be more formidable then they thought he would be, and that they will be watching him. Johnny soon wakes up from what appears to be a dream, and it is soon unclear if the whole thing was reality or just one of Johnny's dreams.\n\nJohnny later relives himself playing at the club and having Lucy walk in. When she asks if he can interview him, Johnny responds that he doesn't do interviews. That is the end of the episode."
