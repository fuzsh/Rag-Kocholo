PRODUCT INFORMATION / SALES TERMS AND CONDITIONS We provide accurate and high-quality images that represent our products. While most photos in this listing show the actual product, we may use a stock image for rare instances of multiple quantities or brand new items. However, rest assured that the product you receive will be identical in quality and functionality to the one in the photos. Our goal is to help you make an informed decision and be fully satisfied with your purchase. Important Information for DVD/Blu-ray Customers: Please note that many commercially-produced DVD movies and TV shows are region-coded and may only play on players manufactured for the same region as the disc. Some DVDs, however, are not region-coded and will play on any player. Please review the region coding information provided in our listings to confirm compatibility with your equipment. These are the DVD region codes: Region 1 - Canada, the United States and U.S. territories. Region 2 - Japan, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East (including Egypt) and Greenland. Region 3 - Southeast Asia, and East Asia (including Hong Kong). Region 4 - Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Central America, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. Region 5 - Eastern Europe, Russia, the Indian Subcontinent, Africa, North Korea, and Mongolia. Region 6 - China. Region 0 - There is no region coding and it should work on all players. Before making a purchase, we strongly recommend that you review the listing title for the keywords 'R4,' 'Reg 4,' or 'Region 4' to determine whether the DVD is specifically produced for the Australian market. As we sell items worldwide, we may also carry some hard-to-find items that are only released on Region 1. PAL and NTSC are two different video encoding systems used by different countries and regions around the world. PAL is primarily used in Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia, while NTSC is used in North America, Japan, and some parts of South America. These two systems are not compatible with each other, which means that a PAL-formatted DVD may not play on an NTSC DVD player and vice versa. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you check the listing information for any information on PAL or NTSC encoding, as well as the region coding information, to ensure that the disc is compatible with your DVD player or Blu-ray player. If you're unsure about the compatibility of a particular disc or need help in selecting a player that is compatible with both PAL and NTSC, please feel free to contact us for assistance. We want to ensure that you can enjoy your items without any issues. The Blu-ray Disc region codes are as follows: Region A: North America, South America, U.S. Territories, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and other areas of Southeast Asia Region B: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. Region C: Asia (except for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other areas of Southeast Asia) Region FREE: This is not an official setting, but discs that have the region FREE symbol either have no flag set or have all region flags (A, B & C) set.
