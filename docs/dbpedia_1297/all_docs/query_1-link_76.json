        "text": "Welcome to this new Morning Jam. Expect some guitar magic embedded in full band settings, but also good old solo explorations.\n\nSlowly the fall is creeping in here in the mountains. I think this mix is a nice soundtrack to this time of year. I would probably say the same in spring or in the winter, but no, there are traces of the summer in here - listen yourself.\n\nThis mix opens with James Elkington & Nathan Salsburg from their 2011 release Avos. There is something new coming up on Paradise of Bachelors and you already know that you need this, right?\n\nOriginally I planned to put some field recordings by Matthew Mullane on here, but they were all pretty harsh and kind of out of context, so it's just his beautiful guitar work on his latest VDQS release.\n\nM.Mucci has a new release coming up as well, Tyler Higgins is new on Scissor Tails Recordings and Jon Collins has build new wooden boxes for his new releases. Much more on here that I don't need to describe.\n\nEnjoy this Morning Jam.\n\nDownload 8tracks Mixcloud\n\nPlaylist\n\nJames Elkington & Nathan Salsburg Hospitality\n\nMatthew Mullane Knife, Hut and Thatch\n\nM.
