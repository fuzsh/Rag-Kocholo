        "text": "Association football club in Glasgow City, Scotland, UK\n\nFootball club\n\nBroomhill Football Club is a Scottish football club that plays its home matches at Dumbarton Football Stadium in Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire. They are members of the Scottish Lowland Football League, in the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system. The club was formed in 2014 as BSC Glasgow, a senior team associated with Broomhill Sports Club, a youth sports organisation based in the Broomhill area of Glasgow, and was elected to the Lowland League for the 2014–15 season. They originally shared with Maryhill F.C. at their Lochburn Park ground before relocating to Alloa in 2016. In 2021, the senior team split from Broomhill Sports Club, who launched a new BSC Glasgow team in the development division of the West of Scotland Football League, with the senior team being renamed Broomhill F.C. and retaining the Lowland League place.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBroomhill Sports Club was founded in Broomhill, Glasgow, in June 2004 as a multi-sports club for local children. By 2014 the club had grown to cater for 700 children in various sports, but primarily football.\n\nBSC Glasgow F.C. was launched in 2014 as a senior football team to provide a pathway into adult football for players from the youth teams.[1] The club successfully applied to join the Scottish Lowland Football League for the 2014–15 season, and won the SFA South Region Challenge Cup in their first season.\n\nFrom there BSC went on to reach the Lowland League Cup Final in 2016–17 and the South Challenge Cup final in 2017–18 before taking home the Lowland League Cup trophy in 2018–19. BSC Glasgow's improving fortunes in the Scottish Lowland Football League coincided with the arrival of manager Stephen Swift, who claimed a third-place finish in 2017–18 and a runners up place in 2018–19.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the club officially announced its separation from BSC Glasgow and changed its name to Broomhill Football Club,[2] retaining their membership of the Scottish Lowland League and Scottish Football Association while BSC Glasgow entered a new entity, an amateur team in the Development section of the West of Scotland Football League.[3]\n\nIn May 2022, the club announced a partnership with football media brand Open Goal, beginning from the 2022–23 season. The team rebranded as Open Goal Broomhill, with professional footballer and Open Goal podcast host Simon Ferry becoming the team's manager.[4] The roll-out mainly consisted of club-related content across Open Goal's platform, including a monthly, fly-on-the-wall documentary.[5] In March 2023, the club confirmed that their commercial partnership with Open Goal would conclude at the end of the season, with Ferry and his assistant coaches, Derek Lyle and Paul Slane, all stepping down from their respective roles as a result.[6][7]\n\nIn May 2023 the club, having reverted to their original name, announced the return of manager Stephen Swift [8] and later announced a five-year deal to move to the Dumbarton Football Stadium where the club stated their aim to grow their fanbase and make the town their permanent home.[9]\n\nGround\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the 2016–17 season, the club reached an agreement with Scottish League One side Alloa Athletic to share Recreation Park, with a view to the club reaching their long-term goal of having their own facility located in Glasgow.[10] The club previously ground-shared with Maryhill at Lochburn Park for their first two seasons in the Lowland League.\n\nFor the 2022–23 season, as part of the commercial agreement with Open Goal, the club played their home games at Broadwood Stadium, Cumbernauld.[11]\n\nCurrent squad\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 6 August 2024[12]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\nClub staff\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2 July 2024\n\nPosition Name Manager Zander Diamond Assistant manager Gordon Wylde First-team coach Martin Mooney Goalkeeper coach Vacant Physiotherapist Vacant\n\nSeason-by-season records\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason Division Tier League Scottish Cup Finish Played Wins Draws Losses Points BSC Glasgow F.C. 2014–15 Lowland League 5 10th 26 7 9 10 30 Did Not Participate 2015–16 Lowland League 5 7th 28 12 5 11 41 1st Round Replay, losing to Auchinleck Talbot 2016–17 Lowland League 5 7th 30 12 6 12 42 2nd Round, losing to Beith Juniors 2017–18 Lowland League 5 3rd 30 20 5 5 65 2nd Round, losing to Buckie Thistle 2018–19 Lowland League 5 2nd 28 18 7 3 61 3rd Round, losing to Forfar Athletic 2019–20 Lowland League 5 3rd† 22 16 3 3 51 5th Round, losing to Hibernian 2020–21 Lowland League 5 4th† 13 9 3 1 30 Preliminary Round Two, losing to Haddington Athletic Broomhill F.C. 2021–22 Lowland League 5 15th 34 10 4 20 34 2nd Round, losing to Tranent Juniors 2022–23 Lowland League 5 11th 36 15 6 15 51 3rd Round, losing to Alloa Athletic\n\n† Season curtailed due to coronavirus pandemic – At the end of the 2019–20 season, BSC claimed 3rd spot over East Stirlingshire due to points per game average.[13]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nLowland Football League\n\nRunners-up: 2018–19\n\nSFA South Region Challenge Cup\n\nWinners: 2014–15\n\nRunners-up: 2017–18, 2019–20\n\nLowland League Cup\n\nWinners: 2018–19\n\nRunners-up: 2016–17\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
