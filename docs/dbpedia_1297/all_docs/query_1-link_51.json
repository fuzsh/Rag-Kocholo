        "text": "Chances are you saw acoustic guitarist Daniel Bachman’s artwork before you ever heard his music. The cover art for Jack Rose’s posthumous final LP, Luck In the Valley, was originally a poster that a teenaged Bachman and his sister Sarah made for a show that they set up for Rose. But that same year, Bachman started releasing instrumental records, first under the name Sacred Harp and later under his own name. There have also been collaborative, limited-release cassettes with Ryley Walker, Matthew Sage and Ian McColm. Bachman’s upcoming fourth LP, Orange Co. Serenade (Bathetic), encompasses rustic slide excursions, rushing finger-picked fantasias, and a stirring hymn.\n\n1. John Fahey — Days Have Gone By Vol. 6: I played the first show I ever played in Philadelphia in 2006. I wasn’t really doing a guitar thing back then — mostly banjos, effects and tapes bullshit. That night I heard a mix of Fahey and Rose cuts and before I split town. I went to AKA Records and got this CD. I listened to it on repeat the whole four and a half hours home, and still today I have a profound emotional reaction to the whole thing. I don’t think I have ever had my head split open like that before, and if I hadn’t heard this record, I really doubt I’d be doing any of this.\n\n2. Virgil Anderson — On the Tennessee Line: County Records put this out, and it was recorded by Bobby Fulcher I’m guessing in the mid to late ’70s. Has a real good time feel — super bluesy — like Dock Boggs but more laid back. I go back to this over and over again — “Green Ford Blues!” Really interesting harmonic picking on it. If I didn’t play the guitar, I’d like to play the banjo exactly like Virgil did.\n\n3. James Luther Dickinson — Dixie Fried: The first time I heard the opening track on this record I felt like I got punched in the face. “You get a nickel / I’ll get a dime / We’ll go out / And buy / some / wine!” With the full chorus coming in — it’s insane. A whole lotta fun to listen to with all the proper electric effects — bleeps, swirls and funk — making it truly Dixie-fried. The tracks “John Brown” and “Wild Bill Jones” are burners for sure.\n\n4. Link Wray — Link Wray: Link is a big deal around where I grew up because the Fredericksburg, Virginia, armory is where he apparently took his famous pen knife out and jabbed the holes in the speaker, creating that fuzz and apparently based his song Rumble after that gig. Here is the local paper story about that. Regardless, this album really added a lot to a ton of summer days and nights driving around and being an idiot. I still get goosebumps when “Fire and Brimstone” kicks in, and it’s great to drink a lot of beer to.\n\n5. Michael Hurley — Live 12/17/1986: I don’t know exactly where this was recorded, but I know it’s from Germany from some of the audience members’ yelling and accents. The stage banter is fantastic — and it’s a little over an hour of all the tunes you want to hear with a tight band. I’ve listened to this so much since I got it a couple years ago and would be really fantastic if someone would bootleg it eventually.\n\n6. Grateful Dead Mix Volume 2 by Greg Davis: My parents like the Dead; I grew up not really liking the Dead all that much. I tried through high school a little bit but didn’t really get it until Arthur magazine put this podcast out by Greg Davis. I was on tour and had this on my iPod and was driving between Northampton and Boston with one of my best friends on the 4th of July. (For real, it was a great day.) After we listened to it down, I finally got it — and ever since then I’ve only been taking it deeper.\n\n7. Ernest Martin — That Last Inauguration:This is one of my favorite records. Ernest recorded for Rich R Tone records in the ’40s and then began a career as a radio evangelist — he even shared stages with the great Brother Claude Ely. This is the only record I have of Martin’s because a lot of them were privately pressed and distributed only by Martin himself. This album however gives me all that I want out of that spooky bluegrass gospel — partly because Martin came from that older generation of players. His voice is so powerful and he was a hell of a banjo player. It’s the real deal old mossy shit.\n\n7. Wolf Eyes — Dead Hills: When I was 15, I worked for a local label stuffing records for tacos and $20 every now and again. I got so much music from working there and a ton of stuff that really flipped my pancake, man. Because then I was mostly into AC/DC. I remember I got this CD and I had never listened to it — and one night we were driving around these backroads real late at night and turned this thing up real loud and everyone in the car freaked the fuck out man. I think my friend Mary started crying and my other buddy just had his head out the window screaming. We had a lot of fun, man.\n\n8. Lewis Brothers — “Sally Johnson”: This is just one of four sides that the brothers recorded in El Paso in 1929. This Sally Johnson just keeps rolling. It’s one of the sturdiest songs I’ve ever heard. They never let it drop; they keep it rolling so hard. Look it up. It’s so good it’s absurd.\n\n9. Duane & Gregg Allman — Duane & Greg Allman: I was in Los Angeles two years ago on tour with Meg Baird, and we were staying with one of her really good old buddies. They were talking about being in college and drinking instant coffee and playing this record, so I guess they put it on afterwards. I happened to find it a couple days later at Amoeba, and it’s right up there with my favorites. Released May ’72 — but originally recorded in ’68. The “Morning Dew” that kicks this thing off is so good. And “In The Morning When I’m Real” — I mean what else do you need?\n\nFor a sampling of artists and songs from Bachman’s Listed — minus Virgil Anderson and Ernest Martin, sadly — check out the Spotify playlist below."
