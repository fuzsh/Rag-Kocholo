        "text": "American actor\n\nExternal image McColm as Jonathan Slade in Subterfuge (1996).\n\nMatt McColm (born January 31, 1965) is an American actor and stuntman, and former model.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in 1965,[1] he has a twin brother named Mark. His family comes from Santa Barbara.[2] He attended Bishop Garcia Diego High School.\n\nHe has modeled for Ralph Lauren, Gianni Versace, Calvin Klein, and Doug Ordway early in his career.[2][3][4] In the 1990s he was one of the top male models.[5] As an actor, he is best known for portraying Johnny Domino, the lead character in the 1997–1999 television series Night Man,[6] and Agent Thompson, the assassin who kills Trinity at the climax of The Matrix Reloaded (2003). He also appeared as Vick Chamberlain, a T-888 Terminator in the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008). McColm also portrayed the henchman of Jason Statham in the 2004 film Cellular.[7]\n\nMcColm has a black belt in Kenpo Karate,[8][6][2] and was known for his heavily muscular physique. He served as Arnold Schwarzenegger's body double in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).[2] Often playing macho-type characters, he starred in multiple low-budget action films during the 90s, the first one being Red Scorpion 2 (1994)—a sequel to the Dolph Lundgren vehicle.[6] In a movie, which is largely unrelated to the first installment, McColm appears as a leading hero Nick Stone, an agent of the National Security Agency. The actor's next entry in the action genre came with the 1996 movie Subterfuge, co-starring Jason Gould (as Alfie Slade) and Richard Brake. McColm portrayed Jonathan Slade, a retired military hero carrying out a secret task for the Central Intelligence Agency. The movie was called \"a mediocre spy-thriller,\"[9] but its cast received some praise. Writing for Ultimate Action Movies, Andrew Babcock opined that McColm \"had the it factor,\" and \"gave a very likable performance.\"[8] He concluded that \"McColm simply knows action\" and is \"an underrated performer.\"[8] An editor from Comeuppance Reviews stated that \"McColm is a far better central hero than, say, Frank Zagarino, and his meatheadiness contrasts well with his brother in classic ‘odd couple’ fashion.\"[10]\n\nHe was named \"the new action star of the 90s\" by the International Producers' Association (IPA).[11] Robert W. Welkos of Los Angeles Times declared that McColm might be \"Hollywood's next generation action star,\" following in the footsteps of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.[12] In 1997 he appeared in the lead role in the Jack Gill-directed film The Protector. Portraying Kenneth James Conway, an ex-commando and a private detective,[13] he had a chance to impress the audiences with both his martial arts skills and a perfect musculature.[13][6][14] In a review for The Unknown Movies McColm's role was summarized positively: \"He looks good, shows that he knows a fair bit about martial arts, and he does seem to be putting some effort in his performance.\"[13] Another favorable commentary was written by Action-Flix: McColm was believed to be \"totally charismatic in the hero role,\" and his physical expression was compared to that of an \"80s jock.\"[6] Likewise, the performance was praised by a cinema-related website Dammaged Goods: \"Stunt performer turned leading man Matt McColm plays Conway with rogue charm while flexing his muscles and martial arts prowess. Ruggedly handsome, McColm doesn't take things too seriously and is a likeable enough hero.\"[14]\n\nIn Acts of Betrayal (1997) McColm appears as Lance Cooper, an FBI agent who must protect a damsel in distress.[15] The same year he also starred in a low-budget action movie Fight and Revenge, which is believed to be lost nowadays.[6] He played the lead character, Sergeant John Trenton, an American commando, captured and tortured for information during his mission.[16][7] In 1999 the actor filmed his scenes for the Clint Eastwood-directed adventure drama Space Cowboys. He portrayed the U.S. Air Force navigator named \"Tank\" Sullivan as a young man, while James Garner played his older self.[17] The movie was released in August 2000 to positive critical reception.[18]\n\nHe was set to return as Agent Thompson in The Matrix Resurrections (2021),[19] although his character never appeared in the final film.\n\nHe was set to star as a lead in a Jack Abramoff-produced, 25 million dollars-costing action–adventure movie called An Act of Courage. It was supposed to be filmed in Malaysia in 1992.[2][11]\n\nHis twin brother Mark did stand-in for him in several television and movie shows. McColm's stunt performer credits include Cyborg (1989), Pearl Harbor (2001), Argo (2012), The Wolverine (2013), and about seventy five other titles. In the official 2021 write-up for the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, it is written that \"square-jawed McColm has been an in-demand stuntman for over thirty years.\"[20]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\n1985 St. Elsewhere (TV series) as College Kid\n\n1988 They Live as Police Officer\n\n1989 Cyborg as Pirate / Bandit\n\n1991-2001 Baywatch (TV series) as Frank Riddick / Derek Hart / Drew Lawrence\n\n1991 Night of the Warrior as Still Model\n\n1994 The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (TV series) as Lieutenant Rayford\n\n1994 Red Scorpion 2 as Nick Stone\n\n1996 Subterfuge as Jonathan Slade\n\n1996 Mask of Death as Man\n\n1996 American Tigers as Man\n\n1997-1999 Night Man (TV series) as Johnny Domino / Nightman\n\n1997 NightMan (TV movie) as Johnny Domino / Nightman\n\n1997 The Protector (aka Body Armor; Conway) as Kenneth James Conway\n\n1997 Acts of Betrayal as Lance Cooper\n\n1997 Fight and Revenge as Sergeant John Trenton\n\n2000 Space Cowboys as Young Tank Sullivan\n\n2001 Bette (TV series) as Handsome Man\n\n2006 CSI: Miami (TV series) as Jake Richmond\n\n2003 The Matrix Reloaded as Agent Thompson\n\n2003 Enter the Matrix (video game) as Agent Thompson (voice)\n\n2004 Cellular as Detective Deason\n\n2005 The L Word (TV series) as Bouncer\n\n2005 The Island as Cop\n\n2005 Confessions of an Action Star (aka Sledge: The Untold Story) as Commander\n\n2005 Criminal Minds (TV series) as SWAT #1\n\n2006 Southland Tales as Bar Bouncer\n\n2007 Live Free or Die Hard as Terrorist\n\n2008-2009 Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TV series) as Vick Chamberlain\n\n2009 Knight Rider (TV series) as First Henchman\n\n2010 Iron Man 2 as Guard\n\n2011 The Mechanic as Bodyguard\n\n2011 The Hit List as Squad Car Cop\n\n2011 The Double as Guard #2\n\n2012 Argo as Fighting Movie Star\n\n2013 R.I.P.D. as Male Cop\n\n2014 John Wick as Club Goon[21]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
