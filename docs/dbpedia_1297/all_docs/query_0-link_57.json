Iâ€™ve already written $10k in premium for September. $7500 is from the campaign and a few other drips. \"\n\nJosh Chambers\n\nAgent\n\nâ˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant has been absolutely vital in the growth of our agency. It handles all my automation, prospecting, servicing, cold calling, I could go on but I'll spare you a list of 100 things. Either way, Agency Elephant has all my tools in one place.

From simple task reminders, quote follow up to reminding my customers of upcoming renewals, AE is the most all inclusive automation and communication tool on the market! AE doubles as my sales and service employee that I only have to pay $1.50/hour. This system gives me the freedom to focus on income generating opportunities as it follows up on all my non income generating tasks (claims, payments, documents etc). In other words, this system is highkey straight fire ðŸ”¥.\"\n\nJosh Miner\n\nAgent\n\nâ˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant, for my agency has been a huge help as it keeps the servicing aspect automated, needed signatures for apps or endorsement, appointment reminder for both us and the clients, claimâ€™s touches to let the clients know we are here for them, touches throughout the year that show that we care and also asking if they need anything changed or updated..\"\n\nJohnny Castaneda\n\nAgent\n\nâ˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant has been a critical edition to our Agency over the last three years.
