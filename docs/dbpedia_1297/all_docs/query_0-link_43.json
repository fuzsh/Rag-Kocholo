        "text": "About Us\n\nOur team is made up of a group of agents that couldn‚Äôt find the right solution for agency communications. So we made one.\n\nOur Vision\n\nAn Elephant Never Forgets\n\nFirstly, Agency Elephant was created out of necessity, and to disrupt the norm of agency communications. To clarify, Insurance Agents and staff were spending countless hours doing repetitive tasks, not delivering every customer a consistent experience, and missing important follow-up that led to new business and cross sell opportunities. Therefore, we designed Agency Elephant to be the missing link for all agencies. It took us several years to deliver an all in one agency communications platform because we wanted something that ‚Äúdid it all‚Äù and eliminated the need for multiple other single feature services agents were using and trying to integrate to work seamlessly.\n\nIn addition, the team at Agency Elephant has over 35 years of combined insurance experience with a vast knowledge of best practices for agency communications. We keep our finger on the pulse of new and emerging technology, and deliver it into an industry that has been slow to adapt to the digital age. As a result, our goal is to give you a tool that can truly be your best employee, that never calls in sick, never takes a day off, consistently cultivates more opportunity for your agency, and does everything you say, every time.\n\nSubsequently, our users are no longer wasting payroll dollars trying to do everything manually for communications from their agency. Moreover, when you can create the perfect verbiage, delivery method, and timing to every agency situation, agencies are more consistent, and time is of the abundance. Our mission was to give agencies freedom. Freedom to go have lunch with that Loan Officer, and not miss an important follow up. Freedom to go to their kids sporting events in the middle of a work day, and have opportunities pop up on their phone and in their systems while there. The Freedom to hire new staff, and already have the perfect blueprint for success.\n\nFAQ\n\nAgency Elephant is ideal for anyone who has an existing database of past customers or is looking to bring in a rush of brand new prospects.

The possibilities are endless. Save yourself time and money by replacing an employee with technology that never calls in or needs benefits.\"\n\nJamie Blair\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.6/5\n\n\"I‚Äôm pretty slammed right now. I‚Äôve already written $10k in premium for September. $7500 is from the campaign and a few other drips. \"\n\nJosh Chambers\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant has been absolutely vital in the growth of our agency. It handles all my automation, prospecting, servicing, cold calling, I could go on but I'll spare you a list of 100 things. Either way, Agency Elephant has all my tools in one place. I often get presented with other options that offer 1 feature of what AE does for me and typically it is the same cost as what AE costs me. No need to piece together 3 different services for your agency when you can use Agency Elephant for all of your needs!\"\n\nZaheed Hussain\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"Just like houses require a strong foundation. Businesses are built on Strong Communication. Every part of my Agency has been set to light speed by Agency Elephant. From Follow up to Google Reviews, my Agency couldn't function without it. We are on track to hit 200 google reviews and $2.5 million in premium in 2.5 years due to Agency Elephant. .\"\n\nCharles McDade\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"I couldn‚Äôt imagine running my agency without the help of Agency Elephant. From simple task reminders, quote follow up to reminding my customers of upcoming renewals, AE is the most all inclusive automation and communication tool on the market! AE doubles as my sales and service employee that I only have to pay $1.50/hour. This system gives me the freedom to focus on income generating opportunities as it follows up on all my non income generating tasks (claims, payments, documents etc). In other words, this system is highkey straight fire üî•.\"\n\nJosh Miner\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant, for my agency has been a huge help as it keeps the servicing aspect automated, needed signatures for apps or endorsement, appointment reminder for both us and the clients, claim‚Äôs touches to let the clients know we are here for them, touches throughout the year that show that we care and also asking if they need anything changed or updated..\"\n\nJohnny Castaneda\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"Agency Elephant has been a critical edition to our Agency over the last three years. From texting the millennials to setting up enrollment reminders to our seniors, it has been a game changer. We can focus on more time with the clients and have quality conversations that lead to sales. Having Agency Elephant in your back pocket was the second-best decision that we made. The first was opening an Agency.\"\n\nMatt McColm\n\nAgent\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4.8/5\n\n\"The amount of time saved simply by putting a few admittedly simply automations in place has saved me thousands in payroll because AE only asks for a few dollars a month and more than earns it's keep which as an agency owner AE is one of my favorite employees.\"\n\nMike Cardoso\n\nAgent\n\nPrebuilt Campaigns\n\n0 +\n\nAgent Sign Ups\n\n0 +\n\noutbound activities yearly\n\n0 M+\n\nUnlimited\n\npossibilities"
