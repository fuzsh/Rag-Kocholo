        "text": "They don't come up with anything new, but it's bigger, louder, and mighty impressive, even if the dialogue sounds more and more like a preprogrammed video game.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nThe film entertains despite its structural shortcomings, as the Wachowskis have created a cinematic world that’s a pleasure to experience, even though it’s not as satisfying as its predecessor.\n\nJuly 12, 2022\n\nIt’s more of a teenage fantasy than ever before, overflowing with stoic figures in black garb, machine guns, stabbing weapons, car chases, and seductive women, even if it’s difficult to discount the utterly mesmerizing, sustained highway chase sequence.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nWhile not the all-guns-blazing 5-out-of-5 its predecessor was I still find The Matrix Reloaded a fun film, full of a fun sci-fi plot and plenty of crazy action sequences.\n\nDecember 15, 2021\n\nThe whole film may be more than a bit suspect cerebrally, with dime-store philosophy, potted mysticism and cut-price otherworldliness, but visually it gives full value as a virtuoso workout for your senses.\n\nJanuary 10, 2018\n\nIndeed, if you loved the first Matrix and its mix of comic-book angst, martial arts, virtual reality, video-game punch-ups, pop philosophy, biblical subtext, romance, tragedy and pathos, then you won't be disappointed.\n\nJanuary 2, 2018\n\nThough introducing some new ideas and characters, Matrix Reloaded is not as exciting as the 1999 original, suffering from problems that often inflict middle chapters of trilogies.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nNot one of the worst sequels that has ever been put in movie theaters, and not one of the most disappointing... but, is it ever a grind.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
