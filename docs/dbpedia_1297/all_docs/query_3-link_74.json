        "text": "For this week’s Ass Whoopin Wednesday flick, I decided to choose one from one of my all time favorite action stars in the legendary muscles from Brussels Jean Claude Van Damme. The film for today is Cyborg which was his follow up to Bloodsport. Jean Claude Van Damme plays Gibson Rickenbacker, a slinger (or Mercenary) who lives in a plague infested world that goes on a mission to stop an evil pirate named Fender (Vincent Klyn) who has kidnapped a woman named Pearl (Dayle Haddon) who holds information that could cure the world of the plague. You see, Pearl worked with a group of scientists and in in order for her to go on this dangerous mission to deliver the cure, they turned her into a cyborg. Along with a straggler named Nady (Deborah Richter), they’ll try their best to save Pearl from Fender before he tries to cash in on the cure. The film also stars Alex Daniels (Pearl Harbor) as Marshall Strat, Ralf Moeller (Best Of The Best 2) as Brick Bardo, Terrie Batson (Attack of the Alien Jelly Monsters from the Depths of Uranus ) as Mary, Jophery C. Brown (Sudden Death) as Saloon Owner & other various roles, Matt McColm (Argo) as a pirate, and the film was directed by Albert Pyun (Kickboxer 2: The Road Back). Let’s take a look at the stats before we get to the review:\n\nJean Claude Van Damme may not have had the same number of kills as last week’s Jeff Speakman, but this film was an interesting move for The Muscles From Brussels. This was a very different kind of martial arts flick because it mixed elements of Sci-Fi into it which I believe was unheard of at the time. The idea was great, but the execution could have been a little bit better. I think they could have picked a better person to play Fender and whoever wrote the script has an obsession with guitars. Fender’s movements were stiff in my opinion compared to Jean Claude and his grunts were just too much to take or as I should say a little cheesy. One of the things that you’ll enjoy is the special effects especially when they tell Pearl’s story of how she became a cyborg and you have to remember that they were advancing on the special effects in an era with Terminator and Robocop. Jean Claude barely has any lines in the film and there is too much on the flashback end in this film as well, but I think it’s done to slowly reveal what happened to him. It’s almost like as far as the film goes, you see Jean Claude’s character change and it’s cause hes motivated by his flashbacks. I am a huge fan of Van Damme so I was a fan of this film, but there is definitely better films in his filmography. I am going to give this film three fists of five for a final grade."
