        "text": "The Wachowskis may have something in their theory that the world is simply a complex operating system humans are simply virtual programs.... Their dialogue feels written by a computer program, and for that matter acted by a collection of CGI figures.\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nPerhaps it’s wrong and narrow-minded to hope that the Wachowskis would only live up to their original film, but their brand of mythology expansion narrows the possibilities and limits the viewer’s enjoyment of this universe.\n\nJuly 12, 2022\n\nJust as much as the last entry was a piece of a story, this one is a fragment, telling so little of the yarn that it’s the least complex and most inessential of the series, save for the fact that it finally wraps up character loose ends.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nThere are things to like in the opening moments and the final showdown but the rest is either dull or visually unappealing CG bullet-fest scenes... or both, I guess.\n\nDecember 22, 2021\n\nOne only trusts that some of those who made vast and overextended claims for the first part of the trilogy have been awakened to reality by this latest nonsense, with any luck by the sound of their own howls of laughter.\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\nBilled as the final chapter, the [Wachowskis] cop out and leave hints of a potential fourth film. Here's a suggestion: Dump the franchise, because this series has clearly overstayed its welcome.\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nThe original Matrix was full of dizzying surprises. But it's turned out that the Wachowskis didn't have many more tricks up their sleeves.\n\nMarch 12, 2018\n\nAverages out to be a mildly better film than The Matrix Reloaded, mostly on account of being neither as good nor as bad in its peaks and valleys.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
