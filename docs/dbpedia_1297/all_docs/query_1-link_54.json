        "text": "In 1953, following the success of Harry Kari's \"Yes, Sir...,\" Tony Burrello and Tom Murray, bitter that their more serious music was struggling to find an audience without success, decided to launch Horrible Records to intentionally record the worst music possible.[60] The label recorded one single, \"There's a New Sound\" by Burrello, backed by \"Fish\" by former silent film actress Leona Anderson.[190]\n\nIn 1997, artists Komar and Melamid and composer Dave Soldier released \"The Most Unwanted Song,\" designed after surveying 500 people to determine the most annoying lyrical and musical elements. These elements included bagpipes, cowboy music, an opera singer rapping and a children's choir that urged listeners to go shopping at Walmart. As described by the online service UbuWeb, \"The most unwanted music is over 25 minutes long, veers wildly between loud and quiet sections, between fast and slow tempos... with each dichotomy presented in abrupt transition.\" The conceptual artists also recorded \"The Most Wanted Song\", a love song designed based on survey results to feature the most popular subject and instrumentation. Both tracks include, as an in-joke, references to philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.[191]\n\nClassical music media has run fewer \"worst-ever\" lists than have been produced for pop music, either for composers or individual pieces. There have been articles on the worst recorded versions (including those of Florence Foster Jenkins)[192] and the worst classical album covers.[193]\n\nThe worst song to appear in a film is annually awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song. This \"award\" was given from the ceremony's inception in 1980 until 1999 and resurfaced in 2002. It parodies the Academy Award for Best Original Song."
