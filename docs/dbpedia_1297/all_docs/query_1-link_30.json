        "text": "Tomoyuki Trio - SHITSURIN 失恋 (LP)\n\nLP Release Date – September 6th, 2024 – Preorder available $22 Sam Giles Vinyl Replica CDr Edition $12 Cardinal Fuzz and Feeding Tube Records are proud to present to you the 2nd LP from TOMOYUKI TRIO (Tomoyuki Aoki, Mike Vest & Dave Sneddon) following their debut LP ‘Mars’ on the esteemed Riot Season Record Label. Tomoyuki Aoki is the founding member and lead guitarist of the legendary Tokyo Psych Monsters UP-TIGHT. Of all the Japanese psych-rock groups that emerged in the late nineties and early noughties, Up-Tight are the most reverent, the most directly plugged into the source, from their name (Velvet Underground) with knowing referential song titles like “Sweet Sister” to their extended heavy, dark black clad acid fried… Read more »\n\nMargarida Garcia & Manuel Mota - Domestic Scene (LP)\n\nLP Edition of 300. bandcamp $24 Bassist Margarida Garcia and guitarist Manuel Mota are two of the best known string wielders from Lisbon’s active improvising community. Both players work the edges of sound and form in ways that don’t fit neatly into any genre category, while creating exciting sonic landscapes that appeal equally to fans of avant-garde rock, free jazz and experimental music. They have worked together frequently in a variety of formats — duo, quartet, etc. — but Margarida is the only one Feeding Tube has issued work by previously — 2022’s superb Good Night CD (FTR716). That album was a wonderfully abstract collection of bass-generated sounds hovering in the mist, illuminated from within like the rotating lights of… Read more »\n\nThe Cherry Blossoms - Stars Of Tennessee (LP)\n\nLP Edition of 500. Bandcamp. $23 Well into the third decade of their existence as a musical juggernaut, a new (or at least semi-new) quartet iteration of Nashville’s most aggressively shambolic band, The Cherry Blossoms, has recorded this dandy taster of a new LP. And Feeding Tube is tickled pink to bring it to you. Surreal ruralists of the highest order, this version of the Blossoms includes long-time collaborator, Josephine Foster, as a card-carrying member. Josephine has been colluding with the Blossoms for many years, and while most of their meets were live shows that exist only in the memories of those who have witnessed them, some documentation exists in the form of the Mystery Meet LP (FTR511). On Stars… Read more »\n\nDead Sea Apes, The Band Whose Name Is A Symbol - Eine Nacht – Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3 (3xLP Ltd Special) (3lp / CD-R / LP)\n\n3 x LPs – OUT OF STOCK. Single copies of Volumes available on our bandcamp. all presented in Reverse Board 3mm Outer Sleeves. Colour Vinyl Insert with each volume PLUS 12 page A4 Booklet Metallic Gold Riso Card Print Held by a thick wide spine belly band which is hand numbered Sam Giles Gatefold 2xCDr Edition – OUT OF STOCK On September 13th 2023 a musical collision occured between The Band Whose Name Is A Symbol and Dead Sea Apes. With a room booked and a full moon glowing, the doors were locked and for the next 120 minutes the 9 members (2xDrums, 3 Guitars (one 12 string), 2 Bass Guitars, 1 Keys/Synth and 1 Trumpet) – created nirvana/choas… Read more »\n\nBHAJAN BHOY - Peace Frequencies / Healing Frequencies (The WFMU + WGXC Sessions 2023) (LP)\n\nLP Co-Release with Cardinal Fuzz (UK) Release Date – September 6th, 2024 – Preorder Available Soon $22 Gloss Laminated Outer Sleeve with 2 sided insert. Artwork – Jake Blanchard Ever wondered what music would sound like if it was ripped from the space directly preceding sleep? The tracks within this album are your gateway to discovery. These recordings, which were laid down especially for the USA radio stations WFMU and WGXC, will melt your speakers and your mind. Released on the ever excellent Feeding Tube Records (USA) & Cardinal Fuzz (UK). BHAJAN BHOY (aka Ajay Saggar) symbolises boundless creative freedom in all the music he has produced to date. This LP is no exception to that rule….in fact, this album… Read more »\n\nDietrichs - Catch the Leaves (LP)\n\nLP Edition of 100. $25 Lovely limited vinylization of the fantastic set performed by this father/daughter duo on June 25, 2022. Beautifully recorded by Kevin Reilly, and issued on CD through his Relative Pitch label, we could not resist reissuing the set as an LP. The music was recorded at a Feeding Tube label event held at Tubby’s in Kingston, NY, deep in the midst of the Plague Era. For a bunch of us, this show was the first time we’d been out to a club in a while so there was an a extra element of liberation stirred into the semiotic mix (not that Dietrichs’s music ever lacks liberation as its prime element). The opening sets, by Magnificent Pussies… Read more »\n\nMX-80 Sound - Better Than Life (LP)\n\nLP Edition of 500. bandcamp $21 MX-80 Sound are one of the foundational underground rock bands of the last half century. Formed in the university town of Bloomington IN in 1974, the original version came about when Bruce Anderson and Dale Sophiea (from Screaming Gypsy Bandits) teamed up with Rich Stim and Dave Mahoney (from Chinaboise), adding another couple of drummers for extra confusion. Things fluxxed and mutated for a while. MX-80 played the Bloomington Public Library and rehearsed a lot. They opened for Patti Smith, one drummer left and they recorded the great Big Hits EP in ’76 for local label BRBQ. Reviewed in Sounds by Carline Coons, the EP got the band a deal by which UK Island… Read more »\n\nWednesday Knudsen - Soft Focus Volume Two (LP)\n\nLP Edition of 250. Download included inside lp. $24 It is absolutely appropriate the second volume of Wednesday Knudsen’s Soft Focus suite appears as spring finally begins to take hold. Like the brilliant first section of this work (the whole of which was initially released on CD), the music here is a celebration of shimmering sunlight and the awakening of nature’s tonal brilliance. But where the first LP focused on more bite-sized pieces of work, this one envisions and documents instrumental horizons that are ever expanding. The first of the three tracks, “Sunshine,” is the shortest, and picks up where Volume One left off — slow single note electric piano runs with lightly buzzing sustain that are darker than… Read more »\n\nElkhorn - Other Worlds (LP)\n\nLP Cardinal Fuzz / Feeding Tube Records in Collaboration with Deep Water Acres and in tribute to Sunrise Ocean bender records bring to you – Elkhorn ‘Other Worlds’. $22 Sam Giles Vinyl Replica CDr Edition – OUT OF STOCK Cardinal Fuzz / Feeding Tube Records in collaboration with Deep Water Acres and in tribute to Sunrise Ocean Bender Records bring to you: Elkhorn – ‘Other Worlds.’ Drew Gardner and Jesse Sheppard, the two-guitar duo of Elkhorn, share a musical brotherhood that spans several decades. From their nascent high school socialist-realist post-punk band Mayfirst, to teenage scavenger trips to the Princeton Record Exchange and City Gardens, the two came of age goofing along to the Dead Kennedys, the Butthole Surfers, and… Read more »\n\n- E Gone – Adventures Before The Body (LP)\n\nLP Co-Release with Cardinal Fuzz / Collaboration with Deep Water Acres and in tribute to Sunrise Ocean bender records $22 Sam Giles Vinyl Replica CDr Edition $12 E GONE is Daniel Westerlund from Stockholm, Sweden, and ‘Adventures Before the Body’ is his long-awaited latest excursion into cosmically earthy musical alchemy, rounding out a trilogy of albums begun in 2013 with ‘All the Suns of the Earth,’ and continuing with ‘Advice to Hill Walkers’ in 2016 (both also released by Deep Water Acres and Sunrise Ocean Bender). Musically, ‘Adventures…’ builds on its predecessors’ eclecticism and love of sonic juxtapositions—astute psychedelic guitar lines swirled together with exotic instrumentation and modal motifs, rock riffs alongside ethnic percussion and old-school beats, drones and atmospheric… Read more »"
