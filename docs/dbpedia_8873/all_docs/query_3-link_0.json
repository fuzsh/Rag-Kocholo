Winston Smith, a hero with no heroic qualities, longs only for truth and decency. But living in a social system in which privacy does not exist and where those with unorthodox ideas are brainwashed or put to death, he knows there is no hope for him.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nCome one, Come all into 1984!\n\nBy Kit McIlvaine (GirlPluggedN) on 02-18-08\n\nA Court of Thorns and Roses\n\nBy: Sarah J.

In her bright and energetic performance of this British classic, she expertly captures Austen’s signature wit and tone. Her attention to detail, her literary background, and her performance in the 2005 feature film version of the novel provide the perfect foundation from which to convey the story of Elizabeth Bennet, her four sisters, and the inimitable Mr. Darcy.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA perfect narration of a perfect book\n\nBy Akela on 12-09-15\n\nDracula [Audible Edition]\n\nBy: Bram Stoker\n\nNarrated by: Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, and others\n\nLength: 15 hrs and 27 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 35,175\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 31,815\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 31,725\n\nThe modern audience hasn't had a chance to truly appreciate the unknowing dread that readers would have felt when reading Bram Stoker's original 1897 manuscript. Most modern productions employ campiness or sound effects to try to bring back that gothic tension, but we've tried something different. By returning to Stoker's original storytelling structure - a series of letters and journal entries voiced by Jonathan Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and other characters - with an all-star cast of narrators, we've sought to recapture its originally intended horror and power.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nIS THAT NOT SO?\n\nBy Jim \"The Impatient\" on 11-05-15\n\nAn American Marriage (Oprah’s Book Club)\n\nA Novel\n\nBy: Tayari Jones\n\nNarrated by: Sean Crisden, Eisa Davis\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 59 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 23,692\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 21,220\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 21,178\n\nNewlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South.

Roy is arrested and sentenced to 12 years for a crime Celestial knows he didn't commit. Though fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nSo many “WTF” moments\n\nBy Kristen R King on 05-04-18\n\nThe Screwtape Letters\n\nBy: C. S. Lewis\n\nNarrated by: Ralph Cosham\n\nLength: 3 hrs and 36 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 14,215\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 11,736\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 11,715\n\nA masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to \"Our Father Below\". At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C.S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old Devil to his nephew, Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nHaunting Satire\n\nBy Matthew on 07-26-10\n\nThe Road\n\nBy: Cormac McCarthy\n\nNarrated by: Tom Stechschulte\n\nLength: 6 hrs and 39 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 22,251\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 17,298\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 17,311\n\nAmerica is a barren landscape of smoldering ashes, devoid of life except for those people still struggling to scratch out some type of existence. Amidst this destruction, a father and his young son walk, always toward the coast, but with no real understanding that circumstances will improve once they arrive. Still, they persevere, and their relationship comes to represent goodness in a world of utter devastation.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nARE YOU CARRYING THE FIRE?\n\nBy Jim \"The Impatient\" on 05-14-16\n\nHell Divers\n\nHell Divers Series, Book 1\n\nBy: Nicholas Sansbury Smith\n\nNarrated by: R.C. Bray\n\nLength: 10 hrs and 11 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 37,777\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 34,558\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 34,466\n\nMore than two centuries after World War III poisoned the planet, the final bastion of humanity lives on massive airships circling the globe in search of a habitable area to call home. Aging and outdated, most of the ships plummeted back to Earth long ago. The only thing keeping the two surviving lifeboats in the sky are Hell Divers - men and women who risk their lives by skydiving to the surface to scavenge for parts the ships desperately need.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA little cliche action hero-y but damn good story anyway\n\nBy Jillian Noone on 09-04-19\n\nThe Life We Bury\n\nBy: Allen Eskens\n\nNarrated by: Zach Villa\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 23 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 67,198\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 61,510\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 61,352\n\nCollege student Joe Talbert has the modest goal of completing a writing assignment for an English class. His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe's life is ever the same. Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran-and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nGood listen!\n\nBy Lori K. on 12-14-15"
