Finally the goal is reached, and he is a mental dyspeptic. A second class is composed of men whose disposition is to be envied. A man of this class never has the blues. He always meets you with a smile; always ready to throw down his book and laugh at the eccen¬ tricities of some crank, yet he always knows the lessons moderately well. If he happens to fail on an examination, he does not become moody, but resolves \"to do better.\" He takes life as it comes. There is another class that have not peculiarity save that they have aim in life — those who are here merely because circumstances keep them here. It might be well to add par¬ enthetically that the institution is not troubled with an individual member of this class lotig at a time. They hold ste¬ adfastly to the opinion that \"ambition is a dangerous thing,\" and constantly avoid danger. —1897 Cardinal Student Life 25 A Statistical Overview When Faces Fade to Mere Numbers On January 22, 1872, ten students, none of them high school graduates, met in a remote town in the Ozarks to form the University of Arkansas. All of the first students were from Fayetteville with its population of 995. And sure enough, in the spring of 1876, eight of the original plus one more graduated. Now, in 1976 with its record enroll¬ ment of 12,254, the UA is still in a remote town in Arkansas; however, a few state highways have wormed around the hills to make it a little more accessible. And because of the \"Razorbacks\" and its reputation for being a \"party school,\" it has made the city of Fayetteville, which has grown to a population of 31,915, a lit¬ tle more recognizable especially to fans of Southwest Conference teams. The largest number of students still come from the Fayetteville area with 3,147 from Washington County. Pula¬ ski County runs second with 1,197. Although the majority of students, 10,114, are Arkansas residents, there is at least one student from each of the 50 states in addition to 44 foreign countries. The surrounding states are well represented with 364 Texans, 299 Missourians, 222 Oklahomans, and 125 Louisianians. The largest group of foreign students is 38 from Iran. From the very first the \"University\" has been coeducational with five men and four women graduating in 1876. The ratio is still about the same with 7,447 males and 4,807 females. But as in the words of the 1898 Car¬ dinal \"it takes something more than a faculty and a few lecture rooms to make a university. The other requisite is a student body, and we have it.\" The students can now be broken down and categorized quickly by the computer but, as from the first years, it is still composed of diversified individuals. 26 Student Life Student Life 27 Orientation: More Than a Beginning For many it's their first look and feel of \"the University,\" The orienta¬ tion counselors wonder what's going on as freshmen arrive weighted down with enough luggage for months — when in reality they are just going to spend the night. Then come their initial questions; first they ask: \"Can me and Mary Jane be roommates?\" \"My mom doesn't have to stay with me, does she?\" \"What do you mean — no beer!\" \"Freshpeople,\" we get them every year. Most upperclassmen can tell them a mile off, but summer orienta¬ tion helps them \"cover up\" a little better. Student Services sponsors orienta¬ tion every June under the direction of Dr. Steve Bader — an orientation that is considered to be one of the best in the nation. One parent con¬ firmed this when she said she had been to five orientations at major universities across the country and \"there was no doubt in her mind\" that this was the best yet. Dr. Bader and a staff of eleven UA students gave approximately 1700 freshmen their first contact with the University campus this year. While working with the first year students, the counselors have to \"orientate\" their parents also, assur¬ ing them that Johnny won't go wild and Suzy will remain sweet. For some strange reason, the parents seem to enjoy orientation just as much as the freshmen, or even more. One parent said, \"I can't believe how much college has changed and how much I've learned in one day. I think every parent should be required to attend orientation.\" Almost every freshman remembers his orientation to the University, especially when one of the counse¬ lors greets him as he comes out of the elevator with two six packs of beer and makes him throw them down the trash shoot, one by one. The reactions to the summer pro¬ gram are varied. One freshman wrote on a survey, \"Thank you for being so nice. My counselor was really great and informative and kinda cute.\" But another student said, \"This program sucks.\" The counselors enjoy orientation too. Their impressions range from \"boy, that was a dumb group\" to \"I wouldn't trade this job for the world.\" And in the background Dr. Bader sits with a relieved look on his face as each session ends. 28 Student Life FAR LEFT: Cindy Highfill, the only two year counselor, explains the information packet to freshman Chris Bennett. Packet information includes everything from facts about the Uni¬ versity to a map of the Big U. UPPER LEFT: julia Winchester ponders on what she needs to take. Freshmen receive advisement on every¬ thing from academics to social life. LOWER LEFT: Meetings and more meetings, speakers and more information, freshmen Ellen English and Elenor Bullard absorb information that is aimed to help them adjust better to the Uni¬ versity. UPPER RIGHT: Baptist or Lutheran, rep¬ resentatives from Campus Crusade get fresh¬ men to fill out religious preference cards so that the various churches can contact students when they first arrive. Student Life 29 UPPER LEFT: These graduates represent the shrinking number of participants in commencement exercises at the Uni¬ versity. Out of 2535 who received degrees, only 499 went through the cer¬ emony. UPPER RIGHT: As the hot air and long speeches dulled the attention of many, even the deans appeared to be daydreaming, but one boy found some action at the stadium (LOWER LEFT). LOWER RIGHT: Ken Kidd and Marian Keough search for their names in the program, the only place where gradu¬ ates receive singular recognition. 30 Student Life Commencement: A Dying Tradition At the sound of Pomp and Circum¬ stance memories form tears in the eyes of a few hundred parents and friends who watch a small portion of the 101th class file into the bleachers of the Razorback Stadium. The view¬ ers, in their dresses and suits, sit fan¬ ning themselves with their programs. The atmosphere is filled with a mix¬ ture of dignity and'absurdity, irony and sincerity. Some emotionally take pictures of the backs of a mass of black caps and gowns so they can later say \"this is my John.\" The deans parade in colorful and distinguished hoods down the astroturf onto a portable stage decorated with fake columns. As the program starts, the nostalgia dwindles and feet begin to shuffle. To some the occasion is important — others wish they had done like the majority of their classmates and not attended. As the candidates for degrees stand for recognition by col¬ leges instead of individually, parents wince in disappointment when they can't see their son or daughter in the rows of black mortar boards. When the program is over, some feel relief from their impatience, oth¬ ers feel empty and take their program home to pack with their other mem¬ ories. Student Life 31 Concerts: It's Not All Glitter >3 t M, ' ' 1 < r ^ r -r yg* * \\. W j The concerts. A time and place to go with your friends to relax and enjoy the music and the show. You arrive and sit down. In front of you is the stage with all its glittering equip¬ ment, huge speakers, and maybe a technician or two adding a final touch to something. It is quite an impressive display. Most people don't realize the amount of time and energy put into a concert. February's Black Oak Arkan¬ sas concert, for example, took 23 hours from the time the first person arrived Saturday morning to begin setting up until the next morning when the last person left after taking everything apart. Trucks must be unloaded, pieces fitted together, frames tested, sys¬ tems checked, and endless other things must be done prior to the arrival of the band. Then, power is applied as lights are aimed and set, as amplification systems are turned on and sound levels are adjusted for voice and instrument pickups. Peo¬ ple crowd around the building as the band holds a final warm-up session before the concert. Now any bugs must be smoothed out before the show. Suddenly, it is quiet again. The doors open and people are coming in. It is time for the show to start. The stage crew is tense because things often go wrong at the last minute. This time, though, nothing does. The band begins playing and the crews relax during the show because they know there is work to be done yet. Afterwards, everything has to be taken apart and loaded back into the trucks. But who runs all this? The group responsible for most major concerts on campus is the Celebrity Showcase which is part of the AU Program Council. Celebrity Showcase is made up of about 15 student volunteers and a staff advisor. These people start the year with a $3000 budget. They select groups, set the concert dates, and organize everything. 'Everything' includes arranging for publicity (i.e. media, posters, etc.), ticket printing and coordinating ticket sales, hiring ushers, and arranging for the physical setup. The actual stage work is done by Physical Plant and by hired equip¬ ment movers. jack Bodie, Chairperson of Celeb¬ rity Showcase, explained, \"People don't really appreciate the work that they do . . . they deserve more than they get.\" 32 Student Life Student Life 33 A maze of chain fences and \"hard hat areas\" greeted UA students this fall and just like trained mice, they learned to weed past uprooted trees and torn up sidewalks to make it to their classes in ten minutes. One student was perplexed to find a parking lot in the place of the for¬ mer music annex. Later, she laughed, \"It's all coming down around us. We're all going to be parking lots!\" Such confusion was not uncom¬ mon as returning students were puzzled to find one construction after another in the place of familiar buildings. Most students expressed dislike for this \"progress.\" One stu¬ dent mumbled, \"I like the way that they just tore up that sidewalk and repaved it — it's so stupid!\" Minor Wallace, Director of Facili¬ ties Planning for the University sys¬ tem, estimates that this year a total of $15,773,154 was spent for construc¬ tion excluding athletic projects. The money includes six major projects: the Fine Arts addition, the Plant Sci¬ ences Building, the Botany Green¬ house, the beginnings of the Busi¬ ness Administration Building, and work on both University Flail and Memorial Hall. Wallace explained why so much work was being done this year. \"Our real justification,\" Wallace said, \"is we're trying to meet space needs on campus. The state board has desig¬ nated this campus fora maximum student body of 15,000. We're plan¬ ning to build to handle that many. They (the students) are just unfortu¬ nate that Arkansas is just now catch¬ ing up with needs.\" One example of this lag, he cites, is the Arkansas Union. \"The old student union was designed for 3,000 students. We sim¬ ply waited and built one for 15,000 students. So, the school had a period in which 10,000 students were trying to use a facility designed for 3,000.\" \"I know we need the buildings,\" a student commented. \"What I don't understand is why they are putting them all together. Doesn't the Uni¬ versity have any other land which they can dig up?\" \"Land,\" Wallace stated, \"is not the problem. Our biggest problem as far as academic facilities is that no facil¬ ity should be more than one-fourth mile walking distance from the cen¬ ter of campus. If the administration decided to lengthen the class break, this area could spread out. But, one- fourth mile is about the furthest one can get in 10 minutes.\" Some hope was offered to con¬ struction weary students. \"We actu¬ ally have an overlap of two biennial sessions of the legislature (1973 and 1975),\" Wallace explained. \"I think the major amount is presently being built and there'll be a lull in construc¬ tion.\" 34 Student Life Sludenl Life 35 Spoofer's Stone When Romance Was at Its Prime It isn't rare to see a couple sitting on the old Spoofer's Stone in front of Old Main shading themselves on warm afternoons. They will spend the day there, but as soon as night falls they're off to an apartment or dorm room. The uprightness, the tra¬ ditional \"honor,\" of the past, it seems, has given way to a flexibility in the present. The times alone are taken for granted. The days were when a lot less was taken for granted. The 1920's — the male to female ratio was 2-1, not unlike that of today. The student population was 80% Greek. The image of being Greek seemed so necessary that many students left school if they didn't receive a bid. Meetings between the sexes were limited. Room visitation was totally out of the question. It was a great scandal for a member of the opposite sex to be found in a person's quar¬ ters. If a couple felt the urge to be together, only the Spoofer's Stone offered them comfort. The Spoofer's Stone was held in reverence. It is a piece of Ozark limestome left from the construction of University Hall (Old Main) in the early 1870's. In the 1920's and 30's it was a rendezvous for lovers. Often times it served as a site of proposal. Perhaps this would be the scene. One moonlit evening the couple sit¬ uates themselves on the Stone; their mood is quiet and hesitant. The man starts to speak, then stops. The words he practiced all day suddenly escape him. She starts talking about the weather, he sweats, looking for his nerve. He swallows; \"Will you marry me?\" he whispers. She stops, lifts her eyes and settles them on his. \"Of course,\" she gurgles, \"isn't it assumed.\" The Spoofer's Stone was some¬ times a site of proposition. The Col¬ lege of Campustry, whose purpose was to educate the sexes on the maintenance of their social roles, was offered there. A senior highly respected for his triumphs would be named Dean. The faculty would con¬ sist of a group of likewise notable seniors. The well structured days faded away in the 1940's. America had become more mobile and Arkansas was catching up. Students' interests were spreading because the automo¬ bile was letting them do so. A drink¬ ing establishment known as the Bub¬ ble Club held a good-sized student clientele. Movies were within walk¬ ing distance at Schuler Town. And dances had grown more popular. The men would stand in the middle of the Ballroom while the dancers spun around them. If a man spied a lady he wanted to dance with he simply would tap in. The man dancing by tradition and law would have to give way. These dances could be a consid¬ erable ego booster for a woman. One was heard bragging she never danced more than ten feet with one man. With the 1950's and '60's students became more restless. What was once thought inconceivable became possible and they didn't know how to handle it. They went through a cultural shock that caused strange images to come out of their age. Peo¬ ple were eating goldfish and stuffing themselves in phone booths or Volk- swagens. And the weekly panty raid had become a tradition. On Friday or Saturday night a man would take his date to the pit for a round of parking. The pit (Razorback Stadium Parking Lot) would be filled with cars by late evening. But with the move to off-campus and the relaxation of open house rules, the pit became more of a joke, a memory, and 1976 romance has moved to the apartment and the dorm room. 36 Student Life Student Life 37 Today if a U of A student breaks open house rules, destroys property, or possesses alcohol illegally, he or she may be brought before J-Board where the infraction is usually treated mildly unless it is of a very serious nature. But nearly 100 years ago, a U of A student could be ordered to appear for severe scrutiny before the University president for such misbehaviors as smoking cigarettes, taking his date to the circus or \"neglecting studies.\" In the 1870's and '80's the University had a merit system that penalized a student for absence from his room after 7 p.m., smoking cigarettes, using \"profane or vulgar\" language and absence from daily chapel or Bible class on Sundays. Intoxication in any degree resulted in immediate expul¬ sion. There was a military dress code for the male student — a gray uniform that was in keeping with the required military drill. The administration tried to enforce a uniform female dress code, but had to abandon it as hope¬ less after one year. In the 1880's and '90's the faculty felt that unsupervised relationships or contact between male and female stu¬ dents would hamper learning and pro¬ duce unhealthy social situations. So the sexes were separated in different classrooms and were forbidden to talk together, take walks or drives together. or just visit. Occasionally the upper- class students were permitted to attend private entertainment on weekends if the chaperones were faculty-approved. Parties, circuses, theaters or any place of social amusement was defi¬ nitely off limits to students, except at the end of the term when general per¬ mission was granted. With the return to the campus of the older and more independent World War I vets in the 1920's, the administration gradually was forced to drop this particular rule. Non-vet students were quick to take advantage of this change. After a while, student discipline nat¬ urally fell into the charge of the Uni¬ versity military commandant who also served as teacher and drillmaster. The commandant had the authority to rule on the conduct of any student. Hence, discipline depended largely on the per¬ sonal philosophy of the commandant. Ideas of education and social inde¬ pendence changed with the turn of the century. Students became more asser¬ tive of their own ideas. In February 1912 the students on campus held a strike or demonstration to protest the expulsion by the faculty of 36 stu¬ dents. The expelled students had pub¬ lished grievances in a paper, \"X-Ray.\" The Board of Trustees reviewed the matter and ruled in favor of the stu¬ dent's rights. The first student council served as a pseudo-J-Board by appointing a vigi¬ lance committee which was confined to deciding and enforcing the observ¬ ance of freshman customs. As early as the fall of 1900, there was a freshman code of conduct. One of the more popular rules required each freshman to wear at all times a green cap with a yellow button from the beginning of the fall semester until Thanksgiving. He also had to tip his cap to every co-ed he passed on cam¬ pus. Starting in 1922 the girls were required to wear green arm bands or green ribbons. High school emblems or jewelry were forbidden, as were loud-colored clothing. Freshmen were prohibited from using the main entrance to Old Main and also from walking on the Senior Walk. Beginning in 1932, fresh¬ men were required to sit on the east side of the football field. They were also forbidden to have dates for the games. Freshmen were exempt from all these rules after the emancipation banquet on Thanksgiving. Class offi¬ cers were installed, a class procession was held and an address of farewell given to green caps. Our present judicial system was adopted in 1970. It created and desig¬ nated the All-University Judiciary (AUJ) as the overall agency within the University which has the responsibil- 38 Student Life pan ity for hearing cases involving breaches of conduct and law viola¬ tions. It also serves as chief appellate body of the University. Under this system the administra¬ tion is removed from a direct discipli¬ nary role, and the student is given his individual rights. He is also allowed to be heard by a board composed of four students and five members of the fac¬ ulty. basically, the University rules paral¬ lel federal, state and local laws. Cheat- ln 8/ falsifying documents for admis¬ sion, illegal possession of drugs or alcohol, gambling and destruction of University or private property are pro¬ hibited. Rules restricting social freedoms have almost entirely dwindled since 1880. Freshmen are still required to live in University housing unless they supply financial, medical or other jus¬ tifiable reasons to live elsewhere. Fire¬ arms, owned legally or otherwise, are not permitted on campus. Open house rules have changed so that practically anything goes but breaking and enter¬ ing. So next time you feel suppressed by the \"No Smoking\" signs in your class¬ rooms or the \"No Parking\" signs in your parking space, try imagining col¬ lege with \"No Parties,\" \"No Beer\" and \"No Fun.\" Agri Station Ups Food Production 40 Student Life Although 10 million people will probably die of starvation this year, mos t U of A students haven't missed a meal. Yet, those who live off cam¬ pus notice the jump in the prices of hamburger, flour and even beans. And the ones in most living groups felt disgust to find food costs had increased room and board. The U.S. News and World Report in May 1974 warned that \"accompa¬ nying charts show how the increase in global population is racing ahead of food supplies.\" And recent articles don't claim any more hope. While some students blow off the Problem, hoping science will find an answer before it's too late, others at *he University are involved in research to improve the quality and quantity of food production in Arkansas. The Arkansas Agricultural Experi¬ ment Station was established offi¬ cially in March 1888, as a result of the 1887 Hatch Act which authorized funds for the station. On the 25,000 acres of land scattered throughout Arkansas in use by the station, 245 research projects are underway. The Programs not only consider the pro¬ duction and marketing of food and fiber of high quality at the least possi¬ ble cost, but are involved in improv¬ ing the environment for people in Arkansas. An example of the effect of the University stations on food produc¬ tion is the growth of soybeans, the largest acreage crop in Arkansas. In 1939, only 44,000 acres of soybeans were planted in Arkansas to produce an average of 12.5 bushels per acre. By 1975, Arkansas was producing 25 bushels per acre from 4.5 million acres. This increase is a result largely of adapting varieties and fertilizers to fit the Arkansas soil and climate. Up until 20 years ago when the Univer¬ sity undertook this research, no vari¬ eties had been specifically adapted to this state's soil. Five have been developed since that time. Study on diseases has also improved crop quality and quantity. One variety has been produced that is resistant to the root disease Phyto- phthora. Additional research has also gone into developing wheat and soy¬ bean crops that can be double-crop¬ ped, with soybeans grown in the summer and wheat in the winter. A wheat variety, Hood 75, has been developed which matures four to five days earlier than other varieties with as much yield. This allows soybeans to be planted a little earlier in the spring. Many other projects in such areas as horticulture, entomology, plant pathology, and animal science could claim as much success in helping the state. The stations also work directly with many farmers. Last year, around 55,000 soil samples from Arkansas farmers and residents were chemi¬ cally analyzed for fertilizer sugges¬ tions through the station. Three thousand water testings were also made for wells to check for mineral quality. In addition, University teachers and researchers try to make new improvements in machinery such as the two mechanical harvesters devel¬ oped here to \"shake down\" black¬ berries and strawberries from the vines. Research is not only important to the Arkansas farmer and to the stu¬ dent who can't afford steak but also to more than a billion people to whom hunger means more than just missing a meal. Student Life 41 If You Don't Know Which End's Up . . . r 1 . 2 . 3. 4. 5. Dean Robert Hannigan Wanda Smith Dean Nancy Sindon Dr. Steve Bader Dr. Bill Denman J Whether it be hassles with a land¬ lord about leases or a teacher about grades, students at the University are constantly being faced with situa¬ tions in which they feel they need some help or advice, but many don't know where to turn. A beginning place for almost any problem is the Student Service Office in Room M405 in the Union. Student Services, sponsoring such programs as Student Health, Student Aid, and Housing, is a division of the University established for the pur¬ pose of aiding students. Although the ten who work in the Union office have official titles, their work includes listening to any problems students throw at them whether they fit in their \"job descriptions\" or not. Dr. William F. Denman, Vice Presi¬ dent of Student Affairs, has been described by one person as \"the stu¬ dents' friend,\" a man who works underneath to get things done. Between administrative duties and working with programs to benefit the students, he listens to students who 42 Student Life feel they are getting a \"raw deal\" in class. Although Nancy Sindon's official title is Dean of Women, she's usually available to help any student who needs help \"cutting through some red tape.\" Her job includes general administrative work; however, a lot of her time is spent with people who come in to talk with her about any¬ thing from roommate problems. Problem pregnancies and depres¬ sions to sorority rush. Many of the problems handled by Steve Bader, Director of Orientation, deal with students coming into col¬ lege and those going out. He heads all orientation programs as well as providing minimal contacts with People who are \"stopping out\" instead of dropping out so that they will feel free to come back when they feel they are able. He also works with campus ministries, leadership pro¬ grams for such groups as ASG and RHA and alternative educational experiences. Bob Hannigan, Dean of Student Services, works with students on complaints about any services offered by this division of the Uni¬ versity. Students with complaints about another student violating a law or University regulation on campus can come to Rich Egley, Programs Advi¬ sor, who will help initiate the process necessary for bringing it before the appropriate judicial system. On the other hand, students who have been called before a judicial board can come to him for counsel. He works with all major governing groups to help them establish judicial boards. Gary Baumann, Fraternity Advisor, works directly or indirectly with around a thousand \"frats.\" He tries to aid each of the fraternities at the point they need assistance whether it be pledge programs, rush programs, or internal operations. Cathy Hinshaw, Staff Advisor, serves not only sororities but also approximately 7,000 off-campus stu¬ dents. Working with the Great Man- dala, she listens to students' hassles with landlords or questions about legal aid to refer them to help. She advises the sororities on Greek Week, rush and pledge programs. Besides being the advisor to Delta Sigma Theta and Black Americans for Democracy, Wanda Smith, Assistant Dean for Student Services, works with black students who have finan¬ cial, academic, or social problems and helps steer them in the direction for help. The total number of University stu¬ dents receiving Veterans Administra¬ tion benefits was about 927 this year and George Curme, Veteran's Repre¬ sentative on campus, was here to help them with their benefits and to solve problems about getting their payments. Besides counseling and orienting 225 international students from around 40 countries, Carol Endriss, Assistant Dean of Students, also helps American students to be able to study, work or travel abroad. Student Life 43 After hearing the problem, the Stu¬ dent Services staff refers people to the program or agency best qualified to handle it. The Legal Clinic, located in the Law Building, gives legal advice to all stu¬ dents and University personnel free of charge. Kirby Mouser serves as Student Coordinator for the 80 law students who work there. People come in asking how to change their name, how to make a will, and the procedure for getting a divorce. Being supervised \"every step\" by a licensed attorney, the law students who work there will represent those within a certain income level in court on misdemeanor cases. Even if some¬ one doesn't qualify to be represented in court, they will still explain the nature of their legal problem and then find them a lawyer. When a local businessman threat¬ ens to raise prices unreasonably or a question arises about the validity of insurance claims, students can com¬ plain to Consumer Affairs in Union 505. A branch of Associated Student Government, this department headed by Dan Jeske, has four main services to protect the student's budget. The first one is insurance. Students concerned about the reputation of a company or the meaning of the pol¬ icy can seek information at the office. If they cannot answer the question, they will call the Director of the Arkansas Insurance Commis¬ sion. Another area the department worked on this year was off-campus housing, making a directory of apart¬ ments as well as sponsoring a referral service for home-owners who had a house to rent. One of the newest areas covered by them is the Text Book Exchange in which ASG sold students' books for them, free of profit to someone else. The Consumer Complaint Board lis¬ tens to gripes about any business or even the University. Even though the board doesn't have legal authority, they can warn the business that it could give them a bad reputation with the students. Depending mostly on volunteers, the Community Switchboard, spon¬ sored by the Great Mandala, counsels and handles all types of problems. A mother might call crying because her husband just left her with three kids. A girl needs counseling about a prob¬ lem pregancy. Someone else wants to know how to apply for food stamps. And the calls keep on coming in. Under the direction of Carol Jones, the Great Mandala, located in the Presbyterian Center, also has other programs to serve off-campus stu¬ dents. They keep an updated list of part-time job openings, rides, baby¬ sitters or freebies which they announce over KUAF Bulletin Board. They also publish an Off-Campus Student Survival Manual with sugges¬ tions on what to look for in housing, jobs and leases, on maintenance, budget planning, bargain hunting and how to live with your roommate. Through volunteer phone opera¬ tors, Yellow Brick Road, under the direction of Bill Overby, deals with crisis intervention and referral calls from people who are thinking about suicide or overdosing on drugs or who just want some information on housing. Although they wouldn't \"slam the door in the face of a man,\" the Wom¬ en's Center at 210 N. Locus was established as a place for women to relate to each other as friends. A variety of groups meet in the center to discuss different interests of women. One group, the health collective, learns self-help techni¬ ques for good feminine health. The problem-solving collective works with Gestault methods and transac¬ tional analysis to teach skills to each other on how to solve their own problems. Referral service for prob¬ lem pregnancies is also given at the center. But many women just come into the old house to relax in its qui¬ etness, listen to an album or to read a book from the library which has a wide variety of feminist literature. 44 Student Life UPPER LEFT: Many hours were spent in \"think tank\" sessions, setting goals and objectives for the Great Mandala by the nine members of its Board of Directors.

Student Life 45 With 33,788 student visits to the Student Health Center last year, the four medical doctors, one psychia¬ trist, one psychologist and one psy¬ chiatric social worker on staff treated various injuries, respiratory infec¬ tions, skin irritations, intestinal prob¬ lems, and emotional problems as well as giving check-ups. The staff can usually take care of 85-90 per cent of all the illnesses which they check. Although they cannot do major surgery, they do take care of minor surgery, tests, and X-rays along with giving shots. Besides having a 50 bed infirmary, the Health Center has an out-patient clinic, a mental health clinic, X-ray facilities, a laboratory, a pharmacy and physical therapy. There is no charge for services except for medi¬ cine and X-rays. With eight clinical faculty mem¬ bers, one experimental faculty mem¬ ber and 23 graduate clinicians, the UA Psychological Clinic under the direction of Dr. Clifford Hirsch is a full range psychological center offer¬ ing free help to students. Although the clinic usually doesn't deal with crisis intervention, they are equipped to help in crises or find someone else who can. However, most people who come in seeking help, do not come in for crisis situa¬ tions. The clinic works with around 275 people each year in individual, marital, family, or group therapy. They can also give psychological test¬ ing to determine what kind of prob¬ lem the person has, if he does have a problem, and how he can best be treated. Established in the fall of 1973, the Counseling Center under the direc¬ tion of Joe DeOrdio works to create a more favorable and satisfying Univer¬ sity environment for students through four main areas: Study Skills, Career Counseling, Testing and Per¬ sonal Counseling. In Career Development, they help match students with a career through personal counseling and brochures. In Personal Counseling, professionals and trained assistant counselors work with individuals, groups and human relations training sessions to help people learn how to get involved with others or how to deal with prob¬ lems in their lives. In charge of all admissions tests, the Testing area of the center serves as the National Testing Center for this area. Study Skills helps groups and individuals learn to study more effectively and develop good study habits. Around 4,000 students each year receive help from the University Financial Aid office in Union Room 504 which offers governmental loans, grants and work programs to aid those who need assistance. The loans provide money for students at low interest rates. Around $1.27 million dollars each year passes through the Financial Aid office in the Supplemental Educa¬ tional Opportunity Grants, National Direct Student Loans and the College Work Study jobs. In addition, there are usually at least $600,000 given in scholarships by corporations and pri¬ vate individuals. Between 700 and 800 students in the school year and around 500 in the summer participate in the College Work Study Plan. Special Services under the direc¬ tion of Harry Budd is designed to help anyone within a certain income, who is physically handicapped, or who has problems with the English language to succeed at the Univer¬ sity. Two hundred fifty students enrolled in the program this year. Besides offering free tutoring for all freshman courses, they have smaller class sections in which students get more individual attention in several freshman courses. They also help freshmen work out schedules for a curriculum in which they can suc¬ ceed. The Central Placement Office, 747 W. Dickson, usually helps about 1,000 students find permanent jobs and about 500 find part-time jobs each year. Usually, they conduct about 395 personal counseling ses¬ sions with students about job possi¬ bilities in their interest fields. Another 1,800 students drop in for information and applications for jobs as well as for help writing resumes and setting up interviews with the 250 companies that send representa¬ tives to interview students. Although the number of help cen¬ ters on campus sometimes causes confusion of who to go to for assist¬ ance, most of them work with each other to direct students to the pro¬ gram that can best meet their needs. 46 Student Life UPPER LEFT: David Cooksey, Director of the Financial Aid Office, sees many students each day to explain the factors that determine how much aid the office tan give them.

Student Life 47 Faculty Senate Council — 1874 It Was Just One of Those Years November 14,1874 The Senate met to consider the case of a student who overturned an outhouse on the E remises of the University and removed a campus foot bridge. After discussing the student's iwlessness, a motion was made to expel him from school. November 20,1874 Young gentlemen of the campus literary societies presented a petition to the Senate \"pray¬ ing permission\" to escort young ladies of these societies to and from the meetings on Satur¬ day evenings. On motion of Miss Gorton, professor of mathematics and English Literature, the Faculty Senate rejected the proposal, terming it inexpedient. The Senate then discussed the Friday evening incident of a student who became intoxi¬ cated from alcohol given him by a Fayetteville physician. While intoxicated, he threw stones at a retired Confederate Captain's residence. The student seems to be very sorry for his offense, promises to do better in the future, and hopes that the University will take into account that this is his first offense. The Senate consented. December 7,1874 Three students were caught stealing apples from the University tool shed. For this offense to State Property, they were each assigned three demerits. December 14,1874 A major argument occurred during the Senate meeting as how to grade examinations ade¬ quately and assign a score. Professor Leverett charged that Professor Thompson was making a mountain out of a molehill. December 15,1874 A Cadet cursed his instructor while on the drill grounds Monday afternoon. This very seri¬ ous incident will be fully investigated by the entire Senate. December 17,1874 A student was called before the Senate to answer for his tardiness at noon. He stated that he had broken the basket in which he carried his dinner, and he was therefore obliged to go home for his dinner. He was unable to return on time to the campus for noon Roll Call. He was told by the Senate that he should have brought his meal in a tin pail, and was then assigned one demerit. Student Life January 15,1875 A student on the morning of the fourteenth had attended Roll Call, recitation, and Com¬ mercial Arithmetic. However, he was missing for his Geometry recitation. President Gates directed the Geometry professor to find the reason. The student was discovered sitting in his dormitory room visiting with a friend. He claimed that his head was aching very badly. He ^vas considered a \"suspicious circumstance\" and assigned one demerit. January 27,1875 One Cadet deserted his company on a recent morning commenting that \"he thought he would have to drill with an 'awkward squad'.\" He was first assigned twelve demerits, then later Awntowl from the University. Under great apologies from the student, he was later ^admitted to school. February 5,1875 The Faculty Senate was told that Professor Thompson had died of pneumonia on the eve¬ ning of the third. \"There is a vacant chair in the faculty, and our meeting today is robbed of one upon whom Divinity had set the seal of superior manhood.\" It was resolved by the Sen¬ ate that the faculty enter into official mourning, and that these proceedings be duly reported to all Fayetteville and Little Rode newspapers, as well as die president of his Alma Mater, the State University of Iowa. March 25,1875 Lieutenant Curtis spoke of a growing evil: die practice of Cadets excusing themselves from drill on the grounds of illness. The frequency of these cases is remarkable. April 8,1875 W. W. Wilshire was called before the Faculty Senate once again to state his reasons for being on the streets rather than in class. He claimed that he had had business with a young lady. He was assigned three demerits. April 14,1875 Misses Vance, Deane, Chrisman, Pettigrew, and Jones were called before the Senate to sharp account for their repeated absences from classes. They insisted that they had been in church. Each lady was assigned one demerit. W. W. Wilshire was called before the Senate again to answer for disturbing the school by whistling. He disclaimed any intention to disturb the University. He said that he had whis¬ tled thoughtlessly. The case was dismissed. June 5,1875 The President reported that several students had left the campus without permission to attend a strawberry festival. On motion of the Faculty Senate, they were expelled from the University and their schooling here terminated. President Gates made a recommendation that next year's commencement exercises be changed. This will be the very first graduating class from the University. The date has been changed from June 18 to June 17,1876. The Senate approved the President's proposal. Freshman Women's Rush or More Confusion? More Pledges Sorority Rush. The Panhellenic rush book heralds it as \"a natural process of interaction.\" But, for many partici¬ pants, rush was anything but natural. \"It was a Hell Week,\" one fresh¬ man pledge declared. The week began in August with 390 rushees eager to explore sorority life. It ended with 243 pledges, in varying states of happiness and confusion, stepping into sorority life. Of the number of women going through rush, 315 were freshmen who never before had to cope with registration, finding classes, dropping courses, and being rushed. Women who had pre-registered had the advantage since rush came in the middle of the final registration period. Rush counselors tried to bol¬ ster the sagging spirits of rushees who were worn out by a day in the arena of registration. \"It was understood by my family that I would go through rush, but when I found out it was so early, I didn't want to do it,\" one woman who dropped out during rush said. The U of A has gradually moved to first-semester freshman rush. For two years, freshman women were rushed in the spring. This year houses seemed panicked to learn all they could about rushees whom they had never seen before, so they could make them feel welcome. Sorority women were to have no contact with rushees during the sum¬ mer, so most rushees didn't know what to expect. \"I thought all the houses would be alike and the decision to pledge would be easy,\" one ex-rushee stated. For many rushees the week of smiles, skits, songs, smiles, watery lemonade, tear-jerking preference parties and more smiles was confus¬ ing. Boyfriends and brothers tried to help out by offering even more con¬ fusing \"inside information\" on the houses, their quotas and liking for the rushees. \"During rush, I felt as if I were an object where people were rotating around me. The houses didn't seem like places to live,\" one rushee who dropped out of formal rush to go through open rush, said. But for sorority women, the increased number or rushees was inspiring. Last year, only 172 women pledged during rush. Another advantage seen by soror¬ ity women is the open-mindedness of freshmen. \"They haven't had the chance to be subjected to pressures of strong independent groups, who have a greater rush than sororities,\" one rush counselor said. Resident assistants found advising and comforting rushees difficult since they had just met them. \"I think freshman rush stinks,\" one frustrated Fulbright Hall RA declared. \"We will always keep freshman rush,\" Cathy Hinshaw, Panhellenic advisor, said. The timing of rush is flexible, but probably it will be in the summer again next year. She hopes rush will become more natural and meaningful with fewer formal skits and activities. \"The skits are impressive, but I wish I could have gotten to know the people better,\" one pledge remin¬ isced. While freshman rush may not always be the best for rushees, it seems to be the stimulant needed to add life to the Greek system. 50 Student Life FAR LEFT: Candlelight and greenery set the mood for the Delta Gamma preference parties which give rushees a more solemn view of sorority life.

Student Life 51 Shuttle Buses Relieve Weary Feet Large, white University school buses became familiar sights to most students as the year began. The buses were the vital element in the first mass transit system on the U of A campus. With the student enrollment reaching an all-time high of 12,254 and the available number of parking spaces declining, the University took measures to help ease the parking problem. The parking situation reached an almost crisis stage when construction was begun on the new Business Administration Building located in the Brough area. Several administrators including Fred Vorsanger, vice president for Fiscal Affairs; Joe Talley, Physical Plant director, and Jim Gibson, hous¬ ing director, worked to develop an effective means of transportation on campus. As the year started, two buses were making six-minute runs from the parking areas around the stadium and Barnhill Fieldhouse with sched¬ uled stops' at the corner of Garland and Dixon streets and at the Union underpass. The green and white stop signs soon appeared to alert all stu¬ dents to the new service. Rush periods on the system occur¬ red about 8:30 a.m., noon and 5 p.m. The system, which carried 1,500 to 1,800 students per day, made the buses feasible. In mid-December two additional buses were added to the transit system. Started as a three- month pilot program, it was soon expanded into a long-term project. As the campus transit system expanded, students and administra¬ tors were working to implement changes. The bus schedules became more flexible and there was an effort made to achieve more effective use of the manpower involved. The U of A was not the only area school to implement such a program. The University of Oklahoma, Univer¬ sity of Texas, Baylor, Texas Tech, SMU, and Texas A&M were among some of the schools attempting to deal with the parking problem through a mass transit system. Other alternatives to the shuttle bus system were frequently dis¬ cussed. Although the system was working well, it cost the University almost $3,000 per month to keep in operation. Some students hoped to see improved bikeways on the cam¬ pus to make bicycling a more appeal¬ ing alternative. Others dreamed of high-rise parking facilities or guaran¬ teed paid parking spaces. Upper¬ classmen suggested the possibility of not allowing freshmen to bring cars on campus — an idea not favorably accepted by freshmen. While some students and adminis¬ trators were dreaming, residents of the William Flouse began a co-op program to assist owners of sub-com¬ pact cars. The students would move two small cars to make r£om for a third small vehicle. They simply lifted the first two cars, all within Univer¬ sity parking regulations, and fit the third car in the middle. The availability of parking spaces close to the campus is not expected to improve, but the school seems to have found the beginnings of a solu¬ tion with the birth of the shuttle sys¬ tem. 52 Student Life FAR LEFT: It often seems that the more hurried that you are to find a parking space, the less likely you are to fincJ one. For off-campus stu¬ dents, the parking lots are the most crowded before 8:30 and 9:30 classes TOP: While many students have found that riding the University buses best suits their needs, some students prefer to bicycle to and from classes (BOT¬ TOM). This has led to a cry for more strate¬ gically placed bike-racks and improved bike¬ ways. MIDDLE: Hoping to \"outsmart\" the Department of Public Safety ticket-writers, many students adopt a stop-and-run philoso¬ phy while running errands. Parking in the wrong zone often results in a ticket which must be paid before registration can be com¬ pleted for the next semester. Student Life Religion Away From Parental Pressures Whatever religion is on the U of A campus, it isn't having your parents drag you out of bed on Sunday morn- in 8 to tell you that \"you have to go to church.\" Sure, plenty of students do get out of bed on Sunday to attend church. Why? Perhaps some of them feel guilty\" if they don't. Or maybe they do so just to be able to truthfully tell Mom and Dad that they went. Some students often attend to get the week off to a good start. And, many go to worship services to strengthen a growing relationship with God. Religion isn't just attending Sunday morning worship services either. Churches and student religious cen¬ ters on or near the campus offer a variety of activities throughout the Year. Some of these activities include weekly Bible studies, banquets, weekend retreats and seminars with speakers. Students attending these events \"have fun and also learn a great deal about themselves, others a nd God at the same time.\" These kinds of activities and more take place under the auspices of the Methodist, Catholic, Lutheran, Bap- t 1 s t, Presbyterian and Episcopalian denominations. Inter-denomina¬ tional groups also have a large num¬ ber of participants. Campus Crusade for Christ sponsors a weekly program for students every Tuesday in some living group on campus and the Navi¬ gators has numerous Bible studies. The Hillel Club, a center for Jewish students, and the Unitarian Fellow¬ ship House, both located just off campus, are also active student cen¬ ters. A Christian newspaper, AGAPE , is published twice a month by Christian students who volunteer their time and talent. While many University students go \"all-out\" to participate in these events, there are still others who prefer not to. One reason is that there is \"just not enough time to keep up with all that and schoolwork too.\" Another reason why a student may appear \"inactive\" is because he finds little significance in being a vivacious participant. His spiritual life is a \"close and personal relation¬ ship\" between God and himself. Others claim to be non-believers or atheists. There are, also those apath¬ etic or border-line folks who neither reject nor fully believe in God's exist¬ ence and power. They are too wrap¬ ped up in their books, job, sweet¬ heart or some other idea to give either side any consideration. In contrast, a robed sect visited the University campus early in the school year. They managed to turn a few heads (and make one known conver¬ sion) as they wore long robes in 90 degree weather because fitted clothes revealed the \"sinful shape of the human body.\" One day in October a small group assembled just outside Brough Com¬ mons and told the Gospel through a megaphone to students as they bus¬ tled to and from classes at the Com¬ munications building. Some students may have been converted by that message, but some expressed the fact that it simply \"turned them off\" and so they tuned the message out. From one extreme to the other, it is still very evident that God is just as alive and well to many U of A stu¬ dents as books, booze, parties and drugs are to others on this campus. The visible proof lies in the large numbers who do attend worship ser¬ vices or student center activities. The not-so-evident proof involves those who have personal talks with God and don't have to dust off their Bibles each week. To the college student who needs no longer rely on his parents' beliefs but must cultivate his own, religion probably holds a deeper meaning. Student Life 55 If It Rains, We'll Still Have Practice The showcase of the athletic department this year was the new North End Zone Athletic Facility, located, as the name obviously implies, in the north end zone of Razorback Stadium. The facility went into full use in the fall of 1975 after two years of con¬ struction. No state funds were allo¬ cated for the $2.6 million building. The main feature of the complex is the indoor practice area, which is located on the lowest of the build¬ ing's three levels. The 150-by-120- foot area is heated and reportedly gives Arkansas the first \"convertible\" practice facility in the nation. The facility also gives the U of A a second \"record\" with the longest continuous stretch of artificial turf in the world — 186 yards extending from the south end zone of the sta¬ dium to the back wall of the practice area. The practice area is approxi¬ mately half the size of a football field and enables the football team to practice all phases of offense and defense except for the kicking game. The baseball team can also hold infield and batting practice in the case of inclement weather. There are also three indoor tennis courts and a special pole vault pit. Also, on the bottom level are com¬ bined locker room and halftime areas which provide graduated seating areas for pre-game and halftime talks for both teams. These areas are reportedly innovations of Arkansas' Frank Broyles, athletic director and head football coach. The rest of the facility provides offices for the football, baseball and track coaching staffs, ticket manager, sports information director, assistant athletic director, business manager, and Razorback Club officials, plus conference and film rooms and a Hall of Fame room. The Library Study Hall and Refuge Some students at the University visit the library once in their four years — to tell Mom and Dad what it looks like. But others use it regularly. Students come to read the newspa¬ pers, to do research, to study, or just to rest during initiation. During finals, the number of students in the library doubles and the hours are increased to 1 p.m. Two new signs greeted students this year. One invited students on a self-guided tour through the library, using the theme \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road.\" Another sign read, \"All purses, briefcases, etc. will be inspected upon leaving the building.\" Due to numerous thefts, this policy was started at the first of the year. The David W. Mullins Library houses four levels of open stacks, which contain over 750,000 volumes classified according to the Library of Congress (L.C.) System. About 6,000 magazines or journals and about 75 different newspapers are also acces¬ sible to students. In addition, it has an audio-visual section, a collection of unpublished manuscripts, rare books, special folklore, a collection of Arkansas materials, and telephone directories. To meet special needs, it includes seminar rooms, smoking areas, and study carrels for graduate students. The Reserve Room contains material to be read by an entire class along with U.S. and foreign college and university catalogs, a course exam file, and many current magazines. The Reference Department tries to answer students' questions and help them locate information. In addition to the main library, branch libraries are located in Fine Arts, Chemistry, Physics and Peabody Hall. 58 Student Life FOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK THROUGH Student Life 59 'Free Dip' Increases Night Crowd Because of larger appropriations, the swimming pool was open to all students and faculty free of charge this year for the first time. The suggestion for this new policy came from the Student Senate last year when they passed a resolution recommending that the University's swimming facilities be made availa¬ ble free of charge to all studenjts and faculty. Up until this year students were charged $5.00 a year for a swimming pool pass. But larger appropriations from the administration made this no-charge policy possible. Along with the \"free pass,\" the hours were increased this year to 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. Last year the pool did not open until 7 p.m. on week¬ days. Due to both of these new privi¬ leges, the number of people swim¬ ming each night increased from last year's 75 \"on a good night\" to over 100 a night this year. 60 Student Life Student Life 61 Drop-Add Registration After Preregistration 62 Student Life Although preregistration saves the confusion of the arena in the men's gym, it's not as simple as it sounds. After the computer indifferently rear¬ ranges a student's schedule, he usu¬ ally begins the drop-add process to salvage his day. Other students decide they don't like the courses they had selected for themselves so they, too, seek signatures and class cards causing a flood of drop-add requests during the first week of classes. Lisa Craig was one of the students joining the long lines to straighten things out. Beginning in the Commu¬ nications Building, she obtained a drop-add slip from her adviser. Then she headed to the Men's Gym to drop square dance while her friend jan Diffin followed behind to add it. After crossing campus again to the Geology Building, she dropped Earth Science and tried, without success, to get into Geology. To fill the void in her schedule, she decided to add Anthropology which meant a cold jog to Hotz Hall to get a class card. Finally, she made her last stop at Vol Walker to turn in her slip to the Dean. By the end of the first week, the lines had thinned out and the \"regis¬ tration after preregistration\" had slowed down for the semester. Student Life 63 After Arming Battle, Little Changes A ticket on the windshield tells a student that the public safety officer has been around again. Although they resent receiving the ticket, most of the time students do not feel threatened by the campus cops but either react neutrally to them or see them as friends. Because of this image, there was much controversy when the arming of officers was being discussed in spring 1975. Some students fought the proposal claiming that it was being instituted too fast and was not evolutionary enough. Fearing that guns would cre¬ ate divisiveness, a professor claimed that the fact that our officers weren't armed showed that our people were more community-minded. Some pro¬ posed better lighting and an escort service for women as an alternative. One student felt that they could deal with a criminal emotionally as well as using self-defense skills. He sug¬ gested dressing the officers in hippy garb and replacing the badge with a lollipop to change DPS to the \"Department of Positive Reinforce¬ ment.\" Other students supported the issue, hoping that by arming campus officers Fayetteville Police Officers would not patrol campus. They pointed out that campus officers would be more sensitive to students and would also have to have more training than what is required for police. Some felt the officers had a right to defend themselves. One stu¬ dent stated, \"I know, if I were steal¬ ing something it would take a lot more than a flashlight to make me stop and come back.\" In the middle of the controversy, the Student Senate passed a resolu¬ tion in April supporting arming, and in May, the Board of Trustees voted to arm the officers. In July four members, the director, associate director, investigator, and uniform commander, were licensed to carry firearms. Other officers could be \"phased in\" after comple¬ tion of an intensive period of train¬ ing. To be licensed to be armed, each officer had to complete four weeks or 192 hours of police training at the state police academy at Camden. In addition, he or she needed 160 hours of in-service training in the depart¬ ment, including the basic law- enforcement concepts of traffic investigation and criminal investiga¬ tion. This was not the first time the cam¬ pus security force had been armed. The campus had armed guards up until the mid-sixties when President David Mullins decided to change the policy. The move for rearming came in June of 1972 with the hiring of Larry Slamons as director. \"We had been given the responsibility for policing the campus,\" explained Paul Rice, information officer. \"We were policemen, yet we were not capable of reacting as policemen in all situa¬ tions. When one of our officers was in danger, we had to rely on the Fay¬ etteville police. We had several inci¬ dents prior to the arming, where offi¬ cers had to deal with a member of the public who was armed. If we have responsibility, we should have the authority.\" \"We had a choice,\" Rice contin¬ ued, \"either become security guards, 'door-shakers', or become full police. It was the decision of the director to pursue the option of becoming full police.\" Slamons explained, \"The weapons give them (the officers) the opportu¬ nity to defend themselves and the community. The word 'defend' is the most important. What's the purpose of it. One cannot expect an officer to enter into dangerous or potentially dangerous situations without having safeguards.\" Although there were no opposition rallies when students returned in the fall of 1975, many still reacted nega¬ tively toward the gradual arming of Public Safety Officers. \"I don't know exactly why, but I don't feel comfortable with the idea.\" \"I'm opposed. Arming has taken Public Safety beyond what it was ever meant to be.\" Others saw positive factors in arm¬ ing them. \"We need some sort of police protection on this campus. I'd prefer it came from someone who worked with students every day rather than just a city policeman.\" Even though many students dis¬ liked the idea of armed officers, the image of the 'campus cop' this year remained the same and the officers most threatening weapon to students was still the ticket on the windshield. 64 Student Life Student Life 65 66 Student Life Student Life 67 Creek System Still a Part of UA Life The first Greek fraternity chartered at the University was Alpha Tau Omega in 1882. Although the chapter folded after only one year of exist¬ ence, fraternities and sororities have become a traditional part of campus life since that time. Chartered in 1890, Kappa Sigma, which has survived for 86 years, is usually considered the first Greek organization at the U of A. Some of its members were instru¬ mental in helping a group of girls start the mother chapter of Chi Omega five years later. This fraternity and sorority set a precedent for the 15 fraternities and 10 sororities active on campus today. In the past five years, three frater¬ nities and two sororities have come to the U of A campus. Delta Upsilon fraternity was the only new organiza¬ tion whose members lived in a house. Two black fraternities. Alpha Phi Alpha and Omega Psi Phi, and a black sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, also began colonization. Another sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, had an active interest group on campus this year. In February of 1974, upon the advice of the Committee on Student Relations and the Senate Council Agenda Committee, President David W. Mullins changed the procedure for establishing sororities and frater¬ nities. Although the change made chartering more difficult for those fraternities and sororities wishing to build new houses, it did streamline the chartering process. Now the Uni¬ versity will not enter into contract or acquire property for any new frater¬ nity or sorority. This reflects the changing nature of the current requests and needs of the campus, because most fraternities don't want houses, just lodges. To request a charter, the Interfra¬ ternity Council or Panhellenic con¬ tacts the national fraternity for colon¬ ization at the U of A. The national fraternity then makes its request to the Division of Student Affairs. This request includes a letter of approval and support from the national frater¬ nity, the number of active members and alums in the state and in the area, a copy of the national constitu¬ tion and by-laws, and a current finan¬ cial statement. The Interfraternity Council or Pan¬ hellenic and Associated Student Government consider their request and send their recommendation to the Division of Student Affairs. If they approve it, the recommenda¬ tions are forwarded to the Commit¬ tee on Student Relations for final action. Although in recent years there has been some anti-Greek feeling at the U of A as well as on the national level, the spread of Greeks on this campus seems to have stabilized, according to Nancy Sindon, Dean of Women. She explained that campus fraternities were having some finan¬ cial problems, but that the sororities' financial situation was good. Although the Greek system may have to respond to changing lifes¬ tyles, the tradition of fraternities and sororities still flourishes at the Uni¬ versity. 68 Student Life LEFT: Carrying out one of their national tradi¬ tions, Delta Upsilon Fraternity raised their flag in front of Old Main on their chartering date, November 15, 1975.

UA Buildings 'It All Started With a Farmhouse . . 70 Student Life The one-fourth square mile of campus seems like a large spread when a student must rush from one side of campus to the other in ten minutes between classes. But the growth of the campus, which now contains over 120 buildings, has taken a century of work, and the old buildings are reminders of this grad¬ ual enlargement. Mcllroy Farmhouse and a small frame building were the original campus buildings at the U of A. Old Main, which has become the most familiar landmark of the campus, was finished in 1875 as the first campus construction. Although University Hall was its original title, tradition has marked it as Old Main. Scarred wooden floors, high ceilings, knock¬ ing radiator pipes and two towers of unequal height are distinctive fea¬ tures of Old Main. The North Tower houses a recording of the original chimes which can be heard through¬ out the campus. This building has five floors of offices, laboratories and classrooms as well as the University Museum. Hill Hall was originally built in 1901 as a men's dormitory and later became headquarters for the athletic department and an athletic dormi¬ tory. It was named for D. H. Hill, a general of the Confederate Army and early president of the U of A. In 1949, the Department of Journalism moved into Hill Hall from the basement of Old Main. Student publications offices were also housed there until a fire in 1969 put them out of business for a semester. The second oldest building left standing on this cam¬ pus, Hill Hall, still houses the student publications. In 1903, the Commerce Building was constructed as the original Col¬ lege of Engineering. The Business Administration Building, as it is now known, was added to it in 1936. Vol Walker, the first library build¬ ing on campus, was built in 1935 in honor of a prominent local citizen, who led a successful fight in the 1920's to prevent the U of A from moving to Little Rock. After Vol Walker's construction, the University president's office was moved there. The new Administration Building became the location for his office later, and the space in Vol Walker was taken by the Dean of Arts and Sciences. With the construction of the David Mullins Library, the School of Architecture became housed in Vol Walker also. Futrall Memorial Hall, known to most students as the Old Student Union, was constructed in 1939 in memory of John C. Futrall, who was once president of the University. Although the words \"Sti ident Union\" are inscribed over the front door of the building, its official name was Futrall Memorial Hall. When the new Student Union was built, the name was shortened to Memorial Hall to avoid confusion with the women's residence hall named after his wife. Not all the buildings on the U of A campus have histories as colorful as some of these and not all of them have proven to be such versatile facilities. The Chemistry Building, built in 1934, has always been used for its original purpose. The Agricul¬ ture and Home Economics Buildings, constructed in 1927 and 1939 respec¬ tively, have also served their original purposes. Today, it is only too obvious that construction is taking place on the U of A campus for expansion purposes. Tall windowless buildings tower over older traditional structures. In the last five years, five buildings have been erected and four have been reno¬ vated or adapted for a new use. Although the newer high rises on campus claim more comfort with their air-conditioned rooms, the older buildings and their well-worn steps and large windows are the vital \"senior citizens\" of the University. Student Life 71 Asset Education Isn't for Young Alone \"Older than average\" students often feel misplaced at the University among the \"fresh-out-of-high- school\" college kids who make up the majority on campus. So a few of these older bracket students began meeting through the Counseling Center in the summer of 1975 to dis¬ cuss their problems and resources. In the fall, the people attending the meetings decided to branch off from the Counseling Center and select officers. In September 1975, Asset was formed. The group had about 35 active members meeting every Thursday and Friday from 11:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. in the Arkansas Union Room 514. Cara Triplett, a sophomore cloth¬ ing design major who served as the group's president, said one of Asset's major purposes was to keep the 1500 students over 29 years old informed of all items of general interest in finance, housing and medicine. She stated that Asset could familiarize the students with some special U of A services they did not know were available. \"Asset has given me a sense of belonging to the U of A,\" said Lonita Graham, a senior home economics major. Besides being a student, she is also a wife and mother of two chil¬ dren. During the 1976 Spring semester registration, Asset had a table set up to provide aid and information for all students. The Asset members also prepared a print-out to be sent to all \"older than average\" students, providing inform¬ ation about Asset and the University. The Asset meetings were informal with students meeting to eat lunch, discuss their problems and exchange ideas and maybe even recipes. Lou Tomlinson, a freshman busi¬ ness major and a wife and mother of three children, said Asset gave her a sense of belonging and made it easier to meet with people which had simi¬ lar interests. Anna Smith, a doctoral student in higher education and secretary of the group, found that Asset kept her in touch with other students her age and provided a social life with some of the members. Extra-curricular activities included special pot luck dinners and chili suppers. The Asset members some¬ times got group tickets to University activities. The group also had a room in the Arkansas Union for studying. Some of the Asset members explained that they had some problems with school because of their family responsibili¬ ties. They often found it very difficult to get back in the rut of studying and concentrating after being out of school for several years. George Moore, a retired military officer and a former editor of the Rogers Daily News, was a U of A freshman taking subjects for enjoy¬ ment. Moore, who served as Asset treasurer, explained that it was diffi¬ cult to get back into effective study habits and to retain things. Although the older student often faced extra challenges because of his \"age,\" one Asset member summed it up in saying that he was more \"amused\" than bothered by the age differences in students. 72 Student Life Student Life 73 74 Student Life Our campus is slowly but surely being infiltrated and overtaken. Not by Communism — although that may be true, too — but by abbreviations. Remember that phobia people were getting a few years ago about being classified as a number instead of by name? That was just a clever diversion. As soon as everybody turned against the number system, abbreviations moved in. Now everywhere you turn, you find an abbreviation. They have so taken over our school that it is an unwritten, but still always obeyed, law that no new building can be built or new organization can be formed without an abbreviation. Take for example the 29 different meanings for the letter \"A,\" led by the obvious \"Arkansas\" in the U of A. The other meanings are included in Black Americans for Democracy (BAD), Associated Student Govern¬ ment (ASG), Athletic Building (AB), Residence Hall Association (RHA), Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA), Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), Fine Arts Building (FA Building), Future Farmers of America (FFA), Law Students Admis¬ sion Test (LSAT), Fellowship of Chris¬ tian Athletes (FCA), Associate Degree In Nursing (ADN), Animal Science Building (AS Building), Veterans Administration (VA), Agriculture Engineering Building (AE Building), West Avenue Annex (WAA), Senate Services Allocations Committee (SSAC), All-Student Judiciary Board (ASJ) and Agri-Home Economics Stu¬ dents Association (AHESA). Special mention go to the abbrevi¬ ations \"BA\" and \"RA,\" both of which have two completely different mean¬ ings. \"BA\" can represent Razorback Annex or Resident Assistant. If you're involved in intramural sports, you know there are AA and AAA divisions for the fraternity leagues. Plus, there's the \"A\" Book, the Bible of the U of A student body. And, of course, don't forget that good ole \"A\" all students strive for in their classes, some of which come during period A. And if they happen to get sick before attending that course that they're getting an A in during period A, their teacher marks an \"A\" in his book for \"Absent.\" And there's still room for more at U of A. For example, the Allied Aard- vark Admirers (AAA) or the Amazons for Abolishment of Amino Acids (AAAA) could move on campus to bombard us with still more \"A's\" to worry about. Take into consideration how small a part this place of the whole nation and you can see how strong a hold Abbreviations and their fiendish plot have on us. It's now to the point where class schedules, maps, directo¬ ries, and catalogs all have to include a legend where their abbreviations are explained. Just remember, back in the 2nd sem. of 75-76, whether you're a fr., soph., jr., or sr., R.W.J. didn't mind being called a number. Student Life 75 Senior Walk: A Link With Our Past To the freshman, Senior Walk is a white strip in the distance, to the sophomore, a novelty, to the junior a goal, and to the senior the highway to success. But to University officials, it is a problem in planning and a tra¬ dition entrenched. The Walk now has spread over more than a mile of the campus, containing names of 98 years of graduates (no students fin¬ ished in 1887 or 1895). Although the idea was conceived by the Gass of 1902, the 1905 slab was the first one laid. Slabs from 1876 to 1904 were not laid until 1930. A superstition about the 1900 block is still passed on each year. Some stu¬ dents believe it is bad luck to step on it, thinking every member of that group died a violent death. But according to the obituaries, all the members died of natural causes. In earliest years, male seniors of the College of Engineering mixed and laid the concrete. One right-handed senior and another, left-handed, would write opposite each other while the cement was still wet. The slab's two columns could be finished in an hour or two. \"Pennant Day\" usually followed; a celebration of commencement and the end of another year. Originally the Walk was only for seniors who would pay for their names to be inscribed. Now it is for every student who receives a dip¬ loma. Each year the cost becomes higher. What once could be done for less than $10 when students mixed the concrete themselves now comes to some $13,000 annually. Cost varies with the amount of soil grading, inflation, labor, and the number of names. The eight-inch thick Walk has been surrounded by controversy in recent years. Critics charge that we are fencing ourselves in with the Walk, for any time it has to be replaced after new construction. The expense is staggering. Perhaps the 100th graduating class could be a compromise solution for termination of the Walk. Until that unpopular decision has to be made, Arkansas remains the nation's only university that has ever honored its graduates in such a unique and special fashion. 76 Student Life Student Life 77 To Handicapped Students School Is Often an Up-Hill Problem The handicapped student often finds the numerous steps and hilly grounds on campus a challenge. To help out students with physical mobility problems, twenty parking spaces were assigned at strategic locations on campus. The Students with Special Prob¬ lems group made significant advances in bringing their problems to the attention of the University. Special assistance made it possible for these students to register for classes without having to go to all stations. These students also received an allocation from Associated Student Government in order to continue work on solving some of the prob¬ lems that they faced. One of their priorities was to eliminate physical barriers present on the University campus. Although some of the resi¬ dence halls are now completely up to standard in accommodating handi¬ capped students, there are still build¬ ings on campus without suitable ramping or handrails. 78 Student Life Student Life 79 Wednesday afternoon. Dear Mom and Dad, Well, I’ve been In the fraternity house almost two months now and so far it’s been about what you said to expect. When you were in college. Dad, did they have rush? If they did, I’m sure it wasn’t anything like the closed rush I went through. When we arrived at Pomfret, that is for those who could find Pomfret in the first place, they doubled us up on rooms and gave us a small lecture on what to expect for the next three days. However, no amount of lecturing could have possibly replaced the experience of deciding in only three get-this-group-out-and-get-group-four-in-next days where he wished to spend his time, money and trust for the next four or five years. The first day we were met bright and early (actually I think it was 10 o’clock) by what appeared to be the ’’most luxiourious, most expensive, newest, and most ’sought-after’” cars each Greek living group could rustle up. One frat in particular lined up four Mark IV’s, all being the same Continental Silver, and every Grand Prix, silver also, their members could find. Each group of potential pledges was whisked away in a cloud of dust and unleaded gas fumes, run through this house and that in the time allotted, and returned to the doors of Pomfret only to be met by yet another ’’fldefc” of the ”lilxui*±ou&; expensive * new, and ’sought-after* cars.” So ended the first day. I couldn’t remember any of the Greek letters and recalled only a couple of the houses—to which I returned the very next day. The following day, after arriving at each respective house, I discovered one-by-one, that the first day had simply been a front to get you back a second day to convince you, if by the third day they thought you were convincible, that theirs was the house in which to live. Also, by the third and final day, I realized that, like buying a car, I’d probably just better pick the house with the least percentage of ’’auto salesmen.” I had a hard time choosing, but when I also took into consideration that some of the houses appeared in better condition than others, and that the one with the cleanest interior was probably the least rowdy bunch, there appeared to me, as to all the other new pledges on campus I suppose, one and, I believe, only one house in which tollive. And as you all found out, we didn’t have to be rich for me to go Greek. (No house was over 50 dollars more for me to live In than the cheapest dorm room and the pledge and initiation fees weren’t ridiculous either!) Oh, by the way. Mom, I never did check to see if this is one of the houses on campus that doesn’t assess! I Just found out today that we are supposed to be a ’’Secret Organization,” but I can’t figure out what in the world the members could possibly be keeping secret. We don’t get hazed that much here and I’ve only done the dishes three times this month, Dad. I even hear there is one fraternity that is completely non-hazing. Sometimes I wish I were in that one, but then I remember that they went through all this *+”:*ing stuff they’re giving us now, and besides, it’ll be over by Christmas. They really seemed to have been honest when they told me, ”We’d like to have you as a pledged member of our fraternity, Freddie.’ ” You know, you were right when you said there’d be. a lot of drugs and pot and beer up here and each night there’s one or two of the guys coming home drunk or stoned out of his mind. But they’re a crazy bunch and good to have around if I come back in an un-average- for-me condition. I ran into Dora Me the day before yesterday and she said the halls are like that, too, and worse. They make me study a couple hours a day but around ten it seems like everyone’s out in the hall messin’ around again. That’s where the brotherhood is in this house. When you told me to go through rush, you were right when you said it’d be nice to walk around on the hill with Greek letters on my jacket. These letters really make me proud of the fraternity I belong to and especially my brothers. I think that about tells you two what the first two months have been like. Someone just came in the room to tell me we’re having a walkout with the Alpha Chi’s tonight. I was gonna go down to Maxine’s, Dad! Love, Freddie P.S. School is okay even though I have to drop Calculus tomorrow because I think I’m flunkin’. By the way, can you all send some money up for a fraternity sweatshirt? Everyone else has one! 82 Student Life The time that we spend in a crowd . . . Student Life 83 . . . helps us appreciate the time we can spend alone. Student Life 85 The Mall: It's Not Just a Dream After dodging mounds of dirt and wading through mud for several years, students finally saw the last stages of work on their long-awaited mall between the Arkansas Union and the David Mullins Library. Started in 1974 with a landfill project, the mall was near completion by the end of the year. Although work was slowed many times by foul weather, in May '75 the last stages of work were begun. Grad- ing and leveling procedures were often the cause of people skirting the area to avoid injury during the fall semester. When that was completed, the bricklaying and landscaping started. This involved the placement of some 300,000 bricks for the walk¬ ing area of the mall and the construc¬ tion of the fountain which was donated by Chi Omega Sorority. Access ramps were also built for handicapped students. Then trees and shrubs were planted in the open spaces. To save energy, the fountain was not turned on until the spring and the end of freezing weather. The mall provided students with a scenic, unmessy route between the library and the Union and left the administration with a tab for $314,643.82 which did not include the $80,000 of labor costs paid by the Physical Plant. 86 Student Life Student Life 87 Arkansas Union A Community Within a Community 88 Student Life Student Life 89 Academics Students Push for New Policies Even the first students who gradu¬ ated from the University probably felt that they had been ripped off of at least one grade by a professor. But until the last few years, they had little say in academic matters. As students have gradually gained more voice in academic fairness through the years, the Associated Student Government has begun to push for better policies. One of this year's most noteworthy accomplishments concerns academic mediation. Students now have the opportunity to question a grade through the four-step mediation sys¬ tem. For several years much research was done in this area and finally a proposal was established by the Stu¬ dent Structure for Academic Appeals, an ad hoc committee of the ASG. Their proposal was presented to the Faculty Senate and passed. Another area of concern to the ASG involved the process of grade renewal. A student proposal of aca¬ demic forgiveness was presented before the Faculty Senate which would allow an individual to repeat a course for credit, allowing the first grade to be removed entirely from the transcript or at least not figured into their grade point average (GPA). The policy through this year was to average both grades, the first one and the second one, into the GPA. During the last several years, class evaluations have become a more common practice on the U of A cam¬ pus. The Trapp Evaluations, devel¬ oped by a Fayetteville professor, were used optionally. The ASG was hoping to establish a mandatory sys¬ tem of instructor and class evalua¬ tion. Another goal of ASG was alterna¬ tives for academics in which students could take advantage of learning sit¬ uations in which they were involved. For instance, programs could be developed for giving credit to stu¬ dents in such positions as food serv¬ ice, under an intern program in nutri¬ tion, or student government presi¬ dent in the history or political sci¬ ence department. In addition to the hour credit, a student's load require¬ ment might be reduced. The ASG was also interested in establishing a student advising com¬ mittee. Through this year, all of the academic advising done on campus was conducted by faculty members. A good deal of study was being done on this possibility. Student involvement in academics has steadily grown on the U of A campus. Although most of the stu¬ dent's proposals are still up in the air, the possibilities for consideration by the Faculty Senate seemed encourag¬ ing. 90 Student Life Student Life 91 Off-Campus: Going It on Your Own More than 4,000 UA students chose the off-campus route this year, many of them dropping out of the dorm or Greek style of residence. For most, it means more responsibility, but greater freedom. The rent for an apartment can range from $60 to $270, depending on whether a room will do or an exclu¬ sive fully-carpeted and well-fur¬ nished dwelling. Despite the expense, UA graduate student Bill Howard, an industrial engineering assistant, feels the freedom to come and go as he pleases makes it worth¬ while. After living in the dorm for several years, Bill decided he'd go for a more private residence. \"This communal shower bit gets old. I can go to the army if I want that.\" He also prefers the greater amount of living area that comes with most apartments. \"You've got more room to store all your junk.\" \"You don't have to worry about someone else's rules in an apart¬ ment,\" Bill added. \"You also have a place to stay the full nine months instead of moving out during Christ¬ mas vacation.\" He admits the apartment calls for more responsibility on the part of the individual. \"But if you're not respon¬ sible enough to do your own laundry and pick up after yourself, then you need to grow up anyway.\" Sara Sealander, a junior majoring in art, spent time in both a dorm and a sorority before moving off-campus. Her next six residences ranged from a small room in the the upper story of a house to a two-bedroom apartment. She's always shared her place with a roommate in order Jo afford the apartment and to avoid getting bored. \"If I lived by myself I'd just sit around and watch television all night. There have always been three people — me, a roommate, and her boyfriend.\" Putting up with a third person who doesn't pay rent, but spends most of the day at the apartment is some¬ thing Sara has grown to accept. \"We always just kept our food sep¬ arate so there wasn't any hassle with expense. I've always done that — at least since the first semester that I found myself feeding someone else. It's always the big jock kind who comes over and says, 'What's in the refrigerator?'\" Not only has Sara gone through her share of different apartments and houses, but she's also set a record for number of roommates in a college career. \"They always either graduate or get married. I seem to be quite the matchmaker.\" She quickly recalled another roommate who flunked out of school as well. \"One of my roommates ended up marrying the guy who lived upstairs.\" She went on to explain the semester when she rented a house on School Street, she and her roommate got to know the upstairs neighbor. \"Then she went and married the guy.\" Dealing with landlords is another trial of off-campus living. Sara spoke of the hassle she had in getting her deposit back when she moved out of one more place. \"He took my deposit and I almost had to sue him to get it back. I went up there and kept yelling at him to give it back and he just ignored me. Then while I was screaming at him he all of a sudden asked me if I did any typing. He thought he might be able to use me.\" She finally got her money, but ignored the job offer. Freda Hepler, a sophomore ele¬ mentary education major, enjoys tak¬ ing advantage of the greater amount of living space by filling her apart¬ ment with plants. Given the extra room, she pursues other interests like cooking, a practice which most off- campus students learn to live with. She's seen the advantages to both an apartment and a house. \"It seems like when you live in a house you get to know the people better. It's more of a neighborly thing because you can always borrow a hammer or get some help when you need it.\" While living in a house with a retired home ec teacher upstairs, Freda built up her recipe collection by frequenting her neighbor's home. It's worth it to live off-campus just so you can have the freedom for friends to come over at all hours. A lot of added responsibility comes in living off-campus. But, for many, it pays off with the freedom of inde¬ pendent living. 92 Student Life UPPER LEFT: Although Bill Howard enjoyed the freedom and spaciousness of living off campus, he sometimes found the apartment \"desks\" weren't as comfortable as the dorm desks. LOWER LEFT: Apartment living had its advantages. Sara Sealander enjoyed the right to keep a pet while Freda Hepler (BELOW) liked the extra space for her plants. Student Life 93 Women From Campus Belles to Top Leaders 94 Student Life Although their image was much more fragile, women were a part of both the student body and the faculty in the University's opening semester in January 1872. Since then, women's involvement on campus has quietly progressed. In 1893, Julia Vaulx was named editor of the first student publication, the Uni¬ versity Magazine. Pre-professional societies for women evolved at the turn of the century, including the Young Women's Christian Association in 1904, the Sapphic Society for Parlia¬ mentary Law in 1906 and the Torch Club (later absorbed into Phi Beta Kappa) in 1908. By World War I, women were enrolling in Civil Engi¬ neering courses for the first time. At the 1947 commencement, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree was presented to Miss Jobelle Holcombe, for the first time in UA history. In recent years, the role of women on campus has increased enormously. In 1975-1976, women filled most of the major offices and positions influencing campus life. The ASG and BAD presi¬ dencies, the Razorback and Traveler editorships, the president pro tempore or the Student Senate, and key posi¬ tions on the judiciary system were all filled by women. The number of women selected for Who's Who this year outnumbered men by 2 to 1. \"This year for the University of Arkansas has been a unique one in finding women in top level positions,\" said Nancy Sindon, Dean of Women. \"I would like to think that the things happening here have encouraged women, and that the message that a woman can't be in a certain position has changed to the message that she can be.\" In earlier University days, the absence of women in high positions was a very clear message to everyone. There have been no women presidents or vice presidents in the entire history of the school. All deans at UA except the Dean o.f Nursing and Dean of Women have been negligently lacking in women. There have only been two female presidents of ASG. One fact is quite interesting. During World War II, the number of women editors for the yearbook and campus newspaper greatly increased. Since then, more women have moved into the mass media on campus than in other areas. Even with the large number of female leaders on campus, Nancy Sifi- don feels that the majority of women are still in a \"helpmate\" role. She also says that most women in key positions have been either invisible or thought of as exceptions. What about the future? Will women continue to grow in awareness of their roles in society? Kathy Hollingsworth, All University Judiciary member, says \"women should do what they are capable of, qualified for, or interested in, and then should be able to accept responsibility for their actions.\" \"But first of all,\" Sindon says, \"women have got to believe that they can be in those positions.\" She is hopeful for this in the light of the Governor's survey of high school attitudes which revealed a high percentage of awareness and aspirations among the high school girls. \"These girls will come to the Uni¬ versity and I hope we can keep the environment open and not kill their aspirations,\" says Sindon. Their atti¬ tudes and the environment will work together to help women's status. In the meantime, it's still difficult to be a woman in a leadership position. It's harder to be heard, taken seriously, or appreciated. Dean Sindon summed up the feelings of many women today: \"In spite of the difficulties of being a woman in an important position dur¬ ing this time, I wouldn't for anything trade the excitement and challenges my work offers me.\" Varied Nationalities Converge at UA In the fall of 1949, about 20 foreign students enrolled at the U of A as the first group of students from abroad. The enrollment this year reached 245, representing about 40 different countries. Although the Far East had the high¬ est percentage of students with 40 per cent, the Middle East and North Africa were close, making up to 35 per cent of the foreign population. Fifty per cent of the foreign stu¬ dents were graduate students while the other 50 per cent included under¬ graduates and special students. Approximately 86 percent were men and only 14 per cent were women. Numerous programs have been developed to make foreign students feel at home. The International Hos¬ pitality Committee of Northwest Arkansas provided several programs for foreign students. The Host Family Program, including 137 community families and 134 international stu¬ dents. The International Wives Pro¬ gram provided activities throughout the semester for a group of about 20 international students and faculty wives. Clubs have also been formed for the international students. The Inter¬ national Club, Friends of India Soci¬ ety, Crescent Club, and Chinese Stu¬ dent Union Association were the major organizations. The U of A Bap¬ tist Student Union also provided a program for international students. Although foreign students did face several problems being in a new environment, numerous people and programs helped them adjust to the U of A lifestyle. % Student Life Of the 245 foreign students on the U of A campus in '75-'76, 15 were Vietnamese refugees. Coming here from refugee camps at Fort Chaffee (in Fort Smith), California, Florida and Pennsylvania, these students included a lawyer from Saigon; a family of three sisters and one brother, a helicopter pilot and some 18-year-old students. Four churches in the Fayetteville area and several U of A faculty mem¬ bers served as sponsors for the Viet¬ namese students. Dr. Earl Caspers was one of these involved faculty members. Having worked in the teacher's college in Vietnam from 1966 to 1970, he became acquainted with Vietnamese young people. He stated that sponsorship of a Vietnam¬ ese student is no legal commitment, but a moral obligation. Sponsorship involved meeting the student's needs for food, clothing, and living accomodations. Their tui¬ tion was paid for by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in Washington, D.C. This year they paid out-of-state tuition. Whether they paid in-state or out-of- state tuition was the decision of the University's p"
