        "text": "Post by andre005 on\n\nI always thought it was Steve Ferrone who played on the Big Thing album.\n\nBoth are credited with playing on it..\n\nDuran Duran Wiki\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuran Duran Wiki\n\nBig Thing\n\nEdit\n\nBig Thing\n\n417 big thing album duran duran wikipedia DDB 33 UK discography discogs lyric wiki\n\nalbum by Duran Duran\n\nReleased 18 October 1988\n\n27 September 2010\n\n(Special Editions)\n\nRecorded 1988\n\nBig Thing is the fifth studio album by Duran Duran, released by Capitol-EMI on 18 October 1988.\n\nAbout the album\n\nIn 1988 the musical climate was changing, veering to a more dance-based groove. Duran Duran were known primarily as an early 80s new wave synthpop act, and the band was sitting at a career crossroads; Big Thing was their stab at maintaining musical credibility.\n\nTurning to more synth- and bass-heavy grooves than their previous efforts, Big Thing was seen by many as the band's \"house music\" album. Tracks like the first single \"I Don't Want Your Love\", \"Big Thing\", and the album's runaway second single \"All She Wants Is\" cemented the band's more aggressive dance angle.\n\nTo further distance themselves from their earlier incarnation, the band decided to stylise how they spelt their name, shortening it to the single word \"Duranduran\" and vocalist Simon Le Bon grew his hair out.\n\nTo get the new music played without preconceived 'teeny bopper band' notions of Duranduran, the band sent an edited medley version of \"The Edge of America\" and \"Lake Shore Driving\" called \"Official Bootleg: The LSD Edit\" around the radio stations, under the pseudonym of \"The Krush Brothers\". The band also played a few surprise live dates under this name.\n\nDance music and stylist respellings aside, Big Thing was an album of contrasts. While the general feel was a response to the burgeoning house music and rave scene, a number of tracks on the album harked back to the band's more lushly arranged ballads. Songs like \"Land\", \"Palomino\" and the single \"Do You Believe in Shame?\" had more in common with \"Save A Prayer\" or \"The Seventh Stranger\" than with Chicago house.\n\nThe album also contains two short pieces entitled \"Interlude One\" and \"Flute Interlude\" which were more experimental in nature than anything the band had done before.\n\nThe album was eventually reissued on CD with the original Daniel Abraham mix of \"Drug\" added as a bonus track.\n\nWarren Cuccurullo\n\nGuitarist Warren Cuccurullo had begun working with Duran Duran in the middle of the recording of the previous album Notorious (1986), after the acrimonious departure of former guitarist Andy Taylor. While he was still not a full band member, nor a true songwriting partner, Big Thing was the first full album with which Cuccurullo was involved. His contributions can be felt all over the record, from the \"lead vamp guitar\" on \"All She Wants Is\" to the crazed guitar solo on album closer \"Lake Shore Driving\".\n\nAt the end of the global Electric Theatre Tour promoting Big Thing in 1989, Cuccurullo was made a full-time member of the band along with drummer Sterling Campbell.\n\nChart position\n\nThe album reached #15 in the UK and #24 in the US.\n\nSingles\n\n\"I Don't Want Your Love\" (Sept 1988)\n\n\"All She Wants Is\" (Dec 1988)\n\n\"Do You Believe in Shame?\" (April 1989)\n\nPromo singles (Radio/DJ only):\n\n\"Big Thing\" (1988)\n\n\"Official Bootleg: The LSD Edit\" (1989, as The Krush Brothers)\n\n\"Too Late Marlene\" (1989)\n\nWhile the album and the first two singles did quite well in the charts, the relative failure of the third single \"Do You Believe in Shame?\" killed off any chance for a fourth single from the album. A house version of Drug (It's Just a State of Mind)\" which had been recorded with producer Marshall Jefferson in April 1989 had been tentatively slated as that single.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"Big Thing\" - 3:41\n\n\"I Don't Want Your Love\" - 4:06\n\n\"All She Wants Is\" - 4:34\n\n\"Too Late Marlene\" - 5:08\n\n\"Drug (It's Just a State of Mind)\" - 4:36\n\n\"Do You Believe in Shame?\" - 4:23\n\n\"Palomino\" - 5:19\n\n\"Interlude One\" - 0:32\n\n\"Land\" - 6:12\n\n\"Flute Interlude\" - 0:32\n\n\"The Edge of America\" - 2:37\n\n\"Lake Shore Driving\" - 3:03\n\nBonus tracks:\n\n\"Drug (It's Just a State of Mind)\" (Daniel Abraham Mix) - 4:20\n\nBonus tracks: Duran Goes Dutch (Japan only):\n\nThe Duran Goes Dutch live promo EP was included as a bonus disc on Japanese editions of Big Thing. All tracks were recorded at The Ahoy, Rotterdam, 1987.\n\n\"Notorious\" (Live) - 4:15\n\n\"Vertigo (Do the Demolition)\" (Live) - 5:28\n\n\"New Religion\" (Live) - 5:31\n\n\"Hungry Like the Wolf\" (Live) - 5:02\n\n\"American Science\" (Live) - 4:57\n\nNon-album tracks\n\nThe following songs from the Big Thing sessions were either released as B-sides, on compilations, or scrapped altogether.\n\n\"I Believe\" / \"All I Need to Know\"\n\n\"Follow In My Footsteps\"\n\n\"Capitol Chill\"\n\n\"Pressure\"\n\nPersonnel\n\nDuran Duran are:\n\nSimon Le Bon - vocals\n\nJohn Taylor - bass guitar\n\nNick Rhodes - keyboards\n\nWith:\n\nWarren Cuccurullo - guitar (tracks: 1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12)\n\nChester Kamen - guitar (tracks: 2, 3)\n\nSterling Campbell - drums\n\nSteve Ferrone - drums (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9)\n\nAlso credited:\n\nSaxophone - Patrick Bourgoin (tracks: 1, 2, 5), Stan Harrison (tracks: 1, 2, 5) David Tofani (track: 4)\n\nTrumpet - Mac Gollehon (tracks: 1, 2, 5)\n\nPercussion - Marc Chantereau (tracks: 1 to 5, 9, 11, 12)\n\nDrums (urban jungle) - Louis César Ewandé (track: 12)\n\nBacking vocals - Carole Fredericks (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 9)\n\nBacking vocals - Joniece Jamison (tracks: 1, 2, 5)\n\nBacking vocals - Beckie Bell (track: 9)\n\nBacking vocals - Yvonne Jones (track: 9)\n\nKeyboards (additional) - Jonathan Elias\n\nTrombone - Glenn Ferris (tracks: 1, 5)\n\nTrumpet - Lew Soloff (track: 1)\n\nPost by aftertherain on\n\nI asked this question or commented similar in the past on here as I was confused as to why Sterling Campbell got a cameo on the rear cover of Decade if he hadn't contributed to any songs that the compilation covered. Someone responded to advise me had played on Big Thing. I think I took that with a pinch of salt, but then after that I'm sure I then saw a Big Thing era interview with Nick Rhodes, who said that Sterling added some drums late in the process - so maybe he is an uncredited session musician for the album.\n\nStill don't think he should have been on the back of Decade though. 😆\n\nI think you forgot that Sterling was a member of DD..so he technically is an Ex-member of Duran. Even though it was short run-he wasn't a session member or tour musician like Dom he was an \"official\" Duran Duran member during Liberty..\n\n&\n\nAt the time of Decade’s release,\n\nDD released the single ‘burning the ground’, SC was on it, in the film clip and indeed an official DD member\n\nI too get why he was on Decades back cover\n\nhow were DD to know the SC partnership wasn’t going to last ?\n\njust as, how did anyone know AT would depart only one LP in, after the reunion\n\nthese things are hard to predict"
