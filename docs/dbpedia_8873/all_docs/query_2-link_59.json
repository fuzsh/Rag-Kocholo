        "text": "I have never bothered with Peace (the singles are so dreary), but I've heard literally nothing from We Too Are One. Should I try to grab the reissue if my favorite Eurythmics albums are Revenge and Savage?\n\nIf you like Revenge, I see no reason why you'd not love We Too Are One. I think most people were disappointed after Savage, that it was a sort of back-to-typical-mid-80s-Eurythmics. But there are some brilliant songs, not least Don't Ask Me Why. The title track is nicely electronic, My My Baby's Gonna Cry is like the best of Revenge or Be Yourself Tonight's album tracks....and it's pretty high on hooks and being commercial.\n\nIt's really not a bad album, slightly more polished/pop than Revenge, but less fun and more sombre in tone than Savage. Seeing as you like both of those, I should image it'll be welcome to your ears. Do you like Shakespear's Sister's Sacred Heart album? A lot of the same band/musicians/producers are across that and Revenge/Savage/We Too Are One - people like Jimmy Lovine, Joniece Jamison, Jimmy Z, etc.\n\nI only know the four Sacred Heart songs that are on the Best Of, so to answer your question - probably! Been waiting for a reissue on that one honestly. I went ahead and picked up a cheap copy of Hormonally Yours after waiting for a while on the hope of a reissue, and of course should have checked with you first. The album is so quiet and the album versions of the singles are... underwhelming. Of course it was worth it for the amazing Are We In Love Yet and Let Me Entertain You. I have the rereleased edition with the single mixes in my Discogs Wantlist!\n\nI don't dislike any of the Eurythmic albums I have (Sweet Dreams through Savage), but definitely return to the later albums the most. I think I ought to take the plunge on We Too Are One. How bizarre that not a single track made the (rather brilliant) Ultimate Collection, yet the two Peace duds did. The WTAO singles performed well on the charts, by Eurythmics standards!"
