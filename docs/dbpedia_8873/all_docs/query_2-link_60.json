Also, ‘James the Just’ features in the Bible as Jesus’ brother.\n\nJacob is the son of Isaac and Rebecca in the Old Testament and the father of the twelve founders of Israel’s twelve tribes.

Jamesson was the first altered spelling of the surname in the 14th century.\n\nThe phonetic spelling of the beautiful name is JAYM-ə-sən.
