        "text": "List a song that you thought was made a whole lot better by the backup singers. Songs that without the backup singers would have just been OK. With the backup singers it becomes great.\n\nOne that stands out for me is Every Time I Think of You by the Babies.\n\nFunny you should bring up this topic, OP. I was listening to More Than I Can Say by Leo Sayer last night and while I like him, I LOVE the backup singers, especially at the end. They absolutely make this song, IMO. I find myself being distracted by them whenever I hear it. Maybe the backup vocals are done by Sayer too, but whatever, I like it far more than the rest of the song.\n\nR6 All I could think of during that video was at least Cissy knows to wear sleeves as an older lady, and I was constantly scared that Aretha was going to expose her breasts to everyone.\n\nI love the male backup singers on “You Got It” by Roy Orbison.\n\nThe singers on Bowie’s “Modern Love” are fun, too.\n\n[quote] Robert (Palmer)\n\nThanks for the correction. I was at a total loss associating Arnold Palmer with anything more melodious then a Penzoil commercial.\n\n[quote] Lightnin' Strikes, by Lou Christie\n\nI don't know about his live appearances but on the record the backup group were Denise Ferri, Bernadette Carroll and Peggy Santiglia. They did a lot of backup vocals and Bernadette had several minor hit records of her own.\n\nDon't forget KC and the Sunshine Band's \"That's he Way I Like It\". It's all back up singers!\n\nThe late great Sylvester had a string of hits in the early 1980s. His backup singers, The Weather Girls, did most of the lead vocals.\n\nIt was a big hit when it was out but has faded from memory. It's one of my all time favorite songs. Stevie Nicks do back up for John Steward Gold. She just fucking makes the song.\n\nLou Christie's real name is Luigi Sacco. His eyes give away he's high in that Midnight Special clip, which is the best version of that song EVER! the backup girl on the right, she's cute, is famous from working with big stars on their albums and concerts. She's in the Linda Ronstadt Midnight Special clip singing 'You're No Good\". Lou is so sexy in that video, you can see the outline of his huge Italian pinga.\n\nHere is the fabulous Margie Hendricks and the Raelettes. It’s too bad the industry was so male-oriented when she was alive. In a just world, she would be in the Hall of Fame on her own.\n\nHer backup singer is okay too.\n\nOf Margie Hendricks, Ray Charles said, \"Aretha, Gladys, Etta James—these gals are all bad, but on any given night, Margie will scare you to death.\"\n\n[quote] Gonna go with another Steely Dan song. I love the backups on “Babylon Sister”.\n\nYes, r50, that is a great one. Fantastic when performed live and the girls are given the spotlight\n\n\"you gotta shake it, baby / you gotta shake it, baby / you gotta shake IT...\"\n\nR63, Merry Clayton's vocal is epic. It is really more of a duet vocal as she gives the song it's entire personality. Yes, she did have a stillbirth (or miscarriage) but NOT because she blew out their sound system. That is an unfortunate myth. She was nearly full-term at the time...so tragic. Ms. Clayton has had some hard times.\n\nCame here to give props to those who mentioned all of Stevie's backup appearances, and Mick on your so vain. Related, as they made the song but are not vocals...Prince's keyboards on Stevie's Stand Back.\n\nDoes anyone have info on the backup singers on the 5 or 6 Bacharach/David/Warwick Scepter Records albums of the 1960s? They are one of the many elements on these records which never grow old to me- the vocal arrangements and the backups themselves are amazing. I tried Googling and was not able to find out much but it sounds to me like they are the same or mostly the same backups on all the records. Did DeeDee Warwick sing backup for Dionne? The one below is beyond perfection.\n\nPrimitive Radio Gods' \"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth...\" owns this thread. The well placed sample of BB King's \"How Blue Can You Get\" shreds the listener to pieces. The song is literally nothing without this melancholic rift. I personally know of 2 people who have been profoundly affected by this song. Howard Stern stated on his radio show that he wept uncontrollably the first time he listened to it.\n\nYou must have read my mind OP, I was listening to that last night thinking of how great the backup singers are. I also found out recently found out that John Waite was also the lead singer of Bad English.\n\nGino Vannelli had great background singers, especially on \"I Just Wanna Stop\" and \"Living Inside Myself\"\n\nOther faves: Cissy Houston, Jocelyn Brown and Gwen Guthrie on Aretha's \"Until You Come Back to Me\"\n\nPatti Austin on Frankie Valli's \"Swearin' to God\"\n\nLuther Vandross, Jocelyn Brown and Gwen Guthrie on Roberta Flack's \"God Don't Like .Ugly\"\n\nIrene Cara on Vicki Sue Robinson's \"Turn the Beat Around\"\n\nMinnie Riperton and Deniece Williams on Fontella Bass's \"Rescue Me\"\n\nMariah Carey records her own back-up vocals and stacks them with the main track. Always Be My Baby is perhaps her best.\n\nI KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE BACK, BOY WHEN YOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS GET A LITTLE BIT COLDERRRRR\n\nOne of my all-time favourites: 'I Used To Love Him' by Lauryn Hill feat. Mary J. Blige. Lauryn and Mary sound great, but the background singers and harmonies are nothing short of exceptionally outstanding. Without them, this song wouldn't be the masterpiece it is:\n\nR162 That is so weird that you posted that, I was scrolling to the end of the thread and just about to post a Paul Young song!\n\nR141, yes I was joking. Seeing the name just stood out for me, but I'm glad I could make you smile.\n\nThis is a great performance. Deniece Williams on backup bringing it.\n\n80s British backup tarts were one of a kind, R163, and Paul, Maz and Kim were phenomenal.\n\nIn a similar vein, Jo and Sue were so good they became primary singers on the rest of Human League's discography, but I always loved the simplicity of this.\n\nDiana Ross is the reason Diane Ross became a superstar. Flo Ballard was no Jennifer Holliday or Hudson. She was never going to be some great solo star. She sang good backup, had great exposure and good friends but that wasn't enough. She fucked up again and again. I doubt there were any performers in the Motown stable that couldn't sing a soulful background harmony or vocal flourish. They were treated as interchangeable before they were stars. As the records state. It's 50 years later and Diana Ross is still a star. Her voice is the one that shone.\n\nAin't No Mountain High Enough - Diana Ross and THE SUPREMES\n\nI was personally never a fan of this song, but it's arguably the most iconic meeting OP's standard. It's played to death in movies, tv episodes, commercials. I truly think it's the most famous example.\n\nThe Supremes didn't sing on Ain't No Mountain High Enough R178. That was from Ross's first solo album. The Supremes didn't even sing on Diana Ross & The Supremes final #1 hit! Ashford and Simpson wrote and sang backup vocals on the song you posted. Here is DR at her starry best, proving she could sing that song LIVE with a full orchestra. There was never a doubt.\n\nI love backup singers because they add harmony and texture to the sound. It's part of the reason I can't get into Adele. She records her own backup vocals and it sounds weirdly thin because her vowel sounds are so distinct and howlish.\n\nBette Midler Live singing \"Paradise\" . She had bronchitis and the Harlettes haul ass, carrying the song with tight harmonies.\n\nThey actually work in the vowel sequence \"a e i o u\" into their vocals at 3:22\n\nOT: Ugh, with that caterwauling by screechy Diana Ross (Blow your nose!) killing \"Ain't No Mountain..\" Give me Tammi Terrell any fucking day of the week. Her harmony on \"You're All I Need..\" is absolute perfection.\n\n[quote]After The Fire is Gone- a duet with Willie Nelson and Tracy Nelson with Linda Ronstadt coming in on the last chorus and blowing them away!\n\nIf you hadn't mentioned her, I would never have recognized Linda.\n\nHow about when the backup singer just takes over the song?\n\nThis is supposed to be Samantha Sang's single but it was written by Barry and Robin Gibb. They backed up her but you hear more of them in the mix than Sang.\n\nThe Youtube comments are comedy gold.\n\nOf course it's been mentioned, but Gimme Shelter. Those high notes she hit are nothing like I'd heard before or since. Too bad she didn't have a successful solo career, such a beautiful rock voice.\n\nWow, interesting story about Merry Clayton doing the Gimme Shelter backup. They decided to add a female vocal to it, in the late evening in the studio, called around, couldn't find anyone to do it. Finally called Merry at nearly midnight while she was in bed, and she agreed to come in. She was pregnant and had to sit on a stool. Did it in a couple takes and left, and shortly after, had a miscarriage! The intensity of the recording session caused it, poor woman. Of course she couldn't listen to the song for many years.\n\n^^When I saw this thread resurrected I figured it was to pay tribute to Clydie King. She was even more unsung than Darlene Love and sang on just as many classic songs like Tumbling Dice, Sweet Home Alabama, You're no good, You make me feel like dancing, Deacon blue and many others.\n\nOlivia Newton-John for \"Fly Away\" and Sheena Easton \"You Got The Look.\"\n\nStevie Nicks \"Whenever I Call You Friend,\"(not credited at the time / See below)\n\nWhoever sang backup on:\n\nLove the one your with by Stephen Stills\n\nSpirit in the sky by Norman Greenbaum\n\nIt never rains in Southern California by Albert Hammond\n\nRock me gently by Andy Kim\n\nC'est la vie by Robbie Neville\n\n9to5 by Dolly\n\nStep by Step by Whitney Houston. Now, don't go shrieky on me...but her backing vocals are being done by none other than bona-fide gay icon Annie Lennox. If you're familiar with Annie, you'll recognise her vocals instantly. It was originally released as the b-side to Lennox's own song \"Precious\". It's a beautiful song, even without Whitney's vocal histrionics...\n\nr330, no Boy George just decided to dump her for their shitty 3rd album, wanting to change their sound. Maybe he also didn't like that CC was being considered a double lead vocal band, and Helen was being praised alongside him. He said she didn't get mad about being asked to leave, but I read Boy accused her of getting him hooked on drugs in his first book and Helen furiously denied it. The band did help her release a solo album in 1986, but it didn't sell, and by the end up the decade she'd retired from singing. Being unattractive and overweight, she just wasn't going to make it solo.\n\nthey may have been too much a part of the song but the Hawkins Singers on Melanie's Lay Down. One of the all time great pop-rock songs.\n\nThat's The Way It Is - Celine Dion.\n\nLay Down Sally - Eric Clapton\n\nBreathe - Faith Hill\n\nI hate the trend of Adele etc recording their own backup vocals. It lacks texture.\n\nThe backup singers on Aretha Franklin's \"Say A Little Prayer\" carry the song. Aretha must have been bored with the song because she doesn't do any of the heavy lifting.\n\n[Quote] I read Boy accused her of getting him hooked on drugs in his first book and Helen furiously denied it.\n\nNo. She was pissed that he outed her own drug use.\n\nR239: I think Aretha wanted her version to sound as different from Dionne's as possible since her's was out only months earlier. The Sweet Inspirations probably sang on both versions.\n\nSinéad O'Connor singing back up on Peter Gabriel's The Blood of Eden\n\nCarol King singing back up on Carly Simon's Attitude Dancing\n\nAny Gladys Knight & the Pips song. (Would she have been as popular Pip-less?)\n\nMentioned upthread were Michael’s Man In The Mirror, Madonna’s Like A Prayer & Rick’s Cry For Help. They all had The Andrae Crouch Choir to back them. Amazing when you think they were all able to add a gospel flavor to songs from entirely different genres,\n\n[quote]I think Aretha wanted her version to sound as different from Dionne's as possible\n\nWell, it sounds more like Aretha is singing in between bites of a meatloaf sandwich.\n\nSamantha Sang was basically an Antipodean Cilla Black - she of the two voices - so it was probably for the best that Barry made Sang a bit player on her own hit."
