I was borne from original sin. And if I had a dollar bill For all the things I've done There'd be a mountain of money Piled up to my chin My mother told me good My mother told me strong. She said \"Be true to yourself And you can't go wrong.\" \"But there's just one thing That you must understand.\" \"You can fool with your brother But don't mess with a missionary man.\" Don't mess with a missionary man. Don't mess with a missionary man. Well the missionary man He's got god on his side. He's got the saints and apostles Backin' up from behind. Black eyed looks from those bible books. He's a man with a mission Got a serious mind. There was a woman in the jungle And a monkey on a tree. The missionary man he was followin' me. He said \"Stop what you're doing.\" \"Get down upon your knees.\" \"I've a message for you that you better believe.\"\n\nThe easy, fast & fun way to learn how to sing: 30DaySinger.com\n\n4 fans\n\nSheet Music PDF Playlist\n\nWritten by: ANNIE LENNOX, DAVID ALLAN STEWART\n\nLyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nLyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind"
