        "text": "Garbage\n\nShirley Manson – circa 1995\n\n“I came to cut you up / I came to knock you down / I came around to tear your / Little world apart” – ‘Vow’ (Garbage)\n\n“We always felt like the oddballs who never fit in with the cool school and I think a lot of people identified with the outsider status,” claims Shirley Manson, the Scottish-born singer in U.S. rock band Garbage. There is a contradiction in Manson’s statement: An ‘outsider’ is a minority, yet ‘a lot of people’ identify with Garbage. Is this a majority of a minority? Maybe it says something about the plague-like spread of low self-esteem in the late twentieth century – early twenty-first century. The band chooses the name of Garbage due to an early comment that their work sounds ‘like Garbage.’\n\nThe origins of Garbage are split between two distinct strands: Shirley Manson and the rest of the group. The sequence of events really starts with the three male members of Garbage. Let’s begin with Butch Vig…\n\nBryan David ‘Butch’ Vig is born on 2 August 1955 in Viroqua, Wisconsin, U.S.A. He is the son of Dr DeVerne Vig and Betty Vig (nèe Brewster). Dr Vig is a physician of Norwegian descent. Betty Vig (Brewster) comes from a family background of Cornish, Danish, English, Scottish and – remotely – French. She teaches choral music and English at Viroqua High School for two years. DeVerne Vig and Betty Brewster wed on 19 December 1953. Their son, Bryan, is nicknamed ‘Butch’ in childhood due to a severe haircut his father gives him. Butch has two siblings: a brother named Chris and a sister named Lisa.\n\nButch Vig recalls that, “I was always obsessed with music. My mother was a music teacher and ours was a musical household.” Butch starts to learn to play piano ‘at an early age’ and continues on that path for six years. The turning point comes on 15 September 1967 when Butch sees British rock band The Who perform on U.S. television program ‘The Smothers Brothers Show’. Inspired by The Who’s drummer Keith Moon, Butch swaps his piano for a sixty-dollar drum kit.\n\nWhatever Butch Vig’s musical ambitions may be, they are set aside at least temporarily when he heads off to the University of Wisconsin to study film directing. A different account says that Vig obtains a degree from the University of Wisconsin for composing electronic soundtracks for movies, so perhaps his interest in music fits in with his interest in film. While he is at the University of Wisconsin, Butch Vig meets Duke Erikson.\n\nDuke Erikson is born Douglas Erwin Erickson on 15 January 1951 in Lyons, Nebraska, U.S.A. The ‘c’ is dropped from his surname when he becomes a professional musician. Lyons is described as ‘a small rural community.’\n\nDuke Erikson is said to have been ‘a music-loving kid.’ Like Butch Vig, Duke Erikson starts out by playing piano, but then switches to a different instrument. Unlike Vig, Erikson becomes a guitarist. When he is 16, Erikson and some school friends put together a band. The group is called The British. That may seem an odd name for a bunch of American kids, but they are inspired by the so-called ‘British Invasion’ bands of the early to mid-1960s (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Who, etc.). These were English groups who were having great success in the U.S.A.\n\nAfter high school, Duke Erikson moves to Wayne, Nebraska, where he attends Wayne State College. Like Butch Vig, Duke Erikson sets aside his musical ambitions to some degree. He studies art history and practices painting and drawing. To make ends meet financially, Duke Erikson also picks up work as a carpenter and as a truck driver. Duke becomes a teaching assistant and teaches art at Wayne State College for a couple of semesters. At the same time, he still plays in bands. “I came close to going on to being an art teacher,” Erikson explains. However, “a friend of mine I had a couple of bands with in Wayne moved to Madison, Wisconsin. His girlfriend was going to law school there. I thought I might go to grad school there. I moved. We started a band, of course. Never made it to grad school.”\n\nIn Madison, Wisconsin, Duke Erikson puts together an acoustic trio called Spooner. The year is 1974. When this ‘soft pop group’ decides it needs a drummer, local musician Butch Vig is enlisted. Duke Erikson is both lead vocalist and guitarist in Spooner. This band records ‘three unsuccessful albums’ before breaking up in 1987. Those albums are: ‘Every Corner Dance’ (1982), ‘Wildest Dreams’ (1984) and ‘The Fugitive Dance’ (1990). (Their final album went unreleased for three years.)\n\nDuring his time in Spooner, Duke Erikson and Sarah O’Brien have a daughter, Roxy (born in 1978). Sarah O’Brien goes on to become a circuit judge in Dane County, Wisconsin. Roxy Erickson, unlike her father, keeps the ‘c’ in her surname. Roxy becomes a professional photographer.\n\nThe sound engineer for Spooner is a fellow named Steve Marker. He is fated to become the third member of Garbage.\n\nSteve Marker is born on 16 March 1959 in Mamaroneck, New York, U.S.A. His mother is named Judy. Steve’s family moves around a lot, but he spends most of his childhood and teens in Mamaroneck. When Steve is 6 years old, his parents buy him a drum kit. At the age of 12, Steve changes his musical preference and starts playing guitar. After graduating from Rye Neck High School in Mamaroneck, Steve Marker goes on to the University of Wisconsin in Madison in pursuit of a film degree. As a communications/arts major at that university, Marker meets Butch Vig. This leads to Steve Marker working as a sound engineer for Spooner.\n\nDuring Spooner’s career another event takes place that has a lasting influence on the fate of the future members of Garbage. In 1983, Butch Vig and Steve Marker set up a recording studio in Madison. This facility is given the name of Smart Studios. The production work carried out there soon begins to build a positive reputation for Smart Studios.\n\nButch Vig and Duke Erikson form a new band called Fire Town. They collaborate on the songwriting. Vocalist Paul Davis is also part of Fire Town. A ‘modestly successful guitar outfit,’ Fire Town makes ‘two well regarded’ albums for Atlantic Records: ‘In The Heart Of The Country’ (1987) and ‘The Good Life’ (1989). Following the creation of these works, Fire Town disbands.\n\nWhile Spooner and Fire Town struggled to find an audience, Smart Studios proves more prosperous. U.S. independent record labels such as Sub Pop keep sending clients their way. Butch Vig produces albums such as ‘Gish’ (1991) (US no. 195, AUS no. 51) by The Smashing Pumpkins, ‘Nevermind’ (1991) (US no. 1, UK no. 5, AUS no. 2) by Nirvana, ‘Dirty’ (1992) (US no. 23, UK no. 6, AUS no. 22) by Sonic Youth and ‘Siamese Dream’ (1993) (US no. 10, UK no. 4, AUS no. 7) by The Smashing Pumpkins. Although these projects give Butch Vig notoriety and respect, he feels “kind of burned out on doing really long records.” Vig gets together with Steve Marker and Duke Erikson to do remixes on singles by acts such as U2, Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails. In a remix, the production artists basically reinvent a song, changing instrumental emphasis, adding new rhythm patterns, stretching out the running time, turning a minor lyric into a refrain or whatever other touches they care to impart. The trio decide to form a new group where they will use “that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup.” The first attempts have Butch Vig on vocals but they soon decide to have a female vocalist instead. Steve Marker wants a singer “who doesn’t have a high, chirpy, girly quality to her voice.” Butch Vig frowns upon “these alterna-rock singers [that] have a tendency to scream.” The simplest way to satisfy these requirements seems to be to invite several different singers to appear on only a track or two each. Butch Vig contacts Kim Gordon, the secondary vocalist in Sonic Youth. Steve Marker sees a video for a song called ‘Suffocate Me’ by a band called Angelfish that screens on ‘120 Minutes’, a program on the U.S. cable network MTV. He contracts his confreres and all three agree to abandon the multi-vocalist concept and try to obtain the services of the girl from Angelfish instead. Shannon O’Shea, the manager of the embryonic new band, is sent off to track down this vocalist. Her name is Shirley Manson.\n\nShirley Ann Manson is born on 26 August 1966 in Edinburgh, Scotland. She is the daughter of John Mitchell Manson and Muriel Flora Manson (nèe MacKay). John Manson is a geneticist, a university lecturer and a Sunday School teacher at the Presbyterian Church. Muriel Manson is the product of a tryst between a butler and governess and was abandoned at an orphanage. “My mom was an orphan and she wasn’t adopted until age 5 [by the McDonald family]. And because of this she always felt like she was a zero. She tried hard to be a part of things, to make everyone feel good. And I grew up doing the same ‘cause I wanted to be like my mom,” Shirley explains. Her mother goes on to become a big band singer. Shirley Manson is named after an aunt who, in turn, was named after Charlotte Bronte’s novel ‘Shirley’ (1849). Shirley Manson has two sisters, Lindy-Jane (born in 1964) and Sarah (born in 1968). “I was a redhead and a middle child: both can make you feel excluded. After a while you develop a bit of a victim mentality, which isn’t great for a happy life,” Shirley admits. As for her famous red hair, Shirley exclaims, “It’s all natural!…I was born a redhead. My mom’s a redhead, my sister’s a redhead – I come from a lineage of Viking reds.” Yet, Shirley notes, “People don’t associate red hair, pale skin and freckles with beauty…My mom was always hardest on me because I looked the most like her. She would tell my two sisters they were beautiful, but tell me I had a great personality. I just thought I was an ugly b*st*rd…The sensation of never feeling good enough or pretty enough will always be there.”\n\nShirley Manson grows up in the Comely Bank and Stackbridge areas of Edinburgh. When she is 4 years old, Shirley gives her first public performance when she and her older sister appear in an amateur show at the local Church Hill Theatre. Shirley Manson attends Flora Stevenson Primary School where, aside from the usual schoolwork, she learns to play recorder, clarinet and fiddle. When she is 7, Shirley also learns ballet and to play piano in lessons outside the school environment. The youngster also becomes a Brownie and a Guide in the Girl Guides.\n\nShirley Manson moves on to the City of Edinburgh Music School, the music department of Broughton High. While at the school, Shirley appears in both amateur dramatic productions and school musicals. She also performs with the Waverly Singers, a local girls’ choir.\n\nThere is a darker side to Shirley Manson’s teenage years. She is bullied in her first year at Broughton High. As a result, Shirley suffers ‘from depression and engage[s] in self-injury.’ The youngster carries a sharp object in her boot-laces and cuts herself when she feels ‘low self-esteem, stress or anxiety.’ The bullying stops when Shirley joins ‘a rebel crowd’ which involves her in drinking, shoplifting and low grade drug use. “I was always embarrassed because my dad wore a suit and my mother wore flat pumps and a cozy jumper while my friends’ parents were punks or hippies,” says Shirley Manson. An early sexual encounter turns ugly when, in Shirley’s words, “[he] grabbed a knife and told me he was going to stick it in my vagina. I was 13 years old. It frightened the s*** out of me.” In her haste to get away, the young girl leaves her bra behind. The other party threatens to mail it to her parents. Shirley Manson goes on to have a relationship with one of her school teachers.\n\nShirley Manson’s early jobs include volunteering at a hospital cafeteria, being a breakfast waitress at a hotel, working on the make-up counter at Miss Selfridge and modelling clothing for ‘Jackie’ magazine.\n\nIn 1984 Shirley Manson starts her music career. She is a backing vocalist for Edinburgh band The Wild Indians. From there, Manson is recruited to Martin Metcalfe’s band Goodbye Mr McKenzie. Shirley plays keyboards as well as singing back-up vocals. She is also romantically involved with Martin Metcalfe, but this relationship is short-lived and she remains with the band after the couple split. The first release by Goodbye Mr McKenzie is the 1984 single ‘Death Of A Salesman’ on the YTS label. Moving on to Capitol Records in 1987, Goodbye Mr McKenzie releases the album ‘Good Deeds And Dirty Rags’ (1987) (UK no. 26) which includes ‘a minor U.K. hit,’ ‘The Rattler’ (UK no. 37). In 1990 the group’s contract is transferred to Parlophone, a sister label that is a fellow subsidiary of EMI. Two non-charting singles from Goodbye Mr McKenzie cause Parlophone to reconsider their plans to release the group’s second album. Gary Kurfirst, the manager of U.S. acts Talking Heads and Deborah Harry (former vocalist for Blondie), buys the recording contract for Goodbye Mr McKenzie. Kurfirst issues ‘Hammer And Tongs’ (1991) (UK no. 61) on his own Radioactive label, a subsidiary of MCA. After another non-charting single, the management of Goodbye Mr McKenzie urges the group to leave Radioactive. Plans are made for a third album, this time allowing Shirley Manson to perform lead vocals on some tracks. MCA remains uninterested but warms to the idea of a Shirley Manson solo album. Accordingly, Gary Kurfirst signs Shirley Manson to Radioactive as a solo artist. The remaining members of the disheartened Goodbye Mr McKenzie become Manson’s backing group. When recording commences, it is under the name of Angelfish (a group) rather than Shirley Manson (a solo performer). ‘Angelfish’ (1994) is produced by two members of Talking Heads, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. Two singles are lifted from this album, ‘Suffocate Me’ and ‘Heartbreak To Hate’. It is ‘Suffocate Me’ that Steve Marker sees on MTV and this sparks the search for the vocalist from Angelfish.\n\nWhen Shirley Manson is contacted by the men fated to be her future colleagues in Garbage, she has no idea of who they are. She is urged to check the credits on Nirvana’s popular album ‘Nevermind’ (1991) to see that it is produced by Butch Vig. The first meeting between the four future members of Garbage takes place in London on 8 April 1994. Later that evening, Butch Vig learns of the suicide on 5 April 1994 of Nirvana’s frontman, Kurt Cobain. The new band is put aside while Angelfish tours the United States as the support act for a group called Live. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker show up at a Chicago gig by Angelfish and Shirley is invited out to Madison, Wisconsin, for an audition. It proves ‘excruciatingly awkward for all involved.’ The rest of the group has ‘trouble understanding Shirley’s thick Scottish accent.’ Angelfish go on to complete the tour with Live and then the group disbands. Shirley Manson asks to audition again with Vig, Erikson and Marker because she has a feeling “it will work out.”\n\nWhen the two parties come together again, Shirley Manson describes it as “a disaster.” Yet, they persevere and, gradually, the pieces fall into place. “If I wasn’t in this band, I would go, ‘Yeah, right, three producers and a girl.’ But we found a chemistry…” Manson notes. A demo tape is put together and sent out to various record companies. No biographical information is included as the group, now calling itself Garbage, do not wish to trade on Butch Vig’s reputation as a producer. Garbage is signed to Mushroom U.K. for most of the world; the exception is the United States. In that country, Garbage signs with Almo on 21 December 1994.\n\nIt is known that the first wife of Garbage’s drummer Butch Vig is a woman named Patti. However that is about all that is known. No information is available about Patti’s surname, occupation or how she met Butch. The date they married and the date of their eventual divorce are also mysteries. Since Butch’s second marriage takes place in 2003, the best guess that can be offered is that it is probably around 1994 that he marries his first wife, Patti. So far as is known, Butch and Patti have no children together.\n\nThe music performed by Garbage is usually classed as alt rock or electronic rock. Alt rock is an abbreviation of alternate rock. It is music that is made and marketed outside of the most familiar forums and record labels used by mainstream rock acts. This is often necessary because the sounds are a bit too unusual for mass market consumption. Shirley Manson, vocalist for Garbage, observes, “In the 1990s the radio was still alive with all different kinds of points of view…It was the first time that alternative music broke through to the mainstream.” The music of Garbage is not as outré as the preceding information may suggest. “I love pop music. Who doesn’t?” asks Manson. Garbage is said to offer a ‘guitar-based, electronic-washed sound.’ “We wanted to make guitars sound…sort of unrecognisable,” suggests guitarist Steve Marker. Garbage’s mission statement is to make ‘a noisy, dark’ sound. Steve Marker claims they want to “take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can.” Shirley Manson says they make “sci-fi pop” with a “futuristic approach.” There are moment of crushing force and moments of unbearable tenderness. Neither exists in isolation. Garbage’s members are like ‘some C.I.A.-funded black ops unit engaged in MK Ultra mind control experiments…They’d leave your body without a scratch but your mind would be reduced to mulch.’\n\nThe members of Garbage are: Shirley Manson (vocals), Duke Erikson (guitar), Steve Marker (guitar) and Butch Vig (drums). It may be noticed that there is no bass player. “We do everything except the bass,” acknowledges Marker. The group employs bassists on record and on tour but they do not become official members of Garbage. Referring to the division of labour between the two guitarists, Duke Erikson says, “We’ve never played a role as lead guitar, rhythm guitar and that stuff…We both just do a little bit of everything…We’re pretty easy going.” Garbage is actually a fairly fluid cooperative. Butch Vig explains: “Garbage has been the most perfect artistic vehicle for me that I can imagine – because I can write a song, I can play drums, I can play guitar, I can play keyboards, I can produce, I can engineer…I’m one of four people who all do the same thing…We all have multiple roles.”\n\nGiven the malleable nature of the musical assignments within Garbage, it is perhaps not surprising that the songwriting is credited generally to the group as a whole. Unless the contrary is stated, all songs referred to here are group compositions. Before joining Garbage, vocalist Shirley Manson ‘had never written a song.’ “Shirley always has a little notebook,” observes guitarist Duke Erikson. This suggests that, even if the songs are composed collectively, the lyrics are chiefly the province of the band’s vocalist. Erikson adds that “We kind of hesitate to say what the songs are about. [We prefer to] leave it up to the listener [to interpret them].”\n\nGarbage’s visual image is also intriguing. Drummer Butch Vig is dapper and stylish but his habitual dark glasses hide a mournful bloodhound expression. Guitarist Duke Erikson seems like a mixture of a 1950s hipster beatnik and a vampire. He is described as ‘cool’ and ‘taciturn’ with a ‘dry humour.’ Guitarist Steve Marker is bulky and beefy but his imposing form is undercut by his boyish thatch of white blonde hair cut close to the scalp. However, the three male members of Garbage fade into the background in the presence of their long-limbed and flame-tressed frontwoman. Standing five feet, seven inches (one point seven metres), Shirley Manson is the focus of the band’s image and a powerful sex symbol. “I am not a sexy woman,” she contends. “I’m not beautiful, I’m not a sex kitten, I don’t flirt with people, yet I’ve been tagged more of a sex symbol than women who truly are and that’s solely because I don’t reveal too much: people are curious…I like the feeling that I’m giving young women self-confidence…I think women in pop have been declawed and defanged, and they’re just meant to look pretty and sing pretty.”\n\n“All four of us are opinionated,” says drummer Butch Vig. Vocalist Shirley Manson has a different view of Garbage’s internal interactions: “I am laughably aggressive, and the rest of the band is very laid back, so we mix well…I have a temper on me that could hold back tides…It’s definitely an intrinsic part of my makeup that makes me want to see black when everyone else is seeing white.”\n\nThe first single by Garbage is ‘Vow’ (US no. 97, UK no. 138, AUS no. 32). This is released on 20 March 1995. The music morphs around Shirley Manson’s voice as she sings, “You burned me out but / I’m back at your door / Like Joan of Arc coming / Back for more.” The sound distorts as though it is being subjected to G-forces in a wind tunnel while the singer insists she will “Break your soul apart.” ‘Vow’ was the first song Garbage had completed so it became the debut single even though the group had not considered it for that job or even for inclusion on their first album.\n\n‘Subhuman’ (UK no. 50) is the next single by Garbage. This is released on 7 August 1995 as a single…but only in the United Kingdom. This song features heavily processed vocals, electronic squeaks and squeals and percussion that sounds like colliding locomotives. ‘Subhuman’ is a stand-alone single which is not incorporated into any of Garbage’s catalogue of all-new studio recordings.\n\nThe debut album, ‘Garbage’ (1995) (US no. 20, UK no. 6, AUS no. 4), is released on 15 August. It is the first of five consecutive albums to credit production duties to Garbage (i.e. the group collectively oversees the recording sessions). ‘Garbage’ is released on the Almo label in the U.S.A. and on Mushroom for the rest of the world. Most of the songs on this album began as demo recordings in January 1994 before vocalist Shirley Manson joined the group. When she became involved, Manson revised some of the lyrics or wrote new words to better suit her approach. The debut single ‘Vow’ is included on ‘Garbage’ but the follow-up (U.K. only) single ‘Subhuman’ is not on this disc. ‘Only Happy When It Rains’ (US no. 55, UK no. 29, AUS no. 80) pits a joyful melody that rises like an incoming wave against a contrary lyric that bids “Pour your misery down” on a subject who claims “I’m riding high upon / A deep depression.” ‘Queer’ (UK no. 13, AUS no. 55) is the first Garbage single to break into the top twenty…at least it does so in the U.K. This slinky, weird cabaret number appears to be about oddity rather than homosexuality: “The queerest of the queer / The strangest of the strange / The coldest of the cool / The lamest of the lame / The numbest of the dumb.” When ‘Queer’ began as a demo with drummer Butch Vig on vocals, the lyrics were based on an unidentified novel in which a father hires a woman to make his son ‘a man.’ Shirley Manson makes the lyrics more ambiguous and gives the song a trip-hop arrangement. ‘Queer’ contains a drum loop sampled from the 1991 song ‘Man Of Straw’ by Australian band Single Gun Theory but also adds in drums played by Clyde Stubblefield. As for the homosexual connotations of ‘Queer’, Shirley Manson insists that, “It’s not, as you might think, to do with being gay, but tolerance.” Guitarist Duke Erikson says, “As musicians we’re totally open to [the song’s gay appeal]…The song isn’t about sex at all, it’s about the loss of innocence.” While ‘Queer’ samples Single Gun Theory’s ‘Man Of Straw’, ‘Stupid Girl’ (US no. 24, UK no. 4, AUS no. 47) samples the 1979 song ‘Train In Vain’ by British punk rockers The Clash. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones of The Clash are credited as co-songwriters of ‘Stupid Girl’ alongside Garbage. Although Garbage make use of such musical quotations sometimes they are, typically, so tiny and so heavily reprocessed that it would be almost impossible to recognise them if Garbage did not draw attention to them. Guitarist Steve Marker created the bass line for ‘Stupid Girl’ in its demo form but he does not play bass on the finished product. The solid beat of ‘Stupid Girl’ is matched with a bell-like guitar as Shirley Manson lets fly at “You stupid girl / All you had you wasted.” Given her history of low self-esteem, could the ‘Stupid Girl’ be Manson herself and could the song be a form of self-abuse? Butch Vig says, “People still ask us who the ‘Stupid Girl’ is, but that’s impossible to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake-up call…” The song is “really about squandering potential,” says Manson. ‘Stupid Girl’ will remain Garbage’s all-time most commercially successful single in the U.S.A. and the U.K. ‘Milk’ (UK no. 10, AUS no. 44) appears to be wilfully cryptic. “I am milk / I am red hot kitchen / And I am cool / Cool as the deep blue ocean,” coos Shirley Manson in the lyrics. Apparently backwards sounds and synthetic strings add to the mystery. ‘Milk’ is the ‘most electronic-based song on the album.’ Manson says, “To me, ‘Milk’ is the darkest, most hopeless of songs…It’s about loss and the fear of loss.” Though not issued as a single, another notable track from ‘Garbage’ is ‘Supervixen.’ This contrasts bursts of noise with gentle strokes of melody while Shirley Manson supplies attitude aplenty. The bass parts on ‘Garbage’ are played by Mike Kashou, a Milwaukee-based musician. Butch Vig admits that ‘Garbage’ has “dark themes” and flirts with “the art of self-destruction.” The songs on ‘Garbage’ are ‘dank and rainy, saturated with deep browns and lurid reds and queasy greens.’\n\nTo promote their debut album, Garbage begins a seventeen-date U.S. tour on 24 February 1996 as the supporting act to The Smashing Pumpkins. The tour is cut short when Jonathan Melvoin, who has been playing keyboards for The Smashing Pumpkins, dies on 12 July 1996 as a result of a heroin overdose. (Jonathon Melvoin was the brother of Susannah Melvoin and Wendy Melvoin. Both of his sisters were associated with funk rock star Prince: Susannah was Prince’s girlfriend from 1984 to 1986 while Wendy was the guitarist in Prince’s backing band The Revolution from 1983 to 1987.) Garbage goes on to play some shows in Europe starting from 3 August 1996.\n\nOn 7 September 1996 Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson marries Eddie Farrell, a Scottish artist.\n\nGarbage goes on a concert tour of Asia and Australia from 28 September 1996 to 18 October 1996. The group returns to the U.S.A. to once again play some shows with The Smashing Pumpkins starting on 23 October 1996.\n\nGarbage contributes a song called ‘#1 Crush’ to the soundtrack of the movie ‘Romeo + Juliet’ (1996). ‘#1 Crush’ is released as a single on 29 October 1996. A morbidly romantic song replete with groans, this piece is set to a wayward trip-hop beat. #1 Crush’ fails to chart for no obvious reason; it is as good as any other song by Garbage. It was not on ‘Garbage’, the group’s debut album, and will not be included on their second album either.\n\n‘Version 2.0’ (1998) (US no. 13, UK no. 1, AUS no. 5), released on 11 May, is the second album by Garbage. Once again, this album is released on the Almo label in the U.S.A. and on Mushroom for the rest of the world. ‘Version 2.0’ has a fairly lengthy gestation period; recording sessions began at Smart Studios in Wisconsin early in 1997 and took almost a year to complete. The working title for the album was ‘Sad Alcoholic Clowns’. The final title, ‘Version 2.0’, resembling the branding of a software update, is a ‘tongue-in-cheek take on how computers were heavily involved in the album’s production.’ “We didn’t want to totally embrace the world of electronica,” claims vocalist Shirley Manson as she points to the way the album blends “the super hi-fi with the super-organic.” Drummer Butch Vig says the goal was to “have the guitars noisier and write poppier melodies.” Shirley Manson, who writes all the lyrics on this album, says she “tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies.” ‘Push It’ (US no. 52, UK no. 9, AUS no. 31) sounds like a speeding train from which vocalist Shirley Manson hangs out the window crying, “This is the noise that / Keeps me awake / My head explodes and / My body aches / Push it, make the beats go harder.” For the record, ‘Push It’ contains a musical quote from the 1964 Beach Boys song ‘Don’t Worry Baby’. Additionally, the band’s lawyers thought there was a possible similarity to the 1987 Salt N’ Pepa hit ‘Push It’ so the authors of those two songs – Brian Wilson & Roger Christian and Herbie Azoff, respectively – are dutifully acknowledged in the credits. The second single from ‘Version 2.0’, ‘I Think I’m Paranoid’ (UK no. 9, AUS no. 57), is the best song by Garbage. “I think I’m paranoid / And complicated / I think I’m paranoid / Manipulate it,” sings Shirley Manson to the accompaniment of a riff like a crushing piston…that bizarrely gives way to a sugary keyboard sound and the “Bend me, break me” refrain. This is a classic illustration of Garbage’s approach, melding brawny rock to sweet pop through unexpected side-steps. The song was originally called ‘Bend Me’ after the “Bend me, break me” refrain. This section of the song also attracts legal action from the publishers of the 1967 hit ‘Bend Me, Shape Me’ by The American Breed. However, while Garbage is quick to credit seemingly obscure components of their songs, in this case, they reject the claim as a nuisance lawsuit only. ‘I Think I’m Paranoid’ features percussion recorded in a deserted candy factory in Madison, Wisconsin, as well as some underlying record scratching by Los Angeles disc jockey Todd Malcolm Michelles. The enticing ‘Special’ (US no. 52, UK no. 15, AUS no. 54) is about ‘a friendship Manson had moved on from after her friend had let her down.’ It contains ‘a vocal interpolation’ of a lyric from the 1980 Pretenders song ‘Talk Of The Town.’ ‘When I Grow Up’ (UK no. 9, AUS no. 22) is full of jittery energy. Shirley Manson describes it as representing “that delirious state of wishing and hoping and dreaming of things, not giving up.” In some European countries, rather than ‘When I Grow Up’, ‘The Trick Is To Keep Breathing’ is issued as a single. The latter is a muted and hushed song with a purred vocal from Manson and features Duke Erikson on keyboards as well as guitar. ‘You Look So Fine’ (UK no. 19, AUS no. 101) is a lush ballad. Daniel Shulman, the touring bassist for Garbage, plays bass on this album. ‘Version 2.0’ is the first Garbage album on which recording engineer Billy Bush assists the producers (i.e. the band). This album is the sound of ‘a flesh and blood rock band wearing a metal exo-skeleton.’\n\nGarbage’s concert tour to promote ‘Version 2.0’ starts off with three warm-up dates under the alias of Stupid Girl. The tour starts officially begins on 20 May 1998. Garbage play shows in Europe in June, Japan in August, returns to vocalist Shirley Manson’s native Scotland and then proceeds to the U.S.A. on 17 September for a further three months.\n\nGarbage issues the one-off single ‘The World Is Not Enough’ (UK no. 11) on 4 October 1999. This is the theme song from the movie ‘The World Is Not Enough’ (1999), one of the series of James Bond 007 films. Garbage only performs the song though; it is written by Don Black (lyrics) and David Arnold (music). David Arnold is also co-credited with Garbage as producer on this song. This is an interesting experiment but an oddity in the story of Garbage.\n\nIn early 2000 Almo Records is sold to the Universal Music Group. After some legal wrangling, Garbage settles with Universal on 29 July 2001 and moves to Interscope for its U.S. releases.\n\nAround this time, Garbage guitarist Steve Marker marries a ‘spirited’ woman named Cindy. Steve and Cindy have a daughter named Ruby (born on 27 March 2000).\n\nGarbage vocalist Shirley Manson splits up with her husband Eddie Farrell in 2001. The divorce is finalised in 2003.\n\n‘Beautiful Garbage’ (2001) (US no. 13, UK no. 6, AUS no. 1), released on 1 October, is the third and finest album by Garbage. In the U.S., the album appears on the Interscope label while it is issued by Mushroom for the rest of the world. Guitarist Duke Erikson says, “The only vision we had was that we wanted it to sound different.” Drummer Butch Vig suggests it is a “much simpler record than ‘Version 2.0’.” The first single from ‘Beautiful Garbage’ is the stunning ‘Androgyny’ (UK no. 24, AUS no. 21). An acoustic guitar tickles a synthesiser before an electric guitar cranks up for the chorus: “Boys in the girls’ room / Girls in the men’s room / You free your mind in your androgyny.” (‘Androgyny’ is a word that means ‘showing the characteristics of both genders.’) Equally slippery on a thematic level is ‘Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)’ (UK no. 22, AUS no. 7). This is ‘a hymn of praise to an underage truck-stop hooker’: “But she was young and dumb / She just turned 21…With your cherry lips / And golden curls / You could make grown men gasp / When you’d go walking past them / In your hot pants and high heels / They could not believe / That such a body was for real.” The salacious and subversive subject matter is often overlooked because the song also boasts such a catchy melody that lyrical analysis seems easily deferred for another day. A squelchy synthesiser in the verses flowers into thick slabs of guitar for the chorus. ‘Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)’ is loosely based on two works by JT LeRoy (the penname used by Laura Albert): the novel ‘Sara’ (2000) and the short story collection ‘The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things’ (2001). Vocalist Shirley Manson describes this song as “an adrenaline rush” and “probably the most celebratory song we’ve ever written.” ‘Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)’ began life under the working title of ‘Wonderjam’. Guitarist Steve Marker played a tuba and ran the resultant audio recording through the wah-wah pedal of a guitar. The video for ‘Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)’ contains a further surprise: vocalist Shirley Manson has short-cropped blonde hair! “I had a sort of mild mental breakdown and went blonde for around half an hour,” she says with some sarcastic exaggeration. “I was going through a divorce [from Eddie Farrell] and I ripped my hair out, basically shaved it.” ‘Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)’ is Garbage’s most commercially successful single in Australia of all time. Shirley Manson retains her blonde hair until Garbage’s next album, by which time she reverts to being a redhead. ‘Breaking Up The Girl’ (UK no. 27, AUS no. 19) plays mix and match with an upbeat pop melody and a darkly serious lyric. “It’s basically saying the world we’re living in is harsh and you’ve got to live in the moment,” says Shirley Manson. The last single lifted from ‘Beautiful Garbage’ is ‘Shut Your Mouth’ (UK no. 20, AUS no. 74) which is also perversely the opening track on the album. “Welcome we love you / We hate you / We love you,” is the song’s conflicted introduction. A processed guitar slouches after the vocals until Shirley Manson is given an artificial technological stammer as her voice is cut up to say “Sh-sh-sh-shut your mouth / Try not to panic / Just shut your mouth / If you can do it.” Elsewhere, ‘Beautiful Garbage’ also offers the propulsive ‘Til The Day I Die’ (“Holy Jesus / Holy rock ‘n’ roll”) which represents the group’s heavier side while the bruised break-up song ‘Cup Of Coffee’ and the feathery ‘So Like A Rose’ offer more plaintive, though still dark, alternatives. As on Garbage’s previous album, the bass work on ‘Beautiful Garbage’ is performed by Daniel Shulman. Additional drums are supplied by Matt Chamberlain. Released three weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York on 11 September 2001, ‘Beautiful Garbage’ ‘suffers from a lack of promotion, mixed reaction from the critics, and the failure of its lead single “Androgyny” to achieve high chart positions.’ Despite that, this ‘pop-influenced’ album is ‘more diverse than their first two studio albums [and is] musically more melodic and lyrically more direct.’ ‘Beautiful Garbage’ is the band’s finest album because it stands out as their most cohesive work. By this time, the Garbage formula – if such an inventive act can be said to have a formula – is bedded down and the conceptual pieces of the whole fit together rather than jostle one another. “I have a real soft spot for [‘Beautiful Garbage’] – I think we all do in the band, actually,” says Shirley Manson. During the recording of this album, Manson wrote an internet blog on the process, becoming one of the first high-profile rock stars to write a blog. ‘Beautiful Garbage’ is ‘an audacious piece of work, characterised by chiaroscuro light and shadow, hot colours and dark corners.’\n\nDuring the latter stages of the tour promoting ‘Beautiful Garbage’, the band struggles with health problems. Butch Vig is sidelined with, first, Hepatitis A, then, Bell’s Palsy. Matt Chamberlain substitutes for him on drums and Matt Walker does the same during the second bout of incapacitation. Vocalist Shirley Manson develops throat problems, so some shows are cancelled. She will eventually require corrective surgery.\n\n‘Special Collection’ is a Garbage EP issued by Sony Music Japan on 6 February 2002. The five tracks on this disc are: ‘Use Me’, ‘Enough Is Never Enough’, ‘Androgyny (Neptune’s Remix)’, ‘Vow (Live)’ and ‘Cherry Lips (DJ EJ’s Go-Go Jam)’.\n\nWhen Garbage reconvenes to begin work on their fourth album, the recording sessions are thwarted by ‘passive aggression.’ “There were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn’t agree on songs,” confirms drummer Butch Vig. The sessions are abandoned when vocalist Shirley Manson undergoes ‘surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003.’\n\nGarbage’s drummer Butch Vig marries his second wife, Beth Halper, in 2003. She is an executive at the artists & repertoire department of the film studio DreamWorks. Butch and Beth go on to have a daughter together, Bo Violet (born in 2006). Butch Vig and his family relocate from Madison, Wisconsin, to Los Angeles, California.\n\n‘Bleed Like Me’ (2005) (US no. 4, UK no. 4, AUS no. 4), the fourth Garbage album, is issued on 11 April. This disc appears on the Geffen label in the U.S.A. and on A&E Records for the rest of the world. For the first time, production of a Garbage album is co-credited to the band and an outside party. In this case, that outside party is John King of The Dust Brothers, an electronic dance outfit. Perhaps due to the trials experienced by Garbage in the lead up to this album’s release, a sense of fatigue hangs over the album. The first single, ‘Why Do You Love Me’ (US no. 94, UK no. 7, AUS no. 19), bursts out of the blocks with bruising guitars. Shirley Manson’s vocal warns, “I’m no Barbie doll / I’m not your baby girl / So I’ve done ugly things / and I have made mistakes / And I am not as pretty / As those girls in magazines.” This ignores the fact that she has been one of those ‘girls in magazines,’ not only as frontwoman of Garbage, but dating back to her days modelling for ‘Jackie’ magazine. The title track, ‘Bleed Like Me’, is a parade of ‘outsiders.’ One of the stories in the song seems very familiar from Shirley Manson’s teenage self-harming phase: “Doodle takes dad’s scissors to her skin/ And when she does, relief comes setting in.” It is matched to a slow, mournful tune. Perhaps due to its confronting themes, ‘Bleed Like Me’ fails to chart as a single. Subsequent singles from this album have relatively minor impact on the charts. ‘Sex Is Not The Enemy’ (UK no. 24) is a rocker that gets right in your face; it is a call to arms that pronounces “A revolution is the solution.” ‘Run Baby Run’ (AUS no. 47) alternates between soft and loud passages; sinewy guitar lines on the verses open out on the chorus. Beyond the singles, the swaggering ‘Bad Boyfriend’ is notable for a guest spot on the drums by Dave Grohl, the former Nirvana drummer who now spearheads The Foo Fighters. Justin Meldal-Johnson (who previously worked with Beck) plays bass on ‘Bleed Like Me’ and Matt Walker supplies additional drums. Although the sales of the album ‘Bleed Like Me’ make it ‘a chart peak’ for Garbage in the U.S.A., it is also viewed as ‘a record made on the ropes.’\n\nAfter living in Madison, Wisconsin, for twenty-five years, Garbage guitarist Steve Marker relocates with his family to Carbondale, Colorado, in 2005.\n\nGarbage’s concert tour to promote ‘Bleed Like Me’ is cancelled part way through when the band announce they have “somewhat overextended themselves.” Wrapping up their Australian dates on 1 October 2006, Garbage declares they are “on indefinite hiatus.”\n\nIn 2006, Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson begins to write and record material for a projected solo album. However, nothing eventuates from this would-be solo work.\n\nThe compilation album ‘Absolute Garbage’ (2007) (US no. 68, UK no. 11, AUS no. 18) is released on 23 July on Geffen and A&E Records. This album includes a new song, the soaring semi-ballad ‘Tell Me Where It Hurts’ (UK no. 50). This is fated to be Garbage’s last single to make it to the popular sales charts. Having its roots in remixes of singles, Garbage has frequently handed their recordings out for remixing. ‘Absolute Garbage’ includes a second disc consisting of such reworkings of their hits. Drummer Butch Vig states that, “’Absolute Garbage’ is the postscript to chapter one. Whatever we do next will definitely be chapter two.”\n\nGarbage vocalist Shirley Manson makes her acting debut in 2008 in the second and final season of ‘Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles’ on the Fox-TV cable network. Manson plays the part of Catherine Weaver, a liquid metal T-1001 Terminator who doubles as a technician. The television program is a spin-off from the popular series of movies dating back to ‘The Terminator’ (1984).\n\nIn May 2010 Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson marries her second husband, Billy Bush. A sound engineer, he has been working with Garbage since their second album in 1998. Although Shirley Manson has commuted between Edinburgh, Scotland, and the U.S.A. for most of her career with Garbage, she now settles in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2010 Smart Studios in Wisconsin closes its doors permanently. Founded in 1983, Smart Studios was arguably the birthplace of Garbage and certainly played a large role in the group’s recording history.\n\nGarbage’s drummer Butch Vig produces The Foo Fighters’ album ‘Wasting Light’ (2011) (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 1), released on 12 April.\n\nGarbage reconvenes for ‘Not Your Kind Of People’ (2012) (US no. 13, UK no. 10, AUS no. 8), released on 14 May. Starting with this album, Garbage’s new recordings appear on their own Stunvolume label. Since Smart Studios has closed down, most of this album is recorded in Los Angeles where both vocalist Shirley Manson and drummer Butch Vig now reside. ‘Not Your Kind Of People’ is, once again, produced by Garbage. None of the songs from this album make any impression on the singles chart. ‘Many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life,’ yet the album also grapples with current events and the external environment more than their previous works. The harsh and choppy ‘Blood For Poppies’ seems to carry implications of both the poppies used to remember the fallen from the First World War and the loss of lives resulting from the opium harvested from poppies in the drug trade. In ‘Battle In Me’, Shirley Manson’s vocal effortlessly rides atop a barrage of noise. ‘Big Bright World’ begins with pulsating electronics and then switches up to freewheeling rock. The deadpan march titled ‘Control’ has a sub-aquatic, doom-laden introduction and then smashes out into a more aggressive form as Manson wails, “I confess I’ve lost control.” Commenting on Garbage’s post-hit singles existence, Shirley Manson asserts, “I don’t think music should be measured by charts now. We want to change the way we look at ourselves because we got drained and battered and bruised by how much our record label obsessed over that s***.” The bass playing on ‘Not Your Kind Of People’ is provided by Justin Meldal-Johnson and Eric Avery (from Jane’s Addiction). Matt Chamberlain and Matt Walker along with Butch Vig play drums on this album.\n\nGarbage’s drummer Butch Vig takes time out for a side project called The Emperors Of Wyoming. The line-up of this act is: Phil Davis (vocals), Frank Anderson (multi-instrumentalist), his brother Pete Anderson (bass) and Butch Vig (drums and stuff). Phil Davis worked with Vig and Garbage guitarist Duke Erikson in Fire Town in their pre-Garbage days (i.e. 1987-1989). ‘The Emperors Of Wyoming’ (2012) is the self-titled album released by the new side project.\n\nLiberation Music issues ‘The Absolute Collection’ (2012) (AUS no. 88) on 2 November. This is a compilation album of Garbage’s past triumphs.\n\nOver the next few years Garbage releases a series of one-off singles for the retailers’ promotion Record Store Day. Each of these singles features a duet between Garbage and a different recording artist. ‘Because The Night’, released on 20 April 2013, is a duet with Screaming Females. This is a cover version of the 1978 Patti Smith song. The other two Garbage singles for Record Store Day are original compositions. ‘Girls Talk’, released on 19 April 2014, pairs Garbage with Brody Dalle, the Australian-born female singer-guitarist from The Distillers (1998-2006). Finally, ‘The Chemicals’, released on 18 April 2015, matches Garbage with Brian Aubert from Silversun Pickups.\n\n‘Sonic Highways’ (2014) (US no. 2, UK no. 2, AUS no. 1) by The Foo Fighters is an album produced by Garbage’s drummer, Butch Vig. It is issued on 10 November 2014 between the second and third of Garbage’s Record Store Day singles.\n\n“Definitely cinematic,” is how Garbage’s now pink-haired vocalist Shirley Manson describes ‘Strange Little Birds’ (2016) (US no. 14, UK no. 17, AUS no. 9). This album is released on 10 June. Production duties on this album are credited to Garbage, Billy Bush and Steve Marker. ‘Strange Little Birds’ was recorded in the basement of Garbage drummer Butch Vig and in Billy Bush’s Red Razor Studios in Los Angeles. The churning ‘Empty’ exemplifies the familiar ‘comfort of discomfort’ that is the band’s trademark. Shirley Manson’s siren-like vocal emanates from within a swirling maelstrom of snarling guitars. She fends off “The monsters and demons / I’ve wrestled with for eons” while noting “Every day, every hour of the night / You’re all I think about.” The ‘darkly catchy’ ‘Magnetized’ is more sinister and more electronic, though the buzzing verses fold out into an explosive chorus. ‘Empty’ and ‘Magnetized’ are the singles from ‘Strange Little Birds’, but neither of them makes it to the popular sales charts. Eric Avery and Justin Meldal-Johnson play bass on this album.\n\n‘5 Billion In Diamonds’ (2017), released in May, is the title of a new album from another side project for Garbage drummer Butch Vig. The act that records this album is also known as 5 Billion In Diamonds. The personnel are: Ebbott Lindberg, Helen White, Sandra Dedrick, David Schelzel (vocalists), Alex Lee (guitar), Sean Cook (bass), Butch Vig, Damon Reece (drums), James Grillo (DJ) and Andy Jenks (production).\n\n‘This is the Noise that Keeps me Awake’ (2017) is an autobiographical account of Garbage’s history which the band puts together with the assistance of Jason Cohen. The book’s title is a line from the 1998 Garbage song ‘Push It’. ‘This is the Noise that Keeps me Awake’ goes on sale on 4 July 2017 from Akashic Books.\n\nGarbage issues an original one-off single titled ‘No Horses’ on 14 July 2017.\n\n“We’ve always felt like outsiders,” said Garbage’s vocalist Shirley Manson. Is it possible to be both a band for ‘outsiders’ and appeal to ‘a lot of people’? After 2007 it seemed like the latter part of that equation was of diminished interest to Garbage. Yet, as older, more mature individuals, they were a part of society in a way that, as comparative youngsters, was not possible. They were no longer ‘outsiders’ as much as perhaps they liked to think. Yet through both their interest in the edgy possibilities of recording technology and Shirley Manson’s hard-won personal experience, Garbage spoke to the disenfranchised feelings festering without our impersonal modern lifestyle. They connected with the disconnected. ‘Garbage used the…studio as an instrument, drawing sounds from the most unusual sources.’ Garbage ‘didn’t fit, and their music spoke to others who didn’t fit. But they evolved. They shape-shifted. They mutated and survived.’\n\nSources:\n\n‘Hit’ lift-out, ‘The Herald Sun’ (Melbourne, Australia, newspaper) (23 August 2012) p. 39\n\nwikipedia.org as at 4 February 2013, 19 August 2018\n\nmadison.com – ‘Obituaries’ (23 August 2005) [for Butch Vig’s mother, Betty Vig]\n\nethnicelebs.com – ‘Butch Vig’ by ‘Manila’ (22 March 2016)\n\nencyclopedia.com ‘Garbage’, ‘Butch Vig’ by Joanna Rubiner (copyright 2004Gale)\n\n‘Absolute Garbage’ – Sleeve notes by Peter S.

Jerry Wexler, Vice-President of Atlantic Records, hears that Aretha Franklin has been released from her contract with Columbia Records. For six years, Columbia has tried to find the right approach for the singer, but ‘no one seemed to know how to produce her, or what kind of material she is best equipped to handle.’ By the end of 1966, Aretha Franklin even owes money to Columbia. Jerry Wexler thinks he has the answers for these problems. He signs Aretha Franklin to Atlantic Records and works with the mercurial vocalist as they mutually settle on a new direction for her career. ‘Within a year she is the most successful singer in the nation.’\n\nAretha Louise Franklin (25 March 1942-16 August 2018) is born at 406 Lucy Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.A. She is the daughter of Reverend Clarence LaVaughan ‘C.L.’ Franklin, a traveling preacher, and Barbara Franklin (nèe Siggers), who is described as ‘an accomplished pianist and vocalist.’ The baby girl is named after two of Reverend Franklin’s sisters, Aretha and Louise. Aretha is the third of four children born to Reverend Franklin and Barbara Franklin. Aretha’s elder sister is Erma Vernice Franklin (13 March 1938-7 September 2002). The second child is a son, Cecil Larone Franklin (31 March 1940-26 December 1989). Aretha’s younger sister is Carolyn Ann Franklin (13 May 1944-25 April 1988). Both Erma and Carolyn will also become singers. They frequently provide backing vocals on Aretha’s recordings. Additionally, in 1967 Erma Franklin is the first to record Bert Berns and Jerry Ragavoy’s composition ‘Piece Of My Heart’ (US no. 62). The song is subsequently recorded by many other artists but is perhaps most closely associated with the white blues-rock singer Janis Joplin who has a hit with ‘Piece Of My Heart’ (US no. 12) in 1968. Aretha’s brother, Cecil, will become a Reverend like their father.\n\nThe background of the Franklin family is more complicated than it first appears. Barbara Siggers – Aretha’s mother – is actually C.L. Franklin’s second wife. On 16 October 1934 he married Alene Gaines. There seems to be some doubt about whether the couple ever legally divorced but, in practical terms at least, their marriage was over by early 1936. Additionally, Barbara Siggers already had a child when she became C.L. Franklin’s second wife. Her son, Vaughan (1934-2002), was the product of an earlier relationship. C.L. Franklin adopted Vaughan when he married Barbara. Vaughan does not learn of his true origins until 1951. In a further complication, Reverend Franklin fathers a child out of wedlock in 1940 – the same year in which his second child by Barbara Siggers, their son Cecil, is born. The mother of the other child is Mildred Jennings, a member of Franklin’s New Bethel Baptist Church. Mildred is only 12 years old when she falls pregnant and gives birth to a daughter, Carl Ellen Kelley (nèe Jennings), shortly after turning 13. So in addition to her three siblings – Erma, Cecil and Carolyn – Aretha Franklin has two half siblings: Vaughan and Carl.\n\nWhen Aretha Franklin is 2 years old, she and her family move north from Tennessee to Buffalo, New York. Before Aretha’s fifth birthday, the family relocates yet again. This time they settle in Detroit, Michigan. Reverend C.L. Franklin becomes the Pastor at the New Bethel Baptist Church. Despite the new location, some things remain the same. Barbara Franklin wearies of her husband’s ‘philandering.’ The couple split up in 1948 – but never officially divorce. Barbara moves back to Buffalo, New York, taking her son, Vaughan, with her. She doesn’t abandon the other children and frequently visits them in Detroit, but the rest of the brood remains in the custody of their father. Their grandmother, Rachel, helps raise the kids.\n\nReverend C.L. Franklin continues his work as Pastor at the New Bethel Baptist Church. “I certainly enjoyed watching and listening to my dad [in church],” Aretha recalls. By the time she is 7, Aretha has learned to play piano by ear. Aretha says, “The first songs I sang in church were ‘Jesus Be A Fence Around Me’ and ‘I Am Sealed’. I was around 8 or 9. My dad asked me to sing that day. I didn’t want to sing in front of an audience. But he heard the possibilities…”\n\nIn 1952 Aretha Franklin’s mother, Barbara, dies as a result of a heart attack. Barbara Franklin (nèe Siggers) was 34 years old. It is claimed that Aretha ‘never accepted the loss of her mother.’\n\nReverend C.L. Franklin becomes ‘one of the most respected and prominent Ministers in the country.’ Over seventy albums of his sermons are issued on Chess Records. He is making ‘thousands of dollars.’ Accordingly, the family house is ‘a large one on a tree-lined street.’ Reverend Franklin’s burgeoning fame brings a number of well-known identities into his circle of acquaintances. Celebrities who meet with the Reverend include: blues singer Dinah Washington, gospel singer Clara Ward, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, gospel singer Reverend James Cleveland, civil rights advocate Dr Martin Luther King, rhythm and blues singer Jackie Wilson and gospel singer (later pop star) Sam Cooke. On one visit, Dinah Washington is accompanied by a male friend named Ted White. This is how Aretha Franklin first encounters Ted White – though he will not re-enter her life again until years later. Clara Ward has ‘a long-term romantic relationship’ with Reverend C.L. Franklin. She encourages and mentors Aretha as a singer and will later be described by Aretha as “my inspiration.” Mahalia Jackson helps Aretha’s grandmother Rachel raise the kids after the death of Aretha’s mother. “I remember singing around the house to records that were playing. All kinds of music. And the great James Cleveland was often in our house, and I grew up with his sound as well,” says Aretha Franklin. The handsome Sam Cooke also proves very interesting to the impressionable young girl.\n\nReverend C.L. Franklin’s growing notoriety also has a dark side. There are allegations that his church hosts orgies: all-male orgies, all-female orgies and mixed gender orgies. According to these tales, such bacchanals typically take place on a Saturday night with the participants then going to church to repent on Sunday.\n\n‘Her sexuality apparently awakened by the scene’ her father has going on, Aretha Franklin falls pregnant when she is 12 years old. The father is Donald Burk, ‘a boy she knows from school.’ Their son, Clarence, is born on 28 January 1955. Aretha names the baby after her father.\n\nFrom singing solos in her father’s church, Aretha Franklin goes on to tour with her father as a featured performer in his religious shows. Reverend C.L. Franklin appoints himself as his daughter’s manager and secures a recording contract for her.\n\nOver the course of her recording career, Aretha Franklin records many different styles of music. Her first love is gospel music and, in many ways, this remains the foundation of all her later work. Gospel is religious music, songs of Christian faith. What distinguishes gospel from the hymns sung in church is the added element of what is often referred to as ‘spirituals.’ African-American singers pick up on traits of African spirituals – rhythms, vocal interactions and distortions – handed down from their ancestors who were brought to the U.S. as slave labour generations earlier. From gospel, Aretha Franklin will go on to record songs in such styles as blues, jazz and rhythm and blues – all genres influenced to some degree by African-American culture. Rhythm and blues – perhaps the most danceable of these styles – is often little more than a code word to indicate the song is the work of an African-American performer. Yet Aretha Franklin also records (white) traditional pop. The music style that will become most closely associated with Aretha Franklin is soul music.\n\nSoul music can be roughly defined as a merger of rhythm and blues and gospel. The dance rhythms of uptempo soul songs are not far removed from rhythm and blues. The slower, smouldering soul songs import many of the characteristics of gospel, except they may be interpreted as being about romantic love rather than religious devotion. Typically, rhythm and blues is the province of Northern, urban blacks while soul more commonly belongs to Southern, rural blacks. The first soul record is generally thought to be 1961’s ‘Just Out Of Reach (Of My Two Open Arms)’ by Solomon Burke. Aretha Franklin begins her recording career in 1956, five years before that landmark. Doubtlessly, artists such as Ray Charles, James Brown and Sam Cooke were making recordings from the mid-1950s that were very close to what will later be codified as soul music. With her gospel background, Aretha Franklin is tailor-made for soul. She embodies the style so fully, she is soon acclaimed the Queen of Soul or Lady Soul, ‘a title she never needs to relinquish or even contest.’\n\nThe material Aretha Franklin records can be divided into three roughly equal parts: (1) cover versions of songs first recorded by other artists; (2) songs written by other composers for Aretha Franklin; and (3) songs written – or co-written – by Aretha Franklin. When it comes to cover versions, Franklin has strong views. “If a song’s about something I’ve experienced or that could’ve happened to me it’s good. But if it’s alien to me, I couldn’t lend anything to it. Because that’s what soul is about,” she says. “It’s just the emotion, the way it affects people…The song doesn’t matter.” Aretha’s attitude to original material is as follows: “I rarely write with other writers unless I have a real great respect for them. Otherwise, I choose to write alone.” Aretha Franklin is not often thought of as a songwriter. Given the diverse origins of her material, this narrative will only detail for her biggest commercial successes the authors of her songs – or the first artist to record the songs she covers. A few other extra details of other songs will be mentioned in addition along the way but certainly not the provenance of every song cited here.\n\nAretha Franklin’s first single, ‘Never Grow Old’, is released in 1956 on the JVB label. The song is written by Dolores Mary O’Riordan. ‘Never Grow Old’ is very much gospel music. It sounds like it has come straight out of church. The lyrics talk of being “In a land where we’ll never grow old.” In other words, it seems to be a song describing the Christian concept of heaven, a paradisiacal afterlife. Aretha Franklin’s ‘Never Grow Old’ is reissued by Checker Records in 1957, 1968 and 1973. (Checker is a label related to the larger Chess Records; the sermons of Reverend C.L. Franklin – Aretha’s father and manager – are issued by Chess.)\n\nAretha Franklin’s debut album, ‘Songs Of Faith’ (1956), is issued by JVB/Battle. This is an album of gospel music. The single ‘Never Grow Old’ is included on this album. Also present is Aretha’s version of ‘Precious Lord’ (a.k.a. ‘Take My Hand, Precious Lord’), a song first recorded in 1938 by The Selah Jubilee Singers. The cover of this album shows Aretha Franklin playing the piano while singing. In the recording studio (and, less often, on stage) Aretha often plays piano as well as singing. Like the single ‘Never Grow Old’, the album ‘Songs of Faith’ is later reissued by Checker Records. Actually this disc is reissued a number of times over the years by various labels, often with a new title. Later editions of this album will be titled ‘The Gospel Soul Of Aretha Franklin’, ‘Aretha’s Gospel’, ‘Precious Lord’, ‘You Grow Closer’, ‘Never Grow Old’ and ‘The First Album’.\n\nAs a 14 year old, Aretha Franklin goes on the road with her father. While Reverend C.L. Franklin preaches on this interstate evangelical tour, Aretha gains a reputation ‘as a remarkable soloist.’ At some points they travel with The Soul Stirrers, the gospel vocal group that (from 1950 to 1957) features Sam Cooke. Young Aretha has a crush on Cooke.\n\nAretha Franklin falls pregnant for the second time. The father is a young man named Edward Jordan. Their son, Edward, is born on 22 January 1957. The infant is named after his father. Aretha is still only 14 years old.\n\nBoth of Aretha Franklin’s sons – Clarence (born on 28 January 1955) and Edward (born on 22 January 1957) – use the Franklin surname. Aretha’s grandmother Rachel and Aretha’s elder sister Erma take turns raising the boys while Aretha pursues her singing career. Bearing in mind Aretha’s own age, the girl is also probably ill-equipped for the demands of motherhood.\n\nDue to her pregnancies and her absences while on tour, Aretha Franklin drops out of school. She is the only child in the Franklin family to fail to complete her education and Aretha feels bad about it. In later years, she is asked about the path not taken. Had she not become a professional singer, what kind of career may Aretha Franklin have chosen? “I guess I could’ve become a prima ballerina or a nurse,” she says.\n\n‘Precious Lord (Part 1)’, a song from Aretha Franklin’s debut album ‘Songs Of Faith’ (1956), is released as a single in 1959. Checker Records rereleases the single in 1960 and 1969.\n\nAretha Franklin turns 18 in 1960. She tells her father that she wants to record pop music like Sam Cooke. Aretha later acknowledges, “Sam Cooke had a huge influence on me.” Cooke had moved away from gospel in September 1957 when he released ‘You Send Me’ (US no. 1, UK no. 29), a pop single credited to the singer as a solo act. However, initially, his view is that Aretha Franklin’s style of singing ‘will never be palatable outside of a witness-bearing holiness shout in church.’\n\nAretha Franklin seeks to broaden her musical horizons by singing at The Flame Show Bar in Detroit. Subsequently, Franklin moves to New York City where she auditions for theatrical agent Jo King. “I paid my dues, I certainly did,” Aretha later asserts. Aretha Franklin makes a two song demo recording with Major Holly, a bass player for jazz pianist Teddy Wilson. These demos secure a new recording contract for Aretha Franklin with Columbia Records.\n\nAlthough it is Columbia that becomes the new record label for Aretha Franklin, it was not the only label that expressed interest in her. Sam Cooke, her friend and influence, tried to get RCA Records – the label that releases his recordings – to sign her up. Berry Gordy, of the fledgling Detroit label Tamla Records, also sought to put Aretha Franklin on his label. Tamla goes on to become part of the Motown label, Berry Gordy’s 1960s African-American pop music powerhouse. Ironically, Reverend C.L. Franklin, as Aretha’s manager, rejected Gordy’s offer as he felt the label was ‘not established enough yet.’ “Many of my friends were there at Motown,” Aretha later recalls. “The studio was only a few blocks from where my dad’s home was, where we lived…I saw The Supremes when they were still singing in little black skirts and white blouses.” A female vocal trio headed by Diana Ross, The Supremes go on to become perhaps Motown’s premier act in the 1960s. Allegedly, Aretha Franklin grows to jealously loathe Ross because of the latter’s commercial success.\n\nThe man who signs Aretha Franklin to Columbia Records is John Hammond. He describes the 18 year old as ‘an untutored genius’ and the best voice he has heard since the legendary female blues and jazz singer Billie Holiday. Hammond would know since he produced Billie Holiday’s recordings. He also produced and promoted blues singer Bessie Smith and swing and jazz guitarist Charlie Christian. Hammond will also soon ‘discover’ folk rock star Bob Dylan.\n\nAt Columbia, Aretha Franklin records ‘standards, vocal jazz, blues, doo wop and rhythm and blues.’ Aretha says, “It was more kind of ‘easy listening’ [at Columbia].” Apparently, this direction is the brainchild of Mitch Miller who is, at the time, the head of Columbia’s artists & repertoire department. Aretha takes dance lessons with choreographer Cholly Atkins. She is ‘no longer allowed to accompany herself on piano.’ Lumbered with large string sections, Aretha Franklin is groomed to be ‘a sophisticated crooner for the white masses.’ John Hammond noted her natural ability but the singer is placed in such artificial surrounds that it seems a poor fit.\n\nAretha Franklin is described as ‘shy’, ‘sensitive’ and ‘insecure.’ There are accounts of her ‘losing her bearings’ and being so emotional that she ‘misses [recording] sessions and runs away from [her new base in] New York.’ Yet, on other occasions, Aretha displays flashes of steely determination.\n\n‘Today I Sing The Blues’, released in September 1960, is Aretha Franklin’s first single for Columbia. It fails to register on the pop charts.\n\nAretha Franklin’s first live performance in New York takes place on 11 October 1960 when she sings a set of blues and pop standards at The Village Vanguard.\n\nThe first Aretha Franklin album released by Columbia is ‘Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo’ (1961). This is issued on 27 February. The album is produced by John Hammond. The material on this disc is described as rhythm and blues though it is a style from which Franklin will soon be weaned. This set includes the earlier single ‘Today I Sing The Blues’. ‘Won’t Be Long’ (US no. 76) from this album is the first Aretha Franklin single to reach the pop charts – albeit at a very low level. The disc’s third single, ‘Are You Sure’, misses the pop chart. (It should be noted that Aretha’s songs perform better on the rhythm and blues chart than the pop chart. ‘Today I Sing The Blues’ reaches no. 10 and ‘Won’t Be Long’ makes it to no. 7 in that forum.) In a show of independence, 18 year old Aretha Franklin also insists on recording on this album a cover version of ‘Over The Rainbow’. This song was originally recorded by 17 year old Judy Garland for her film ‘The Wizard Of Oz’ (1939).\n\nOn a visit back to her former hometown of Detroit, Aretha Franklin meets Ted White. Actually it is more correct to say she meets Ted White again. He had visited the Franklin home when Aretha was a child and he was a male friend of the blues singer Dinah Washington. Ted White is a colourful character. He is described as ‘testy’ and prone to ‘cursing.’ He is eleven years older than Aretha, but they share the same birthday – 25 March – even if it is in different years. Ted White has ‘a reputation as a ladies man.’ He starts dating Aretha Franklin even though he is also dating other women. He is said to be the one who introduces Aretha to ‘reefer [i.e. marijuana] and wine.’ Aretha’s father, Reverend C.L. Franklin, disapproves of his daughter’s new romantic interest but that does not dissuade Aretha.\n\nAretha Franklin and Ted White marry in 1961. The ceremony takes place between concert performances while Aretha is on tour. Ted White becomes her manager, ending Reverend C.L. Franklin’s tenure as Aretha’s manager. There are allegations that Ted was also a pimp and channelled the earnings from his stable of prostitutes into his new wife’s career. “As he’s my husband, I know I can trust him! I just worry about the singing,” says Aretha. Ted White will later be credited as co-author of some of Aretha Franklin’s original songs. Aretha and Ted go on to have a son, Ted White Jr. (born in January 1964). This is Aretha’s third child; she had two sons out of wedlock before the marriage. Using the professional name Teddy Richards, Aretha’s third son will, as an adult, play guitar in her backing band.\n\n‘The Electrifying Aretha Franklin’ (1962), released on 19 March, is the singer’s second album for Columbia. The working title for the album was the even more immodest ‘The Incomparable Aretha Franklin’. The album is co-produced by John Hammond and Richard Wess. ‘The Electrifying Aretha Franklin’ is home to the only top forty pop hit Aretha records while at Columbia. ‘Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody’ (US no. 37, AUS no. 30) is a song that was first recorded by Al Jolson in 1918 and was a U.S. no. 1 single in that year. Aretha offers up an assertive, swinging reading of the tune. It is a jaunty performance. Also released as a single from this album is ‘I Surrender Dear’ (US no. 87) backed with ‘Rough Lover’ (US no. 94). ‘The Electrifying Aretha Franklin’ is producer John Hammond’s last work with Aretha Franklin. He will later express regret that Columbia did not make the most of Franklin’s gospel background.\n\n‘The Tender, The Moving, The Swinging Aretha Franklin’ (1962) (US no. 69) is released on 13 August, only five months after the singer’s previous album. This is the first of three consecutive Aretha Franklin albums produced by Robert Mersey. Unlike John Hammond, Robert Mersey is black. He has production credits with (non-rock) pop singers such as Frank Sinatra and Rosemary Clooney. The singles lifted from this album are ‘Don’t Cry Baby’ (US no. 92) and ‘Just For A Thrill’ (US no. 111) b/w ‘ Try A Little Tenderness’ (US no. 100).\n\n‘Trouble In Mind’ (US no. 86) is a stand-alone Aretha Franklin single released later in 1962.\n\nColumbia Records, the home of Aretha Franklin’s recordings, issues the debut album by Broadway singer Barbra Streisand on 25 February 1963. Allegedly, Franklin loathes Streisand for the latter’s pop success. Just as Diana Ross will soon achieve pop music success on Motown and become the kind of black singer Franklin cannot be, Streisand (a white woman) embodies the kind of sophisticated adult pop success that Franklin is vainly aspiring towards in an attempt to please Columbia.\n\nThe 1963 Aretha Franklin single ‘Here’s Where I Came In (Here’s Where I Walk Out)’ (US no. 125) is another non-album single.\n\n‘Laughing On The Outside’ (1963), issued on 12 August, is another Aretha Franklin album that mixes jazz, rhythm and blues and something akin to soul. ‘Say It Isn’t So’ (US no. 113) from this album had earlier appeared as the flipside to ‘Here’s Where I Came In’. The other single from this album, ‘Skylark’, fails to make a mark on the pop chart.\n\nAretha Franklin closes out 1963 with the seasonal single ‘Kissin’ By the Mistletoe’ – but the Christmas spirit does not extend to making this a pop hit.\n\n‘Unforgettable: A Tribute To Dinah Washington’ (1964) is the Aretha Franklin album released on 18 February. Blues singer Dinah Washington (29 August 1924-14 December 1963) recently passed away after an overdose of sleeping pills. She had first met Aretha as a visitor to the home of Aretha’s father, Reverend C.L. Franklin. Dinah Washington was also a friend of Ted White, the man who is now Aretha Franklin’s husband and manager. Although perhaps best known as a blues singer, Dinah Washington also flirted with other musical genres such as jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel and traditional pop. This tribute album reflects that musical diversity. Aretha Franklin’s version of ‘Soulville’ (US no. 121) is issued as a single from this set. The song was co-written by Dinah Washington, Titus Turner, Morris Levy and Henry Glover. When released by Washington in 1963 it reached no. 92 on the U.S. pop chart.\n\n‘Runnin’ Out Of Fools’ (1964) (US no. 84), released on 16 November, is the next album by Aretha Franklin. Clyde Otis (a white man) produces both this set and Aretha’s next album. It is noted that, by 1964, Aretha Franklin is moving her musical direction towards ‘more pop music’ even if this effort is described as being a mix of soul and rhythm and blues. The title track, ‘Runnin’ Out Of Fools’ (US no. 57), is the single lifted from this disc. A version of ‘Mockingbird’ is also on this album.\n\n‘Winter Wonderland’ is another unsuccessful stab at a stand-alone Christmas hit single by Aretha Franklin. This non-charting single closes out her releases for 1964.\n\n‘Yeah!!!’ (1965) (US no. 101), issued on 10 May, is a rather odd album by Aretha Franklin. It may be mistaken for a live album, but ‘Yeah!!!’ is actually recorded at Columbia’s New York recording studio and the audience sounds are overdubbed onto the recording. There was no live audience present during this recording. ‘Yeah!!!’ is a jazz-oriented album and Aretha peers out at us over the rims of cool sunglasses on the cover.\n\nFor the rest of 1965 and into 1966 Aretha Franklin issues a series of singles. They are: [in 1965] ‘Can’t You Just See Me’ (US no. 96), ‘One Step Ahead’ (US no. 119), ‘(No No) I’m Losing You’ (US no. 114), ‘You Made Me Love You’ (US no. 109), [in 1966] ‘Tighten Up Your Tie, Button Up Your Jacket’, ‘Until You Were Gone’ and ‘Cry Like A Baby’ (US no. 113).\n\n‘Soul Sister’ (1966) (US no. 132) is released on 13 June. This album is produced by Bob Johnston. Most of the 1965-1966 clutch of Aretha Franklin singles are on this album – the only exceptions being ‘One Step Ahead’ and ‘Tighten Up Your Tie, Button Up Your Jacket’. ‘Soul Sister’ is a blend of jazz, soul and rhythm and blues. Despite the album’s title, the soul music on this and Aretha’s other Columbia recordings is fairly muted and watered down. Calling this album ‘Soul Sister’ is probably a subtle way of saying ‘black girl’ rather than anything more. On the album’s cover Aretha is attired in shimmering metallic lamè.\n\nIn November 1966 Aretha Franklin switches record labels from Columbia to Atlantic. During her time at Columbia, Aretha ‘never really broke out as a star.’ Her work on that label is ‘considerably tamer than what is to follow.’ “Columbia was a wonderful label for me,” Franklin contends. Columbia will release some further Aretha Franklin material from their vaults in subsequent times, but this is – essentially – the end of that label’s part in this story.\n\nJerry Wexler is the man who signs Aretha Franklin to Atlantic Records. He is ‘determined to bring out her most soulful, fiery traits.’\n\nSoul music is usually the product of rural blacks in Southern States of the U.S.A. It is earthier than rhythm and blues, less genteel than pop and instinctive rather than educated. Also, despite being closely identified with the African-American community, there are more white musicians involved with soul than rhythm and blues. The singers, the public faces of soul, are seemingly exclusively black, but the supporting cast is more racially integrated.\n\nAtlantic Records has enjoyed a profitable relationship (both financially and creatively) with Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee – the birthplace of Aretha Franklin. Atlantic Records artists like Sam And Dave have been loaned out to Stax. However, the relationship between the two labels has some tension in it. The association between the two labels will collapse in 1968. So, in 1967, when Aretha Franklin is to record her first album for Atlantic, Jerry Wexler – as producer of the album as well as record company boss – chooses Rick Hall’s Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, as the venue. It has the same Southern feel as Stax. Wexler tries to ensure a healthy mix of black and white personnel for the recording session. Unfortunately, some of the black musicians have to drop out at the last moment so there is a higher than expected number of white folks involved. The volatile Ted White, Aretha’s husband and manager, exchanges some racial insults with a white trumpet player. Ted White complains to Wexler about his wife having been brought down South to work with ‘rednecks.’ Only one track is completed before Ted and Aretha pack their bags and fly back to New York. A compromise is subsequently reached. For the rest of her tenure at Atlantic Aretha remains in New York with most of the musicians being flown in from Muscle Shoals to work with her.\n\nThe main musical personnel on Aretha Franklin’s first few Atlantic recordings are: Aretha Franklin (vocals, piano), Jimmy Johnson (guitar), Spooner Oldham (keyboards), Tommy Cogbill (bass) and Roger Hawkins (drums). They provide ‘a much grittier, soulful and rhythm and blues based accompaniment’ than their counterparts at Columbia.\n\nColumbia, Aretha Franklin’s previous record label, issues ‘Take It Like You Give It’ (1967). Production credit is shared amongst Bob Johnston, Clyde Otis, Robert Mersey and Bobby Scott. This supports the idea that the material on this disc is scraped together from offcuts of various recording sessions. The 1966 single ‘Tighten Up Your Tie, Button Up Your Jacket’, which was not previously available on an album, is included on this set. ‘Lee Cross’, a song penned by Aretha’s husband Ted White, is released as a (non-charting) single from this album.\n\nAretha Franklin’s first album for Atlantic is ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way That I Love You’ (1967) (US no. 2, UK no. 36). It is released on 10 March. The album is produced by Jerry Wexler. The first single from this disc is the title track, ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way That I Love You’ (US no. 9). This was the one song completed in Alabama before Aretha returned to New York. The author of ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ is Ronnie Shannon. A churchy organ is heard over a steady drumbeat. Aretha decries her subject, telling him “You’re no good / Heartbreaker / A liar and a cheat.” Horns punch through the arrangement as she admits, in the title, “I ain’t never loved a man / The way that I / Love you.” With this song ‘all the fire and passion of her voice is incredibly unleashed straightaway.’ ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ is not only creatively fulfilling; it is Aretha Franklin’s first top ten hit on the pop charts. “I never expected that song to be a hit,” Aretha confesses. When it is released as a single, ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ is backed by another song from this album, ‘Do Right Woman – Do Right Man’. This track is co-written by Dan Penn and Chips Moman. It is just as gospel-flavoured as ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’. The swaying tune holds the heart-tugging, righteous instructions, “Take me to heart and I’ll always love you / And nobody can make me do wrong / Take me for granted, leaving love unsure / Makes will power weak and temptation strong.” If these two songs smoulder, ‘Respect’ (US no. 1, UK no. 10, AUS no. 14) is, by contrast, a wildfire. The song was originally recorded in 1965 by Otis Redding. If Aretha Franklin is the Queen of Soul, then Otis Redding is the King of Soul. Redding also wrote ‘Respect’. In his hands it was a rough-edged demand for his romantic partner to accord him some consideration. There was also an implication that society needed to treat people of colour better. Those elements are still present in Aretha’s version but the inevitable gender flip makes it, in her rendition, also a song of women’s rights. It becomes ‘a landmark for the feminist movement.’ There are some adjustments made to ‘Respect’ beyond the gender switch in Franklin’s version. Spelling out ‘r-e-s-p-e-c-t’ is the idea of Aretha’s younger sister, Carolyn, who provides backing vocals on this recording together with their older sister, Erma. In the line “Take care, T.C.B.” the initials stand for ‘Taking Care of Business.’ This is followed by a ‘groovy’ backing vocal of “Sock-it-to-me” repeated over and over. Aretha explains, “Some of the girls were saying that to the fellas, like ‘sock it to me’ in this way or ‘sock it to me’ in that way. It’s not sexual. It was non-sexual, just a cliché line.” None of these lyrical touches need concern us though when ‘Respect’ boasts such a potent groove and winning horn chart that it is perfectly satisfying just on an instrumental level. Even Otis Redding, the author of ‘Respect’, bows down before Aretha Franklin’s powerhouse version made all the more amazing for being recorded live in the studio. ‘Respect’ is the first of two U.S. no. 1 singles for Aretha Franklin. It tops the chart from 5 June 1967 to 26 June 1967. “I was stunned when it went to no. 1 and it stayed no. 1 for a couple of weeks. It was the right song at the right time,” says Franklin. ‘Respect’ is Aretha Franklin’s ‘breakthrough’; it changes her ‘from a domestic star to an international one.’ ‘Respect’ is Aretha Franklin’s all-time best single, a heady concoction of social awareness, sexual urgency and an energetic combustion of soul music. ‘Dr Feelgood’ is co-written by Aretha Franklin and Ted White and blazes with desire: “Don’t send me no doctor / Fillin’ me up with all those pills / I got me a man named Dr Feelgood / He takes care of all my pains and ills.” Sick of interruptions to her lovin’, Aretha declares, “I’ll get up / Put on some clothes / Go out and help them find somebody for themselves if I can / Yes I will.” Musically, it imports gospel and soul motifs but puts them in service to more rock-oriented sexuality and power. “Ted and I have written quite a few songs,” Aretha notes. However Aretha co-writes ‘Save Me’ with her sister Carolyn and saxophonist King Curtis. The lyrics to this chugging rock song display a playful sense of humour: “Call in the caped crusader / Green Hornet, Kato too / I’m so much in trouble, I don’t know what to do.” Among her catalogue of albums, ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ is Aretha Franklin’s finest work. It is ‘the place where gospel music collides with rhythm and blues and rock ‘n’ roll [to] become soul.’ It ‘sounds like it had been building up inside of her for seven years.’\n\n‘Aretha Arrives’ (1967) (US no. 5) follows quickly on 4 August, only six months after ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’. Once again, Jerry Wexler acts as producer. Aretha Franklin’s first two albums for Atlantic are ‘cohesive works, free of filler, and their honesty and directness makes them standards by which blacks measure themselves.’ The single from ‘Aretha Arrives’ is ‘Baby I Love You’ (US no. 4, UK no. 39, AUS no. 51). This song is written by Ronnie Shannon, the author of ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’. ‘Baby I Love You’ is a soulful staccato with punchy horns making their presence felt towards the end. On this album, Aretha Franklin also records a cover version of ‘Satisfaction’ (UK no. 37), the 1965 signature tune by British rock band The Rolling Stones. To be fair, fellow soul titan Otis Redding recorded a version of ‘Satisfaction’ in 1965 and, if he had not, Aretha may not have seen the potential of this rock song to be recast by a soul music singer. Although ‘Aretha Arrives’ appears soon after Aretha’s previous album, the recording sessions were actually delayed because Aretha had shattered her elbow in a mishap on her Southern tour. She still did not have full mobility of her arm by the time the album was finished and so does not play piano on this disc.\n\nColumbia cashes in on Aretha Franklin’s new found commercial appeal by revisiting her work for that label. ‘Take A Look’ (1967) (US no. 173) contains only three previously unreleased songs. The title track, ‘Take A Look’ (US no. 56), is issued as a single. In Europe, the ‘Take A Look’ album is issued by CBS under the title ‘Soul, Soul, Soul’ (1967). Columbia also issues ‘Aretha’s Franklin’s Greatest Hits’ (1967) (US no. 94) and issues ‘Mockingbird’ (US no. 94) (from ‘Runnin’ Out Of Fools’ (1964)) as a single.\n\nAretha Franklin’s marriage to Ted White becomes more troubled. ‘Fans are outraged when Ted White roughs her up in public in 1967.’ Their union is ‘a contentious marriage that involves domestic violence.’\n\n‘Lady Soul’ (1968) (US no. 2, UK no. 25) is Aretha Franklin’s third album for Atlantic in less than a year. It is issued on 22 January. Jerry Wexler produces this album. The first single from ‘Lady Soul’ is ‘(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman’ (US no. 8, AUS no. 36). The song is co-written by Jerry Wexler, Carole King and Gerry Goffin. Wexler’s interest in African-American culture led him to the concept of a ‘natural man.’ He told Goffin and King he wanted a ‘natural woman’ song for Aretha Franklin. For this contribution he received a credit as co-author. Goffin and King are a married couple who have been writing hits for various pop acts in the 1960s. In ‘(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman’ a gentle piano-led gospel atmosphere is swooped by a string section as Aretha wearily intones “Looking out on the morning rain / I used to feel so uninspired / And when I knew I had to face another day / Lord, it made me feel so tired / Before the day I met you / Life was so unkind / You’re the key to my peace of mind / You make me feel like a natural woman.” ‘Chain Of Fools’ (US no. 2, UK no. 37, AUS no. 51) is written by Don Covay, another soul music performer in the mid-1960s. Covay wrote the song in his youth while he was singing gospel with his brothers and sisters. Producer Jerry Wexler asked Don Covay for a song that Otis Redding could sing. However, once he received the song, Wexler opted to place it with Aretha Franklin rather than Redding. There is a view amongst some pundits that ‘Chain Of Fools’ is a rewrite of ‘Pains Of Life’ by Reverend Elijah Fair & The Sensational Gladys Davis Trio, but this is arguable. Aretha Franklin’s recording of ‘Chain Of Fools’ gets a fat bass and a stammering backing vocal as Aretha channels ‘explosive anguish’ into the sentiments “For five long years / I thought you were my man / But I found out I’m just a link in your chain / You got me where you want me / I ain’t nothin’ but your fool / You treated me mean, you treated me cruel.” Aretha says in 1968, “Two of my favourite songs incidentally are ‘Rock-A-Bye’, which was on Columbia, and ‘Chain Of Fools’.” ‘(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You’ve Been Gone’ (US no. 5, UK no. 47, AUS no. 76) is co-written by Aretha Franklin and her husband/manager Ted White. “You left me in a real bad way,” Aretha accuses in this song. The ascending arrangement lends excitement to this track despite its sad lyric. Aretha pleads, “Ooh, take me back / Consider me please.” When it is released as a single, ‘(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You’ve Been Gone’ is backed by another song from ‘Lady Soul’, ‘Ain’t No Way’ (US no. 16). Carolyn Franklin, Aretha’s younger sister, is the author of ‘Ain’t No Way’. Noted rock guitarist Eric Clapton (of Cream) plays guitar on ‘Good To Me As I Am To You’ (written by Aretha Franklin and Ted White). ‘Lady Soul’ also includes cover versions of Curtis Mayfield’s ‘People Get Ready’ (originally recorded by his group, The Impressions, in 1965) and The Young Rascals’ ‘Groovin’’ (from 1967). ‘Lady Soul’ is an album of ‘funky pride and magisterial hurt.’ It ties with ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ as Aretha Franklin’s highest-charting album in the U.S. (both reach no. 2).\n\nContinuing the breakneck pace of her album releases, Aretha Franklin’s next album for Atlantic is released five months later. ‘Aretha Now’ (1968) (US no. 3, UK no. 6) is issued on 14 June. Jerry Wexler remains in the role of producer for this disc. The first single from ‘Aretha Now’ is ‘Think’ (US no. 7, UK no. 26, AUS no. 49), ‘a feminist anthem’ that Aretha Franklin co-writes with her husband, Ted White. In this punchy number, the piano is challenged by a brass section. ‘Think’ finds Aretha and her backing vocalists chorusing on the word “Freedom”. It’s a powerful performance. When released as a single, ‘Think’ is backed by Aretha’s take on the 1957 Sam Cooke song ‘You Send Me’ (US no. 56). This track is also included on ‘Aretha Now’. Aretha Franklin’s ‘I Say A Little Prayer’ (US no. 10, UK no. 4, AUS no. 8) is co-written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach. The duo wrote it for black pop singer Dionne Warwicke who had a hit with it in December 1967. (The Dionne Warwicke version reached no. 4 in the U.S. and no. 77 in Australia.) Aretha Franklin decided to record ‘I Say A Little Prayer’ after hearing her vocal backing group, The Sweet Inspirations, fooling around with the song. The Sweet Inspirations consist of Emily ‘Cissy’ Houston (nèe Drinkard), Myrna Smith, Estelle Brown and Sylvia Shemwell. Cissy Houston is actually Dionne Warwicke’s aunt. Cissy Houston’s daughter, Whitney Houston (9 August 1963-11 February 2012) will go on to be a pop star in her own right. Whitney Houston first meets Aretha in 1968 when Whitney is 5. Aretha is described as an ‘honorary aunt.’ Cissy Houston has been providing backing vocals to Aretha Franklin since at least ‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’ (1967). ‘I Say A Little Prayer’ lovingly details the minutia of a woman’s day. Supposedly, the intent was to sketch out the life of a woman concerned about her man serving in the Vietnam War – but the military aspect is not really detectable in the lyrics. Aretha Franklin gives the song a strong reading. The Reverend’s daughter perhaps enjoys the religious, as well as romantic, overtones of the words. Aretha also covers ‘See Saw’ (US no. 14, AUS no. 29), a song previously recorded in 1965 by Don Covay (the author of ‘Chain Of Fools’). When it is released as a single, Aretha’s version of ‘See Saw’ is backed by ‘My Song’ (US no. 31), a track not included on ‘Aretha Now’. By contrast, this album’s ‘I Can’t See Myself Leaving You’ (US no. 28) from this disc will be issued as a single – but not until 1969 and after the singer’s next album. ‘Aretha Now’ is the singer’s highest charting album in the U.K. “Music changes and I’m gonna change right along with it,” Aretha Franklin says in 1968.\n\n‘The House That Jack Built’ (US no. 6) is released as a single between ‘Think’ and ‘See Saw’. ‘I Say A Little Prayer’ is actually the flipside of ‘The House That Jack Built’. Yet, curiously, ‘The House That Jack Built’ is not included on ‘Aretha Now’. A sweetly rocking tune, ‘The House That Jack Built’ is built on love. However the singer admits “But I ain’t got Jack” since “I turned my back on Jack.” ‘The House That Jack Built’ is co-written by Bobby Lance and Fran Robbins. It had been released as a single by Thelma Jones earlier in 1968 but failed to reach the pop charts until Aretha Franklin’s rendition.\n\nFrom early 1967 to late 1968 Aretha Franklin has released four albums that reached the U.S. top ten (‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’, ‘Aretha Arrives’, ‘Lady Soul’ and ‘Aretha Now’) and nine U.S. top ten singles (‘I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You’, ‘Respect’, ‘Baby I Love You’, ‘(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman’, ‘Chain Of Fools’, ‘(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You’ve Been Gone’, ‘Think’, ‘The House That Jack Built’ and ‘I Say A Little Prayer’). Although Aretha will continue to have success in the future, it will never again be as frequent or as consistent as the achievements of this period.\n\nIn June 1968 Aretha Franklin is featured on the cover of ‘Time’ magazine. In the late 1960s she is ‘a symbol of black America itself.’ The article in ‘Time’ notes the ‘rocky details of her marriage to Ted White…her manager.’\n\nAretha Franklin performs a rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at the opening of the 1968 Democratic Party Convention. This gathering is held in Chicago, Illinois, from 26 August 1968 to 29 August 1968. Franklin is a registered Democrat voter though she points out that “Politics are not my arena, music is.”\n\n‘Aretha In Paris’ (1968) (US no. 13), released on 12 October, is Aretha Franklin’s first live recording. This album documents a concert in Paris, France, on 7 May 1968.\n\nBy 1968 Aretha Franklin’s drinking is ‘out of control.’ She is taken off a plane due to her inebriated state.\n\nColumbia continues to profit from Aretha Franklin’s commercial success after leaving that label. Columbia issues ‘Aretha Franklin’s Greatest Hits Volume II’ (1968) and rereleases the single ‘Soulville’ (US no. 83) from ‘Unforgettable: A Tribute To Dinah Washington’ (1964).\n\n‘Soul ‘69’ (1969) (US no. 15, UK no. 9) is released on 17 January. This Aretha Franklin album kicks off a turbulent year for the singer. ‘Soul ‘69’ is co-produced by Jerry Wexler and Tom Dowd. This album includes Aretha Franklin’s versions of the 1965 Smokey Robinson song ‘Tracks Of My Tears’ (US no. 71) and the 1967 Glen Campbell song ‘Gentle On My Mind’ (US no. 76).\n\nConfusingly, when Aretha Franklin’s takes on ‘Tracks Of My Tears’ and ‘Gentle On My Mind’ are released as singles in 1969 they are both B sides to other songs. ‘Tracks Of My Tears’ is the B side to ‘The Weight’ (US no. 19, AUS no. 38), a cover version of a song by The Band from 1968. It is notable for featuring a guitar part played by Duanne Allman of The Allman Brothers Band. Aretha’s rendition of ‘The Weight’ will appear on her next Atlantic album. ‘Gentle On My Mind’ is the B side to ‘I Can’t See Myself Leaving You’ (US no. 28), a track belatedly lifted from the previous year’s ‘Aretha Now’ (1968).\n\nOn 13 June 1969 Aretha Franklin headlines Soul Bowl ’69 at the Houston Astrodome in Texas. Billed as ‘the biggest soul music festival ever,’ the performers also include Ray Charles, The Reverend James Cleveland, Sam And Dave and The Staple Singers.\n\nOn 20 June, Columbia issues ‘Soft And Beautiful’ (1969). This is an album of previously unreleased Aretha Franklin material recorded under the supervision of producer Clyde Otis. The recording sessions took place between 9 July 1964 and 16 July 1964 when Aretha was 22 years old. ‘Jim’ is released as a single from this set but, like the parent album, it fails to register on the pop charts.\n\nOn 22 July 1969 Aretha Franklin is arrested on charges of drunk and disorderly conduct after creating a disturbance in a parking lot in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAretha Franklin’s marriage to Ted White ends in divorce in 1969. Since Ted White was not only Aretha’s husband but her manager as well, that side of her career must also be reassessed. Aretha’s brother, Cecil Franklin, takes over the job of being her manager.\n\n‘Aretha’s Gold’ (1969) (US no. 18) is Atlantic Records’ first compilation of Aretha Franklin’s hits on that label. It is the first album to include ‘The House That Jack Built’, Aretha’s stand-alone 1968 single. Columbia, Aretha’s previous label, issues a compilation set too, ‘Today I Sing The Blues’ (1969). The title track, ‘Today I Sing The Blues’ (US no. 101), is rereleased as a single"
