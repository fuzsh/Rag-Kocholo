        "text": "Marvin Gaye\n\nMarvin Gaye – circa 1972\n\n“Father, father / We don’t need to escalate / You see, war is not the answer / For only love can conquer hate” – ‘What’s Going On?’ (Al Cleveland, Marvin Gaye, Renaldo Benson)\n\nMarvin Gaye is dead. The news of the untimely demise of this African-American singer saddens and shocks his many fans throughout the world. Their dismay only deepens with each successive revelation. Marvin Gaye was shot to death. The gunman was a preacher. That holy man was the singer’s own father.\n\nWhat sort of life could have led to such a tragic exit?\n\nMarvin Gaye (2 April 1939-1 April 1984) is born Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. (without an ‘e’ at the end of his surname) at Freedman’s Hospital in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. He is the son of Marvin Gay, Sr. and Alberta Gay (nèe Cooper). Marvin Gay, Sr. is ‘a charismatic storefront preacher.’ The Reverend Gay works ‘as a part-time postal clerk and often not at all.’ Alberta Gay grew up in North Carolina as Alberta Cooper. She gave birth to her first child, Michael Cooper (1933-2010), when she was 20 years old. Troubled by this pre-marital birth, Alberta’s family sent her to live with a relative in Washington, D.C. In that city, she met Marvin Gay, Sr. and the pair married on 2 July 1936. Marvin and Alberta have four children together: Mable [sic] Jeanne Gay (born in 1937) – usually known as Jeanne Gay; Marvin Gay, Jr. (2 April 1939-1 April 1984); Frances ‘Frankie’ Gaye (1941-30 December 2001) – despite his forename being spelled as ‘Frances’ rather than ‘Francis’, Frankie is the family’s second son; and a second daughter, Zeola ‘Sweetsie’ Gaye (born in 1945) – named Zeola after a maternal aunt. Marvin’s two younger siblings will, in later years, modify their surnames to match that of their famous sibling. Marvin Gay, Sr. claims he cannot raise another man’s child, so Michael Cooper is sent to live with Alberta’s mother, Pearl. Marvin Gaye will have another half-brother: Antwaun Carey Gay (born in 1970). This child will be the result of an extra-marital affair conducted by Marvin’s father without the knowledge of Marvin’s mother. Alberta Gay carries ‘the burden of the family’s finances’ by working as ‘a domestic’; she cleans homes in Maryland and Virginia. Her husband is ‘resentful that he is not the breadwinner due to earning very little as a Pastor.’\n\nReverend Gay and his family belong to the House of God, an offshoot of the Pentecostal Church. It is described as ‘eccentric – a small Christian subculture which celebrates the Jewish high holy days’ because it is derived from Hebrew Pentecostalism. “Our church was a very spiritual church and we were a very chosen people. The body was small, but the spirit was intense and very evident to anyone who passed by or came in,” Marvin Gaye recalls. Although the church is ‘joyful,’ it is also ‘severe’ and ‘advocates strict conduct.’ There is ‘no drinking, no dancing, no nonsense.’ The Reverend Gay is ‘a scholarly but violent man’ who will ‘beat his children for minor infractions and frivolous behaviour.’\n\nWhen young Marvin, Jr. is born, his family resides at 1617 1st Street SW (now demolished) in the southwest waterfront neighbourhood of Washington, D.C. Their home is in a public housing project called the Fairfax apartments.\n\nMarvin Gay, Jr. begins to sing in his father’s church when the boy is 4 years old. He is accompanied by this father on piano. As time passes, young Marvin learns to play the church organ, sings in the church choir and becomes a featured soloist.\n\nMarvin Gay, Jr. attends Syphax Elementary School and then moves on to Randall Junior High School. He joins a glee club at the latter school as he continues to practice and improve as a singer.\n\nThe home life of Marvin Gay is a different story. He often rebels against his father’s instructions and pays ‘the price in corporal punishment.’ In the ‘nightmarish reality of his home life…his father beats him on an almost daily basis.’ Marvin is subjected to ‘brutal whippings’ from the time he is 7 years old right up through his teens. Marvin’s mother, Alberta, consoles him and encourages his singing. “I can remember as a child I always kept to myself and I always dug nature,” says Marvin. Whether it is denial or just wilful amnesia, the singer contends that, “God was very good to me as a child and I’m a very blessed individual.”\n\nIn 1953 or 1954 the Gay family relocates to Unit 12, 60th Street NE (now demolished) in Washington, D.C. This is in the East Capitol Dwellings housing project. In the new area, Marvin attends Spingham High School and then Cardozo High School. He becomes a member of the young orchestra at high school. While at Cardozo High, Marvin joins several doo wop groups. These include (1) The Dippers and (2) The D.C. Tones. Doo wop groups are multi-part vocal harmony groups. Their name is taken from the kind of nonsense syllables used by some of the group to suggest instrumental backing to their melodies. This is the first secular singing performances for Marvin Gay.\n\nThe relationship between Marvin Gay and his father deteriorates further during young Marvin’s teenage years. He is often kicked out of the house by his irate father.\n\nIn 1956 the 17 year old Marvin Gay drops out of high school before graduation. The young man joins the U.S. Air Force but his is ‘a short and troubled spell of military service.’ Marvin is disappointed with the menial tasks he is given. “They would say, ‘Okay, do KP,’ and I would say, ‘Excuse me, but I can’t do KP, I’ll do it tomorrow if that’s all right with you.’ And they’d say, ‘Hell no, it’s not all right with us. You do KP.’,” Marvin says. (KP is Kitchen Police or Kitchen Patrol, a task given to junior U.S. military personnel that involves such duties as peeling potatoes or washing dishes.) Marvin Gay fakes mental illness to avoid such distasteful jobs. Shortly after, in 1957 Marvin Gay is discharged from the Air Force. “My discharge was honourable,” the singer later claims, “although it plainly stated, ‘Marvin Gay cannot adjust to regimentation and authority.’” The Reverend Gay could have predicted that outcome.\n\nReturning to the Washington, D.C., area in 1957, Marvin Gay sings with a vocal group called The Rainbows. Other members of this changeable aggregation include future soul music artist Don Covay, Billy ‘Fat Boy’ Stewart, Reese Taylor and Chester Simmons. Although they are described as ‘at one time Washington’s premier vocal group,’ The Rainbows fall apart in 1957.\n\nIn 1957-1959 Marvin Gay is part of a new vocal group called The Marquees. Reese Taylor and Chester Simmons from The Rainbows are also in The Marquees. Rounding out the group is James Nolan. In practice, it is Reese Taylor who is usually the lead vocalist in The Marquees, though Marvin Gay occasionally gets a shot at being lead vocalist.\n\nThe Marquees are taken under the wing of rock ‘n’ roll pioneer Bo Diddley. As well as providing backing vocals for their new sponsor, The Marquees sign a recording contract thanks to Bo Diddley’s help. The Marquees release a single, ‘Wyatt Earp’, on the Okeh label in November 1957, but is commercially ‘ignored.’ The Marquees provide backing vocals for Bo Diddley’s ‘I’m Sorry’ on the Checker label; Chuck Berry’s ‘Almost Grown’ (US no. 32), released on 17 February 1959; and Etta James’ ‘Chained To My Rocking Chair’ in 1959. The latter two singles are issued by the Chess label.\n\nAround this time, Marvin Gay wins a talent contest singing ‘The Ten Commandments Of Love’, a 1958 song by a vocal group previously known as The Moonglows. On ‘the Ten Commandments Of Love’ the act was billed as Harvey And The Moonglows. ‘Harvey’ is Harvey Fuqua and, perhaps not coincidentally, he is one of the judges of the talent contest.\n\nOne of The Marquees, Chester Simmons, supplements his income by working as a chauffeur for Harvey Fuqua. The Moonglows is on the verge of disbanding. Harvey Fuqua has seen The Marquees perform and is impressed by them. Through Simmons, Harvey Fuqua makes an offer to take on the quartet as the new Moonglows. Marvin Gay and the other lads agree and the group moves to Chicago, Illinois, which will be their base for the next two years. With Harvey Fuqua acting as manager more than singer, The Moonglows release two singles on the Chess label: ‘Twelve Months Of The Year’ in 1959 and ‘Mama Loochie’ in 1960. Marvin Gay provides the vocal introduction and ending on the former single and the lead vocal on the latter single. The Moonglows go on tour to promote these singles in various U.S. cities including Detroit.\n\nIn 1960 Harvey Fuqua disbands The Moonglows. He moves to Detroit, Michigan, and takes Marvin Gay with him. “Detroit turned out to be heaven, but it also turned out to be hell,” Marvin Gaye will later say rather cryptically. Harvey Fuqua forms his own record labels, Harvey and Tri-Phi, and signs up Marvin Gay. He also lends Marvin out to the Anna label, an enterprise co-owned by Harvey Fuqua’s girlfriend, Gwen Gordy. Since multiple members of the Gordy clan will have roles in this narrative, let’s digress to provide some background information on them.\n\nBerry Gordy II and his wife, Bertha Ida Gordy (n èe Fuller), have eight children: a son named Fuller (1918-1991); Esther Gordy Edwards (1920-2011); Anna Ruby Gordy (25 January 1922-31 January 2014); Loucye Gordy Wakefield (1924-24 July 1965); George Gordy (1926-2011); Gwen Gordy (26 November 1927-8 November 1999); Berry Gordy III (born on 28 November 1929); and Robert Gordy (born in 1931). The sisters Anna Gordy and Gwen Gordy form their own record label, Anna (April 1959-March 1961), together with Roquel Billy Davis. No albums will be released on Anna, only singles. Their recordings are distributed by the Chess label. In 1961 all the acts signed to Anna will be transferred to the Motown label. Motown is owned by Anna and Gwen’s younger brother, Berry Gordy III.\n\nMotown will be one of the most successful record labels of the 1960s. The name is a contraction of ‘Motor Town’, a reference to Detroit’s role as a major manufacturer of automobiles. Berry Gordy III is a former boxer and record store owner who becomes a songwriter and then a record company owner. He starts out with the Tamla label in 1959; Motown follows in 1960 but it becomes the umbrella title for all of the company’s operations. Other smaller labels that form part of Motown in the 1960s are: Check-Mate Records (1961-1962), Miracle (1961), Gordy (1962-1982), Soul Records (1964-1978), V.I.P. Records (1964-1974), Tamla Motown (March 1965-1976, the non-U.S. outlet distributed by EMI) and Weed Records (1969). Motown is notable for being a label run by an African-American, featuring African-American recording artists, yet marketed as ‘the Sound of Young America’ (not Black America). In other words, Berry Gordy is quite willing to help part white teenagers from their pocket money, not just black teenagers. Motown’s product is a light blend of rhythm and blues and gospel. Controversially, Motown tends to work almost like an automobile production line. Singers are brought in, fitted out with songs by the label’s in-house songwriting and production teams and the musical backing is provided by a pool of regular musicians collectively known as The Funk Brothers. Motown’s headquarters, billed as ‘Hitsville, U.S.A.’, is a white bungalow at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit.\n\nBerry Gordy’s elder sister Gwen Gordy is dating Harvey Fuqua in 1960. Berry and Gwen’s older sister, Anna, is dating Marvin Gay. Anna and Marvin met in 1959 when Harvey And The New Moonglows played a show in Detroit. By 1960 Anna and Marvin are dating. She is 17 years older than him.\n\nIn December 1960 Marvin Gay introduces himself to Berry Gordy at Motown’s annual Christmas party. Gordy had seen The Moonglows when they were on tour and playing gigs in Detroit so he remembers Marvin. Additionally, Marvin is also dating Berry’s sister Anna so he is hardly a stranger. Harvey Fuqua sells Marvin Gay’s recording contract to Berry Gordy in 1961. Harvey Fuqua marries Gwen Gordy in 1961 and Fuqua becomes part of the Motown Empire too. Fuqua’s marriage to Gwen Gordy will last until 1968 when the couple will divorce.\n\nWhen Marvin Gay first starts working for Motown it is not as a recording artist in his own right. Instead, he plays drums in the recording studio and on tour for six months with another Motown act, The Miracles. This group features vocalist Smokey Robinson. But Marvin Gay has ambitions of his own.\n\nBefore his first recording in his own right, Marvin Gay adds an ‘e’ to his surname, becoming Marvin Gaye. The change is made for a number of reasons. The most commonly cited reason for the modification is that Marvin believes it looks ‘more professional.’ One of Marvin’s idols, vocalist Sam Cooke, had similarly amended his birth name of Cook. Additionally, changing his surname distances Marvin from his namesake father, Reverend Marvin Gay, with whom he is still at odds. Finally, the alteration is made to combat any rumours about his sexuality since ‘gay’ is also another word for homosexual.\n\nThe music recorded by Marvin Gaye over the course of his career can be divided into three distinct groups. The least common style is, perversely, the one Gaye seem to prefer. He fancies himself as a crooner in the manner of Frank Sinatra, a purveyor of pre-rock pop standards and jazz tunes. For most of the 1960s, Marvin Gaye records in the style of most Motown product: catchy, light pop laid over a dance-oriented rhythm and blues beat. If, at its worst, this could become formulaic, it was at least a good formula. In the 1970s, Marvin Gaye goes on to a more original, more personal type of music. In this new approach, the Motown sound is stretched and modified to take in characteristics of jazz, singer-songwriter confessionals and funky grooves. When this works it is astonishing; when it doesn’t work it is embarrassingly self-indulgent.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s songwriting is similarly split in three directions. His pop standards are, by definition, cover versions of songs recorded earlier by others. His Motown pop hits are sometimes co-written by Gaye and sometimes just handed to him as a performer only. His latter recordings are most often self-composed though other writers frequently lend some assistance. Given this diversity, it is not proposed to detail the authors of all Marvin Gaye’s recordings in this narrative. The writers of all his biggest hits will be acknowledged and many others will also be cited.\n\nAs a singer, Marvin Gaye is a ‘graceful tenor’ with a ‘three-octave vocal range.’ A multi-instrumentalist, Marvin Gaye most often just sings but when he does contribute as a musician, he usually plays keyboards and/or drums. During the 1960s – and even on some 1970s recordings – Marvin Gaye is backed by The Funk Brothers (1959-1972), the collective name for Motown’s in-house band: guitars – Robert White, Eddie Willis, Joe Messina, (from 1967) Dennis Coffey; keyboards – Joe Hunter (until 1964), Earl Van Dyke, (from 1964) Johnny Griffin; bass – Clarence Isabell, James Jamerson, (from 1967) Bob Babbitt; drums – Benny ‘Para Zita’ Benjamin, Richard ‘Pistol’ Allen, (from 1964) Uriel Jones; percussion – Jack Ashford, Eddie ‘Bongo’ Brown; vibraphone & marimba – Jack Brokensha; and trombone – Paul Riser. Most of The Funk Brothers are African-American but four of them are white: Joe Messina, Dennis Coffey, Bob Babbitt and Jack Brokensha.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s debut single, ‘Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide’, is released on 25 May 1961. This song is written and produced by Berry Gordy, the boss of Motown Records. ‘Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide’ mixes hints of blues and gospel music and features an organ and sighing backing vocals. It fails to make any mark on the pop charts.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s debut album, ‘The Soulful Moods Of Marvin Gaye’ (1961), is released on 8 June. This disc is issued on the Tamla label – as will be all Marvin Gaye’s recordings for the next twenty years. ‘The Soulful Moods Of Marvin Gaye’ is only the second full-length album from the Motown organisation; the first was ‘Hi…We’re The Miracles’ (1961). Marvin Gaye’s first album is produced by Berry Gordy. It includes the earlier single ‘Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide’. The music on this disc is described as jazz, traditional pop and rhythm and blues. Marvin Gaye wanted to do more adult music, not the typical Motown teenage dance grooves. Gaye wanted to sit on a stool and sing; he didn’t want to gyrate and perform. Gaye saw himself following in the style of someone like Nat ‘King’ Cole. The singer plays both drums and piano on this album. Marvin Gaye has his way on this album but, commercially, it does not fare well. Gaye will record more of his chosen ‘adult’ music in the future.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s first single for 1962, ‘Sandman’, is another example of his love for traditional pre-rock pop tunes. Written by Pat Ballard, this song was first recorded in 1954 by Vaughan Monroe & His Orchestra. In some versions, it is titled ‘Mr Sandman’. Rock fans will probably be most familiar with the version of ‘Mr Sandman’ (US no. 37) by the all-star trio of Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt which will be recorded in 1978 and included on Emmylou Harris’ album ‘Evangeline’ (1981). Marvin Gaye makes the most of the complex backing vocals and the whole thing is perched on a xylophone-like melody. ‘Sandman’ fails to chart for Gaye and is not included on his next album. ‘Sandman’ is a stand-alone single that only appears on some later compilation albums of Marvin Gaye’s recordings.\n\n‘Soldier’s Plea’, a Marvin Gaye single released on 8 May 1962, also falls on stony ground in commercial terms. This song has a trio of authors: William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson, George Gordy (one of Berry Gordy’s older brothers) and Andre Williams. ‘Soldier’s Plea’ is a message of faithfulness sent from a military serviceman to his girl back home. It has a fairly simple musical underpinning befitting its respectful tone with only some male backing vocals and horns for adornment.\n\nOn 11 July 1962, The Marvelettes – a Motown female vocal trio – release the single ‘Beechwood 4-5789’ (US no. 17). This hit single is co-written by three authors. Two of them – William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and George Gordy – had a hand in writing Marvin Gaye’s ‘Soldier’s Plea’. However, the third co-writer in this instance is none other than Marvin Gaye. According to one account, it is this first taste of commercial success that alters Marvin Gaye’s attitude to recording Motown’s trademark teen pop music. Equally possible is that Motown’s boss Berry Gordy has had enough of ‘indulging Marvin’s fantasy’ and notes that he has ‘failed to crack the adult market.’ It is time for Marvin Gaye to join Motown’s more commercial artists. Gaye’s established trait of chafing at authority and restrictions make him ill-suited for Motown’s production-line pop environment. Yet he is also ambitious, and that characteristic holds his rebellious nature in check.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s first (modest) hit single is ‘Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ (US no. 46), issued on 23 July 1962. This is written by the same team as ‘Beechwood 4-5789’: Marvin Gaye, William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and George Gordy. This is a bold and assertive slice of rhythm and blues. “I guess I’m just a stubborn kind of fellow / Got my mind made up to love you,” Marvin sings. Not even a flute solo (!) can undercut his authoritative performance. ‘Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ is rightly seen as ‘autobiography,’ though it is nice to see that Gaye can be self-deprecating about his pig-headed behaviour. The song has a ‘herky-jerky’ rhythm. The female backing vocals are provided by The Del-Phis: Gloria Williams, Rosalind Ashford, Annette Beard and Martha Reeves. Renamed by Berry Gordy as Martha And The Vandellas, this quartet will go on to start recording hits of their own from 1963. Martha Reeves started out working as a secretary for Motown. She recalls Marvin Gaye turning up for the recording session wearing a hat and dark glasses and smoking a cigar like some dark-skinned version of Frank Sinatra. However when he doffed these accoutrements and started to sing, she had a little crush on the handsome vocalist. ‘Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ is Marvin Gaye’s ‘breakthrough.’\n\nOn 16 October 1962 Motown Records starts a two month package tour featuring many of their recording artists. Marvin Gaye is part of this package. Also on this tour are The Miracles, Mary Wells, The Supremes and Stevie Wonder. The tour starts in Washington, D.C., and winds up with a four-night engagement at the Apollo Theater in New York City.\n\nMarvin Gaye releases another single on 19 December 1962, a song called ‘Hitch Hike’ (US no. 30). This track is co-written by Marvin Gaye, William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and Clarence Paul. ‘Hitch Hike’ features a call-and-response vocal exchange between Marvin Gaye and The Del-Phis (soon to become Martha And The Vandellas). In terms of the music, ‘Hitch Hike’ is more piano-based than has been customary for Marvin Gaye. ‘Hitch Hike’ will gain further notoriety when a cover version of the song is recorded by British rock band The Rolling Stones for their third album, ‘Out Of Our Heads’ (1965).\n\nMarvin Gaye’s second album, ‘That Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ (1963), is released on 31 January. This album is produced by William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. In contrast to his debut album, Gaye’s second long-playing disc is firmly in the style of Motown’s hit machine. The music here is rhythm and blues, rock ‘n’ roll, blues and soul. The earlier singles ‘Soldier’s Plea’, ‘Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ and ‘Hitch Hike’ are all present on this disc. Another song from this album, ‘Pride And Joy’ (US no. 10), released as a single on 18 April, becomes Marvin Gaye’s first top ten hit. The authors of ‘Pride And Joy’ are Marvin Gaye, William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and Norman Whitfield. The song has a romping, piano-based melody augmented by horns and sing-along backing vocals. ‘Pride And Joy’ is a tribute to Marvin Gaye’s girlfriend Anna Gordy, the elder sister of Motown’s boss, Berry Gordy. Marvin states, “When I composed ‘Pride And Joy’, I was head over heels in love with Anna. I just wrote what I felt about her, and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy.” The version of ‘Pride And Joy’ on this album is more jazz-oriented than the gospel flavoured version that will later be issued as a single. Aside from the singles, the most notable song on ‘That Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ is ‘Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)’. Over the years, this song will grow in stature to become one of Marvin Gaye’s better known songs. ‘Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)’ is co-written by Marvin Gaye, Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. Over fanfares of horns, in the lyrics the singer asks of a girl apparently besotted with him, “You had a romance / Did you break it by chance over me? / If it’s so I’d like for you to know that I’m not worth it you see / Oh, I’m the type of boy who is always on the road / Wherever I lay my hat / That’s my home.” Although Marvin Gaye does not release it is as a single, a slower, more yearning 1983 cover version of ‘Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)’ (US no. 70, UK no. 1, AUS no. 9) will become a hit for British singer Paul Young. Backing vocals on ‘That Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ are divided amongst The Love Tones (‘Soldier’s Plea’), The Del-Phis/Martha And The Vandellas (‘Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’, ‘Hitch Hike’, ‘Pride And Joy’, ‘Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)’) and The Andantes (‘Taking My Time’ – a song co-written by William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and George Gordy).\n\nIt is said that ‘after success,’ Marvin Gaye moves his parents and siblings into the black middle class section of Washington, D.C., rather than leave them in the housing projects. Since ‘Pride And Joy’ is his first top ten hit, the move probably takes place around this time.\n\nIn June 1963 Marvin Gaye marries his girlfriend, Anna Gordy. She is 17 years older than Marvin and is the elder sister of Motown’s head, Berry Gordy. Marvin and Anna have one child, Marvin Gaye III (born on 17 November 1965). Although Motown publicity initially claims the child is naturally conceived, the boy is adopted (on 17 November 1966) rather than being the biological offspring of Marvin and Anna. Though it is kept quiet for many years, Marvin III is actually the child of Denise Gordy, the niece of Anna Gordy.\n\n‘Marvin Gaye Recorded Live On Stage’ (1963), released on 9 September, is the singer’s first concert recording. It documents a 1963 show at the Regal Theater in Chicago.\n\n‘Can I Get A Witness’ (US no. 22) is a one-off single by Marvin Gaye released on 20 September 1963. This song is written by Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland (Eddie’s brother). This trio is best known for their work with Motown’s premier act, The Supremes. ‘Can I Get A Witness’ is a ‘rough-and-tumble gospel-blues track’ that seems to equate the church and the law court. In the church, parishioners are asked to ‘bear witness’ to the works of the Lord while in a law court, a ‘witness’ is called upon to present their version of events. The song manages to jumble and bleed the two as Marvin Gaye testifies, “I love too hard my friends sometimes say / But I believe a woman should be loved that way.” ‘Can I Get A Witness’ will be covered by The Rolling Stones on their debut album, ‘The Rolling Stones’ (1964). British female singer Sam Brown will have a hit with a cover version of ‘Can I Get A Witness’ (UK no. 15, AUS no. 17) recorded in 1988 and released in 1989. The B side of the Marvin Gaye single is the William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson composition ‘I’m Crazy ‘Bout My Baby’ (US no. 77). This is a snappy pop song with a saxophone solo. The backing vocals and lively hand claps almost threaten to overtake Marvin Gaye’s lead vocal on this song.\n\nMarvin Gaye takes part in another pair of Motown Revue concerts on 16-17 November 1963.\n\nThe next Marvin Gaye single, ‘You’re A Wonderful One’ (US no. 15), is released on 20 February 1964. Like ‘Can I Get A Witness’, this single is written by the team of Holland, Dozier and Holland. ‘You’re A Wonderful One’ has a nagging guitar line, a punchy horn part and loved-up lyrics.\n\n‘Greatest Hits’ (1964) (US no. 72) is the first compilation album of Marvin Gaye’s recordings. Earlier one-off singles ‘Sandman’, ‘Can I Get A Witness’, ‘I’m Crazy ‘Bout My Baby’ and ‘You’re A Wonderful One’ all make their first appearances on a long-playing disc on this ‘Greatest Hits’ album.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s ‘When I’m Alone I Cry’ (1964), released on 1 April, suggests that he hasn’t yet abandoned his hopes of singing adult pop rather than teen fodder. Co-produced by William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and Clarence Paul, this is a compendium of cover versions of jazz and pop standards (e.g. ‘I’ve Grown Accustomed To Her Face’). However, Marvin Gaye’s ‘desire to be a crooner of lush romantic ballads runs in direct opposition to Motown’s all-important emphasis on chart success.’\n\n‘Together’ (1964) (US no. 42), issued on 15 April, is an album of duets by Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells. Like Marvin Gaye’s solo album released two weeks prior to this album, ‘Together’ is co-produced by William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and Clarence Paul. Most of Motown’s recording acts are vocal groups. Mary Wells has been recording as a solo performer for Motown since 1960. Shortly after this album, her career will reach its peak with ‘My Guy’ (US no. 1), a song that tops the singles chart on 16 May 1964. Solo male artists are also in short supply at Motown at this point in history. Aside from Marvin Gaye, only Stevie Wonder comes to mind. When ‘Together’ is released, the latter is only 13 years old and has only just dropped the prefix from his billing as ‘Little Stevie Wonder.’ Given this information, if Motown wants an album of duets, Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells are the logical choices for the project. ‘Together’ spawns two hit songs. “Once upon a time / I almost lost my mind / I was lonely, so lonely,” runs the lyric in ‘Once Upon A Time’ (US no. 19, UK no. 50). But, “Now everything is oh so cozy.” This song has a supper club ambiance and a tinkling electric piano solo. Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells prove a good vocal match. This song is co-written by Barney Ales, Dave Hamilton, Clarence Paul and William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. The same team – minus Dave Hamilton – pens ‘What’s The Matter With You Baby’ (US no. 17). Two lovers at cross purposes – perhaps due to his infidelity? – try to make up in this song. This storyline is backed by horns and a tripping guitar line. The parent album also includes versions of songs like ‘I Love You For Sentimental Reasons’. This was first recorded in 1945 by Deek Brown & His Brown Dots but Nat ‘King’ Cole took it to no. 1 on the U.S. charts in 1946. Although Mary Wells is Marvin Gaye’s first partner in a duet, she will not be the last. Motown seems to like the idea of pairing ‘the golden boy of Hitsville, U.S.A.’ with a succession of leading ladies.\n\n‘Try It Baby’ (US no. 15) is a Marvin Gaye single released on 21 May 1964. This song is written by Berry Gordy. “You’ll see / That nobody loves you but me,” sings Marvin Gaye in the lyrics for this song. The musical accompaniment is smoothly syncopated and there is a muted brass solo. The backing vocals on ‘Try It Baby’ are provided by The Temptations, an all-male vocal group that also records for Motown.\n\nMartha And The Vandellas, Marvin Gaye’s former backing vocalists, release their signature hit ‘Dancing In The Street’ (US no. 2, UK no. 4) on 31 July 1964. It is co-written by Marvin Gaye, William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter. ‘Dancing In The Street’ will attract a number of cover versions. In 1966 The Mamas And The Papas will also have a hit with ‘Dancing In The Street’ (US no. 73). More successful will be the 1985 duet version of ‘Dancing In The Street’ (UK no. 1, AUS no. 1) recorded by Mick Jagger (of The Rolling Stones) and David Bowie.\n\nOn 2 September 1964, Marvin Gaye releases the single ‘Baby Don’t You Do It’ (US no. 27). This song is written by Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland. ‘Baby Don’t You Do It’ has a rumbling, primal beat and an urgent vocal from Marvin Gaye.\n\nNew York disc jockey Murray the K (Murray Kaufman) curates a ten day ‘Rock ‘N’ Roll Extravaganza’ at the Fox Theater in Brooklyn, New York that winds up on 13 September 1964. Marvin Gaye is one of the acts involved in this project. Other Motown artists such as The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha And The Vandellas and TheTemptations are also participants. Other performers beyond the Motown crew also take part in these shows.\n\nReleased on 30 September 1964 is Marvin Gaye’s duet with Kim Weston, ‘What Good Am I Without You’ (US no. 61). Mary Wells, Gaye’s previous partner in duets, left Motown earlier in 1964 so it is necessary for him to work with a different female singer. ‘What Good Am I Without You’ is co-written by Alphonso Higdon and William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. This song has brassy instrumentation and Marvin and Kim harmonise on “whoa-oh” vocals.\n\nMarvin Gaye shows he hasn’t completely forgotten the adult market when he releases ‘Hello Broadway’ (1964) on 12 November. This album is an assemblage of show tunes such as ‘Hello Dolly’. The disc is co-produced by Hal Davis and Marc Gordon.\n\n‘How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)’ (US no. 6, UK no. 49) is a Marvin Gaye single issued on 4 November 1964. Written by Holland, Dozier and Holland, the relaxed, finger-snapping melody of this song makes it both very popular and timeless. White singer-songwriter James Taylor will also have a hit with his 1975 cover version of ‘How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)’ (US no. 5). The Marvin Gaye rendition has backing vocals by The Andantes (1958-1975). This trio of female singers provided backing vocals on ‘Taking My Time’ from Gaye’s album ‘That Stubborn Kind Of Fellow’ (1963). Now that Gaye’s earlier back-up singers Martha And The Vandellas have graduated to become hit-makers in their own right, The Andantes fill that void. The members of The Andantes are: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, Emily Phillips (1958-1961), Lovain Demps (1961-1972) and Ullanda McCullough (1972-1975).\n\nThe album ‘How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You’ (1965) (US no. 128) is released in January. This Marvin Gaye album is mainly produced by the team of Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland and includes the 1964 hit songs they wrote for Gaye: ‘You’re A Wonderful One’, ‘Baby Don’t You Do It’ and ‘How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)’. Also present is the 1964 hit ‘Try It Baby’, a song written and produced by Berry Gordy.\n\nOn 26 February 1965 Marvin Gaye releases a new single titled ‘I’ll Be Doggone’ (US no. 8). This is a sunny, uptempo song that verges on being irresistible. ‘I’ll Be Doggone’ is co-written by Smokey Robinson, the leader of the Motown recording act called The Miracles. His co-authors are fellow members of The Miracles, vocalist Warren ‘Pete’ Moore and guitarist Marv Tarplin. Vocal backing is provided by The Miracles (Smokey Robinson, Claudette Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White and Bobby Rogers) and The Andantes (Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow and Lovain Demps) while the Miracles’ Marv Tarplin adds guitar.\n\n‘The T.A.M.I. Show’ (1964) is a popular rock music documentary. T.A.M.I. is an acronym for Teenage Music Awards International. Under the title of ‘Teenage Command Performance’ it opens in London on 19 April 1965. Marvin Gaye is one of the performers on the T.A.M.I. show along with fellow Motown acts The Four Tops, The Supremes and The Miracles and such non-Motown stars as James Brown, The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys.\n\nThe stand-alone Marvin Gaye single ‘Pretty Little Baby’ (US no. 25) is released on 18 June 1965. This song is co-written by Marvin Gaye, David Hamilton and the record’s producer, Clarence Paul. The lyrics have the song’s protagonist appealing to his woman not to leave him. The odd musical accompaniment sounds almost Middle Eastern.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s next single, ‘Ain’t That Peculiar’ (US no. 8) comes out on 14 September 1965. Like ‘I’ll Be Doggone’, this another composition from members of fellow Motown act The Miracles. In this case, the songwriters are Smokey Robinson, Warren ‘Pete’ Moore, Bobby Rogers and Marv Tarplin. ‘Ain’t That Peculiar’ has a fairly standard Motown sound though it is coolly entrancing and the downward chord progression is engaging. The lyrics chart ‘the torment of a painful relationship.’ Backing vocals are supplied by The Andantes (Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow and Lovain Demps). Marv Tarplin plays guitar and Uriel Jones is on drums. ‘I’ll Be Doggone’ and ‘Ain’t That Peculiar’ are considered to be ‘two of Smokey [Robinson]’s most compelling uptempo productions.’\n\n‘A Tribute To The Great Nat “King” Cole’ (1965) is a Marvin Gaye album released on 1 November. This album is co-produced by Hal Davis, Marc Gordon and Harvey Fuqua. Nat ‘King’ Cole was one of the role models for Marvin Gaye’s brand of adult pop, the kind of sophisticated sound that doesn’t fit in with Motown’s teenage strictures. Here, Gaye covers such well known Cole songs as ‘Nature Boy’ (from 1948), ‘Mona Lisa’ (from 1950) and ‘Unforgettable’ (from 1951). Marvin Gaye is prompted to make this album by Nat ‘King’ Cole falling seriously ill. Cole will die on 15 February 1966 as a result of complications following surgery for lung cancer. At the time of his death, Nat ‘King’ Cole will be 46.\n\n‘One More Heartache’ (US no. 29) is a Marvin Gaye single released on 31 January 1966. This is another Smokey Robinson production that Robinson co-writes with fellow members of The Miracles Warren ‘Pete’ Moore, Bobby Rogers, Marv Tarplin and Ronnie White. While the lyrics ruminate about the theme of how much a man can bear, the music is an iridescent groove with a saxophone solo.\n\nSmokey Robinson is also responsible for Marvin Gaye’s next single, ‘Take This Heart Of Mine’ (US no. 44), which is released on 5 May 1966. ‘Take This Heart Of Mine’ is co-written by Smokey Robinson, Warren ‘Pete’ Moore and Marv Tarplin. This song pushes Marvin Gaye’s vocals towards the top of their range (Smokey Robinson’s own voice is usually a light falsetto). It’s a very classy, very 1960s number with a strong horn section.\n\n‘The Moods Of Marvin Gaye’ (1966) (US no. 118) is released on 23 May. Production duties on this disc are divided between Smokey Robinson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Clarence Paul. This reflects the patchwork nature of the way this disc is put together. Smokey Robinson’s contributions include the earlier singles ‘I’ll Be Doggone’, ‘Ain’t That Peculiar’ (both from 1965), “One More Heartache’ and ‘Take This Heart Of Mine’. Holland-Dozier-Holland writes Marvin Gaye’s next single, ‘Little Darling (I Need You)’ (US no. 47, UK no. 50). This is issued as a single on 26 July 1966. A bouncy and melodic tune that is heavy on percussion and strident back-up vocals, ‘Little Darling (I Need You)’ is one of the better offerings from the Holland-Dozier-Holland songbook. In 1977 white rock band The Doobie Brothers will have a hit with a cover version of ‘Little Darling (I Need You)’ (US no. 48). Another song from the same songwriting team, ‘Your Unchanging Love’, will be released as a single months later. However, since there are a couple of other singles in between, more details on ‘Your Unchanging Love’ will be given later. ‘The Moods Of Marvin Gaye’ is an album of two main parts, the Smokey Robinson part and the Holland-Dozier-Holland part, which are stitched together. It is noted that Marvin Gaye is ‘still uncomfortable with performing strictly rhythm and blues’ songs. The singer had begun work on another album of pop and jazz standards around this time but the ‘sessions were unsuccessful.’ ‘The Moods Of Marvin Gaye’ was formulated instead. The album’s plan is to establish the singer as ‘a strong albums-oriented artist, as well as a hit-maker.’ The optimistic goal is to make Gaye ‘a crossover teen idol’ who can also satisfy more adult audiences.\n\nKim Weston is probably the least famous of Marvin Gaye’s duet partners. Her most famous solo hit was perhaps ‘Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)’ (US no. 50) from October 1965. Ironically, her second duet with Marvin Gaye, ‘It Takes Two’ (US no. 14, UK no. 16) – which is released as a single on 12 May 1966 – is probably the best remembered of all Gaye’s vocal duets. ‘It Takes Two’ is co-written by Sylvia Moy and William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. It is a fun, upbeat tune that sees the vocalists swapping couplets on how great life is with a loving companion by your side. It becomes a popular choice for other singers wishing to record a duet. The most famous cover version of ‘It Takes Two’ (UK no. 5) may be the 1991 interpretation by Rod Stewart and Tina Turner.’\n\n‘Take Two’ (1966), released on 25 August, is an album of duets by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston. This disc is co-produced by Harvey Fuqua and William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. It includes the 1964 Gaye and Weston hit duet ‘What Good Am I Without You’ as well as ‘It Takes Two’.\n\nIn 1967 Marvin Gaye moves on to his third singing partner in duets. His ‘greatest duets are [those he records] with Tammi Terrell.’ With that in mind, it seems appropriate to digress and provide some background information about this woman.\n\nTammi Terrell (29 April 1945-16 March 1970) is born Thomasina Winifred Montgomery. She is nicknamed ‘Tommie’ but this is later modified to ‘Tammi’. When she is 11 years old, Tammi Montgomery is sexually assaulted by three boys. The trio are all arrested and charged with rape. Tammi Montgomery begins to have migraine headaches when she is 12 years old. Her recording debut is the 1961 single ‘If You See Bill’ on the Wand label. This is credited to Tammi Montgomery. A second single, ‘Voice Of Experience’, is released by Wand in 1962. Subsequently, Tammi Montgomery meets rhythm and blues star James Brown and is signed to his Try Me label. At this new home, she releases her first charting single, ‘I Cried’ (US no. 99), in 1963. Tammi Montgomery becomes romantically involved with James Brown but this soon turns into a ‘sexually abusive relationship’ in which she is regularly beaten up. Tammi splits up with Brown and leaves his record label. In 1964 she records a duet, ‘If I Would Marry You’, with Jimmy Radcliffe for the Checker label. Tammi Montgomery retires in disillusionment from the music business in 1964. She begins a pre-med course at the University of Pennsylvania with the idea of becoming a doctor. Tammi can’t quite leave music behind though. When soul singer Jerry Butler offers her a gig as a backing vocalist, she accepts. It is while she is singing back-up for Butler that Tammi Montgomery is spotted by Motown Records boss Berry Gordy. Abandoning her medical studies, Tammi signs a recording contract with Motown on 29 April 1965, her 20th birthday. Berry Gordy feels that Tammi Montgomery is too long a name for popular success and rechristens his latest signing Tammi Terrell. The 1965 Motown single ‘I Can’t Believe You Love Me’ (US no. 72) is the first to be credited to Tammi Terrell. This is followed by two more singles in 1966, ‘Come On And See Me’ (US no. 80) and ‘What A Good Man He Is’. When she goes on a concert tour with Motown’s all-male vocal group The Temptations, Tammi Terrell becomes romantically involved with David Ruffin of The Temptations. Ruffin proposes to her in 1966 – but then Tammi discovers Ruffin is already married with three children! Naturally, their relationship ends in 1967. In a parting shot, Ruffin hits Terrell in the head with a motorcycle helmet – or maybe, as in some accounts, a hammer. In any case, the blow to her head ‘further complicates the unknown condition’ that has caused Tammi Terrell to suffer from migraines since her early teens.\n\nThis is the background to Tammi Terrell’s life and recording career before she begins working with Marvin Gaye in 1967. Given her stormy past and the tender and sensual nature of their duets, it may be natural to suspect that Tammi Terrell and Marvin Gaye are also lovers. However, so far as can be determined, he is ‘simply a friend…[They are] never, ever romantically involved.’ Marvin Gaye remains shy and self-conscious as a live performer and the more extroverted Tammi Terrell inspires him to be more out-going when they go on a concert tour together in 1967.\n\nThe first duet recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell is ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ (US no. 19, UK no. 80). This single is released on 20 April 1967. ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ is co-written by the husband-and-wife team of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. This duo pens the bulk of Gaye and Terrell’s duets. Ashford and Simpson’s marriage gives their work a genuine ease and familiarity that translates into an appealing vocal chemistry between Gaye and Terrell. ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ is endearing in its lyrical show of devotion and the rattling percussion of the musical accompaniment is similarly heart-warming. ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ will be covered in 1968 as a duet between two Motown vocal group, the all-female Diana Ross And The Supremes and the all-male act, The Temptations. However, the best known version of ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ (US no. 1, UK no. 6, AUS no. 25) is the epic 1970 rendition by Diana Ross as a solo act after leaving The Supremes.\n\nOn 13 June 1967 the Marvin Gaye solo single ‘Your Unchanging Love’ (US no. 33) is issued. This composition by Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland is lifted from the previous year’s Marvin Gaye solo album ‘The Moods Of Marvin Gaye’. ‘Your Unchanging Love’ is a light and swinging tune carried by a wandering piano. Beneath that is complex web of rhythm: hand-claps, pattering drums and clip-clopping percussion.\n\n‘Your Precious Love’ (US no. 5) is released as a single on 22 August 1967. It is the second duet by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. Like ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’, ‘Your Precious Love’ is co-written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. This is a slow and stately song of lingering romanticism; the simple melody is enhanced by a string section. ‘Your Precious Love’ is described as a ‘doo wop styled recording.’ Gaye and Terrell are joined on backing vocals by Harvey Fuqua and Johnny Bristol. The Funk Brothers musical backing is filled out by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n\n‘United’ (1967) (US no. 69), released on 29 August, is the first of three albums of duets co-credited to Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. This album is co-produced by Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol, Hal Davis and Berry Gordy. ‘United’ includes ‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ and ‘Your Precious Love’, the first two duets by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. Two more songs from ‘United’, ‘If I Could Build My Whole World Around You’ and ‘If This World Were Mine’, will be released as a single later in the year.\n\nOn 14 October 1967 Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell perform a show together at Hampden-Sydney College just outside Farmville in Virginia. Tammi Terrell collapses in Marvin Gaye’s arms on stage. He helps her off stage. Shortly after this incident, doctors diagnose a malignant tumour on the right side of Terrell’s brain. Despite this ominous shadow falling over her, Tammi Terrell will fight this medical problem and continue her recording career.\n\n‘If I Could Build My Whole World Around You’ (US no. 10, UK no. 41) is the A side of a duet single by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell that is released on 14 November 1967. This song is co-written by Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol and Vernon Bullock. The ‘vocals go back and forth as they describe what could be if either of them was able to “build a world” around their loved one.’ This is an uptempo, swiftly swinging piece of love-struck pop. The B side of the single is ‘If This World Were Mine’ (US no. 68). Romantic and tender, this piece is almost conveyed as though it was gospel music. ‘If This World Were Mine’ is written by Marvin Gaye. Both of these songs come from the album ‘United’ which was released earlier in the year.\n\n‘You’ (US no. 34) is Marvin Gaye’s next solo single. It is released on 21 December 1967. This song is written by Jeffrey Bowen, Jack Coga and Ivy Jo Hunter. ‘You’ is tougher than standard Motown fare. Its narrative about an illicit love affair prompts an anxious vocal from Marvin Gaye.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s ‘Greatest Hits, Vol.2’ (1967) (US no. 183) is his second collection of hit singles. This is the first album to include Gaye’s 1965 stand-alone single ‘Pretty Little Baby’.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s partnership with Tammi Terrell continues into 1968 with ‘Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing’ (US no. 8, UK no. 34). This is released on 28 March 1968. Although the title may sound like an advertisement for Coca-Cola, in reality this is a soaring and moving romantic ode. ‘Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing’ is written and produced by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson and they also provide backing vocals on the song.\n\n‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ (US no. 7, UK no. 19) is released as a single on 9 July 1968. Another Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson composition, ‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ is stirring in its loving devotion. It is described as ‘more soulful and gospel-oriented’ than most Motown hits. Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell recorded their vocals for this song separately. Partly, this is done to reduce the time spent in the recording studio. But also it is to allow Tammi Terrell to have a more flexible schedule to deal with her illness.\n\n‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ (1968) (US no. 60), released in August, is the second of three albums by the team of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. This disc is co-produced by Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson and Berry Gordy’s younger brother, Robert Gordy. This album includes ‘Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing’ and the title track. Two more songs from ‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ will later become a single – ‘Keep On Lovin’ Me Honey’ and ‘You Ain’t Livin’ Till You’re Lovin’’ – but they will be discussed in due course.\n\n‘In The Groove’ (1968) (US no. 63), released on 26 August, is a new solo album by Marvin Gaye. This album is co-produced by Norman Whitfield, Ivy Jo Hunter and Frank Wilson. Up to this point, Marvin Gaye has worked with a variety of producers including such notables as Smokey Robinson and Holland-Dozier-Holland. This is a little unusual because most Motown acts are assigned a producer and that remains their lot. Marvin Gaye follows a different path. There are a couple of possible reasons for this variance. First, Gaye is notoriously wilful and perhaps tests the patience of his overseers. Secondly, on a more positive note, it may also just be a testament to his versatility that he can adapt to different approaches. However, ‘In The Groove’ marks the start of his association with Norman Whitfield. As a songwriter, Whitfield has co-written such earlier Marvin Gaye songs as ‘Pride And Joy’ and ‘Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)’ (both from 1963). Whitfield is described as ‘Marvin’s main motivator’ in the late 1960s. ‘Two headstrong men who nearly come to blows, they create sounds combining passionate yearning and restless anger.’ Marvin Gaye’s marriage to Anna Gordy is starting to fray. Their relationship is said to be ‘turbulent’ and marred by ‘public spats.’ Norman ‘Whitfield’s songs appeal to Gaye in their reflection of the turmoil of Marvin’s marriage to Anna.’ Add in Marvin Gaye’s persistent dislike of live performances, his conflicts with Motown boss Berry Gordy (the brother of Gaye’s increasingly disaffected spouse) and Tammi Terrell’s serious health issues and it can be understood how Whitfield’s songs ‘fit the singer’s chaotic personal life.’ ‘In The Groove’ includes the earlier 1967 single ‘You’ which was produced by Ivy Jo Hunter. Another track from this album, ‘Chained’ (US no. 32), becomes Marvin Gaye’s next single in September. ‘Chained’ is written by Frank Wilson, a man said to be Norman Whitfield’s ‘pupil’. Wilson also co-produces this album. “’Cause I’m chained to your love and affection,” Marvin Gaye sings in ‘Chained’. This is a forceful track backed up by a hard-charging musical phalanx of guitar, piano, horns and backing vocals. A third single will come from ‘In The Groove’. That song, ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’, is fated to be the album’s biggest success. More information on that song will follow soon. ‘In The Groove’ is hailed as ‘Gaye’s commercial breakthrough.’\n\n‘Keep On Lovin’ Me Honey’ (US no. 24) is a duet by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell that reaches the charts in September 1968. This song is written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. ‘Keep On Lovin’ Me Honey’ is an upbeat number sweetened with strings. Gaye and Terrell both employ a gospel style shout as they harmonise, “’Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe.” The B side is ‘You Ain’t Livin’ Till You’re Lovin’’ (UK no. 21), another Ashford and Simpson composition. It is a relaxed but saucy song. It has a nice groove and gentle orchestration. Both sides of this single are lifted from the album ‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ which was released earlier in the year.\n\nAfter ‘Keep On Lovin’ Me Honey’, Tammi Terrell issues a new solo single. ‘This Old Heart Of Mine’ (US no. 67) is a cover version of a 1966 song by The Isley Brothers.\n\nThe 1968 Marvin Gaye single ‘His Eye Is On The Sparrow’ is a bit of an oddity. This non-charting single is a version of a 1905 gospel hymn written by Civillia D. Martin and Charles H. Gabriel. Marvin Gaye renders this as an aching paean to Jesus. “He watches over me,” Gaye assures himself…and us. ‘His Eye Is On The Sparrow’ comes from ‘In Loving Memory’ (1968), an album of gospel music featuring various Motown recording artists including Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross And The Supremes. The reason for the creation of this album is shown in its subtitle: ‘A Tribute to Mrs Loucye G Wakefield.’ She was the sister of Motown boss Berry Gordy. Loucye Gordy Wakefield passed away on 24 July 1965 at the age of 41 due to brain cancer.\n\nOn 30 October 1968 the Marvin Gaye single ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 40) is released. This is lifted from the album ‘In The Groove’ (1968) which was issued earlier in the year. ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ is co-written by Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield. Barrett Strong picked up the title from a common phrase he heard in the streets. The song was first recorded on 6 August 1966 by fellow Motown act The Miracles but their version went unreleased until their album ‘Special Occasion’ (1968). It is also thought that The Isley Brothers may have recorded a version of ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ under the aegis of producer Norman Whitfield. However, this recording has never materialised and it now seems generally accepted that the relevant recording session was cancelled. The first recording of ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ (US no. 2) to be released was the interpretation by Gladys Knight And The Pips which was issued on 28 September 1967. When Norman Whitfield told Marvin Gaye he wanted the singer to record a version of ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ it predictably led to a disagreement. Whitfield wanted Gaye to sing the song in a higher voice but Gaye disagreed and, eventually, had his way. So Marvin Gaye’s ‘raspy’ lead vocal contrasts with the ‘sweeter harmonies’ of The Andantes, his trio of female backing vocalists. With a new fire and grit in his voice, Gaye sings, “I bet you’re wonderin’ how I knew / About your plan to make me blue / With some other guy that you knew before / Between the two of us guys you know I love you more / It took me by surprise I must say when I found out yesterday / Instead I heard it through the grapevine / Not much longer would you be mine.” Norman Whitfield’s inventive production equals the singer’s verve. A harrowing string section (from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra) is pitted against the deep bass keyboard notes (from Earl Van Dyke and Johnny Griffin) and tribal drumming (by Richard ‘Pistol’ Allen and Uriel Jones) that infuses the song with a sense of primitive dread. Other musicians on Marvin Gaye’s reading of ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ are: Joe Messina (guitar), James Jamerson (bass) and Jack Ashford (percussion). Note: Jack Ashford is unrelated to Nickolas Ashford, the Motown songwriter. The string section arrangement is the work of Paul Riser. Motown boss Berry Gordy didn’t want to release Marvin Gaye’s ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ as a single because he didn’t think it was good enough. Gordy only relented because radio disc jockeys picked up on the track and started playing it anyway. ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ becomes the first of three U.S. no. 1 singles by Marvin Gaye. Of those three hits, this is easily the most enduring, holding the top spot for seven weeks: 14 December 1968 to 25 January 1969. ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ comes to be regarded as a ‘soul classic’ and ‘arguably the pinnacle of the Motown sound.’ Ironically, Marvin Gaye is not impressed by the success; he feels it is ‘undeserved.’ Motown rereleases the ‘In The Groove’ album, retitling it ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’. In 1970 white rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival will record a cover version of ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’. Marvin Gaye’s ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ is his best individual song for reasons beyond its commercial impact. It balances Motown’s hit machine nous with a fierce individualism. You could dance to the beat but it also resonated with something deeper and atavistic at its core. Its romantic woes were heartfelt but it also made the soul shudder.\n\nThe three day Miami Pop Festival begins on 18 December 1968. Marvin Gaye is one of the performers at this event in Hallandale, Florida. Others on the bill include Chuck Berry, Fleetwood Mac, The Grateful Dead and Joni Mitchell.\n\nTammi Terrell’s only full-length solo album, ‘Irresistible’ (1969), is released in January. This disc includes all her earlier Motown solo singles: ‘I Can’t Believe You Love Me’ (from 1965), ‘Come On And See Me’ and ‘What A Good Man He Is’ (both from 1966) as well as her cover version of ‘This Old Heart Of Mine’ (from 1968). No new material is recorded for ‘Irresistible’; everything here had been recorded earlier but, aside from the singles, had been left on the shelf. Tammi Terrell is too ill to promote this album.\n\n‘Good Lovin’ Ain’t Easy To Come By’ (US no. 30, UK no. 26) is a duet single by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell that debuts on the charts in February 1969. This song is co-written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Thematically, ‘Good Lovin’ Ain’t Easy To Come By’ is about strength through struggle and the melody charts an appropriately upwards trajectory. Similarly the burning love of the song is reflected in the fiery vocal performances from Gaye and Terrell.\n\n‘Good Lovin’ Ain’t Easy To Come By’ is included on the compilation album ‘Marvin Gaye And His Girls’ (1969) (US no. 183), which is released on 2 April. This disc features duets between Marvin Gaye and three different women: Mary Wells, Kim Weston and Tammi Terrell.\n\n‘M.P.G.’ (1969) (US no. 33) is a Marvin Gaye solo album named after his initials: Marvin Pentz Gaye. This disc is released on 30 April. ‘M.P.G.’ is co-produced by Norman Whitfield, Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier. Also released in April is the first single from this set: ‘Too Busy Thinking About My Baby’ (US no. 4, UK no. 5). The co-authors of this song are Janie Bradford, Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. ‘Too Busy Thinking About My Baby’ was first recorded by Motown vocal group The Temptations on their album ‘Gettin’ Ready’ (1966). Narrated by a love-struck Romeo with a one-track mind, this song has a throbbing, pulsing groove. Marvin Gaye is backed by female vocalists The Andantes and Motown’s house band The Funk Brothers. ‘Too Busy Thinking About My Baby’ has a similar feel to ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’ but is perhaps a little sweeter. Marvin Gaye’s next single, ‘That’s The Way Love Is’ (US no. 7), is lifted from this album on 7 August 1969. This track is co-written by Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield. An uptempo rendition of this song was first recorded by The Isley Brothers in 1967. The Marvin Gaye version is a ‘slowed down psychedelic soul opus’ for which the singer adopts a ‘preacher-like tone.’ This philosophical take on heartbreak has rattlesnake percussion and, once again, features backing from The Andantes and The Funk Brothers. It is also hard to deny that, yet again, this song bears a similarity to ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine.’ At Motown, Berry ‘Gordy’s innate caution dictates follow-ups that only slightly alter the elements of a previous hit; a formula is mined until it is commercially exhausted.’ Another song from ‘M.P.G.’, ‘The End Of Our Road’, will be issued as a single – but not until May 1970 so it will be described at that point in this narrative.\n\nThe 1969 Marvin Gaye song ‘Abraham, Martin And John’ (UK no. 9) is released as a single only in the U.K. Written by Dick Holler, this song was first recorded in 1968 by white doo wop singer turned folk artist Dion. History and tragedy intertwine in this tale of the lives of assassinated U.S. political and social figures Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy and Robert ‘Bobby’ Kennedy. Marvin Gaye’s treatment of the song is delicate and soulful.\n\n‘Easy’ (1969) (US no. 184), released on 16 September, is the third and final album of duets by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. This album is co-produced by Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson, Harvey Fuqua and Johnny Bristol. Rumours persist that the female vocals on this album are actually laid down by Valerie Simpson rather than Tammi Terrell, but Simpson denies this. It is acknowledged by Valerie Simpson that she recorded guide vocals for these songs, but Tammi Terrell was brought into the recording studio to complete the vocals. ‘Easy’ includes the earlier single ‘Good Lovin’ Ain’t Easy To Come By’. ‘What You Gave Me’ (US no. 49) from this album hits the singles chart in December 1969. This is another Ashford and Simpson composition. ‘What You Gave Me’ is a light and breezy tune based on an electric piano figure and adorned with Las Vegas-style horns. Two more tracks from ‘Easy’ – ‘The Onion Song’ and ‘California Soul’ – will be released on a single but not until later so they will be dealt with in due course.\n\nAround this time, Tammi Terrell becomes romantically involved with Dr Ernest ‘Ernie’ Garrett. She is reportedly engaged to Garrett ‘during the last year of her life.’\n\nTammi Terrell is forced to retire from live performances in 1969 under doctor’s orders.\n\nOn 16 December 1969 Marvin Gaye releases the single ‘How Can I Forget’ (US no. 41) backed with ‘Gonna Give Her All The Love I’ve Got’ (US no. 67). Both of these songs are cover versions of songs recorded earlier by other artists. ‘How Can I Forget’ was first recorded by The Temptations in 1968. ‘Gonna Give Her All The Love I’ve Got’ (US no. 29) was first recorded by Jimmy Ruffin in 1967 (the brother of Temptations singer David Ruffin); The Temptations also recorded the same song in 1968 – but only as an album track. Both songs on this single are penned by the same songwriting team: Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield. Marvin Gaye’s version of ‘How Can I Forget’ is big and bold with a twangy guitar and heaving organ. However its most distinctive feature is the big production number horn arrangement by Jerry Long. Thematically, ‘How Can I Forget’ is an ode to lost love. By contrast, ‘Gonna Give Her All The Love I’ve Got’ is warmly understated. Although this song has an orchestral backing, the simple and enticing chord structure remains at the forefront.\n\nTammi Terrell’s last public appearance occurs late in 1969. Marvin Gaye is playing a show at the Apollo Theater when he spots Tammi in the audience. Gaye rushes over to her with a microphone and they sing ‘You’re All I Need To Get By’ together. The crowd gives them a public ovation.\n\n‘That’s The Way Love Is’ (1970) (US no. 189) is a Marvin Gaye album released on 18 January. This album is produced by Norman Whitfield. The title track, ’That’s The Way Love Is’, also appeared on Marvin Gaye’s previous solo album ‘M.P.G.’ (1969). Also included on this disc are the earlier Gaye singles ‘Abraham, Martin And John’, ‘How Can I Forget’ and ‘Gonna Give Her All The Love I’ve Got’. What all four songs have in common is that they are all cover versions of songs previously recorded by other artists (respectively, The Isley Brothers, Dion, The Temptations and Jimmy Ruffin). Indeed, every song on ‘That’s The Way Love Is’ is a cover version. Perhaps Marvin Gaye was too distracted by other matters – marital troubles, Tammi Terrell’s illness, conflicts with Motown – to write new material or bother with finding previously unrecorded outside compositions?\n\nBy early 1970 Tammi Terrell is confined to a wheelchair. Her brain tumour is having other frightening negative effects on her health. She is now blind and has suffered significant weight loss. On 21 January 1970 Tammi Terrell undergoes surgery on the tumour for the eighth and final time. After the operation, she lapses into a coma. Tammi Terrell dies on 16 March 1970 as a result of complications from the brain tumour. She was 24 years old, just a month short of her 25th birthday. Tammi’s mother bans all Motown personnel – with the exception of Marvin Gaye – from her daughter’s funeral. Gaye later says, “I had such emotional experiences with Tammi and her subsequent death that I don’t imagine I’ll ever work with a girl again.” Time will prove that statement to be incorrect.\n\n‘The Onion Song’ (US no. 50, UK no. 9) b/w ‘California Soul’ (US no. 25) is a duet single by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell that reaches the pop singles charts in April 1970 after Terrell’s death. Both sides of this single appeared on the duo’s last album together, ‘Easy’ (1969), and both songs are co-written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Given an upbeat melody, ‘The Onion Song’ is about triumphing over adversity through love. It is rendered almost believable thanks to the duo’s energetic vocal performances. ‘California Soul’ was first recorded as a B side for a single by The Messengers. The Fifth Dimension had a hit with ‘California Soul’ (US no. 25) in 1968. Gaye and Terrell’s interpretation brims with string-soaked sunshine. It describes people being “So happy they were rockin’ and reelin’ / Because they added that lovin’ feeling / To California soul.”\n\nMotown plucks another song from Marvin Gaye’s ‘M.P.G.’ (1969) album to become a single in May 1970. The song selected is ‘The End Of Our Road’ (US no. 40). It is co-written by Roger Penzabine, Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. Gladys Knight And The Pips originally recorded ‘The End Of Our Road’ (US no. 15) in 1968. “I’m tired of your stuff / Say enough is enough,” says the lyrics of this song about a romance drawing to a conclusion. The Marvin Gaye rendition is an example of psychedelic soul with a thin and niggling guitar line.\n\nThe compilation album ‘Marvin Gaye And Tammi Terrell’s Greatest Hits’ (1970) (US no. 171, UK no. 60) is released on 4 July. This is followed by a compilation of Marvin Gaye’s solo work titled ‘Super Hits’ (1970) (US no. 117). The latter is released in September.\n\nAlthough Motown may have kept Marvin Gaye’s recordings in the marketplace during this year, the singer actually spends the majority of 1970 in seclusion. Gaye never really gets over Tammi Terrell’s death and struggles with depression and drug abuse. His dark frame of mind is exacerbated by conflicts with his wife Anna and the Motown organisation. In the late 1960s Marvin Gaye had experienced his first real international success with songs like ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’, ‘Too Busy Thinking About My Baby’ and ‘Abraham, Martin And John’. However, Gaye is ‘in no mood to celebrate.’ “My success didn’t seem real,” he says. “I didn’t deserve it. I knew I could have done more. I felt like a puppet – Berry [Gordy’s] puppet, [my wife] Anna’s puppet. I had a mind of my own and I wasn’t using it.” Adding to his woes, Marvin Gaye finds himself under investigation by the taxman, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.). Things get so bad that Gaye uses a handgun to attempt suicide. This is thwarted by Berry Gordy II, the father of Motown boss Berry Gordy as well as being Marvin’s father-in-law. Trying to redirect himself, Marvin Gaye tries out in spring 1970 for the Detroit Lions, the local U.S. gridiron football team. Gave gives up this idea after being advised that any football injury he sustains could also derail his music career. However the singer does befriend three of the football players: Mel Farr, Charlie Sanders and Lem Barney.\n\nMarvin Gaye reassesses his music career. He abandons his ‘clean-cut, college-boy image to grow a beard and dress more casually.’ The death of Tammi Terrell appears to be the catalyst that ends Marvin Gaye’s time as ‘a soul stylist’ plying the wares of the Motown production line and transforms him into ‘a more gospel-influenced soul vocalist.’ “In 1969 or 1970 I began to re-evaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my music to say,” Gaye agrees. His younger brother Frankie does a three year tour of duty with the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War. “I was very much affected by letters my brother was sending from Vietnam, as well as the social situation here at home. I realised that I had to put my own fantasies behind me if I wanted to write songs that would reach the souls of people. I wanted them to look at what was happening in the world,” says Gaye.\n\nWhen Marvin Gaye resurfaces it is with ‘What’s Going On’ (1971) (US no. 6). This album is released on 21 May. ‘What’s Going On’ stands out as the best album of Marvin Gaye’s entire career. It is important to understand that the whole album is really just one big piece of music cut into individual slices. For this reason, there is a lot of similarity between the component songs. The album’s biggest hit and its most famous moment is the title track, ‘What’s Going On’ (US no. 2). The song is a curious mix of disparate elements of confessional folk, wandering jazz and rhythm and blues attitude. On paper, that sounds like a recipe for disaster but at Marvin Gaye’s command the pieces just magically coalesce. The soprano saxophone heard in the opening is played by Eli Fontaine. Unknown to Fontaine, Gaye recorded the sax man’s rehearsal practice and these are the notes played in the opening. When Fontaine protested that he was just goofing around, Gaye replied, “Well, you goof exquisitely. Thank you.” Credit must also be extended to arranger David DePitte whose orchestral settings are sympathetic to Gaye’s goals. Lyrically, ‘What’s Going On’ seems to tie together an equally diverse number of threads to the multi-coloured music. The words touch on the highly personal domestic violence within Marvin’s childhood household, his brother’s service in Vietnam and the general societal unrest in the U.S.A.: “Mother, mother / There’s too many of you crying / Brother, brother, brother / There’s far too many of you dying / You know we’ve got to find a way / To bring some lovin’ here today…Picket lines and picket signs / Don’t punish me with brutality / Talk to me so you can see / What’s going on.” The song ‘What’s Going On’ is co-written by Al Cleveland, Marvin Gaye and Renaldo ‘Obie’ Benson. The last-named is a member of Motown male vocal group The Four Tops. On 15 May 1969, Benson witnessed police brutality at an anti-war protest in Berkeley, California. Renaldo Benson discussed the incident with Al Cleveland and the pair wrote a song about what happened. Benson took the song to The Four Tops, but they turned it down. The composition was then turned over to Marvin Gaye who revised it and added new lyrics. The title ‘What’s Going On’ comes from Marvin Gaye’s new sporting acquaintances. After trying out for the Detroit Lions football team, Gaye became friends with some of the players. Following a game of golf, running back Mel Farr recalls how he and a couple of teammates went back to Gaye’s place for a few beers. ‘Somebody’ said ‘Hey now, what’s goin’ on?’ and Gaye reputedly laughed and said that was a great name for a song. Gaye sat down at the piano and started playing. ‘What’s Going On’ has a steady undercurrent of muttered conversation (‘backing vocals’) from Mel Farr, Lem Barney and songwriter Elgie Stover. White U.S. singer Cyndi Lauper will have a hit with a cover version of ‘What’s Going On’ (US no. 12, UK no. 57, AUS no. 32) in March 1987. As an album, ‘What’s Going On’ is ‘a seemingly effortless blend of psychedelia, soul and jazz delivered with singer-songwriterly acumen.’ It is a ‘concept album consisting of nine songs, most of which segue into the next’ and all are written from the ‘viewpoint of a Vietnam vet looking at his country through fresh eyes.’ The album’s second single, ‘Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)’ (US no. 4) (written by Marvin Gaye) sounds like it is one beat up from ‘What’s Going On’. The saxophone is played by Will Bill Monroe and the percussive sound is a wooden block being struck by a rubber mallet. However it is its environmental consciousness that is the song’s most conspicuous feature. The third single – and the closing track of the album – is ‘Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)’ (US no. 9). This is co-written by Marvin Gaye and James Nyx. Compared to its companions, this is a darker and tougher-minded track with an unflinching look at urban decay. A fourth track from ‘What’s Going On’ is released as a single – but it is only a comparatively minor hit in the U.K. ‘Save The Children’ (UK no. 41) is a preaching piece, half-spoken and half almost like a child’s nursery rhyme sing-song. This song is co-credited to the same three songwriters as the title track of this album: Al Cleveland, Marvin Gaye and Renaldo Benson. Elsewhere, ‘What’s Happening Brother’ (co-written by Nyx and Gaye) and ‘Right On’ (co-written by Earl DeRouen and Gaye) are lighter, more skeletal, transitional songs linking sections of the album. ‘Flyin’ High’ (co-written by Marvin Gaye, Anna Gordy Gaye and Elgie Stover) warns of the dangers of drugs. So what’s the answer to the myriad perils outlined in ‘What’s Going On’? “Find God: We’ve got to find the Lord,” urges Gaye in the album’s liner notes. This sentiment finds musical expression in the upbeat ‘God Is Love’ (co-written by Marvin Gaye, Anna Gordy Gaye, Elgie Stover and James Nyx) and the hushed ‘Wholy [sic] Holy’ (co-written by Renaldo Benson, Al Cleveland and Marvin Gaye). Aretha Franklin will record a cover version of ‘Wholy Holy’ (US no. 81) in 1972. For all its revolutionary fervour, ‘What’s Going On’ still features The Funk Brothers who have played on so many of Motown’s 1960s hits. Marvin Gaye does bring in some supplementary musicians such as Eli Fontaine (saxophone), Wild Bill Monroe (saxophone) and Chet Forrest (drums). Gaye also plays piano himself on some tracks. The recording sessions are fuelled by Scotch and take place ‘amid a haze of marijuana smoke.’ Given his shared history with Marvin Gaye, it is perhaps not too surprising that Motown chief Berry Gordy is not pleased with ‘What’s Going On’ and the album’s social consciousness. After some threats to never record again for Motown, Marvin Gaye has his way and the album delivers on his conviction not only artistically, but also in commercial terms. Marvin Gaye says, “I didn’t know how to fight before, but now I think I do. I just have to do it my way. I’m not a painter. I’m not a poet. But I can do it with my music.” ‘What’s Going On’ is ‘a conceptual masterpiece [that] forges a remarkably sophisticated and fluid soul sound…that forever alters the face of black music.’ It is ‘one of the landmarks in pop history.’ In 1996 ‘What’s Going On’ (UK no. 56) will finally make a (minor) showing on the U.K. album chart.\n\n‘What’s Going On’ is the last major work recorded at Motown’s Hitsville U.S.A. studios in Detroit. In 1971 the company relocates its headquarters to Los Angeles, California. Though it is not immediately apparent, this is the beginning of the end for Motown. The company will still enjoy considerable success in the 1970s but the situation is changing. The old production line system of the 1960s is finished. Diana Ross has split from The Supremes and become a solo artist. Stevie Wonder is now displaying considerable artistic independence. In 1971 Marvin Gaye signs a new deal with Motown that gives him more control and, with a price of one million dollars, it is the most lucrative recording contract for a black artist at this time. In 1971 Marvin Gaye and his wife, Anna Gordy, move from Detroit to a new home in Hollywood.\n\nIn the summer of 1972 Marvin Gaye issues a one-off single called ‘You’re The Man’ (US no. 50). This is co-written by Marvin Gaye and Kenneth Stover – the brother of songwriter Elgie Stover. ‘You’re The Man’ is a political commentary on the 1972 U.S. Presidential election. The song has a sneaky groove but also still retains a similar feel to ‘What’s Going On’.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s next album is ‘Trouble Man’ (1972) (US no. 14), released on 8 December. This disc is produced by Marvin Gaye. ‘Trouble Man’ is actually the soundtrack to a ‘blaxploitation thriller,’ a movie about a super cool black fixer known as Mr T who comes into town to straighten out some crooks. ‘Trouble Man’ (the album) is a ‘primarily instrumental effort showcasing [Marvin Gaye’s] increasing interest in jazz.’ The title track, ‘Trouble Man’ (US no. 7), is written by Marvin Gaye and he plays piano and drums on this song. Musically, this is heavily jazz influenced and showcases splashy drums and Gaye’s falsetto vocal telling of “taxes, death and trouble.” It is said of the ‘Trouble Man’ album that ‘the quality of the music transcends that of the film itself.’\n\nThe year closes out with Marvin Gaye’s (non-charting) seasonal single ‘I Want To Come Home For Christmas’. This is co-written by Marvin Gaye and Forrest Hairston. The song is written from the point of view of a U.S. soldier who is a prisoner of war in Vietnam and longs to return to his homeland. It is a mix of political, personal and spiritual sentiments. ‘I Want To Come Home For Christmas’ was recorded about the same time as ‘Trouble Man’ but is a stand-alone single that does not appear on any album of new, original material.\n\nIn 1973 Marvin Gaye moves his parents, Marvin Gay, Senior, and Alberta Gay, from Detroit to a new home in Los Angeles.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s life changes while he is recording his next album. It is at this time that he meets Janis Elizabeth Hunter (born on 5 January 1956 in Los Angeles). She is the daughter of jazz guitarist Slim Gaillard and Barbara Hunter. Ed Townsend, who is co-producing Gaye’s album, is friends with Barbara. In this way, Marvin Gaye befriends the family. He is allegedly ‘smitten’ with 17 year old Jan and she is said to be present at the studio during the recording sessions.\n\n‘Let’s Get It On’ (1973) (US no. 2, UK no. 39) is released on 28 August. This album is co-produced by Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend. Recording sessions take place at Hitsville U.S.A. in Detroit, Golden World Studio in Detroit (Motown’s Studio B) and Hitsville West in Los Angeles. ‘Let’s Get It On’ is said to ‘mark a change and transition in sound and production for Motown.’ The light rhythm and blues-pop hybrid that distinguished 1960s Motown hits is virtually absent from this album. Even the jazz-influenced stylings of ‘What’s Going On’ and ‘Trouble Man’ have been left behind in favour of funk, the most typical sound of early 1970s black pop music. It is bass-heavy, dance-oriented and sexy. Anyone expecting Marvin Gaye to deliver another album of socially conscious commentary like ‘What’s Going On’ is surprised. ‘Let’s Get It On’ is ‘one of the most joyous celebrations of sex ever recorded.’ “I can’t see anything wrong with sex between consenting anybodies,” says Gaye in the liner notes for this album. He adds, “Sex is sex and love is love.” Naturally, Marvin Gaye can’t be that simple and straightforward. He also contends that the ‘sexually suggestive’ nature of the material is ‘meant as a metaphor for God’s love.’ Additionally, Gaye reportedly suffered from writer’s block during the creation of this album. The title track, ‘Let’s Get It On’ (US no. 1, UK no. 31, AUS no. 52), is co-written by Marvin Gaye and the album’s co-producer Ed Townsend. In this song, Marvin tries to reassure the object of his desire that “We’re all sensitive people / With so much to give” and “There’s nothing wrong with me loving you” because “Giving yourself to me can never be wrong / If the love is true.” These lyrics are delivered in a high, cooing voice. Finally he pleads, “Stop beating ‘round the bush / Let’s get it on.” The music is appropriately erotic, its libidinous charge barely restrained. When co-author Ed Townsend started the song, he had just been released from an alcohol rehabilitation facility and he intended the song to have a religious theme. The song was handed over to Marvin Gaye’s ‘confidante’ Kenneth Stover who changed the lyrics to make it a more political song. Townsend protested about this change and Gaye consented to rework the lyrics with Townsend. Sex is still quite a different topic than religion but, apparently, this was more acceptable to Townsend. Marvin Gaye’s interest was in Janis Hunter. ‘Let’s Get It On’ is alive with his desire for her. ‘Let’s Get It On’ becomes the second of Marvin Gaye’s three U.S. no. 1 singles; it tops the U.S. singles chart on 8 September 1973 but only holds that position for one week. ‘Come Get To This’ (US no. 21, UK no. 51) is a bid for attention…of a sexual kind. It has easy syncopation, a stray saxophone, sighing background vocals and strings. It sounds rather like goosed-up supper club music. ‘You Sure Love To Ball’ (US no. 50) opens with the sounds of a man and woman groaning in an apparent simulation of sex. This pre-dates Donna Summer’s more famous 1975 song ‘Love To Love You Baby’ which also featured orgasmic moans. ‘You Sure Love To Ball’ is sort of laid-back and jazz-like, sounding musically more like the afterglow of love-making than the height of passion. Both ‘Come Get To This’ and ‘You Sure Love To Ball’ are Marvin Gaye solo compositions. ‘Distant Lover’, another track from ‘Let’s Get It On’, will become a single later. However, that single is a concert recording of the song from a soon-to-follow live album so it will be detailed in that context. A track recorded during the sessions of ‘Let’s Get It On’, ‘The World Is Rated X’, will surface many years later. ‘Let’s Get It On’ is the culmination of the ‘long simmering eroticism’ that has always been a part of Marvin Gaye’s career. It is ‘a work of intense lust and longing.’\n\nIn September 1973, one month after the release of the ‘Let’s Get It On’ album, Marvin Gaye and his wife Anna Gordy separate. Anna will officially file for divorce in November 1975. The divorce is finalised in 1977. ‘The dissolution of his marriage throws Gaye into a tailspin, and he spends much of the mid-1970s in divorce court.’\n\nShortly after the release of ‘Let’s Get It On’, Marvin Gaye begins dating Janis Hunter. By 1974, they will be living together. Marvin and Janis go on to have two children together: a girl named Nona Gaye (born on 4 September 1974) and a boy named Frankie Gaye (born on 16 November 1975). Marvin and Janis will marry – but that event will not take place until 1977, after the births of their children.\n\n‘Diana & Marvin’ (1973) (US no. 26, UK no. 6), released on 26 October, is an album of duets by Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. Production credit for this disc is shared amongst Hal Davis, Berry Gordy, Margaret Gordy, Bob Gaudio, Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Diana Ross is Marvin Gaye’s fourth – and final – duet partner. In the 1960s she was the leader of Motown vocal trio The Supremes and in the 1970s has become a successful solo artist. Ross is perhaps the premier act on the Motown roster, so it is an acknowledgement of Marvin Gaye’s status that he is chosen to partner her on this project. Gaye had previously sung duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston and Tammi Terrell. The untimely death of Terrell saw Gaye claim he would not sing duets with anyone else but it would seem that either the pressure or the opportunity to duet with Diana Ross changed his mind. The first single from ‘Diana & Marvin’ is ‘You’re A Special Part Of Me’ (US no. 12). This song is co-written by Harold Johnson, Andrew Porter and Greg Wright. The big production values that threaten to overwhelm ‘You’re A Special Part Of Me’ are held at bay by assured vocal performances from both Ross and Gaye in this classy number. ‘Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)’ (UK no. 25) is precise and smooth, slender but strong. On ‘You Are Everything’ (UK no. 5), Marvin Gaye really pulls out all the stops. His fiery vocals, when matched with Ross’ cool and creamy tones, make this an extremely moving song emotionally. Both ‘Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)’ and ‘You Are Everything’ are cover versions of songs co-written by Thom Bell and Linda Creed for U.S. (non-Motown) vocal group The Stylistics whose original renditions of these songs were released on, respectively, 4 March 1971 and 15 May 1971. ‘My Mistake (Was To Love You)’ (US no. 19) is co-written by Gloria Jones and Pam Sawyer and first recorded by Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. Although the lyrics to this song are full of regret, the string-soaked melody in contradiction is upbeat, light and frothy. ‘Don’t Knock My Love’ (UK no. 5) is a cover version of a 1971 Wilson Pickett song. A tale of moving on to a new love, this is a vibrant, energetic and brassy treatment under the production supervision of Hal Davis with The Funk Brothers providing the musical backing. As a whole, ‘Diana & Marvin’ is a prestigious effort that does credit to both principals – even though it is their only album of duets.\n\n‘Marvin Gaye Live’ (1974) (US no. 8) is a concert recording issued on 19 June. It chronicles a Marvin Gaye show at Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, that took place on 4 January 1974. The live recording of ‘Distant Lover’ (US no. 28) from this set is issued as a single. Marvin Gaye nicely croons this doo wop throwback while a crowd of screaming women fall for his ‘love man’ stylings. ‘Distant Lover’ is co-written by Marvin Gaye, Harvey Fuqua, Gwen Gordy and Sandra Greene. A studio recording of ‘Distant Lover’ first appeared on the album ‘Let’s Get It On’.\n\n‘Anthology’ (1974) (US no. 61), released on 22 August, is a collection of Marvin Gaye hits ranging from 1962 to 1971. ‘Anthology’ will be reissued in both 1984 and 1995 with slightly different contents.\n\nIn 1975 Marvin Gaye creates his own recording studio, ‘Marvin’s Room’. This facility is located on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Gaye will do most of his recording there for the next few years.\n\nMarvin Gaye’s next album is ‘I Want You’ (1976) (US no. 4, UK no. 22), released on 16 March. This album is co-produced by Marvin Gaye, Leon Ware and Arthur ‘T-Boy’ Ross. The cover art for ‘I Want You’ (the album) is a caricature by Ernie Barnes of an African-American dance party. When compared to Gaye’s last new album of studio recordings, ‘Let’s Get It On’, ‘I Want You’ is described as another ‘suite of overwhelming libidinous energy.’ The title track, ‘I Want You’ (US no. 15), is more like disco than funk as Gaye modifies his style with the changing musical times. In the lyrics, the song’s protagonist pleads with his lover to want him the way he wants her. Allegedly, ‘I Want You’ is about Marvin Gaye’s paramour, Janis Hunter. The problem with this is that ‘I Want You’ is co-written by co-producers Arthur ‘T-Boy’ Ross and Leon Ware; Marvin Gaye has no involvement in the writing of the song. Conceivably, Gaye could have commissioned Ross and Ware to write a song about Janis Hunter from Gaye’s viewpoint, but this seems to be stretching the facts to fit the legend. In any case, ‘I Want You’ is still a very cool song. The other single from this album, ‘After The Dance’ (US no. 74) is co-written by Marvin Gaye and Leon Ware. In this song, the vocalist asks a lady to meet up with him later. ‘After The Dance’ is soft as gauze, so light it feels like it could float away on a breeze.\n\nThe compilation set ‘Marvin Gaye’s Greatest Hits’ (1976) (US no. 44), released on 14 September, is predominantly assembled from Gaye’s 1970s output. There are only three songs from the 1960s present: ‘Can I Get A Witness’, ‘How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)’ and ‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine.’\n\n‘Live At The London Palladium’ (1977) (US no. 3) is released on 15 March. This is a double album. Three sides of this set were recorded at a Marvin Gaye concert at the London Palladium in England on 3 October 1976. The fourth side is given over to a new song. It is originally titled ‘Dancing Lady’. Retitled ‘Got To Give It Up’ it is a lengthy (11:48) piece freshly laid down in the recording studio. Edited down to a single (4:10) as ‘Got To Give It Up (Part 1)’ (US no. 1, UK no. 7), this becomes Marvin Gaye’s third and final no. 1 single. This song is written by Marvin Gaye and he conveys it in a feather-light falsetto voice. If ‘I Want You’ dipped a toe into disco, ‘Got To Give It Up’ plunges in at the deep end as an unruly dance groove. Brought up in a household where dancing was forbidden and having spent most of his career trying to come to terms with his own inhibitions, Gaye uses this disco hit to affirm ‘the power of dance [to] overcome any shyness.’ Part of the lyric explains, “I used to go out to parties / And stand around / ‘Cos I was too nervous to really get down / And my body / Yearned to be free / So I got up on the floor and found / Someone to choose me.” Marvin Gaye plays piano, bass keyboard and synthesiser on ‘Got To Give It Up’. Other performers on this track are: Johnny McGhee (guitar), Fernando Harkness (saxophone), Bugsy Wilcox (drums), Jack Ashford (tambourine), Marvin’s brother Frankie Gaye (backing vocals) and Marvin’s partner Janis Hunter (backing vocals). ‘Got To Give It Up (Part 1)’ tops the U.S. singles chart on 25 June 1977 but only holds that position for one week. The song is produced by Art Stewart.\n\nOn 10 October 1977 Marvin Gaye marries Janis Hunter. She is ‘the second great love of his life’ and his second wife. By the time of their marriage, Marvin and Janis are already the parents of two children: a daughter named Nona Gaye (born on 4 September 1974) and a son named Frankie Gaye (born on 16 November 1975). Ironically, Marvin Gaye was seventeen years younger than his first wife, Anna Gordy, and is seventeen years older than his second wife, Janis Hunter.\n\n‘Pops, We Love You’ (US no. 59, UK no. 66) is a single released on 8 December 1978. This single brings together Motown’s biggest stars: Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder. The single is subtitled ‘(A Tribute To Father)’. This helps explain the purpose of this gathering of talent. Berry ‘Pops’ Gordy, the father of Motown Records boss Berry Gordy has passed away as a result of cancer. So this song praises a person who plays a mentor role. Musically, it is a funky song notable for its popping bass. The four performers sing a verse each in the same order as they are listed earlier in this paragraph. ‘Pops, We Love You’ is a one-off single not included on any album. It is co-written by Marilyn McLeod and Pam Sawyer.\n\n‘Here, My Dear’ (1978) (US no. 26) is a double album by Marvin Gaye released on 15 December. It is also produced by Marvin Gaye. The singer’s divorce from his first wife, Anna Gordy, was finalised in 1977. The terms of the divorce settlement required Marvin Gaye to make two new albums and pay the royalties to his ex-wife as alimony. So Marvin Gaye composed this double album to fulfil that requirement and sourly titled it ‘Here, My Dear’. It is also described as ‘one of the weirdest Motown records ever.’ The first single from ‘Here, My Dear’ is ‘A Funky Space Reincarnation (Part 1)’ (US no. 106). (Part 2 is on the B side of the single.) ‘A Funky Space Reincarnation’ is pretty much what could be expected from the title. Over a percolating funk riff, lovers reunite in outer space. The lyrics name drop planets like Venus and Pluto, the movie ‘Star Wars’ and make references to spaceships. Marvin Gaye is the author of this song. ‘A Funky Space Reincarnation’ achieves only very minor success on the hit singles chart but it is the only song from ‘Here, My Dear’ that can even make that modest boast. ‘Anger’ is also issued as a single – but only in Canada. In this song, Marvin Gaye warbles about the troubles associated with losing your temper. The backdrop to this is a noodling groove. ‘Anger’ is co-written by Delta Ashby, Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend. ‘Here, My Dear’ also includes ‘bitterly funny’ songs like ‘You Can Leave, But It’s Going To Cost You.’ The centrepiece of the album is the sprawling (6:15) ‘When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You’. This song is written by Marvin Gaye. It begins with a spoken word introduction where Gaye intones, “You know when you say your marriage vows, they’re supposed to be for real / If you don’t honour what you say, you lie to God.” ‘When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You’ reappears as an instrumental and in a reprise in other parts of ‘Here, My Dear’ lending continuity to the whole project.\n\nEmerging from ‘Here, My Dear’, a chronicle of the disintegration of his first marriage, Marvin Gaye finds his second marriage is also falling apart. He and Janis Hunter split up in September 1979, though the divorce will not be finalised until February 1981. Later, Janis claims that Gaye subjected her to both domestic violence and psychological abuse. However, the final straw seems to be her affair with Teddy Pendergrass. Like Marvin Gaye, Pendergrass is an African-American singer with a sex symbol reputation. As Jan Gaye, Marvin Gaye’s ex-wife goes on to a career as an actress. However her only credit seems to be small role in ‘Lobster Man From Mars’ (1989).\n\n‘Marvin’s Room’, the Hollywood recording studio owned by Marvin Gaye, closes down in 1979. It had been in business since 1975.\n\nOn 17 September 1979 Marvin Gaye releases a single called ‘Ego Tripping Out’. Musically, this is a funky disco dance kind of thing but the lyrics are the most distinctive part of the song. There are boasts about sexual prowess and affluence as displayed in yachts, clothing, money and nightclubs. However, then the song’s narrator takes to scolding himself. It is a kind of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde psychodrama being acted out over a dance beat. It is described as ‘a duet between the spiritual and sexual halves of his identity.’ Fascinating as this may be, commercially it fails to make any mark on the pop charts. ‘Ego Tripping Out’ is written by Marvin Gaye.\n\nAfter ‘Here, My Dear’, Marvin Gaye began work on another album, a disc to be titled ‘Lover Man’. However, when ‘Ego Tripping Out’ fails to chart, it appears to dent Gaye’s self-confidence and he scraps the ‘Lover Man’ project.\n\nIn 1980 Motown releases a number of compilation albums by their most famous recording artists under the ‘Superstar’ banner. These include ‘Marvin Gaye – Superstar’ (1980) and ‘Marvin Gaye With Tammi Terrell – Superstar’ (1980). Marvin Gaye may not have appreciated the titling of these sets since he has said, “I am not a star. At least, I don’t consider myself a star.”\n\nOn a personal level, Marvin Gaye is not doing very well. In the wake of his failed marriage to Janis Hunter, Gaye’s drug consumption increases to problematic levels. He moves to Hawaii temporarily to ‘sort out his personal affairs.’\n\n‘In Our Lifetime’ (1981) (US no. 32, UK no. 48) is released on 15 January. Marvin Gaye acts as producer on this album as well as performer. Although not originally part of this album, the 1979 single ‘Ego Tripping Out’ is added to ‘In Our Lifetime’ from the 1994 rerelease of the disc and all subsequent reissues. That’s appropriate since this is ‘a deeply philosophical record’ whose cover artwork depicts two Marvin Gayes engaged in a cosmic chess game with each other. ‘Praise’ (US no. 101) is upbeat and optimistic, full or horns and skipping drum beats. When the singer suggests we praise him, it appears to be a request that we pray to God (i.e. praise Him, the Lord). The (non-charting) follow-up single from this album is ‘Heavy Love Affair’. After a whistled introductory section, this develops into a smooth piece of funk. Both singles are written by Marvin Gaye.\n\n‘In Our Lifetime’ is Marvin Gaye’s last new album for the Tamla label and the Motown organisation. ‘He claims the label remixed and edited the album without his consent.’ Additionally, Gaye gripes that a question mark was omitted from the album title and the cover artwork parodied his original intent. In Motown’s defence, Gaye has become ‘increasingly interested in metaphysics’ and is ‘virtually unmanageable.’ The singer rants, “I am not going to be dictated to by fans, certainly. I am dictated enough to by my record company to last me a million years.” Motown cuts Marvin Gaye loose. Gaye accuses Motown of ‘betraying his creativity.’\n\nIn the winter of 1981 Marvin Gaye moves to Ostend, Belgium. He is suffering from depression and cocaine addiction and is being pursued by the I.R.S. for tax purposes. Disc jockey Freddy Cousaert had suggested Gaye move to Belgium. From 13 June 1981 to 1 July 1981 Marvin Gaye undertakes ‘A Heavy Love Affair Tour 1981’ through England. He returns to Belgium and plays two shows at Ostend’s Casino Kursaal on 3 July 1981 and 4 July 1981. During this time, negotiations are underway with CBS Records and this label becomes the home for Marvin Gaye’s new recordings when he signs with CBS in March 1982. He is acutely aware of his situation. Gaye confesses, “I’m worried that I’m getting so introspective, no one will listen. I can’t afford to miss this time. I need a hit.”\n\n‘Midnight Love’ (1982) (US no. 7, UK no. 10), released on 1 October, is Marvin Gaye’s first album for CBS. Gaye also produces the disc. The first single from this album is ‘Sexual Healing’ (US no. 3, UK no. 4, AUS no. 4). The song has a faultless balance of pop hooks, dance grooves and sensuality. It is like capturing lightning in a bottle. Gaye sings, “I’ve got a heart just like an oven / I need some lovin’” so “When I get that feeling / I want sexual healing.” The song is co-written by Odell Brown, Marvin Gaye and David Ritz. Odell Brown plays keyboards on the song and Gaye writes the drum program. Also on this recording are Gordon Banks (guitar) and Gaye’s long-time associate Harvey Fuqua (backing vocals). David Ritz, co-author of ‘Sexual Healing’, is a journalist from ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine who came to Belgium to interview Marvin Gaye. Ritz is usually though to have come up with the title ‘Sexual Healing’ as a way for Gaye to reconcile the singer’s own confusion between pleasure and pain dating back to Gaye’s childhood. Frankie Gaye, Marvin’s younger brother, contends that Marvin came up with the title himself though it was based on Ritz’s remarks to the singer that “not only are you sexy, your music is healing.” Although footage survives of Marvin Gaye performing songs in concert or in television appearances, ‘Sexual Healing’ appears to be the only song of his for which a music video was created. This helps ensure the song is played on the relatively new television cable network MTV which plays non-stop music videos. The MTV exposure also aids the commercial fortunes of ‘Sexual Healing’. The song is described as ‘the biggest hit of Gaye’s long and erratic career.’ This is surely an exaggeration since Marvin Gaye has three U.S. no. 1 singles to his credit (‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine’, ‘Let’s Get It On’ and ‘Got To Give It Up (Part 1)’) and ‘Sexual Healing’ only makes it no. 3 on the U.S. pop chart. It is certainly one of Gaye’s biggest hits – and his all-time biggest hit in Australia. The next most successful song from ‘Midnight Love’ is ‘My Love Is Waiting’ (UK no. 34). This track has a very similar feel to ‘Sexual Healing’. ‘My Love Is Waiting’ is a buoyant, sexy and soulful piece. It is written by guitarist Gordon Banks. Two more tracks from ‘Midnight Love’ are issued as singles, but neither of them sells well enough to be a pop hit. Both ‘Til Tomorrow’ and ‘Joy’ are penned by Marvin Gaye. ‘Til Tomorrow’ sounds like the meeting place between electro synth-pop and doo wop. It is a subdued plea for a lover to stay. ‘Joy’ is vibrant with a full-on sound sprinkled with rattling rhythm guitar, popping bass and a horn section. It is about joy in many different forms but perhaps the most significant is the one it concludes with: “The joy of lovin’ you, baby.” ‘Midnight Love’ is, arguably, the ‘most successful album of Gaye’s entire career.’ Splitting from Motown and moving to CBS was a risky move, but Marvin Gaye emerges ‘triumphant.’\n\nIn the 1980s Marvin Gaye’s relationship with his first wife, Anna Gordy, improves. Although they do not reconcile as a romantic couple, the pair become friends once again.\n\nIn December 1982 Marvin Gaye tells an interviewer, “I don’t make records for pleasure. I did when I was a younger artist, but I don’t today. I record so that I can feed people what they need, what they feel. Hopefully, I record so that I can help someone overcome a bad time.”\n\nMarvin Gaye’s re"
