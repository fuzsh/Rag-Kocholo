Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations is the Keynote Speaker for the Gala. JuJu Chang, Co-Anchor, ABC News’ Nightline and Michael Kim, Host/Anchor of 120 Sports are the emcees for the evening’s festivities.\n\nKen Jeong, one of the most notable Korean Americans on TV and film, is also a passionate health advocate who publicly speaks about his family’s journey as his wife battled breast cancer.\n\nKACF’s interview with Ken Jeong.\n\nKACF: What excites you about being the Honoree of the KACF Annual Gala?\n\nJeong: I’m incredibly honored to be a part of KACF’s Gala this year and to support an amazing organization that’s making a difference in the lives of so many individuals and families. It’s exciting to see how Korean Americans in New York are using their philanthropy to help lift up not just their own community but all New Yorkers. I’m really looking forward to celebrating with everyone on November 11th!\n\nKACF: You were actually a medical doctor before you switched to acting. Now you’re playing a doctor on your own ABC comedy show, Dr. Ken. Does this feel like you’ve come full circle?\n\nJeong: It’s an amazing opportunity to star in Dr. Ken and my entire cast and I are working really hard to make it a success. My first big break was playing the doctor in the movie Knocked Up that delivered Katherine Heigl’s baby. But before that, I was really happy practicing medicine. Internal medicine was my specialty but I always had a passion for stand-up comedy and performing. It was good side gig to blow off steam. Instead of playing golf like other doctors, I did comedy.\n\nKACF: You are famous for your acting and comedic talents but you’ve also been an outspoken health advocate.\n\nJeong: My wife was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer several years ago. I’m so happy to say that today she is cancer free. As a medical doctor and as a husband of a former cancer patient, I understand the need to advocate for screenings and the support that families need to battle health adversities together. One of the things that impressed me about KACF is that the foundation is promoting health equities in Asian American communities.\n\nIt’s an amazing opportunity to star in Dr. Ken and my entire cast and I are working really hard to make it a success.

Her favorite roles include “Juliet” in Romeo and Juliet at the Cleveland Playhouse and “Connie” in A Chorus Line on Broadway. Together with Obie award winner, Ching Valdes-Aran, Ms. Murakoshi has performed her own past work at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where she was short-listed for Best Actor for her role as “Helen” in Slippery When Wet (SWW). She has appeared in the films Bill Murray’s Quick Change, Oliver Stone’s Wall Street and Mario Van Peebles’ New Jack City.\n\nMs. Murakoshi received an MFA from the NYC New School of Drama in Playwriting and Acting. She also attended Oxford University, Balliol College, with the British American Drama Academy. Her work has been produced at the Penumbra Theatre in Minneapolis, MN to critical acclaim. Other produced plays include Slippery When Wet at La MaMa Experimental Theatre, Sisters at Circle in the Square Downtown, NYC. Her short play, Dunno, Gotta Go was accepted and given a reading at the Edward Albee Theatre Conference in Valdez, Alaska, 2004.\n\nMs. Murakoshi has worked with the 52nd Street Project in New York City for many years as a writer, actor and director. While there, she co-wrote short plays with ‘Genius Award” fellow, Willie Reale as well as having been directed as an actor by Oscar winner Frances McDormand.\n\nAfter many years of navigating her multiple careers in Manhattan, she now splits her time between two islands – Honolulu and New York where she has established a business in body work. Her current clients include several heiresses, Isabella Gucci and Crystal Audigierre, Tony winner Ruthie Ann Miles, Tony nominee Geneva Carr, fashion icon Emily Lemer. She has also worked on Reed Birney, Willy Reale, Ching Valdes-Aran and J. Elaine Marcos.\n\nOn Monday, December 14th, she returns to New York to teach her ‘Hands and Feet’ workshop at Antigravity Fitness New York in the Antigravity Training Lab, 265 West 37th Street, Suite 1100 (1:15 – 2pm). Click here for more information and to RSVP.\n\nChristopher Harrison, the founder of Anti-Gravity Yoga, is also a former Broadway dancer. Harrison and Murakoshi both performed in A Chorus Line around the same time, but in different productions around the world. The aerial hammock technique, Anti-Gravity, which he created, is for the general public to experience weightlessness, flight, and zero-compression inversions. In fact, after the lyricist Stephen Schwartz saw Christopher’s Anti-Gravity company, he composed, “Defying Gravity” for the musical, Wicked.\n\nWe caught up last week over lunch and chatted about her body work, her love of clowning and what it is like to be bi-island.\n\nLia: How long have you been doing body work?\n\nSuzen: I’ve been pursuing it for ten years since I met Yamuna Zake at her flagship studio on Perry Street. But, as a dancer, I’ve been doing it my whole life.\n\nI love working on performers because they know their bodies so well, and immediately get the concepts of bone stimulation, alignment and necessity of releasing jaw/mouth/tongue tension. Yamuna’s work is based on these concepts. There is also a supportive body rolling technique with Italian-made balls of varying sizes to allow us to do the work on ourselves at anytime, anywhere.\n\nLia: How are you navigating being bi-island?\n\nSuzen: The sharing of visuals, ideas and communication is easy online. But, theatre needs to be done in the flesh. Energies, smells, and touch must be done in person. Crossing the Pacific and the continent between Honolulu and Manhattan, has become my commute. In fact, I taught a workshop at the Honolulu Club called, “Yamuna On the Go/Travel.” I shared my travel tips using Yamuna’s body rolling on the plane, while sitting. I’m now able to handle any long haul. Using the balls to roll up the spine, down the legs, and into the shoulders keeps my body free whenever I land. Other secrets I shared were: castor oil as a go-to moisturizer for coating my skin everywhere. And, playing with the body’s work of digestion in setting my body clock. I make sure I eat well, control it, and set my internal clock to the destination, 24 hours before flying, and live accordingly.\n\nLia: How did you become interested in clowning?\n\nSuzen: Michael Howard, one of my acting teachers, was adamant that all actors should learn physical comedy/clowning. My collaborator/director, Ching Valdes-Aran also highly recommended that all actors should learn clowning after she studied with Christopher Bayes (Yale, Julliard, NYU). So, I did. At first, a weekend workshop with Chris Bayes, here and there. Clowning teaches performers to be the most authentic, honest and in the moment at all times. This is basic acting, however, there is no script! It was terrifying. And, that’s why I now am involved with it; because it’s so frightening. I also now understand the value of the work. Like a snowball gathering momentum, I’m rolling downhill with it. In fact, I’m bringing Aitor Basauri, another master clown teacher to Honolulu in March. And, plan on learning from the expert, Philippe Gaulier, in Paris next summer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPhotos: Breathe Love Repeat – In Rehearsal with Suzen Murakoshi and Ching Valdes-Aran at Under St. Mark’s\n\nSuzen Murakoshi is a “Samurai Super Daughter” in her solo show BREATHE LOVE REPEAT\n\nSuzen Murakoshi’s Breathe Love Repeat: a near-life experience, directed by Ching Valdes-Aran, at 2012 Frigid New York Festival at Under St. Marks\n\nSuzen Murakoshi’s Breathe Love Repeat: a near-life experience, at 2012 Frigid New York Festival at Under St. Marks\n\nSuzen Murakoshi’s Breathe Love Repeat: a Near Life Experience, at 30th Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival, 8/11-8/20/11\n\nSnowboarder Suzen Murakoshi to Debut Tale of Unconditional Love at Calgary Fringe Festival, 7/29-8/5/11\n\nLia Chang is an award-winning filmmaker, a Best Actress nominee, a photographer, and an award-winning multi-platform journalist.

The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the Nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. The awards will be presented at the White House on November 24th.\n\nPresident Obama said, “I look forward to presenting these 17 distinguished Americans with our nation’s highest civilian honor. From public servants who helped us meet defining challenges of our time to artists who expanded our imaginations, from leaders who have made our union more perfect to athletes who have inspired millions of fans, these men and women have enriched our lives and helped define our shared experience as Americans.”\n\nThe following individuals will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom:\n\nMinoru Yasui (posthumous)\n\nMinoru Yasui was a civil and human rights leader known for his continuous defense of the ideals of democracy embodied in our Constitution. A graduate of the University of Oregon School of Law, Yasui challenged the constitutionality of a military curfew order during World War II on the grounds of racial discrimination, and spent nine months in solitary confinement during the subsequent legal battle. In 1943, the Supreme Court upheld the military curfew order. Yasui spent the rest of his life appealing his wartime conviction. At the time of his death in 1986, he had successfully convinced a trial court to vacate his arrest, and a case challenging the constitutionality of his conviction was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Yasui also spent his life fighting for the human and civil rights of all people.\n\nYogi Berra (posthumous)\n\nYogi Berra spent over 40 years as a professional baseball catcher, manager, and coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest catchers in baseball history – and an all-time Yankee great – Berra was an 18-time All-Star and 10-time World Series Champion who was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. Always quick witted, Berra was famous for his “Yogi-isms,” teaching us all that we can observe a lot just by watching. Berra was also a lifelong ambassador for inclusion in sports. Berra put his professional career on hold to join the Navy during World War II, where he fought with Allied forces on D-Day and eventually earned a Purple Heart.\n\nBonnie Carroll\n\nBonnie Carroll is a life-long public servant who has devoted her life to caring for our military and veterans. After her husband, Brigadier General Tom Carroll, died in an Army C-12 plane crash in 1992, Carroll founded the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), which provides comprehensive support to those impacted by the death of their military hero, bringing healing comfort and compassionate care to the living legacies of our nation’s service and sacrifice. Carroll is also a retired Major in the Air Force Reserve. She serves on the Defense Health Board, and co-chaired the Department of Defense Task Force on the Prevention of Suicide in the Armed Forces.\n\nShirley Chisholm (posthumous)\n\nShirley Chisholm made history in 1968 by becoming the first African-American woman elected to Congress, beginning the first of seven terms in the House of Representatives.

She was a champion of minority education and employment opportunities throughout her tenure in Congress. After leaving Congress in 1983, Chisolm taught at Mount Holyoke College and frequently lectured and gave speeches at colleges and universities throughout the country.\n\nEmilio Estefan\n\nEmilio Estefan is a passionate and visionary music producer, entrepreneur, author, and songwriter who has won nineteen Grammy Awards and influenced a generation of artists.

Frank led effective “fish-ins,” which were modeled after sit-ins of the civil rights movement, during the tribal “fish wars” of the 1960s and 1970s. His magnetic personality and tireless advocacy over more than five decades made him a revered figure both domestically and abroad. Frank was the recipient of many awards, including the Martin Luther King, Jr. Distinguished Service Award for Humanitarian Achievement.
