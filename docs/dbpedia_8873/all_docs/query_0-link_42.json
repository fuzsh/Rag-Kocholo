Drawing from both his extensive jazz influences and his rich cultural heritage, the Indonesian maestro delivers yet another spellbinding masterwork!\n\nBrimming with adventurous compositions, ingenious arrangements and superlative performances, “Rumah Batu”(meaning “the stone house” in Indonesian Bahasa language) almost defies categorization – eclipsing both progressive jazz and world music genres. While a score of diverse ethnic flavors abound throughout, within its nucleus resides the free-spirited, unpretentious essence that epitomizes the greatest jazz.\n\nAugmented by a stellar cast of players, vastly international in scope – including: the enigmatic French virtuoso, of Vietnamese descent, Nguyên Lê, on guitar; legendary flamenco fretless bassist, Spain’s Carles Benavent; the extraordinary flutist, also from Indonesia, Sa’at Syah, and; the proven progressive backbone of fellow Israeli-born, UK transplants, Yaron Stavi [on upright bass (yes: the album features twin basses!)] and (supreme drummer) Asaf Sirkis – this landmark recording offers an intimate glimpse into Dwiki’s unparalleled genius as player, arranger and songwriter.\n\nThe album chronicles yet another magical session created and captured at the already-infamous La Casa Murada. Situated in the tranquil, picturesque setting of the Catalonian wine region of Penedès, Spain, the studio’s recordings seem to take on a life of their own; and Rumah Batu is certainly no exception: articulating jazz’s continuing evolution in the 21st century.\n\nFor those who wondered what Messenger Dharmawan could possibly conjur as a follow-up to Rumah Batu’s unanimously praised predecessor, prepare to be amazed and perplexed – and escorted on a musical sojourn unlike any the genre has ever witnessed!\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Robinson, Positive Feedback, Issue 52\n\n“…mastered from the original three-track work tapes is a sonic spectacular that outdoes the original by a wide margin – as does its packaging. The SACD includes three-channel and two-channel mixes. A major reissue.” Stereophile Records To Die For – Michael Fremer, Stereophile, February 2010\n\nThis has been a totally no-expenses-spared project. Using the original three-track work tapes from Capitol’s vaults, mastering engineers Kevin Gray and Steve Hoffman along with DSD specialist Gus Skinas bring you an entirely incomparable SACD experience. In addition to the stereo mixes, this SACD includes a three-track transfer for multichannel playback. In order to master from the three-track masters, AcousTech had to be outfitted for three-channel playback. That meant Kevin Gray had to find a third identical monitoring channel chain (including mixing board, amplifier and speaker) as well as a three-track playback headstack and also a three-track preview head for the vinyl cutting system. It was a massive assignment. We’ve spent a fortune to include these extra bells and whistles and to make this a truly historic reissue.\n\nThis double CD finds Cole revisiting his earlier hits with new versions. The 36 selections mostly focus on his pop successes of the 1950s, although there are a few wistful looks back at his trio days. Not as essential as the original renditions of these popular recordings, the remakes nevertheless find Cole in peak form and comprise a highly enjoyable retrospective of his vocal career.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 – Straighten Up And Fly Right\n\n02 – Sweet Lorraine\n\n03 – It’s Only A Paper Moon\n\n04 – (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66\n\n05 – (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\n\n06 – The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)\n\n07 – Nature Boy\n\n08 – Lush Life\n\n09 – Calypso Blues\n\n10 – Mona Lisa\n\n11 – Orange Colored Sky\n\n12 – Too Young\n\n13 – Unforgettable\n\n14 – Somewhere Along The Way\n\n15 – Walkin’ My Baby Back Home\n\n16 – Pretend\n\n17 – Blue Gardenia\n\n18 – I Am In Love\n\n19 – Answer Me, My Love\n\n21 – Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup\n\n22 – The Sand And The Sea\n\n23 – If I May\n\n24 – A Blossom Fell\n\n25 – To The Ends Of The Earth\n\n26 – Night Lights\n\n27 – Ballerina\n\n28 – Stardust\n\n29 – Send For Me\n\n30 – St. Louis Blues\n\n31 – Looking Back\n\n32 – Non Dimenticar (Don’t Forget)\n\n33 – Paradise\n\n34 – Oh, Mary, Don’t You Weep\n\n35 – Ay, Cosita Linda\n\n36 – Wild Is Love\n\n37 – Ramblin’ Rose\n\n38 – Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days Of Summer\n\nDownload:\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheNatKingCleStry1961DSD64.part1.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheNatKingCleStry1961DSD64.part2.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheNatKingCleStry1961DSD64.part3.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheNatKingCleStry1961DSD64.part4.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheNatKingCleStry1961DSD64.part5.rar\n\nPat Metheny – Bright Size Life (1976) [Japan 2017]\n\nDSF Stereo DSD64/2.82 MHz | Time – 36:58 minutes | 1,74 GB\n\nPat Metheny’s debut studio album is a good one, a trio date that finds him already laying down the distinctively cottony, slightly withdrawn tone and asymmetrical phrasing that would serve him well through most of the swerves in direction ahead. His original material, all of it lovely, bears the bracing air of his Midwestern upbringing, with titles like “Missouri Uncompromised,” “Midwestern Nights Dream,” and “Omaha Celebration.” There is also a sole harbinger of radical matters way down the road with the inclusion of a loose-jointed treatment of Ornette Coleman’s “Round Trip/Broadway Blues,” proving that Song X did not come from totally out of the blue. Besides being Metheny’s debut, this LP also features one of the earliest recordings of Jaco Pastorius, a fully formed, well-matched contrapuntal force on electric bass, though content to leave the spotlight mostly to Metheny. Bob Moses, who like Metheny played in the Gary Burton Quintet at the time, is the drummer, and he can mix it up, too.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Bright Size Life\n\n02. Sirabhorn\n\n03.

For many, Modern Cool is the record that brought Patricia Barber to their attention. Its success with critics and jazz fans led Blue Note Records to enter into a “joint imprint” production deal with Premonition Records, the first time they had ever done such a deal in their storied history. Done on the Sony 3348, a 32-track (16/48) digital tape recorder, and mixed down to 2-track, half-inch tape with Dolby SR, this was Barber’s first album of mostly original material. Anderson utilized mostly tube microphones (Brauner and Neumann) and John Hardy M-1 preamps, whose signal was patched to the tape bypassing the console.\n\nAnalog 2-track mixes transferred to 24/192 kHz by Doug Sax. Converted to DSD from the 24/192 by Gus Skinas.\n\nFive Stars! – DownBeat Magazine\n\n“This is the kind of art we should all pay close attention to, the 21st century has started.” – The New York Times\n\n“One of the best jazz records of the 20th century.” – AUDIO Magazine (Germany)\n\nGrammy Award winner for “Best Surround Sound Album” (2013)\n\nA Stereophile Recording of the Month!\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 – Touch Of Trash\n\n02 – Winter\n\n03 – You & The Night & The Music\n\n04 – Constantinople\n\n05 – Light My Fire\n\n06 – Silent Partner\n\n07 – Company\n\n08 – Let It Rain\n\n09 – She’s A Lady\n\n10 – Love, Put On Your Faces\n\n11 – Postmodern Blues\n\n12 – Let It Rain – Vamp\n\nDownload:\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberMdernCl1998DSD64.part1.rar\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberMdernCl1998DSD64.part2.rar\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberMdernCl1998DSD64.part3.rar\n\nPatricia Barber – NightClub (2000/2004)\n\nDSF Stereo DSD64/2.82 MHz | Time – 57:34 minutes | 2,03 GB | Genre: Jazz\n\nStudio Masters, Official Digital Download – Source: AcousticSounds | Front Cover | © Premonition\n\nNightclub was recorded at Chicago Recording Company in mid-2000 by recording engineer Jim Anderson. Done on the Sony 3348, a 32-track (16/48) digital tape recorder, and mixed down to 2-track, half-inch analog tape with Dolby SR, this was Barber’s first album consisting entirely of standards. Anderson utilized mostly tube microphones (Brauner and Neumann) and John Hardy M-1 preamps, whose signal was patched directly to the tape bypassing the console. Nightclub also prominently features the CRC stairwell as a natural reverb chamber. The album was mastered by David Glasser of Airshow Mastering from the original analog mixes.\n\nFrom the very begining of her career, devoted fans were asking Patricia Barber to dedicate a record to standards. “These songs have always been a part of my repertoire and are a big part of who I am, but I wanted to try and define myself in a different way before making a record like this,” says Barber. It is hard to argue with her approach. Armed with a press kit to die for, strong national radio support and two Top 10 Billboard Jazz recordings in a row, the timing couldn’t have been better for one of her most accessible records. Fans will recognize and appreciate that within simple approaches, Barber maintains her fierce individuality. Jazz vocal traditionalists will hear an astonishing voice inside well-known melodies, giving itself over to the song. And, aficionados of the American popular songbook cannot help but appreciate hearing their music given by one of the most expressive voices in contemporary music.\n\n“Throaty, come-hither vocals and cooly incisive piano. Barber’s hushed, sensuous version of ‘Bye Bye Blackbird,’ hasn’t been bettered since Miles Davis last took the old standby out for a spin.” — Time\n\n“Nightclub is an extraordinary recording by an extraordinary artist.” — Stereophile\n\n“A singer who takes romance seriously.” — The New York Times\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 – Bye Bye Blackbird\n\n02 – Invitation\n\n03 – Yesterdays\n\n04 – Just For A Thrill\n\n05 – You Don’t Know Me\n\n07 – Autumn Leaves\n\n08 – Summer Samba (Samba de Vero)\n\n09 – All Or Nothing At All\n\n10 – So In Love\n\n11 – A Man & A Woman\n\n12 – I Fall In Love Too Easily\n\nDownload:\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberNightclub2000DSD64.part1.rar\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberNightclub2000DSD64.part2.rar\n\nmqs.link_PatriciaBarberNightclub2000DSD64.part3.rar\n\nNat King Cole – The Very Thought of You (1958/2010)\n\nDSF Stereo DSD64/2.82 MHz | Time – 01:52:13 minutes | 4,4 GB | Genre: Jazz\n\nStudio Masters, Official Digital Download – Source: AcousticSounds | Booklet, Front Cover | © Analogue Productions\n\n“…if you haven’t picked up every one of the Blue Note and Nat King Cole reissues from Chad Kassem and company at Acoustic Sounds, you’re really missing out!” – David W. Robinson, Positive Feedback, Issue 52\n\n“…exquisite standards, Gordon Jenkins and his orchestra, and that achingly beautiful Capitol sound…this disc’s multiple layers offer mono, stereo and three-channel.” Sound Quality = 92% out of 100% – Ken Kessler, HiFi News, January 2011\n\n“…Thanks to the gorgeous remastering and improved quality afforded by the format, you’ll hear every breath, as if you were in the studio alongside Cole himself during a recording session.” – The Second Disc, December 2010\n\nNat King Cole possessed one of the most accessible and appealing voices of any singer in the 1950s. This ballad-oriented set puts the emphasis completely on his voice (there is no piano playing or any hint of his jazz-oriented past) and features Cole accompanied by Gordon Jenkins’ sweet arrangements for a string orchestra. Many other singers might find it difficult to overcome, much less uplift this type of accompaniment, but Cole’s basic and honest delivery works quite well in this setting. Highlights include “The Very Thought of You,” “But Beautiful,” “This Is All I Ask,” “For All We Know,” and “The More I See You.” ~~ AllMusic Review by Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 – The Very Thought Of You (stereo)\n\n02 – But Beautiful (stereo)\n\n03 – Impossible (stereo)\n\n04 – I Wish I Knew The Way To Your Heart (stereo)\n\n05 – I Found A Million Dollar Baby (In A Five And Ten Cent Store) (stereo)\n\n06 – Magnificent Obsession (stereo)\n\n07 – My Heart Tells Me (stereo)\n\n08 – Paradise (stereo)\n\n09 – This Is All I Ask (stereo)\n\n10 – Cherie, I Love You (stereo)\n\n11 – Making Believe You’re Here (stereo)\n\n12 – Cherchez La Femme (stereo)\n\n13 – For All We Know (stereo)\n\n14 – The More I See You (stereo)\n\n15 – Don’t Blame Me (stereo)\n\n16 – There Is No Greater Love (stereo)\n\n17 – The Very Thought Of You (mono)\n\n18 – But Beautiful (mono)\n\n19 – Impossible (mono)\n\n20 – I Wish I Knew The Way To Your Heart (mono)\n\n21 – I Found A Million Dollar Baby (In A Five And Ten Cent Store) (mono)\n\n22 – Magnificent Obsession (mono)\n\n23 – My Heart Tells Me (mono)\n\n24 – Paradise (mono)\n\n25 – This Is All I Ask (mono)\n\n26 – Cherie, I Love You (mono)\n\n27 – Making Believe You’re Here (mono)\n\n28 – Cherchez La Femme (mono)\n\n29 – For All We Know (mono)\n\n30 – The More I See You (mono)\n\n31 – Don’t Blame Me (mono)\n\n32 – There Is No Greater Love (mono)\n\nDownload:\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheVeryThughtfYu1958DSD64.part1.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheVeryThughtfYu1958DSD64.part2.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheVeryThughtfYu1958DSD64.part3.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheVeryThughtfYu1958DSD64.part4.rar\n\nmqs.link_NatKingCleTheVeryThughtfYu1958DSD64.part5.rar\n\nKazuki Yamada, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande – Russian Dances (2016)\n\nDSF Stereo DSD64/2.82 MHz | Time – 01:10:44 minutes | 2,8 GB | Genre: Classical\n\nStudio Masters, Official Digital Download – Source: nativeDSDmusic | Digital Bookelt, Front Cover | © Pentatone\n\nIn an ideal situation, football players perform their “dance” on a grass pitch — as once did the “white ballet” of Real Madrid, led by its soloists Pusks and Di Stfano. But surely not on the ballet stage! Definitely not. However, not only was Dmitri Shostakovich (1906 — 1975) passionate about music, he was also a great football fan. More specifically, a fan of his hometown club Zenit St. Petersburg. The Russian language has a more intense description for the concept of the “fan” — one is considered “bolejet” (literally = ill) for one’s team: one shares the fever. And as a fan of Zenit, Shostakovich had his fair share of downright hard times: “Being a supporter is at times more frustrating than pleasurable.” He was often a guest at the stadium: even when Leningrad was under siege from the German army, he attended lower-league matches whenever possible. In 1929, Shostakovich composed his first, three-act ballet to a scenic design by film director Alexander Ivanovsky. Entitled The Golden Age, it portrays an away-game of a Soviet football team in an unnamed western city at the time of an industrial exhibition. During the away-game of the Soviet team, plenty of bizarre events take place in the ideologically “false” world, which allow for the inclusion of numerous dance interludes and parodies\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 – Swan Lake Suite, Op. 20a, TH 219 – I.

It is Eurythmics’ best-selling studio album. It reached the top 3 in the UK and top 10 in the US, as well as spawning several hit singles. The album included the duo’s first (and only) UK number-one “There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)” and the Australian number-one hit “Would I Lie to You?”.\n\n“Casting off their rep for digital iciness, the Eurythmics got Be Yourself Tonight over on electric fire and the fluttering warmth of Annie Lennox’s voice; the first two seconds of “There Must Be an Angel” are the prettiest seconds ever recorded. In fact, it’s essentially a deep soul album in white-English-geek drag, from the Stax horns of “Would I Lie to You” to the guest shots by Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder to Lennox and Elvis Costello doing their best Marvin and Tammi impression on “Adrian.” But the style points wouldn’t matter without great songs and this disc has some of the band’s finest: the best feminist anthem ever written, rockers that dig their heels in deep, and love songs fueled by real longing and joy.” (Douglas Wolk)\n\n“On Be Yourself Tonight, Eurythmics’ most commercially successful and hit-laden album, the duo meticulously blended the new wave electronic elements that dominated their previous sets with the harder straight-edged rock and soul that would dominate later sets to come up with a near-perfect pop album. This disc scored no less than four hit singles and kept them a mainstay on MTV’s play lists during the channel’s heyday. Fusing pop, soul, rock, electronic beats, and even gospel, this is arguably the duo’s finest moment. The first hit, “Would I Lie to You,” is a straight-forward rocker, complete with great guitar licks, a soulful horn section, and Annie Lennox sounding as vicious and vivacious as ever. The second single, which was a huge chart topper in Europe, “There Must Be an Angel,” is nothing short of shimmering beauty, with Lennox providing truly angelic vocals and Stevie Wonder lending an enchanting harmonica solo. Aretha Franklin lends her powerhouse pipes for the duet “Sisters Are Doin’ It for Themselves,” which has gone on to become an immortal feminist anthem. From the soulful electronic beats (a rarity) in “It’s Alright (Baby’s Coming Back)” to the beauty of the Elvis Costello duet “Adrian” to the pain and longing of the sorrowful rocker “Better to Have Lost in Love (Than Never to Have Loved at All),” this album runs a wide array of musical styles, each song standing tall on its own two feet. This disc is, without a doubt, one of the best rock/pop albums from the 1980s and one of the grandest, most creative albums delivered by the ever-appealing and innovative duo of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart. A true classic.”\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Would I Lie to You? (2018 Remastered) 04:25\n\n2. There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart) [2018 Remastered] 05:22\n\n3.

The album contains one of their biggest hits “Missionary Man”, which hit number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. The British duo Eurythmics were a force on the Billboard charts throughout the ’80s, as their quirky electro-pop resonated with music fans.\n\nRevenge brought Eurythmics full circle, back to Wolperath, Germany and the studio of German producer Conny Plank, best known for helming albums by Kraftwerk and other “krautock” groups in the ’70s. Plank had produced Eurythmics’ first album,’ In the Garden’. “ We went back to the same equipment on a farm in the middle of the German countryside,” says Dave Stewart. “We made an album that kept Eurythmic’s quirkiness but had a big sound. Songs such as “Thorn in My Side,” “Missionary Man” and “When Tomorrow Comes” were anthemic, which really suited our live performances. We were playing huge arenas all over the world. By the time we arrived at “Revenge”, we had a body of 12 to 15 hits and were popular in places we had never even heard of.” “The Miracle of Love” from the album, became a classic healing song and the closing number of Eurythmics Revenge World Tour.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

It’s the story of two Toms. The first, Dvorak, a.k.a. Floex, is a producer from Prague. The second, Hodge, is a British pianist and clarinettist, who also works with machines. Following a chance encounter in the German capital, Hodge started remixing Floex, and one thing leading to another, they decided to work on this ambitious project of combining their machines with the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra’s instruments. Despite having radically different values, classical and electronic music have, in recent years, had several occasions to meet, often with techno artists from Detroit: Derrick May and Francesco Tristano revisiting the founding hit song Strings of Life, Derrick May once again with the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra, Jeff Mills and the orchestras of Montpellier, Lille, Lyon, and most recently Toulouse, Carl Craig with the symphonic orchestra Les Siècles on the album Versusreleased by InFiné in 2017… If the latter is most likely the most refined example (let’s leave the unique Nils Frahm out of this), Floex and Tom Hodge’s album pushes the symbiosis between organic and synthetic even further, reaching an unparalleled level of detail, with ultra-refined structures. This Portrait of John Doe feels like a movie soundtrack (Tom Hodge composed McMafia for the BBC TV show and often works for ads and film trailers): the dreamlike Inauguration of Nobodyis reminiscent of Cliff Martinez’s work on the soundtrack of Solaris, but the most striking about this album is the ease with which piano and synthetic bass, percussions and rhythm box reply to each other and interlace, like on Wednesday (Is the New Friday), highlighting exceptional arrangements. Let’s wish good luck to anyone willing to take up the torch… – Smaël Bouaici\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Inauguration Of Nobody 06:17\n\n2. Wednesday (Is The New Friday) 05:37\n\n3.

It was crowned with the production of the C major Concerto, K. 503, and the “Prague” Symphony. This concerto is the last of the series in C major, and combines with its companion K. 491 in C minor, which in turn succeeded the A major K. 488, to make a trilogy that has been likened to the three great symphonies of two years later. Whatever the family similarities between the other pieces may be, there is no doubt that the C major Concerto, like the C major Symphony, show Mozart glorying in the complete mastery of means and offering a certain Olympian grandeur that at the same time does not exclude his more tender, eloquent vein.\n\nIts first moment is the most grand and heroic, as is evident from its very opening bars, and it is conceived on a scale that goes beyond anything even Mozart had written until then. If Beethoven’s first two concertos are often described as Mozartian, this one by Mozart can truly be said to look forward to the younger composer’s music but the “advanced” nature of the writing in this opening movement does not exclude subsidiary ideas in Mozart’s sweetest, most feminine1 vein. The development is of a size to match the prodigality of material in the exposition.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Piano Concerto No.25 in C, K.503 : 1. Allegro maestoso – Cadenza: Friedrich Gulda 16:27\n\n2.

In the first-movement introduction Szell achieves authentic-performance-style clarity yet maintains a welcome solidity of orchestral tone (without becoming weighty) before springing zestfully into the allegro proper. Only the finale, although done with much finesse and polish, sounds a bit restrained compared to the quicksilver renditions of Harnoncourt and Gardiner.\n\nSzell’s Pastorale is one of the great recordings, full of feeling and sinuous beauty. The first movement glides on one sustained breath, the Scene by the Brook soars gently, the storm surges powerfully (with ideally balanced timpani), and the finale shines brightly due to the ringing playing of the Cleveland strings. Like Bernstein, Szell milks the great final climax for all its emotional worth. But there’s still more: a positively gripping–and ferociously played–account of the Egmont overture follows. Szell heightens the drama right from the terse opening bars on through to the passionate and triumphant close. The remastered 1960s recordings capture the full bloom of the Severance Hall acoustic. This one’s a classic, and you should have it.” (Victor Carr Jr, ClassicsToday)\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Symphony No. 6 in F Major, Op. 68 “Pastoral” : I. Allegro ma non troppo 09:56\n\n2.

Right in the midst of this movement, there was Grateful Dead. Proper hippies with electric guitars, soaked in hallucinogenic drugs, blossoming in an exuberant counterculture, and whose cornerstone was a psychedelic mix of musical genres. Blues, rock, country and sixties pop, a proper hotchpotch that hasn’t gone any bad in half a century. The Dead are still partying and releasing a remastered version of Anthem Of The Sun (50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition), their second album from 1968. The one that introduced their second drummer Mickey Hart. At that time, the band featured Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Ron McKernan, Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann. The album includes two versions of the original Anthem of the Sun, with titles from 1968 as well as better-known mixes from 1961, remastered by David Glasser. It’s a rather rare occurrence for an album to combine several studio and live recordings of each song. It is without a doubt Grateful Dead’s most interesting and exciting work to listen to. With some titles exceeding the ten-minute mark, recording medleys and a previously unreleased recording of their concert at Winterland on October 22nd, 1967, this album truly feels like a landmark. New Potato Caboose, It Hurts Me Too, That’s It For The Other One, the versions are clearly different. Bill Kreutzmann described the album with these words: “It was easily our most experimental record, it was ground-breaking in its time and it remains a psychedelic listening experience to this day.” A whole era is brought back to life and we’d love to be back 50 years to witness the spectacle of Grateful Dead on stage. – Anna Coluthe\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

It was released on July 21, 1987, by Geffen Records to massive commercial success. It topped the Billboard 200 and became the best-selling debut album as well as the 11th best-selling album in the United States. With about 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time. Although critics were ambivalent toward the album when it was first released, Appetite for Destruction has since received retrospective acclaim and been viewed as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nFollowing the group’s 1985 formation, Guns N’ Roses injected unbridled attitude into the burgeoning Los Angeles rock scene. They went on to captivate the entire world with the July 21, 1987 release of Appetite For Destruction, which remains the best-selling U.S. debut album ever, moving over 30 million copies globally. Appetite features such indelible tracks such as the No. 1 single “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” “Welcome To The Jungle,” “Nightrain,” and “Paradise City.”\n\nThe Appetite For Destruction: Super Deluxe Edition features four albums including the album newly remastered for the first time ever; B-sides N’ EPs newly remastered; the previously unreleased 1986 Sound City Session N’ More recordings; including bonus tracks.\n\nRolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time – Rated 62/500!\n\nGuns N’ Roses’ debut, Appetite for Destruction was a turning point for hard rock in the late ’80s — it was a dirty, dangerous, and mean record in a time when heavy metal meant nothing but a good time. On the surface, Guns N’ Roses may appear to celebrate the same things as their peers — namely, sex, liquor, drugs, and rock & roll — but there is a nasty edge to their songs, since Axl Rose doesn’t see much fun in the urban sprawl of L.A. and its parade of heavy metal thugs, cheap women, booze, and crime. The music is as nasty as the lyrics, wallowing in a bluesy, metallic hard rock borrowed from Aerosmith, AC/DC, and countless faceless hard rock bands of the early ’80s. It’s a primal, sleazy sound that adds grit to already grim tales. It also makes Rose’s misogyny, fear, and anger hard to dismiss as merely an artistic statement; this is music that sounds lived-in. And that’s exactly why Appetite for Destruction is such a powerful record — not only does Rose have fears, but he also is vulnerable, particularly on the power ballad “Sweet Child O’ Mine.” He also has a talent for conveying the fears and horrors of the decaying inner city, whether it’s on the charging “Welcome to the Jungle,” the heroin ode “Mr. Brownstone,” or “Paradise City,” which simply wants out. But as good as Rose’s lyrics and screeching vocals are, they wouldn’t be nearly as effective without the twin-guitar interplay of Slash and Izzy Stradlin, who spit out riffs and solos better than any band since the Rolling Stones, and that’s what makes Appetite for Destruction the best metal record of the late ’80s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 1 – Appetite For Destruction: Remastered\n\n01.
