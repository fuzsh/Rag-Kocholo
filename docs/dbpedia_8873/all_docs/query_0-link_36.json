Always a tradition-oriented school, the campus has held on to customs considered stale by some. Practices such as Homecoming, Greek living or just plain school pride were stronger at K-State than perhaps they've ever been before. t ROYAT , Kansas State University PURPT .\"F! 1982 Volume 73 Manhattan, Kansas 66506 Jeff Taylor Traditional path — Fall colors add to the college scenery on the southeast end of campus as a stu- dent heads toward class. opening 1 Tradition Because of its eagerness to cling to traditional values, K-State's stability and maturity has often been confused with being unprogressive or even reactionary. It is a paradox that K-State's conservative image actually feeds off the dynamic individualism of its students and staff. Tradition survives unhampered on the campus because of the inner strength of the individuals on campus. What appears to be a sea of homogenity from the outside is really a collection of individuals who have the inner confidence to operate in a group without losing their own dynamic outlook. Dynamic. Long known for outstanding colleges of engineering, agriculture, veterinary medicine and home economics, some newly discovered programs also brought the University recognition, such as the Division of Biology's cancer research laboratory. t STAND-UP KEYPUNCH. pflASt am tow use ?o 5 CARDS OR 3 tf'V *IE«E FOSK S'MSLE U»f AJk Bugging out — Tim Verbanic, senior in management, and Lemuel Moore, senior in computer science, attempt to debug a computer program at the computer room in Fairchild Hall.

And despite tightened federal and state budgets, K-State actually recorded funding increases from both sources. The KSCJ Foundation received a record $4.4 million in private donations on behalf of the University to help ensure the school's progress in an era of uncertain finances. Individualism marked the record-sized student body of 19,982 which hailed from all 50 states and over 60 foreign countries. Controversy continued because of individual convictions about Iran, Maranatha Christian Ministry and whether to allocate student money toward a new $20 million coliseum. Individual motivation was the key for a mother and housewife to commute from Junction City to complete her degree requirements. It also compelled a marketing major with a part-time job to volunteer his time at the Fone Crisis Center. The individualistic spirit was even seen on a rainy Halloween night in Aggieville. ► Scott Williams Without the big tent — The Royal Lichtenstein Circus drew a large crowd during a noon hour performance in the fall.

Do these phrases seem like a homework assignment in descriptive writing? Or are they ways students elude homework, projects and tests? If you guessed the latter, you have probably felt the pressures of the everyday college routine. Every student experiences the desire to \"Get away from it all.\" The urge to pack up usually occurs after everything gets moved into the room, class schedules are worked out after countless trips to the drop/add line, and the first round of tests are over. Escapes vary from the spontaneous weekend trips home to week-long vacations planned by the Union Programming Council. Trips to the Grand Canyon, Padre Island, Colorado, the Ozarks and other places are sponsored by GPC's Outdoor Recreation Committee or Travel Committee. Wherever the destination, students use trips to get away from the pressures of classes. But taking trips will not solve all of the problems. The homework, projects and tests will all be there when he returns, but at least the trip can postpone the routine for a period of time. \"Getting away from it all\" may need to be amended to read \"Getting away from it all — for awhile.\" ma by Jerry Katlin photos by Rob Clark \"*£ i* ,.iL \"* * \" Mk *** ^Mife'' 11 Another round of threes — \"Threefers.\" a popular Aggie Station feature, keeps Trish Wietecter, sophomore in sociology, busy] delivering drinks. 12 barmaids 'After all, a job's a job, right?' T\"\"Near Linda, ^\"^ Sorry I haven't written in a while, but I have been busy with my new job. Since I know you're standing there, mouth gaping, I'll tell you how it all came about. On a crazy whim, I decided to balance my checkbook. To my surprise I discovered that an emergency student loan can only be stretched so far. So in a desperate attempt to earn some pocket money, I applied for a barmaid job in Aggieville. Don't laugh; the work does have its good points. You get to see a lot of your friends (so what if they're all laughing and drinking while you wipe up a table covered with remains of someone's dinner) and the pay isn't too bad. After all, a job's a job, right? I think that I'm getting the hang of it though. At least 1 can spot the pinchers pretty well. They're usually sitting on the edge of the booth, arms dangling with a glazed look in their eyes. 1 would like to know where my contract states that once I become a waitress, I am suddenly public property. I've learned fast how to maneuver just out of reach while simultaneously carrying two full pitchers and praying that the six-foot fellow in front of me stops swinging his arms in an ape-like fashion. The boss is a pretty nice guy too. He even allows drinking on the job. That is as long as we can still \"perform our duties.\" Even that little incident last week has been forgotten and I think the boss is glad he's given me another chance. Well it's only fair - the floor does get pretty slippery towards the end of the night and it's not as if I spilled that pitcher on his girlfriend purposely. Am I painting a pretty dismal picture of all this? If so, 1 don't mean to. Honestly, 1 think this job is a great learning experience. Maybe its just the old \"tell the bartender syndrome,\" but I've heard enough stories to even make Abbey's ears burn. Then there's the jokes. Some of them are even funny the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth time. Naturally some are rather risque (there's always the excuse that liquor loosens the tongue) and I have no doubt that my terminal blush will soon be cured. At times though 1 can't help but feel as if I am losing my identity. I used to be flattered when guys asked my name, but now 1 know better. In the future I hope to avoid having it screamed at the top of someone's lungs in the middle of a slow song. Last week I was Susan, Tammy, Donna and Flo just to play it safe. While 1 realize I'm no great authority, having only worked a couple of weeks, I've come up with a few \"words of wisdom for the working waitress.\" This is just some advice for those beginning a bar job or even contemplating the idea. 1. Never offer a cute fellow a free beer until you check to see if his girlfriend is standing right behind him. 2. Don't dangle the bar rag out of your back pocket; hold it in your hand. You'd be surprised at the guys that major in \"towel-whipping\" at K-State. 3. Always keep your eyes open. Besides hearing juicy gossip, you can actually become proficient at translating slurred speech. \"Two mugs\" and \"two Buds\" can sound very similar when the speaker is under a table with someone else's foot in his mouth. 4. When taking checks at the bar, just be sure that they've signed it. A current address isn't as important, since most can't remember it when asked anyway. Don't even attempt a phone number. 5. Be sure there is always plenty of popcorn made. Gnawed tables do not go over well with the management. 6. Never tell coworkers your birthday unless you enjoy seeing crude remarks about yourself on the marquis outside the bar. Who knows Linda, if I'd seen a copy of these beforehand I might not be where 1 am today, but 1 doubt it. I'm just a sucker for excitement.

My symptoms include the urge to spend numerous quarters on something from which I receive nothing in return, and stopping for a few minutes anywhere imaginable to test my luck against invading Martians, dot-eating yellow mouths, asteroids in space or missiles from an enemy craft. Yes, I am a videoaholic. Medical science has not found a cure, except possibly a shortage of quarters or a complete power failure. Unfortunately, my addiction has not been completely analyzed. Maybe it is my competitive instinct to beat the high score and get my initials on the screen. Maybe I have the desire to save the world from enemy attackers. Or could it be that everyone else is doing it and I hate to be left out? 1 believe the surgeon general should label electronic games with a warning that playing the device could be hazardous to one's health. Side effects include losing the ability to blink (you may miss an oncoming attacker), finger and wrist cramps from pushing buttons and moving control sticks and an empty pocket (which previously housed several dollars of quarters). The game inventors must be making a fortune. Seriously, how much overhead is needed for a game that just sits there, lights up and makes strange noises? It's getting harder for us addicts because everywhere we turn, there is a video game haunting us for another quarter. Most of them can be found in bars, which lead to the consumption of alcohol, which leads to the attitude of \"what's another quarter?\" Bars are not the only place these machines can be found. Laundromats, bowling alleys, shopping malls, the Union recreation center and even restaurants include them as interior decorations. Videomania will probably remain as long as there are people who will spend their last quarter on a few minutes of fun. 1 am really trying to quit because I cannot afford the extra expenses each time I walk out the front door.

Swing dancin' (well, what did you think 1 was doing?) 1 decided is the best. Yes, Miss Rock Concert herself, lover of Journey, Kansas, and Pat Benatar, is in her white Mikes and Calvin Klein's struttin' to Willie Nelson. Just a couple years ago 1 wouldn't be caught listening to Country 107. Sparked by movies that said country is \"cool\" and disco is \"dull,\" 1 have again been brought into line by a fad. Although I can't bring myself to wear pointy-toed cowboy boots or a big- buckled belt, I've always admired people who have perfected the art of swing dancing. There is something about complementing your partner's dancing, moving as a single unit, as compared to \"doing your own thing\" to rock and roll. It makes dancing more enjoyable when you dance with someone rather than by someone. Besides, 1 always seemed to get the guys who were trees with no trunk action or the American Bandstand dance contest rejects. After years of scorning proper touchdancing, 1 found out that two-steppin' is fun. I still recall when my equally inexperienced dance partner and I ventured down to the Rocker for our first Monday lesson. 1 was surprised to see couples as non- country as my partner and me in a bar that surely had seen many a real tobacco chewing cowboy. A pony-tailed sorority girl in shorts, a tall lanky guy who had trouble coordinating his walk much less his dancing, and some \"preppies\" were all part of the same group. Our instructor told us not to get frustrated — it's easier than it looks. Within 5 minutes 1 was frustrated, and 1 thought it was harder than it looked! My head was dizzy from going around in circles, my sweaty palms couldn't hold on to his, I had stepped on his feet a hundred times and he had returned the favor. Because I'm lefthanded I confused matters by naturally turning left instead of following his lead to the right. Just when I was about ready to sit down and cry, we made a back pass without any effort. Then other turns started to work and soon we could do a slide, a window, and a sweetheart hold. Four weeks later we were doing pretzels, double windows, sweetheart figure 8's and Texas two-steppin' — Kansas style. To anyone who thinks he can't learn swing dancing, I say, as they do in the Cotton Eyed Joe, \"Bull -- !\" Yes, swing dancing is really a blast and you can bet I'll get right back to it as soon as I recover from my dislocated shoulder.

While some may find the wrist action of tipping a cold Coors stimulating enough, others devote leisure time to developing skills in games of challenge and finesse. Games that became popular on the campus are Hacky Sack, Frisbee Golf and Ultimate. Hacky Sack is played with a small leathery sack filled with beans and became popular in many residence halls. The object is simple in theory. All that is required is to keep the sack in the air by using any part of the body but the hands. In practice the game looks like a twisting torture for flying arms and legs. \"The game does not require any special talent, just limber people,\" Charlie Ray, sophomore in computer science, said, t Kickin' — Dave McNaghten, junior in archictecture shows his skill with the Hacky Sack ball. The game makes for limber limbs, as players attempt to defy gravity to keep the ball in flight. Scott Williams Looking for an out — Brad Loucks, senior in milling science, searches for a teammate, then sneaks the Frisbee past guard John Steeves, junior in pre-veterinary medicine during a game of Ultimate. 18 games According to Ray, the game calls for agility and coordination and is now being used in other sports as a warm-up exercise. \"We like to warm-up with a game of Hacky Sack before we play Ultimate,\" David Zentz, senior in marketing, said. It loosens up the muscles and puts you in better condition to play.\" Developed in 1968 by Joel Silver and Buzzy Hellring, of Mew Jersey, Ultimate is a Frisbee sport that requires running as well as catching and throwing skills. At K-State students get together for a \"friendly\" game only to discover that the pain of twisting limbs is overlooked in the midst of competition. \"The game can get pretty intense at times,\" laughed Mark Styles, senior in biology. \"It's a lot like soccer or basketball in that it can be real hard on the body.\" Members of the K-State Flying Disc Liberation Army are well acquainted with sore joints and even occasional knee surgery, but despite these, they continue to support their sport. According to Zentz, the club started informally with friends calling each other to start a game when they had free time. After being kicked off their playing field at the Old Stadium, however, they decided to become affiliated with the University. \"We used to play on the field where the band practiced, but we got kicked off that too,\" Zentz said. Mow that the club is registered with the University, it is allowed to play by checking out the stadium for a certain amount of time. \"We don't get to play that often, so when we manage to find time when all of us aren't busy we go for a game,\" he said. In a typical game of Ultimate, the object is to gain points by scoring goals. It is similiar to football because it is played on a field that is approximately the same size, but no contact is allowed. The frisbee may only be passed, and a goal is scored when a player successfully passes the disc to a teammate in the end zone which that team is attacking. With seven members on each team all scrambling to gain control of the same object, play becomes fast and furious. \"It's like any other game, how good you are depends on how much you play. It takes practice,\" Zentz said. While the K-State members play primarily for enjoyment, they also enter tournaments and competitions with teams from other areas. \"It's a lot more involved than you would think,\" Styles said. \"The half dozen teams that qualify for nationals are very serious about their game.\" Each team trys to psych out the opposing team by developing interesting defensive and offensive strategies, he said. Styles played Ultimate when he lived in California and found enthusiasts to be even more zealous there. \"It's amazing, for some guys it's like a job. People get to the point where they really devote a lot of time and energy to it,\" he said. When members of the K-State club travel to tournaments the money must come from their own pockets. Entry fees for each team can be anywhere from $30 to $50 and if many teams are represented, incentive increases accordingly, Styles said. \"We recently went to Springfield, Mo., for an Invitational,\" Styles said. \"We weren't taking things seriously — just going mainly to have some fun but we made $225.\" For Frisbee enthusiasts more interested in developing the individual aspect of the sport, there is Frisbee golf. According to Styles this is one of the highest paying Frisbee sports because there is a professional disc golf association. A 14-hole golf course is located on the K-State campus but players are careful to play when it isn't crowded with students going to class. \"We made a map of the course for Rec service to distribute so that people would know where we were playing,\" Styles said. \"We try to stay on the edges of the campus because not too many people appreciate getting a frisbee thrown in their face.' iru3! by Sharon Riley games 19 The eyes have it From clutzy frames to sexy eyes You've noticed us before. We can't venture into Kansas wind without becoming tearyeyed and we often have blinking fits of 10,000 blinks per minute. Our eyes are always bloodshot by 10 p.m. and we can often be seen swirling our eyes in outlandish directions. We are the contact lens wearers on campus. We're so cool! No more covering our youthful faces with repulsive, unalluring glasses. No more flirting and \"making eyes\" through thick, clutzy lenses. Never again will we need miniature windshield wipers for our glasses in the rain. With contact lenses, the poor- sighted college student has it made. Well, almost. After initially purchasing contacts, deciding what color, type and size, and going through training sessions to learn to use them, new contact wearers are all set — except for a few minor difficulties that are never mentioned by the eye doctor. It's important for wearers to train themselves not to blink excessively. Over-blinking is a dead giveaway for new contacts and women will find themselves attracting unwanted attention in bars. Wearers should always be able to recall how to remove their contacts, whether it's after pulling an all-nighter at Seaton or returning from the two-for-one special at Kite's. Once the minor difficulties have been mastered, the new contact lens wearer still cannot be considered a professional wearer. He can only become a true pro if he learns to handle the dilemmas that even longtime wearers unfortunately but inevitably face. Jane, typical lens wearer, fell prey to such a situation. There she was, on her first date with Rick, the fraternity man of her dreams. The dark movie theater was the idealistic setting to let her imagination run wild with fantasies about the gorgeous guy sitting beside her. The evening was progressing the way Jane wanted when halfway through the movie, disaster struck. A speck of dust plopped into her left eye and scooted under her green-tinted contact lens. Jane tried to remain calm, determined not to annoy Rick with her excruciating pain. She tried to get rid of the speck by blinking lightly, but it was persistent. She blinked harder. Soon she was sniffling, dribbling and drooling. By this time, Rick, a non lens wearer who had no idea that Jane wore contacts, couldn't decide if she was some sort of weirdo or if she was drooling over him. Finally, the speck was out. Jane desperately tried to regain her composure, but it was difficult. She was left with a flushed face, bright red eyes, matted eyelashes, dripping mascara and a runny nose. For some reason when Jane bumped into Rick in Aggieville the next night, he couldn't seem to remember who she was. Ernie also suffered through a situation only a pro could handle. He was sprawled out in his chair in psychology lecture, his last class on Monday afternoon. Totally bummed out after a wild weekend, Ernie was having trouble staying awake. When he closed his eyes Ernie felt an itchy sensation from his contacts, but he was too tired to worry about it and fell sleep. He was awakened by the sound of moving students. He assumed they were leaving class. He couldn't tell for sure because his eyes were dryed up and his eyelids stuck together. Ernie managed to wrench his eyelids apart but normal sight was still impossible since there was a hazey film covering each contact. With eyes burning, Ernie stumbled out into a stinging Kansas wind. His ten minute walk back to the dorm seemed like an eternity. Jane and Ernie are not alone. I've had my own share of experiences with contacts. I made my Art History class a lot more interesting one afternoon. We were in the middle of an exam when I took time out to whip my head around and give the cute guy behind me the eye and my contact popped out. I whispered urgently to everyone in my surrounding area not to move. I was crouched down, frantically searching, when a guy two rows down whispered too loudly that he found my contact. What could I do when I, along with three hundred other students, heard him scraping my contact along the floor as he tried to dig his nails under it to pick it up? Despite never-ending predicaments, most wearers wouldn't give up their contact lenses. Look for us on campus. Whether on hands and knees in the Union looking for another lost contact or walking through campus with tears streaming down our faces from a strong wind, we'll brighten up your day with a good laugh.

Here at K-State it is responsible for such afflictions as malnutrition, nausea, and in some of the more extreme cases, trips to local restaurants. This article wishes to take an in-depth look at the third largest killer of young males: student cooking. Although it afflicts both male and female alike, the majority of student cooking fatalities occur in males. In reviewing past cast studies it has been found that male college students living in isolated areas with access to cooking utensils are highly susceptable to the student cooking syndrome (SCS). Female students, although demonstrating a much lower affliction rate, are also susceptable to SCS. Why has there been such a rapid expansion in SCS related illnesses? The primary reason has been a lack of knowledge on the part of the student toward preventive measures. In a landmark study conducted here at Kansas State University by the Committee for Student Sickness Prevention (CSSP), guidelines have been established for the novice student cook. The following is a brief summary of the CSSP's recommendations. Guidelines set for student cooks Student cooking has been one of our largest concerns since the establishment of the Committee for Student Sickness Prevention. Although many attempts have been made to alleviate this problem, the rate of student cooking illnesses has continued to increase. It is therefore the decision of this committee to release general guidelines for the prevention of cooking illnesses. We hope that by making the average student more aware of the dangers involved in cooking, a reduction in uncontrolled cooking will soon follow. Male students have the most limited information and experience in regard to cooking. This is not surprising due to the large number of barriers faced by the male student. Many cultural taboos exist for the male student cook. One of the most severely emotional trials experienced by the male student is having to shove his hand into a turkey to reach the giblets inside. However, this report does not wish to limit itself to the male student. Therefore, the following guidelines are universal in application. When cooking on overhead burners the following should be kept in mind. On a gas range it is not necessary to have flames extending up the sides of a saucepan or kettle. Although this is a common practice in many Tarzan reruns, it is not necessary in domestic application. On an electric range it is more difficult to judge the heat being applied. However, when lighting in the apartment begins to flicker and dim, it is generally a good indication that the burners may be set too high. When using the oven on your cooking unit, it is recommended that the controls not be turned beyond their numbered heat range. If pans become welded to racks inside the oven, or if clothing bursts into flame when the oven door is opened the controls are also probably set too high. In cooking over a charcoal brazier, one should avoid wearing shorts or low-cut blouses. Getting a drunk guest to feel the charcoal in an attempt to find out if they are lit, is not considered responsible or socially acceptable behavior. Starter fluid should not be used in an attempt to get the food to brown evenly. Leaving steak to thaw on a counter for several days is not recommended as a tenderization process. If a tenderizing utensil is not available, it is not recommended to slam the cut of meat on exposed counter edges or uncooperative roommates. Not even in extreme cases should the meat be tenderized by holding it in the hinge of a refrigerator and slamming the door repeatedly. Stuffing a turkey does not involve the use of cotton packing, glass eyes or nailing the bird to a wooden base. When opening canned goods an attempt should always be made to remove any metal filings that have fallen inside. If canned goods explode when the can-opener is first applied, it is usually a good indication that spoilage may have occurred. No canned food product should be eaten unless it is at least the same color or remotely resembles the product on the label. When eating cereal and encountering a particularly crunchy item, it may be in the student's best interest to simply swallow rather than look to see what the object was. When looking into a cereal box and finding that the contents are moving, it is recomended that the cereal be discarded. The use of hallucinogenic mushrooms as a pizza topping is a dangerous practice, and should not be used in an attempt to get mom and dad to loosen up on Parents Day. In conclusion we would like to quote Dr. Thomas L. Rankin, director of the Clinic for Cooking Rehabilitation (CCR). Dr. Rankin has developed three axioms of self-preservation for the novice student cook. — Never eat anything your roommate has prepared, unless you have assisted in the preparation. — Dispose of all cooking catastrophies at government designated landfills. — Never try to cook anything that is bigger than you are. It is hoped that this article will make the average K-State student more aware of the dangers involved in cooking.

There were plenty of marketed crazes to tide students over for entertainment. Picking all of the new fads and fashions out of the picture, as well as some traditional K-State stereotypes, like GDI's, preppies, and the ever-present cowboy, should be easy for the experienced K-State watcher. Look again though, because just like the campus itself, there are always more aspects involved than first observed.!^ 24 fads Character list — Thanks to Sarah Neustrom, Kelly Presta, Rhonda Williams, Merilee McCaustland, Layton Smith, Liz Lawless, Chris Kelly, Barb Glenn, Doug Winter, Max Eulert, Tony Firner, Andrea Baldauf, Cleion Whitebread, Fritz Edmunds, Jill Hummels, Everett Gardner, and Joyce Kracht for being in the photograph.

They talked to countless Africans who had returned home after two to six years in American schools, and what they heard disturbed them. \"They didn't like it here,\" Taussig said. \"In their countries, foreigners are welcomed, invited into homes and visited. They come to America expecting the same treatment. When they don't get it, they withdraw from American society.\" Americans often ignore international students. \"Americans don't know what to do. They're shy,\" Taussig said. Additionally, Americans have their own friends, and are generally \"ignorant of the rest of the world,\" Taussig said. Many international students who arrive during the summer have a tough time finding an apartment and getting started. Leila Lobo, a graduate student in foods and nutrition from Bombay, India, is one such student. \"There was no one to help me the first ten days. I'd just been left to fend for myself.\" Elvira Dumayas, a graduate student in agricultural economics from the Philippines, had similar experiences. Other Philippino students helped her much more than Americans so they are the first people she goes to when she needs help, Dumayas said. To combat some of the problems international students have, and to develop cross-cultural communication, the Taussigs began inviting Africans into their home in 1976. \"We tried to do things for them. Most of them were feeling isolated,\" Taussig said. Soon, more Africans were coming over to their home than the Taussigs had time to visit with or help. They began to appeal to local churches for help in 1977 and then to Campus Christian Fellowships in 1980 for volunteers to create friendships with international students. In 1978 a program was started called Helping International Students, or HIS. Currently, 230 Americans are paired with 280 international students. The pairs are divided into smaller groups of 10 to 15 pairs, each with a unit coordinator. \"The unit coordinator reminds Americans to contact their international friends, and finds out how each relationship is developing,\" said Janet Maxwell, a former unit coordinator. Each unit functions separately, with a variety of activities for the group to do together. Potlucks, holiday parties, and picnics are popular. The success of HIS \"depends upon the attitude of each American involved and what their commitment is to the program,\" said Susan Denzon, graduate student in agricultural education from the Philippines. Amy Malone, junior in business, said about the program, \"They really need to screen Americans to make sure they're willing to give time and effort to the relationship. HIS needs to be sure people don't have 'the poor little international student' attitude. Foreign students are just as good as we are. They can sense when we're looking down on them.\" David Riffel, senior in architecture, said that some Americans are not putting their whole heart into the program. \"HIS is serving a purpose, but it could be doing more.\" Another important factor to the success of HIS is that each American take the initiative in developing the relationship. But many international students have never been contacted by the person who signed up to be their friend. Leila Lobo had not been contacted by her American friend as late as Thanksgiving. \"The first thing I did was go to the International Student Center,\" she said. \"I signed up Aug. 10 (for an American friend). I was the first to sign up I think. I was really disappointed.\" In some situations, Americans have trouble contacting their international student because of housing changes the students make. To avoid this, international students are asked to contact the ISC after they have moved, so a Taussig can inform the American. Although housing changes are a reason for lack of communication, Taussig said, most of the failures in communication are usually on the part of the American. When commitment occurs, however, there are often positive results. \"Mary Taussig, Dr. Taussig, Sally Coltrain, and Dr. Shaver, who to me represent the HIS program, were the very people who encouraged, inspired and gladdened me up during my first days at K-State,\" Denzon said. \"I was depressed, confused, lonely and 1 almost sank. But there they were, calling me up, comforting me, and encouraging me. They even invited me to their places. I surely can't forget them.\" Communication is necessary, but sometimes difficult to achieve between international students and Americans involved in HIS. A student who wished to remain anonymous said he found Midwesterners to be superficial in their conversations with him. He feels Kansans keep their distance from foreigners, pointing out that he never sees Americans and international students mixing in the Union. \"It's really hard sometimes to get past the superficial level,\" Malone said. But she has successfully crossed the cultural barrier in her relationships with two friends from Malaysia. \"I've been blessed with two really outgoing friends. They're willing to communicate. We're willing to accept each other as we are and we aren't trying to change each other.\" Both international students and Americans see the HIS program as a success. Denzon changed her attitude towards Americans because of HIS. \"I expected Americans to have superiority complexes and to be snooty, but I have found them to be helpful, open, friendly and independent.\" Maxwell also believes the program is a success in giving international students a positive reaction to Americans. \"There is so much you can learn,\" Maxwell said. \"Americans almost can get more out of HIS than the international students if they are willing to spend the time.\" \"HIS is great,\" acording to Dumayas. \"It's a good way of helping international students and helpful if you have a language problem. If we have a question or a problem, we always have someone to go to.\" (be) by Heidi Bright 26 international students Friends — Wan Asma Ibrahim, sophomore in chemistry.

Even then he wouldn't admit to himself that alcohol was causing his problems. Mike eventually dropped out of school. After finally realizing he needed help, Mike turned to Alcoholics Anonymous. \"I went to an open meeting (\"open\" means that the public may attend) and found nobody was there to judge me. It was just people sharing their personal experiences with alcohol, giving strength and hope to each other. I found out I wasn't alone.\" Mike admitted that he was powerless over alcohol — that his life had become unmanageable. He had taken the first step of the twelve steps to recovery of AA. \"The alcoholic has not learned to cope with life. His mind basically self- destructs. A normal person gets a hangover and stays away from it (alcohol) for awhile, but not the alcoholic.\" \"The chains of alcohol are too strong to be felt until it is too late,\" Mike said. \"Many (alcoholics) pursue the idea that they can handle their drinking. In reality it just doesn't work. One drink is one too many for the alcoholic.\" After not drinking for awhile, Mike drank a beer. He went through this episode more than once. Each time he went through the same personal hell: lack of control. \"I am a recovered alcoholic, but that does not mean I am cured. 1 take one day at a time.\" According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, two- thirds of the adult population in the United States drink at least occasionally. Among the youth of this country, a survey found that most American adolescents have had experience with alcoholic beverages. Almost 80 percent have had at least one drink; about 74 percent have had at least two drinks; and over one-half of all adolescents drink at least once a month. Even after months of treatment, alcoholics do not find it easy to stay sober, according to experts. They are forced to revise their whole life style to exclude alcohol. Some turn to religion, while others rely upon a close-knit family relationship or membership in Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1978, an alcohol-related behavior survey taken at K-State showed freshmen as the most frequent alcohol users on campus. The same survey taken in spring 1981 showed two improvements in behavior. There was a 13.2 percent decrease in driving after drinking along with 17.2 percent more persons suggesting that a friend should decrease his drinking. Another survey at K-State showed a 70-80 percent correlation between misconduct cases in residence halls and alcohol abuse. The surveys were taken by the Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program at re- state. The program is not a professional counseling agency, although it works closely with professional counselors, said Laura King, director of the program. Counselors from the Pawnee Comprehensive Mental Health Center are available at Lafene Student Health Center free of charge. Alcohol Abuse Prevention sponsored a media campaign in the Collegian and Manhattan Mercury about alcohol use and abuse. They also held a Second Annual Alcohol Awareness Day in October. Some of the topics in the information-sharing-activity were drinking and driving, alcohol violence, alternate activities to drinking, women and alcohol, coping skills and counseling. Also available were free samples of non- alcoholic beverages. The program focused on having an \"uncocktail\" party. It also provided tips for a party serving alcohol. There will always be alcohol at K- State, but the Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program hopes to encourage responsible use only. \"There is nothing wrong with alcohol if it is used in moderation,\" King said. lEUfcy Susan Arnoldy It all \"ads\" up — The Alcoholic Abuse Prevention Center ran a series of advertisements in the Collegian encouraging responsibility towards drinking. Pat Honors, senior in fine arts, designed the ads for the Center. alcoholism 29 You are about to enter a world of darkness, danger, and intrigue. You are about to So, you think you know a lot about K-State. Think again. Oh, you may have finally unraveled the mystery of registration, and perhaps you've even been through drop-add and are still living to tell about it. Yet, even if you're one of the few who found Seaton 63 on the first try, you may not know about one of K-State's most intriguing features. Used by the University for mechanical purposes, the tunnels that run beneath ground all over campus have become a secretive amusement for students. \"Going down\" into the tunnels can be highly charged with adventure and more frightening than a haunted house. After your feet meet each rung of the ladder with caution, and finally touch solid ground, your anticipation of the journey ahead mounts. Immediately to the right is a stagnant pool of water of indeterminate depth. The heat of the small room you are in is overpowering, and the smell that accompanies it is revolting. Turning to the left, there is a decision to be made: which tunnel to explore? It is decided that the adventure will begin with the brick and concrete tunnel on the right. A necessary flashlight cuts through the dark and reveals a shoulder level pipe along the left wall that carries steam heat from Seaton to points south. Bundles of bare wires accompany the pipe. For some distance the ceiling runs about six feet high, but it decreases and suddenly it is necessary to crouch. artwork by Ken Young Because of a large steam pipe, the width of the tunnel is now only about three feet. The heat in the tunnels is extremely dry and may reach 150 ° F, according to Fred Ferguson, director of building utilities for University Facilities. Indeed, after 15 or 20 minutes in the tunnel, the heat begins to smother you and the fear of suffocation invades your thoughts. The imagination takes over and breathing becomes laborious. A seam in the steam pipe emits a rush of scorching steam that is definitely to be avoided. Dick Lewis, assistant supervisor of the pipe shop in the power plant, said these leaks are strong enough and hot enough to sever a broom handle. Because of an overabundance of pipes, the tunnel becomes almost impassable after about 15 minutes of exploring. The best plan appears to be retracing steps back to the starting point, and getting back to the cool air of campus. Fourteen separate tunnels wind beneath the K-State campus, leading from one building to the next, and eventually to the power plant that provides steam for most buildings on campus. They are utility tunnels, used for protecting steam pipes and returning condensed steam back to the power plant for reuse. Ferguson expressed concern about the number of students going down in the tunnels for amusement. Although he knew of no disciplinary policy for those caught in the tunnel, he agreed with Lewis that the safety hazard needs to be taken seriously. Lewis warned that if a leak had enough pressure behind it, it could seriously injure someone who walked through it. A common rumor among students that the tunnels could be used as protection in case of military or nuclear attack was disputed by Ferguson. He said that if the steam were turned off people could go down, but the tunnels do not have room to accommodate all the students. A more fantastic story among veteran tunnel explorers is that a congregation of devil worshipers at K-State performs rites in the tunnels near Farrell Library. Although Ferguson and Lewis were both vague about this point, they agreed that the tunnel near the library is blocked off at both ends by large fences. Some students are convinced that the devil's followers hold meetings in the tunnels. Tom Adamson, junior in construction science, claimed that in an excursion with his older brother, they encountered two men wearing black capes. \"We saw 'em and we took off,\" Adamson said. Even with the risk involved in tunneling, students continue to go down and to share their newfound amusement with friends. Perhaps it is the risk that makes the adventure so exciting, and the accounts so dramatic.

Richie Berge 32 Manhattan living Students bite into the 'little apple7 Manhattan: the little apple. And yet somehow the apple doesn't seem so small as 20,000 students from all over the country pour into Manhattan for the start of fall classes. The town swells, ripening with the additional commerce. Stores shout their specials from display windows and tavern owners breathe a sigh of relief. The campus is once again buzzing with activity. For a handful of students this scene is a little overwhelming. Those that see it after spending the summer in Manhattan find it a definite contrast to the relaxing months they may have spent as simply a \"Manhattan resident\". \"The pace is much slower. Everything is more relaxed,\" Marty Athey, junior in arts and sciences, said. As Athey explains, living in the town for the summer makes one realize that Manhattan and K-State are not necessarily synonymous. \"The town just seemed friendlier to me, more personal. The bars were less crowded and it was easier to meet people. It wasn't such a big place where you get swallowed up by the masses,\" she said. Like other K-State students, Athey found the relaxing atmosphere of the summer a refreshing break from the frenzied college lifestyle. \"I didn't go to school so I had the chance to do some different things. 1 got to know Manhattan better. Also, all my friends weren't up here so I got closer to the ones that were.\" While Manhattan does settle into a peacefulness in the summer that many students never witness, it is not without recreational activities to keep residents occupied. \"There's usually always something going on here in the summer,\" Ann Link, senior in home economics, said. \"1 especially liked the Arts in the Park because it's free and there's a lot of people that go to it.\" Arts in the Park is a program sponsored by the Manhattan Recreation Commission that involved 52 performances consisting of children's theater, national tours, and local bands. \"It's a nice thing to do on a summer evening,\" Link said. Greg Johnson, senior in accounting agreed. \"They had some terrific concerts and there were always a lot of people standing around, getting together, or playing frisbee. Every night of the week there was something going on,\" he said. Though Johnson was a full-time summer school student, he said he still found time to do the things he enjoyed, like waterskiing, playing tennis and watching softball games. \"I feel like I learned more from the summer school classes than from the classes I took over a semester,\" he said. Johnson said the main reason was that so much material was condensed in so short a time he was able to retain more. \"I went to school five days a week and at tests it seemed like I'd just studied the stuff the other day.\" Johnson also said he enjoyed Aggieville more since it was less crowded. \"It was more laid back. There were no tremendous crowds. Some friends and I would go for three-fers at Aggie Station and we didn't have to fight our way through.\" Working at a local pizza parlor also gave Johnson the interaction with different age groups that he missed during the school year. \"Right before all the students come back, a lot of the stores had specials. Kind of a break for Manhattan residents and I got into that. I got to meet a lot of people outside of the University, older and middle aged couples too,\" he said. BsEl by Sharon Riley Allen Eyestone » Manhattan twinkles — The view from K-Hill overlooks Manhattan. « * » Sharing is the key Roommates: male, female or both 1 I'll give you shelter from the storm.\" • • • * Shelter. One of the most basic of human needs. Sometimes it's simply a tent in the forest. It could be a mansion in Beverly Hills. But it probably is neither of those extremes. In a college town like Manhattan, not only is the question one of shelter, but who to shelter with. Roommates can make a year, even a semester, seem interminable. But good roommates can make a six-year college career whiz by like four. Twenty-five years ago most college students lived either in what were then called dormitories or other organized living groups like fraternities and sororities. Today, the range of choices is greater, and living arrangements are more varied. In fact, in recent years, more students have chosen to live off campus than on. Off-campus housing can take many forms. One of the most common of which is the two-man \"bachelor pad\" of singles-set fame. More often than not, this \"pad\" becomes simply a haven for dirty dishes, full-to- overflowing trash bags crammed with beer cans, assorted issues of Playboy, Penthouse, Sports Illustrated and tons of old newspapers. Another common arrangement is two women living together. This type is typified by various issues of Vogue, Glamour and — for the truly cosmopolitan and risque — Playgirl, displayed in an orderly fashion among a jungle of plants that would make any botanist swoon. Following closely behind in popularity is cohabitation. New views of sexual morality have increased the acceptance of this new arrangement. Living with a member of the opposite sex has always held a certain charm, and now has little or no social stigma attached to it. Unless of course you talk to Mom and Dad. But some off-campus living arrangements are extraordinary. Some intrepid souls are willing to try almost anything during their college years. Think of having a big family, with no time to get used to your brothers or sisters. No break in period of five years or so to get your bearings. No parents to mediate the inevitable squabbles. Right here, in Manhattan, Kansas, Heartland USA, there are some strange cohabitational arrangements. There are houses full of five or six men, or the same number of women, or a combination of both. Add to this the omnipresent pets and other hangers-on, and some of these accomodations become almost comic. Imagine a stately old house in Manhattan occupied by two men, four women, a cat, some goldfish and an Irish wolfhound. Collecting for bills from all these different people creates problems. Who will wash the dishes? Who takes out the trash? In these situations, the most carefully planned schedules tend to blur into a jumble of statements like, \"It's not my turn, I did it last week,\" or \"It's not my dog, so I'm not cleaning that mess up.\" Of course, many of these arrangements involve a certain amount of sexual interaction. Inevitably, there is some attraction between people who have lived together for a while. Romances develop, and some even last a lifetime. But because of the rising costs of everything from rent to food to utility bills, not all male-female living accomodations are of the carnal nature. It is not unusual to find two compatible people of the opposite sexes who are sharing room and board — and nothing else — as a cost-cutting measure. Separate bedrooms, separate lives, the same house. These places look much like an amalgam of the male-male and the female-female arrangements. The Sporting News is carelessly tossed atop a copy of Cosmopolitan. The plants are there, but not quite as many. And her cat and his dog stay out of each other's way. Not surprisingly, these arrangements tend to work out. The pressure is off, there are no commitments (other than bills, of course), and the relationship is relaxed. This is not to say there are no problems. In any situation involving two people, there is bound to be friction. Who uses the bathroom when, and for how long, can sometimes be a problem. In fact, in a recent scientifically conducted study, five women who live platonically with men have said that men spend too much time preening, and the women are unable to get into the bathroom themselves. But there is one major advantage to living with a person of the opposite sex. It is very easy to get rid of a date who turned out to be a dud. [HP] by Jim Laurencig 34 living arrangements Gift givers 'gram7 it up, using balloons Sending flowers isn't always the best answer anymore when wishing to send a special message to a friend. K- State students discovered bellygrams and balloon-o-grams, both begun in August, to be unique, personalized gifts fitting many occasions. Bellygrams are specifically intended to entertain males. \"Rasha\" and \"Marisha,\" professional bellydancers, started their own bellygramming service in Manhattan. They did bellygrams anywhere from hospitals and campus offices, to bars, fraternity houses and residence halls. Rasha, who preferred not to use her real name, said she always has an escort go ahead of her and single out the intended recipient. Then, in bellydancing costume complete with harem pants, Rasha makes her entrance. She clicks her finger symbols to the Middle Eastern music she brings and dances around the usually startled recipient. She proceeds to take off her scarf and make a turban out of it on the receivers head. \"This always goes over big,\" Rasha said. \"If the person can stand up (sometimes they're too drunk), then I try and get them to dance with me. Some are shy, but others try and dance a little. Sometimes the crowd gets enthusiastic and claps along to the music. It's fun to get a large audience response.\" It seems that the audience might get a bigger kick out of the bellygram than the receiver does. \"Some people just look at me as though they want me to go away,\" Rasha said. She always brings a message along to the receiver telling him who sent the bellygram. Mitch Lee, freshman in accounting, was in the middle of his fraternity's (Phi Kappa Tau) formal dinner when Rasha danced for him as a birthday surprise. \"She danced for (what seemed like) hours,\" Lee said. \"I was embarrassed and really red. She put this turban on my head and I just got redder.\" To let Brian Herbel, junior in business administration, know he was appreciated, a floor of girls from West Hall sent him a bellygram before Christmas break. Rasha danced in the lobby of Haymaker Hall for him. \"I didn't know whether to look at her or not,\" Herbal said. \"I felt like I was alone in the middle of a football stadium and everyone was watching me. There were about 70 guys there.\" Bellygrams were complimented by balloon-o-grams, which were started by a local business. Six brightly colored, helium-filled balloons tied with satin ribbons and strung to a container filled | 36 grams and bellies with caramels, cinnamon, butterscotch, and peppermint candies, balloon-o-grams were about $12, about half the price of a bellygram. Almost resembling a miniature hot air balloon, it carries a message card naming the sender. A care and maintenance card, also attached to the balloon-o-gram, said that the balloons are filled just prior to delivery, and float for 12-14 hours. Sheryl Setter, sophomore in fashion marketing, received a balloon-o-gram as a surprise from friends. \"We were all sitting in the Union eating lunch, when the deliverer brought in the balloon-o- gram.\" said one of the senders, Connie Kolch, sophomore in fashion marketing. \"She started singing Happy Birthday. I think Sheryl wanted to hide, but the attention we got was all part of the fun.\" iro3! by Beth Bowen Tongue tied — Tom Patterson, part-owner of Import Car Parts in Manhattan, enjoys his 55th birthday surprise; a bellygram from Marisha.

Final hours — Bump-A-Thon dancer Kathy Garrison, junior in journalism and mass communications, and 11-year-old Kevin Mesloh from Silverlake, dance to raise funds for Muscular Dystrophy research. 38 Bump-A-Thon The 64 hour dance Bumping for Jerry's Kids They could have danced all night! Anyone who has tried dancing \"all night\" knows how tiring it can get. Add two nights and three days to that and there is quite a challenge. Nevertheless, eleven couples took that challenge in the form of the 8th Annual Muscular Dystrophy Bump-A-Thon. Mother's Worry was the site of the 64 hour marathon dance in January. Of the 22 dancers that began, all but one danced the whole marathon. Kathy Garrison, junior in arts and sciences, said that the encouragement she received from the other dancers, as well as those who came to watch, kept her spirits up and her feet moving. \"Just having other people there to talk to was excellent. They kept my mind off the 64 hours,\" she said. \"The people who gave foot rubs were really good.\" Garrison also said that the friendships formed were the best part of the dance. \"I've seen the friends I made since then and it's like we know each other well,\" she said. \"We just spent so much time together. I met a lot of new people and got closer to the ones I already knew.\" Terry Schroff, senior in journalism and mass communications, echoed those sentiments. He noted the \"camaraderie of everyone there\" as the best memory of the dance. \"Everyone kept each other going,\" he said. The Bump-a-Thon raised about $10,000, according to Mike Mueller, president of the Bump-A-Thon executive council. The proceeds went to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Mueller, senior in biology, said that the total was half of what was raised in the past two years. \"We got more people to come down to Mother's and support it,\" Mueller said. \"It's just that people weren't giving money. We also didn't have as many couples dancing. We usually have about 20. Everything else went well and ran smoother than in previous years.\" Schroff also noted the lack of dancers. \"It's underrated by a lot of people. People get a slanted view when they look at the time element of the dance,\" he said. \"I used to think that way, but now I encourage everyone to give it a try.\" The money raised came from pledges to the dancers and other money-making events. There was an auction at Mother's Worry, a KMKF radio auction, a jail that students paid to put friends in, and a goldfish swallow. \"Yeah, they were real goldfish,\" Mueller said. \"I swallowed a couple of them. It wasn't that hard. Once you swallow one you can't feel it at all. Then you chug the fish down. It's just the thought of it, watching those things swimming around.\" Garrison urged others to participate in the Bump-A-Thon next year. \"After you do something like that, you feel like you can do almost anything,\" she said. \"It was so great to finish. I feel so much better about myself.\" \\*&=\\hy Brad Gillispie Rest time — Solveig Brant, senior in foods and nutrition, and Scott Grossett. freshman in engineering, rest their feet during one of the hourly breaks. photos by Scott Williams Bump-A-Thon 39 Mixture of Snow white, snow bright is a complaint of Barbara Mulligan, freshman in pre-design professions. \"The snow hurts my eyes.\" She offers the idea of making the snow psychedelic. And yet, Kendall McFall, sophomore in grain science, likes the snow for its whiteness, but adds, \"if only it would stay nice and white.\" As first semester drew to a close and Christmas break approached, the upcoming vacation brought to K-State an abundance of cold weather and, naturally, snow. Snow brought a mixture of feelings from K-State students. \"I hate snow,\" J. Hooper, junior in computer science, said. Hooper, along with other students, has a multitude of complaints about snow: \"It's a mess to drive in,\" \"You can't go anywhere,\" \"It turns black and gushy after a few days. \" | Wipe-out — Jo Lynn Cody, freshman in pre- nursing, and Carolyn Koca, sophomore in office administration, skim the snow on the Manhattan country club lawn, during a bumpy \"tube\" ride. Richie Bergen 40 feelings fall with snow flakes But put most students outside after a freshly fallen snow, and their complaints diminish. It seems almost everyone likes at least one thing about snow. Even Hooper has a favorite snow sport: tubing. \"Tubing is better than sledding because the innertube bounces and the snow doesn't have to be packed,\" he said. Hooper also likes to pull someone on an innertube behind his car. This isn't always a leisure ride. Hooper sets two goals: (1) to see how much snow he can get to land on the rider, and (2) to see how quickly he can dump the rider. After Manhattan's first big flurry, students were out writing messages in the powdery snow. Hooper said this is not as easy as it looks. It's hard to make your letters look good and it's especially difficult to get from one letter to the next without leaving a trail between your letters. \"It's easy to fall flat on your face if you're not careful,\" he said.

Snowball fights are always popular. Judy Whetzel, freshman in animal science, said she loves to have snowball fights. She shows no favoritism for friends or foes, \"I'll have a snowball fight with anyone I can beat.\" Whetzel doesn't stop at Winning snowball fights either. After beating her roommate, she proceeded to bury her roommate's head in the snow. \"She was quite upset,\" Whetzel said. Kristen Bosnak, freshman in horticulture, likes snow because it provides the special ingredient for making snow ice cream. She likes the special taste and \"Snow ice cream makes a fun treat after playing in the snow.\" Jeff Bowers, freshman in computer science, was in for a surprise when he went home for a weekend to find his mother had been playing in the snow and making snow angels. \"I think playing in the snow is for kids from one to 92,\" Mulligan said. Mulligan may be right. K-State students, despite grumbling complaints, seem to have discovered the opportunities for fun that snow offers. And if being \"big college students\" hasn't stopped them from enjoying snow, then why should it when they're 92?

Shooting Star's performance in McCain Auditorium in December illustrated that statement. The group's dynamic, high energy rock-n-roll left no doubt in the audience's mind that not only does Shooting Star put on a hard- driving concert, but that a K-State crowd can reciprocate the same energy, creating a combustible, unforgettable atmosphere. \"The crowd was crazy. We really had fun performing,\" Van McLain.lead singer and guitarist, said. Shooting Star landed in Manhattan after four months on the road. Denver, San Francisco, Oklahoma and Texas were a few of the places they toured, and, according, to Steve Thomas, drummer, \"we didn't think we were that well-liked; it was a surprise to sell out shows in San Francisco and. Denver.\" Although Shooting Star's concert in McCain wasn't sold out before their performance, the auditorium was packed by the time they took the stage. A local band, Plain Jane, warmed up the crowd with a variety of energetic numbers, including the popular song, \"Jessica.\" After Plain Jane's performance, Shooting Star took the stage, and after a few numbers it was obvious they had taken the crowd also. They opened their act in a traditional, high-excitement approach with the spirited song, \"You've Got What I Need.\" The group never slowed its relentless pace until the second encore, ending the show with one of their latest songs. \"She's Got Money.\" Shooting Star's climb to success had been marked by many concert performances, but the K-State show was \"exceptional,\" according to McLain. \"It was a great way to finish our tour. We're ready for a vacation now,\" he said. McLain's summarization of the show did justice to explaining the scene that night. The crowd remained on its feet from the moment Shooting Star took the stage until the houselights were raised, signaling the end of the show. Songs such as \"Break-out,\" \"Flesh and Blood,\" and \"Bring It On\" sparked the crowd's enthusiasm to enormous heights while the older, classic Shooting Star tunes, \"Tonight\" and \"Last Chance\" satisfied the group's hard-core fans. Encouraging yells, foot-stomping and applause from the audience accompanied Charles Waltz, violinist, | Scott Williams *SA' ■ > \"^ McCain and McLain as they performed a class rock-n-roll jam. First the electric guitar screamed out. Then Waltz's violin \"talked back.\" The echoing rhythms grew and grew until the final explosion of a powerful drum solo by Thomas. Gary West showed his musical talents by moving from guitar to keyboards while singing lead vocals throughout the show. The overall group effort and the intense response to Shooting Star's performance contributed to a hard- driving rock-n-roll concert that won't soon be forgotten. \"Sure we'll be back,\" McLain said, \"and we'll definitely perform in this type of location.\" To the people in the crowd, those promising words should let them believe that, indeed, rock-n-roll never forgets. And if McClain can no longer host musical displays like the one Shooting Star exhibited, with its exuberant burst of a good-times another building somewhere will open its doors to that special magic.

Imaginations excelled when party goers got together to invent costumes and activities to coincide with each theme. \"Having a theme gets more people involved in the party, more into the spirit of it,\" Darla Keener, senior in home economics, said. Goodnow Hall, floors five and six, held a Mardis Gras party in February. Keener said there was a large, colorful dragon decorating one wall of the sixth floor lobby. \"Girls wore mini-skirts and high heels. People were throwing confetti everywhere.\" Students seem to agree that having a specific theme adds to a party. Terry Cordova, sophomore in engineering technology, donned dark blue pajama bottoms and a blue and white striped PJ top to his fraternity's (Pi Kappa Alpha) pajama party. \"People went totally off.

People feel tight when they're all dressed up, he said. Themes often have a special dress code intermingled with a special activity planned for the party. Suitcase parties are popular among fraternities. The men of a house pool their money and plan a trip to send one winning couple at the party anywhere from Las Vegas to New Orleans for the weekend. Gina Ross, sophomore in arts and sciences, didn't know who her date to the Alpha Delta Pi \"Cowboy Crush\" party was going to be until she walked down the stairs to leave. Gina said the idea of the party was for each ADPi to make a list of three guys they'd like to go with, and their roommates would set them up with one. Which date the roommates had picked was a kept secret until the last minute. \"Not knowing who my date was continued to build up excitement all week,\" Ross said. \"People wore western clothes — bandannas, cowboy hats and boots.

At first it may seem to the re- state freshman that everywhere he goes there is an immense K-State crowd, a crowd waiting to swallow him up with its massiveness, so that he is unrecognizable among everyone else. It's not uncommon for the freshman to be overwhelmed by the \"strength\" that re- state crowds radiate. Crowds are a major contributing factor to the spirit, excitement and friendliness of the K-State campus. They certainly don't exist to squelch the individualism of students. The K-State freshman will soon realize that the ambition and desire to \"stand out\" — prevalent in everyone — are very attainable at K-State. And it is the crowd, both students and faculty, that communicates support and incentive to each individual. Whether the engineering student runs for senator for the College of Engineering, the journalism major spends his nights in the Collegian room, or the art major volunteers her spare time to the (JPC Arts Committee, each student has the opportunity to prove and display their uniqueness. Yes, crowds are characteristic of K- State. From the multitude of basketball enthusiasts, to the sun-hungry mobs who populate Tuttle Creek at the first sign of warm weather, to standing-room-only audiences at Landon Lectures in McCain, the crowds will always be an impressive part of K-State. But it is the individual, contributing original qualities and ideas, who performs with other individuals to create such notable crowds. At K-State, each student is distinguishable.

Susie Hines, senior in accounting and Panhellenic president, said letters were sent to Delta Sigma Theta, another black sorority and AKA during the fall semester asking them to join the council. Members of AKA decided to join, and once the Panhellenic Council received notice of their decision, a vote of admittance was immediately made, according to Mona Lucas, junior in social work and AKA vice-president. Delta Sigma Theta was unable to become a member of the Panhellenic Council due to its financial situation, Teresa Switzer, senior in biochemistry and Member of Delta Sigma Theta, said. \"We don't want to be separate and have nothing against Panhellenic, but our financial situation is that we have to look at things realistically.\" Switzer said. Panhellenic membership requires that constitutional bylaws are followed, according to Barb Robel, greek affairs adviser. One of the council's requirements is that those participating in rush must have a 2.5 grade point average. AKA's required grade point average for those participating in rush was 2.0, Lucas said. Barbara Phillips, AKA national president explained that the sorority has a rush system which differs from other sororities. Since the council requires a higher GPA for those active in rush, she said AKA \"could raise its standards to comply with school regulations.\" Although AKA is presently an all-black sorority, Anne Butler, director of Educational Supportive Services and AKA adviser, said that is not always the case. \"There have been several non-minority members in the chapter,\" she said. \"As long as the person in question is in sync with the goals and purposes of our organization, they will be pledged.\" \"I don't think there will be any problems. You don't learn anything by being in the same little group of people. We could learn to work with people different than us, not just people in black organizations.\" Lucas expressed no apprehension about AKA being the only black sorority among a group of white sororities. \"1 don't think there will be any problems. You don't learn anything by being in the same little group of people. We could learn to work with people different than us, not just people in black organizations,\" she said. Greater communication is one advantage that the Panhellenic Council provides for its members, Robel said. \"A house would gain increased communication and coordination of greek activities,\" Hines said. \"AKA (the national chapter) doesn't encourage houses for undergraduate chapters,\" Phillips said. \"We're different from traditional sororities and fraternities in that we have alumni chapters, some which also don't have houses. On those campuses where housing is required, we provide as much assistance as possible.\" Alpha Kappa Alpha is smaller than the other 11 K-State sororities with only 10 members, Hines said. \"It (AKA) being much smaller than the other 1 1 sororities, I think we (the council) could gain more insight into how they work because they don't have a house,\" Hines said. AKA, which has existed at K-State since 1976, was strongly encouraged by its national chapter to become a part of the Panhellenic Council, according to Butler. \"A national official visited us in November of 1980 and recommended that we affiliate with the council,\" Butler said. Phillips said one reason she wanted AKA to join the Council was because of the activities it provided. \"I feel we should have a choice in their (the council's) activities,\" she said. \"It covers the sororities in an umbrella- like fashion and I feel that we should be a part of that structure.\" Lucas said the reason AKA waited until now to join the Panhellenic Council was because they did not think it was worthwhile and that they would get nothing more out of the council than going to a meeting twice a month. \"No one had a clear definition of where we, as a chapter, wanted to go,\" Lucas said. \"We needed more information to find out the advantages, such as being more visible, attracting new members and having a voice in things.\" Hines said she was not aware of why Panhellenic waited until now to have a black sorority as a member. \"We (the council) saw as a semester goal trying to get as many sororities involved in activities as possible.\" Hines said.

The fire did not destroy the kitchen and eating areas of the house. Sigma Chi house gutted by fire A large crowd gathered for a flaming ** spectacle June 2 as a 56-year-old fraternity house was destroyed. The fire left members of Sigma Chi fraternity homeless for the school year. The house was being renovated over the summer. The fire was believed to have started because of a workman removing paint with a blowtorch. The internal wood structure may have smoldered several hours before the fire broke out and gutted the older part of the house. The newer part of the house sustained moderate smoke and water damage and was salvaged. The four-year-old addition included the kitchen and dining areas. Sigma Chi's returning in the fall stayed in a local hotel until they found shelter in a near-by apartment complex with the help of alumni. The complex had just been completed and was able to house all 60 members. The salvaged part of the house was used as dining facilities for the fraternity. The burned structure is expected to be replaced by Aug. 1, 1982. The insurance policy on the old house was about $350,000. Fund raisers and alumni donations are expected to cover remaining costs of a new structure. The old house was built in 1925 and was occupied by the Delta Tau Delta fraternity before the Sigma Chi's purchased it in December 1949. by Char Heinke fraternity fire 49 1, 2, 3 . . . — Preparing to take her group of rushees to another party, Lori Phillips, junior in pre-professional elementary, counts the group of women for which she and another rush counselor were responsible.

I made a lot of really neat friends.\" The feelings and emotions that linger are varied, but Rush Week-1981 remains a common memory many K-State women won't forget. In August, 461 women left their homes and summer vacations to journey to K-State to join, if they found it to their liking, one of ten sororities. Decisions whether to join came after five busy days of open houses, skits, progressive luncheons and preference parties. Free time was spent in the dorm talking, laughing, crying and making new friends. \"Rush is aptly named because it's a rushed and hectic week,\" Barb Robel, Greek Affairs adviser, said. \"It's a mutual selection system which allows sororities to add to their membership.\" According to Robel, approximately 75 percent of the women going through rush pledged a house. Of these women, 258 were freshmen and 58 were upperclassmen. Diane Doctor, Alpha Xi Delta membership chairman, loved going through rush, but thinks the whole process is a \"tough thing.\" \"I don't think any rushee can imagine what rush is going to be like.

If they do go through rush and decide they don't want to join a house, then they won't be disappointed later because they know basically what they're missing,\" she said. Linda Lane, freshman in business administration, and Delta Delta Delta pledge, said that rush was a nervous time for many of the girls. \"I was just looking at it as having fun,\" Lane said. \"With that attitude it was much easier.\" Cindy Rietcheck, freshman in general and Kappa Alpha Theta pledge, called rush \"exciting but scary.\" \"It really depends on the person whether they like rush,\" Rietcheck said. \"If I was talking to my sister, I'd tell her how scary it was, but she'd probably go through out of curiosity, just like I did.\" \"I'm happy now, but I'd never go through it again,\" she added. \"I'd never* yet Aydogan Under the sign — New pledges of Kappa Delta meet actives in the parking lot of Haymaker Hall the morning after receiving invitations to pledge.

Scott Williams 52 sorority rush had one whole week of fear in my life.\" Lauren Messersmith, senior in psychology and prelaw and member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said it is much easier to be a \"rusher\" (active) during rush. \"You don't have the feeling that you are constantly being judged — that you're on the line,\" she said. Despite the pressures, Messersmith said the \"benefits of being in a house outweigh the uncomfortableness of going through rush.\" Lynn Randall, senior in journalism and mass communications and member of Pi Beta Phi sorority, was a rush counselor. Rush counselors are on the best side of rush activities, Randall said. \"We are just trying to get to know the people as friends,\" she said. \"We weren't trying to make an impression or worrying about getting the girls to pledge our houses.\" Being an active can be difficult because girls may become \"attached to rushees who may end up pledging different houses,\" Randall said. \"Rush is simply a means to an end,\" Theresa Korst, freshman in business and prelaw and Alpha Xi Delta pledge, said. \"It has its ups and downs.\" Korst added that it was sad that so many \"neat girls\" didn't pledge sororities simply because there wasn't enough room in the sororities. The problem is eased by the colonization of Sigma Sigma Sigma at K-State in the fall. The sorority did not take part in formal rush, but plans to do so next year, Robel said. Approximately 182 women went through Tri-Sig rush and 115 women pledged. Robel said the response to the colonization was \"fantastic.\" Panhellenic Council will wait a few years to give Tri- Sigma a chance to get started and build a house, before deciding if another sorority is needed. \"At that time we will see where the interest is and if K-State can accommodate another sorority,\" she said. ^B by Beth Herde Thank God it's over — The final morning of rush week finds Lorie Jones, sophomore in arts and sciences, holding her invitation to join Alpha Delta Pi and embracing Karen Wright, sophomore in arts and sciences.

Organized by Blue Key student honorary, Homecoming 1981 was packed with traditional events. Union Day opened Blue Key activities on Wednesday. Living group competitions included Yell Like Hell, Body Building and Balloon Stuffing contests. Spirit Banners were also judged. Woven between the games were performances by Concert Jazz Ensemble, Kappa Pickers, Larry Weigall and the United Black Voices. Blue Key created a new facet by designating Friday as K-State Day. The morning was again filled with musical entertainment in the Union Courtyard. Early afternoon competitions, such as egg tossing and phonebooth stuffing, had administrators face-off against students, football players against cheerleaders and college council leaders against college deans. Open contests were held throughout the day until Yell Like Hell finals. \"It was great,\" Fritz Edmunds, sophomore in business administration, said. \"The whole idea was to get a fraternity and a sorority working together to promote spirit and crowd enthusiasm. We (Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority) did formations, chants and spelled out words using our bodies to form each letter.\" Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and Kappa Sigma fraternity took first place in the competition. They were judged on group participation, generation of spirit, crowd response, originality and creativity. Capping the day was the traditional bonfire featuring the K-State Marching Band and the cheerleaders in Memorial Stadium. Living group competition winners were announced.

A free \"Welcome Back\" concert was held Sunday, Aug. 30, by the Union Program Council and local radio station KMKF. \"I thought the concert was a great idea,\" said Connie Cooper, junior in sociology. \"I got to see some friends I hadn't seen all summer and it was a good afternoon to relax and listen to good music.\" The crowd, estimated at 1,100 by UPC, spent the afternoon tanning on blankets or getting reacquainted with old friends. \"I was really happy with the way things went,\" Barbara Burke, program adviser for UPC said. \"We had a much bigger turnout than last year and from all the positive feedback, I'd say everybody really enjoyed the show.\" According to Burke, actual preparations for the concert began six weeks earlier at the end of July after she approached KMKF about joining UPC to do the show. \"I knew that KMKF had helped sponsor a concert last year and they were enthusiastic about the idea of doing it again,\" she said. Last year's concert was on a Friday in October, and fewer than 500 students attended. Burke attributed this year's success to planning it for a day when most students would be in town. \"We wanted to have it on a Sunday rather than a Friday night so we wouldn't have to compete with all the Aggieville bars,\" Burke said. Publicity for the concert stressed that University and state rules do not allow liquor in public places on state property. Since the concert was on Sunday when no liquor can be sold in Kansas, there were very few problems enforcing the ordinance, Burke said. Martha Chapin, promotion director for KMKF, said communication was the big plus that made the concert so successful. She also felt that the students were especially well-mannered. \"I think campus officials were probably a little nervous about the idea of an outdoor concert with so large a crowd,\" Chapin said. \"But after they saw how smoothly things went, they were super-impressed.\" Provisions for the concert included extra security, a flatbed truck to transport the band, and advertising to make the students aware that it was a free concert. Both Plain Jane and The Clocks were popular with the K-State crowd and have made frequent appearances at Brothers Tavern in Aggieville. \"I especially liked the concert because not only was it free, but they managed to get two really good bands,\" said Pete Lewis, senior in political science. \"I didn't think the sound was as good photos by Rob Clark Center stage — Jerry Riley, lead singer for the Clocks belts out a number. outside as in Brothers though.\" Dan McKee, senior in marketing, agreed but felt the concert should have been publicized more. \"I heard about the concert from a friend of mine, but I'm glad 1 went. When you go to Brothers to hear one of these bands, it's usually so packed you can't move around, but in this case, you got to hear both of them and you didn't have to pay a cover.\" \"I think it all went over fantasticly well and I've been hearing a lot of good things about it,\" said Steve Jack, KMKF announcer. In addition to getting the bands, Jack was also in charge of the radio crew that broadcasted portions of the concert from Weber lawn. \"We always enjoy playing to a Manhattan crowd and everyone seemed really enthusiastic,\" said Jim Bond, lead vocalist and bass guitarist for Plain Jane. During the concert Plain Jane spurred audience participation by insisting \"they can't hear you down at KU\" and prompting students to yell a certain obcenity at the band that had become a ritual when the band plays in Aggieville. Burke said UPC hopes to have a similiar concert every year since this one was successful. \"It's a good way to start off a semester, and I think the students enjoyed the afternoon.\" IrfI by Sharon Riley welcome back concert 59 §£».
