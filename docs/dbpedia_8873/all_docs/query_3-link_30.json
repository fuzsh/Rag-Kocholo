' Introduction Student Life 10 Academics and Organizations 82 Sports 178 Housing 242 Closing 448 Rhythm In the spring of 1980 an area radio sta- tion released its new theme song, \"Kansas I'm Coming Home.\" When the melody swept across campus, it created an awareness of the state's am- ber waves, beautiful Flint Hills and friend- ly people. Through the tune, a link of brotherhood was also formed. So we, the 1981 Royal Purple Staff, de- cided to demonstrate that this heartland bond was evident on the K-State campus. We wanted to show that from March 1980 to March 1981 our collegiate world was affected by the heartland rhythm.

But, the geographic backgrounds are not the only differing characteristics. Each K-State colle- giate varies in attitudes, activities and even attire. Some students dress in izod sweaters, blazers or skirts, while others can be found in everyday blue jeans. Whatever the difference, K-State students are bound together by the heartland rhythm.^ 12:20 Rush- Between lecture courses, the halls and sidewalks are flooded with students.

From the staccato beat of disco in the film \"Saturday Night Fever,\" he has led us also to the alternative sound of country and western in the movie \"Urban Cowboy.\" Though he may not have been a success in some of his movie ventures, he can be credited for influencing our tastes in sound, step and style. Finally, there is an alternative to disco where everyone can just be themselves, whether they aspire to be the Urban Cowboy or not. It's now \"cool\" to be in a bar wearing something (most likely denim), probably held up by an oakleaf engraved leather belt with a name on the back, sporting a big, shiny, silver buckle. And the feet can finally relax — replacing the spike heels with something flat and heel-stomping solid. \"A few years ago, 1 wouldn't have been caught dead wearing a pair of cowboy boots. But I found out that they're some of the most comfortable and practical things you can put on your feet,\" Denise Gatzoulis, junior in business administration said. Even if a person doesn't plan to break bucking broncs wearing elephant- or ostrich- hide boots, one can probably find another suitable way to put them to use. Like spikes found their home in the hustle, boots can glide into the two-step or Texas swing. With hair flying and boots shuffling, couples can twist their bodies into strange contortions such as the pretzel or Windmill- Even without the urge to swing, one can sit and pretend to cool off with a couple of beers. As one sips, the tunes of Waylon and Willie, Kenny Rogers, Crystal Gayle, Red Steagall, and the Oakridge Boys vibrate from the jukebox. Bands in Manhattan please the crowds with the country and western beat, getting whoops and hollers, replacing snapping fingers. The \"homier\" atmospheres have been more popular places for these activities. Rockin' K and Cowboy Palace draw the crowd demanding more than just a little bit of country. Brother's Non-Disco isn't always country and western, but is certainly what it advertises. Another bar sporting country notes is Enoch's Tavern, \"where the beer's cheap and the atmosphere's different than Aggie,\" Dale Richardson, senior in electronical engineering technology, said. As the night wears on, cowboys, their dress inspired by the movie \"Urban Cowboy,\" still come through the bar- room doors to try the swinging thrill or just to relax. Nevertheless, they defy the words of Willie Nelson, as he sings and advises their mammas, \"don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.\" # Cari Cavassa Whip'er around — Sheryl Russell, senior in secondary education, and Brian Keith, sophomore in animal science and industry, swing dance in the Rockin' K. *as^ f <~ 12 alternatives to disco photos by Criag Chandler Bar room bronco — A bull- riding daredevil takes a spin on El Toro, the mechanical bull at Cowboy Palace. Manhattan taverns choose the bullish approach TPhe small, wiry contestant threw a leg * over the bull's back, scooted himself into place, and gripped the rigging with a gloved hand. He jerked his right arm into the air — signaling that he was ready to take on El Toro — the mechanical bull performing at one of Manhattan's clubs. With a sudden twisting writhe, El Toro, operated by a rodeo professional, attempted to knock off its rider. But 21 year-old Randy Powell, Fort Riley, knew what he had to do to win the contest. Years of rodeo experience had given him a feel for the unpredicatable contortions of an angry bull. Arching with the bull's jumps and jolts, Powell rode for the 8- second duration — the time required to score. His score of 77 gave him some satisfaction, as he topped the other contestants' scores by at least 8 points. Powell, who hopes to ride in the Pro Rodeo Association, \"but not for a few more years,\" he said, \"This is harder than a real bull. A real one has a neck you can watch so you know which way you want to go.\" An increasing number of bars are placing a bucking machine in their midst. Enoch's and Cowboy Palace in Manhattan have ventured to add this to their line of entertainment. And the crowds go — curious after seeing this machine that was featured in the movie \"Urban Cowboy.\" El Toro was introduced in Cowboy Palace on Sept. 28 and 30. \"I've been thinking of having it here for a year, but I was worried about its liabilities, and because it takes up so much room it's a prohibitive factor,\" John Gilman, co-owner of Cowboy Palace, said. The bull used the entire area of the Palace's dance floor. Placed dead center on the floor it was surrounded by wall to wall piles of cushy foam to comfort riders who were thrown. The bull itself, made from a hard rubber substance, was covered with foam along its backside, cushioning some of the jolts. \"I'll probably have blisters,\" Lana Hinton, Manhattan, said. Hinton, 4 feet 11 inches, rode the bull seven times in one day. One of those rides won her the girls' bull-riding contest. The rides were scored on a point basis from 25-100 points. Hinton scored a 57 on her winning ride. Because of her small size, she has an advantage over most contestants. \"It helps when you're smaller. There's not as much weight to throw around. The ideal cowboy is 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet, 6 inches and around 145 pounds. And small people are really just as strong as big people,\" Chuck Elliott, one of the professionals controlling the bull's kicks and spins, said. But whether a contestant was large or small, these bull-riding daredevils kept hopping up one after the other. \"I'm enjoying the enthusiasm of the participants; I think it's a great idea. It's exciting. It's the closest thing you can find to a rodeo in a bar,\" Don Paustian, former employee of Cowboy Palace, said. As Gilman said, \"This thing is tougher than any bull that ever lived. It's the meanest; it's El Toro! Git on!,\" another pseudo-cowboy bit the dust. ^ Carl Cavassa alternatives to disco 13 All tied up? ** Plagued by endless forms, red tape engulfs students who are forced to fill out form after form after form: in triplicate. The most common are the ominous lines for registration. But even preparing for registration is a sticky situation in itself, especially if for some reason one didn't pre-enroll. The hassles begin when students search for an appointment with a faculty adviser. Without his signature, enrollment forms are useless. Reaching registration, students must attend the specific time slot. Many attempt to disregard the alphabetized signs, but the I.D. checker, who has heard all the excuses, forces the disobediant student back into the proper time period. Now the lines begin. Approaching table one, students pick up their class schedules. For those collegiates who are handed an incomplete form, the entangled drop-add system is a must. Filling out the master cards, K-Staters blacken in the ovals with a number two pencil. The toughest situation at table two is remembering one's new phone number. At table three, the student must register their automobile, so security and traffic can trace the permit number when parked in a restricted area. After surviving registration, the red tape continues to ravel. Both full and part time students undertake the process of changing course line numbers. Thus, once again, a visit to the adviser, who is becoming quite familiar, is necessary for the class alterations. Grasping their appointment card, thousands of collegiates go to the basement of Farrell Library. Each student must stand in a separate line for each class added. The drop-add entanglement increases when a student accidentally drops a class before adding the new one. Invariably the course is full, so the frustrated student must wait in line again to add the very same class he just dropped. Another of the knotted procedures at K-State is in financial aid. Though obtaining the form isn't too difficult, the process becomes more complicated with each step. Before receiving any aid from the government, one must fill out an ACT family financial statement packet and send it to Iowa. Next, a notarized affidavit must be received by the university financial aid office before one can pick up any money. This red tape was exemplified in the fall of 1980, when 450 students waited for their work-study checks. While the K- State students struggled with their offices, the departments waited for the work-study authorization forms. The forms, available at financial aid, involved another line. In some cases the correctly completed forms were returned to the department for processing. These forms were forwarded to financial aid, who in turn forwarded them to the University payroll office. Somewhere along the organization of K State, the paperwork was misplaced, thus delaying the checks by as much as two months. The entanglement continues. At K-Stat< there are certain students who are choser to receive a key, which will unlock an office door or building on campus. Of course, these \"fortunate\" students must have a legitimate reason for needing the key and the department head's authorization. After meeting the requirements, these students complete key request cards, in triplicate. When finished, the secretary signs and initials the department head's signature. After a 10-minute hike to Dykstra and another 10-minute wait in line for keys, some of these students may be surprised to learn that they are still entangled in th< adhesive situation. , Due to a policy change, many of these students left Dysktra with the same green form, instead of the gold key. 14 red tape Like other complicated university systems, in the new key policy the department head must annually verify that he has authorized someone to sign his name and then initial it. Even simple things are caught up in the policies of this institution. Students will find it impossible to cash a check at the Union without their plastic K-State I.D. Now, even the fee card won't work. Some consider this ironic, as the only way to get ones I.D. validated is to present the current fee card. Yet, the fee card won't fit into those little machines used to validate the checks written. The fee card also won't serve as one's pass into buildings. For without the I.D., students can't use the library, get into Lafene or enjoy the new recreation complex. Replacing those cards isn't too bad though. If a student looses his I.D., he must jog over to Farrell and have his mug shot taken. Maybe in three weeks or so :he new I.D. will get replaced . that is, f it doesn't get misplaced in a stack of red tape. & 'Jill McAntee art by Mel Westmeyer red tape 15 16 extra costs Students feel the bite Books only minor expense A check here, a check there does it **ever stop? Students enrolled in architecture, interior design, apparel design and multi-equipment related majors often wonder. Every student pays for tuition, books and housing, but some curriculums involve additional expense. Consider the architects' situation. Architecture students are generally required to produce three projects a semester. Projects generally run from $10 to $100 a piece. The average model runs about $30. Pre-design students also feel the bite of the added costs of materials and equipment. Pre-design classes require the student to experiment with water colors, markers, pencils, charcoal, rapidiograph pens, prisma colors and pastels. The initial cost of these supplies runs high. If the student finds that he only likes, or is good at only one or two different medias, he is stuck with supplies he has used only once or twice. Then he must invest to upgrade his final media choice. A special thanks to Alex Poorman, fifth-year student in interior architecture. Art students must also invest in a long list of supplies. The list might include: drawing boards, T-squares, triangles, pencils, leads, drawing paper, matte board, magic markers, tackle boxes, rapidiograph pen sets, colored pencils, drafting sets, portfolios, brushes, templates, tracing paper, acrylics, water colors and paints. The list, according to art students, is endless. \"The biggest investment is at the beginning of each semester when you have to buy all the basics,\" Valerie Mills, fifth-year student in interior design, said. \"But my parents have been real good about helping me pay for my stuff,\" she added. \"I bought an $11 adjustable triangle that I've used twice, and some acrylic paints for my Design II class which I've hardly used at all,\" Mills admitted. Students that have been in the program longer learn the ropes. \"When an instructor gives me a lot of supplies, I usually wait until they are needed. This way I know what I'm going to need and how much I'm going to use,\" Dan Engler, junior in interior architecture, said. Another field in the area of design which strains the pocketbook is apparel design. \"When I began here at K-State, they did not inform us as to the equipment and time involved,\" Nancy Shelley, senior in apparel design, said. It is unfortunate that students with limited finances don't have a chance to make it through the course, Shelly said. \"If money is a barrier,\" Shelley said, \"There's no way one can go on.\" In addition to the list of drawing and sketching supplies also required of architect and interior design students, apparel design majors must also supply themselves with the designers' equipment (shoulder slope, hip curve, etc.), industrial scissors, dress forms, muslin, fabric, and an endless assortment of notions. Extra supplies required of architecture, art and design majors may help to further their education, nevertheless still drain the checkbook. & Randy Dunn, Anne Schmitz i^- m extra costs 17 Dallas: *They call him the man * people love to hate. J.R. Ewing will go down in time with such villian greats as the Klingons, the Godfather and Raven in \"the Edge of Night.\" The only difference between these characters and the one and only J.R. is people love to hate him. Larry Hagman, who plays J.R., is quoted in People magazine as saying \"people come up to me and say 'I hate you so much', then they ask if they can kiss me.\" Now, it would seem that this should be all wrong. Fans should be throwing eggs and onions at the terrible villian who hecomes nastier by each art by Mel Westmeyer J. R. E wing's city of fate \"Dallas\" episode. So, why this irony? One theory is that people love to take their frustrations out on something. What could be better than to watch the \"evening soap opera\" and take all those frustrations out on a man who deserves to be hated. The United States and Great Britian were hit with \"Dallas fever.\" K-State has been affected, too. 'Who Shot J.R.' t-shirts, bumper stickers, Dallas books and anticipation filled the campus as some students waited for the actors' strike to end, so they can find out who shot J.R. The Central Broadcasting System (CBS), being very careful to protect their new found rage, had even filmed several different episodes of different characters being arrested for the shooting. This was done so that even the actors in the show would not know who got the \"treat\" of gunning down J.R. Larry Hagman stated on the Today Show that he didn't even know who shot J.R. The cast filmed several versions of the show, but the last 15-20 pages from every script was missing, keeping the cast in suspense, Hagman said. The shooting of these episodes began before the actors strike put a halt to the continued filming of the show. Theories, of course, ran wild. There's pretty Pamela. If anyone had a reason, she did. J.R. caused her miscarriage, hounded her brother, Cliff, and forced her and her husband to leave Southfork. Miss Ellie was a suspect. So far J.R. had lied to her, mortgaged her ranch without her permission and caused her family embarrassment. Kristin, J.R.'s mistress, was a prime candidate. He gave her packing papers when she tried to blackmail him. He told her he would spread it all over Dallas. Some people even speculated that J.R. did it to himself for sympathy. So K-State students are waiting patiently for the answer. Since there are such things as trials, police investigations and other delay tacts, during the whole season many viewers are asking \"Who shot J.R.?\" On Nov. 21, CBS finally revealed that Kristin pulled the trigger. 8 Glenna Menard \"I'm a soap opera junkie >» ¥E7arning: The Surgeon General should determine that watching soap operas is hazardous to your mental health. With all the cancer research studies being done on laboratory rats, I would think that the Surgeon General could take time to have the above warning emblazoned on every television that is sold. A few years ago, I was reasonably normal, but now I'm a soap opera junkie. It's an obsession. I find myself arranging my schedule so that I can be home in time to watch my favorite soaps; passing up dates so I can watch \"Dallas\"; and eating quickly so I won't'miss \"Guiding Light\". Soap operas have a quality that is able to draw in even the most intelligent person. Similar to a mystery, a soap opera gives one just enough information about each tiny plot variation to gain interest, before going on to the next mini- plot. To add to this technique, a soap opera will invariably end at the most suspensful moment to insure that the viewer will tune in the next day. It doesn't take long for a person to be hooked. Who could pass up a program with such lifelike drama? Eve loves her ex- husband Ben. Ben loves Eve but is married to Amanda (having given up on Eve), Ross wants to marry Amanda (because of her mysterious inheritance) and is dating Eve to make Ben jealous so he will meet with Eve, be caught by Amanda, and Ben and Amanda will break up. Of course the plan is foiled by wellmeaning Jennifer who convinces Amanda that Ben is truly faithful to her, so Ross must devise another devious plan before he falls in love with Eve. It makes my head spin but I love it. I thrive on the fact that Draper Scott (Edge of Night), who is believed by his loved ones to be dead, has amnesia and is falling in love with a woman who believes him to be her long lost husband. This woman's father knew the truth but died on his way to tell Draper. The wonderful twist is that Draper and his woman have moved into what was Draper's town and into the same house that he lived in with his real wife, April. To make matters worse, or better for the writers, the woman who Draper believes to be his wife has become good friends with April. I've often wanted to quit watching soaps but I always go back. A few minutes with Lance, Laurie, Luke and Cris (another amnesia victim) and the rest of the cast of the \"Young and the Restless\", and I am convinced that my thoughts of ending the daily rendezvous are ridiculous. Sometimes I feel like I can't live if I don't find out what happens with the newly introduced cult on the \"Young and the Restless.\" I began as a social soap opera watcher. The girls and I would gather around the television after lunch to watch our soaps. It was just harmless fun-it couldn't hurt to watch once in a while. But soon a half hour a day wasn't enough. I had to see more, to go deeper into daytime drama. I began sneaking off to watch a soap opera, skipping class, hiding from my friends, from my parents, from reality. I tried to quit. I heard about a sort of shock treatment that had been successful in less serious cases. I tied myself to a chair and forced myself to watch reruns of 60 Minutes. It was a painful trip back to reality but I made it. I was a recovering soapaholic. I had been warned that watching even a few minutes of a soap opera would drive me back into hopeless addiction, but when I turned the television on that Friday night I thought I was safe. I watched Dallas and was lost in a sea of drama once again. There ought to be a law against soap operas. A warning to unsuspecting people to avoid programs disguised under the innocent name of \"daytime drama\" before they too are hooked. Thousands of housewives and students are hooked. Thousands just like me. Maybe not just like me. I can quit anytime I want to. I've done it hundreds of times. $ Alice Sky dallas 19 Inarched lips, dry throats and sweaty * bodies were a portion of the suffering during the red-hot summer of 1980. From mid-June to mid-August the heat wave set record high temperatures throughout the nation. In Dallas, Texas the temperature was over 100 degrees every day from June 23 to August 3. People tried to escape the heat by diving in swimming pools, or sitting under air conditioners. And those using air conditioners set a new record for electrical energy used. During the week ending July 19, 52,635 million kilowatt hours were used, six percent over the old record according to an article in Newsweek. People not fortunate enough to own an air conditioner were offered aid in heat relief centers which opened nationwide. These heat relief centers were typically church and school buildings open during the daylight hours, enabling people to seek shelter from the exhausting temperatures. Even with air conditioners, the heat wave caused 1,265 deaths and almost $20 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The highest death rate, 311, was in Missouri. The majority of those who died lived in non-air conditioned homes. The victims were usually elderly, afraid to open doors or windows because of theft; or persons of low-income. These deaths were caused by heat exhaustion and heat stroke. High temperatures and humidity during a heat wave reduce evaporation in humans resulting in dehydration. In turn, dehydration increases the chance of sunstroke. Nevertheless, a middle-aged Atlanta man, lived with a 116.7 degree body temperature, according to an article in Newsweek. Hospital officials said this was the highest body temperature ever recorded People weren't the only element hurt by the diverse affects of the heat. K-State's agricultural department felt the impact of the drought. This year's soybean yield was expected to be about 40 to 50 percent lower than the normal yield, according to Carl Overley, associate professor of agronomy. Nevertheless, Overley believes the crop will yield enough seed for the 1981 crop. The department remained concerned about the soybean supply for Kansas farmers. \"The drought has caused our department to have increased costs of feed grains and roughages to feed our teaching and research herds and flocks,\" Don Good, Department of Animal Sciences and Industry head, said. Farmers in the states were devastated. Even with the prospect of higher prices; hard, shriveled corn and burnt wheat fields caused the farmers' outlooks to be, at best, dismayed. The government's Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program was extended because of such losses. Special grant allotments were given to students whose parent's farms suffered. Ironically, the searing heat helped research on crops during extreme conditions. Tom Fritz, head of the Department of Horticulture, said the temperatures gave a good indication of the hardiness of plants in stress-related tests. & Jill McAntee Waves a blaze- Wheat stubble, too thick to plow, burns as Clarence Minton plows in the background. Photo9 by Scott Liebler 20 heatwave Warm Wind 'n Water- Maarten Van Swaay, associate professor of chemistry, finds the Kansas wind and warm water ideal for wind surfing at Tuttle. Take the Tuttle Creek plunge ^^lad in string bikinis, with a 6-pak in ^hand, students flocked to Tuttle Creek Reservoir in order to escape the blistering hot sun during the summer of 1980. Tuttle offered a variety of choices to cool a body when no other means of relief were in sight. One of the more popular locations during the summer months was the rocks. One of the surrounding flint hills forms a cliff of rocks which students lay out on. The water is just a few feet from the rocks, as inner tubes, rafts and styrofoam devices supporting K-Staters specked the area. A floating dock at Tuttle Cove provided a cool place for students to catch some rays. At the cove, frisbees fly as the sand beach joined by a grass field provided an excellent area for sports amateurs. \"One time last summer, we were out on the dock — it started raining, but it was so hot, we just stayed in the water,\" Ann Masoner, graduate in education, said. For the fortunate few having access to ski boats, meeting at the marina for a day of water skiing was preferred. \"One of the best ways I found to cool off during the summer was skiing. We'd go out to the marina in the morning around 10 a.m., load up, and ski all day,\" Terri Garrett, summer resident, said. For those preferring a slower more relaxing pace, sailing across the cool blue water aided in the relief from the broiling sun. \"I didn't have to be at work until 5 p.m. everyday, so about 11 a.m. I'd take my sailboat out to Tuttle. Even the wind was hot this summer. When it got unbearable, I'd just tip over on purpose,\" Randy Dunn, senior in journalism and mass communications, said. With a bottle of wine in one hand, toting a canoe on their shoulders, students found still another water activity at Tuttle. And for those who put a little more effort forward, paddle boats were available. In the cover of darkness, students sneaked to the beach below the dam to take a dip — naked. Yes, students even skinny dipped at Tuttle. Just a few or in a group, skinny dipping not only eased the sweltering bodies, but also added zest to dodging the high humidity. & Jill McAntee Weekend Water- Lesa Miller, senior in horticulture, creates a wake at Tuttle as she skis. 3 tuttle fever K-State tjrom both eastern and western Kansas, * all the way to California, students have found \"heartland\" at K-State. Students transfer to K-State from junior colleges and major universities all over the United States. Their reasons vary, but almost all agree, K-State is a place for everyone. Brenda Sinclair, senior in speech education from Garden City, Kansas transferred to K-State from the local junior college. \"I'm very glad I came to K-State, it's been a real learning experience, not just educationally, but psychologically,\" she said. Sinclair said adjusting to K-State was difficult for her because it was her first Tic-Talk -In the center of campus, amid the trees and limestone buildings, \"the clock\" is a common meeting place for students. Stateroom Affairs - K-State students find the stateroom of the Union a place for everybody to eat, to study, and to socialize between classes. A place for time away from home and K-State is so much larger than the junior college where she knew everybody. Aggieville is what Sinclair says she likes best about K-State. \"Besides Aggieville, hmmm I like all the activities people can get involved in. I think it's neat that there are so many (activities) so that everyone can do their own thing,\" she said. The University of Kansas (KU) lost a student when Julie Miller, sophomore in business finance, transferred to K-State. According to Miller, she transferred because students at KU aren't as friendly and personable as K-Staters. \"People at KU seem to have their noses in the air all the time,\" she said. Miller said she misses the hills of Lawrence but believes K-State's campus is pretty with its trees and old buildings. \"I like the smallness of it, too,\" Miller said, \"I like the campus because it's not as spread out as KU, it's more concentrated and convenient here.\" K-State's campus is beautiful and the old buildings give it a lot of character, according to Becky Oliver, junior in journalism and mass communications from San Dimas, California. 22 heartland everyone \"I like Anderson Hall,\" she said, \"I ove that building because it is so unique, remember seeing that building when they ;ent me literature on K-State and I hought it was the coolest.\" Oliver transferred to K-State from California State Polytechnic University in 5omona, California. \"I came to K-State because I had a jreat uncle who set up a trust fund so hat when he died any descendants could jo to K-State free,\" she said. Oliver was anxious to come to K-State >ecause she knew she could get involved n campus activities. One of the things she ikes most about K-State is that it is easy o get involved on campus. According to Oliver, K-State is not well ecognized academically in California, but he does believe that the Manhattan iniversity has a good reputation in Cansas. Even though Oliver misses the cultural ;vents of big cities, she says she likes K- >tate because it offers plenty to do and ler social life couldn't be fuller. \"It's easy to meet people and they are 'ery friendly here there are a lot of lifferent ways to meet them — through orities and fraternities, activities, and ^ggieville,\" she said, \"A lot of schools lon't have Aggievilles!\" Since K-State is smaller than Cal Poly., tudents can get to know their advisors nd instructors very well, and Oliver says he believes they really care about the tudents. \"In big schools the instructors are more jiterested in doing research and publishing jian teaching. They don't give a two-hoot jbout the students,\" she said. K-State is a place for everybody, Iccording to Oliver. Students don't have p be just an average person to fit in, she aid, because K-State offers such diverse ireas to major in and activities and rganizations to join, she said, and added, ;I definitely think anyone can fit in at K- :tate!\"# ndrea Carver ■State's Steeple ■ Anderson all, one of the oldest buildings ' campus is a symbol of KState a place for everyone. heartland 23 Pack up, we're going to London Country Representatives- Phil Hewett exchanges greetings with the leader of the Royal Military Band before the two bands took the field at Wembley. Where Next?' Band members contemplate their next sightseeing spot. In addition to touring, members also spent free time napping, sending postcards and studying for finals. Bus Lag- Kathy Schmidt will testify that buses were a familiar second home to the traveling Kansans. The group spent fifteen hours in buses between Manhattan and Chicago's O'Hare International airport. Group tours of London were executed by bus travel. A iter 18 months of raising funds, the outside of McCain Auditorium resembled a three-ring circus. On May 4, 1980 members of K-State's Marching Band gathered and shortly after midnight the 350-plus members departed for a 10- day concert tour of London, England. After long hours of bus travel and waiting during airport layovers, the members' tired eyes widened as they boarded the British Airways 747 jet. Flying at 500 miles per hour over Greenland and the North Atlantic, it took eight hours of flight to reach London. Nevertheless, drink, dinner and a movie helped to pass the time. After 30 hours of travel, the Pride of Wildcat Land had finally reached London. The first real glimpse of London was seen from the busses, called coaches. Driving down the crowded streets, on what seemed like the wrong side of the road, the guide explained life in London. The lessons included: the hamburgers contain horse meat, pedestrians don't have the right of way and everyone takes baths instead of showers. Since this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the itinerary provided plenty of free time for sight-seeing. Scheduled tours included visiting Oxford University and Shakespeare's home. Band members were also encouraged to \"strike out\" on their own to see such sights as Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and London's tube, the subway. Even with the sightseeing, the band practiced their show everyday in an attempt to strive for perfection. After a breakfast of hard rolls, orange marmalade and tea, on May 10, the band headed for Wembley. Before a sellout crowd of over 100,000 and a television viewing audience of over 600 million, the K-State Marching Band stepped on the field at Wembley to perform for the 198C World Cup Soccer Championship. This performance marked the first time womer were allowed to step on the soccer field at Wembley. The soccer field seemed large and alier without the familiar football yard lines. The crowd noise steadily increased and reached fever pitch. \"Take a KU-K-State game in Ahearn Field House and magnify it about ten times and you can get an idea of the enthusiasm,\" Phil Hewitt, bandmaster, said. The field conductors' whistles were almost useless against the noise of the 24 london ,&*7ffifgg tadium Tours £& fans. The voice of the band announcer filled the stadium, momentarily quieting the crowd. The 27 minute show started with \"London Bridges Falling Down\". Song after song, the music poured forth against the roar of the crowd. Over 3,000 \"Bobbies\" were in charge of security at the performance. Crowds surged towards the girls \"throwing sticks\" and the band in \"grape outfits\". This attention was especially true at the opening of Hyde Park's summer series on May 11. Hewett said students were so popular at the Hyde Park concert that departure was delayed over an hour. Almost every band member was asked for an autograph or to pose for a family photo. K-State band albums sold well to the English concert-goers. The Jazz Ensemble gave three performances while in London. The first was at Oxford in the city auditorium. The other two were before sell-out crowds at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, a night club in London. Three encores were demanded from the second show audience, which consisted predominately of professional musicians. # I utM Circle of Pride- The Pridettes put a little boot into their routine for the crowd at the soccer championships. Taking It To the Streets- Not only did the marching band perform at Wembley, they also took the rhythm of the heartland to the city routes of London. photos by David Von Riesen Jill McAntee, Mike Johnston london 25 ( Warning: Life \\ •j i.YSS // (P. 26 hazardous may be hazardous to your health I've come to the conclusion that the safest way to live the rest of my life is to sit in a dark corner and mind my own business. Nothing is safe anymore — sverything is hazardous to your health. I realized this the other week when I was reading an issue of People magazine. The magazine contained an article about the newest scare disease, toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Dr. James Todd, chief of the infectious disease department at the Children's Hospital in Denver said, \"You run a greater risk of dying in your car on the way to the store to buy tampons than you do from toxic shock.\" As I fell asleep I questioned what Dr. Todd said. Then my thoughts turned to dreams. There I was — in the consumer product graveyard with cans and bottles as tombstones. The epitaphs said things ike: \"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health;\" \"This product Contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory jmimals;\" \"Warning: The Surgeon General jias determined that cigarette smoking is jlangerous to your health;\" etc. Then I pictured myself surrounded by a nazy cloud. My cemetery tour guide told ne the fog was the ozone layer coming down to haunt me since I had been polluting it by using aerosols containing luorocarbons. When the mist finally cleared there I was holding a hair dryer. Before I knew it the drier had been turned on and millions of asbestos particles were traveling to my lungs. Suddenly someone was cramming cigarettes in my mouth and trying to make me inhale the nicotine. When the fog rose I was lying out on a sunny beach with the intense sun rays penetrating my body. I was being bombarded by ultraviolet rays! The rest of my dream was an assortment of things to sketchy for me to remember. I do recall people selling me a plot of land which turned out to be at the base of Mt. St. Helen's. And, on my way to view my new purchase, a real-estate agent made me believe the ash was actually a cure for cancer. My agent told me that I was fortunate to receive such a great plot of land. \"Someday it might even be a part of the San Andreas fault,\" he encouraged. Then I started running. I ran and ran stepping over cans which said: \"do not puncture, incinerate, or expose to heat;\" \"Keep out of the reach of children;\" \"do not inhale;\" \"use in a well ventilated room;\" \"do not take internally\". Bottle and can warning labels were hurled at me from all directions. As I came to the end of the path, I saw a sign which said Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that living is hazadous to your health. I woke up that morning exhausted from my nightmare, but realized how true it was. Practically everything was hazardous to my health. I went shopping later and every label seemed to jump at me with its warning message. I went through the rest of the day wondering if I could even rely on Rely. $ Nancy Reese art by Mel Westmeyer hazardous 27 \"Me lazy? No, I procrastinate\" W've always admired people who work *hard at their studies and make straight A's. Even more, I admire those people who get straight A's and don't do any work at all, because 1 like the idea of getting a lot for a little. Some call it lazy, but I prefer the term procrastination. It sounds scholarly. I've had a case of the \"I'11-do-it-later\" syndrome ever since I can remember and I have never gotten around to changing that behavior; yet. I've got a list of excuses a mile long. At the top of my procrastination list is: \"But I do my best work at the last minute.\" This excuse is followed closely by: \"I like to work under pressure.\" When I finally got around to figuring out why I put everything off to the last minute I went to the dictionary and looked up the definition of procrastination. According to Webster, to procrastinate is to postpone habitually. The only cure for procrastination would be organization and hard work-a slow painful death for me. I blame my severe case of procrastination on my second grade teacher (after all, I've got to blame it on someone). After missing two weeks of school, because of the German measles, I turned in about half of the accumulated homework. Once I returned to school, I failed to finish the work and event- ually the teacher forgot it. That's one habit I've kept until now. Unfortunately, now they give incompletes for work not received. I'm sure I have the record for the most incompletes. My mom has tried to cure my habitual laziness by quoting an old proverb: \"Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today.\" Today in the world of posters and t-shirts they have made that old proverb suit my situation: \"Never do today what you can put off until tomorrow.\" In college I have found that my procrastination is forever prevalent. Take reading assignments for example. Usually, 28 procrastination i put off reading until the week of the :est. By this time I figure it is too late to senefit me so I punt the entire assignment. I always tell myself that \"next semester I'm going to do better I'm going to do all my homeowrk and I'll study in advance for each test.\" - I'm a senior now and I'm still putting :hose goals off until another semester. I was off to a bad start this semester already. I vowed I would study for my osychology test because I was positive I :ould ace the course if I put a little effort Wo the class. I marked my test date on he calendar and began to psych myself ip for the big test. The week before the test I began my eading assignment but it was just too 'oring to read. So I studied class notes- >ut I always found something I would ather do than study. Finally, the evening before my test I lecided I would stay up as long as I had o to study for the test I ended up in ^ggieville that evening and when I got ome I told myself I was to tired to study nd I would get up at 6 a.m. and do some heavy last-minute cramming. I did wake up early (6:30 - only half an hour late) and read over the class notes again, decided I could probably fake a decent answer, rolled over and went back to sleep. I woke up in time to comb my hair, throw on some sweats and make it to my test. After that I decided I was a procrastiholic. Anything that was displeasurable or had a hint of work I put off until the last minute. Since I'm in the job market now, I figure it is time to cure my procrastination. At the present I've been doing a fair job. I've gotten everything done on time, a small wonder in itself. But I know I'll go down in the Guiness Book of World Records as the greatest procrastinator — provided I get the proper forms filled out and sent in on time. What the heck, I'll do it tomorrow. & Note: The editor regrets that the photos on this page are missing. Due to uncontrollable student laziness they were never taken.

' ' 'ow was your date last night?\" I >said glancing up from my typewriter. \"You wouldn't believe what happened1;\" John said. \"I knew Lisa was a nice girl, but not how nice. When I picked her up she brought a Bible along.\" \"What a great chaperon!\" I said. \"Yeah all the plans 1 made for the evening were shot, so I asked her what she would like to do,\" \"Lets go to the park and read scriptures,\" she said. \"So your date was a drag,\" I said. \"No it was one of the best dates I've ever had. She's really a nice girl. She's really easy to talk to and besides after the scriptures, we went out for a few beers. Everything worked out fine,\" John said. By the time John finished his story several people had gathered around. Just the mention of a date, especially an unusual one catches attention almost as much as mentioning E. F. Hutton. What a way to rub in my having to stay home on a Saturday night typing a philosophy paper. Soon many stories were being exchanged about what had happened on their dates last night. Jeff began telling his story in a slow monotone voice. He looked like he had been through the ringer. \"I was out north of town trying to find a special, out of the way place. You know, the place where I knew there would be no interruptions.\" \"I put my Bronco in four wheel drive and took off speeding across the field to find a perfect spot to romance my girl\" leff paused, glanced around the ^J^ri- jf\\ Phen added, \"I got out about halfway through the field and I had a flat tire. I got out and changed the tire and proceeded on. \"I hadn't gone 150 yards when another tire had gone flat. I found out that the ,r tire wasn't the Only thing deflated, by now my date's mood had also. We ended up - having to walk all the way back to a : blacktop road and hitch a ride into town,\" he said. \"You think you had a rough night\" Steve said. \"Michelle and I drove out to Tuttle to watch the submarine races. 1 had the Royals placing on the radio. Just after the last inning of overtime I tried to start my car and the battery was dead.\" \"We had to walk in from Tuttle to the doughnut shop before we found a telephone, I tried to call you guys but no answer. At last resort, I called home. My mom came and picked us up. After we dropped off Michelle, my mOm asked me why my shirt was inside out,\" Steve said, shaking his head. As the conversation continued, Jim brought up the lady and the tramp party held last year. Everyone told his date that it was a forma! -xcasion. Boy were they surprised when -we picked them up. \"You should have seen Debbie's face when she opened the door. I could tell she was not impressed with my ragged old blue jeans and the shirt I wore last summer painting houses.\" \"When I handed her the rose that wasn't de-thorned, I could sense I had some explaining to do.\" \"This was our first date and, it took some choice words before she wbuld even listen to my explanation. I told her that lady and theJj^Hrrp' was the theme of the . party.\" ^0 \"I could tell I finally had reached her heart when she saw the menu of a hamburger, an order of fries and an apple turnover. She just loved the young wine I served.\" Then Fred walked in. We all knew that he had a date last night with his dream girl. Yesterday he was on cloud nine and now he looked like his wings had been clipped. Fred was heart broken. \"What's wrong\", I said. \"I thought the date was going great. She seemed to enjoy the stories I was telling her about my Doberman named Lassie. But when I got to the part of how Lassie can play dead, roll over, sit and shake hands she said she wasn't feeling very well.\" Soon all the experiences had been confided and the room cleared. Recalling all the unusual happenings my friends had experienced, I began to think about the people who really take chances. Like the guy who purchased a personal in the Collegian. \"Looking for a typical egotistical male? Don't answer this ad. Super nice guy, gentle and bashful, seeks sincere female, 19 to 22 for evening dinner, conversation, and a good time.\" . After realizing the trails and tribulations of dating, I decided sitting home typing wasn't so bad after all. Then I thought again ... \"Hello Kim, this is Randy. Do you have plans for tonight?\" & Randy Dunn r'-<sf**v. !3§Si!*r i'is '. -\"■!''r,»'w&»* embarrassing 30 A yummy bite- Melissa Miller, freshman in computer science and Curt Lampher, junior in construction science treat themselves to a Swannies run. Only a $5 date? The thought's what really counts $4.97, $4.98, $4.99, $5.00. Not much cash for a night out — but to take a date out on it too? \"In Meriden, (Kansas) you'd save the $5,\" Paul Brown, junior in electrical engineering, said. But in Manhattan, land of flashing lights and romance, surely a $5 bill can be the key to some excitement with a date. \"We'd eat dinner at McDonald's, buy beer and go to Tuttle,\" said Edwin Cuevas, junior in pre-vet, as he described his ideal date for $5. \"It's not the money you spend, but the company you keep,\" Dana Davidson, senior in agricultural economics, said, then laughed. For one adventuresome couple, the $5 stayed in the bank as Tuttle cove provides a secluded place for skinny dipping (saves on buying suits). Davidson described a good date as taking his wife to a show at the Union: $3. The gas to get there would be another dollar and the other dollar would buy them each a medium pop — as long as the drinks were less than 50 cents each. \"I couldn't take her to the show and have a dollar left over,\" Davidson said. \"I may be broke, but I'm not cheap.\" \"Ideal for me would be to go to Rockin' K's and dance every song. You wouldn't have to worry about buying beer,\" Sue Henry, junior in dairy production, said. \"We'd go on Thursday; 50 cents would get us both in,\" Henry said. \"Then we'd probably go raid Vern's.\" Cynthia Carper, sophomore in wildlife biology, said that in her hometown of WaKeeney, \"after six o'clock you can't even spend $5.\" But Carper has more romantic plans for a date in Manhattan. \"I'd buy a bottle of wine, that'd cost about $3 and go to Tuttle with my date until the sun goes down,\" she said. Jeff Gillispie, junior in geophysics, also likes watching the sky with a date. \"I'd take a picnic dinner, go to Hackberry Glenn and watch the sun set,\" he said. One couple stated fishing at Pott County Lake after midnight would suffice as a $5 date with certain added advantages. Then there's always snipe hunting at Pillsbury Crossing or admiring the lights of Manhattan from Top of the World. Rita Weaver, senior in family life and human development, adds her ideal situation for a $5 date: \"We could go roller skating or go to McDonald's. Or go to A&W and have a root beer float. We could also play racquetball or go swimming. In the winter we could go sledding,\" she said. An ideal $5 date for Charlene Trachsel, senior in music education, would be a trip to the ice cream parlor for single dip ice cream cones, a ten minute drive around Tuttle and a trip to the bakery for one doughnut. If you go for the $5 date, there are some rules to the game: DO NOT pick her flowers on campus — no matter how romantic the moment may seem. DO NOT order two $2.50 dinners unless you're sure the service is going to be lousy. DO NOT take a taxi to Sunset Zoo and expect to take the taxi back home. DO NOT make a $6 bet with your date.® Carol Sobba 32 $5 date Craig Chandler Dimming the lights Energy costs id you ever have to walk around the apartment and turn off all the lights your roommate leaves on? If that was frustrating, think of how Gene Cross must feel. Gene Cross, vice president for university facilities, has the job of overseeing energy conservation on campus. That job has taken on special importance in a time when the consumer's problem is paying for energy — not getting it. Energy conservation at K-State encompasses several different areas, according to Cross. One of the more obvious is campus lighting around buildings and walkways. \"A few years back - I can't tell you exactly how many — the lighting was drastically reduced,\" said Cross. \"Then there was some requests to raise the level back up in some areas.\" Requests for changes come from individuals or groups and are evaluated through Cross's office each year. \"Where there is a safety problem or some other justifiable reason we will raise the lighting.\" \"Obviously we could just shut off all the lights and save a lot of money. We are trying to provide the minimal acceptable level. The key words are minimal and acceptable.\" The same philosophy applies to temperature control in campus buildings. The temperature is kept at 65 degrees in the winter and 78 in the summer, according to Cross. \"That is our standard. From there people may request exceptions, but they have to be justified. There are cases such as labs where animals are kept which require higher temperatures,\" said Cross. The standards are just that, Cross pointed out. They do not guarantee that every building is the same temperature. \"With some of the older buildings it just isn't possible to have that degree of control,\" he said. The state legislature funded several special conservation projects for the campus this year. One campus-wide project involved the replacement of inefficient wooden sills and clearglass windows with metal sill frames and \"thermo-pane\" windows. The metal frames provide better seals than some of the cracked old frames and the tinted glass panes are more thermally efficient. Several buildings on campus recieved similar replacements for their doors and doorframes. \"The state has given us the money for the windows and additional attic insulation. This was done purely for conservation. There are also funds for the upgrading to the heating plant and line insulations to make the use of steam on 34 energy spawn conservation projects campus more efficient,\" said Cross. One university project arose from students' efforts to conserve energy. In response to increased numbers of bicycles on campus, bike racks have been added to numerous areas. Larry Wilson, director of landscaping and campus planning, was coordinator for the project. Wilson said the increase was due at least in part to the cost of gasoline and efforts by students to conserve. The decision to provide the bike racks was based on an informal study of his own, observations by campus police, and complaints by people through his office, said Wilson. Wilson compared the number of bicycles parked between the Union and Seaton Hall over a two month period in 1979 to bicycle use in the fall of 1980. \"I did an informal survey- not a scientific one- but I counted the number of bicycles over by the Union every time I was over there. There is certainly an increase (in bicycle use).\" Wilson hoped to provide 300 additional bike stalls on campus, of which 280 would be portable. \"We've hired a consultant to study pedestrian and bike traffic on campus. That's one of the reasons most of the bike racks are portable. We will proceed on the findings from that study,\" said Wilson. The bike racks were placed according tb a priority list of congested areas on campus. \"We have a lot longer list than we have money for so we're just going down the list as we get the money,\" Wilson said. Funds for the project have come from an auction of surplus university goods such as desks and office equipment held in the spring of 1980. Money was also received from the sale of unclaimed bicycles and other items by Security and Traffic. K-State also has an evergy conservation committee comprised of faculty and administration which acts as a coordination committee for campus conservation. Robert Dahl, head of the department of architectural engineering and chairman of the committee, outlined four objectives of the energy conservation committee. The goals included determining the need for conservation on campus and to call attention to that need, to serve as a central coordinating group and sounding board for the campus community. The goals are also to direct an on-going awareness campaign that may include choosing an energy slogan and logo to be used on university vehicles and stationery, and to recommend actions and programs for energy conservation and to communicate and publicize results of such actions to the campus community. The committee is waiting for the results of two separate energy surveys on campus before it takes concrete actions, Dahl said. One survey is the State Energy Audit which audits energy use in all state buildings. The other is being done by Flack & Kurtz Consulting Engineers, a New York firm. \"It is possible that past energy projects on campus have been more fragmented than it could be. The committee could become the coordinating device for conservation by the university,\" Dahl said. # Anton Arnoldy BPiii , 1 I A real turn on- Campus lighting J was just one area of conservation examined by university facilities in recent years.

The day the land slid over President Jimmy Carter and a large percentage of the Democratic candidates. It was a sound victory for the Republicans — not only did they gain the top spot in the nation's White House, they captured the majority rule in the Senate — a control not enjoyed by the elephant's party since 1954. Although the Republicans did not take control of the House of Representatives, they did gain 33 seats thus making 242 Democrat and 192 Republican members in the House. The Republican landslide was not expected. In the presidental election the polls declared the race a virtual tie the week before the election — a slight edge, is any, went to President Carter. Carter was leading the race 42% to 41% — with 12% leaning towards Anderson and 5% undecided. However, Carter's lead was such a narrow one, that in the range of a sampling error the lead was virtually meaningless, according to a 77me poll. But the polls couldn't change the fact that Carter had been haunted by inflation and unemployment, or that Reagan was trying to overcome a reputation for right- wing extremism and simplistic thinking. Nor could the polls alter the fact that Anderson was accused by some Democratic party members of trying to wreck the two party system. Because of these public attitudes the debates became extremely important to each man's campaign because \"a mere swing of 3% of popular vote could switch states with 200 electoral votes,\" as estimated by Republican pollster Bob Teeter — a remarkable number as only 270 electoral votes are required to win the election. With this in mind the candidates carefully prepared for the debates, which were broadcast on national television. The first debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters. All three candidates were invited to the debates, but Carter turned the invitation down in protest of Anderson's third party affilation. In the second debate, also sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Anderson was not invited. Thus a Carter-Reagan square-off was held Oct. 28, 1980. With the elections only a week away, ooth Carter and Reagan placed their political future on the line by debating. Any damage made by either of the candidates would be far to difficult to overcome in the time remaining before Election Day So, in the week before elections a circus of mudslinging and political manuevers took place. Carter had been accused of being weak in the area of foreign policy, of having an insufficient economic policy, and of not taking a firm stand on the issues which confronted him. Realizing the American voters were afraid of war, Carter plotted his strategy around what his aides termed the \"Tolstoy\" issue — an issue of war and peace. Carter charged that Reagan lacked the judgement to keep the U.S. out of war. In a radio speech from the Oval Office Carter said: \"Peace is my passion peace is my pledge.\" On the other hand, Reagan was dealing with charges of being a warmonger and \"trigger happy.\" To counter Carter's attack, Reagan told his supporters while he was campaigning in Cincinnati: \"The President seems determined to have me start a nuclear war. Well, I'm just as determined not to.\" The 52 hostages in Iran also became a major campaign issue because prior to Election Day new hope was shed on the release of the captives, and on Carter's campaign. There was a possibility the hostages could be released perhaps before Election Day-a maneuver which would give the Carter administration a powerful boost in his bid for re-election. Thus the hostages became a heated issue between Carter and Reagan. Reagan Issues Carter 1. A $12 billion anti-recession jobs program and a \"guaranen- teed job for every American able to work.\" 2. Upgrading combat readiness of armed forces and set new wage standards for military forces. 3. To continue trade restriction against U.S.S.R. and to deter further Soviet \"adventurism.\" 4. Increase level of support for farm prices with no future embargos on agricultural products. Reagan 1. Spending limits on federal government and to have a bal- anced budget. 2. Support production of B-l bomber and deployment of MX missiles and increased naval power. 3. Deregulation of energy industries and expansion of energy production through oil, coal, and nuclear energy. 4. Opposed to peace-time draft and registration but favors strengthening National Guard. Anderson 1. Opposed to general tax cut unless accompanied by large cuts in government spending. 2. Low interest rates to industry and 10 percent tax credit for innovative research and development. 3. 50<: per gallon gas tax coupled with a 50 percent cut in social security taxes. 4. Opposed to American intervention into the troubled Middle East and other areas. •••••••••••••■•• \"*• '■YtY-'-Yi'iYi 1111111 Vt ^^^^^^»*^ 36 national elections •••••••••••••••••***•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• Ronald Reagan-Representing the Republican party, Reagan had a landslide victory over incumbent Jimmy Carter in the race to the Oval Office. Reagan was finally successful after 12 years of campaigning. Jimmy Carter-39th president of the United States conceded his loss to winner Ronald Reagan even before the last polls were closed. Several Democrats blame their loss on Carter's early concession. John Anderson-Independent candidate was called a spoiler because some felt he was trying to wreck the two-party system. Anderson received enough of the popular vote to earn federal campaign funds. Reagan succeeds by defeating Carter responded to a Carter statement that he did not understand foreign policy by saying: \"I don't understand why 52 Americans have been held hostage for almost a year now the fact they have been there that long is a humiliation and a disgrace to this country.\" Reagan also said he had some ideas on how to free the hostages, but refused to comment. Carter hit back hard, accusing Reagan of breaking a pledge to keep the hostage issue out of the campaign. \"1 notice that Governor Reagan announced a secret plan to get the hostages back,\" Carter said and added later, \"The Republicans have a habit of spreading a lot of horse manure around right before election. Lately it's been getting pretty deep all over the country.\" After the bitter exchange, the candidates silenced themselves to prepare for the Oct. 28 debate. In the final hours before Election Day, Carter did not deny he made mistakes in office but claimed he had grown with the presidency and strongly believed he had a workable platform for the future. It was on these issues that Carter based his election platform: inflation, taxation, and the economy. The Carter platform called for the enactment of a $12 billion anti-recession jobs program providing at least 800,000 jobs and \"guaranteeing a job for every American who is able to work.\" The platform called the job plank \"our single highest domestic priority.\" Included in the platform was a plan to keep American military strength \"unsurpassed\" by the deployment of the new missile, Trident submarines, and cruise missiles — along with upgrading the combat readiness of armed forces, new wage standards for military forces \"The President seems deter- mined to have me start a nucle- ar war. Well, I'm just as deter- mined not to.\" and opposition to the peace-time draft. Also called for was the use of both diplomacy and military power to deter further Soviet \"adventurism.\" Carter also supported affirmative action passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and an \"increase in the level of support of farm price,\" with a promise to protect farm families and no future embargos on agricultural products, except in war situations. Like Carter, Reagan believed that national defense should not be compromised. Reagan's platform also supported the production of the B-l bomber, and the deployment of the MX and cruise missiles, and an increase of naval power. Reagan's basic philosophy was one of growth. The platform encouraged continued growth of industry and stunting growth of big government. Reagan did not favor the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment but did favor equal rights for women and minorities. The zealot without a chance was a charge John Anderson faced, but in a 317-page platform Anderson detailed plans and goals for the future of America. Overall, Anderson was opposed to a large tax cut unless it was accompanied by a large cut in government spending. With these platforms made public, the American voter took the ideas to the voting booths, with astounding results. In the outcome, 483 or 51% of the electoral votes were awarded to challenger Ronald Reagan. Carter received only 49 or 41% of the electoral votes needed to retain his White House position. The defeat made Carter the first Democrat since Grover Cleveland, in 1888, to be voted out of the Oval Office. The defeat was so sound that Carter offered his concession to Reagan at 5:30 Eastern Standard Time, or about an hour and a half before the last polls in America were closed. $ Nancy Reese national elections 37 *•••••*•••••**•**••••••••*•* St3te elections ************************ Dole is re-elected for a 3rd term hanks to the outcome of the Nov. 4th election, Kansas has gained more recognition in the Senate. Senior Bob Dole, Republican, easily won the U.S. Senate contest against John Simpson, a Salina lawyer. Dole's victory means a promotion to chairman of the Finance Committee, where he was previously a ranking minority member. Sen. Dole is also a member of the Agricultural Committee. Simpson was appointed as a Republican to fill a vacancy in the Kansas Senate in 1971, and retained that position until 1979 when he changed parties and resigned his office to make a bid in the senatorial race. As part of his election pitch, Simpson attacked Dole, saying that Dole had used his senatorial position to gain national prominence, rather than working for the benefit of Kansas. Defending these charges Dole said: \"I had the choice last year of either serving as ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee or on the Finance Committee. I sent about 600 letters to my constituents asking for their opinions. A total of five were against my taking the Finance Committe position. I'm still on the Agriculture Committee. My opponent makes it sound as though I abandoned agriculture altogether.\" In the Kansas Senate, Simpson had worked as chairman of the Committee of Tax Legislation, and as a member of the Committees on Agriculture, Judiciary, Energy and National Resource, and Education. Where Simpson's experience had come at a state level, Dole's experience was on the national level as he has been a member of Congress for 20 years, the last 12 as a U.S. Senator. On Election Day, Sen. Dole was an easy winner, capturing 63% of the vote to Simpson's 37%. & Bob Dole- Incumbent Republican Senator was John Simpson-Salina lawyer lost decisively to re-elected. Dole. Despite tactical errors, Jeffries wins election |2am Keys, former professor of *^ administration and foundation at K- State, was looking for an upset against incumbent Jem Jeffries in the 2nd District Congressional race, and almost had it. Two and a half weeks before election in a critical part of the campaign, a Jeffries' staff member was caught trying to get semi-private files from the College of Education at K-State. \"I had no knowledge of the incident until I was told a few minutes ago ... I have issued orders that they (Van Slyke and Woodruff) be suspended from the campaign,\" Jeffries said in the wake of the incident. James Van Slyke, campaign staff member for Jeffries went to the College of Education, identifying himself as a graduate student from University of Kansas, and asked to see the records when Keys served as the dean of the college. In order to get permission to see and copy the files, Van Slyke was required to sign a form attesting that the information needed was for a research paper and that Jerry Woodruff, paid member with Jeffries' campaign, was his adviser for the paper. Later, following inquiries, both men were caught and their positions were revealed; meaning disaster for a hopeful Jeffries re-election bid. However, in a close battle, Jeffries emerged victorious by a slim yet decisive margin. About 9:30 p.m. on Election eve following a see-saw lead for Jeffries, the incumbent congressman pulled ahead and kept his slim margin until all votes were tallied. ^ Jim Jeffries-was elected to a second congressional term Sam Keys-Former K-State professor ran against Republican Jeffries. stories by Nancy Reese TlCTffirrTi?!!?fflv?Tl'.l/.1.'.J.-.L.1, •Vrli'mVi' \\ 38 state elections ....'.•■V.V.V.V.1.1^ •'-*•'•■• '■'■■' '■* '■'-'•' , art by Mel Westmeyer elections 39 Concerts stray from K- State K -State is missing something. Concerts — especially big name performers. In past years K-State has hosted Billy Joel, Chicago, America and various other bands. But now the bands are gone and the walls of Ahearn Field House no longer resound with musical notes. \"It's not just K-State. Other colleges are experiencing the same thing (lack of concerts),\" said Margaret Cieslicki, program director of Union Program Council (UPC). The National Entertainment and Campus Activities Association (NEC A A) met in November to discuss the future of concerts on college campuses. Representing some of the Big 8 schools, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas attended the conference, along with a Chris Fritz representative from New West Presentations. The consensus of the meeting was that the major concert market on the college campus is not what it used to be. The availability of acts is low and the situation holds a dismal outlook, according to Cieslicki. \"Gross potential is involved. The band looks at how much more money they could make in percentages,\" Cieslicki said, \"and if they can make more somewhere else, they'll go somewhere else.\" Because of this, concerts are getting more expensive. It may cost $25,000 to $30,000 for a \"big name act\" and $25,000 more to open the doors of Ahearn Field House, Cieslicki explained. On several occasions in the past, UPC has suffered monetary loss when bringing the acts to K-State. \"If you have $50,000 or $60,000 on the line, there is no space to hope to break even. It needs to be a sure thing,\" Cieslicki said. \"The best results have been with artists with a track record, such as Chicago, Doobie Brothers and America,\" she said. \"We lost money on the Marshall Tucker Band and that surprised us. In the last six years, there has been only two sell-outs; Bob Hope and Red Skelton. Neither were rock concerts and that surprised us, too.\" Last year, Doc Severinson's performance was cancelled due to lack of ticket sales. UPC could not have funded the appearance without the support of ticket sales, she added. One of the barriers to having concerts at K-State is that during the 1980-81 school year no one filled the position that handles live entertainment. Cieslicki speculated that the position would not be filled any sooner than the summer of '81. \"I would anticipate that the position will be filled, if the idea of concerts is a reality,\" said Walt Smith, Union director. UPC's plans include working with McCain Auditorium to bring \"young, up- and-coming acts\" to K-State. Whether \"If I can find a vacant slot and a group that is touring through here, you bet we will indeed have a performance.\" people are willing to take a chance and see someone \"without a track record\" is a question both UPC and McCain director, Doreen Bauman, are trying to answer. \"My principle need right now is to know what students want. We'll start with what they like and then see if they'll take risks with unknowns,\" Bauman said. \"If I can find a vacant slot and a group that is touring through here, you bet we will indeed have a performance,\" Bauman said. Some students have volunteered to gather information and put together priority lists for Bauman to use when making plans to bring groups to McCain. \"I'm certainly welcoming student input, not that it's a guarantee, but we can try,\" Bauman said. Most students do not want concerts to die out. \"We've had a petition turned in with about 400 signatures on it. We've had students concerned about the concerts come in and talk to us. We've even had students do persuasive speeches in their oral communications class in defense of concerts,\" Cieslicki said. According to Cieslicki, UPC also does not want concerts to die out. \"If a big one (concert act) comes along, we'll certainly try and get it if we can afford it,\" Smith said. \"It's quite a production when we do anything at Ahearn.\" Most big name acts in the past have performed in Ahearn, but due to acoustics, McCain is better for concerts. However, the seating in McCain is limited to 1,800. Ahearn seats 8,000-11,000. \"Ahearn is bigger by a long shot but it is still a gym. The facility itself is there, but everything else is created. The sounds, the lights, even the dressing rooms. It will never be like McCain,\" Cieslicki said. Future dates for big name acts lean toward busy university weekends. \"I think a direction we will look in will be Parents' Day, Homecoming and some of the major university weekends. We feel especially responsible to insulate those weekends,\" Smith said. University for Man (UFM) has been filling some of the emptiness due to lack of major concerts. Through their Java Jive coffeehouses they sponsor local entertainers to perform, asking for small donations of approximately one dollar. The coffeehouse committee was responsible for the Parents' Day entertainment on Saturday evening, Nov. j 15, when Kimberlite, a Manhattan group, performed in the Catskeller. \"We had the place packed. The Catskeller is a great place for live entertainment. We used a local band and they worked out great. I think too many people close their eyes to local entertainment and that's too bad because they are the ones that give the community a chance to hear some really good music and will perform for an affordable price,\" | Lori Bergen, graduate student and member of the Coffeehouse committee, said. & Diane Doctor 40 lack of concerts .

You're talking space.\" \"Life is hard.\" \"By the way, how'd that test in Calc II go?\" \"It was a bite. Course I didn't put a whole lot of effort into it. In fact I fell asleep reading chapter four. When I woke up it was too late to study so I blew it off.\" \"That's a bad deal, catching Z's when you should've been cramming. My problem is getting away from the stereo. My roommates crank the tunes all the time.\" \"I can relate. A guy that lives down th< hall is into punk rock. That gets old in a hurry.\" \"Really!

Nothing better than catching some rays and watching the women drive by.\" \"Listen, I've got to take off. One more class and I'm done for the day.\" \"Okay, we'll catch ya later.\" This conversation could be heard almost any day on the K-State campus. College jargon used across the nation sets students in a social class of their own. Students at K-State in 1980 conversed daily using terms and definitions specific to their lifestyles. The uniqueness of college students was best demonstrated through their language. $ Jill McAntee Chilly wave — A bare-chested Kurt Pierce, sophomore in mechanical engineering, shows \"typical\" college craziness as he rides on the shoulders of Robin Friedrichs, senior in agricultral general, during the 'Cats football game on Nov. 15.

No, the empty seats weren't caused by a record low attendance but by K-State's traditional band day. The 1980 edition of band day had approximately 6,500 high school students from all over Kansas, some of them driving since 4 a.m. to arrive in time for the 9 a.m. parade down Poyntz. Beginning at fourth and Poyntz, band members marched to the city park where they loaded their buses to head for KSU Stadium to practice. A crowd of over 32,000 watched as Phil Hewitt, K-State marching band director, conducted the mass of students from his perch in the cherry picker. The band members, wearing uniforms in every color of the rainbow, formed the letters K-S-U to play Wildcat Victory. Having practiced before the game, the band exhibited three other special selections. As a particular tribute to Gordon Jump, a K-State graduate and star of WKRP in Cinncinati, the mass band played the theme from WKRP. After a quick change in formation, the bands played God Bless America, while spelling out U-S-A. The tradition of playing the 1812 Overture was given a new look when the bands formed 1-8-1-2, stretching from sideline to sideline. As in past years, the Howitzer cannons from Fort Riley added a realistic volley of fire for grand finale. & Susan Tousignant \"1 \"\"), .» {! \"\";, ,. K-State Kazoos 80's The buzzing of red, blue, yellow and green plastic kazoos started off the 1980 \"Roaring Eighties\" Homecoming celebration. Plans to \"Kazoo Mizzou\" were aided by the distribution of nearly twenty-thousand kazoos. Kazoos were given away by merchants during Homecoming week before the Oct. 25 Homecoming game against the University of Missouri Tigers. An award for the best kazoo band at the pep rally competition was given to Delta Delta Delta and Alpha Tau Omega. Tuesday's College Day competition was won by the College of Agriculture. Students in the eight colleges were encouraged to wear their college or major T-shirts. Each college constructed a banner to hang on the outside of their home academic building. Teams comprised of three students and three professors from each college competed in relay games in the Union Courtyard. Union Day was Thursday with continuous student entertainment throughout the day. Football coach Jim Dickey and the K-State cheerleaders made a special appearance at noon. Friday evening was the annual alumni dance with special music provided by Matt Betton's Palace Jazz Band. The traditional pep rally and bonfire was held at Memorial Stadium at 11 p.m. The K-State marching band, twirlers, pridettes and cheerleaders were on hand to provide plenty of pep and spirit. Homecoming parade on Saturday morning featured floats constructed by K- State living groups to show their homecoming spirit.

Another tour was given by the University for Man through its newly completed solar greenhouse. For many, the main event of the afternoon was the K-State vs. Oklahoma State game. The event was highlighted with pre-game ceremonies, including presentations of awards to show how \"parents can be the sunshine of our lives.\" Cindy Bray, junior in fashion marketing, was the winner of the annual essay contest. She received a $200 scholarship for her essay which explained how her parents have been the sunshine of her life. Mr. and Mrs. Herb Bowman of Lamed were selected as honorary parents for the day. The Bowmans were selected for the honor as a result of an application submitted by their daughter, Shelly Bowman, senior in home economics extension. The award was based on the parents' contributions to K-State, their community, and their son or daughter. After-game activities encompassed special programs sponsored by several living groups. Residents of Ford Hall provided their parents with buttons that stated \"My daughter goes to K-State,\" and Boyd Hall residents sponsored an evening talent show with refreshments following. In addition, Java Jive, the coffeehouse staff, sponsored a special performance in the Catskeller. A full house of mostly parents were entertained by two K-State students, Skip Brod and Fred Schmidt, and by Kimberlite, a group that specializes in folk and bluegrass music. •$ Susan Tousignant parents day 47 0m \\ % Homosexuals reveal identity There are a myriad of emotions and reactions that surface when the homosexual male or the lesbian female take the step towards an honest relationship with their family or friends. For some Manhattan gays, male or female, the decision to reveal their homosexuality comes only after a traumatic and painful process for them. \"The first step-in the coming out process is that of moving towards a recognition and acceptance of one's gayness. Some people become aware of the lesbianism or gayness early in life. Others do not reach that awareness for a long time because of the many social pressures which demand heterosexuality,\" according to a booklet published by the National Gay Task Force. Ron, an architecture student, was married for five years. He has been in the military and told his wife about his homosexuality over three years ago. \"I'd known I had homosexual feelings since I was 15 or 16 years old. I considered myself to be very confused. During high school I didn't know how I wanted to be. I was a space case,\" Ron said. \"I was brought up in a family with a strong religious background. I didn't come to terms with myself until about a year ago. Sue, (Ron's ex-wife) helped me through the rough stages. She probably knew before I did,\" Ron said. After revealing his homosexual tendancies to his wife, Ron informed his parents. \"I wrote a letter to my parents. It was very intense. I followed it up with a phone call. They were very disappointed. They don't accept it,\" Ron said. \"They tend to be the type of people who keep things hush-hush. But my goal was to finally tell my mom and dad, and I have. I wanted to tell them about 5 or 6 months ago before I came out. I'm glad I didn't, they would have rejected me, and that would have set me back,\" he said. \"I'm just now in the beginning stages of adjustment with my parents,\" Ron said. Mary, an art major, is a lesbian feminist. \"The wonderful thing about being a lesbian feminist is that we are very supportive of the individual. Not to base the relationship on two people, but on a one to one level, where equality is of photo by Craig Chandler primary importance. You end up with an abundance of support and not criticism,\" Mary said. \"Women have been victimized by the whole idea of love. Women live in a fantasy world in regards to love. Love puts you into a submissive position. It puts men in the dominant role. It's not a relationship based on equality. It's like for a woman to be satisfied or fulfilled in her life she has to please the male. Even when she makes a decision it's to please a male. A woman justifies her place in society through the illusion of romantic love,\" Mary said. Even with Mary's beliefs she has not yet come to terms with her sexuality enough to tell her mother about it. She fears the loss of her mother's love and support. \"Society tells you that you're wrong to have 'those' feelings. It's wrong. It's sick. You're a de- viate. You're perverted. You're disgusted with yourself so you go through a whole period of self hatred.\" \"It bothers me that I can't be open with her. I think it's because I fear my mother would reject me. Not so much that she personally wouldn't try to understand, in a way that's me classifying her into a stereotype. It becomes a question of duality, a contradiction. I want to tell her very much, but I don't want to lose her.\" \"It's hard not to be able to share the fact that I love women with my mother. It's real hard for me to think that my lover will never know my mother as deeply as I can,\" Mary said. Jim is a student at K-State. The signs and feeling for the gay lifestyle have been with him for as long as he remembers. \"I had no attraction to women, I remember wondering about it. During my senior year in high school I dated one girl, and it was a nice relationship, but it wasn't what I truly wanted. When I was finally in a relationship that I could truly feel comfortable in, it was one that I couldn't tell my parents about. I wanted to tell them 'Mom! Dad! I'm happy! I'm carrying on a relationship that I love!' but unfortunately I couldn't.\" According to Jim when he told his parents about his life choice it was very emotionally draining. \"My mother and father sat down on the couch, she did the talking, they were clear across the room. My mother told me that they were aware of my 'identity problem', and they felt it was necessary to discuss it; discuss what could be done about it. I told them I was gay. My father was sitting holding a book in his hands, smoking a pipe. He bit his pipe and broke the book in two. My mother was wringing her hankerchief,\" Jim said. To satisfy his parents wishes, Jim went to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist pronounced him to be healthy, sane and fully aware of what his choice entailed, he said. \"My parents were furious when they found out that the psychiatrist wanted to see them. He thought the root of my homosexuality was environmental. \"It broke my parents apart as far as» talking about my homosexuality. But things have started to fall into place. I have gained the respect of my mother and father. My father trys to listen now. My mother is a good friend. I know she will be a confidant in the coming years,\" Jim said. \"All through my adolescence the square peg didn't fit. But now I find that in this community that acceptance is there,\" Ron said. The fact that Manhattan is a small university town has, according to the homosexual group, helped them to find a more stable and accepting atmosphere in which to live. \"Manhattan has the type of community where gays are able to establish couple relationships. You see a lot of stable homosexual relationships. What you would . expect to find in any relationship. The university and the Manhattan community have been very responsive in listening to the gay community,\" Lisa said. \"I've become really strong since coming out. My door is always open to anyone who wants to talk. People may ask, 'Why do you need to be open? Why do you need to talk about it?', The answer to that is, it's so much harder by yourself.\" Jim said. & Denise Harvey gay liberation 49 Drink and drown Bar specials yield beer wars War. There is always some type of war going on. In the 1960s it was the gas war. Oh, those wonderful years of cheap gas. Then, in the 1970s it was Star Wars invading the galaxies. Now in the exciting decade of the 1980s the war which is being fought right here in Manhattan is the great beer war. That's right folks, beer wars. This wonderful battle is the result of specials which are offered by the local bars. Although wars are not usually welcomed with opened arms, this type of war is welcomed with opened mouths. Perhaps the term bar specials should be defined. Specials are cheap beer drinks. Examples would be 3-fers, happy hour and drink and drown. The reason bars have specials is to attract more business, hoping to increase profit. \"We have specials to draw the people in,\" said one bartender. \"And that's usually what happens.\" I would seem that no student could pass up a bargain. With the cost of higher education rising and the pressure college students are going through, a cheap outlet is needed. \"Bar specials are the best. I couldn't afford to get drunk unless it was during a special. I'm on a budget, you know,\" :ommented a budget-minded student. Money or the lack of it is what attracts Tiany students to the specials. Yes, the ainch of inflation has hit the beer drinkers if Manhattan. \"I don't want to stop going to bars,\" admits one avid beer drinker, \"so I wait until a special comes arond. My favorite special is drink and drown.\" The concept of drink and drown includes paying only a cover charge and downing as much beer as is possible. The price of drink and drown is higher for the guys, assuming that they drink more. This is a real bargain for the gals who are heavy drinkers. Another favorite special is the T-shirt special. This is when a T-shirt is given to a person buying a certain number of \"I couldn't afford to get drunk unless it was during a special.\" pitchers of drinks. \"I have every T-shirt you can get from specials,\" said a well-dressed student. \"Give me any day and I can name the specials going on. Let's take Thursday. After chem lab I go and get cheap fish bowls. Then on Friday, ah those TGIF specials are everywhere,\" claims one student. Unannounced specials are common at one bar. These range from a free keg to quarter fishbowls. Although they do not occur on a regular basis, they are warmly received by the customers. With the exceptions of TGIF specials, most of the cheap rates are during the week, and students take advantage of the discounts — classes the next day or not. \"You condition yourself to drink on weeknights. It doesn't affect my classes. Well, maybe just a little, but I can't resist a special,\" one student said. Since the price of beer has gone up in the bars it would seem logical and cheaper to buy beer in the grocery stores. But the social disadvantages seem to outweigh the cheaper price. \"Sure I buy beer at a store, but how often do you meet girls in a grocery store?\" confessed one male. \"That's why I like the bar scene.\" \"Every Tuesday I see the same kids in here for the same specials,\" a bartender said. The basic reason bar specials are so popular with students is because it saves them a few bucks. They are able to go to a bar and have a good time on a cheap drunk. While the majority of students do enjoy the specials, there are those who disagree. \"Nope, I don't like bar specials. You're supposed to save money, right? Well, every time I go I lose control of my senses and spend more on a special night than I would on a weekend,\" one student said. While a few of the local bars claim they are temporarily out of the beer battle, there are those that are still going strong. This is one war that no one wants to see come to an end. To the brave soldiers who are fighting this battle, this beer is for you. & Colleen Lally bar specials 51 Landon Lecture Series Craig Chandler ((W r. President, students, faculty, ladies UA and gentlemen, please help me to welcome \" The audience politely applauds and the 1980-81 Landon Lecture series begins. The Alfred M. Landon Lecture Series on Public Issues began in 1966 to honor Alf Landon, one of Kansas' most noteable statesmen. The Landon Lectures, held in McCain Auditorium, became the center of statewide controversy when Ian Smith, former Rhodesian Prime Minister, was scheduled to speak. Some students and faculty objected to Smith's appearance stating that he headed c racist government in Rhodesia which violate human rights. K-State officials allowed Smith to speak, but the Landon Lecture designation was withdrawn. Therefore Smith appeared as a convocation speaker. All-University Convocations are held in addition to the Landon Lectures throughout the year. Convocation speakers do not hold the distinctions of Landon Lectures, and the events are typically not as well attended. Consequently, other locations besides McCa Auditorium such as the Union Little Theatn are utilized for convocations. $ John Connally March 20, 1980 — The \"unrealistic attitude\" of Americans and their leaders needs to be changed if the United States is to survive the decade, John Connally, former Texas Governor, said. With a campaign-style speech that could have been used on the trail of his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination, Connally called the '80s a \"decade of danger and decision.\" He was interrupted several times by the applause from a near-capacity crowd in the 1800- seat auditorium. \"The Federal Reserve is going to force a depression on the country,\" Connally said, and added that its policies are going to have a disasterous effect on home building, auto makers and savings and loan associations. The government's policies restricting financial incentives for business have reduced U.S. production capacity, resulting in \"outmoded\" industry, Connally said. While the rest of the world changes production techniques every 10 years, the United States changes only every 30 years. \"Of the 24 modern blast furnaces producing steel in the world today, 14 are in Japan. There's not a single one in the United States,\" Connally said. \"We are the only nation in the world which taxes capital gains. We need to be giving incentives instead of penalizing the industrial sector of the economy.\" Personal savings are another area that need incentives and Connally suggested the removal of tax on savings under $10,000 and a change in the depreciation schedule. At present, he said, the United States has the lowest level of national saving of any industrial nation. Americans should be realistic in their assessment of the nation's position as a world power, Connally said. \"In the past, our allies were time and distance, but that has changed since we split the atom and sowed the seeds of vulnerability.\" The deterioration of the nation's civil \"We have to recognize the reali- ty of the times in which we live. We have lost the prestige and influence we once had around the world because of our loss of military strength.\" defense program and the lack of support for it from the leaders could help lead to our downfall, Connally said. \"By 1983, the Soviets first strike capability will be enough to knock out 95 percent of all our land-based missies. Our first strike directed at Soviet cities, would kill 15 million Soviets because they have shelters to protect them. Their second strike will kill over 150 million Americans because we do not have any shelters.\" ® Gregg Coonrod 52 lectures 1 Edmund Muskie Dec. 4, 1980 — Edmund Muskie, Secretary of State, appealed to the incoming Reagan administration to conduct its foreign affairs with moderation. \"In short, we face a period in which nationalistic impulses will be strong. The great challenge — for us and for others — will be to resist short-term expedients that only mortgage our future security and well-being ... to take an enlightened, longer-term view of our national interests.\" Muskie examined \"some of the longer- term social, economic and technological forces at work in our world that will help define, not just the next few years, but the next decade or more . . . To engage in such a look ahead is not to escape the present choices we face, but to help illuminate them,\" he said.
