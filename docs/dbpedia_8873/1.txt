Jamison is a masculine given name of Scottish, Irish, and Hebrew origin. The name originates from Jacob, a Hebrew name, meaning ‘supplanter.’ Jamison is also a surname in Scottish and Irish and means ‘son of James.’

The English name James is derived from the Late Latin name Iacomus, which is a variant of the Biblical Latin form Iacobus that was derived from the Hebrew name Ya’aqov. In the New Testament, the name James was given to two apostles. They were Saint James the Greater and James the Lesser, the son of Alphaeus. Also, ‘James the Just’ features in the Bible as Jesus’ brother.

Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebecca in the Old Testament and the father of the twelve founders of Israel’s twelve tribes. He was born clutching his twin brother Esau’s heel, therefore, the name is also translated to ‘holder of the heel’ or ‘supplanter.’ The English names Jacob and James are derived from the Latin name Iacomus, a modified version of the Latin New Testament version Iacobus.

During the Middle Ages, Jacob was mainly considered a Jewish name in England, though the variant James was popular among Christians. Jamesson was the first altered spelling of the surname in the 14th century.

Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
