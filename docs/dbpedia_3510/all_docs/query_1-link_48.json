        "text": "To ensure you get a copy of your video on the road, you’ll need to add the scheduled event on Hudl.com with the correct game location, date, time and opponent. We'll take care of the rest with a little magic behind the scenes ensuring the video is automatically uploaded to you and your opponent's library only.\n\nTo put it simply, we’re automating the Hudl exchange process to save you some time and avoid the hassle of requesting game video from an opponent.\n\nThe most important step is making sure your schedule entry is accurate with the correct game location, date, time and opponent. When entering your opponent, be sure to pick an option from the drop-down menu and pay close attention to which team and school you're choosing. (If your opponent doesn't appear as an option in the drop-down, they likely don't have Hudl and therefore don't have Focus either.)\n\nIf a team attempts to schedule a recording that overlaps with a pre-existing event, both the team creating the event and the team with the pre-existing event are notified when scheduling the event on Hudl.com and through the Hudl Focus app.\n\nThis serves two purposes. First, to help coaches understand when they might be scheduling an event incorrectly, and second, to ensure everyone practicing or playing in front of a Focus camera knows exactly when the camera is being used.\n\nThis feature is already available as part of Hudl’s athletic department package. When your whole program is on one subscription, everyone will have access to Hudl and all our other products, including Hudl Focus and the Focus Exchange Network."
