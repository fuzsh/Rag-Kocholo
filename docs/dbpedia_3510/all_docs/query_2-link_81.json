        "text": "In September, we have the historic opportunity to participate in the inauguration of Father Bob Dowd (ND ’87), C.S.C., as president of Notre Dame. Father Bob is just the 18th president in the University’s 182-year history and the first transition in nearly 20 years.\n\nI have met Father Bob several times since joining Notre Dame in 2012. In every interaction, I’ve been impressed with his kindness, his global experience as a scholar that informs his vision for how Our Lady’s University can be a force for good around the world, his emphasis on teamwork as “a way of life at Notre Dame” and his commitment to serving our students. (I recommend watching Lou Nanni’s “For Good” interview with Father Bob and reading Notre Dame Magazine’s profile to learn more about our new president.)\n\nFather Bob played an integral role in creating Notre Dame 2033: A Strategic Framework, which presents Notre Dame’s 10-year plan to become the leading global Catholic research university, on par with but distinct from the world’s best private universities. The framework presents four foundational and enduring goals, which form the basis for Mendoza’s strategic plan: Catholic character, undergraduate education and formation, graduate education, and research and scholarship. The plan also lays out an overarching theme: “Becoming the Notre Dame the world needs will require the University to become better at thinking as an institution.” I find this inspiring and highly relevant to our ongoing efforts to innovate our programs at Mendoza.\n\nFather Bob also is the president and chair of Notre Dame Forum 2024-2025. With the theme of “What Do We Owe Each Other?” forum events will explore how Catholic Social Thought can promote understanding with those whose perspectives are different from our own and bring about healing amid suffering and injustice.\n\nThe inauguration marks a new era for Notre Dame. For all who work here, it’s a wonderful occasion to celebrate as a community. Classes will be canceled on September 13 to allow for full participation by faculty, staff and students in the planned events, and I especially encourage your attendance at the following:\n\nSeptember 11 (Wednesday), 5:00–8:00 p.m.: Celebratory Campus-Wide Inauguration Picnic, Library Lawn. All Notre Dame students, faculty, staff and their families are invited to enjoy free food trucks, lawn games and live entertainment, including a special performance by The High Kings.\n\nSeptember 12 (Thursday), 11:00 a.m.: Notre Dame Forum: What Do We Owe Each Other? DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Leighton Concert Hall. Father Bob’s inaugural Forum symposium will feature a series of special “fireside chats” with international leaders in global development, philanthropy and the future of technology.\n\nSeptember 13 (Friday), 2:45 p.m.: Convocation and Inauguration Ceremony, Joyce Center Purcell Pavilion. All faculty are invited to assemble at the Main Building on Friday afternoon to process to the Joyce Center for the inauguration ceremony. Faculty will receive information about how to participate in early August, including an opportunity to RSVP for the procession and information on how they may rent academic regalia at no cost through the Hammes Bookstore. Each department is asked to take a photo of the gathered department that day to be added to a book to present to Father Bob as a symbol of faculty support as he begins his presidency.\n\nSeptember 13 (Friday), 8:00 p.m.: Celebratory Concert for Notre Dame Community, Joyce Center Purcell Pavilion. The concert featuring Grammy Award winner Jon Batiste is open to all faculty, students and staff but tickets are limited. Registration is required.\n\nSeptember 16-20 (Monday-Friday): Notre Dame will partner with Habitat for Humanity of St. Joseph County on Inauguration Build 2024. Faculty, staff and students will have the chance to volunteer to help construct five affordable homes on South Bend’s Near Northwest Side. More information on how to sign up will follow.\n\nWith our mission to “grow the good in business to improve the human condition in an ever-changing society,” Mendoza has much to contribute to the future of the University. Let’s help kick off this new era by attending these important events and celebrating the good news of Father Bob’s inauguration together.\n\nIn Notre Dame,\n\nMartijn"
