        "text": "Where do I pick up my pass? Where do I register onsite?\n\nPass pick-up and onsite registration will be available from September 5 at the Industry Centre located on the mezzanine level of the Hyatt Regency Hotel at 370 King St W. For pick-up, please be prepared to show a form of identification or a business card.\n\nOpening hours will be as follows:\n\nSeptember 5–10: 8am–8pm\n\nSeptember 11–15: 8am–6pm\n\nWhat is TIFF’s Code of Conduct?\n\nA cornerstone of TIFF's belief system is that everyone has the right to respect, and to fair and equitable treatment from others. TIFF does not tolerate violence, mistreatment or harassment — verbal, physical, sexual, or otherwise — toward staff, Volunteers, delegates, audience members, or attendees at any of our festivals, conferences, or events. Our staff and Volunteers are committed to ensuring the best possible experience for all our attendees. If the safety of any of our guests is in question, we will take immediate steps to ensure the matter is addressed.\n\nWhat are the payment options?\n\nFor a speedier process, we recommend paying by credit card or debit card. In some cases, you will need to authorize the transaction with your bank before sending payment. If your payment fails, do not create a new registration — our system has saved your progress and we can help you get back on track. Please contact registration@tiff.net for this and any other payment questions. TIFF prefers Visa.\n\nWhat is the accreditation process?\n\nOnce you’ve purchased a pass, we review the details provided on your form. If you qualify for the pass that you’ve selected, we will process your payment and send a confirmation letter. If not, we will recommend a different way of exploring the Festival, like purchasing public tickets. Be sure to complete your registration form with as many details as possible. If we require more information, we will contact you.\n\nCan passes be shared among colleagues?\n\nEach delegate joining the Festival must be accredited in order to access screenings, the Industry Conference, and all other benefits. Passes cannot be shared.\n\nI’ve registered but have not received a confirmation email.\n\nOur accreditation process takes up to three to five business days. If you do not receive a confirmation after that time, email registration@tiff.net. Ensure that our email address is added to your contacts so important messages aren't blocked by Spam filters.\n\nI have a film in Official Selection. Do I still have to pay for my pass?\n\nFilms in Official Selection are eligible for one complimentary Premium Pass for the producer and one complimentary Premium Pass for the sales agent. These passes are not transferable and there is a maximum of three complimentary passes per sales agency. If you are part of the crew, please contact registration@tiff.net. If you are part of the cast, please contact your Film Coordinator.\n\nDoes TIFF have a market? Can I set up a stand/be an exhibitor?\n\nTIFF has an “unofficial market” with a unique business model. Although, we do not offer traditional exhibitor opportunities we do invite National Agencies and their sales agents to spotlight their national cinema at our Industry Centre, located at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the form of a Stand. Agencies may showcase and promote films in selection, presentations, and talent from their region to maximize their visibility to the North American market. If this applies to you, please reach out to sales@tiff.net for more information.\n\nCan I book a market screening?\n\nYes. Market Screening slots are available throughout the Festival and open to films both in and out of Official Selection. Companies will have the opportunity to book in person market screening slots in mid-July. For details, please contact privatescreenings@tiff.net.\n\nWhere can I find a list of industry professionals attending TIFF?\n\nThe Delegate List outlines all industry professionals attending the Festival. This is a useful resource only available for registered delegates to help them identify people they would like to meet. The Delegate List is available through our online Delegate Resources portal, and login information can be found in your accreditation confirmation email.\n\nDo you have a discounted pass for students and scholars? How can I request one?\n\nWhat is Cinando?\n\nAm I eligible for Industry accreditation?\n\nIndustry accreditation is intended for film professionals who have been active in the film industry over the past two years. Our resources are primarily geared toward those operating as producers, sales agents, distributors, exhibitors, talent agents, and writer-directors.\n\nIf you are a newcomer to the film industry (under two years of professional experience), a scholar, and/or a student, we recommend our Conference Pass.\n\nI have accessibility needs. How can you help?\n\nWe strive to accommodate passholders with accessibility needs. For more information, please contact registration@tiff.net. Members of the public should contact Customer Relations at customerrelations@tiff.net.\n\nHow can I support emerging filmmakers from underrepresented communities?\n\nHelp us continue to support emerging and diverse talent by donating a pass and providing them with access to the Festival’s Industry Conference, Press & Industry screenings, and networking tools. Since 2020, we’ve supported 750 creators in collaboration with community organizations and partners. Industry leaders like you can support this initiative here.\n\nCan I enter my event with a screenshot or print out of my ticket?\n\nNo. Your barcode includes leading-edge technology with fraud and counterfeit protection, so screenshots or printouts cannot be used. If you or a colleague, or client arrive at a TIFF screening with a screenshot, entry will be denied. Support can only be provided to the original ticket holder. Government ID and the payment method for this transaction will be required for assistance.\n\nCan I transfer my advanced tickets to a colleague if I'm not using them?"
