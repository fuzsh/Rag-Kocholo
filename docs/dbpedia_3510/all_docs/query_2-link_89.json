Advance availability often sells out a few days ahead, particularly for weekend timeslots and between 11.00 and 15.00 during the week. The final two weeks of most exhibitions are when they’re busiest, and it’s always recommended to book if you’re planning to visit during these times.\n\nBooking online, how do e-tickets work?\n\nIf you book online, you will receive PDF e-tickets by email. When you book online you will receive a booking confirmation email, followed by an e-ticket email which contains a pdf document of your e-tickets. These can be added to an e-wallet, left as a PDF email attachment, or printed. You will be required to show the PDF e-ticket at the exhibition/event entrance on a phone or tablet, or a printed version, to be scanned.\n\nIf you have booked Tate Collective tickets (for 16-25 year olds) you will be required to show proof of age ID when tickets are scanned upon admission.\n\nIf you book online you do not have the option to have tickets printed and posted (or collected).\n\nBooking by phone, how do I get my tickets?\n\nWe will send you e-tickets.

Tate may occasionally charge a booking fee for one-off special events and this would be advertised as such.\n\nCan I buy tickets as a gift for someone?\n\nWe don’t sell gift tickets for exhibitions. Paper gift vouchers (in £5, £10, £20 denominations) can be purchased in any Tate shop or by calling +44 (0)20 7401 5167. Gift vouchers can be used to purchase tickets, membership, shop products, and in our restaurants and cafes in gallery only.

If tickets are sold out in advance online further tickets will not be available in the gallery. For up to date information about ticket availability please give us a call.\n\nWill there be queues?\n\nWe always endeavour to help everyone as efficiently as possible. For very popular exhibitions you may need to queue to buy your ticket.\n\nPlease avoid going to the entrance of a very popular exhibition until the time slot on your ticket. If you arrive earlier than your time slot, you may be asked to queue if your tickets are valid for the next time slot. Anything earlier than this, you will be asked to return at the designated time.\n\nFor busy exhibitions, everyone may be asked to queue at the exhibition entrance (all ticket holders, Members, Patrons, etc). This is so we can stagger entry into the first room of the exhibition so it is not overcrowded. This queue moves quickly.\n\nCan I book tickets in advance in the galleries?\n\nYes, you can, providing we have advance availability for the date and time slot you wish to purchase.\n\nHow do I book event/film/course tickets?\n\nTickets for any of our public events programme can be purchased or booked online, by phone +44 (0)20 7887 8888, or in the galleries (during ticket desk opening times).\n\nTickets for events can be purchased up to one hour or more in advance online, or by phone.\n\nHow much do event tickets cost?\n\nPrices do vary, Please check each event online to find out the cost.

We will only operate a returns queue up to 30 minutes before an event starts.\n\nThe event or course that I want to book in advance is sold out?\n\nFor events or films if we have any returns on the day these will become available to a returns queue no more than 30 minutes before the event if we are operating one.\n\nIf a course is sold out we do not offer on the day returns. We do have waiting lists for some courses, in case we have any spaces which become available (will be 24 hours or more in advance). Please contact us to enquire if we have a waiting list for a course.\n\nCan I have an exchange or refund for my tickets if I can no longer attend?\n\nTickets for events are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.\n\nHowever, if you are attending a sold out event and have a spare ticket you cannot use with you, we will accept it for a refund if we have a returns queue. This can only be done up to 30 minutes before the event starts.\n\nMy event starts after the normal gallery closing time. I’m in the gallery already, can I wait inside anywhere?\n\nFor most events, this isn’t possible.
