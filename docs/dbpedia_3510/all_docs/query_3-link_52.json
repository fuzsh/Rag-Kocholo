Find a Seed Exchange location near you.\n\nBorrowing seeds is free. All you need is a Nashville Public Library card.\n\nGrow Plants\n\nNPL’s Seed Exchange offers access to local librarians who will support, coach and cheer you on as you grow your own home, school, church or community garden. We’re also working with local farmers, gardeners and community agencies to offer free gardening workshops throughout the year.\n\nReturn Seeds\n\nOnce the season is over, harvest seeds from your garden and return them to the library. We ask that you follow certain protocol when harvesting seeds to share with the Seed Exchange. We want people who take seed to get what was on the label and we want to protect from passing on disease.\n\nAdditionally, we are always looking for open-pollinated, heirloom seeds from anyone in the community who is willing to share, a little or a lot.\n\nOur Seed Protocol includes guidelines for properly saving and preparing seeds to share.\n\nSee our Seed Protocol\n\nKeep Up with Seed Exchange\n\nSign Up for Email News"
