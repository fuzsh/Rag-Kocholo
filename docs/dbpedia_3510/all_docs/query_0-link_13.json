You may just find yourself wondering where the time went.\n\nPlease note that no outside food & drink is allowed at The Exchange.\n\nAnd now you can enjoy The Exchange Coffee House at home, with our online ordering.\n\nDog-Friendly Patio\n\nPlease note that the outdoor patio of The Exchange is open to your well-behaved dogs, but only trained service animals are permitted inside The Exchange. Pets (including emotional support companions) must remain outside, even while ordering. Thank you for your understanding!"
