        "text": "This fall, Doubleday will publish the sequel to John Grisham’s #1 bestseller THE FIRM. The new legal thriller, THE EXCHANGE: After The Firm, marks the return of Mitch McDeere and will be published on October 17, 2023 and the exciting news were announced on CBS Mornings last week.\n\n“When last seen in THE FIRM, Mitch McDeere and his wife Abby were fleeing Memphis with the bad guys in hot pursuit,” says Grisham. “Now they’re back, fifteen years later, and living in New York where Mitch is an international lawyer and a partner in a mega-firm. His work takes him across the globe, and not always to safe places. During a trip to Libya, his trusted associate is kidnapped, and an execution is threatened unless an enormous ransom is paid. Only Mitch can facilitate the exchange and I hope readers have as much fun with the novel as I am writing it.”\n\n“To have John Grisham’s 49th book return to the world of Mitch and Abby McDeere is truly a full-circle moment,” says Grisham’s publisher, Suzanne Herz. “Over thirty years ago John crafted a brilliant thriller filled with deadly secrets, corporate intrigue, and an unforgettable fictional hero. THE FIRM defined the legal thriller genre and has stood the test of time. Readers will be thrilled to see what happens next to Mitch in THE EXCHANGE.”\n\nTHE FIRM, a landmark publication, has never gone out of print since it was first published in 1991. Grisham’s first bestseller stayed on the New York Times hardcover bestseller list for nearly a year and was adapted into a film starring Tom Cruise, upon which point it became the highest-grossing John Grisham adaptation to date. It was the film that allowed Grisham to walk away from his law practice to become the bestselling author we know him to be today."
