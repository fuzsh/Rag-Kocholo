I have thought about series, but what if you have a collection of series (like, what would all the series of Star Trek be called if they were put into one set)? Simply, I have considered collection and selection, and more aptly, compilation. Collection might work but it seems to general of a word and compilation seems accurate, but kind of sounds like tech jargon. A single word would be nice, but I am open to a two or three word combo. As it sits now, I feel stuck with [unique name] collection series."
