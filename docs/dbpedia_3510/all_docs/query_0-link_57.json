        "text": "Whatever happened to Mitch McDeere, the brash young associate who brought down the corrupt law firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke in John Grisham’s game-changing 1991 legal thriller, “The Firm”? Three decades later, Grisham has resurrected Mitch — or Tom, as I like to think of him, because Tom Cruise played him with such seductive charm in the movie — for another outing.\n\nThe new book, THE EXCHANGE (Doubleday, 338 pp., $29.95), should be a delicious gift to Grisham fans. But once you’ve read it, you might find yourself wishing that Mitch, last seen slipping out of sight while Bendini, Lambert & Locke imploded, had simply decided to while away his days in moneyed obscurity.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case. It is 2005, and despite his earlier experience in corporate law, Mitch — still married to Abby, and now the father of twin boys — has joined the gargantuan international law firm of Scully & Pershing. When one of its associates, Giovanna, a young woman whose physical allure Grisham mentions early and often, is kidnapped by Libyan terrorists, it somehow falls to Mitch to raise the $100 million ransom.\n\nAs he travels to various European capitals trying to wrest money from low-level government officials, the reader is subjected to sloppily written and excruciatingly dull details about plane tickets, car rides, architecture, how long it takes to get from one place to another and virtually every meal the characters eat, all of it weighed down by leaden dialogue. When it becomes clear that the kidnappers are surveilling Mitch and his family’s every move, it’s described this way: “The shock had not begun to wear off; indeed, they were still in the middle of the shock.”"
