        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Heading into next week’s AFM, U.S. sales firm The Exchange has made multiple hires and promotions.\n\nDaniel Gusman has been promoted from VP of Marketing and Distribution to Head of Acquisitions and Marketing while the company has hired Matt Hechinger as Acquisition & Development Director and Yue Wang as Director, Worldwide Sales & Distribution Director with Danyelle Foord aboard as Consultant on Production & Development.\n\nThe staff changes follow the departure of Head Of Production and Acquisitions, Caddy Pantida Vanasirikul, who left earlier this year to join Plan B.\n\nGusman was one of the first employees at The Exchange. In his role as VP of marketing and distribution, he has a hand in the promotion, acquisition, and release strategy of most films on company’s slate. He also negotiated the acquisition of the Pete Davidson comedy Big Time Adolescence with Hulu and Exchange’s first series, Tales from the Void.\n\nHechinger was most recently Director of Acquisitions at IFC Films, where he was involved in acquiring and distributing more than 70 films, including The Death of Stalin and The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Prior to that, he served as an executive on numerous films and television projects while at TWC, including Snowpiercer and Carol.\n\nWang started her career in film as an independent producer. After three years of working on physical production, she joined Miramax focusing on international sales. She sold David Ayer/Jason Statham action film The Beekeeper, Robert Zemeckis/Tom Hanks project Here, genre films such as Confess, Fletch starring John Hamm, and Mother/Android starring Chloe Grace Moretz.\n\nFoord began her career working for AaronKaplan at Kapital Entertainment, where she helped develop numerous TV shows, including Life in Pieces (CBS), Santa Clarita Diet (Netflix), The Chi (Showtime), and Divorce (HBO). She then went on to work at Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment, where she worked on films such as Lowriders, which opened the 2016 LA Film Festival, and American Made, which was directed by Doug Liman and starred Tom Cruise. In 2017, Danyelle helped establish Big Cat Productions, an independent production company, with founder Alexandre Dauman.\n\n“It gives me great pleasure to recognize Danny’s successes through the years by elevating him to this position. And I’m very proud to have such a strong team surrounding me at The Exchange with our new additions,” said Brian O’Shea, CEO of The Exchange.\n\nThe Exchange’s AFM slate includes The Cut with Orlando Bloom and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lucy Liu’s Nobody Nothing Nowhere."
