Photo by Jordan Reznick.\n\nBeginning in May, Cambridge Arts will present Common Exchange, a series of art installations, performances, and exhibitions in and around the Cambridge Common that highlights the historic green as a place where we come together as a community— a place for conversation, a place for sharing ideas.\n\nThe series kicks off with performances and public art at the Common from 3 to 6 p.m. Saturday, May 13. Join an eyes-closed tour (pictured above) of the park to get a new perspective on the accessibility of our shared civic spaces. Fife and drum musicians will play protest songs. A choir will materialize from the edges of the park and come together in harmony at the center. Banners hung around the park will be printed with residents’ personal recollections of memorable moments they have spent there. To prompt thoughts on how traditional public monuments function, a boulder with a cork message board embedded in its side will be placed in the park for visitors to post their own public messages to the community.\n\nPerformances, temporary public art, and projects in which visitors can participate will continue over five months and include the work of 10 artists: Andy Graydon, Paul Ramirez Jonas, Carmen Papalia, Aki Sasamoto, Kelly Sherman, Xaviera Simmons, Allison Smith, Julianne Swartz, Lee Walton and Jon Rubin. Four editions of Common Exchange, a newspaper highlighting themes of the art series, will be distributed for free around the park and across the city. The publication was designed by the Lesley University College of Art and Design’s Community Design Studio and specially printed for the project. Download a PDF of the Full Performance and Event Schedule.\n\nDeveloped to celebrate the park’s recent pathway renovations, Common Exchange is organized by guest curator Dina Deitsch and Cambridge Arts Director of Public Art Lillian Hsu. Through exhibitions, performances, installations, and the newspaper, it will reframe how we experience the historic Cambridge Common.\n\nLIVE PERFORMANCES:\n\nPARK INSTALLATIONS:\n\nEXHIBITIONS:\n\nAlongside performances and installations at the park, Cambridge Arts will host three exhibitions in Gallery 344, at 344 Broadway:\n\nKelly Sherman: April 24 - June 30\n\nAndy Graydon: July 17 - September 8\n\nCarmen Papalia: September 18 - December 15\n\nVisit Gallery 344’s page for updates and details.\n\nFOR UPDATES:\n\nAdditional information about Common Exchange can be found on our website, on Facebook @cambridgeartscouncil, on Twitter @cambridgearts, and on Instagram @cambridgearts. Posts will be tagged with #CommonExchangeCambridge and/or #PerformingTheCommon.\n\n.\n\nDownload a PDF of the Full Performance and Event Schedule.\n\nIn the News\n\nAn Interview with Allison Smith - Big Red & Shiny\n\nCommon Exchange is made possible through multiple partnerships and sources of support, including the National Endowment for the Arts, the Cambridge/Agassiz/Harvard Community Culture and Recreation Fund, the Elizabeth Firestone Graham Foundation, the Artists Resource Trust Fund of Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation, the Community Design Studio of LUCAD, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Massachusetts Cultural Council, the VIA Art Fund, Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University, First Church Cambridge, Holosonics, and the City of Cambridge."
