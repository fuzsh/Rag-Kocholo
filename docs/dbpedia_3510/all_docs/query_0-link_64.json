        "text": "Caravans of Gold - Progressive Web App\n\nThe Block Museum has released a free mobile web app designed to share the exhibition with national and international audiences. Developed with a team of Northwestern students and the University Libraries, the app makes use of recent developments in mobile technology and the minimal computing movement to make an online version of the exhibition widely accessible.\n\nThe app was built to ensure that audiences with limited or intermittent access to network bandwidth and mobile data are able to engage with the exhibition. Presented in English, French, and Arabic, a fully multilingual format offers accessibility to those in the exhibition’s African partner countries and beyond.\n\nThe Caravans of Gold App is a project that attempts to take into account differences in digital access and network availability across the world and in the United States.\n\nThe app is accessible via web browser on computer desktop and iPhone but is optimized for Android – the primary operating system used on the African continent. Android users visiting the site will be prompted to add the app to their phone home screen. The files are cached on the device so that visitors can view the exhibition works offline.\n\nVisit the App Explore the Project\n\nExhibition Publication\n\nThe Sahara Desert was a thriving crossroads of exchange for West Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe in the medieval period. Fueling this exchange was West African gold, prized for its purity and used for minting currencies and adorning luxury objects such as jewelry, textiles, and religious objects. The publication Caravans of Gold, Fragments in Time draws on the latest archaeological discoveries and art historical research to construct a compelling look at medieval trans-Saharan exchange and its legacy. Contributors from diverse disciplines present case studies that form a rich portrayal of a distant time.\n\nCaravans of Gold, Fragments in Time: Art, Culture, and Exchange across Medieval Saharan Africa\n\nThe Block Museum and Princeton University Press\n\nHardcover | 2019 | $65.00 | ISBN 9780691182681\n\n304 pp. | 9 x 11 | 192 color illus.\n\nFeaturing a wealth of color images, this fascinating book demonstrates how the rootedness of place, culture, and tradition is closely tied to the circulation of people, objects, and ideas. These “fragments in time” offer irrefutable evidence of the key role that Africa played in medieval history and promote a new understanding of the past and the present.\n\nPurchase at The Block Museum or online at www. press.princeton.edu\n\nCredits\n\nCaravans of Gold, Fragments of Time is curated by Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Associate Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Block Museum.\n\nThe exhibition has benefitted particularly from the partnership of the following institutions: in Mali, the Direction Nationale du Patrimoine Culturel, Institut des Hautes Études et des Rescherches Islamiques Ahmed Baba, the Institut des Sciences Humaines, and the Musée National du Mali; In Morocco, the Fondation Nationale des Musées, Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, Royaume du Maroc, and the Musée Bank al-Maghrib; and in Nigeria, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments.

They have been joined by Northwestern University faculty and staff including Esmeralda Kale, Alexandria Kotoch, Christina Normore, Rachael Reidl, Zekeria Salem, Amy Settegren, Rebecca Shereikis, and Marc Walton.\n\nCaravans of Gold, Fragments of Time has been made possible in part by two major planning and implementation grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor.

Cheney Foundation, the Illinois Arts Council Agency, and the Evanston Arts Council, an agency supported by the City of Evanston.
