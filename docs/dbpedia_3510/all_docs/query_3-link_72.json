If you are a student from a partner university, you will be provided with a link to the online application form after your home university nominates you to us.

As a large research-intensive university with over 600 degree programmes, students easily find courses that match their academic interests and fulfil requirements of their home university.\n\nParticular strengths are the University’s undergraduate courses in medical sciences and engineering. Study abroad and exchange students may also conduct research in history and/or chemistry while at Aberdeen.\n\nCurrent courses can be found on our course catalogue. Additionally, the course guides/syllabi for our undergraduate courses in the School of Medical Sciences, Medicine and Nutrition can be found here.\n\nMost semester courses are 15 credits, which equates to 3-4 US credit hours, depending on your home university. The normal course load is 60 credits per semester, or approximately 15 US credit hours. Study Abroad and exchange students are examined alongside our full time degree-seeking students. Most classes are examined through a combination of continuous assessment, mid-term assignments and an end of semester examination.\n\nCourse restrictions\n\nWhile we accept students at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, study abroad and exchange students are not permitted to take the following courses:\n\nAny level 5 courses.\n\nCourses in Clinical Medicine and Dentistry.\n\nLevel 4 English or Linguistics courses.\n\nLevel 3 Creative Writing Courses\n\nBM4501 - Biomedical Science Honours Project\n\nEngineering Project Courses (e.g., EG4578, ED251A)\n\nJB, JC, QB, QC, QI and QL coded courses\n\nDiploma in Legal Practice (DLP) courses, as identified by a ‘D’ in the second-to-last digit of the course code (e.g., LS55DA).\n\nAdditionally, students coming for Semester 1 only cannot take any Level 4 courses from the School of Medical Sciences (see list below for subjects covered), as these are all assessed in May.\n\nLimited Course Availability\n\nPlease note that the following courses also have very limited availability, and so will be allocated via an electronic lottery system.\n\nSixth Century courses\n\nEducation courses\n\nLevel 3 English courses - See here for available options\n\nLevel 3 Linguistics courses\n\nField courses (these will only be available to students, space permitting, where the course is mandatory for their degree)\n\nSubject areas by School\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nBiology, Ecology, Environmental Sciences, Plant Science, Zoology\n\nBusiness\n\nAccountancy, Business Management, Economics, Finance, Real Estate\n\nDivinity, History, Philosophy and History of Art\n\nDivinity & Religious Studies, History, History of Art, Philosophy\n\nEducation\n\nCounselling Skills, Education\n\nEngineering\n\nEngineering\n\nGeosciences\n\nArchaeology, Geography, Geology & Petroleum Geology, Marine & Coastal Resource Management\n\nLaw\n\nLaw\n\nLanguage, Literature, Visual Culture & Music\n\nArabic, Celtic & Anglo-Saxon Studies, English, Ethnology & Folklore, Film & Visual Culture, French, Gaelic, German, Hispanic Studies & Spanish, Language & Linguistics, Latin, Mandarin, Music, Scandinavian Language\n\nMedical Sciences\n\nAnatomy, Biochemistry, Biomedical Sciences, Biotechnology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Health Sciences, Immunology, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Pharmacology, Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Sports Science\n\nNatural & Computing Sciences\n\nChemistry, Computing Science, Mathematical Sciences, Mathematics, Physics\n\nPsychology\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial Science\n\nAnthropology, Politics & International Relations, Sociology\n\nIndependent and Interdisciplinary subjects\n\nHistory & Philosophy of Science, Professional Development, Sixth Century Courses, Statistics\n\nAccommodation\n\nStudent Housing\n\nUniversity accommodation is provided to exchange and study abroad students as long as they apply by the stated deadline.

Adam Smith House has catered options, but students should be aware that these may not be as extensive as their own university's meal plans. Therefore, we recommend that students opt for self-catered accommodation. Accommodation normally consists of single study bedrooms with common areas which are shared with roommates.\n\nYou can find more information on University of Aberdeen housing here.\n\nCosts\n\nTuition and Costs 2024/25\n\nSemester: £10,400\n\nFull year: £20,800\n\nEU National Students: Discounted tuition fee for a single semester is £7,900.\n\nStudents from universities which have an exchange agreement with the University of Aberdeen will not be charged tuition fees.\n\nLiving Costs\n\nUK Visas and Immigration indicate that students spending the academic year should have a minimum of £1023 for each month that they will spend in the United Kingdom.
