        "text": "HISTORY PAINTING\n\nRose Wylie is best known for creating colourful, large-scale, figurative paintings that are intelligent, funny, and quietly political. These are usually made from memory and draw on a wide range of cultural references from history, fashion and cinema, to mythology, sport and literature. The thread linking these fields is her interest in how images evolve and accumulate meaning – becoming familiar, iconic and part of the narrative of popular culture and wider history.\n\nThe large-scale paintings at Newlyn Art Gallery include three recent works inspired by the Pilgrims’ voyage aboard the Mayflower, which had a final landing at Newlyn to take on fresh water before sailing to America in 1620. In the lower gallery we will present Ben Rivers’ film What Means Something (2015) which reflects on his friendship with Rose, her painting and the artistic processes they have in common.\n\nAt The Exchange, paintings inspired by celebrities and Quentin Tarantino films will hang alongside more personal memories including her experience of the Blitz during the Second World War, as well as a selection of works on paper that reveal her working process.\n\nRose Wylie: History Painting is a Plymouth Arts Centre and Plymouth College of Art exhibition. At Newlyn Art Gallery & The Exchange it is curated by Ben Borthwick.\n\nGenerously sponsored by Classic Cottages.\n\nListen to Rose Wylie in conversation with Russell Tovey, on Dialogues: The David Zwirner Podcast\n\nEXHIBITION EVENTS\n\nOpening Event: Fri 8 Jun, 18.00 – 20.00 at The Exchange and 19.00 – 21.00 at Newlyn Art Gallery\n\n19.00 at The Exchange – introductions from Director James Green and Ben Borthwick, Artistic Director of Plymouth Arts Centre.\n\nFood from Little Wonder Café at Newlyn Art Gallery.\n\nFree entry, all welcome.\n\nFilm Screening: Tue 7 Aug, 18.00 A special screening of Tarantino’s classic Kill Bill at Newlyn Filmhouse\n\nCurator’s Talk: Wed 12 Sep, 13.00 at St Ives Arts Club, as part of St Ives September Festival. Ben Borthwick will discuss his conversations with Rose Wylie over the last decade, combining the artist’s existing work with a new cycle of paintings made for the History Painting exhibition and how this reflects his approach to curating. £5.50\n\nRose Wylie (born 1934) studied at Folkestone and Dover School of Art, Kent, and the Royal College of Art, London, from where she graduated in 1981. Her work has been the subject of renewed critical attention in recent years, including solo presentations at the Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery, Philadelphia (2012); Jerwood Gallery, Hastings, (2012); Tate Britain (2013); Städtische Galerie Wolfsburg, Germany (2014); Space K, Seoul (2016); Chapter, Cardiff (2016); and Turner Contemporary, Margate (2016). In 2014, she won the John Moores Painting Prize, and in 2015 she was elected a Senior Royal Academician. In June 2018 she was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List.\n\nRead More"
