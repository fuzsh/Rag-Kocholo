        "text": "The Exchange strives to maintain the highest ethical business standards while supporting supplier diversity.\n\nThe Exchange is a multi-channel retailer that procures merchandise from suppliers around the world to meet the demands of our customers and be their first choice. Products are sold across 12,000 facilities worldwide, in catalogs, and online to active duty military, National Guard members, Reservists, and Retirees. This merchandise is continually evaluated for quality, price, delivery time, and customer demand.\n\nBooks, Newspapers and Magazines\n\nThe majority of books and publications are supplied to exchanges by local distributors serving the area in which the exchange is located. Contracts with distributors are on a guaranteed sales basis and require the contractor to provide in-store service and remove unsold and outdated publications. Sales of hardbound books are extremely limited in the exchanges.\n\nFor selling books and publications within the Exchange, contact the specific distributor with questions regarding item selection and purchasing procedures. If you have further questions, please contact our books and magazine buyer by email or telephone at (214) 312-6564.\n\nDVD’s Only\n\nThe Exchange currently procures video / DVD titles through a national distributor only. They help us to screen videos to insure that we get only high quality production value items. The Exchange also requires that all DVDs purchased are provided on a guaranteed sales basis. This means The Exchange is reimbursed for all unsold materials after a reasonable selling period. This absolves The Exchange of any inventory risk.\n\nContact information for the distributor with whom we currently do business is provided here as a courtesy and reflects no guarantees or promises.\n\nEmail EURPAC\n\nRegulations AR 215-8, AFI 34-211 (I) states that The Exchange will not negotiate, purchase, or otherwise conduct any procurement business (including accepting in-store or other contract service) with active duty military personnel, U.S. Government employees (including NAF employees), or immediate family members of the above who reside in the same household.\n\nCD’s Only\n\nThe Exchange procures assortments from local and national distributors. The Exchange also requires that all CD’s purchased are provided on a guaranteed sales basis. This means The Exchange is reimbursed for all unsold materials after a reasonable selling period. This absolves The Exchange of any inventory risk. At this time we are not looking to add new music distributors.\n\nContact information for independent distributors with whom we currently do business are provided here as a courtesy and reflect no guarantees or promises.\n\nImage Entertainment\n\nAlternative Distribution Alliance Entertainment\n\nRegulations AR 60-20 / AFR 147-14 states that The Exchange will not negotiate, purchase, or otherwise conduct any procurement business (including accepting in-store or other contract service) with active duty military personnel, U.S. Government employees (including NAF employees), or immediate family members of the above who reside in the same household.\n\nContact information"
