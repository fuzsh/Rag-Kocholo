Millions of families are left on the wrong side of this divide, unable to access the opportunities that come with technology. We believe that access to technology is not a luxury; it's a fundamental right. That's why we're dedicated to connecting these unconnected families by repurposing computers.\n\nReuse and Repair\n\nBut our mission doesn't stop at bridging the digital divide. We're equally passionate about environmental sustainability. E-waste is a growing concern, with tons of electronics ending up in landfills each year, posing a threat to our planet. We have a solution that addresses two challenges with one eco-friendly model by refurbishing devices and giving them an extra life."
