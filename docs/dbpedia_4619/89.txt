This eponymous album, their first for 22 years, was released on May 5th, 2017 by Dead Oceans and has been warmly received by the music press…

“Slowdive seem determined to keep stripping back and evolving past the sound that once defined them. Every great band should age so well.” Pitchfork

Simon Scott came into Zigzag last October, to record drums for “No Longer Making Time” (track 6 on the album), after which, all tracks were mixed at Los Angeles’ Sunset Sound by Chris Coady and wow! has he done a fantastic job.
