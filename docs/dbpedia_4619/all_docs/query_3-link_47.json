The title suggests an optimistic, spooky but in a pretty way album and that’s what you’ll get! ‘everything is alive’ is an album that is curious, shimmering and touches on universal feeling.\n\nSlowdive is a band that continues to show their expertise in this genre but by pushing it outwards, beyond the singular, and the result of this record which feels as emotional and cathartic as it is optimistic is proof of that.\n\nSo get curious and go listen to the album now or buy it wherever good music is sold."
