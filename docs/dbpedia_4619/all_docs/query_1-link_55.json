        "text": "I'm fairly new to Slowdive and I'm wondering if anyone else thinks Rachel should have more lead vocals? I think it would fit their sound.\n\nGave the new album a listen last night and thought it was a nice mellow listen that fit my mood.\n\nI love Rachel's voice as well, it's nice when they both sing but I think they get the balance right. Neil has one of the most soothing voices on the planet, almost ASMR like when he sings.\n\nIf you like Rachel, check out this super group side project, great album, and she is the lead singer.\n\nMinor Victories - Minor Victories\n\nShe also has a solo album, a bit more folky but I quite like it:\n\nRachel Goswell - Waves Are Universal\n\nIf you haven't already, you should also check out the post slowdive band, Mojave 3, she sings a bit more in that group, but Neil is still the lead singer mostly.\n\nOh yes it is lol.\n\nRegardless, while nonplussed about the overall laissez-faire atmosphere of the album, I'm sure a lot of it will grow on me.\n\nRight off the top of my head it's my least fave Slowdive release, which doesn't mean bad. The previous release finished so strongly I was hoping for a few tunes to grab me around the neck and draw me right in but they haven't.\n\nNever heard either of those side projects. I'll need to check them out. I recall hearing Rachel's solo album years ago and it didn't leave much of an impression, but perhaps I should just buy a copy and give a proper try again.\n\nWith a lot of newer music my expectations for DR are pretty low. I'll still buy it if I like the music but end up not playing these super compressed albums as much as I might otherwise. Vinyl isn't always a solution either as the pressings are often quite poor as @zombiemodernist mentioned. The whole situation sucks and leaves listeners that like physical product with terrible choices. My tolerance for LP pressing defects is super low these days so I often just end up getting the CD version. CD sales are so niche these days that a version with full dynamics on CD would really be preferable but we rarely get that. Instead we get the same \"made for streaming + smart mono speaker + cheap earbuds\" mastering on disc."
