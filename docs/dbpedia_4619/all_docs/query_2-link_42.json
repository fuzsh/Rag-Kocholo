        "text": "Today, Slowdive present their new track/video, “the slab,” from their highly anticipated fifth album, everything is alive, out September 1st. Album closer “the slab” crashes into existence with skittering percussion, fuzzed out guitars, and ominous synths. Following along slowdive’s electric trail of tracks — the “suave” (NPR Music) “kisses,” and “skin in the game,” “a clarifying shoegaze reset from the masters themselves” (NYLON) — “the slab” continues previewing the sonic breadth of everything is alive to thrilling effect. On “the slab,” vocalist/guitarist Neil Halstead says, “This is the heaviest track on the record and as the name suggests we wanted it to feel like a big slab of music. We wanted it to feel very dense.”\n\nIn conjunction, Slowdive announce a series of listening sessions in New York and Los Angeles where attendees will get a first listen of everything is alive in Dolby Atmos®, and in London with L-Acoustics Creations for an immersive sound experience of the new album. Fans will be able to enter a sweepstakes for a chance to attend.\n\nENTER TO WIN HERE:\n\nLater this fall, Slowdive will embark on a North American, UK and Ireland tour, with North American dates nearly sold out.
