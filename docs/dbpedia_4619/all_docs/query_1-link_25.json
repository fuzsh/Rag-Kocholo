        "text": "Slowdive has announced their return to the US with a North American tour in Spring 2024. This tour follows the overwhelming success of their sold-out fall US tour and the critically acclaimed release of their latest album, Everything Is Alive.\n\nThe tour will kick off at Washington DC’s 9:30 Club on March 4th and conclude at Los Angeles’ Fonda Theatre on March 19th. Tickets for all shows will be available for sale from Friday, December 8th at 10 AM local time.\n\nThe tour, which includes stops in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and New Orleans, promises to bring the band’s mesmerizing soundscapes and dreamy shoegaze melodies to new audiences. This announcement comes on the heels of Everything Is Alive, their first album since the 2017 self-titled release, which received high praise from critics and fans alike.\n\nEverything Is Alive has been hailed as a significant return for Slowdive, with Vulture describing it as “hypnotically gorgeous,” and Billboard noting its “dreamy yet taut melding of their strengths.” Brooklyn Vegan went as far as to call it “perhaps the best record of their career.”\n\nSlowdive Spring 2024 North American Tour Dates\n\nApril 25: Ventura, CA – The Majestic Ventura Theater\n\nApril 26: Pomona, CA – The Fox Theater Pomona\n\nApril 27: Las Vegas, NV – Sick New World Festival\n\nApril 28: Phoenix, AZ – The Van Buren\n\nApril 30: Albuquerque, NM – The Historic El Rey Theater\n\nMay 1: Denver, CO – Levitt Pavilion Denver\n\nMay 3: Kansas City, MO – The Truman\n\nMay 4: St. Louis, MO – The Pageant\n\nMay 5: Indianapolis, IN – Egyptian Room at Old National Centre\n\nMay 7: Louisville, KY – Old Forester’s Paristown Hall\n\nMay 8: Pelham, TN – The Caverns\n\nMay 10: Dallas, TX – Longhorn Ballroom\n\nMay 11: Houston, TX – White Oak Music Hall\n\nMay 12: Austin, TX – ACL Live at The Moody Theater\n\nMay 14: New Orleans, LA – The Civic Theatre\n\nMay 16: Birmingham, AL – Avondale Brewing Company\n\nMay 17: Atlanta, GA – The Eastern\n\nMay 18: Asheville, NC – Rabbit Rabbit"
