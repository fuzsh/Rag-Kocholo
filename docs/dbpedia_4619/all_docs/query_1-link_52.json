        "text": "Photo by Ingrid Pop\n\nShoegaze legends Slowdive continue to prove that they are masters of the genre decades into their career. The British band's latest single, \"skin in the game,\" is a gorgeous, almost painfully slow track that builds so slowly you'll barely even notice. It's almost orchestral in its complex layers of noise. It might just be the oppressive humidity here in New England, but you can almost feel the song flow by you in waves. I tend to enjoy the louder side of shoegaze more than the more quiet side, but when the quieter side is done this masterfully, it's impossible to resist. Most bands tend to slow down thirty plus years into their career, but not all do it as perfectly as Slowdive.\n\nYou can watch the video for \"skin in the game\" below. everything is alive is due out September 1 on Dead Oceans, and is available for pre-order here. For more on Slowdive, check out the band's website. Upcoming tour dates are below the video."
