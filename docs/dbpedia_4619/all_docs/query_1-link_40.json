        "text": "Prior to the release of their new album, Everything Is Alive, this Friday (September 1), Slowdive have announced a series of 2024 tour dates and shared the video for their new song “Alife.” Find those dates and the new video below.\n\n“‘Alife’ is one of the first tunes we finished for the record,” Neil Halstead said in a statement. “Shawn Everett did a really nice job with the mix. We tried so many times to figure out a good mix by ourselves and couldn’t do it… it sort of had us beaten until Shawn stepped in. We decided if he could handle that one he could probably do the whole record. Our friend Jake Nelson did a really nice animation for this song; it takes some of the imagery from the artwork and digs a little deeper into that.”\n\nEverything Is Alive follows 2017’s Slowdive and features “Kisses,” “Skin in the Game,” and “The Slab.”\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
