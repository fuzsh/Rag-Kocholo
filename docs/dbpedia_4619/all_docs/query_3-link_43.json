        "text": "Slowdive have shared an extraordinary new live rendition of 'Golden Hair' in full.\n\nThe song was originally penned by Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett, a cracked solo composition utilising the poetry of James Joyce.\n\nAn early favourite with Slowdive, it has grown to become a key moment of their live set, so exploratory in its shimmering beauty that it occasionally leans on post-rock.\n\nThis new version arrives as part of the Sonic Cathedral singles club – recorded in 2014 at an early re-union show, it was mastered by Neil Halstead and Heba Kadry.\n\nIt's a truly beautiful performance, with Rachel Goswell's evocative vocal perfectly in sync with that textured effects from the guitar.\n\nDriving itself to colossal heights, it's a remarkable live outing, one that neatly summarises the magical chemistry that makes Slowdive so special.\n\nTune in now.\n\nSonic Cathedral will host a tribute to Slowdive tonight – November 14th – at London venue the Social."
