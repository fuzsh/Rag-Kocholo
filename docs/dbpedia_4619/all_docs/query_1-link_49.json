        "text": "Slowdive are a British shoegaze band formed in Reading in 1989. The band consist of Rachel Goswell (vocals/guitar), Nick Chaplin (bass), Neil Halstead (vocals/guitar), Simon Scott (drums 90-94), Ian McCutcheon (drums 94-95), and Christian Savill (guitar). In 1995, the band recorded what is currently their final record, 'Pygmalion'. A misunderstood and widely misinterpreted \"ambient\" record, it took the dreamy guitar sound and warm yet solemn tone of earlier Slowdive to a newer, more minimalist extreme. After the split, Neil Halstead formed the group Mojave 3, while Rachel Goswell and Simon Scott recorded as solo artists. Slowdive reunited in 2014.\n\n[]\n\nSlowdive were regularly played on Peel's shows between 1990 and 1991.
