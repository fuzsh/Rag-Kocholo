Iâm obsessed personally with your OHM Mantra option that I play as I lay down to sleep. In addition , if I wake up ( which is so typical in peri menopause /menopause due to hormone changes)â¦ I restart the app and am back asleep. Iâm very aware of sleep issues in my patients due to the above and my recommendations are magnesium , bio identical progesterone if appropriate, and your OHM mantra ( ie I reference your app). My only negative is I canât figure out how to have at least a thirty minute session of purely the beginning of your OHM mantra. I set the timer for thirty minutes but eventually it ends up in music which wakes me up at times. Legit it puts me to sleep in the beginning and if I wake up â¦ but I really think if we could get the thirty minutes of purely that beginning OHM we women could fall asleep and stay asleep and I can avoid women asking for sleep aids!! Please advise !!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHello,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience with us, and we're thrilled to hear that our OHM Mantra option has been helpful to you, both personally and professionally. We appreciate your dedication to your patients' well-being and your commitment to finding natural solutions to sleep issues during menopause.\n\nWe understand your need for a longer session of the OHM mantra to facilitate uninterrupted sleep. While we don't currently offer a thirty-minute session of purely the beginning of the OHM mantra, we value your feedback and will definitely take your suggestion into consideration as we continue to improve our app and add new features.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find it helpful to explore other meditation options within the app or experiment with different techniques to extend your relaxation period before transitioning to music. We're here to support you on your journey to better sleep, and we're grateful for your support and advocacy of our app.\n\nIf you have any further questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help in any way we can.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSlowDive support team"
