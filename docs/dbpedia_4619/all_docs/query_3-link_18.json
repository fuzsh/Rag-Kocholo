        "text": "Slowdive is bringing their upcoming tour to North America. On Tuesday, the group announced the dates for their upcoming shows across the U.S. in promotion of the group’s 2023 LP, Everything Is Alive.\n\nAfter dates in the UK, Europe, and Asia early in the year, the group will head stateside for a run of shows across the country. They’ll open their U.S. tour in Ventura on April 25 before heading to cities such as Albuquerque, Indianapolis, Louisville, Dallas, Birmingham, and Atlanta.\n\nTickets for all of the shows go on sale on Dec. 8 at 10 a.m. local time.\n\n“We’re incredibly excited to return to the USA next April and May!” the group wrote on Instagram.\n\nComing on the road with the group will be artist Drab Majesty, who has toured with the band before.\n\nSlowdive released its latest EP on Sept. 1 this year, featuring songs such as “Kisses,” “Alife,” and “Skin in the Game.” It marked their first record than their highly successful 2017 LP Slowdive, led by tracks “Sugar for the Pill” and “Star Roving.” (The self-titled album was their first release in 22 years.)\n\nThe band — Neil Halstead, vocalist and guitarist Rachel Goswell, guitarist Christian Savill, bassist Nick Chaplin, and drummer Simon Scott — dedicated Everything Is Alive to Goswell’s mother and Scott’s father, who both died in 2020. According to a press release, it explores the nature of life. “There were some profound shifts for some of us personally,” Goswell said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nTrending\n\nSlowdive’s 2024 North America Tour Dates"
