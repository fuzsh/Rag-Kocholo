        "text": "Cait Stoddard June 20th, 2023 - 11:22 AM\n\nAccording to pitchfork.com, rock band Slowdive have announced their new album everything is alive will be released on September 1 by Dead Oceans. The upcoming album contains the duality of a familiar internal language mixed with the exaltation of new beginnings.\n\nOwing to their deep history, there’s a palpable familial energy to Slowdive in 2023. everything is alive is dedicated to Rachel Goswell’s mother and Simon Scott’s father, who both died in 2020.\n\nIn the press release Goswell shares her thought about the upcoming album.\n\n“There were some profound shifts for some of us personally. Those crossroads are reflected in the many-layered emotional tenor of Slowdive’s music; everything is alive is heavy with experience, but each note is poised, wise, and necessarily pitched to hope. Its unique alchemy subtly embodies both sadness and gratitude, groundedness and uplift.”\n\neverything is alive is exactly what the title suggests: an exploration into the shimmering nature of life and the universal touch points within it. Spanning psychedelic soundscapes, pulsating 80’s electronic elements and John Cale inspired journeys.\n\nThe album lands immediately as something made for the future; which figures, as their fanbase has grown younger and younger as time has gone on, and their influence on forward thinking musical artists continues to prevail.\n\nAlong with the news about the upcoming album and tour, Slowdive have shared their song and music video “kisses.”The Noel Paul directed video is amazing because it is a dreamlike portrait of a Neapolitan teen giving rides to everyone he knows.\n\nIn the press release Paul further explains the meaning behind the music video.\n\nIf this video evokes emotion, it’s largely due to our excellent cast. In particular Charlie and Claudia, two courageous and beautiful souls who threw themselves into their roles and set a tone of fearless vulnerability.”\n\nAs a whole, the music on “kisses” is wonderful because the instrumentation captures the desire of wanting to love a person and the vocal performance is beautiful by how the vocalist uses his deep and dark voice to passionately speak out the lyrics. “kisses” is a sexy tune that can cause listeners to dance while the music blasts the air with lovely sound.\n\nIn light of the upcoming album and song release, Slowdive has also announced a tour that will take them through North America, the United States, and Ireland. Things start in England before the tour stops in Australia, New Zealand, Wales, New York, Washington, D.C., Denver, CO and Ireland.\n\nFor tickets and more information visit: slowdiveofficial.com.\n\neverything is alive Tracklist\n\n1 Shanty\n\n2 Prayer Remembered\n\n3 Alife\n\n4 Andalucia Plays\n\n5 Kisses\n\n6 Skin in the Game\n\n7 Chained to a Cloud\n\n8 The Slab\n\nSlowdive Tour Dates\n\n6-24 Exeter, England – Exeter Phoenix\n\n6-25 Somerset, England – Glastonbury\n\n7-17 Perth, Australia – Astor Theatre\n\n7-19 Brisbane, Australia – Princess Theatre\n\n7-21 Sydney, Australia – Enmore Theatre\n\n7-22 Melbourne, Australia – Forum\n\n7-23 Adelaide, Australia – Hindley St. Music Hall\n\n7-26 Auckland, New Zealand – Powerstation\n\n7-29 Niigata Prefecture, Japan – Fuji Rock Festival\n\n8-5 Mysłowice, Poland – Off Festival\n\n8-11 Sicily, Italy – Ypsigrock FEstival\n\n8-18 Brecon Beacons, Wales – Green Man Festival\n\n9-23 Toronto, Ontario – Queen Elizabeth Theatre\n\n9-25 Boston, MA – Citizens House of Blues Boston\n\n9-27 New York, NY – Webster Hall\n\n9-28 New York, NY – Webster Hall\n\n9-29 Philadelphia, PA – Union Transfer\n\n9-30 Washington, D.C. – 9:30 Club\n\n10-2 Cleveland, OH – The Roxy at Mahall’s\n\n10-3 Chicago, IL – Riviera Theatre\n\n10-4 Saint Paul, MN – Palace Theatre\n\n10-6 Denver, CO – Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\n10-7 Salt Lake City, UT – The Union\n\n10-9 Portland, OR – Crystal Ballroom\n\n10-10 Seattle, WA – Showbox SoDo\n\n10-12 San Francisco, CA – The Warfield\n\n10-14 Los Angeles, CA – The Bellwether\n\n10-30 Glasgow, Scotland – Queen Margaret Union\n\n10-31 Manchester, England – Ritz\n\n11-1 Bristol, England – SWX\n\n11-3 London, England – Troxy\n\n11-5 Belfast, Northern Ireland – Mandela Hall\n\n11-6 Dublin, Ireland – National Stadium\n\nPhoto Credit: Michelle Baptista"
