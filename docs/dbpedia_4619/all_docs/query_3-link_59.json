But it sucked even more back in the stone-age 1990s with all those hideous-looking, inefficient cars and giant paper maps and inane terrestrial radio and all that shit. Plus, Saddam Hussein could have been ANYWHERE! You really had to watch your ass.\n\nLuckily, like we were saying earlier this year, the horrendous 1990s are long-gone, and, having since inherited a sweet efficient SUV with a DVD player and their own copy of Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Slowdive are officially back in action! They’ll be heading out for a full-blown tour, including both European and North American dates, this fall. Significantly, the tour will include a stop in Toronto, Canada, where they played their final show together all those years ago. I know; sounds kinda poignant, right? But how poignant? Let’s ask the band’s press release:\n\nThe fact that the last Slowdive concert was performed in Toronto (at Lee’s Palace) in 1994 is poignant. It felt like we were playing to people who ‘got it’ and some if our favourite performances were on those tours. We have a special connection to our audience in North America and we can’t wait to return in 2014!\n\nWhoa. Sounds pretty poignant. Like… we’re talkin’ heavy-episode-of-Friends-on-NBC’s-Must-See-TV-levels of poignancy here.\n\nSlowdive tour dates:\n\n07.16.14 - Padova, Italy - Radar Festival\n\n07.18.14 - Suffolk, UK - Latitude Festival\n\n07.20.14 - Chicago, IL - Pitchfork Music Festival\n\n07.23.14 - Taipei, Taiwan - The Wall\n\n07.25.14 - Niigata Prefecture, Japan - Fuji Rock Festival\n\n07.26.14 - Shanghai, China - Qianshuiwan Culture and Arts Center\n\n07.28.14 - Hong Kong - Rotunda 3\n\n07.31.14 - Singapore - The Ground Theatre\n\n08.03.14 - Katowice, Poland - Off Festival\n\n08.07-09.14 - Göteborg, Sweden - Way Out West\n\n08.08-10.14 - Helsinki, Finland - Flow Festival\n\n08.09.14 - Oslo, Norway - Oya\n\n08.14.14 - Hasselt, Belgium - Pukkelpop Festival\n\n08.15.14 - St. Malo, France - La Route du Rock Festival\n\n08.23.14 - Los Angeles, CA - FYF Fest\n\n08.29-31.14 - Stradbally, Ireland - Electric Picnic\n\n09.09.14 - Geneva, Switzerland - La Batie\n\n10.22.14 - Washington, DC - 9:30 Club\n\n10.23.14 - Philadelphia, PA - Union Transfer\n\n10.25.14 - New York, NY - Terminal 5\n\n10.26.14 - Boston, MA - Royale\n\n10.27.14 - Montreal, QC - Le National\n\n10.28.14 - Toronto, ON - Opera House\n\n10.30.14 - Chicago, IL - The Vic\n\n10.31.14 - Minneapolis, MN - Fine Line\n\n11.03.14 - Vancouver, BC - Commodore\n\n11.04.14 - Seattle, WA - Neptune\n\n11.05.14 - Portland, OR - Crystal Ballroom\n\n11.07.14 - San Francisco, CA - Warfield\n\n11.08.14 - Los Angeles, CA - The Theatre at Ace Hotel"
