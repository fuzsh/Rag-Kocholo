        "text": "I'm a big fan of the band, my expectations were sky high. They started playing songs from the last album, which I love, but nevertheless the energy was very low. It was leaving me cold. Until they played one of their greatest classics. From that moment I began to float (and I think I was not the only one) throughout the room. Heavenly Experience.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nOkay... So this is actually my first time seeing any shoegaze band live... But from what I have seen about other major shoegaze bands on the Internet I can guarantee that Slowdive is a first-rate watch. Everything from the playing to the lighting were done impeccably and to the taste. Rachel and Niel were excellent performers, but I must own that my favourite musician of the group was Nick the bassist. The man's entirely of his own world and class. When he's on stage he's so drowned in his own playing it's as if no shit of this world can ever touch him. I also had a quick exchange with the band after they came off the stage. All five of them were nice and interesting to talk to, especially Rachel. Anyway, I guess I now consider myself a total \"Slowdivemaniac\", if there ever is such a word.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\ni have only heard of slowdive recently, and decided to go to their concert, i liked the music and the visuals, it would go see them again, overall a good show.\n\nthe only negative was that the vocals were a bit drowned out, not sure if that was due to acoustics at the venue or sound control. Rachel Goswell has a great voice, so it would have been nice to hear her better\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
