        "text": "Thanks for reading the Slowdive Thursday Newsletter. Check out this week’s list of new vinyl, equipment, and Flash Sales! Come visit The Vinyl Underground at 7th Heaven! If you see anything you like, just give us a call and we will hold it for a few days. 816-361-9555 XT304\n\nTHURSDAY FLASH SALE!\n\n20% off all red tag clearance titles! Yep, any title with a red tag!\n\nSlowdive – Everything Is Alive – (Indie Exclusive Crystal Clear Vinyl) and (Regular Black)\n\nEverything is alive, Slowdive’s 5th record, is exactly what the title suggests: an exploration into the shimmering nature of life and the universal touch points within it.\n\nWhile there are parts of this record that could sit neatly next to the atmospheric quality of 1995’s Pygmalion; Everything Is Alive also manages to break down the boundaries of what’s come before it. Spanning psychedelic soundscapes, pulsating 80’s electronic elements and John Cale inspired journeys, the album lands immediately as something made for the future; which figures, as their fanbase has grown younger & younger as time has gone on. For a genre that is often thought of as divisive, and often warrants introspection, here Slowdive show their craft as the masters of it by pushing it outwards, beyond the singular; the end result being a record which feels as emotional and cathartic as it is hopeful.\n\nAnderson Paak – Malibu (Poster, Digital Download Card)\n\nAlice in Chains – Dirt (150 Gram Vinyl, Remastered)\n\nThe Beatles – Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (2017 Stereo Mix)\n\nChildish Gambino – Awaken My Love (Black, 140 Gram Vinyl)\n\nChristine McVie – The Legendary Christine Perfect Album\n\nChristine Perfect is the debut solo album of former Chicken Shack keyboardist and singer Christine Perfect (later known as Christine McVie). The album was released just after Perfect had left Chicken Shack, but before she joined Fleetwood Mac. Released in 1970, the album was originally meant to be titled I’m on My Way as evidenced on copies of the single “I’m Too Far Gone (To Turn Around)”. It was re-released in 1976 as The Legendary Christine Perfect Album.\n\nDavid Bowie – Aladdin Sane (2013 Remaster)\n\nDeath Grips – No Love Deep Web (Indie Exclusive, Limited Edition, Colored Vinyl, Clear Vinyl, Anniversary Edition)\n\nDeftones – Around the Fur (180 Gram Vinyl)\n\nDeftones – Koi No Yokan\n\nDeftones – White Pony (Indie Exclusive, Deluxe Edition, Anniversary Edition)\n\nEarl Sweatshirt – Sick! (Indie Exclusive, Light Blue Colored Vinyl)\n\nWhat we hear on SICK! is the most realized version of Earl to date: a man with the same wandering spirit as before, but with a newfound command of his celebrity. This Earl is far more serene and grounded in who he really is. You feel his curiosity when speaking with him; his thoughts tend to land broadly and touch on everything from African literature to spiritual jazz and ’90s hip-hop before centering on himself. When asked to unpack his own narrative, he tends to speak in terms of we and not I, leaning on the group aesthetic to explain his own rise. The emphasis isn’t surprising, given Earl’s recent love of fellowship, but for an artist who made his name as a loner, his optimism is refreshing to hear. For an album born out of seclusion, SICK! is a moving ode to evolution. As always, Earl is a testament to the healing powers of honesty and self-awareness.\n\nEarl Sweatshirt – Doris (Download Insert)\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer – The Ultimate Collection (Crystal Clear Vinyl, Half-Speed Master)\n\nLegendary progressive rock giants Emerson, Lake & Palmer were formed in 1970 and are regarded as one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1970s, ELP’s first 7 albums reached U.K. Top 10 and U.S. Top 20. ELP are torchbearers of the progressive rock sound and jointly created the supergroup concept, they are among the most important bands in the history of rock music, helping to broaden the genre’s audience into tens of millions. This 2LP gatefold ULTIMATE COLLECTION is the perfect release for new fans who want an overview of who ELP were and what they stood for and existing fans who are looking for a non-stop ride of their immense musical capabilities. Pressed on Crystal Clear vinyl, this release ties together all of ELP’s ballads, rock anthems and prog madness. This release has been mastered at half-speed for superior audio quality by Barry Grint at AIR Studios and is a must have for old and new fans alike.\n\nErykah Badu – Mama’s Gun\n\nElton John – Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (Remastered)\n\nThe Flaming Lips – Doing Dark Side of the Moon (Bonus CD)\n\nFleetwood Mac – Rumours\n\nFoo Fighters – Colour and The Shape\n\nFrank Zappa – Funky Nothingness\n\nFrank Zappa – Joe’s Garage (3LP)\n\nGORILLAZ – Demon Days (Picture Disc Vinyl, 2LP)\n\nJohn Prine – John Prine\n\nJohn Prine – Sweet Revenge\n\nJ Dilla – Donuts\n\nKhruangbin – Mordechai\n\nKool Keith – Black Elvis 2 (Blue Colored Vinyl)\n\nLimited blue colored vinyl LP pressing. Get ready for a mind-bending trip through the Hip hop cosmos with the one and only Kool Keith. Black Elvis is back with his long awaited sequel. Kool Keith takes his information-age rhymes to a whole new level, with a sound that’s equal parts streets and space. Featuring collaborations with Marc Live, Raaddrr Van, Dynamite, Agallah, and the legendary Ice-T, this album will leave you reeling. Plug in your ethernet and dial up to travel through Kool Keith’s multi-verse. Black Elvis 2 is here.\n\nKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – Polygondwanaland (Red Colored Vinyl)\n\nRe-Release. Always masters of the unexpected, King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard have surpassed themselves with Polygondwanaland, the 4th of five albums they tried to release in 2017. Polygondwanaland is a journey into the depths of the mind and the limits of the universe. The Australian 7-piece have made a name for themselves with a steady stream of new material since their inception 2010, blending everything surf rock, prog, soul, folk, metal, garage rock, and even elements of spoken word and cinematic presentation, creating a large buzz and rabid fanbase stretching far across the globe from their Melbourne roots. This album is full of the psychedelic rock outfit’s jazz and groove laden jams.\n\nKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (Venusian Sky)\n\nLed Zeppelin – Physical Graffiti (180 Gram Vinyl, Remastered)\n\nLee Morgan – Infinity (Blue Note Tone Poet Series)\n\nMy Chemical Romance – Black Parade\n\nMy Chemical Romance – Black Parade Is Dead!\n\nMoby – Play (UK Import)\n\nMort Garson – Journey To The Moon & Beyond\n\nMort Garson – Mother Earth’s Plantasia\n\nMichael Jackson – Bad\n\nNina Simone – The Hits\n\nNirvana – Nirvana\n\nNirvana – In Utero (180 Gram Vinyl)\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G. – Now Playing\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – Sour\n\nOrville Peck – Pony\n\nPhoebe Bridgers – Punisher\n\nPink Floyd – The Dark Side Of The Moon\n\nPink Floyd – Obscured By Clouds (180 Gram Vinyl)\n\nPink Floyd – Wish You Were Here\n\nRadiohead – Amnesiac\n\nRadiohead – The Bends\n\nRadiohead – Hail To The Thief (180 Gram Vinyl, 45 RPM, 2LP)\n\nRadiohead – Ok Computer (180 Gram Vinyl, 2 LP’s)\n\nRage Against the Machine – Rage Against The Machine XX (20th Anniversary Edition)\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers – Californication (180 Gram Vinyl)\n\nThe Ramones – Leave Home (Remastered)\n\nSigur Rós – Atta (Gatefold LP Jacket, 2LP)\n\nSigur Rós’ first new studio album in ten years, ÁTTA, is their most intimate and emotionally direct record to date. Few bands cut through the noise and distractions of the world to bring you a pure elemental truth or feeling like Sigur Rós. As you hear on ÁTTA, there’s a new compulsion and drive to the band that comes with the new formation of the line up. Multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson is back in the fold – having left the band in 2012 – to join frontman Jónsi and bassist Georg Holm. Recorded across multiple continents – in the band’s Sundlaugin studio in Iceland, the legendary Abbey Road in the UK and a number of studios in the US – ÁTTA leans heavily towards the orchestral, and touches on everything that has made Sigur Rós one of the most ambitious and acclaimed bands of recent times, with close to ten million albums sold, whilst signposting an exciting and expansive possibility for their future. ÁTTA prominently features the London Contemporary Orchestra conducted by Robert Ames, alongside brass performed by longtime Icelandic collaborators Brassgat í bala.\n\nThe Smiths – Queen Is Dead\n\nSonic Youth – Goo\n\nSoundgarden – Superunknown (Remastered, 180 Gram Vinyl, 2 LP’s)\n\nSteve Lacy – Gemini Rights\n\nThe Strokes – Room on Fire\n\nSublime – Sublime (Gatefold LP Jacket)\n\nTyler Childers – Country Squire (150 Gram Vinyl, Gatefold LP Jacket, Download Insert)\n\nTaylor Swift – Reputation (Picture Disc Vinyl)\n\nTaylor Swift – Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) (Orchid Marbled Colored Vinyl, 3LP)\n\nTyler, The Creator – Call Me If You Get Lost: The Estate Sale (Limited Edition, 180 Gram Vinyl, Blue Colored Vinyl)\n\nViagra Boys – Street Worms\n\nDeluxe bonus Tracks on Download Card.
