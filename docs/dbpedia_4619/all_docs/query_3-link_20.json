        "text": "Slowdive have announced a new album. Everything Is Alive, the shoegaze titans’ first album in six years, arrives on September 1 via Dead Oceans. The band has also announced a tour that will take them through North America, the United States, and Ireland. Check out the video for lead single “Kisses” (directed by Noel Paul), Everything Is Alive’s tracklist and artwork, and the group’s tour dates below.\n\nEverything Is Alive is dedicated to vocalist and guitarist Rachel Goswell’s mother and drummer Simon Scott’s father, who both died in 2020. “There were some profound shifts for some of us personally,” Goswell said in a statement. The album was recorded starting in 2020 in Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire, and Cornwall, and features additional mixing by Shawn Everett. Vocalist and guitarist Neil Halstead further added, “It wouldn’t feel right to make a really dark record right now. The album is quite eclectic emotionally, but it does feel hopeful.”\n\nSlowdive’s last album was 2017’s Slowdive, their first in 22 years.\n\nEverything Is Alive:\n\n01 Shanty\n\n02 Prayer Remembered\n\n03 Alife\n\n04 Andalucia Plays\n\n05 Kisses\n\n06 Skin in the Game\n\n07 Chained to a Cloud\n\n08 The Slab\n\nSlowdive:\n\n06-24 Exeter, England - Exeter Phoenix\n\n06-25 Somerset, England - Glastonbury\n\n07-17 Perth, Australia - Astor Theatre\n\n07-19 Brisbane, Australia - Princess Theatre\n\n07-21 Sydney, Australia - Enmore Theatre\n\n07-22 Melbourne, Australia - Forum\n\n07-23 Adelaide, Australia - Hindley St. Music Hall\n\n07-26 Auckland, New Zealand - Powerstation\n\n07-29 Niigata Prefecture, Japan - Fuji Rock Festival\n\n08-05 Mysłowice, Poland - Off Festival\n\n08-11 Sicily, Italy - Ypsigrock FEstival\n\n08-18 Brecon Beacons, Wales - Green Man Festival\n\n09-23 Toronto, Ontario - Queen Elizabeth Theatre\n\n09-25 Boston, MA - Citizens House of Blues Boston\n\n09-27 New York, NY - Webster Hall\n\n09-28 New York, NY - Webster Hall\n\n09-29 Philadelphia, PA - Union Transfer\n\n09-30 Washington, D.C. - 9:30 Club\n\n10-02 Cleveland, OH - The Roxy at Mahall’s\n\n10-03 Chicago, IL - Riviera Theatre\n\n10-04 Saint Paul, MN - Palace Theatre\n\n10-06 Denver, CO - Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\n10-07 Salt Lake City, UT - The Union\n\n10-09 Portland, OR - Crystal Ballroom\n\n10-10 Seattle, WA - Showbox SoDo\n\n10-12 San Francisco, CA - The Warfield\n\n10-14 Los Angeles, CA - The Bellwether\n\n10-30 Glasgow, Scotland - Queen Margaret Union\n\n10-31 Manchester, England - Ritz\n\n11-01 Bristol, England - SWX\n\n11-03 London, England - Troxy\n\n11-05 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Mandela Hall\n\n11-06 Dublin, Ireland - National Stadium"
