        "text": "By Josh Herwitt //\n\nslowdive with Drab Majesty //\n\nFox Theater Pomona – Pomona, CA\n\nApril 26th, 2024 //\n\nWhen you live in a city as big as Los Angeles, it’s not everyday that you find yourself hopping on the 60 Freeway and embarking out to the county’s eastern edge for an evening of live music in Pomona.\n\nBut nearly 10 years after making the 45-mile trek on a weeknight to catch The Kills at The Glass House (read our show review here), I still found a good reason to do it again and endeavor trying to beat rush-hour traffic on a Friday in LA (pro tip: it takes a lot of patience).\n\nP-Town, as the locals call it, is Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett’s backyard after all. It’s where he grew up and co-founded The Glass House with his brother Perry before teaming up with Goldenovice co-owner Rick Van Santen to conceive the $100 million idea that Coachella would eventually become almost two decades later.\n\nBut it was in 2007 when Tollett partnered with Ed and Jerry Tessier to purchase the historic Fox Theater Pomona, a fully restored Art Deco movie palace that remains one of the Pomona Arts Colony’s flagship attractions more than 90 years after opening. Constructed in the classic “Hollywood Style” and used by movie studios around Tinseltown to host sneak previews of their upcoming films, the building received $10 million’s worth of renovations when the Tessier family took control and restored it into a state-of-art music venue for audiences as large as 2,000.\n\nWith a capacity of that size, the Pomona Fox Theater can attract some top-notch acts every year and Tollett has seized the moment each April since 2012 by booking some big Coachella sideshows there, from Bon Iver and Modest Mouse to Blur and Jungle most recently. Yet, after all these years covering live music, it was English rockers slowdive who finally convinced me to head east again for my first trip to the Fox — and I’m glad that I didn’t miss it after being out of town during their two LA headline shows at The Bellwether in October.\n\nslowdive, believe it or not, have been around for more than three decades at this point. The five-piece out of Reading was formed back in 1989 by primary songwriter Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell but has remained intact despite a hiatus that lasted almost 20 years.\n\nAnd with the group’s label parting ways after its first three studio albums were released by the mid-90’s, it wasn’t until 2017 a few years after reuniting when slowdive dropped their self-titled LP that captivated a whole new swath of fans, who quickly jumped on the bandwagon upon hearing dreamy cuts “Slomo”, “Star Roving”, “Sugar for the Pill” and our personal favorite, “No Longer Making Time” toward the end of the eight-track effort.\n\nI will be perfectly honest and admit that I have not always been the biggest fan of shoegaze. The alt/indie-rock sub-genre that had exploded out of Ireland and the UK in the late 80’s when I was a youngster had escaped me amidst the hair-metal scene and subsequent tidal wave of grunge rock during the early 90’s that my older brother turned me onto. I had completely missed the boat on My Bloody Valentine until much later on and never found myself diving into RIDE or Lush, which left me largely unaware of the movement that has paved the way for more recent acts, including DIIV, Hotline TNT, bdrmm and even Silversun Pickups (Pitchfork actually published a piece on shoegaze’s revival prior to the end of last year, citing slowdive’s “phoenix-like rise from the ashes in recent years” here).\n\nBack inside the Fox where a capacity crowd eagerly awaited their arrival onstage, Goswell (vocals, guitar, keyboards, tambourine), Halstead (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Nick Chaplin (bass), Christian Savill (guitar) and Simon Scott (drums) made their presence known just after 9 p.m. with the opening track to their fifth full length Everything Is Alive that arrived in September via Dead Oceans. But it was older material such as the ensuing “She Calls” from the band’s 1992 compilation Blue Day that caught us by surprise as the constant wash of guitar distortion and echoing vocals put us in a trance-like state for the remainder of slowdive’s 90-minute performance.\n\nIf there was anything from the show we could nitpick, it was probably that we didn’t get to hear “Slomo” after it was played a day earlier at The Majestic Ventura Theater, and while we had considered heading north for that date instead, our first time seeing slowdive was far from underwhelming. “Souvlaki Space Station” followed by “kisses” served as one highlight, while an encore beginning with what has become their most popular hit “Sugar for the Pill” and a cover of Syd Barrett’s “Golden Hair” that understandably felt psychedelic in its nature provided a euphoric ending for the long drive home. slowdive might not be the loud rock ‘n’ roll concert you are looking for, but there’s no question — effects pedals and all — that they have carved out quite the following since their reformation. Because with the way things have been trending for them of late, we sure hope they don’t slow (no pun intended) down anytime soon.\n\nSetlist:\n\nshanty\n\nShe Calls (started, and abruptly stopped by Rachel, then played in its entirety)\n\nStar Roving\n\nCatch the Breeze\n\nAvalyn\n\nskin in the game\n\nCrazy for You\n\nchained to a cloud\n\nSouvlaki Space Station\n\nkisses\n\nAlison\n\nWhen the Sun Hits\n\n40 Days\n\nEncore:\n\nSugar for the Pill\n\nGolden Hair (Syd Barrett cover)\n\nOutside Lands Music and Arts Festival //\n\nGolden Gate Park – San Francisco\n\nAugust 9th-11th, 2024 //\n\nIt has been more than six weeks since a major music festival in California announced its 2024 lineup, but as we look toward the summer and fall, it’s usually around this time on the calendar when Outside Lands targets its annual reveal.\n\nAnd after celebrating a 15th anniversary last year that saw Kendrick Lamar, Foo Fighters and ODESZA atop the lineup, the three-day event is back in SF with a completely new cast of headliners for Year 16.\n\nTyler, the Creator, The Killers and Sturgill Simpson will lead the way while a fourth headliner — similar to what Coachella has done for the past three years — has been introduced for the first time and the honor will go to Post Malone, who headlined OSL in 2022 and will now perform a special country set much like he will do at Stagecoach this upcoming weekend at the Empire Polo Club. The Killers are the only other ones of that foursome to have previously been a headliner at Golden Gate Park almost a decade ago.\n\nIf you aren’t fanning out to those aforementioned acts though, don’t fret because OSL’s undercard still has a lot of other music to offer. Standing out on this year’s bill are The Postal Service, Grace Jones, KAYTRANADA, JUNGLE, Chris Lake, Gryffin, Snoh Aalegra, Young The Giant, ScHoolboy Q, Teddy Swims, Reneé Rapp, Victoria Monét, Knock2, Slowdive, Killer Mike, Fletcher, TV Girl, Tyla, Chappell Roan, Channel Tres, Charley Crockett, Men I Trust and Ben Howard to name more than just a few on the poster above. Check out the rest of the artists coming to the Bay Area this August up there.\n\nOf course, we can’t forget to also mention the return of the SOMA Tent, which will continue to be the fest’s home for all things dance music and has booked Angrybaby, The Blessed Madonna, Idris Elba and Seth Troxler, among others, to join the party from Friday to Sunday.\n\nThree-day GA, GA+, VIP and Golden Gate Club passes go on sale here for $465, $715, $1,075 and $5,0985 this Wednesday, April 24th at 10 a.m. PT, and in the meantime, peep our previous coverage here before you complete your purchase!\n\nUPDATE (May 29th): Daily lineups have arrived, and we now know which artists will be playing each day. The Killers have been tabbed to headline Friday with Tyler, the Creator on Saturday and Sturgill Simpson closing things out Sunday. Make sure to review the daily schedules above before single-day tickets go on sale here for $199 (GA), $319 (GA+), $469 (VIP) and $2,249 (Golden Gate Club) at 10 a.m. PT this Thursday, May 30th. Still thinking about going to OSL for the whole weekend? Three-day passes for all tiers are available here, but who knows for how long!\n\nUPDATE (June 20th): Tyler, the Creator has canceled his headlining set Saturday at OSL for personal reasons, and replacing him will be 25-year-old singer Sabrina Carpenter after her performance on the main stage at Coachella earlier this year. See the updated 2024 roster above, and pick up your tickets while you still can here!\n\nUPDATE (July 23rd): Set times have arrived. See the schedules above to find out what your biggest scheduling conflict will be this August.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that 2023 marked the first time since Earth was rocked by a global pandemic three years ago that COVID-19 was no longer a public health emergency. After everything we have endured since 2020, we could finally breathe (no pun intended) a sigh of relief. And over the last 12 months, the live music industry continued its recovery, with fans packing stadiums, arenas, amphitheaters, theaters, bars and clubs all around the world to experience one of life’s great pleasures.\n\nSeeing people come together to celebrate music — no matter where it is — is always a beautiful thing to witness, and we feel fortunate to have been there for some stellar moments in live music this year while also sharing many in this space. There was a three-hour marathon by King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, the long-awaited return of Mr. Bungle and Les Claypool’s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade to the road (and stage), Goose winning over new fans and Run the Jewels commemorating their 10th anniversary with a star-studded residency tour to name only a few of them.\n\nBut with coronavirus in the rearview mirror and 2024 arriving soon, it’s time for us to uncork our annual “Best of” lists as we have done since this blog first started (see our 2022 picks here). As we always say, we will be the first to admit we didn’t attend every show or hear all of the albums released in 2023, but recapping the year that was can be still a fun and yet challenging exercise, too.\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2023.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2023:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2023\n\n1. My Morning Jacket at Red Rocks Amphitheatre – Morrison, CO – August 25th-26th\n\nPicking the same band at the same music venue around the same time on the calendar for the second straight year might not seem all that interesting to those who happen to be reading this. But having the opportunity to photograph one of my favorite bands at one of the world’s best places to catch a concert was too special not to highlight here. From Jim James showing up early to play with M. Ward during his opening sets to the latter sitting in with the Louisville-bred outfit both nights, MMJ shows at Red Rocks just hit a little bit different and 2023 was no exception. Friday’s performance marked the first of several dates to honor the 20th anniversary of It Still Moves, while Saturday’s was particularly memorable this year with a cover of Traffic’s “Feelin’ Alright?” featuring a guest appearance by Nathaniel Rateliff and a four-part “Cobra” sandwich during the encore that reminded us how magical taking in a concert can be at “the birth canal of the universe” as James calls it.\n\n2. Queens of the Stone Age at The Forum – Inglewood, CA – December 16th\n\n3. King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard at Hollywood Bowl – Los Angeles, CA – June 21st\n\n4. Jack White at The Belasco – Los Angeles, CA – January 13th\n\n5. Les Claypool’s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade at The Wiltern – Los Angeles, CA – July 14th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2023\n\n1. Queens of the Stone Age – In Times New Roman…\n\nThe last few years have been filled with a tidal wave of emotional pain for Josh Homme. From his public divorce and custody battle to the deaths of friends and colleagues, it’s not surprising that the lead single on Queens of the Stone Age’s eighth studio album was entitled “Emotion Sickness”. But the fact that the 10-track LP didn’t make the cut for any year-end consideration by most of the major music media outlets is almost unconscionable to me. Regardless of what they think, In Times New Roman… to us is another masterpiece with Homme showcasing more vulnerability than we have ever seen from him before. Plus, after 25 years we can’t imagine finding a better cast of sidekicks in modern rock than what Queens have with Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). There are only a few great rock bands out there that are still innovating and pushing boundaries, and In Times New Roman… proved QOTSA are once again unquestionably one of them.\n\n2. Gorillaz – Cracker Island\n\n3. Royal Blood – Back to the Water Below\n\n4. Say She She – Silver\n\n5. Slowdive – everything is alive\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2023\n\n1. Queens of the Stone Age – “Paper Machete”\n\nAs much as I liked the first two singles that were released off In Times New Roman…, it was the third hit that became an instant earworm for me this past summer. “Paper Machete” is the album’s shortest track at slightly more than three minutes, but it has that old-school QOTSA sound from Homme’s early days in the stoner-rock group Kyuss and a killer guitar solo by Van Leeuwen we would be remiss not to mention. And though some might consider it to be a diss track if there ever was one in rock ‘n’ roll, we will say that the lyrics beautifully paint a picture of “pain and misery” — as Homme sings toward the song’s finish line — in a metaphorical sense. Who said you need a lot of time to make a statement? Not Homme (or us).\n\n2. Gorillaz – “Cracker Island” feat. Thundercat\n\n3. Royal Blood – “Tell Me When It’s Too Late”\n\n4. The Chemical Brothers – “No Reason”\n\n5. Explosions in the Sky – “Moving On”\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2023\n\n1. Botch at The Regency Ballroom – San Francisco, SF – December 12th\n\nHoly hell, this show left me with zero face…. like, my face was not present afterwards. Both opener Kowloon Walled City and Botch dished out massive sets of music that thankfully sounded crisp, even given the Regency’s typical boomy nature. This was Botch’s last show of their reunion tour, and they showed zero signs of wear, delivering an incredible performance. Fun point of the night was Botch bassist Brian Cook calling out members of the crowd who claim to have attended their shows at Gilman Street and The Stork Club back in the day, saying “you’re lying because NO ONE was there.” Can you imagine that?\n\n2. Sunny Day Real Estate at The Regency Ballroom – San Francisco, CA – April 8th\n\n3. Hammered Hulls at The Ivy Room – Albany, CA – May 5th\n\n4. The Postal Service & Death Cab for Cutie at The Greek Theatre – Berkeley, CA – October 10th\n\n5. High Vis at Neck of the Woods – San Francisco, CA – July 30th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2023\n\n1. Samiam – Stowaway\n\nI knew that Samiam were going to be releasing new music this year, and I was already really hyped to hear it. Stowaway sees the band picking up right where they left off, with catchy, singalong choruses and a masterclass in post-hardcore musicality. It’s a tremendous effort from a band that already has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it knows how to create incredible LPs.\n\n2. Paint It Black – Famine\n\n3. Flying Raccoon Suit – Moonflower\n\n4. Snooper – Super Sn​õ​õ​per\n\n5. Black Pumas – Chronicles of a Diamond\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2023\n\n1. Militarie Gun – “Very High”\n\n2023 was a huge year for Militarie Gun. Their new album is a monster and made my Top 10, but this track may have been the one that stuck with me the most over the last 12 months. It’s got a killer hook and has that always welcome “all killer, no filler” quality to it. The chorus captures a bit of a Stone Roses essence without sounding like they are aping that sound at all. Overall, my feel good hit of the summer — and entire year.\n\n2. Samiam – “Crystalized”\n\n3. Fat Heaven – “Quarter Life Crisis”\n\n4. The Blackburns – “Chill City Population You”\n\n5. Cory Hanson – “Wings”\n\nRochelle Shipman // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2023\n\n1. Ron Gallo at Gold-Diggers – Los Angeles, CA – September 21st\n\nI caught about 60 seconds of Gallo’s set at South by Southwest in a rush to a different stage, and those few seconds played on a loop in my mind for weeks. Six months later, I finally got a chance to see the Philadelphia garage rock star up close, and he blew what little was left of my mind with some relatable hard truths and a blazing performance. It was somehow both perfectly measured and chaotic; he even shredded using a barstool as his guitar pick at one point.\n\n2. Little Simz at The Novo – Los Angeles, CA – October 3rd\n\n3. Kari Faux at The Echo – Los Angeles, CA – November 7th\n\n4. Tierra Whack at The Broad – Los Angeles, CA – August 26th\n\n5. The Cure at North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre – Chula Vista, CA – May 20th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2023\n\n1. Little Simz – NO THANK YOU\n\nTechnically a mid-December surprise release in 2022, this album got cheated out of inclusion on any year-end list so I’m making it right. It’s an absolute fireball follow-up to 2022’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, and if it wasn’t crystal clear before, Little Simz is here to stay. Fingers crossed that she will have mercy on us and keep rolling out some of the other bangers in the vault she has been hoarding.\n\n2. Ron Gallo – FOREGROUND MUSIC\n\n3. Islands – And That’s Why Dolphins Lost Their Legs\n\n4. Avey Tare – 7s\n\n5. Noname – Sundial\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2023\n\n1. Tele Novella – “Hard-Hearted Way”\n\nThere’s something about the magic in Natalie Ribbons’ voice that makes you feel like the main character in the newest Wes Anderson movie. It’s whimsical and romantic, bringing a sweetness to a song that’s named after being anything but. Not a single track is worth a skip on the Texas duo’s newest LP Poet’s Tooth, but this one remains a strong and emotional standout.\n\n2. Little Simz – “Gorilla”\n\n3. Ron Gallo – “AT LEAST I’M DANCING”\n\n4. Lando Chill – “Believe Me Lonely”\n\n5. slowthai – “Never Again”\n\nBy Josh Herwitt //\n\nWhether you’re born and raised, a transplant or just visiting from out of town, Los Angeles has a music scene that not many other cities around the world can rival.\n\nSure, it’s true that New York City and Las Vegas have also been tagged with the “Entertainment Capital of the World” label, but when it comes to live music, there’s something for everyone in LA. From arenas and amphitheaters to clubs and theaters, LA County remains home to more than 50 music venues that are currently in operation. There’s the iconic Hollywood Bowl (read our past coverage here), legendary Troubadour and the state-of-the-art YouTube Theater, although we would be remiss to not mention the Greek, Orpheum, Roxy and Wiltern, too.\n\nBut with mega promoters AEG and Live Nation maintaining a stranglehold on the marketplace, is there really room for another music venue in LA and one that’s actually independent?\n\nMichael Swier and Gregg Perloff believe so. That’s why three years after signing the lease on a 45,000-square-foot property west of the 110 Freeway and adjacent to downtown LA, the two business partners opened The Bellwether in July as one of the city’s newest nightlife destinations and have already seen acts like Carly Rae Jepsen, HAIM, Phantogram, Silversun Pickups, Slowdive and Wilco grace its stage.\n\nSwier is no stranger to the live entertainment business. He cut his teeth running music venues in the Big Apple, turning Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge into Manhattan mainstays on the Lower East Side before taking that success cross country to LA where he owns and operates the Teragram Ballroom and Moroccan Lounge. Perloff, similarly, has a wealth of knowledge and experience after working alongside renowned promoter Bill Graham and putting on shows for a couple of decades as the CEO of Bay Area company Another Planet Entertainment, which has organized the annual Outside Lands Music Festival (read our past coverage here) since 2008. So with both Swier and Perloff at the helm, it should be safe to say that The Bellwether rests in good hands.\n\nThe space itself, meanwhile, is gorgeous despite its immediate surroundings externally. While the City West and Westlake neighborhoods are some of the remaining few in LA that have yet to gentrify at all, inside the vibe feels like a completely different world than what lies right outside its front doors. The big horseshoe bar in the foyer greets guests as they come in, and if you get there early enough, you might have some time to check out the outdoor lounge that offers a 270-degree view of the downtown skyline or go VIP with an upgraded ticket to the Looking Glass Lounge.\n\nBefore we go any further, there’s some pretty cool history about the building that we can’t help but share here as well. In the 80’s, it was a trendy, “New York-style” nightclub for the elite known as Vertigo where entry was often based upon appearance — that’s LA for you — even if you had your name on the guest list. That was all before Prince bought the place in the early 90’s and turned into his own purple-shaded Grand Slam palace complete with carpeted walls, naked bodies on columns and a dance floor featuring an embedding of his ankh-styled “Love Symbol.” But after less than three years, it would change hands again and mostly be used for private events. At one point later it was called the Tatou Supper Club and then 333 Live/The Gold Room at 333 Live prior to becoming a home for the queer disco party series A Club Called Rhonda, yet nothing at 333 South Boylston St. has survived for very long, let alone has as much promise as The Bellwether does.\n\nMuch like The Regent Theater (read our venue review here) only over a mile away and Lodge Room in Highland Park, there’s a restaurant component to The Bellwether named The Virginian that serves small bites, pizza by the slice, specialty cocktails and other nourishment one hour before doors open. It might not have a menu that’s as gourmet as Checker Hall‘s — there’s no whipped feta with burnt honey butter and Urfa chili — but the options are a step up from what you would find at an AEG or Live Nation venue. After all, who doesn’t want a $19 poke bowl before a full helping of live music?\n\nAt a capacity of 1,600, the multifaceted destination fits nicely into LA’s music venue ecosystem. Many of the popular spots for artists and bands to perform are either well under and over that number, with next-door DTLA neighbors The Belasco (1,500) and The Mayan (1,700) two of the closest in size. The main room gets its character from the dance floor’s parquet pattern and an expansive mezzanine, accessible via staircases on either side, that provides excellent sightlines of the stage. Once the show begins, bars on the first floor and balcony of the ballroom make it so that you don’t have to walk very far to get a drink and miss any of the action. Swier’s brother Brian was tasked with overseeing the design and interior of The Bellwether, and after an initial encounter recently, we can’t say we aren’t impressed by his aesthetic and execution.\n\nOur introduction to the new kid on the block came on a Saturday night more than four months after its grand opening as alt-prog-sludge four-piece Baroness stopped through on their “Sweet Oblivion Tour” with a bevy of support — Primitive Man, Midwife and Agriculture — following last year’s bone-rattling performance on a wild Oscars night. This time, though, things were a little different for the Savannah-based outfit comprised of John Baizley (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, percussion), Nick Jost (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), Sebastian Thomson (drums) and last but not least, Gina Gleason (lead guitar, backing vocals), after the release of its sixth studio album Stone in September. Compared to what we witnessed at The Echo, there’s no doubt that The Bellwether was the better (and naturally, bigger) setting for the Grammy-nominated rockers who treated us to the tour debut of “Take My Bones Away” toward the end of the evening.\n\nThat’s a testament to what Swier, Perloff and their entire crew have accomplished so far at a time when economic trends have been more unpredictable than ever coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. What is most inspiring is their continued belief in what they are doing, especially when everything shut down in 2020, never wavering in their commitment and pouring in millions of dollars without one outside investor. And now, it’s finally paying off for them.\n\nNot only that, but for anyone who thought the City of Angels didn’t need or couldn’t support another new music venue, The Bellwether is quickly proving otherwise and delivering a simple but important reminder to us all at the same time: Don’t underestimate the power of live music.\n\nBARONESS – OCTOBER 28TH, 2023\n\nSetlist:\n\nLast Word\n\nA Horse Called Golgotha\n\nMarch to the Sea\n\nBeneath the Rose\n\nUnder the Wheel\n\nWar, Wisdom and Rhyme\n\nAnodyne\n\nChlorine & Wine\n\nTourniquet\n\nShock Me\n\nThe Gnashing\n\nIsak\n\nEncore:\n\nTake My Bones Away (tour debut)\n\nThe Sweetest Curse\n\nLet’s be frank: 2017 had its ups and downs. And when it came to the political sector in this country, it was mostly the latter during Year 1 of the Trump administration. But as art often does in times of turmoil, music flourished in new and exciting ways. From stripper-turned-rapper Cardi B topping the charts to veteran alt-psych rockers Portugal. The Man filling the airwaves for Top 40 radio stations all over America, there were plenty of unexpected twists and turns this year. Amid all of them, we still managed to consume a healthy diet of music, both live and recorded, and once again it’s time for us to ante up our annual “Best of” lists, much like we have done each of the past few years (see our 2016 picks here).\n\nSo, without further ado, Showbams presents The Bam Team’s five favorite shows, albums and songs from 2017.\n\nSee our favorite performances from 2017 here.\n\nListen to The Bam Team’s favorite songs of 2017:\n\nJosh Herwitt // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2017\n\n1. Tool at The Gorge Amphitheatre – George, WA – June 17th\n\nWhat could be a better bachelor party than getting to watch your favorite band at the most scenic outdoor music venue in the U.S.? Seeing any concert at The Gorge would likely be a surreal experience, but my first trip to Washington’s holy grail was that much more special with Tool returning to the amphitheater for the first time since 2006. And even though their gap between albums has stretched to more than 10 years, Maynard and company still know how to elevate the live show to new heights both sonically and visually. Talk about a dream come true for this die-hard fan.\n\n2. Nine Inch Nails at FYF Fest – Los Angeles, CA – July 23rd\n\n3.

Radiohead at Coachella, Weekend 1 – Indio, CA – April 14th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2017\n\n1. The War on Drugs – A Deeper Understanding\n\nAdam Granduciel had to know that it would take a monumental effort to match, let alone top, 2014’s Lost in the Dream (one of our favorite albums that year), but The War on Drugs’ primary songwriter and band leader delivered another masterpiece in late August with the release of A Deeper Understanding. It’s an album that will touch your heart and soothe your soul as the LP moves seamlessly from one track to the next, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a much better soundtrack for the road over the last 10-15 years. A Deeper Understanding doesn’t need to win a Grammy in 2018 to validate its legitimacy as an Album of the Year candidate, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt either.\n\n2. Slowdive – Slowdive\n\n3. The xx – I See You\n\n4. The National – Sleep Well Beast\n\n5. Grizzly Bear – Painted Ruins\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2017\n\n1. The War on Drugs – “Holding On”\n\nThere’s something about Adam Granduciel’s guitar playing that will make you want to play air guitar, and maybe no better example of that is the second single from The War on Drugs’ fourth studio album A Deeper Understanding. For nearly six minutes, Granduciel takes his listeners on a ride through peaks and valleys, as the song finishes with him doing what he does best: shredding. But what makes “Holding On” even more powerful is its music video starring actor Frankie Faison, who plays a middle-aged man coping with his wife’s passing. It’s a sad, yet touching story written by Granduciel’s girlfriend, Krysten Ritter, that offers an important reminder about love and just how precious it is.\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar – “DNA.”\n\n3. Washed Out – “Hard to Say Goodbye”\n\n4. The National – “The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness”\n\n5. Nine Inch Nails – “Less Than”\n\nBrett Ruffenach // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2017\n\n1. Solange at FORM Arcosanti – Arcosanti, AZ – May 12th\n\nTaking the stage in the amphitheater of Arcosanti, a scenic artist compound that’s built into the canyons sitting north of Phoenix, Solange and her nine-piece crew brought her critically acclaimed LP A Seat at the Table to life right before our eyes. As an album entrenched in the modern experience of the black woman, Solange’s live production turned these themes into one visually stunning, intricately choreographed and sonically vibrant experience, coupled with a subtle balance of strength and vulnerability. Deep bass, soaring harmonies and tight rhythms made each song a joy to watch, including older hits like “T.O.N.Y.” After a year that was as emotionally taxing as 2017 was, it was a breath of fresh air to watch Solange present her own truth, her own experience with such bravado and mastery.\n\n2. Gorillaz at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival – San Francisco, CA – August 11th\n\n3. Sigur Rós at Greek Theatre – Berkeley, CA – April 8th\n\n4. Mitski at FORM Arcosanti – Arcosanti, AZ – May 13th\n\n5. Kevin Morby at Great American Music Hall – San Francisco, CA – September 23rd\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2017\n\n1. Father John Misty – Pure Comedy\n\nPure Comedy captures a different perspective in this politically drenched culture we’re in now — one that chooses to embrace the insanity of it all and laugh, as privileged and unhelpful as that might be. “She’s like, ‘Oh great, that’s just what we all need / Another white guy in 2017 / Who takes himself so goddamn seriously'” croons Josh Tillman. His lyrics in “Leaving LA” are just one of several scores of quotable lines that fill this nihilist-yet-comforting, saddening-yet-hilarious album. Being a privileged white man who lives in a liberal bubble, this album marks the definition of a guilty pleasure for me. Pleasure, because it is sharp, honest and bold. Guilt, because I am capable of even laughing in the first place.\n\n2. Broken Social Scene – Hug of Thunder\n\n3. Sylvan Esso – What Now\n\n4. Lorde – Melodrama\n\n5. Brockhampton – SATURATION II\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2017\n\n1. Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile – “Over Everything”\n\nIts jangly guitars and wonky rhythm, combined with the chemistry of Courtney Barnett’s and Kurt Vile’s singing and occasional harmonizations, make “Over Everything” my favorite song of 2017. It’s an instant earworm — the cadence of Barnett’s and Vile’s lyricism gives the duo a distinct identity but still allows them to come together at the right moments to make the song feel whole. And after watching them make their live debut at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass earlier this year, they continue to raise my spirits and remind me to wear earplugs.\n\n2. Real Estate – “Darling”\n\n3. Selena Gomez – “Bad Liar”\n\n4. Kendrick Lamar – “DNA.”\n\n5. Bonobo – “Bambro Koyo Ganda”\n\nRochelle Shipman // Los Angeles\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2017\n\n1. J.I.D at Day N Night Fest – Anaheim, CA – September 9th\n\nThe J. Cole-signed rapper proved to be much more than just another name from Atlanta with a nonstop, energetic set that established him as a young goat. Keep tabs on this one.\n\n2. Sonder at The Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever – Los Angeles, CA – April 19th\n\n3. Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals at FYF Fest – Los Angeles, CA – July 21st\n\n4.

Smino – blkswn\n\nThis album brings nothing but warm vibes and impressive wordplay from the fast-rising St. Louis emcee. Since it dropped in March, not a week goes by that I don’t bump this debut for me and all my neighbors.\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar – DAMN.\n\n3. Dirty Projectors – Dirty Projectors\n\n4. Phoebe Bridgers – Stranger in the Alps\n\n5. Tyler, the Creator – Flower Boy\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2017\n\n1. Smino – “Anita”\n\nThe dude rhymes “ice cream” with “chocolate” and gets away with it. Enough said.\n\n2. Cardi B – “Bodak Yellow”\n\n3. Dirty Projectors – “Up in Hudson”\n\n4. Vince Staples – “Love Can Be…”\n\n5. Phoebe Bridgers – “Funeral”\n\nAndrew Pohl // San Francisco\n\nTop 5 Shows of 2017\n\n1. Slowdive at Fox Theater Oakland – Oakland, CA – October 28th\n\nThis was my first time seeing Slowdive, and they completely took my breath away. It was one of those perfect shows in which the sound was on point, the band brought its A game and the visual elements complimented the music just right. They played cuts from their entire catalog, and by the end of the night, the audience was completely happy.\n\n2. Quicksand at Great American Music Hall – San Francisco, CA – September 8th\n\n3. LCD Soundsystem at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium – San Francisco, CA – November 15th\n\n4. Band Together Bay Area: Metallica, G-Eazy, Rancid, Dave Matthews, Dead & Company and Raphael Saadiq at AT&T Park – San Francisco, CA – November 9th\n\n5. Roger Waters at Oracle Arena – Oakland, CA – June 10th\n\nTop 5 Albums of 2017\n\n1. Slowdive – Slowdive\n\nA totally perfect album from start to finish. There have been a lot of bands that have emulated Slowdive’s dream-pop/shoegaze sound over the past few years, but this album, their first in 22 years, proves why the UK group is one of the genre’s true originals. Lush soundscapes, paired with gorgeous vocals, made for what was easily my most-listened-to album of the year.\n\n2. LCD Soundsystem – American Dream\n\n3. Quicksand – Interiors\n\n4. Versing – Nirvana\n\n5. Hobosexual – Monolith\n\nTop 5 Songs of 2017\n\n1. Quicksand – “Illuminant”\n\nI had been waiting so patiently for the new Quicksand album to drop, and when they released this single, it was one of those completely satisfying musical moments. From that opening riff to the breakdown, “Illuminant” showcases the post-hardcore band’s evolution since the early 90’s while remaining true to its roots. Interiors is a fantastic album front to back, but this song is the one that stands out the most.\n\n2. Slowdive – “Star Roving”\n\n3. Elbow – “Magnificent (She Says)”\n\n4. LCD Soundsystem – “Call the Police”\n\n5. Versing – “Body Chamber”"
