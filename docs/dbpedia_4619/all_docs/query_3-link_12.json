        "text": "Just wanted to request that I have not gained any benefit of this app, and I purchased it as it said if you are not satisfied then you will get the full refund on the subscription cost. Can I request that refund please. The content is not that impressive or unique rather easily available for free on YouTube at least most of the content if not all. Hence I don’t think I am gaining anything out of this purchase.\n\nThis is primarily a user-to-user support forum; other Apple users like you.\n\nThere is an Apple article with information about requesting refunds. Click on the following link: Request a refund for apps or content that you bought from Apple - Apple Support\n\nSlowdive was a negative experience for me. I was charged 2 times on the same day for two different plans. I emailed and requested a cancellation. They said they needed proof I paid. I sent screenshot of my PayPal. Then after days go by I get a response saying that they needed to see the paddle.com recept which I didn't have. I probably didn't get one. So they have tried to get automatic payments that I had my bank block. I emailed all this information to slowdive and still haven't heard back. Poor poor customer service and the app didn't work right for me. The software shouldn't charge for 2 different plans. They're messed up.\n\nthe same thing has happened to me and I’m currently trying to get the $47.99 refunded after about 15 emails and providing every item of evidence and proof required I have just been told that as a goodwill gesture they will refund 50% and allow me to use the subscription I hadn’t asked for!! I have responded by telling them that I want a full refund or I will report this as Fraudulent transaction. I don’t know how else I would get my\n\nmoney back\n\nI assume you are dealing with SlowDrive directly as the subscription is managed by them and they are the only ones that can issue a refund in this case. You may have seen a link on a Social Media site or Web Page for this offer and directed you to their site. Whenever you sign up on any website, it removes Apple from being able to manage the subscription or issue refunds. They have an app as well, but Apple only manages subscriptions that are made with an in-app purchase. See this article provided by SlowDrive about cancelling the subscription to avoid being charged again.\n\nhttps://support.slowdive.app/en/articles/9167283-how-to-cancel-slowdive-app-subscription"
