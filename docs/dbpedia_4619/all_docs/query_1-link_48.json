        "text": "Slowdive\n\nShoegaze titans Slowdive today announced they’ll release their fifth album, Everything Is Alive, this September and it’s preceded by the dreamy first single “Kisses” — which you can hear below — and will be supported by a just-announced North American tour this fall.\n\nThe Dead Oceans label will release the nine-song album on Sept. 1 — it’s the band’s second post-reunion record — and it can be preordered now in a variety of vinyl, CD and cassette formats, as well as digitally.\n\nThe band’s 15-date North American tour — which follows summer dates in the U.K. Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan — opens Sept. 23 in Toronto and continues through a Los Angeles date on Oct. 14, and it will be followed by six dates in the U.K. and Ireland in late October and early November.\n\nSee the full tour dates below. Tickets for the newly announced shows go on sale at 10 a.m. local time Friday, June 23. More details at slowdiveofficial.com.\n\nThe new album is described by the label as featuring “the duality of a familiar internal language mixed with the exaltation of new beginnings. Everything is Alive is transportive, searching and aglow, the work of a classic band continuing to pitch its unmistakable voice to the future.”\n\nThe band — vocalists and guitarists Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead, guitarist Christian Savill, bassist Nick Chaplin and drummer Simon Scott — started work on what was envisioned as a “more minimal electronic record,” the label says, but eventually gravitated back toward its “signature reverb-drenched guitars, but that first concept seeped into the compositions.”\n\nSpeaking of that process, Halstead says: “As a band, when we’re all happy with it, that tends to be the stronger material. We’ve always come from slightly different directions, and the best bits are where we all meet in the middle.” Goswell adds: “Slowdive is very much the sum of its parts. Something unquantifiable happens when the five of us come together in a room.”\n\nBelow, check out the new single “Kisses,” the album’s full tracklist and artwork — and Slowdive’s tour dates.\n\nSlowdive, Everything is Alive\n\n1. “Shanty”\n\n2. “Prayer Remembered”\n\n3. “Alife”\n\n4. “Andalucia Plays”\n\n5. “Kisses”\n\n6. “Skin in the Game”\n\n7. “Chained to a Cloud”\n\n8. “The Slab”\n\nSlowdive tour dates 2023\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nJune 24: Exeter, UK — Phoenix\n\nJune 25: Glastonbury Festival, UK\n\nAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND JAPAN\n\nJuly 17: Perth, Australia — Astor Theatre\n\nJuly 19: Brisbane, Australia — Princess Theatre\n\nJuly 21: Sydney, Australia — Enmore Theatre\n\nJuly 22: Melbourne, Australia — Forum\n\nJuly 23: Adelaide, Australia – Hindley St Music Hall\n\nJuly 26: Auckland, NZ — Powerstation\n\nJuly 29: Fuji Rock Festival, Japan\n\nEUROPE\n\nAug. 5: Off Festival, Poland\n\nAug. 11: Ypsigrock Festival, Sicily\n\nAug. 18: Green Man Festival, Wales\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\nSept. 23: Toronto, ON — Queen Elizabeth Theatre\n\nSept. 25: Boston, MA –- Citizens House of Blues Boston\n\nSept. 27: New York City, NY — Webster Hall\n\nSept. 28: New York City, NY — Webster Hall\n\nSept. 29: Philadelphia, PA — Union Transfer\n\nSept. 30: Washington, D.C. — 930 Club\n\nOct. 2: Cleveland, OH — The Roxy @ Mahall’s\n\nOct. 3: Chicago, IL — Riviera Theatre\n\nOct. 4: St. Paul, MN — Palace Theatre\n\nOct. 6: Denver, CO –- Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nOct. 7: Salt Lake City, UT -– The Union\n\nOct. 9: Portland, OR — Crystal Ballroom\n\nOct. 10: Seattle, WA — Showbox SoDo\n\nOct. 12: San Francisco, CA –- The Warfield\n\nOct. 14: Los Angeles, CA –- The Bellwether\n\nUK AND IRELAND\n\nOct. 30: Glasgow, UK — QMU\n\nOct. 31: Manchester, UK — 02 Ritz\n\nNov. 1: Bristol, UK — SWX\n\nNov. 3: London, UK –- The Troxy\n\nNov. 5: Belfast, UK -– Mandela Hall\n\nNov. 6: Dublin, Ireland – National Stadium\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON SLICING UP EYEBALLS\n\nListen: Ride, ‘Home is a Feeling’ — shoegaze legends debut 2nd new track this week\n\nListen: Ride, ‘Charm Assault’ — shoegaze legends’ first new music in 20 years\n\nRudy Tambala teases some sort of A.R.
