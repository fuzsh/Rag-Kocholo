        "text": "The shoegazers offer hope with their fifth album.\n\nSlowdive return with everything is alive, their first album in six years, due for release on September 1 via Dead Oceans.\n\nThe album follows on from 2017’s self-titled Slowdive, and is dedicated to vocalist Rachel Goswell’s mother and drummer Simon Scott’s father who both died in 2020.\n\nListen to first cut, “kisses”, below.\n\neverything is alive started life as a “more minimal electronic record” with co-vocalist and guitarist Neil Halstead producing demos alone at home but became more in tune with the group’s previous releases once the group came together to work on the record.\n\n“As a band, when we’re all happy with it, that tends to be the stronger material,” Halstead says. “We’ve always come from slightly different directions, and the best bits are where we all meet in the middle.”\n\n“Slowdive is very much the sum of its parts. Something unquantifiable happens when the five of us come together in a room,” adds Goswell. “It wouldn’t feel right to make a really dark record right now. The album is quite eclectic emotionally, but it does feel hopeful.”\n\neverything is alive is available to pre-order on opaque gold and standard black vinyl now ahead of its September 1 release.\n\nTracklisting:"
