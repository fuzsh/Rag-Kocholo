        "text": "Slowdive have shared details of their first album in six years, everything is alive.\n\nSpanning eight tracks, the new record is dedicated to vocalist and guitarist Rachel Goswell’s mother and drummer Simon Scott’s father, who both died in 2020. Recording started in 2020 and took place across Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire and Cornwall, with the record following on from 2017’s Slowdive, which marked the band’s first album in 22 years. To mark the announcement of everything is alive, Slowdive have shared a video for lead cut ‘kisses’, which you can watch above.\n\nSpeaking about the record in a statement, the band’s vocalist and guitarist Neil Halstead said: \"It wouldn’t feel right to make a really dark record right now. The album is quite eclectic emotionally, but it does feel hopeful.\""
