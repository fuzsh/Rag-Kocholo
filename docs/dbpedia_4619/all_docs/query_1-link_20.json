        "text": "Slowdive are touring. See all the 2024 dates\n\nThe Slowdive Database was created to give a complete overview of all the concerts Slowdive ever played, the songs they've played during these concerts, reviews related to it as well as memorabilia (e.g. ticket and advert scans). To write the gigography it was used as base (specially for the shows before the 2014 reunion):\n\nPeople's tradelists\n\nShows shared on Dimeadozen.org (specially those from user sundchen, who shared lot of recordings\n\nGigographies from other bands such as Ride, Pale Saints or Lush (bands that toured with Slowdive)\n\nOther information was retrieved from sites such as the Slowdive & Mojave 3 Digest Archive and the, unfortunately, now defunct sites The Souvlaki Space Station 'A Slowdive Digital Museum' which contained invaluable information on the Souvlaki Tour and the Slowdive - A New Dream site that contained information about the band from 1991 and 1992.\n\nIf you attended a show, specially during the 90's, your ticket or advert scan is most welcome! Please send it to dsanchez@pucp.edu.pe or to @SlowdiveDB (if you are on Twitter). Every contribution to the site will be credited. Thank you for visiting the site.\n\nDavid."
