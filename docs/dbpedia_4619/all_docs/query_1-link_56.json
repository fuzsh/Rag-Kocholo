        "text": "Following their successful fall 2023 tour supporting their long-awaited fifth studio album, “Everything Is Alive,” British shoegaze heroes Slowdive are poised to continue captivating their devoted fanbase with a new set of tour dates in 2024. The album, released on September 1, 2023, has been a commercial triumph and critical darling, securing top ten spots in several European countries, including Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Notable singles from the album, such as “Kisses,” “Skin in the Game,” “The Slab,” and “Alife,” have further cemented Slowdive’s reputation for creating deeply textured and emotionally engaging music.\n\nThe spring 2024 tour will see Slowdive returning to the US, building on the momentum of their fall 2023 tour. This time, they’re set to headline the Sick New World festival and perform in several cities missed in their previous run. Anticipation is high for shows in Texas (Austin, Houston, Dallas), the Southwest (Phoenix, Albuquerque), New Orleans, Kansas City, Atlanta, and the unique subterranean venue, The Caverns, in Tennessee.\n\nEnhancing the tour’s allure is the inclusion of Drab Majesty as the opening act. Known for their distinct post-punk and goth-infused sound, Drab Majesty gained recent acclaim with their EP “An Object in Motion.” The EP’s lead single, “Vanity,” featuring Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell, has been particularly well-received, offering a rare blend of Goswell’s ethereal vocals with Drab Majesty’s darker tones.\n\nSlowdive Tour Dates:\n\nSouth America:\n\nDec. 7 – Asunción, PY @ Primavera Sound\n\nEU:\n\nJan. 16 – Amsterdam, NL @ Paradiso\n\nJan. 17 – Paris, FR @ La Cigale\n\nJan. 18 – Cologne, DE @ Live Music Hall\n\nJan. 20 – Hamburg, DE @ Grosse Freiheit 36\n\nJan. 21 – Copenhagen, DK @ VEGA\n\nJan. 22 – Oslo, NO @ Sentrum Scene\n\nJan. 23 – Stockholm, SE @ Munchenbryggeriet\n\nJan. 24 – Copenhagen, DK @ VEGA\n\nJan. 25 – Berlin, DE @ Columbiahalle\n\nJan. 27 – Warsaw, PL @ Progresja\n\nJan. 28 – Prague, CZ @ Divaldo Archa\n\nJan. 29 – Munich, DE @ Muffathalle\n\nJan. 30 – Zurich, CH @ Volkshaus\n\nJan. 31 – Milan, IT @ Alcatraz Club\n\nFeb. 2 – Bologna, IT @ Estragon Club\n\nFeb. 4 – Lyon, FR @ La Transbordeur\n\nFeb. 5 – Barcelona, ES @ Razzmatazz\n\nFeb. 6 – Madrid, ES @ La Riviera\n\nFeb. 8 – Brussels, BE @ Cirque Royale\n\nUK:\n\nFeb. 16 – Brighton @ Brighton Dome\n\nFeb. 17 – London @ Eventim Apollo\n\nFeb. 18 – Birmingham @ O2 Institute Birmingham\n\nFeb. 19 – Norwich @ LCR UEA\n\nFeb. 21 – Liverpool @ O2 Academy Liverpool\n\nFeb. 22 – Newcastle-Upon-Tyne @ NX\n\nFeb. 23 – Glasgow @ Barrowland Ballroom\n\nFeb. 24 – Edinburgh @ Liquid Room\n\nFeb. 26 – Cardiff @ Cardiff University Great Hall\n\nFeb. 27 – Manchester @ Manchester Academy\n\nNorth America:\n\nApr. 25 – Ventura, CA @ The Majestic Ventura Theater\n\nApr. 26 – Pomona, CA @ The Fox Theater Pomona\n\nApr. 27 – Las Vegas, NV @ Sick New World Festival\n\nApr. 28 – Phoenix, AZ @ The Van Buren\n\nApr. 30 – Albuquerque, NM @ The Historic El Rey Theater\n\nMay 1 – Denver, CO @ Levitt Pavilion Denver\n\nMay 3 – Kansas City, MO @ The Truman\n\nMay 4 – St. Louis, MO @ The Pageant\n\nMay 5 – Indianapolis, IN @ Egyptian Room at Old National Centre\n\nMay 7 – Louisville, KY @ Old Forester’s Paristown Hall\n\nMay 8 – Pelham, TN @ The Caverns\n\nMay 10 – Dallas, TX @ Longhorn Ballroom\n\nMay 11 – Houston, TX @ White Oak Music Hall\n\nMay 12 – Austin, TX @ ACL Live at The Moody Theater\n\nMay 14 – New Orleans, LA @ The Civic Theatre\n\nMay 16 – Birmingham, AL @ Avondale Brewing Company\n\nMay 17 – Atlanta, GA @ The Eastern\n\nMay 18 – Asheville, NC @ Rabbit Rabbit\n\nFollow Slowdive:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite\n\nFollow Drab Majesty:"
