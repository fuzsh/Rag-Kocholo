        "text": "The Philosophy of G. E. Moore\n\nG. E. Moore; Paul Arthur Schilpp (Editor)\n\nhardback with dustjacket. 2nd impression. For almost a half-century G.E. Moore has exercised an enormous influence on modern thought. Since 1903, when his famous Refutation of Idealism burst upon the philosophical world, he has had a long and distinguished career. The present volume is a living testament to this great realist and to his reputation (along with his colleagues, Russell and Whitehead) as one of the most profound thinkers of our century. Here every aspect of Professor Moore's thought is described and examined--in nineteen brilliant, searching and incisive essays which form a definitive critique of his work and from which all further evaluations must spring. Each contributor and critic has been chosen because of his thorough familiarity and deep interest in the subject--and each is a noted American or European philosopher in his own right.
