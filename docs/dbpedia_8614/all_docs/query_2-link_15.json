        "text": "Hannah Arendt’s immigration to the United States in the early 1940s reminds me of a comment made by a professor of a post-WW2 American history course that I took as an undergraduate. “If it weren’t for Hitler, America would not have a philosophical tradition.” What he probably meant was that the high number of philosophers who fled Nazi Germany for the far more hospitable shores of America had a profound and enduring impact on American intellectual life well into the Cold War era. Even though my professor overstated the absence of a philosophical tradition in America before the 1930s, there is no question that German émigrés such as Hannah Arendt, Eric Voegelin, and Leo Strauss reinvigorated the study of political philosophy—the study of what constitutes the best or most just political regime.\n\nArendt was born in Hanover in 1906, but she lived many of her formative years in Königsberg and Berlin. She was raised in a secular Jewish home, which had fully assimilated the liberal values of the Enlightenment. Unfortunately, these values did not have much staying power in her native Germany. In 1933, she fled the rising menace of Nazism and eventually made her way to the United States, where she taught at distinguished institutions such as the New School for Social Research and the University of Chicago. She died in New York City in 1975.\n\nIt is hard to classify Arendt’s thought, given the fact that she was a political philosopher, an historian of ideas, and a public intellectual, writing on a wide range of topics such as totalitarianism, anti-semitism, Augustinian theology, Heidegger (her former professor), the American and French revolutions, and the meaning of authority (as opposed to violence). If there is one theme that unites the vast corpus of works that Arendt composed, it is her interest in the use and abuse of language in politics and the corresponding evasion of responsibility for one’s actions. More than most of her philosophical brethren, Arendt was acutely aware of the paradox of language, which can both reveal and conceal the truth, especially in the political realm. Totalitarian regimes were the worst offenders here. Not only did they eliminate privacy and freedom; they eradicated truth as well. “For history itself is destroyed, and its comprehensibility—based upon the fact that it is enacted by men—is in danger, whenever facts are no longer held to be part and parcel of the past and present world, and are misused to prove this or that opinion.” (The Origins of Totalitarianism, 9) However, even within a democracy, both the Left and the Right can misuse language (re-invent and distort the meaning of words).\n\nNo doubt, her background as a German Jew helps to explain this interest in the misuse (or just plain reinvention) of language. The Jews of Europe have always been sensitive to the nuance of language, or the layers of meaning that language can reveal and conceal. Even during the Enlightenment, a time at which European Jews were given full political rights and freedoms, for the first time in history, Jews had to be sensitive to the meaning of words. Yet the terms “Enlightenment” and “freedom” could be understood in different ways. Until the rise of Nazism in Germany, German Jews had generally embraced the Enlightenment, that great secular movement that advanced intellectual and religious freedom, as an indestructible tradition that guaranteed the rights of Jews. All that the Enlightenment asked of Jews was to privatize their faith (or remove it from the political realm) and to assimilate the values of liberalism.\n\nThe rise of Hitler to power dramatically and fatefully demonstrated to German Jews that the Enlightenment tradition was very destructible, that in fact even an enlightened European civilization could go to the bad. Arendt shared the same misgivings as her fellow German Jews Leo Strauss and Theodor Adorno on the limits of the Enlightenment. They were haunted by the same question: had the Enlightenment not only failed to protect the Jews but even contributed to the rise of Hitler in Germany? Because the Enlightenment had extended freedom to both Jews and anti-Semites under the banner of freedom of speech, had this well-meaning tradition given freedom to those who sought to destroy the Enlightenment and European Jewry altogether? Worst of all, those anti-Semites on the far Right who hated the Enlightenment blamed the Jews for inflicting a decadent and libertine philosophy onto real Germans, a philosophy that was also blamed for the political and economic collapse of Germany after WW1. In short, the Enlightenment had not eliminated anti-Semitism at all. As Arendt wrote in The Origins of Totalitarianism, “In contrast to all other groups, the Jews were defined and their position determined by the body politic. Since, however, the body politic had no social reality, they were socially speaking in the void.” Jews were both everywhere and nowhere, anathema to a society that never quite accepted the Enlightenment.\n\nEven in her American exile, living and working comfortably in a nation that was wedded to the tradition of freedom of speech and other Enlightenment values, Arendt was keenly aware of the misuse of language within a democracy. It was not only totalitarian regimes that were capable of reinventing “freedom” and “equality” and turning them into their nightmarish opposites. What she famously called the “banality of evil,” the all too human temptation of ordinary persons to rationalize evil, extended to both democratic and tyrannical regimes. Evil was not some aberrant practice that exotic personalities practiced. Evil was banal because it was committed by respectable nameless bureaucrats wearing suits and ties. In her essay “Lying in Politics,” which she penned during the Vietnam War amid the explosive revelations that came out of the Pentagon Papers, Arendt took aim at the US government for systematically lying about the Vietnam War and even went so far as to claim that the “willful, deliberate disregard of all facts, historical, political, geographical” of the Vietnam War’s architects was eerily similar to tactics and assumptions made by the communist enemy. Arendt agreed with the New Left critique of the war that the US government had ignored the basic facts of Vietnamese history in order to claim falsely that Vietnam was a mere pawn of world communism. The fact that a majority of the people, the masses, had gone along with these lies only vindicated Arendt’s Platonic suspicion of democracy as a whole.\n\nArendt’s sensitivity to the misuse of language, along with indifference to basic facts and truths, perhaps explains why she was often leery of the usage of religious language in politics. In her view, the language of the Bible was so loaded with meaning that it was extremely vulnerable to abuse in the hands of political authorities. This reticence may explain why she insisted, for example, in On Revolution, that Christianity, properly understood, is essentially apolitical, and has no true pretensions to wield power in the secular world. Christianity allowed for freedom from politics. (For this reason, she turned to ancient Greek political philosophy, perhaps with the encouragement of Heidegger, as the one tradition that is properly suited for the political life.) No doubt, the demonic misuse of Christian language during the Nazi era, which helped to rationalize the persecution of the Jews, explains these doubts about applying Christianity to the world of politics. She notes in Eichmann in Jerusalem how the architect of the Final Solution had dared to say at his trial in Jerusalem in 1961 that he was simply following the golden rule, or Kant’s categorical imperative, when he exterminated six million Jews in the name of love and duty! Her attitude towards Christianity was not, however, one of hostility. In fact, in On Revolution Arendt wrote that the “terrifying question of good and evil could not even be posed, at least not in the framework of Western traditions, without taking into account the only completely valid, completely convincing experience Western mankind had ever had with active love of goodness as the inspiring principle of all actions, that is, without consideration of the person of Jesus of Nazareth.” In short, Arendt was praising the love incarnated in the person of Christ as the only complete and authentic pathway to understanding good and evil in the modern era.\n\nYet this love allegedly has little applicability in the realm of politics.\n\n“A few words need still to be said about the not infrequent claim that all modern revolutions are essentially Christian in origin, and this even when their professed faith is atheism. The argument supporting this claim usually points to the clearly rebellious nature of the early Christian sect with its stress on the equality of souls before God, its open contempt for all public powers, and its promise of a Kingdom of Heaven—notions and hopes which are supposed to have been channeled into modern revolutions, albeit in secularized fashion, through the Reformation…But if this is true, then it is secularization itself, and not the contents of Christian teachings, which constitutes the origin of revolution.” (Arendt, On Revolution, 16)\n\nThroughout her writings, Arendt insists that Christians are too focused on the Second Coming to be preoccupied with the earthly travails of the political, as if waiting for the apocalypse has had no political ramifications. In her study of revolutions, Arendt is determined to excise revealed religion from American political history in favor of paganism.\n\nArendt credits Christianity for making possible what paganism never did—a “freedom from politics.” (On Revolution, 280) For this reason, she insists that Christianity has nothing to do with the American founding. The American founders were more likely influenced by the pagan narrative of Virgil’s Aeneid, which recounted the creation of a new nation after the destruction of an old one. (On Revolution, 204-05) The Romans, who eschewed even the slightest separation of politics and religion, nevertheless are the models of American republicanism. Somehow, the old Roman trinity of religion, tradition, and authority made its way into the consciousness of the founders, although Arendt offers not a shred of evidence for this claim. (On Revolution, 117, 197, 206) Still, this thesis allows Arendt to deny the originality of the American revolution. For if the Romans are so paramount as an influence, then the events of 1776 must be intelligible only as a restoration of the old Roman wisdom, and nothing new in the bargain. (On Revolution, 44, 180-81). On the American revolutionaries, she wrote:\n\n“Their sound realism was never put to the test of compassion, their common sense was never exposed to the absurd hope that man, whom Christianity had held to be sinful and corrupt in his nature, might still be revealed to be an angel.” (On Revolution, 95)\n\nIn short, Arendt often insists that Christianity either has no influence or its politicization (secularization) in America hopelessly adulterates its content. Even in the case of the Puritans at Plymouth Rock, their devotion to politics was more secular than religious: “even the Puritans were no longer mere pilgrims on earth but ‘Pilgrim Fathers’—founders of colonies with their stakes and claims not in the hereafter but in this world of mortal men.” (On Revolution, 230)\n\nWhat is fascinating and paradoxical about Arendt are her often dramatic admissions that the Bible is the true foundation of politics, history, and freedom.[1] Arendt did not always consistently adhere to her own view that religion should be completely kept out of the political realm. In recognizing the American revolution as a new beginning in history, Arendt finds it impossible to locate the idea of beginning again (or being born again) in classical Rome. For the pagan belief in cyclical time—upon which the Aeneid and every other great work of classical literature builds—has no way of explaining the events of 1776. Indeed, cyclical time has no way of explaining history, as she admits:\n\n“Antiquity was well acquainted with political change and the violence that went with change, but neither of them appeared to it to bring about something altogether new.” (On Revolution, 21)\n\nCyclical time is focused on repetition, not the novelty of historic change. Whereas the Aeneid is premised on the eternal regeneration of kingdoms which rise and fall (On Revolution, 210-11), the revolution offered the hope of “arresting the cycle of sempiternal change, the rise and fall of empires, and establish an immortal city.” (On Revolution, 231). Ultimately, her thesis of indebtedness to Rome collapses when she admits that tradition (at least in the classical sense) offered no precedent to the men of 1776:\n\n“Hence, it seems, the men of the American Revolution, whose awareness of the absolute novelty in their enterprise amounted to an obsession, were inescapably caught in something for which neither the historical nor the legendary truth of their own tradition could offer any help or precedent.” (On Revolution, 212)\n\nWhat, then, explained the possibility or actuality of a new beginning? Arendt ultimately had to conclude that the Christian notion of natality was the foundation of new beginnings in history. Arendt deeply appreciated how the New Testament contained “an extraordinary understanding of freedom, and particularly the power inherent in human freedom.” She went on to write: “the human capacity which corresponds to this power, which, in the words of the Gospel, is capable of removing mountains, is not will but faith.” The real “miracle” is freedom inspired by faith. “The work of faith…is what the gospels called ‘miracles,’ a word with many meanings in the New Testament and difficult to understand.” Miracles are not supernatural events. Rather, they are “interruptions [new beginnings]” which disrupt the “natural series of events, of some automatic process, in whose context they constitute the wholly unexpected.” (Between Past and Future, 167-168)\n\nWhy was this understanding of history as the miracle of freedom, of beginning again, so important to not only grasp but put into practice? In The Human Condition, she writes that Jesus of Nazareth was the “discoverer of the role of forgiveness in the realm of human affairs.” (214-15) The fact that she calls Jesus the “discoverer” is telling, which strongly implies that forgiveness is a new beginning in history. The power of forgiveness is akin “to the more general power of performing miracles.” (Human Condition, 222) Forgiveness is neither natural nor inevitable to the human condition. It is a miracle, a new beginning, to the otherwise tortured, inauthentic, and sinful relations in which human beings entangle themselves.\n\n“The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, ‘natural’ ruin is ultimately the fact of natality, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. It is, in other words, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by virtue of being born. Only the full experience of this capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope, those two essential characteristics of human existence which Greek antiquity ignored altogether, discounting the keeping of faith as a very uncommon and not too important virtue and counting hope among the evils of illusion in Pandora’s box. It is this faith in and hope for the world that found perhaps its most glorious and most succinct expression in the few words with which the Gospels announced their ‘glad tidings’: ‘A child has been born unto us.’” (Human Condition, 222-23)\n\nHow does this narrative of love explain history, including the history of the church, which has so often been influenced by Greek antiquity? After all, the church has not always acted in the spirit of love. More often, the motivation has been one of fear or tyranny encouraged by the belief in hellfire. Was this truly biblical? In her essay “What is Authority?”, Arendt attributed the origins of this belief in hell to Plato, not to Christ, a belief that served political authority at the expense of the true Christian focus on love. ‘Nothing perhaps in the whole development of Christianity throughout the centuries is farther removed from and more alien to the letter and spirit of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth than the elaborate catalogue of future punishments and the enormous power of coercion through fear which only in the last stages of the modern age have lost their public, political significance.” Was Arendt then welcoming the demise of the belief in hell as it applies to the political realm?\n\nOnce again, her experience with totalitarianism and the death of the Enlightenment led her to make a cautious qualification here: “the fact is that the most significant consequence of the secularization of the modern age may well be the elimination from public life, along with religion, of the only political element in traditional religion, the fear of hell. We who had to witness how, during the Hitler and Stalin era, an entirely new and unprecedented criminality, almost unchallenged in the respective countries, was to invade the realm of politics should be the last to underestimate its persuasive influence upon the functioning of conscience.” (Between Past and Future, 132-33) (Arendt went on to note that even the heirs of the Enlightenment, including the French and American revolutionaries of the 18th century, made belief in an “avenging God” part and parcel of the new body politic.) Arendt was too aware of the banality of evil, or the fallenness of all human beings, to dismiss a teaching that in some respects had restrained the worst inclinations of human nature.\n\nIn closing, Arendt was that rare secular philosopher who actually appreciated the truth of revelation, without being religiously observant. Her keen interest in the misuse of language reveals a certain debt to the theological tradition. More importantly, her unforgiving view that all human beings are capable of evil, whether in a position of religious or secular authority, and can misuse language for their own self-serving ends, is a truth that all regimes, including democratic ones, dare not forget.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] See Christopher Irwin, “Reading Hannah Arendt as a Biblical Thinker,” Sophia 54 (2015): 545-61.\n\nThe author presented this paper for the panel “What Philosophy Owes to Women,” hosted by the Gender Studies Institute (Trinity Western University) on International Women’s Day, March 8, 2017."
