        "text": "Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology, written in 1922, is present in almost every discussion on the place of the theological within the politics of our secularized societies. Despite Jürgen Habermas’ admonition that studying Schmitt is merely a gateway drug to the dream of a strong state, Schmittian thought continues to heavily influence contemporary discourses, on the left as much as on the right. Whether one agrees with Schmitt’s thesis or not, Political Theology became a paradigm through which some of the most urgent challenges of our age are approached. It is often through the Schmittian prism that contemporary thinkers account for populism and states of emergency, understand the present crisis of liberalism, and revisit the complex relations between modernity and religious traditions.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of Schmitt’s influential work is an opportunity to inquire into the genealogy of Political Theology, and trace its diverse and at times conflictual applications in answering these urgent questions. The starting point of our inquiry is Schmitt’s famous statement that “all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts”. This contested dictum—far from covering the range of meanings attributed to political theology even for Schmitt himself—became an impetus for heated debates between religious and secularists, both in Schmitt’s own time and in later phases of his reception. Is there indeed a theological remainder that can never be forced out of modern consciousness? Or, rather, the modern is a break from theology, a new path, which does not depend on theology for its legitimacy and sustenance? Is secular modernity a continuation of Christianity, perhaps even the Christian tradition’s best and ripest fruit, or rather, it is a heresy, a twisted digression from orthodox doctrine? And what room is left within the interplay of theology and politics in Western civilization to non-Christian traditions, to their theologies, and to their politics? Is every use of Schmitt’s paradigm doomed to end up as Schmitt himself, that is, as a Nazi, a totalitarian, an anti-Semite?\n\nThe conference will trace the entanglement of these debates from the time of the work’s publication in the Interwar period to present debates occurring in different cultural and political contexts. More specifically, it will explore Schmitt’s reception within Christian and Jewish circles, taking into account how political theology and the “secular” are perceived precisely from their respective theological perspectives. The attempt is not to embrace Schmitt, whose anti-Semitism and notorious involvement with the Nazi regime continue to shadow his thought, but rather to think political theology in its variety. We will trace the various religious uses of political theology, whether they serve to anchor the political sphere in concrete religious legitimacy, to criticize politics in the name of theology, or to denote a form of secular theology, positing the political at its doctrinal core. Moreover, we will explore the critical function of political theology not only in conflicts between religious traditions and secularism, but also in frictions between competing religious traditions.\n\nSchedule\n\nMonday, July 18, 2022\n\nThe Jewish Reception of Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology\n\n11:15 am Greetings: Karma Ben Johanan (Humboldt University of Berlin)\n\n11:30 am\n\nJulie Cooper (Tel Aviv University) The Jewish Philosopher Spinoza?
