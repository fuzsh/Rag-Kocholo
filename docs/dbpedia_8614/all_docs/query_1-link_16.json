        "text": "My first brief, but considered, answer to Jeremy’s question would be “There aren’t any.”\n\nHowever, as Raymond Williams reminded us in Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, theory is a word with a wide range of meanings. One is that of a “scheme of ideas which explain practice” and, as such, “theory” exists “in active relation to practice.” It has to do with “things done, things observed and (systematic) explanation of these.” If we play along with this definition, then by far the most “important or influential theoretical works for the field of PRC history” would appear to be those that have given us the lion’s share of the explicitly or implicitly explanatory concepts that all of us routinely deploy in our theorizing, writing and lecturing on the subject. Whether we are its friends or members or opponents really does not matter: the fact is that it is the Chinese Communist Party that has provided us with most of the seemingly indispensable awls, edgers, and tweezers that make up the theoretical toolkits we carry along when approaching PRC history in our professional capacities. What I have in mind here is everything from the standard underlying post-1949 (?) chronicle to the names of what we claim constituted PRC practice prior to the arrival of the present. When, after all, did you last read a history of China in the 1960s and 1970s that did not claim to be about “the Cultural Revolution”? When did you last see an analysis of the historical fate of China’s intelligentsia in the second half of the 20th century that did not seek to explain something by referring to “Rightists”?\n\nAn intentionally provocative alternative answer to Jeremy’s question could therefore also be the Selected Works of Mao Zedong!\n\nDear colleagues, It seems that we are missing an obvious group here. The work that gender historians have been doing for the past 25+ years has been both theoretically rigorous and invaluable to understanding modern China. You can take your pick of names, and I probably don't have to relay them.\n\nI can recommend Gail Hershatter's The Gender of Memory, which I actually taught in a theory & method class last fall. In the book, Gail engages in a complex and meticulous discussion of gender, how the state impacts memory, the ways that ideology shapes (or misshapes) identity, and a host of other relevant and important topics. But she also provides a frank and honest discussion about the challenges that she faced in the field. The book is brilliant because Gail pulls back the curtain to reveal where theory \"meets the road.\" This helped my students understand not just the intricacy of issues like gender, memory, and rural life in Maoist China, but also how to apply theory in practical ways. In my opinion, the book captured everything that it means to be a historian - higher-level theoretical thinking, frustrations in the field, finding creative solutions to basic problems. It seems like a natural candidate to be included on a graduate syllabus such as the one Jeremy described.\n\nZachary Scarlett\n\nButler University\n\nHi all,\n\nThanks for posting this interesting query, Jeremy! I admit that what first came to my mind was \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.\" And the second thing was Gail Hershatter's _Gender of Memory_. So, working along the lines that others have already taken....\n\nThen I thought of a couple of works that no one has mentioned yet: Vivienne Shue's _The Reach of the State_, which I found very enlightening (although she told me many years after it was published that it had not had as much impact as she had hoped). For a more recent work that critiques current political theory using the PRC case, how about Perry and Heilbrun, eds., _Mao's Invisible Hand_? Here is a link to Harvard UP's blog entry about it: http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2012/06/maos-invisible-ha… Fortunately, the field of China studies has a substantial number of political scientists who do good historical work (and they are far more likely, it seems, to engage explicitly with theoretical literatures than are historians, other than historians working on gender).\n\nIf your colleague had asked about late imperial and republican history, then G. William Skinner and his version of central place theory would be an easy answer. But I'm not sure that historians working post-1949 find it as stimulating and provoking.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nKristin\n\nThere are a number of texts, many by political scientists and sociologists writing before 1990, whose approaches to the Maoist period, while not always explicitly theoretical, inform how PRC history is conceptualized to this day.\n\nBelow are a few such books. This list is a start. It is by no means meant to be all-inclusive.\n\nthe PRC in modern Chinese history\n\nPaul Cohen, \"Reflections on a watershed date: the 1949 divide in Chinese history\"\n\nJoeseph Esherick, \"Ten theses on the Chinese Revolution\"\n\nPhilip Kuhn, The Origins of the Modern Chinese State\n\nR.

I just taught a graduate seminar on intellectual history and historiography (covering 20th century China), in which I tried to pair theoretical with empirical readings. I’m pasting in some of the topics I covered (extending back to Republican history, but often also relevant to PRC history).\n\nOccasionally I also assigned theoretical readings from outside the China field: EP Thompson’s “Moral Economy of the Crowd” to discuss popular protest, Browning on the Nazi state (polycentric power in a totalitarian setting), a chapter from Benedict Anderson’s imagined communities to discuss nationalism, James Scott’s concepts (“hidden transcripts”, “everyday resistance”), Skocpol (to explain “path dependency” and historical institutionalism). Students seem to have enjoyed it…\n\n- Chinese exceptionalism\n\nPaul Cohen, Discovering History in China\n\n- State building\n\nDuara, Culture, Power and the State\n\nKuhn, Esherick already quoted\n\nSkocpol, “Cultural Idioms and Political Ideologies”\n\n- Nationalism\n\nAnderson, Imagined Communities\n\nLevenson, Confucian China and its Modern Fate\n\n- Locality\n\nDuara, Rescuing History from the Nation\n\n- Popular protest\n\nEP Thompson “Moral Economy of the Crowd”\n\nJames Scott, \"Everyday forms of peasant resistance\" (also useful to pair with his review of Mubei)\n\nO’Brien, “Rightful Resistance”\n\n- Gender and Memory\n\nHershatter Gender of Memory; \"The Subaltern Talks Back: Reflections on Subaltern Theory and Chinese History\"\n\n- Authoritarian/Totalitarian politics\n\nChristopher Browning on Nazism, \"Beyond Intentionalism and Functionalism\"\n\n(also Ian Kershaw \"Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich”)\n\nHaraszti, Velvet Prison\n\n- Civil Society\n\nModern China special issue\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThanks a million for the excellent discussion and useful replies. I think that Ryan Dunch is right--my colleague is probably referring to a theoretical canon (possibly including Foucault, de Certeau, Lefebvre, Bordieu; probably not including Confucius, Mencius, and Mao). This canon is not especially influential in our field.\n\nWhat's become clear through everyone's replies is that there is not a single theoretical work that is \"most important and influential\" in the field of PRC history. I think that Michael Schoenhals is right that Mao Zedong's writing comes closest. Very few PRC historians are Maoists, but Mao certainly does establish the terminology that we all start with.\n\nI'm responsible for one week in a seminar in which other colleagues in American, Canadian, European, and Middle Eastern history will be doing the same thing: picking a theoretical work and pairing it with a book that uses the theory effectively. I'm still at a loss. Gail Hershatter's book is one of my favorites, but none of the theories she engages with are more broadly \"important and influential\" beyond her work (other PRC historians are not explicitly engaging with Timothy Mitchell, for example). I'm leaning toward pairing a couple of key Mao works (Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society, People's Democratic Dictatorship) with a newer book like Schoenhals's Spying for the People.\n\nThanks again for the stimulating discussion and wonderful book lists!\n\nJeremy\n\nI think Paul Cohen's History in Three Keys would be a good one to consider in terms of his theoretical discussion of \"mythologization of the past\" and oral history methods. For PRC history, chapter 9 \"The Cultural Revolution and the Boxers\" typically discusses about how the CCP myth-making historians utilized the Boxer uprising as a mean to achieve their revolutionary political agenda without seeking to understand and explaining the past. I think Cohen's discussion on the issue is very theoretical, and he explains it well using actual examples. It also offers lots of insight into how we ought to interpret collective memories and individual experiences. This book is also used for oral history methods teaching materials by non-China studies historians."
