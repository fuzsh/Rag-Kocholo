        "text": "BERLIN – It’s said that the best way to make a subversive book disappear is to render it canonical. That, in large measure, has been the fate of Hannah Arendt. In recent years, the Jewish philosopher who fled Nazi Germany and settled in the United States has become a culture heroine in her homeland and elsewhere. In addition to the scholarly literature about her that continues to pile up at a confusing pace, she has been the subject of several films, and a play has been written about her romantic relationship with the philosopher Martin Heidegger. This preoccupation with Arendt, who died in 1975 at age 69, gives rise to the suspicion that the more famous she becomes, the less she is read."
