        "text": "After escaping from the worst that humanity could offer, Hannah Arendt confronted evil head on.\n\nPlenty of philosophers do their best to detach themselves from all things 'worldly', in order to think on a supposedly higher plane.\n\nNot Hannah Arendt.\n\nBorn today in 1906, Arendt's experiences ran free across the fields of her political and philosophical thought — which spanned everything from revolution to the nature of evil.\n\nHannah Arendt: philosopher and fighter of injustice\n\nGrowing up Jewish in 20th century Germany\n\nRaised in a progressive Jewish family in Hanover, Germany, Arendt's parents were both socialists in the country’s fast-growing Social Democratic Party\n\nHaving moved west from Russia decades earlier, the Arendt family considered themselves very much German, but even before the 1910s were done, Hannah sensed that there were plenty of reactionary people in the country for whom Jewishness and Germanness could never be compatible.\n\nShe felt an emotional closeness to Rahel Varnhagen von Ense (1771-1833), a Prussian socialite whose many attempts to assimilate in Germany had been rebuffed by anti-Semites a century before Arendt's time. She later described Varnhagen as “my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.”\n\nThings didn’t get any better for German Jews like Arendt as the early twentieth century unravelled.\n\nThe rise of Hitler in the 1930s drove her first husband, Gunther Stern, to flee to Paris due both to his Jewishness and his ties to the Communist Party.\n\n'First they came for the communists': Martin Niemoller's famous warning is as relevant as ever\n\nOn violence: the growth of Nazi totalitarianism\n\nArendt stayed behind in Germany, using her apartment in Berlin as a way station for fugitives on the run from Nazism — an echo of the tactics pioneered in the American anti-slavery movement by the likes of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass .\n\nBut Arendt’s place in her homeland was growing more fragile by the day. As a vocal, Jewish critic of Nazism it was only a matter of time before Hitler’s goons came for her.\n\nSure enough, she was soon arrested by the Gestapo for researching anti-Semitism in Germany.\n\nFollowing a stay in prison, Arendt and her family managed to escape Germany to France, only to be followed by Nazi bombers and panzer divisions when they marched west in 1940.\n\nThey would sneak across the Spanish border and eventually to Portugal, catching a boat to the US in May 1941 — where Arendt would remain until her death in 1975.\n\nThis dramatic life etched itself onto Hannah’s now world-famous political and philosophical thought.\n\nThe Philosophy of Hannah Arendt\n\nHer first major book, The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), explored how, rather than just political enemies, totalitarian regimes vilified entire population groups — as Hitler had targeted Arendt and her fellow Jews.\n\nShe later devoted a great deal of criticism to the failure of human rights law to effectively protect refugees, a story whose personal consequences Arendt knew all too well.\n\nClick to see our design inspired by the courage and bravery of refugees, past and present\n\nIn 1961, Arendt traveled to Israel to cover the trial of the infamous Nazi mass murderer, Adolf Eichmann, for the New Yorker.\n\nEichmann ( captured in Argentina) had been a leading architect of the institutionalization of anti-Semitism in Hitler’s Germany which had driven Arendt into exile.\n\nShe now came to study Eichmann as he was brought to justice in Jerusalem — and through him, the nature of evil itself.\n\nAmong the many conclusions which Arendt famously documented in Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on The Banality of Evil, she observed:\n\n“Going along with the rest and wanting to say ‘we’ were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible.”\n\nThis truth endures — as does Arendt's status alongside the likes of Rosa Luxemburg and Sigmund Bauman as one of the great 20th century Jewish thinkers to meet the challenge of oppression head-on.\n\nAll of us today who continue to contest evil stand on her shoulders."
