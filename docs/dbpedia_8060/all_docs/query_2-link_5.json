        "text": "Woody Allen may not be enjoying that many great reviews for his current film, Irrational Man, but he is, as ever, ploughing on with his next annual project which is traditionally holding back its title. We do, however, know who will be part of the cast, as Corey Stoll and Parker Posey are the latest additions.\n\nIt’s Allen’s usual blend of people he’s worked with before and new faces: Stoll is a veteran of** Midnight In Paris** and Posey is in Irrational Man. They join a cast that already includes Kristen Stewart, Bruce Willis, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Jeannie Berlin, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider. As for what the film will be about? Do you really expect us to know this far out? That’s not exactly the Woodster’s style. Hopefully it won’t be another tale of a rough-around-the-edges intellectual who charms a young woman.\n\nAllen is gearing up to start shooting in Los Angeles and his oft-visited stomping grounds of New York this month, with no set release date yet. Will the soundtrack at least be jazzy? We’re confident it will."
