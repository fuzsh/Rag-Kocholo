        "text": "After decades of turning out at least one movie a year, Woody Allen doesn’t have a movie in production, can’t get financing for a future project and isn’t sure when his latest film will be released.\n\nNow 82, the once revered American director of “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan” is feeling the heat of the #MeToo movement, among other things, Page Six is reporting.\n\nIronically, his estranged son Ronan Farrow helped launch the movement by reporting on numerous sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein in the New Yorker in October 2017. Through interviews over the past year, Ronan Farrow also brought back into focus allegations that Allen molested his daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 when she was 7 years old.\n\nAllen continues to vehemently deny the sexual abuse charges and was never formally charged with a crime, although a New York Supreme Court judge in Allen’s child-custody case against Mia Farrow called Allen’s behavior toward Dylan “grossly inappropriate” and said “measures must be taken to protect (Dylan).”\n\nWith no project underway, Allen is taking a vacation, Page Six said. A source said, “Woody loves working. He never takes a vacation. But he will be taking time off this year until he can find a backer.”\n\nAllen wrapped filming on his 48th feature film, “A Rainy Day in New York,” nearly a year ago but the film has yet to schedule a release date.\n\nBoth of Allen’s two most recent films, “Wonder Wheel,” which was released under an uncomfortable #MeToo cloud in December, and “A Rainy Day in New York” were greenlit by Amazon Studios under the leadership of Roy Price, another powerful entertainment figure accused in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Price resigned from Amazon after being suspended for alleged sexual harassment.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a red carpet premiere for “A Rainy Day in New York,” after three of its stars, Timothée Chalamet, Griffin Newman and Rebecca Hall, said they were donating their wages from the film to nonprofits for victims of sexual abuse.\n\nHall, who also starred in Allen’s “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” said she regretted working for Allen. “My actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nA Hollywood producer told Page Six that Allen may no longer be able to attract top talent.\n\n“Woody always got great actors,” the producer said. “Stars would work for scale because it gave them prestige, but with the #MeToo movement, he’s toxic.”\n\nEarlier this year, entertainment writers began to seriously ask whether Allen’s career was over.\n\n“I think the next Woody Allen movie will be the last Woody Allen movie,” tweeted Mark Harris, a writer for Vulture.\n\nHarris tweeted about the Academy Award-winning auteur: “He might get foreign money; he won’t get the kind of cast he wants, and getting U.S. distribution will be hard. All things end.”\n\nWashington Post writer Alyssa Rosenberg wrote that the fact that Allen’s career thrived despite Dylan Farrow’s accusations, “seemed like proof that a woman’s story couldn’t outweigh a man’s professional stature in Hollywood,” Rosenberg wrote. “But a shift appears to be underway.”\n\nAllen has long positioned himself as a director with a strong record of working with actresses and has been known for giving actresses like Diane Keaton, Cate Blanchett, Mira Sorvino and Penelope Cruz opportunities to shine in award-winning film roles.\n\nIn an interview in June with an Argentinian news program, Allen insisted he never acted inappropriately with any of these women.\n\n“I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement, because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all,” the auteur told the Argentinian news program “Periodismo Para Todos,” via Quartz.\n\n“I’ve always had a wonderful record with them,” Allen said.\n\nBut Page Six said there are other reasons it may be time for Allen’s career to fade out, noting that his troubles began before #MeToo.\n\n“His movies don’t make money,” a source told Page Six. “For years, he’s been going from one financier to another. He even went to Europe. But he’s run out of options.”\n\nSome critics and fans think Allen’s peak years as a filmmaker ended in the early 1990s, before his messy breakup with Mia Farrow (when he began a romantic relationship with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn) and before he was accused of molesting Dylan Farrow.\n\nAnd when it comes to how Allen treats women in his films, he has long been criticized by feminists for what they see as two-dimensional depictions of women and for sympathizing with older male protagonists who obsess over and objectify younger women, including teen girls like Mariel Hemingway’s character of “Manhattan.” “"
