        "text": "There is speculation that ace director Woody Allen has reportedly fired Bruce Willis from his new multi-starrer, yet-untitled movie, according to a report.\n\nWillis was the first actor chosen by Allen to cast in the film, which also stars Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider, Deadline reported, adding that Willis' exit from the film was confirmed by Allen's team.\n\nWillis had to quit Allen's film because his schedule with Allen was conflicting with his other work. The “Die Hard” actor is working on the Broadway stage adaptation of Stephen King bestseller and movie, “Misery.” The report also added that Allen is now looking to recast another actor soon to fill in Willis' shoes.\n\nThe news also went viral on Twitter. “He got fired so don't hold your breath...,” film reporter Jeff Sneider wrote on Twitter while talking about Willis.\n\n“‪@TheInSneider‪ Yep. Fired. A friend is on the film. Bruce couldn't remember a line. Cue cards were no help. Cast were losing their minds,” wrote another Twitter user Tom O'Leary.\n\nMeawnhile, various websites, including Tom and Lorenzo, published pictures of the actor working on the set of Allen's movie in Beverly Hills. However, the news of Willis getting fired should not come as a surprise because Allen has fired actors in the past too, even after shooting half of the film with them. Allen replaced actor Michael Keaton by Jeff Daniels after he shot for ten days with Allen for his movie, “The Purple Rose Of Cairo.” Actress Juliette Lewis replaced Emily Lloyd in “Husbands and Wives” after Lewis shot a couple of scenes in the film."
