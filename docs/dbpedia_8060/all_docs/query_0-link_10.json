Having said that, the cast for Allen’s still untitled 2016 film was recently revealed in a press release, and it’s no exception.\n\nThe cast includes Kristen Stewart (On the Road), Blake Lively (Age of Adaline), Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network), Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Parker Posey (Dazed and Confused), Ken Stott (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey), Jeannie Berlin (The Heartbreak Kid) and Corey Stoll (Ant-Man). Set to co-star in the film are actors Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect), Stephen Kunken (Still Alice), Sari Lennick (A Serious Man) and Paul Schneider (Parks and Recreation).\n\nSome of the listed actors have worked with Allen before, such as Eisenberg, Parker and Stoll. Eisenberg worked with him on 2012’s To Rome With Love, Parker starred in his recent film Irrational Man and Stoll played Ernest Hemingway in 2011’s Midnight in Paris.\n\nThe film will be Allen’s follow-up to this year’s Irrational Man, which hit theaters just a few weeks ago; it will begin shooting in New York and Los Angeles this month.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k_v0cVxqEY"
