Willis was one of the first actors to be set, in a cast that features Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, The Strain‘s Corey Stoll, Ken Stott Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.\n\nWoody’s camp confirmed this development and that Willis’ plan to work with Allen was hobbled by his other plan to take the Broadway stage in the adaptation of the Stephen King bestseller and movie classic Misery. Allen will recast in time to keep the production on schedule. The film’s produced by his longtime collaborators Letty Aronson and Steve Tenenbaum, and Edward Walson. Executive producers are Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern, and Allan Teh.\n\ndeadline-logo-svg Deadline\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
