        "text": "Title? Check! Brief synopsis? Check! Supporting players? Check! French president’s wife to star in the pic? Check! THR reports that Woody Allen’s Spanish financed, Paris-set rom com has got a working title and a brief synopsis that sort of goes thematically hand in hand with Vicky Cristina Barcelona and potentially You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. What will be coined as Allen’s Euro Rom Com trilogy, on paper the three films appear to flirt with the idea that capital cities of Europe are a breeding ground for fusions between the opposite sexes and might also be the battling ground where couples go astray. Joining the often cited participation of Carla Bruni, we have Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen, Nina Arianda, Tom Hiddleston, Corey Stoll, Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller all coming on board as supporting players.\n\nMidnight in Paris tells the story of a family traveling to the French capital for business which features a young engaged couple forced to confront the illusion that a life different from their own is better. Shooting takes place this Summer and I think it’s safe to say that Cannes will host the world preem of this film in 2011."
