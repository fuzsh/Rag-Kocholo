        "text": "Scoring a hat trick, Woody Allen will open the Cannes Film Festival with his latest comedy, Café Society. This is a record-breaking third time the director will raise the curtain on Cannes after 2002’s Hollywood Ending, and 2011’s Midnight In Paris. As is typical of Allen’s films, Café Society will run out of competition. The 69th Cannes fest opens on May 11.\n\nKristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Steve Carell and Corey Stoll star in the story of a young man who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry. There, he falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant café society that defined the spirit of the age.\n\nWhile Mars Films has French distribution — with the local release coinciding with the festival’s opening — this is the first time a film that Amazon will release domestically has been given such a stage. It also marks a first-ever teaming between Allen and legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.\n\nBeginning with Manhattan in 1979 and through to Irrational Man in 2015, 12 films Allen has directed have appeared on the Riviera over the course of his career. A further two films in which he featured have also been in Official Selection.\n\nCafé Society is produced by Letty Aronson (Gravier Productions), Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson, as a co-production with Helen Robin (Perdido Productions). Executive producers are Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern and Marc I. Stern. FilmNation Entertainment sold rights to Mars and ICM Partners brokered the deal with Amazon.\n\nCannes runs May 11-22. George Miller is competition jury president with the rest of the Official Selection titles to be announced April 14.\n\nRelated stories\n\n'The Tick' Revival: Peter Serafinowicz To Play The Blue Superhero In Amazon Pilot\n\n'The Royals' Ups Genevieve Gaunt; 'The Patriot' Promotes Chris Conrad\n\nCannes Film Festival Unveils 'Contempt'-Inspired Official Poster"
