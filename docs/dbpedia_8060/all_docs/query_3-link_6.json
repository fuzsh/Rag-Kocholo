        "text": "Blake Lively, Corey Stoll and Parker Posey have joined the cast of Woody Allen‘s upcoming film.\n\nIt had been previously announced that Kristen Stewart, Bruce Willis and Jesse Eisenberg would star in the movie.\n\nThe full roster for the film, which begins shooting this month in New York and Los Angeles, was revealed on Tuesday. The cast also includes Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott, as well as co-stars Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.\n\nAllen’s new film is produced by his longtime collaborators, Letty Aronson and Steve Tenenbaum, and Edward Walson. It’s executive produced by Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern and Allan Teh.\n\n“Annie Hall” was the last pic the famed director, who releases a movie every year, shot in Los Angeles. Although 2013’s “Blue Jasmine” was filmed in San Francisco and New York City, Allen, who’s famous for his NYC-set films, has been shying away from the city due to high production costs, and opting for international destinations like Paris, Rome and Barcelona.\n\nAllen’s most recent movie, “Irrational Man,” also starred Posey, while Eisenberg appeared in 2012’s “To Rome With Love.”"
