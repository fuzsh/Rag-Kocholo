        "text": "Woody Allen's new film Café Society, which is scheduled to make its world premiere May 11 as the prestigious opening attraction of the 69th Annual Cannes Film Festival, will open in limited release in the U.S. July 15, and begin a general release July 29, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nAs is traditional for Allen's movies, it will not be in competition for prizes at Cannes.\n\nBruce Willis was originally scheduled to star, but last fall it was announced that conflicting schedules forced Willis to choose between two tantalizing career opportunities: his Broadway debut in Stephen King's Misery or his first starring role in an Allen film. He chose Broadway.\n\nComic actor Steve Carrell was tapped to replace Willis in the movie, which also features Kristen Stewart, Stephen Kunken, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.\n\nShooting took place in New York and Los Angeles. The title is also the name of a Manhattan nightclub that was trendy in the 1930s, the time period of the film."
