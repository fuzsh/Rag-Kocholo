        "text": "out of\n\nMidnight in Paris (June 15/11)\n\nWoody Allen's most entertaining comedy in years, Midnight in Paris follows an American screenwriter (Owen Wilson's Gil) as he's magically transported back to the roaring '20s - with the film subsequently detailing Gil's attempts at balancing his time in both the present and the past. There's little doubt that Midnight in Paris, in its early stages, comes off as a fairly typical Allen effort, as the movie initially details the back-and-forth dynamic between Gil and his seemingly incompatible girlfriend (Rachel McAdams' Inez) - with an ongoing (and anticipated) emphasis on Gil's neurotic exploits (eg Gil worries about Inez's friendship with a pompous professor, Gil contemplates moving to Paris permanently, etc, etc). Wilson's charming performance and the picturesque atmosphere ensure that the movie fares well enough in its early stages, although, as inevitably becomes clear, Midnight in Paris improves considerably once Gil takes his first trip through time - as the inherently compelling nature of the character's fish-out-of-water exploits are heightened by the irresistible presence of several familiar historical figures (eg F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, etc). The pervasively pleasant atmosphere effectively compensates for the few lulls within the narrative - eg Gil's encounter with an almost unreasonably quirky Salvador Dal√≠ (Adrien Brody) - which ultimately cements Midnight in Paris' place as a crowd-pleasing, consistently engrossing effort from a far-from-reliable filmmaker.\n\nout of\n\nTo Rome with Love (August 13/12)\n\nTo Rome with Love marks Woody Allen's first film since staging a comeback (of sorts) with the vastly entertaining Midnight in Paris, and it is, as such, disappointing to note that the movie, which admittedly does start out with some promise, ultimately becomes just as aimless and tedious as such recent Allen failures as Whatever Works and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Set, of course, entirely in Rome, To Rome with Love details the exploits of several disparate characters as they confront a variety of issues in and around Italy's famed capital city - with, for example, the movie following Roberto Benigni's Leopoldo as he becomes an overnight celebrity for no discernable reason and Jesse Eisenberg's Jack as he's forced to choose between his girlfriend (Greta Gerwig's Sally) and his girlfriend's best pal (Ellen Page's Monica). There's no arguing that Allen does a terrific job of instantly drawing the viewer into the lighthearted proceedings, as the filmmaker offers up a fast-paced and jaunty feel that's reflected in, among other things, the uniformly charismatic performances and irresistibly animated score. The easygoing vibe persists right up until around the halfway mark, after which point it does become more and more difficult to comfortably swallow the increasingly surreal nature of some of these subplots - with, especially, the entire Benigni tale wearing out its welcome to an almost astonishing degree (ie it's just silly). It doesn't help, either, that the movie suffers from a midsection that is, for the most part, meandering to the point of distraction, with the spinning-its-wheels atmosphere paving the way for a final third that is, to put it mildly, somewhat anticlimactic (ie it's impossible to work up the slightest interest in the exploits of a man who can only sing well in the shower). The end result is as uneven and erratic an effort as Allen as ever released, which is a shame, certainly, given the strength of its opening half hour.\n\nout of\n\nBlue Jasmine (August 1/13)\n\nAn uneven yet engaging effort from Woody Allen, Blue Jasmine follows Cate Blanchett's Jasmine as she attempts to start her life over after the sudden dissolution of her marriage to Alec Baldwin's wealthy financier. Writer/director Allen has infused Blue Jasmine with a typically low-key feel that does, at the outset, prevent the viewer from wholeheartedly embracing the narrative, with the subdued atmosphere compounded by a narrative that almost seems too simple and underdeveloped. It eventually does become clear, however, that Allen has more in mind than just a typical fall-from-grace story, with the impressively unpredictable arc of Blanchett's layered character lifting the film out of its doldrums on a continuous basis - as the character, anchored by Blanchett's frequently stunning performance, becomes a far more engrossing and complex figure than one might've initially suspected. It's just a shame, then, that the narrative is, for the most part, unable to lift itself up to Blanchett's level, although Allen admittedly does a nice job of offering up a few compelling stretches within the lackadaisical midsection (eg Jasmine meets Peter Sarsgaard's charming, affluent Dwight). The end result is a better-than-average contemporary Allen effort that benefits substantially from Blanchett's tour-de-force turn as the title character, as the movie is otherwise exactly the sort of aimless and underwhelming endeavor that one has come to expect from the aging filmmaker.\n\nout of\n\nMagic in the Moonlight\n\nIrrational Man (August 21/15)\n\nIrrational Man casts Joaquin Phoenix as Abe Lucas, a depressive college professor who discovers a newfound zest for life after deciding to commit a murderous act - with the movie detailing the impact of Abe's decision on a lovestruck student named Jill (Emma Stone). Filmmaker Woody Allen's screenplay is chock-a-block with relatively interesting ideas revolving primarily around philosophical concepts and theories, and yet, by that same token, the relentless emphasis on academic conversations grows more and more exhausting as time slowly progresses - with Allen's reluctance to offer up more than a few kernels of character development exacerbating the movie's hands-off atmosphere. Phoenix and Stone's top-notch work helps lift one's dwindling interest on a sporadic basis, while the aforementioned murderous act ensures that, at the very least, there's a little momentum contained within the movie's second half. Given the subject matter, however, Irrational Man suffers from an almost total lack of tension that is, to say the least, surprising (and disappointing) - although it's worth noting that the movie does improve slightly in its crime-focused final stretch (and that resolution is quite shocking, to be sure). It's ultimately clear that Irrational Man comes off as the latest misguided endeavor from Allen, which is too bad, of course, given the strength of Phoenix's typically commanding turn as the conflicted central character.\n\nout of\n\nCaf√© Society (July 27/16)\n\nSet in the 1930s, Caf√© Society follows Bronx native Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) as he arrives in Hollywood and almost immediately begins working for his powerful movie-agent uncle (Steve Carrell's Phil) - with the narrative primarily revolving around the tentative romantic relationship that forms between Bobby and Kristen Stewart's Vonnie. It's ultimately clear that Caf√© Society fares best in its lighthearted and almost compulsively watchable first half, as writer/director Woody Allen does a marvelous job of establishing the movie's opulent atmosphere and the various characters residing within. In terms of the latter, Caf√© Society boasts an impressive roster of performers that includes, among others, Corey Stoll, Parker Posey, and Blake Lively - although it remains clear that the film's success is due in no small part to the efforts of its three stars. (Eisenberg is especially strong here, as the actor generally drops the twitchy and fast-talking persona with which he's associated.) And while the whole thing is very charming and completely affable, Caf√© Society eventually does reach a point at which it slowly-but-surely loses its grip on the viewer - with the narrative's third-act shift in locale from Los Angeles to New York wreaking havoc on the movie's momentum and paving the way for a palpably erratic final half hour. The somewhat repetitive bent of that climactic stretch only compounds the decidedly uneven feel, and it is, in the end, obvious that Caf√© Society falls right in line with much of Allen's good-but-not-great output as of late.\n\nout of\n\nWonder Wheel (December 31/17)\n\nA sporadically agreeable misfire, Wonder Wheel follows circa 1950s carnival employees (and married couple) Humpty (Jim Belushi) and Ginny (Kate Winslet) as they reluctantly agree to take in a floundering relative (Juno Temple's Carolina) - with complications ensuing as Ginny embarks on a torrid affair with a local lifeguard named Mickey (Justin Timberlake). Filmmaker Woody Allen has infused Wonder Wheel with the pronounced feel of a filmed play, as much of the narrative transpires within Humpty and Ginny's cramped (yet colorful) apartment - with the novelty of the movie's locale playing an instrumental role in initially staving off the expectedly stagy vibe. Winslet's lived-in performance certainly goes a long way towards keeping things interesting, while Allen effectively elicits strong work from eclectic supporting players like Belushi and Timberlake (the latter is undoubtedly far better here than one might've anticipated). The meandering bent of Allen's script, coupled with the overt familiarity of the storyline, ensures that Wonder Wheel suffers from a somewhat lackluster midsection, with the one-note atmosphere paving the way for a second half that slowly-but-surely fizzles out to a fairly distressing degree - which confirms the picture's place as just another subpar entry within Allen's increasingly erratic filmography.\n\nout of"
