        "text": "Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Steve Carrell just filmed a scene for Woody Allen’s latest movie at 627 West End Ave., a turn-of-the-century townhouse that is now on the market for $6.99 million.\n\n(Makes sense, given that it’s an untitled period piece, featuring other stars like Parker Posey, Blake Lively, Corey Stoll and Judy Davis.)\n\nThe five-story, five-bedroom spread on the Upper West Side totals 6,200 square feet. The home comes with details like eight fireplaces — the one in the living room has a marble mantel — an original staircase, plaster moldings and hardware floors with mahogany inlay trim.\n\nThe home also boasts two maids’ rooms, a library and Roman arches and columns in the parlor foyer. There’s a back staircase behind the kitchen as well.\n\nThe owner is Broadway producer Tracy Aron, whose credits include “Spring Awakening.”\n\nShe first listed the home in 2008 for $7.35 million.\n\nBy 2013, the home was on the market for $7.89 million. She bought it for a mere $2 million in 1997.\n\nBroker Karen Kelley of the Corcoran Group could not be reached for comment. In the listing, she notes that this is the only townhouse on the Upper West Side listed below $17 million."
