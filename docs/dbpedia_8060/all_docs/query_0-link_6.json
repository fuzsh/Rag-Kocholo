        "text": "As usual, plot details on the new Woody Allen film are under wraps, but it will be released before the Amazon mini-series that will debut in 2016. Already announced in the starry ensemble cast are Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart and Bruce Willis.\n\nToday, the rest of the cast was announced: it includes Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick, Paul Schneider and Jeannie Berlin. All we know so far is that the film begins shooting this month on location in New York and Los Angeles, while the Amazon pilot will shoot in January.\n\nREAD MORE: L.A. Film Fest Review: ‘To Rome With Love’ Is Another Minor Foreign Postcard From Woody Allen\n\nAs for the Amazon show, a representative recently commented on the upcoming series at a recent TCA event. “Woody Allen is one of the greatest filmmakers America has ever produced,” Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios said. “People are going to be talking about Woody’s films for a long, long time. When we talk about what would be a great inspiration for a show, a lot of Woody Allen films kept coming up like ‘Annie Hall.’ We thought, ‘what if we actually asked Woody Allen himself to do a show?’ That was our focus.”"
