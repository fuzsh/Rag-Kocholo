        "text": "Following the report Bruce Willis was forced to leave the production of Woody Allen's next film, Allen has moved quickly to find his replacement, as sources told Entertainment website Variety that Steve Carell will replace Willis in it.\n\nCarell joins Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider in the cast, with Allen writing and directing.\n\nThe film is currently untitled and without distribution. As has been the case with several of Allen's past films, Sony Classics is the front-runner to land the deal. As always, plot details are under wraps, and the shoot is currently under way.\n\nAllen and Carell previously worked together on “Melinda and Melinda” in 2004. Carell can be seen next in the drama “Freeheld” alongside Julianne Moore, Michael Shannon and Ellen Page."
