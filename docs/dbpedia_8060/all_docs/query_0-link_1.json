        "text": "The cast has been finalized for Woody Allen‘s next movie, as usual still untitled and mostly under wraps. Oscar nominee Jeannie Berlin, The Strain‘s Corey Stoll and Ken Stott (the Hobbit movies) join Parker Posey, Blake Lively, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Bruce Willis in the film, which begins shooting this month in New York and Los Angeles. Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick, and Paul Schneider also have come aboard as co-stars.\n\nThe pic is being produced by Allen’s longtime collaborators Letty Aronson and Steve Tenenbaum, and Edward Walson. Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern, and Allan Teh are executive producers.\n\nAllen told Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr. in May that he was thinking of shooting his next film on digital for the first time. “I’ve never shot anything in digital, but I think I will shoot my next film digitally to see what that’s like,” said the filmmaker, who also has a deal to write a TV series for Amazon Studios. “It is more than the wave of the future; it’s the wave of the present, really.”\n\nAllen’s last pic Irrational Man was released in July by Sony Pictures Classics and starred Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix."
