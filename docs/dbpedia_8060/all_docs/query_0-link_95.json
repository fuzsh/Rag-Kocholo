        "text": "To put it mildly.\n\nAs I mentioned a couple of times, I had a lengthy streak of seeing Woody's movies on opening night, starting with Danny Rose and running through Hollywood Ending, with only a couple exceptions (I had to wait a day for Deconstructing, and can't recall what happened with Sweet & Lowdown's goofy distribution). But when I saw the trailer for Anything Else - I had ZERO interest in ever seeing the film. It actually does a great job of distilling the film to its essence, because watching those 150 seconds makes me feel like I've experienced the entire excruciating 1hr 49 minute film all over again. I didn't go opening night. I didn't go the next night. I didn't go the first week, and that's as long as it played the first-run theatre here (even the one that always exhibits his films). A week or two later, it showed up in the cheapie $2 theatres and I dragged myself to it for a Saturday matinee (because I knew it wouldn't last more than a week there - and it didn't). I think there were four other people there besides me.\n\nWhy do I hate this film so much? Biggs & Ricci. I'll start with him. I'd never seen him in anything before (nor since) - American Pie is not my kind of comedy. But he's not an actor I had any specific aversion to, either. Aside from the talentless Keanu Reeves, there aren't too many actors that I regard with any particular animosity, although I could probably toss a few talentless comics (Pauly Shore?) in that group. Anyway, all I'm saying is that I didn't have any preconceived notions of him ... until he opened his mouth. In one of his first few lines, he speaks of his devoted manager, Danny Rose Harvey Wexler, and says he's \"My cross to bear\". His delivery of the line is so ponderous, so unconvincing. But that's how he does the whole movie, like he's drugged and only semi-conscious. When you've made nearly 50 feature films, you're bound to have a few casting choices come off poorly, but Biggs has got to be near the top of the list. \"Falk\" isn't written well, but Biggs doesn't do him any favors. When you call him \"blah\", \"third-rate\" and a \"doormat\", you're showering him with compliments.\n\nNow let's move on to her. I have seen Ricci in other roles and think she's talented. But \"Amanda\" is a woman I'd never want to spend five minutes with. The opening credits feature \"You'd Be So Easy To Love\". Then, Amanda is described as \"the most beautiful, charming, sexy\" woman. \"Wait till you meet her,\" Falk says directly to the audience (ala Alvy Singer), \"she is adorable.\" Then she enters the picture, showing up in \"a bad mood\" significantly late for a dinner date with Falk. She forces him to pay for her cab and she recites the (unfunny) litany of things she's already eaten in a scene that seems to go on forever, due to the lack of chemistry between these two. As soon as that scene ends, the next words out of her mouth are that her mother's moving in. Who finds this woman adorable??? I DESPISE HER. This is the woman \"so easy to idolize, all others above\"???\n\nWithin the next couple minutes of screen time, she's bitching that he's giving her a migraine, then she's giving him a \"poorly wrapped\" anniversary present (which she admits losing her temper about), and then she's ragging on his past girlfriends (\"the losers you dated before me\"). This isn't a Kamikaze woman - this is Lizzie Borden!! She's horrible. In most of the film she doesn't even look particularly attractive, frequently with her hair all tied back, wearing dull-colored t-shirts and so on (like the screen capture in the trailer you posted above). She won't sleep with him, but she does with other guys. Falk - HURRY - go back to the cute blonde woman (Brooke, the \"loser you dated before\" Amanda)!!\n\nThat's enough gripes for starters, I'll have more later.\n\nHere's your hero, talking about his most recent starring role. I see no difference between Jerry Falk, Larry Bloom (his character on \"Orange is the New Black\") and Jason Biggs. He doesn't seem to ACT at all - he is just himself, and that's not a good thing. Bet no one will make it to the end.\n\nAnd I don't think we're supposed to find Amanda adorable, at all (other than being physically attractive). We're supposed to find humor in the abuse she heaps on Jerry. Dobel (the true hero of the piece) sees right through Amanda after one meeting. It's interesting to me that the first choice to play Amanda was Winona Ryder, whose character in \"Celebrity\" is pretty darn close to Amanda (a self-absorbed would-be actress who is a serial cheater).\n\nSome other gripes about Anything Else. As usual for a later film, the WARF (Woody Allen Repetition Factor) score for this film was pretty high. Ray cited a couple examples earlier, and I alluded to another - did anyone else find it odd to have Danny DeVito playing \"Danny Rose\" to Jason Biggs’ \"Alvy Singer\" in this film? At least DeVito was entertaining. You could almost picture him doing the \"real\" Danny Rose (\"All the other managers in town, even my own family predicted that you would dump me if you made it big on my efforts\"). I certainly think I’d rather have Lou Canova as my primary client, though, rather than Jerry Falk. Regardless, it’s hard not to think of those two characters’ earlier versions when these echoes are onscreen. If the roles weren't similar enough (devoted manager and aspiring comic writer), you've also got to notice when Falk speaks directly to the audience (ala Alvy), with Biggs' unfortunate monotone delivery. Btw, did anyone miss that Val Waxman hated to “sleep alone” in the last film? No worries, we’ll transfer that same phobia to Falk for this film...\n\nAnyone have an issue with these twenty-somethings and their artistic interests and discussions? During a very brief few minutes at the start of the film, they gush over Sartre, Eugene O’Neill, Tennessee Williams, Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Edna Millay and so forth. Umm - that's just so NOT like anyone in that age group that I know (or should I say, knew, at the time). When Falk meets Amanda at a record store, he awkwardly wants to buy her a Diana Krall LP (that reference actually is modern - retro-modern, perhaps, but believable), but then two minutes later wants to buy her a Cole Porter collection as well (oops, there we go again).\n\nAfter Dobel buys Falk a gun, we get the \"don't pull the trigger, squeeze it\" line (from Love & Death) in a really awful scene back at Jerry & Amanda's apartment. What's amazing to me about this scene is how, when Amanda arrives, no attempt is made to introduce these two significant (for Falk) people to each other. Earlier, Falk had raved about Dobel and Amanda replied \"When will I meet this polymath?\"* Yet no attempt is made at pleasantries, even after the gun is put down. Then, when Amanda's mother arrives, a couple minutes later, again no attempt is made to introduce these people who've never met and are now at close quarters (with a rifle at hand, no less!). \"Mom\" just looks at him and says, \"Sir, would you mind helping me shift this piano?\" and that's when Amanda chimes in, \"Mother, he's a guest.\" \"I don't care who the hell he is,\" mom replies.\n\nWhat awful, unrealistic dialogue!\n\nIt is a shame that Woody gave himself such an interesting role - too bad the only actor he gave himself real screen time to work off was Jason Biggs! His description of his breakdown \"I just wanted the girl\" is great, as is his taking a tire iron to the car windshield of a couple of Neanderthals. However, his overemphasized vocabulary isn't funny, his (overlong) masturbation discussion isn't particularly funny and too many of his jokes just aren't funny enough to redeem the film much. Definitely my least favorite of his films.\n\nAlso worth noting that I find the multiple references to Amanda finding lovers like her father more than just a little creepy - couldn't someone have suggested those get reworked? Remarkably, this film was allegedly adapted from Woody's finished, but unreleased novel - I think I'm glad it never saw the light of day.\n\nI also vaguely recall some fairly unflattering comments about this film from Stockard Channing when it was issued. I seem to remember her saying that she couldn't understand what she was supposed to do with the role, or that she couldn't understand the film or something like that.\n\nAnyway, is the slump officially over now? We'll soon see...\n\n*if you grimaced at young Amanda referring to Dobel as a \"polymath\", good for you. Again - awful, unrealistic dialogue!\n\nI obviously like the film more than you do, but I can't disagree with very many of the points that you raise.\n\nThe \"Broadway Danny Rose\" parallel occurred to me as well, and is part of some pretty heavy duty recycling done in this script. And buying the Cole Porter - maybe we can call that a \"precycle\" from \"Midnight in Paris\".\n\nI am in agreement with Stockard Channing (and you) that her role is thankless. She seems to be there just to be another annoyance to Jerry (when in doubt, bring in a mother-in-law, a trick as old as Ethel Merman).\n\nThe pop culture references all being out of date didn't even occur to me. Maybe because my avatar over there has been dead over 100 years, and I've seen every movie Humphrey Bogart ever made even though he died before I was born. But you're probably right.\n\nI still think this is a better film - in fact, a FAR better film, than \"Hollywood Ending\". It's a bit funny to me that we go from Dobel providing his wisdom directly at the start of the film ... to Jerry passing Dobel's wisdom along via hearsay ... to finally a computer screen that just has Jerry TYPING what Dobel has said (and that typing is still more interesting than listening to Jason Biggs speak).\n\n2004: \"Melinda and Melinda\"\n\nI'm wagering that this is another film I'll like more than the average contributor to this thread. Part of my bias derives from the fact that a big chunk of the exterior shots for this film were done in the neighborhood where I worked for 15 years (and where I was working when this film was made).\n\nAt the time I was working on East 76th Street between Park Avenue and Madison Avenue. Woody and his family were living on East 74th Street and 5th Avenue. So basically he was 2 blocks down and one avenue over. I passed them walking on the street (often with a baby stroller early on) a number of times before and during this period. This area of Madison Avenue was a very popular spot for filming - there was about a 50-50 chance that there'd be filming on any given day, so I'm sure I walked by \"Melinda and Melinda\" filming numerous times without bothering to stop. If you've ever witnessed location filming it is incredibly tedious and actually quite dull. And it's not like there was a neon sign saying \"Untitled Woody Allen Project 2004\". In the years that followed, chances were good that if you walked by filming in this area it was for \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nNot that anyone is likely to care very much, but the scene 21 minutes into the film, where Laurel (Chloe Sevigny) and Cassie (Brooke Smith) walk to lunch, is on sidewalks I traversed thousands of times. They are walking up Madison Avenue from East 75th Street to East 76th Street. You can see the Whitney Museum of American Art (corner of East 75th & Madison) reflected in the shop window that they are looking into. They pass Three Guys Restaurant (most expensive grilled cheese on the planet), and make a left onto East 76th Street. As they turn the corner, you can see Carlyle Photo across the street on the East side of Madison Avenue. I worked a couple of buildings down East 76th in that direction (East) and the Carlyle Hotel, the home of Woody's Monday night musical performances is not in the shot, but would be if the camera just swung a bit more to the left (one building up from the Northeast corner of East 76th and Madison). Laurel and Cassie pass the Ariadne Galleries, the Surrey Hotel, and have lunch at a sidewalk cafe on East 76th (a real location, and not dressed in any special way for the film, just as I remember it). Later on in the film, when Melinda goes to the hospital to get a tick removed, she goes to Lenox Hill Hospital, which is on East 77th Street off of Park Avenue (the imdb \"trivia\" has the wrong address for the hospital). So much of \"Melinda and Melinda\" is in Woody's neighborhood on the Upper East Side, that when Lee is seen, drunk, outside of Joe Allen's (on West 46th Street), it's almost like he's on another planet - the West Side!\n\nI'll offer my comments on the film itself a bit later.\n\nMy thoughts on the film:\n\nFirst off, I think this is a terrific premise for a film. That being said, the bookend scenes in the restaurant with the playwrights are very stiff, sound completely unnatural and scripted, and seem unnecessarily dumbed down. Yes, a drama and a comedy - we get it!\n\nThe comedy half of the film is uneven. It certainly has its funny moments, and no knock on Will Ferrell (who is certainly not my favorite comedian but is generally adequate here), but the comedy half of the film would have been a perfect fit for a late 1970s Woody Allen. I can just hear Woody asking \"Did you shoot all of the furniture?\" and going on about feeling like nobody when you're around anybody's who's somebody (or something like that). \"Of course we communicate, now can we just not talk about it?\" would have been an iconic line if it were from \"Annie Hall\". The romantic ending once again falls flat (like in \"Jade Scorpion\" and \"Hollywood Ending\") and seems rushed and tacked on. And the entire subplot with the conservative-investment-analyst-Playboy-poser and her sudden desire to \"go out the window\" is so far-fetched as to just be plain dumb.\n\nI like the dramatic half of the movie more than the comedy half. Apart from a handful of lines that sound oh-so-scripted, I find the love triangle intriguing, and in particular I like Chloe Sevigny and Brooke Smith (the latter, in particular, just sounds perfectly natural when delivering her lines). I'm not sure whether I dislike Radha Mitchell's performance because I dislike \"dramatic\" Melinda (I like kamikaze, but whiny, suicidal kamikaze not so much), or her performance isn't really what it needs to be. Regardless, I find myself \"rooting\" for Laurel to wind up with Ellis. I'm a sucker for an unhappy ending (part of the allure of \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"), and the dramatic half of the film certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard. \"It's sad, but we have to move on with our lives\" may not be \"Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown\", but it's close enough for me. Laurel is the anti-Rick Blaine - a nice guy on the outside but when push comes to shove she chooses her own happiness over \"the cause\" (her friend's sanity, apparently). The ending of a beautiful friendship, Louie.\n\nOn the whole, no masterpiece, but another positive step away from the Scorpion/Hollywood abyss.\n\nAren't you back one year early?\n\nIt would have been wonderful if the two pieces contrasted in an illuminating way, but I make myself content with the fact that no one is hypnotized or hysterically blind in either half.\n\nIf we'd like to draw some very loose parallels that may or may not be accurate, Woody's integration of African-American characters has moved from the Hattie McDaniel era (\"Cookie\" in \"Deconstructing Harry\") to the Sidney Poitier era with Ellis Moonsong and Billy Wheeler. Following my I-think-Woody-sometimes-names-characters-after-NBA-players theory, I suspect Ellis Moonsong's name was inspired by the Kansas City Kings/New Jersey Nets guard:\n\nI had the same reaction to Ellis's apartment that you did - he plays piano at parties so he can afford a multi-million dollar apartment. Life is good.\n\nExactly.\n\nAfter the 1-2 punch of Hollywood Ending and Anything Else - arguably two of the worst films he ever wrote/directed - I was genuinely excited by the premise of this film. When I cued it up over the weekend, I realized I had very little memory of the actual storyline of the film and you know what? In about a year, I probably won't have much memory of it, once again. It's completely forgettable. Completely unremarkable. So this brilliant premise showcasing tragedy and comedy starts with ... an unexpected dinner party crasher? Really? That's the impetus for this? Couldn't most of us come up with a more interesting idea to flesh this premise out? An auto accident? A missed airline flight? A mis-delivered package?\n\nOk, so that's where he chose to start. Fine. But couldn't there have been a more intriguing storyline with some twists along the way? Seriously, I watched this film last night, and I'm having a hard time remembering the motivations behind almost any of the characters. Amanda Peet was making a film and her husband was an out-of-work actor. Was Chloe Sevigny making a film, too? I know her husband was an actor, but I can't remember what she was doing...\n\nI do remember hearing, once again, some ridiculous dialogue: \"I'm running out of obsequious banter!\" Or my favorite: \"They would have you believe I couldn't hold my liquor, which anyone who knows me knows is a baseless canard.\" A baseless canard? Did Thurston Howell III somehow get injected into the film from Ray's Gilligan's Island post upthread?\n\nI don't find the comedy funny/clever at all. I'll be the first to admit I don't care for Will Ferrell in the slightest - hearing he was going to be in this movie was not good news for me. I don't find what I've seen of his comedies funny - although my coworkers can seemingly be brought to tears thinking about him in his underpants on the race track in whatever racing spoof he made. And whenever he appears on the Oscars or Golden Globes or whatever, I sit stonefaced while he slays the audience. But when I hear him answer the question \"What do you do for exercise?\" with \"Tiddlywinks and an occasional anxiety attack\", I shudder. That's not a funny line. Neither is the \"cause I'm the color of guacamole\" line, or countless others in the film. I think Ray got all two or three of the genuinely funny lines above.\n\nSo the comedy isn't funny and ... the tragedy isn't very tragic. Woody tries to make it so as they come for Melinda at the end, but it feels false to me. Again, I don't really seem to recall what everyone is doing in this film. I do recall how the women awkwardly seem to want to get Melinda matched FOR LIFE with the dentist in the film (\"Melinda would have a ready made family\") - umm, don't people at that age know to just introduce folks and see if there's a connection? Do they really think that far ahead? Why, perhaps they do in Woody's world, where in 2004, he's got this guy \"placing ads in the personals columns\". Personals columns? Really?\n\nIt's this awkward lack of awareness of the modern era, coupled with Woody's stilted dialogue, that now makes you start to think he should either (a) not write stories about folks younger than him or (b) if he does, he should set those stories in another era. Fortunately, he'd regain his footing once again, at least a couple of times, but I think this film - despite it's great premise - is ultimately not far from the bottom rungs of the ladder..."
