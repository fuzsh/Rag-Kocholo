        "text": "Blake Lively, Kristen Stewart, and Jesse Eisenberg are set to tackle director Woody Allen's quick-fire neurotic dialogue in his next, as-of-yet untitled film, joining the likes of Bruce Willis, Parker Posey and Corey Stoll.\n\nThe film, which also stars Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott, will begin filming this month in New York and Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Anna Camp and Paul Schneider are included in the list of \"co-stars\", reported Ace Showbiz.\n\nThe film will mark the third time that Stewart and Eisenberg team up for a feature film. The duo previously worked together in 2009's Adventureland and most recently in American Ultra.\n\nThe film will also become Allen's first film to shoot in New York after the director has decided not to shoot in the Big Apple for years due to its prohibitive expense.\n\nHis last few films have taken place in locations like Rhode Island (Irrational Man), France and the UK (Magic in the Moonlight), San Francisco (Blue Jasmine) and Paris (Midnight in Paris).\n\nAllen's longtime collaborators Letty Aronson and Steve Tenenbaum are producing with Edward Walson. Ronald L Chez, Adam B Stern and Allan Teh are tapped as executive producers."
