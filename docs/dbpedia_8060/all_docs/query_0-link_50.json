        "text": "Woody Allen has signed a deal with online giant Amazon, selling them the rights to his latest film.\n\nAmazon will screen the film, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Steve Carell and Blake Lively, in cinemas this summer before making it available to customers on its streaming service Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe as-yet untitled 1930s romantic comedy also features Twilight actress Kristen Stewart, Academy Award nominee Jeannie Berlin and House of Cards actor Corey Stoll.\n\nIn response to the news, Mr Allen said in a statement: “Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection, and genuine goodwill - the lawsuits come later.”\n\nThe 80-year-old director, who has won four Academy Awards, has also written a six-episode television series for Amazon which will start shooting in March.\n\nThe programme will star Academy Award-nominated Jewish actress Elaine May - whose daughter is Ms Berlin - and Grammy-nominated Miley Cyrus.\n\nAmazon head Roy Price said: “Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker. We’re so proud to be in business with him for both his next film and his first ever TV series.”"
