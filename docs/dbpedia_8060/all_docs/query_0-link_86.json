        "text": "Bruce Willis, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and more join Woody Allen’s Latest\n\nWoody Allen revealed today the cast of his latest, currently-untitled film. The cast includes Jeannie Berlin (Inherent Vice), Jesse Eisenberg (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), Blake Lively (Age of Adeline), Parker Posey (Best in Show), Kristen Stewart (The Twilight Saga), Corey Stoll (Ant-Man), Ken Stott (The Hobbit Trilogy), and Bruce Willis (Moonrise Kingdom). Co-stars are Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect 1 & 2), Stephen Kunken (Still Alice), Sari Lennick (A Serious Man), and Paul Schneider (Water for Elephants).\n\nAllen’s new film is produced by his long-time collaborators Letty Aronson, Steve Tenenbaum and Edward Walson. Executive producers are Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern and Allan Teh. Three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now, Reds, The Last Emperor) will shoot the film, which begins filming this month on location in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nThis marks the second collaboration between Allen and Eisenberg after 2012’s To Rome With Love, as well as Eisenberg’s third onscreen pairing with Stewart after 2009’s Adventureland and this month’s American Ultra. Other Woody Allen vets include Stoll, whose part as Ernest Hemingway in 2011’s hit Midnight in Paris proved a breakout role for him, as well as Posey who plays opposite Joaquin Phoenix in Allen’s current release Irrational Man.\n\n(Photo credit: WENN)"
