        "text": "Woody Allen is the Energizer Bunny of film.\n\nIn the mid-’60s, Allen bought a Japanese spy movie, “International Secret Police: Key of Keys,” removed the voice track and replaced it with a comedy script he had written. He called it “What’s Up, Tiger Lily?” It was his directorial debut.\n\nIn the 50 years since, he’s directed and released almost a movie a year. At 80 years of age, he keeps going and going. He’s won four Oscars and 125 other awards.\n\nWith his simple titles and stars in alphabetical order, he does things his way. Along the way, he’s created several movies that have become landmarks in cinema history.\n\nNot “Café Society.”\n\nAllen’s latest has no biting edge, no surprising wit, no profound observations on the absurdities of life. It’s gentle and thin, with barely enough plot to hold it together.\n\nAllen narrates this movie and his narration often feels “bookish”—as if he’s reading a lavishly-illustrated story. You won’t laugh out loud, or feel an emotional tug at your tear ducts. At best, you’ll smile in amusement or nod in recognition.\n\nBut you will marvel at the rich landscapes, both exterior and interior. In the hands of legendary master cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, the visuals are lavish, from the sun-drenched landscapes of California to the cool underbelly of New York.\n\nThis is a gorgeous movie.\n\nIt’s a rumination on “first love” and a postcard from Hollywood and New York City in the 1930s, a time of indulgence when powerful men were doing things their way.\n\nIn Hollywood, Phil Stern (Steve Carell) is a big-time talent agent, putting together movie deals for the stars. In New York City, Ben Dorfman (Corey Stoll) is a small-time thug, separating annoying people from his life— and from theirs.\n\nBobby (Jesse Eisenberg) is the connecting thread, a young kid from the Bronx. Ben is his brother, Steve his uncle. His options at home are limited. He decides to head west, to see what Uncle Phil can do.\n\nIn Phil’s employ, Bobby falls in love with Vonny (Kristen Stewart), a young secretary who is “already seeing someone.” Still, in the warmth of the California sun, their relationship evolves to a point where they’re planning marriage and a future together.\n\nWhen everything falls apart, Bobby comes home alone to become the host of his brother Ben’s opulent New York nightclub. Bobby’s well-connected and well-respected now, no longer the awkward child-man he was on the West Coast. He’s happy, wealthy, settled.\n\n“And then one evening,” Allen narrates, “in walked the past.”\n\nThis is a story of the enduring power and attraction of a first love, of the choices we make and the paths we follow. It’s the tale of what we trade for what we get, of the ability of “power” to outweigh “potential” and of how we remember what’s too wonderful to forget.\n\nAllen offers no lessons and makes no judgments. He gives us a relationship in progress, shows us the beginning and middle, then leaves the end to our imagination.\n\nWhile Allen often writes his lead character as his alter ego, complete with nervous tics and a way with wry remarks, he mostly avoids that here. Eisenberg plays Bobby as a naïve, curious-but settled down young man, perceptive in his observations, respectful in his interactions.\n\nBut he’s also somewhat bland, boring and predictable. His character never quite engages our empathy or holds our interest; he never fully emerges from the background.\n\nCarell makes Stern glib and gracious, but never completely present. Both the actor and his character seem numb in the role.\n\nStewart is the revelation. With minimal makeup and mousy hair, she shines as Vonny. We feel her honesty, her joy, her pain. She’s a woman struggling to be happy with the choices she’s made.\n\nEven at 96 minutes, “Café Society” often feels long, draggy and talky. In a call home to his family from Hollywood, Bobby says, “I’m kind of half-bored, half-fascinated.”\n\nHe could be talking about this movie."
