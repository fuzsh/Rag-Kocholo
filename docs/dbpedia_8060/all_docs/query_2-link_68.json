        "text": "FILM REVIEW\n\n'Cafe Society'\n\n3.5 stars (out of 4)\n\nMPAA rating: PG-13 for some violence, a drug reference, suggestive material and smoking\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nCast: Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Steve Carell, Corey Stoll\n\nRun time: 96 minutes\n\nIn Woody Allen's Los Angeles, swimming pools are just mirrors reflecting the superficial beauty of the people standing near them, shimmering centerpieces for parties attended by the well-moneyed movie-business elite, wearing crisp tuxedos and glitzy evening gowns. Does anyone actually swim in them? Surely, you jest.\n\nAnd yet, the light reflects off them with celestial beauty in \"Cafe Society.\" Allen's latest dramatic comedy uses a sumptuously photographed 1930s Hollywood as the backdrop for his typical high-strung deliberations on love, ever so fickle, peppered with existentialism, ever so chilly. The filmmaker romanticizes the city and era's palatial movie houses, showing \"The Woman in Red\" and \"Swing Time\" on their screens. The city's history would be all downhill from there, per Allen - you'll recall \"Annie Hall,\" where the marquees of the late '70s featured \"House of Exorcism\" and \"Messiah of Evil.\"\n\nJesse Eisenberg plays the Allen archetype - you know, a Jewish New Yorker, jittery, culturally adroit, neurotic, wears his heart on his sleeve, self-aware almost to a fault. His card should read \"Bobby Dorfman from the Bronx,\" and to refer to him as anything other than \"Bobby Dorfman from the Bronx\" feels like a mistake, but for brevity's sake, I'll hereby call him just Bobby. The young 20-something arrives in L.A. in search of himself and maybe a career. He knocks on the door of his big-shot movie-producer uncle, Phil Stern (Steve Carell), to beg for a job. But Phil is so important, he keeps bumping their meeting further down the calendar.\n\nAfter three weeks, Phil finally gives Bobby \"some cockamamie title\" and a menial odd-job gig, which mostly requires driving to Beverly Hills mansions and dropping off manila envelopes. \"We don't want to overemphasize the nepotism,\" Phil says. Phil assigns his secretary, Vonnie, to show his nephew the ropes. She's played by Kristen Stewart with effortless charm, and a portion of the film's Hollywood glow emanates from her sweetheart performance. All the easier for us to comprehend why Bobby falls in love with her, as she leans on a behemoth convertible automobile in a midriff-bearing outfit, lightly bemoaning Hollywood phonies. She's an Allen ideal.\n\nIt's no spoiler to reveal Vonnie's secret affair with Phil, a married family man. Scandal brews. \"I just hate the duplicity of this,\" she says, clearly a character in a Woody Allen movie. As opposed to a character in most any other romantic comedy, who would be contrived in a more stereotypically corny manner, and likely say something forgettable.\n\nAs Bobby nervously, but also confidently, makes some headway in the movie business and with Vonnie - if he didn't invite her back to his place to listen to jazz records and comically gripe about Hollywood superficialities, he wouldn't be an Allen protagonist - the filmmaker frequently cuts back to the Dorfman family in New York. Bobby's brother, Ben (Corey Stoll), is a ruthless, fedora'd gangster who negotiates with a club owner by eventually depositing the body in a rapidly solidifying building foundation. This isn't just a narrative dalliance; Bobby eventually will be prompted to return home and run his brother's nightclub, where he becomes a man whose name everyone in the social scene knows.\n\nAllen cultivates some uncomfortable comedy as the Dorfmans look the other way regarding Ben's thuggery, a parallel to Bobby's broken-hearted melancholy. He also contrives a second Vonnie, who prefers the formalist Veronica, for Bobby. She's played by Blake Lively, whose effervescence underscores how sparsely written the character is, and we yearn for the underrated actress to enjoy more nuance and screen time.\n\nSari Lennick stands out as Bobby's schoolteacher sister, Evelyn, who somewhat reluctantly calls upon Ben to confront her obnoxious-drunk neighbor, and Parker Posey enjoys a few colorful flourishes as Rad Taylor, head of a New York fashion agency. Compared to the supporting troupe, Eisenberg's performance is a touch bland, perhaps a too-familiar Allen lead. But \"Cafe Society\" sets its hook deeper in the final act, where the story gradually becomes saturated with intense longing and regret - an emphasis Allen might not have made earlier in his career. He also floats the truth that people change, for better or for worse, sometimes unexpectedly or without logic, Allen included. His romanticism for New York is well-documented in his body of work, but here, he clearly enjoys rendering Los Angeles as a beautiful place, as likely to propagate love as any. Such is his quiet progression."
