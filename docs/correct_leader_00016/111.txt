Biography[]

Wilfrid Laurier was born in Saint-Lin, Canada in 1841, and he obtained a law degree from McGill University in 1864, eventually settling in Arthabaska, Quebec, where he edited a newspaper. A Liberal member of the Quebec legislature from 1871, he soon dropped his early opposition to Canadian unity, and was elected to the national parliament in 1874. There he became the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, and in 1877 became Minister of Inland Revenue. In 1885, he led abortive protests against the execution of the Metis leader Louis Riel, which particularly excited French Canadian opinion and led many Quebec Conservatives to swing their allegiance to his Liberal Party. As Liberal leader from 1887, he gradually built up a national and cohesive party, whose loss in the 1891 elections was due to his advocacy of favorable terms of trade with the United States. Despite his subsequent reputation for being pro-US and anti-British, he won the next elections and began a period in office marked by his pragmatic ability for making compromises whenever necessary, and exercising authority wherever possible.
