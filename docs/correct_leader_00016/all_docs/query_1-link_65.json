        "text": "Canadian Resistance\n\nEnglish Canadians feared this wave of immigration. The newcomers were unfamiliar with the English language and local cultural habits. Many Canadians demanded the establishment of an assimilationist policy to form a united, uniform nation.\n\nFrench Canadians, on the other hand, feared being assimilated by an increasing number of Anglophones. They feared for their religion and their culture. In some regions, the newcomers reduced the proportion of Francophones and increased the possibility of assimilation.\n\nFrom Laurier’s perspective, this influx of immigrants could only be beneficial for Canada’s development. He was quick to understand that population growth would lead inevitably to greater economic development and increased production.\n\nFor Laurier, this wave of immigration also offset the massive emigration of French Canadians to New England in search of work in factories. Laurier was very much aware of the situation.\n\n“I would have wanted emigration from Canada, from the province of Quebec, to have gone toward the Western provinces instead of to the United States. There are a million Canadians in the United States; they should be in the new provinces.” – Wilfrid Laurier"
