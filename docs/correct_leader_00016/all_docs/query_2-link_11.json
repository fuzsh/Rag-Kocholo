        "text": "Wilfrid Laurier Marries\n\nWilfrid Laurier married Zoé Lafontaine in Montréal. The marriage was almost not to be. Laurier left Montréal for health reasons, thinking he had tuberculosis. Lafontaine began to see another man, planning to marry him. Laurier returned, learned he was not tubercular and rushed to see Lafontaine. They married that night.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nLouis Riel Hanged\n\nLouis Riel was hanged for treason at the Regina jail. He had been convicted after a trial held in Regina from 28 July to 1 August. Macdonald's refusal to grant leniency made Riel a symbol of English-Canadian oppression.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nLiberal Victory, Laurier PM\n\nIn the federal election, the Liberals defeated the Conservatives with 118 seats to 88. Wilfrid Laurier became Canada's first French-Canadian prime minister and marked a turning point in Canadian politics after years of Conservative Party rule.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nAlberta and Saskatchewan Become Provinces\n\nAlberta and Saskatchewan entered Canada as the 8th and 9th provinces by two federal Acts which received royal assent on 20 July. Alberta's boundary with Saskatchewan was set at 110°, though Albertans wanted 107°. The Acts (Autonomy Bills) declared that the West was to have non-denominational schools.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nVancouver Exhibition Opens\n\nThe Vancouver Exhibition (now Pacific National Exhibition) opened to the public for the first time. PM Wilfrid Laurier presided over the official opening on August 16.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nConservatives Back in Power\n\nIn a federal election, the Conservatives under Robert Borden's leadership returned to power, winning 133 seats to the Liberals' 86. Laurier's Liberals had been in power since 1896. The election was a defeat for the Liberals' policy of free trade.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier\n\nCanada and Newfoundland Enter the First World War\n\nAfter Britain’s ultimatum to Germany to withdraw its army from Belgium expires at midnight on the third, the British government declares war on Germany the next day. As dominions of the British Empire, Canada and Newfoundland are also at war."
