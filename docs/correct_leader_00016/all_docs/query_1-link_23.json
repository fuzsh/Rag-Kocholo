Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier was the first French-Canadian prime minister of the Dominion of Canada, noted especially for his attempts to define the role of French Canada in the federal state and to define Canada’s relations to Great Britain.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Wilfrid Laurier or alternatively, you can download our 23-page Wilfrid Laurier worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nAEDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER\n\nWilfrid was born in Saint-Lin, Canada East (Saint-Lin- Laurentides, Quebec), on November 20, 1841 and the second child of Carolus Laurier and Marcelle Martineau.\n\nHe studied at the college at l’Assomption, an educational institution ran by Catholic priests. Wilfrid then finished his law studies at McGill University in 1864.\n\nInspired by his prior exposure to political environment through his membership in Institut Canadien, Wilfrid spent his first few years in law practice with leading Rouge politicians. He also contributed a number of articles to radical newspapers voicing out his political view towards the government.\n\nThrough his newspaper Le Défricheur, he expressed his opposition towards the Confederation.\n\nHe argued that that French Canadians would be politically overwhelmed if the federal government would be granted more political control.\n\nIn 1871, his political endeavor began after being elected in bench of the provincial legislature of Quebec.\n\nThree years later, he resigned from his provincial seat to run for election to the House of Commons. He obtained a seat and of which he was to be a member until his death.\n\nIn 1877 to 1878, Laurier was appointed minister of inland revenue.\n\nHe gained political fame after trying to intervene against the execution of Manitoba founder and Metis Leader Louis Riel after a rebellion. Although Laurier failed to save his life, he established Riel’s reputation as a man of principle and high ideals.\n\nWith his moderate political approach, Laurier had to face opposition when he was chosen to succeed Edward Blake to lead the Liberal Party.\n\nIn 1887, he eventually led the Liberal party and immediately established political alliance with the United States through unrestricted reciprocity.\n\nAlthough this move was not openly accepted, the Liberal Party won a majority of the seats in Quebec.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1896, Laurier expanded his platform into protecting the Canadian industries, the settlement of the west, and the effective implementation the transportation system.\n\nWhen the Manitoba Liberals established a uniform school system in place of the separate school system, the Catholic minority protested. He did not make a political stance but the public believed he would be supporting the minority.\n\nTaking advantage of the disorganized opposition party: the Conservative government, Laurier led the Liberal party to victory and he was chosen as Prime Minister on June 23, 1896.\n\nPRIME MINISTER\n\nNow a Prime Minister, Laurier focused on country’s development and national unity. Specifically:\n\nSigned the Laurier-Greenway agreement: allowing for instruction in minority languages other than English.\n\nReorganized the immigration system and lowered tariffs but established a protection policy in favor of the government.\n\nActively resisted Great Britain’s political proposals that might eventually commit Canada to defense responsibilities.\n\nPromoted wheat farming and built Canada’s second transcontinental rail system: the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.\n\nApproval of the construction of a third transcontinental line.\n\nOn his next term (1904), he added two new provinces to the Dominion of Canada: Alberta and Saskatchewan. This posed problems because he, once again, compromised the education system and denied a minority group of separate schools.\n\nApproval of the Naval Service Act establishing a Canadian navy of five cruisers and six destroyers ready to fight along Great Britain (his third term in 1908).\n\nReciprocity with the United States: Permitting free trade of natural products; and a limited number of manufactured products.\n\nEND OF TERM AND LEGACY\n\nFollowing so much criticism on many of his latest decisions, Laurier was defeated in the 1911 elections.\n\nHe remained the leader of the opposition and criticized some of the new government’s actions such as the contribution of $35 million to Great Britain to strengthen its navy, and the financial assistance provided to the Canadian Northern Railway.\n\nLaurier died on February 17, 1919.\n\nFor the Canadians, he was revered to have worked for cooperation between French- and English-speaking Canadians for the purpose of national unity while keeping Canada as independent as possible from Britain.\n\nHe served four terms in 1896, 1900, 1904 and 1908, spanning twelve years of prime ministerial leadership.\n\nWilfrid Laurier Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Wilfrid Laurier across 23 in-depth pages.
