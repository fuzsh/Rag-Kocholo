Born in Orangeville, Ontario, and educated at Queen's University, he was awarded his PhD in political economy at the University of Chicago. Due to his extensive academic credentials he was made Dean of Arts at Queen's, a post which he held until 1925. Skelton was a prolific author including biographies of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In 1925, Skelton accepted Prime Minister Mackenzie King's offer to succeed Sir Joseph Pope as Under Secretary of State for External Affairs. He was the principal adviser to the PM and was nicknamed the \"deputy prime minister\". After his death in 1941, he was described by one Canadian historian as the most powerful civil servant in Canadian history.
