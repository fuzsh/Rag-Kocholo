The result was that the Liberals were able to replace the Conservatives as Canada’s dominant national party.\n\nJohn Locke\n\nLiberalism can be traced to John Locke\n\nan industrial bourgeoise ideology, a bid for a share of the power in British aristocracy\n\nLiberalism varied from country to country\n\nat its core, Liberalism is reflected by the notion that man is able to govern himself and control himself, so it is opposed to absolute monarchy and advocates parliamentary or representative government, bound to the rules of law, subscribed to the notion of natural rights (foremost of which is property that includes life and goods)\n\ntended to advocate laissez-faire (minimal governmental involvement in the economy) including free trade at the international level\n\nLiberalism in Government\n\nuntil the 1840s it was kind of an insult to be called a Liberal\n\nmid to late 1860s, the British Liberal Party became well-established\n\nideas carried by the French Revolution\n\nin the United States, liberalism was at the heart of the political culture, e.g. Jacksonian democracy “Equal rights for all, special privilege for none”\n\ndon’t equate liberalism with democracy, not all liberals were democratic, e.g. they did not all support universal suffrage, that only is accepted later\n\nMill\n\nstandard manifesto of human rights\n\nThe Canadian Case\n\nliberalism influenced the reforms, the reaction against the colonial government\n\nargued that the BNA Act entrenched an oligarchy\n\nAmerican Republican ideology influential\n\nMackenzie sympathized with Jacksonian ideal, reflected in demands for elected legislative\n\ncalls for responsible government\n\nlike British liberals, wanted to extend the democratic franchise, wanted to turn appointed positions into elected ones, wanted to inform the constituents and have equal votes\n\nBritish North America class largely subscribing to liberalism\n\nIan MacCae\n\nwrites of the emergence in BNA of “liberal order” that sought to realize the political and economic principles\n\nargues that liberty, equality, property, became the dominant philosophy\n\nargues that liberalism is a secular religion\n\nthe interaction of ideas in liberalism imported from the UK and America\n\nnotes that this was a very highly qualified type of liberalism, champions the cause of the individual, but with limits, e.g. who has a stake in society (those with property, only men, no Aboriginals or Japanese or Chinese…and only some Catholics, only some French)\n\nThe Rise of the Liberal Party\n\nlike the Conservatives, can trace its roots to the Baldwin-Lafontaine union breakdown\n\nClear Grits based out of southwestern Ontario including Toronto, inspired by American liberalism, championed by MacKenzie, challenges the coalition for being too elitist and conservative\n\n“grits” a Masonic term to build a better society\n\nClear Grits especially upset by undue French Catholic influence, so advocated “representation by population”, banking on western Canada being able to dominant eastern Canada based on population growth, in contrast to equal representation for eastern and western Canada\n\nClear Grits protested big business in Montreal\n\nthere were also more moderate reformers led by George Brown, editor of the Toronto Globe, drawn from British liberal tradition, representation by population, supported by Toronto business\n\n“the Rouge” were led by Papineau, members of the professional class of the Canadien population, influenced by French liberal tradition, especially 1848 Revolution, were nationalist Canadien, had favoured BNA’s annexation to the US as a means to Canadien self-government, opposed Confederation which they saw as subjugation of the Canadien, strong anti-clerical\n\nmutual excluding agenda of French and English made it difficult for the party emerge against the Conservatives\n\ncoalition led by George Brown and Antoine Aime-Dorion: the Reformer Liberals, to bring about the confederation, but it broke down\n\nin the first decade of the Confederation there was no Liberal party, simply a grab-back, united only in their opposition against the MacDonald government which was forced to resign from a scandal\n\n1874 the Liberals led by Mackenzie (not William) argued for a more moral, limited, frugal, government, made up of Ontario liberals (inspired by British liberalism) and the Quebec Rouge, which had moderated themselves to accept federalism and the Canada Firsters, a group of independent nationalists who had criticized Macdonald for the coercive means of consolidating Confederation (including William Blake, former Ontario premier) and the Ministerialists, who supported the government only to be on the government’s side of the house, previously supported Macdonald\n\nthe Canada Firsters quickly turned on Mackenzie for not doing enough to strengthen and consolidate the new dominion\n\nthis all prevented emergence of a strong party, no strong cabinet, uncharismatic leader\n\nbut did enact a number of reforms, e.g. new military college, the Supreme Court of Canada, did away with non-simultaneous elections, the secret ballot\n\ntook office in 1874 just as an economic recession began, government took a slower pace in building the railway, BC threatened to separate, by 1878 the coalition is turned out of office\n\ntwo years later, Edward Blake succeeds Alan Mackenzie as leader\n\nstill not a truly national party, still Ontario-oriented, issues still had little attraction outside of Ontario\n\nBlake broke with tradition in a couple key areas: tried to break the anti-Catholic, anti-French sentiment and the support for free trade (went closer to Macdonald)…but still was lacklustre\n\ntook the leadership of Laurier to forge the factions into a party\n\nThe Laurier Liberal Party\n\nLaurier was a former Rouge but his views on liberalism had evolved to espouse British liberalism over American liberalism of the Clear Grits\n\nreflected in his speech in 1877 that responded that denounced the execution of Louis Riel and came to be seen as a better protector of French Canadiens\n\ncontinuing tough economic times in 1880s weakened support for Macdonald\n\nLaurier called for the abandonment of the protectionist tariff and called for free trade, result was the liberal defeat in 1891, for leading Canada into the arms of America, adopted to calling for less restricted trade (ambiguous) and won back power\n\nthey come to power as economic boom begins, Liberals benefit, emerging trans Canada economy, economic nationalism is the one issue amongst with Canadians will rally around, so the Liberals adopt it as their own, back the construction of two new trans continental railways (in addition to the CN), a liberal business alliance based on urban centres, new immigrants voted for Liberals, the party of state building and national consolidation, also successful because they were increasingly able to count on support from Quebec, shed their anti-French heritage in Ontario, reflected in Mowat’s policies in Ontario to benefits Francos and Catholics in Ontario, also benefited from the decline of the Conservative party’s fortunes, able to attract moderate Quebec Conservatives like Chapleau and Tarte, the party of French-English cooperation\n\nthe change of government in 1896 was primarily a change of names rather than of policies or leadership styles, the triumph of liberalism in Canadian political culture, whether liberals associate with either party, all of these individuals espoused classical liberalism from Britain adopted to BNA realities, as long as they continued to represent the rural farmers they were no match for the business-minded Conservatives, Mackenzie had failed because he had not granted enough consessions towards this group, only won with agrarian support, switched their support to the Conservatives and brought them back to power (?)\n\nThe Two-Party System\n\nboth parties were ideologically similar, convergence to the centre, as party became more national it was less likely to take a position that would offend a side, gaining power was contingent on appeasing all\n\nby dawn of 20th century, a two-party system like America’s, where each party seeks the support of all, a state-building party, a party of national consolidation\n\nGetting the Message Out: Politics in the Early Mass Media\n\nMain Arguments:\n\nThe emergence of political parties and the press in Canada were intimately linked. Politicians and parties relied on the partisan press to get their message out, and the partisan press benefited from government and party patronage.\n\nAlthough close, the party-press relationship was conflict-ridden. (Still is.) While the emerging political parties strove to obtain and maintain newspapers that would be their mouthpieces, this was increasingly problematic as newspapers moved to assert their independence.\n\nCanadian political parties and the press were linked by, and owed their parallel rise to the ideological ascendancy of liberalism, however, the implications of liberalism, especially liberal capitalism (e.g. market forces), contributed to the undoing of the Victorian-era relationship between press and party.\n\nGreavance\n\nOutline:\n\nThe Party-Press Relationship up to Confederation\n\nThe Party-Press Relationship after Confederation\n\nEvaluating the Party-Press Relationship: The Significance of Patronage\n\nEvaluating the Party-Press Relationship: The role of Party Organs\n\nConclusion\n\nUp to Confederation\n\nby 1858, the province of Canada was served by 20 daily newspapers, 18 tri-weekly newspapers, 15 semi-weekly newspapers, and 156 weekly newspapers (a lot!)\n\nthe sole medium of mass communication\n\neditors frequently found themselves catapulted in political careers\n\npoliticians frequently found it necessary to become owners of papers\n\nhow many politicians got their start in journalism? included William Lyon Mackenzie and George Brown (founder of the Toronto Globe, which became the voice of the Clear Grits) and Alexander Mackenzie and Wilfrid Laurier\n\nthe newspaper provided politicians with political education, organization\n\ngrowing importance that politicians attached to newspaper support is evident in the increasing funds spent on newspapers and printers, 1/5 of government spending in pre-Confederation Canada, an important source of revenue that encouraged close cooperation between the parties and press\n\nthis accomplished 3 important tasks:\n\ncreated a communication system that could tie together local supporters, keep them informed, essential to party cohesion\n\npropaganda instruments, boosting party leaders and their policies\n\nendless critique of a party’s opposition, a means to build up and a means to put down\n\nAfter Confederation\n\npartisan papers defined the party line, advertised for the party, and for the emerging party system\n\nan uneasy institutional marriage\n\nin the mid 1880s, 37 weekly and daily papers went to the PMO\n\nschmoozing, flattering, patronage towards the journalists\n\njournalists were power brokers, clients and bosses\n\nBrenton McNabe claimed his active political work on the Conservatives was integral to his journalistic duties, they were one and the same, one fed the other\n\nadopting a party name gave a paper instant readership\n\npartisan politics was just another complication that had to be dealt with\n\ndominance of the partisan press\n\nmost centres had both a Liberal and a Conservative paper\n\nonly 6 newspapers were allegedly independent\n\nthe strength of the partisan press suggests that 19th century newspapers were the handmaidens of political parties\n\nfear and greed\n\nbut don’t overstate matters\n\nthe partisan stance of many newspapers was often little more than a marketing strategy\n\nthere are too many examples of allegedly partisan newspapers of criticizing the parties to whom they were supposedly subordinate to make the claim that they were subordinate\n\nThe Significance of Patronage\n\nthe political operators?\n\nnewspapers continued to receive subsidization after Confederation\n\nparties punished and rewarded their enemies and friends\n\nin 1880, an editorial denied that subsidization meant subservience, because the rising operating costs of an urban daily newspapers far exceeded any patronage obtained from the government\n\nin the years that followed, evolution\n\npapers service a commercial market and cannot survive on patronage alone, e.g. management important\n\nsignificant patronage only a pipedream\n\nthe fact that patronage was declining in the importance in newspapers is seen in the fact that even if the party in power changed, the stripes of the papers didn’t change, they stuck with the original ideology\n\nToronto Mail, a Conservative newspaper, became increasingly assertive, Sir John A. tried to increase funding towards it and then tried to withdraw it but neither technique prevented it from criticizing the Conservatives\n\nthe emerging highly competitive market conditions outweighed the benefits of patronage\n\nchecked the practical control that politicians had over papers\n\ndisappearance of scores of local papers and increase in urban dailies\n\nThe Role of Party Organs\n\ne.g. The Toronto Globe, which had a unique status in the early Liberal Party by serving as the mouthpiece of the Clear Grits\n\nClear Grits “the party of the newspaper” (shows how great the paper was)\n\ne.g. The Montreal Gazette championed the cause of McDonald’s Conservatives\n\nEdward Blake went to extreme lengths to preserve the Toronto Tribune with the aim of making it court the Catholic vote in Ontario\n\nensures a party voice during elections\n\nin Saskatchewan, the provincial Liberal government of Thomas Scott established a German language paper, the Saskatchewan Courier, to court to Germans (second-largest immigrant group) to the Liberals\n\nin Quebec in 1880, Wilfred Laurier established L’Electeur (later Le Soleil) and financially backed it, issued almost daily directions, had control over its editorial policy\n\nLa Patrie taken over by a Liberal Minister\n\nLe Canada established by the Liberals as a mouthpiece in Quebec\n\nLa Press established by the Conservatives\n\nWilliam Lyon McKenzie King tried to establish a paper in Ottawa but failed, showing that the concept of the party organ (which oversimplifies a complex relationship between parties and press) was over\n\nthey sponsored newspapers, they gave patronage, they retained control over editorial policies\n\nafter 1880, only the Toronto Empire was an organ, no other paper in Ontario that filled the profile:\n\nin the hands of a few politicians\n\nregular and direct intervention in the editorial policy by the party\n\ncomplete financial dependence on the political party\n\nThe Undoing\n\nexercising a more independent role\n\nresisted by the politicians\n\nconcept of party organ implies a degree of centralization and resources on the part of the parties that in reality did not exist at this time\n\ndifficulties that both parties had in maintaining a party organ in the Toronto market, seen in effort to control the Toronto Mail, the Toronto Empire (in course pack)\n\ngrowing ideas of professionalism and the dictates of Liberal capitalism were seriously diminishing the scope and value of partisanship\n\neditors came to resent the image that politicians were subservient\n\nresult is a deterioration between the Toronto Globe and the Liberal Party\n\nToronto Evening Star (becomes the Star) was to be the new Liberal Party organ\n\nefforts by political parties to ensure reliable mouthpieces in the media were in fact declining, costs outweighed benefits\n\nthe only way that political parties could retain their influence was if that newspaper was not commercially successful (i.e. nobody was reading it and it needed cash)\n\nthis ran counter to the principle of a party getting involved in a newspaper, it would be pointless if no one was reading it, even if circulation increased, the importance of the funds they were getting declined in the ratio\n\nalso problematic for the continuation of party organs was the evolution of the newspaper business, the number of dailies had peaked, rising costs of running one, intense competition, urban markets could no longer support multiple papers and small communities could not even support one\n\nevolved from being an advantage to a disadvantage\n\npapers needed to be non-partisan, if there’s a limited number of readers, you need to broaden your circulation, to remain partisan denied growth\n\nalso related was an increasing professionalization of the newspaper business, a separation between the journalists\n\nas a result, the partisan nature of the Canadian newspaper business began to decline\n\nCanada’s political parties did not have the resources to prevent this\n\nthe leadership of the two political parties was isolated, one less means by which to get their message out, they were now denied a primary vehicle of communication\n\nultimately this disruption of the Victorian era relationship contributed to the organizational weakness of the two national parties\n\nit also undermined electoral support, lost the propaganda machine\n\n“Not Won by Prayers Alone”: The Patronage System\n\nIt is impossible to understand the emergence, consolidation, and functioning of Canadian political parties without examining the role of patronage. The two national political parties relied on patronage to expand and strengthen their presence throughout the Dominion. In so doing, patronage became an important vehicle of national integration.\n\nThe close ties between political parties and the business sector were reflective of the centrality of patronage in helping spread and establish the liberal project in Canada, but also led to a number of scandals.\n\nWhile patronage served an integrative function in terms of both political parties and Confederation, it also (paradoxically) reinforced parochialism and led to the neglect of crucial issues about the nature and operation of the Confederation project. Increasingly, the patronage system could not be sustained in the face of Canada’s linguistic and regional cleavages, and the country’s socio-economic evolution.\n\nBackground and Patronage in BNA\n\nwhat is patronage?\n\ne.g. Walpole using appointments to organize core supporters in British parliament\n\nAndrew Jackson did away with permanent positions and introduced the concept of turnover to democratize the civil service and avoid entrenched corruption, known as Jacksonian Democracy, contrasts to the Canadian case, lead to the “spoils system” and the emergence of the phrase “to the victor belong the spoils”, allowed Jackson to organize his supporters and reward them with public office appointments\n\nin BNA at the heart of responsible government debates, who should control patronage, the transfer of patronage from those who wielded it to those who wanted it, gaining access to the spoils of power, encourage participation in emerging party system, if you want something accomplished (political favour) you have to go to the party in power, a sword of revenge against political opponents, a threat to keep supporters in line, the result was that the spoils system was introduced in the BNA civil service, patronage became the guiding principle of civil service appointments, party loyalty, little concern for efficiency\n\nin the 1850s/60s there was no party staying in office long enough to benefit from the potential of patronage\n\nPatronage in the Age of McDonald – National Integration and National Scandals\n\nConfederation created a bonanza of patronage\n\nevery province was going to obtain or retain (ON, QC) its own legislature\n\nin addition, a whole new level of government, the national legislation\n\nwhole new slew of appointments\n\nadditionally vast new public works projects (to purchase the support of voters), e.g. transcontinental railway\n\nConservative Party was in power first, had access to the spoils of power, could consolidate its position and expand its support, explains why the Conservatives emerged first, Macdonald was a master in the art of patronage\n\nafter 1867 election, Nova Scotia sent nearly all anti-Confederation MPs to Ottawa, but Macdonald wooed them all, a cabinet seat for Joseph Howe, converted to the Conservative cause and Confederation\n\nbenefits flow exclusively from loyalty to the Conservative Party\n\npeople take care of what takes care of them\n\non the ground, Macdonald’s own riding of Kingston, patronage distributed in bureaucratic fashion, local party workers evaluated and recommended to the MP (Macdonald) for appointment based on service, an employment agency\n\nsystem deliberately excluded outsiders in terms of geography and partisanship\n\npatronage given only to local figures who could prove their loyalty\n\noperated at all levels: judgeships and other senior appointments\n\nMacdonald thought politically neutral civil service was naïve, outdated\n\ncivil service colonized by the political party\n\nGomery Inquiry: interest of national unity, convergence of interests, scandal and corruption\n\nneed for money\n\nkickback: a company or individual who has received a contract will automatically give back a percentage of the earnings to the party\n\nbusiness-political symbiosis, business gain and political profit\n\nat the heart of the emergence and dominance of Liberalism\n\nlike the press-party relationship, difficult to say who was the patron (boss) and client in the relationship because each side had power over the other, each side had the ability to punish and reward, each side exploited the other’s needs and abilities to advance their own interests\n\nThe Pacific Scandal, 1872-74: two rival business groups made a bid to build the Canadian Pacific Railway, one from Toronto and one from Montreal, enormous project, Macdonald holds off on a decision until after the election so he could hit up both consortiums for a donation, after 1872 he forced them to conglomerate, Americans were forced out, and in anger made public the details of what had gone on, Conservatives forced out of office and Mackenzie came to power\n\nFrom Mackenzie to Laurier\n\nMackenzie never understood Macdonald’s patronage\n\na failure as a politician because he was not a good practitioner of the art of patronage\n\ne.g. Mackenzie refused to purge the civil service of the Conservative’s appointees\n\nas a clear Grit he stood for reform\n\nclash between reality and values\n\nMackenzie annoyed and alienated his supporters who did not have access to the spoils of power because he was too honest\n\nhe occasionally gave into the pressure of party members\n\nthe result of his ambivalence was that the Liberals failed to establish themselves with a national presence and they lost the next election\n\nonly under Laurier when the Liberals adopted the same principles as the Conservatives in terms of patronage that they emerged as a national party\n\nremarkable similarity between how the system worked under Macdonald and Laurier\n\nunder Laurier, patronage minister to Quebec (?) Israel Tarte coined the phrase “Elections are not won by prayers alone”\n\nuse of patronage with economic boom in the West established the party in the West\n\nintegrate newcomers into the political system, specifically the Liberals, e.g. rural communities in the Prairies\n\npatronage system extended to the provinces, e.g Ontario under Mowat\n\nThe Civil Service and Reform\n\nthe Canadian case was the worst of all possible outcomes in a sense: in the US, you have at the heart an aversion to government; and in the UK, patronage appointments increasingly passed to a more independent civil services and it is less of an organizing principle in contrast to emerging ideologies like the rise of the Labour Party; but in Canada you have an active government involved in economic development with two parties without ideological differences driving them, all that remains is patronage\n\nthe civil service is a stable career, you need ties to a political party to get there\n\nreform was a long time coming\n\ncivil service reform became an issue in the US after the assassination of Garfield by a man disappointed by his lack of patronage appointment, list drafted of civil service jobs whose applicants had to be examined, UK did the same thing\n\nRoyal Commission investigated civil service three times, drew attention to the evil of patronage and recommended reforms, some were adopted but they were piecemeal and easily bypassed, political parties saw patronage as crucial to their operations and were unwilling to give it up\n\nAmerican criticism of the spoil system influenced Canadian thinkers as did the British example especially by Loyalists to the Empire\n\ngrowing pressure also result of scandals\n\nin 1907, the Conservative leader Robert Borden presented the Halifax Program which proposed the curtailing and in some cases ending of patronage, he was not a fan of party politics, thought patronage was a distraction, proposed that the civil service be professionalized, examination for civil service posts\n\nCivil Service Amendment Act 1908 adopted by Laurier, more impressive on paper, only a few cosmetic reforms\n\ndespite Borden’s misgivings, in 1911, he was elected and did not dispose of the tool because party argued it was essential, led to tension within the party\n\ndid not really end until the War, the War Effort called for efficiency, the patronage system was undermined, the formation of the Union Government in 1917 was a coalition of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals, aspired to non-partisanship and the effective war effort, patronage under attack\n\nUnion created new rules including sharing the spoils, civil service depoliticized by the Civil Service Act of 1918 which cut the legs out from under patronage, this was the beginning, it curtailed the use of patronage in what had been a wide-open area\n\nconversely it helped to increase patronage at the provincial level because there were no reforms made there\n\nLegacy\n\non the one hand, it helped to create and maintain political stability which was essential for the success of Confederation\n\nfor a long time it helped parties to attract and remain supporters, solid base\n\nconsistent with Allan Gordon in the course pack\n\nnational parties united by patronage used by leaders to run their electoral machines and break down local interests and integrate them into the Canadian system\n\nparties were not representative of a region or religion or creed, they expanded to serve all\n\nthis achievement is somewhat deceiving\n\nreciprocal arrangement between politics and business undermines Gordon’s theory\n\nentrenched a political culture which was designed to neglect problems of cleavages, it encouraged the persistence of localism in a way, patronage made every local political organization jealous of its territory and suspicious of outsiders, created hard-working local constituency organizations linked to Ottawa but divided outsiders, more interested in their ridings and the patronage dispensed there\n\ninternal domestic peace\n\navoidance of serious debate on issues that fundamentally divided Canadians like linguistic debates\n\nsystem of buying off support was convenient for politics but not Canada\n\nas project of national integration continued, the parties that had used the benefits of the patronage system were increasingly unable to use patronage to mend political cleavages\n\npatronage was its greatest strength and its greatest weakness of the post-Confederation party system\n\nWomen’s Suffrage\n\nWomen as political beings before suffrage\n\nThe suffrage campaign\n\nWhat happened in Quebec\n\nEnfranchisement/Suffrage – the right to vote\n\nCitizenship – rights, responsibilities, obligations, identity\n\nBefore Women had the Right to Vote (1880-1940)\n\nstill considered themselves citizens\n\nsuffrage debate began in WWI\n\ndidn’t emerge out of nowhere\n\nwomen were political actors, activists even before they had the formal right to vote\n\nan action becomes political if the intention is to use any form of power to govern, shape, reform the society in which you live\n\nshe studied 12 womyn in Montreal of the upper class (resource-rich)\n\ntransition was from a very private, enclosed sphere to a much more public sphere while insisting in the rhetoric of the day\n\none discourse was the idea of separate spheres (public and private) in parallel with the idea that men and womyn have different natures and so exist in a particular sphere, e.g. womyn are naturally maternal and moral so they raise the family at home\n\nwomyn used the maternalist discourse to launch themselves out of the private sphere, said they had talents and natural abilities that men didn’t\n\nat this time Canada had urban slums, rising infant mortality…womyn used this argument to argue that womyn were needed to “mother” society\n\nwe think of it as an equal rights campaign but this was not always the argument used\n\nwomyn’s involvement in charity in Canada took off in the early to mid 19th century, a religious task, moral, a safe way for womyn to fill their spare time\n\nsome people are double-dipping, some people are being missed, some people aren’t being helped by it, talk about how to improve the system\n\ncharity was impulsive and unorganized (giving money on the street) whereas philanthropy was well thought out, got to the root of the problem (matching skills to jobs)\n\n1893: World Fair in Chicago, a model of a modern city, industrialization will lead to great things, for the first time there was a womyn’s pavilion, womyn were involved in all kinds of aspects of the Fair, first meeting of the International Council of Womyn, all female visitors were invited to hear its vision of womyn being a powerful force\n\nseveral Canadians at this meeting went home very fired up\n\ncoincides with the arrival of a new Governor General whose wife was very powerful and active, went on a trip across Canada, energetic, was the president of the International Council of Womyn, got the National Council of the Womyn of Canada underway\n\nthe Council was an umbrella organization\n\nshows that womyn saw themselves as citizens, as political actors, who wanted to take part in the development of Canadian society\n\na philanthropic organization that became political\n\none problem was how womyn were being treated in the factories, brought to the attention of the Council, which set up a committee to study it by going into the factories and speaking with the womyn and the managers and experts, decided womyn should have a minimum wage, limited hours, should have stools to sit on, etc. but the big idea was womyn factory inspectors\n\ncan’t have a bill introduced in parliament\n\nstrategy: invite MPs to dinner or tea and bring up the issue, organize public events like Harvard experts to speak about the issue, held meetings with premiers, were successful\n\nthis is a joint anglo-franco effort before WWI, the elite middle class learned both languages\n\nthey’re gaining political experience and support networks\n\npower in numbers\n\nBeginning of the Suffrage Movement\n\nboring relative to the British movement, had a different shape, these womyn considered themselves ladies and used logical arguments, politicking, press coverage\n\nmost of the womyn did not use an equality argument, actually used mostly the maternalist argument, womyn bring different qualities to society\n\nthe vote was the means to an end, the end being prohibition\n\n1867: property-owning males over the age of 21\n\nToronto Womyn’s Literary Club, 1876, intentionally misleading name, discussion was of how to get the vote, rename themselves the Womyn’s Suffrage Organization and around the turn of the century make their mission known\n\noriginated in large urban centres, e.g. Montreal and Toronto\n\nbut the first places to be successful were small towns and rural settings especially in the Prairies where they got the provincial vote early on under Liberal governments\n\nsome explanations: the Prairies were a place of significant immigration particularly from Nordic countries where womyn already had the right to vote; the frontier mentality, rough living conditions, womyn were in the field working just as hard as the men, sense of equality\n\n1918: womyn get the right to vote in federal elections\n\nas nurses, civilians, factory workers, womyn proved their worth in WWI, they were fighting on the home front, did they part, gained a lot of respect\n\nPM Borden (the Union government) gave them the vote to pass his conscription policy, starting with expanding the franchise to all those effected by the war, e.g. the wives of men who were fighting or who had fought overseas, female nurses\n\nQuebec\n\n1791: the Constitutional Act stated that all land-owning persons were allowed to vote, did not exclude womyn, first place where womyn could vote, until 1849 when it became exclusive\n\nsuffrage movement began in urban centres (Montreal) in contrast to rural Quebec which was more traditional than the rest of Canada, more religious\n\nWWI was a difficult period for anglos and francos\n\n1922: really gets underway, 400 womyn meet with Premiere Tashrow (?), but they were dismissed, he had been presented with a church-organized petition the day before which protested enfranchisement\n\nSt-Jean in 1927 transformed it to a working class phenomenon, made progress in the 30s, until DuPlessis (Union Government), very conservative and traditional, has no time for womyn’s suffrage, gets the Liberals warmed up to the idea\n\n1939: womyn invited to the Liberal convention\n\ncoincides with start of WWII\n\nargument used held that if womyn’s suffrage was endorsed, conscription would pass, and the governments could work together\n\nwhen the Liberals were elected, they granted the right to vote\n\nFrance didn’t grant the right to vote until 1942, after Quebec, French heritage cited as a reason for holding out, in contrast to Britain\n\nJanuary 24, 2007\n\nThe ‘National’ Question on the Eve of Crisis\n\nConference – MacKay article, readings for this week\n\nMain Arguments:\n\nCanada’s two post-Confederation national parties owed their success to bridging the regional and cultural differences between Canadians.\n\nConsistent with the broader international trends of nationalism and imperialism, however, both the Conservatives and the Liberals found it increasingly difficult to bridge Canada’s cleavages.\n\nA series of interrelated disputes throughout the late 19th and early 20th century related to “national integration” and questions regarding Canada’s “national” character undermined the two main political parties and led to the mergence of potential challengers. This was the precursor to the collapse of the post-Confederation party system that would occur during the First World War.\n\nThe National Question: Background\n\nlocal and personal ties were at the heart of traditional, rural, agrarian societies but they began to break down in the context of liberalism, capitalism, industrialization\n\nnationalism replaced it, sense of belonging to a greater collectivity, in a period of profound social upheaval\n\nemerges first culturally: every nation had a distinct language, history, worldview, culture of its own that needed to be preserved\n\nlead to political nationalism: every nation should have a sovereign state, the nation would be governed by members of their own, the cultural expression of a people, the key to survival and success\n\ne.g. unification of Germany, of Italy, the decline of the Austrian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, Irish nationalism, American nationalism and its Civil War in the 19th century\n\nintense territorial competition reflected in colonialism, done on behalf of the nation\n\nCanada desired a separate existence from the States, what was the Canadian nation, two culturally distinct nations living in one state, self determination, nationalism, the concept of a nation-state, how can nations share one state\n\nLafontaine and Baldwin proposed a biracial nation that overcame cultural differences\n\nMacdonald said no party could endure without being “French-ified”\n\nChapleau believed that French-Canadien interests would be best served within Confederation, it is necessary to speak with one voice\n\nLaurier made the Liberal Party the dominant party in Quebec\n\nkeep economic expansion in the forefront of voters’ minds, the one thing that the French and English could agree on, distract the groups from their linguistic and religious differences\n\nhomogenous parties (one religion, one ethnic group) not developed\n\nthe political parties bridge the divides, power machines, don’t necessarily stand for anything\n\nThe Provincial Rights Question\n\nthe relationship between federal and provincial\n\nsystem meant to provide part of the answer to the National question: two levels of government, provincial government to take care of cultural issues and federal government to address state issues\n\nin practice, questions raised immediately about the power relationship between French and English across the country\n\nMacdonald preferred a strong national authority to consolidate Confederation, saw provinces and their bids for power as rivals, his centralizing efforts provoked reactions at the provincial level, reflected in the growing strength of political parties at the provincial level\n\ne.g. Ontario Liberal Party, led by Mowat, considered the father of the provincial rights movement\n\nin the early years, Conservative Party’s dominance in Quebec kept its national ambitions in check\n\nWorldviews Compared: Imperialism, Anti-Imperialism, Nationalism\n\nCanadian Imperialism: centred chiefly in Ontario, advocated reform of Canadian nationalism, goal was independence from the States, best achieved by having strong ties with the British Empire, not in a subordinate status, but as a partnership (equal partners), Canada would be an active contributor to imperial defence and have a saying in the running of the Empire, anglo-centric, Ontario-centric, this ignored French Canada’s desire for autonomy and detest for the Empire\n\nAnti-Imperialism: French and English, said imperialism was at odds with nationalism, couldn’t be reconciled, saw the imperialists as a reactionary remnant of colonial-minded individuals, argue that Canadian imperialism could not be reconciled with independence, largely\n\nNationalisme: French Canadien nationalists, strong commitment to Canada’s defence, Canada was either independent or part of the Empire but not both, concerned about the status and rights of French Canadiens, some were Quebec-centred and some wanted a French presence everywhere, the awareness of being a minority\n\nresult is a series of disputes between these rivalries\n\nThe Northwest Rebellion\n\n1885\n\nrhetoric in English Canada, especially from Ontario Imperialists, treated the rebellion as a test of Canada’s nationhood\n\nMetis cast as enemies of Canada and its control over the northwest\n\nOttawa’s response (execution of Louis Riel) alienated French Canadiens\n\nhalf of Quebec Conservatives either voted in support of or abstained from a motion put forth that condemned the execution\n\nTrudel: “The nation’s duty compels us to break the tradition of the past 20 years”\n\nMercier was a member of the Parti Nationale, an effort to bring together Quebec Conservatives and Quebec Liberals, put the French interest ahead of the party interest, Mercier called for a sacred union between French Canadiens\n\na second Parti Nationale is a provincial party, those who opposed Macdonald’s handling of the Northwest Rebellion, ride a nationalistic wave to victory in the election, in office they were notable because Mercier used it to strongly serve the notion of political autonomy for Quebec, challenge to Ottawa’s authority, but falls from power in 1891 and the Liberals return to power\n\nthe French Canadien nationalist cause endured, the Northwest Rebellion was the beginning of the end for Conservatives, Liberals increasingly had to seemingly favour autonomy for Quebec\n\nthe rise of the Parti Nationale is indicative of growing nationalist tensions between the English and French, who has power, who will lead\n\nLinguistic and Religious Rights (pre-1900)\n\nEqual Rights Association formed (ironically named)\n\nby the 1890s, movements to extinguish French education and linguistic rights outside of Quebec, e.g. Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick\n\nManitoba had been founded on an equal basis, equal government funding for French and English, but migration from southwest Ontario (Clear Grit country) upset the balance, the Liberal government halts funding to Catholic schools\n\nConservative government under pressure to intervene in Manitoba’s government, controversy, accelerated the Conservative Party’s decline in Quebec, helped propel the Liberals into power, able to bridge linguistic/cultural/religious cleavages\n\nLaurier, rather than Ottawa restoring rights, looked at the numbers, pragmatic, provided for instruction and bilingual instruction where the numbers were\n\nLaurier Liberals seized power at the height of these French-English tensions, reinforced by the imperialist world views\n\nThe Boer War and Rise of the Nationalism\n\nimperialist war\n\nFrench Canadiens absolutely opposed\n\nEnglish demanded participation\n\nLaurier’s government at risk of falling, would be replaced by an Imperialist government\n\nhow to offend the least amount of people?\n\nsent only 1000 soldiers to South Africa, but Ottawa will only pay for the transport and clothing, after that Britain picks up the tab\n\nupcoming election\n\ntrying to preserve national union\n\nof course, both sides too it as either “too little” or “too much”\n\nHenri Bourassa was a predominant Liberal critic, accused him of caving, setting a precedent for participation in Britain’s colonial wars, he resigns in protest, but it immediately reelected as a national Liberal, an advocate of French Canadien nationalism and a critic of imperialism, a French Liberal\n\nLaurier re-elected because they were still a better option than the imperialist Conservatives\n\nLinguistic and Religious Rights (post-1900)\n\nLeague Nationalist established, for provincial autonomy (Quebec’s) and make sure that Canada was truly a partnership between French and English\n\na movement, not a party\n\nBourassa not a big fan of parties (the dictates of party discipline)\n\nthe League Nationalist supports independent candidates or party candidates who support their ideals\n\nMacKay\n\ncalls for a reconnaissance rather than a synthesis\n\nnot just particular events, fragments\n\nsense of general patterns\n\ntracing Liberalism from its inception to Neo-Liberalism\n\nLiberalism the dominant ideology by adopting, morphing\n\nconnect the dots to get an idea of what Canadian Liberalism is\n\nthe older approach is simplistic, this would be more sophisticated\n\nGramscian concept of “passive revolution”, e.g. Harper’s announcement of funding for alternative fuels\n\npassive revolution vs. the great Canadian compromise as explanation for Confederation\n\nLiberalism is mostly about individual rights\n\ncivic humanism: organic social order, a competing ideology emerging as the ancien regime was collapsing, popular in the UK, US, France, a concept of the relationship between citizen and society recalling ancient approach, e.g. Greece, rather Conservative with Liberal aspects, hierarchical\n\nThe Suffrage Movement\n\nthe vote not granted out of the goodness of their heart but to preserve the order\n\nLiberal ideology reflected in recognizing women as citizens when they are property owners, originally debated in 1867 or thereabout, but shot down because giving women a voice would undermine married women and possibly prevent marriage altogether\n\nQuebec argued this should be a provincial decision rather than a federally imposed one\n\nmotivated by conscription\n\nArthur Meighen’s quote about giving the vote to women and not alien men show what he judged to be grounds for Canadian civil rights, strategic, strict definition of Liberal individual\n\nthe vote a means to an end\n\npolitical parties as gatekeepers, e.g. Person’s Case\n\nwomen didn’t rush the gate, act as a united force, little discernible change on the ground\n\nLinguistic and Religious Rights (post-1900)\n\nThe Autonomy Bills established Manitoba and Saskatchewan\n\nallowed for separate Catholic schools\n\nbut Laurier retreated under pressure, new legislation severely curtailed linguistic and religious schools\n\nManitoba School Act\n\nBourassa, etc. fuelled their nationalist fire\n\npressure that the Western Liberals imposed and that the Nationalists in Quebec imposed shows that the Laurier government had an even more difficult time bridging Canada’s divides\n\nLaurier Liberal’s difficulties only grew with international developments\n\nThe Naval Debate\n\n1909: Anglo-German rivalry provoked a naval arms crisis\n\nNew Zealand gives UK cash to buy battleships, Australia decides to build its own navy (take care of its own defence in order to relieve pressure on the Brits)\n\nwhat should Canada do?\n\ndebate: assist the British, respond to imperialist sentiment, but now in a way that would anger the Nationalists in Quebec or the imperialists\n\nBorden supported Laurier establishing Canada’s own navy, but leaving the door open to making an emergency cash contribution to the Brits if needed (Australia and New Zealand combined)\n\nbut this bipartisan cooperation evaporated…divisions with the parties and country\n\nBorden faced severe criticism from Conservative imperialists in Ontario who said that ‘This is an emergency, they need money, they have the expertise, let them build the ships’ whereas Canada’s own navy would be inferior\n\nMonk saw both options as entangling Canada in the empire\n\nBorden breaks with Laurier, calls for an immediate cash contribution and a Canadian voice in determining imperial defence and as a way to respond to the anti-imperialists says that Canadians should be able to express their voice on the issue, i.e. a referendum before a permanent policy is adopted\n\nNaval Service Bill, 1910, controversial by imperialist and linguistic lines\n\nEnglish Canada: Laurier’s Navy a betrayal of the imperial cause\n\nFrench Canada: another betrayal of Canada’s self-governance and autonomy, Ottawa doing London’s bidding\n\nBourassa becomes a rival to Laurier’s leadership in French Canada, the pragmatic Laurier to the more doctrine Bourassa\n\nBourassa founded Le Devoir in 1910, mouthpiece for the Nationalist cause\n\nThe Reciprocity Election\n\ncalls for reciprocity and free trade (Laurier has still not delivered)\n\nLiberals go for “restricted reciprocity”: reciprocity in the agriculture sector, but the protectionist tariff to remain in effect for the manufacturing sector, a marrying of the best aspects of the national policy but answering the grievances of rural Canada, America agrees, very popular initially\n\nconcerns about the rate of North America continental integration, what does this mean for the future, especially the relationship with London, how close is the US\n\nunrestricted reciprocity means the American takeover of Canada, trade between Canada and the US (north-south rather than east-west) would reign, national sovereignty undermined\n\n“The Toronto 18”: claimed that they previously supported Laurier, had a vested interest in the national policy, declared they were opposed\n\nClifford Sifton bolted from the Liberals\n\nopponents appealed to a higher principle: imperialism, Laurier was depicted as anti-imperialist and therefore anti-Canadian, that by increasing ties with Americans he was threatening Canada’s independence\n\nSummer 1911: Laurier facing opposition, an obstructionist parliament withholding approval of the legislation, he calls an election\n\nquickly becomes a referendum on the Liberals foreign policy, growing attacks of reciprocity in English Canada\n\na crucial alliance between the imperialists and the anti-imperialists\n\nQuebec Conservative Party was beginning to detach itself from its federal cousins, tied to a party dominated by imperialists, considered anti French-Canadian\n\nan opportunity created because the Quebec Conservatives began to make common cause with the League Nationalist to gain votes in Quebec\n\nBorden begins to think of Bourassa as a possible solution, to Borden the thought was that maybe a joint effort between the imperialists and anti-imperialists could challenge the Liberals\n\nthe Borden Conservatives refused to run candidates again Bourassa’s Nationalists\n\nLiberals vs. Nationalists in Quebec\n\nBourassa wanted to cooperate to defeat Laurier and his naval policy, but this did not mean that he wanted Borden’s naval policy, he wanted to be the kingmaker, deny both the Liberals and the Conservatives a majority, use this leverage to bring about the changes it wanted\n\nbut a Conservative majority is elected, 118 seats, the Nationalists win only 16 seats, far short of the balance of power\n\nlooks like the torch was just passed back again\n\nbut really marks the end of the post-Confederation system, Borden achieved victory through his alliances, but not a solid foundation for a governing coalition in the long run, base still in Protestant Imperialist Ontario\n\nConservatives try to pass their emergency cash contribution, 7 Nationalist Conservatives from Quebec saw this as a betrayal of Canadian self-government, Liberals reenergized, block the legislation that the Conservatives try to pass using their majority in the Senate\n\ngrowing strength of French Canadian nationalism\n\non the eve of WWI, two national parties responsible for Confederation, increasingly victims of the efforts that their actions for consolidation had provoked, victims of the question of Canada’s national identity and destiny, neither party in the position to claim that it was capable of bridging them, events overseas about to heighten the significance of the nationalist question (Empire, power relations between French and English)\n\nespecially aspecially\n\nThe Great War and Crisis in Canada’s Political System\n\nArguments:\n\nConflict abroad caused conflict at home. The wartime clash between imperialist and anti-imperialist worldviews, and accompanying cultural tensions, had far-reaching consequences for Canada’s political parties.\n\nThe Liberal disintegration, the emergence of Union Government, and the results of the 1917 election brought the post-Confederations party system to an end. The relative political stability since 1867, characterized by the lengthy times in power of two inclusive, pragmatic, pan-national parties, disappeared\n\nThe triumph of Unionism represented a victory for the imperialist-nationalist vision for Canada; as such, it ultimately contributed to disunity, owing to the marginalization of French Canada, which had long-term implications for Canadian party politics.\n\nUnion Sacree? Canadian Politics from War’s Outbreak to 1916\n\nLaurier gives his support to the battle cry\n\ncoming from the leader who had consistently preached ‘limited participation’\n\nlike the Boer War and the Naval Debate, it appeared Canada would enter the war, even Bourassa gave his qualified support\n\nthe fact that the cause was just (Germans had betrayed Belgium’s neutrality, Britain was in danger); participation was voluntary (Borden promised conscription would not be enacted); the assumption that the war would be short (over by Christmas); the fact that the national unity within the House of Commons was stronger than outside the House (masked divides)\n\n“Union Sacree” put to the test, as it became clear that the war would not be over by Christmas, increasing pressure from Britain, massive Canadian casualties, voices of dissent, breaking of bipartisan unity, series of patronage scandals to boot\n\ngrowing concerns about the Conservative Party’s fortunes, beyond declining support in Quebec, increasingly unpopular across the country, by the end of 1916 only in control in Ontario\n\nthis prompted Borden to propose the extending of parliament, Laurier agrees to one more year, neither of them wanted to go to the electorate during the war, partisanship only increased, the façade that existed in 1914 collapsed\n\nThe Collapse of the Union\n\nThe Battle over Language\n\nrenewed questions over the power relationship between French and English over war\n\n1912: Ontario government introduced Regulation 17 which severely curtailed the use of French as the language of instruction within Ontario schools, limited the teaching of French to the first two years of primary school, Franco-Ontarians outraged, violation of the Canadian Constitution, the Nationalists supported the Franco-Ontarians, an attempt of assimilation, marginalization\n\nBorden refused a petition that called on Ottawa to disallow this law, said education is a provincial responsibility, the federal government is not going to interfere\n\nmatter brought before the House of Commons, divided along linguistic lines, French Canadians supported the resolution to veto the law\n\nConscription and the Liberal Collapse\n\ncall for 500 000 soldiers from a population of only 8 million\n\nthings not looking good for the Allies\n\nAmericans introduced a draft, put pressure on Borden to do the same, a vital member of the British Empire, but political difficulties like during the Boer War\n\nneeded Liberal support, Laurier’s support, through the formation of a coalition government that could enact conscription\n\nLaurier first rejects the offer on the grounds that by 1917 a Liberal return to power seemed in sight, voters unhappy with the war effort, the one-year extension up, warned that the English population was not fully in favour of conscription anyway, “The voice of Toronto is not the voice of God”\n\nBourassa’s support for the war effort had eroded after Resolution 17\n\nJames Massey criticized Quebec for its low enlistment rates and questioned its commitment to Canada\n\nLaurier does not want to leave the field open to Bourassa, rejects Borden’s offer, asks for the national referendum on the issue, buy him time to build a coalition\n\nduring the Regulation 17 debate the Liberal caucus had split, the Western Liberals voted with the Conservatives while the rest voted with Laurier (Ontario only barely)\n\nJohn Wilson openly supported the Conservatives, wanted them to become the national party of English Canada, only they could be trusted with the future of the country, the British population was the only true Canadian population, an imperialist, Quebec had forfeited their right to the nation\n\nsections of Liberal caucus tired of Laurier’s leadership, argued Canada needed a new liberalism to better respond to industrialization and urbanizaiton, came from Ontario and the West, advocated social programs like old age pensions and employment insurance and womyn’s suffrage and prohibition\n\nLaurier feared these new Liberals were trying to impose a new mode on the Liberal Party, trying to marginalize French Canada, undermine the Liberal claim to being a pan-Canadian national party\n\nMilitary Service Act split the Liberals on linguistic lines, the anglos sided with the government overwhelmingly, only 7 supported Laurier’s call for a referendum on conscription\n\nresult was the Liberals could no longer claim to be a binational party\n\nMPs had more power back then, less whipped\n\nEnglish supported conscription, French opposed it, beginning to see the breakdown of the system, polarization along ethno-linguistic lines\n\nThe Rise of “Unionism”\n\nWhy did it take so long to form a coalition government?\n\n1. Laurier’s bipartisan pledge, no need for coalition, the parties seemed to agree at the onset of the war\n\n2. Self-interest, the Conservatives are in power for the first time since 1896, don’t want to share the spoils of power, on the other side, Laurier was more charismatic than Borden and believed he would overtake them, the Conservative weakness would allow the Liberals to return to power\n\n3. The scope of the crisis was not large in the early years, the war would be over soon\n\nthis had all changed by 1917, concern became how to manage the war effort\n\nthe Ontario caucus of the federal caucus begins to pressure Borden to form a coalition with the “patriotic wing” of the Liberal party\n\nJohn English (historian) describes the establishment of the Union government as the result of the efforts of an English-Canadian nationalizing elite centred from Canada’s urban centres especially Ontario to bind together an increasingly fragmented Canada\n\nmid-October 1917: 12 Conservatives, 9 pro-conscription Liberals form the cabinet\n\n1917 election results: essentially a one-party election, Liberals in Quebec, and the Unionists in the other provinces, but the vote was closer than the seat distribution suggests, Quebec returned anti-conscription Liberals and the rest of Canada returned pro-conscription Unionists\n\nLaurier Liberals were now anti-conscription, largely French-run\n\nneither party could claim to be “national”\n\nWartime Elections Act disenfranchised thousands of immigrants who would likely have voted Liberal and the enfranchisement of womyn was designed to support conscription\n\nMilitary Voters Act allowed for soldiers to vote in any riding, encouraged to case their ballot in close ridings\n\nso the victory goes to the imperialist-nationalist vision of Canada and the Unionist cause\n\nit had already come from within, a marriage of convenience\n\nThe Disunity of Unity\n\ngradual disintegration\n\ndied with Borden’s resignation\n\nnew leader tried to keep up the façade by renaming the party the Liberal-Conservatives\n\nthe national government that Unionism represented ultimately meant the domination by the arrogant majority for too many Canadians\n\nLaurier dies in 1919, Bourassa increasingly seen as depassé\n\nunity is a pipedream\n\nNationalists increasingly focus on the Quebec nation\n\nimplications for the two mainline parties\n\nLaurier’s anti-conscription meant Quebec would stay Liberal\n\nKing was seen as a supporter of Laurier, wins the leadership, but party had been reduced in its seats\n\nby the time the Union government came to an end not one provincial government was controlled by Conservatives\n\nConservatives identified with the unionist, pro-conscription cause by Quebeckers\n\nChallenging the Establishment? Part 1: A Progressive Response\n\nMain Arguments:\n\nThe rise of the Progressives may be understood as the manifestation of a widespread rejection of “politics as usual”, combined with an agrarian reaction, centred especially in (but not limited to) Western Canada, against the national political and economic system build by the Conservatives and Liberals;\n\nThe Progressive Party’s greatest strength was in a sense its greatest weakness: its populist, mass-based origins, meant it ultimately failed as a party, due to its divisions among its members over its raison d’etre and its role in the system of Canadian party politics, against which it was reacting;\n\nThe legacy of the Progressive Party, however, lived on in terms of encouraging the two traditional parties to be more democratic. Even more significantly, the rejection of “politics as usual” and sectional discontent would re-emerge in the 1930s and beyond in new challengers to the Liberals and Conservatives, confirming the demise of the post-Confederation two-party system.\n\nThe “Progressive” Challenge to Party Politics\n\nthe League Nationalist is an example of a popular mass-based approached, the emergence of extra-parliamentary parties\n\nthe reaction of groups and individuals against the national establishment, e.g. womyn’s attempt to gain power in the political system and the competition between English and French Canadians\n\nunderstand that this is the product of disillusionment with the existing political order, embodied with the demand for reform\n\nAmerican Progressives strongly opposed corruption, called for political reform, believed that the status quo was corrupting democracy, efforts to reduce the power of political machines and party bosses through innovations of direct democracy, e.g. the recall, the initiative, primary elections\n\nCanadians saw government as advancing the interests of the party and its friends, not the national cause, inspired by Americans, wanted greater control over their representatives and greater input\n\nCanadian Council for Agriculture called for the public ownership of utilities, graduated income taxes, Senate reform, direct democracy, and proportional representation in 1916\n\nmovement seen in number of independent candidates in Saskatchewan’s provincial election in 1912 which increased threefold\n\nNPL wanted representatives to be accountable to their constituents\n\n1913: WJ Rutherford called for a new political party that would make politics “a holy thing” in Canada\n\npeople disenchanted with the two-party system\n\nCanada becoming more urbanizae\n\nBorden\n\nseen as a bit of an outsider, from Nova Scotia, felt politics as usual was not working, didn’t want to be dominated by the Conservatives\n\nreached out to the progressives to build a new coalition, e.g. the suffragists\n\npragmatism, compromise, moral order the new way\n\nUnion government argued that is embodied all interests, no need for another party\n\nJohn English (historian) argued that Borden saw unionism as more than a political party, it was a political movement, popularly based, to lead to a non-partisan upheaval of the way politics was done\n\npromised to abolish patronage\n\nThe Agrarian Revolt and Western Discontent\n\nthe rise of the Progressive Party was also a reaction, a sectional revolt\n\nthe other part of the explanation for its rise\n\nAmerican farmers had revolted, felt that the two parties were not responding to their needs, lead to the establishment of the American Populist Party\n\nin the decade after WWI, farmer’s parties established in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, sense that the rural community was being marginalized in rural life\n\npoliticians of Canada envisioned the West as the hinterland of Toronto and the East as the hinterland of Montreal\n\nWestern settlers who purchased land from the Canada Northwest Land Company, purchased tools from another company that was also protected by the government, higher costs\n\nNational Policy tariff\n\neconomically subservient condition combined with the precarious conditions of the wheat economy fuelled resentment, Western Canada’s needs ignored, kept in a state of dependence\n\ndemocratic wakeup: settlers arriving in Alberta are predominantly Americans who experienced the agrarian revolt there, Jacksonian Democracy; in Saskatchewan the settlers are predominantly Brits who experienced uprisings; in Manitoba they are south-western Ontarians where the notion of agrarian democracy is well advanced through the Clear Grit ideas\n\nthis contrasts to the East, which was more Whig-ish\n\nWestern discontent growing as debt of farmers increasing, the low international price of wheat not increasing as quickly as manufactured goods, Liberals not moving on reciprocity (which they wanted: free access to the American market and cheaper goods through free trade or freer trade)\n\nfarmers began to organize, inspired by the American example\n\n1905: first farmer’s grain market established\n\n1911: Western concerns on the national agenda, seemingly, after Laurier toured and saw how angry farmers were, Liberals finally move on reciprocity, but they were subsequently defeated\n\nfarmer’s influence seen as waning, they are marginalized, central big business dominates\n\nthis increased during the war, Westerners initially hoped that the Union government would be more national, end patronage, show democracy, the promise that conscription would not be applicable to farmers (food an essential part of the war effort)\n\ncouple months after election Germans have a breakthrough on the Western front, crisis, Unionist government revokes the exemptions granted to rural Canadians, 1918\n\nand still no action on the tariff, if anything it was increased to help the war effort\n\nand thousands of farmers had been disenfranchised by the Wartimes Election Act\n\nat the end of the war, drought hits the West, especially southern Alberta and at the same time wheat prices collapse, so they are harvesting less wheat and getting less money for it\n\nrapid post-war inflation, costs of living and doing business increasing\n\ntariff issue takes on even greater resonance\n\n“The New National Policy” – calls for free trade with the UK and US\n\nUnion government caught in the middle, opted to delay any action on the tariff\n\nThomas A. Crearar, Western Liberal, resigned over it\n\nresult an emerging third-party challenge\n\nThe Farmers United: The Provincial Level\n\nrural Ontario furious at the revocation of the conscription exemption and its seeming declining influence in provincial politics\n\nUFO established, United Farmers of Ontario, with the United Farm Womyn and United Farm Young People\n\nOct 1919: UFO wins the most seats in Ontario, builds a coalition with labour members, under the leadership of E.C. Drury (from Barrie!?) forms a government\n\nUnited Farmers of Alberta MP wins in a provincial bi-election\n\nUF of Manitoba allows its members to organize, win a plurality of seats in the next election\n\nSaskatchewan Liberals closely ally with the Sask grain growers association\n\nHenry Wise Wood, UFA leader, feared losing control of it, just wanted it to be a pressure group to lobby the parties not a political party itself, but under pressure agrees to run some candidates, groups to elect representatives rather than individuals, e.g. lawyers and farmers elect representatives, only farmers can be elected by the UFA, they sweep to power, but Wood refuses to lead the party, doesn’t want to be personally involved in politics\n\nsuccess as provincial level followed by success at the national level\n\nThe Emergence of the National Progressive Party\n\nCrerar insists it is not a farmer’s party, but for all who desire to see morality, reform, etc.\n\na distinct agrarianism in their policies, e.g. central demand was tariff reform, and easier access to credit for farmers, provincial control over national resources, more services to rural areas, abolition of party discipline and patronage, direct democracy\n\ndid not campaign as a national party in 1921\n\nLiberals and Conservatives in a state of disarray in the West, King tried to pose as a friend of the farmers and accused the Progressives of causing class tension, Conservatives advocated the National Policy\n\nin 1921, voters rejected both of the old parties, Conservatives won 50 seats, Liberals formed a minority, the Progressives won 25% of the popular vote and 64 seats to be the second largest party in government, however it was short-lived due to divisions within the new party and its raison etre, was it a party or a popular movement or…\n\nthe Manitoba wing led by Crerar favoured a pragmatic course of action, saw the Progressives as disbanding once the King government granted some concessions\n\nAlberta argued progressivism had to fundamentally challenge the political establishment, break with the past, much more principled/doctrinaire view\n\nserious implications\n\nthey seeded their role as Opposition to the third-place Conservatives\n\ndid not form a coalition\n\nthey lost their two best means to directly influence the political process\n\nKing dismisses the farmers, the progressives as “Liberals in a hurry” and only introduced sufficient concessions to keep himself from being defeated, e.g. reduced the tariff on farm machinery\n\nthe Conservative Quebec wing totally opposed to forming a coalition with the Progressives, no alliance formed, tricky balance\n\nProgressive Decline\n\nparty split in 1924 over the question of supporting the Liberal budget\n\npragmatism triumphed: Forke voted against an amendment that would have brought established progressive policy into law in order, King government would have dissolved, Conservatives might have come to power\n\n6 left the caucus to sit as independents\n\nno money, no national organization\n\nonly 24 Progressives (West of Ontario) elected next election\n\nLiberal-Progressive alliance to keep Liberals in power\n\n1926: only 9 Progressives left, disappear over the following years as the organized farmer’s protests of the 1920s faded, internal divisions, return of prosperity, some drifted to the Liberals, retired, or sat as independence\n\n1923: UFO fell from power in Ontario\n\nUFA out by mid-1930s, the last provincial party\n\n1926 resulted in the return of majority government, marked the completion of the transformation of Canada’s party system that had begun with the Union government\n\nLiberals and Conservatives had rallied support, extra parliamentary support, used conventions to elect leaders (small nod to democratic ideal)\n\nChallenging the Liberal Order, part 2 – The CCF and the Left\n\nMain Arguments:\n\nThe rise of the CCF followed a long tradition of diverse, but ultimately ineffectual political activism from Canadian labour. It was only the profound dislocation of the Great Depression that led to the emergence of a viable, national left-wing party;\n\nBeyond its socialist aspects, the CCF was a manifestation of the same agrarian populism and sectional resentment that gave rise to the Progressives;\n\nWhile the CCF presented a national vision challenging the political establishment, its early record was less spectacular than that which the Progressives, or its Prairie rival, the Social Credit Party experienced. Moreover, there were serious questions about how French Canada fit into the CCF’s alternative “national vision”.\n\nBackground – The Rise of Organized Labour and Socialism\n\nthe belief was that legal equality espoused by the Liberals was insufficient without social and economic equality\n\nthe Communist Manifesto argued that capitalism would collapse\n\nrise of a French socialist party in France\n\nfirst Labour MP elected in Scotland (Keir Hardie)\n\n1923: British Labour Party formed the government\n\nthe rise of socialism and organized labour in Canada resembled the situation in France and Italy: low percentage of organized workers, slow formation of trade unions\n\nmovement was divided: in Quebec, competition between the TLC and the Catholic movement; Western labour movement was more radical and resented American influence in the TLC\n\ntried to form One Big Union, idea was that all workers (skilled or unskilled) would be banned together, like International Workers of the World\n\nTrade Unions Congress (TUC)\n\nTrade and Labour Congress (TRC)\n\nEconomic Upheaval and Labour Activism in Canada\n\nafter WWI, labour unrest is universal, vicious cycle of economic disruption, hit the European and North American economies in particular, unemployment and inflation\n\ne.g. 1918: $1.60 to purchase what $1 purchased in 1913, worker’s wages not keeping pace, standard of living declining\n\n1919: week-long Winnipeg General Strike, set off sympathy strikes, class tension, but some dismissive attitudes\n\nradical social gospellers, e.g. Woodsworth and Irvine, thought that church-based social reform was too conservative, not going far enough\n\nLabour: The Political Reaction, 1890s-1930\n\nan incentive for labour to enter into electoral politics, built on a lengthy but ineffectual history of labour in politics, e.g. Socialist Party of BC held the balance of power in the BC legislature in 1903, the formation of the Socialist Party of Canada, in Ontario in 1919, 11 labour MPs elected\n\nlabour unions try to establish party at provincial levels across the country\n\nfarmer/labour coalition form the opposition in Nova Scotia\n\non the federal stage, 22 Labour candidates in 1917 run, but none elected, poor planning, dominance of the Liberals and Conservatives\n\nCanadian Labour Party did not see success, the TLC was accused of being too Conservative by the provinces and in return the TLC thought the provinces were too radical\n\nCommunist Party founded by radical members of the socialist party, strong tensions between the Communists and CLP, part ways at the end of the 1920s\n\nProgressives went on the record to say that they opposed militias to break strikes, but did not support an open alliance with Labour, not in farmer’s interest\n\nWoodsworth and Irvine the first labour MPs to not ultimately be absorbed by the Liberals\n\nwhen the Progressives splits part, 6 of its more radical MPs formed the “Ginger Group” which increasingly cooperated with Woodsworth and Irvine\n\ncoalition between the Labour movement and the UFO did not go well, not much progress in the Ontario legislature\n\na vital, active Canadian left, but ultimately politically impotent because of their divisions, e.g. a dozen labour and socialist parties in Toronto alone\n\nbarely survive the 1920s, a blip on the map\n\nwhat was needed was encouragement for unity…which came with the Great Depression\n\nseems that the capitalist system is indeed collapsing, no country immune\n\nCanada’s radical groups and labour groups worked together to unite the non-Communist left, as already happening in Parliament with Woodsworth, Irvine, and the “Ginger Group”, who became “The Commonwealth Party” in 1922\n\nThe Rise of the CCF\n\nConference of Western Labour Parties held in 1929, when they meet again two years later in the Depression, motivated, agreed to form a national labour party, extended an invitation to various farmer’s organizations to join, recognized that labour and farmers were ultimately facing a similar plight, marginalized by the Liberal capitalist system, their joint action was demanded\n\nimportant participants: Gardiner (UOA), Coldwell, Williams, and Tommy Douglas, also the League for Social Reconstruction, an intellectual brain trust of the CCF, a group of left-wing intellectuals, writers. etc. with a Christian background\n\nAug 1932 conference in Calgary brings together the labour movement and the farmer movement, synergy, they agree to federate and form a new movement that will champion the cause of socialism\n\nThe Co-operate Commonwealth Federation to be a social movement for change, radically change the way Canadian society functioned, challenge the Liberal establishment\n\ndraft a statement of purpose in 1933 at their first official meeting, The Regina Manifesto, advocates the eradication of capitalism, the peoples to control the state, the state to regulate the economy and provide a wide range of social services, public ownership of all financial establishments and public utilities, aimed to ensure that democracy governed the party rather than the party officers who were to be elected annually, policy conventions\n\nhourly pay falling an average of 2/3rds, collapse of international commodity prices, drought in Saskatchewan\n\nwithin 3 years of its founding, CCF the number 2 party in BC, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, with seats in Manitoba and Ontario as well\n\nno support in Quebec or Maritimes\n\nat the federal level, in 1935 they ran 119 candidates however does not have the same electoral breakthrough as the Progressives or as the provinces, only 9% of the popular vote, elects only 7 MPs in the West\n\nyet the CCF the true opposition to King’s Liberals, they are advocating the most radical changes, the Conservatives had just significantly lost the last election and are in disarray\n\nsuccess: section 98 of the Criminal Code which allowed the government to arrest and deport immigrants that they deemed a threat to national security scratched (reaction to Winnipeg General Strike)\n\nEvaluating the CCF\n\nsocialists, as demonstrated in Shawn Mills’ article\n\nbut in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Sinclair argues that the CCF party was in the populist Prairie tradition (like the Progressives) and consistent with the dominant presence of the middle class\n\nCCF not interfering with the primary means of production, the family farm in Saskatchewan, not attacking capitalism per se but those aspects of capitalism that were affecting the farm\n\nDan Horowitz argues that the apparent popularity of socialism in Canada can be contributed to the “Tory touch”, Canada more receptive to the organic view of society, collective aspects\n\nbut if Canada is so receptive to a collectivist, socialist approach, why didn’t the CCF make more progress at the federal level?\n\nChallenging the Establishment, part 3: Social Credit and the Union Nationale\n\nMain Arguments:\n\nThe rise of Alberta’s Social Credit Party and Quebec’s Union Nationale may both be understood as Depression-era reactions against industrial capitalism and the respective political status quo in each province;\n\nWhile both parties came to power criticizing industrial capitalism and even demonstrated some left-leaning attributes, fundamentally, their concern was not so much to challenge the established liberal order, but to correct it, ensure it endured, and that more radical solutions were not attempted;\n\nBoth parties were successful because they responded to Albertans and Quebecers’ search for scapegoats and solutions. However, neither party delivered on the reforms they had promised, and both were quickly revealed to be fundamentally conservative in their governing style.\n\nBackground to the Rise of Social Credit\n\nas the Depression continued, people searched for alternatives\n\ne.g. rise of the right-wing Nazis and Roosevelt’s New Deal\n\nCanada not immune\n\nSocial Credit: 1930s Alberta is overwhelmingly rural, most non-farm employment was still linked in some way to the agricultural economy, Big East business the scapegoat\n\nUFA had evolved into a party like any other, increasingly Conservative in its reaction to the Depression, despite being elected on a wave of agrarian discontent a generation earlier\n\nsocialist nature of CCF appealing, but ultimately Social Credit\n\nSocial Credit theory developed by C.H. Douglas, rejected social collectivism, promised to cure capitalism through reform, answered why the system could be producing so many goods and yet there was poverty, the “A + B” theorem, the real cause of the Depression was that the real wages being paid to produce goods and services was always less than the total costs of production, i.e. it costs more to produce goods than people were earning to produce them, never enough money in the economy to purchase the goods that the economy was producing, solution Douglas proposed was to make up the difference, the government should provide every consumer with a “social credit”, i.e. an amount of money from the government that could theoretically cover the balance between the goods produced and the paid wages, a very rudimentary form of Keynesian economics, in periods of economic downturn governments should spend money, keep enough money in the economy for it to function\n\nAlberta was fertile ground for this theory: UFA personalities had preached Douglas’ theory as part of their larger attack on the economic status quo\n\nBackground to the Rise of the Union Nationale\n\nMontreal 1933: 1/3rd of the population on relief\n\n1920: agriculture only 1/3rd of the Quebec economy, declining\n\nincreasing industrialization, development of the natural resource sector\n\nincreasing foreign capital\n\nculture: the social tensions were as cultural as they were economic, increasing industrialization and urbanization meant the marginalization of Francos, scapegoated the Anglos\n\nFrench-Canadien nationalists concentrated on intellectuals, e.g. Lionel Groulx, who said the Depression was the result of foreign capital’s dominance, calls for reform, came from the new social thought in the Catholic Church: a Christian humanism\n\nProgramme de Restauration Sociale (PRS): Catholic trade unions, farmer’s organizations, credit unions, patriotic and professional societies, universities, called for fundamental reform, including rural reconstruction (strengthen and extend the agrarian sector especially in northern Quebec); the labour question (protect workers, provide greater economic security for the working class); trust and finance (curb the power of private utilities and other large enterprises like the milk industry); political reforms (elimination of patronage politics, return to ethical politics hahaha)\n\nThe Rise of Social Credit\n\ndelegates urged the UFA government to examine the Social Credit theory as a method to recover, government drags its heals\n\nWilliam Aberhart emerges as the leader of the SC political challenge, called for representatives, had a populist, non-partisan nature\n\neach Albertan to receive a monthly government cheque to spend (like Klein!)\n\n“All you have to know about Social Credit is that if you vote for it the experts will make it work”\n\neffort to correct the weaknesses of liberal capitalism, bring stability\n\nrapid rise\n\nbeyond the attraction of the $25, Albertans attracted to abolishing poverty, and it tapped into Western discontent with the East, the soft-totalitarian nature was attractive, call for charismatic leaders like Aberhart, a great communicator\n\nAberhart drew a large share of religious community (Christian fundamentalism compatible with Social Credit), harped on his credentials like his Queen’s degree, but maintained a folksy, populist appeal, appeared in warn and patch-up coats, used improper grammar\n\nSC’s success attributed to its advanced organizational structure, paralleled the UFA, SC brought together study groups, the “Social Credit League”, makings of a mass political movement, Aberhart and his followers able to convert some UFA organizations to SC, movement becomes a full-fledged party in April 1935\n\nhint that what was billed as a reform movement had some reactionary elements, e.g. Aberhart and his lieutenants controlled the party (drew up the platform, vetted the candidates who were selected, preferred small businessmen, only 9 farmers selected to be SC candidates); opposed by the major corporate interests and some businesses (warned of economic disruption, inflationary pressures that would be inherent, government intervention in setting wages)\n\nAug 1935 provincial election, 56/63 seats went to the SoCreds\n\n15/17 elected federally\n\nthe popular vote disguised divisions within society\n\nopted for the quick-fix, the heir to the populist reform tradition (i.e. tax the rich), Aberhart made clear that his reform was preaching reform not revolution, the CCF had not done itself any favours by aligning itself with unpopular UFA elements, getting the votes of angry people\n\nThe Rise of the Union Nationale\n\ndivisions among the Quebec Liberals, young nationalist intellectuals who pressured for social services and curb foreign control\n\nAction Liberale Nationale formed (ALN) led by Paul Gouin, the grandson of the Parti Nationale founder, supported the nationalization of Quebec’s private power companies, break the dominance of foreign capital and address the marginalization of French Canadiens\n\nto be addressed by a third way\n\nnew, no electoral experience, no party workers to run campaign\n\nopen to alliance offers…joined the Quebec Conservative Party, who had been in opposition since 1897, dissociated from the federal party, they too criticized the close ties between the Liberals and Big Business, foreign capital, etc.\n\nMaurice Duplessis becomes leader of the Conservatives, as Taschereau’s Liberals faltering, merges with the ALN and other independent nationalists, a significant powerful nationalist party\n\nUnion Nationale meant Quebec voters presented with platform for significant political, economic, social reform\n\nTaschereau’s Liberals recognized the threat too late, got a bare majority in next election, first substantial opposition in years\n\nPublic Accounts Committee revived under Duplessis, investigate, reveal patronage, government waste, e.g. more than 40 of Taschereau’s relatives employed by the government, and is forced to resign, Godbout takes his place, promises reform (like Martin coming to power)\n\nnew election in 1936, UN wins 76/90 seats\n\nresults a protest against an economic system and against political corruption, accompanied by a demand for the reform of Liberal capitalism to allow French Canadiens to regain control over Quebec’s resources\n\nReactionaries in Reform Clothing: Evaluating the SoCreds and UN\n\nAberhart realizes that Social Credit is impossible to implement\n\nSocial Credit Act passed, with a number of other measures, to implement the program, affects banking which is under the federal jurisdiction so it is ruled unconstitutional, Ottawa vetos other pieces of SoCred legislation\n\nwhat is the social credit party if there is no social credit?\n\nConservative: from a protest movement preaching radical reform to a conservative, reactionary group that left behind its populist roots\n\nManning claims that SoCred provided Alberta with the most Conservative government\n\nsimilar dynamic in Quebec\n\nDuplessis a nationalist but not radical\n\nhis concern was not social and economic reform\n\nbut he promises to fight political corruption\n\ndoes not promise specifics\n\nin power, UN largely ignored its stated goal of reforming capitalism, becomes a right-wing anti-labour nationalist party, spends money to promote agriculture in northern Quebec, but neglects urban workers and poor in Montreal\n\na good friend of liberal capitalism\n\nALN disillusioned with the conservatism, withdraw their support, many turn to the Liberal fold\n\nDuplessis has a free hand to run Quebec, few restrictions on foreign capitalists, attacks on left-wing activism (those preaching reform), few social services\n\nonce again, a party preaching reform that rose quickly to power on a wave of Depression-era discontent turned out to be a reactionary party that maintains the status quo of the liberal capitalist order\n\nCanadian Politics during the Second World War: From Crisis to Reconstruction\n\nCanada’s party politics leading to and during the Second World War were influenced significantly by the memory of the political crisis that erupted over conscription during the First World War;\n\nWartime issues, notably conscription, shaped party politics in Quebec, leading to the election of the Liberals in 1939, the advent of the Bloc Populaire in 1942, and ultimately, the return of the Union Nationale;\n\nWhile the CCF and the Canadian Left appeared poised to make a breakthrough during the war, Canada’s established political parties – notably the Liberals – were able to deflect the challenge by moving to the left, maintaining the dominance of liberalism (and Liberalism) in Canadian party politics.\n\nThe Road to War\n\nKing’s Liberals followed a policy of appeasement, especially Quebec political opinion, mindful of what the last war had done to Canada and the Liberal Party (split), avoid a war, or limit the scope of Canadian participation\n\nKing relied on his lieutenant (French Canadian) for opinion\n\n“Twin mantra”: parliament will decide and no prior commitments\n\nParliament will decide: the government will actually tell parliament what to decide, a stall tactic\n\nNo prior commitments: isolation sentiment\n\nCanada would have to increase its defence spending, this revealed the depth of isolationist sentiment in Quebec, Quebec Liberals broke rank and voted against the party, Western Liberals argued the money should go to social spending\n\nCanadian opinion in flux\n\nKing made a very pro-British speech, seemed to be going towards the imperialist-nationalist view of Canada\n\nif the Liberals fall, a Union government likely\n\ntwo months later, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia\n\ntwo speeches: King frustrated that Canada called upon to fight in Europe every 20 years, Lapoint speaks against conscription\n\n“No neutrality, no conscription” pact\n\nCanadian parliament declares war after Britain, only four MPs opposed, one of which was the CCF leader Woodsworth, at odds with the majority of his party, Nazi aggression had to be addressed, CCF previously pacifist, Woodsworth stands alone, a bit of a split, he resigns as leader and Coldwell takes over\n\nthe scope of its participation had to be decided, King wanted to avoid an all-out war effort (Borden’s all or nothing approach), preferred a limited liability approach\n\nConscription Crisis, part 1\n\nFrench Canadians had accepted entry into the war on the grounds that conscription would not be enacted, but young French Canadians actually flocked to the recruiting offices, motivation of employment after the Depression\n\nDuplessis tries to revive nationalist fears, federal ministers intervene in the Quebec provincial election, promises that so long as the Liberals are in power in Ottawa there will be no conscription, Union Nationale are defeated, Liberals come back to power\n\nKing’s luck continues into the new year\n\nJan 1940 the Ontario legislation passes legislation that criticizes Ottawa’s limited liability\n\nManion (Conservative leader after Bennett), certain level of non-partisanship, Parliament not sitting as this time, assured by King that there would be no election until after parliament had met in Jan 1940, keeps his word, but calls a snap election after one day\n\nManion was anti-conscription\n\nLiberals win election, Manion loses his own seat and resigns, by Jun most of Europe has fallen, it appears Britain is on the verge of being invaded, limited liability collapses\n\na second Canadian division sent oversees\n\ncalls for conscriptions begin\n\nNational Resources Mobilization Act: introduces conscription but just for domestic service\n\nsome Liberal members express misgivings about this trend, but King assures them there will not be oversees conscription, still generally accepted in Quebec, but the role of ministers like Lapointe was crucial\n\npressure grows, Minister of Defence pushes for it\n\nMeighen returns to leadership of the Conservatives, calls for conscription and a Union government, like WWI\n\nLapointe dies, King loses this support/opinion\n\nspread of the war to the Pacific, West Coast concerns, increasing pressures all over\n\n1942 culmination: King announces a plebiscite, asking Canadians to release the government from its pledge, Quebec is generally opposed, evidenced by the emergence of the pressure group Ligue pour la defense du Canada, country splits along linguistic lines, profound division, King declares “Conscription if necessary but not necessarily conscription”, NRMA revised to permit overseas conscription but not require it, debate causes serious splits in cabinet and caucus, bill passes, government supplies, Liberals stay united and in power\n\nconscription issue continued to have reverberations in Quebec politics\n\nRise of the Bloc Populaire Canadien\n\nto defend French Canada’s interests, seen as losing its autonomy, especially given close relationship between federal and provincial Liberals\n\nadvocates Canadian neutrality, independence from Britain\n\nled by Maxime Raymond at th"
