Michael Russell\n\n“I am branded in Québec as a traitor to the French, and in Ontario as a traitor to the English. In Québec, I am branded as a jingo, and in Ontario as a separatist. In Québec, I am attacked as an Imperialist, and in Ontario as an anti-Imperialist. I am neither. I am a Canadian.” The words of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Canada’s first francophone Prime Minister, still resonate today. Faced with the monumental task of rebuilding a young nation at a time of great divide, Wilfrid encountered many challenges as he fought to bring the French and English together through compromise. It is a legacy that changed the country forever. This is the in-depth story of one of Canada’s greatest leaders, from childhood to his twilight years.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nDetails\n\nFormat: Full-colour Paperback\n\nType: Graphic novel\n\nGenre: Historical & Biographical Fiction\n\nDimensions: 76 Pages, 7x10\"\n\nPublished: 2017\n\nLanguage: English\n\nRecommended Audience: Grades 6-12\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nShop Local"
