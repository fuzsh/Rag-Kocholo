        "text": "Wilfrid Laurier broke my computer. No really, I was doing research for this post, read a rumour that Laurier may or may not have fathered an illegitimate child, got excited, and knocked a glass of water all over my computer. It is now soaking in a bag of rice. I blame Laurier.\n\nSo I'm writing this on my mother's computer that as Scotch tape holding the screen together. Anyways, I digress. Back to Laurier.\n\nWilfrid Laurier was Canada's seventh prime minister and the first one since John A. Macdonald who the majority of Canadians have heard about. And his visage has graced the $5 since 1972, making him arguably the most recognizable Canadian politician, because we've all found him in a coat pocket or street somewhere.\n\nLaurier was born in Saint-Lin, Eastern Canada - present day Quebec - in 1841. He was the second child to his parents Carolus and Marcelle, who created a politically-active household for their family. Because of that, little Willy grew up immersed in political debates and talk. His father had a hodgepodge of jobs, including farmer, surveyor, mayor and justice of the peace. Having such a range of jobs may have helped formed his liberal ideals that he passed onto his son. Another thing the father did that was fundamental in helping his son's future political career was sending him to a school in an English town at the ripe age of 11. Laurier attended school in new Glasgow - a community filled mostly with Scottish immigrants, which gave him an education on English way of life, as well as principals. He also attended school at the College de L'Assomption and graduated with a law degree from McGill University in 1864 - where former prime minister John Abbott was one of his instructors.\n\nLaurier married Zoe Lafontaine in May of 1868. Zoe was an educated a bright woman from a well-known household and she held many prominent positions herself, including VP on the formation of the National Council for Women and VP of the Victorian Order of the Nurses. The couple had no children --- which is why the water-spilling rumour is so interesting. According to the lore, after 20 years of matrimony, Laurier fell in love with Emilie Barthe, a married woman who was passionate about literature and politics - a turn on for Laurier. While their relationship remains unknown, they exchanged multiple letters that suggest a romantic tinge blurred their friendship. On August 23, 1891, Laurier wrote to Emilie:\n\nSo while Laurier and his wife Zoe did not have any children, it is said that he fathered a child with his lover Emilie - Armand Renaud Lavergne. This child grew up under the pretense that he was the proper child of Emilie and her husband Joseph Lavergne. This rumour was mostly spurred on due to Renaud Lavergne's resemblance of Laurier himself.\n\nAll this love action is getting my computer all wet.\n\nBack to boring old politics: Laurier was elected to the House of Commons in 1874 and served as Minister of Island Revenue under first Liberal PM Alexander Mackenzie. He became leader of the party in 1887, when he succeeded Edward Blake - John A. Macdonald's long time political foe.\n\nAfter the nest of traitors in Mackenzie Bowell's administration and Charles Tupper's 67 day stint as PM, Laurier's Liberals won a majority in general election, where he would stay for a stunning 15 years, until 1911. Even after his time as PM, he remained the official Leader of the Opposition until his death 1919, meaning the guy loved politics to much that he never retired. Laurier holds the record for the longest uninterrupted time in office and is tied with Macdonald for winning the most elections - they both were voted into office four times.\n\nBecause of Laurier's decade and a half in the PM's chair, he has one of the most robust reigns to dig into. Which means I have to stop writing this blog so I can go and research the next one. Undoubtedly, I am going to lose a lot of time thinking of Lauier's love affairs and drying out my poor old Macbook."
