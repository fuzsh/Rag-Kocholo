        "text": "Laurier’s principal campus is in Kitchener, part of the tri-cities region of southwestern Ontario along with Waterloo and Cambridge. This area is known as a key centre in Canada for high technology research. The university also has campuses in nearby Brantford and Milton, defining itself as a \"multi-campus multi-community university\".\n\nLaurier traces its roots to the opening of the Evangelical Lutheran Seminary in Waterloo more than 100 years ago in 1911.\n\nWe’ve gone through several changes since then, and in 1973 our name changed from Waterloo Lutheran University to Wilfrid Laurier University. In 1999, we opened our campus in Brantford."
