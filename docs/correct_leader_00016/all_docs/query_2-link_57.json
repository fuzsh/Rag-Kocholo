        "text": "After a ratification meeting held on September 3, 2020, Members of the Wilfrid Laurier University Staff Association (WLUSA), a bargaining unit under the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation (OSSTF), voted 94% in favour of ratifying the new Collective Agreement.\n\nWilfrid Laurier University’s Board of Governors is set to meet on Friday, September 11 to ratify the agreement on behalf of the employer.\n\nWLUSA certified as a labour union in 1995 and now represents over 600 office, clerical and technical staff at the Waterloo and Kitchener campuses of the university. The last Collective Agreement expired on June 30, 2020.\n\n“I would like to thank both the University and WLUSA negotiating teams for their hard work and dedication towards achieving this tentative agreement. This agreement is a commitment by both Laurier and WLUSA to continue our collaborative partnership.” says Niru Philip, Chief Negotiator, WLUSA.\n\nDetails will be released once both sides have ratified the tentative agreement.\n\nFor more information, please contact Keith Goulet, President, WLUSA at wlusaadmin@wlu.ca.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nBargaining Update: Tentative agreement reached (August 21, 2020)\n\nBargaining Update: Membership Meeting (August 13, 2020)\n\nBargaining Update: Presenting the proposal (July 16, 2020)\n\nBargaining Update: Surveying Membership priorities (July 10, 2020)\n\nBargaining Update: Preparing for negotiations (June 26, 2020)\n\nOn Monday, June 29th, I submitted our intent to bargain for a new Collective Agreement with\n\nthe University.\n\nThe Collective Agreement expired on July 1st. However, our contract stays in force during\n\nnegotiations. Please continue to follow the protocols and procedures, policies, and processes\n\njust as before. Your Collective Agreement rights and benefits as outlined continue to be in\n\neffect. If you have concerns about your rights and benefits, please reach out to your WLUSA\n\nsteward or the WLUSA office at wlusaadmin@wlu.ca.\n\nShortly after signaling our intent to bargain for a new Collective Agreement, the University\n\nresponded back with an offer to meet for the first official pre-bargaining meeting. It was held on\n\nJuly 7th and was immediately followed up with a second meeting on July 8th. I am happy to\n\nreport that we have agreed to a process that will move both WLUSA and the University down a\n\npath to a success a round of bargaining.\n\nBoth WLUSA and the University look forward to building on a solid foundation established back\n\nin 1995 when WLUSA first certified as a Union. Our current Collective Agreement was first\n\nestablished and negotiated in 1997 and has remained largely a shining example of how\n\ncollective bargaining can lead to a trusting relationship between employees and the employer.\n\nOur pre-bargaining meetings resulted in us agreeing on the composition of our table teams,\n\nfuture bargaining dates and a new approach to bargaining this round. We also agreed to an\n\naggressive timeline and a commitment to try and conclude bargaining by the week of Aug 14th.\n\nFollowing our meeting with the University, I consulted with the WLUSA Executive to discuss the\n\ntiming and next steps.\n\nThis is where I now require your input and your priorities. The membership survey is ready to be\n\nemailed to you. You should receive an email soon from SurveyMonkey. Please keep an eye on\n\nyour Junk Email folder if you don’t see it in the next day or so. Please take your time and\n\ncomplete it. It will help the research team and the table team to appropriately prioritize our\n\nbargaining strategies. By July 14th we will tally up the results of the survey. Then on July 15th\n\nWLUSA will hold a zoom meeting from 10:30am to 11:30am to update and inform you our\n\nMembers of our negotiating priorities and brief. This will become our proposal to the University.\n\nI would like to point out now the efforts and hard work of your sixteen-member WLUSA\n\nCollective Bargaining Committee. Their commitment to WLUSA and all of the hours they have\n\nvolunteered have resulted in a strategic vision and plan that will guide us to a successful round\n\nof negotiations.\n\nI look forward to seeing the results of the membership survey and to speaking with all of you\n\nabout our priorities, plans, and strategies on Wed July 15th at 10:30am. Details about our zoom\n\ncall and presentation will be emailed out soon.\n\nIf I have failed to answer a question you had or if this message has inspired new questions,\n\nplease email me and I will respond.\n\nIn solidarity, always being mindful of our rights and protections, and that of our home Laurier.\n\nNiru Philip\n\nChief Negotiator, WLUSA/OSSTF D35\n\nRelated Posts\n\nBargaining Update: Preparing for negotiations (June 26, 2020)\n\nI hope this Bargaining update finds you safe and well. I pray that you are settled in your duties and are\n\nbeing productive working from home.\n\nAs you may already be aware, our Collective Agreement expires June 30th, 2020. Many of you ha\n\nalready reached out to Keith or myself asking about our bargaining status. Here is a synopsis of what has\n\ntranspired to date.\n\nFor the past few rounds, we have made a strong effort to reach an agreement prior to the end of the\n\ncurrent Agreement, but as you know recent events, government decisions, and other internal changes\n\nhave caused us to take more of a “wait and see” approach.\n\nIn June 2019, the Provincial Government launched Bill 124 that legislates wage increases of just 1% per\n\nyear over the next 3 years. This law makes it very difficult to bargain anything related to compensation.\n\nAll provincial unions, including OSSTF, have launched a Charter challenge against this Bill and we have\n\nbeen waiting to see when this challenge may be heard by the courts. Additionally, all elementary and\n\nsecondary school teachers and support staff were already in the midst of bargaining. It was important to\n\nsee how those sessions would impact Bill 124.\n\nInternally, we launched the new Job Evaluation System. In those presentations, it was the hope that by\n\nlate Summer, we would be at a stage where discussions would begin about what a new Salary Grid\n\nwould look like.\n\nThen, of course, came the pandemic known as COVID-19 which has slowed down a lot of processes and\n\nintroduced new challenges. To the points above, the pandemic has stalled all court proceedings around\n\nthe Charter challenge and has caused delays in the submissions of Job Analysis Questionnaires (JAQs).\n\nAs you may know, the faculty union (WLUFA) has reached a new collective agreement with the\n\nUniversity for their full-time unit. Keith and I have kept regular communication with the bargaining\n\nleaders in WLUFA to understand the challenges that come with bargaining in a virtual environment.\n\nKeith and I began meeting with representatives in Human Resources early in 2020 and both sides\n\nacknowledge that without the ability to bargain much in terms of compensation, bargaining will not be\n\n“traditional” in any manner, which has caused the Collective Bargaining Committee to think differently\n\nin its approach.\n\nThe Collective Bargaining Committee met on a regular basis in February and March to prepare a\n\nMembership Survey and brief. However, with the impact of the pandemic, the Committee halted its\n\nnormal march towards bargaining. The Committee started meeting again in late May and early June,\n\nmeeting in the virtual world of Teams and Zoom. We have started new conversations and are\n\nattempting to create scenarios around the Charter challenge, the job evaluation system, and the\n\npandemic.\n\nExpect over the coming days and weeks to receive a brief survey from the Committee and regular\n\nupdates as we move toward renewing our Agreement. In the meantime, you should know that on July\n\n1st, the terms and conditions of our current Collective Agreement will remain in effect until a new\n\nAgreement is reached. Changes to the Agreement made after July 1st are typically made retroactive to\n\nJuly 1st, when applicable.\n\nIf I have failed to answer a question you had or if this message has inspired new questions, please email\n\nme and I will respond.\n\nIn solidarity, always being mindful of our rights and protections, and that of our home Laurier.\n\nNiru Philip\n\nChief Negotiator, WLUSA/OSSTF D35"
