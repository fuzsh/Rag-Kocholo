        "text": "I officially have passed on the torch to the next Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance President. From our Welcome Conference, Strategic Planning Conference, Student Advocacy Conference, General Assemblies, Partners in Higher Education Dinner, campus visits and everything in between, I would not have traded it for anything else. Our Annual Report beautifully summarizes the year that we had together - https://lnkd.in/gEtGDB2X. Thank you to my Executive Director, Malika Dhanani, you have been my right hand woman and I would not be half the person I am without you. Thank you to my Home Office, Tiffany Li Wu, Octavia Andrade-Dixon, and Ananya Gupta for your guidance, patience and understanding throughout this year. Thank you to my Steering Committee, Alyssa Hall, Abigail S., Julian Mollot-Hill, Victoria Mills, Kate Traynor, Samantha Brown, Anthony Coulter, Emily Poirier and Zarreen Brown for the ways you have advocated for the students we represent, you’ve showed up and showed out. Words cannot express how proud and humbled I am to have served as OUSA's President. This experience has reaffirmed how powerful the student voice is. My predecessor Jessica Look's blog post, \"Bring a folding chair if they don't give you a seat at the table,\" inspired me to take a chance a year ago. Representation is important and I’m grateful to have witnessed such a great leader in this role previously. Students are true champions of change and the future is bright with them in it. Keep on lobbying on!\n\nWow. It’s been a year already, hasn’t it? 365 days ago, I started one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had. The younger version of myself had no idea what an adventure I was about to embark on. Being VP Government & Stakeholder Relations at Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union has been a dream. It was such an amazing feeling to give back to an organization that has served me throughout my undergraduate years. Here are some key highlights from my time that I would like to share: Consent Awareness Week Every third week of September is designated as Consent Awareness Week to recognize, acknowledge, and raise awareness of the rise in sexual violence on postsecondary campuses during the first six weeks of the new academic year. From September 18th to September 22nd, my department and I were able to host a variety of events, including Stand in Solidarity with Survivors, Healing Through Yoga, Banging Brunch, Art Jamming & Resource Fair, Decompress with Us, and FRIES for FRIES. Indigenous Mural Unveiling This was a one-of-a-kind initiative and cooperation that allowed us to take part in the Indigenous Mural Unveiling outside the Laurier Library. We had people tie red and orange ribbons to represent Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, as well as Orange Shirt Day around seven trees in the courtyard to represent the Seven Grandfather Teachings. We also distributed OUSA Orange Shirt Day Campaign pins to the guests. OUSA Fall General Assembly Our Students’ Union had the great opportunity to host delegations at Laurier this year! With lots of planning and coordination, we were able to execute a successful weekend of discussions on three policy papers. Local Advocacy Week Our student staff and volunteers meet with local city representatives and political leaders this week to advocate for the needs of students in the Waterloo Region and Brantford County through student-led consultations and policy briefs. OUSA Spring General Assembly I was able to co-author the Addressing Racism and Religious Discrimination policy paper that has passed in a timely manner. This was a valuable experience to have been a part of. Other fun events! We held two more sexy trivia brunches and a tote-bag making workshop! It was exciting to interact with the students through these activities. It was a busy and exciting time for my department. I appreciate all levels of engagement we had from our students, community partners, stakeholders and government officials to have made it a successful year!\n\nOne year ago, I received a call confirming my role as A-Team Coordinator with Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union. I was beyond thrilled and scared with big shoes to fill. Little did I know all the long hours of effort and dedication I had yet to experience. Starting with Orientation Week, I was on a team with the most inviting group of people who worked hard to provide first-year students a warm welcome. Four months of meetings, planning and training, we were able to execute an in-person O-Week during COVID-19. From all the uncertainty and challenges, this has allowed me to grow my adaptability skills even further. I’ll never forget the excitement of being able to run a concert, host a game night or being dunked in the dunk tank for charity. O-Week was a taste of how this hybrid year would be. During the fall semester, my executive team and I were able to host Fall Fest (an outdoor photo booth), Family Feud night (to fundraise for Movember), TV Shows vs. Movie Bracket (interactive Instagram game), monthly Spotify playlists, and the Gingerbread Showdown (festive Instagram competition). This was a great start but was a difficult time to boost student engagement. Following, January was a discouraging period as COVID-19 was at an all-time high. The drive for creativity and overall volunteerism was becoming a bit of a struggle. However, my team and I pushed for quality over quantity events. Our comeback of Sexy Bingo (Valentine’s Day with Aurora Matrix) was the shining moment that motivated us through the next while. After reading week, we took this morale booster to reflect on what our goals were for the end. In the past month of March, my team has launched videos on our YouTube channel, brought back the Music Bracket, encouraged people to Be Kind to Each Other, gave away mental health goodie bags, collaborated with other SU committees, hosted Karaoke Night at Wilfs, revived our legacy event Catch Me if You Can, and won 2 marketing awards. There were so many back to back highlights that has fulfilled me. Truly, my cup runneth over. However, out all the things, my team with their compassion, energy and drive was the reason that any of this was possible. To my team, Orla, Cassandra, Kaitlyn Brown, Rebecca, Shivani, Kaitlyn Wu, Ashley, Leanne, Madie and Ana... Without you, I would not be nearly anywhere as good as a Coordinator, a leader, and a friend. You all have taught me something so valuable. I could not be more proud of you and everything that we have accomplished together. Thank you for making my third year worthwhile. This will always be something I remember and take on with me into my final year. I owe it to you. To my bosses, Talia and Alana, thank you for providing me guidance. From my frantic calls and texts, you have supported me through it all. I appreciate you both deeply! Cheers to A-Team 2021-2022! #volunteer #leadership #dreamteam\n\nYesterday marked the last day of being Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union Activities Team Digital Media Executive. The highlight reel below was the final project my Executive partner, Simrit Randhawa and I had left to complete. It encompasses all the AmAzing events we held throughout the school year, defying the odds of a virtual world. Our team ran 6 major events this year, including 2 new ones. Looking back on everything, I could not be happier with how things worked out. Most of all, I made 12 new friends who I adore: Lauren Mastroianni, Kaitlyn Brown, Rebecca Chamberlain, Sarah Brophy, Leila Taibi, Shivani Ramesh, Cassandra Watanabe, Orla Molloy, Simrit Randhawa, Blaze Welling, Macie Narbonne and Ana Nesterovic. Thank you for your energy and for putting a smile on my face every single meeting. I’m going to miss our Monday nights together! Fortunately, today marks my first official day as A-Team’s Coordinator. I owe a lot of my success to you and our team, Blaze Welling. You’ve shown me how to lead with compassion, purpose and integrity in this role, and for that, I’m indebted. I look forward to see what this upcoming year has in store for me and my future team. Here’s to A-Team 2020-2021 one last time! #volunteer #leadership #teamappreciation"
