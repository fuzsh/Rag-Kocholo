        "text": "William Mulock was born on 19 January 1844 at Bond Head, in the western part of the Province of Canada (todays Ontario). Through his entire life he was involved in justice and politics at the provincial and federal levels. He had a hand in the formulation and implementation of major projects that would mark the countrys development, projects that affected communication networks and, in particular, the postal system.\n\nAfter being called to the Ontario Bar in 1868 and becoming vice-chancellor of the University of Toronto in 1881 (he would later be made chancellor in 1924), William Mulock entered Parliament in 1882 as the Liberal member for North York. He sat in the Commons for 23 years. In 1896, the new Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, appointed him Postmaster General, an office he filled until 15 October 1905.\n\nAmong Mulocks important contributions to the Canadian postal system was the introduction of a uniform postal rate across the entire British Empire. While representing Canada as Postmaster General at the 1898 conference in London on imperial postal rates, he proposed the adoption of a single preferential imperial rate of two cents. In the late 19th century, Canada was beginning to attach great importance to its role as a member of the British Empire. The country welcomed thousands of British immigrants during the boom of the 1890s and 1900s. These new immigrants were a vocal and assertive ethnic majority. It was in this context that Mulocks proposal was made, and it was duly accepted after being adopted by a number of representatives of British dominions and territories. It had the effect of making communications easier between Canada and the rest of the Empire. To mark this event, Mulock hastened to design and issue a special two-cent postage stamp celebrating the grandeur of the British Empire. From 1900 to 1905, Mulock simultaneously held the two offices of Postmaster General and Minister of Labour. In 1902, he took part in the negotiations that led to the completion of the cable link between Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the following year he was instrumental in a project to link Canada and the United Kingdom by radio waves.\n\nIn 1905, Mulock sat on a commission of inquiry into the telephone in Canada. As chair of the parliamentary committee investigating the subject, he openly declared himself in favour of nationalizing the telephone services offered by private companies. In the Commons debates leading to adoption of the motion to open the inquiry, he commented: \"I must confess to a bias as regards the telephone. That bias would be that I cannot see why it is not as much the duty of the state to take charge of the telephone as it is to conduct the postal service.\" He encountered opposition from the Bell Telephone Company and the rest of the Laurier cabinet. Nationalization of telephone services was rejected. Mulock left the office of Postmaster General at that time. He was next appointed chief justice of the Exchequer Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and, in 1923, was made chief justice of the Ontario Court of Appeal.\n\nWilliam Mulock finally retired from public life in 1936 at the age of 92. He was over 100 when he died on 1 October 1944 in Toronto. A final interesting note is that his grandson, William Pate Mulock, followed in his footsteps to some extent, in that he too was elected the member for North York, in which capacity he served for 15 years. He also served as Postmaster General under Mackenzie King from 1940 to 1945.\n\nStéphanie Ouellet\n\nSource\n\nBabe, Robert E. \"Mulock, Sir William.\" In The 2000 Canadian Encyclopedia, World Edition.
