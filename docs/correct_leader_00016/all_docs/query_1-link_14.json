        "text": "About Laurier\n\nCommunity at Our Core\n\nAt Laurier, community is at the heart of who we are. A deep sense of connection and belonging is felt across our campuses and resonates into the communities we call home.\n\nLaurier students aren’t content with simply earning a university degree. To them, education is a springboard to something greater: it’s the key to shaping a life, building a community and making a difference.\n\nLearning and Research with Purpose\n\nOur programs provide a broad spectrum of traditional and innovative learning across arts and social sciences, business and economics, music, science, social work and education. No matter the field of study, our research connects interdisciplinary scholarship and creative activity with communities to address the most pressing local and global challenges.\n\nOur world faces complex challenges; Laurier researchers and graduates are ready to tackle them.\n\nHistory\n\nLaurier traces its roots to the opening of the Evangelical Lutheran Seminary in Waterloo more than 100 years ago in 1911. We’ve gone through several changes since then, and in 1973 our name changed from Waterloo Lutheran University to Wilfrid Laurier University. In 1999, we opened our campus in Brantford and will welcome our first Laurier Milton students in September 2024.\n\nRead a historical overview of Laurier facilities, including renovations, additions and new construction throughout the years."
