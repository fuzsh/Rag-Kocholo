The Political Science Department’s policy on deferred midterm and final examinations can be found at http://www.wlu.ca/arts/politicalscience COURSE DESCRIPTION This course surveys the development of Western political ideas from ancient Greece to Thomas Hobbes's decisive rejection of ancient and medieval assumptions about the nature of society and the sources of authority. This long and complex intellectual arc is set against a dramatic swathe of history: the ebb and flow of empires, the horrors of plague and war, the beginnings of both capitalism and modern science, the rise of extraordinary sophistication in music and visual art, and the emergence of the sovereign territorial states that dominate the modern political imagination. To tell the story of great thinkers – Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes – is to discover the enduring power and importance of ideas, certainly; but it is also to tell the story of their historical circumstances, and the broad cultural, intellectual, demographic and socioeconomic currents of which they were a part. To this end, in addition to a careful reading of several classic texts in Western political thought, we will include in our explorations a fundamental debate about knowledge, exemplified in the arguments of Descartes and Vico, and the reveries of Montaigne. In the course of our readings we will also encounter several historical accounts of the rise of social complexity and civilization, and key transformations in scholarly thought and everyday life in the West, from the decline and fragmentation of Roman empire in the fifth century through to the intellectual and political ferment of seventeenth century Europe. This course is reading- and writing-intensive. The reading assignments are long and demand sustained attention: you cannot grapple with a complex philosophical argument and historical analysis by a casual skimming of the texts. The written assignments are several; they are short, but involve careful and concise explanation and analysis. As you may already know (and if not, you will soon discover), writing with clarity, precision, and brevity is a difficult task, but one well worth learning. Any primate at a keyboard can produce a 50-page paper. Much, much rarer – and correspondingly more valuable – is a short, perspicuous, persuasive analysis or argument. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that you should strive for the latter. Page 1"
