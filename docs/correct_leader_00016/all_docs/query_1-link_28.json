        "text": "This is a very readable but somewhat fawning biography of one of\n\nCanada’s most prominent prime ministers. Although there are no\n\nfootnotes, the author has clearly mined the relevant archival material.\n\nLaPierre’s Laurier is a heroic figure who correctly reasoned that the\n\nonly way to hold the diverse elements of Canada together was through\n\ncompromise and accommodation. Unfortunately, the section that examines\n\nLaurier’s time in power—less than one-third of the book—does not\n\noffer any fresh insights into his politics and policies. The connections\n\nbetween Laurier’s public and private lives are also left unexplained.\n\nWhat we are left with is some good storytelling but less than rigorous\n\nhistory."
