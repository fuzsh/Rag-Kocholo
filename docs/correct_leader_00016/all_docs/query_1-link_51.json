        "text": "Hear what experts have to say about Canada’s seventh prime minister during a scholarly evening commemorating the 175th anniversary of Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s birth.\n\nMark the 175th anniversary of Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s birth with a scholarly evening examining the historical significance of Canada’s seventh prime minister. Far more than just a familiar face on our five-dollar bill, Laurier earned his reputation as one of this country’s greatest statesmen, championing conciliation, individual liberty, greater autonomy from Britain, and a true partnership between English and French Canadians. Special guests Réal Bélanger and Éric Bédard will discuss Laurier’s private life, his political and public life, and his legacy. This event, of particular interest to adults and students with an interest in history and political science, will also showcase Laurier-related artifacts from the Museum collection.\n\nFrench presentation. English simultaneous translation available.\n\nPhoto: Marie-Louise Deruaz"
