        "text": "Introduction\n\nPreamble\n\nThis Strategic Mandate Agreement between the Ministry of Colleges and Universities and Wilfrid Laurier University is a key component of the Ontario government’s accountability framework for the postsecondary education system.\n\nThe Strategic Mandate Agreement (SMA):\n\noutlines provincial government objectives and priority areas for the postsecondary education system\n\ndescribes the elements of Ontario’s performance-based funding mechanism, including the university’s annual performance-based funding notional allocation for the five-year 2020 to 2025 Strategic Mandate Agreement (SMA3) period\n\nestablishes the corridor midpoint that will form the basis of enrolment-related funding over the five-year SMA3 period\n\nsupports transparency and accountability objectives\n\nestablishes allowable performance targets for 10 metrics upon which institutional performance will be assessed\n\nThis SMA is for the fiscal period from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2025.\n\nOntario’s objectives\n\nSMAs are bilateral agreements between the ministry and the province’s publicly-assisted colleges and universities and are a key component of the Ontario government’s accountability framework for the postsecondary education system. This cycle of agreements is focused on promoting accountability through transparency and a focus on performance outcomes. The following objectives underline SMA3:\n\nincreasing trust and accountability through transparency and improved performance outcomes in Ontario’s postsecondary education system\n\nreducing red tape by striking an appropriate balance between accountability and reporting through streamlined processes and a reduced number of metrics\n\nincentivizing colleges and universities to redirect resources and invest in initiatives that result in positive economic outcomes\n\nencouraging alignment of postsecondary education with labour market outcomes\n\nincentivizing differentiation and specialization to support increased efficiencies\n\nInstitutional profile\n\nThe ministry recognizes the importance of supporting a differentiated system, and recognizing institutional specializations, as a means of enhancing efficiencies in the postsecondary education sector.\n\nThe institutional profile is intended to describe how the university’s institutional mission and strategic goals support the priority areas of the Ontario government, as identified in this agreement. Institutions may also wish to include narrative related to the post-COVID-19 context for the institution.\n\nPerformance-based funding\n\nNotional annual allocation\n\nFor the SMA3 cycle, Wilfrid Laurier University’s annual allocation of performance-based funding has been calculated by the ministry in accordance with the university funding model and Ontario’s Performance-based Funding Technical Manual. Wilfrid Laurier University’s notional allocations will not be impacted by previous year performance, and will follow a graduated activation plan as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nDue to COVID-19 performance-based funding was delayed for 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023.\n\nThe planned system-wide proportion tied to funding (that is, Performance-based Grant) will be at 10% of system-wide total operating funding in Year 4 (2023–24) and 25% in Year 5 (2024–25).\n\nPrior to Year 4 (2023–24), the Performance-based Grant was capped at the system-average annual proportion determined for the Differentiation Envelope and residual funding above that cap remained part of the Differentiation Envelope.\n\nThe Differentiation Envelope has continued to grow steadily towards the established initial level of 60% by Year 5 (2024–25).\n\nIn Year 4 (2023–24), the 55% of operating funding assigned to the Differentiation Envelope is inclusive of the activated Performance-based Grant.\n\nNotional allocation represents the Performance-based Grant portion.\n\nThe notional allocations presented above are based on 2021–22 operating grant totals.\n\nInstitutional weighting strategy\n\nThe performance-based funding mechanism in this SMA enables institutions to assign metric weightings to reflect institutional strengths and differentiated roles in the postsecondary education system. Assigned metric weightings will impact performance-based funding on a metric-by-metric basis per the table below. Metric details are described in the following section.\n\nNotes:\n\nColleges and universities have the opportunity to re-weight their metrics every year as part of the Annual Evaluation process throughout the SMA3 period. For metrics activated later than Year 1, a year in brackets indicates the first year of data available.\n\nThe planned system-wide proportion tied to funding (that is, Performance-based Grant) will be at 10% of system-wide total operating funding in Year 4 (2023–24) and 25% in Year 5 (2024–25).\n\nPriority areas and performance metrics\n\nSummary\n\nTo support improved performance in key areas aligned with the Ontario government’s priorities and objectives, the allowable performance targets will be set against metrics that measure institutions’ effectiveness in addressing the evolving needs of the labour market, enhancing the skills and competencies of our students, and supporting a postsecondary education system that strengthens Ontario’s economic competitiveness.\n\nThe combination of established targets and assigned metric weightings will be used for institutional assessment of performance through the SMA3 Annual Evaluation process.\n\nSkills and job outcomes\n\nThis priority area seeks to measure and evaluate the university’s role in supporting student and graduate outcomes and alignment with Ontario’s economy. Metrics measure institutional commitment to areas of strength and specialization; students’ preparation with the skills essential for employment; experiential learning opportunities; graduation; and positive labour-market outcomes for graduates, through the following performance indicators:\n\ngraduate employment rate in a related field\n\ninstitutional strength and focus\n\ngraduation rate\n\ngraduate employment earnings\n\nexperiential learning\n\nskills and competencies\n\nEconomic and community impact\n\nThis priority area seeks to measure and evaluate the university’s role in supporting Ontario’s economy. Metrics measure the attraction of federal research funding; funding from private sector sources; the positive economic impact on local economies brought by students at an institution, and the differentiated ways institutions demonstrate economic impact, through the following performance indicators:\n\ncommunity and local impact of student enrolment\n\neconomic impact (institution-specific)\n\nresearch funding and capacity: federal tri-agency funding secured\n\nresearch revenue attracted from private sector sources\n\nProductivity, accountability and transparency\n\nThrough further engagement with the sector on metric refinement, a decision was made to remove this reporting and data collection requirement for institutions for the duration of the SMA3 period, to reduce reporting burden and duplication with other government initiatives.\n\nSkills and job outcomes\n\nPerformance metrics: narrative\n\nMetrics will be initiated over three years as new data is collected and validated. For 2020–21, allowable performance targets are calculated using historical data as per the Performance-based Funding Technical Manual.\n\nFor the remainder of the SMA3 cycle, allowable performance targets will be calculated annually as per the Performance-based Funding Technical Manual using the most recent historical data available for Wilfrid Laurier University and included as part of the SMA3 Annual Evaluation process for performance-based funding. See appendix for details regarding historical data and annual allowable performance targets.\n\nFor the skills and competencies metric being initiated for performance-based funding in 2022–23, the Ministry of Colleges and Universities will apply a ‘participation weighting’ of five % of annual performance-based funding notional allocations for all institutions. Institutional targets will not be set for this metric in SMA3. Participation will be validated and included as part of the SMA3 Annual Evaluation process for performance-based funding.\n\nGraduate employment rate in a related field\n\nDefinition: proportion of graduates of undergraduate (bachelor or first professional degree) programs employed full-time who consider their jobs either “closely” or “somewhat” related to the skills they developed in their university program, two years after graduation\n\nSource: Ministry of Colleges and Universities - Ontario University Graduate Survey\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nInstitutional strength and focus\n\nName: Strength and Focus in Arts and Sciences Programs\n\nDefinition: proportion of enrolment (Fall, full-time equivalents (FFTEs), domestic and international, all terms for undergraduate students and Summer and Fall terms for graduate students) in an institution’s program area(s) of strength\n\nSource: Provided by institutions, validated by University Statistical Enrolment Report (USER)/Ministry of Colleges and Universities\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nGraduation rate\n\nDefinition: proportion of all new, full-time, year one university students of undergraduate (bachelor or first professional degree) programs who commenced their study in a given fall term and graduated from the same institution within seven years\n\nSource: University Graduation Rate Data Collections\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nGraduate employment earnings\n\nDefinition: median employment earnings of university graduates, two years after graduation\n\nSource: Educational and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform, Statistics Canada\n\nMetric initiated: 2021–22\n\nExperiential learning\n\nDefinition: Number and proportion of graduates in programs, who participated in at least one course with required Experiential Learning (EL) component(s)\n\nSource: Institutions\n\nMetric initiated: 2021–22\n\nSkills and competencies\n\nName: Senior Undergraduate Students’ Gains in Transferable Skills\n\nDefinition: This metric measures senior undergraduate students' gains in a set of transferable skills, including writing, speaking, analyzing numerical and statistical information, thinking critically, working effectively with others, understanding people of other backgrounds, developing personal cores of values and ethics, acquiring job-related skills, solving real-world problems, and being active and informed citizens.\n\nSource: National Survey of Student Engagement\n\nMetric initiated: 2022–23\n\nThrough the fall 2021 engagement with the sector, a decision was made to forgo using the Education and Skills Online (ESO) tool for the Skills and Competencies metric in order to provide more flexibility to institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ministry will allow institutions to select an institution-specific measure of skills and competencies that aligns with ministry-established criteria or choose from the ministry’s pre-approved list. The Skills and Competencies metric will be updated as part of the SMA3 Year 3 Annual Evaluation process.\n\nEconomic and community impact\n\nPerformance metrics: narrative\n\nMetrics will be initiated over three years as new data is collected and validated. For 2020–21, allowable performance targets are calculated using historical data as per the Performance-based Funding Technical Manual.\n\nFor the remainder of the SMA3 cycle, allowable performance targets will be calculated annually as per the Performance-based Funding Technical Manual using the most recent historical data available for Wilfrid Laurier University and included as part of the SMA3 Annual Evaluation process for performance-based funding. See appendix for details regarding historical data and annual allowable performance targets.\n\nCommunity and local impact of student enrolment\n\nDefinition: Institutional enrolment share in the population of the city (cities) or town (towns) in which the institution is located\n\nSource: University Statistical Enrolment Report (USER), Ministry of Colleges and Universities, Census Data, Statistics Canada\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nEconomic impact (institution-specific)\n\nName: Laurier Graduating Students' Impact on the Ontario Economy\n\nDefinition: For each year, the number of students who graduate from Laurier who are staying to work in Ontario multipled by the average salary as per Laurier's Annual Graduate Outcomes Survey\n\nSource: Laurier's Annual Graduate Outcomes Survey\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nResearch funding and capacity: federal tri-agency funding secured\n\nDefinition: Amount and proportion of funding received by institution from federal research granting agencies (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) in total tri-agency funding received by Ontario universities\n\nSource: Tri-Agency Institutional Programs Secretariat\n\nMetric initiated: 2020–21\n\nResearch revenue attracted from private sector sources\n\nDefinition: Research revenue attracted from private sector sources\n\nSource: Council of Ontario Finance Officers (COFO)\n\nMetric initiated: 2021–22\n\nProductivity, accountability and transparency\n\nThrough further engagement with the sector on metric refinement, a decision was made to remove this reporting and data collection requirement for institutions for the duration of the SMA3 period, to reduce reporting burden and duplication with other government initiatives.\n\nEnrolment profile\n\nIn addition to the performance-based funding outlined in sections above, institutions will receive enrolment-related funding through a funded corridor ‘midpoint’ to provide funding predictability to institutions. These enrolment corridor midpoints for universities were established as part of the 2017–20 Strategic Mandate Agreements (SMA2), and account for adjustments related to graduate expansion and teacher education achieved targets.\n\nCorridor midpoint\n\nFor funding purposes 33,642.08 Weighted Grant Units (WGUs) will be the corridor midpoint value for the five-year period from 2020–25 for Wilfrid Laurier University. Enrolment-related funding will be distributed consistent with this level of enrolment and subject to the funding framework set out in the Ontario University Funding Formula Reform Technical Manual, May 2017, Version 1.0. Funding eligible enrolments are defined by the Ontario Operating Funds Distribution Manual.\n\nNote: the midpoints presented in this table were established using final 2019–20 enrolment data.\n\nProjected funding-eligible enrolment\n\nNote: tables report on Fiscal Full-Time Equivalents (FFTE). These include all terms for undergraduate students and Fall and Summer terms for graduate students.\n\nBelow is Wilfrid Laurier University’s projection of funding-eligible enrolments as of February 28, 2020.\n\nProjected international enrolment\n\nBelow is Wilfrid Laurier University’s projection of funding-ineligible international student enrolments as of February 28, 2020.\n\nAppendix: historical data, targets and results\n\nThe following table will be refreshed annually by the ministry to display results from SMA3 Annual Evaluation process and update Allowable Performance Targets (APT) for the current year. The SMA3 Annual Evaluation will occur every year in the Fall-Winter and the updated appendix will be made publicly available the following Spring. Please note that fields with a hyphen indicate where data will be populated in later years of SMA3.\n\nIt should be noted that historical data reflects pre-COVID-19 context. Actual values achieved during the SMA3 period may include COVID-19 pandemic impacts.\n\nNote: The value in the 2020–21 Actual performance column of “Experiential learning “(row 7) was not tied to performance as this metric was not activated. It is included in the calculation of the 2022–23 Allowable Performance Targets.\n\nNotes:"
