        "text": "Welcome to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI), Canada’s only truly national public policy think tank based in Ottawa.\n\nMLI is rigorously independent and non-partisan, as symbolized by its name. Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier were two outstanding and long-serving prime ministers who represent the best of Canada’s distinguished political tradition. A Tory and a Grit, an English-speaker and a French-speaker, each of them championed the values that led to the creation of Canada and its emergence as one of the world’s leading democracies and a place where people may live in peace and freedom under the rule of law.\n\nOur ideas drive the national conversation:\n\nMLI is the most cited think-tank in Canada’s parliament and our experts are routinely called upon to testify at parliamentary committee.\n\nOur columns and op-eds appear in the national and international media on average once a day.\n\nCanada’s adversaries fear the MLI spotlight which is why we have been blacklisted by both the Kremlin and Beijing.\n\nOur goal is to be an indispensable source of reasoned and timely thought leadership for policymakers, opinion leaders, and Canadians at-large. We want to help make Canada the best governed country in the world.\n\nOur work includes:\n\nInitiating and conducting research identifying current and emerging economic and public policy issues facing Canadians, including, but not limited to, research into defence and security, foreign policy, immigration, economic and fiscal policy, Canada-US relations, regulatory policy, regional development, social policy and aboriginal affairs;\n\nInvestigating and analysing the full range of options for public and private sector responses to the issues identified and to act as a catalyst for informed debate on those options;\n\nCommunicating the conclusions of our work to a national audience in a clear, non-partisan way;\n\nSponsoring or organizing conferences, meetings, seminars, lectures, training programs and publications using all media of communication (including without restriction, the electronic media), for the purposes of achieving these objects;\n\nTo read MLI’s Statement And Resolution Regarding The Independence Of The Institute’s Research Effort, click here."
