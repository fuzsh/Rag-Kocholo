One bow echo moved through Monroe County MO a spawned 3 non-supercell tornadoes. Two people were killed with one of the tornadoes. Another non-supercell tornado occurred over parts of northern Callaway County Missouri. We plan to further look into this case during the next few months. The 2 April 2006 tornadic QLCS webpage has been further expanded to include the early evolution of the mesoscale Rear Inflow Jet. Several WSR-88D images have been constructed through the Warning Decision Support System -II (WDSS-II) software system from the National Severe Storms Laboratory. (NSSL). This webpage is located in the \"Classification of QLCSs\" under Damaging Winds page. This webpage will be further expanded with time. We plan to publish to papers in 2008: 1) Study of the 06 May 2003 HP - bow echo high end wind event (Sieveking and Przybylinski), and 2) Study of the 2 April 2006 tornadic QLCS system (Przybylinski, Sieveking, Schmocker and Dr. Nolan Atkins from Lyndon State College). Lead Forecasters Mark Britt and Fred Glass continues to work on environmental conditions associated with \"Cool Season\" tornado events.\n\n04/25/2007 - A few more new graphics have been included in the Classification of QLCSs page. One of the new graphics is a scatter plot of the magnitude of rotational velocities (Vr values) of non-supercell tornadic mesovoriticies and non-tornadic mesovortices. Eleven tornadic cases have been sampled at this time. Additional cases will be added. All mesovortices were sampled within 120 KM of the WSR-88D KLSX Doppler radar here in St. Louis. The initial Vr threshold value for tornadogenesis within this range appeared to be 17 m s-1. However 3 mesovortices did not spawn a tornado when Vr values were between 17 and 19 m s-1. When Vr values reached or exceeded 20 m s-1 tornadogenesis occurred.\n\n02/16/2007 - A number of graphs including Damage Wind Frequency and Tornado occurrence with Quasi-Linear Convective Systems have been updated to include the 2006 convective season. You can find these graphs under Damaging Wind Studies -(Classification of QLCSs) and (MCS Monthly Distribution). Additional graphs will continue to be updated.

Except for one supercell episode, all of the events have spawned weak tornadoes, hail of various sizes (up to 2 inches) and damaging winds. We have conducted field damage surveys in six of the seven events. In one of the supercell cases, 6 tornadoes appeared to form along the leading edge of the storm's southern flank (rear flank downdraft). In two of the four non-supercell cases, a low-level boundary appeared to have intersected the developing bow echo. Strong circulations occurred at or near this intersection spawning tornadoes. The other two non-supercell cases were very challenging where tornadoes occurred at or just north of the apex of the developing bow. Check out Storm Damage Survey or Recent Events links for damage survey information. More information on these recent events will be shown on these web pages in Science News.\n\n03/14/2002 - Presentations on Convective Mode / Convective Indicies.
