        "text": "Margaret Price Dies at 69, Soprano With Rich Voice\n\nBy ZACHARY WOOLFE\n\nPublished in The New York Times, February 1, 2011\n\nMargaret Price, the Welsh soprano who brought a voice of pure, floating richness to lieder and the operas of Mozart and Verdi, died on Friday in Wales. She was 69.\n\nHer death was confirmed by Paul Jenkins, a funeral home director. The BBC reported that she died of heart failure at her home near Cardigan, overlooking the Irish Sea.\n\nMs. Price was known for the clear beauty of her voice and the modest eloquence of her interpretations. After a recital at Carnegie Hall in 1985, Tim Page wrote in The New York Times, “Her voice has both majesty and intimacy — an all but impossible combination — and her artistry seems capable of illuminating every human truth.”\n\nMargaret Berenice Price was born on April 13, 1941, in Blackwood, Wales. Her father was an amateur pianist who would accompany his daughter in songs when she was young but opposed the idea of a singing career, and she initially planned on becoming a biology teacher. Her music teacher interceded and brought her to audition at Trinity College for the eminent choral conductor Charles Kennedy Scott, who offered her admission on the spot.\n\nShe began her career as a mezzo-soprano, making her operatic debut in 1962 as Cherubino in Mozart’s “Marriage of Figaro” at the Welsh National Opera. Her audition for London’s Royal Opera House featured the unlikely combination of Cherubino’s charming “Voi che sapete” and the seething “O don fatale” from Verdi’s “Don Carlo.” It was these two composers, if not these parts, with whom she became most closely associated.\n\nThe company hired her as an understudy, over the objections of the music director, Georg Solti, but in June 1963 she had a career breakthrough when she replaced an indisposed Teresa Berganza as Cherubino.\n\nShe developed her luminous upper register and gradually moved into the soprano repertoire under the guidance of James Lockhart, the conductor and accompanist with whom she had a long professional and personal relationship.\n\nShe sang her first Verdi role, Nanetta in “Falstaff,” in Wales in 1969, the same year she made her American debut in San Francisco as Pamina in “The Magic Flute.” She sang for the first time in Cologne as Donna Anna in “Don Giovanni” in 1971, the beginning of several happy years when her career was based there.\n\nIn 1973 Ms. Price made her debut at the Paris Opera, where she sang two of the roles that would become her trademarks: Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello” and the Countess in “The Marriage of Figaro.” She performed both parts in the company’s acclaimed 1976 American tour.\n\nShe made a belated debut at the Metropolitan Opera, as Desdemona, in 1985, and returned as Elisabetta in “Don Carlo” in 1989. She spent much of the later years of her career in Munich, where she lived and where the Bavarian State Opera gave her the title “Kammersängerin,” honoring her service to the company. She was made a dame of the British Empire in 1993.\n\nDespite her success in opera, her great love was lieder, and she released classic recordings of songs by Brahms, Schubert, Mahler and others. She preferred piano accompanists to conductors, whom she called “my pet hates,” but she worked closely with some of the century’s greatest, from Otto Klemperer, who cast her in the small role of Barbarina in his 1970 recording of “The Marriage of Figaro” and as Fiordiligi in his 1972 “Così Fan Tutte,” to Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti. And long after he expressed reservations about her in those first Covent Garden auditions, Georg Solti collaborated with her on several performances and recordings.\n\nIn 1982, Carlos Kleiber cast her against type as a radiant Isolde in his recording of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde,” which became one of her best-loved performances, though she never attempted the role onstage. Indeed, Ms. Price chose her parts carefully and retired them promptly when she outgrew them.\n\nShe left her core repertory — the Mozart heroines and four or five Verdi roles — only for Adriana Lecouvreur and Strauss’s Ariadne. The single role she regretted never trying was Lady Macbeth, and a Covent Garden “Norma” in 1987 was a rare misstep.\n\nMs. Price leaves no immediate survivors; her younger brother died several years ago. A shy, down-to-earth woman, she retired in 1999 to the Welsh coast, where she taught a few students and bred golden retrievers.\n\nShe professed not to miss singing at all, and was unsentimental when reviewing her career. Though Mr. Kleiber asked her to do it, she never sang the nostalgic Marschallin in Strauss’s “Rosenkavalier.” “That whole thing about turning the clock back,” she called it with mock disgust. She could never identify with that kind of regret."
