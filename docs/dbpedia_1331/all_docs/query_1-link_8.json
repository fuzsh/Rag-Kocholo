        "text": "Discussion\n\nAnimal models have long been used for determining disease mechanisms and drug discovery (Bolker, 2012). Low success in clinical trials, particularly in the field of sepsis therapy, led to skepticism regarding the predictivity of animal models (Cohen et al, 2015). Additionally, controversial discussions were provoked by the very different conclusions drawn from the same data after applying differing data analysis strategies (Seok et al, 2013; Shay et al, 2015; Takao & Miyakawa, 2015; Warren et al, 2015). Thus, robust and reliable bioinformatics techniques are needed for the analysis of complex “omics” data to systematically identify the optimal animal model for a given human disorder. Notably, an optimal model assessment contributes to animal welfare because it can help avoid overinterpretation and unnecessary repetition of animal experiments that might not correlate with the human situation.\n\nOne major critique of the data analysis strategy proposed by Takao & Miyakawa (2015), which concluded that “genomic responses in mouse models greatly mimic human inflammatory diseases”, was the restriction to a few genes that were differentially expressed in both species (Warren et al, 2015). We extended this strategy to additional human and mouse datasets (Table 1 in Seok et al, 2013) that were not considered by Takao and Miyakawa. The correlation analysis confirmed significant correlations for most of the intra‐ and interspecies comparisons (121 out of 137 with P < 0.05, Appendix Fig S2). Apparently, the single‐gene approach used by Takao and Miyakawa tended to overestimate the correlations between mouse and human data because only overlapping differentially expressed genes were compared to one another, and all relevant information from the other genes involved in inflammation was skipped. Consequently, this approach did not allow the identification of mouse models that better mimicked human disease. Notably, this data‐handling strategy is not appropriate for multiple hypothesis correction because it will yield very few genes for some dataset correlations. These limitations and the discrepancy between the opposite conclusions drawn by Seok et al (2013), who concluded that a poor correlation existed between humans and mice, disclose a strong need for more standardized and unbiased data analysis strategies.\n\nGene set enrichment analysis overcomes the aforementioned limitations of traditional gene‐to‐gene interpretations because it makes use of a “no‐cutoff” strategy by including all experimental information, irrespective of the magnitude of the signal changes. Thus, GSEA avoids arbitrary factors during gene selection and includes information from the majority of the many thousands of transcripts detected in biological samples (da Huang et al, 2009). After assigning the detected transcripts to biological pathways, GSEA uses nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov enrichment statistics to estimate the regulation of these pathways. These set enrichment approaches have been shown to be more robust for comparisons of transcriptomic data between different platforms or with different experimental models or clinical cohorts (Spinelli et al, 2015). Therefore, these approaches are currently recommended for data analysis for human risk assessment of chemicals and may lead to reductions in animal use in toxicological research (National Research Council (US), 2007; Pielaat et al, 2013; European Food Safety Authority, 2014). Using GSEA, we were able to identify particular mouse models (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus injection and the CLP model) that showed inflammatory pathway regulation profiles that were similar to the human situation; notably, most of these pathways are currently promising clinical targets in several inflammatory disorders. Nevertheless, from the clinical outcome, it is known that sepsis (in contrast to other inflammatory disorders) is a complex syndrome involving both pro‐inflammatory (early phase) and anti‐inflammatory (later phase) responses (Hotchkiss et al, 2009). Addressing this complex biphasic pathogenesis may require more than suppression of the pro‐inflammatory processes. Instead, recent studies have indicated that inhibiting the sepsis‐induced apoptosis of immune cells that caused lethal immunosuppression was the appropriate strategy for the treatment of severe sepsis (Hotchkiss & Opal, 2010; Fink & Warren, 2014). Taking the complex biphasic pathogenesis of sepsis into consideration, the recruitment of participants and the selection of adequate time points to define the septic model are of high importance. The same is true for the preclinical murine model.\n\nWe agree with Warren et al (2015) that drugs physically work at the molecular level (e.g., by binding to specific proteins). However, increasing evidence from genetic and molecular biology studies has shown that cellular processes and pathways are generally not affected by the alteration of a single gene or protein but instead are the result of alterations to a group of interacting proteins. This issue highlights the importance of analyzing signaling networks involved in diseases and their underlying biological processes (Yu et al, 2015). Consequently, the current pharmacological strategy is to modulate a specific pathway or parts of a pathway involved in immune processes, and pathway‐focused strategies are valuable approaches for the identification of relevant therapeutic targets. The proceeding steps inevitably include the definition of possible key players in the relevant pathways. We were able to identify a list of genes involved in the Toll‐like receptor cascade (Reactome) pathway (Table EV1) that were upregulated in at least 9 of 11 datasets where the human and mouse inflammatory studies were significantly correlated. For instance, congruently upregulated genes included the CD14 molecule, the lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein (LBP), and the Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4, 6, and 8. CD14 is an accessory receptor for TLRs, and ongoing clinical trials indicate that CD14 inhibition is a promising strategy to treat sepsis (Verbon et al, 2001; Egge et al, 2015). Furthermore, LBP is an acute‐phase biomarker for sepsis (Schumann & Zweigner, 1999), and the TLR family was recently reported to be a promising target for the treatment of sepsis (Savva & Roger, 2013).\n\nSeok et al (2013) and Takao & Miyakawa (2015) analyzed the treatment or disease effects at the genome‐wide level to evaluate the capacity of mouse models to mimic human inflammatory diseases. Despite the given limitations (Shay et al, 2015), such as the differing cellular compositions (i.e., lymphoid to myeloid ratio) of humans and mice, and the treatment effects in humans that were ignored, the aim of both studies was to gain a deeper understanding of the conserved effects between humans and mice on the molecular level. Notably, most of these candidate genes are excluded from traditional gene‐to‐gene analyses due to their moderate expression changes. Therefore, the gene set enrichment analysis presented here offers a valuable tool for drug target identification.\n\nUsing GSEA, we were able to provide more detailed information. We can certainly conclude that biologically relevant parts of “genomic responses in mouse models mimic human inflammatory diseases” (Seok et al, 2013; Takao & Miyakawa, 2015) despite these limitations in the datasets. Our analysis supports the assumption that the identification of new pharmacological targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases does not necessarily require the complete comparison of the whole transcriptomes of human samples with the transcriptomes from mouse models (as also discussed by Shay et al, 2015). Instead, it is likely imperative for pharmacological target identification to focus on a particular (patho)physiological process. Therefore, it is necessary (i) to identify regulated pathways and molecules that are exactly shared between the given human disorder and experimental mouse models and (ii) to identify the best mouse model for that human disorder (e.g., burn or sepsis). We emphasize that the GSEA approach will not overcome some basic difficulties in developing the appropriate animal model before any (transcript)omics data have been generated from this model. Generally, similar agents are used in both humans and mice to induce diseases with similar phenotypes. The same holds true for the introduction of genetic defects that target species homologs. This phenomenon does not reflect the possible variety of outcomes resulting from the diversity of biological processes across species barriers (i.e., mechanisms of adaptation, different pharmacokinetics upon gene deletion or treatment with similar triggers/inducers). Importantly, GSEA is not a tool to predict how to a priori design new model systems, but it is an effective tool to decide how to interpret existing data in a standardized manner, which might add value to the careful selection of the correct animal model and might avoid unnecessary and misleading translational studies.\n\nCurrently, 241 mouse strains are available at The Jackson Laboratories to investigate “infectious diseases”. This number reflects only a small fraction of all inflammatory mouse models that are either experimentally induced or genetically modified. Inbred mouse strains that provide a basis for subsequent disease models are highly divergent in their immune response patterns as a result of genetic mutations and polymorphisms (Sellers et al, 2012). Knowledge of these genetic profiles is essential for the accurate selection of disease models. Therefore, adequate model assessment is one of the most critical factors for success in translational research for the selection of either already existing disease models or the appropriate laboratory strain genetic background to facilitate further disease model development. We believe that the use of previously published datasets, ongoing discussions on experimental improvements (Shay et al, 2015), as well as targeted strategies for model assessment and the gene set enrichment analyses described here have great potential to systematically define the optimal mouse model and protocol for a given human disorder (and are not restricted to immunological studies). These resources should be increasingly used to improve the success of translational research and to reduce the number of animal studies. Indeed, the recent debate concerning failed clinical trials linked to inappropriate animal models demands a re‐evaluation of the respective mouse models and the utilization of the growing availability of transcriptomics data and systems biology approaches.\n\nThe current discussion on different approaches and algorithms clearly discloses a general limitation of genomic studies: the bioinformatics analyses are not well standardized, and the resulting conclusions are prone to bias. If the same sets of experimental data can lead to diametrically opposite conclusions, then the relevance and outcome of genomic (and other “omics”) studies for purposes other than explorative approaches are negligible and strongly require improvement. Thus, better standardization of statistical analyses and data interpretation are urgently needed and should be addressed to improve the use of omics data for regulatory purposes (National Research Council (US), 2007; Pielaat et al, 2013; European Food Safety Authority, 2014)."
