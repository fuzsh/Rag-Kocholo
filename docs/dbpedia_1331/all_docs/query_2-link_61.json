We asked ourselves this question at Atlassian, and the answer is an entirely new way for organizations to plan, collaborate, and learn.\n\nAdvancements never happen when everyone does the same thing the same way. Embracing the diversity of thought, ways of working, and ways of being is the new competitive edge. Learn how the innovative approaches of Jira and Confluence break new ground for how work gets done, and how the progress that would otherwise be impossible alone becomes reality. With Atlassian, your best work is waiting.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nAtlassian is the only project management and collaboration platform that unites all teams.\n\nJira and Confluence are the only products that truly connect business teams and outcomes to product development.\n\nOrganization performance comes from teams working well up, down, and across the organization. Join WPP and explore how networks of teams do great work and what happens when we introduce AI. How can we unleash the potential of teams in the future and what will specialized intelligent team members bring to help teams do their best work?\n\nBash is going offsite for Team ’24!
