        "text": "Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (Krystal et al., 2019). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD (Murrough et al., 2013; Hack et al., 2021). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects (e.g. NMDA receptor occupancy) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms (Murrough et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2008). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine.\n\nKetamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients (i.e. relying on the power of central tendency) to ascertain ketamine’s effects. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine produces transient changes in behavior, perception, and cognition that are comparable to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms seen in patients with psychosis-spectrum illness (Krystal et al., 1994). Therefore, ketamine’s acute behavioral effects are typically captured using psychosis-related scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), as well as cognitive tasks (Anticevic et al., 2012). However, the acute neural effects of subanesthetic of ketamine are less clear. The majority of studies exploring ketamine’s neural alterations have used seed-based approaches, which often result in contradictory results and are fundamentally limited by the required a-priori selection of a seed region and an inability to fully capture ketamine’s systems-level alterations (Scheidegger et al., 2012; Niesters et al., 2012; Dandash et al., 2015; Grimm et al., 2015; Höflich et al., 2015; Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015; Bonhomme et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2016; Kraguljac et al., 2017; Liebe et al., 2018; Mueller et al., 2018; Fleming et al., 2019; Hack et al., 2021; Cole et al., 2010; Fitzgerald, 2012). For instance, studies have identified both ketamine-induced increases and decreases in thalamo-cortical and hippocampal-cortical activity (Höflich et al., 2015; Hack et al., 2021; Grimm et al., 2015; Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015; Kraguljac et al., 2017). There is evidence that these inconsistencies may stem in part from a failure to account for individual differences in ketamine response. Ketamine has demonstrated dose-dependent individual variability in thalamic functional connectivity in healthy adults, with some individuals showing dose-dependent increases in functional connectivity, and others showing decreases (Hack et al., 2021).\n\nA limited number of studies have also characterised ketamine’s neural systems-level functional alterations using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating that ketamine results in robust brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity (GBC) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy controls specifically, and normalize the reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hr post-ketamine (Anticevic et al., 2015; Abdallah et al., 2017; Abdallah et al., 2018). However, this finding failed to replicate in patients with depression 48 hr post-ketamine (Kraus et al., 2020), suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine’s acute and delayed effects. In addition to GBC, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum (Joules et al., 2015). Meanwhile, a nodal predictive model found ketamine resulted in reduced connectivity within the primary cortices and the executive network, but increased connectivity between the executive network and the rest of brain (Abdallah et al., 2021). Finally, dynamic resting-state functional connectivity showed that ketamine decreased connectivity both within the left visual network and inter-hemispherically between the visual networks (Spies et al., 2019). However, these studies also fail to account for individual differences in response to ketamine.\n\nThe main limitation of relying on the power of central tendency is that meaningful differences between individual subjects may be lost through the process of averaging. One method that has been used to successfully address this and uncover individual differences in psychiatric research is a principal component analysis (PCA) (Ji et al., 2020; Halai et al., 2017). A PCA is a data-driven method that is able to uncover both group-level and individual-level differences. More specifically, a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional: if ketamine’s effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped; however if there are systemic differences between participants, we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components. A PCA is also able to capture individual-level differences through an individual’s relative positioning along the axes of the principal components (Halai et al., 2017).\n\nIn order to assess the relative merits of characterizing ketamine’s acute effects using a uni-dimensional (i.e. mean-level) or multi-dimensional (i.e. PCA) approach, we will compare which results best relate to ketamine’s hypothesized molecular mechanisms. We will focus on the indirect hypothesis, which posits that ketamine first inhibits tonic-firing GABAergic interneurons via NMDAR blockade, leading to a burst of glutamate that drives synaptic plasticity (Gerhard et al., 2020). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that individual differences in ketamine’s neural systems-level effects are associated with SST and PVALB GABAergic interneurons by correlating ketamine’s neural effects with SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps derived from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). SST and PVALB genes were selected a-priori based on: (i) the large body of animal literature directly linking SST and PVALB interneurons to ketamine’s acute effects (Gerhard et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2018; Picard et al., 2019); (ii) studies showing SST and PVALB interneurons are particularly sensitive to ketamine as a result of their NMDA receptor subunit configuration (Paoletti et al., 2013); (iii) previous research showing that specific cortical regions express different ratios of SST and PVALB interneurons, with SST showing higher expression levels in association relative to sensory regions, while PVALB shows the reverse pattern (Anderson et al., 2020; Hawrylycz et al., 2012); and (iv) studies demonstrating patients with depression show reduced SST or PVALB interneurons in areas such as the hippocampus and PFC (Nowak et al., 2010; Zadrożna et al., 2011; Czeh et al., 2005; Czéh et al., 2015). Given that many different genes show similar spatial patterns in the brain, with the most common pattern explaining approximately 25% of the total gene expression variance (Burt et al., 2018), it is important to note that by relating ketamine’s neural effects to SST and PVALB cortical gene expression patterns we do not make any claims regarding gene specificity. Instead, we use the established relationship between ketamine and SST/PVALB interneurons to evaluate the relative merits of assessing ketamine’s acute effects using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach."
