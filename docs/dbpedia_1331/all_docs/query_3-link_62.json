        "text": "Product Hub X Summer: Rooftop Edition Summer is finally here!! Tysha and I were especially excited for this month's meetup because we were able to bring our community to \"new heights\", both figuratively and literally, for the first time last week - to a stunning rooftop in NYC's Meatpacking District! The event took place on a fourth-floor terrace near the High Line, providing PH folks with the opportunity to enjoy a *perfect* summer evening of connecting, product-focused and beyond. I am genuinely happy that our community continues to thrive and grow organically. We had quite a diverse group this time - a mix of in-state, out-of-state, and international attendees, people who found out about the event from their colleagues outside of NYC, investors looking to build their teams, PH regulars who have become friends, friends from other tech communities, and even people who discovered us through reposts on other organizations such as Women in Product. The energy was so amazing that overstayed by almost 1.5 hours past the scheduled time and even went to get tacos at Chelsea Market nearby. If you were able to join us, I hope you enjoyed the rooftop this month (if you did - please let us know!) and that Product Hub has helped you make some genuine friends in the field! Look forward to an announcement soon about next month's event on August 1 as we continue our rooftop summer series ‚òÄÔ∏è Thank you üôè..

Sonny Tieu Steven Gittens Ebonee Ragins, MA, NBC-HWC Ekene Nnanyelugoh Keino Chichester Hiwotie Deres Ningdan ZHANG Yuhan Wang Shichen (Susan) Qi Valerie Nguyen Jing Tong Sarah LeQuire Reginald Amedee and to anyone who've attended our events or supported in any way. Hope to see you next month!\n\nAnother successful Product Hub event in the books! At our May event, \"May the network be with you\", the NYC product community representing various industries and backgrounds came together at Sour Mouse in NYC for an evening of meaningful connections and conversations! I want to extend a warm welcome to the new faces who joined us for the first time and a heartfelt thanks to the regulars of our growing community (shout out to those nyc code and coffee folks who continue to support!) ü´∂. Our goal was and always has been to cultivate a supportive and inclusive space for product professionals can develop authentic relationships with each other. It was incredible to see the energy and enthusiasm in the room, with many attendees staying well past the official 9pm end time, still deeply engaged in conversation! I am also grateful to everyone who took the time to attend, some traveling from considerable distances. Your presence and support are what make these gatherings so special and rewarding. Save the date for our next event on June 27th!Tysha and I are working hard to secure an exciting new venue to keep things fresh for our group. If you have any suggestions for a great location, please don't hesitate to reach out ‚Äì your input is always valued! Can‚Äôt wait to see you next month!

Salimochi #networking #productmanagement #NYCtech #community\n\nWe took the community's feedback to heart and brought NYC Code & Coffee back together for a meetup in Manhattan last Sunday. This time, we chose a spacious venue with a beautiful rooftop (thank you to @TheYard! ) to make the most of the lovely summer weather and enjoy the incredible NYC skyline. Even though I couldn't attend in person, it was clear from the photos that everyone had a great time connecting with each other in this new setting! If you enjoyed it and want us to continue hosting our events here, please let me or the other fellow co-organizers know!\n\nLast Friday, I had the privilege of attending the Power to Pursue conference in Cincinnati's majestic Music Hall. The conference aimed to empower attendees, instilling in them the belief that they have the power to pursue their dreams and passions. Throughout the day, I attended various insightful talks and jotted down some notes that truly resonated with me: - Connection is not just about physical proximity; it's about the quality of the time and experiences we share. When building relationships, focus on creating truly meaningful and thoughtful interactions. - Be willing to start. Embrace the courage to take that first step, knowing that it is one of the most important parts of any journey. - \"JOMO\". On the flip side of FOMO, there is the joy in missing out. Recognize that you cannot do everything, and that's okay. Prioritize activities that align with your short-term and long-term goals, ensuring that your time and energy are invested wisely. - ASK! If you don't ask, you won't get. Be fearless in expressing your needs, desires, and aspirations. Advocate for yourself and seize opportunities that come your way. - Don't equate business to progress. We are ALL busy, regardless of age or life stage. Distinguish between activities that keep you occupied and those that truly contribute to your growth and advancement. - ÊîπÂñÑ. Adopt the concept \"kaizen\" or continuous improvement. Strive for small, incremental enhancements in your life every single day. These seemingly minor changes can compound over time, leading to significant personal and professional growth. The Power to Pursue conference served as a powerful reminder to me that we are stronger together. By building community, we can empower one another to overcome obstacles, pursue our passions, and create the lives we desire ‚ú®\n\nLast night's Product Hub event, \"April Showers Bring May Powers,\" was a fantastic evening of connection! Tysha and I are truly grateful for the support from our amazing community ‚Äì both familiar faces and those joining us for the first time. It was great meeting and reconnecting with each and everyone of you! üòä Many people are surprised to learn that Product Hub is only five months old, but when there's a real need, things can grow quickly. People often ask me, \"Why did you start this?\" The answer is simple ‚Äì tech, and especially product management, can be isolating. We spend hours staring at screens, and even in offices or at events, we can be physically close but digitally disconnected. Product Hub was created to build an in-person community of friendship and learning for everyone, whether you're working in product at a large company or you're the only PM at a startup. It's about fostering connections and knowledge sharing that goes beyond industry, experience, and company size. When we first started, we expected a small turnout, but the great response shows how much people value face to face connection! In fact, this event reached capacity, and we had to close registration. Tysha and I are excited for the future of Product Hub! We're planning to explore new venues as the weather gets warmer and create even more opportunities for the product community to connect, learn, and grow together. A special shoutout to our amazing volunteer team Melissa Corey Gregory Mizii and Pablo Scherman! Couldn't have done it without you üôè and once again, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us yesterday! We sincerely hope you had a wonderful time at our event! Raphael Husbands Eva C.

Jose Garcia Jacob williams Reginald Amedee Details about our next meetup, happening on May 30th will be posted soon. Hope to see you there!\n\nLast Thursday's Product Hub was our best one yet! We were even a featured NYC event on lu.ma! ‚ú® Tysha and I have achieved some impressive milestones in just four months...our community has grown to nearly 900 members, we consistently have over 150 RSVPs across all platforms for each event, and we've earned a 4.6 out of 5 rating based on 39 reviews. We've also expanded our event listings to include lu.ma, supermomos and eventbrite, in addition to meetup. However, the most important milestone for me is that we've had folks return to multiple events, and many have come up to us to express that our events are the best product-focused gatherings they've ever attended ü•π. A big thank you to our dedicated volunteers, Melissa Corey, Pablo Scherman, and Gregory Mizii as well as our resident photographer, Jada, and of course, to everyone who've attended for your support!‚ù§Ô∏è üôè At the last event, Tysha and I arrived early to set up, and we were soon joined by a community of product managers, product designers, developers, startup founders, and professionals from both tech and non-tech backgrounds. The event provided an opportunity for folks to engage in conversations, community building, and professional networking. Despite the official start time of 5:30 pm, many attendees stayed until 9 pm, and the venue even transitioned into a live music event afterward. It was a pleasure to meet and catch up with everyone who attended üòä Charlene T. Raphael Husbands Rakibat Abiola Valerie Nguyen Eva C. Kyle Miers James O.
