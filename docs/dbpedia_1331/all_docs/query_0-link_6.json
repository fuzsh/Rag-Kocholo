        "text": "Program Overview\n\nThe major in Computer Science enables a student to develop an understanding of the theory and practice of computing within the context of a liberal arts and sciences education.\n\nIn addition to computer programming, majors in computer science study computer languages, logic, data structures, and applications of computing. The art and science of problem-solving are emphasized.\n\nStudents who desire a more scientific emphasis will complete the College of Arts and Sciences requirements for a B.S. degree; the computer science requirements for the B.A. and B.S. degrees are the same.\n\nAll programs are to be planned in careful consultation with a departmental advisor and be approved by that advisor.\n\nCurriculum Requirements\n\nBachelor of Arts (B.A.) with a major in Computer Science\n\nBachelor of Science (B.S.) with a major in Computer Science\n\nComputer Science minor\n\nCybersecurity minor\n\nVisit the Undergraduate Catalog for more information about these majors and minors.\n\nBachelor of Arts Degree Requirements\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts degree is intended for students who desire less of a scientific emphasis. Students who desire more of a scientific emphasis should consider the Bachelor of Science degree. All programs are to be planned in careful consultation with a departmental advisor and be approved by that advisor.\n\nCourse Credits Core Courses 23 CS 065 - Introduction to Computer Science I 3 CS 066 - Introduction to Computer Science II 3 CS 067- Object-Oriented Programming 3 CS 083- Computer Ethics 3 CS 130 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming 3 CS 137 - Algorithm Analysis 3 CS 188 - Software Engineering 3 CS 191 - The Capstone Course 3 MATH 050 - Calculus I 3 MATH 054 - Introduction to Discrete Mathematics, or\n\nMATH 101 - Mathematical Reasoning 3 Upper Division Component 15 Computer Science Upper Division Component - 9 hours from the following: 9 Other computer science courses numbered 100 or above, excluding CS 140, the tutoring course, and the Capstone course IS 145 - Website Technology IS 150 - Network Management IS 160 - Database Management Additional Upper Division Component - 6 hours from the following: 6 Other computer science courses numbered 100 or above, excluding CS 140, the tutoring course, and the Capstone course IS 145 - Website Technology IS 150 - Network Management IS 160 - Database Management Upper-division courses in mathematics, statistics, actuarial science, or quantitative methods (MATH 101 and CS 114 may not both be counted for the major) (Neither MATH 140, CS 140, CS 190, the tutoring course, nor the MATH/CS Capstone courses may not be counted) Total 43\n\nBachelor of Science Degree Requirements\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree is intended for students who desire more of a scientific emphasis. Students who desire less of a scientific emphasis should consider the Bachelor of Arts degree. All programs are to be planned in careful consultation with a departmental advisor and be approved by that advisor.\n\nStudents must also satisfy the special requirements for a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree\n\nCourse Credits Core Courses 30 CS 065 - Introduction to Computer Science I 3 CS 066 - Introduction to Computer Science II 3 CS 067- Object-Oriented Programming 3 CS 083- Computer Ethics 3 CS 130 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming 3 CS 137 - Algorithm Analysis 3 CS 188- Software Engineering 3 CS 191 - The Capstone Course 3 MATH 050 - Calculus I 3 MATH 054 - Discrete Mathematics, or\n\nMATH 101 - Mathematical Reasoning 3 Upper Division Component 15 Computer Science Upper Division Component - Select 9 hours from the following: 9 Other computer science courses numbered 100 or above, excluding CS 140, the tutoring course, and the Capstone course IS 145 - Website Technology IS 150 - Network Management IS 160 - Database Management Additional Upper Division Component - Select 6 hours from the following: 6 Other computer science courses numbered 100 or above, excluding CS 140, the tutoring course, and the Capstone course IS 145 - Website Technology IS 150 - Network Management IS 160 - Database Management Upper-division courses in mathematics, statistics, actuarial science, or quantitative methods (MATH 101 and CS 114 may not both be counted for the major) (Neither MATH 140, CS 140, CS 190, the tutoring course, nor the MATH/CS Capstone courses may not be counted) Total 45\n\nComputer Science Minor\n\nStudents who choose a minor in computer science must have a departmental minor advisor and complete a minimum of 21 hours of computer science and related courses.\n\nCourse Credits CS 065 - Introduction to Computer Science I 3 CS 066 - Introduction to Computer Science II 3 CS 067- Object-Oriented Programming 3 CS 130 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming 3 Two additional upper-division computer science courses (excluding CS 140 - the tutoring course, and the Capstone course), or IS 145 - Website Technology, IS 150 - Network Management, or IS 160 - Database Management MATH 054 - Discrete Mathematics 3 Completion of MATH 080 - Linear Algebra is strongly recommended and is a prerequisite for CS 147 - Computer Graphics, CS 150 - Discrete Structures, and CS 165 - Introduction to Numerical Analysis Total 21\n\nCybersecurity Minor\n\nCybersecurity is a rapidly evolving discipline that provides students with a solid foundation in the principles and practices related to securing computer systems. Designed to complement any other areas of study, the curriculum covers cybersecurity tools, policies, ethics, and legal implications of cybersecurity. Students will learn state-of-the-art techniques for protecting systems from various cyber threats, including malware, hacking, phishing, and other types of cyberattacks.\n\nCourse credits CYB 010 - Introduction to Cybersecurity 3 CYB 140 - Cryptography and Ethical Hacking 3 CS 065 - Introduction to Computer Science I 3 IS 083 - IT Ethics and the Law 3 IS 150 - Network Management 3 Math 054 OR Math 050 3"
