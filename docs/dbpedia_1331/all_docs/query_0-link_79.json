Indeed, such task-related changes are known to be small, suggesting they may have only minimal functional relevance. Alternatively, despite their small amplitude, these task-related changes may be essential for the ability of the human brain to adaptively alter its functionality via rapid changes in inter-regional relationships. We used activity flow mapping—an approach for building empirically derived network models—to quantify the functional importance of task-state functional connectivity (above and beyond resting-state functional connectivity) in shaping cognitive task activations in the (female and male) human brain. We found that task-state functional connectivity could be used to better predict independent fMRI activations across all 24 task conditions and all 360 cortical regions tested. Further, we found that prediction accuracy was strongly driven by individual-specific functional connectivity patterns, while functional connectivity patterns from other tasks (task-general functional connectivity) still improved predictions beyond resting-state functional connectivity. Additionally, since activity flow models simulate how task-evoked activations (which underlie behavior) are generated, these results may provide mechanistic insight into why prior studies found correlations between task-state functional connectivity and individual differences in behavior. These findings suggest that task-related changes to functional connections play an important role in dynamically reshaping brain network organization, shifting the flow of neural activity during task performance.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Human cognition is highly dynamic, yet the functional network organization of the human brain is highly similar across rest and task states. We hypothesized that, despite this overall network stability, task-related changes from the intrinsic (resting-state) network organization of the brain strongly contribute to brain activations during cognitive task performance. Given that cognitive task activations emerge through network interactions, we leveraged connectivity-based models to predict independent cognitive task activations using resting-state versus task-state functional connectivity. This revealed that task-related changes in functional network organization increased prediction accuracy of cognitive task activations substantially, demonstrating their likely functional relevance for dynamic cognitive processes despite the small size of these task-related network changes.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nWe and others recently found using functional MRI (fMRI) that the statistical relationship between brain regions—functional connectivity (FC)—is similar between resting state and a variety of task states (Cole et al., 2014; Krienen et al., 2014; Gratton et al., 2018). Despite the small task-related changes in FC some statistically reliable changes between rest and task states have been observed (Cole et al., 2014; Krienen et al., 2014; Gratton et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2020a). The functional relevance of these relatively small task-related FC changes remains unclear, despite the clear relationship between these FC changes and the transition from rest to task states.\n\nWe recently developed an approach to quantify the functional relevance of resting-state FC via incorporating FC into simple network models that predict task-evoked activations (Cole et al., 2016). Here we sought to extend this approach to task fMRI data to assess the functional relevance of task-state FC. The core mechanisms underlying these models are the same as those used in most biological and artificial neural network models: the propagation and activation rules (Fig. 1A; McClelland and Rogers, 2003; Ito et al., 2020b). The propagation rule specifies that the activity of a distal node influences a given target node via a connection weight, while the activation rule specifies that the incoming activity will be summed before passing through a function (typically, a nonlinearity) to determine the output activity of the target node. The activity flow-mapping approach (Fig. 1B) builds on this framework, incorporating empirical FC and activation estimates to build a predictive model for each to-be-predicted region (one at a time). Since the activity level of the to-be-predicted region was empirically observed we can then test the accuracy of our model by comparison to empirical data. Thus, by predicting a variety of cognitive task-evoked activations (e.g., across regions and across task conditions), activity flow mapping provides a means to empirically test the functional (cognitive and computational) relevance of the connectivity estimates included in activity flow models (Ito et al., 2020b).\n\nHere we used activity flow mapping to test the functional relevance of task-state FC, especially as task-state FC differs from resting-state FC. The critical test was whether task-state FC increased activity flow-based prediction accuracy across a variety of task conditions. Such an observation would be nontrivial for several reasons. First, the relatively small changes between task-state FC and resting-state FC makes it unclear whether task-state FC would produce significantly better task-evoked activation prediction accuracies. Second, we recently validated an improved method for the subtraction of mean task-evoked activations before task-state FC estimation with fMRI data (Cole et al., 2019), which is the same approach used in the noise correlation literature to characterize the functional relationship between neurons and neural populations (typically used in nonhuman animal neuroscience; Ito et al., 2020a). This better ensures, relative to many prior studies, that the to-be-predicted activations have no direct effect on FC estimates (reducing potential circularity; Cole et al., 2019).\n\nThird, we recently replicated the nonhuman animal literature in finding that most human fMRI FC estimates decreased from rest to task (Ito et al., 2020a). This appears to run counter to the common intuition that FC should increase when two neural populations interact. One possibility is that—rather than FC increasing—the activity flow between two neural populations increases as the linear relationship between the populations (i.e., their FC) decreases (Fig. 1C,D). This would be consistent with the well supported possibility that the relationship between neural populations is a sigmoidal transfer function (Wilson and Cowan, 1972; Hopfield, 1982; Ito et al., 2020a). We recently used spiking and neural mass models to show that a sigmoidal transfer function between brain regions, which quenches variance at high and low activity levels, was enough to account for the observed FC decreases with increasing task-evoked neural activity (Ito et al., 2020a; Fig. 2). However, regardless of whether the sigmoidal transfer function is the mechanism underlying the relationship between neural populations, observing improved prediction accuracies using task-state FC would provide evidence that the observed changes in FC from rest to task are likely functionally relevant (rather than statistical artifacts). This is because of the clear functional relevance of what is being predicted: task-evoked activations across a variety of brain regions and task conditions (e.g., visual cortex responses in visual tasks, motor cortex responses in motor tasks). Indeed, task activations (neural activity level changes) can cause perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes (e.g., because of neural stimulation; Valero-Cabré et al., 2017), and likely depend on state-dependent network reconfigurations.\n\nThe critical test of our hypothesis that task-state FC is functionally relevant was whether task-evoked activations are better predicted by network models parameterized by task-state FC than those parameterized by resting-state FC. This test would demonstrate that task-related network reconfigurations facilitate the propagation of task-related activations, which are commonly thought of as the primary neural substrate of cognitive processes (Varoquaux et al., 2018). We conducted a variety of tests of this hypothesis using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, which provided a large number of task conditions (24) for activity flow models to predict, as well as a large amount of task-state and resting-state data per subject for estimating FC. We began by testing for task-state versus resting-state FC using the field-standard Pearson correlation FC measure. We then tested whether better accounting for causal confounds in activity flow models improved prediction accuracy. Finally, we tested various factors contributing to task-state FC prediction accuracy, such as testing whether task-state FC from other tasks (task-general FC) could improve predictions as well. Confirmation that task-state FC consistently improves task activation prediction across a variety of task conditions would suggest an important role for task-driven network changes in producing the task activations underlying perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes.\n\nTask-state FC better models task-evoked activity flow than resting-state FC\n\nWe previously found that task-state FC across a variety of tasks differs only minimally from resting-state FC (Cole et al., 2014). Others have replicated this effect (Krienen et al., 2014; Gratton et al., 2018). Further, we recently found that task-state FC correlation strengths are consistently lower than resting-state FC among cortical regions (Fig. 4), likely driven by task-related local inhibition causing variance and covariance quenching (Fig. 2; Ito et al., 2020a). These results seemed to suggest that task-state FC might contribute only minimally to task-related functionality. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that task-evoked activation patterns could be accurately predicted without task-state FC information, using only estimated activity flow over resting-state functional network architecture (Cole et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2017). Here we sought to quantify the contribution of task-state FC to task-evoked processes by directly comparing the prediction of task-evoked activations using activity flow over task-state FC versus activity flow over resting-state FC.\n\nWe began by characterizing cortex-wide changes in region-to-region correlations from resting-state FC to task-state FC (Fig. 4C), focusing for now on the cross-task average task-state FC. We found that 68% of connections differed significantly between rest and task (p < 0.05, familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons). Only 4.4% of connections significantly increased from rest to task, while 63.4% of connections significantly decreased from rest to task. Thus, a significantly changed connection was 14 times (63.4/4.4 = 14.4) more likely to have decreased than increased from rest to task.\n\nWe next conducted an additional replication test, focusing on testing the original activity flow over resting-state FC results (Cole et al., 2016). The original results also used the HCP dataset, but involved fewer subjects (here, N = 176; before, N = 100), a less validated preprocessing stream (see Materials and Methods), did not include a replication cohort (N = 176), and focused on average activation across seven tasks rather than the 24 conditions included in those tasks. Further, we developed some important innovations relative to that original study, as follows: (1) a new set of networks (Ji et al., 2019); (2) utilization of a better validated set of regions (Glasser et al., 2016); and (3) a focus on predicting the “response profile” of a neural population (condition-wise prediction), rather than focusing solely on whole-brain activation patterns. This final innovation can provide characterization of population receptive fields, a central concept in neuroscience (Wandell and Winawer, 2015), given that population receptive fields (i.e., the set of stimuli and task conditions that elicits a response in a neural population) can be inferred from condition-wise activity patterns.\n\nAs in the previous study, task-evoked activation patterns were predicted (using activity flow estimated over resting-state Pearson correlation FC) with above-chance correspondence between predicted and actual activation patterns: r = 0.51, t(175) = 99, p < 0.00001 (Fig. 5A). This was true in the replication dataset as well (r = 0.51, t(175) = 91, p < 0.00001), as well as for each of the 24 conditions separately (each p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted above chance (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) for 100% of the 360 cortical regions analyzed here (Fig. 5D; mean r = 0.52, t(175) = 69, p < 0.00001; replication dataset: mean r = 0.51, t(175) = 71, p < 0.00001). These results confirm the informativeness of resting-state FC, which forms the baseline for subsequent tests, for predicting task-evoked activity flow.\n\nAs hypothesized, we found that task-state FC (with task-evoked activations regressed out to avoid circularity in predictions; see Materials and Methods) improved activity flow-based predictions of task-evoked activations relative to resting-state FC. Task-state FC was calculated for each task condition, for each subject separately. Activity flow predictions and predicted-to-actual comparisons were also conducted for each task condition and each subject separately (before averaging prediction accuracies across subjects). Activity flow predictions of task activation patterns using task-state correlation FC (Fig. 5C) resulted in the following overall prediction accuracy: r = 0.66, t(175) = 133, p < 0.00001. The direct contrast between activity flow predictions with task-state versus resting-state FC was as follows: r difference = 0.15, t(175) = 42, p < 0.00001. These results were consistent with those of the replication dataset (r = 0.66, t(175) = 123, p < 0.00001; r difference = 0.16, t(175) = 40, p < 0.00001), as well as for each of the 24 conditions separately (each p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted better (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) with task-state FC than resting-state FC for 93% of the 360 cortical regions analyzed here (Fig. 5F; mean r difference = 0.12, t(175) = 42, p < 0.00001; replication dataset: mean r difference = 0.13, t(175) = 38, p < 0.00001). These results confirm our primary hypothesis: that task-state FC is more informative regarding the paths of task-evoked activity flow than resting-state FC.\n\nPrediction accuracy improves when causal confounding is reduced\n\nMultiple regression is a standard statistical method that conditions on other variables, such that multiple regression parameter estimates indicate unique variance contributing to each prediction. Thus, when used for FC estimation with each node (one-at-a-time) being predicted by the time series of all other nodes, multiple regression reduces causal confounds (e.g., a third variable causing a spurious association) in inferred associations (Cole et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2017; Sanchez-Romero and Cole, 2020). We used it here given the goal of improving FC-based causal inferences (though limitations remain even when using multiple-regression FC rather than Pearson correlation FC; Reid et al., 2019; Sanchez-Romero and Cole, 2020). We hypothesized that multiple-regression FC would provide more accurate task-evoked activation predictions with activity flow mapping (using both resting-state FC and task-state FC) than when using Pearson correlation FC, because of the reduction in causal confounds.\n\nBefore testing this hypothesis, we analyzed the change in multiple-regression FC values across rest and task (Fig. 6). The resulting connectivity coefficients were much smaller and the connectivity matrix was sparser when using multiple-regression FC, consistent with multiple-regression FC reducing the number of confounds relative to correlation-based FC (Reid et al., 2019; Sanchez-Romero and Cole, 2020). We then averaged across these 24 FC estimates for analysis and visualization. The mean resting-state FC and task-state FC were highly similar to each other (r = 0.94), as is the case for correlation-based FC (Cole et al., 2014). We found that 2.6% of connections (915 connections) differed significantly between rest and task (p < 0.05, familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons). Only 0.28% of connections (180 connections) significantly increased from rest to task, while 2.28% of connections (1478 connections) significantly decreased from rest to task. Thus, a significantly changed connection was eight times as likely to have decreased than increased from rest to task. The small FC differences for task-state FC relative to resting-state FC (even smaller than with Pearson correlation FC) might make it surprising if using multiple-regression task-state FC improves activity flow prediction accuracy. Yet, we hypothesized that the increase in activity flow prediction accuracy would remain and perhaps even be enhanced given that activity flows sum across many sources, potentially allowing for large differences in activation prediction values despite small differences in contributing connectivity values.\n\nUsing multiple-regression FC with resting-state data, task-evoked activation patterns were again predicted with above-chance correspondence between predicted and actual activation patterns (r = 0.46, t(175) = 81, p < 0.00001; Fig. 7A). This was true for each of the 24 conditions separately (each p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted above chance (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) for 98% of the 360 cortical regions analyzed here (Fig. 7D; mean r = 0.46, t(175) = 99, p < 0.00001). Note that the number of time points used for the task-state FC results were matched for the estimation of resting-state FC (see Materials and Methods).\n\nAs hypothesized, we also found with multiple-regression FC that task-state FC improved activity flow-based predictions of task-evoked activations relative to resting-state FC. Activity flow predictions of task activation patterns using task-state multiple-regression FC (Fig. 7C) resulted in the following overall prediction accuracy: r = 0.76, t(175) = 146, p < 0.00001. The direct contrast between activity flow predictions with task-state versus resting-state FC was as follows: r difference = 0.31, t(175) = 94, p < 0.00001. These results were consistent with those for thereplication dataset (r = 0.77, t(175) = 149, p < 0.00001; r difference = 0.31, t(175) = 95, p < 0.00001), as well as for each of the 24 conditions separately (each p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted better (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) with task-state FC better than resting-state FC for 100% of the 360 cortical regions analyzed here (Fig. 7F; mean r = 0.75, t(175) = 148, p < 0.00001). The direct contrast between task-state FC and resting-state FC-based condition-wise predictions was as follows: mean r difference = 0.27, t(175) = 106, p < 0.00001. These results further confirm our primary hypothesis that task-state FC is more informative regarding the paths of task-evoked activity flow than resting-state FC. A summary of these and related results is included in Table 2.\n\nThese multiple-regression FC prediction accuracies were higher than the correlation FC prediction accuracies. We quantified this improvement by comparing these prediction accuracies statistically. The improvement in overall prediction accuracy across all nodes and conditions using task-state FC with multiple-regression FC (relative to correlation FC) was highly significant (mean r difference = 0.10, t(175) = 34, p < 0.00001). This suggests that the influence of task-state FC changes on task-evoked activations is more accurately described when accounting for causal confounds using multiple-regression FC (Reid et al., 2019; Sanchez-Romero and Cole, 2020).\n\nVisualizing predictions across diverse cognitive domains on brain surfaces\n\nThree of the 24 task conditions were selected for detailed illustration because of the diversity of cognitive demands they represented (Fig. 8). As with all other task conditions, these three task conditions were significantly better predicted using task-state FC than resting-state FC (all p < 0.00001). To reduce redundancy with Figure 7, we used a different metric to quantify prediction accuracy: average-then-compare R2 prediction accuracies. This involves averaging activations across subjects before comparing predicted and actual activation patterns, then quantifying similarity using R2 scores (Table 1). R2 scores were used such that the scale of the values was taken into account, not just the unscaled pattern similarity quantified using Pearson correlations. Average-then-compare was used so predicted-to-actual similarity reflected the similarity of the group-averaged values visualized in Figure 8. However, note that it is more accurate to compare at the individual-subject level before group averaging the similarity values, as was done for all other analyses. This is because of individual-specific activations and FC being taken into account, rather than blurring activity and connectivity patterns across individuals before predicted-to-actual comparison.\n\nThe role of task-state FC decreases versus increases in activity flow predictions\n\nA potentially counterintuitive aspect of task-state FC estimates is their tendency to decrease relative to resting-state FC estimates (Fig. 2). Here we sought to determine whether these decreases are functionally meaningful. Given that most statistically significant task versus rest FC changes decreased from rest to task, and yet task-state FC improved activity flow prediction accuracy overall, it is likely that the decreases played a prominent role in improving activity flow prediction accuracies. We sought to better establish this possibility using a lesioning approach—selectively removing connections of interest so as to quantify their importance for prediction accuracy.\n\nTask-state multiple-regression functional connections that decreased from rest were lesioned (on a subject-specific and task-specific basis) by setting those connections to 0. We then conducted activity flow mapping with all 360 nodes and 24 task conditions. Using FC-decrease lesioned models, we found that prediction accuracy reduced to r = 0.48 (from r = 0.76 without lesioning; r difference = 0.29, t(175) = 59, p < 0.00001). This suggests that rest-to-task FC decreases were important for task activation prediction, consistent with the larger number of rest-to-task FC decreases relative to increases.\n\nWe also found that task-state FC increases from rest were functionally important. Using FC-increase lesioned models, we found that prediction accuracy reduced to r = −0.20 (from r = 0.76 without lesioning; r difference = 0.96, t(175) = 87, p < 0.00001). Further, the FC-increase lesioned model performed significantly worse than the FC-decrease mode (r = 0.48 vs r = −0.20; r difference = 0.67, t(175) = 50, p < 0.00001). This result confirmed the functional importance of rest-to-task increases in FC, while also revealing that FC increases have a larger impact of task activation prediction accuracy than FC decreases. This is despite the smaller number and amplitude of statistically significant increases relative to decreases.\n\nNote, however, that we did not restrict our lesioning to statistically significant FC changes. Rather, all connections were considered so as to avoid biasing results to only those FC changes that are consistent across subjects. An analysis of the connections lesioned in these two models revealed that 50.2% of connections decreased from rest to task, while 49.8% increased. Further, FC decreases changed by 0.461 on average, while FC increases changed by 0.462 on average. These results revealed that, once results were not restricted to statistically significant group-level FC changes, FC increases were nearly as numerous and large in amplitude as FC decreases.\n\nThe large number of task-state FC decreases (just over half of FC changes) may appear counterintuitive because of the common intuition that as activity increases during task performance, so too should FC, reflecting an increase in neural interactions during tasks. We hypothesized that this intuition might more accurately apply to activity flows (activations × FC), rather than FC alone. Specifically, we expected that a large portion of activity flows would be positive, possibly reflecting increases in neural interactions, despite restriction to only FC decreases from resting state. This is possible because activity flows reflect activations (changes in activity levels from interblock rest baseline) multiplied by connectivity, such that even FC decreases (e.g., 0.25, down from 0.40) can be multiplied by a positive activation increase from resting baseline (e.g., 0.30) to yield a positive activity flow (e.g., 0.25 × 0.30 = 0.075; Fig. 1C,D). As expected, we found that 50.001% of all nonzero activity flows (over task-reduced connections) were positive. These results suggest that a task-state FC decrease can nonetheless result in increased activity in a distal region (via activity flow), despite activity increases in one region having a smaller effect on the other (relative to resting state).\n\nThe role of individual-specific factors in task-state FC\n\nTo this point, the task-state FC advantage has been shown when activity flow predictions are computed in a subject-specific manner. Further, task-state FC has been computed using the same task runs as the to-be-predicted task activations. We next sought to quantify the impact of subject-specific FC (vs group FC) and run-specific FC (vs FC from an independent run). Confirming the importance of these factors, a recent study of group versus individual-subject FC indicated there are large effects of subject-specific FC, and also of subject-specific task-state FC relative to subject-specific resting-state FC (Gratton et al., 2018). That study quantified these effects by comparing whole-cortex connectivity patterns across individuals and cognitive states, such as assessing how similar the same subject's versus other subjects' task-state FC patterns were. They found high similarity between resting-state FC and task-state FC connectivity matrices within subject (relative to between subjects), indicating a large effect of subject-specific resting-state FC on specifying each subject's task-state FC connectivity pattern. They also found that these subject-specific effects were less prominent (relative to group effects) for task activations (i.e., comparing whole-cortex activation patterns) relative to FC. Since activity flow mapping is a combination of both task activations and FC, the relative role of subject-specific versus group effects in activity flow predictions is unclear.\n\nBased on the findings by Gratton et al. (2018), group FC was defined as other subjects' FC. Thus, the effect of group (nonindividualized) FC was quantified by using a randomly assigned (without replacement) subjects' FC for each subject's activity flow prediction. It was important to use other individual subjects' FC, rather than group-averaged FC, to control for the total amount of data going into the FC estimates when comparing group versus individualized FC effects.\n\nWe compared the effects of the following three factors: group versus individual, rest versus task, and same versus different task run. This revealed statistically significant (all p < 0.00001) effects for all three factors, showing increases for individual, task, and same-run factors (Fig. 9). This was the case for both Pearson correlation (Fig. 9A) and R2 (Fig. 9B) assessments of activity flow prediction accuracy. The largest effect on activity flow prediction accuracies was from individualized task-state FC (Fig. 9C). This effect (R2 = 0.40) was several times larger than the effect of individualized rest/intrinsic FC (R2 = 0.13), which can be thought of as a baseline (e.g., because of lower overall metabolic demand in the brain during resting state (Gusnard et al., 2001)). This suggests (consistent with Gratton et al., 2018) that individualized task-state FC reconfigurations play a large role in shaping task activations. Note that the individualized nature of task-state FC may help explain why there is a large effect of task-state FC on activity flow prediction accuracy despite there being only small group-level differences in task-state FC relative to resting-state FC (r = 0.94 similarity between group-level resting-state and task-state FC matrices; Fig. 6A,B).\n\nA notable discrepancy in the results is the consistently higher R2 values in Figure 9B compared with Table 2, especially for the resting-state-FC-based predictions (−0.29 in Table 2 vs >0.1 in Fig. 9B). This is despite half the data used per prediction in Figure 9B (one run per task) relative to Table 2 (two runs per task). We hypothesized that this was because of overfitting to noise in the multiple-regression FC estimates, which was likely substantially reduced in the Figure 9B analysis because of the use of fewer principal components (greater regularization) in the principal components regression step. This reduction in the included number of principal components was by necessity (given fewer data points than regressors; see Materials and Methods) but may have nonetheless improved the generalization of the regression weights by removing noise variance from the data before the multiple-regression fitting step. Confirming this, we found that R2 increased from −0.29 to 0.38 when everything was identical to the analysis in Table 2 (resting-state FC overall R2) except that half of the principal components was used (matching the number of principal components used in Fig. 9B). This demonstrates that exploring the role of regularization in activity flow-based predictions will be important for future research (e.g., using cross-validation to optimize the number of principal components). Importantly, using this more optimal regularization also improved the task-state–FC-based prediction from 0.51 (Table 2) to 0.60. This demonstrates that regularization also improves task–FC-based predictions. Note that the low average R2 performance for condition-wise task-state–FC-based prediction (Table 2) was also improved with the increased regularization (from R2 = 0.01 to R2 = 0.19).\n\nTask-general FC also improves prediction accuracy\n\nWe next sought to determine whether task-state FC estimates needed to come from the same task as the to-be-predicted task activations to improve predictions. Instead, it might be that any (or most) task states provide a similar advantage relative to resting-state FC. This would be consistent with observations that many task-state FC changes from resting-state FC generalize across task states (Cole et al., 2014; Schultz and Cole, 2016). Further, using task-general FC (connectivity estimated by concatenating time series from multiple task states) could have a benefit to prediction accuracy based on the increased number of time points going into the FC estimates, given limited data from any single task. We computed task-general FC simply as multiple-regression coefficients calculated across all task runs. We avoided circularity by removing mean evoked responses from each task condition (as with task-specific FC estimation), as well as by excluding the time points during the to-be-predicted task condition. Thus, the inference was similar to using resting-state FC for activity flow mapping, since the connectivity models were based on a brain state independent of the to-be-predicted task condition.\n\nConsistent with our hypothesis that task-general FC carries some of the same benefits as task-state FC, we found that using task-general FC increased prediction accuracy relative to using resting-state FC (matched for the number of time points). The overall prediction accuracy (across all nodes and task conditions) with task-general FC was r = 0.90 (t(175) = 156, p < 0.00001), while the same analysis with resting-state FC yielded r = 0.87 (t(175) = 145, p < 0.00001). Comparing the two approaches, the mean r difference = 0.03 (t(175) = 33, p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted to be significantly above chance with task-general FC (mean r = 0.89, t(175) = 167, p < 0.00001) and resting-state FC (mean r = 0.87, t(175) = 27, p < 0.00001). These condition-wise response profile predictions were significantly better (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) with task-general FC than resting-state FC for 41% of the 360 cortical regions (mean r difference = 0.02, t(175) = 27, p < 0.00001). These results demonstrate a small but reliable benefit to using task (rather than rest) data to estimate FC, even if the task data come from task conditions other than the one being modeled.\n\nIt is possible that not all task conditions improved activity flow prediction accuracy for every other task condition. For instance, two very distinct tasks might actually bias task-state FC away from the correct relationship between brain regions during each task (relative to resting-state FC). We tested this possibility by iteratively using the task-state FC of each task condition for predicting whole-cortex brain activity patterns for each task condition. This produced a state-generalization matrix using task-state FC (Fig. 10A). All task conditions could be used individually to predict all other task conditions above chance (mean r = 0.49, t(175) = 19, p < 0.00001). The same was found using time-matched resting-state FC (mean r = 0.45, t(175) = 30, p < 0.00001; Fig. 10B). Overall (averaged across all values in the state-generalization matrices), task-state FC predicted task activations better than resting-state FC (r difference = 0.04, t(176) = 4, p = 0.0004). However, when each condition pair was compared separately (Fig. 10C), task-state FC did not better predict all conditions individually. Indeed, there were cases of both significantly (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) increased and decreased prediction accuracy (Fig. 10D).\n\nThe matched-condition cases (Fig. 10D, diagonal in the matrix) and matched-task cases (conditions from the same task) were universally higher for task-state FC. We further found that the overall pattern of prediction accuracy differences was correlated with whole-cortex task activation pattern similarities (Fig. 10E; r = 0.61, t(175) = 95, p < 0.00001). This was also the case (but less so) for task-state FC pattern similarities (Fig. 10F; r = 0.21, t(175) = 39, p < 0.00001). Similarity between tasks was quantified using Pearson correlations, between 360-length vectors (activations for all regions) in Figure 10E and 129240-length vectors (multiple-regression FC among all regions) in Figure 10F. These results suggest that similar task conditions (quantified as task activation pattern similarity) better describe activity flow routes for each other than dissimilar task conditions. This was further confirmed by comparing predictions between task conditions with positive task activation correlations (mean r = 0.041) versus tasks conditions with negative task activation correlations (mean r = −0.046) directly (r difference = 0.087, t(175) = 32, p < 0.00001).\n\nThe role of amount of data used for FC estimation\n\nFor most analyses, we restricted the amount of data used for estimating resting-state FC to the amount used for each task-state FC estimate. This controlled for the amount of data as a factor, making for a fairer comparison between the methods. However, there is often more resting-state data available in fMRI datasets than the 114 time points (82 s) available on average for each of the 24 task conditions used here. We therefore next used the entire amount of resting-state fMRI data available for estimating resting-state FC (4780 time points; 57 min).\n\nAs expected, task-evoked activation patterns were better predicted with more resting-state fMRI data used for estimating multiple-regression FC. Predicted-to-actual activation pattern similarity across all nodes and task conditions (r = 0.89, t(175) = 166, p < 0.00001). This was significantly higher than when the amount of data was matched to the task conditions (time matched; r difference = 0.31, t(175) = 94, p < 0.00001). The mean R2 was 0.78, meaning 78% of the activation pattern variance was accurately predicted on average. This was substantially larger than the R2 of −0.29 with the time-matched results. A positive r value along with a negative R2 value suggests that there was a scaling issue with the time-matched resting-state FC results (see Table 1).\n\nThese results demonstrate that much of the predictive advantage of task-state FC is present with low amounts of data. This likely reflects the fact that prediction has an upper bound (here r = 1.0), which will naturally reduce differences between predictive methods as they approach that upper bound. We next sought to test whether there was still a task-state FC advantage with larger amounts of data. A task-general approach was used to allow for more task data, but using all task data (including the to-be-predicted task) this time to include even more data. We varied the amount of rest and task-general data across 5, 10, 20, and 30 min of data. Both resting-state FC and task-general FC predictions accuracies increased significantly (all p < 0.00001) with each incremental increase in data (Fig. 11). An ANOVA indicated there was a main effect of the amount of data (F(3) = 9021, p < 0.00001), a main effect of FC state (F(1) = 1449, p < 0.00001), and an interaction between the amount of data and FC state (F(1,3) = 46, p < 0.00001). The interaction reflected the reduction in the task-general FC advantage relative to resting-state FC as the amount of data increased. Importantly, however, task-general FC predictions were significantly better at all amounts of data (all p < 0.00001), including the highest amount of data (r = 0.91 for task vs r = 0.86 for rest). These results demonstrate that the task-state advantage over resting-state FC for activity flow predictions remains regardless of the amount of data, though the task-state FC advantage is naturally reduced with high amounts of data as the maximum possible prediction accuracy is approached.\n\nControlling for potential spatial smoothness confounds\n\nIt is thought that fMRI BOLD data have an inherent smoothness that partially reflects the spatial properties of vasculature rather than neural activity (Lee et al., 1995; Menon and Kim, 1999). This smoothness is thought to be somewhere between 2 and 5 mm (Malonek and Grinvald, 1996; Logothetis and Wandell, 2004). The prior results might have been biased by this effect, given that the edge of each region is within 2 mm of the edge of nearby regions, introducing potential circularity in the prediction accuracies (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2016).\n\nWe repeated the main analyses reported above with this bias removed. This was done by excluding all parcels with any vertices within 10 mm of each to-be-predicted region from the set of predictors (see Materials and Methods). We chose 10 mm to remain conservative, given uncertainty regarding the degree of vascular-driven smoothness of fMRI signal at any given location. Results were highly similar with this modification, despite including fewer predictors. Specifically, as hypothesized, we again found with multiple-regression FC that task-state FC improved activity flow-based predictions of task-evoked activations relative to resting-state FC (when using task-state FC: r = 0.74, t(175) = 139, p < 0.00001; when using resting-state FC: r = 0.39, t(175) = 73, p < 0.00001). The direct contrast between activity flow predictions with task-state versus resting-state FC was: r difference = 0.35, t(175) = 99, p < 0.00001. These results further confirm our primary hypothesis that task-state FC is more informative regarding the paths of task-evoked activity flow than resting-state FC.\n\nAssessing prediction accuracy relative to repeat reliability (the noise ceiling)\n\nA common approach for assessing the performance of predictive models is to compare predictions to the repeat reliability of the data, indicating how far the prediction accuracies are from the theoretical limit (the “noise ceiling”; Naselaris et al., 2011; Nili et al., 2014). We reran the main analysis above (comparing predictions using multiple-regression FC with task vs rest data) but built the activity flow models using the first task run and testing prediction accuracy based on task activations from the second task run. This was equivalent to a double cross-validation, with both the to-be-predicted region held out (as with standard activity flow mapping) as well as holding out the data used for estimating activations and FC of all regions. Another advantage of this approach was to better equate the resting-state FC estimates and task-state FC estimates, since (unlike task-state FC) resting-state FC was necessarily estimated in a separate fMRI run from the to-be-predicted task activations. Further, the prediction accuracies estimated in this manner are likely to generalize better to other independent data (in contrast to most of the prior predictions being optimized to the particular states subjects were in during task performance). Notably, since (1) error can come from the contributing activations in addition to the FC values, and (2) only half the data were used for both the FC and task activation estimates with this approach, we expect the predictions to be worse than most of the previous analyses. Note that the results in Figure 9 also used only a single task run per subject, but (unlike here) activation contributing to the activity flow-mapping step still came from the same task run.\n\nWe started by calculating the repeat reliability between the two task runs across all nodes and task conditions (correlation between the actual task activations for run 1 and run 2). This was highly statistically significant, yet with an effect size lower than the activity flow-based predictions described above (mean r = 0.52, t(175) = 65, p < 0.00001). This r value being far from r = 1.0 suggests that reducing the amount of data by half likely reduces the reliability of the data substantially. Activity flow predictions with task-state FC were successful despite using half the data and predicting task activations in a different fMRI run (mean r = 0.40, t(175) = 57, p < 0.00001). Importantly, the task-state FC boost to prediction (relative to resting-state FC) remained (mean r difference = 0.13, t(175) = 38, p < 0.00001). Condition-wise response profiles were also predicted better (each p < 0.05, FWE corrected) with task-state FC rather than resting-state FC for 48% of the 360 cortical regions analyzed here (mean r difference = 0.09, t(175) = 31, p < 0.00001). These results demonstrate that the increase in prediction accuracy when using task-state FC versus resting-state FC was robust to predicting data in a separate task fMRI run.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe functional relevance of task-state FC has recently been called into question, based on the small size and number of task-related FC changes from resting-state FC (Cole et al., 2014; Krienen et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2020a) and the surprising efficacy of using resting-state FC to predict task activations (Cole et al., 2016; Tavor et al., 2016). Further, running counter to the common intuition that FC should increase as neural populations interact during task performance, FC tends to decrease as neural populations increase their activity levels and interact more strongly (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009; Ito et al., 2020a). We sought to test the possibility that—despite their counterintuitive nature—task-state FC changes nonetheless play an important role in shaping cognitive task activations. Supporting this conclusion, parameterizing network models using task-state FC consistently improved (relative to using resting-state FC) predictions of held-out cognitive task activations. Further, the use of empirically derived network models provides mechanistic insight into how task-state FC influences brain function: by dynamically shifting the flow of activity between brain regions to shape task activations in a context-dependent manner.\n\nThis increase in prediction accuracy generalized across multiple tests, demonstrating the robustness of this effect. First, cognitive task activations across all 24 task conditions and 360 cortical brain regions tested were better predicted when using Pearson-correlation FC (the field standard) estimated during task performance relative to resting state. Importantly, mean task-evoked activations (i.e., the to-be-predicted signals) were aggressively removed before task-state FC estimation, eliminating analysis circularity and leaving only spontaneous and induced activity to contribute to task-state FC estimates (Cole et al., 2019). Despite using such “background” connectivity (also termed “noise correlations”; Norman-Haignere et al., 2012), the task-state FC estimates nonetheless better described task activity flow than resting-state FC. Notably, the vast majority of studies that have suggested the high functional relevance of task-state FC because of its correlation with individual differences in behavior (Greene et al., 2018) did not remove task activation variance (already known to be highly related to behavior), such that these previous findings did not conclusively demonstrate functional relevance of task-state FC. Second, using multiple-regression FC to reduce causal confounds (Reid et al., 2019; Sanchez-Romero and Cole, 2020) further improved predictions of cognitive task activations, suggesting (tentatively for now) the causal plausibility of activity flow predictions using task-state FC. Third, task-state FC from tasks other than the to-be-predicted task also provided a boost in activation prediction accuracy, though it did not provide as strong a boost in accuracy as when the same task was used.\n\nThe present results are consistent with a variety of studies showing that, despite their small size and number, task-related FC changes nonetheless reliably differ from resting-state FC (Cole et al., 2014; Krienen et al., 2014; Gratton et al., 2018). This reliability across time and also (to some extent) across subjects suggests there may be an important functional role for task-state FC. Importantly, we also found that individual differences play a large role in the task-state FC boost in activation prediction accuracy. This is consistent with results showing that task-state FC changes are largely subject specific (Gratton et al., 2018). This suggests that group-averaged task-state FC results will always partially mischaracterize task-state FC changes, and that individualized characterization (and/or characterization of individual variation) will be especially important in future work. Note that (unless noted otherwise) the activity flow mapping results were based on individualized FC and activations, with predicted-to-actual comparisons made before group averaging.\n\nThe present results advance our understanding of task-state FC by mechanistically simulating how these estimated connections may support task-evoked activations. This is an advance because of theoretical and mechanistic uncertainties regarding task-state FC, which contrasts with theoretical and mechanistic certainties regarding task-evoked activations. For instance, activations are known to cause perception, action, and cognition (e.g., via transcranial magnetic stimulation or intracranial stimulation; Valero-Cabré et al., 2017). There is less mechanistic certainty regarding fMRI-based activations relative to neural spike activations (i.e., increases in spike rate), yet it is well established that neural spike activations can cause fMRI activations (Logothetis et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2010). Supporting this interpretation of fMRI activations, many highly replicated fMRI activations are consistent with extremely well established causal mechanisms (based on over a century of evidence from more invasive approaches), such as activations in primary motor cortex during motor action (Yokoi et al., 2018), primary visual cortex during visual perception (Wandell and Winawer, 2015), and primary auditory cortex during auditory perception (Striem-Amit et al., 2011). Yet fMRI is known to be sensitive to other factors in addition to spiking activity, such that spikes cannot be inferred with certainty based on fMRI observations. Including nuisance regression to remove other signals that fMRI is sensitive to (e.g., physiological artifacts), as we have here, can help with this kind of inference, however.\n\nRelative to activations, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying FC, such as the task-related changes in correlations/regressions investigated here. In the nonhuman animal literature, task-state FC is typically termed noise correlation, because they are calculated (as we have here) as covariance above and beyond the “signal”: cross-trial mean task-evoked activations. It is well known that noise correlations between neurons tend to decrease from rest to task (Cohen and Kohn, 2011), and that this tends to increase the information capacity of neural populations via making neural responses more distinct from each other (Averbeck et al., 2006; Cohen and Kohn, 2011). We recently showed that such task-related decreases in correlation generalize to correlations between brain regions (not just individual neurons) in both monkey spiking data and human fMRI data (Ito et al., 2020a; Fig. 2). Beyond this abstract information theoretic interpretation, however, it has been unclear whether task-state functional connections (noise correlations) actually contribute to cognitive/perceptual/motor functionality. Here we provided evidence consistent with this possibility, given that task-state FC better predicts task-evoked activations (which are more directly and mechanistically related to cognitive/perceptual/motor functionality) than intrinsic FC.\n\nWe sought to improve theoretical insights into the mechanistic role of task-state FC using the concept of activity flow. Activity flow (as a theoretical construct) is the movement of activity amplitudes between neural populations, which activity flow mapping attempts to quantify. Since true activity flow involves directionality and spatiotemporal precision not currently possible with fMRI, we previously validated its use with fMRI data using neural mass simulations. We found that simulated fMRI data, while imperfect, was quite accurate at predicting ground-truth activity flows in the simulated data (Cole et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2017). Standard neuroscience theory attributes the flow of neural activity solely to action potentials flowing over axons, which cause the release of neurotransmitters at synapses (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952). These neurotransmitters are then thought to cause the BOLD signal via interactions with nearby astrocytes and blood vessels (Attwell et al., 2010). Thus, standard neuroscience theory provides a straightforward mechanistic account of how activity flow relates to fMRI BOLD: local activity changes, measured indirectly via BOLD fMRI, can be related to each other via activity flows over long-distance connections (action potentials over axons). However, fMRI BOLD is susceptible to artifacts and distortions because of spatiotemporal downsampling and other factors. We used rigorously validated data preprocessing to reduce the impact of artifacts, while we relied on well established theory and the validation simulations mentioned above (which also involved spatiotemporal downsampling to simulate fMRI) to support our fMRI-based inferences. Notably, many of the conclusions reached here were dependent on the extensive spatial coverage (the entire neocortex), relatively high spatial localization certainty (relative to, e.g., electroencephalography), along with moderately high temporal resolution (seconds not minutes) afforded by fMRI.\n\nConclusions must nonetheless be restricted to some extent given the limitations of BOLD fMRI relative to ground-truth spiking activity. For instance, the FC measures used do not estimate causal directionality, such that the directions of estimated activity flows were unknown. Notably, however, most corticocortical connections are known to be bidirectional (Markov et al., 2014). This suggests that most of the activity flow predictions are at least partially correct under the assumption of bidirectionality. Further, since resting-state FC (the baseline for comparison) also had the directionality limitation, our conclusions are likely unaffected by the lack of directional information. Another limitation of BOLD fMRI is that it has an inherent smoothness that partially reflects spatial properties of vasculature rather than neural activity (Lee et al., 1995; Menon and Kim, 1999). This effect is thought to be between 2 and 5 mm (Malonek and Grinvald, 1996; Logothetis and Wandell, 2004). We ruled this out as a major factor here by conducting a follow-up analysis in which we removed all parcels within 10 mm of the to-be-predicted activations from the activity flow-mapping procedure.\n\nBuilding on our recent nonhuman (and human) primate study showing that most correlation-based functional connections decrease from rest to task (Ito et al., 2020a), we found that most regression-based functional connections also decrease. These results appear to run counter to the common intuition that tasks should increase neural interactions overall. Activity flow mapping adds insight here, however, since we found that activity flow (activations × FC) often increases even as FC decreases (Fig. 1C,D). Thus, the common intuition that neural interactions (quantified as activity flows) often increase during tasks relative to rest can stand, while acknowledging that most functional connections (correlations and regressions) decrease from rest to task states. Notably, our recent study (Ito et al., 2020a) suggested that these task-state FC decreases likely result from neural populations being related via sigmoidal transfer functions, suggesting the importance of future work examining the estimation of task-state FC using nonlinear regression approaches. Even if a single nonlinear function could account for both resting-state FC and task-state FC, however, the insights gained via changes in separate piece-wise linear estimates (as done here; Fig. 2C) would remain valid.\n\nIn conclusion, we found strong evidence consistent with task-state FC having a prominent role in neurocognitive functions. This built on our prior work suggesting that intrinsic brain connectivity (as measured by resting-state FC) has a large role in neurocognitive functionality, by shaping cognitive task activations (Cole et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2017; Mill et al., 2020). We again quantified the likely contribution of connectivity to cognitive task activations, finding that task-state FC consistently improved the prediction of task activations relative to resting-state FC. This suggests that task-state FC likely has an important functional role despite changes from resting state being small in size (Cole et al., 2014; Krienen et al., 2014), and despite most of those (statistically significant) changes being reductions in FC strength. This conclusion is highly general, as cognitive task activations were better predicted across all 360 cortical regions and all 24 task conditions tested. We anticipate these findings to facilitate future interpretation of task-state FC effects, such as the interpretation of task-state FC decreases in the context of increased activity, as potentially reflecting overall increases in activity flow."
