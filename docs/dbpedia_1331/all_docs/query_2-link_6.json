        "text": "The Uber breach has everyone on edge, especially with the hacker gaining access to so many internal systems -- including Slack. Yikes! Situations like this are exactly why we purpose-built the Aware platform to tackle security and compliance for collaboration platforms like Slack. With Aware, security teams can minimize the impact of these breaches by proactively drawing attention to unusual behavior or identifying hot spots within Slack that represent value that could be stolen. Furthermore, these teams strengthen their breach readiness approach with Aware's continuous and intelligent data observability that allows for immediate investigation and response. Let's face it - collaboration tools like Slack are tremendous technologies for getting work done, but the amount of value embedded in these conversations make them a phenomenal target, and an exponentially growing security risk. Follow some of the biggest companies in the world when you protect your data and minimize your risk with Aware. #breach #collaboration #security #compliance"
