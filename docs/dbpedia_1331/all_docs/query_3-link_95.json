        "text": "(music: The Beatles â âMichelleâ)\n\nWhat role has that song in your life?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYou might want to ask what does Harold Faltermeyer has to do with The Beatles and with âMichelle.â This was one of the songs I adored so much because I couldnât figure out the chords in the first place. This was for a rock band, or for a pop band at that time a very unique thing to do a song which is like a Irving Berlin or a very complicated chord structure.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhatâs complicated about it?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThe chords. I mean itâs not just C, F and G or E, A and then B natural. Itâs a rather complex arrangement of vocals and everything and I had a little band back then and we tried to play this song and it took us quite some time to figure out how it worked.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nHow old were you at the time?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThirteen.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nYouâre were in Bavaria then?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYes.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nHarold is not exactly the most Bavarian spelling, right?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nBut itâs how Iâm called. I have a godfather who was an American soldier and my parents met him when America finally took over Germany and this was one of the rare friendships back then and they didnât have kids and they said, âWhenever you have kids, I would love to be the godfather.â This guyâs name was Harold H. Clark. Thatâs why my name is Harold.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nAnd Munich was, not in the Bavarian sector but in the American sector.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. It was. Yeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nDo you have any recollection of that godfather?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. He always pretended to be an Indian, a native Indian, but he was not. He was an American, typical southern guy. He was a great guy. I remember him being very gentle and very friendly to our family, and as a matter fact, his family supported our family really very good throughout the early years after Germany had to be built up again because everything was destroyed and they helped us, really.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWithout making it sound too gloomy but how did you get access to instruments and all?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nMy family was always known for doing music at home. This was this thing which was called house music back then. This has nothing to do anything with the house music of today but it was music where you played on a Sunday morning. You had friends over and you played like Schumann, Bach and Beethoven or Mozart. And my grandpa was a very good violin player while my dad was a very good piano player and my grandmom was a good singer so they sang like Schumann songs and Beethoven sonatas and everything. Thatâs how I got access to music and as a little kid I said, âI want to learn, I want to study and learn piano.â Which in the first place was a very interesting decision because I didnât figure out, first of all, that I had to study a lot. I thought this comes by nothing. You just sit on the piano and you just play but you had to study and they had a teacher from Romania and she was, I should say a bitch becauseâ¦\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nNot a very nice thing to say.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIt was terrible because she had like a nail file and I played and she was always sitting there and doing her nails and whenever I play the wrong notes, hit me on the fingers. I didnât like her.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIt is interesting because I was actually going to ask you when you get brought up in the German schooling system and it gets to classical music, thereâs all this horror stories about Schumann, Schubert or whatever and what their teachers did to them, like the one that would tie the fingers up to the grand pianoâ¦\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah, terrible, isnât it, huh? Schumann even lost his ligaments because of a thing like this. Yeah, terrible.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nDo you think itâs worth it all the torture?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nBeing a performer, you have to go through lots of hours of study. Otherwise, you donât make it because the competition is just too big. I recall later in the music college, I tried to study piano on the first choice instrument and I couldnât even get accepted at all because I was not good at all because we had so many great players. Funny enough, from Japan, at that time, we had like a student exchange program and the Japanese are known and were known for intensive rehearsals so they were sitting there at the rehearsal rooms day and night, practicing like 10 hours, 12 hours all these complicated Czerny etudes and all the things. They were so much better than the kids from Munich. Of course, what we call Messlatte [leveling rule], I donât know the English word for that. Itâs like the levelâ¦\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThe threshold or the mark.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThe threshold, the mark, was so high that only the best of the best could get in.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWell, what do you expect? âCause at the same time you were just busy hanging out at TV studios.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\n[laughs] Thatâs right.\n\n(video: excerpt from a German talent show featuring Haroldâs first band Melodic Sound)\n\nThatâs whatâs called today like the big casting shows in the States like Americaâs Got Talent or whatever. This was a show in Germany which is like one of the ancient shows who was similar to that.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWas it even German TV or was it Bavarian TV?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNo. German TV. It was German TV, it was the Badische Rundfunk. Dieter PrÃ¶ttel, this guy is one of the most famous TV directors in Germany, or was. He still lives actually. Heâs now 88-years-old.\n\n(video: excerpt from a German talent show featuring Haroldâs first band Melodic Sound)\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\n[translates] âThey write their own material, at least most of it.â Untranslatable â50s youth speak, grown-up person trying to speak that.\n\n(music: Melodic Sound - unknown)\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\n[comments] Thatâs my brother.\n\n[music continues]\n\nThatâs me. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\n[in German] âMelodic Sound aus MÃ¼nchen, die dufte swingen.â\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThese were the days, yeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nâDufte swingenâ¦â Itâs probably translatable as âsmelly swingingâ â whatever thatâs supposed to mean.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\n[laughs] This was an expression thing that we always said, âEs swingt schon richtig dufte.â Thatâs a very German expression for quite funky.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nNot in smelling in bad sense. Itâs an extremely tame way of voicing your dissent. Yeah, I guess pop music at that time was probably very parent-friendly, right? This is not exactly the last Slayer album?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNo. I mean, pop music, especially for a lot of people back then was associated with long hair, with smelly shoes and just being ridiculous and not being decent. I remember that my parents even said, âYour hair canât only be this long and you have to dress decent.â And it was not very respected, especially in our family, this was a family of classical music and I was treated, first of all, like an outlaw because I was playing an organ or I was playing not classical stuff.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nAn organ was also called the Schweineorgel or the pig organ.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nI know or the pig organ, right. Definitely. Yeah. Of course, you had like the pedal where you could make it as loud as you want, so you had like a big advantage against everybody else. If you played together with a piano player, he has his own volume but with the organ, you just hit the throttle and you go. Itâs pretty terrible.\n\nTorsten Schmidt\n\nSome more music from those formative years.\n\n(music: Unknown)\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nSo apart from the fact that the intro would make for a pretty dope sample, what else was going on here?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThis was a song that I recall as a very emotional moment when I was growing up and being a teenager. This was a song, if you believe it or not, we played this in parties we had in the evening. This was the best dancing song when you were eyeballing a girl and you tried to get her on the dancefloor so you dance with her. And I had a girlfriend [inaudible] at that time and I remembered dancing to this song like all night long and holding her really tight and trying to seduce her. [laughs]\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThen would have rewinds on the song and play it over and over?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNo. At the time, you just had to go back to the turntable and just put the needle on start.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIt was that kind of house party?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWho was the DJ at the time?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYou had to be your own DJ. There were no DJs. [laughs]\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nYou were still in school, right?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhat happened when you finished school?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThatâs a really sad story. I was a school dropout, I never finished school. I was just too focused on music at that time already and my grades were really bad so what could I do? It was like the end of everything. First of all, the family said, âOh, youâre going to be a garbage boy. Youâre going to be doing something or open up restaurant or open a bar or whatever.â Itâs not what the family expected because the family was rather educated, lots of professors and educated people and then everybody said, âItâs going to be the end of the family,â because they thought Iâm something in our family, which is a big family, something like the heir of the throne but no way. I was a school dropout but I had one gift, I had a musical talent and my dad found out that he had to support that. So he did.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIn which sort of way did he manage to do that?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nHe went to Munich to the college and he went to the principal of the college, Professor Augustin, I remember. He said, âYou have to listen to my son. He is extraordinary gifted in music and he has to study music.â Everybody back then said, âItâs impossible. He has to make his Abitur. He has to graduate.â He said, âI donât care. He has this talent, I want him in this university.â And he was really, really pushy at that time. He managed to convince the principal to give me a chance and to let me introduce myself. I did and back then, I had something which was almost perfect pitch. I still have that in that way but I donât have a real perfect pitch but related to a piano, I could definitely state and name and spot every note. And so they got interested all of a sudden and there was another guy who had the same gift who was a similar character than I was. Believe it or not, we got both accepted and so I was accepted to study music, of course, with the limitation of never teaching music and not, of course, getting a degree in music. But I studied eight semesters at Munich Music College.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhere did the studio work come in?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nWhatâs that?\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhere did the studio work come in?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThatâs another thing. I dropped out of school around Easter and the semester start was in October. And at that time, my family had a relationship with Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhich is a renowned label.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nVery, very famous record label, especially in the classical field, and they had a studio in Munich. And we had this relationship because there were tenants in the building we owned in Munich and they had the Bavarian distribution, the southern German distribution for the records. At that time, they had to store like thousands and thousands of records, vinyl records. They rented the space. We knew all the guys, of course, and my dad said, âI want you to go the studio and to take some kind of a apprentice in the studio so youâre not hanging around all summer long until the semester starts.â They got me this job as a little kid in the studio just getting drinks for everybody and washing cables and setting up microphones and taking care of the studio. So I did, and as a matter of fact, the first job I ever had in a recording studio was getting a gin tonic to Mr. Max Greger who used to be one of the famous band leaders back then in Germany. That was my first job in a studio.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nDid all band leaders drink gin and tonic?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nSome of them drank whisky, like Bert Kaempfert. He drank a bottle a day. Easy. Actually, he died on the cirrhosis. I found out really quick that technique and the technical field of music is something which interests me a lot. And when the production was gone, like they had a nine-to-five situation back at Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft, then I went back in there and I was like the phantom of the studio. I tried to find out what this amplifier was for, what this limiter was for. They had all this ancient stuff back then like Fairchild compressors, things you would pay a fortune these days. They had this in the studio like tons of them. Remember, we had like 20 Fairchild compressors. One is worth now 15 grand or 20 grand. Back then, we couldnât even use them because the bulbs were broken.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nSome of the stuff was actually being recorded there because obviously now you would remember Deutsche Grammophon from all the massive classical back catalogue, as well as the Neue Musik stuff, and I mean, just like even Stockhausen white labels out there and that kind of stuff, but they apparently did a lot of other things as well at the time.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. The Munich studio was called the Polydor Studio and they occasionally did classical music as well. I actually worked for Stockhausen. I was a little tech then a little later and he was there recording some stuff but mainly this was used for Schlager productions in Germany.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhat is Schlager to the not-German mind?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nSchlager, itâs a German thing. In America some people start to say âOoomp-Tahâ music to it, which is not right. Schlager, you have to see is to the German word for popular music. A Schlager is like something which is a hit. A Schlager actually is a hit. âSchlagenâ actually means âto hit.â Schlager is popular music and is strictly bound to German very profound lyrics, actually. Very, âI love you girl and blah, blah, blahâ things, you know? Itâs very shallow things but it has its audience and it sells millions of records, still does. We have a star right now, which is Helene Fischer who is considered to be a Schlager singer, but she is actually trained as a musical singer. Sheâs a great singer. But she sings songs which I personally donât understand, like the Schlager music, I never really understood. I had to record some stuff in the early days but I was never really great at it because my favorite music was black music, was American pop music, was West Coast music, and I always tried to get some elements of this music back to my productions which was not really appreciated.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhich is a bizarre thing when you listen to Schlager throughout the ages, and obviously, youâre forced to it when you are in a public situation in this country, and that at that time, the string arrangements probably, while now thereâs a lot of drum machines in there and thereâs all these weird little offshoots of it where you figure like, âOh, someone was actually in the studio who really wanted to do his thing but they just have to answer to it or whatever the production was demanding for.â\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah, definitely. There was actually a singer who was really famous back then. His name was Roy Black. This was his artist name. His real name was Gerhard HÃ¶llerich which you cannot have on your record. This guy was Roy Black and he had huge hits but and this was Schlager hits. This was like a very schmaltzy kind of material but the people loved it and this guy always wanted to be a rock singer. He always wanted to be an Elvis Presley-kind of guy, but this was his biggest wish. But he couldnât do it. He always tried to do it but he never ever had the kind of groove you need to sing this kind of rock ânâ roll. He was always ahead the beat and I know that because later in his career, I produced a couple of records with him and it was awful because whenever he said, âI can not do what Iâve always wanted.â And they said, âYou canât do it, you know. Itâsâ¦â âBut why canât I do it?â âYeah, because you donât know how to do it.â âI can.â We had a big fight once but it didnât help. You had to stick with his successful things. Later, he got very depressed and he actually committed suicide then.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhich seemed to be a kind of a common thread. Thereâs others that have like darker elements in their music, like Alexandra also, where you think like a lot of the stuff thatâs actually going on there is, if you played that to a Madlib or Just Blaze, wherever he may be, they would just go and sample it straight away because of all the polyrhythmic stuff thatâs going on, all the weird harmony changes and so on. Is there any stuff that you would point out for folks who like to go for the digging in the crates? Like, âHey, thereâs overlooked Schlager stuff somewhere.â\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYou mentioned Alexandra. She died in a car crash at the beginning peak of her career, which was a tragedy. But she was crazy, she was absolutely nuts. I knew the producer back then very well and he told me the stories. She would have been one who could have been like a German [Edith] Piaf because of her approach to what kind of music she wanted to do. She had a very clear view of what she wanted to do, in opposite to like the Schlager guys, Roy Black or Peter Kraus. Not Peter Kraus so much but Roy Black and Rita Pavone or the guys who we had back then. They didnât have anything to say. They had a producer and they told them what to do down to the word. You didnât have any voice. You were like a slave.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nSo it was like Motown before Stevie [Wonder] was able to get free of it.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. Yeah. It was this kind of situation in the German market. Alexandra was different. She said, âIâm not singing this. I canât sing it.â He said, âWhy donât you want to sing it?â âBecause I canât because itâs bullshit. Iâm not singing this kind of things.â She was very strong about it and she had a brilliant voice and then, like I said, what a pity that she died in a car crash.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhy do you think that system was so strict in Germany while, letâs say, in our neighboring country like France, you have all these guys like Gilbert Becaud, Serge Gainsbourg, LÃ©o FerrÃ© or whatever, who were doing all this amazingly widely diverse things?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIn one way, it was because I recall it as a little mafia in Germany. It was not as todayâs music. There were just two or three big producers and they ruled everything. So they tried, of course, to keep everything in the family. It was even so that the lyrics were written from the wives or from the husbands so they didnât let anybody in and they were so big and they controlled the entire business. They brought a couple of guys to name was a Gerhard Mendelson. He was the guy who produced the Peter Kraus, Freddy Quinn and Rita Pavone. In Cologne, there was Kurt Feltz and Werner Scharfenberger and they did the rest, actually. [laughs] Since they were successful with it, they had like a big word, and so the artist really had a hard time to pass by because the record companies believed in those guys. They were like godlike producers.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWeâre jumping a little bit ahead in time but I want to close the section of by a Schlager-ish thing you did a little later with what folks called the German Frank Sinatra. If you were ever in a German pub at any given time, this would turn into a carnival place right away.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. I think I know what youâre playing.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIf the Internet would be working, I would be. Damn it. Reload here.\n\n(music: Udo JÃ¼rgens â âIch War Noch Niemals In New Yorkâ)\n\n[comments] Hang on. Because you were saying shallow lyrics beforehand. This is probably the ultimate escape song. Itâs a classic Frank Sinatra theme in a way. So this guy, he tells his wife that he just goes and buys some cigarettes and then he happens to talk about the dreams that he never fulfilled.\n\n[music continues] [translates lyrics] So heâs having these arguments with his wife and then heâs like in the chorus, âWell, Iâve never been to New York. Iâve never been to Hawaii. Iâve never been to San Francisco in torn jeans. I was never a free man.â\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. This, in Germany to this point, is like a national anthem. They play it on the Oktoberfest and as soon as theâ¦ Let me say that they only play the chorus, really, because the verses in a beer tent are rather boring. Itâs like very elegic, so they played the choruses and the whole tent is standing on the chairs. This guy, Udo JÃ¼rgens is his name, he just turned 80 by the way a couple of weeks ago, he had a big show back in Germany. He is probably Germanâs really super star. He has a career of more than 40 years, 50 years behind him. Everything he does is really successful and he is actually the crossover between Schlager and pop music because his lyrics are everything but shallow. He had lyrics which are going into environmental problems. He has this kind of things, like in social problems when you have the problem like here with a normal life and you want to break out. He has like world pollution problems or weaponry. He had songs where he stated you should just dump all the weapons right there with the ocean and where the sea is the deepest, and things like this. Heâs a big star. Heâs our biggest star.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhat did you have to do with that particular song?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nI produced it.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThat meant in this situation?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIn this situation to produce was back then, you were the technical and the artistical producer. I actually remember in the original recording, I played this little mouth organ on a [Roland] JP-8.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nSo you got points on it as well?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNot really. Yeah, you get points but not composing points. You get what we call GVL [German Collecting Society] points, which is something else, but this record is still selling and I still get residuals from that.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nItâs playing on the radio once or twice?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. Itâs a big hit. He even made a musical with this song, which has the title âIch War Noch Niemals In New York,â âIâve never been to New York,â which is successful.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nAs you mentioned the Oktoberfest Munich at that particular time when you started working in those studio, started to become famous for what they call âThe Sound of Munichâ as well and we understand you somehow slid into that door somehow.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThatâs a long story, actually. I worked for Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft, like I said, first of all as a little guy who got gin tonics for band leaders but then I got a contract as a tech, as an assistant tech. And a little later, my boss who was a sound engineer, a real sound engineer, had one big problem once. He liked alcohol a lot, and he was drunk, and he was lost somewhere in Munich and the next day 9:00 in the morning, we had a big session with a big orchestra and he didnât show up. I was the only one who was there and the producer at that time said, âCan you do the recording?â I said, âWell, I guess I could but Iâm not allowed to.â Then he said, âI donât care. You have to do it.â Of course, you start sweating because this is like your first chance to be officially on a mixing console. At that time, especially with the Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft, this was a very strict thing. The tech was operating the tapes and the sound engineer was operating the recording console. You canât imagine these things today but this was the way it was back then. So, to touch a fader on a console for a tech was a sacrilege. You couldnât do it. This producer said, and until he died he was a close friend of mine, he said, âIâm going to support you and I take all the shit I will get from my boss. Donât worry. You do the recording.â I was sitting at the recording console and had like an 80-piece orchestra in front of me. Of course, I was sweating because I had to do everything. I had to put up the microphones, I had to run in and out to set up earphones and everything but at the end, I succeeded and I did a great recording. And from that day on, I was something like a sound engineer. Then the studio was closing down shortly after that and was taken over by an independent company. It was called Arco Studios then and they employed me as the sound engineer then. This was my first way into a studio and, of course, parallel to that, I was studying music and so I was at the beginning of a merger between music and technique, which today is a very common thing. Back then, I was one of the first and only.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nI understand you met a certain other person that became synonymous with that Munich sound who was actually not from Munich but from South Tyrolia.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah, Giorgio Moroder. I saw the lecture and you called him HansjÃ¶rg. Itâs actually his name. I know he doesnât like that too much to call him HansjÃ¶rg but who cares? Anyway, Giorgio was working in his famous Musicland Studios, a couple of miles away from Arco Studios, and he heard about me being a crazy wizard. Then, a little later I was employed in Arco Studio and, of course, I had the chance to do my first arrangements for Schlager music or something. I was doing the arrangements. At that time, you had to write the score and you had a copyist who wrote the music to sheet music. And so sometimes, I was sitting at the recording console and out there, we had 20 strings like violins and celli or whatever and I was conducting them from the recording console. This was something really crazy and he heard about that. He heard about this kid. Iâm 12 years younger than he is so he heard about me and said in his unmistakable Tyrolian accent, âFalti, donât you want to work with me one of these days?â I said, âYeah, I would be delighted.â I visited his studios and he mentioned the project he just started which I should do with him and this was the movie Midnight Express. This actually was my first work as a keyboardist and programmer of old vintage synthesizers like Moog and Oberheim and whatever we had in those days. It was my way into the big world of international music because Giorgio at that time was already famous in the States. He had a very strong relationship with Neil Bogart of Casablanca Records. Donna Summer was already very successful and since the movie Midnight Express was, as I recall, a co-production between Casablanca Records Films and Tapes and whatever, he was chosen to do the music. And it was a very exotic approach to do this movie with him and heâ¦\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nExotic in what way apart from the accent?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThis was not the time where electronic movie scores were like the hippest thing on earth. I mean before, we had Chariots Of Fire and other things Vangelis did, but to do like action movies like this â especially one which is done in Turkey â you would have probably expected to use an orchestra or use some very oriental sounds, which later on we did on synthesizers. But it was a unique thing and it was, of course, the genius of a guy like Alan Parker who had the idea of putting an electronic guy into the [soundtrack]. We started to work on that. I programmed synthesizers, and at that day, you had to do it like manually which is playing it onto a tape, tape like this, we will show you later. And the sequencer technology was just at its beginning, we didnât have digital sequencers back then. We only had analog sequencers, which were like voltage controlled step sequencers with like 16 or a row of 16 different settings. And you had to tune every single note and then you could run a sequence and then you playedâ¦ [imitates synth arpeggio]. And when you put in another tone at your keyboard, it transposed that program sequence into another key and thatâs how we did this music. So very, very ancient, Jurassic Park synthesizing stuff back then.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nLetâs take it back to Jurassic Park for a second.\n\n(video: Harold Faltermeyer â âAxel F.â / laughter)\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRick Dees.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nI guess we got better sounding videos of that but we also wanted to give you credit for the invention of wireless MIDI.\n\n[laughter]\n\nThat worked really well in that setup. Yeah?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\n[laughs] Yeah, it did.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nYes. That song, I guess, one or two people have heard of that. Do you probably want to say anything before we go into this thing you prepared like in cooking show beforehand?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. Actually, that was the theme song obviously for Beverly Hills Cop and the interesting thing about that song is that, first of all, nobody wanted to have it. I got close to the fact of getting fired from the movie because I tried several different themes. Nobody liked it and it mostly has to do with the fact that at that time, to score a comedy was always done with an orchestra. It was like this Hanna-Barbera aesthetic, like you had like the orchestra with the cartoonish kind of themes likeâ¦ [imitates classic comedy score] It had everything played live in orchestra. Now, thereâs the idea of doing an electronic score and doing that with one of the most successful comedians we had in America at that time, Eddie Murphy, so the studio was nervous. Everybody was nervous. The only guy who was really not nervous was Marty Brest, the director, because he had a very clear view of what he wanted to have. He wanted to have like the aesthetic of groups like Yazoo or Afrika Bambaataa, these kind of things. Thatâs what he wanted to have. Very minimalistic, no paddings, no... Like my movie before was more or less a Tangerine Dream-kind of approach to the scoring. This should have been totally different. No padding, nothing, just minimalistic patchwork-y kind of sounds. The first two attempts of writing a theme failed. They didnât like it. I said, âWell, Iâll write another one. Donât worry.â Iâm writing the third one and, of course, when you donât succeed and when you donât get what they want, everybody gets nervous. I played them the first couple of bars of âAxel Fâ and I still see as it would have been yesterday. I see Bruckheimer looking at Simpson, Simpson looking at Bruckheimer, Martin Brest looking that, then the editor, Billy Weber said, âNah. It doesnât work.â It was like a situation you were against the wall somehow. What should you do? You just had toâ¦\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nProbably in order to understand the horror of that situation, you might want to talk who that Don Simpson guy actually was.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nOf course, Don Simpson was Jerry Bruckheimerâs co-producer. Don, at that time, was very into drugs and changed his mind on a minute basis. It was like, one a minute you were a star. The next minute, you were fired. It was very hard to work with him. But he had good ideas. Thatâs for sure.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nHe invented high-concept, basically.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nFor example, yeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhich is probably from your view like how would describe high-concept movies?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nAt that time, this was an innovation. This was something incredible and he was the father of it. Yup, Don Simpson, Iâm there with my little melody and we listen again and again and I played them several different variations of the theme. I had it locked up to a different cues to different parts of the movie. I played it and Don said, âI donât know.â Jerry said, âI donât know. What do you think?â Everybody tried to not make a decision. Everybody tried to get somebody else responsible.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nItâs very popular in these situations.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYes. Itâs a really common thing. At the end of the playback, I stopped the tape and said, âWhat do you think?â In the corner, Billy Weber said, âI donât think it works.â Martin Brest, the director was sitting there and I still remember that with his... He always smoked cigarettes with a tip. He was smoking like that and he said, âLet me hear it again.â I played it again. He listened very into it and then the thing was over and there was silence. I said, âWell, this is it now. Either Iâm fired or they like it, what else could happen?â Martin Brest said, âI have to tell you, guys. I think that this is the most perfect cue I ever heard for this movie. I think itâs great. I love it and we should go for it.â Then I won and then Simpson said, âYeah. I think itâs great. Letâs do it.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nThen Bruckheimer said, âYeah. Great. Letâs do it.â And Billy Weber said, âI still donât think it works but you guys do it.â I was in and I did the movie.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nInterestingly enough, it never got to number 1 at the time, even though it was everywhere.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIt was number 1 in England but it was not in America. I was stuck on number 3. Number 1, I had âCareless Whisperâ from Wham! and number 2 was Tears For Fears, âShout.â I was number 3 but it was really there for weeks and weeks and weeks and that was over selling like 20,000, 30,000 less than they sold.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nLess. You donât want to imagine how much that was.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nToday, youâre happy when you sell 30,000, right?\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nPretty happy, youâd go straight number 1.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. What a pity.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nNever got to number 1 in Germany either at that time. No?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNo.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nBut it got to number 1, 25 years later oddly enough, yeah.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nI guess thatâs something we get to in a second. Probably, letâs have a little look at this video. Where was this shot?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThatâs shot in my studio back in Germany because Iâm doing remakes of all my famous themes from the movies for a couple of reasons. One reason is that we have a situation with the movie studios. They are very protective about releasing scores. Iâm getting tons of request of having the scores of my movies and Paramount, for example, does not release it. Now, Iâm out of any re-recording restriction anyways. Iâm re-recording those things. Of course, Iâm trying to re-record it in a manner like you did it back then. âAxel Fâ is the first one I just made a remake of, the next one to follow is Top Gun anthem and Steve Stevens is the guitar player. Heâs going to play the solo again. Then, of course, Running Man, Fletch and all this kind of things, weâre going to re-record and so that we are able to release them and release parts of it, like we did the scores. Then, the next reason why Iâm going it is because we are planning a remix album next year where we invite DJs to make remixes of that songs with the original stems so I can provide the stems and because I played it, I did it new, I own it so I can distribute them and we make this remix album. Thatâs why Iâm doing this.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nDo you find it hard to sonically capture the same kind of energy than in the original recording?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIf you would use modern instruments, then itâs, of course, a lot more difficult. Because like I said, at that time, we didnât have dynamics in keyboard technology so if you forget in todayâs technology to really get rid of everything dynamic, then you would never make it sound as we had it back then. Plus, of course, if you use different instruments and if you use new instruments, they sound different. Even if you have like the best plug-ins for Moog synthesizers, for Roland, this is a JP-8. Thatâs actually the original JP-8 I played âAxel Fâ on in â84 and I still have the original sounds, there on a casette and you just load them in and you have exactly the right sound. If you donât use these kind of instruments, then you would have a hard time to get it. With âAxel Fâ there is a unique thing as well, âAxel Fâ was never a song, âAxel Fâ was always a patchwork. It was a cue with the main theme [imitates âAxel Fâ theme]. Then you hit another cue with [imitates âAxel Fâ stabs], and then you had the marimba cue, which we all called back then the banana cue, because it was the scene were Murphy puts the banana in the tail pipe of the two clumsy cops. We designated this marimba sound to the clumsy cops so this was the banana sound. So these three parts were never linked together in one piece originally for the movie and so we assembled it for the record, and interesting enough is that back then, we had a music editor who did give us a click for each scene, which was optimized to the edits and to the cuts of the scene. They were slightly different, but just slightly, so weâll be talking about half a beat per minute. You had like a tempo which is 118.45. Then you have a tempo which is 118.78 or 119 or 117-something. Actually, I did reconstruct it with this little minor tempo changes and you would think the âAxel Fâ is one tempo but it isnât. It has tiny little differences in tempo. Yeah.\n\n(video: Harold Faltermeyer private footage recording âAxel Fâ)\n\n[comments] Thatâs in my studio here. So the MIDI sequencer is obviously recorded already. Iâm just trying to tweak the sounds. Thatâs a Moog Model 15. Thatâs the original one, which I used back in â85.\n\n[music continues]\n\n[comments] This was the drum machine with the bass drum and the snare where recorded with. Thatâs a unique thing, thatâs how we made the reverse noise. If you want to stop the tape real quick, Iâll explain why. Thatâs how we did the noise, this [imitates sweeping sound] at the âAxel F,â and the reason for that is why is we just didnât take a fader and then cut it is that, on the mixing consoles, those were all VCAs so itâs not like a cut when you cut something. It was like turning off electricity slowly but a couple of millisecond. You would not get the effect like this here to really have a clean cut. Itâs always like a little fade out. We figured the easiest way to do this is just to plug in and just rip out the cord and then you had a real clean cut and thatâs how weâd record it direct to tape because at that time, we didnât have like Logic or something or ProTools where you just take a soundfile and just cut it and itâs clean. So this is another dinosaur of ancient, jurassic way of doing music.\n\n[video continues]\n\n[comments] Thatâs a Roland 100, M100 model. Thatâs how I constructed the footsteps. Thatâs the finish thing then.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWe did miss the marimbas, right?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nWe did miss the marimbas. Right. But I mean itâs just the assembly of that. The sound is, of course, just location sound so you donât hear the real sound but it sounds pretty cool.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nI do understand, seeing that we have this thing here, which is a little too heavy for one hand. We donât have the time to bake this so that it will be in a proper working condition in time, but we do have the copies there, and if you donât mind, Erikâs going to put that on the desk later and you can have a little go with the multitrack of that and do your own little dub mix of it.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. Go for it.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nItâs heavy.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nItâs amazing if you just imagine that whatâs on there today fits on a little stick.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nOn that note, how does it feel when it seems like youâre inventing an entire genre of cover versions? Like...\n\n(music: Axel F cover version)\n\nThen thereâs this guy, you can learn how to play it as well. [stops music] And so on. Countless hours of fun, Iâd say. Thatâs probably one way to learn about the right situation like, if this guy hits, what, 592,000 clicks now, are you getting any of that?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nI donât think so.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhoâs getting that outside of YouTube and Google?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nI think thatâs still a great song and I think itâs a pity that this is not solved but itâs our fault. I mean, the industry should have cut in there a lot earlier but nobody really saw the danger of things like this. Of course, now itâs too late and too many things, and now theyâre trying to catch up with it. And itâs so tough to really get the handle on that because you donât get really help from the governments either. You even have parties, like we have the Pirate party in Germany who says that music is for everybody, you shouldnât get any royalties. I think thatâs a pity. I donât know how to get out of this misery. I know that there are attempts made but itâs still going to be just the fraction of what we should get, I think. Thatâs speaking for you guys as well because you really try to make a career in music where the royalties come from.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nBefore we get to this guy, I mean, there was Paramount before that that probably did not have you participate in your actual own work too much.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. When you sign a contract for doing a score, especially with Paramount, thereâs this is famous word by Henry Mancini who I met actually before he died and we talked. He was a nice guy. Heâs a guy who I really adore and his whole work and everything. He said, âYou know, Harold, you know that the big arc from Paramount, down at Melrose, 5555 Melrose? This huge arc where you go through the gateway and then you are in the holy grounds of Paramount.â And he said, âYou know, this arc has a special meaning. When you would drive or you walk through this arc, you lose your publishing. Thatâs this arc for.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nThatâs the way it is. When you do a score, you have to sign a few publishing and what you do actually is you do work for hire. Of course, you get money but you sign off your video rights and you just get a fraction of that what you should get. On the other hand, in the long run, of course, it pays off, especially with âAxel Fâ or with other things. It paid off because the soundtracks at that time were selling millions. Of course, TV performances and now with Netflix and all these kind of things, you, of course, get some money. Itâs a fraction of what you should probably really get but at least itâs money.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThe thing is, I guess, you just did some more and in the end it all added up and we donât need to worry about you.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nNo, Iâm fine. Thank you.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThereâs this great guy to introduce this thing.\n\n(video / music: Harold Faltermeyer â excerpt from Top Gun score)\n\nThatâs not the original version though.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nObviously, you were an inspiration to folks around the world. How was the work on that little recruiting theme for I guess the United States Marine Corps working out for you?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nFirst of all, there was no briefing. It was the rare situation that I composed the theme before the movie was shot. I had this theme and I recall a dinner with Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson and my friend Keith Forsey, down at Morton Restaurant in Los Angeles. We were having dinner and Bruckheimer said, he was just cutting his steak and he said, âSo do you have a theme for Top Gun?â I said, âOh yeah. I have an idea.â He said, âCan we hear it?â I said, âNo. Itâs not recorded yet.â He was always very fast for several reasons. He said, âI know you can but you didnât record it. So why didnât you record it?â I said, âWell, because I didnât have the time yet.â âSo record it. Can we hear it tonight?â I said, âNot really.â He said, âWhy? You said you have... But at least they could hear it.â I said, âWell, I would have to play it to you on a piano.â âYes. Letâs get a piano and letâs play it.â This was how Don Simpson was. We went to the studio and I played them the theme. They liked it. He said, âWe need a demo for it. We need it immediately.â Actually, Tom Cruise at that time was with us in the studio. They loved the idea of the theme and so I had to make a demo for them and I did do it in that very night and it took me four hours or five hours to get like the first draft of demo together. I came up with this TR-808 sounds at the beginning with this delay and everything and that then turned out to be the intro because they liked it and we just tailored it and we put more stuff on it, strings and everything. So we repeated it all over the place for the beginning, and actually, it was Bob Badami that music editor who had the idea to really loop that at the beginning and not put the real theme, the melody on top. Just put like images on top and just build it forever and forever.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWhen you said to him, âOh, I have a theme for that,â then did he tell you anything beforehand about the movie? What did he want?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYes. What he said is, âWe need a theme for this movie. Itâs about flying.â Thatâs how the briefing was. He said, âHarold, you have to see these guys, these pilots. They are like rock ânâ rollers in the sky. They are waiting for the takeoff clearance and theyâre sitting in the F-14s and they have like a Walkman on.â At that time we had the Walkman with a casette. âThey have Walkman on. They listen to Billy Idol.â I said, âAh, interesting. Iâm writing something rock ânâ roll.â He said, âYeah, but it has to be heroic. It has to be everything. It has to be everything a theme needs.â Funny enough, the first couple of bars I composed was for a totally different movie. It was Fletch with Chevy Chase. There was a scene...\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWeâll get to that in a second.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. There was a scene in Fletch where Chevy Chase dreams to be Michael Jordan, the famous basketball player. And itâs like a dream sequence and he dreams because heâs a big star and I had this [sings] âDa-di-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,â for that very section. And funny enough, we work in a studio where next door was Billy Idol working on his new album. Billy came and we are very good friends, actually, and so Billy work the next door that was playing with my thing and Billy took a break back there and passed by my control room and he opened the door and he said, âHarold, thatâs great. Thatâs like Top Gun. You should use it for Top Gun,â and he left. I said, âYou should use it for Top Gun? Iâm doing it for Fletch.â Then, I thought about it. I said, âActually, it would be a really good idea to have it for Top Gun.â I thought about it more and more, and the more I thought about it, the more I knew this is the theme for Top Gun. I took it off the movie Fletch because this was just a little scene I could compose everything for that, which I later on did. I took away the theme and this was Top Gun, and actually, letâs say Bill Idol was somehow the initiator of the theme for Top Gun.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nLet me get it straight. For one second, you were writing something for a comedian, dreaming to score triple doubles. Next thing, youâre taking that thing to annihilating Russians in the sky. Thatâs mildly different content.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah. You have to be flexible these days.\n\n[laughter]\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIt was an interesting political climate when that movie came.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nOf course, it was still the Cold War and, of course, today this movie wouldnât work. You would have to write it totally different.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nYou somehow have the feeling that the foreign department seems to be...\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIt might come back if we continue like this. No, but at that time, it was just a home run. It just hit the spot. It was this heroic thing. As a matter of fact, thereâs another song in this movie, which is called âMemories,â which is the scene where the partner of Tom Cruise, Goose is his name in the movie, he dies.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nâYou can ride my tail anytime.â\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. Yeah. [laughs] This guy dies and so thereâs this very sad melody. Itâs called âMemoriesâ and thatâs actually one of the favorite tunes they play in Arlington when they have a funeral of one of the army guys. This movie definitely stirred up some things and to me, it was a big honor to do music to a real American domain movie. Normally, you would use John Williams or one of the guys. It was Bruckheimerâs decision and Don Simpsonâs decision that I do the movie.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nIt didnât feel any sort of way weird to you because, I mean obviously, itâs a mildly different situation as a German writing for something that doesnât get much more American than this movie?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nExactly. Like I said, it was the decision of the producers and I felt somehow in one way honored. And in one way, of course, astounded why they didnât use a Native American for that.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nUsing a Native American could be an interesting take on that as well.\n\n[laughter]\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThe record is not fully clear on this one, so Iâm asking you by playing it, whether, and to which degree you have an involvement on this part of soundtrack.\n\n(music: Pet Shop Boys â âBeing Boringâ)\n\nWhat was your role here then?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThis was one of the most interesting productions I ever had together with the two guys from Pet Shop Boys. They came to Munich in 1990 and asked me if I would co-produce an album with them and I said, âI would be very happy to, but why do you need another producer? You guys can do it by yourself, canât you?â They said, âWell, because we want to utilize your skills in vintage synthesizers. This time, we want to make an album which utilizes vintage synthesizers.â We made the deal and we decided to start pretty soon with the production. It was so interesting to work with these guys because theyâre two really great producers. The three of us in the studio and me doing all the work with the synthesizers. At the time, we used a Synclavier for the main workstation and recorded everything on Sony DASH 3324 digital.\n\nAll the days we spent there was like really trying to be on a very high level of creating music. Sometimes, almost really obnoxious because the Synclavier had at the time about 4 or 500 different samples of tambourines. We know that for our kind of music about 10 or 20 qualify for being used but Neil and Chris wanted to hear all the 400 tambourines before they started recording a song and we recorded 13 songs, or 14 songs, so we had to hear all the 400 tambourines until we really got one which we then used. We always used one of the 20 but they wanted to hear everything because they didnât want to make any mistakes, just being accurate to the point and do everything the best they could do. It was a great work.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nHow did they take to Baldham culture then?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThey actually loved it because outside of the studio, we have a little hut where we go in the afternoons for a nice tap beer. They were really keen to go there to the hut, and then going too much to the hut. We did not work really concentrated. So I said, âWe only can go to the hut when a minimum of 40 sectors is written to the disc of the Synclavier,â which is actually not a lot but itâs some kind of stuff. Chris Lowe is the technical guy of the two guys and he knew exactly that writing 40 sectors to a disc is a lot of work when you do normal recording, like a bassline or something. But he knew exactly that once you use like a ribbon controller or a mod wheel or a pitch bend on a keyboard, it eats up lots memory. So whenever we were stuck on like 32 or 35 sectors on disc, Chris came and said, âLet me just do a track.â He entered his Synclavier, I pressed record and I said, âGo ahead.â The only thing he did, just some rubbish but he just pressed the ribbon and the mod wheel and everything and then he said, âSave it.â We saved it and it was 42 sectors. I said, âNow, we can go and have a beer in the hut.â They really liked the Baldham out of Munich culture in the studio, which is really pleasant. They love it.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nBefore we write our 42 sectors, any questions from you guys?\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhatâs your opinion on âCrazy Frogâ?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nâCrazy Frog,â the guys came to me with a first idea. They said, âWe have this idea of this frog,â which was an Internet kind of thing. Like the annoying thing, thatâs what it was called. They said, âWe want to combine âAxel Fâ and the Crazy Frog. What do you think about it?â I said, âI donât know what you really want to do with it.â They said, âWeâre going to show you, right?â I said, âYeah. You have to show it to me.â Then, they showed me and I said, âI donât know.â Somehow, itâs funny. Somehow, I really donât know yet and then they said, âDo we have to ask the movie company?â I said, âYeah. Normally, you would have to ask the movie company.â I said, âWell, but on the other hand thereâs so many cover versions on the market, I would just go ahead and do it. You can do it.â Because then my kids came and said, âOh what is this?â They were young at that time. They said, âWhat is this?â I said, âWell, they want to do this.â âDad, itâs cool. Let them do it.â And I never heard anything about it anymore. I said, âThey can do it.â Then, like a year later, it was done. It was released. All of a sudden, Iâm getting a call from BBC and saying, âCan we do an interview with you?â I said, âWhy?â They said, âBecause âCrazy Frogâ is going to go to number 1, from zero to one, outselling Coldplay four times. Thatâs why we want to make an interview with you.â I said, âFirst of all, this might be a mistake.â They said, âNo, itâs not a mistake. Itâs the truth.â It was a big hit and what should I say? It made a lot of people happy. Iâm probably not the happiest guy with it because I still think that the original one is the one. On the other hand, music is there for everybody and if it made so many people happy, then itâs OK.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nAlso, thereâs a headline saying, âChris Martin hates the âCrazy Frog.ââ\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYeah, he was not amused.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nI didnât think that guy had hate in him, right?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThatâs what âCrazy Frogâ does to you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello there? Hello. Talking about music for movies, when you face the idea of making a movie, of course, I mean thereâs a lot of techniques like follow a leitmotif, these kind of things. What is your main general approach to what you want to say with the music? What are you looking for on it?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nFilm music has a function like every element in movies have a function. What you have to be aware of is that the first in line in a movie is the picture, certainly. Then the next thing is dialogue and then there is the sound effects which are even more important than the music and then comes your music. What you are doing with the score, you are enhancing the feeling and the situation of the scene you have to score. Iâm approaching it so not to disturb any dialogues and, of course, get out of the way of the sound effects. In using instruments with frequency ranges, which are not in sound effect range. Which was actually very hard to do with the Top Gun because with all these jet noises, they have a function like a white noise, which is the summary of every sound. This was very hard to do. The solution for that was, of course, not using pads but using percussive instruments so you get through this wall of noises. You always have to know what you are doing to enhance a scene. If itâs a love scene, youâre, of course, writing a love theme and youâre enhancing that situation, and you have to be aware never to win against the dialogue and the sound effects. Thatâs the way I approach it. Sometimes, of course, the interesting thing in a lot of movies like Beverly Hills Cop, of course, was the tipping is a very interesting aspect. You will play a theme before you see a character, which means you tip it. You make people aware that this is going to happen. This is a dangerous field but itâs always at the end, of course, the choice of the director how you go for it. But Iâm trying, like I said, to enhance the thing and thatâs Iâm aware of the function of scoring.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nYouâre welcome.\n\nAudience Member\n\nSome of your soundtracks sound like soundtracks made by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth back in those days. Is there any relationship between you, apart from the fact that you are using probably some same synth?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nJust say again the name ofâ¦\n\nAudience Member\n\nJohn Carpenter.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nJohn Carpenter. All right.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAlan Howarth.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. Well, thereâs an array of sounds or back then, it was an array of sounds you could use and, of course, everybody, all the composers, somehow they were linked and you looked what the other was doing. That comes in effect of today, for example, where you have like temp music on the movie which is so perfectly done that itâs very hard to do your own music. What happens, actually, itâs a situation where you have the music of Danny Elfman or of James Horner or of Hans Zimmer on it and you are supposed to do your own music. The director falls in love with it and makes you to do this kind of music. Very often, and thatâs I think what Hans said recently as well, is that we are all copying from each other because weâre just copying somebody elseâs temp music. Now, itâs of course different because you have a wider array of sounds, of possibilities than we had back then. Back then, of course, everybody was listening what the other guy was doing. There were like different aesthetics of synthesizer work like Carpenter or you had Kraftwerk, you had Tangerine Dream. You had Vangelis which was one of the pioneers. I adore all of those because they all did great work and I hope that they like my music as well.\n\nAudience member\n\nThanks.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nThe tough thing there, I guess, is if youâre working to spec, no matter whether itâs an advertisement or a film, the people that actually gave you something usually have such a good idea of what they want that no matter what you are doing can somehow satisfy that. How do you deal with that? Other than showing them GarageBand.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. Thatâs the problem. You have to know that as a music composer, you get hired to do the project in a very late process. Youâre hired when they do the post-production. You have to see that the director is working with this movie for years already and, of course, heâs watching his music editor and requesting new cues all the time for new scenes and with todayâs technologies, a music editor has a library of about 5000 movies on his fingertip. He can give you the soundtrack of Star Wars or from Love Story in a split second and they can try all these things out and they work with it and then, of course, they fall in love. You have a hard time doing something new. Thatâs the misery but thatâs the way it is.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi. Just a quick question out of curiosity. Now that you said that you feel like linked to the other composers before you got in the film game, did you feel like you were taking influence from people like Jerry Goldsmith and cats like that from the â70s at all, like did you take anything from that music or John Williams? Not take like steal but influence.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nGoldsmith and Williams, of course, were already inspired by Puccini, by Wagner, by Mahler, and all the old composers. Of course, my favorite inspiration in film music was Ennio Morricone. I think he was one of the most innovative guys in film music. I know that Hans Zimmer is heâs big a fan of Ennio as well. Of course, Williams and Goldsmith are both brilliant composers and I adore what they do. But from the originality, from the spirit and the ideas, the really unique ideas, I think Ennio Morricone is a step further. Or another one is Henry Mancini, Pink Panther is a piece of art. The first time I think that jazz music was done in a cartoon movie, so those are the really innovators and Giorgio, of course, as well.\n\nAudience Member\n\nBreakfast at Tiffanyâs and so on.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nRight. Yeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOne more quick question. Iâm sorry.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nSure.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhen I studied composition, I was wondering being from Germany, if you guys had ever studied anything like from Schoenberg back in that timeline like the idea of Grundgestell. Like little motifs that you variate and things like that, was that anything that you had learned in your training at all? Iâm just curious.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nI touched that field but very briefly because I went on so fast to the pop music field which today, I somehow regret. Right now, for example, Iâm writing a play, a musical and there you need, of course, a lot more ways to express yourself. And sometimes, I really come to a point where I say I somehow regret and really feel sorry about it that I didnât really study this kind of things more thoroughly than I should. But itâs, of course, something which is a very interesting field.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello Mr. Faltermeyer. Thanks for being here.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI have to two questions and the second one is... OK. Anyway. The first one. With your brief encounter with Stockhausen, do you feel that it had affected the way that you work even subconsciously in some way?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nLike I said, I met him briefly. I worked on oneâ¦ I really forgot what this piece of music was, it was very Stockhausen-ish, of course. And I remember they had like a huge array of equipment with ring modulators and things, which at that time were extremely expensive and he had everything. When Deutsche Grammophon heard that Stockhausen is doing something new, he got everything he wanted. Never in my life I saw so many Moog synthesizers than with this recording. I just think that the modern music guys like Stockhausen and company approached the synthesizers from a total different point than we do. They used it as a kind of spice somewhere and they didnât really use it in a beefy way like we always did. Itâs a total different approach and an interesting approach, though. Actually, I did do some experiment with a classical-trained conductor, Gustav Kuhn, and we tried to do twelve-tone music and things like this with the synthesizers, and try to go back to this kind of approach Stockhausen had. Our work unfortunately was never released.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWould be interesting to listen to that though.\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nMaybe.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAlso, I was always confused when I was younger, âAxel Fâ with Herbie Hancockâs âRockit.â I know that many people are still confused. Were you actually like inspired by the song or did you even listen to it when it was out?\n\nHarold Faltermeyer\n\nIt is a very good question. I have to say yes. âRockitâ was some kind of inspiration to the extent that âAxel Fâ has ascending array of intervals. What Herbie did was this, [imitates âRockitâ main melody] âDan-dan-dam-dan-dam-dam-dam-damâ with odd semitones. When you listen close to my work, there is always a faible for semitones, and âAxel Fâ actually has this aesthetic as well. I just think itâs beautiful, and Iâm not writing this to torture an artist because this is very tough sing, but I just love the way semitones work with different chords. You donât change the melody really in big intervals, just change it in little intervals but you change the chord thoroughly. I always love this kind of thing. Itâs very good ears, I have to say and I definitely thought about âRockitâ when I did âAxel F.â Yeah.\n\nTORSTEN SCHMIDT\n\nWow. In that sense, Iâd say, âVielen Dank, Herr Faltermeyer,â and letâs give the man a hand.\n\n[applause]"
