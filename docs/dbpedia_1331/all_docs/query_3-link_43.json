DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\n\nA. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ARBITRATION IS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO BRING SUIT IN COURT.\n\nB. YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:\n\n1. WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and New Jersey Symphony agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate New Jersey Symphony’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances New Jersey Symphony may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\n\n2. WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\n\n3. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this section, the rules set forth in this section will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration action are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1.800.352.5267. To initiate arbitration, you or New Jersey Symphony must do the following things:\n\nWrite a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.\n\nSend three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office.\n\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\n\nC. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and New Jersey Symphony Orchestra will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than $1,000, New Jersey Symphony will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor. Arbitration under this Agreement shall be held in New Jersey, subject to New Jersey law. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nD. AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and New Jersey Symphony, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitration rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and New Jersey Symphony. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and New Jersey Symphony. The arbitrator’s decision may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nE. NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\n\nF. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and New Jersey Symphony in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.\n\nG. OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY at arbitrationoptout@njsymphony.org and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your Name; (2) Your Address; (3) Your Phone Number; (4) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Use. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than thirty (30) days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the Site.\n\nH. CHOICE OF LAW/FORUM SELECTION: In any circumstances where an agreement to arbitrate disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in Essex County, New Jersey.\n\n13. GENERAL\n\nA. Notices.\n\n1. You agree that when you visit our Site or contact our customer service department, you are communicating with us electronically. We will also communicate with you via email or by posting notices on and updates to the Site. By using the Site, you hereby agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.\n\n2. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing or displayed electronically on the Site by New Jersey Symphony. Notices shall be deemed to have been properly given: 1) on the date deposited for postal mail; 2) on the date first made available, if displayed in the Site; or 3) on the date received, if delivered in any other manner. Notices to you may be sent to any of the addresses provided by you on any form on the Site. Except as expressly directed otherwise by New Jersey Symphony herein or elsewhere in the Site, notices to New Jersey Symphony should be sent to: New Jersey Symphony, 60 Park Place, 9th Floor, Newark, NJ 07102, or to information@njsymphony.org.\n\nB. No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.\n\nC. Assignment. We may assign our rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without our prior written consent. Any unauthorized assignment shall be null and void.\n\nD. No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Site or Materials.\n\nE. Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. All prior agreements, understandings, negotiations or representations, whether oral or in writing, relating to the subject matter hereof are superseded and canceled in their entirety.\n\nF. Severability. The provisions of these Terms are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. In the event any provision of the provisions are found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provisions shall be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to render them valid, legal, and enforceable. It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that such modification or restriction may be accomplished unilaterally by us, or alternatively, by disposition of a court of law. If such provisions cannot under any circumstances be so modified or restricted, they shall be excised from the Terms without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions."
