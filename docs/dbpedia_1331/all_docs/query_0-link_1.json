        "text": "LIGO is a multibillion dollar gravitational wave observatory and it recently won its project leaders a Nobel Prize. Most people reacted with approval, but there was a tiny, vocal minority that complained about the flaws in the experimental design. They said that the experiment had not measured gravitational waves at all and that the whole community was not paying attention to critical details. Almost three years later, pop scientists are finally beginning to pick up on what these dissidents have been saying.\n\nDespite initially acting as a cheerleader for the results released by LIGO, people like Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder are finally admitting that we have no way to distinguish a deep-space gravitational wave signal from from something terrestrial in origin and that none of the attempts to correlate gamma-ray bursts with gravitational waves have been successful to date. That means that gravitational waves have not been detected.\n\nThe scientific method requires that you make a prediction and then observe that thing happening. They have not done this. They are writing down what they want to see and then going back through old data to find it. That is not a prediction. It is a postdiction and it is not scientific.\n\nThe scientific method requires that you look at all of the data you gather and compare that to your prediction. They have not done this. They are writing down what they want to see and throwing away all of the data that doesn’t look like what they want to see. That is not scientific.\n\nThe scientific method requires that you are looking for a specific effect. If the effect you are looking for can look like almost anything – as in, it can have a wide range of properties so that you can see it in random data and fit a curve to that data by picking and choosing what you want to see, that is not scientific.\n\nLIGO has been doing all of these things and I’ve been writing about these issues on Quora since 2017 but I differ from Dr. Hossenfelder on one key point. She thinks that while LIGO has been sloppy in their execution of the experiment, the fundamentals of the experimental design are valid because light responds to gravitational waves at a different rate than matter. I think that this is an assumption, not a fact, and that this is yet another way in which the experiment is not scientific.\n\nWhen LIGO announced that they had confirmed Einstein’s theory of general relativity by using general relativity to interpret their data, I saw unscientific, circular reasoning, yet people like Dr. Hossenfelder have been trained to believe that if a measurement fits into a self-consistent framework, then it confirms that framework. That isn’t scientific either, but they haven’t understood that yet.\n\nIf those who designed the experiment knew that it had all of these flaws yet deliberately hid them in a tangled web of complexity, I think that they are guilty of fraud and that LIGO is scam science used to milk billions from gullible politicians. Sabine Hossenfelder doesn’t go that far in her accusations, nor does she object to the theoretical assumptions upon which the experiment is based.\n\nI waxed hyperbolic on these theoretical and epistemological matters in a previous post on LIGO, but in this post, I’d like to focus on more down to earth, technical problems with LIGO. As usual, my underlying theme is: why smart people are stupid — scientists are not as smart as their public reputation suggests. They overfocus and miss the forest for the trees.\n\n………\n\nThe Earth is shielded from the charged particles of the solar wind by the spinning of its core and the magnetic field that it produces. Yet this protective force field is not a static thing. It breathes and oscillates and every time lightning strikes, it sends out an oscillation which can be detected across the world. This is called a Schumann resonance and LIGO is highly sensitive to them. They look just like what LIGO claims to measure: black holes colliding in distant galaxies.\n\nIn more abstract terms, Schumann resonances are extremely low frequency spectrum peaks in the Earth’s electromagnetic field. They are generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere.\n\nLightning never strikes in the same place twice? Think again. Lightning loves mountaintops. Lightning loves colliding air masses. Lightning loves places with an intense magnetic field. That is why the Schumann resonances are not completely random.\n\nSchumann resonances are the main background signal in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz through 60 Hz. They appear as distinct peaks around 7.83, 14.3, 20.8, 27.3, 33.8 Hz and so on, with an amplitude of around a picotesla, orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth’s magnetic field ~30–50 microteslas.\n\nLIGO attempts to measure changes of one part in 10^-21 within a bandwidth of 10 Hz- 1000 Hz and the Schumann resonances overlap with the interstellar, cosmic, gravitational waves in which they are interested.\n\nOf course, it isn’t necessary that LIGO directly detects Schumann resonances for their data to be polluted and unusable. Small fluctuations in Schumann resonances can cause amplitude and phase shifts of the power grid to which all of LIGO’s sensitive equipment is connected. LIGO is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of the power it extracts from the electrical grid and while they carefully measure amplitude changes, they are unable to measure frequency and phase changes because that would not be technically feasible with the accuracy they require.\n\nOne research group looked at LIGO’s first detections and immediately saw a correlation with a shift of the US power grid phase. Since LIGO can only claim to have measured a gravitational wave if they rule out such terrestrial or solar sources, they must take these issues seriously, yet they didn’t. They ignored the criticism and claimed that the engineers who had looked at their experimental design simply didn’t posess the specialized, complex knowledge to make an assessment of their system.\n\nThe article’s claim centers around this argument:\n\n“This means that the 32.5 Hz noise is generated by some kind of oscillator with a resonance frequency close to 32.5 Hz which is powered by a 30 Hz signal, resulting in a low frequency modulation (2.5 Hz = 32.5 Hz – 30 Hz). Obviously, this 30 Hz power source is a sub-harmonic signal from the 60 Hz power source grid.”\n\nhttp://file.scirp.org/pdf/JMP_2016101715421063.pdf\n\n60 Hz noise is always huge and sub-harmonic resonances are common http://www.erlphase.com/download… regardless of power conditioning and you can easily excite a resonance in a broadband oscillator by stimulating it away from the peak of the resonance curve. So, when I looked at the noise power spectrum and saw how broadband the 30 Hz sub-harmonic was, their claim that the sub-harmonic excited a broadband oscillator with a 32.5 Hz central frequency made sense.\n\nThe last claim of the authors was that that the 30 Hz sub-harmonic noise could easily be produced at two locations by slight frequency shifts in the power for the experiment.\n\nThe connectivity of the US power grid was concerning enough to LIGO that they decided to collect amplitude data on the incoming power, but the complaint of the author is that they neglected to collect frequency and phase data. I think that is a legitimate criticism.\n\n“Despite its structural and regulatory complexity, though, the power grid operates on a startlingly simple basis: electricity flows from where it’s produced to its destination through the path of least resistance.”\n\nA Smarter Power Grid\n\nWith only a few locations connecting east to west, protecting them from surges must be quite interesting. The power grid is sensitive to man-made changes and to local geologic events like sun spots and earth’s magnetic field changes.\n\nThis illustrates the basic problem with the experimental design. There are simply too many uncontrolled, local, coincidental sources of error and they have to rule out all of them, even the rare ones.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time that the experimental design had been criticized on these grounds. I remember hearing such a criticism when I was just in college, when the experiment was just starting, but over the years the critics got used to being ignored and lost interest. Meanwhile, instead of concluding that power grid phase shifts make the experiment impossible, LIGOnauts turned a blind eye and soldiered on for three decades until those who had objected to the experiment on technical grounds either lost interest or died.\n\nIn a sense, their experiement was successful because it continued to secure new rounds of funding and the project leaders won lots of awards after a great announcement of success. Their PR operation was on point and they ralleyed a great audience of science fans with the help of prominent pop-scientists.\n\nReal scientists are more skeptical than that and despite a political effort that secured funds to build another gravitational wave observatory in Japan, Japanese scientists saw that the experimental concept they’d been sold was trash. Instead of spending the alloted money and wasting the time and energy of a small army of young, myopic scientists who can be trained to focus on their narrow, ant-like roles without questioning foundations, they politely cancelled their facility — much to the Americans’ dismay.\n\nThe reason that the Japanese scientists gave was that they could not successfully isolate their site from Schumann resonances.\n\nSurely there must be a way to measure Schumann resonances with magnetometers, so that LIGO could rule them out of their data.\n\nSurely.\n\nLIGO did look into the issue and they did buy a couple of magnetometers. In principle, if the magnetometers measure something at the same time that LIGO measures something, that should signify that no gravitational wave has been measured, yet this doesn’t work very well, because for many of their measurements, the magnetometers were not in operation and when the magnetometers’ data is significantly noisier than than LIGO’s data, they will rule out everything that LIGO ‘measures’.\n\nWait, they are using magnetometers to validate the LIGO detections? Weren’t these magnetometers originally used in a first attempt to detect gravitational waves? It is as though Weber’s ghost is making an appearance. Joseph Weber was the original gravitational wave detector maker. He started a worldwide mania for detecting gravitational waves with magnetometer-like devices and it took years before all of the independent measurements were determined to be spurious and caused by local noise.\n\nOne would think that physicists would’ve learned from his example, but no. Once Weber’s legacy was forgotton, LIGO was built. Deluded/scam science lives on and Weber’s magnetometers are used to validate it – how ironic.\n\nI would feel sorry for the scientists involved in this project, but whenever I’ve engaged with them online, they’ve been rather rude and obstinate.\n\nHow would you feel if you found out that the project in which you’d invested twenty years of your life was a terrible idea on every level. Would you just roll with it or would you break everything in sight? I think rolling with it is the better option."
