        "text": "Over the last two decades, I’ve attended eight, seven-day-long old-school neurofeedback programs. I went in because I wanted to hack my brain to maximize the impact I could have on my life. I had no idea how difficult it would be, or how amazing it would feel to come out of that training.\n\nSimply put, I learned how to get out of my own way. I also learned how to remain calm and focused in any situation, and how to ensure I was making conscious decisions from the right place, rather than unconsciously making decisions that were ultimately not in my best interest.\n\nHowever, the technology, while effective, was outdated and only able to train 10-20 different mental variables.\n\nThen I learned about new advances in Neurofeedback technology that allowed me to train up to 8,000 different variables. And by utilizing my own food and supplement regimen I was able to DOUBLE the amount of neurofeedback training I could do. I doubled my training and quadrupled my results.\n\nCombining cutting edge technology in neurofeedback and nutrition with the expertise of top neuroscientists, meditators, and industry leading executive trainers, I crafted 40 Years of Zen: the most powerful 5 Day Neurofeedback Program on the planet.\n\nThis type of training radically changes and improves the way you treat yourself and the way you treat others. I am a different and better father, husband, friend, and executive after having been through it.\n\nAnd now I’m offering the same gift to you."
