(cbsnews.com)\n\n\"Hackers are on a roll in 2022, stealing over $3 billion in cryptocurrency,\" writes Slashdot reader quonset (citing figures from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis). \"And the year isn't over yet.\n\n\"For comparison, in 2021, only $2.1 billion in crypto currency was stolen during the entire year.\"\n\nCBS News reports: A big chunk of that $3 billion, around $718 million, was taken this month in 11 different hacks, Chainalysis said in a series of tweets posted Wednesday. ctober is now the biggest month in the biggest year ever for hacking activity, with more than half the month still to go,\" the company tweeted.\n\nIn past years, hackers focused their efforts on attacking crypto exchanges, but those companies have since strengthened their security, Chainalysis said. These days, cybercriminals are targeting \"cross-chain bridges,\" which allow investors to transfer digital assets and data among different blockchains.... Cross-chain bridges remain a major target for hackers, with three bridges breached this month and nearly $600 million stolen, accounting for 82% of losses this month and 64% of losses all year,\" Chainalysis said....\n\nAll told, Chainalysis said there have been 125 hacks so far this year.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency is not federally regulated or FDIC insured like a bank account,\" the article concludes, \"which means if an account gets hacked, the government will not work to restore a customer's funds.\""
