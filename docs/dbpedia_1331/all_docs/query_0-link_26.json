        "text": "We at Henle are convinced that this early apprentice piece, written by the young Frédéric when he was probably 18, is a „sleeping beauty“ worthy of finally being awakened from its deep slumber. Perhaps it needed a good Urtext edition to find its way to the music academies and concert stages (beginners and unprofessional piano enthusiasts will despair; this piece is a surprising technical and musical challenge!)\n\nMy colleague, Dr. Norbert Müllemann, was, together with Sarah Gerbracht, the musicological editor of this edition. Last week he discussed the piece with pianist Andreas Groethuysen who provided the fingerings. Andreas Groethuysen was intensely involved in this piece, and felt compelled to state:\n\n“Chopin was simply a genius, even at 18!“\n\nAnd: “Any new edition published by Henle should be regarded as a signal to musicians.“\n\nThe entire, highly knowledgeable conversation (in German language) was recorded, and can be listened to here. It starts with a short part of the beginning of the sonata:\n\nDr. Norbert Müllemann and Andreas Groethuysen\n\nNot long ago I happened to read that Chopin’s favourite colour was „slate blue“. Just imagine – even the cover alone would have caused Chopin to appreciate our Henle Urtext editions.\n\nHowever, what must certainly have been of much greater importance to Chopin is the true and exact reproduction of his music. It is known, and reliably so, that he himself never twice performed his own pieces identically, and, by improvising, consistently added new vivacity to his compositions. But in matters of print he was very keen on details; this is evident especially from his meticulous autographs, the copies corrected by himself, and his correspondence with his publishers.\n\nThe reason we, as editors of his music, still have a difficult time with Chopin is that he tended to publish his works simultaneously with different publishers - in France, England Germany – and seldom left us with one definite and authoritative version of a piece to rely on and refer to.\n\nRather, the handwritten clean copies that Chopin forwarded to the individual publishers differed. In addition, the engravers of course would occasionally make mistakes that were not discovered by Chopin or his assistants. As a result most of Chopin’s works exist in two or three authorized editions that unfortunately are not identical in detail. What to do?\n\nIn such cases, one must have much experience with the history of Chopin’s works in order to come to the right conclusions and make correct decisions. Should you, dear Readers, wish to gain more insight into the intricacies of such differing print editions I can recommend a visit to the following site: it’s the fantastic offering of » „CFEO“ (Chopin’s First Editions Online), where you are able to leaf through all these early prints to your heart’s content.\n\nBut at this point at the latest, a wonderful, only recently published standard reference work absolutely needs to be mentioned. It is a must-read for any Chopin enthusiast and every bibliographically interested musician or musicologist:\n\n» Christophe Grabowski, John Rink: Annotated Catalogue of Chopin’s First Editions. Cambridge, {Cambridge University Press} 2010\n\nAnd I’d like to mention three other digital offerings that might not yet be known to many:\n\nFirstly, the „University of London, Royal Holloway“, led by Professor Dr. John Rink, is working on a digital account and commentary of the complete Chopin sources (autographs and printed editions). It is to be expected that this singular project will soon offer much more precise information than the both currently introduced prototypes of Préludes from Opus 28:\n\n» www.ocve.org.uk\n\nSecondly the „Fryderyk Chopin Institut“ in Warsaw is planning a complete digitalization of Chopin’s autographs, his correspondence and other memorabilia as a part of the „National Digital Library“. These Chopin manuscripts have been accepted to the » „Memory of the World“-Programme of Unesco. [Link no longer available] So I would like to recommend that all Chopin fans visit this site from time to time to watch it develop\n\n» www.chopin.nifc.pl\n\nThirdly, you can become better acquainted with Frédéric Chopin via a very well made, informative and quite complete multimedia Chopin encyclopedia (in Polish and English language):\n\n» www.chopin.pl\n\nIt is both an obligation and a matter of course for an Urtext publisher to reproduce the works of a composer as accurately as is at all possible. This is a strong demand, and can in Chopin’s case only be achieved with very much effort. But at Henle we willingly accept the responsibility.\n\nApril 2010\n\nA cosmos of its own: Robert Schumann’s piano Œuvre!\n\nI am happy to admit: I admire Schumann’s piano works and feel that they are almost second to none. To listen to this music (or also to play it on the piano – in my case rather as a dilettante) immediately elates and enthuses me. I have occupied myself with Schumann’s piano works for many years now, only to discover ever new aspects. This oeuvre puts you in open-mouthed (and open-eared) awe, like a stargazer who cannot move his eyes from the sight of the twinkling stars at night. Robert Schumann’s piano Œuvre: a musical cosmos, equalled by no other.\n\nLastly, this is one of the reasons I started the ”Schumann-Forum 2010“. It is my aim, dear readers, to share my passion and curiosity for Schumann’s works with you. Therefore I will offer you lots of information and entertainment during the course of the year. I am convinced anyone truly interested in classical music, and in Schumann especially, will find that Henle has much to offer, and even surprisingly new things among them.\n\nBut there is another reason why I started this kind of a “Schumann blog“ in the Schumann year 2010. I know that many classical music enthusiasts love the Fantasie in C major op. 17, that they cherish Schumann’s “Kreisleriana“ op. 16, and that they are happy when Schumann’s “Carnaval“ op. 9 is listed on a pianist’s programme. But Schumann composed so much more for piano, and most of his pieces are as good as the three I just mentioned. Sadly, too few lovers of classical music are familiar with these pieces.\n\nEven great pianists prefer the well-worn paths – yes, these are wonderful paths! But it is exactly as the famous (Schumann) pianist András Schiff confided to me: Apart from a few often played pieces, the “major part of his piano works are largely neglected”. (You will find the complete comments from András Schiff here)\n\nAs a publisher of the major piano repertoires Henle has a good overview of what pianists the world over are interested in. The anniversary year 2010 seems to juxtapose the two great piano giants of the 19th century and provokes competition. I believe that as early as right now, in April 2010, I can foresee the outcome: Chopin will by far outdistance Schumann in regards to sales figures.\n\nTherefore, I am going to present different piano pieces of Schumann’s during the course of the next months, and I will also introduce different recordings and compare them. I will focus on the lesser known works, but of course I will not neglect the old warhorses. And I will conduct interviews especially with pianists currently recording Schumann, or who have only recently published new Schumann recordings.\n\nBut today, let us look at naked facts and figures that are, even without comment, massively impressive: Schumann wrote 38 complete works for piano solo (36 of which have opus numbers). The Henle catalogue has contained Schumann for decades, but we are only since this month able to offer his complete piano works in Urtext. That means that from now on the Henle catalogue boasts 38 single Schumann editions (one volume per opus; with the exception of the „Paganini Variations“ op. 3 und 10: they are combined only in one volume. On the other hand, you will find the two “best-sellers” op. 15 and 68 both seperate and combined; hence we have the total of 38 volumes).\n\nIn addition, we can offer the collected piano works in a set of 6 volumes, available in the traditional blue paperback binding, or fine cloth binding. The collection is also available as a study score in six small-scale volumes. That makes a grand total of 56 volumes of music. (Schumann experts will appreciate this number.)\n\nA few days ago we positioned all our Schumann piano editions on the stairs in our building and took a photo.\n\nInterested in statistics? The Henle editions fill about 0,60 running metres of shelf space, laid out top to bottom you role out a 17 metre long carpet with a total weight of about 25 kg. But what will interest musicians more: the volumes contain exactly 1,216 pages of music (in Henle engraving quality), that’s about 15 hours of consistent play. I collected the bibliographical data and play times for each opus. The information is here.\n\nThe Henle website offers a complete and current compendium of Schumann’s piano oeuvre. And, more important, the facts are musicologically proven. So, it is not without pride that I say Henle is unique in what they have to offer special Schumann enthusiasts.\n\nOf course, the diverse offerings on our website are also intended to awaken your interest to purchase the music from your dealer.\n\nI am equally proud of my colleagues at Henle. They succeeded in meeting deadlines and time limits to ensure that the new Schumann Urtext editions would be printed and available in time for the Musikmesse (music fair) in Frankfurt (24.-27. March 2010). It was a remarkable feat and an exertion. We are all exhausted and very, very happy to have accomplished the impossible.\n\nBut now it is high time to allow the critical editor of all our Schumann editions to speak. Many years ago Dr. Ernst Herttrich commenced the Herculean task of completely re-editing and new-editing Schumann’s piano works for Henle, opus for opus. Allow me to express my gratitude for this truly great achievement. When we phoned Dr. Herttrich, who lives in Berlin, to announce the successful release of the editions in time for the Musikmesse, I think we heard the sound of the weight falling off his shoulder.\n\nDr. Ernst Herttrich\n\nI talked at length with Dr. Herttrich about his work as a musicological editor and about the differences between the old and new Henle Urtext editions of Schumann. The transcript of the conversation (in German and English) is divided into two parts. You may read the first part here. In the second and last part of the interview Dr Herttrich especially comments on the peculiarity of pieces handed down in two different versions, both acknowledged by Schumann. In most cases Henle publishes both versions, offering pianists and listeners interesting new aspects. Find out more here.\n\nThe new Schumann edition in six volumes which contains all, really ALL of Schumann’s piano works, has caused quite a stir in the world of piano musicians. This was made evident also by the demand for the Schumann edition at the Frankfurt Musikmesse that closed just two weeks ago end of March. Dr. Norbert Gertsch, our head of publishing and main person responsible for the timely completion of this giant-size project, is proud of his colleagues in the editing department, production and sales. I invited him to explain why we think that the new Schumann edition surpasses not only the former editions published by Henle, but all other editions available on the world market. We recorded our conversation for the „Schumann-Forum 2010“. You can listen to our conversation (in German language):\n\nor read the written summary which is available in German and English. I wrote this précis because I believe that the information Dr. Gertsch gives is of special importance to musicians. Summary\n\nAngela Hewitt and Dr. Wolf-Dieter Seiffert\n\nA few days ago I had the honour to meet with the wonderful Canadian pianist Angela Hewitt, „Artist of the Year 2006“ (Gramophone Magazine) and “2010 Instrumentalist of the Year” (MIDEM Classical Awards). Her » homepage diary contains an entry from 6. November, 2009: “I was never so happy as when playing an all-Schumann programme and I think that is really true. I adore his music and it gives me the chance to say so much.” Find out here why Angela Hewitt sometimes enjoys imagining that she is Clara Schumann ... and other things more:\n\nSoon Ms Hewitt will record her second Schumann CD, presumably to be released in 2011. Her first Schumann CD, published in 2007, on which she plays the first Piano Sonata op. 11 and the Humoreske B Flat major op. 20 was rightly highly recognized. Attila Csampai wrote: „Now (at last) that wonderfully sensitive piano poet from Toronto has opened the doors to German romanticism, and has delivered, with two of Schumann’s less popular early works, a perfect document of her pianistic grandeur and highly developed sound sense“.\n\nIn accordance with our Urtext philosophy we regard the original metronome markings as crucially important and worthy of acknowledgment, and of course they are included in our editions. Thankfully the Schumann research centre Robert-Schumann-Forschungsstelle e. V. Düsseldorf collected all of Schumann’s metronome markings and provided us with a very useful overview (Schumann did not add metronome markings to all those works that do not appear in this list).\n\nList of Metronom markings\n\nSchumann’s metronome markings are at least as much subject to dispute in their validity and bindingness as Beethoven’s. We tend to regard some as too fast, others as much too slow. I am thoroughly convinced that it is worthwhile not to ignore these instructions, and that quite to the contrary, they afford a closer look. They are a benefit actually, and not a bother. (And should one still choose to play Schumann’s pieces in a distinctly different tempo than intended by the composer, at least it will be a conscious action).\n\nFor this forum I conducted an interview with one of the best experts on Schumann, Dr. Michael Struck (musicologist, pianist and 2009 award winner of the “Schumann Preis der Stadt Zwickau”). He has applied himself intensely to the subjectz of Schumann's metronome markings and published several much-acknowledged articles in the past years. Dr. Struck would like to encourage musicians to take Schumann’s metronome markings more seriously, for they are neither wrong nor unplayable. Schumann (and his contemporaries) interpreted “slow” as a tempo much more fluent and in motion than we do today.\n\nMay 2010\n\nIn the lovely month of May, dear Readers, I would like to take a precise look at two piano pieces of Schumann. They are so far apart from each other they couldn’t possibly be more different. I am going to talk about \"The Prophet Bird\" from \"Waldszenen\" (\"Forest Scenes\") op. 82, and the Toccata op. 7 in C major that I will introduce on 15. May. And herewith we are able to immediately understand the gigantic intellectual, compositional and also technical range of Schumann’s piano oeuvre. It reaches from the introverted and restless piano piece of positively religious depth – \"doable\" for the well-practiced pianist – to the \"unplayable\" Toccata that expresses nearly inexhaustible energy and uplifting, unclouded enjoyment of life.\n\nI hope that the following pages bear new information even to the many professional pianists among my readers.\n\n\"The Prophet Bird\"\n\nSchumann’s \"Forest Scenes\" op. 82 were first published in print 160 years ago (1850). Today this stroll through the \"musically enchanted forest\" (labeled as such by a 19th century critic) is often a bit condescendingly commented on by some. These are the people who greatly admire the young, innovative, genial Schumann, and they are not willing to equally appreciate the more subtle \"Forest Scenes\". Number 7 is certainly an exception: the mysterious, unbelievably poetic \"Prophet Bird\" continues to magnetize pianists and music listeners to date.\n\nAt the risk of sounding nitpickingly arrogant I must say that, in my opinion, only very few recordings of \"The Prophet Bird\" are truly convincing. There are wonderful light and playful recordings like those by Claudio Arrau or Alfred Cortot, dreamy ones exist by Arthur Rubinstein or Mayra Hess, and then there are also extremely willful historic recordings by Vladimir de Pachmann or the violin adaptation by Jascha Heifetz. Those are all valuable examples of the reception history of the piece, and certainly worth hearing in to (all of the above mentioned and many more can be found on YouTube). But as far as I am concerned they all lack one thing, they are not true to the original text.\n\nFor, Schumann’s \"Prophet Bird\" differs from (almost) all other Schumann pieces in that it uses the right (and left) pedal to determine the piano sound. Schumann was pedantic in his notation especially of the pedal markings in this piece:\n\nClick on the following link to read Schumann’s autograph. There can be no doubt as to Schumann’s intentions, and the Henle Urtext edition follows his instructions.\n\nSchumann’s autograph of the \"Forest Scenes\" is taken from the Henle facsimile edition.\n\nConsequently, Schumann’s pedal markings are an intended and important part of the composition. But hardly any musician respects them. Next to Clara Haskil’s recording (also on YouTube) that many piano enthusiasts rightly favor, there are at least (only?) two further recordings that not only follow Schumann’s original intentions, including the important and sophisticated pedal markings, but are also wonderfully expressive.\n\nOne was recently released on CD; a recording by Andreas Staier [Robert Schumann: \"Hommage à Bach\". Harmonia Mundi France HMC 901989] whose play on an Erard grand piano succeeds in communicating the enchantment of this piece. The other recording is by Wilhelm Backhaus. There are both a studio and a live recording by Backhaus, both made in the 1950s. Everything here is perfect. Backhaus’ live CD recording is published by the label Profil (no. PRF 07006) and it’s a must-have for every piano enthusiast; it also includes a spectacular performance of the \"Hammerklavier Sonata\").\n\nOf course I am not familiar with all of the almost 50 recordings of the \"Prophet Bird\" listed at www.arkivmusic.com (the worldwide number one source for classical recordings). But I have listened to very many of them, and apart from Staier, no one has recently played it as \"right\" as Backhaus did.\n\nFor all of you interested in finding out how and why Schumann uses the pedal as such an important component of \"The Prophet Bird\", and for all those piano players also interested in other practical pointers (fingerings and solutions for the falsely notated main theme) I wrote the following essay. It focuses on the music itself, but is of course also my personal interpretation. In the G major middle section Robert Schumann quotes another piece and – for the first time in the history of Schumann research – I believe to have found the evidence to trace this quote correctly:\n\nRobert Schumann, „Vogel als Prophet“ (Nr. 7 aus „Waldszenen“ op. 82). Some Ideas and Performance Pointers\n\nI transferred the ideas from this essay into the three sheets of music from the Henle edition. If you wish to seriously concern yourself with Schumann’s \"The Prophet Bird\" at the piano please print these pages out:\n\n„Vogel als Prophet“ with annotations\n\nAnd in honor of this first day of May I would like to conjure a funny bird on your screen (to see the bird you will unfortunately need to view an advert first):\n\nThe Thematic Catalogue of Robert Schumann's Works\n\nJune 1, 2010\n\nDear Mr Schumann,\n\nIn only a few short days the entire musical world will celebrate your 200th birthday. In your honour, festivals will be staged everywhere, from Düsseldorf, Germany to Mumbai, India, to Luzern, Switzerland. For a good overview of the events (especially in Germany) I suggest a visit to: www.schumannjahr2010.de. Newspapers and journals (e.g. the June issue of the German music magazine FonoForum) will report on your immortal music and your eventful life. All over the world the air will be filled with the sound of your music.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart I would today like to thank you for the rich and more than generous musical gift you bestowed on us, and I would like to congratulate you on your 200th birthday. Of course I am not empty-handed, I have a gift in return. Please read on.\n\nSince its foundation G. Henle Verlag has benefited from your oeuvre. Over the years, however, we have also invested much effort and money in publishing your complete piano works from Opus 1 to the posthumous Variations in E flat major in newly revised, philologically and aesthetically highly satisfying editions.\n\nToday, however, I wish to recommend a very special book of ours. I am confident that it will excite you to the same extent it has many of our customers who purchased it: the Thematic Catalogue of Robert Schumann’s Works.\n\nIt was published seven years ago and is since regarded to be THE reference work for your musical oeuvre. Just as you had always wished it contains an exact list of all of your compositions, those with and without an opus number, those that you completed and those that were left us only in fragments; commented in detail, explained and made accessible through numerous cross-references and indices. Our author, Margit McCorkle, invested ten years of her life into this book. The Peter Klöckner Foundation provided a stately amount to support the funding.\n\nDear Mr Schumann, please have a look at our truly substantial collection of information on the Catalogue of Robert Schumann’s Works. Simply click on \"Details\" or on the image of the book cover.\n\nOf course the book is not my gift to you. Rather, the gift is a novelty. Please “unpack” it and study it. I do hope very much that you will enjoy it, as do especially the author of the Thematic Catalogue of Robert Schumann’s Works, and the entire staff of various Schumann Research Institutes. They joined in work for this special gift.\n\nFor, from today on, all the new information collected since the first publication of the Thematic Catalogue of Robert Schumann’s Works will be posted on the website of G. Henle Verlag. These “addenda” and “corrigenda” are immediately freely accessible for all online-visitors and will supply a current record of new findings for the catalogue of works, all in regards to your compositions. I know of no other composer’s catalogue of works that makes use of this innovative method to consistently remain “up-to-date”.\n\nMay 15, 2010\n\nI have been promising a sensation of sorts, and here finally it is: Schumann’s famous Toccata in C major op. 7 (1834) in a hitherto almost unknown early version dated 1830. Thanks to the generosity of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York we had access to Schumann’s original autograph and were able to edit it with a strict eye to Urtext compliance. Just a few weeks ago we published it in print.\n\nSchumann’s handwritten early version is by no means simply a slightly differing draft of the actual much loved print version of the Toccata op. 7. \"The correspondences between the two versions are so few that one must actually regard the print version as a new composition\" – thus the editor Dr. Ernst Herttrich in his preface of our Henle Urtext edition (to view the entire preface and / or critical commentary go here)\n\nIn the following, dear Readers, I would like to give you a short introduction to this G. Henle Verlag edition of a Schumann piece (as an add-on you will find a list of links to all of the audio and video recordings of the familiar Toccata in C major op. 7 that I could find.\n\nOf course I do hope that especially those of you who play the piano will purchase the new Henle edition in order to make your own opinion.\n\nThe manuscript of the premiere early version of the Toccata of 1830 – Schumann significantly titled it \"Exercice\" – was formerly owned by the great pianist Alfred Cortot. Cortot did not only bequeath us with immortal sound recordings of many Schumann pieces (unfortunately the Toccata is not among them), but he also edited the complete Schumann piano works for the publishing firm Salabert within the collection \"Les Éditions de travail\". Interestingly, in the respective edition in this collection (book number EMS 5446/D1) Cortot only included the familiar version from 1834. The Henle Urtext edition has both versions printed one after the other.\n\nThe so-called early version of the Toccata op. 7 (\"Exercice\") is a fascinating piece. Schumann’s study mate from Heidelberg, Anton Theodor Töpken, reports that Schumann himself played it \"quite often and peculiarly, in a calm and moderate tempo.\" Of course it does have, apart from being written in the same key, C major, and sonata form, significant congruencies with the later \"Toccata\". Both movements are undoubtedly bravuras, impressive beyond measure. They both originate from the spirit of piano exercises, peppered with frightfully difficult demands to even the best of piano technicians. But they are by no means \"etudes\", because they are far too original for that kind of classification. Both movements sound like an unstoppable forward-pushing (steam) engine, because there is only one form of motion. Instead of versatile rhythms you have continuous, uninterrupted sixteenth notes. Without pause or rest, inexorable, forceful, in other words with motor energy. Both movements start, after a short opening curtain, with the same characteristic double change of the fingers 1+5 → 2+4 → 1+5 → 2+4 etc. of the right hand. And both pieces have the difficult-to-play repeated octaves in the middle passage in a minor, a passage that can only really be mastered easily by true piano virtuosos.\n\nIt might not demand so much musicality to play Schumann’s Toccata and the early version thereof, the \"Exercice\" – but, yes, you need to be a \"piano virtuoso\". Because you need skills that are otherwise only necessary in professional sports: tremendous strength and simultaneously a looseness of the limbs, tremendous endurance, extraordinary jumping skills and, finally, nerves made of steel. For this reason we seldom hear the Toccata performed in concert halls (not few of the great pianists of yesterday and today never performed the Toccata), but it is often played in music academies. It is an ideal \"training piece\" for young, prospective pianists.\n\nAnd this applies even more to the \"Exercice\". The technical difficulties are positively compact, and, in comparison to the Toccata, increased. The short, song-like points of rest in the Toccata are not yet there, they are completely missing. One example is the friendly, dotted melody (first introduced in m44 ff.). Only a very detailed comparison would draw an exact picture, but I must leave this up to you. There is not enough space here. But what is clear is that this piece encloses into a sweeping musical river very many extreme finger exercises that are incredibly demanding to the highly skilled piano player.\n\nThe \"Toccata\" is 100 measures longer than the \"Exercice\". And not because it accumulates more technical difficulties, but rather, because the composition is more sophisticated and balanced than the \"Exercice\". This applies especially to the harmonic professions that, in the early version, tend to remind one of certain uninspiring modulation exercises, though unusually fast in tempo. The very beginning already does not savour the first stroke of the C major space the way the \"Toccata\" does; after only 4 measures we have been moved to E flat major (the Toccata allows 14 measures).\n\nAnd, since we are already quietly criticising the \"Exercice\", let me add that in many instances it lacks the measured rhythmic pulsation of the \"Toccata\", where the last finger of the left hand beautifully pulls through: short – long – short / short – long – short etc. This is magnificently compressed and already set on track in the first very strong opening accords. In contrast, Schumann starts the \"Exercice\" with a veritably presumptuous accord cascade. Here the composer attempts to surprise rather than convince. And this follows through to the end, which in the Toccata quietly fades (criticized by Friedrich Wieck), while the \"Exercice\" ends just as it began, with a stroke of thunder.\n\nAnd yet, the early version is a stroke of genius, and especially an alternative draft to the etudes of his time, that Schumann regarded as stultifying. How intensely, almost self-destructively Schumann trained his fingers is commonly known. Friedrich Wieck himself maintained that he wanted to make him into an even greater virtuoso and musician than Moscheles and Hummel, two of the most greatly admired musicians of the time. (There are certainly references to Hummel’s piano sonata op. 81.) Wieck was obviously most successful in the technical education of his daughter Clara. With Schumann he was doomed to failure. For the seed of composition-artist was already planted in Schumann, he was never the born technician. One almost has the impression that the chains he had laid himself sprung when Schumann finally ended his career as a performing pianist. And that was his breakthrough to his true fulfilment. \"One should hear the music from inside out\", he entered in his journal on June 5, 1831! Barely a year later, his career as a piano virtuoso came to an end, due to irreparable physiological problems with his right middle finger.\n\nIf you are interested in Wieck’s numerous systematic finger exercises I advise you take a look at the \"Klavierstudien\" he published. You will find there several models that surface in Schumann’s \"Exercice\" and \"Toccata\" in variations and more sophisticated form.\n\nThe transformation of the unpolished diamond \"Exercice\" (1830) to the sophisticated virtuoso-\"Toccata\" (1834) symptomatically occurs exactly in during those decisive years of Schumann’s conversion to greatness. The knowledge of both works, therefore, allows us on a musical level to better understand the development and growth of Schumann. In these few years he matured and transformed himself from the prospective skilled pianist who could also compose, to the composer who could play the piano. A crucial, no THE crucial difference.\n\nLastly, Schumann already points out the intrinsic difference of the two pieces in his titles. The originally youthful and show-offy \"Exercice\" is transformed to a \"less wild, more polite\" Toccata (Schumann to Töpken on 18. August, 1834). Thus he actually positioned the work (and himself as composer) in the larger context of music history that reaches from the Claviermusik of the Early Baroque period (take Frescobaldi, for example) to many of Bach’s works (I am always reminded of the Prelude in C minor from the Well Tempered Piano BWV 847) and lastly to Debussy, Ravel, Chatschaturjan and Prokofiev, to name only a few famous examples. You will find an extraordinarily rich \"Toccata collection\" here )\n\nAnd now, after so many words, here is a list that certainly some of you will find highly enjoyable. Over the past months I have continuously collected all of the Toccata recordings my fingers on the keyboard of my computer were able to locate. (Of course a recording of the \"Exercice\" does not yet exist, since it was only recently published by Henle). If you notice anything missing in my list, I would be grateful if you would be so kind and notify me by e-mail (davidsbuendler@henle.com)]. Then, over time, the readers of the Schumann Forum 2010 would help me to complete my list, that today includes 57 items. Thank you!\n\nList of Toccata recordings\n\nIn many cases the list contains direct links to the recording (thanks to YouTube). Or else the record labels offer online audio excerpts.\n\nI admire all of these pianists. Unquestionably they rise to the challenge of one of the most difficult piano pieces of Schumann, and the entire piano literature. I am especially impressed by those performances where the players unfold great motor energy, holding the initial tempo and still offering a stimulating play of all the notes. Without a doubt Tang Ying from China is speed master. To the very sweaty end he succeeds in keeping the unbelievable tempo that was once set – but not held - by the legendary Simon Barer. However, other recordings overwhelm and excite me even more. (I marked my favourites that I strongly suggest you listen to in blue colour on the list.)\n\nTo conclude I would like to point you to one of the recordings from the Olymp of Schumann Toccatas: György Cziffra is indeed the master of all disciplines. He seems to genuinely enjoy the challenge of this horrendously difficult, wonderfully forceful, modern, vital piece. He plays it with the persistent drive it demands, and still maintains his ease.\n\nJuly 15, 2010\n\nHow “difficult“ to play are Schumann’s piano pieces actually? Not only technically, but also from a musical aspect? I assume, dear piano players among my readers, that your answers to my question would for the most part be quite similar. Most of Schumann’s works are for very practiced pianists, only few pieces can be mastered by beginners, even with diligent practice. I wanted have a closer look and asked Rolf Koenen, who is a highly experienced pianist and professor of piano in Berlin, for guidance. The original idea of determining the level of difficulty for each of Schumann’s piano works and ordering them accordingly soon became a major undertaking; meanwhile Rolf Koenen is entrusted with the challenging task of classifying the complete G. Henle piano catalogue by level of difficulty from 1 (= very easy) to 9 (= very difficult). By the end of the Schumann and Chopin year 2010 Professor Koenen will have worked his way through many thousands of individual movements. Already today visitors to our homepage will find the result of his impressive work so far, the highlight of which is at this point the classification of the complete works of Schumann and Chopin.\n\nHow to find the classifications? Quite simply. On our homepage you go to “catalogue“, select a composer and/or a specific title (i.e. Schumann, Album für die Jugend), click on it. The sub-category “levels of difficulty” (also accessible via “contents”) leads you to a detailed overview of the contents of the respective volume with indications of the level of difficulty for each piece (in our example the individual pieces that together form “Album for the Young”) as determined by Rolf Koenen.\n\nWell, to answer this question I visited the online-catalogue on the Henle homepage and entered a combined search for Schumann under “composer” and piano for two hands under “instrument”. The search result is quite pleasing for the relatively gifted pianist. Granted, many pieces (among them the well-known cycles) range on the higher levels of the scale “very difficult” (= 7-9). On the other hand, there are some few “easy” pieces, not only from “Album for the Young” op. 68, but also other pieces. “Children’s Scenes” op. 15 (nos. 1 and 13), “Three Piano Sonatas for the Young” op. 118, no. 1 is “easy” (category 3), also “Wiegenliedchen” and the Larghetto from “Album Leaves” op. 124. However, that more or less completes the easy category. What is truly surprising (at least to me) is that there are many “medium difficult” pieces by Schumann (categories 4-6). The ambitious amateur will encounter several pieces that he can master, and not only that, there are pieces that allow you to reach that level of accomplishment where you play with true joy. Here is a list of those pieces:\n\n„Papillons“ op. 2\n\n„Intermezzi“ op. 4\n\nsome of the Fantasy Pieces op. 12\n\nthe larger part of “Children’s Scenes” op. 15\n\n“Arabesque” op. 18 (that lovely piece!)\n\n“Flower Piece” op. 19\n\nthe middle piece from “Three Romances” op. 28\n\nmuch from “Album for the Young” op. 68\n\n“Forest Scenes” op. 82\n\nthe by far larger part of “Coloured Leaves” op. 99\n\n“Three Piano Sonatas for the Young” op. 118 nos. 2 and 3\n\nmost of “Album Leaves” op. 124\n\nlast, but not least “Seven Piano Pieces in Fughetta Form” op. 126\n\nSo, we see, even for the amateur Schumann does have some worthwhile and playable pieces to offer!\n\nJuly 1, 2010\n\nThis is probably Robert Schumann’s most famous composition. The title alone reads as a definition and characterization of “romanticism”. The epitome of the peak of the romantic period in German music history. How many hundreds of pianists have played Schumann’s “Träumerei” so often, so beautifully and above all soooooo slowly! A strong tradition that, whether consciously or subconsciously, you are compelled to follow when you sit down to play the “Träumerei” on your own piano.\n\nAnd yet, the snail’s pace at which we are accustomed to hearing Schumann’s “Träumerei” is a great mistake. A hereditary defect (that originated from Clara Schumann). There are considerable, and truly convincing reasons against the slow tempo. Let me elaborate.\n\nIn my previous entry on the Schumann Forum (June 15, see below) I presented an overview of all of Schumann’s authentic metronome markings. I quoted a leading expert on Schumann who concludes that all of Schumann’s tempo instructions should be taken seriously and regarded at least as relevant pointers. It is certain that they were intended by Schumann and were not mistakenly noted. Today, as a sort of acid test, I would like to present to you Schumann’s most famous piano piece, played as he intended, at “MM quarter note = 100”. Because the piece is traditionally played so slowly, today’s pianists reaction is to say that Schumann’s tempo is fantastically fast. Too fast. But, is it really too fast?\n\nI asked Michael Schäfer, a wonderful pianist and professor of piano at the Musikhochschule in Munich, to play the “Träumerei” in the original tempo. Before you shake your head, please listen to the piece, played only for us, exclusively for our forum:\n\nThe pace is unaccustomed and disturbing. Because we are used to hearing it differently, and have learned to love it that way. But if it were the first time you listened to the “Träumerei”, then you wouldn’t be disturbed at all. You would hear a beautiful piano piece in fluent movement with a recurring main theme with versatile and harmonious variations. Delicate retardations and accelerations make the music talk to you. Andreas Staier has since recorded it similarly and I hear from different corners of the music world that increasingly more renowned pianists are beginning to take more heed to Schumann’s metronome markings, including those of the “Kinderszenen”. Their concerts and recordings, I am strongly convinced, will set a new tradition.\n\nI interviewed Professor Schäfer and asked him how he felt at tempo 100, and was of course curious to hear his general opinion. His answer surprised me; he said he was very grateful for this “experiment”. He is now convinced that only the original tempo, or one very close to it, does the “little thing” (as Schumann himself called it) justice. So, in this case, the tradition is wrong.\n\nAugust 15, 2010\n\nEichendorff’s poem Mondnacht, often translated as “Night of the Moon” unquestionably ranks among his best. It is said to be one of THE favourite poems of the Germans. That I can easily believe, for even the oh so “modern” citizens of the 21. century can hardly remain untouched by the magic of these three verses. And the reason is not only Eichendorff’s positively shattering command of language, his characteristically desirous tone and the subtle intertwining of nature and personal inner reflections. Eichendorff’s strongest poems point further towards greatness, towards metaphysics, and yes, religion. This is clearly the case with Mondnacht, and the key word is “meine Seele” [my soul] (first line of verse 3). The image of death is tenderly and touchingly portrayed as the soul quietly returning home, and we experience death in this context as a liberation from earthly weight and bitterness (thus, in an excellent essay, Wolfgang Frühwald, Professor of German literature). And one should also not overlook the simple fact that Mondnacht belongs to the “Spiritual Poems” within Eichendorff’s collection.\n\nIn her preface to the Henle Urtext edition of Schumann’s “Liederkreis” op. 39, in which Mondnacht is the 5th in a cycle of 12 songs, the editor points out that “the religious overtones of the text of Mondnacht were apparently still recognised, for this song was performed on 22 September 1856 at the musical commemoration ceremony for Robert Schumann in Dresden” (Kazuko Ozawa). Click here to read the preface and other information on the newly published Henle Urtext edition. Interestingly, Schumann created four different versions of Mondnacht; you will find them all, together in print for the very first time, in the new Henle edition.\n\nTheodor W. Adorno rightly making reference to Goethe’s dictum remarked that “it is very difficult to speak about Mondnacht, as is the case with all things created to great effect.” And yet, I would like to attempt an approach to the singularity of this especial song. For Clara Schumann, to whom the entire Liederkreis cycle is closely connected, Mondnacht in any case had great importance. From Berlin she wrote to her fiancé, who lived away in Leipzig: “It is deeply melancholy, and so sad that I cannot sing it at all without it bringing sorrow to me” (15. May, 1840).\n\nAnd there is a hidden, and I assume till now undiscovered beautiful musical allusion from Robert to his bride: the melody of Mondnacht literally cites the beginning of the most famous Beethoven song with the significant title “An die ferne Geliebte” (op. 98) [To the distant beloved].\n\nSchumann was familiar with this Beethoven song, a fact that real Schumann enthusiasts can easily trace to his Fantasy in C major op. 17; at the end of the first movement Schumann cites a no less significant passage verbatim: “Nimm sie hin denn, diese Lieder, die ich dir, Geliebte, sang” [Accept them, these songs, that I sang for you, oh beloved.].\n\nIn my attempt to approach this special Schumann song I ensured the knowledge and art of one of the most renowned singers and song teachers of our time; I had the honour of speaking at length with Dr. h.c. mult. Edith Wiens on the topic of Schumann’s Mondnacht. Not only do Edith Wiens’ concerts and recordings convey Schumann’s voice with such incomparable inspiration and enchantment, but she is also soon to answer the calling for a teaching position at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. My conversation with this great artist lasted over an hour and for reasons of space I can only include excerpts here (mostly in German, some in English).\n\nFirst our conversation centred on Eichendorff’s text and its “transcription” into song. And that led to Schumann and why Mondnacht is such a special song.\n\nWhat, in Edith Wiens’ opinion makes a successful interpretation of Mondnacht?\n\nHardly a singer (among professionals) is not at least a tiny bit in awe of Mondnacht. Why? What are the alleged (technical) difficulties? Does one need to have reached a certain age to sing Mondnacht? And where does this song stand in technical and vocal regards within the context of the other songs of the cycle?\n\nWhich pitch of voice does Edith Wiens prefer for Mondnacht? Is it a song more for the male or female voice? Is it acceptable to transcribe the music?\n\nAfterwards Edith Wiens and I listened to numerous (older and more recent) recordings of Mondnacht by Schumann that can be found on YouTube (see the list below). I was curious to know which recordings she liked or disliked and why. She had a word of praise or a friendly comment for almost every one of the singers we listened to. For me it was a wonderful teaching session filled with highly professional criticism.\n\nOne of her favourite recordings is Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau accompanied by Günther Weissenborn, especially because of the vocalist’s performance. She found Richard Tauber’s interpretation too liberal, sounding almost improvised; and still his voice contains that famous “teardrop” that Edith Wiens finds so moving. She finds Bryn Terfel outstanding, like a “hot bath”; an opera singer who truly comprehends the song, but perhaps has some problems with the more gentle notes? Among the more recent recordings she favours Matthias Goerne accompanied by Eric Schneider. Why?\n\nOut of all the many pianists we listened to on YouTube Edith Wiens was most impressed by the accompaniment of Leonhard Hokansons (with Hermann Prey) and especially by the piano playing of Vladimir Ashkenazy accompanying Barbara Bonney, whose singing, she remarked, was “very soulful”, but all in all too one-dimensional (vibrato!). This is how Mrs Wiens explains the art of perfect piano accompaniment: the piano must be the opposite of linear; it must be played in a circular movement. That takes away the singer’s fear. Edith Wiens draws an interesting comparison to Richard Strauss’ song “Die Nacht” op. 10 Nr. 3:\n\nWhen I thanked Edith Wiens not only for her time, but for the rich conversation that was so rewarding for me because I learned so much from her, her answer was:\n\nThe following YouTube playlist, specially researched for the readers of the Schumann-Forum 2010 (with the great support of Cornelia Nöckel – thank you!) contains dozens of Mondnacht recordings. You do need some time and have to be in the right mood to listen with concentration to song after song. Perhaps you would like to mark Tuesday, 24. August 2010 in your calendar for that purpose? It marks the night of the next full moon. (How do I know? www.timeanddate.com).\n\nCaution, though: You might become moonstruck! But of course, among us Schumann and Eichendorff enthusiasts this would not be regarded any way out of the ordinary.\n\nYouTube list as download\n\nSeptember 1, 2010\n\nDid you know, dear readers, that Robert Schumann took cello lessons as a young man? And yet this favourite instrument of the romantic era is not bestowed a leading role in Schumann’s early oeuvre, with the exception of those lovely passages in the slow movements of the first and fourth symphonies, and the piano concerto. It wasn’t until very late in his life that he acknowledged the cello more intensely.\n\nToday I want to talk about the five little siblings of Schumann’s cello concerto, namely the Fünf Stücke im Volkston (Five Pieces in Folk Style) for violoncello or violin, and piano op. 102, written in 1849. They deservedly figure among the core repertoire of cellists. But today’s article will certainly arouse the curiosity of violin players as well; the version for violin that partly strays from the cello part (in some passages even the corresponding piano part differs), is in all probability authentic. Not so, however, the other versions that are performed on occasion, such as the (wonderfully enchanting) version for oboe and piano.\n\nOn time for the Schumann anniversary Henle published Urtext editions of both original versions (see below).\n\nAs a special highlight of today’s article in the Schumann Forum 2010 let me share with you an interview that I conducted with one of the leading cellists of our times, namely David Geringas, on the “Fünf Stücke im Volkston”. Geringas sees the key to these pieces in the title. In his opinion the musician must invent a story to match the piece and “tell” it through the music, like folklore.\n\nIf you don’t do that, you will bore your listeners, and this beautiful art will turn into dry and uninspiring music. “Folk style” is not meant as a loud display of virtuosity, rather it is the especially vibrant way of telling an intensely imagined narrative.\n\nFor example, the first piece, entitled “Vanitas vanitatum” (“All is vanity”, or in other words: all things earthly are transitory): Behind the music Geringas imagines someone in love with himself, who simply cannot understand why everyone is making fun of him. This person’s situation needs to be “described”; it is funny and sad at the same time. And immediately King Solomon’s well-known aphorism turns into a real story that a cello player (or violin player), together with the pianist, can “tell” and make graspable.\n\nDavid Geringas provided the fingerings and bowing marks for the Henle Urtext edition of “Fünf Stücke im Volkston”. (Ernst Schliephake provided the fingerings and bowing marks for the violin edition). For Geringas the printed fingerings are the perfect synthesis of a study of the Urtext, combined with the experience from performing concerts and from teaching (please listen in to the audio file below). Cellists whose hands are not extremely large must also be able to play Schumann’s music smoothly. (Those of you who prefer to mark the solo voice yourself will be pleased to know that Henle offers the solo string parts with and without fingerings. This service is offered for almost all string music editions at Henle.)\n\nAll are in agreement that Robert Schumann’s Fantasie op. 17 is an unsurpassed masterpiece. Many pianists even rank it among the best piano pieces of all times. It’s clear that the Fantasie in C major deserves to be given a major role in our Schumann Forum 2010, and today its time has come.\n\nIt is generally known that, on its publication in 1839, Schumann dedicated the Fantasie in C major opus 17 to no less a person than Franz Liszt: “Dedicated to Mr Franz Liszt”. In turn, Liszt dedicated his Sonata in B minor, published in 1854 to Robert Schumann: “To Robert Schumann”. I felt almost electrified when Lars Vogt, the renowned German pianist, pointed out to me that this was the same year Schumann attempted suicide and was confined to life in the Endenich asylum. Almost certainly that is merely coincidental. But Franz Liszt's words of dedication were by no means chosen incidentally (especially in tone): this is a meaningful musical greeting to the \"friend\", hopelessly wasting away in Endenich. I put the word “friend” in quotation marks, because the relationship of the two was indeed not unclouded.\n\nLars Vogt and Dr. Wolf-Dieter Seiffert\n\nThis and the no less two most significant piano works of the 19th century, were the topic of my conversation with Lars Vogt, recorded for you.\n\nIt just so happens that Lars Vogt recently recorded both Schumann’s Fantasie in C major and Franz Liszt’s Sonata in B minor in a studio. The CD with the uncannily suggestive combination of the two masterpieces will be published in a few short days.\n\nSchumann was aware that with this work he had created something outstanding and special. To his bride Clara he commented: “The first movement is probably the most passionate thing I have ever done”, only to add quite suggestively: “- a deep lament for you”. Now then, at first it does not at all sound like a lamentation, rather it resounds with great “world-embracing” joy (Lars Vogt). Moreover, Lars Vogt interprets the great beginning of the Fantasie in C major as the yearned for fulfilment of his passionate love:\n\nIt’s generally known that Schumann used a verse by Friedrich Schlegel as the motto for the Fantasie in C major; this motto is about “the quiet tone” that only he can hear “who listens secretly”.\n\nThis first movement is tremendous, in Lars Vogt’s opinion it “contains the entirety of life, everything!”\n\nThe second movement, Lars Vogt finds to be not typical of Schumann, because it is very “heroic” and terrifyingly boastful. But Lars Vogt smartly points out that, despite the powerful accords and the instruction to play “energetically”, the beginning is not in fortissimo and not in a fast tempo, but rather in mezzoforte and “mäßig” (= moderate)\n\nAnd this is where Franz Liszt becomes involved. Obviously the entire second movement is technically extremely difficult for a pianist to accomplish, and the end with the stretta following measure 232 ff (“much more moving”) is probably one of the most greatly dreaded passages of the entire piano repertoire. The demands are gargantuan and almost impossible to play: leaps between accords with both hands, melody and reverse bass line at fast speed. For a Franz Liszt, though, pianistic peanuts, so to speak. Wonderfully portrayed in “Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt” by Anton Strelezki (London 1893, p. 4 f.):\n\nHe [Schumann] asked me to proceed with the ‘March’, after which he would give me his criticism. I played the second movement, and with such effect that Schumann jumped out of his chair, flung his arms around me, and with tears in his eyes, cried: “Göttlich!”\n\nLars Vogt interprets the instructions “much more moving” at the beginning of the stretta of the second movement not so much as an indication regarding speed than as an indication of character. Of course the final passage is a conscious “overwind”, a demand “to push to the limits of what is possible and even beyond”. And still, in a performance situation the increase of inner excitation should be conveyed more strongly than a display of outward virtuosity:\n\nThe contrast between the second and the third movement in its calm, its peacefulness and the hymnal elements could not be greater. Schumann’s instructions under the title read “Slow and solemn. Consistently quiet”. No doubt: here “Eusebius” has finally asserted himself against the more lively and volatile “Florestan”.\n\nFranz Liszt, to whom the Fantasie in C major was dedicated, surprisingly never performed it in public. He regarded it as too difficult for a large audience to understand. Maybe because of the third movement. Sviatoslav Richter’s seems to support this notion (see above) in speaking of the “incredibly deep” third movement that virtually inhibits him. The third and last movement of Opus 17 compounds the inner turmoil of the human soul in the sense of a conciliatory synthesis and metaphysical glorification. So clearly comparable to the inner structure of Liszt’s Sonata in B minor that also, and much more explicitly than Schumann, strongly confronts the demonic and the divine (all created out of one single musical idea!) and finally fades out in trifold pianissimo. Liszt was aware of the emotional anxieties that can torture highly sensitive natures, and in dedicating his most important piano composition – that he likewise never performed in public – to Schumann, at the time already without voice, in the insane asylum in Endenich, he meant to communicate just that. Lars Vogt spoke enthusiastically and with profound knowledge and in great detail about Liszt’s Sonata in B minor. He summarizes the ideas in the following words:\n\nThoughts on the ending of Schumann's Fantasy op. 17\n\nWhat you see here is the last page of the Fantasie in C major op. 17 in the autograph version of Schumann’s copyist Carl Brückner from Leipzig. Why, dear readers of the Schumann Forum 2010, would I choose to show you exactly this last page? Because it is proof of the ending originally intended by Schumann for the Fantasie in C major. You will see if you are familiar with the Fantasie in C major, Schumann originally drew back on the wonderful ending of the first movement of the Fantasie to conclude the entire piece.\n\nAnd that is, as we know, that touching passage in which Schumann waves to his bride Clara with the Beethoven-citation: “Accept them, these songs” (from Beethoven song cycle opus 98 “An die ferne Geliebte [= Clara]”“).\n\nBut Schumann distinctly crossed out this passage and replaced it with the closing measures as we know them today. And that is the way they appear in the first edition that was proofread and authorized by Schumann himself. Had the handwritten manuscript for the first edition not survived, we would know nothing of this preliminary stage. But now we musicologists and musicians are left to speculate whether Schumann didn’t in the end weaken the originally “better” ending. Indeed, some very serious musicians do think that way.\n\nFor instance, the great musicologist and pianist Charles Rosen published a DVD with the Fantasie in C major with the original ending, the DVD also contains his comments. Next year András Schiff will release a double CD (ECM) with recordings of both versions (by the way there is a recording of a live concert of his on YouTube that you can listen to and watch to find out which version he prefers). Alan Walker, the great Liszt researcher, devoted an essay to this subject and sets the Budapest autograph in an exciting biographical context (Schumann, Liszt and the C Major Fantasie, Op. 17: A Declining Relationship, in: Music and Letters [1979], S. 156-165).\n\nIn 1987 the Fantasie in C major was revised by Henle, because we were allowed access to the Budapest autograph. The original ending appeared in a footnote in all of the Henle Urtext editions printed between 1987 and 2003. We ceased use of the footnote in the new critically revised edition published in 2003; the original ending is mentioned in the critical commentary. And of course, since then we’ve received the occasional letter from a piano player asking why we abandoned the footnote; many do find the original ending quite interesting, if not even better.\n\nExclusively for the readers of this forum I would like to present here, and here only, once more the page from the out-of-print Henle edition with the original version of the ending of the Fantasie in C major.\n\nDownload the page for free !\n\nYou will want to know why we decided not to include this addition in the current Urtext edition. Well, the answer has a lot to do with the responsibility that we carry as editors and publisher. As already stated, Schumann’s will is clear. He does not wish the original version to be played. In his opinion it is obsolete. He clearly crossed it out and replaced it. His proofreading of the first edition was very careful and meticulous. And final dictum is final. We have to respect that. As much as it is, from a scholarly point of view, highly interesting to see how the Fantasie in C major reached its final form, so little does that have to do with true Urtext. It is not our aim to show musicians the early versions of different parts of drafts; rather we aim to present the correct music as ultimately authorized by the composer. And so, in the former Henle editions, we made a mistake in printing the version that Schumann himself had purposely discarded (it looks almost like an “ossia”, even if it is not declared as such; see above pdf).\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nDear Readers,\n\nThere is a concert that ranks among my personal richest experiences of the last several years. It was a Schumann matinee given by pianist András Schiff in the excellent and lovely “Reitstadl” in Neumarkt, Bavaria in January 2009. The concert was recorded and will be published on CD by ECM (planned for the beginning of 2011). It was my honour and my pleasure to talk to this exceptional musician about Schumann, and I did this exclusively for you, dear readers of the Schumann Forum.\n\nThe central issue of our conversation was the question whether there is an unmistakable “Schumann sound” and whether it is at all possible to grasp and describe it. You can listen to excerpts of the conversation here. It was conducted in German. Those among you who do not speak German will be happy to read the summary that I wrote up in German and which has also been translated into English.\n\nAbstract (pdf)\n\nMaestro Schiff confirmed the key question whether a specific “Schumann sound” exists:\n\nIn an attempt to describe the Schumann sound with words András Schiff then talked about Schumann’s piano settings which he regards as revolutionary and genial.\n\nSir András Schiff\n\nHe points out as an essential aspect the unusual textures of the middle parts:\n\nSchiff proceeded with insightful comments on Schumann’s efforts to often disguise the metric pulse; he tends to conceal the first downbeat of the bar which is so peculiar to his compositions:\n\nSchiff revealed another unfailing characteristic of the Schumann sound - his pedal instructions in the piano works:\n\nOne observation that we have all made is evident for instance in Schumann’s “Kreisleriana” op. 16: the piece ends very, very quietly in a triple pianissimo. Kapellmeister Kreisler has disappeared from the scene and the audience is a bit at a loss. Has the piece ended? Was this the cue for applause? András Schiff emphasizes this particularity. It is so typical of many of Schumann’s piano works that they simply will not end thunderously with great effect on the audience:\n\nNot at all surprisingly András Schiff regards Schumann’s unconventional tempo instructions, the poetical mottoes of many works, the intellectual and literary background of Schumann’s entire oeuvre as extraordinarily important and inspiring. Schumann is tremendously helpful to the pianist in revealing his intentions in written words that can be read and followed:\n\nFinally, we came to speak on Schumann’s late works which András Schiff very much reveres, but other pianists avoid like a curse. Why so?\n\nAt the end of our conversation Maestro Schiff returned to the special value of the first versions of Schumann’s piano works that he feels are in some cases better, and even more inspired, than the later versions that Schumann approved. Mr Schiff attributes this continuous desire to improve finished works to Schumann’s emotional instability and his lifelong insecurities.\n\nOne of the truly great Schumann pianists (and conductors) of our time is Christian Zacharias. When I first started the Schumann Forum 2010 in January I already fostered the desire to have the opportunity to question him on Schumann and to publish his answers online for you. In the summer, in between his rehearsal times for the “Schubertiade” in Schwarzenberg (Austria) I actually got my chance. We sat together at the edge of a lovely green meadow, the birds in the trees were giving a natural symphony (their song is heard in the background on the recording of the interview) and Maestro Zacharias was in the best of moods for a chat.\n\nChristian Zacharias and Dr. Wolf-Dieter Seiffert\n\nI am especially honoured to post the interview with Christian Zacharias on the Schumann Forum, because it gives the G. Henle Verlag the added opportunity to officially congratulate Maestro Zacharias on his 60th birthday which he celebrated in the spring of this year. To what great extent Christian Zacharias centres his interest on the music of Robert Schumann is not only made evident through his countless Schumann concerts and numerous Schumann recordings, but also through his contribution to the 1989 French-language film production “Robert Schumann – Le poète parle”.\n\nMy questions to Christian Zacharias were more or less the same ones that determined my rich discussion with András Schiff (ref. preceding entry from 1. October). The essence of our talk was to define what makes Schumann’s (piano) music so unique and original, to pinpoint what makes his music so unmistakeably “Schmannesque”. Maestro Zacharias’ thoughts are equally as insightful as András Schiff’s and reflect an unbelievably thorough and deep knowledge of Schumann’s oeuvre. Perhaps he voices more criticism than András Schiff (for example his opinion of “Papillons” op. 2 is that they are not consistently perfect, whereas Schiff notably regards them as Schumann’s key work), but after an hour of talk about Schumann it was clear to me that I was conversing with a true Schumann enthusiast like no other; Zacharias is from the core of his being devoted to Schumann.\n\nDear readers, the interview is posted here exclusively for you. I summarized an abstract of the conversation in writing (in German and English) and have put together the key moments of our talk.\n\nAbstract (pdf)\n\nBefore I had even unpacked my notes and questions on Schumann Maestro Zacharias himself immediately remarked on Schumann’s metronome markings and the value of finding them reliably researched and printed in the Urtext editions, and his conviction that they need to be taken seriously and heeded by all musicians. He especially praised my article on the metronome markings that was posted on the Schumann Forum 2010 in July (Levels of Difficulty) (the article also contains a practical list all of Schumann’s authentic metronome markings). Because Henle recently published an Urtext edition of Schumann’s Piano Concerto (see \"The Piano Concerto\") Maestro Zacharias was prompted to comment on this piece first, especially because this masterpiece is misunderstood or rather misinterpreted by many pianists in regards to tempo and measure. Listen here to what Christian Zacharias says (and sings) about his early approaches, many years ago, to follow the correct metronome instructions against all - distorting - tradition.\n\nBy the way, the booklet by Bruno Walter that Maestro Zacharias mentions at this point is “Von der Musik und vom Musizieren” and was published by S. Fischer. It is out of print now, but is available through several antique book sellers, and much worth reading.\n\nWe quickly reached the essential question, namely what is so incredibly unique about Schumann’s piano texture, and why his music is at times confronted with the complaint of being unwieldy. Zacharias spontaneous answer is astounding and he not only refers to Chopin and Liszt, but also (as a conductor) draws a comparison to the way Schumann structures his orchestral works.\n\nIn the following course of this rich conversation Maestro Zacharias proved to be a truly profound connoisseur of Schumann’s entire oeuvre. He drew parallels throughout many genres and biographical stations in Schumann’s life, referred to individual passages in Schumann’s works and highlighted them – I was hardly able to follow. Again and again it was evident that he does not at all attribute the rank of a masterpiece to everything that Schumann wrote. Especially the late works he is inclined to view critically (quite in opposition to András Schiff).\n\nI personally find that the pedal instructions in Schumann’s piano works are an especially ingenious dynamic element that far too few pianists pay enough attention to (\"The Prophet Bird\"). I commented to that effect and added what a pity it is that many pieces don’t have detailed pedal marks and only contain general instructions to use the pedal - only to be immediately interrupted by the Maestro:\n\nAnd because Christian Zacharias especially uses the “Papillons” op. 2 as an example, I would like to provide the link to the new Henle edition for further reference. If you have the copy you will be able to study in “Urtext” the last passage of this work which is possibly unique in the history of music, indeed.\n\nAt this point of reading and listening you will want to experience Zacharias and Schumann together. I can only encourage you to go to a live concert. If you don’t have that opportunity then at least I can point you to some recordings; I personally think that Zacharias’ recording of the Piano Concerto is among the best ever (see also my above article \"The Piano Concerto\"). And I would like to recommend the Piano Box released by EMI for the anniversary. It contains a wonderful collection of recordings of the greatest Schumann pianists.\n\nFrom the set you will now be especially interested in Christian Zacharias’ interpretation of “Papillons” op. 2, “Davidsbündler-Tänze” op. 6 and “Kinderszenen” op. 15.\n\nFor more immediate enjoyment I would like to lead you to a live recording of the “Fantasiestücke” op. 12 on YouTube. Admittedly it is already 20 years old (recorded in 1990 at a festival in France), but who would not admire and be enraptured by the unfaltering, exquisitely poised and masterly touch of Christian Zacharias.\n\nPart 1: op. 12 No. 1 “Des Abends” and No. 2 “Aufschwung”\n\nPart 2: op. 12 No. 3 “Warum? ” and No. 4 “Grillen”\n\nPart 3: op. 12 Nr. 5 „In der Nacht“ and Nr. 6 „Fabel“\n\nPart 4: op. 12 Nr. 7 „Traumes Wirren“ and Nr. 8 „Ende vom Lied“\n\nNovember 14, 2010\n\nDear readers,\n\nColored leaves everywhere, on the trees and on the ground. I can see them outside my window, on Forstenrieder Allee in Munich, where the G. Henle offices are. Colored leaves everywhere – that's the keyword for today's entry on the Schumann Forum: Schumann's seldom played \"Bunte Blätter\" opus 99.\n\nRobert Schumann, Bunte Blätter op. 99,\n\nFirst Edition, Robert-Schumann-Haus Zwickau;\n\nArchiv-Nr.: 1996.23-D1;\n\nthe download of this image is prohibited\n\nI am especially taken by O N E of the \"leaves\" out of opus 99. It's the fourth one, in f-sharp minor (\"fairly slow\"). And I want to take a close look at it with you. Its simplicity and touching melancholy make it especially attractive to me. And others share my sentiments; Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms felt likewise. Both wrote lengthy variations on exactly this piece:\n\nClara Wieck-Schumann, [Seven] Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann, dedicated to him, op. 20 [1853]: Urtext edition by G. Henle Verlag HN 393, pp. 62–73\n\n» more information on that edition\n\nAn additional page reference for \"insiders\" be mentioned here: an album exists on this theme with a handwritten note in Clara Schumann's pen \"for Miss Julie Schmittermeyer in commemoration\", January 1856 (Vienna) (Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt am Main, Signatur: Hs 2355).\n\nJohannes Brahms, [Sixteen] Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann, op. 9 [1854]: Urtext edition by G. Henle Verlag HN 438 (Single edition)\n\n» more information on that edition\n\nor HN 440 (Brahms, Variations for Piano), S. 1–22\n\n» more information on that edition\n\nBoth cycles of variations, by the way, were published at the same time, in November 1854. At a time when Robert Schumann had already spent eight months as a patient in the private hospital of Dr. Richarz in Endenich.\n\nThe piece in f-sharp minor (entitled \"Album Leaf\") is only a short page of music, and not all that difficult to play (on the Henle scale of levels of difficulty ranging from 1–9, it ranks on level \"4\", making it the easiest piece out of opus 99):\n\n» Levels of difficulty of \"Bunte Blätter op. 99\"\n\nOn first glance you might feel inclined to think the piece is a chorale, the melody of the soprano voice is church-like, carried, almost monotonous, and suspended in the style of a four-part hymn. I am convinced that similar songs could be discovered in a Christian songbook. But it is not a hymn, it was newly created by Schumann \"in the traditional style\".\n\nRobert Schumann: Bunte Blätter op. 99,4\n\nWhat also underscores the similarity to a chorale is the symmetry of the four measures in a very simple sequence:\n\nA – B – A: | 4+4 |: 4+4 + 4+4 :|\n\nThe chorale idiom in combination with the very simple formal structure appears \"antiquated\" to us, like a citation from an earlier, long ago time. And that is seemingly not enough, in the first \"album leaf\" Schumann makes use of the gesture of the (baroque) gavotte. This usually hasty dance, here frozen as in slow motion, is characterized by the metrics short-short-long. I would say \"Der Dichter spricht\" (the last piece of the \"Kinderszenen\" op. 15) is related to our album leaf in this respect. Don't you think so, too?\n\nPerhaps the gavotte \"idiom\" was the main thing that prompted Clara Schumann, and especially Johannes Brahms to use exactly this album leaf as an inspiration for variations; already during Bach's time gavottes were popular templates for variations, and in addition we know that Brahms very much favored variations of old music forms.\n\nI mentioned above that the album leaf in f sharp minor appeals to me especially in its melancholy. I am moved to believe that it is exactly Schumann's reference to the old themes of the gavotte and chorale that make me feel this way. But the decisive element, what is really so intriguing about this piece, is the way it combines the old with the completely novel. And what is novel is the harmony. What Schumann does is to consistently repeat the melody of part A, almost like a formula, and combine it with ever-changing chords in the underlying (harmonic) structure. The effect is astonishing, because it proceeds to vary the illumination of the simple melody to create ever changing \"colors\": In the first four-measure unit we remain in f sharp minor, the next four measures take us from f sharp minor to A major, and the following four-measure unit (= mm. 17-20) leads us from the diminished seventh chord a#, followed by a cadence in A major, only to finally return to the f sharp minor of the first four measure unit. And above that, all the while the same four measure melody continues. Astonishing, isn't it?\n\nAnd then there are the seventh and ninth chords, always on the stressed measures 2, 6, 18 and 22. Try it out on your piano; play the first four measures and pay special attention to the effect of measure two, first beat. You will suddenly feel the pleasantly sharp dissonance of the chord in the pacing symmetry of the gavotte. You must allow yourself the enjoyment of this harmonic spice, so to say – and you will see how the little piece develops depth and greatness. For, it is exactly this chord that is the repeated little climax in the inner development of the movement: for this short instant motion halts on the dotted c#2 – in the base voice we make out a d (major seventh) or a b (major ninth) – the sharpest of disharmonies, actually. It makes you hold your breath. The \"false\" bass deeply enriches the traditional four-part chorale passage. All the other voices in the chord progress properly and meet our logical musical expectations. This is how, in these passages, Schumann creates four-part chords, inconceivable in the baroque or classic period, because it simply wouldn't go. I find it is these four-part chords (triads with major sevenths or major ninths) that really determine the dynamics of the piece. They actually become independent; they have their own sound value, and on top of that always positioned in the metrically stressed centre of the sequence of measures. And in my opinion these seventh or ninth chords are what, along with the \"antiquated\" framework of the choralesque gavotte, create the melancholy mood. They gently color the \"pure\" triad by impressively integrating a fourth, actually disruptive, note. Even if you, dear readers, should not agree with me that the mood is melancholy, then surely, though, you will agree that the coloration of the triad in f sharp minor with the added bass d or b is about \"colored leaves\" in a related sense, namely in the sense of being \"chromatic\" and thus having to do with color. Incidentally, if you were to analyze this dissonant chord with the usual tools of harmonics, you would most certainly be confronted with terms like \"false conclusion\" or \"mediant\", suspended note or VI. degree. All of which undoubtedly applies, but has nothing in the least to do with the true effect (!) of our piece. Don't you agree?\n\nTo conclude, the diminished chord in measure 17 that is dissolved in the colored f sharp minor chord in measure 18 deserves to be mentioned. This diminished chord (m. 17) is the only one in the entire piece that Schumann explicitly marks with a sustaining pedal sign. And not only in order to integrate the grace-note a# into the chord sound of the left hand (the chord could not be grasped without the pedal), but also to create an audible contrast for the spherically diminished sound with the help of the pedal. Because, if you do not listen very closely, you will not notice that this is exactly where the repetition of part A sets in. The diminished chord again covers up and adds color to the rather simple melody.\n\nThese colorations are what make the little album leaf from opus 99 so appealing. And it fits in so beautifully with the slightly melancholy autumn mood that we should abandon ourselves to with Schumann, when we now listen to the piece. It is played by Mikhail Pletnev, a grandiose Schumann pianist, whose style I find exciting and inspiring (\"exciting\" in two meanings of the word: he fills each note with vivacity and depth, but often plays rather willfully, almost stubbornly, especially in his emphasis of polyphone voice leadings). Be it as it is, he plays our album leaf beautifully and exactly as it should be played. One is almost moved to bow in gratitude.\n\nDecember 1, 2010\n\nRobert Schumann died on July 29, 1856 at the age of 46; even in his time this was an early death. And so, to apply the term \"late works\" to the compositions from the last years of his life, approximately from 1850 on, seems justifiable only in relation to his (short) life. But on the other hand, these \"late\" works might be different in a special way, they might contain a structure that we would be moved to call characteristic of Schumann's mature style. And, what role does Schumann's mental illness play? The compositions from Schumann's last years are certainly not (and in distinct contrast to his \"early works\") what we would today regard as box office successes.\n\nGranted, these ideas are not at all novel. They have been discussed by musicologists at least from the 1980s on. Lately many musicians have been strongly promoting Schumann's \"late works\", and it seems that now, at the end of 2010, it might not be too bold to state that for the larger part these Schumann compositions have been restored to good repute, if not yet well and far enough known.\n\nIn our \"Schumann Forum\" as well numerous musicians were heard on this topic. Devoted readers of the Forum will remember (and the others are welcome to refer to back entries) that in this regard the opinions strongly differed. The scope reaches from Gerhard Oppitz' remark \"ingenious, visionary, enigmatic\" (9 Questions for Gerhard Oppitz) to Christian Zacharias: \"I find Schumann's late works for the piano disturbing\" (9 Questions for Christian Zacharias).\n\nAn entry of Clara Schumann in reference to the copying expenses for the E flat major variations in Schumann's housekeeping log (April 1855) proved to me that Schumann's autograph had been professionally copied (how helpful it is to have this record). Perhaps this copy had been sent to Schumann at Endenich, or had even been delivered by Brahms? I started to search and was soon rewarded in the world's most eminent Brahms libraries. The archives of the \"Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien\" do actually own this copy and a thorough reading of the up to then unknown source soon revealed that it contained handwritten corrections (presumably also) by Schumann. In some cases it is helpful in deciphering Schumann's sometimes illegible hand, and it was evident that the copy in Vienna had been used as the manuscript for Geiringer's first edition. (In some cases he had made changes.)\n\nAfter painstaking work comparing the versions I succeeded in creating a correct copy of the music of the \"Ghost Variations\" for the very first time. Since then an Urtext exists. The abundance of information that had been collected went beyond the mould of what is usually included in the commentary of a G. Henle Urtext edition. So I wrote an article in which I included references to all the information available on the history of the \"Ghost Variations\", the sources, the text documents and the process of its creation. To those of you who are especially interested in the details and are avid readers of the Schumann Forum 2010 I am happy to offer the complete article for download here.\n\n» download the article in german (PDF, 9 MB)\n\nWolf-Dieter Seiffert: Robert Schumanns Thema mit Variationen Es-Dur, genannt \"Geistervariationen\", in: Compositionswissenschaft.

Instead of one of the (usual) YouTube-Links I would like to end today with an excerpt from the closing chapter of Peter Härtling's book \"Schumanns Schatten\" (Munich [dtv] 92010, p. 383 f.; English translation by Kristina Winter):\n\nAll the others stepped aside. Schumann recognized her at once. And he had really already moved on to another world. He lifted his arms, let them go down again, and lifted them again, and sat up in his bed. She knelt next to him. Her dress rustled. Again he lifted his arms, very slowly, against a heavy weight, and embraced her. They held the embrace for a long time. This is true. The others held their breaths. And I ceased watching.\n\nRobert and Clara Schumann"
