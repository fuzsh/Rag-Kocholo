        "text": "#READALLABOUTIT This paper written with a PhD student, Chante Johannes and other supervisors. This paper interrogated the #relationship #between #psychosocial #factors and #physical #activity #participation among #undergraduate #university students at a #HDI in #South #Africa. The most stand-out finding for me was how #physical #activity was #significantly #associated with #mental #health, such as #depression, #anxiety and #stress. I got a sense that these are messages we have been broadcasting, and not really taking stock of where they have been landing. This research therefore advocates that future research on mental health should consider #physical #activity #interventions as a #strategy for #coping with #mental #health #challenges amongst #undergraduate #students. #undergraduate #mentalhealth #physicalactivity\n\nIt was great to be interviewed about our current collaboration within the EU-funded TACT: Targeted Anti-Cancer Therapies consortium. Thanks to a focused collaboration with Chris Scott, Vijay Chudasama, and Sarah Cianferani, our own PhD-student Irene Shajan -with the help of LÃ©a Rochet, Bianka Gabriela Jackowska, Rania Benazza, Oscar Hernandez Alba, and Floris van Delft- developed a platform that allows the conversion of monoclonal antibodies into very potent bispecific constructs. And with very potent I mean displaying IC50 values in the low picomolar range! Better still, they're not toxic!! The activity is directly connected to the covalent linkage between the units, the separated components don't do anything. Great to share this outcome. Here is a link to the paper: https://lnkd.in/e-bWBApD If you're interested, keep your eyes open for another paper that will be submitted later this year. Also, we will have positions available soon to extend this research further.\n\nCalling all docs interested in Sjogren's. Register for the SjÃ¶grenâ€™s Foundation \"State of Sjogren's\" in JAN (click the @talkmedspoke link below or image, then its link to the link under my pic). https://lnkd.in/euBAjxxV Learn the most up to date information on @SjogrensOrg Top Sjogren's experts will give very practical info you can take back to the clinic CME accredited Consider going into much-needed research on Sjogren's (it is a wide-open niche, young docs!) Topic examples: Diagnosis: The Many Faces of SjÃ¶grenâ€™s by Thomas Grader-Beck MD, PhD; Johns Hopkins The Difficult-to-Diagnose Patient by Astrid Rasmussen, PhD; Astrid Rasmussen OMRF\n\nIt was a great honor for my abstract titled \"MARRVEL and ModelMatcher: publicly available web services that facilitate collaborative research on rare diseases\" to be selected for an oral presentation at the #TAGC24, a large model organism genetics conference hosted by the Genetics Society of America, thanks to the organizers and session chairs. #MARRVEL (https://marrvel.org/), a one-stop shop to collect valuable human and model organism data for #raredisease (#rarediseases) and #undiagnosed disease research, was developed out of necessity in the #UDN Model Organisms Screening Center in collabortion with Dr. Zhandong Liu at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Instead of going to >30 individual web sites scattered across the internet, people can visit one place to collect information that is useful to design experiments to solve medical mysteries. In parallel, we have been developing #ModelMatcher (https://lnkd.in/gWV-ra3m), a matchmaking platform to connect basic scientists to other stakeholders of rare and undiagnosed research including clinicians, patients, patient organizations, funding agencies and biotech/pharma with Dr. Liu's team and #RDMM (Rare Diseases Models & Mechanisms) network bioinformatics team in Canada led by Drs. Phil Hieter and Paul Pavlidis. More than 200 scientists registered in ModelMatcher over the past two days at our #TGCA24 Booth (number 514), and will be reaching out to more people over the remaining next two days of this successful conference. Special shoutout to #UDN Data Management and Coordination Center (DMCC) and #CZI Rare As One program for sponsoring this booth!"
