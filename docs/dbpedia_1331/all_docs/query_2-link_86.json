        "meta_description": "Individual differences in delay discounting—how much we discount future compared to immediate rewards—are associated with general life outcomes, psychopathology, and obesity. Here, we use machine learning on fMRI activity during an intertemporal choice task to develop a functional brain marker of these individual differences in human adults. Training and cross-validating the marker in one dataset (Study 1, N  = 110 male adults) resulted in a significant prediction–outcome correlation ( r  = 0.49), generalized to predict individual differences in a completely independent dataset (Study 2: N  = 145 male and female adults, r  = 0.45), and predicted discounting several weeks later. Out-of-sample responses of the functional brain marker, but not discounting behavior itself, differed significantly between overweight and lean individuals in both studies, and predicted fasting-state blood levels of insulin, c-peptide, and leptin in Study 1. Significant predictive weights of the marker were found in cingulate, insula, and frontoparietal areas, among others, suggesting an interplay among regions associated with valuation, conflict processing, and cognitive control. This new functional brain marker is a step toward a generalizable brain model of individual differences in delay discounting. Future studies can evaluate it as a potential transdiagnostic marker of altered decision-making in different clinical and developmental populations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT People differ substantially in how much they prefer smaller sooner rewards or larger later rewards such as spending money now versus saving it for retirement. These individual differences are generally stable over time and have been related to differences in mental and bodily health. What is their neurobiological basis? We applied machine learning to brain-imaging data to identify a novel brain activity pattern that accurately predicts how much people prefer sooner versus later rewards, and which can be used as a new brain-based measure of intertemporal decision-making in future studies. The resulting functional brain marker also predicts overweight and metabolism-related blood markers, providing new insight into the possible links between metabolism and the cognitive and brain processes involved in intertemporal decision-making.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nMany decisions in life have consequences at different points in time. For example, most people need to decide whether to put part of their paycheck toward a retirement fund or spend it on something fun, like a short vacation. These trade-offs between options that are immediately rewarding and those that will be more rewarding in the long run are hard, and people differ substantially in delay discounting—the degree to which they discount future compared with immediate rewards (Kirby and Herrnstein, 1995). Greater delay discounting (i.e., greater impatience or higher preference for sooner rewards) is associated with obesity, addiction, and many psychiatric conditions (Bickel et al., 1999; MacKillop et al., 2011; Mole et al., 2015; Amlung et al., 2016). It has therefore been proposed as a potential transdiagnostic marker of psychopathology (Amlung et al., 2019; Lempert et al., 2019) and as a risk factor for short-sighted behaviors such as unhealthy diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol and drug use (Audrain-McGovern et al., 2009; Fernie et al., 2013). The goal of the present study is to identify and validate an fMRI-based brain marker of individual differences in delay discounting.\n\nPrevious findings regarding the structural and functional brain bases of individual differences in delay discounting offer a mixed picture. Several studies suggest a role for areas involved in reward processing and valuation (Bartra et al., 2013; Cooper et al., 2013), and for areas central to cognitive control (Hare et al., 2014). Brain areas associated with memory and prospection have also been found to contribute to individual differences in delay discounting (Benoit et al., 2011; Peters and Büchel, 2011; Lebreton et al., 2013). Studies using structural and functional connectivity measures suggested a role for frontal–striatal and striatal–subcortical connections (van den Bos et al., 2014). The structure of midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and the ventral striatum has been associated with self-reported trait impulsivity (MacNiven et al., 2020).\n\nIndividual differences in delay discounting may also emerge from the combined activity across multiple brain regions or functional networks. However, only a few studies (Berman et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Pehlivanova et al., 2018) have investigated the distributed patterns associated with individual differences in delay discounting. Further, most previous studies used relatively small sample sizes to explore these individual differences, increasing the risk of both false-positive and false-negative results (Poldrack et al., 2017). Given the use of standard correlation or regression analyses that are typically not cross-validated on independent data samples, previous results are difficult to compare with each other and do not provide any formal model that could predict delay discounting in completely independent studies.\n\nHere, we address these limitations by using a machine learning-based “brain model” approach (Woo et al., 2017; Kragel et al., 2018). Brain models are trained to predict a mental process or individual variable (here, delay discounting) and can be applied to independent data (Kragel et al., 2018; Scheinost et al., 2019). As such, brain models go beyond reporting peak coordinates by identifying specific large-scale patterns of brain activity that can be replicated, validated, or falsified in a quantifiable way. This approach has been successfully applied to brain-based prediction of pain (Wager et al., 2013), working memory (Rosenberg et al., 2020), and affective states (Yu et al., 2020), among others. The importance of independent validation and model generalizability has also been recognized for brain-based prediction of trait-like individual differences (Gabrieli et al., 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2018; Rosenberg and Finn, 2022).\n\nHere, we build on this approach to predict individual differences in delay discounting. If there is a consistent activity pattern associated with individual differences in delay discounting during intertemporal choices, then this pattern should be able to predict delay discounting in new data (hold-out subjects) and even completely independent datasets. Comparing the resulting pattern to meta-analysis-based masks allows us to assess the contribution of brain areas associated with valuation, cognitive control, and prospection.\n\nResults\n\nIndividual differences in delay discounting\n\nIn Study 1 (Bonn University; N = 110), participants chose the SS option in an average of 43.7% of all trials (median, 48.1%) and had a fitted mean log(k) parameter of −5.70 [median log(k), −5.28 (corresponding to a k value of 0.0051)]. Choice behavior was characterized by substantial individual differences, with the percentage of SS choices ranging from 5.6% to 88.8%, and log(k) values ranging from −9.90 to −1.36 (Fig. 1c). Individual differences were very stable over a 7 week period (see Materials and Methods), with a test–retest reliability [correlation between baseline log(k) values and second session) of r = 0.86 [p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.80, 0.90; Fig. 1c].\n\nOn average, participants in Study 2 chose the SS option in 57.4% of trials (median, 60.0%) and had a fitted log(k) value of −4.08 [median log(k), −3.95; corresponding to a k of 0.0193). Again, individuals varied substantially in their intertemporal preferences, with the percentage of SS ranging from 0.8% to 99.2%, and log(k) ranging from −7.08 to −2.12 (Fig. 1c). As in Study 1, these individual differences were stable over time, with a test–retest reliability between baseline and postintervention (10 weeks later) measures of log(k) of r = 0.74 (Pearson correlation, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.63, 0.82; Fig. 1c). Thus, our data confirm both the substantial variability in delay discounting known from previous work (Kable and Glimcher, 2007; Pehlivanova et al., 2018) and the stability of these individual differences over time (Kirby, 2009; Anokhin et al., 2015; Lempert and Phelps, 2016), allowing us to investigate the neurofunctional bases of these individual differences.\n\nSignificant cross-validated prediction of delay discounting based on fMRI\n\nTraining (using LASSO-PCR) and cross-validating (10-fold) the predictive marker (termed k-marker; Fig. 2a) in Study 1 resulted in a cross-validated prediction–outcome correlation [i.e., correlation between predicted and actual log(k)] of r = 0.49 (permutation test, p < 0.001), a mean squared error of 2.84 (permutation test, p < 0.001), and a mean absolute error for predicted log(k) of 1.32 (permutation test, p < 0.001; Fig. 2b,c, additional results and random cross-validation folds). The explained variance of the prediction compared with a hypothetical mean model (prediction R2) was R2 = 0.23. Individual differences in head motion (mean absolute framewise displacement) were related to neither log(k) (Pearson correlation: r = −0.05, p = 0.58) nor predicted log(k) (Pearson correlation: r = 0.01, p = 0.92). Statistically controlling for age, education, head motion, and total brain volume (using partial correlations) did not substantially change the relationships between actual log(k) and predicted log(k) (partial correlation: r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Out-of-sample k-marker responses also predicted the percentage of SS choices (Pearson correlation: r = 0.50, p < 0.001) and log(k) calculated based on the method of Study 2 (Pearson correlation: r = 0.45, p < 0.001).\n\nFigure 2-1\n\nSignificant positive and negative weights contributing to the k-marker during Choice screen onset (FDR-corrected q < 0.05 across the whole feature space; i.e., three concatenated gray matter-masked whole-brain maps, and at least three contingent voxels). In the column “Atlas label,” cortical regions (Ctx) are labeled based on the multimodal cortical parcellation by Glasser et al. (2016), basal ganglia regions based on Pauli et al. (2016), cerebellar regions based on Diedrichsen et al. (2009), and brainstem regions based on a combination of studies (Shen et al., 2013; Bär et al., 2016).

Download Figure 2-3, DOCX file.\n\nValidation of the k-marker in an independent test dataset (Study 2)\n\nBrain markers of individual differences become more meaningful if they can be validated in different and completely independent data (Kragel et al., 2018). The validity of the marker should not depend on study-specific parameters such as the type of scanner used for data acquisition, preprocessing software, or other aspects of the data (Woo et al., 2017; Kragel et al., 2018; Scheinost et al., 2019).\n\nWe therefore tested whether the k-marker—developed and cross-validated entirely in Study 1—could predict discounting in a completely independent dataset. The validation dataset (Study 2) was acquired on a different scanner, in a different laboratory and country, and using a different participant sample and different task characteristics, and was preprocessed and analyzed using different MRI analysis software. Evaluating the performance of the k-marker in Study 2 is therefore an even stronger test than cross-validation in Study 1 alone.\n\nFor this purpose, we computed the pattern expression of the k-marker using the matrix dot product for each participant’s data (contrast images for Choice, parametric modulation for LL Amount, and Delay) in Study 2. The resulting predicted log(k) values were significantly correlated with actual log(k) values (Fig. 2c; Pearson correlation: r = 0.45, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.57; mean absolute error, 1.68) demonstrating the replicability of the k-marker in a completely independent dataset. For the transfer test to Study 2, the predicted R2 was −3.2, indicating that, while the k-marker was very accurate in identifying the rankings among individuals, the absolute prediction values were less accurate than a hypothetical mean model.\n\nThe training and cross-validation dataset (Study 1) consisted of male participants only, which might limit the validity of the k-marker in females. We therefore assessed the accuracy of the k-marker in Study 2 separately in male and female participants (Fig. 2c). In male participants (N = 88), the prediction–outcome correlation was r = 0.40 (Pearson correlation, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.21, 0.56). In females (N = 57), the prediction–outcome correlation was r = 0.55 (Pearson correlation, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.71) and thus comparable, if not superior, to the predictive accuracy in males. This demonstrates that the k-marker (despite being trained on male participants’ data only) predicts delay discounting well for both male and female participants. As in Study 1, individual differences in head motion in Study 2 were related neither to log(k) (Pearson correlation: r = 0.12, p = 0.14) nor predicted log(k) (Pearson correlation: r = 0.04, p = 0.59). Statistically controlling for age, sex, education, head motion, and total brain volume did not change the relationship between predicted and actual log(k) (Partial correlation: r = 0.44, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.30, 0.56).\n\nBrain-based prediction of future discounting\n\nWe next assessed whether responses of the k-marker were predictive of individual differences in delay discounting as measured several weeks later. Responses of the k-marker at baseline significantly predicted (out-of-sample) discounting behavior 7 weeks later in Study 1 (Pearson correlation: r = 0.38, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.53) and 10 weeks later in Study 2 (Pearson correlation: r = 0.36, p = 0.002; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.51; Fig. 2d). This shows that variability in k-marker responses is driven largely by stable individual differences and their underlying neurophysiological processes.\n\nResponse of the k-marker differs between lean and overweight participants\n\nGiven previous findings of higher delay discounting in overweight and obese people (Jarmolowicz et al., 2014; Amlung et al., 2016), we next tested whether individual differences in k-marker response were associated with individual differences in body mass and overweight (as measured by BMI > 25). In contrast to previous reports (MacKillop et al., 2011; Amlung et al., 2016) that have studied this relationship more systematically, actual log(k) was not significantly correlated with BMI in either of the two samples (Pearson correlations: Study 1: r = 0.07, p = 0.48; 95% CI = −0.12, 0.25; Study 2: r = −0.04, p = 0.69; 95% CI = −0.20, 0.12). However, in Study 1, response of the k-marker significantly correlated with both BMI (Pearson correlation: r = 0.26, p = 0.005; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.43; Fig. 3a) and percentage of body fat (Pearson correlation: r = 0.28, p = 0.004; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.45). The k-marker response in Study 1 also differed between lean participants (BMI ≤ 25) and overweight-to-obese participants (BMI > 25; two-sample t test: t(108) = 2.85, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.12, 0.69; Fig. 3b). Further, the k-marker response in Study 1 significantly predicted metabolic blood markers that are associated with some of the negative health consequences of obesity, namely fasting-state insulin levels (Pearson correlation: r = 0.22, p = 0.020; 95% CI = 0.04, 0.39), measures related to insulin—HOMA-IR (a marker of insulin resistance; Pearson correlation: r = 0.24, p = 0.015; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.41), and C-peptide levels (Pearson correlation: r = 0.23, p = 0.018; 95% CI = 0.04, 0.40)—and fasting-state leptin levels (Pearson correlation: r = 0.34, p = 0.001; 95% CI = 0.16, 0.49; Fig. 3c). All these associations remained significant when statistically controlling for age, education, total brain volume, and average head motion.\n\nIn Study 2, the correlation between predicted log(k) and BMI was positive but not significant (Pearson correlation: r = 0.09, p = 0.28; 95% CI = −0.07, 0.25). However, paralleling the findings in Study 1, overweight-to-obese participants had a significantly higher k-marker response (higher predicted discounting) compared with lean participants (two-sample t test: t(143) = 2.11, p = 0.037; Cohen’s d = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.57; Fig. 3b).\n\nThresholded activation patterns of the k-marker\n\nActivation patterns across the whole-brain gray matter and across all three contrasts are used for prediction and cross-validation. To identify the areas that contributed the most strongly with positive or negative weights, we used a bootstrapping procedure (5000 samples). Bootstrapped weights were thresholded at q = 0.05 FDR corrected across the whole weight map of the combined feature space (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Figs. 2-1, 2-2, 2-3).\n\nOur results revealed a distributed network of areas that jointly contributed to individual differences in delay discounting, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), ventral striatum, anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), hippocampus, and frontoparietal and visual areas (Fig. 2). Predictive activity patterns differed for the processes captured by the three different contrast images. Of note, some regions showed negative weights (i.e., predicted less discounting) for one contrast but positive weights (i.e., predicted more discounting) for another. For the Choice (vs implicit baseline) contrast, activity in the striatum, the anterior insula (AI), and lateral prefrontal areas contributed positive weights for more discounting, whereas activity in visual, premotor, and motor areas contributed negative weights. For the parametric modulation by LL Amount, activity in vmPFC, aMCC, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and frontoparietal areas contributed positive weights for greater discounting, whereas visual areas and premotor areas contributed mainly negative weights. For the parametric modulation by Delay, we observed positive weights in the most ventral part of the vmPFC, premotor areas, and visual cortex, and negative weights in frontoparietal areas and brainstem regions.\n\nTo further assess the stability of weights, we tested whether developing the predictive model on the data of Study 2 and testing on Study 1 would yield comparable results. Training and cross-validating the model on the data of Study 2 resulted in similar prediction and transfer accuracy (Fig. 4) and qualitatively similar weight maps (Fig. 4). At the FDR-corrected level, voxels with significant weights in both directions (conjunction null; Nichols et al., 2005) for the LL Amount contrast were found in aMCC, bilateral AI, vmPFC, ventrolateral PFC, dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), intraparietal sulcus, visual cortex, and cerebellum. For the Delay contrast, significant weights in both directions were found in aMCC, dlPFC, parietal cortex, and AI. No voxels survived FDR correction in both directions for the Choice contrast.\n\nTraining predictive patterns on the three contrasts separately resulted in lower predictive accuracies (Fig. 5).\n\nSimilarity of k-marker brain patterns to meta-analytic maps\n\nWe next compared the predictive maps of the k-marker with term-based meta-analytic images (Yarkoni et al., 2011) for processes that may contribute to intertemporal decision-making. We computed the spatial correlation (Pearson’s r) between the k-marker and meta-analytic maps for (1) affective- and value-related, (2) conflict-related and cognitive control-related, and (3) memory-related terms (Fig. 6). While these spatial correlations are descriptive (Koban et al., 2019), they can inform us quantitatively whether and in which direction (positive or negative) previously identified functional networks contribute to individual differences in delay discounting.\n\nValue-related and affect-related maps (especially “affect” and “emotion”) showed consistent positive correlations (r values > 0.05) with the Choice-related pattern of the k-marker, in line with the idea that more affect-related activity during intertemporal choices leads to more impatient decisions. However, stronger engagement of affective and especially “reward”-related and “value”-related activity for increasing LL Amount (and, to a lesser extent, for increasing delays) was associated with less discounting. This suggests that lower discounting is associated with greater sensitivity of valuation-related signals to the amount of LL rewards.\n\nIn contrast to our initial hypothesis, more activity in cognitive control-related areas was not associated with lower discounting. Instead, there were positive correlations (r value range, 0.05–0.19) of the Choice pattern with meta-analytic maps for “attention,” “cognitive control,” “conflict,” and “executive” (i.e., more positive weights predicting greater discounting). Further, stronger activation of control-related maps by greater LL Amount was associated with greater discounting, whereas stronger activation of control-related activity for longer delays was associated with less discounting.\n\nFinally, we assessed the contribution of brain systems related to memory and prospection. While the term “memory” (which also includes working-memory studies) showed a pattern similar to that for control-related maps, more specific terms such as “episodic memory,” “imagery,” and “planning” were not substantially positively or negatively correlated with any of the k-marker patterns (r values approximately ≤0.05).\n\nParallel findings were obtained when testing whether activity in nonoverlapping meta-analytic maps (Yarkoni et al., 2011; for value-related, cognitive control-related, or episodic memory-related activity) could separately predict log(k) (Fig. 7). Whereas areas associated with “cognitive control” showed significant prediction in Study 1 and transfer to Study 2, areas associated with value predicted discounting in Study 1 but no significant transfer to Study 2. Areas associated with episodic memory showed only marginal prediction in Study 1 and no significant transfer to Study 2.\n\nLocal prediction of log(k)\n\nFinally, we assessed whether activity patterns in smaller, more local brain areas could predict out-of-sample log(k) in Study 1 and whether such predictions would accurately transfer to Study 2. For this purpose, we used an established multimodal cortical parcellation (Glasser et al., 2016) in combination with several other, subcortical parcellations (Diedrichsen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2013; Bär et al., 2016; Pauli et al., 2016), resulting in a total of 485 regions (publicly available at https://github.com/canlab/Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks/tree/master/Atlases_and_parcellations/2018_Wager_combined_atlas). We trained and cross-validated a separate classifier for each region (combining functional activity across all three contrasts). For each region, we then tested whether the patterns trained on Study 1 data were predictive of individual differences in Study 2. Activity patterns that consistently predicted delay discounting in both studies were found in mid-cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, right insula, and lateral frontal and parietal areas (Fig. 8, Table 2), in line with the contributions of these areas in the whole-brain predictive pattern. In addition, activity patterns in amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and brainstem areas (periaqueductal gray) also predicted individual differences in delay discounting in both studies.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA major goal of neuroscience and psychiatry is to identify neuromarkers of transdiagnostic processes that are altered across different diseases or predispose individuals to such diseases (Insel and Cuthbert, 2015). Delay discounting—how much people prefer sooner compared with future rewards—has been proposed as such a transdiagnostic process across obesity and various forms of psychopathology, especially addiction and eating disorders (Bickel et al., 2014; Amlung et al., 2019; Lempert et al., 2019). In this article, we advanced our understanding of the brain processes that drive variability in decision-making by identifying a distributed pattern of functional brain activity that predicts individual differences in delay discounting. We first used a cross-validation procedure to develop a novel functional brain marker of delay discounting (k-marker) based on whole-brain, gray matter-masked fMRI data (N1 = 110). We then validated the k-marker (trained on Study 1 data only) in an independent second fMRI dataset (N2 = 145), sampled in a cohort with different sociodemographic characteristics, on a different fMRI scanner, and using a different delay discounting task. Prediction–outcome correlations were 0.49 (Study 1) and 0.45 (Study 2), as large or larger than the prediction of individual differences in other domains reported in previous studies (Rosenberg et al., 2016; Beaty et al., 2018; Han et al., 2022). In both studies, individual differences in discounting were stable over time, and k-marker responses measured at baseline significantly predicted behavior several weeks later.\n\nRecent findings have questioned the utility of brain imaging in predicting individual differences, especially for structural and resting-state fMRI data and for univariate, voxelwise associations (Marek et al., 2022). An important advance of the present study is that it overcomes many of the limitations of previous studies by providing an independently cross-validated and multivariate “brain model” (Kragel et al., 2018) of stable individual differences in impatient decision-making, in line with recent recommendations on studying brain-based prediction of individual differences (Rosenberg and Finn, 2022). As such, this brain model can be directly tested, validated, or refined in other existing or future fMRI datasets acquired during an intertemporal choice task. Its predictive performance can also be tested in clinical populations, such as patients with severe obesity, eating or substance use disorders, and other types of psychopathology.\n\nOur results also inform the debate regarding the contributions of specific brain regions and functional networks to individual differences in delay discounting. Among the brain areas that contributed with positive and/or negative weights were the vmPFC, striatum, and other regions associated with valuation and reward (Levy and Glimcher, 2011; Bartra et al., 2013; Clithero and Rangel, 2014). This finding is in line with previous, univariate findings (Cooper et al., 2013; Pehlivanova et al., 2018; MacNiven et al., 2020). The present results add to this emergent picture by showing that greater sensitivity of reward-related and value-related areas to the amount of the LL reward is linked to more patient decision-making.\n\nSignificant weights were found most consistently in the frontoparietal areas, midcingulate cortex, and anterior insula. Activity in these areas also allowed for significant prediction based on local activity alone [Fig. 8, region of interest (ROI) analysis]. The dlPFC has been theorized to implement self-control and far-sighted decision-making (McClure et al., 2004; Hare et al., 2014). Yet the present results are surprising as they draw a more complex picture of the contributions of these areas to delay discounting, with modulation of these areas by greater LL rewards being positively associated with discounting and modulation by delay being negatively associated with discounting. Thus, areas meta-analytically associated with cognitive control were recruited more for long delays and small LL amounts for low discounters, and for shorter delays and larger LL amounts for high discounters. These are the cases in which decisions are most difficult (closer to the indifference point) and therefore require resolution of response conflict (Botvinick et al., 2001; Kool et al., 2013; Shenhav et al., 2013; Hutcherson et al., 2020) or integration of expected value and risk of future rewards (Tobler et al., 2009).\n\nThese findings have implications for models of delay discounting and self-control in cognitive neuroscience. First, they speak against the idea of a simple dual process account of intertemporal choice and self-control (McClure et al., 2004), joining previous work that has suggested more complex neural processes at play (Kable and Glimcher, 2007; Ballard and Knutson, 2009; Hare et al., 2014; Berkman et al., 2017). Second, they also speak against the idea that more frontoparietal activity is related to higher individual levels of self-control. Instead, they suggest that for which choice options control-related areas are activated is more informative than their overall level of activation. This finding is in line with value-based choice models of self-control (Berkman et al., 2017) and with recent evidence that high and low discounters differ in how much attention they allocate to amount versus delay information (Amasino et al., 2019). It also fits with the idea that low discounters may not need “control” to discount less (Lempert et al., 2019), and that high discounters may use cognitive control for different types of decisions.\n\nIn line with the importance of prospection and self-projection in intertemporal decision-making, the hippocampus and adjacent midtemporal areas have been associated with individual differences in discounting (Benoit et al., 2011; Peters and Büchel, 2011; Lebreton et al., 2013). The k-marker has significant weights in parahippocampal areas and in occipital areas, but the weight maps were not strongly associated with broader meta-analysis-based activation maps of episodic memory or prospection, possibly because those masks also include many areas that are involved in processes other than memory and prospection. In agreement with the k-marker results and the literature described above, our ROI-based results showed significant local prediction of individual differences in delay discounting in hippocampus, amygdala, and the memory-related anteromedial thalamus.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of investigating distributed brain activity patterns, confirming the notion that delay discounting depends on the interactions among different functional processes and networks in the brain. In addition to frontoparietal areas, midcingulate, and hippocampus, several other cortical and subcortical areas also allowed for cross-validated local prediction of individual differences in delay discounting, across both datasets. Consistent with the whole-brain results, these included several areas in the mid-insula and posterior insula, which are involved in interoception (Craig, 2009), salience (Bartra et al., 2013), and exploration (Zhen et al., 2022)—processes that may all be involved in delay discounting. Local prediction was also found in subcortical areas associated with affect and visceromotor control, including the amygdala and the periaqueductal gray.\n\nPrevious work has related individual differences in delay discounting with obesity, substance use disorders, and psychiatric diseases (Peters and Büchel, 2011; Amlung et al., 2019; Lempert et al., 2019). In the two samples presented here, log(k) values based on participants’ choices themselves were not significantly associated with BMI or overweight. However, the two studies were not designed to include a large range of BMI or many obese participants, and obesity-related alterations in discounting might be more pronounced for food than monetary rewards. While in Study 1 participants’ height and weight were measured by the experimenters, these values were self-reported in Study 2, which might explain the lower associations with BMI in Study 2.\n\nIn contrast to discounting behavior, responses to the k-marker significantly differed between lean and overweight participants and predicted out-of-sample blood markers related to glucose and fat metabolism. These findings suggest that this functional brain marker reflects variance in neurophysiology that is related to stable long-term patterns in decision-making and health. The k-marker even seemed more sensitive to individual differences than the behavioral measures it was trained on, potentially because it is a closer reflection of the neurophysiological underpinnings that drive both discounting behavior and more distal health outcomes, in line with previous evidence that brain-based prediction can outperform behavior-based prediction (Genevsky et al., 2017). Of note, our approach is cross-sectional and remains agnostic regarding potential causal links among brain function, behavior, and body weight. While higher discounting is typically considered a causal or predisposing factor for weight gain, an alternative hypothesis is that overweight and changes in metabolism lead to changes in brain physiology and subsequent behavioral outcomes (Schmidt et al., 2021; Cornil et al., 2022). Future work can test the k-marker in larger numbers of participants with obesity and other health conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the k-marker—a novel fMRI-based brain signature—predicts individual differences in intertemporal decision-making in neurotypical, healthy adults across different populations, scanners, and analysis pipelines. It can be quantitatively tested in any other fMRI study on delay discounting for which contrast images for Choice, LL Amount, and Delay can be computed, including in other delay-discounting paradigms, such as those that involve nonmonetary rewards such as food or social discounting tasks (Jones and Rachlin, 2006; Strombach et al., 2015). Future work could test the generalizability of the k-marker in children, adolescents, the elderly, or clinical populations. Most importantly, future work will show whether the k-marker prospectively predicts clinical status and health outcomes in conditions related to abnormal discounting, such as eating disorders, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders."
