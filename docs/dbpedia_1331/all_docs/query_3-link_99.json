        "text": "Sometime last winter, while I was preparing to give a piano recital in New York, my teacher, Seymour Bernstein, handed me an application for a new piano competition. It was to be held late the following spring in Fort Worth, and it was for amateurs. Would I like to participate, Seymour asked? I was focused on the recital. My first child was about to be born. The competition was months away. I agreed to enter it without really thinking. I didn't realize at the time that it would cause me, during the course of several ulcer-inducing days in June, to reflect on the entire course of my life.\n\nI had been a serious pianist until I finished college. At that point, for reasons I'm just coming to see, I abruptly gave it up. Fifteen years passed during which I went to graduate school, became an art critic and never touched a piano.\n\nThen three years ago, equally abruptly, I began playing again. During the past two years, after testing the waters by performing privately for friends, I started to give public concerts. I loved playing more than I had before I quit. When I was young I contemplated a career. Now I performed for the sheer exhilarating pleasure of it.\n\nThe contest Seymour had mentioned was the International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs, organized by the Van Cliburn Foundation, which runs the Van Cliburn competition for professionals. Started in 1962 in Van Cliburn's hometown of Fort Worth, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition is a huge deal, despite its dubious record of picking winners.\n\nThe suggestion for an international competition for amateurs came from Nela Rubinstein, Arthur Rubinstein's widow. She based the idea on the Concours des Grands Amateurs de Piano in Paris. The foundation collaborated with the Paris competition organizers on the details. Several of the French judges were invited to be on the jury. So was Rubinstein's daughter, Alina, and so was Seymour, who is a prominent teacher in New York.\n\nThe foundation received about 150 applications. Usually competitions choose participants on the basis of audition cassettes or videotapes. This being an amateur event, the rules were less strict. We all submitted brief biographies and lists of everything we had learned, and the foundation made its selection according to the difficulty of the music and the nature of our training.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
