        "text": "Smokers and drinkers had contrasting patterns of cortical functional connectivity involving the orbitofrontal cortex. Smokers relative to non-smokers exhibited reduced functional connectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex which is implicated in stopping and changing behavior and thus to impulsive-compulsive disorders, and in related areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus (Figure 2A). By contrast, high drinkers relative to low drinkers had higher functional connectivity in networks including the medial orbitofrontal cortex (bilaterally though more on the left) which is involved in reward processing, and in related structures including the anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, insula, and superior temporal gyrus. In addition, the mean functional connectivity across the whole brain was lower in smokers than non-smokers. In contrast, mean functional connectivity across the whole brain was higher in high drinkers than low drinkers. The differences in both the overall and the identified links were correlated with the amount of smoking or drinking. For both the smoking and drinking, the differences in overall functional connectivity were correlated with increased impulsivity. These findings with the HCP dataset were cross-validated with the IMAGEN dataset. In addition, analysis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that for the significantly different links between smokers and non-smokers identified in the HCP dataset, those links were lower at age 14 in the IMAGEN dataset in those who became smokers at 19 (Figure 7D). An implication is that the low functional connectivities may not simply be produced by smoking, but may instead contribute to the tendency to smoke. The same was found for the global functional connectivity (Figure 7A). For drinking, analysis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that for the significantly different links between high drinkers and low drinkers identified in the HCP dataset, those links were higher at age 14 in the IMAGEN dataset in those who became high drinkers at 19 (Figure 7B,E) for females, though that effect was not significant in the male participants.\n\nThe low functional connectivity in smokers relative to non-smokers especially involved the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 47/12) which is implicated in stopping and changing behavior, including when reward is not received (Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Robbins, 2007; Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2016), and when there is an instruction to stop in the stop-signal task (Deng et al., 2017). This reduced connectivity also involved the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis (BA 44) and pars triangularis (BA45). Further, damage to the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Berlin et al., 2004; Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2016) and to the right inferior frontal gyrus (Aron et al., 2014) produces impulsive behavior (measured for example in the stop-signal task), where impulsive behavior can be considered as behavior not directly inhibited by non-reward or punishment feedback signals (Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2017). Consistent with this, lower functional connectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex in the present study was related to increased impulsiveness as measured by the delay discounting score (Figure 6). An implication is that smokers may smoke in part because of increased impulsiveness and reduced sensitivity to non-reward and punishment associated with reduced functional connectivity of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and adjacent inferior temporal gyrus. Consistently, we found that the delay discounting score (DDS) was positively correlated with the strength of many of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex links (in the HCP dataset). Thus high FC of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is correlated with low impulsivity.\n\nThe increased functional connectivity in drinkers relative to non-drinkers involved the medial orbitofrontal cortex which is involved in reward processing (Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2017) and structures to which it is connected including the anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. We found that the delay discounting score (DDS) was negatively correlated with the strength of many of the medial orbitofrontal cortex links (in the HCP dataset). Thus high FC of the many medial OFC links was correlated with high impulsivity, which correlated in turn with the amount of drinking. In rats, steeper delay discounting (interpreted as greater impulsivity) is produced by lesions of the lateral OFC, and reduced discounting by lesions of the medial OFC (Mar et al., 2011), possibly homologous regions to those in the primate brain, suggesting a similar opponency of control over impulsivity by these prefrontal cortex regions to that found in the present investigation in humans.\n\nIn the short term just after administration, alcohol increases impulsivity and decreases behavioral inhibition (Smith et al., 2014) (and increases neurophysiological inhibition in some brain areas) (Stephens et al., 2017). The mechanism for the increase in impulsivity produced by alcohol may include reduced activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which tends to have activations reciprocally related to those of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (O'Doherty et al., 2001; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2003; Rolls, 2016; Rolls et al., 2018a). The fact that both drinkers and smokers exhibited greater impulsive choice is consistent with a possible causal role for impulsivity in either the initiation of drinking or smoking or else its exacerbation, as well as other behaviors associated with impulsivity, including aggression in the case of alcohol consumption (Garofalo and Wright, 2017).\n\nTo check the main findings of this investigation, and to control for possible differences in the comparison groups, we directly compared functional connectivity in drinkers and smokers. The hypotheses were that functional connectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex would be smaller in smokers than drinkers; that functional connectivity involving the medial orbitofrontal cortex would be greater in drinkers than in smokers; and that the mean functional connectivity would be higher in drinkers than non-smokers. All these hypotheses were confirmed by the direct comparison of drinkers – smokers in the Results section (see Figure 4).\n\nUsing a separate dataset (IMAGEN (Schumann et al., 2010)) we cross-validated the findings obtained with the HCP dataset. In addition, analysis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that there was an association between the low connectivity in smoking at age 14 (when participants were not smoking) and whether at age 19 individuals were smoking. This association was found for both the global functional connectivities (Figure 7A,B) and the specifically different functional connectivities (Figure 7D,E). A similar relation was found in drinkers, namely that there was an association between the high functional connectivitities at 14 and wherher an individual would be in the high drinking group at age 19. This was significant for females, but not for males. An implication is that the differences in brain functional connectivities identified in this investigation may play a causal role in who will become smokers or drinkers. It will be of interest in future to assess further whether the differences in functional connectivity described here in smokers and drinkers cause the smoking or drinking, for example in research on alcohol drinking endophenotypes or smoking endophenotypes (Ray et al., 2010; Ducci and Goldman, 2012). It is of course also a possibility that drinking may by increasing impulsivity exacerbate the drinking.\n\nThe low functional connectivity that we describe here in smokers in frontal and associated areas may be reflected in the hypofrontality that has previously been described in smokers and has been associated in genome-wide association studies with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the α5 nAcetylcholine receptor subunit, that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia (Barch et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2010; Tobacco and Tobacco and Genetics Consortium, 2010); Schizophrenia Working Group of the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014; Koukouli et al., 2017). So it is possible that smokers self-administer nicotine which acting on this cholinergic receptor may increase cortical neuronal firing, which stabilizes the activity of prefrontal attractor networks, making them more efficient at cognitive control tasks involved in executive function. This has been proposed for the smoking in schizophrenia (Rolls et al., 2008). Thus, we suggest that lower initial whole brain FC in smokers may encourage them to enhance their functional connectivity and hence the functioning of the neural circuitry implicated in cognitive control; smoking can then be seen as a form of ‘self-medication’ which optimizes their behavior.\n\nFor female drinkers there was also an association between high functional connectivity at age 14 and who would be in the high drinking group at age 19. In this case a possible account for the drinking is that it is related to increased functional connectivity or sensitivity of medial orbitofrontal cortex and related reward circuitry, which makes the alcohol more rewarding, and which may also because of the increased sensitivity to reward produce some increase in reward-related impulsivity (Whelan et al., 2012). The acute effects of the alcohol may themselves reduce behavioral inhibition and increase the drinking, thus exacerbating the drinking (Whelan et al., 2014).\n\nFigures 1D and 7C show a negative correlation between the t values for all the connectivities in the brain for drinkers vs smokers. This may be related to the fact that high values of t for the functional connectivity relate to high drinking, and low values t for the functional connectivity relate to smoking. Thus the negative correlation reflects whether individuals are more likely to perform an action of either smoking or drinking. This reflects the fact that in this dataset those who smoke also are more likely to drink. A common underlying factor might be impulsivity.\n\nWe note that although there were overall higher in FC in drinkers, and lower in smokers, to place this in context, FCs were also smaller in males than females in this dataset in smokers and drinkers (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Accordingly, whilst we would not wish to over-interpret the differences in global mean FC in drinking and smoking, the negative correlation between all FCs in drinking and smoking shown in Figure 1E is very suggestive that there is indeed complementarity of the differences found in drinkers and smokers. An interpretation is that smoking and drinking are related to opposite differences in some of many of the links involved. Examples from this investigation are that medial orbitofrontal cortex links are decreased in smokers, but increased in drinkers; and vice versa for lateral orbitofrontal cortex links.\n\nThe differences in functional connectivity described in this investigation were not due to any obvious possible confounding factors such as gender, ethnicity, level of education, marijuana use, or basic brain structure (volume of gray and white matter), which were regressed out of the analysis.\n\nThe use of resting state fMRI is useful for this type of investigation as it does not require task performance that might differ between participants, and such studies can for example predict behavior (Rosenberg et al., 2016) and task performance (Tavor et al., 2016) in different individuals. Structure based morphological comparisons for drinkers and smokers have been performed, but do not necessarily relate closely to what is found with functional investigations, as parts of the brain may have different physiology without much gross anatomical difference.\n\nPossible limitations of this investigation are that linear analyses were used. It is also important to stress that all participants were healthy adults, and that the levels of smoking and drinking exhibited were not directly associated with diagnoses of substance dependence, although they may be relevant to these disorders. Thus the effect size of this study involving the normal use of alcohol and cigarettes could be lower than in a case/control study. But the design of this study, use of individuals in the general population, enable this investigation to have impact on public health, since the use of substances for most of the smokers and drinkers was within a normal range, and we could identify these changes by the use of two large-scale datasets. Although the current study was based on the general population, the findings are in general consistent with previous studies based on clinical populations. For example, chronic nicotine exposure associated with lower functional connectivity was reported in a number of studies (Hong et al., 2009; Weiland et al., 2015). In addition, many studies report that the orbitofrontal cortex, the key region identified in current study, play an important role in the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction (Lucantonio et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2015; Koob and Volkow, 2016). However, the results described here were obtained on populations from the general community, and do not necessarily apply to heavy smokers or drinkers. Moreover, we demonstrate with the IMAGEN dataset that the effect size is sufficient that there is a relation between the brain functional connectivities that we identify at age 14 and who will smoke at age 19. This is good evidence that the effects described in this paper are meaningful, in that the functional connectivity at age 14 can be related to what will happen in terms of smoking and drinking five years later. Additionally, we have removed several possible confounders that may distinguish the two groups, but it might be useful in future investigations to investigate the relation of depression to smoking and drinking. Another possible limitation is that impulsivity was assessed by delay discounting, and it would be of interest to examine the relation to other measures of impulsivity. Another possible area in which future research might extend the findings reported here is that we focused on the amount of drinking using the measure ‘drinking amount per drinking day’, as the relation between the frequency of drinking and the functional connectivity was complex. But this enables us to make an interesting point. The amount of alcohol consumed on a drinking day, the ‘amount’ measure, may well be related to how rewarding the consumption of the alcohol is. Once started on a drinking day, an individual in the High Amount drinking group tends to have more, and this is consistent with the reward value being high. That in turn is consistent with the higher functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex found in the High Amount drinkers in this investigation, and with the evidence that the medial orbitofrontal cortex contains a representation of reward value (Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2017; Rolls, 2018b). Another possible limitation of the drinking analysis is that the control group was a low drinking group rather than a non-drinker group. The reason for this choice was that only 55 participants did not drink any alcohol in the past 12 months, which would have resulted in too small a sample size.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, most of the links were lower in the group that both smokes and drinks. One explanation is that the effect size for the comparison between non-smokers and regular smokers is higher than the effect size for the comparison between low-drinkers and high drinkers.\n\nIn conclusion, we have related for the first time reduced functional connectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and related inferior frontal gyrus to smoking. We interpret the smoking as being related to the increased impulsivity and decreased behavioral inhibition. In addition, smokers have globally lower functional connectivity. A possible interpretation is that smokers may self-administer nicotine in order to increase brain functional connectivity and thereby attention and alertness. We also describe for the first time that drinkers have increased functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a reward area, and globally increased functional connectivity as well as impulsive behavior. An interpretation is that there is a role in drinking of increased reward sensitivity implemented in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. The increased impulsivity in drinkers may also be related to increased reward processing in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and its connected areas. These differences in functional connectivity may play a causal role, as shown by analyses showing that there was an association between smoking or drinking at age 19 and the functional connectivities at age 14 of individuals who at 14 are not smoking or drinking. In both smokers and drinkers, the increased impulsivity may exacerbate substance use. These findings open the way for further investigations of the extent to which these differences contribute to the substance use, or are caused by it. In any case, we note that there may be many factors that influence smoking and drinking, though we have revealed some of the possible underlying factors and brain mechanisms in this investigation."
