        "text": "Absolutely loved speaking at the HP career week, last week. I delivered my new workshop ‚ÄòThe Power of You‚Äô focused on building a magnetic personal brand within a company‚Ä¶ (‚Ä¶because personal branding isn‚Äôt just for entrepreneurs!) We had an amazing turnout of 211 members who I took through the 5 habits of magnetic personal brands: ‚Üí CLARITY: of goals, strengths and areas of development ‚Üí GROWTH mindset: taking responsibility and always learning ‚Üí High performance HABITS: including boundaries and organisation ‚Üí COLLABORATE: collaborating with others and getting involved with your team ‚Üí VISIBLE: becoming known for being good at what you do We also looked at whether they were operating in: ‚Üí Achiever mode (overworking, low boundaries, high personal expectations) ‚Üí Dreamer mode (a little bit lazy, procrastinating, struggling to get things done) ‚Üí Performer mode (in flow, moving forward, investing in their brand). ‚Ä¶ can you guess the split on the results? Amazing feedback and I left feeling so inspired that big companies are investing in these kinds of topics for their team. Thank you HP for having me!\n\nüåü Finding Silver Linings üåü After 12+ incredible years at VMware, my journey took an unexpected turn when Broadcom acquired the company. It felt like being asked to \"take out the trash when you're leaving\" ‚Äì a bit abrupt, but I understand it's just part of the business. However, amidst the uncertainty, I've found myself embracing new opportunities and experiences. Here's a glimpse into what the post-layoff period has brought into my life: üí™ Prioritizing Health: I decided to invest in myself and signed up with a personal trainer. The result? I've been hitting the gym nearly every day and feeling healthier than ever before. üìö Embracing Learning: With more time on my hands, I dove into books on leadership, coaching, and personal motivation. It's been an enlightening journey of self-discovery and growth. ü§î Reflecting on Values and Goals: This transition has allowed me to pause and reflect on what truly matters to me and where I see myself heading in the future. It's been a valuable period of introspection. ü§ù Empathy for Others: I've gained a newfound respect for others facing similar situations. In today's challenging job market, with economic regression and global uncertainties like the conflict in Ukraine, it's more important than ever to support one another. üéì Learning from Experience: The job hunt has been a learning curve in itself. From countless interviews to preparation sessions, I've gained invaluable insights and skills along the way. In the end, I'm reminded of the saying, \"Something good always comes from something bad.\" I'm eagerly looking forward to what the future holds and the opportunities that await. Thank you to everyone who has supported me through this journey. Your encouragement means the world to me. I could end this by thanking everyone building by best career move ever at VMware.. but all of you already know how much of a family you already are and will aways be in my heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThere are a few people in your lives, whose impact is hugely significant. And in my life one of them has been Manish Vyas. During his 23 years at Tech Mahindra, he shaped the company‚Äôs trajectory into making it one of the biggest GSIs in the world. One of his unique leadership styles was to spend time with each individual in his team, share stories, and thereby give some valuable nuggets of wisdom. Among many, here are the two significant ones which have stayed with me forever. 1/ Accountability: He taught me that as a Sales leader, the job is not done until it‚Äôs fully done. Most of the Sales leaders will focus on closing deals, but Manish taught me that the real job starts after closing the deal, and it continues until the project is successfully delivered, and beyond. Many years back on a long walk outside the Directv/ AT&T office, he said - ‚ÄúYou are the CEO of the Account, and even if the Delivery team screws up, the onus will always be on you‚Äù. Since then, the way I operate and run my business has changed tremendously. 2/ Never complain: Complaining has never helped anyone. There are two kinds of people - one that always complain, and find faults with things around them, and then there are others who just learn to live beyond the choas and imperfections. The latter ones succeed in life, and always stay happy. Thank you Manish for your mentorship and for your leadership. Wishing you the very best for your future endeavors. #MomentswithMV #MVinspires P.S: this picture is from July 2018 with Ashish Julka, Brandon Beck (ex CEO and Founder, Riot Games), and Matthew Haymons (CIO, AT&T Prepaid),\n\nI reconnected with John Winsor and his Open Assembly group in 2023. He--and they--are doing so much interesting thinking about the future of work and how we will all--companies and talent--will operate within it. John and his co-author Jin Paik say, \"In the new world of work, one thing is clear--the war for talent is over-- and talent won.\" They go on to explain that you can't actually hire the best person for your open role, because they are working for themselves. üß† For a perspective-shift on how the future of work is already here today, and how both talent and employers can benefit from this new reality, the book is available Jan 16th!\n\nAccording to the annual Axios & The Harris Poll 100 Corporate Reputation Survey, there has been ‚Äúa systemic loss in corporate reputation‚Äù over the past year. Consumer dissatisfaction with higher prices is part of the story, but 72% of those surveyed believe companies are taking advantage of inflation to increase their profit margins. The study also suggests that in addition to wanting companies to prioritize fair prices (53%), Americans would prefer they focus on improving product quality, safety, and consumer satisfaction (48%) and paying good wages/promoting economic growth through job creation (48%) as opposed to ESG (23%), AI investment (13%), and taking proactive stances on societal or cultural issues (11%). NVIDIA, (Minnesota's own) 3M, Fidelity Investments, Sony, and adidas round out the top five highest reputations showing \"excellent\" or \"very good\" scores. Among the trends, Fidelity Investments, Hobby Lobby, and The Coca-Cola Company saw the highest positive changes in reputation while Starbucks, Ford Motor Company, and Anheuser-Busch saw the lowest drops in reputation.

It's leaders like you who inject that Silicon Valley spirit into the veins of the fashion and retail scene which is exactly what this crazy world needs right now. You've been orchestrating business moves like a capitalist maestro, blending innovation, sustainability, and even the thorny issue of human rights into the mix. Not everyone can pull that off, but you? You're a master of the game. Now, as you plot your next move, that Silicon Valley mindset is shining ‚Äì the wisdom to power up by stepping back. That's like some next-level CEO wisdom right there. Now you're diving deep into the trenches of the Silicon Valley startup battlefield, and I gotta say, that's where the magic happens. Consulting, dropping knowledge bombs in lectures, sharing your insights? Man, the youth, the industry ‚Äì heck, even the entire capitalist ecosystem ‚Äì is craving for exactly that kind of wisdom. Your brain is like a treasure trove of entrepreneurial gems, and trust me, folks are lining up to get a piece of that action. So, as you pen the next chapter of your epic saga, remember this: the culture is right there behind you. Let those dollars rain and those ideas flow ‚Äì you got this!\n\nIt all began when I stumbled upon the captivating series \"Mission Navy\" on Nat Geo. The dedication and valor displayed by the men and women in uniform ignited a fire within me to serve my country in the Armed Forces. It was more than just a dream ‚Äì it was a calling that I couldn't ignore. I embarked on the arduous journey of SSB (Services Selection Board) interviews, armed with determination and a heart full of passion. Multiple attempts followed, each with its own lessons and moments of introspection. These were not mere failures; they were opportunities to learn, to grow, and to evolve. The path was far from easy. There were moments of doubt and frustration, but those moments were outweighed by the invaluable lessons I gained. Perseverance became my closest ally. Discipline became my constant companion. The setbacks sculpted my character, teaching me that setbacks are not the end ‚Äì they are the means to a stronger and wiser self. Though the Armed Forces doors did not swing open for me, the qualities I cultivated during this journey did not go to waste. They found new avenues to flourish. The skills of leadership, adaptability, and unwavering commitment that I nurtured served as my foundation when I ventured into the world of business. Today, I'm pursuing an MBA at Symbiosis Centre For Management and Human Resource Development ‚Äì a dream that took root and flourished in the fertile ground of resilience and determination. The qualities that I honed over years of striving for my first dream are now guiding me through the rigors of my MBA program. The art of facing challenges head-on, the skill of effective communication, and the strength to stay focused even in adversity ‚Äì all of these attributes have seamlessly translated into my academic pursuits. As I reflect on this journey, I am reminded that dreams are not linear paths. They are often winding, with twists and turns that test our mettle. It's not about avoiding failures, but about embracing them and harnessing their power to propel us forward. Thank you Flipkart for providing me this opportunity to share my story. #IdeasThatEmpowerDreams #WiREDToEmpower #ssb #indianarmedforces\n\n#GMcuts #GM_IT_CUTS General Motors (NYSE:GM) will cut around 940 IT jobs in Arizona as it will shut its Arizona IT Innovation Center in October, according to a Detroit Free Press report. - Reason for closure: GM says it is rationalizing the number of IT centers in the country and eliminating redundancies. Some employees working on vehicle software will stay. - Work transition plan: GM plans to shift some of the work done at the Arizona center to other centers. It also offers the affected employees to apply for other openings at GM. - Previous layoffs: GM had earlier cut 500 executive and salaried jobs and offered buyouts to all salaried personnel with more than five years of service. The layoffs closely follow GM's (GM) move to eliminate about 500 executive-level and salaried jobs to cut costs. Later, it was revealed that all salaried personnel with more than five years of service were offered a buyout."
