        "text": "Current online marketing techniques utilize a robust picture of the consumer, and an information ecosystem comprised of data aggregators, data brokers, trackers, websites, and ad networks collects and stores online consumer information to facilitate targeted marketing. Yet, tactics integral to online marketing, such as consumer tracking and data aggregation, are found to be consumer concerns by popular and academic surveys (Leon et al. Reference Leon, Rao, Schaub, Marsh, Cranor and Sadeh2015; Martin Reference Martin2015; Martin and Shilton Reference Martin and Shilton2016; Turow, King, Hoofnagle, Bleakley, and Hennessy Reference Turow, King, Hoofnagle, Bleakley and Hennessy2009; Ur, Leon, Cranor, Shay, and Wang Reference Ur, Leon, Cranor, Shay and Wang2012).Footnote 1\n\nThis tension—between consumers’ stated privacy preferences, as measured in surveys, and their actual behavior, as measured by consumers’ continued online activity—is referred to as the privacy paradox by academics and practitioners. Research on the privacy paradox explains that consumers may judge privacy as important in surveys but (paradoxically) continue to engage with websites and disclose information (Kokolakis Reference Kokolakis2017; Norberg, Horne, and Horne Reference Norberg, Horne and Horne2007; Strahilevitz and Kugler Reference Strahilevitz and Kugler2016). As noted by Kokolakis, continued proof of the privacy paradox in research encourages firms to increase the collection and use of personal information (2017). Consumer-facing firms, marketers, and advertising advocacy groups use the privacy paradox to justify their current data practices, while also reporting data that shows that consumers overwhelmingly find such practices problematic and creepy (Guest Author 2018; Lacy Reference Lacy2018).Footnote 2\n\nThe privacy paradox is important for business ethics because the narrative of the privacy paradox defines the scope of corporate responsibility as quite narrow: firms have little to no responsibility to identify or respect privacy expectations, if consumers are framed as relinquishing privacy while online. While researchers continue to identify and explain conditions for the privacy paradox, a growing number of privacy scholars suggest that consumer behavior is not a reliable indicator of their privacy interests. In fact, the term ‘paradox’ is defined as “seemingly absurd or self-contradicting statement or proposition that, when investigated or explained, may prove to be well founded or true.”Footnote 3 Framed in this manner, the oft-cited privacy paradox requires additional empirical testing, since current market behavior may not capture consumers’ approval of the fact that a firm conforms to ethical norms.\n\nThe privacy paradox persists in the face of critiques because the concept relies upon a particular theoretical conception of privacy and type of privacy right. Where others have demonstrated problems with both surveys to measure privacy expectations, as well as problems with consumers’ market decisions, here I examine the theoretical conceptualization of privacy and the type of privacy right assumed in the privacy paradox. The goal of this paper is to test the privacy paradox by empirically examining privacy expectations postdisclosure and measuring consumer valuation of privacy violations. As I explain, for the privacy paradox to persist, one of two assumptions is necessary: (a) that when consumers disclose information and engage with firms, they also relinquish privacy expectations, or (b) that privacy is a preference that is easily negotiated away in the market. Philosophers and legal scholars, on the other hand, argue that reasonable privacy expectations exist postdisclosure and that privacy is a right similar to a core value to be respected at all times. Through a series of four factorial vignette surveys, the importance of consumer privacy norms is compared to both the benefits of sharing information and clear violations, such as security breaches. A trust game experiment then quantifies the impact that violating privacy norms has on consumers’ willingness to engage with a market actor. In doing so, this study measures the scope and valuation of privacy using both a survey technique designed to combat respondent bias, as well as actual behavior in an experiment when market actors are fully informed and given a choice.\n\nIf, as shown here, disclosure is not a meaningful point at which privacy is compromised, then (1) consumers are not acting paradoxically when going online, and (2) firms have a very different type of obligation to understand and respect the privacy of consumers. Where firms currently are framed as having, at most, a duty to not interfere with consumers choosing to relinquish privacy, this paper broadens the scope of corporate responsibility to suggest firms may have a positive obligation to identify reasonable expectations of privacy of individuals. Finally, the results impact how privacy is conceptualized and empirically examined in business ethics; research perpetuating the privacy paradox through the mistaken framing of disclosure as proof of anti-privacy behavior is harmful as it gives license to firms to act contrary to the interests of consumers."
