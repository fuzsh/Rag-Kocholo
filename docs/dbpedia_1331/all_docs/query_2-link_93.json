        "text": "Product Specific Information\n\n61-7300 has been successfully used in Western blot, Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, ELISA and Immunohistochemistry.\n\nTo achieve appropriate staining results on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections, protease Type XIV (Actinase E) pretreatment is required. The recommended dilution and incubation for protease is 1-2 mg/mL at 37°C for 10 minutes. Other enzyme and Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval pre-treatment methods may not be suitable for this particular antibody. Frozen sections have been successfully stained after fixation with acetone at 4°C.\n\nTarget Information\n\nZO-1 forms complexes with either ZO-2 or ZO-3. In addition, these proteins can also associate with claudin, occludin and F-actin, at tight junction stands, where they provide a linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the tight junction. ZO-1 expression is significantly reduced in many breast cancer lines. ZO-2 and ZO-3 are ubiquitously expressed within epithelial tight junctions, and unlike ZO-1, which is also expressed at cell junctions of cardiac myocytes, ZO-2 is not expressed in nonepithelial tissue. ZO-1 is a protein located on a cytoplasmic membrane surface of intercellular tight junctions. ZO-1 may be involved in signal transduction at cell-cell junctions. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for the ZO-1 gene. Diseases associated with ZO-1 dysfunction include Celiac Disease and Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome."
