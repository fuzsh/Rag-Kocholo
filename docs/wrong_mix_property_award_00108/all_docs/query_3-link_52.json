        "text": "As part of Women's History Month, we honor Toni Morrison, the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author who was born in Lorain, where she attended Hawthorne Elementary School and worked in the public library.\n\nAs a child, Morrison enjoyed the folk tales her father told her, many of which would later influence her vivid writing style and epic themes that typically featured strong women.\n\nMorrison received her undergraduate degree from Howard University and her master's from Cornell. She taught at Texas Southern University, Yale, Princeton and Howard, where she wrote her first novel, \"The Bluest Eye,\" in 1970, while a single mother of two children.\n\nHer third novel, \"Song of Solomon,\" in 1977, brought her national acclaim. But it was her fifth novel, \"Beloved,\" in 1987, that established her as one of the country's greatest writers. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was subsequently named by The New York Times the best American novel in the previous 25 years.\n\nMorrison, now 80, won the highest literary award, the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 1993.\n\n-- James F. McCarty"
