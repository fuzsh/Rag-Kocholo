        "text": "Starting 2024-2025, Toni Morrison Hall and the Language House at Toni Morrison Hall will house sophomores, juniors and seniors.\n\nThe hall is named for Toni Morrison, the first African American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Morrison earned a B.S. in English in 1953 at Howard University and a master’s degree in American literature in 1955 at Cornell. An A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell from 1997 to 2003, Morrison returned to the Ithaca campus numerous times over the years.\n\nThrough creative floor plans, Toni Morrison Hall provides living spaces with a modern aesthetic that enhances the residential experience and encourages interaction and collaboration among students. Toni Morrison Hall aims to draw students out of their individual rooms and into ample common areas that support group study, social interaction, and programs in spacious lounges and nearby cafés.\n\nSelf-governance is well established in this community, with plenty of leadership opportunities. The student-driven Community Council arranges programs and events for residents, ranging from group outings to see plays or go apple picking to educational programs focused on women in the workplace, surviving academia at Cornell, sexuality and relationship development, and body image.\n\nCommunity Features"
