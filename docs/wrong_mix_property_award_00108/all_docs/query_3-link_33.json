        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Morrison: She is a friend of my mind.\n\nShe gather me, man.\n\nThe pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order.\n\nIt's good, you know, when you've got a woman who is a friend of your mind.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ My grandfather bragged all the time that he had read the Bible through five times, from cover to cover.\n\nI thought, why does he keep reading that book?\n\nThen I realized there weren't any other books.\n\nAnd it was illegal in his life to read.\n\nAnd it was illegal for white people to teach black kids to read.\n\nSo it was a revolutionary thing.\n\nAnd that sense of it being confrontational permeated our house, although I didn't understand why so early.\n\nLater on I did.\n\n♪♪ My sister taught me to read when I was three.\n\nAnd we used to get down on our knees on the sidewalk with a pebble, and write \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"I hate you,\" you know, or I \"hat\" you because we didn't know the \"e.\" One day we noticed another word down the street about half a block away, and we decided to write it.\n\nSo we got together, expanding our vocabulary.\n\nWe wrote \"F,\" and then looked over there.\n\n\"U,\" and we were just getting ready to do the \"C,\" when my mother ran out of the house and started screaming.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?!\"\n\nShe's furious.\n\n\"You, go get a bucket of water.\n\nYou, go get a broom.\"\n\nAnd we were crying because we don't know what happened.\n\nWe have to get rid of the words and she doesn't say the word, she doesn't say what it is.\n\nShe never does, in my entire life.\n\nI don't know how old I was before I found out what it meant.\n\nAnd she never tells us what it's about.\n\nBut ultimately I knew that words have power.\n\nWords can do that to my mother, a word I don't even know.\n\nNow that is power.\n\n♪♪ I get up before the sun rises.\n\n♪♪ I always get up early.\n\nI want to beat the sun.\n\nSo I have to be there just before it comes up.\n\nIt's the best time.\n\nThat part of the day is incredible.\n\nI'm very, very smart early in the day.\n\nLater on, I -- ugh.\n\n[ Laughs ] What?\n\nBut early I'm very good, very sensitive.\n\nAbout three or four hours I'll work every morning.\n\n♪♪ 'Cause I got up early to write because I had small children.\n\nAnd if I got up at 5:00 before they woke I could do some work.\n\nThen the children grew up and went away.\n\nAnd I was still getting up at that hour and unwilling and unable and unenthusiastic about writing after lunch, or writing at night.\n\nThe only time I really wanted to do it and was good at it, I thought, was very, very early in the day.\n\nIt's still that way.\n\n♪♪ Sometimes you're nudged.\n\nAnd sometimes you're just searching, to make the writing interesting to me.\n\nIt's not just writing, it's, \"I don't know what this means, but I have to find out and I have to explore all the character's attitudes,\" and so on -- \"I've got to know.\"\n\nI really have to know.\n\nAnd the only way I can know, and own what I know, is to write it and then let you read it, so we both know.\n\n[ Chuckles ] Griffin: When you read early reviews of Toni's work, those early, sympathetic liberal reviewers, and I remember one of them about \"Sula.\"\n\nAnd the reviewer says, \"She's got a great talent.\n\nOne day she won't limit it to only writing about black people.\"\n\nLike, really?\n\nIt's limiting for her to write about black people?\n\nNo one says that when, you know, an Irish writer writes about Irish people.\n\nYou know, it's only limiting when you write about black people.\n\n♪♪ In spite of its richness and its thorough originality, one continually feels its narrowness... ...its refusal to brim over into the world outside its provincial setting.\n\n♪♪ Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous recorder of the black side of provincial American life.\n\n♪♪ If she is to maintain the large and serious audience she deserves, she is going to have to address a riskier contemporary reality.\n\n♪♪ Morrison: I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people.\n\nI remember a review of \"Sula\" in which the reviewer said, \"One day she\" -- meaning me -- \"will have to face up to the real responsibilities and get mature and write about the real confrontation for black people, which is white people,\" as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze.\n\nAnd I've spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books.\n\n♪♪ Davis: Toni Morrison's project resides precisely in the effort to discredit the notion that this white male gaze must be omnipresent.\n\nNewsreader: The center of the Negro's life is the Southern town.\n\nAnd once a week, the family car rattles through its streets.\n\nThe rich, melodious tones of Negro voices hover in the warm air as the men gather to discuss the crop and pass the time of day.\n\nFor the women as well as the men, the town is a social center, the mainspring of gossip and human relations.\n\nIt is by their spontaneity, in play or at work, that we glimpse the innate grace of these people.\n\nMorrison: In this country, many books, particularly '40s, '50s, you could feel the address of the narrator talking to somebody white.\n\nI could tell because they're explaining things that they didn't have to explain if they were talking to me.\n\nThe assumption is that the reader is a white person, and that troubled me.\n\n♪♪ They were never talking to me.\n\nEven Frederick Douglass, he's not talking to me.\n\nI can feel him holding back.\n\nAnd I understand that because the people supporting him were abolitionists -- white people.\n\nAnd sometimes he even says it.\n\n\"These things too terrible to relate.\"\n\nLike rape.\n\nHe didn't talk about it.\n\nSame thing I felt was true with Ralph Ellison, I felt was true with so many great writers.\n\n\"Invisible Man.\"\n\nInvisible to whom?\n\nGriffin: When she says, \"Invisible to whom,\" about \"Invisible Man,\" which is like, \"How dare she question the great novel?\"\n\nShe doesn't question whether or not it's a great novel.\n\nShe doesn't question whether or not it's exquisitely written.\n\nShe questions that perspective that you are only defined by what your oppressor thinks of you.\n\nLike, guess what: there's this whole other world going on when they aren't even looking.\n\n♪♪ Morrison: \"Not until the white folks left, the gravediggers, Mr. and Mrs. Hodges, and their young son who assisted them, did those black people from up in the Bottom enter with hooded hearts and filed eyes, to sing, 'Shall We Gather at the River' over the curved earth that cut them off from the most magnificent hatred they had ever known.\n\nTheir question clotted the October air, 'Shall We Gather at the River?\n\nThe beautiful, the beautiful river?'\n\nPerhaps Sula answered them even then, for it began to rain, and the women ran in tiny leaps through the grass for fear their straightened hair would beat them home.\"\n\nAls: My world is a black world.\n\nShe was doing something that a lot of black writers who had come up in the '70s weren't doing, which was to write about the stories without having to talk about excising whiteness.\n\nAnd she didn't do it in a way that was about saying that the white world was wrong.\n\nThe white world was just peripheral, if it existed at all.\n\nMorrison: I didn't want to speak for black people, I wanted to speak to, and to be among -- it's us.\n\nSo, the first thing I had to do was to eliminate the white gaze.\n\nJimmy Baldwin used to talk about that, the little white man that sits on your shoulder and checks out everything you do and say.\n\nSort of knock him off.\n\nAnd, you know, you're free.\n\nNow I own the world.\n\nI mean I can write about anything, to anyone, for anyone.\n\nI don't have to have this white judgmental eye checking me, editing me, approving of me.\n\nIt has nothing to do with who reads the books.\n\nEveryone, I hope, of any race, any gender, any country.\n\nBut my sovereignty and my authority as a racialized person had to be struck immediately with the very first book.\n\n♪♪ Every book I read about young black girls, they were props...\n\nJokes...\n\n\"Topsy.\"\n\nNo one took them seriously, ever.\n\nI wanted to read a book about that, and nobody was writing about that.\n\nEven when I wrote \"The Bluest Eye,\" I was really writing a book I wanted to read.\n\nI hadn't seen a book in which black girls were center stage.\n\nI wanted to read a book that had no codes, no little notes explaining things to white people.\n\nAnd I had a major, major question in my mind at that time, which was, how does a child learn self-loathing?\n\nWhere does it come from?\n\nWho enables it?\n\nHow is it infectious?\n\nAnd then, what might be the consequences?\n\nPeola: I'm not black!\n\nI won't be black!\n\nBeatrice: Peola.\n\nPeola: She called me black.\n\nJesse called me that.\n\nBeatrice: Jesse Pullman, for shame on you.\n\n[ Sobbing ] Peola: You.\n\nIt's cause you're black.\n\nYou make me black.\n\n[ Sobs ] I won't!\n\nI won't!\n\nI won't be black!\n\nBeatrice: Jessie, how could you say such a mean, cruel thing to Peola?\n\nDelilah: Oh, it ain't her fault, Miss B.\n\nIt ain't your'n, and it ain't mine.\n\nI don't know rightly where the blame lies.\n\nSanchez: This is \"The Bluest Eye,\" a novel by Toni Morrison.\n\nIt begins, \"Quiet as it's kept there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941.\"\n\nIt looks like it should look, right?\n\nIt's been used, right?\n\nIt's been held and over the years, it's torn.\n\nI've thrown this book across the room and picked it up, you know, and then walked down the steps laughing.\n\nLike, you read Toni and you cry, but you got to laugh.\n\nI say, \"Yeah, yeah.\n\nYou really got it.\n\nYou got us all that time.\"\n\n\"I got you in my arena now, ha ha.\n\nI got you.\n\nYou got to read this.\n\nI got you.\n\nYou've got to deal with it finally.\n\nI got you,\" and, if you don't laugh, you know, you don't survive.\n\nQuiet as it's kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941.\n\nWe thought at the time that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigolds didn't grow.\n\nOur seeds were not the only ones that did not sprout.\n\nNobody's did.\n\nMorrison: I started my career with \"The Bluest Eye\" of putting the entire plot on the first page.\n\nSo the reader reads the first page, he knows exactly what happened.\n\nAnd if he turns the page it's because he wants either to find out how it happened or he loves the language.\n\nMosley: It's her rawest novel, and her raw is really wonderful.\n\nIt's truth in so many different ways.\n\nWhich is why it's still, I think, one of her most controversial books.\n\nYou know, people are, like, always wanting to ban it and say, \"Can't let kids read it.\"\n\nBut all the things that people have trouble with is what I kind of love about it.\n\nIt's true in all of her books, what I'm saying, but I think I like it most in \"The Bluest Eye.\"\n\nMorrison: I remember an incident from my own childhood, when a very close friend of mine and I, we were walking down the street.\n\nWe were discussing whether God existed.\n\nAnd she said he did not.\n\nAnd I said he did.\n\nBut then she said she had proof.\n\nShe said, \"I have been praying for two years for blue eyes, and he never gave me any.\"\n\nSo I just remember turning around and looking at her.\n\nShe was very, very black, and she was very, very, very, very beautiful.\n\nHow painful.\n\nCan you imagine that kind of pain?\n\nAbout that, about color?\n\nSo I wanted to say, you know, this kind of racism hurts.\n\nThis is not lynchings and murders and drownings.\n\nThis is interior pain.\n\nSo deep, for an 11 year old girl to believe that if she only had some characteristic of the white world, she would be okay.\n\nShe surrendered completely to the master narrative, I mean, the whole notion of what is ugliness, what is worthlessness.\n\nShe got it from her family, she got it from school, she got it from the movies, she got it everywhere.\n\nMoyers: The master narrative?\n\nMorrison: It's white male life.\n\nThe master narrative is whatever ideological script that is being imposed by the people in authority on everybody else.\n\nThe master fiction, history, it has a certain point of view.\n\nSo, when these little girls see that the most prized gift that they can get at Christmastime is this little white doll, that's a master narrative speaking.\n\n\"This is beautiful, this is lovely, and you're not it.\"\n\nWinfrey: So we are talking about \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison.\n\nI really do think it's a national treasure.\n\nEverybody should read it.\n\nDon't you think the world would be different?\n\nIn all the years of the Oprah Book Club I chose four of her books.\n\nSo I wanted the world, as many people who could hear my voice, to understand the importance of her work.\n\nThe reason why I love the Book Club so much is because you want to have enough books that people feel safe with, they feel comfortable with, they feel like, \"Oh, I can get this,\" when the books are about Robin and Sue and Daniel and Jake; get people to trust, that they feel like, \"Oh, this is something safe I can read and I'm reading about people I know,\" and then bam!\n\nHit them with Toni Morrison!\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Sanchez: In order to survive, you should re-read Toni every 10 years, because every 10 or 15 years, we have to re-imagine ourselves on this American landscape.\n\nYou won't survive if you don't do that.\n\nSomeone said \"reinvent.\"\n\nI said, \"No, no, no.\n\nReinvent means you don't like yourself.\n\nThere's something wrong.\n\nBut reimagine us on this American landscape -- what I must do now, how I must live, how I must rearrange, you know, my vowels, how I must rearrange my toe jam, how I must rearrange my hair, my breasts, how I must rearrange my thoughts.\"\n\nMorrison: My grandparents lived in Alabama and they had a small farm.\n\nThey were sharecropping.\n\nMy grandfather played the violin -- extremely well, apparently -- and chose to go into Birmingham with his violin to make money -- street musician.\n\nMy grandmother got a message to him to say, \"We are leaving, and we're getting on a train, and we're going to Akron, Ohio.\"\n\nShe had relatives in Akron.\n\n\"And if you want to see your children or me again, you will be on that train.\n\nI cannot stay here.\n\nWhite boys are circling.\"\n\nThat's all she had to say.\n\n\"White boys are circling and we have to leave.\n\nI will be on such-and-such a train, such-and-such a time, going north.\n\nIf you want to see us again be on that train.\"\n\nSo what she meant was her girls were growing up, They were probably...\n\nI don't know, 12 or 13, and white boys would come around and look at them -- from a distance.\n\nBut she knew what they had in mind.\n\nThey called him Big Papa.\n\nThe train pulled off and he was not there.\n\nHe was on the train but he didn't want anybody to see him leaving Birmingham because he thought he would be taken off the train or arrested or whatever they do to black people moving.\n\nSo he was hiding on the train.\n\nThe family was thrilled to death that Big Papa was there.\n\nMy mother says she was so happy because for the first time they saw and ate white bread, which is easily the worst thing in the world.\n\nAnd they made their first stop in Ohio.\n\n♪♪ Sanchez: What in the world was in the water in Ohio?\n\n[ Laughs ] 'Cause there was something in that water in Ohio that made you and Rita Dove come out of Ohio and write what you wrote.\n\n♪♪ Morrison: It is my birth name -- Chloe.\n\nMy saint's name, Anthony.\n\nMy maiden name, Wofford.\n\nPeople mispronounced it all the time.\n\nThey said Chou.\n\nEven my teachers.\n\n[ Laughs ] Chlow, Clough.\n\nOr, Clovis!\n\nSo I just shortened it to my saint's name.\n\nAnd then, of course, the married name, Morrison.\n\n[ Applause ] It's a way of dividing your life.\n\nOne of those names is the person who is out there.\n\nAnd the other one is the one who isn't, who doesn't do documentaries.\n\nAls: Middle America is her place, because it's the South, and it's the West and it's the East, and it's a river, and it all comes together.\n\nToni's Lorain.\n\nIt's her beat.\n\nReally, it's almost sort of taken out of the pages of \"The Bluest Eye.\"\n\nMorrison: It was a steel town on the shore of Lake Erie.\n\nAnd there was work there.\n\nFull of immigrants from Poland, Italy.\n\nSome black people from Canada who had escaped, you know, and gone to Canada and come back.\n\nSo it was highly mixed in terms of culture and race.\n\nYou had this poor labor class and very few middle class people.\n\nWe were very, very poor.\n\nWe moved a lot because we couldn't afford the rent.\n\nWhich was four dollars.\n\nMy mother cooked and washed, and so on.\n\nMy father worked, steel mills, different hours.\n\nSo it was irregular when he was home.\n\nI'm not sure that people understand that poverty was not shameful as it is now.\n\nThere was no pressure to get ahead -- you know, really ahead.\n\nWhat you wanted was your family and your health and enough resources to get food and to pay the bills.\n\nAnd if that happened, and you had your churches and your friends, and that was it.\n\nThe people who lived next door when we moved to 21st Street were Russian.\n\nMy mother and the woman, they used to trade recipes.\n\nMy mother learned how to cook some kind of cabbage... thingy... [laughs] from her.\n\nAnd then the people who lived over there, you know, were something else.\n\nThose people were black.\n\nThere were, like, two black families on that street.\n\nThere were neighbors and they watched.\n\nNobody was in there messing with anybody.\n\nIt was calm -- I thought it was boring.\n\n♪♪ I read all the time.\n\nAnd my mother and my grandparents were very eager that we keep that up because they had come from a place where you couldn't read.\n\nThere were no schools.\n\nAnd they felt very strongly about that skill.\n\nMy mother joined the book clubs.\n\nIt was a very precious thing and they were proud of it.\n\nHarris-Perry: We were appalled to learn that Ohio school's leader Debe Terhar has called for banning Toni Morrison's 1970 novel, \"The Bluest Eye\" from the state's Common Core recommended reading list for 11th graders.\n\nNow, Terhar describes the book as \"pornographic,\" and said, \"I don't want my grandchildren reading it and I don't want anyone else's children reading it.\n\nIt should not be used in any school for any Ohio K-12 child.\"\n\nMorrison: I think history has always proved that books are the first plane on which certain kinds of battles are fought.\n\nParents have a right to restrict books in the home.\n\nThey have a right to tell their own children what to read.\n\nThey don't have the right to tell my children what to read, which is what happens when you ban a book publicly.\n\nI have a little framed document in my bathroom, a letter from, I think Texas Bureau of Corrections, saying that \"Paradise\" was banned from the prison because it might incite a riot.\n\nAnd I thought, how powerful is that?!\n\nI could tear up the whole place!\n\nCarrasco: There's something about her skills with language, so that not only do the readers feel that she's talking to them and they can talk back, that they're finding in Morrison a new language about themselves, about the condition they live in.\n\nAnd that discovery gives them a sense of transcendence.\n\nWinfrey: Toni Morrison's work is for all of us, her words, her languaging, is a friend to our minds.\n\nThat's what you're feeling when you're in the midst of a read.\n\nIt comforts you and consoles you and allows you to understand that pain is okay.\n\nShe reaches into the depths of pain and shows us, through pain, all the myriad ways we can come to love.\n\nThat is what she does -- with some words on a page.\n\nThat is what she's doing all the time.\n\nShe's teaching us, all the time.\n\nThere's not a sentence that is not filled with depth of meaning and knowledge and information.\n\nMorrison: Books were interesting to me.\n\nI read everything there was in the library.\n\nEverything.\n\nBut mostly it was the language, you know, different ways to say the same thing.\n\nChoices that the authors were making in order to tell me something or make me see something.\n\nThat was what was fantastic -- still is.\n\nMy sister, when she graduated from high school, got a job in the library.\n\nAnd she very sweetly got me a job as a pusher.\n\nYou would take the books off of a cart and put them back in the shelves.\n\nThe children's part was on the bottom and then above was Dostoevsky.\n\nI mean, they didn't have young adult.\n\nThat didn't exist.\n\nIt was just little kiddie books and then the real world.\n\nBut I was slow because I kept reading the books instead of putting them back fast.\n\nSo I got promoted to the catalog department -- [ Laughs ] Where I worked until I went away to college.\n\nGriffin: I remember reading, at 13, \"Sula.\"\n\nThere was a group of girls on my block.\n\nBelieve it or not in between jumping Double Dutch and playing jacks, we also shared books.\n\nAnd somehow in that circulation there was this book \"Sula,\" with this black woman with a soft afro on the cover, Seeing that there was a character like Sula in the world, it just gave me a world of language to escape to but also a world that I recognized as a young black woman in a working class community.\n\nIt showed me the magic of my own world that I didn't see.\n\nAnd after reading her it was hard to see my own world in the same way.\n\nMosley: The novelist's job is to take you someplace that you couldn't even imagine.\n\nThe novelist's job is to turn you back into a child who's just learned how to read, and has just learned how to imagine what the language is saying.\n\nToni tells extraordinary stories that touch people in a very deep place.\n\nSome people read those books.\n\nSome people make those books into movies.\n\nSome people tell those stories to other people.\n\nSome people teach those books to people who have no interest in reading, but when they hear the story, they go, \"Wow!\"\n\nBooks have an incredible impact on our culture, even though most of our culture doesn't know it.\n\nCarrasco: In 1995 I traveled with Toni to Mexico City.\n\nBut when we arrived we couldn't get out of the car.\n\nThere were so many people that were there to see Toni Morrison.\n\nSomebody else on the stage said, \"Would you like us to translate, to have a simultaneous translator into Spanish of what Toni Morrison reads and says?\"\n\nIn unison, from the audience, it was, \"No!\n\nWe want to just hear Toni Morrison.\n\nWe understand her because we are in her language too.\"\n\nThey know that there's a freedom in this woman's language.\n\nShe took the canon of the written language and she broke it open.\n\nShe's the Emancipation Proclamation of the English language.\n\nGriffin: Everywhere I've traveled in the world, I go to a bookstore.\n\nThere's always a Morrison section.\n\nI get emails from women in China or in Japan who are studying her.\n\nI have graduate students from Asia, Africa, Latin America.\n\nMorrison is a global figure.\n\nShe's a global phenomena.\n\nAnd she speaks to people everywhere.\n\nIf there's life on Mars, they're reading Toni Morrison to find out what it is to be human.\n\n♪♪ Morrison: They were so physically strict with us.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I mean, you know, side eye.\n\nYou don't sit next to no guy.\n\nYou know, they were very serious about that, particularly with the girls.\n\nI don't think they did that with my brothers, the younger ones, but with the girls, you know.\n\nThere was a wonderful place where we could all go and dance, down in South Lorain.\n\nMy mother walked us there... and walked us back!\n\nMy sister got married out of high school.\n\nI didn't, so I was sort of a wild card out there.\n\nI really wanted to go to college, \"A,\" to get away from my family since I was 15 or 16.\n\nAnd you know how families are, they tell you \"Take off that lipstick,\" you know, stuff like that.\n\nBut for me it was leaving home as well as going toward a place where I could read.\n\nI had an uncle who had gone a year at Ohio State.\n\nAnd I lived very close, like seven miles from Oberlin.\n\nAnd my mother said, \"Okay, well, go to Oberlin.\"\n\nAnd I thought, unh-uh, she's going to call me up, and she's gonna say, \"Come here and wash these clothes.\"\n\nSo I wanted to go a distance.\n\nAnd I knew about Howard, so I applied and went.\n\n♪♪ When I got to Howard, I was loose.\n\n[ Laughs ] It's lovely.\n\nI just loved it.\n\nI'm sure I overdid it, but I don't regret it now.\n\n[ Laughs ] I was just the best baker, particularly my sweets.\n\nAnd I made the best carrot cake.\n\nIt's still the best.\n\nNo one, not even my sister, who's close.\n\nThey don't put enough carrots in!\n\n♪♪ There were guys on the faculty, young guys, and they used to pay me $25 for one of my cakes.\n\nAnd they always said, \"Toni, no matter what you do in life you will always be the woman who bakes my cakes.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] I was an English major at Howard University.\n\nBut in the drama department, they read things differently.\n\nYou have to know the emotions, you have to know the conflicts, you have to know, you know, all these subtleties that are in the language which you express them physically and so on.\n\nSo I always preferred the drama department and the Howard Players.\n\nI was very, very good in one part, Queen Elizabeth.\n\nI was excellent.\n\nAnd I turned out to be a star in that one play.\n\nThey wouldn't teach any Black stuff in the English department.\n\nThe closer you got to white-ness -- culturally, academically -- the better off you were.\n\nNow this is a black school funded in large part by the government.\n\nI remember going to my Shakespeare teacher, who was very good, describing to him what I wanted to write my paper on.\n\nAnd I thought I would write about Black characters in Shakespeare.\n\nAnd he was so outraged.\n\nHe said, \"What?\n\nWe're not --\" Like it was sullying Shakespeare's name.\n\nThere were just four characters I wanted to talk about.\n\nNo, he wouldn't let me, so I wrote something else.\n\nRose: You went away to Howard and then to Cornell.\n\nDid you dream of teaching or writing or what?\n\n-Morrison: Oh, teaching.\n\n-Rose: Teaching.\n\nMorrison: I wanted to be a teacher, and I was.\n\nAnd I did that -- I mean, when I left graduate school, I taught at Texas Southern University, then I went to Howard University again as a teacher and stayed there until I couldn't stay there any longer.\n\n-Rose: Because?\n\n-Morrison: I didn't have a PhD.\n\nWhen I was teaching at Princeton, I had one course in creative writing.\n\nAnd I would tell the students, \"I do not want you to write anything about your little life.\n\nI know you have been taught 'write what you know.'\n\nI'm telling you, do not do that.\n\nYou don't know anything.\n\nSo I want you to invent.\n\nI want you to write about a Mexican girl who doesn't speak English, who has a job in Houston as a waitress, as a counter girl.\"\n\nAnd I would throw out these ideas that were far distant from anything in their lives.\n\nAnd I have to tell you, they really took it and ran with it.\n\nIt was almost like a door opened.\n\nMosley: If somebody were saying, \"What do you think Toni is in literature?\"\n\nI would say she had come to an ideal place, and what that place is, it's Shakespearean, but pedestrian.\n\nIn the old days, everybody -- in the tragedies -- were kings and princes and, you know, really important people.\n\nToni's characters, the level of drama and tragedy was about people living everyday lives -- black people, poor people, women, men, you know, whatever.\n\nBut the big thing about it was is that it was pedestrian.\n\nGiddings: They'd never been seen before.\n\nAnd something else hadn't been seen, which was a book that revolved around the friendship of women.\n\nThat was the centerpiece.\n\nShe puts women at the center of these epic narratives.\n\nShe said, \"You know, if you don't understand the history of African-American women, you don't understand the history of America.\"\n\n♪♪ It covers four centuries.\n\nThere are four centuries covered in her work.\n\nAnd so what she does is to step into those times, and places, and just re-imagines.\n\n♪♪ Carrasco: You imagine the past because the past has been ruptured.\n\nThe record of the past, of your people, has been degraded.\n\nIt's been burned up, it's been taken away.\n\nAnd therefore you need the Toni who comes into that past and imagines it historically by putting together fragments and pieces and narratives, that, you know, the white world and the white libraries, they've ignored, they've kept out.\n\nMorrison: When I was teaching at Howard, I got married, had my sons, and got divorced.\n\nI had subscribed to \"The New York Review of Books\" before I left Washington with my infants and moved in with my mother.\n\nOne day, three copies of the same issue appeared in my mother's mailbox.\n\nAnd I thought that was odd, but I looked at it, and in the back there were all these advertisements for professional jobs.\n\nAnd among them was an opening for a job in Syracuse.\n\nA major publisher requires an executive editor.\n\nMale or female.\n\nOriginality and imagination are necessary.\n\nWe prefer a person between the ages of 35 and 45, with a master's degree.\n\nSome experience in teaching is desirable.\n\nAll replies will be held in strict confidence.\n\nBox Z, New York Review of Books.\n\nMorrison: And I remember saying, \"Ah, that sounds like me.\"\n\nTharpe: ♪ This train is bound for glory, this train ♪ ♪♪ ♪ This train, Brother Spain, is bound for glory ♪ ♪ You know this train ♪ ♪ This train... ♪ Morrison: I left my babies at home with my mother.\n\nMy sister and I got in my father's car -- he had an Oldsmobile by then, which he treasured, since the car he had before had no brakes and we had to jump out whenever we got to the place he was taking us to, or he'd hit the curb and say, \"Go.\"\n\nSo now we have a car.\n\nWe drive, my sister and I, to Syracuse.\n\nI interviewed and I got the job.\n\nThat's the beginning of my work there, before Random House bought that company, which was called the L.W.\n\nSinger Company, and everybody had to go to New York that they wanted to go to New York.\n\nAnd they took me.\n\n♪♪ Giddings: I was in the secretarial pool at Random House in 1969.\n\nToni came and was an editor in the trade division on the floor where I was working.\n\nMy friends and I got to know her better when one day she came to ask us to do some typing for her.\n\nAnd we said, \"Sure,\" and she said, \"If you type it, you know, I'm going to come to your apartment and I'm going to make you the best carrot cake you've ever had.\"\n\nSo we thought that was a very good deal.\n\nAnd sure enough, Toni came one day and made the best carrot cake yet I still have ever had.\n\nAnd it was not until later that I realized that we were typing part of \"The Bluest Eye.\"\n\n♪♪ Gottlieb: 1970.\n\nI was 39, Toni was 39.\n\nWe both worked at Random House.\n\nWithin the overall Random House exists Alfred Knopf, which I ran for many, many years, Vintage, Doubleday -- it's got many, many parts.\n\nToni was an editor at what we call a Little Random, and I was running Alfred Knopf.\n\nMorrison: I think, \"They don't know that I'm a writer.\n\nI'm going to keep it that way.\n\nEditor, that's what they want.\n\nThey don't want a writer.\n\nEditors are not writers.\"\n\nSo I don't tell anybody.\n\nAnd I think that works?\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n[ Laughs ] Gottlieb: I became aware of her as a writer only when she published \"The Bluest Eye.\"\n\nAnd of course, since she was a colleague, I was quick to read it.\n\nAnd I thought it was just wonderful.\n\nAnd after the impression it made, the then-head of the overall Random House, Bob Bernstein, quite wisely said, \"We have this wonderful writer who works for us, we should be publishing her.\"\n\nBut it couldn't be Little Random because she was working there, so Knopf, which was the more literary arm, was the obvious place -- and I was the chief editor -- and it was a natural meeting because we knew each other.\n\nAnd with the exception of one novel, I've edited all of her books since.\n\nMorrison: He's the best editor there is, and Knopf was like this very special house.\n\nSo I had the great fortune of being upstairs with an editor, as an author, and downstairs as an editor.\n\n♪♪ And I did both well because I could make the distinction.\n\nThe assumption is when you edit somebody else's book you put your own stuff.\n\nI had that separation because I was a teacher for so long.\n\nYou're looking at student's work.\n\nIt's not yours.\n\nYou make the distinction between the two crafts.\n\nAnd I was good at that.\n\n♪♪ Mosley: I heard two people talking about Toni once.\n\nFirst one said, \"I love Toni Morrison because her novels transcend race.\"\n\nAnd then the next person said, \"I love Toni Morrison 'cause she's not afraid to be black.\"\n\n♪♪ Giddings: The Civil Rights Movement had morphed into the Black Power movement.\n\nSo it was a period of lots of confrontation, of lots of rethinking what race meant, what the relationship of race was to the country and to the state.\n\nImportant black leaders were also emerging and talking about a very different way of thinking about protest, and thinking about changing the country.\n\nIt was an extraordinary time, a very heady time.\n\nLots of people were beginning to publish.\n\nThe black power movement was really very centered on men.\n\nThe predominantly white Women's Movement was very centered on white women and there was always this question about where black women and women of color, in general, belonged in this period.\n\n♪♪ Als: I think that her profound contribution to American publishing has everything to do with the voices that she brought into a largely white institution.\n\nGayl Jones, Lucille Clifton, Toni Cade Bambara, Angela Davis.\n\nThese were all her writers.\n\nShe as, an editor, said, \"It doesn't have to be this way.\n\nLet's break down the ivory tower walls and get all these people together and make a kind of wave of literature.\"\n\nGroup: ♪ The revolution has come ♪ Off the pigs!\n\n♪ No more brothers in jail ♪ Off the pigs!\n\nGriffin: I've heard her say, \"I'm not out on the street in the trenches.\n\nI'm not marching.\n\nWhat can I do where I am?\"\n\nThere's the lesson, right: what can you do where you are?\n\nSo where I am is, I'm an editor.\n\nMorrison: I thought it was important for people to be in the streets, but they couldn't last.\n\nYou needed a record.\n\nIt would be my job to publish the voices, the books, the ideas of African Americans, and that would last.\n\nDavis: She approached me on behalf of Random House with the proposition of writing an autobiography, which, I must say, I thought, at that point, was rather preposterous.\n\nWho writes an autobiography at 28?\n\nReporter: In America, supporters of the black liberation movements are stepping up the pressure in the campaign to free Angela Davis, the black philosophy lecturer and communist who is now facing a charge of murder in California.\n\nDavis: Toni Morrison can be extremely persuasive.\n\nShe finally persuaded me that the book she wanted to publish was the book I wanted to write, only I was not aware of it at that time.\n\nI learned about the importance of the imagination from her in ways that were radically different.\n\nShe would look at something that I had written and she would try to help me make it more evocative, than simply analytical.\n\n♪♪ She would ask questions like, you know, \"Where were you?\n\nWhat was in the room?\n\nWhat was the furniture?\n\nWhat colors were there?\n\nHow did you feel?\n\nWhat did it smell like?\"\n\nAnd so she helped me access my imagination in ways that I continue to be thankful for today.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Griffin: She edits them.\n\nShe does the marketing.\n\nShe picks the covers.\n\nShe's taking care of her writers in a kind of old-fashioned way.\n\nAls: She's the architect, and the midwife, and the artist.\n\nShe's arranging Angela Davis's books on a table.\n\nShe's got on a little beret, a silver beret, and she's the editor.\n\nAngela's the star and she's the editor, sitting back, lighting a cigarette, watching Angela Davis be Angela for the camera.\n\nThat was her job and she was doing her job.\n\nI think that because success came to her relatively late, she was a grown up.\n\nLebowitz: When I first knew Toni she was still working at Random House as an editor.\n\nBut my editor called and said, I got a phone call from Bob Bernstein.\n\n\"You have to stop hanging around in Toni Morrison's office.\n\nShe's not getting any work done.\n\nAll day long, smoking cigarettes, talking.\"\n\nToni went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali.\n\nToni published Muhammad Ali's book.\n\nMan: There has been a first printing of 100,000 copies and there is about to be a second printing of 25,000 copies, and it is a month before publication.\n\nMorrison: When I first met him and I would ask him a question, he would answer and look at a man, and never look directly at me while he was giving the answer.\n\nBut then I remembered he respects older women.\n\nHe's not answering me because I'm in this other category.\n\nBut if I'm like his mother or an older woman...\n\nSo I just crossed my arms.\n\nSo I walk in the room and say, \"Ali, get up from there.\n\nYou have something to do.\"\n\nAnd he would look up and recognize another thing, a grown up, an older version of the...girl.\n\n[ Laughs ] And from then on, he did everything I said.\n\nYou know, everybody liked those jokes, but inside was this completely understanding man.\n\nLoving man, nice man.\n\n♪♪ Navigating a white male world was not threatening.\n\nIt wasn't even interesting.\n\nI was more interesting than they were.\n\nI knew more than they did.\n\nAnd I wasn't afraid to show it.\n\nYou have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people no.\n\nYou don't want to give me the money because I'm a woman and the men get more?\n\nNo.\n\n♪♪ The first job I had in publishing, L.W.\n\nSinger, I noticed that the men in the company got more money when the raises were doled out than I did.\n\nSo I went to my boss.\n\nAnd I said, \"You didn't raise me as much as you did my colleagues who are men.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Yes, but --\" And I said, \"No, I don't want to hear 'but'.\n\nI want to tell you something.\n\nI am head of household, just like you.\n\n♪♪ You may think I'm colored, or a woman, or this -- I'm head of household, just like you.\"\n\nYes, I got the raise.\n\n♪♪ Rose: You raised your two kids.\n\nYour husband left and you had to raise your own two sons, right?\n\n-Morrison: It was terrible.\n\n-Rose: It was?\n\nMorrison: It was very hard.\n\nAwful.\n\nRose: So what did you call on to get it done?\n\nMorrison: My family.\n\nMy brothers, my mother, my grandfather, my sisters.\n\nYou need everybody you know.\n\nI lived in New York.\n\nI was working as an editor.\n\nI was running up and back and forth to Yale teaching.\n\nSo I had to send them home in the summer.\n\nMy family had to come.\n\nAnd even so, it was difficult.\n\nLebowitz: Toni wrote a lot of these books with two little boys in the house.\n\nAnd plus Toni had a rule that she made for herself, not to shut the door where she was working, so that the boys would not feel that they were not allowed to go in.\n\nDavis: She was working on \"Song of Solomon\" and \"Sula\" had just recently been published.\n\nShe would cook breakfast for the children.\n\nAnd then suddenly she would turn away and pick up a pen and jot something down.\n\nAnd often I rode with her to her office at Random House.\n\nWe would be driving into New York City.\n\nThe traffic would stop at the bridge.\n\nShe would pick up a pen again in the car and place a piece of paper on the steering wheel and jot something down.\n\nAnd she was constantly doing this.\n\nLater, when I read \"Song of Solomon,\" I said, \"That was a miracle.\"\n\nAls: I don't know where this woman's energy came from, to raise two kids, to bring other people of color to the party, and also write these novels.\n\nShe said, \"It's not as if I'm doing a lot of different things.\n\nI'm doing one thing, which is I teach books, I write books, I edit books.\"\n\nAnd I think that if you can think of it that way it's a lot more manageable.\n\nMorrison: I remember sitting in my office at Random House with a pad, and I wrote down on the left side everything I had to do.\n\n\"Mother your children, go to the store, pay the bills, edit this, write this,\" and it covered the page.\n\nAnd then I said, \"Of that number, what do you have to do?\"\n\nAnd there were only two things: mother my children, and write.\n\nAnd anything that didn't do that, I struck out.\n\nMan: You see that a title is not selling, you get rid of it.\n\nIf it is selling, you order more.\n\nAnd you learn your clientele, you learn the past sales history of a book.\n\nMorrison: I do remember sitting in a sales conference.\n\nOne of the salesman says, \"We can't sell certain books on both sides of the street,\" meaning there's an audience of white people and maybe an audience of black people, but they don't merge.\n\nSo I thought, \"Well, I will just solve that, and I will do something that everybody loves, particularly black people.\"\n\nAls: \"The Black Book\" is a radical book because she's not giving us any contextualization for blackness, it just is.\n\n♪♪ You open the book and it's photographs of Negro memorabilia, sculptures from the continent, black cowboys, sheet music, racist sheet music.\n\nIt's the jumble that is Black American life.\n\n♪♪ Morrison: There was no singular narrative.\n\nIt was everything.\n\n♪♪ Griffin: She gives us an archive.\n\nThere it is, there are the documents.\n\nYou know, this is from a people who have been told they don't have a history.\n\nWell, here it is.\n\nIt's sort of like before there was an African-American museum, here it is.\n\nAls: It is a study of the emotional and survival aspects of blackness.\n\nIt reminds me of who I am.\n\nMorrison: I had a brother who spent about a year in prison.\n\nAnd I asked him some questions about language, prison language.\n\nAnd he wrote me back and I put it in the book.\n\nMy aunt wrote a piece.\n\nMy mother's face is on the cover.\n\nIt sold like wildfire.\n\nAnd there were wonderful, wonderful responses.\n\nWell, I sent books out to people in places that salesmen wouldn't know.\n\nAnd I sent one to somebody's cousin or something who was in prison.\n\nAnd he wrote me a letter and thanked me, and asked for two more copies.\n\nHe said, \"I need one to throw up against the wall.\n\nI need one to give to a friend.\n\nAnd I just want to hold this one against my heart.\"\n\n♪♪ My father thought that all white people were unredeemable.\n\nLost.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it.\n\nThey will always be awful.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ They would never be human, ever.\n\nMind you, this is a guy who, as a kid, saw two black men get lynched.\n\n♪♪ As a kid.\n\nTwo businessmen.\n\nHanging, yeah -- that's when he left Georgia.\n\n♪♪ He wouldn't let white people in the house!\n\nLike the people who come and sell you insurance and should be there.\n\nBut if a white person knocked on the door and wanted to sell something?\n\nUnh-uh.\n\nMy mother would open the door and chat, give them something to eat.\n\nMy father, no.\n\nShe judged people one at a time.\n\nShe didn't care what color they were, it was a personal thing for her.\n\nAnd then there's this strong memory I have -- I was trying to describe something that happened in a book I wrote called \"Paradise,\" where there is this pure black community versus everybody else.\n\nPart of the purity and the power and very much the pride of that black community is a kind of a flowering of something my great grandmother said.\n\nShe was a midwife in Flint, Michigan.\n\nShe came to town, she walked into the room, and all the men stood up.\n\nAnd my sister and I were on the floor playing.\n\nMy mother was in the room, and my great grandmother came into the room with her stick.\n\nShe looked down at me and my sister and she said, \"These children have been tampered with.\"\n\nSo I didn't quite know what that meant at the time.\n\nIt did not please my mother.\n\nBut she was pitch black.\n\nI mean, really, what they used to call blue-black.\n\nAnd she was saying that we were sullied in some way, that we were impure.\n\nThat's what she said.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Two fountains?\n\n[ Laughs ] In a sense, I know it wasn't true, but in the back of my mind I thought the segregation and the physical stuff was a... a joke.\n\n♪♪ Middle class white people were bathed by black people.\n\nYou know, in their tubs.\n\nAnd they ate their food.\n\nThey did everything, and then they couldn't sit next to them?\n\n[ Laughs ] It just seemed so bizarre.\n\nTrue, but bizarre.\n\nParticularly for me who had come from a little town in Ohio where everybody that I knew -- shopped with, played with, was on a street or in a playground or in a school full of people who came from all over the place.\n\nThere were Mexicans.\n\nThere were tons of Italians.\n\nYou know, it was really a melting pot.\n\nIt really was.\n\nIt was so integrated, whenever any shop opened, my uncle or my mother would be in there the first day, sitting down to make sure there was no unspoken but really real segregation.\n\nAnd nobody ever said to them, \"Leave,\" ever, no one.\n\nNever heard of that.\n\nSo when I went to Howard I was stunned.\n\nThe black students segregated themselves.\n\nI joined a sorority because they asked me and they looked nice, but I didn't know it was the sorority where the light-skinned girls went.\n\nAnd then there was another sorority that was all black, shades of color.\n\nIt was a very horrible social scheme.\n\nStunned me.\n\nI didn't know what they were talking about, 'cause if you got on a bus you could see \"colored, \"white.\"\n\nAnd I would steal those signs and send them home to my mother.\n\nAnd there was one department store where you could go to the bathroom.\n\nAnd we all knew what it was.\n\nBut all the rest, they wouldn't let you go to the bathroom, if you were black -- or \"colored.\"\n\nI remember being compared to Ishmael Reed and Gayl Jones, three writers who are so different and the reviewer ended up deciding which one of us was more accurate about black life.\n\nAnd I was not the one that she chose.\n\nI think she chose Gayl.\n\n\"This is the real black scene.\n\nThis is the real black middle class or lower class.\"\n\nThat's not a literary observation at all.\n\nIt's not a literary point of view.\n\nI think over time it has changed.\n\nIt was really awful in the beginning, Davis: There were those who wanted to ghetto-ize her work.\n\nThe argument has always been that black art is a particular art.\n\nThe particularity of black art has nothing to do with larger concerns of humanity.\n\nHumanity has to be colored white.\n\nAnd so here was a work that was about the particularity, the specificity of black experience, but at the same time there was no question regarding the universal meaning.\n\nSanchez: People knew Toni Morrison was writing.\n\nThey didn't know what to do with what she was writing about.\n\n\"Is this relevant?\"\n\nRight?\n\nShe's writing about black people, maybe it's not relevant.\n\nThen people began to buy Toni Morrison.\n\nAnd people began to talk about her overseas, mind you.\n\nAnd then we began to teach her in the university, also, too.\n\nAnd as a consequence they had to pay attention.\n\nCarrasco: I was coming up on the train from Princeton to New York.\n\nAnd I had \"Sula\" with me.\n\nI went up to the cafe car and there was a line.\n\nAnd I happened to be behind an elderly African American woman.\n\nI don't know what led me to do this, but I decided I was gonna sort of flash my \"Sula\" at her, just to see if we could start a conversation.\n\nI mean I didn't hold it up but I just kind of made it available.\n\nAnd she looked over at me, I'll never forget this.\n\nShe looked over at me, she looked back at her bag, she looked at me again, and she opened her bag and pulled out \"Song of Solomon.\"\n\nShe trumped me with \"Song of Solomon.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"You're reading Toni too?\"\n\nAnd she said, \"Oh yes.\"\n\nshe said, \"You know, this is very difficult to read,\" she said, \"but for some reason I just can't put it down.\"\n\nMorrison: I've never written with a man as a main character or two main characters, but my father died.\n\nAnd I had a very strong negative reaction to the world after he died.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even go back home for three years, because he wasn't there.\n\n♪♪ And I remember sitting down, saying, \"I wonder what my father knew about these men.\"\n\nBut I felt comfortable writing about them, knowing about them, because my father was letting me know.\n\nHe was letting me know.\n\nI didn't get any signs.\n\nThere were no little ghosts that usually accompany me.\n\nBut I knew that he would tell me if I just started.\n\nI have an inside voice now.\n\nAls: Her canvas was getting bigger.\n\nIn \"The Bluest Eye,\" she had beautifully restricted the world to the universe of young girls.\n\nIn \"Sula\" she had restricted the world to the very complex landscape of women.\n\nAnd in \"Song of Solomon,\" she had included both sexes, and the world was just getting larger because of the metaphor of flying.\n\nMan: ♪ I've got wings, you've got wings ♪ ♪ All of God's chillun got wings ♪ ♪ When I get to heab'n I'm

here is that human beings need to find spiritual allies.\n\nSo people have developed these dreams and these stories that you can transcend the suffering of your community in flight.\n\nAnd so what happens in the novel, Milkman discovers that his ancestor flew, got right up out of here and flew.\n\nMorrison: \"Twilight had thickened and all around them it was getting dark.\n\nHe knew there wouldn't be another mistake.\n\nBut the minute he stood up, Guitar would try to blow his head off.\n\nHe stood up.\n\n'Guitar!'\n\nhe shouted.\n\n'Tar, tar, tar,' said the hills.\n\n'Over here, brother man.\n\nCan you see me?'\n\nMilkman cupped his mouth with one hand and waved the other over his head.\n\n'Here I am!'\n\n'Am, am, am,' said the rocks.\n\n'You want me?\n\nHuh?\n\nYou want my

Courage.\n\nDomesticity.\n\nThis is what black people mean to me and still mean to each other.\n\nBut for me, the history of the place of black people in this country is so varied, complex, and beautiful and impactful.\n\nMade a big impact.\n\nNobody could have loved as much as we did, went on with life as much as we did, carried on.\n\nAnd considering the efforts to make sure we never did, considering that, it's amazing.\n\n♪♪ I was in a place once, in Vienna.\n\nThey had an art festival there.\n\nAnd I was asked to go into this room and move in front of a mirror, in a room that was totally dark.\n\nAnd I was instructed to lift my hand and put it on the mirror and just stand there.\n\nAnd then I saw, off in the distance, a figure that came closer and closer and closer.\n\nAnd she put up her hand.\n\nAnd our hands touched.\n\nNeither one of us said a word, just interest, curiosity, and human connection.\n\nThat experience says more and much about what I think I'm doing when I write.\n\nI know I'm not you.\n\nI know I don't know you.\n\nBut I know this.\n\n♪♪ [ Fingers snapping rhythmically ] -♪ When the crimson moon low-rides the night ♪ ♪ There's a shine on the water ♪ ♪
