        "text": "As part of Black History Month, we recognize Toni Morrison, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and the first black woman to win a Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nMorrison, born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931, grew up during the Great Depression in a working-class neighborhood in Lorain, where European immigrants, Mexicans and Southern blacks lived. As a child, Morrison listened intently to the stories her parents, Ramah and George Wofford, told of the traditions and struggles of blacks in the South.\n\nMorrison earned a B.A. at Howard University in 1953 and an M.A. at Cornell University in 1955 in humanities. At Howard, she met Jamaican architect Harold Morrison. They married in 1958, had two sons and divorced six years later. For a temporary escape from her unhappy marriage, Morrision joined a small writer's group, where she penned a story about a girl from her childhood who prayed for blue eyes. This was the basis for her first novel \"The Bluest Eye,\" published in 1970.\n\nMorrison worked for Random House publishing and taught at several universities including Yale and Princeton.\n\nHer novel \"Beloved,\" about a captured slave woman who tried to kill her children rather than see them live as slaves, won the Pulitzer in 1988. She won the Nobel Prize in 1993.\n\n-- Ellen Jan Kleinerman"
