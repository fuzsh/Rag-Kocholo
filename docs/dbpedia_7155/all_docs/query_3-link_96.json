        "text": "To be blunt, a TV comedy vicar is quite possibly the best person to go to for spiritual guidance and emotional sustenance.\n\nThe Meggstravaganza really takes a lot out of me, not even taking into account the post ritual peyote withdrawals I suffer. I really needed something to provide me with support and love, and thankfully Dawny is always up to act as my human bra. Both literally and figuratively.\n\nShe likes soft pecs, that’s for sure.\n\nBut I’ve digressed – it was such a thrill to see Dawn and recharge the batteries with such a close friend.\n\nWe gossiped over the upcoming Ab Fab movie in which we both have cameos and my ongoing feud with Ruby Wax (she knows what she did and a saint like Dawn won’t change my mind – this girl is going to stay on top), before she begged me to pass on a script she had worked on to star in alongside Judi Dench.\n\nWhile I told her I would, I am clearly going to doctor the script, re-write her role to be for me and pass it off as my own work before Judi’s deteriorating eyes never get a chance to see it.\n\nI’ll write in a cameo for her though, as I am such a bloody delight.\n\nWe all know that Dawny has a very well publicised obsession/love for pasties and as much as I enjoy being antagonistic with my friends, I just couldn’t bring myself to make one based solely on carrots. Plus, they act like whoopee in my guts and that would just be a disgusting disaster … thus I went with her second favourite meal, my Dawn French Toast.\n\nThis may come as a shock but sweet breakfasts aren’t really my thing, as who can go past bacon. Now I know that bacon goes well with sweet things, like French Toast, but I generally opt for haloumi and/or mushroom and/or (who am I kidding … they are all ands) hash browns.\n\nOnce again, I’ve digressed. Given that Dawn is one of my sweetest friends and she starred in an hilarious and underrated comedy named after a Marie Antoinette misquote that should have referenced brioche, I felt it was appropriate to dip my toe in the sweet breakfast pool and slather the fluffy, custardy bread in a good, hearty dollop of Cinnamonica Seles Apples.\n\nOh, and carrots … but I don’t think she actually noticed them. Enjoy!\n\nDawn French Toast\n\nServes: 2.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 eggs\n\n⅓ cup cream\n\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n\n1 tbsp brown sugar\n\n4-6 thick slices Briocher Bünsberg (but in loaf form, ok?)\n\n30g butter\n\nMethod\n\nWhisk the eggs, cream, vanilla and sugar together in a large, flat bowl.\n\nMelt the butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat until it is foamy and beautiful.\n\nDip the brioche into egg mixture, flip over and allow excess to dip off before placing into the hot pan. Cook for a minute or so, flip and cook for a further minute, or until golden and crisp.\n\nServe and slather with the condiments of your choosing, bacon and some maple is good … but the Cinnamonica Seles Apples are better."
