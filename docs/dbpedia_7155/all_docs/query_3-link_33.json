        "text": "Roscoe Arbuckle was born 129 years ago today in Smith Center, Kansas. Few actors have risen as high nor fallen so swiftly as far (and unjustly so) as Arbuckle, and it’s a little bit heartbreaking, even all these years later, to think that he died so soon after being exonerated of false charges, that he never had the opportunity to enjoy the triumphant comeback he was so richly due. We won’t address here the legal case that did in Arbuckle’s career—you can readily find that sad, sordid information elsewhere—but we sorely regret that he was subjected to such ill-founded accusations. He deserved better.\n\nWhat’s more, we owe Arbuckle a debt of gratitude not only for his own fine work in pictures, but for recognizing genius and spotlighting Buster Keaton in a few of his films. Perhaps Keaton would have found his way to cinematic stardom, anyway, but perhaps not, without that boost from Arbuckle.\n\nHappy birthday, Mr. Arbuckle, wherever you may be. We’ve shared very few quotes here at Cladrite Radio with which we more heartily agree than yours.\n\n“All who have ever known the real Roscoe Arbuckle will always treasure the memory of the great, generous heart of the man, a heart big enough to embrace in its warmth everyone who came to him for help, stranger and friend alike. It was this quality which led to his downfall, after he had struggled from poverty to a fame in which the children throughout the world worshipped him. Those who knew him for the great artist he was admired him. His was the tragedy of a man born to make the world laugh and to receive only suffering as his reward. And to the end he held no malice.”\n\n—20th Century Fox co-founder Joseph Schenck\n\nDon’t forget—we’re marking this month’s 125th anniversary of Roscoe’s birth by giving away three copies of The Forgotten Films of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. It’s a four-disc DVD set that features 32 restored comedy classics.\n\nAnd as always, you can enter for your chance to win in a myriad of ways (and on a daily basis).

So make the most of it!\n\nFor this week’s Free Roscoe Friday offering, we’re sharing the second half of Coney island, starring Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. (If you missed last week’s posting of the first half, it’s here.)\n\nRemember that we’re marking tomorrow’s 125th anniversary of Roscoe’s birth by giving away three copies of The Forgotten Films of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle.
