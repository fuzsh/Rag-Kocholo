Last but not least, there’s Luke the Dog.\n\nThe Cook and Other Treasures, featuring two long-lost shorts plus the Harold Lloyd short Number, Please?\n\nThe Vitaphone Comedy Collection Volume One – Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle/Shemp Howard (1932-1934), featuring Roscoe’s six sound films with Warner Brothers.\n\nThe Forgotten Films of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, an incredible four-disc set spanning 1913–21.
