        "text": "“Do you know why God withheld the sense of humor from women?” Mrs. Patrick Campbell once replied to a man who suggested her sex had a problem. “That we may love you, instead of laughing at you.”\n\nThe claim that women are humorless is an old canard, as hoary as the world’s oldest profession. As I write, in 2021, there would seem to be enough Tinas, Tigs, and Tiffanys to dispel it. Nevertheless, we must persist in disproving it, I say, and for two reasons. First, because every bias runs deep and this one will endure until the words “good-humored feminist” don’t sound like a punch line. Second, because proving that women are funny— well, what buxom bandwagon could have more fun?\n\nMrs. Campbell, whose talents and wit beguiled George Bernard Shaw (he created Eliza Doolittle for her), defended her sex in one quip to one man, but even if she’d bruited it forth from Hyde Park Corner, it would still have been, like all protests against prejudice, one skirmish in an epic war against human nature: we evolved with a trait called pattern recognition and when it comes to comedy, the clearest pattern is that men dominate the stage.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the idea has become such a stubborn illusion— and let’s admit up front that women shoulder some of the blame. In the early 1900s, the Philadelphia-bred author Minna Thomas Antrim published advice for youngsters. In Don’ts for Boys, she wrote, “Don’t lose heart. Pluck brings luck” and “Cultivate self-confidence.” In Don’ts for Girls, “Don’t oppose or ridicule the opinions of your brothers. Boys and men grow crusty when things go crosswise,” and “Man forgives woman anything save the wit to outwit him”— which means we can be funny, but it’ll cost us.\n\nNB: 2024 update: Before I continue, I want to note that in the past few years, there has been an explosion in female comedy in almost every arena: stand-up, movies, sitcoms, and to a lesser extent, books and essays. What has not changed, in my view, is Mrs. Antrim’s observation. A lot of men have trouble accepting that we’re funny, too. They can enjoy Kate McKinnon or Tracy Ullman (to name but two), but when it’s a witty girl they know, particularly a quick-witted partner, many men still expect the balance to favor him: they expect to win our laughter, but don’t really want reciprocity. Women know this and, like Mrs. Campbell before us, forgive them. But I think it has cost us: if I were to name my ten favorite humorists, only Dorothy Parker would be short-listed.\n\nWith that kind of traditional instruction, no wonder women have hesitated to stand up with a microphone, or pen a parody, let alone take a pie in the face. Comedy was never a garden path for us. Things are improving apace, but as recently as 2016 author Richard Cohen reminded us that even appreciative men think that a comical chick is a rara avis with his portrait of Nora Ephron, She Made Me Laugh. Are witty women really so rare that we deserve a backhanded title like that? I can’t believe that a profile of, say, Carl Reiner, would be titled He Made Me Laugh. It trivializes him.\n\nBut hang on. Consider this: if we’re looking for patterns in human behavior, a much more compelling one is found among men. It’s the very opposite of humorlessness in women, and it has scientific backing: men rarely shed tears. Sure, they blubber when Brian Piccolo croaks, but where’s the emotion otherwise? What’s more, male stoicism is a far more common insult, and a more damaging one, than that women aren’t funny. Men are casually branded as insensitive in girl talk, an insult that can rise to a powerful accusation in marital spats. It’s perpetuated in articles like The Repressed Man, books like All Men Are Jerks Until Proven Otherwise (a terrible market-desperate title for a book with rational advice), and husband jokes like “Men have two emotions, hungry and horny. If you see him without an erection, make him a sandwich.” (A bit of a double-edged insult, that, since it accepts, however wryly, the role of handmaid.)\n\nAccusing men of being callous, however, doesn’t get us very far because they’re mostly happy to admit it, especially if it’ll get them off some emotional hook, or if it’ll get a laugh. Men ‘fessing up to insensitivity is standard fare in sitcoms and movies. Create a randy guy, give him an even randier sidekick or two, then make them selfish, single-minded, and/or generally obtuse (but basically good at heart), and you’ve got Wedding Crashers, American Pie, Knocked Up, Porky’s, Risky Business, Animal House, and The Hangover I, II, III. Etc. On television, comedies since the days of antennae have worked that formula with galoots from Ralph Kramden and Fred Flintstone to Archie Bunker, Sam Malone, Denny Crane, Frank and Ray Barone, Charlie Harper, Vince Moranto, and Howard Wolowitz. In fact, sensitive men, like Robert Barone, Alan Harper, Meathead Stivic, and Raj Koothrapali (there aren’t many), are ridiculed as effeminate. And I can state with infinite confidence, without even fact-checking myself, that the writers wringing laughs out of such fictional boors are mostly men ridiculing their own insensitivity.\n\nUnfeeling men, unfunny women— to varying degrees, both insults come from the inverse of pattern recognition, i.e., false pattern recognition, or apophenia: the tendency to look for meaning when we perceive a pattern. Plenty of animals detect useful patterns, but only humans look at clouds and discern the shapes of camels or weasels or whales. Hermann Rorschach’s inkblot patterns became a psychiatric tool (of dubious merit). Astrologers and numerologists seek patterns in the infinities of stars and numbers. The image of Jesus has been perceived in a tortilla, in toast, and even where He reputedly resides, in the heavens, with a halo of stars or a crown of luminous thorns, depending on whether your chalice is half full or half empty. Maybe the Webb telescope can put that to rest. False patterns in games of chance, the gambler’s fallacy, makes players believe that, e.g., if they toss tails a dozen times in a row, the chances of the next toss being tails have changed from 50:50.\n\nThose kinds of false patterns hurt wallets. Greater damage results from patterns we detect in each other, giving rise to stereotypes that are rarely affirmative and that people seem to relish. It’s hard to think of a group that escapes insult: mobbed-up Italians, hypocritical Brits, amoral atheists, holier-than-thou Christians, greedy Jews, penny-pinching Scots — I could stop, but I don’t want to leave anyone out— dumb blondes, stupid Poles, drunken Irish, drunken Russians, militant Muslims, uptight WASPs, thieving “gypsies,” suspicious Hindus, lawless blacks, ignorant Southerners, fey gays, butch Lesbians, callow teenagers, inscrutable Asians, rude New Yorkers, brash Australians, loopy Southern Californians, nerdy scientists, cheese-eating surrender monkeys (that would be the French), stubborn imperious dour Germans (I stopped at three, but I’m German-American so I know the full litany), unscrupulous lawyers, crooked politicians (oh, wait, those two are true), and fat Americans (make that three). Flattering stereotypes are less common but equally feeble: brainy Asians, rugged Westerners, nice Midwesterners, Latin lovers, African lovers (although…)\n\nStereotypes simplify whole populations, hence their popularity: everybody likes to think they’ve got the world figured out. But they poison society. They are toxic and, worse, they are durable, because of that basic nutrient called the grain of truth: the adjectives aren’t assigned at random.\n\nNobody escapes being stereotyped, starting with gender. If you’re female, you’re unfunny. If you’re male, you’re unfeeling. And if you’re some degree of gender variant, the insults can sink to hate speech. Cross-dressers tend to be typed as gay or transgender, which isn’t insulting per se, but it’s often said hatefully, and it’s wrong. Transvestism is its own phenomenon, familiar to everyone if only through the performing arts— especially in comedy, which is why it’s relevant here.\n\nCross-dressing in theater goes back to the Greeks. Shakespeare, of course, famously used it in Twelfth Night and several other plays. It’s anything but rare in popular entertainment. When Tom Hanks got his start in Bosom Buddies, he was following in the pumps of Jonathan Winters as Maude Frickert, Flip Wilson as Geraldine Jones, and Johnny Carson as Aunt Blabby. Milton Berle may have been the ugliest man in a dress, ever, but the competition is stiff (and heavily British, cross-dressing being a staple of English comedy): Tyler Perry, RuPaul, Barry Humphries, Eddie Izzard, and Monty Python’s whole Flying Circus. It’s at the core of popular movies including I Was a Male War Bride, Charley’s Aunt, Some Like It Hot, La Cage aux Folles and Birdcage, Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Kinky Boots, To Wong Foo, and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\nSwitching closets, women rarely cross-dress. There is Yentl, and Mulan, and Boys Don’t Cry. There’s Tilda Swinton as Orlando. But notice anything? They’re not comedies. Victor/ Victoria was a comic vehicle for Julie Andrews, but most actresses, like Streisand, Swank, and Swinton, find themselves wearing pants in fairly sober movies: Dietrich in Morocco, Garbo in Queen Christina, Katharine Hepburn in Sylvia Scarlett, Glenn Close in Albert Nobbs, Cate Blanchett as Bob Dylan in I’m Not There, and Gwyneth Paltrow grabbing an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love.\n\nNo doubt the list of cross-dressing actresses will grow. Thanks in part to the love that dares to roar its name, the closet has been opened for good and to all. But why so few comedies, ladies? Is passing as a man really such serious business? If so, all the more reason to make fun of it.\n\nWhich made me welcome The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Set in the era of Lenny Bruce, we meet Rachel Brosnahan as the cynical and comical (and implausibly flawless) Midge Maisel. She grabs the mic in comedy clubs and delivers tight fives in stylishly tight dresses– an impossible act to ignore. She’s backed by Susie Myerson, played by Alex Borstein as an upstart theatrical agent who doesn’t actually disguise herself as a man, but certainly dresses and comports like one. It’s not transvestism, but I call it progress: an award-winning series about a female stand-up comic with a butch sidekick.\n\nIf there is one stereotype that is easy to dismiss— the easiest, if you ask me— it is that men lack sensitivity. Men may not typically emote as freely and openly as women, but that doesn’t mean they lack heart. The proof is overwhelming. Think Mozart or Michelangelo and you get the idea. The poetry of Keats and Tennyson, the fiction of García Márquez, the sculptures of Bernini, the paintings of Van Gogh and Basquiat, the voices of Pavarotti and Ray Charles, the films of Ozu and Renoir, the photographs of Sebastião Salgado and Walker Evans, the plays of Sam Shepard, the horn of Clifford Brown.\n\nUnfeeling? It is to laugh. Of course men are emotional creatures. If you have any lingering doubts, have a go at testing any available man: try taking his music away from him, or his sports, or if you’re Usain Bolt, try maligning his family or belittling his manhood. The ensuing emotional response will convince you otherwise, fast.\n\nBut let’s step back for the breath of fresh air that comes with stating the obvious. One simple fact ought to sabotage any notion that women lack humor: to wit, we laugh. Unless we’ve been faking it to please men (who, us?), we have effortlessly been laughing at comedy from Molière and Mark Twain to Nichols & May and The Simpsons.\n\nThe trouble is, women haven’t built a strong reputation for being funny, and the question is, why not? The answer to that cannot boil down to the freakin’ obvious [lack of opportunity], because that’s soapbox territory and we’re escaping from association with boxes of detergent. So maybe it’s just a matter of time. After all, progress has been made, if only from the declarative to the comparative: from women aren’t funny to women aren’t as funny. For no particularly good reason, I like to date the progress back to Nietzsche, who did not discriminate by sex when he noted (wrongly about fauna, but:), “The animal which suffered most on earth discovered for itself — laughter.” Fritz is also useful as a representative of a culture that is a nail in the coffin of the women-aren’t-funny cliché because men aren’t exempted from the stereotype of humorless Germans— A Thousand Years of German Humor being one of the world’s shortest books.\n\nMeanwhile, let’s not forget that comedy is not easy for anyone. Michael Caine once said that it’s “one of the hardest things to do; the more you try to be funny, the less you’re funny.” Still, men have tickled more ribs than we have— and, no question about it, they’ve especially outperformed us in physical comedy. This is not a minor observation. Women rely on wit, repartee, and, increasingly, ribaldry more than on antics, thus losing huge opportunities: slapstick and pratfalls, clowning and pantomime, jugglers and magicians, much of vaudeville and minstrelsy. Men way outnumber us in the arena of physical comedy– the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges, Inspector Clouseau and Monsieur Hulot. How many women have ever slipped on banana peels for laughs?\n\nSilent films achieved true greatness in the realm of physical comedy. Precisely because they were silent, they depended on sight gags and gestures. Buster Keaton once said, “Charlie Chaplin and I would have a friendly contest: Who could do the feature film with the least subtitles?” Concentrating on physical comedy and reducing use of the English language could only have helped build their worldwide popularity, which was considerable— and it was a fraternity. Besides Buster and Charlie (the only two who remain household names), the great silent comedians were called Mack, Harold, Harry, Charley, Ben, Stan, and Roscoe. Name a silent film comedienne. I dare you. Okay, name one besides Mabel or Edna. None were headliners.\n\nSo why aren’t women more represented in physical comedy? Not our forte? It can’t be that simple. After all, we showed our ability to clown in American vaudeville and English music halls (and no doubt elsewhere), and once television sets invaded living rooms, goofy girls went on worldwide display, albeit as a tiny sorority compared to glamour girls. Sexual innuendo abounds in comedy, so it figures that comely actresses are hired to facilitate wolf-whistle humor. The term wolf is passé, but as long as sex sells and women are willing to be cast from the neck down, or worse, that will persist.\n\nBut cultural awakening is ongoing, and the Civil Rights era was a watershed. It coincided with the ascent of television, which had a powerful and growing command of our eyes and ears and, it follows, our minds. Race, religion, sex, politics— television both prompts cultural change and mirrors it, reflecting back at us our progress, or stagnation, on the front lines of change.\n\nConsider late-night talk shows, which court laughter and are a bastion of men. White men. That’s hard to complain about, really, because so many of them have been brilliant: Steve Allen, Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, David Letterman, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O’Brien, Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart. Still, their virtual monopoly is something of a mystery. Joan Rivers had a late-night show for about a year until she was replaced by Arsenio Hall. They had exactly one successor each: Chelsea Handler, and Trevor Noah, who replaced Jon Stewart in 2015.\n\nMind you, there are plenty of talk shows hosted by the plenty of women, but they’re in virtual confinement in what is quaintly called daytime TV, which, being designed for stereotypical housewives, are like coffee klatches. The View, Oprah, The Talk, Rachael Ray, Wendy Williams, Ellen, Rosie, Tyra— the talk is mostly banter, and banter is the field hockey of wordplay.\n\nVariety shows bettered talk shows by a factor of one and her name was Dinah. Against her, we had a Garry, a Perry, a Danny, a Jackie, a Jimmy, a Jonathan, a Dean, a George, a Milton, an Arthur and a Ted, two Reds and an Ed, and a Walt. We also had a Sid, whose groundbreaking variety show might have been dead in the water without its girl, Imogene Coca. She was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Your Show of Shows (winning in 1951), and in 1953, she received a Peabody Award for her “imp-like, contagious, and entirely original humor.” She was good at what she did, and had been doing since she was a child acrobat in vaudeville. More to the point, she was the only woman on Your Show of Shows. Every time a sketch needed a girl, there was Coca, the all-purpose female during the show’s five-year run. But she wasn’t the headliner. That waited for Dinah, in 1956.\n\nDuring its 11+ seasons, The Dinah Shore Show was regularly in the top thirty. It was successful and elegantly done (less so when she went full shill for Chevrolet), and it could be amusing in a field hockey sort of way, but there wasn’t much comedy, and fewer high-jinks. Shore’s passion for golf didn’t, unfortunately, lead to athletic cavorting. How could it, in her wardrobe of gowns and opera gloves?\n\nAfter Dinah went off the air in 1957, a full decade passed before she had a successor— this time an actual comedienne. Carol Burnett annihilated the notion that women can’t be hilarious headliners (“I saw it in the window and I just couldn’t resist it“). Age 34, she emerged from Garry Moore’s wing with a small repertory cast, a stable of guest stars, and a dedication to equal-opportunity buffoonery. Offstage, it was less than equal: of her 50 writers over the years, only five were women.\n\nFour years after Burnett’s debut, an altogether different female emerged, displaying heady talents while shamelessly exposing a body that was all the entertainment most people needed. In spite of shared billing, I insist on adding Cher to this avant-garde of headlining dames because let’s face it, everybody wants to subtract Sonny. Cher was unquestionably the more gifted performer, not only for her inimitable singing style, her (at the time) effortless charisma and exotic beauty. More to the point here, she had instinctive comic timing and a game attitude toward physical shtick.\n\nBut when it comes to comedy on television, variety and talk shows are side dishes. The prime rib is the prime-time sitcom. As a laboratory for looking at comedy, sitcoms were, and to a great extent still are, pretty thoroughly owned by men, especially behind the camera.\n\nThe worst offender when it comes to snubbing women has got to be M*A*S*H. Twenty liberated years later after Sid Caesar, it had exactly one female in the cast, Loretta Swit as Margaret Houlihan, an all-purpose female. She was whatever the script required— arrogant or vulnerable, shrill or seductive, proper but Frank’s mistress— but always emotional and temperamental. You know, like women are. Fickle. She was all but humorless besides, in a comedy. To make matters worse, in the original book as well as the Robert Altman movie, Houlihan was not the only featured nurse: Maria “Lieutenant Dish” Schneider appeared in the TV pilot and in one early episode before she was written out. And, to make matters even worse yet, the only other skirt-wearing series regular was Jamie Farr, Corporal Max Klinger, the pretend transvestite in search of a Section 8.\n\nI’ve long been wanting to vent about Houlihan as an insult to womanhood, because she was. But before someone points out the obvious defense, let me: few of the casting calls for M*A*S*H were for women. Ditto Hogan’s Heroes, McHale’s Navy, Gomer Pyle, F Troop, Car 64, Where are You? Those are all male domains, as were most workplaces back when we believed father knew best. That covers a lot of situations, including, e.g., Amos ‘n Andy and Andy Griffith, Kung Fu and Alias Smith and Jones and westerns in general, The Monkees and Happy Days, WKRP in Cincinnati and Taxi, Night Court and Barney Miller.\n\nBut okay, let’s exempt cops, cowboys, sailors— what the hell, all the Village People and nerds besides, if only for Silicon Valley. Still, men dominate sitcoms, and not all the offending shows fling us back to Beaver, Dobie, and Gilligan. Consider the male:female ratio of regulars on Seinfeld (3:1), Wings (6:2), Frasier (4:2, at least), Arrested Development and NewsRadio (both 6:3), It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (4:1), Cheers and 3rd Rock from the Sun (both 4:2), The Office (5:1), That 70’s Show (4:2), 30 Rock and Murphy Brown (both 5:2), and of course Two and a Half Men (2.5:0), and perhaps especially New Girl (3:Zooey).\n\nEven more egregious, I think, are the straightforward domestic sitcoms, where one would think woman would have a place: Newhart (7:3), Home Improvement (6:2), Black-ish (7:4), and The King of Queens (6:3).\n\nWelcome Back, Kotter (6:1) is particularly irksome. It had no excuse to have only woman in the regular cast (Mrs. Kotter, wife, secretary, substitute teacher, and maker of tuna casseroles) because female students and even teachers existed in Brooklyn in the 1970s. No excuses for Scrubs, either. In spite of the massive accession of female physicians, four of the five featured doctors in at Sacred Heart Hospital were men. Far preferable is Boston Legal, even though it is the leading candidate for the most shamelessly sexist show ever. Writer/creator David E. Kelley threw wrenches into every social issue, including sexism. His scripts weren’t comedies per se but they bubbled with wit and– here’s the point– gave women serious respect while depicting ass-grabbing men as buffoons. Plus, for pure fun, it wallowed in cross-dressing like no other show before or since, notably with James Spader and William Shatner.\n\nBig Bang Theory deserves a call-out, too, for evolving. When the show premiered in 2007, the ratio was 4:1, with Kaley Cuoco as the cute, scantily clad, actress wannabe Penny. By the fourth season, though, the regular cast had two more women, both of them scientists: the hard-nosed chemist Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch) and, the most welcome addition because she is no beauty queen, the brainy neurologist Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik). Big Bang hired its regulars on the basis of talent. It included sex, without which you shelve a lot of comic chemistry, but it wasn’t sexist. (Coda: The show cannot be forgiven, however, for the grotesque finale, presumably meant to be a happy ending, when Penny, drunk, gets pregnant after she and Leonard had declared, in a refreshing reflection of our changing society, that they did not plan to have children.)\n\nMost sitcoms, of course, are pretty careful to hire pretty women. It can be the whole point of the show (Petticoat Junction, Three’s Company), at least part of the point (Friends, Modern Family, Designing Women), or it involves teams of beauticians (a sweet and silly word that I miss). Fortunately, some comic actresses are hired based on aptitude rather than pulchritude, and more than a few sitcoms have taken that road over the years: The Mothers-in-Law, Hazel, Our Miss Brooks, December Bride, Rhoda, Soap, Maude, Mom, and Golden Girls, which bucked tradition by setting four retired women in a Florida ranch house. I also applaud Hot in Cleveland, for featuring women past their youthful prime. It is probably true, though, that the show had a bigger budget for makeup, hair, and costumes than the local tourist board had to glamorize Cleveland.\n\nPretty isn’t a requirement on most working-women shows, either. Good Times, Rhoda, Grace Under Fire, One Day at a Time (70’s iteration), Alice, The Middle, and Roseanne come to mind. Two shows stand out, though, if only because they involved physical buffoonery: Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams romped and roughhoused to an unusual extent for girls in Laverne and Shirley. Decades later, the BBC gave us Absolutely Fabulous, which was almost an auteur effort by Jennifer Saunders. She and Joanna Lumley worked with plenty of rapid-fire dialogue, but also with full-bodied humor to play two aging narcissistic dipsos, Edina a few pounds too heavy, Patsy a blonde model of brinkmanship anorexia. Hairdos were exaggerated, makeup was applied with a trowel, the costumes were unbefitting, and the walk was a stagger, a totter, or a mince. It was vulgar and way over the top, but hard to look away. (The watered-down American version, Cybill, with model-turned-mediocrity Cybill Shepherd, was not even a pale imitation, although Christine Baranski made it watchable.)\n\nFor my money, though, and with a nod to Laugh-In, the really significant breakthrough for women in terms of physical comedy came in 1975 with the debut of Saturday Night Live, a variety show with no headliner(s). Men outnumber women on SNL, and that includes the writing staff and guest hosts (only 5 women are in the 20-member Five-Timers Club, named for people who have hosted at least a handful of times). Although outnumbered, women had a weekly comedy showcase, broadcast live. It was hugely popular, and Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, and Laraine Newman proved ready, willing, and altogether able to go full goofball, performing as homely or ridiculous characters. Apparently, it wasn’t so simple backstage, however. Jane Curtin is on record: “There were a few people that just out-and-out believe that women should not have been there and they believe that women were not innately funny…. [John Belushi] thought Gilda was funny, but she really — he didn’t classify her as a woman. She was Gilda.” Not fair, but it’s easy to see why Radner was singled out: she set a standard with her audacious characters like Lisa Loopner, Emily Litella, Baba Wawa, Roseanne Rosannadanna. Radner seemed to show no hesitation— indeed seemed to relish— her ventures into the exaggerated and the absurd.\n\nWhich brings us back to the cross-dressing closet. One of SNL’s most popular female characters was Dana Carvey’s Church Lady, and he wasn’t the only frocked fellow in the cast. Dan Aykroyd played Julia Child. Tracy Morgan was Maya Angelou. Phil Hartman was Barbara Bush. David Spade was Martha Stewart. Will Ferrell was Janet Reno. Chris Rock was Whoopi Goldberg. I wouldn’t bother pointing these out, except for a rather wonderful recent development on SNL: the really popular cross-dressing skits these days, the ones that go viral, tend to be women in drag, notably Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer, and, even more notably, the multi-talented Kate McKinnon mimicking any number of famous men who deserve a hearty dose of emasculation, including Jeff Sessions, Julian Assange, Lindsay Graham, and Rudy Giuliani. Meanwhile, Tracy Ullman is taking impersonations to a whole new level mostly caricaturing women (now that there enough prominent women to ridicule).\n\nThat’s progress. Up to a point. Most women do still seem to prefer using their bodies as canvases for beauty rather than a caricature. That may have something to do with the fact that it’s easier to be made to look ridiculous as a woman, what with the curls and the ruffles and the bows. Men have simpler wardrobes, to say the least. And men are recognizably themselves before and after make-up. That’s not true of a lot of women.\n\nIt’s actually gotten worse, in a way, from the days of aging gracefully when we were amused by Gracie Allen and Eve Arden in black and white. They were followed by Doris Day and Mary Tyler Moore, Rita Rudner and Kathy Griffith, Candice Bergen and Jenna Elfman, Fran Drescher and Suzanne Somers– all women who were ultra ready for their close-up, fastidiously dyed and coiffed, lipsticked and pancaked, and tightly put together if not actually nipped, tucked, and Botoxed. The same remains true today. Naturalistic isn’t a word that comes to mind watching comic actresses including Amy Sedaris, Allison Janney and Anna Ferris, Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs, Bebe Neuwirth, Desi Lydic, Samantha Bee, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Julie Bowen, or even young Sarah Hyland.\n\nBecause male comedians are, and always have been, much more inclined to sacrifice vanity on the altar of laughter, vanity amounts to a handicap. After all, this much is axiomatic: being unwilling to appear laughable is an impediment to getting laughs. You’re reduced to verbal humor, which is a large arena, but it’s still a reduction.\n\nThe first thing a performer needs to act absurdly, of course, is an absurd role, and dumb and dumber guys seriously outnumber girls. In fact, even with more women venturing into comedy, girls are still being fed roles as husband hunters, princesses, made-over ugly ducklings, and combinations thereof. Ducklings feature in (to name a few, and going back) Funny Face, Sabrina (1954 and 1997), Breakfast Club, Working Girl, Maid in Manhattan, Grease, Moonstruck, Pretty Woman, The Devil Wears Prada, Miss Congeniality, Clueless, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, The Princess Diaries, and, of course, My Fair Lady. The related genre of rags-to-riches girls is robust, too, even if you just count the original if-the-shoe-fits housemaid herself, Cinderella in (among others) A Cinderella Story, Another Cinderella Story, Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale, Ella Enchanted, and, of course, Cinderella (Brandy, 1997), Cinderella (Disney 1950), and Cinderella (Lily James, 2015).\n\nEqually disappointing, if not more so, are gender-flips: movies rewritten for women, as if we have to imitate men to be funny. Few are as successful as His Girl Friday, the 1940 flip of and improvement on The Front Page. Other flips range from middling to disastrous: The Incredible Shrinking Woman, The Next Karate Kid, Herbie Fully Loaded, Ocean’s 8, Ghostbusters, After the Wedding, American Psycho II, The Hustle, and What Men Want. But the father of all flips has to be The Hangover, a blockbuster that spawned two sequels and sired a few flips, including Girls Trip, Rough Night, and the very successful Bridesmaids, in which Melissa McCarthy almost cross-dresses but still ends up in hot pink and pearls. Needless to say, reverse gender flips are less common, although Jerry Lewis did perpetrate Cinderfella, which scored with audiences, if not critics.\n\nSo why aren’t there more three-dimensional comic roles for women? Good question, because they tend to do well at the box office. To date, the three highest-grossing female comedies are built around characters who have considerably more depth than the formulaic gold-digging husband-hunter. Take note, though: none of the three are recent. Both 9 to 5 and Private Benjamin are from 1980, and Sister Act is from in 1992. As I write, that’s almost 27 years ago. Betty White was only 70.\n\nWe seem to have regressed since Whoopi donned a wimple, and I lay much of the blame at two doorsteps:\n\nFirst, a hit show that qualifies as a comedy because it cannot be taken seriously: Sex and the City. An unabashed tribute to materialism, it glorified women who were in search of wealth, never mind morality, and sex, never mind love. The few times I caught bits of it, nothing made me laugh, or even smile, but it spawned two movies, so maybe it’s me.\n\nSecond, a female director whose romcoms suck the cause of womanhood back toward Busby Berkeley’s Gold Diggers of 1933, wherein Ginger Rogers sings “We’re in the Money” and wears nothing but. I refer to the stereotype-promoting, formula-adhering-to propagandist for the aging woman, Nancy Meyers. Her movies are also unabashed tributes to materialism, none worse than the one featuring Meryl Streep’s plunge toward the second-rate, It’s Complicated. It’s disappointing, is what it is. Disappointing in the extreme because Meyers, early in her career, was the person who originally pitched Private Benjamin to Goldie Hawn. No dumb blonde Goldie, the artist in her saw the possibilities and fought the uphill battle to produce the movie: “In the beginning, they [the studio executives] would pat me on the head. To them, I was still the cute little Goldie. But the minute I stood up and had something to say, I became the bitch.” Nevertheless, she persisted, and the buxom bandwagon rolls on.\n\nTo a distressingly large extent, women like Nancy Meyers do still seem content to practice and even prize comedy that exploits our most shallow stereotype: the single girl with “rich husband” topping her shopping list. The formula is as foolproof as a movie recipe can be. It was popularized by Anita Loos with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, immortalized by Carol Channing and Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire. Poor-girl-gets-rich-guy is a shooting-fish-in-a-barrel approach to comedy, and everyone in Hollywood seems to have a gun. Men stereotype themselves, too, but it’s the conquest they want, not the cash. Like Alvy Singer yearning for Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), the typical comic hero tends to be hapless and lovelorn (or horny, depending on how much Judd Apatow is attached), a man with but one item on his shopping list: girl, preferably hot, frequently Cameron Diaz.\n\nAnd so, with a sigh, one wishes Goldie Hawn had inspired more successors with Private Benjamin, which was the reverse of the ugly-duckling, husband-hunting materialist, and was freshly funny besides. But, no. Even now, in the 21st Century, we get more diaries from princesses than from girls like Bridget Jones.\n\nMaybe women just aren’t playful enough. Seriously. Katharine Hepburn had balls, mainly golf and tennis, but not many other athletic or even nimble lady performers come to mind. I liked Peter Jackson’s King Kong for one particular reason: the way the Ann Darrow was written. She’s a vaudevillian, which is why she has to take the job to film on faraway, fearsome Skull Island: it’s 1933, vaudeville is dying, and she’s going broke. In other words, she’s one the last of her breed. And when she meets Kong, the very last of his breed, she communicates through comic antics— juggling and dancing and cartwheels. He responds playfully, knocking her about, laughing at her pratfalls. Humor connects them. It’s a lovely sequence, with two different species and both sexes represented, Naomi Watts in Fay Wray’s role, and, as Kong, Andy Serkis, or as I think of him in his motion-capture roles, Andy Circuits.\n\nSo Kong had a sense of humor. It’s one of the so-called psychogenic senses, an ill-defined term. We all have, to varying degrees, senses of duty, of decency, of security, of belonging, of loyalty, of fairness, and so on. Some give rise to physical displays. Our sense of shame can cause blushing, for instance. But the biggie is our sense of humor, which produces laughter, even tears of joy, and releases the waves of endorphins on which pleasure and calmness surf. So, even though it isn’t one of the five senses that enhance our chances of surviving, humor helps us survive with smiles on our faces, whether those faces can grow beards or not.\n\nAs a thought experiment, suppose that (a) you’re born with six senses, including humor, but (b) when you reach majority, you must lose one sense, of your own choosing. Which would you forgo forever? Sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell, or humor? Tough choice, but for my part, and I’m a putatively unfunny female, I’d abandon taste or smell before humor.\n\nWhich means that humor is a sense I not only claim but hold singularly dear.\n\nAnd no wonder. It is essential in relationships, up there with integrity, civility, empathy, and, among my friends, a tendency to pick up the check. Its qualities are legion, starting with the fact that laughter is a universal balm, or maybe I mean lubricant. “It’s almost impossible to maintain any kind of distance or any sense of social hierarchy when you’re just howling with laughter. Laughter is a force for democracy,” said John Cleese.\n\nI could give the last word on this subject to Shakespeare, who assigned the question “if you tickle us, do we not laugh?” to a particular Venetian merchant. Laughter knows no color, religion, or sex. It is species-wide.\n\nThere are, of course, academic studies on these things because nothing can stop a professor in search of a grant. In early 2020, a Google search for humor sex differences yielded 16.8 million results (emotion sex differences got 42.7 million). Even allowing for redundancy, that’s a lot. As for the conclusions: in general, with minor neurological differences, both women and men have senses of humor. Unfortunately, the studies don’t compare people as comedians. Controlled experiments measured responses to jokes and cartoons, but impromptu wit, by its very nature, would not be easy to analyze through controlled experimentation.\n\n“I don’t like any female comedians,” Jerry Lewis once said, flatly, fatuously, and famously. When pressed, and he was hard-pressed, he got industrial-strength specific: “A woman doing comedy doesn’t offend me but sets me back a bit. I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the world.”\n\nLewis was extreme, but we don’t need to hark back to the erstwhile King of Comedy to see that myths die hard. We have serious people, people with brains and publishers, who perpetuate this languishing opinion about women. Most notoriously, it was wheeled out of the ICU and into the glare of the media in 2007 when Vanity Fair issued a foursquare attack on the fair sex. The essay was a specious and lengthy broadside, and, ultimately, a suicidal one since it led to a half-assed retraction.\n\nIt got noticed, and no wonder. Manhood could hardly have found a more gifted, wily, or shameless spokesman.\n\nWhy Women Aren’t Funny was the dogmatic title, and Christopher Hitchens was the doghouse-bound writer. Too clever by half was the rap on Hitch, who was a career provocateur with a brilliant mind and a limited sense of decency (my nominee if humans had seven senses). He was also a sought-after raconteur because his talents included a lightning-quick wit which only failed him on the rare occasions when he hurled a bolt before soberly aiming it with rational proofs. Loose bolts can be unavoidable in speech, but never in writing, which is why his notorious polemic deserved to be taken to task, and it was. Full-throated rebuttals came from both sexes, especially women, including me, as someone who knows a fair amount about laughter, having frequently been, one way or another, the cause of it.\n\nHis retraction following the outrage (his word) appeared the following year: Why Women Still Don’t Get It (VF, April 2008). It opens with two paragraphs about several “brilliant and witty young female journalists” with “divine breasts,” and concludes with “I forgive you for being so slow to see my little joke because—ah well, just because.” Just because… women lack humor, which is of course not what he was saying all along, he says. In short, “Can’t you take a joke?” It’s wanker stuff.\n\nHis article had no shortage of wily tactics and clever quips, and was as easy to digest as pablum. But even if he was just kidding, his point is too contrived to amuse anyone capable of reading without moving their lips. In short, it’s Hitchens who doesn’t get it: he bombed. He was in the company of Roseanne grabbing her crotch and spitting after howling the national anthem, Don Imus invoking “nappy-headed hos” (he apologized), and Michael Richards shouting, “Throw his ass out, he’s a nigger” (ditto).\n\nAs a wordsmith, Hitchens was crafty at the witchcraft level, and he was fearless. Anybody who can attack Mother Teresa in an essay entitled The Missionary Position does not lack brass. (NB: He wasn’t the only critic to give Saint Teresa of Calcutta the hard look that all saints and putative saints deserve, and he called her out for actions as well as intolerable remarks such as “Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.” But Hitchens alone stooped to calling her a “lying, thieving Albanian dwarf.”)\n\nSo he was courageous and crafty; more to the point, he could also be lazy, letting his genius lapse into glibness. That, I think, is what happened with this essay. There was no proximate cause for declaring that women don’t make him laugh, unless, perhaps, he’d seen Scarlett Johanssen in The Nanny Diaries that summer and became enraged. Unlikely. He was a Vanity Fair staff writer who needed to fill column inches for a January issue. Why not spew out 2,500 words before the deadline interfered with seasonal cheer? That would explain the lack of intellectual rigor as well as the trifling subject.\n\nBecause of the article’s notoriety, it is a prime candidate for autopsy, so let’s cut into it using Hitchens’s own favorite dissection tool: reason. If you step back and really examine his logic, it’s not just flawed, it’s fallacious (inductive reasoning being the fallacy), and his conclusion is appalling: that half of our species is functionally handicapped when it comes to one of the most enjoyable, appealing, beneficial, and unique facets of human nature: the use of humor.\n\n“Please do not pretend not to know what I am talking about,” he went on, doubling his negatives and smacking his lips in anticipation of kneejerk reactions. Pretend? The pretense is all his. Everyone knows what he’s talking about, and plenty of people agree or at least acknowledge the grain of truth at the core of the stereotypes. In fact, one of my favorite female humorists, Sandi Toksvig, said, “I’ve heard that women aren’t funny and I think there’s a truth in this. I think that there is a scientific, possibly, relationship between a sense of humour and the male sex organ.” Maybe she was serious, maybe she was kidding, (maybe she regrets such lay speculation about male genitalia), but at least one person took it as a reference to visual humor: “People are always laughing at mine,” replied Alan Davies.\n\nThe vexing thing about the cliché is that a corollary, “Men excel at comedy,” is impossible to dismiss, and not easy to refute. But, carefully sidestepping the soapbox, I would contend that if men are funnier, it may be because getting people to laugh at your antics or your wit takes courage and confidence, qualities we have nurtured more in our sons than our daughters.\n\nOne survey, in Rolling Stone, asked 14 humorists (10 men and 4 women) who their mentors or idols were. Altogether, they named 19 men and 3 women: Lucille Ball was cited by Pee Wee Herman, Lily Tomlin was fingered by Kathy Najimy, and Garry Marshall credited his mother, Marjorie. The disparity is not remotely a surprise. If I were to name the humorist who has given me the most pleasure, I would be hard pressed to displace Buster Keaton, S. J. Perelman, or David Mitchell, not even with Dorothy Parker or Elaine May (you will have other heroines).\n\nIt would be partisan in the extreme to stack an all-joker deck with females. What’s funny may be relative, but laughter is an absolute measure and, simple fact, men are responsible for the lion’s share of our laugh track.\n\nHow many women have contributed? Not many. Yet. Obviously. Females are just getting started on the public stage. America’s earliest successful solo female comedian was almost certainly Moms Mabley, who was my grandmother’s contemporary, born circa 1894 in North Carolina. Mabley— who has yet to get the full biography she deserves, let alone the respect, though Whoopi Goldberg did a documentary about her— was so far ahead of our curvaceous crowd that her peers didn’t arrive until the 1950s, when Belle Barth, Jean Carroll, Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers, and Betty Walker stood up. Mabley worked the Chitlin’ Circuit, and as far as I can tell she was the only woman performer who wasn’t a singer, though she began as one, with Butterbeans and Susie. Being black, she gained fame regionally and in Harlem, but didn’t attract mainstream audiences until the civil rights era of the 1960s. In the history of humor, that’s last week. And progress has been sluggish: in 2019, Forbes’ list of the ten wealthiest comedians included only one woman, Amy Schumer, at No. 7. Not a name I’m proud to cite because I prefer wit to irreverent idiocy (her words), but one is better than zero. And she’s not the only measure of progress. Five of the top ten are not white men: Kevin Hart at No. 1, Trevor Noah (No. 5), Gabriel Iglesias (No. 6), and Aziz Ansari (No. 10).\n\nBecause women laugh, Hitchens couldn’t claim that we lack humor completely. In fact, in a full 180, he not only admits that we get jokes, he puts our ability to be amused on the highest possible altar, declaring it crucial to mankind’s very survival. (We’ll get specific about that odd argument later, with a nod to the champion breeder among all mammals). Girls belong in the audience, he allows, but we don’t have the comic chops to be on stage— or, rather, most women don’t. In a blunt comic triple, he reveals where we can find such hen’s teeth: among women who are “hefty or dykey or Jewish, or some combo of the three.” Cunning, no? Hefty (insult), dykey (insult), Jewish (no offense).\n\nLet’s take him seriously, shall we? After all, there is a substantial roster of— oh, let’s call them HefDyJewgirls. Trouble is, there is also a substantial list of girl comedians who are (4) None of the Above. Among them, and a good place to start, is frock-flaunting, size-normal, Methodist-turned-atheist Phyllis Diller, whose go-to shtick was her lack of beauty, as in “I have so many liver spots, I ought to come with a side of onions.” And Diller is hardly alone: Carole Lombard, Martha Raye, Lily Tomlin, Anne Meara, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Tina Fey, Jessica Williams, Kate McKinnon, Victoria Coren Mitchell, Shelley Long, Ellen DeGeneres, etc., etc.— this rebuttal threatens to become host to a host of etceteras.\n\nThere’s an even cockier flaw in his thesis. Replace “dykey” with what it implies— masculine traits— and stand back for the stampede of men who are hefty and/or Jewish. By the way, feel free to skim or skip the list that fills this paragraph; it’s disarmingly long because that’s the whole point of a depo dump: Woody Allen, Morey Amsterdam, Louie Anderson, Judd Apatow, Fatty Arbuckle, John Belushi, Milton Berle, Jack Black, Lewis Black, Mel Brooks, Lenny Bruce, Red Buttons, Sid Caesar, Godfrey Cambridge, John Candy, James Coco, Lou Costello, Billy Crystal, Rodney Dangerfield, Larry David, Dom Deluise, Chris Farley, W.

No one wonders why more comedians look like Jimmy Durante or Whoopi Goldberg than like Lauren Bacall or Johnny Depp. Moms Mabley, who was not only black and homely but also gay, found her niche in comedy, where she eschewed vanity and became a toothless frump in a floral house dress. With humor, unattractive or unpopular people can convert callous ridicule into appreciative laughter, an alchemy that requires comic skills like wit and timing and agility and confidence— none of which, again, have especially been valued in our daughters.\n\nWhich brings us to the crux of Hitchens’s entire argument, a declaration where he spins sophistry into fool’s gold: “Those who risk agony and death to bring children into this fiasco simply can’t afford to be too frivolous.”\n\nIf he had been less artful— like Jerry Lewis, whose fatuous opinion was as plain as the nose on Fanny Brice‘s face — his column would have been titled Why Mothers Aren’t Funny. Then he could have duked it out with any matron with a pen or a mike. Or I could have introduced him to either of my sisters, both of whom were cracking jokes before they left the maternity wards.\n\nHis overall error, again, is in limiting his thesis. Last time it was HefDyJews can be funny; this time its women who give birth “can’t afford to be.” Besides my blood pressure, this raises a paradox that he didn’t address and no doubt hoped would go unnoticed, even though it’s so obviously wrong that it can be refuted with one word: Roseanne. She’s a hefty, butch, Jewish comedienne with five children.\n\nBut let’s not put all our eggs in one deplorable basket. Fanny Brice was also a mother. Ditto Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alex Borstein, Totie Fields, Maya Rudolph and Tina Fey… but, please, this needs no depo dump. Many comediennes are mothers. If Hitchens is correct, how can that be? He could at least have provided a Venn diagram with his data— oh, right. There is no data.\n\nPerhaps there’s a comic chromosome that’s dominant only among lesbians, Jewesses, and/or carriers of the “fat” gene. But then how to explain Diller, Burnett, Meara, et. al., and especially Lucille Ball. CBS allowed I Love Lucy to incorporate her second pregnancy (minus use of that word) into the show, including the arrival of Little Ricky, with truly phenomenal success. According to Wikipedia, “The episode ‘Lucy Goes to the Hospital,’ which first aired on Monday, January 19, 1953, garnered a record 71.7 rating, meaning 71.7% of all households with television sets at the time were tuned in to view the program.”\n\nHow can Lucy, etc., afford to be funny? Do they hire male ghostwriters to feed them punchlines? Not plausible: they tend to be quick-witted in extemporaneous speech, too— interviews, quiz shows, talk shows. Maybe they plagiarize male comedians en masse? No, there’d be lawsuits en masse. If Hitchens heeded his own axiom, he would dismiss his theory the same way he asserted it: without evidence.\n\nThen there’s this: childbearing or not, females are fertile for only about half of their lives. Does that mean we can be funny in the years before menarche and after menopause? A bloody stupid question, I know, but he’s driven me to it by stumbling around the maternity ward with that grim declaration, which deserves reiteration: “Those who risk agony and death to bring children into this fiasco simply can’t afford to be too frivolous.”\n\nDissecting that sentence is a time-consuming but worthy endeavor because of how much he managed to get wrong in only 19 words. So, knives out.\n\nFirst, agony is not a risk in childbirth, sir, it’s a guarantee, at least until the epidural. As for death, death is a risk when you get in a car. Hitchens may have been astonished to learn that there exist soccer moms who can crack a smile.\n\nSecond, “bring children into this fiasco.” Irony alert for that humorless conclusion. Also, fallacy alert. Fiasco means “a complete and ignominious failure.” The world we inherited and now keep, however poorly, is a “complete and ignominious failure”? That is disputable, i.e., not a fact in evidence, yet he bases his conclusion on it. In logic, that fallacy is known as begging the question. In life, it’s called a snow job, and it earns him no rhyming pleasures.\n\nThird (and a doozy), “simply can’t afford” suggests that childbearing women may be capable of jest, but they’re miserly about it because, well— um— maybe— I don’t know— because you can’t combine laughter and Lamaze? because laughter isn’t appropriate while raising children in a world of climate change, xenophobia, corruption, and wars? I defer to a parent of seven children, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.: “I saw the destruction of Dresden. I saw the city before and then came out of an air-raid shelter and saw it afterward, and certainly one response was laughter. God knows, that’s the soul seeking some relief.” I trust Hitchens wouldn’t have doubled down on the grounds that women don’t have souls.\n\nFourth, his most glaring and careless flaw: frivolous. If a woman dismissed laughter as frivolous, Hitchens would have used it as evidence of a lack of humor.\n\nHe’s sounding an awful lot like the wealthy total idiot, Jerry Lewis. But, okay, frivolous. The first definition in the Oxford English Dictionary is “of little or no value or importance.” Does anyone think that describes humor? Anyone at all? I think not, and I’m in good company when I recognize the value of humor: “Nothing is worth more than laughter,” said Frida Kahlo. “It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light.” Speaking about her blue-eyed husband, Joanne Woodward said, “Sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades, but to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day, ah, now that is a treat.” From W. H. Auden, this wonderful observation, “Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can; all of them make me laugh.”\n\nAnother synonym for frivolous: “silly.” So, if pregnancy is even a possibility, a woman can’t afford to be silly? Late trimester pratfalls are a bad idea, granted, but what’s a gravid girl to do on Halloween?\n\nIt’s Hitchens’ own argument that’s frivolous, of course. It’s also self-negating. He cannot seriously contend that humor is, by definition, frivolous because he’d be attacking his own writing style, which uses mockery, satire, and wit on serious issues.\n\nBenefit of the doubt here: Perhaps he is implying that child-rearing + fiasco = not funny, i.e., that the issue belongs in the only really substantive debate about comedy: should certain subjects be off-limits? But then why do men get to joke about parenthood? It’s a popular topic with comedians. Among many, here are jokes from Kevin Hart, “I didn’t know you could get mad at kids to the point where you want to fight. Kids are assholes. My daughter is an asshole. We argue — she can’t even talk”; and Jon Stewart, “Fatherhood is great, because you can ruin someone from scratch.” Conclusion: if it’s not off-limits for fathers, it’s not off-limits for mothers.\n\nAnd so we come to that smooth operator, that rare rabbit who doesn’t breed like one, Bugs Bunny, a perennial bachelor, sybaritic and sardonic, lazy yet indefatigable, an echt-male and my choice as the standard-bearer for the next big argument from Hitchens. Having told us why he believes women— mothers— you decide— can’t be funny, he drops the other shoe and tells us why men have to be. It is, again, biological and, again, fallacious: “The chief task in life that a man has to perform is that of impressing the opposite sex, and Mother Nature (as we laughingly call her) is not so kind to men. In fact, she equips many fellows with very little armament for the struggle. An average man has just one, outside chance: he had better be able to make the lady laugh.”\n\nThere is truth in this, as a pithy English proverb attests: “A maid who laughs is half taken.” But Hitchens ups the ante with words like task and perform and life– he’s not talking about pleasure, he’s talking about procreation.\n\nThe sentence is a masterpiece of implication. But he does not get to dismiss humor as frivolous, then proceed to declare it man’s one, outside chance to succeed. At what, by the way? Getting hitched, Hitch? If he’s not implying marriage with the opposite sex, then he’s saying men are programmed to impress (substitute “impregnate” for clarity) every amused female they can get their appendages on, and in. And if he is implying marriage, then he’s saying a man needs to impress a woman enough to not only mate with her, but to make her his mate, chief task-wise.\n\nFurthermore, and this is not a minor point (shaking my fist here), he is also implying that gay men aren’t funny since impressing the same sex is not a path toward reproducing.\n\nHitchens had the kind of brain that could tackle a Gordian knot, but he laced himself into one here by inadvertently inverting his own thesis: “dykey” women are funny but gay men aren’t? A short depo dump would include Stephen Fry, David Sedaris, David Hyde Pierce, Alan Cumming, Jim Parsons, Paul Lynde, Nathan Lane, Harvey Fierstein, Sean Hayes, and don’t get me started on the British. Okay, just one: Julian Clary for “I didn’t think of myself as a tart, but I wouldn’t argue with anyone who did.”\n\nWhy Women Aren’t Funny also sets a trap, or at least it attempts to. Women who took his 2007 essay seriously, says the wily Hitchens in his 2008 rebuttal, are thus proved guilty of being humorless. So he comes to his own defense by actually undermining his original argument, dismissing it now as drollery— he was merely teasing us, you know, as men tend to. He’s also ignoring the fact that plenty of men took exception to his thesis, too. Evidently, no one who disagreed with him can take a joke.\n\nNice try. Even if the original insults were rather cavalier, he cannot now say “Just kidding” about a chauvinistic piece of bombast that is, by the way, entirely typical of the patronizing way many men banter with and about women. When Hitchens does give quarter to females on the subject of humor, it is only to standardize them as hefty, dykey, or Jewish. The insults add up.\n\nEven when I try to give the devilish Hitchens his due, I find duplicity. He’s right that humor is useful in getting laid, for instance, but the goal of seduction is reproduction? Well, no wonder men dislike condoms. Another mystery solved!\n\nThe fact that men think about sex every waking hour (some would say minute) may well add the fuels of desperation and frustration to their comic ability, but they certainly do not all want to become fathers as often as possible, Mormons and Feodor Vassilyev (father of 87) notwithstanding.\n\nDick Gregory said, “Once I realized the value of making people laugh, I got very good at it. Fast.” Needless to say (or anyway it should be needless), that applies to everybody, male or not, black or not. Doris Roberts had a 65-year career, primarily as a comedienne, that began like this: “When I was in kindergarten, I had a line in a little play, and the line was, ‘I am Patrick Potato, and this is my cousin, Mrs. Tomato.’ I heard laughter, and that’s when the acting bug bit me.” Carol Channing said, “Laughter is much more important than applause. Applause is almost a duty. Laughter is a reward.”\n\nSo, yes, of freakin’ course, everybody enjoys getting laughs, and women are gaining ground. Research junkie that I am, I tried to quantify how much. Confining myself to English-language humor, I turned reluctantly to Andy Borowitz, a humorist and sometime contributor to The New Yorker. He passes as an authority in a subject without any, if only because, in 2011, he published The 50 Funniest American Writers. It was a best-seller and not a simple list of names. It contains samples of writing by 50 humorists, and it seemed like a reasonably good and recent place to look for evidence.\n\nLike Hitchens, Borowitz admits that he cultivated comedy for one reason, “to charm women.” His list is, of course, dominated by men, a few of whom had no doubt also discovered the gratifying link between humor and hormones. Borowitz begins grandly with “A Presidential Candidate,” by Mark Twain, who has been called the father of American humor whenever the pointless question of its paternity arises. (Incidentally, I did a Google search for “mother of American humor,” and came up with things like an article in Mother Earth News about the history of humor and Nine Hilarious Parent Comedians at mom.me. So nominations are open, but it’s going to be hard to top Moms Mabley.)\n\nBorowitz did pitchfork a handful of women writers into his towering haystack of men (Table of Contents here). Of the 50 entries, 39 are by men, two are from magazines (The Onion and National Lampoon), and the remaining nine are from nine women: Anita Loos (1889-1981), Dorothy Parker (1893-1967), Veronica Geng (1941-1997), Nora Ephron (1941-2012), Molly Ivins (1944-2007), Fran Lebowitz, Susan Orlean, Wanda Sykes, and Jenny Allen.\n\nI can’t help but question several choices: Sykes because she’s primarily a performer, not a writer; Jenny Allen because I never heard of her (turns out she’s a mommy blogger); and especially Susan Orlean, whose Wikipedia entry mentions neither “humor” nor “comedy.” Meanwhile, what about the classic Helen Lawrenson article, “Latins Are Lousy Lovers”? Erma Bombeck is deserving if only for her book entitled “When You Look like Your passport, It’s Time to Go Home.” Where’s Mary Roach, perhaps as an honorable mention, for “You do not question an author who appears on the title page as “T.V.N. Persaud, M.D., Ph.D. D., D.Sc., F.R.C.Path. (Lond.), F.F.Path. (R.C.P.I.), F.A.C.O.G.” in Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.\n\nBorowitz stopped at 50, but even if he’d gone to 100, I doubt the proportion would have changed much without stacking the deck with stacked authors. And his list is about written comedy; what about performance? Comedy is big business, with a big community of players. As of early 2020, Wikipedia listed 1,177 professional male comedians and 612 female. By that measure, more than one third of all professional comics are women by now, which is certainly evidence against Hitchens’ thesis. He’s not around to capitulate, but then he wouldn’t anyway, would he? The closest Hitchens ever came to capitulation was recapitulation.\n\nIf we start digging deeper for comic women performers, we find ourselves behind the camera, where scores of Sallys write for television. Rose Marie was a source of inspiration and motivation for me as a kid in rural Wisconsin. But Sally’s sorority was and still is swamped by hundreds if not thousands of Robs and Buddys. Picture, if you will, any of the seven times that Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show won an Emmy for outstanding comedy writing. The stage swarmed with suits. Ditto when the award was won by Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Colbert Report, and indeed every winner back to 1956, when the Best Comedy Writing category was introduced. The inaugural winners were four men from The George Gobel Show, and among the multitude of staff writers named as nominees, only one was a woman: Madelyn Pugh, for I Love Lucy.\n\nReturn to women who fare better in front of the camera than behind it and disappointment awaits. They tend to be glamour girls, not many of whom are primarily comediennes, though I can think immediately of four who were both: Carole Lombard, Jean Harlow, Goldie Hawn, and Sofia Vergara, who fuses Lucy’s timing with Ricky’s temperament and is as voluptuous as any comedienne I can think of.\n\nA great many other beautiful and accomplished actresses have comedy in their repertoire, but they could not be said to be gifted comediennes: Audrey Hepburn, Gene Tierney, Marilyn Monroe, Lupe Velez, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, Joan Collins, Ingrid Bergman, Julia Roberts, Joan Crawford, Tuesday Weld, Rachel McAdams. And most comedic actresses are decidedly not beauty contest material, nor are many of them leading ladies: Zasu Pitts, Una Merkel, Eve Arden, Thelma Ritter, Nanette Fabray, Ann Sothern, Kathy Bates, Madeline Kahn. Etc.\n\nThe upshot, yet again, is that women have long been outnumbered by men in films and television (and probably theater, though I’m not the person to ask), and it will take more time to adjust the balance toward a less stilted reflection of their separate talents. When I first started researching this, I searched for “movie comedies” and found 100 Greatest Comedic Actors/Actresses, which included only eight women, and only two in the first fifty: Lucille Ball at 21, and Carol Burnett at 38. Since then, good news, the site has split the category in two, Actors and Actresses, each with 100, but the latter is dubious to say the least, with Melanie Griffith listed ahead of Tracy Ullman, Geena Davis ahead of Marilyn Monroe, Phyllis Diller ahead of Mabel Normand, and the comedic force of nature that is Joan Cusack listed after all 99 others. Subdivision has not yet happened on a similar list, the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comedians, which (as of early 2020) also had only 8 women listed, and only three in the top 50: Joan Rivers at 28, Sarah Silverman at 38, and Phyllis Diller at 46.\n\nAnother list, 100 Greatest Comedy Movies, has actors outnumbering actresses at about six to one, and— get this— four of its Top 10 have casts that are so heavily male that they had zero significant female characters: Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Dr. Strangelove,Animal House, and The Odd Couple. The six that do feature actresses to one degree or another are A Night at the Opera and Duck Soup (Margaret Dumont, who was not the dupe history has made her), Some Like It Hot (Marilyn Monroe), Airplane! (Julie Hagerty), Blazing Saddles (Madeline Khan), and What’s Up, Doc? (Barbra Streisand, who was a co-star).\n\nThere is, of course, a logical objection to the title “Why Women Aren’t Funny”: it’s called begging the question, where the premise and the conclusion are the same. A logical headline, and more demanding article, might be titled “Why There Aren’t More Funny Women.” If he’d written that essay, he wouldn’t have brought on the wrath of the rational, but perhaps it would have been too easy because the simplest answer is the same as the answer to “Why aren’t there more women physicists? cops? architects?” The Neolithic Revolution consigned us to the kitchen and nursery. “Why there aren’t more men who are housekeepers? secretaries? nurses?” Men and women were steered along decidedly different paths. Comedy was just one of them.\n\nThere’s also the monumental matter of competition. Françoise Sagan once observed that nothing brings on jealousy like laughter. Who doesn’t know the feeling of having someone try to undermine your joke, or go stone-faced, or just stroll away because we’re getting laughs and they’re not? Or, worse, witnessing a friend steal your line and harvest your laugh. We all want to bask in the laughs we inspire.\n\nWhile digging into the claim that women aren’t as funny as men, I dusted off a rather serious tome, The Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations. As expected, men vastly outnumber women in it, but pattern recognition came in handy— a pattern that recurs in every similar source I perused. Here are a few bon mots from the second sex:\n\nTell him I was too fucking busy, or vice versa. —Dorothy Parker\n\nI have my standards. They’re low, but I have them. —Bette Midler\n\nGood sex is like good bridge. If you don’t have a good partner, you’d better have a good hand. —Mae West\n\nWith the newspaper strike on, I wouldn’t consider dying. —Bette Davis\n\nThe less I behave like Whistler’s Mother the night before, the more I look like her in the morning. —Tallulah Bankhead\n\nI’m not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I’m not dumb. I’m also not blonde. —Dolly Parton\n\nIf you can’t say something good about someone, sit right here by me. —Alice Longworth Roosevelt\n\nThe pattern? Every one of those remarks was said in conversation. Women never lacked wit, or humor, or acuity. Until now, we lacked forums. (New editions of humor anthologies are obliged to correct that, if only to include Jo Brand for “Laughter is the best medicine though it tends not to work in the case of impotence.” When welcome to speak, our remarks have quality, which was always the issue. Not quantity.\n\nTina Fey once said, “I know for sure that you can tell how smart people are by what they laugh at.” Hitchens agrees, linking humor directly to intelligence (and unwittingly echoing Mrs. Antrim’s 1902 manual), when he writes, “Wit, after all, is the unfailing symptom of intelligence (and many women believe, or were taught by their mothers, that they become threatening to men if they appear too bright).”The use of parentheses is a telling way to distance himself from the clause that cuts to the bone. But he goes on, bless his unflinching soul, to admit that, therefore, “ it could be that in some way men do not want women to be funny.”\n\nIt’s an equivocal therefore happy ending, but the essay is still an unholy mess. Ultimately, women can’t be funny because men don’t want us to be. We’re here to laugh at your jokes, preferably while situated near a bed, sofa, rug, or back seat. Let’s hope the existence of females as ready-to-be-ravished audiences of one will improve, though that will have to be rooted in deep cultural change. A 2012 Scientific American article, “The Humor Gap,” concluded that “In every context other than friendship, men preferred women who would laugh at their jokes to those who made jokes.”\n\nGuess what, guys? So do we.\n\n“Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand,” Mark Twain wrote, and I like his confidence. The best way to nix the notion that we’re not funny is to be funny. In other words, ladies, make ’em laugh."
