        "text": "The Fatty and Mabel films were produced in 1915, starring Roscoe Arbuckle and Mabel Normand. Although they were made just a short time after the Charlie and Mabel films, they were of an entirely different nature. The eleven films that Charlie and Mabel made, went a long way towards denting the total slapstick regime at Keystone. Chaplin came with a ‘licence’ from big bosses Kessell and Baumann, to work as he wished, although he was, at the time, merely a knockabout comic – an arch slap-sticker. However, he came into contact with Sennett’s star-of-stars, who was then trying to break away from the slapstick mould and develop pictures that had more dramatic and tragic content. Mack’s films were, on one level, crude, seedy and even toxic. The message from New York was that Charlie had to work with Keystone’s biggest star, whether Mack Sennett liked it or not. As a consequence, Mabel was able to utilise Charlie’s ‘licence’ in order to produce films very close to those which she wished to make. Rough and tumble would not be totally ruled out, though, as Sennett could partially introduce slap-stick and, naturally, Charlie had little understanding, back then, of the dramatic arts. The Charlie and Mabel films, then, incorporated Keystone nonsense, with the kind of dramatics that Mabel had trained for under D.W. Griffith. Sennett did not approve of Chaplin being too close to his most valuable star, so he ensured that he (Mack) appeared in some of the films, and so was often on the set to ‘keep an eye on things’. Word had come to Mack that the young pair were having amorous meetings in Mabel’s dressing room, and they’d been seen together all over town – sometimes during working hours, and in a ‘stolen’ company car. By September 1914, Mack had decided to be rid of the young, bohemian upstart and would not renew his contract. Essentially Mabel had made a monkey of Mack, and might have been considering running away with the limey to a rival studio.\n\nCharlie left at Christmas 1914, as Mabel was partying down Hollywood way. However, if Mabel thought she could carry on as before, she would be sorely disappointed. Mack intended to come down on the star-of-stars like a ton of the proverbial concrete blocks. He’d humiliate her, clip her wings and show her who was the boss – Mabel would slapstick like there was no tomorrow. Beyond that, Mack had another idea – he’d recreate Mabel’s old Diving Girl and Water Nymph films, but the stars would not be the 95-pound girls then popular in the movies. He’d reach back to the 1890s and hire chubby, meaty girls, who could wobble effectively in a bathing costume. The first Bathing Beauties began to appear on the lot, as Mack thumped the table and declared that Mabel would hereafter make silly, nonsensical, lovey-dovey films with Roscoe Arbuckle. The themes were common enough at Keystone: Country Girl falls in love with slightly unattractive country boy, even though she has plenty of suitors in her phone book. Inevitably they elope, down the typically Keystone ladder, which snaps in half. After many slapstick-laden adventures they eventually marry. Roscoe and Mabel were furious; these were not the films they wanted to appear in, and they made the pair, seasoned pros, look like amateurs. The fact that the pictures were hugely popular, and good box-office, meant nothing to Mabel, who was soon to be voted the best comedienne of 1915, attracting tens of thousands more votes that Mary Pickford (Best Leading Lady).\n\nIn June 1915, as arrangements were being made to incorporate Keystone into the large conglomerate, Triangle, Mack decided to pull off his best trick yet, and give Mabel the chance to appear in a story that she’d always wished to do – The Little Teacher, written by Mary Pickford in her Biograph days. However, all was not as it seems, for Mabel would not de facto be the star – Mack Sennett would. Seeing that Mabel was still very useful, he gave her a part where she would dive off the high Hollenbeck Bridge in order to rescue Roscoe Arbuckle, and give her the bonus of working with newly-signed Owen Moore, who Mabel had known well at Biograph. Owen was the husband of Mary Pickford, but, as soon as Mack realised Owen and Mary were about to separate, he got rid of Owen for the same reason he’d ditched Chaplin. In all probability, this upset Mabel, and now, with the Bathing Beauties parading around the lot, she considered bailing out of the studio.\n\nWhile Roscoe and Mabel were talking of higher things for the future, the public for their part, couldn’t get enough of the Fatty and Mabel films. They were short, fast-moving and woven around the greatest story on earth — the love story. Even today, they retain a certain charm among those that love silent comedies. In any case, with the money pouring in, Mack was in no mood to risk his cash on feature films like the Tillie’s Punctured Romance of 1914. A lot was happening in California in 1915, and Mack decided to launch his two lovers into The World’s Fair in San Francisco, and The Exposition of San Diego, which celebrated the opening of the Panama Canal. Lovers’ tiffs always played a part in the couple’s films, but in these two films Roscoe and Mabel crank those tiffs up to new levels. In San Francisco, Mabel enters an ‘iron Maiden’ on an old convict ship, and Roscoe slams the door, heavily laden with spikes, on her, while in San Diego, they have violent arguments within the park. Another park, Idora, Oakland, plays a part in Mabel’s Wilful Way, in which Fatty and Mabel seemingly meet for the first time. Mack has his giant electric fans working overtime for this picture, and sets Mabel’s fashionable dress rippling like never before. A newspaper report of the time records that the fans caused Mabel’s dress to blow up over her head during the helter-skelter scenes, so that there were several re-takes required. This probably gave Mabel the idea of giving the audience a glimpse of what she wore under her striped dress. A scene was inserted, in which her parents bend the recalcitrant Mabel over a fairground stall and spank her with a shoe. As Mabel kicks her legs in pain, her flurries of petticoats are revealed to the public gaze.\n\nThe constant arguments that ensued between Mack and Mabel, convinced Mack that he ought to give Mabel a few choice parts, such as in My Valet. In general, though, Mabel’s name would not be prominent in the film titles, and where her name did appear it would follow her leading man’s name. However, Mack made an error by putting Mabel with Raymond Hitchcock, who became a close friend of Mabel’s and was an old foe of Sennett. This was Sennett’s perennial problem, for he had to put Mabel with a leading man, who would inevitably succumb to her diaphanous charms, and, by default become Mack’s opposition. By September of 1915, friction at Keystone was becoming intense, with Roscoe and Mabel becoming jaded by their lacklustre roles. Some time off was required, so, when a shoe bounced off Mabel’s head during a wedding scene, she played it for all it was worth. Roscoe and his wife volunteered to get Mabel to hospital, but drove her directly to their beach pad out at Santa Monica. Meanwhile, Mack was out on location in L.A., where he heard a newsboy announce:\n\n“Read all about it – film star critically injured!”\n\n“Hmm, wonder who that is?” Pondered the King of Comedy.\n\n“Read all about it – Mabel Normand has head injury… expected to die!”\n\n“What the f…..!”\n\nMack rang the studio to learn that nobody knew the whereabouts of Mabel, and it was two weeks before she arrived back on Allesandro Street. Mabel, of course, had not just been sunning herself on the beach, but had likely been in touch with Keystone’s over-bosses and the Triangle boss himself, Harry Aitken back in New York. Arrangements were soon made for Mabel, Roscoe, and a small company to travel out to New York Motion Picture’s studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey on the day after Christmas, 1915. Roscoe and Mabel completed a film called Fatty and Mabel Adrift, then rolled out of L.A. At a stop-over in Salt Lake City, the company fell from the train a little worse for the booze, and carried out a Triangle publicity shoot, where Mabel was pictured drinking something, booze or medicinal ‘goop’, from a bottle. Whatever it was in the bottle, it seems to be intended as an affront to Sennett.\n\nThe company made many stops, en-route to Fort Lee, and were royally welcomed by numerous mayors and local dignitaries, before arriving in the Big Apple, where they were greeted with a great fanfare by their advance guard, led by the incorrigible Sydney Chaplin. Mack Sennett, sitting on his throne, back in an unusually silent Keystone, could not have been amused by the festivities back east. The lunatics had taken over the asylum, and here was the problem; what if Roscoe, Mabel, Minta Arbuckle and Al St. Johns never came back? He had his new stars, like Louise Fazenda, but they were still unknown quantities in the long-term, and how long would the Bathing Beauty craze last? Had Mack’s hubris been misplaced? Meanwhile, after the celebrations, the Mabel Normand company were getting busy. Together with Roscoe, Mabel planned a different type of film, far removed from the Mack Sennett variety. The film would be a drama, with some comedy inserted here and there. Rather than playing lovesick country kids, Roscoe and Mabel played a married middle-class couple, with everything that entailed. The pair can be said to have played dramatic parts in this film, with the comedy supplied by Al St Johns. Mabel is noticeable by the display of more flesh than The Keystone Girl should be displaying, and Roscoe is always suited and booted, as he is a doctor. Essentially, a male school-friend of Mabel’s comes to visit, and Roscoe is not happy. A pair of burglars, or house invaders, are woven into the story, Al St Johns and Joe Bordeaux, who by using deception, gain access to the house. Roscoe manfully throws the intruders out. However, the thugs are not through yet, and one of them phones Roscoe and gets him away on a fake medical call. The place turns out to be an abandoned house, and Roscoe thinks his wife is behind the deception. Meanwhile, the burglars have been in his house, where the usual Keystone fun and japes are taking place as Mabel’s ‘lover’ fights them off. Roscoe returns home after the villains have fled, but finds nightie-clad Mabel just about in bed with her lover. Roscoe throws his competitor out of the window, then strangles Mabel, but she comes around, and shoots the fat man as he descends the stairs. However, the whole thing becomes a Dallas preview, as it turns out that it was all a dream and no fights or shootings ever happened.\n\nOf course, without the dream sequence, it all meant the end of Fatty and Mabel, as far as Keystone was concerned. Was the dream ordered into the script by Sennett? We will never know, but it is possible that he’d decided he actually needed Roscoe and Mabel, and would not let them drift away. Notably, Mabel plays, for the first time since her Griffith days, a naughty woman, with equally naughty thoughts. This Sennett would never have allowed, for his Keystone Girl had to be purity itself, and the notion of her having amorous and womanly desires would have been unthinkable, and bad box-office to boot. The unfortunate thing about this film was that Roscoe directed and shot Mabel as a kind of vamp. This was never going to work, as Mabel was a natural vamp, and did not need to tape her eyelids wide open and circle her eyes with dark greasepaint, like some ghastly Theda Barra or Joan Crawford – her audience liked their ingenue just the way she was. The nods towards vampishness and impropriety were unnecessary, and as Connie Talmadge later said “She could never make a better vamp, even with a rose in her hair.”\n\nEventually, the time arrived for the company to return west. Now, it seems that Mabel’s contract was coming to an end, although Roscoe and wife Minta were still in contract, so, after some discussion, Mabel decided to sit tight in New York, while her friends returned to the coast. Undoubtedly, the big, New York-based Keystone bosses, were keen on having Mabel at their Fort Lee studio, but snatching her from Sennett would have been messy. In any case, what Mabel was interested in getting control of was the new ‘features-only’ studio Sennett had built out at East Hollywood (or more correctly Silverlake). It is possible that Kessell, Baumann and Aitken decided to support her in this, if only to give Sennett a poke in the eye. What followed was incredible, and Mabel pulled off the biggest actress-led coup that the movie industry was ever to see.\n\nIt was while Mack was on the lot, in mid-March, organising his Bathing Beauties, that someone pushed a copy of ‘Variety’ under his nose. He couldn’t believe what he read:\n\n“Mabel Normand with Mutual.”\n\n“It was stated that Mabel Normand has signed a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation on Tuesday afternoon of this week. Miss Normand was closeted with President Freuler for almost an hour, and is said to have affixed her signature to a contract. There is a possibility that she will appear in the Chaplin releases.”\n\n[The Mabel Normand Sourcebook: from Variety March 17, 1916].\n\nWhere the fuck was that bitch, someone get a wire out to Aitken! Well, the wire did no good — no-one knew where Mabel was, and the big bosses denied any knowledge of the Variety article. In fact, Mabel was holed up in the apartment of Raymond Hitchcock and his wife, and communications were eventually only made via Mabel’s family on Staten Island. Quite who did what, and who said what, we do not know, but Mabel returned to the coast in triumph, having secured the new studio for herself, and it would house the newly-born Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. The press, nay Hollywood, went wild.\n\nDisembarking the train in San Bernardino, to avoid reporters, Mabel ran into the town representatives that always garlanded visitors, but a sizeable number of her Hollywood friends were there as well to bombard her with bouquets, as Mack Sennett and Tom Ince fought their way through, to get the Keystone Girl into the waiting company car. Who the three girls were that piled in with them, no-one remembers – was it Norma Talmadge, Dotty Gish, and perhaps Alice Joyce? It was of no import, but it set The King of Comedy’s teeth gnashing, and interfered with the spiel he was about to give Mabel. The upshot was that Mack had a story for the new company, and the studio supervisor would be Tom Ince, not Mack Sennett. Within a week, Mabel had carpeted the studio throughout, strewn fresh flowers around, and had installed a dressing room balcony overlooking the main stage – courtesy of a thousand-dollar loan from Sennett, that was never repaid. Mabel was no longer The Keystone Girl, but was, perhaps, The Mabel Normand Girl.\n\nWe will leave Mabel there, in her moment of triumph, but the Mack and Mabel war was far from over. In the end, neither would claim victory in the endless series of skirmishes that followed, down through the next ten years.\n\nThe Fatty and Mabel Films.\n\n(All can be found on You Tube)\n\nFatty and Mabel’s Wash Day.\n\nFatty and Mabel’s Simple Life.\n\nFatty and Mabel viewing The World’s Fair, San Francisco.\n\nFatty and Mabel at the San Diego exposition\n\nFatty and Mabel’s Married Life.\n\nMabel, Fatty And The Law (Fatty’s Spooning Days).\n\nThe Little Band of Gold.\n\nWished on Mabel.\n\nMabel’s Wilful Way.\n\nThe Little Teacher.\n\nFatty and Mabel Adrift.\n\nHe Did and He Didn’t.\n\n(Those Country Kids 1914)."
