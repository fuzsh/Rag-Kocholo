        "meta_description": "Research offers more support for humor’s impact on psychological well-being than on physical health. The area of humor and its effect on serious mental illness deserves further work. A chortle or two and a good sense of humor also seem to help emotional well-being in folks involved in psychotherapy, whether or not they might qualify for a diagnosis. Based on the assumption that humor can improve mental health, psychotherapists of nearly every ilk have recommended comedy. Some see it as a skill that therapists should develop or as a technique to use in therapy at certain times. A handful of therapists think of humor as a treatment itself. All agree that it’s a double-edged sword, warning that caustic humor has no place in the process of therapy. Appropriate humor seems as if it could enhance empathy, warmth, and genuineness. Affiliative humor, the kind that brings people together, certainly sounds apt.",

        "text": "As we saw in the previous chapter, Norman Cousins’s use of humor against physical disease became legendary. Although his treatment included a lot more than watching Duck Soup, he claimed that laughter played a key role in helping him in his arthritis. He also emphasized the interplay between his physical health and his psychological well-being. Feeling good mentally led to feeling good physically. Research offers more support for humor’s impact on psychological well-being than on physical health. If Norman Cousins serves as the poster boy for humor’s use against medical ills, the man who serves the same role for psychological well-being would have to be Nathan Birnbaum.\n\nNathan, who was much funnier than Cousins, battled other kinds of hardships and lived to be 100. He was one of 12 children and lost his father in a flu epidemic before he was 8 years old. There were no child-labor laws at the time, so little Nathan got a job making syrup at a candy store. Times were so tough that he had to steal coal from the truck on the street to keep the family’s house warm. At least he had a good sense of humor about it. He shined shoes, ran errands, and sold newspapers. One of his business ideas included forming the Pee Wee Quartet. They put a hat on the sidewalk as they sang, in hopes of earning a few pennies. Unfortunately, sometimes people took coins rather than leaving them. Occasionally, they even took the hat.\n\nThe show business bug bit Nathan, even despite the stolen hats. He dropped out of school in fourth grade to attempt to make it as an entertainer. He tried trick roller skating and dancing, but eventually he settled on a vaudeville comedy act. When he was older, he and an acquaintance started a “Dumb Dora” routine at local theaters. He would ask his female colleague straightforward questions; she would answer in a scatterbrained, funny way. Audiences laughed; the new comedy team was booked time and again. Soon Nathan found himself falling in love with his “Dumb Dora,” for she was actually a brilliant comedian. Alas, she was engaged to another performer. It must have hurt to write and rehearse hour after hour with an unrequited crush. Others might have lapsed into a depressive funk, but Nathan kept his sense of humor and eventually won her heart as well as her hand in marriage.\n\nA few years later, the ups and downs of the Great Depression hit everyone hard, but Nathan stayed with it. He could have become anxious and fretful, but instead he kept working. Soon the act played radio, television, and the big screen. Nathan enlisted his brother and a couple of other writers to help craft new jokes. Some routines worked and others didn’t, but Nathan and the team kept coming out on top. Many years later his beloved wife Gracie died. The death of a spouse can be one of the most devastating events in life. Nathan lost a soul mate as well as a stage partner. Again, he kept his sense of humor. He revamped the act by playing up his advancing age and incessant cigar smoking. New crowds adored his work on the stage and screen. Humor had helped him bounce back. He even got a role as the titular character, God, in the movie Oh, God! Of course, he used his stage name: George Burns.\n\nA whole life spent devoted to humor this way is rare, but many people use comedy to keep stressors from spoiling their well-being. We’ve seen the mixed impact that humor can have on physical symptoms and have noted the problems in the published research. But the work on humor and mental health is actually more compelling. Not that you’d know it from the lives of many famous comedians. It can seem hard to argue that humor is the key to psychological well-being, particularly in light of the notorious troubles of a long list of comedians. Patton Oswalt’s riffs about his clinical depression can bring anyone to tears. The legendary drug problems of Lenny Bruce, Chris Farley, John Belushi, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, and Mitch Hedberg come to mind. The odd relationships with food for Louie Anderson, John Pinette, Ralphie May, John Candy, Will Sasso, and Fatty Arbuckle don’t help. High-profile suicides among comic performers make the argument for humor as an aid to well-being difficult. Stand-up comedian Richard Jeni’s self-inflicted death hit me particularly hard. I had seen him in a small venue long before he had HBO specials, and I had always admired his work. His death put one of his classic bits about suicide-inducing love songs into a less funny light. But these outstanding comics are the exceptions rather than the rule. It’s easy to forget that plenty of humorless folks use drugs, gain weight, and kill themselves. There are also thousands of comics who don’t abuse substances, struggle with their girth, or take their own lives, too.\n\nDespite the salient exceptions in the world of stand-up, most people think that humor helps mental health. And the more humor, the better. Much of the research on this topic focuses on variations in mood. We’ll get into experiments and studies that examine comedy’s impact on sadness, angst, or well-being. Other projects look at people with diagnosed disorders—conditions with multiple symptoms, like depression or schizophrenia. Plenty of armchair theorists spin yarns about humor and emotional health in various forms. Others suggest that humor should be a key in battling stress and conducting successful psychotherapy. As we’ll see, it’s not quite this simple. Fortunately, the data have even better tales to tell.\n\nAlternatives to Angst\n\nSo what did this new breed of cognitive behavioral psychologists recommend, instead of spending hours on the couch every week for years and years? All these data on thoughts and actions and their impact on mood suggested that they were the way to go. The new psychologists thought it would be better to take a look at our own thoughts for ourselves. We could emphasize that they’re thoughts but often little more than that. This way, we could see which thoughts were helpful or not. We could move from there to doing the things that we love, while trying to enjoy each moment. Part of examining thoughts requires recognizing that they are thoughts and not necessarily reality. Many of our miseries arise because of key assumptions. Tons of comics make this same point in their own ways. Mitch Hedberg said, “The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I’ll never be as good as a wall.” The joke lets us know that the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat are much less dramatic once you question the assumption of a game. Humor reframes situations by getting us to question the assumptions we make.\n\nIf we can get above the battlefield in our own heads and witness our own minds, we can see these beliefs, opinions, and attitudes for what they sometimes are—interpretations of facts rather than facts themselves. Catching these thoughts as we witness them is the key. That moment when a punch line pulls the rug out from an assumption is often a great start. Thoughts will come and go. It’s just part of being human. Recognizing them for what they are, before they lead us to behave in ways counter to our real values, can make the difference between delight and despair. Confusing what we think or how we feel for “the truth,” with two capital “T”s, particularly in environments where our beliefs or moods are manipulated, can create genuine disadvantages. Mistaking our thoughts for truth can be downright dangerous.\n\nReleasing the Maladaptive Thoughts\n\nWith this kind of approach to identifying and examining our own cognitions, the next step may be easier to say than doletting the maladaptive thoughts fall away. Sometimes it seems that we can’t help believing what we believe, even as evidence to the contrary mounts. These changes in beliefs, moving from maladaptive to adaptive thoughts, may not be a dichotomous, categorical enlightenment. (That would be a form of dichotomous thinking of its own.) I’d love it if every time I triumphed over an irrational thought, something dramatic would happen. It would be great to have the rainclouds part with a crash while a giant ray of rational sunlight came shining down on my head, but it’s rarely that spectacular. The gradual transition, a sort of splintering off of irrational aspects of the depressing thoughts to leave the realistic, rational ones, may be more common. We can make the sum of small movements turn into big ones over time. The vigilance required can be daunting. A lot of this process is more about losing illusions than about finding new truths. It’s not that we need to learn some new thoughts as much as it is about letting go of some old, maladaptive ones.\n\nThe message in comedy is often to challenge false beliefs. There’s a genuine pleasure inherent in defying rules that go unexamined. Watch Chris Rock challenge the idea that ethnicity or money or popularity or parenthood is supposed to guarantee happiness. Once he questions some of these ideas, it’s hard not to feel relief as well as mirth when you realize that none of these notions are important enough to wreck your mood. Chipping away at archaic, maladaptive beliefs, or even good ideas that have gone too far, can be its own source of glee. The fact that these beliefs may arise from the government, the family, education, or religion should not make them too sacred to challenge. Comedy encourages an independence of mind. Of course, this approach also emphasizes the import of action—any action, no matter how small."
