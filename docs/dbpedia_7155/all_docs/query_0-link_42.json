        "text": "Though Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd are today widely considered The Big Three of silent comedy, those are rankings that arose in large part due to the scandal which derailed Roscoe’s career for so many years. When the scandal hit in September 1921, Roscoe was second only to Chaplin, and even ranked above him in some polls.\n\nIn the silent era, Buster wasn’t as popular as he is today. He was talked into moving to MGM in 1928 in part because he wasn’t doing as well as he would’ve liked by the box office. It was only later that people began rediscovering Buster’s silent work and giving him a major reappraisal.\n\nI’m in the camp who supports Roscoe as the fourth great silent clown. Let’s just say Harry Langdon isn’t my style at all.\n\nMany of Roscoe’s films were presumably lost forever in the wake of the scandal, when they were ordered destroyed. Luckily, we do have a fair number which survived in other archives, like all the films he did with Buster and Chaplin. Other films, like The Cook, were miraculously discovered after decades of being given up for lost.\n\nBy 1932, Roscoe’s reputation had recovered, and the public welcomed him back to the silver screen. Sadly, he passed away before he could begin making features again, but at least he’d lived to see his reputation restored, and didn’t have to hide behind the camera and a pseudonym anymore.\n\nOn top of the catastrophe of having so many films destroyed, Roscoe also suffered from the near-total lack of film preservation in Hollywood’s early decades. This wasn’t an era of film studies majors, indie theatres devoted to classics, film festivals, scholarly books about film history, and certificates in film preservation. Many films were destroyed as soon as they were out of theatres, since no one thought anyone would care to watch them again. They were cheap, disposable entertainment for the masses.\n\nBy the time people began realizing how important it was to preserve film history, and getting interested in films from a bygone generation, it was too late for many silents. They were long lost, either deliberately destroyed or victims of nitrate fires, or too far gone for serious restoration. Many others languished in closets and other unlikely locations.\n\nIn the early 21st century, a number of Roscoe’s surviving films were restored and issued on DVD, as well as by film festivals. The Museum of Modern Art twice ran a series with 56 of his films in April and May 2006.\n\nOver the decades, Roscoe has been referenced or portrayed in a number of films, not always truthfully or flatteringly. The PBS children’s show Square One (which I watched in its original run) also had a fictitious deceased celebrity named Roscoe “Fatty” Tissue.\n\nIn 2004, author Jerry Stahl published the (not so truthful!) novel I, Fatty. A number of non-fiction books have also been written.\n\nIt really upsets me when people say Roscoe raped and murdered Virginia Rappé, or call him “Fatty.” He always said, “I’ve got a name, you know,” when someone called him that demeaning nickname. That was his character’s name, not a name he chose for himself, and once he had full creative control, he always put the screen name in quotes, after his real name.\n\nThankfully, most scholarly books on film history give him the dignity of his true name, or put “Fatty” in quotes in the middle.\n\nLet’s also not forget the second victim of the scandal. Virginia Rappé was only 26, an innocent young woman who died far too young. Roscoe had nothing to do with her tragic death, and indeed tried to help her when he found her in such dire straits. Regardless of what kind of morals she did or didn’t have, she didn’t deserve to die. In the 21st century, we should really be far beyond condemning women for not being pure, innocent virgins with G-rated lives.\n\nRoscoe and Virginia were both victims, in different ways. The real villain was Maude Delmont, who started the scandal in the first place with her slanderous accusations. Let’s not make Virginia out to be some shady woman of ill repute just because she was drinking and had had a number of abortions. There’s more than enough proof of Roscoe’s innocence; we don’t need to drag the other victim down to establish that innocence.\n\nRoscoe once said, “A man is nothing without his good name.” Let’s help to make sure that name stays good for eternity.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBetween 1909–33, Roscoe appeared in over 150 films, with his most prolific years being 1913–21. He also directed over 130 films (billed as William B. Goodrich from 1924–32) and wrote over 35 films. Sadly, his films were ordered destroyed in the wake of the scandal, and many of them are now considered lost. Others exist only in archives.\n\nLost films are starred, as per the latest information available at SilentEra.com.\n\nSelig Polyscope Company:\n\nBen’s Kid (1909)*\n\nMrs. Jones’ Birthday (1909)*\n\nMaking It Pleasant for Him (1909)*\n\nThe Sanitarium (1910)*\n\nAlas!

This was before Buster adopted his famous stoneface, so you get to see him smiling in some of the films. Roscoe’s nephew Al St. John also co-stars, typically playing the villain. Last but not least, there’s Luke the Dog.\n\nThe Cook and Other Treasures, featuring two long-lost shorts plus the Harold Lloyd short Number, Please?\n\nThe Vitaphone Comedy Collection Volume One – Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle/Shemp Howard (1932-1934), featuring Roscoe’s six sound films with Warner Brothers.\n\nThe Forgotten Films of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, an incredible four-disc set spanning 1913–21. There are also a few later films he directed.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThough Roscoe was unanimously declared not guilty and given an unprecedented apology, Hollywood still refused to have anything to do with him. Not only was he blacklisted, but his films were ordered to be destroyed. This had heartbreaking, disastrous effects for film history, though at least a fair amount of Roscoe’s films have survived.\n\nRoscoe was deep in debt from all his legal fees, but he had some really good frieda who completely paid off his debts. His best friend Buster Keaton got the ball rolling on that matter. Roscoe’s friends also sent him on holiday to the Orient to try to forget what had happened, but it was impossible to forget something that traumatic and life-altering.\n\nIn 1923, upon Roscoe’s return to the U.S., director James Cruze ignored the blacklist and cast him in a cameo role in the satirical Hollywood, one of the most famous and sought-after lost films. Buster, always a super friend, gave Roscoe directing and writing duties for Daydreams and Sherlock, Jr. Roscoe gave Buster his start in films in 1917, took him under his wing, and mentored him, and now it was time for Buster to give back.\n\nRoscoe and his estranged wife Minta, who’d remained good friends, tried a reconciliation. Sadly, things didn’t work out, and Minta filed for divorce a second time. Roscoe remarried to Doris Deane on 18 May 1925.\n\nAlso in 1925, Hollywood allowed Roscoe to work as a director, provided he didn’t use his real name. He chose the pseudonym William Goodrich, after his father. Buster suggested Will B. Good, but Roscoe vetoed it as too obvious of a joke.\n\nIn 1927, Roscoe gave Bob Hope his big break by letting him be the opening act for his comedy show. He also gave Bob contact information of Hollywood friends, and advised him to go west.\n\nIn 1929, Roscoe’s second marriage ended in divorce, due in part to the drinking problem he’d developed.\n\nIn 1928, he opened Roscoe Arbuckle’s Plantation Club, a nightclub which many Hollywood stars most enthusiastically supported. Free entertainment was provided by stars including Chaplin and Buster, and past co-star Mabel Normand presented him with a huge floral sculpture on opening night. Sadly, the Great Depression forced the club to close.\n\nRoscoe embarked upon a successful stage tour, and returned to directing in 1930. One of these films was Windy Riley Goes to Hollywood, the legendary Louise Brooks’s first talkie. (Louise did appear in the 1930 talkie Prix de Beauté, but all her singing and dialogue were dubbed.)\n\nOn the tenth anniversary of the scandal, Motion Picture magazine published “Doesn’t Fatty Arbuckle Deserve a Break?” Dozens of stars signed it, and audience response was immense. Finally, in early 1932, Warner Brothers signed him for a series of six two-reelers, under his own name. The films were hugely successful in the U.S., though the British Board of Film Censors still had him blacklisted.\n\nRoscoe married for the third time in June 1932, to Addie Oakley Dukes McPhail, 18 years his junior. This marriage truly made him happy, and came at such a most fortuitous time in his life.\n\nOn 28 June 1933, Roscoe finished filming the last two-reeler in his contract, and the very next day was signed by Warner Brothers to make feature-length films. That night, he went out with friends to celebrate his first wedding anniversary and the new contract.\n\nLater that night, Roscoe died in his sleep of a heart attack, aged only 46. Buster believed he’d died of a broken heart, though Addie said he died smiling. He’d lived long enough to see his reputation restored.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOn 5 September 1921, Roscoe went to San Francisco with two friends, checked into three rooms by the St. Francis Hotel, and used one for a little party. One of the guests was 26-year-old bit player Virginia Rappé.\n\nWhen Roscoe saw her vomiting, she said she felt ill and asked to lie down. Roscoe carried her into the bedroom and went for help. When he returned, she was on the floor, tearing at her clothes, and violently convulsing. She was put in a cold bathtub and taken to another room, after which Roscoe called the manager and doctor. The doctor declared she’d had too much to drink, and gave her morphine.\n\nTwo days later, she was hospitalized, and Maude Delmont, whom she’d only met a few days before the party, accused Roscoe of rape. The doctor found no evidence, though Mrs. Delmont continued with her accusations.\n\nOn 9 September, Virginia passed away from secondary peritonitis and a ruptured bladder.\n\nMrs. Delmont went to the cops, and they jumped to the wild conclusion that Virginia’s bladder had ruptured due to the impact of Roscoe’s massive body.\n\nVirginia’s manager, Al Semnacker, accused Roscoe of raping her with ice. Over time, it transmogrified into a bottle of champagne, Coca-Cola, and milk. Witnesses testified Roscoe only rubbed ice on her stomach to try to ease her abdominal pain.\n\nMrs. Delmont made a later statement to police in hopes of getting money from Roscoe’s lawyers.\n\nRoscoe was arrested and arraigned on manslaughter charges on 17 September. After almost three weeks, bail came through.\n\nSuite 1221 of the St. Francis Hotel, shortly after the party\n\nDuring the three trials, several witnesses testified Virginia suffered from cystitis, which worsens by the imbibing of alcohol; venereal disease; and several substandard abortions within a few years (the last one days before the party).\n\nThe sleazy William Randolph Hearst absolutely loved this story, since it “sold more newspapers than any event since the sinking of the Lusitania.” This was one of a number of Hollywood scandals which led to the creation of the infamous Hays Code.\n\nThe public judged Roscoe guilty immediately, and he went from mega-star to public enemy overnight. Many called for his death, studio executives issued a gag order prohibiting anyone from speaking up on his behalf, and his films were banned.\n\nThough yellow journalists portrayed Roscoe as some obese sex fiend who literally threw his weight around with innocent young ladies, Roscoe was extremely shy with women, very sweet-natured, chivalrous, and known as “the most chaste man in pictures.”\n\nCharlie Chaplin, who was in England at the time, positively spoke of Roscoe to reporters, and Roscoe’s best friend Buster Keaton got a mild reprimand for publicly speaking up in his defence. Cowboy actor William S. Hart, however, said some downright nasty, damaging things.\n\nIn response, Roscoe wrote a premise for a film parodying him as a wife-beater, bully, and thief, and sold it to Buster. In 1922, Buster made this film as two-reeler The Frozen North. Hart was so pissed, he didn’t speak to Buster for years.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Brady, San Fransisco District Attorney, made many public pronouncements of Roscoe’s alleged guilt, and pressured witnesses to lie under oath. During the indictment hearing, Mrs. Delmont was the star witness. Though the judge threatened to dismiss the case, Brady refused to let his own star witness testify by the actual trial.\n\nLike many other liars, Mrs. Delmont was eventually caught. She had a very long criminal record, with numerous convictions for fraud, bigamy, extortion, and racketeering. She also supposedly was making a career out of luring men into compromising situations and taking photographs for use in divorce proceedings.\n\nRoscoe’s lawyers also found a letter in which Mrs. Delmont admitted her plan to extort money from Roscoe.\n\nDuring the three trials, Roscoe’s estranged wife Minta regularly came to court to support him. One time, she was shot at while entering the courtroom.\n\nIn addition to all the witnesses being caught out as liars, the abovementioned evidence about Virginia’s health also came to light.\n\nRoscoe testified last, saying exactly what had happened at the party and how he’d tried to help.\n\nA mistrial was declared, and a second trial, with a new jury, began 11 January 1922. More monkey business was uncovered, and there was another mistrial. A third trial began 13 March 1922.\n\nRoscoe’s lawyer was much more aggressive the third time around, and finally, a unanimous not guilty verdict was declared, along with a major apology:\n\nAcquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and women who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTo mark the 95th anniversary of the scandal which changed comedy legend Roscoe Arbuckle’s life forever, I’m doing another theme week. Roscoe was such a wonderful comedian and dear, sweet man who deserves to be remembered truthfully. Though he was completely exonerated, many people judge him guilty based on decades-old lies, and call him “Fatty.” However, I’m hopeful his reputation will continue its gradual rehabilitation and that more people will discover his surviving films.\n\nRoscoe Conkling Arbuckle was born 24 March 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, weighing over 13 pounds. Since both of his parents were slim people, his father, William Goodrich Arbuckle, foolishly believed another man had to be the father. Thus, the baby was named for NY Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling, a notorious philanderer whom he hated. (What a loving father!)\n\nPossibly due to his large size, Roscoe’s birth was very traumatic and caused chronic health problems for his mother, Mary (Mollie) E. Gordon Arbuckle. These health problems sadly contributed to her death 12 years later. However, while his mother was still earthside, she encouraged him to join character actor Frank Bacon’s troupe in Santa Ana, California. Roscoe made his stage début at age eight.\n\nRoscoe had a wonderful singing voice and was very graceful in spite of his size. He moved like a ballerina. Roscoe loved performing, though after his mother’s death, his abusive father forced him to retire and wouldn’t even financially support him. Young Roscoe did odd jobs in a hotel, singing while he worked.\n\nOne day, a professional singer overheard him and invited him to an amateur talent show. The audience clapped or jeered, and bombing acts were pulled offstage by a hook. Roscoe didn’t impress them, and when he saw the hook coming, he fearfully dove into the orchestra pit. The audience went nuts over this, so much so Roscoe won the contest and began a vaudeville career.\n\nIn 1904, Sid Grauman invited Roscoe to sing by his new Unique Theater in San Francisco. After this, Roscoe joined the touring Pantages Theater Group. Ironically, this group was headed by Greek-born vaudevillian and producer Alexander Pantages, whose career also crashed to a halt after he was accused of rape. (Pantages was also ultimately acquitted, though that’s a whole other story!)\n\nIn 1906, Roscoe played by the Orpheum Theater in Portland, Oregon, in a vaudeville troupe headed by Australian-born Leon Errol. Roscoe rose to become the star, and went on tour again.\n\nOn 6 August 1908, Roscoe married Araminta (Minta) Estelle Durfee (1 October 1889–9 September 1975), whom he co-starred with many times from 1913 to 1916. In contrast to Roscoe, Minta was short and petite.\n\nAfter marrying, Roscoe joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company, with whom he toured Japan and China. He started his film career in July 1909, after returning to the U.S.\n\nRoscoe’s first film was Ben’s Kid, shot by the Selig Polyscope Company. He appeared on and off in their one-reelers till 1913, then briefly moved to Universal Pictures. Soon after this, he got picked up by the legendary Mack Sennett, and became one of the famous Keystone Kops.\n\nThough Roscoe knew his weight was part of his appeal, he was very self-conscious about it, and had the dignity to refuse to use it for cheap laughs. For example, he never got stuck in a chair or doorway, and didn’t act winded going up or down stairs. He also hated the screen name “Fatty.”\n\nIn 1914, Paramount Pictures offered him $1,000 a day, 25% of all profits, and total creative control. Roscoe’s films were so popular, he was offered a three-year, three million dollar contract in 1918. This was about $47,000,000 in 2016 money.\n\nBesides wife Minta, Roscoe also frequently co-starred with Mabel Normand (one of the biggest female comedy stars of the era), his nephew Al St. John (the blonde on the right), his best friend Buster Keaton (on the left), and the awesome Luke, his very talented Pit Bull.\n\nThough Roscoe and Minta separated in 1921 (just prior to the scandal) and divorced in 1925, Minta always spoke of him in the most wonderful terms, calling him the most generous person she’d ever met, and that if she had to do it all over again, she’d still marry him. Roscoe also got visitation rights with Luke.\n\nRoscoe had a health scare in 1916, with an infected carbuncle that almost cost him his leg. Though he lost 80 pounds during recovery and saved his leg, he also became addicted to the drug of the gods, morphine. (I loved getting legally high on morphine after my surgeries and during my hospital stays!)\n\nAfter his recovery, he started his own film company, Comique. Roscoe continued going from strength to strength, and in 1920, he began making features.\n\nThen, on 5 September 1921, his life changed forever.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
