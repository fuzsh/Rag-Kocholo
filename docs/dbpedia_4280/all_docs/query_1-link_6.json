        "text": "Five years before his death in 1881, the Swiss-German pioneer of international law Johann Kaspar Bluntschli published his thoughts on the genesis of the modern state. Summarizing the intellectual yields of a fifty-year career, he posited in Lehre vom modernen Staat that sovereignty had become an exclusive good in the era of the nation-state. Unlike the middle ages, when monarchs had supposedly been the supreme proprietors of the whole land and subjects held their estates as fiefs, public law now adhered to the principle that the territory of a state was inalienable and indivisible. Consequently, it was ‘no longer possible to do as the mediaeval princes did, who sold, or pawned, or partitioned their domains as pieces of private property’.Footnote 1 This bold claim about the attainments of Western civilization seemed to be confirmed by the proliferation of international conventions like the 1856 Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law that recognized the sovereign character of signatory and acceding states.Footnote 2 Yet what Bluntschli left unsaid was that the emerging frameworks of international law reinforced another mainstay of nineteenth-century political history: conquest. In an era of imperial expansion, treaties hid asymmetries of power by affirming the equality of victors and vanquished on a symbolic plane. European powers established protectorates around the globe, which left suzerainty nominally in the hands of the weaker party, because they appreciated the benefits of jurisdictional grey-zones. Partnering up with local rulers reduced the need for expensive garrisons of occupation, obviated international resistance to outright annexation, and shored up the tenuous loyalties of new subjects.Footnote 3\n\nThe contrast between the theory and practice of governance in the nineteenth century lends weight to recent efforts across different disciplines to rethink the plural and divisible applications of sovereignty as activity in relation to the unified and inseparable character of sovereignty as doctrine. The exercise of jurisdiction, James J. Sheehan usefully suggests in this context, ‘is best understood as a set of claims made by those seeking or wielding power, claims about the superiority and autonomy of their authority. State making, therefore, is the ongoing process of making, unmaking, and revising sovereign claims.’Footnote 4 This injunction usefully highlights that even the most asymmetric transfers of sovereignty through conquest are ultimately incomplete. Consider in this context Lauren Benton's claim that in relegating indigenous leaders to a place of liminality in the edifice of European empires, ‘[i]ndeterminacy was being articulated as policy – even as a core principle of an imperial law based on divisible sovereignty’ in the case of British India.Footnote 5 In the words of one British government official from 1875, defining where a ruling prince merged into a British subject at times seemed ‘beyond the power of language’. Benton notes that in such a fluid environment paramountcy resided in the prerogative of the imperial power to decide when to let politics rather than the law speak. By the same token, the colonial state could also decide not to intervene in the affairs of conquered grandees, thus ensuring that they retained a minimalist or nominal modicum of ‘bare sovereignty’.Footnote 6 The choice to leave Indian princes with trappings of bare sovereignty coincided with a path-breaking transition in international law away from universal natural law towards a positivist concern with custom. Thus, whereas the older rhetoric of universalism presumed the existence of a higher morality in all civilizations and states, positivist legal frameworks required more culture-specific forms of consent.Footnote 7\n\nBenton insists that European polities also preserved ‘anomalous enclaves and loosely configured corridors of imperial control’, yet this insight remains incidental to her work. Building on the historiographical convergence of German and global history in the last decade, this essay argues that Prussia, much like the maritime empires of Britain or France, experimented with sovereignty in the wake of conquest.Footnote 8 Twice the Hohenzollerns made territorial gains by force in the period under investigation, first in 1815 when they absorbed the lands of mediatized princes and again in 1866 when they annexed several of Austria's north German allies. Learning from Prussia's own experience of defeat and occupation at the hands of Napoleonic France in 1806, reform-minded statesmen such as Reichsfreiherr Karl vom Stein and Prince Karl August von Hardenberg promoted an ideology of ‘enlightened nationalism’ that aimed to ‘reconcile a sovereign monarch with a politically active citizenry’, as Matthew Levinger has put it.Footnote 9 Their proposed remedy for Prussia's heterogeneity was the development of a normative sphere where subjects could express concerns locally through consultative bodies in the expectation that the king would act as final arbiter. In this scenario, the right to rule derived from an implicit social contract between the monarchy and the people.Footnote 10 The revolutionary turmoil of 1848 broke down the last barriers to the establishment of a state parliament and even the promulgation of a constitution. While the granting of these concessions at the king's pleasure was hardly exceptional (Louis XVIII had done the same when he issued the Charte constitutenelle upon his ascension to the French throne in 1814), historians have long debated whether the continuing affirmation of royal supremacy tempered by ‘self-imposed’ restrictions made Prussia's constitutional monarchy a distinctive, self-contained expression of sovereignty, or rather represented an intermediary stage on the road to parliamentary rule.Footnote 11 Recent scholarship attests to overlapping sources of metajuridical authority that defy a clear-cut answer.Footnote 12 Some historians, notably Frank-Lothar Kroll, see the expanding consultative role of parliament moving in step with other Western European countries, even though outright appeals to ‘popular sovereignty’ (Volkssouveränität) remained limited in German texts at the time.Footnote 13 Alternative explanations that emphasize the persistence of royal hegemony meanwhile fall short where they measure the decisions of the crown by the standards of twenty-first-century democracy, and naturally find them wanting.Footnote 14\n\nThe present article proposes to re-examine the Hohenzollern dynasty's claim to leadership from a fresh angle. It does so by arguing that challenges to the monarchical principle before national unification in 1871 did not only come from liberal demands for greater parliamentary agency but also the residual rights of mediatized and dethroned princes. The German Confederation was home to no fewer than 14 reigning dynasties as well as about 100 lesser standesherrlich families.Footnote 15 Many minor sovereigns had been unable to defend their autonomy against the shifting political tides of the Napoleonic Wars, a fate several of the remaining princes – among them the king of Hanover, the elector of Hesse-Kassel, and the duke of Nassau – were destined to share after picking the wrong side in the German civil war of 1866. Thomas Biskup and Martin Kohlrausch have therefore gone so far as to suggest that ‘for German dynasts…the greatest threat emanated not from revolution but other German monarchs that wished to depose them by force’.Footnote 16 Yet, paradoxically, the losers of this power struggle were slow to lose their sovereign attributes. Amongst other privileges, Article 14 of the 1815 German Federal Act confirmed mediatized houses’ dynastic equality with reigning monarchs and permitted them to dispense various forms of local justice. Perhaps most tellingly, the Prussian crown agreed to conclude a treaty with exiled King Georg V of Hanover in 1867 which provided for his material comfort without requiring him to renounce his sovereignty.Footnote 17\n\nThe suspended state of animation of vanquished dynasts raises intriguing questions about the exercise of royal dominion. For example, it invites us to reconsider continuities in Prussian state-building. Contemporary legal scholars and modern historians have so far stressed the fundamentally different politico-legal position of Standesherren and dethroned monarchs. They point to the fact that the two groups formed no common legal estate. Mediatized princes, writes Jonathan Spangler, were ‘neither typically noble nor strictly speaking royal’.Footnote 18 The majority of these semi-royal grandees were prepared to recognize Hohenzollern overlordship in return for material compensation and social distinction, whereas fully royal exiles such as Georg V and Friedrich Wilhelm I of Hessen-Kassel steadfastly refused to enter into agreements that compromised their sovereign standing. Similarly, although European courts had no qualms about affirming the mediatization of Standesherren at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, they felt conflicted about the dethronement of close relatives at the end of the Austro-Prussian War.Footnote 19 Heinz Gollwitzer therefore concludes that instead of being natural allies, the losers of 1806 and 1866 remained too divided by history, international politics, and even economic circumstances to find much common ground.Footnote 20\n\nThe prevailing concern with difference occludes important connections between the two dynastic communities, however. Chief among them are their common origin. Prior to 1806, every prince belonged in principle to the high nobility (hohe Adel) that had a seat in the Imperial Diet and ruled over a territory that was only immediate unto the Holy Roman Empire.Footnote 21 Power was dispersed in such a setting. ‘Unlike nations and states’, James J. Sheehan has observed, ‘the Reich did not insist upon pre-eminent authority and unquestioning allegiance. Its goal was not to clarify and dominate but rather to order and balance fragmented institutions and multiple loyalties.’Footnote 22 Despite the reformatory impulses of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic period, composite statehood remained an attractive model throughout central Europe, which both satisfied nostalgic longings for a return to pre-modern systems of order and responded to the eclecticism of new administrative structures.Footnote 23 The ambitious Hohenzollerns were no less alive to these advantages than their Austrian competitors. For instance, when Prussia proceeded to digest the spoils of the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the authorities left the old municipal elites in post for a while because their continued presence made the rupture of regime change less apparent.Footnote 24 That the illusion of an unbroken chain of monarchical dominion continued to preoccupy statesmen pointed to the universal utility of invented traditions but also meant – to paraphrase the philosopher Robert Pogue Harrison – that former rulers were fated to remain undead as long as their image survived.Footnote 25 Put another way, where monarchs drew on the symbolic capital of their predecessors to navigate the fragmented legacy of conquest, sovereignty functioned as a shared resource.\n\nThis article contends that the Prussian ‘monarchical principle’ masked fundamental insecurities about how to deal with holders of residual sovereignty. Constitutional theorists following in the footsteps of Jean Bodin argued that if sovereignty was indivisible, as they believed, it should be vested exclusively in the executive branch of government headed by the crown. But how was the case for a strong monarchy to be made by princes who sought to extend their power at the expense of peers? The fact that many states had secured territory through conquest during the Napoleonic Wars and at the Congress of Vienna only steeled the determination of the surviving monarchs to defend their possessions. The Final Act of the Vienna Congress proclaimed Germany's crowned heads the carriers of ‘all state authority’ (gesamte Staatsgewalt) in their domains in 1815.Footnote 26 At the same time, mediatized princes retained pretensions to independent authority in certain areas, and legitimists warned that any unilateral dispossession of rulers’ patrimony fragmented the very idea of sovereignty, since each side was left in possession of some attributes. The ambiguity which was thus introduced into the legal idea and exercise of the monarchical principle took decades to resolve. Indeed, the Prussian crown's negotiations with the Standesherren lasted long enough to still be in progress by the time the government proceeded to absorb the thrones conquered in 1866, which offers a final reason for why the two groups of toppled sovereigns merit study not apart but together.\n\nAlthough Germany's federal heritage invested the question of where sovereignty resided with unrivalled complexity vis-à-vis more centrally governed nations, the issues that the Hohenzollerns and their detractors grappled with tapped into wider currents of political transformation and realignment since the French Revolution. Just as aristocrats at large shifted their ethos from seigneurialism to an emphasis on service to the state, so, too, monarchs – reigning or otherwise – had to justify their leadership in novel ways that took account of society's needs in an era of burgeoning nationalism and proliferating constitutions.Footnote 27 How these objectives were to be met remained a bone of contention. In exploring the competition of the Hohenzollerns and rival sovereigns for power, money, and legitimacy, the article foregrounds the disorientation wrought by the nineteenth century's territorial changes and reconfiguration of loyalties. Within the short space of seventy years, the region that would become the German empire evolved from a porous conglomerate of semi-autonomous bodies, specially defined communities, and Länder peculiar unto themselves into a nation-state with relatively uniform boundaries, law codes, and political institutions.Footnote 28\n\nThe nineteenth century's betwixt-and-between condition is elegantly captured by the Marxist phrase of the ‘simultaneity of the non-simultaneous’.Footnote 29 Uneven socio-political reforms and fractures in lived experience produced time lags in contemporaries’ adjustment to the social, political, and technological transformations unfolding around them. Read one way, the insistence of Standesherren and exiled monarchs on entitlements and exemptions outside the constitutional rights granted to ordinary subjects marked these individuals as ancien régime hold-outs destined to succumb to the twin pressures of bureaucratic rationalization and national integration.Footnote 30 Measured by their own standards, however, the dispossessed and their Hohenzollern competitors negotiated discrete visions of modernity in putting forward claims to sovereign status. For all their innate conservatism, King Georg V and Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I had no qualms about appealing to public opinion for quasi-plebiscitary support. Conversely, the Prussian government blended pre-1789 understandings of sovereignty as disposable crown property with ‘progressive’ pronouncements on national interest and the right of the German nation to be unified."
