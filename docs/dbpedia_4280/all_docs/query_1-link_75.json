You didn’t need to know anything about the author either. He rejected both biography and periodicity. Camus, he declared, was not superior to Chaucer, he was simply sitting on the other man’s shoulders. It struck me there was something almost Lutheran about this: the book alone would provide all we needed to understand the book. There were other tools, however: Coulson positively encouraged us to read literary criticism. He had read English at Oxford, something that he found hard to live down. In his heart he had wanted to be at Cambridge, the home of the great critics F R Leavis and I A Richards. Boys who desired to do English were told to apply to Cambridge. If we couldn’t go there, York had a good department; but whatever we did, avoid Oxford.\n\nAs it turned out, I didn’t go to Cambridge and I didn’t read English. I studied history and became a historian specialising in France then Germany. I still love literature, however, but I confess that when I read a novel I am not immune from using it to feed my understanding of some aspect of the historical period in which it was written. I should add very quickly that I can’t see the point of historical novels. If I want to know something about Thomas Cromwell, I read a proper book about him, not a novel.\n\nWhich brings us to While We Were Dreaming: it is a German Bildungsroman. It explores the circle of the adolescent Daniel Lenz, a bright, working-class boy growing up in the bleak eastern suburbs of Leipzig. He lives alone with his mother, his father having been sent to a camp after a punch-up with the ‘Vopos,’ the East German state police. Daniel inhabits a panorama of slab blocks and ruins bisected by roads and railway lines, the only relief provided by a few grimy pubs filled with sodden old topers.\n\nThe prospect before the boys is mapped out at school: they can choose to be good socialists and progress from the ‘Pioneers’ (politicised boy scouts) to the FDJ (Free German Youth - the regime’s version of the Hitler Youth). With time they might aspire to Party membership. The Party ‘Nomenklatura’ enjoyed a better life with plenty of treats and privileges. If they opt to become bad boys, they can join gangs of neo-Nazi skins, anarchist ‘crusties’ (a new word for me), or Goths. There are lots of violent clashes between ‘fash’ and ‘antifa’ not to mention ‘hools’ - supporters of rival football teams.\n\nWhile We Were Dreaming is a long, stark, brutal, male novel and a brilliant depiction of the purposelessness of working class boys around the time of the ‘Change’. They are decadent. They drink, smoke, take drugs, steal, look at porn and fight rival gangs; and relax by watching football, boxing, playing pool and dreaming about girls. The come together in makeshift clubs in sheds and cellars to an accompaniment of booming ‘techno’ music. This nihilistic drink-and-drug-fuelled existence could just as easily be set in Glasgow or Dublin, or any other run-down, post-industrial city, but there is an important difference: the political legacy of Leipzig and its key role in bringing the East German regime to an end. The connection emerges late in the book, but hints multiply along the way as more people migrate to the West, leaving the boys mired in increasing political and social isolation. Once the regime falls, Stasi spies disappear from schools to reappear in menial roles later on. One who leaves is Katja, Daniel’s good muse, who wanted to keep him on the straight and narrow. The boys show little interest in politics, even if they have rejected the wholesome solution of Party membership. They flout authority and like their fathers before them, perceive the ‘Vopos’ as their enemy. Borstal and grown-up prison are just so many Stations of the Cross along the well-trodden path.\n\nThe novel is very cleverly constructed. Episodes are not played out chronologically but recounted in such a way as to add more colour to the picture. Daniel’s friends succumb one by one, the girls become prostitutes (like his bad muse, Estrellita), while the boys are committed to longer and longer prison sentences, or wiped out by meaningless death. But is it all in the book? I may be mistaken, but it may not be an easy novel to understand if you know nothing about everyday life in ‘the Zone’, or East Germany under the ‘communist’ SED regime. I wallowed in the cheap brands of cigarettes and schnapps, the Vietnamese tobacco peddlers and the chance to get some Western goods if you happen to work in the right place, but I might have been tempted to include some sort of introduction, possibly written by the excellent translator Katy Derbyshire (who lives in Berlin), to frame the narrative, but possibly the book doesn’t need it?\n\nWith respect to Peter Coulson, however, I did not look up the salient facts about Clemens Meyer until after I had finished. The author is a forty-five year old novelist from Halle in Saxony. He was born a citizen of the East German DDR and was twelve when the Berlin Wall came down - or thirteen when the two halves of Germany were sewn back together. He was in borstal for a while before finding the right path much as Daniel does. Meyer speaks from first-hand experience. While We Were Dreaming was published in German in 2007. It is a simply stunning first novel. Now I must read the rest.\n\nKarina Durbach, Alice’s Book: How the Nazis Stole My Grandmother’s Cookbook\n\nMacLehose Press, £20 hardback, £14.99 paper\n\nPosted: 15th February 2023\n\nThe golden age for Vienna’s Jews lasted less than fifty years, between 1867, when they were first granted full liberty to settle in the city, and 1914 when the disastrous First World War broke out. It was a period accompanied by an artistic and intellectual flowering that is explored in Tom Stoppard’s brilliant new play Leopoldstadt. After 1914, war, famine, revolution, hyperinflation and the collapse of the Creditanstalt bank in 1931 contrived to whittle down the fortunes of so many quondam millionaires, several years before the Nazis administered the coup de grâce.\n\nKarina Durbach’s grandmother was born Alice Mayer, the daughter of a rich cloth merchant who rose out of the lowly Leopoldstadt, where the Jews had settled after 1867 and aspired towards the more genteel, leafier suburbs of the city among the vines of Döbling. She married a doctor who died young after squandering her dowry at the gambling tables, leaving her to bring up their two sons. This book is a chronicle of their lives.\n\nDr Durbach’s behaviour almost reduced Alice to penury, but an early interest in cooking meant she could survive by running a fashionable cookery school. Then as now, cookery books were an obvious spin off. Their fortunes were remade. But then came the Anschluss of 12 March 1938. Three days later Hitler reached Vienna and all that changed. Jews were immediately subjected to the corpus of antisemitic legislation that had been enacted in Germany. Her books continued to sell well, but the royalties were awarded to one Rudolf Rösch whose name replaced hers on the covers.\n\nOne of her sons was already safe in the US, but the other suffered a spell in Dachau after the Kristallnacht pogrom in November. Alice fled to England and became cook to the eccentric Violet van der Elst at Harlaxton Manor before running a school for Kindertransport children in Newcastle and Windermere. Her story recalls the fates of so many German or Austrian Jews who sought sanctuary in Britain: reception at Woburn House where many were assigned to domestic service and given patronising advice on how to behave in their new country, detention on the Isle of Man with other ‘enemy aliens’ and British fascists in 1940, menial jobs for the women, but for younger men at least, a chance to bear arms from 1943.\n\nAfter the war Alice revisited Vienna, but like so many others, she felt a stranger there. She died in the US, but not before she had revived her cookery school in California. She eventually won the rights to her books back too, but because Austria was still officially ‘the first victim of Hitler’, this was a long drawn out process.\n\nI very much enjoyed Alice’s Book, particularly the descriptions of the curious Austrian ‘corporate state’: Chancellor Dollfuss’s Austro-Fascist creation. ‘German Austria’ was desperate to find an identity distinct from the Nazi pariah to the north. Although Austria was priest-ridden, it was not officially antisemitic at least; a truly visceral antisemitism was unleashed, however, even before Hitler’s troops arrived. The people of Vienna in particular threw up decades of suppressed hatred on the heads of a defenceless Jewish population as soon as they got a whiff of the German arrival.\n\nThere is actually very little in Alice’s Book about the theft of her intellectual rights, but that chapter is compelling. I was not completely ignorant of this robbery. My own godfather’s name was removed from the cover of his guide to the museum collections he managed in Eisenstadt, and on a rather grander scale the Nazis swiped all the money due to Felix Salten for Bambi, not to mention the compositions of the popular classical composer Erich Korngold. At least both escaped with their lives. Fritz Löhner-Beda, who wrote many of Lehar’s lyrics, was beaten to death in Auschwitz.\n\nI would have liked to know a bit more about the recipe books, which are not really explored. I am now keen to put my hands on Alice’s book - I am addicted to my Grosse Sacher Kochbuch to the degree that the spine is broken and many of the pages are falling out.\n\nAlice’s son Otto Durbach’s undercover work in US POW camps provides an episode which was new to me but the fact that Austrian and German Jews provided the muscle for the post-war occupation was not. The Jews made up about ninety percent of the people who could speak the language required to run the administration. Their hour had struck once more, but it should come as no surprise that very few of them chose to stay on. A certain bitterness had crept in, and it remains to this day.\n\nCatharsis at Schloss Weissenstein\n\nPosted: 16th January 2023\n\nA considerable high point in 2022 was my first visit to Schloss Weissenstein, one of Germany’s most magnificent baroque buildings, situated in the small village of Pommersfelden in Franconia. Actually, we went twice, but that was more by accident than design: I had neglected to look at the website and as a result we trundled off on the rare local bus from Bamberg only to discover the schloss was shut. I was crestfallen, not least because finding the means to cover the twenty kilometres back to town proved a nightmare. In the end, we were obliged to take an expensive taxi to the nearest railway station and our 9-Euro tickets did the rest. The alternative would have been grilling in the hot sun in a village entirely devoid of functioning restaurants, hotels or cafés while we waited till the late afternoon for the bus to return.\n\nHad we looked more carefully that Tuesday, we might have seen that at least the park behind the schloss was open. You simply had to pop a two-euro piece into a slot to operate the turnstile. There were plenty of old trees to provide a bit of shade in a proper English-style garden. The following day, after an extensive tour of the rococo interiors of Schloss Weissenstein, we did indeed make use of the park, as there were still no restaurants or cafés functioning for miles around.\n\nAccess to the park appears to have been possible at different times (perhaps always) in Schloss Weissenstein’s 300-year history, for it was during an ‘excursion’ to the former Prince-Bishop’s country palace that the writer E T A Hoffmann suffered a cathartic experience that changed his life and accelerated his transformation into the writer whom we know and love today.\n\nHoffmann was born in Protestant, East Prussian Königsberg in 1776. He had been an up-and-coming Prussian judge until 1806, working latterly in Warsaw which had been part of Prussia since the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. Prussia’s defeat at the hands of the French in the twin battles of Auerstedt and Jena changed all that. The country shrank and the number of senior judges required shrank with it. The thirty-year old Hoffmann had had some success as a composer and theatre director and he must have seen it as a chance to rise above the drudgery of the law and devote himself to art (he was a talented painter as well). When, two years later, he saw a job advertised to run the theatre in Catholic, South German Bamberg he applied.\n\nThe work, however, was not what it seemed. His task was that of an ill-paid maid of all chores. The only way he could keep dogsbody and soul together was by reviewing and teaching music. In 1810 he was employed by Franziska Mark, the widow of the American Consul Philipp Mark, to teach music to her two daughters, Julia and Wilhelmina. The Marks (originally ‘Marcus’) were a Jewish family from Gotha partly converted to Christianity. Hoffmann taught Julia piano and singing, and was captivated by her beautiful voice.\n\nHis marriage to his Polish wife Michalina (‘Mischa’) was exhausted. Their one child, Cecilia, had died in infancy. Julia was twenty years his junior, but that did not prevent the former magistrate from making a proper fool of himself through a misplaced obsession. Hoffmann himself feared it would end in madness and suicide. He confided to his diary on 28 February 1811 ‘The devil with this strange mood - I shall either shoot myself like a dog or go mad!’ To prevent Mischa from finding out, Hoffmann’s diary was written in German using the Greek alphabet, or embellished with large chunks of Latin.\n\nOn 18 March his feelings towards the girl had reached their highest point. Hoffmann lay in bed and masturbated, signing off with the observation that he had committed ‘spiritual adultery’. Julia was little aware of his obsession. An affair with a very young actress, whom he characterised as a ‘lightning conductor’, lightened the burden of his frustration.\n\nJulia turned sixteen in 1812 and her mother was keen to marry her to money. Her eyes lighted on a Hamburg merchant called Johann Gerhard Graepel. Julia confided to Hoffmann that she would never be happy with Graepel, but she did not disobey her mother. Hoffmann naturally could not abide his rival and he was not alone in his low opinion. His later publisher, Carl Friedrich Kunz said ‘Despite his youth, the fellow was the very picture of an old man, an emaciated brand of humanity, the marks of carnal desires stamped on his forehead, eyes, and cheeks, and the imbecility of his spirit shining through with every word he spoke.”\n\nOn Sunday 6 September 1812 Hoffmann was invited to join a Mark family excursion to Pommersfelden. They must have been luckier than we were, and found a place to eat and drink. Hoffmann wrote in his diary: We ‘got quite horribly drunk and I made the most awful fool of myself... [Julia] scolded her husband-to-be who was so drunk he fell over...’\n\nIn the evening they wanted to go for a last walk, probably in the still formal, baroque gardens at the back of the house, the ‘English’ garden being laid out only in the early nineteenth century. Kunz’s description is rather more revealing than Hoffmann’s: ‘with visible difficulty, the fiancé lifted himself from his seat, offering his arm to his future wife. Hoffmann and I wandered behind the couple while the rest of the party came along in clusters. Scarcely had we reached the courtyard of the schloss when the fiancé began to lose his balance, swerving one moment to the left and next to the right to the degree that his lady had difficulty keeping him upright. Then he lurched violently, looking as if he’d pull poor Julia to the ground. Hoffmann leapt forward to catch her while I tried to grasp the arm of the sinking man, but it was too late: they had fallen and the suitor lay on the ground with all four limbs in the air. Julia went pale and rubbed her hands together as the party assembled in a circle around her prostrate lover. Hoffmann glowed with anger, and turning to me, he uttered in a loud voice “Look, there lies that shit hound! We have all had a drink but we don’t behave like that! That sort of thing only happens to a common, prosaic fellow!” Everybody was horrified by what he had more shouted than spoken. Julia threw him a look of contempt, the mother joining in with some weighty epithets of her own... He stood for a while as if crushed, then came to his senses, walking away with quick, decisive steps.’\n\nKunz summed up: ‘that was the end of the love story.’ Everyone had been able to put two and two together and saw Hoffmann as a jealous and unsuitable rival. Hoffmann wrote a letter of apology to Franziska Mark the following day, but she had already formally banned him from the household.\n\nOn 10 August 1812, he wrote (this time in Italian) ‘The die is cast. The woman has become the wife of this damned ass of a tradesman and it seems to me that my whole musical and poetic life is snuffed out. I need to make a decision about what sort of man I believe myself to be. It is a diabolical day.’\n\nJulia married Graepel on 13 December. On 18 March 1813, Hoffmann signed a contract with Kunz to produce his first book Fantasy Pieces in Callot’s Manner. On 21 April he left Bamberg for pastures new. Once the French were chased from Prussia, he would return to the law as a judge on the Berlin Criminal Bench, but his fame grew more and more as a writer in those last nine years of his life. He died of syphilis, at the age of forty-six, in 1822. In many of those books, some of the greatest in the German language, Julia appears, sometimes disguised, sometimes as herself, the flame was never quite expunged.\n\nAs for Julia, her marriage to Graepel was short lived, and she married a second time to a cousin, before taking up residence in Munich. Some thirty years after that fateful day at Pommersfelden, Julia was interviewed about her relationship with Hoffmann. She rejected the idea of some sort of ‘low sensuality’ on Hoffmann’s part: ‘the influence he had on me kept me free from all the triviality of a banal girl infatuation’. ‘Everybody will have decided that I treated Hoffmann with contempt, but that cannot be true. I am still aware of how I bared my fear-filled inner thoughts to him.’\n\nComing Home\n\nPosted: 15th December 2022\n\nOn Saturday 10 December I flew to Knock to address a wine society Christmas dinner. The meal was on Sunday night and before it I spent a happy day in a sunny, but frigid Sligo exploring Yeats and Mountbatten memorabilia and megalithic tombs. My hosts drove me to the airport the next morning. Overnight a thick frost had descended on the land and the coppices looked like collections of Christmas trees thickly hung with crystals. The sky was clear, at least, and as we walked into the small airport at 10.30 am the flight was pronounced on time.\n\nIt was the beginning of my longest day, a Ulyssean epic of immense frustration and tedium. I had slept badly that night and was hoping to get away quickly so that I might snooze on the short flight back to Luton; but there was no news of the aircraft and searching around on the Internet I found out that it had not yet taken off. Every now and then the departure time would be put back, first to 3.00 pm, then four etc. The lounge became steadily fuller as all the flights were delayed. Worst hit seemed to be those going to London airports. It appeared that the city had had two hours of snow the night before, which had effectively destroyed air, road and rail communications.\n\nPeople are at their best in a crisis like this, even English people, who drop their reserve and share information; although it should be said that most of those I spoke to had Irish connections: mother, father, a married sister etc.. Like me they had been coming home. My father’s family had originally hailed from close to the spot where I had given my talk the night before. By four I had struck up a conversation with a philosophic man who was not only a mine of information on the history of Luton but he had been observing the behaviour of the travellers in the lounge, noting they had now shifted to the bar where they were drowning their sorrows in Guinness and vodka. When the flight was scrapped at four he told me he would go back to his sister’s and try again the next day. I thought of the imminent train strikes and decided to see what Ryanair would offer me as an alternative.\n\nThe 18.10 to Stansted was full. I could stay the night in Knock or I had a choice between flights to Edinburgh or the East Midlands. Still mindful of the strikes, I feared that even if flights took off the next day, I would have difficulty getting home from the airport. Edinburgh was out. I was told East Midlands was between Nottingham and Derby. I convinced myself there had to be trains to London from both. I opted for the East Midlands.\n\nI went back through security, weighed down by a litre of duty-free gin and a side of Sligo salmon. When I connected with home I was told there were problems with the trains and I might have been better off spending the night in Knock, but I had already changed my flight. I made a new friend in the lounge who lived in Northampton. We looked at the train connections. None seemed promising, but there was always the chance of a bus from a Nottingham or Derby.\n\nThe aircraft came in late. Departure was announced for 19.00. In the later afternoon Knock Airport had been enveloped in freezing fog, and every time the doors were opened a needling cold seeped in. We were eventually released to the plane. I was hemmed in beside two ailing passengers who coughed like seals. It was announced that we would not fly until the wings had been de-iced. This took an hour. I thought I might attempt sleep, but every time I did my neighbour barked in my ear. I resorted to E. T. A. Hoffmann. I was glad to find him in my pocket.\n\nI was aware of a crane perched above us, squirting liquid onto the wings, then at eight we finally began to move, seemingly guided towards the English Midlands by a fat moon. East Midlands Airport appeared immense with coloured lights lining the runways. I thought I would seek advice in the terminal, but there was no one to help. It occurred to me I could ask the man in the car-hire booth. He suggested a taxi, but there was no money for that. Then he said that Nottingham or Derby was the best bet as he thought a train unlikely, but agreed there might be something on offer from the bus station. I found an airport bus leaving for Nottingham. The driver told me that he would point out the way to the bus station. Meanwhile a woman I had spoken to in the airport had emailed her daughter who had found two trains leaving from Nottingham Station. Everyone was helpful in a way that would have been inconceivable in London.\n\nOne of the trains was at ten. When we approached the station I made a dash for it, but there were no trains. A boy suggested Leicester at 11.20. I couldn’t see any reason why I might be better off in Leicester. I asked about buses. He told me there was one at 3.00 am. I walked to the bus station.\n\nThe bus station was a gloomy, modern, concrete quadrangle under a car park and almost completely empty. I found a security guard who sent me to the ticket office. The window was closed but there were machines. A bus left for Heathrow at 1.45 am, but I wondered about getting in from Heathrow, and it was £66. The 3.00 am bus to London-Victoria was full, but there was another at 3.45 and that was half the price of Heathrow. I decided to wait for that.\n\nIt was now 10.20 pm and besides a slice of toast at breakfast and an air-bread sandwich in Knock Airport I had had nothing all day. I imagined I might find something to eat and drink, but between the Bus Station and the Railway Terminal Nottingham was shrouded in gloom. The only thing open was a chippie. I went in and ordered a small fish and chips. Only then did I understand what people meant when they said ‘cheap as chips’: it cost £5.50 and was so copious that I had trouble finishing it. They were closing, but they allowed me to stay after they locked the door so that I might eat my dinner in the warmth. One of the women offered to take me to a night club, but she thought I wouldn’t enjoy it much. So I traipsed back to the Bus Station to begin my vigil.\n\nThe security guard introduced me to his domain. There were hard metal seats, no dispensers of drinks of any sort, but there were clean lavatories. It was cold, but only draughty when the bays opened for the buses, of which there were a few, only local and airport buses until the Heathrow bus. There were probably no more than half a dozen people in the entire space. I read. I was conscious of the fact I needed to stay awake and it was quite cold, so from time to time I did a lap of the quadrangle. I eventually decided that where the long-distance buses came in was marginally warmer because there were more human bodies scattered around.\n\nI still had regular visits from the security guard, who wanted to know all about me. He clearly felt didn’t get many people of my sort in his bus station. There was also a woman who had come from Sheffield and was trying to get to Kent. She had been turfed off the train in Nottingham and had intended to spend the night in the station waiting for the 7.20 train to St Pancras. She was told they were going to lock up, and the warmest option was the Bus Station. I was mildly sceptical about the 7.20 train and suggested she take the bus to Victoria. It was good to talk to her because that way I did not feel so tempted to close my eyes.\n\nLittle clumps of people arrived for Glasgow, Heathrow and Huddersfield; mostly students travelling by night. It was a brave new world for me. At three I tried to get onto the London bus, but the driver said it really was full. It wasn’t so long till the 3.45, which came in early and the driver let me get on. The woman I had been talking to cracked at this point. She loaded her suitcase and came in and sat beside me. I slept all the way to Victoria getting in at 7.20 am. Unlike Nottingham, London was under a thick layer of snow but the tube was running and I was home by eight, only about twenty hours late.\n\nThe British in India\n\nPosted: 17th November 2022\n\nMy generation grew up on a diet of British nationalist history. My shelves are still full of it, from the majestic cloth bound volumes of Macaulay to the earlier emissions of the Oxford Monarch series. We all got to study this ‘Whig’ History at school and university, according to which, following a successful Protestant Reformation, English, and from 1707, ‘British’ history was just one long string of successes that has enriched the lives of the people of this island and beyond. As good students we challenged this interpretation.\n\nWhen it came to describing the empire created by the first Elizabeth, Whig historians passed it off as beneficial to the less favoured elements of mankind and one which helped them to come of age by basking in our light. Our former colonies had long since begun to disagree with this benign vision, and even before independence, nationalists, and even native British critics had begun to pull our legacy apart. We British did not stand for civilisation or even some pious and condescending notion of the ‘white man’s burden,’ we stood for the economic and moral exploitation of our subject peoples, whom we looked down on as inferior to ourselves.\n\nThe United States threw us out 250 years ago and the ‘white’ colonies, the former dominions Australia, Canada and South Africa, were like New England: to a greater or smaller extent, peopled from home. Their treatment was different: they were allowed to run their own show as soon as they were perceived to have grown to maturity. With one major exception, Britons did not put down roots in our intemperate African colonies. With the winds of change, we packed and left, depositing pseudo-Westminster style constitutions as we said goodbye. As ‘former colonial powers’ our motives for being there were pilloried, until Gallagher and Robinson’s Africa and the Victorians raised a few questions to modify the debate.\n\nAnd then there were some anomalies, like Ireland. Ireland was our first colony, the subjugation of an island in our own archipelago. From Tudor times, so the Irish nationalist line ran, English and Scots had impoverished the Irish people, stealing their land, reducing their liberties, suppressing their religion and imposing an alien ascendancy upon them. There is much truth in this. Even today it is hard to walk through the better preserved Georgian streets and squares of Dublin without coming to the conclusion that, magnificent though it all might be, this is the fruit of an alien culture that saw ‘wild’ Irish natives as little more than helots and cannon fodder.\n\nDespite the Penal Laws, Ireland, even Catholic Ireland, grew rich on the colonial trade in the eighteenth century; but after the Famine in the mid-nineteenth century, poor Irishmen and women came to the island of Great Britain to work as navvies, building roads and railways, while women toiled as laundresses or worse. Many settled, and their presence led to a proliferation of pubs and Catholic churches. Until thirty years ago they were disdained, but now a bit of Irish blood does not go amiss: it might even mean the right to an EU passport. Irish historians used to be quick to present the awfulness of British rule in lurid detail. The picture is more balanced now, and takes account of the widespread and sometimes highly creative fusion of the two worlds, English and Irish. It is more nuanced, but the central tenets remain.\n\nIf being Irish is less disadvantageous than it was, the British image of India and Indians has also changed. For the time being at least, we have our first Hindu prime minister in Rishi Sunak, and educated at Winchester and Oxford too. Neither Ireland nor India was considered mature enough to be offered dominion status before independence. The Indian version of the Ascendancy was the Raj, which was in many aspects more sympathetic towards Indians than the Ascendancy had been towards the Irish. British rule in the Subcontinent was certainly patronising, occasionally cruel and maybe exploitative, but in general they were more considerate.\n\nI have been reading Roderick Matthews’ Peace, Poverty and Betrayal: A New History of British India. I should say that I know Matthews, well; nearly half a century ago we were two of twelve historians in our college, and two of the nine who went on to sit Schools three years later. He did spectacularly well, but decided to drop history in favour of music, in which he worked until he became disillusioned a decade ago. At that point he returned to history and now concentrates on India.\n\nIndia has probably more nationalist historians than all the other former British colonies put together. In a long and magisterial overview, Matthews proceeds to cut them down to size. He does this not to repolish the image of British India, but because he is convinced that many of these arguments are misconceived. Matthews believes that you cannot write the history of British India without reference to what was going on at home. Indeed, context is vital everywhere: the Easter Rebellion has to be seen in the light of the Western Front, and the looming Battle of the Somme.\n\nThe book blows away the clouds and cobwebs of Indian historiography. ‘Divide and rule’ is debunked: it becomes ‘oblige and rule.’ India was too divided to start with, between dynasties and sects, castes, regions and creeds. Constitutional change and independence would have happened a lot sooner if there had not been so many factions to satisfy. Ultimately there was no way of uniting the elements: Partition was the result, and the invasion of the princely states by the Indian army after 1947. Many Indians happily collaborated with the British from the beginning. They were complicit in the process of preparing the country for self-government. Unlike Ireland, the British did not appropriate land and Indians increased their holdings, nor did the British settle in India, apart from a few mixed-race Anglo-Indians in UP after Independence.\n\nThe British brought with them Whig ideas current after the 1689 Revolution. These found their philosophic basis in the writings of John Locke. Here ‘Whig’ ideas mean something different: pragmatism, and a desire to create and enjoy wealth in an environment of civil peace without reforming the fundamental rules of society. It was colonisation of the weakest sort. Also unlike Ireland, the idea of bringing enlightenment to India absorbed liberals like the philosopher John Stuart Mill’s father James in the East India Company’s offices in the City. Legal codes were drawn up for India that had no echo in England while Macaulay applied himself to creating a modern education for Indians. Missionaries might have been active, but the government did not encourage evangelisation. The result Matthews calls ‘liberal authoritarianism’, but it might have been the work of say, Frederick the Great, or some other enlightened despot in Europe.\n\nMatthews confines himself largely to the political and economic picture. This is perhaps the weakness of the book. There is little said about the men on the ground: Thomas Hickey-style wastrels or buccaneers, some of whom went native before 1857, or the second-rate public school-types who became a feature of the Raj after the 1857 Uprising; the Haileybury boys, or the bright Indian students who came to Britain to compete with British candidates in their desire join the Indian Civil Service (ICS). The ICS is, however, covered beautifully by David Gilmour in his recent book The British in India. Matthews deals with the movers and shakers in Calcutta, Delhi and Westminster. Some administrators and merchants made money, but not all; that wasn’t really the point. You will also find no detailed account of events like the Black Hole of Calcutta because Matthews would see it as a minor incident blown up out of all proportions by propagandists on both sides.\n\nAfter 1857 came imperialism, but Matthews points out that this is far from being the Hobson/Lenin idea of ‘the last stage of capitalism’, but some sort of synthesis of British and Indian culture revelling in empire with Durbars and much pomp following the assumption by Queen Victoria of India’s imperial throne in succession to the Mughals. In those last ninety years before Independence in 1947, a conservative administration faced organised opposition with repression and bloodshed. Again Matthews spares us the gory details, but if you are interested you will find them in Geofffrey Moorhouse’s gruelling book Calcutta which takes the story on to the time when the British really went home: in the late sixties.\n\nBack in Britain nationalist history is almost dead now. It survives, perhaps, only in the school textbooks commissioned by Michael Gove when he was Minister of Education. Endless books and dissertations assault the Whig interpretation in microscopic detail and stress what diverse genders and races have done over the past centuries. Some of this might be misconceived too. It is a feature of our own post-imperial blood-letting, and with time that will also be subjected to revision.\n\nThe Trouble with Ludwig\n\nPosted: 17th October 2022\n\nI didn’t know Bavaria well before this year, I’d been to Munich a few times, but that was more or less where it ended. The Wittelsbach family, which ruled the roost from 1186 - 1918, I knew rather more about, but always in the broad context of German history. They had never been my consuming study.\n\nLast summer turned out to be largely about Ludwig II, the so-called ‘Mad King’. Unlike the droves of tourists that flock to Neuschwanstein every year, I had felt no compunction to visit his castles, which are at a good distance from Munich anyway. Some thirty years ago I reviewed a biography of him that was quite the silliest book I had read in ages. Not much has changed: in Füssen, Neuschwanstein’s nearest town, I saw a bookshop that had dedicated a whole vitrine to Ludwig. I wondered how many of the very many books about him were impartial. Many romanticise the friendship between him and his cousin Sissy, or put him on a pedestal as a ‘gay icon’. As it was I did find useful books in the stack and even invested in a cheap copy of Michael Petzet’s beautiful book on Ludwig’s castles: Gebaute Träume (Dream Buildings).\n\nThe Wittelsbachs are crucial to the understanding of Ludwig. They are in some way the Catholic, South German pendant to the Protestant Prussian Hohenzollerns. They started out obscure, but became major players by hitching their vessel to the Habsburgs in Vienna and the Bourbons in Versailles. They had a trump card over the Hohenzollerns in that they could claim two Holy Roman Emperors: the first, Ludwig the Bavarian, died in 1347, some hundred years before the Habsburg’s became quasi-hereditary emperors. It is significant that Ludwig the Bavarian’s tomb in the Munich Frauenkirche was rehoused in sumptuous renaissance garb in 1622; just when the Wittelsbachs stood at the right hand of the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years War.\n\nThe first significant duke was William V, who brought the Jesuits to Munich. A wise policy of making themselves useful in Vienna meant the dukes were rewarded with one of the seven imperial electorships in 1621. After that, marriages to Habsburg princesses ensured a prominent seat on the board: Maximilian I to Maria Anna, Max Emanuel to Maria Antonia, Charles Albert to Maria Amalia. A measure of Bourbon blood also lubricated alliances with Louis XIV’s France. When Elector Max Emanuel was badly bruised at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 he was forced into exile. His son Charles Albert knew it could be Bavaria’s moment when the Habsburgs died out in the male line. Emperor Charles VI expired in 1740 and he seized his opportunity. Again with French help, he claimed the imperial throne. He was crowned by his brother Clemens August, Archbishop of Cologne in 1742, but Austria invaded Bavaria and a chastened Charles Albert died in 1745. He was succeeded as Emperor by Francis of Lorraine, husband of Charles VI’s daughter Maria Theresa.\n\nThe French proved benevolent again in 1806, making the Elector Max I Joseph King of Bavaria. At last, the Wittelsbachs enjoyed equal status with the Prussians, who became kings a century before. In 1848, an expensive taste for building and autocratic ways meant Max’s son Ludwig I lost his throne. The Bavarian government imposed severe restrictions on the Wittelsbachs, and created a constitution and a civil list. Ludwig II was heir to at least one of Ludwig I’s passions\n\nLudwig loved his grandfather a lot more than his father Max II, who had married the Prussian Princess Marie. Max’s unexpected death in 1864 brought Ludwig to the throne at the tender age of eighteen. For Ludwig, the throne was an empty chalice. He wanted to be a proper king, not some sort of bargain-basement constitutional monarch, and he wished to build big like his grandfather. He also desired Wagner to come to his court, and receive all the encouragement due to the man who had inspired the king’s childhood with his settings of Lohengrin and Tannhäuser. All this required cash. Unfortunately for Ludwig there wasn’t enough. He had to borrow, and that meant debt. He also had to keep his grandfather, who lived on until 1868. It is significant that it was from then that Ludwig’s own buildings began to rise from the ground.\n\nAt first he ‘cooperated’ with constitutional kingship, inspected troops and visited wounded men. He resented Prussia’s rise to dominance in what was to be the new German Empire, yet he signed the ‘Kaiserbrief’ granting assent to his cousin William becoming emperor rather than him. Bismarck had successfully bought him off using the ‘Welfenfonds’, the money he had taken from the Hanoverian Treasury in 1866. And yet Bismarck was also surprisingly generous in his assessment of Ludwig, whom he did not believe to be mad.\n\nWagner was spectacularly greedy, and within a year Ludwig’s ministers had him banished. As Ludwig saw less and less to please him in his office, he became nocturnal, spent a good deal of time alone or in the company of a few trusted companions and servants. He was preoccupied by his building projects. His grandfather had been an urban planner who had turned the mostly mediaeval city of Munich into a neo-classical gem filled with boulevards and squares. In his dealings with artists and architects, Ludwig II was as fastidious and difficult as his grandfather. There were Prussian precedents too: Ludwig’s cousin Frederick William IV was a depressive like Ludwig, also possessing a mania for building. He finished the mediaeval cathedral in Cologne, ‘restored’ castles on the Rhine and employed the great Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Frederick the Great was another ancestor who built exquisite villas and was allergic to courts like Ludwig. He was homosexual as well. Indeed homosexuality galloped in the Hohenzollern family. Ludwig may have owed more to his mother than he cared to admit.\n\nLudwig rebuilt his quarters in the Munich Residence, and made a spectacular Winter Garden complete with leaking lake and had to be removed. His legacy is now reduced to three ‘castles: The Linderhof, Herrenchiemsee and Neuschwanstein plus a number of smaller building projects in their purlieus. I was dreading them, but my initial scepticism has to some extent abated. The Linderhof is a neo-rococo villa, Ludwig’s version of Frederick’s Sanssouci. Ludwig saw the rococo as a Bavarian national style, and it is true that Bavarian rococo is as good as it gets. The key to enjoying it is the exquisite detail, all of which was chosen by the king. It was Ludwig’s ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’, his answer to his idol Wagner. The Linderhof is the most successful of Ludwig’s creations, but it is hugely cluttered. Hohenchiemsee, his reproduction of Versailles in the middle of a lake, is the most quixotic. It was a tribute to his Bourbon ancestors, absolute kings, the ones he liked best; but Versailles was built so that Louis XIV could keep an eye on his nobles, Ludwig didn’t want the nobility anywhere near him.\n\nLike Hohenchiemsee, Neuschwanstein remains unfinished. As elsewhere Ludwig used stage architects to design his castles for theatrical effect, and sometimes they look too much like sets. That is true of Neuschwanstein from the outside at least, and it is not for nothing that it inspired Disney. Inside, however, it had me thinking a bit about Ruskin and William Morris. Every detail in the castle is individually designed and executed, perhaps not by the greatest craftsmen, but they were good, and the king managed to feed work to the Bavarian artisans of Nymphenburg, even if some of them must have had to sing for payment.\n\nBuilding was Ludwig’s creative drive, and any attempt to cap it was bound to end in tears. I shall refrain from offering any theory about his early death: Ludwig’s refusal to adapt to the new age would have nailed him to the cross in the end. The audit was just a matter of time. On Lake Starnberg this summer I chanced upon the annual mass to celebrate Ludwig’s life at the place where it ended. The president of King Ludwig Association gave a speech extolling the virtues of the monarch: he was pious, creative, peace-loving and had a place in his heart for little people. The sad reality is that Ludwig’s sole achievement was those castles in the sky and that the palaces of that Greta Garbo of kings, the great misanthrope, are now poked and prodded by the sort of charabanc-borne vulgarians who might have driven him to an even more premature despair.\n\nOberammergau\n\nPosted: 20th September 2022\n\nIn Munich Airport the man scrutinised my passport before he reached for the stamp: he wanted to know why I had been in Germany so often and over such a short period of time. ‘The Passion Play at Oberammergau’, I blurted out, adding ‘I’ve been three times.’\n\nHe laughed: clearly nobody goes to the Passion Play three times. It is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. You might go twice, but in the last instance only after a fifty year gap. Obergammergau is like Hajj, or walking to Compostella. You are under no obligation to repeat the experience.\n\nI often remember the first time I heard about Oberammergau. I was doing O-Level German at school. I thought it sounded frightful, and hoped, fervently, that I would never be obliged to attend. Then, back in 2018 I signed up to convey six groups to the Passion Play, but after the Covid plague postponed it for two years, my tours were whittled down to first four, then three.\n\nAs it was, I had been present at an Oberammergau lunch in London earlier that year. I sat next to the director, Christian Stückl and met Frederik Mayet who had been his principal Jesus in 2010 and was again in 2022. I mentioned my cousin, the actor August Zirner. Stückl was astonished to hear he was related to me. Augi was playing Nathan in his production of Lessing’s Nathan the Wise in Munich. The next thing I knew Stückl had clamped his telephone to my ear. Augi was on the other end of the line. Stückl said he liked using Augi to play Nathan because he was half-Jewish. In the same way, he was pleased to report that there were now some Syrians living in Oberammergau and he was looking forward to using genuine Middle-Easterners on stage. He took the leading members of the cast to the Holy Land to breath in the atmosphere and bits of Hebrew had been scattered round the text to emphasise the fact that everyone in the action was Jewish. During his forty-six-year tenure as director of the Passion Play, Stückl has tried to make it more authentic and less antisemitic.\n\nThere is no disputing the fact that, until recently, the Passion Play was thoroughly antisemitic. The Gospels hold the Jews responsible for Christ’s Crucifixion. There were probably lots of passion plays in mediaeval and early modern Europe. Oberammergau’s was first performed in 1634 in the middle of the Thirty Years War. Bavaria was overrun by two plagues: one literal, the other Swedish squaddies, who put large tracts of Germany to the torch. The Alpine village of Oberammergau had been spared, but in 1632 one Kaspar Schisler arrived and infected the population, a sixth of whom succumbed. The village decided to put on a passion play every ten years and as the Prologue tells you ‘since that time no single person has died.’\n\nThe play was performed in the cemetery of Oberammergau’s gorgeous rococo church until 1900, when the present neoclassical stage was built. The text was established by Father Joseph Daisenberger in 1858, and is easily distinguishable from later additions by the fact it is in verse and slightly archaic German. Similarly the original music with its many allusions to Mozart’s Don Giovanni and Haydn was written by Rochus Dedler (1779 - 1822), and I suspect the more Bach-like additions are the work of Markus Zwink. It is part passion and part mystery play, and the events of that fateful week in Jerusalem are broken up by tableaux vivants from the Old Testament using actors and actresses and framed by Stefan Hageneier.\n\nI presume that before the nineteenth century, the play was much more rustic, but many of the creases have been ironed out in the last 150 years. The two men who chiefly contributed to its fame were the misanthropic King Ludwig II of Bavaria (the so-called ‘Mad King’) who watched the whole show in 1871 together with four courtiers, and the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, who saw the same performance. After Bertie went the mountains were alive with middle-class British sycophants. By 1890, Thos Cook was doing a roaring trade. Special trains took parties of Britons to the play, who made up seventy percent of the audience.\n\nFor the 300th anniversary, Oberammergau had a distinguished guest in the form of Adolf Hitler. Hitler didn’t enjoy the play which he thought the wrong sort of antisemitism. He believed in the racial, biological form, which was not represented. The only thing he approved was Pilate, a man of superior race and intelligence, he thought. Oberammergau was divided at the time between Nazis and members of the Catholic Bavarian People’s Party. Fortunately for its subsequent reputation there were not many Jews in the village, although one was despatched to Dachau. The 1934 performance was the last before 1950, when the play was reestablished.\n\nThe Passion Play is an amateur performance and a fiefdom of the large village of Oberammerau. There are 6,000 inhabitants of whom 2,000 are involved in some way as actors, singers, musicians or in ancillary roles. Stückl is no exception: he is the son of a publican who started out carving wood - then the only other thing to do in Oberammergau, although it has to be said that the village makes plenty of money out of skiing and tourism too. Stückl has actually made a big name for himself now. He runs two ensembles in Munich, and has directed plays and opera all over the German-speaking world.\n\nLike Bayreuth, perhaps, since the Second World War, Oberammergau has had to be careful to conform to the Zeitgeist. I suspect most visitors are still Christians and the revised theology is by no means revolutionary. When I commented to my neighbour that something Jesus said to Judas was new to me, an American on the other side gave me the Gospel reference, chapter and verse. So an inferior Galilean Jew, Jesus arrives in Jerusalem seeking social justice at a time when Judean Jews are at loggerheads with their Roman overlords. The Romans, in their turn, look down on the Judeans. Jesus has not come at a good time. The stage erupts into factions, Jesus has his gang, with support from Judeans like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, while Caiaphas has the weight of his fellow high priests who decide that Jesus is a blasphemer claiming to be the son of God and take him prisoner by hoodwinking Judas. Jesus is tortured and crucified, but the play ends as the Angel reminds the Christians of the joys of redemption and resurrection.\n\nIt lasts fully five hours, but there is a long break for dinner. It is certainly a magnificent spectacle: the massing of villagers on stage, the Jews in their pastel shades, the Romans in armour and the choir in black and white looking like the Amish are joined numerous animals from donkeys to camels, via sheep and goats. In one performance the goats butted the sheep and had a little fight echoing that between the Jews and the Christians. The inevitable droppings provide a moment of light relief. The choir was magnificent, but the soloists (there were five of each as performances run four times a week from May to October) could be disappointing. I experienced at least one bad tenor, one poor bass, a disappointing alto and a squawking soprano, while others rendered the music in a fine score really well. Mayet was an aggressive, strutting Jesus, sharp of movement and delivery, but I think that was intentional. Some of the acting was frankly bad: I had a good Caiaphas and a poor Mary Magdalene, but, I reminded myself more than once, this was not a professional performance and a little rusticity must be par for the course.\n\nI don’t know if the next performance will be in 2030 or 2032, but I don’t imagine I shall be called upon to go again. Did it measure up to the frightful image I had over half a century ago? I would say not, and I am glad I saw it. As is generally the case, I saw different things every time I went, but that being said: once is enough.\n\nDog Days in Paris\n\nPosted: 18th August 2022\n\nLast week I finally went to Paris to see my mother. It was a trip I had been putting off for some time, not least because all my Paris friends have moved away and I have nowhere now to stay. For once, however, the circumstances looked right: a friend had lent me his flat in Clichy where two quiet days were promised, and all I had to do was to scrape together the fares for Eurostar.\n\nBut it was August, and Paris is another place in August. On 15 July every year Paris decamps to coast and country and while some Parisians return on 15 August, many do not reappear until the end of the month. That means a lot of the city is closed and restaurants, bars, bakers, candlestick makers, they are not there. It was never the time to see friends because they would have left the city as well. In August in Paris you are on your own.\n\nI had a few plans, a few things I was hoping to track down, when I set out late on Monday night. Then when I was passing Rochester Cathedral and Keep I was suddenly overcome by a terrible dread: had I taken the friend’s keys? I scrambled around in the bottom of my travel bag: no keys. A call home confirmed it. They were on the chair where I had left them. The remaining time in the train was spent rummaging in my mind for a solution when there clearly was none: I would arrive at the Gare du Nord at 11.15 pm local time, it would be steaming hot and I would have nowhere to sleep. The only sensible answer was to try one of the many seedy hotels opposite the station. You don’t trail from pillar to post at that time of night and certainly not in that part of Paris.\n\nAs it was the ‘New’ Hotel had a clean room with a shower and air conditioning, and that was more or less where it ended. In my twenties I spent a great deal of time dossing down in cheap Paris hotels. Not much had changed, except they were no longer cheap. The next day I had a grand’ crème and a croissant in a local bar and braved 35 Celsius on my short walk to the 95 bus, that took me, in a roundabout sort of way, via a number of train termini, to Montparnasse.\n\nI spent some three hours in the first of these, my two planned visits, and then joined an Australian friend who by chance had signalled that he was going to be in Paris at the same time as me. We had a pleasant late lunch in the boulevard Edgar Quinet before I caught the 39 bus in the rue de Rennes, that would take me back to the Gare du Nord in a less circumlocutious way. It is wonderful how Paris unfolds from its mediaeval hub, to the faubourgs, where the grandees decamped from the seventeenth century onwards and finally the great cavernous apartment blocks put up from the beginning of the Second Empire until the First World War. The 39 bus revealed it all: the rue de Rennes is Second Empire, then from St Germain onwards you are in the ancient core. There are grand palaces on the Quai Voltaire before you reach the Louvre, then it’s back to the Second Empire in the avenue de l’Opéra before you hit the Faubourgs and where occasionally an eighteenth century palace appears. You enter the railway age with the Gares de l’Est and du Nord. The latter is distinctly slummy at least on its eastern side. In the past decade the flavour has become Indian, and there are lots of curry places to choose from.\n\nI collapsed on my bed. Physical exhaustion had finally cancelled out the emotional strain of the morning and I went to sleep. At seven or so I braved the heat again. The sun was going down as I walked up the rue de Dunkerque and on to the rue des Martyres. For decades I might have found friends, a meal and a bed there, but that is no more. I looked up at the flat. I recognised the ironwork on the balcony from the drawing I made for them when they bought their new house near Bordeaux. The street was once a simple market street, but has now become impossibly chic. There were a lot of children out enjoying their ices now that the heat had finally begun to abate.\n\nI stopped at a little Chinese place off the rue Mauberge for some dinner and a half of rosé, astonished how quickly they throw the food together, then I went back to my room and fiddled with the television for a while: France was burning.\n\nThe next day abided by the same pattern: coffee near the station and then the 39 Bus followed by three hours with my mother in Montparnasse. I did some shopping for her in the market. I needed to get her some butter and popped into a place I used to use in the rue du Montparnasse. At the time I was convinced that the owners were Armenians. There was a girl of about thirty with a cruel wit. The interior had changed: the counter had gone. An elderly man told me he had acquired the shop in 1984. I asked about his predecessors. He told me they were Tunisian Jews. When I left my mother I decided I’d have a little walk down memory lane, despite the great heat. There on the boulevard was the studio where I learned to etch, and opposite the Théàtre de Poche, above which I lived on and off for several years. Over there on the ground floor, opposite the big brutalist UGC cinema was George Hayim’s Paris flat (he had similar spaces in London and Sydney). Hayim was a fascinating character, who used elaborate wall-paintings to lure in burly men from the cinema queue and treat them to exquisite meals. Sometimes he’d also ask them to rough him up a bit, but it was nothing strenuous and they’d leave with their bellies full and a hundred francs in their pockets.\n\nI walked down the rue du Monparnasse, passed the private Collège Stanislas. They were adapting a chapel building I hadn’t seen before. Inside the courtyard I glimpsed the Hôtel de Silène, a lovely neoclassical villa. In the rue Notre Dames des Champs, there was the large rococo Hôtel de Mailly, now part of the military diocese. In the Rue de Rennes I looked at 106 Bis, where I spent many happy hours. The building had a complicated floor-plan, which meant many of the rooms looked out over the boulevard Raspail. It was getting even hotter and I sat for a while in St German des Prés, recovering.\n\nThere was an attractive little tabac on the rue Bonaparte. I gave in and went inside. I was hungry and got the man to make me a rillettes sandwich with a cornichon. He clattered about, dropping things on the floor. It was beer I wanted most and he was quick to top me up. The barman was fascinated by a Franco-Chinese family whose children spoke French to their father and Chinese to their mother. An Australian couple came in looking for menthol cigarettes. I had to translate for them, prompting a conversation about languages with the barman. I popped round to look at La Palette in the rue de Seine. It was the first Paris bar I made my own in 1974. Jean-François was a waiter then, later he became one of the most famous patrons in Paris. He must be retired now, or worse? I see that La Palette was sold in 2009.\n\nI walked to the rue du Bac, where I lived in a cramped studio for a while, and then over the bridge to pick up the 39 in the Louvre. When I got back to my hotel I collapsed again. I called the friend near Bordeaux: it was 39 degrees and he said it was only pleasant between five and eight in the morning. It was still boiling at seven when I went down to the Marché St Quentin. I might have bought a few things to take home, but there was no fridge in my crummy room, and there would not have been much left of it by the morning. I went to the Terminus Nord, which was offering a cheap menu with a choice of three starters and three main courses. It was a chance to sit in that lovely art deco dining room and enjoy the ballet performed by the waiters with their platters piled high with oysters and lobsters. When I emerged the African men had all congregated outside the local cafés with collections of beer bottles to enjoy a balmy evening. I went to bed with the prospect of an early train back to London.\n\nRococo Variations\n\nPosted: 18th July 2022\n\nThe rococo style is the last phase of the baroque, an explosion of theatricality and music in religious and secular architecture that bloomed in around 1720 and finally made way for a sober neo-classicism in around 1780.\n\nIt was not uniquely German, even if the Germans have some claim to calling it a national style. It is not uniquely Catholic either, but the greatest concentration of rococo is to be found in Catholic South and West Germany. Protestant rococo is above all a secular style best represented by palace buildings like the Zwinger in Dresden, or Frederick the Great’s Sanssouci in Potsdam.\n\nIndeed, the origins of rococo lie in France, where it was a decorative style employed at Versailles in the first years of the eighteenth century. The asymmetrical motifs derived from bird wings and crustaceans were available to copy from the manuals published by Oppenordt and Meissonier. Many of rococo’s greatest masters were from the Catholic Low Countries, such as the Munich court dwarf, François Cuvilliés who produced such stunning work in white and gold at the Munich town palace as well as the gems of the Amalienburg and Badenburg at the summer palace of Nymphenburg; but if the first great rococo craftsmen were imported, the Germans caught up fast, producing such notable fraternal groups as the Asams, Zimmermanns, Dientzenhofers and Schmuzers.\n\nRococo, like baroque, was an architectural handmaiden to the Counter Reformation. Baroque emerged to fight the Reformed religion at the end of the Council of Trent in 1563 and found its first expression north of the Alps in the Jesuit Church in Munich twenty years later. The baroque was to be the ‘theatre of god’ while the Reformed church pushed for a reductio ad nihilum: the illusion and excessive decoration of baroque interiors were so many dirty words. There is a very good demonstration of this in the Minster in Lindau on Lake Constance, which sits cheek by jowl with the local Lutheran church. There are a few rococo flourishes in the Protestant church, but there is no trompe l’oeil - no heaven, if you like. Everything comes from the word, and is delivered from the pulpit.\n\nThe Thirty Years War effectively stopped any creativity in Germany from 1618 to 1648. There was no art or architecture, and precious little literature. When it ended South Germany was rebuilt in a baroque style. Early examples are the Basilica of St Lorenz in Kempten and the Theatiner court church in Munich. That early baroque was Italian in style, but the slow progression to full throated rococo was visible in the three Munich churches I explored the other morning: the Theatiner, the Dreifaltigkeit (Trinity) and St Nepomuk. At the Theatiner it was represented by the odd altar or confessional. The Trinity has been described as ‘the purest Italian building in South Germany’, like a small Roman church, but inside it is a rococo ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’ where decoration, fresco and stucco are indivisible. Cosmas Damian Asam did the frescos in the cupola, a sine qua non in rococo churches, and like the rest, was often pure illusion: a trompe l’oeil dome painted on a flat wooden ceiling. Later he and his brother Egid Quirin built St Nepomuk - the ‘Asam Church’, possibly the most striking small rococo gem in all Germany.\n\nThe Asams spent two years in Rome as part of their training, and the dark Asam Church is still quite Berniniesque. The Zimmermann Brothers were all white light and gold. Much of the style of South German rococo was dictated by the school at Wessobrunn Abbey. Wessobrunn trained dozens of stuccateurs (‘plasterers’ seems a bit too banal to describe this refined ornament) between 1600 and 1803, when Bavaria’s monasteries were dissolved and much of Wessobrunn demolished. What remains in the Abbot’s and Prince’s Wings is mostly baroque, with a few rococo flourishes in the saloons. Wessobrunn stucco is chiefly white, but some is Wessobrunn green, where the gypsum is mixed with ground malachite and quickly worked into fantastic forms. Marble columns are merely polished stucco, because they could be coloured to suit the design, but they support no entablature. Nothing in mere nature could equal the artifice produced by the stuccateurs.\n\nWhen I was at Wessobrunn a few days ago I decided to pop into the plain parish church. In rococo architecture an unassuming exterior is no indication of modesty within. I am glad I did, for it is enchanting, and the purest rococo imaginable; a profusion of the usual ribs, straps, baskets, laurel, acanthus, putti with the other standbys such as fruit, vegetables, weaponry and musical instruments. The craftsmen involved were Joseph Schmuzer and his son Franz Xaver. Another major school of stucco was based in the Vorarlberg in Habsburg territory to the south. St Gallus in Bregenz is a fine example of the Vorarlberg style.\n\nLast week I travelled the whole pilgrimage route from Munich to Bregenz. The first stop was Andechs where Johann Baptist Zimmermann painted the ceilings. Much was destroyed after the dissolution of the Bavarian monasteries, but the magnificence of the surviving church was striking. Another monastery shorn of most of its buildings in 1803 was the Premonstratensian Steingaden. When the church was rebuilt after a visitation of Swedes during the 30 Years War, the idiom was a chaste-ish baroque, but in 1740 the stuccateurs arrived and filled the nave with stucco, framing ceiling paintings by Johann Georg Bergmüller. The basilica in Kempten was another church rebuilt immediately after the 30 Years War, and once again it had been partly rococosiert in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe quality of the work rarely disappoints. The painting of Joseph Schmuzer at Oberammergau is rightly celebrated. Schmuzer also beautified the little church of St Martin in Bad Kohlgrub up in the mountains. Dominikus Zimmermann was responsible for the glorious interiors of the church in the little walled town of Schongau where we also stayed. The brothers Johann Baptist (he painted the frescos) and Dominikus Zimmermann’s greatest work and perhaps the most wonderful halt on the German pilgrimage trial is the elliptical church at Wies. Designed as a shrine between 1745 and 1754, it has been described as the ‘dance floor of God.’ The paintings are didactic as usual, conferring information to pilgrims and parishioners, but the effect is uplifting and joyful, and the attention to detail is phenomenal, from what is possibly the most beautiful pulpit ever conceived and stretching to the pews, altar rails and confessionals, it is one tremendous, unified work of art.\n\nWho Made Munich?\n\nPosted: 15th June 2022\n\nMunich was made by the Wittelsbachs, since 1186, dukes, electors and finally kings of Bavaria. Some might add Adolf Hitler, who had a special affection for the city that he had made his home as a penniless painter in 1913. It was the cradle of the Nazi ‘movement’, but his embellishments were largely swept away to please the Americans after 1945 and he might more properly be seen as the man who caused the destruction of most of Munich by unleashing the Second World War in 1939.\n\nMunich is a relatively young city, founded in 1180. Like Berlin there had been no Roman settlement, and it was only in the later middle ages that the Wittelsbachs adopted it as their ‘Residenz’. The oldest buildings in Munich now are the gates, which were constructed in the fourteenth century and the first monument with any claim to distinction is the late fifteenth century Frauenkirche. The bishop was away in Freising and it was only later that Munich became the seat of a bishop and archbishop.\n\nThe first truly significant building in the city was the Jesuit College and church, commissioned by Duke William V and built by Friedrich Sustris in imitation of Il Gesu in Rome and begun only fifteen years later than that model Jesuit church. The finished college was far grander than the royal palace. The Jesuit church was an assertion of Bavaria’s Catholicism at the time of the Counter Reformation and religious wars in Germany. Bavaria threw in their support for the Habsburg emperors in Vienna. In 1632, loyalty points paid off and earned the duke of Bavaria the title of ‘elector’, one of the shortly-to-be-eight German archbishops and secular rulers possessing the right to choose the emperor. This change of status made the Wittelsbachs all the keener to beautify their capital in the baroque idiom of the time. Survivals are the magnificent court Theatinerkirche and Schloss Schliessheim. The first Nymphenburg Palace outside Munich was also from then but was later rebuilt under the Elector Charles Albert. It also meant that their status had improved enough to conclude alliances and marriages with both the Habsburgs and the French Bourbons. The Elector Maximilian II Emanuel married Maria Antonia, daughter of Emperor Leopold I, but Maximilian Emanuel sided with the French in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the French and Bavarian armies were soundly defeated by the combined Imperial and British forces at Blenheim on 13 August 1704 (in German it is called the Battle of Hochstädt). Defeat led to Max Emanuel’s banishment from Bavaria.\n\nHis son Charles Albert married Maria Amalia, daughter of the Habsburg Emperor Joseph I. Joseph’s brother the Emperor Charles VI, whose one son died in infancy, bequeathed two daughters and a ‘Pragmatic Sanction’ when he died in 1740. The Sanction allowed the oldest, Maria Theresa, to assume control of the Habsburg family lands. That meant however, that the Holy Roman Empire was up for grabs. Frederick II (‘the Great’) of Prussia marched into Silesia, and with French help, Charles Albert of Bavaria stormed into Austria. As the son of one Habsburg princess and the husband of another, he thought he had the best claim. In 1742 he had himself crowned Holy Roman Emperor, but the Austrians had already marched into Bavaria and seized Munich. He was dethroned in 1745, and Maria Theresa’s husband, Francis of Lorraine, become Holy Roman Emperor. The pantomime emperor Charles Albert died the following year.\n\nAll of which may appear a bit convoluted, but Charles Albert’s imperial longings made him want to make an even more splendid Munich. Baroque was on the wane, rococo would become his style. From 1726 onwards he set about transforming his home town. The rambling city Residenz was provided by new tracts of buildings. The Flemish François Cuvilliés was the best of his architects along with Egid Quirin Asam who built the fantastic St Johann Nepomuk church in the Sendlinger Strasse. Cuvilliés was the author of magnificent interiors in the Residenz as well as the exquisite court theatre. Nymphenburg was worked over in the rococo style and the jewel-like Amalienburg built for Charles Albert’s hunting-mad Habsburg wife.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Munich was still a mediaeval city surrounded by walls. Bavaria’s electors were courting the French again, and for their pains in 1803 they were awarded the territories that comprised Franconia to compensate the Wittelsbachs for the French annexation of the Palatinate. The greatest moment of all occurred in 1806 when the Wittelsbachs joined the select coterie of German kings. The first King Max made some positive additions to Nymphenburg in a neoclassical idiom and Carl von Fischer produced some fine buildings while Ludwig von Sckell transformed the city’s parks. The real Augustus of Munich was, however, Ludwig I, who acceded to the throne of Bavaria in 1826 and believed himself the perfect personification of a creative patron. Munich was opened out to the north, new boulevards and open spaces were created both in a neoclassical idiom as in the galleries on the Königsplatz and in his favourite ‘Rundbogen’ or ‘round arch’ style that was derived from the Florentine renaissance. His chief architects were Leo von Klenze and Friedrich von Gärtner. Just like our own John Nash, the architects designed the facades of the palaces that lined the boulevards, behind them the owner of the plot had to decide just what sort of luxury he proposed to live in.\n\nLudwig spent a king’s ransom on building, painting and sculpture, and a bit more on his Irish mistress Lola Montez. When the revolution erupted in Munich in 1848, the spendthrift king was the first victim. He was forced to abdicate in favour of his son Max. Although after 1886 the regent Luitpold saw many changes to Munich, particularly in art nouveau and neo-rococo buildings, the money did not come from the court. By now constitutional monarchs were obliged to subsist on their civil lists.\n\nOne who resented this was Ludwig’s grandson, the so-called ‘Fairy-Tale King’ Ludwig II. Ludwig admired his grandfather, who did not die until 1868: four years after the second Ludwig became king. Ludwig II had to pay for his grandfather out of his own income. After the first Ludwig’s death he had some more money for his architectural projects, plus the large annual bribe he received from Bismarck in Berlin. He also borrowed money, sums he could never hope to repay, which sealed his fate in the end when he too was forced to stand down. His mysterious death occurred soon after.\n\nLudwig II did rebuild his part of the Residenz, but after wartime damage these rooms were not restored, and the furniture is now in his museum at Hohenchiemsee. His rooftop winter garden had been taken down after it began to leak, ruining the decoration of the saloons below.\n\nLudwig was therefore confined to his creations in his beloved Bavarian Alps: the neo-rococo gem that is the Linderhof, which reminded me a little of Sanssouci in Potsdam (his mother was a Prussian Hohenzollern); the vast, and largely empty recreation of Versailles on the island at Hohenchiemsee which was a tribute to the French Bourbon absolute monarchs Louis XIV and XV he admired so much; and his last creation: the great stage-set that is Neuschwanstein. Neuschwanstein looks down on his father’s modest neo-gothic house Hohenschwangau. Inside, the few finished rooms show that Ludwig had absorbed something of the lessons of Ruskin and William Morris, for each one is a little work of art. It makes you wonder what he might have done to Munich had he been able to listen to ‘Lolette’: his idol Richard Wagner, or possessed something of the free hand of his ancestors.\n\nVienna: Back in the Josefstadt\n\nPosted: 25th May 2022\n\nIt had been three years since I was last in Vienna. I went first in 1970, following family footsteps, and again in 1989 to begin a tour of Velvet Revolutions from Prague to Berlin. I came to look at wine in January 1991. Thirty-one years later wine had brought me there again. I would be hard-pressed to say how many times I have been to the Austrian capital since 1991, and not always because of wine.\n\nI arrived on 19 May. I was supposed to go to a party at the Heurige Mayer am Pfarrplatz but British Airways scuppered that. We took off late because we had lost our slot, and we had lost our slot because someone neglected to close the cargo doors. When I got to my hotel I realised there was no point in going to the Heurige. I’d have had less than an hour at the party before I had get on the bus and come home.\n\nIt was a new hotel for me at least: Flemings in the Josefstädter Strasse. It was built for a gas company in 1910, and had some pleasant features, not least the view from my fifth floor window. I could pick out the vines of the Nussberg framed between Hundertwasser’s Garbage Disposal Tower and the twin spires of Josefstadt Parish Church. Two things troubled me about my room, however: I could see no way of turning off the bedside lights without disconnecting the electricity, and the shower, which was housed in a Perspex box in the middle of the room. Now, I could think of many women I might have liked to have seen naked in that box, but I could not imagine a single person of either sex who would have wanted to see me in there. I was glad I was travelling on my own.\n\nIt was a lovely, balmy evening, I thought I’d cut my losses by having a sausage at a stall and turning in early. I decided to mosey down to the Naschmarkt. There used to be a few old-fashioned places near the Secession building, but since my last visit they seemed to have gone, and the market itself had been turned into an uninterrupted series of chic restaurants. I went to the sausage stall behind the Opera House instead. That can be special too: I ate my Käsekrainer next to a woman who was drinking a pipkin of Moët & Chandon champagne. At the last moment I thought I needed wine as well and popped into the nearby Augustinerkeller for a Viertel of Grüner Veltliner. I ran into a friend. Vienna is a very small world.\n\nThe next morning I indulged in a little nostalgia as I set out. I was back in the Josefstadt. The Josefstadt (or 8th District) developed after 1683 when the Turks were routed under the walls of Vienna and was named after the Emperor Joseph I (1678 - 1711). It has the advantage of being close to the core of the old city. In the early years I was almost always lodged in the Josefshof Hotel, which was family-owned then and had a nice, friendly feeling about it. In the next street along was the house in which Beethoven composed the credo to his Missa Solemnis, possibly the greatest piece of music ever written.\n\nLast Friday I walked straight past the pleasantly down-at-heel Café Eiles where I would often eat a hasty breakfast before a car arrived to whisk me off to another vineyard. In those days, if I walked in the other direction up the Josefstädter Strasse I would find myself outside the flat of an Irish friend. There were a few trendy restaurants opposite where we could eat. Later on I saw my cousin, the actor August Zirner, perform once in an Ödön von Horvath piece at the Josefstadt Theater. Before the performance I recall drinking a cool beer in the square in front of the parish church, the same building I could see from my bedroom window.\n\nThis morning I needed to sign up for a tasting in the sumptuous Palais Niederösterreich (where Austria’s first parliament was held in 1848) and collect some money from the Graben. This meant crossing the Rathausviertel with its enormous, stately blocks of late-nineteenth century flats. Before 1938, many of these were occupied by rich Jews. Then it was a short walk through the Volksgarten park to the Hofburg, the old city palace where most of my wine activities were based. It was a sweltering day. I avoided the sun where possible, but I was frazzled by the time I met a friend at the Café Hawelka and we went off to a pleasant dinner nearby.\n\nIt rained in the night, which brought down the temperature a bit. After the business in the Hofburg there was a relaxed party in the garden outside the Burgtheater given by a group of ‘Premium Estates’ winemakers - a small group of men I had known for decades. The party was all the nicer for being just a five minute walk from my hotel. Until Sunday night I didn’t need to use any form of public or private transport to get around Vienna, I just walked.\n\nOn Sunday, however, the Nussberg was too far to walk, and after a tasting in the magnificent Palais Liechtenstein we took a taxi to a party in Vienna’s best vineyard, eating and drinking among the very same vines I could see from my hotel room. From the top of the Nussberg I could see the sun setting on the city. In the other direction you watched the moon wax over Bratislava.\n\nI went home on Monday. After I tasted my last wines I had another little walk in the Josefstadt: the Beethoven House, the Josefshof, the English theatre, the Lange Gasse, the Josefstadt theatre and the Strozzigasse, where I noted the façade of a magnificent former baker’s shop built in 1930 and a wine merchant called Torberg I hadn’t seen before. Then I settled down with a small beer or two in the Café Eiles and read the newspapers and waited for the taxi to come and take me to the airport.\n\nThe Fate of Hungary’s Jews\n\nPosted: 20th April 2022\n\nAgnes Kaposi, Yellow Star, Red Star, with contributions by Lászó Csősz, i2i Publishing, Manchester 2020.\n\n17 March was a lovely, sunny pre-spring day. It was also Purim, as I discovered when I took the wrong turning in Golders Green and ran into large numbers of Jews in their finery, carrying big bunches of flowers. I was on my way to see Dr Agnes Kaposi, who was born in Budapest in 1932 and had the misfortune to grow up in Hungary during the war years. She was going to explain to me the special flavour of the Hungarian Holocaust.\n\nI had wanted to talk about Hitler’s plenipotentiary, Edmund Veesenmayer, who worked in tandem with Adolf Eichmann to ensure the liquidation of Hungary’s Jews, but Agnes Kaposi believed the Hungarians had rid the country of its Jews very largely on their own. Eichmann had a staff of 150 to 200 men, she said; it was not them, but the national gendarmerie that rounded the Jews up and bundled them onto trains bound for Auschwitz. The only time she remembered seeing a German was when she arrived in Vienna in March 1944 and an SS man enquired ‘wie viele Tote?’ - ‘How many dead?’\n\nUnder its ‘Regent’ Admiral Horthy, Hungary was Germany’s ally in World War Two and until 19 March 1944, to some extent the country was free to do whatever it chose. They were, however, under constant pressure to subscribe to Germany’s racial policies. Once German troops invaded Hungary to shore up the Eastern Front, the SS came too to orchestrate the genocide. Veesenmayer sorted out the political side by insisting on sweeping governmental changes in Budapest. Later, the fascist ‘Arrow Cross’ took over where the Germans left off. Their victims were simply shot in the streets of Budapest.\n\nMore than half a million Jews died as a result, most of them were shipped out in just 56 days.\n\nAgnes was right: the Hungarians were by no means philosemitic. They had created their racial laws all by themselves. The first was the 1920 ‘numerus clausus’ that limited places for Jews at universities to mirror their percentage of the actual population. Many doctors, lawyers and academics were Jews. There was pressure to do the same in Austria and in some faculties a numerus clausus had existed. Polish Jews, for example, were allowed to study at Vienna before the First World War, but they were not allowed to practice as doctors in Austria. Germany did not introduce a numerus clausus until 1933. Other Jewish laws were introduced as Hungary courted Germany in the hope of winning back the territory it had lost in 1919. A first Jewish Law was voted in 1939 (a year after Italy). It limited the proportion of Jews in certain professions to twenty percent. A year later this was reduced to six percent. In 1941, Hungary introduced its own version of the Nuremberg Laws, forbidding sexual relations and marriage between Jews and Gentiles. In 1942, all Jewish land was swiped by the state.\n\nUnique to Hungary was the Military Labour Service introduced in 1939. Unable to join fighting units, young Jewish men worked in the front line as unarmed, non-uniform wearing sappers. More than 50,000 died, many in the abysmal hygienic conditions of Doroschich (Kupyshche) Camp in the region of Zhytomyr in the Ukraine.\n\nTowards the end of their time in Hungary, when it became increasingly clear that Germany might lose the war, Himmler’s SS began making deals. A train-load of prominent Jews travelled via Belsen to Switzerland, and 15,000 more were placed ‘on ice’ and were delivered to a camp outside Vienna where conditions were dreadful, but there was no ‘selection’ as such. These Jews provided free labour for vital industries. Agnes had been in the ghetto in Debrecen when she and her family were rounded up to be sent to Auschwitz. For most of them, this was certain death, but after the usual four-day journey in a sealed cattle truck, her train turned round and made for Vienna instead.\n\nThey landed at a former slave labour camp at Strasshof in the Wagram north-east of the city. Eleven-year old Agnes and her family were then sent to the Bisamberg in the north of Vienna to perform backbreaking labours at the state-owned Margarethenhof farm at the top of the hill. Gruelling the work might have been, but it was a lot better than Auschwitz. The girls even ventured down the hill into outlying parts of Vienna. In one moving episode in Agnes’s book, a Gypsy fiddler threw his coat over Agnes and scolded her for failing to remove the yellow star from her jacket. He found out where they lived and left packets of food in hiding places for them.\n\nI remember the Margarethenhof. Some of Vienna’s best vineyards are on the south-facing slopes of the Bisamberg. There was a restaurant in a hunting lodge there, now closed, where I once met an entertaining Uzbek.\n\nAgnes’s next stop was up by the Arsenal, where the military museum is now. I have crossed the area many times taking my children to see the car in which Franz Ferdinand was killed. Here little Agnes helped construct ack-ack guns. It was the spring of 1945 and the Red Army was closing in. Vienna had already been ‘Judenrein’ - clear of Jews - for over a year. Now a few Jews had returned. They were sent to clear up the rubble in the city centre. Some Viennese gave the children food, others not. They returned to Strasshof, where the Hungarian guards took to their heels. Then they walked most of the way back to Budapest eating when they could find food and keeping the older girls out of the way of Russian Army soldiers bent on rape. There was no joyful homecoming awaiting them in Budapest: the city was wrecked, there was next to no food and nowhere to live. The Hungarians were as antisemitic as ever.\n\nAgnes finished her education, became an engineer and at the time of the 1956 Uprising she fled, and settled here in London.\n\nLife on the Borders of Oligarchia\n\nPosted: 15th March 2022\n\nI had very little knowledge of Highgate in my childhood and teens. I lived in West London, and the north of the city was considerably more remote to me than Cambridge, for example. I had a school friend who lived in Belsize Park and together we explored neighbouring Hampstead; but all I knew of Highgate was that Coleridge resided there, that my school had a rival on the top of the hill and Karl Marx was buried in the cemetery. And you can imagine my surprise when I made my first pilgrimage to Marx’s tomb, to find my own grandfather and grandmother buried only ten metres from the apostle of communism. In 2006 Putin’s victim Alexander Litvinenko was buried there too.\n\nIn my teens, however, there were discordant rumbles that issued from Highgate Hill. They generally involved some permutation of the words ‘activities incompatible with their station’. The heart of the problem proved to be the Soviet Trade Delegation at 32 Highgate West Hill.\n\nThe Trade Delegation was established as early as 1920, but it only moved into its sleek, modernist HQ designed by Eric Lyons in 1957 - just after the Suez Crisis when the Soviet Union had pointed its ballistic missiles at Britain. Why the Soviets had acquired land there is not related. It might have had something to with the proximity of Marx, the height of the hill, or the size and relative remoteness of the plot of land on offer. Unlike the embassy in Kensington, there was plenty of room for expansion and for constructing discreet accommodation for Soviet ‘diplomats’. In 1973 the Trade Delegation was joined by the Military Attaché’s office in Millfield Lane designed (?) by Dinerman Davies, a site that was handy for members of the Trade Delegation as you could access it without quitting Soviet land.\n\nProbably the first time I got wind of something happening on the hill was in 1968, around the time of the Prague Spring. Then as now, Londoners had strong views about Russia. Two members of the Trade Delegation were expelled. The biggest haul of all was in 1971 when the defection of KGB agent Oleg Lyalin led to the expulsion of 105 Russians. Between 1981 and 1984 four residents of the private flats between the Trade Delegation and the Military Attaché’s office were forced to leave. Another 25 were thrown out in 1985. As John Le Carré would have been the first to point out, the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 was by no means the twilight of Russian espionage. In 2014 another 90 were ordered out, almost ten percent of the Russian officials based in London. At the time of the Skripal Affair in 2018 it was assumed that there were roughly 200 Russian case officers in London distributed between the Embassy and the Trade Delegation, and operating some 500 agents. Her Majesty’s Government even made noises about closing down the Trade Delegation.\n\nWhether proximity to Karl Marx or the Trade Delegation is responsible or not, Highgate has proved a magnet to Russians, poor, rich and stinking rich. Of course it is not just the Russians who have bought up the nicer places in recent years. The lovely seventeenth century houses in Highgate Grove that had accommodated Coleridge, J B Priestley and Yehudi Menuhin have filled up with spivs, crooners, actors, models and pasty (sic) cooks.\n\nThe Russians might well have been attracted by Gordon Brown’s Tier 1 Visa, created in 2008, which allowed so many to settle here and acquire British nationality, but that doesn’t necessarily explain why they plumped for Highgate.\n\nRussians have settled in Fitzroy Park and Millfield Lane and are to be found as far away as Bishop’s Avenue, where the Railway King Andrey Yakunin lives. His son even went to Highgate School. Three massive properties in particular unite some of the most pungent members of the current London colony. At the top of the list must be Andrey Guriev, the owner of Witanhurst, said to be the second largest house in the city after Buckingham Palace. Guriev is a former senator and ‘Fertiliser King’ who bought the mansion in 2008 for £50 million. Possibly he took advantage of the new Brown visa? Witanhurst with its Anglo-Saxon redolence was built in 1913 in a neo-baroque style by the architect George Hubbard for the soap magnate Sir Arthur Crosfield. Since Guriev acquired the house it has been in a state of semi-permanent flux. It is said now to be as big below ground as it is massive above.\n\nJust round the corner, between Hampstead Lane and Fitzroy Park is Beechwood House, built in 1834 by Disraeli’s cousin George Basevi for his barrister brother Nathaniel. Basevi built The Elms - tucked into the southern wall for himself a few years later. Beechwood with its twelve acres of land was sold to the Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov for £48 million in that same year of liberation, 2008. It is very hard to catch a glimpse of Beechwood. Possibly the best bet is from the allotments at the east end of the Heath, but I have occasionally seen its neoclassical profile from Hampstead Lane. It is said locally that The Elms is also Russian owned. It has been subjected to a monstrous ‘restoration’ of late which has completely destroyed the character of the listed building.\n\nThe third Russian property of note is Athlone House, a gaunt, baronial mansion constructed by E Soloman and JP Jones from 1870 to 1872. It was owned by the Air Ministry during the war and after that became a nursing home. In 2016, Mikhail Fridman bought it for £65 million and tried to have it demolished to make way for a modern mansion. We locals fought tooth and claw to keep it. And it now looks as if we might have finally won.\n\nFor twenty-six years now Highgate Hill has been my backdrop and my walks often take me up to Muscovy, or Oligarchia, or whatever you want to call it. I take an interest in my more exotic neighbours and it seems I am far from being alone. As I stopped to look at the ugly Military Attaché’s Office on Sunday I noticed a couple taking photographs of the building. We had a chat. The woman told me she had spent her lockdown beefing up on the local Russians. There were, it transpired, already commercial tours of Russian Highgate. Far from being remote, Highgate has become a backyard to us all.\n\nEleanor Reissa, The Letters Project: A Daughter’s Journey, Post Hill Press\n\namazon.co.uk/dp/1637582552\n\nPosted: 15th February 2022\n\nEleanor Reissa is an American actress, singer and playwright. She performs in English and Yiddish, laudably keeping alive the language of pre-war Ashkenazi Jews that is in danger of being crushed between the monoliths of English and Modern Hebrew.\n\nNow in her late sixties she has decided to examine her navel. The incentive was a collection of fifty-six letters she unearthed after her mother Ruth’s death. They were written by her father Chaskel Schlüsselberg in the immediate post-war years. He had been living in Stuttgart picking up the threads of his previous life, while Ruth was already encamped with her family in New York. Ruth had, however, recently been in nearby Ulm as a ‘DP’ or ‘displaced person’. Eleanor’s mother and father were cousins, and her father had courted her in Ulm. It was only a matter of time before he would settle his affairs and join her in America.\n\nAs Polish Jews their recent lives had been disrupted to say the least. Her mother’s family had fled to Central Asia: Ruth, her parents, brothers together with her son by her first marriage. Eleanor’s father had been packed off to Auschwitz in 1943. He too had been married before. One son had been despatched to safety in England on a Kindertransport, but his wife and daughter had been ‘deported to the East’, in other words murdered by the Nazis.\n\nEleanor couldn’t read the letters. There is one reproduced in the book. It is written in a legible, conventional German. Like so many of the descendants of German-speaking Jews, however, she never learned German, and despite its occasional similarity to basic German, her knowledge of Yiddish failed to provide clues. She therefore decided to pay for their translation as she was preparing to embark on a voyage of discovery.\n\nHere my sympathy was aroused. I too have dug up my past, and like Eleanor Reissa I began just a little bit too late to catch living people who might have put it in context. I have been reliant on written sources which, fortunately, I can mostly read. I too was enlightened by a collection of letters that arrived via a cousin who couldn’t make head or tail of them. They exposed many home truths.\n\nMy immediate family was less affected than hers, even if my great-uncle endured Dachau and Buchenwald. His brother, my grandfather, was able to escape to Bolivia where he died of heart disease aged thirty-eight. He was the last Jewish member of my family. My millionaire Jewish great-great grandfather Ludwig Zwieback had three daughters. Not one single descendant is Jewish today. One by one they converted or married outside the faith.\n\nBut Eleanor’s letters proved a red herring. They did not contain the information that would explain the past. She knew her father had been in Auschwitz, but like so many survivors (she prefers the word ‘fighters’) he scarcely mentioned it. The vital information was to be found in the archives in Baden-Württemberg. Using a variety of contacts from her professional life, Eleanor allotted a small amount of time and set off to Germany. It was winter, it rained, it snowed, the sky was grey and she had a visceral distrust of any German over a certain age. We are introduced to a variety of characters, and learn how Stuttgart, Ulm and Ludwigsburg now ‘celebrate’ the history of the genocide with monuments and ‘Stolpersteine’.\n\nWe discover all this with her. To some extent this is a dramatic device. You get a sneaking feeling she is exaggerating her ignorance of what happened in those dark years: had she never seen the films, the endless television programmes, never read the blogs or the rantings of internet tubthumpers?\n\nOnce Eleanor had seen her father’s depositions, made in the interests of receiving compensation from the Bonn Government, she realised that he had indeed been a ‘fighter’. Chaskel or ‘Charlie’ was a big man from a prosperous trading family in Poland who had joined a brother in Stuttgart in the thirties. The brother was kicked out with so many other Polish Jews in the autumn of 1938, but Chaskel had remained. Ironically, making his home in Germany might have helped him survive: in Poland so many Jews were simply shipped straight from ghetto to extermination camp. Chaskel’s diligence made him one of the last Stuttgart Jews sent to Auschwitz. Selected for his physical strength on the ramp, he was the only member of his transport to survive. He was assigned to Monowitz-Buna like the Italian writer Primo Levi. It was vital to maintain the will to live. The so-called ‘Musulmänner’ (for some unaccounted reason they were called ‘Muslims’) who descended into apathy were the first to be sent to the gas chambers.\n\nIt was hardly ‘life’ in a conventional sense, but he endured until the camp was disbanded in January 1945. Then began the death marches: first to Buchenwald and finally Oranienburg just north of Berlin. Here he finally managed to evade his torturers and hide in some straw until the Russians arrived. They gave him a cigar.\n\nThrough the deposition, Eleanor learned that her parents’ marriage had been anything but happy, that Chaskel had lost status in coming to New York and from a wholesale trader he had been reduced to working in a brush factory. The one thing that had redeemed his post-war life had been her, as he saw her as the reincarnation of Frida, the little girl he had lost to the genocide.\n\nMany of Eleanor’s friends and relations had discouraged her in her quest. Her father’s ‘English’ son and grandson were uninterested in their Jewish past: the humiliations were behind them. The young were particularly apathetic and her American family and friends were unable to share her enthusiasm, but she still believed the journey to have been worthwhile for she had finally discovered who she was.\n\nMichael\n\nPosted: 17th January 2022\n\nMichael Day died at 4.30 am on Thursday 13 January.
