        "text": "Welcome to our recommendations for Autumn 2021. As ever, the books displayed below have been selected by UK and US juries as examples of brilliant, original writing deemed to have a high chance of success with an anglophone readership. All books here are guaranteed financial support for their translation into English if the translation rights are bought by an English-language publisher.\n\nWith the publication of these jury choices, New Books in German completes 25 years of championing excellent German-language literature for translation into English. 1996 saw the birth of Dolly the cloned sheep in Scotland, the launch of the Nintendo 64, the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the publication of John le Carré’s Tailor of Panama, and the very first meeting of New Books in German at the Goethe-Institut in London.\n\nWe will be marking this quarter-century over the next few weeks, including by looking back at some of the books and authors we have featured on this website, and earlier, in the pages of our former magazine. We will celebrate some of the people who have been at the heart of the project.\n\nIn the meantime, we hope you will be inspired and engaged by the titles featured below. Scroll down below the book covers or click fiction and nonfiction to see a list of the books with short descriptions.\n\nAutumn 2021 Recommendations\n\n[book reviews will appear here…]\n\nFiction\n\nVoice of Dissent (Die Gegenstimme), Thomas Arzt, Residenz Verlag – Set in 1938, Thomas Arzt’s debut novel, Voice of Dissent, offers a savage indictment of Austria’s complicity in National Socialist crimes.\n\nThe Fake Salute (Der falsche Gruß), Maxim Biller, Kiepenheuer & Witsch – Intricate, complex and edgy, Maxim Biller’s The Fake Salute is a dark tale of ambition, envy and antisemitism.\n\nThe Invention of Disobedience (Die Erfindung des Ungehorsams), Martina Clavadetscher, Unionsverlag – In The Invention of Disobedience, Martina Clavadetscher draws on sci-fi and the neo-gothic – with playful allusions to Mary Shelley and Ada Lovelace – to create a feminist, dystopian novel that questions what it means to be human.\n\nLosing Skin (Federn Lassen), Regina Dürig, Literaturverlag Droschl – Regina Dürig’s Losing Skin explores themes closely connected with the Everyday Sexism and #metoo movements, dipping into a scenes from the life of a woman growing up in the present day.\n\nIn my father’s home the earth smells like the heavens (In der Heimat meines Vaters riecht die Erde wie der Himmel), Samira El-Maawi, Zytglogge – The book follows a family struggling to unite against the racism of the outside world.
