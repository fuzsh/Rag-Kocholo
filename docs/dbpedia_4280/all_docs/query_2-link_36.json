        "text": "Obituary of Juergen Schubert\n\nOn Monday, June 17, 2019, with his family by his side, Juergen Hermann Richard Schubert, age 69, of Zhoda, MB, lost his battle to overcome injuries sustained in an accident 10 days earlier while working on his ranch.\n\nHe is survived by his son Christian (Sara), son Stephan (Quinn) granddaughters Jorja and Jaclyn, wife Shirley Barca, Shirley's daughters, Wendy Gingell (Eric Lazo) and Rhonda (Lyle) Munteanu, grandchildren Jolie, Zander and McCoy, Juergen';s sister, Ulrike (Stefan) Lerche , brother Heinz-Hermann (Angelika) Schubert and, first wife, Ingrid Rottger-Schubert.\n\nJuergen was predeceased by his parents, Irmgard and Hermann Schubert.\n\nJuergen was born in Germany on May 23, 1950.He grew up on the family dairy farm near Stauffenburg, Germany. Here he enjoyed working the fields with a team of horses. From a young age, Juergen loved animals and knew he wanted them to be part of his future. In 1984, Juergen and his first wife and twin sons immigrated to Manitoba. They purchased a hog barn near New Bothwell. In 1990, the family bought a beef operation near Zhoda. It was Juergen's strong will, positive attitude, determination and intelligence, combined with a well-honed work ethic that resulted in a farm that prospered and grew into the New Country Ranch.\n\nJuergen's involvement on numerous boards and associations helped him to cultivate friendships that have stood the test of time. This involvement led to the ranch being the site of many weekends of ranch rodeo, team penning and roping events. Juergen loved to socialize with friends- old and new. His family and friends remember his quick wit. He had a joke, sometimes inappropriate, ready for every occasion.\n\nAfter several winters of extending his riding season with trips to Arizona, Juergen bought a home there. This allowed him more travel choices and the opportunity to meet more folks whose company he enjoyed.\n\nIn 2006, Juergen met his wife Shirley. Their life together was full of adventure, whether it was a trip to Alaska, a holiday to Mexico or a visit to Germany for family celebrations. After a busy work week, weekends were often spent with Juergen team penning and Shirley announcing. Together, they discovered new places, met new people and created incredible memories.\n\nJuergen's dream was to help his children to prosper. In recent years, he felt he had accomplished that as his sons branched out and built up their own operations. Although busy with his own ranch, Juergen was always quick to offer a hand to help sort and haul cattle or assist in any other way.\n\nAs an avid hunter, Juergen was fully prepared to talk guns and hunting. In April 2018, Juergen was able to share his passion with his sons Stephan and Christian by taking them on an African hunting trip to celebrate their 40th birthday.\n\nJuergen had a very special place in his big heart for his five grandchildren.&nbsp; He loved teaching them to drive- even if it meant using the new truck no one else was allowed to touch.\n\nGrandpa or Papa, depending on who was calling him, was ready to teach them about horses or hunting or knives. A gator ride to check the cows was usually in order when the grandchildren got restless. He had endless patience; he never tired of explaining the finer details of the fishpond or riding. He could also be counted on to introduce them to Willie's Roadhouse while driving.\n\nJuergen was a gentle giant of a man that has left us with a giant size hole in our hearts.\n\nJuergen was doing what he loved right until the end. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.\n\nA come and go viewing will be held on Friday, June 21, 2019, from 6:30-8:00 p.m. at Birchwood Funeral Chapel, Steinbach, MB.\n\nThe funeral service will be held Saturday, June 22, 2019, at 1:00 p.m. at Birchwood Funeral Chapel, Steinbach, MB, with viewing prior to the service. Ash interment to be held at a later date.\n\n<p>Donations may be made to Stars 1441 Aviation Park NE, Box 570, Calgary, Alberta T2E 8M7&nbsp;or Health Science Centre Foundation PW112-700 William Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3A 1R9.</p>\n\nSpecial thanks to Stars Ambulance and HSC staff that cared for Juergen."
