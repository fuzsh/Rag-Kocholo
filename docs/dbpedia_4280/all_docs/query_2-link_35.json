Other family members immigrating with Ludwig were:\n\nhis father, Martin Schubert (age 56, a farrier [a farrier is someone who is a blacksmith or veterinarian specializing in horses])\n\nAnna-Rosine Schubert (age 38)\n\nGustave Schubert (age 9)\n\nAdolphe Schubert (age 5)\n\nWilhelm Schubert (age 2).\n\n[SOURCE: Germans to America, Vol. 15] This may not be his first trip to America. A letter from Adaline Tagatz to her sister Evaline Tagatz said: \"I looked through the books on Otto's shelf and also found some information in Otto's Bible... In another book was the following: 'Ludvig Schubert aus Wischin Holland Deutschland nach America in 1863.' I gather this is the year Ludvig Schubert emigrated to America on the S.S. via Holland-Germany.\"\n\nCould Ludwig have came to America in 1863 to check things out and then returned for his family the next year? The 1900 & 1930 Census said he immigrated in 1863 and the 1920 Census said 1864 (see census entries below). The last sentence in the following note suggests this may be the case:\n\nEvaline Tagatz wrote: \"Chas. Dahlke's wife was Grandpa Schubert's aunt. [For misc. Dahlke records, go to the Dahlke web page. My Great-Aunt Adaline Tagatz wrote: \"Grandfather Schubert and Gust Dahlke were first cousins, which makes Walter mother's second cousin....\"]\n\nThe 1905 Wisconsin Census in Markesan, Green Lake County, WI, shows an August Dahlke. Could this be the Chas. Dahlke mentioned above?:\n\nAugust Dahlke (head of household, age 60, born in Posen, parents born in Posen, farmer)\n\nEmma Dahlke (wife, age 44, born in Posen, parents born in Posen)\n\nWillie Dahlke (son, age 20, born in Wis., single, laborer)\n\nEmil Dahlke (son, age 18, single, born in Wis., laborer)\n\nFrederick Dahlke (son, age 15, born in Wis., laborer)\n\nAlbert Dahlke (son, age 12, born in Wis.)\n\nLaura Dahlke (daughter, age 9, born in Wis.)\n\nMy grandmother also wrote that Chris Mueller's mother was Grandpa's aunt. Ludwig Schubert lived with Mrs. Koats (Krueger); Ludwig Kruger was Grandpa Schubert's cousin. His father, Grandpa's cousin brought Grandpa to America. Grandpa's parents came to America later.\"\n\nShe also wrote that he was thought to be age 16 when he immigrated. She wrote: \"Grandpa John Ludwig Schubert and Gustav Schubert came to America on money which their uncle, Mr. Krueger, sent them. Grandpa paid back the money for his trip to Mr. Krueger. Kruger had children: Mrs. Koats, Minnie Kruger and Ernest who married Emma Fierke.\" Gustav Schubert was Ludwig's half brother.\n\nA note found in my Great-aunt Adaline Tagatz's records also say that Johann and his half brother Gustave Schubert had their trip to America financed by an uncle. In the margin it says \"Uncle Rudolph Krueger.\"\n\nLudwig Schubert applied for naturalization in May 1970, but this record is lost. [SOURCE: June 5, 2003, letter to Jammie Denin from an archivist in the Polk Library, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh] Kruger Family:\n\nIt is interesting to note that Ludwig Schubert and his family were listed next to a Kruger family on the same ship manifest. This may (or may not) be the Kruger family that helped the Schuberts come to America. A note left by my Great-aunt Adaline Tagatz suggests that Rudolph Krueger was the uncle who financed Johann's trip to America. The Kruger family on the same ship as Ludwig Schubert may be related in some way to Rudolph.
