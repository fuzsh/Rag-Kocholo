        "text": "Black Death: A ferocious outbreak of plague, struck the population of Europe.\n\nAnticlericalism: A measure of contempt for the clergy, arising in part from what many saw as individual clergymen's poor performance during the plague's crisis years.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales and Boccaccio’s The Decameron reveal some of the satirical edges with which literate society now greeted clergymen.\n\nPietism: The notion of a direct relationship between the individual and God — thereby reducing the importance of the hierarchical Church based in Rome.\n\nThe 14th century was a disaster for the Church — with the papacy under French dominance in the city of Avignon for almost 70 years.\n\nDuring the Great Schism of the early 15th century, there were three popes at the same time — all trying to excommunicate one another.\n\nOne of the problems included a poorly educated lower clergy.\n\nPeasant priests proved to be unable to put forward a learned response to Luther’s challenge to their church.\n\nSimony: The selling of church offices.\n\nIn facing some of these problems, some movements arose in the late Middle Ages that were declared heretical by the church.\n\nIn England, John Wycliffe questioned the Church's material wealth, the miracle of sacramental, and penance doctrines, and, in a foretaste of Luther's ideas, the sale of indulgences.\n\nHe urged followers (the Lollards) to read the Bible and interpret it themselves — which led him to translate the Bible into English.\n\nIn Bohemia, Jan Hus led a revolt that combined religious and nationalistic elements.\n\nHe believed the Bible, not the church, was most authoritative.\n\nHe was horrified by what he saw as the clergy's immoral behavior.\n\nJan Hus was called before the Council of Constance in 1415 by Pope Martin V, though he was promised a safe passage, he was condemned as a heretic and burnt at the stake.\n\nHenry VIII (r. 1509–1546)\n\nA powerful English Monarch was supportive of the Catholic Church.\n\nHe criticized Luther by writing a pamphlet — The Defence of the Seven Sacraments.\n\nHe was never comfortable with Protestant Theology.\n\nThe \"King's Great Matter,\" King Henry VIII's attempt to divorce Catherine of Aragon, began the English Reformation.\n\nHe had grown concerned that Catherine had failed in producing sons, leaving him without a male heir.\n\nHe then fell in love with a young woman at his court, Anne Boleyn, who refused to sleep with him unless he made her his queen.\n\nBut then the papacy showed no signs of granting Henry’s annulment to Catherine since she was the aunt of the powerful Charles V.\n\nIn November 1529, he began the Reformation Parliament. He used a tool to give him ultimate authority on religious matters.\n\nThis led him to bribe Anne Boleyn to sleep with him and have a secret marriage — which led to Anne’s pregnancy.\n\nIn April 1533, Parliament enacted a statute, “Act in Restraint of Appeals” — which declared that all spiritual cases within the kingdom were within the king’s jurisdiction and authority and not the pope’s.\n\nIn September 1533, Anne Boleyn’s child was born, but it was a baby girl, Elizabeth Tudor.\n\nSince Henry was desperate to have a male heir, he was married a total of six times — until his third wife, Jane Seymour, gave birth to Edward.\n\nThe Act of Supremacy of 1534 limited the English Reformation by declaring the King of England the Supreme Head of the Church of England.\n\nThe brief reign of his son Edward V (r. 1574–1553) saw an attempt to institute genuine Protestant theology into the church that Henry had created.\n\nDuring the short reign of Mary Tudor (r. 1553–1558) — the daughter of Catherine of Aragon, there was an attempt to bring England back into the orbit of the Catholic Church.\n\nShe discovered that many Protestants remained after restoring formal links between England and the papacy.\n\nTo end this, she allowed hundreds of Englishmen to be burnt at the stake, earning her the sobriquet — Bloody Mary.\n\nIn the long successful reign of Elizabeth Tudor (r. 1558–1603), a final religious settlement was worked out, one in which the Church of England followed a middle-of-the-road Protestant course.\n\nPortugal built an empire mostly by sea, while Spain built empires on land.\n\nPortugal kept looser control over its properties, while Spain maintained a tighter grip over its tributary empire.\n\nPortugal lost their holdings quickly, while the Spanish maintained its overseas properties until the 19th century.\n\nWhile Portugues is having a head start on the African Route to the Indian Ocean, the Spanish decided to try an Atlantic route to the east.\n\nIn 1415, Prince Henry the Navigator participated in the capture of the North African port of Ceuta by the Muslims.\n\nThis conquest spurred his interest in Africa.\n\nHe was inspired to sponsor a navigational school in Lisbon and a series of navigation.\n\nHis goal is not only to develop trade with Africa but also to find a route to India and the Far East around Africa and cut out the Italian middlemen.\n\nIn 1487, Bartholomew Dias, a Portuguese captain, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa.\n\nIn 1489, Vasco de Gama reached the coast of India.\n\nThe Portuguese first mounted cannons on their ships and developed squadrons, giving them an advantage over the Arab fleets patrolling the Indian Ocean.\n\nThey controlled the lucrative spice trade on the western coast of India.\n\nOn August 2, 1492, Christopher Columbus, a sailor from Genoa, set sail certain that he would find the eastern route.\n\nHe believed that he would fulfill medieval religious prophecies that spoke of converting the whole world to Christianity.\n\nAfter 33 days of voyage from the Canary Islands, he landed in the eastern Bahamas — which he insisted was an undeveloped part of Asia.\n\nHe called the territory “Indies” and the indigenous people “Indians”.\n\nIn 1519, Ferdinand Magellan set out to circumnavigate the globe and he never saw the end of his voyage because he died in the Philippines.\n\nHe proved where Columbus landed was not the Far East — but an unknown territory.\n\nIn 1519, Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with a small force of 600 men.\n\nHe arrived at the heart of the Aztec Empire — a militaristic state, which through conquest had carved out a large state with a large capital: Tenochtitlán.\n\nThe Aztecs viewed the Spaniards, who were riding on horses wearing armor, and carrying guns, as gods.\n\nMontezuma: The Aztec ruler tried to appease the Spaniards with gifts of gold — but the Spanish just seized the city and held him hostage — which led to his unknown death.\n\nThe Aztecs' ability to fight was stopped by smallpox brought by the conquerors to the Indigenous people.\n\nBy 1521, Cortés declared the former Aztec Empire to be New Spain.\n\nIn 1531, Francisco Pizarro set out to Peru with a tiny force of 200 men.\n\nInca Empire of Peru: The Incas had carved out a large empire by conquering and instigating harsh rule over many other tribes.\n\nHe treacherously captured Atahualpa (Inca Emperor), who then had his subjects raise vast amounts of gold for ransom.\n\nBy 1533, Pizarro had grown tired of ruling through Atahualpa and had to kill him.\n\nThe Spanish set out to create haciendas, to exploit both the agricultural and mineral riches of the land.\n\nDue to a forced labor system, and encomienda, the indigenous population continued to die at an incredible pace from both disease and overwork.\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese began transporting captured Africans to the New World to work on farms and mines for their estates.\n\nThe European powers relied upon the Catholic Church to justify their atrocious overseas behavior. Their mission is:\n\nTo use thousands of missionary priests to convert indigenous people to Christianity.\n\nTo acquire massive amounts of land in the New World and sell them to the European landowning classes.\n\nColumbian Exchange\n\nThe transatlantic transfer of animals, plants, diseases, people, technology, and ideas among Europe, the Americas, and Africa.\n\nMercantilism had a strong effect on European governance.\n\nThe practitioners believe that the government needs to actively regulate the economy of its population.\n\nBy doing so, the rulers maintained a favorable trade balance, monitored the import and export of raw materials and finished goods, and funded the search for precious metals, the country's main source of wealth.\n\nIt began when Ferdinand of Styria was crowned king of Bohemia.\n\nProtestant Bohemians were outraged by Ferdinand's intolerance.\n\nIn May of 1618, a large group of Bohemian Protestant nobles surrounded two of Ferdinand’s Catholic advisors and threw them out of a window.\n\nIn 1619, Matthias, the Holy Roman Emperor died and Ferdinand, the King of Bohemia was elected Emperor.\n\nFrederick — the Calvinist Elector of the Palatinate, was elected as the King of Bohemia, a few hours after Ferdinand was elected emperor.\n\nSince Ferdinand doesn’t have an army, he turned to the Duke of Bavaria to ask for help against Frederick.\n\nAt the Battle of White Mountain, the Bavarian forces won a major victory, and Frederick became known as the Winter King.\n\nBy 1622, he lost not only Bohemia but also Palatinate.\n\nFerdinand confiscated the defeated Protestant prince's lands in the North and forged a unified state under Habsburg control.\n\nHe needed to find a new army since he won’t be able to rely on the Duke of Bavaria.\n\nHe then found a Bohemian noble — Albrecht von Wallenstein — who promised to create a vast army, here then started the war’s second phase.\n\nBy 1628, Wallenstein controlled an army of 125,000 and had won a series of major victories in the North.\n\nThe high-water mark for Habsburg's success in the Thirty Years’ War came with the Edict of Restitution (1629)\n\nIt outlawed Calvinism in the empire and required Lutherans to turn over all property seized since 1552.\n\nThis resulted in Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden to enter the war, triggering the third phase.\n\nThough he claimed that he became involved to defend Protestant rights in Germany, he was also interested in German territory along the Baltic.\n\nCardinal Richelieu: France’s chief minister, was concerned about the increase of Habsburg strength in Germany.\n\nIn 1632, Adolphus died, which made the Swedes roll back the Habsburgs.\n\nIn 1633, Wallenstein was murdered.\n\nThe last phase of the war consisted of the French and Swedes fighting against the Austrian Habsburgs and their Spanish allies.\n\nThe most destructive phase of the war.\n\nGerman towns were completely destroyed, and famine and general agricultural collapse followed.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1648, the Empire had eight million fewer inhabitants than it had in 1618.\n\nPeace of Westphalia (1648)\n\nIt marked the end of the struggle.\n\nThe treaty made sure that the Emperor would continue to be a weak force in German politics while the Holy Roman Empire maintained its numerous political divisions.\n\nAfter Francis I’s reign, it seemed as though the newly strong centralized monarchy had won the conflict between the feudal aristocracy and the monarchy.\n\nThe French Wars of Religion revealed that struggles were not quite over.\n\nReligious conflicts rose to the surface following the French monarch Henry II’s 1559 death — when his eye got pierced with a lance while celebrating the end of wars.\n\nOn his death, Francis II, his 15-year-old son, came to the throne.\n\nFrancis was then replaced by his brother Charles IX after months.\n\n14 years later, Henry III replaced Charles — the last of the Valois kings.\n\nAll three boys were influenced by their mother, Catherine de’ Medici.\n\nBehind the scenes of the French monarchy, a power struggle began to emerge among three prominent families.\n\nGuises: The most powerful family, turned toward a militant, reactionary form of Catholicism.\n\nAdmiral Coligny: The leader of the Montmorency family — converted to Calvinism.\n\nThe Prince of Conde, the leading Bourbon converted to Calvinism as well.\n\nThe Wars of Religion first began in 1562 when the Duke of Guise ordered the execution of several Huguenot worshippers after becoming enraged at their presence in a barn.\n\nThe Huguenots had the upper hand after 10 years of combat — both the Duke and the Prince were killed.\n\nHenry of Navarre: A young Bourbon prince married King Charles IX’s sister.\n\nCatherine de' Medici worried about the Valois family's political decline and sought to balance aristocratic power to protect her sons.\n\nIn 1572, Catherine encouraged her son, the King, to set in motion the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, which killed around 3000 people in Paris.\n\nPossibly 20,000 Huguenots were killed in simultaneous attacks across France.\n\nAdmiral Coligny was murdered, but Henry of Navarre was spared because he promised to return to Catholicism.\n\nIn 1574, Henry III, the last of the Valois kings, turned to the Huguenots to defeat the powerful Catholic League.\n\nHe then made Henry of Navarre his heir and became King Henry IV in 1598 — following his assassination led to the start of the Bourbon Dynasty.\n\nHenry IV struggled with Spain and was pressured because most Parisians remained Catholic — he then permanently converted to Catholicism.\n\nHis action instigated a new way of thinking in France and the idea of Politique, putting the interests of France before the goal of religious unity.\n\nAlthough Henry's Calvinist allies and Anglican Queen Elizabeth were horrified by his final religious conversion, he never forgot them.\n\nIn 1598, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, granting the Huguenots freedom of worship and assembly as well as the right to maintain fortified towns for their protection.\n\nAnn of Austria — Louis XIV’s mother, selected Cardinal Mazarin to be the regent during the king’s childhood.\n\nHowever, Mazarin had a less sure political hand than Richelieu.\n\nLouis XIV decided to rule without the Chief Minister and dealt with central issues on his own.\n\nHe achieved this by advocating a political philosophy — the notion that the monarch enjoyed certain divine rights.\n\nBishop Bossuet: Louis XIV’s chief political philosopher, wrote that because the king was chosen by God, only God was fit to judge the behavior of the king, not parliamentary bodies or angry nobles.\n\nHe built the palace of Versailles, 12 miles outside of Paris, as a way to dominate the French nobility and the Parisian mob.\n\nNo member of the high aristocracy attended the daily council sessions at Versailles.\n\nJean-Baptiste Colbert: Louis most important minister — he centralized the French economy by instituting a system known as mercantilism.\n\nIts goal is to build up the nation’s supply of gold by exporting goods to other lands and earning gold from their sale.\n\nColbert succeeded in helping to create France’s vast overseas empire.\n\nFrench East Indian Company: Organized by Louis to compete with the Dutch.\n\nIn 1685, he revoked the Edict of Nantes. He demolished the Huguenot churches, and schools, and took their civil rights away.\n\nFrance was involved in a series of wars as a means to satiate Louis' desire for territorial expansion.\n\nWilliam of Orange: The leader of the Netherlands and was committed to waging total war against Louis.\n\nAfter 1688, a 25-year war broke out including the — War of Spanish Succession between the French and the English and Dutch allies.\n\nThis war lasted from 1702 to 1713 and ended in the Treaty of Utrecht, which left a Bourbon (Louis's grandson) on the throne of Spain.\n\nThese wars ultimately left the French peasantry hard-pressed to pay the taxes to support Louis XIV's constant desire for glory.\n\nCharles I did not possess even the somewhat limited political acumen of his father.\n\nHe lent his support to the so-called Arminian wing of the Anglican Church.\n\nHe believed that this faction provided the greatest stability for his state.\n\nArminius: A Dutch theologian of the early 17th century who argued in favor of free will as opposed to the Calvinist doctrine of predestination.\n\nIn 1633, Charles named William Laud as his Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHis relationship with the Parliament started badly when the Parliament granted him tonnage and poundage for only a year instead of his time in monarchy.\n\nHe was forced to pay for the military disasters that he caused and forced himself to loan — however, the Parliament refused to pay his loans and throw him in jail.\n\nPetition of Rights\n\nThese included provisions that the King could not demand a loan without the consent of the Parliament.\n\nIt also prohibited individuals from being imprisoned without a published case.\n\nIt outlawed using martial law against civilians, which Charles had used to collect his forced loan.\n\nIn August 1628, Charles’s chief minister, Duke of Buckingham, was murdered by an embittered sailor who blamed him for England’s recent military disasters.\n\nIn January 1629, the Parliament was called, and both sides felt that the issue of exclusive rights would lead to the Parliament and the King’s conflict.\n\nIn March 1629, his messengers announced the dissolution of the Parliament.\n\nFor the next 11 years, Personal Rule of Charles was the law of land.\n\nBy 1637, Charles was at the height of his power. He had a balanced budget, and his government policies and restructuring appeared to be effective.\n\nA civil war broke out in the nation four years after he reached his peak, destabilizing his position of authority.\n\nThe Scots rioted and signed a national covenant that pledged their allegiance to the king, but also vowed to resist all changes to their Church.\n\nIn 1640, he called an English Parliament because he believed it would be willing to grant money to put down the Scottish rebellion.\n\nIt was then called “Short Parliament” because it met for only three weeks and was dissolved right after they didn’t meet Charles’s needs.\n\nCharles was still determined to punish the Scots.\n\nThe Scots were the victors on the battlefield and invaded northern England.\n\nThey refused to leave England unless Charles signed a settlement and forced him to pay £850 per day.\n\nTo pay those, he was forced to call another Parliament — the “Long Parliament”, which lasted 20 years.\n\nThe House of Commons launched the Long Parliament by impeaching Charles’s two chief ministers and executing them.\n\nThey abolished the king’s prerogative courts, which became the tools for Royal Absolutism.\n\nThey supported the Grand Remonstrance — a list of 204 parliamentary grievances.\n\nThey also added two demands:\n\nThe king name ministers whom Parliament could trust; and\n\nThat a synod of the Church of England is called to reform the Church.\n\nCharles then attempted to sieve five of the rulers of the House of Commons — which led to failure, resulting in him to leave London in January 1642.\n\nHe created the New Model Army, a regularly paid, disciplined force with extremely dedicated Puritan soldiers.\n\nBy 1648, the King was defeated and in the following year, he made a decision to execute Charles.\n\nFrom 1649 to 1660, England became a Republic — The Commonwealth; a military dictatorship governed by Cromwell.\n\nHe then made conflicts among his own supporters.\n\nThe Independents wanted a state church, but were also willing to grant a measure of religious freedom for others.\n\nThe Presbyterians wanted a state church that would not allow dissent.\n\nCromwell dealt with the rise of radical factions within his army — the Levellers and the Diggers.\n\nIn 1649, Cromwell destroyed the Leveller elements in his army.\n\nIn 1650, he led an army to Ireland, where he displayed incredible brutality in putting down resistance by supporters of the Stuarts.\n\nIn 1652, he brought his army into London to disperse a Parliament.\n\nIn 1665, Cromwell gave up on the idea of governing alongside a legislature and divided England into 12 military districts.\n\nBy the time Cromwell passed away, a worn-out England desired to restore the Stuart dynasty.\n\nLife was bleak and revolved around a never-ending struggle to find resources to survive.\n\nLife was centered in the small village, with most people never venturing more than a few miles beyond their birthplace.\n\nRural village housing provided little protection from the cold and wet winters.\n\nThe furnishings in these homes were as simple as their surroundings.\n\nWorkdays were longer in the summer and shorter in the winter.\n\nThree-Field System: Crops were rotated across three pieces of land; mostly used in Northern Europe.\n\nTwo-Field System: Crops rotated on two pieces of land; predominated in the Mediterranean.\n\nFarmland was laid out in long strips in most rural areas, with individual peasant families owning a portion of land in each of the strips.\n\nScholasticism: A synthesis of Christian theology with the scientific beliefs of the ancient authors.\n\nThomas Aquinas: The great architect of scholasticism, who took the works of Aristotle and harmonized them with the teachings of the church.\n\nKnowledge of God remained the supreme act of learning and was to be attained through both reason and revelation.\n\nViewing science outside of this religious framework was simply unthinkable in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe concept of the four elements gave rise to the idea of alchemy — the perfect compound of the four elements in their perfect proportions.\n\nThe four-element approach also dominated the practice of medicine.\n\nThe four elements combined in the human body to create what was known as the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile.\n\nAstronomy was not a popular subject in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe greatest figure of Scientific Revolution.\n\nHe wanted to solve the problem posed by the work of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo: how do you explain the orderly manner in which the planets revolve around the Sun?\n\nNewton worked on the problem for nearly two decades before publishing his masterpiece, Principia, in 1687.\n\nNewton wondered what force kept the planets in an elliptical orbit around the Sun when they should have been moving in a straight line.\n\nThe same force that drew the apple when it fell from the tree may explain planetary motion — gravity.\n\nHe was very religious. When he gives scientific talks, he wonders why audiences are more interested in science than theology.\n\nNewton is also the founder of differential calculus.\n\nHe later became the President of the British Royal Society, an organization dedicated to spreading the new spirit of experimentation.\n\nHis Two Treatises on Government — written before the Revolution 1688, was after William and Mary came to the throne and served as a defense of the revolution as well as a basis for the English Bill of Rights.\n\nLocke argued that although man is born free in nature, government is necessary as society develops to organize it.\n\nHumans are free and logical beings who do not relinquish their unalienable rights to life, liberty, and property when they enter into a social contract with the state.\n\nHe disapproved of religious fervor.\n\nIn his Letter Concerning Toleration, Locke attacked the idea that Christianity could be spread by force.\n\nHis influential Essay on Human Understanding contained the idea that children enter the world with no set ideas.\n\nAt birth the mind is tabula rasa — a blank slate, the infants do not possess the Christian concept of predestination or original sin.\n\nHe was considered as greatest philosophes.\n\nWhen Voltaire went to England, it altered his brain chemistry.\n\nHe was amazed at the level of religious acceptance and the freedom to publish one's opinions.\n\nHe was also astounded by the respect the English extended to Newton when the scientist was laid to rest at a state funeral amid great ceremony.\n\nEngland seemed to offer personal happiness, which France lacked.\n\nHe hated the Catholic Church and all religions for their narrowness and bigotry.\n\nHe was also a Deist — one who believes that God created the universe and then stepped back from creation to allow it to operate under the laws of science.\n\nVoltaire felt that religion crushed the human spirit and that to be free.\n\nÉcrasez l’infame! — Crush the horrible thing!; his famous anti-religous slogan.\n\nHe lived a deeply troubled and solitary existence.\n\nHe antagonized many of the other leading philosophes.\n\nHe was perhaps the most radical of the philosophes.\n\nHe believed in the creation of a direct democracy.\n\nRousseau helped set the stage for the Romantic Movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nHis novel Emile (1762) deals with a young man who receives an education that places higher regard on developing his emotions over his reason.\n\nIn his The Social Contract (1762), “All men are born free, but everywhere they are in chains.”\n\nHe had little faith in the individual’s potential to use reason as a means of leading a more satisfactory life.\n\nDuring the Scientific Revolution, thinkers used reason to discover universal laws behind the natural world.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, thinkers used reason to discover universal laws behind human behavior.\n\nWomen played an important role in the Enlightenment.\n\nThe majority of Parisian salons were organized by women.\n\nThese wealthy and aristocratic people helped philosophers avoid legal trouble with their sociopolitical connections.\n\nGiven their enormous assistance, the male thinkers were generally not strong supporters of women's rights and abilities.\n\nThe Encyclopédie barely bothered to address the condition of women, though the work would never be famous without the help of Marquise de Pompadour — Louis XV’s mistress.\n\nIn Montesquieu’s Persian Letters, he included a discussion of the restrictive nature of the Eastern harem, which, by implication, was a criticism of the treatment of women in Western Europe.\n\nRousseau believed women should not be educated equally and should have separate spheres of influence.\n\nMary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) wrote in her Vindication of the Rights of Women that women should enjoy the right to vote as well as to hold political office.\n\nIn the 17th century, Prussia was a poor German state that was left devastated after the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nIn Peace of Westphalia, Prussia did receive some minor territorial gains\n\nBy the 16th century, serfdom had been established due to the relatively poor agricultural land and labor shortages.\n\nJunkers — Prussian nobility, who looked to the ruler to ensure control over their serfs.\n\nFrederick William, the Great Elector (r. 1640-1688)\n\nThree separate areas of land without natural borders made up his state.\n\nSince he lacked sufficient resources on his own to build an army, he turned to the Junkers for assistance.\n\nThat was the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the Prussian monarchy and the Junkers.\n\nHe left his son, Frederick III, a well-organized army, an expanded territorial base, and arguably the most efficient civil service in all of Europe.\n\nHe made Prussia into a Kingdom in 1701, gaining the title of King Frederick I.\n\nFrederick the Great (r. 1740-1786)\n\nHe was often cited as an enlightened absolutist.\n\nAt his palace of Sans Souci, he established a glittering intellectual center, where Voltaire would live for a time and where the king himself participated by writing philosophical tracts.\n\nFrederick freed the serfs on the royal estates.\n\nHe also reduced the use of corporal punishment against serfs and abolished the death penalty.\n\nFrederick used rational thought to promote royal centralization and absolutism, not individual rights or participatory political institutions.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa pushed a series of reforms that removed some of the hardships that had been placed on the serf population.\n\nJoseph II, Theresa's son, wanted religious tolerance to limit the Catholic Church's power in his domains.\n\nHe saw the Church as opposed to his plan for more centralized authority.\n\nIn 1781, he issued the first of a series of Edicts of Toleration granting Jews, Lutherans, and Calvinists freedom of worship.\n\nAfter Joseph's death, Leopold II had to abandon some of Joseph's progressive policies to quell aristocratic and peasant uprisings.\n\nThe roots of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) began during the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI (r. 1711–1740).\n\nCharles pushed the other European states to accept Pragmatic Sanction — allowing for the assorted Habsburg lands under his control to remain intact under one ruler.\n\nAlso granting the right of a female to succeed to the throne of Austria if there was no direct male heir.\n\nWhen Charles died without leaving a son, his daughter Maria Theresa came to the throne.\n\nCharles's death became an opportunity for Prussia and France to gain territory at the expense of the Austrians.\n\nFrederick launched an attack to seize Silesia, the richest part of the Austrian empire, at the northeastern border of Bohemia.\n\nThe conflict became a general European war.\n\nAustria gained support from Russia, Sweden, Denmark, and eventually Great Britain.\n\nOpposing them was an alliance made up of Prussia, France, and Spain.\n\nTreaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748): The Austrian throne was ultimately saved for the Habsburgs\n\nDiplomatic Revolution: The reversal of longstanding alliances in Europe between the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War.\n\nSeven Years’ War (1756–1763)\n\nIt all began in 1756, when Frederick launched an attack to quickly defeat his enemies.\n\nOnly Peter III, in 1762 staved off the complete destruction of the Prussian state.\n\nFrench and Indian War (1754–1763): It was the North American conflict in Seven Years’ war.\n\nThe Seven Years’ spanned five continents, resulted in the confiscation of French colonies in Canada and India — called by the Winston Churchill: the first world war.\n\nPrince Mieszko's conversion to Roman Catholicism in 966 is considered to be the official beginning of Polish history.\n\nBeing vulnerable to attacks, they had to deal with the attacks from:\n\nMongols from the east; and\n\nTeutonic Knights from the west.\n\nIn order to defeat these groups, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was established.\n\nIt occurred when the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jagiello, married the Polish Queen Jadwiga.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian state's fatal flaw was failing to establish a strong, centralized government in the face of a recalcitrant nobility afraid of losing power.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian state remained a significant player in Europe until the end of the century.\n\nKing Jan Sobieski played a critical role in driving the Turks from the gates of Vienna in 1683.\n\nWhen Stanislaw August Poniatowski became king in 1764, he displayed an independent streak.\n\nThis action just led to the displeasure of the country’s neighbors.\n\nIn 1772, Russia, Prussia, and Austria forced Poland to accept a partition that cost Poland 30% of its territory.\n\nIn 1791, the Polish-Lithuanian parliament produced Europe’s first written constitution.\n\nThis constitution was never fully implemented, it angered many nobles.\n\nThe anti-Poniatowski nobles applied to the Russians for assistance.\n\nIn 1793, the Second Partition was carried out as a result of Russia and Prussia's insistence on the constitution's removal.\n\nThis led to the loss of vast lands in the eastern part of the nation and reduced Poland to a rump state\n\nIn 1794, a Polish revolt broke out under the military leadership of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who had fought with distinction in the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1795, the third and final partition took place, wiping Poland off the map.\n\nAn independent Polish state would not be revived until the aftermath of World War I.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the 17th century, Great Britain became the most stable nation in Europe in the 18th century.\n\nGeorge I (r. 1714–1721): He is the ruler of the German state of Hanover, and his sole qualification was that he was the late Queen Anne's Protestant cousin.\n\nGeorge II (r. 1727–1760): He could reign as an unquestioned absolutist, rather than having to deal with the independent-minded British Parliament.\n\nRobert Walpole: Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1721 to 1741.\n\nHe was given complete freedom to alter the political structure to his benefit.\n\nTo keep hold of the House of Commons, he employed a sophisticated system of political patronage.\n\nHe resigned in 1741 over British foreign policy.\n\nTwo Parliamentary blocks:\n\nTories: They supported the monarch's prerogative rights and the Church of England.\n\nWhigs: They were more closely associated with the spirit of the 1688 Revolution and the idea of religious tolerance.\n\nGeorge III (r. 1760–1820): He claimed that he wanted the throne to rise above party strife.\n\nThe British government won the Seven Years' War but had a huge deficit.\n\nIn 1763, John Wilkes was arrested for publishing a satirical attack on George III in his paper The North Briton.\n\nIn 1774, American anger at what was viewed as high-handed British policies led to the establishment of the First Continental Congress\n\nIn 1783, the Americans won their independence with the help of France and Spain.\n\nIn 1792, political reform in the UK was resisted after the French Revolution's violence and radicalism.\n\nAny expansion of suffrage would have to wait until the Great Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nAssembly of Notables: Leading aristocrats and churchmen were called by Louis XVI to see if they would willingly pay a new land tax that would apply to all.\n\nEstates General: An institution from medieval times that consisted of a three-house body made up of:\n\nThe First Estate — clergy.\n\nThe Second Estate — nobility, and\n\nThe Third Estate — commons.\n\nCommons: It refers to everyone from the bourgeoisie to peasants who were neither clergy nor nobility.\n\nWriters began to declare that the Third Estate was the real embodiment of the political will of the nation.\n\nThis sense of wanting change can be seen in the thousands of Cahiers de doléances (lists of grievances) that were presented to the King.\n\nWhile many demanded lessening royal absolutism, all were loyal to the idea of monarchy.\n\nMay 5, 1789 — marked the first day of the meeting of the Estates General.\n\nOn June 17, 1789, the Third Estate declared that it would not meet as a medieval estate based on social status.\n\nThey demanded a national assembly with Three Estates representatives representing the political will of the entire French nation.\n\nTennis Court Oath: Members of the Third Estate gathered at a tennis court on the grounds of Versailles and promised to continue to meet “until the constitution of the kingdom is established and consolidated upon solid foundations.”\n\nOn June 27, 1789, Louis XVI formally agreed to the consolidation of all three estates into a new national assembly.\n\nCount of Artois: The youngest brother of Louis XVI, and it was he who made the fatal decision to encourage his brother to flee France.\n\nOn June 20, 1791, the royal family reached the French town of Varennes, where the king was recognized and escorted back to Paris.\n\nJacobins: A political club, and so was named because they met in the Jacobin monastery in Paris.\n\nGirondins: The Gironde political club in southwestern France supported a revolutionary war to liberate absolutist states.\n\nThe war in April 1792 brought about an increasingly radical situation in Paris.\n\nThe sans-culottes tried to deal with the scarce supply of bread and feelings of chagrin at being labeled passive citizens without the right to vote.\n\nThey were also fearful of the Duke of Brunswick — which promised that he would destroy Paris if the royal family was harmed.\n\nOn August 10, 1792, a large mob of sans-culottes stormed the Tuileries palace, where the king and the queen were living, and slaughtered 600 of the king’s Swiss guards.\n\nOn September 21, 1792, France became an official Republic and the royal family was placed under arrest.\n\nIn the Convention, the Girondins and Jacobins continued to disagree over the direction of the Revolution.\n\nThe Jacobins sat on the left side of the hall, this seating arrangement earned them the label, “the Mountains.”\n\nThe Girondins sat on the right side of the hall.\n\nIn the middle section of the hall sat those who were not directly tied to either faction; “the Plain.”\n\nThe Plain held the key to the Revolution because whichever side they aligned with would ultimately triumph.\n\nThe Girondins wished to make a clean break from the absolutist government of the pr\n\nThe Girondins favored laissez-faire, the idea that the government should not play an active role in regulating the economy.\n\nThe Jacobins believed that the king was a traitor and should therefore be executed.\n\nThey also felt that the only way to maintain the spirit of the revolution was through a powerful, centralized government in Paris.\n\nThey favored the sans-culottes, in terms of their economic stand.\n\nIn the spring of 1793, marked the beginning of “Reign of Terror.”\n\nIt was inspired by the Vendee, a counter-revolutionary revolt that began in March in a western region of France.\n\nFrench armies met a major defeat that same month in the Austrian Netherlands.\n\nIn response to these provocations, the Convention created two committees:\n\nThe Committee of General Security\n\nThe Committee of Public Safety\n\nThe leaders of the security committee included Danton, Carnot, and Robespierre, a lawyer — they were all associated with the Jacobins faction.\n\nIn August 1793, Lazare Carnot, the head of the military, issued his famous proclamation calling for a levée en masse, drafting everyone for military service.\n\nOnce in power, the Jacobins worked to create what they considered to be the Republic of Virtue.\n\nThey believed they had to eradicate all signs of the previous monarchical order.\n\nThey created a new calendar based on 10-day weeks as a result.\n\nThe seasons were reflected in the renamed months, and 1792—the first year of the Republic—was designated as year one.\n\nCult of the Supreme Being: Established by Robespierre to move people away from what he thought was the corrupting influence of the Church.\n\nIt turned the cathedral of Notre Dame into a Temple of Reason.\n\nFrom the summer of 1793, the Committee of Public Safety first began by banning political clubs and popular societies of women.\n\nThey executed leading Girondins politicians who were accused of being traitors, and the guillotine became a symbol of the age.\n\nBy March 1794, under the leadership of Robespierre, the Terror had an extremely radical faction known as the Hébertists.\n\nThey were violently anti-Christian and wanted to see the government implement further economic controls.\n\nDanton and his followers were brought to the guillotine for arguing that it was time to bring the Terror to a close.\n\nOn 8 Thermidor (July 26, 1794), Robespierre spoke before the Convention about the need for one more major purge.\n\nThis led him and his supporters to be arrested by the Thermidorians, after a quick trial, 100 leading Jacobins were escorted to the guillotine.\n\nNapoleon was born in 1769 to a family of minor nobles on the island of Corsica, which had been annexed by France the year prior to his birth.\n\nHe attended a French military academy, and in 1785 he was commissioned as an artillery officer.\n\nThe Revolution offered tremendous opportunities to young men of ability, and Napoleon became a strong supporter of the Revolution.\n\nIn 1793, after playing a major role in the campaign to retake the French port of Toulon from the British, he was made a general.\n\nIn a series of stunningly quick victories, Napoleon destroyed the combined Austrian and Sardinian armies.\n\nHe also decided to invade Egypt in order to cut Britain’s ties with its colony of India.\n\nHe was unable to do much with his victories on land because a British fleet under the command of Admiral Horatio Nelson defeated a French fleet at the Battle of Abukir on August 1, 1798.\n\nNapoleon retreated from his army and hurried back to France, where he had learned that the Directory was becoming more unstable.\n\nOn 19 Brumaire (November 10, 1799), Napoleon joined the Abbé Siéyès staged a coup d’état, and overturned the Directory.\n\nSiéyès then established a new constitution with a powerful executive made up of three consuls: Roger-Ducos, Siéyès, and Napoleon.\n\nOne month after the coup, Napoleon set up a new constitution with himself as First Consul.\n\nHe staged a plebiscite, a vote by the people, for his new constitution to show popular support, and they passed it overwhelmingly.\n\nSince Napoleon required that public servants be loyal to him only, he was able to use the talents of those Jacobins and monarchists who were willing to accept his dominance over the French state.\n\nNapoleon treated those who were not willing with brutal cruelty.\n\nHe established a secret police force to root out his opponents.\n\nHe then purged the Jacobins.\n\nHe also kidnapped and executed the Duke of Enghien after falsely accusing the Duke of plotting against him.\n\nIn 1801, Napoleon created a concordat with Pope Pius VII.\n\nIt declared that “Catholicism was the religion of the great majority of the French.”\n\nHowever, it didn’t reestablish the Catholic Church as the official state religion.\n\nThe papacy would choose bishops, but only on the First Consul's advice.\n\nAll clergy was required to take an oath supporting the state, and the state would pay their salaries.\n\nThe Church was able to persuade Napoleon to abolish the Jacobin calendar.\n\nIn 1802, following a plebiscite that made him Consul for Life, Napoleon set about to reform the French legal system.\n\nThe Civil Code of 1804 (Napoleonic Code) provided for a single, unitary legal system for all of France.\n\nThe code established the equality of all people before the law and protected property holders' rights.\n\nThe code reaffirmed France's paternalistic nature.\n\nWomen and children were legally obligated to rely on their husbands and fathers.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon decided to make himself emperor.\n\nHe invited the Pope to attend the ceremony, which was held at Notre Dame.\n\nNapoleon wanted to make it clear that he was Emperor of France not by the will of God or by chance of birth, but rather by the weight of his own achievements.\n\nConstant warfare was a hallmark of the reign of Napoleon.\n\nIn 1792, with the levée en masse, French armies became larger than their opponent’s forces.\n\nNapoleon saw the Treaty of Amiens (1802) as a temporary measure to limit British influence.\n\nAfter most of the French troops died from disease, Napoleon turned his interest away from the colonies.\n\nHe even sold the Louisiana Territory to the USA for the paltry sum of around $15 million.\n\nOn October 21, 1805, at the Battle of Trafalgar, Admiral Nelson died in the struggle that ultimately destroyed the French fleet and with it any hope of the French landing in England.\n\nThird Coalition: Formed in which Austria and Russia joined Great Britain.\n\nNapoleon set out to first destroy the Austrians, a goal which he achieved at the Battle of Ulm in October 1805.\n\nHe then won his greatest victory over a Russian force at Austerlitz.\n\nNapoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire and created the Confederacy of the Rhine, a loose grouping of 16 German states under French rule.\n\nNapoleon’s victories in Germany resulted in the redrawing of the map.\n\nWhen the Prussians saw the extent of French control over German territories, they rushed to join the Third Coalition.\n\nNapoleon quickly gathered his forces, and at the Battle of Jena he obliterated the Prussian army and occupied their capital city of Berlin.\n\nThe Russian Tsar Alexander I (r. 1801–1825) decided that it was necessary to make peace with France, after the complete collapse of the Prussian army.\n\nHe met with Napoleon on a raft on the Nieman River, and on July 7, 1807, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Tilsit.\n\nBecause of this, Prussia was saved from extinction and was forced to be an ally of France.\n\nSeeing that he could not defeat the British navy, Napoleon decided to wage economic war.\n\nHe established the Continental System, an attempt to ban British goods from arriving on the continent.\n\nThis system weakened the economies of the state that Napoleon had conquered.\n\nIn victory, the allies demanded the restoration of the Bourbon monarchs, Louis XVIII sat on the throne.\n\nNapoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean, where he maintained the title of Emperor and a small army while his allies paid off his debts.\n\nIn September 1814, the allies met at the Congress of Vienna to create a lasting peace.\n\nThe four great powers, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, dominated the proceedings.\n\nPrince Metternich (1773–1859) an Australian Chancellor, He wanted to ensure that ideas derived from the French Revolution, such as nationalism and liberalism, had no place in a redrawn Europe.\n\nBy giving the territory to the Tsar of Russia as the Duchy of Poland, they ensured that Polish demands for a free and independent Poland went unmet.\n\nThe major powers also wanted to make sure that no country would ever again rule Europe.\n\nThe major powers also built a number of states that would prevent further French expansion.\n\nThe Dutch region and the Austrian Netherlands to the south formed the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nThey granted Prussia significant lands along the Rhine to thwart French expansion to the east in the future.\n\nThey also gave Piedmont the territory of Genoa.\n\nOn March 15, 1815, Napoleon returned to France, having escaped from Elba.\n\nAs the Bourbons returned and sparked a violent white terror against Jacobins and Bonaparte supporters, he had many supporters in the army and country.\n\nWhite Terror: White, signifying the royalist flag and those loyal to the monarchy.\n\nAt the Battle of Waterloo (June 18, 1815), Wellington aided by Marshal Blucher defeated Napoleon.\n\nHundred Days: The name given to Napoleon’s remarkable return, he was exiled once again.\n\nHe was exiled to the distant island of St. Helena, in the middle of the Atlantic, and died in 1821.\n\nNationalism: It is based on the idea that all people’s identities are defined by their connection with a nation and that it is to this nation that they owe their primary loyalty as opposed to their king or local lord.\n\nDevelopments like national conscription, the calling of all young men for military service, helped create the idea of a citizen whose primary loyalty lies not to a village or province but to the nation instead.\n\nIn the German and Italian states, the desire to rid their lands of French soldiers created a unifying purpose that helped establish a national identity.\n\nWriters such as the Grimm brothers recorded old German folk tales to reveal a traditional German national spirit that was part of a common past, whether one lived in Bavaria, Saxony, or any of the other German states.\n\nEarly 19th-century nationalism was tied to liberalism because many nationalists wanted political equality and human freedom to serve as the bedrock for the new state.\n\nIn Prussia, Frederick William IV (r. 1840–1861) had promised to promote moderate reform for many years, but he never implemented any changes.\n\nIn March 1848, disturbances erupted in the streets of Berlin — two shots rang out and struck two people.\n\nFrederick became horrified and ordered his army to leave the city — leaving him no defense.\n\nIn December 1848, the king did draw up his own constitution, which was rather close to what the assembly had planned.\n\nIt allowed for personal rights such as freedom of the press.\n\nIt created a two-house legislature with adult-male universal suffrage for the lower house.\n\nThis provision was watered down by giving weighted votes to those who paid more taxes.\n\nIn Hungary, Lajos Kossuth demanded a constitution that would provide for responsible government for Hungary.\n\nIn Prague, a similar revolt called for the creation of a semi-autonomous Czech homeland.\n\nIn Vienna, it was under the control of students and workers who demanded freedom of the press, an end to censorship, and also the removal from office of the hated Metternich.\n\nBy June, the revolt in Prague was put down by military force.\n\nIn November, the emperor was firmly in control in Vienna.\n\nA dispute also emerged over the question of where to draw the borders of the new Germany.\n\nThose who favored the Grossedeutsch plan wanted to see all German lands, united under German rule.\n\nKleindeutsch supporters felt that the more realistic solution would be to include only Prussia and the smaller German states.\n\nThe delegates settled on the Kleindeutsch, and they offered the German Imperial throne to William IV, the King of Prussia.\n\nHe did not want a “crown picked up from the gutter” and declined the offer.\n\nThis became a lost opportunity to build a German nation under liberal parliament rather than a militaristic Prussian state.\n\nFrankfurt Parliament\n\nOn May 18, elected representatives from all the German states gathered in Frankfurt to participate in what they thought was going to be the birth of a nation.\n\nIt was hampered by the political inexperience of its participants and by conflicting aims; while all wanted to see a unified German nation.\n\nTwo nations avoided the turmoil of revolution in 1848: Russia and Great Britain.\n\nRepression in Russia was so complete under the reign of Nicholas I.\n\nIn Great Britain (1848), marked the peak year for Chartism.\n\nChartism: Centered on the belief that the problems of the working class could be corrected by changes in the political organization of the country.\n\nThe People’s Charter of 1838, from which the movement received its name, contained six points:\n\nUniversal adult-male suffrage;\n\nThe secret ballot;\n\nAbolition of property requirements for Members of Parliament;\n\nPayment to Members of Parliament;\n\nEqual electoral districts; and\n\nAnnual parliament6s with yearly elections.\n\nIn April 1848, a mass meeting was scheduled in London for the presentation of the Charter to the House of Commons.\n\nIf the petition were once again rejected by Parliament, the Chartist Convention planned to transform itself into a National Assembly that would take over the government of the country.\n\nIn London, there were preparations for a violent conflict, and Queen Victoria was sent out of London for safety.\n\nOn April 10, the day of the mass meeting, the situation was tense as 200,000 individuals gathered to sign the petition.\n\nThe petition was presented to the House of Commons, but the House refused to even debate the clauses contained in the petition.\n\nReform did eventually come about in incremental stages; by the early 20th century, five of the six acts of the Charter were established parts of the British Constitution.\n\nGreat Britain was the first European nation to begin the process of industrialization.\n\nAfter the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Britain achieved political stability that encouraged economic investment.\n\nGreat Britain permitted a much greater degree of religious toleration.\n\nBritain’s increased population size produced not only a large body of potential low-wage workers for the factories but also a steady supply of consumers.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, initiated by men such as Jethro Tull — introduced scientific farming to Great Britain.\n\nCrop rotation increased crop yield and boosted turnips and beets, which could feed more animals in the winter.\n\nAs a result of the Agricultural Revolution and the rise of cottage industries, England was already involved in manufacturing industries.\n\nEnclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19th centuries:\n\nIt forced small-scale farmers into urban areas, making larger farms more efficient and providing low-paid factory labor.\n\nThe increased prosperity of English farms led to an increase in capital that could be used to invest in new industries.\n\nGreat Britain also had a central bank that encouraged the flow of money in the economy\n\nThe 18th century witnessed a significant increase in Great Britain’s overseas trade.\n\nIt provided the nation with the world’s largest merchant marine.\n\nThe 18th century also witnessed the height of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nTransportation within Great Britain was enhanced by the fact that the entire nation lies within close proximity to the sea.\n\nA network of navigable rivers and the creation of canals made water transport efficient.\n\nTurnpike trusts built new roads in Great Britain on a scale not seen since the end of Roman rule.\n\nGreat Britain’s two critical natural resources of the Early Industrial Revolution: coal and iron.\n\nThe first 18th-century technological advances occurred in cotton manufacturing.\n\nIn 1733, John Kay invented the flying shuttle, which increased the speed at which weavers could make cloth.\n\nThis invention created a problem: cloth could be made so rapidly that it outstripped the supply of thread.\n\nBy 1765, James Hargreaves, solved Kay’s problem, by inventing the spinning jenny.\n\nA machine that initially spun 16 spindles of thread at one time.\n\nImprovements allowed it to spin as many as 120 spindles at once.\n\nRichard Arkwright’s invention of the water frame marked the development of the Industrial revolution.\n\nIt is a huge apparatus that combined spindles and rollers to create a spinning machine to spin cloth.\n\nBy 1770, Arkwright employed 200 individuals under one roof in what is known to be the first modern factory, making a half-million-pound fortune for himself.\n\nLabor-saving was useful because British cloth manufacturing was constrained by labor supply.\n\nHuge thanks to cotton imports and increased wool supply, labor savings actually resulted in more cloth to sell.\n\nColonization and slavery made cotton imports possible, fueling the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe first factories were built along streams and rivers to harness energy for machinery.\n\nSteam engines made it possible for factories to work on these locations.\n\nJames Watt studied the steam pump and adapted it for use in industry.\n\nHis invention was the first true steam engine.\n\nHe also invented an engine that turned a wheel. This made factories independent of waterpower.\n\nSmelting iron is one of the greatest factors that contributed to the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIron was smelted traditionally in extremely hot ovens fueled by charcoals.\n\nAbraham Darby discovered a means of smelting iron using coal.\n\nAnother important invention in the 19th century Industrial revolution is the railroad.\n\nThe first passenger railroad traveled between Liverpool and Manchester in 1830.\n\nBy the middle of the century, Britain was crisscrossed with railroad tracks.\n\nthat carried passengers and goods throughout the land.\n\nSome of the machines and structures associated with railroads included engines, tracks, stations, tunnels, and hotels for travelers.\n\nBelgium was the first to industrialize, it had a plentiful supply of coal and iron.\n\nThe German states were hampered by numerous tolls and tariffs, making the transportation of goods extremely expensive.\n\nTo aid in the spread of trade and manufacturing, Prussia in 1834 took the lead by creating the Zollverein.\n\nA customs union that abolished tariffs between the German states.\n\nScientific Socialism: The most significant strand in socialist thought — offered by Karl Marx.\n\nMarx was born in the German city of Trier and eventually received a university education at Jena.\n\nHe became the editor of a Cologne newspaper, the Rheinische Zeitung, but he soon found that his political views were considered too radical by the authorities.\n\nThis led Marx to seek the freer intellectual climate of Paris.\n\nThe French quickly grew tired of Marx, so he left Paris for London where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nMarx and his colleague Friedrich Engels organized a Communist League to link the far-flung German Socialists who were living in exile.\n\nIn 1848, they teamed up to write “The Communist Manifesto.”\n\nIt viewed all the history from the beginning of time, an idea that was labeled as historical materialism.\n\nThe origin of this idea can be found in the writings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nThe development of capitalism led to the creation proletariat — a working class.\n\nIn what Marx admitted would be a violent struggle by the workers, the state would dominate, but it would wither away when all other classes were eliminated.\n\nDas Kapital: An enormous treatise on capitalism that explains the mechanics by which capitalists extract profit from labor.\n\nFirst International (1864): Marx founded it to \"afford a central medium of communication and cooperation\" for organizations seeking \"protection, advancement, and complete emancipation of the working classes.\"\n\nTrade Unionists, Mazzini Republicans, Marxists, and Anarchists were all members of the First International.\n\nInternal conflicts eventually led the First International to dissolve in 1876.\n\nAfter Marx’s death, Engels helped organize the Second International, a loose federation of the world’s socialist parties heavily influenced by Marxism that met for the first time on July 14, 1889.\n\nA dispute over who would control access to Jerusalem's Christian holy sites sparked the war.\n\nBritish and French officials worried that Ottoman weakness was encouraging Russian adventurism in the Balkans and that the Russians could occupy Istanbul and gain access to the Mediterranean.\n\nAfter the Ottomans' naval defeat, France and Great Britain declared war on the Russians.\n\nFlorence Nightingale (1820–1910) revolutionized nursing after most of the half-million casualties died from disease in filthy field hospitals.\n\nThe war came to an ignominious end after the fall of the Russian fortress of Sevastopol, Russia’s chief port in the northern Black Sea and nearest access to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Russians were reluctant to quit, but the Austrians threatened to join the British and French if Russia didn't accept the peace terms. Russia had to cede Danube River territories and accept a Black Sea warship ban.\n\nWithout power in the Black Sea or along the Danube, the Russian navy was trapped in Baltic ports, subject to Swedish and Danish tolls.\n\nThe real cost of war was that the Concert of Europe, the idea that the great powers should work together—a concept that emerged from the Congress of Vienna —was finally shattered.\n\nDuring the Crimean War, the Germans and other Europeans had no sense of unity on such questions.\n\nThe Crimean crisis horrified the British public, making them more isolationist toward Europe.\n\nIn 1848, Italian liberals made an aborted attempt to create an Italian state.\n\nAfter regaining power in Rome, Pope Pius IX promoted reactionary policies.\n\nLiberals no longer believed in a pope-led Italian federation.\n\nRisorgimento: The true architect of Italian unification — Count Camillo di Cavour, Victor Emmanuel’s chief minister.\n\nCavour was more practical and focused on boosting Sardinian power.\n\nHe cleverly entered the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in the Crimean War on France and Great Britain's side, earning Napoleon III's gratitude.\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to help the Sardinians because Austria was a French enemy.\n\nNapoleon III also sought foreign military adventures to live up to his famous namesake, which ultimately doomed him.\n\nThe war began in April 1859. After defeating the Austrians in several battles, Napoleon decided to end the war before expelling them from Italy.\n\nHe was horrified by the conflict's high casualties and threatened by Prussia's Rhine troop buildup to aid the Austrians.\n\nCavour resigned as prime minister after Napoleon's aborted war and betrayal of the Sardinia treaty, but he returned a year later.\n\nNapoleon and Cavour wanted to unite northern Italy. Napoleon feared a unified Italy would threaten France.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi: One of the most intriguing characters in Italian history.\n\nHe was a Young Italy member of Mazzini's romantic Italian nationalism.\n\nGaribaldi was horrified by the treaty between Sardinia and France, which required Italy to cede Savoy and Nice to France.\n\nHe initially threatened to attack France.\n\nInstead, Cavour advised Garibaldi to invade the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, believing it would be suicidal.\n\nGaribaldi's 1,000 \"red shirts\" overthrew the Bourbons' incompetent rule in southern Italy.\n\nCavour was appalled at the prospect of Garibaldi unifying Italy under his charismatic leadership rather than Piedmont's.\n\nCavour sent troops to Naples to halt Garibaldi.\n\nHe wanted the papal lands, so he waited for a popular revolt and then sent Sardinian troops into all of the pope's lands except Rome to restore order.\n\nThis was followed by the declaration of Victor Emmanuel as the first king of Italy on March 17, 1861.\n\nOnly Venetia and Rome were not under Italian rule after the papal invasion.\n\nItaly took Venetia in 1866 after Prussia defeated Austria.\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, Italy added Rome as its capital in 1870.\n\nThe industrialized north of Italy and the impoverished south remain economically divided.\n\nThe Catholic Church's hostility, which banned Catholics from voting in national elections despite widespread defiance, was a major issue for the new state.\n\nThe Church did not reconcile with Italy until 1929, when Mussolini returned Vatican City's sovereignty to the papacy.\n\nThe military and economic power of a unified Germany in 1871 changed Europe's power balance.\n\nThe story of German unification is rooted in the Napoleonic era.\n\nNapoleon's rule over large parts of Germany unified Germany and increased German patriots' desire for unification.\n\nFrederick William refused the crown from the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848, delaying German unification until the Prussians found a better way.\n\nPrussia's Zollverein gave it economic dominance over the other member states, while Austria was specifically excluded.\n\nPrussia had industrialized while Austria remained agricultural by mid-century.\n\nPrussia was German-dominated, while the Austrian Empire was multilingual.\n\nPrussia enjoyed the services of one of the most remarkable statesmen of the 19th century, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898).\n\nOne of the 19th century's greatest statesmen, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898), served Prussia.\n\nWilliam fought parliament over military reforms to challenge Austrian supremacy in the German Confederation.\n\nHe gave the Prussian army modern weapons to unify Germany.\n\nThis plan began in 1864 with an alliance with Austria against Denmark over Schleswig and Holstein.\n\nSchleswig was ruled by Prussia and Holstein by the Austrians after Prussia was easily defeated the Danes in the Danish war.\n\nBy 1866, Prussia had allied with Italy and secured a French promise of nonparticipation.\n\nPrussia, under Bismarck's orders, declared war on Austria over a minor dispute over Holstein's governance.\n\nThe Seven Weeks' War saw the Prussian army defeat Austria in seven weeks after modernizing.\n\nBismarck wisely treated Austria with courtesy to keep her out of the next stage of his plan—a war with France.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Austrians, Bismarck annexed those small German states in the north that had supported Austria in the conflict.\n\nPrussia convinced northern German states to join the North German Confederation.\n\nThe states of southern Germany, while remaining independent, concluded a military alliance with Prussia in case of French aggression.\n\nIn 1870, Bismarck started the Franco-Prussian War, completing his plan.\n\nBismarck, who desired war, rewrote the \"Ems dispatch,\" a telegram sent by the Prussian king to Bismarck informing him of his conversation with the French ambassador, to make it seem like the king had insulted France.\n\nOn January 18, 1871, William I was proclaimed in the palace of Versailles as German emperor.\n\nThe creation of the German Empire completely changed the direction of European history.\n\nFrance lost Alsace and Lorraine and paid a huge indemnity to the new German state for starting the war.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 19th century, this new German state's economic power strained relations with Great Britain and spurred colonial expansion.\n\nBismarck encouraged the French to build an African empire to distract from Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nAll European nations wanted overseas empires.\n\nIt advanced their political and economic interests in Europe adjusting to a powerful German state.\n\nBismarck launched the \"Kulturkampf\" to control all church appointments and Catholic education, fearing that Catholics were more loyal to the church than to Germany.\n\nIn 1878, Bismarck petitioned the Reichstag to ban Socialists' right to assemble and publish.\n\nHe also established old-age pensions and other social benefits for all Germans to reduce the Socialists' appeal.\n\nBismarck ruled at the pleasure of the king, not the people, and his poor relations with Wilhelm II led to less able leaders taking his place, risking his fragile peace with Russia and sacrificing German stability for German glory.\n\nThe introduction of synthetic dyes revolutionized the textile industry.\n\nThe invention of man-made fertilizers led to increased crop yields.\n\nAlfred Nobel's invention of dynamite allowed him to blast tunnels through rock and remove nature's inconvenient hills.\n\nMichael Faraday pioneered electromagnetism and electricity.\n\nJames Joule defined many of the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nDmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table by arranging known elements by atomic weight and leaving spaces for predicted but undiscovered elements.\n\nIn 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen made an accidental discovery of X-rays.\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity.\n\nThe Curies, Marie and Pierre, spent their lives studying radioactivity.\n\nIn 1910, Marie Curie isolated radium.\n\nErnest Rutherford demonstrated that atomic particles had a nucleus.\n\nIn 1901, Max Planck proposed that energy was delivered in discrete units, or quanta.\n\nHis quantum physics ended Newtonian mechanistic physics.\n\nAlbert Einstein's special theory of relativity, in which time, space, and movement are relative to the observer.\n\nEugène Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People captures the stirring events of the revolution in the streets of Paris\n\nPhotography was a new art form and a major influence on painting by mid-century.\n\nIn 1835, Louis Daguerre accidentally created an image by placing an exposed plate in a chemical cupboard with mercury vapor.\n\nHe developed the daguerreotype process to fix the image after several years.\n\nPhotography would enter into the mainstream with the introduction of celluloid film.\n\nIn the 1880s, George Eastman introduced flexible film and the first box camera, making photography affordable for everyone.\n\nRealists: Those who sought to paint the world around them without any illusions.\n\nGustave Courbet painted works like The Stone-Breakers that rejected romanticism and depicted peasant life in all its grimness.\n\nJean-François Millet's The Sowers depicts impoverished peasants who appear to be growing from the ground.\n\nHonoré Daumier is best known for his July Monarchy cartoons that exposed corrupt politicians and legal systems.\n\nThe Third Class Carriage: It depicts a group of French peasants, their faces creased from hardship, sitting in an obviously uncomfortable railcar.\n\nThe New Imperialism: It is used to distinguish the period from earlier overseas conquests, such as the Spanish conquest of Central and South America, and to describe how European rule changed life in those regions.\n\nBreech-loading rifles, which allowed prone firing, were superior to muzzle loaders used by African gun owners.\n\nSteamships crossed oceans quickly without wind power, and smaller steam-driven riverboats allowed Europeans to penetrate Africa.\n\nThe Telegraph reduced communication between India and London to a day from two years at the start of the century.\n\nIn 1820, quinine, made from cinchona tree bark, was discovered to treat malaria, a tropical disease.\n\nThe new imperialism was built on technological advances. They relied on technology, but it would have failed without the various factors that drove Europeans to conquer other countries.\n\nIn the last quarter of the century, Europe raised tariffs, prompting nations to consider colonies as free trade zones.\n\nPeople traveled to Africa for palm oil, gold, and silver.\n\nSocial imperialists saw imperialism as a way to solve domestic issues like overpopulation.\n\nNationalism also played a major role in empire-building.\n\nEuropean states believed that was the only way to matter globally.\n\nFrance built an overseas empire to prove it still mattered after its 1870 defeat by Prussia.\n\nChristian missionaries were the first Europeans to enter central Africa.\n\nBalance-of-power politics was the main reason for buying unprofitable land.\n\nNations sought colonies to deny others.\n\nCecil Rhodes sought colonial advantage from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo.\n\nSocial Darwinism influenced new imperialism. White people believed they would rule Asia and Africa.\n\n\"The White Man's Burden\" by Rudyard Kipling states that Europeans must \"bind your sons to exile/To serve your captives' need,\" exemplifying noblesse oblige.\n\nAt the Berlin Conference, called to discuss Congo control, imperialist nations pledged \"to care for the improvement of the conditions of their (the Africans') moral and material well-being and to help in suppressing slavery, and especially the slave trade.\"\n\nEuropeans drew new borders that ignored tribal and cultural differences with imperial territories in the \"mad scramble\" for colonies.\n\nThe Berlin conference regulated colonization.\n\nBismarck organized nations to prove they had enough authority in a territory to protect rights like trade and transit.\n\nThis started the mad dash that left every square inch of Africa divided among the European powers.\n\nEthiopia repelled an Italian invasion in 1896. Liberia repulsed on the west coast, which remained independent due to its unique historical link to the United States.\n\nAfter the French left India after the Seven Years' War, Britain took over them.\n\nIn 1849, Punjab became British territory.\n\nAfter the \"Indian Mutiny\" or \"Sepoy Rebellion\" of 1857, an administrative structure replaced the British East India Company, centralizing colonial control.\n\nBy 1877, Prime Minister Disraeli made Queen Victoria the Empress of India, flattering her and sending a message to Europe about Great Britain's importance to India.\n\nGreat Britain was the first European state to practice \"informal empire\" in China, where a state has significant influence over another nation's economy without territorial or political control.\n\nChina gave European states sovereignty over a series of \"treaty ports\" along the coast after losing several wars with European powers.\n\nDespite Thailand's independence, the French took Indochina and its vital rubber plantations.\n\nThe Dutch ruled Indonesia and the US took the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.\n\nAfter the Russo-Japanese War, Japan took control of Korea in 1910, following Britain and Germany's colonial expansion.\n\nBritain's pro-imperial Primrose League had over a million members, and Germany, Italy, and France had similar organizations with far fewer members.\n\nThe Boer War (1899–1902) may have reduced public support for empire in Great Britain, but the working class across Europe seemed uninterested.\n\nIn 1882, Britain established a protectorate over Egypt and the Suez Canal to ensure its dominance over India due to European rivalries.\n\nBritish control over Afghanistan's worthless territory threatened Russia's recent Central Asian expansion and India's security.\n\nIn 1898, Britain and France nearly went to war over Fashoda in Sudan.\n\nIn 1905 and 1911, France and Germany nearly went to war over Morocco.\n\nLeading German political and military figures felt their country lacked a colonial empire befitting its position in Europe, which contributed to the First World War.\n\nBismarck once pointed to a map of Europe and said, \"This is my Africa,\" revealing his true interest.\n\nThe Society for German Colonization (1884) opposed Bismarck's apathy.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II forced Bismarck into retirement in 1890 due to his lack of interest in colonies, which he couldn't stand.\n\nWestern-educated colonized people led resistance groups against the colonizers.\n\nThe Indian Congress Party, founded in 1885, was the main force behind Indian independence from the British Empire.\n\nOther nationalist movements of the time included the Zulu resistance to the British in southern Africa, the Boxer Rebellion in China, and the Meiji Restoration in Japan.\n\nOn July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary invaded Serbia, risking a wider European war.\n\nRussia had promised to protect the Serbs.\n\nGermany, the \"blank check,\" supported Austria-Hungary, which started the war because it was the only power that could have stopped them.\n\nRussia mobilized after the Austro-Hungarian declaration on Serbia.\n\nAs Russian mobilization continued, the Germans declared war on August 1.\n\nThe Second International parties, which had long opposed capitalist European wars and praised international brotherhood, voted in each nation to support the war effort.\n\nJean Jaurès: The idealistic French Socialist Party leader that opposed the war.\n\nOn the eve of the war, a fanatical French nationalist shot him.\n\nAirplanes were used to spot enemy positions, making surprise offensives harder.\n\nThe Germans began the war by trying to implement the Schlieffen Plan.\n\nSchlieffen Plan: Established that, in case of the outbreak of war, Germany would attack France first and then Russia.\n\nBelgium, a nation created in 1830 with the promise of European neutrality, was invaded by Germany.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Belgium broke this guarantee, Great Britain joined the French and Russians.\n\nBy early September, German troops threatened Paris, forcing the French government to flee.\n\nThe First Battle of the Marne, led by General Joffre, stopped the Germans after they crossed the river.\n\nThe armies on Flanders' northern coast scrambled to outflank each other throughout the fall.\n\nBoth sides settled into a longer war by the first winter.\n\nAs the stalemate continued, huge networks of defensive fortifications were built from quickly dug ditches.\n\nAs the war dragged on, soldiers faced rats eating corpses, artillery noise, and extreme boredom.\n\nUnfortunately, both sides insisted on sending their soldiers \"over the top\" into no man's land to attack enemy trenches.\n\nThe war in the east was rather different from that in the west.\n\nAs the fighting in the west stalled, German forces shifted to the east and began to win against the brave but poorly equipped Russians.\n\nBecause of its massive size, the eastern front never became bogged down with trenches like the west.\n\nIn early 1915, poison gas began to be used by both sides.\n\nGas masks reduced gas-related casualties, but they also reinforced the inhumanity of modern warfare.\n\nBritish forces attacked Turkey, a central power ally, to break the east's stalemate.\n\nWinston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, devised a plan, which nearly ended his political career.\n\nChurchill believed that defeating the Turks would allow the British to supply the beleaguered Russians via the Black Sea.\n\nIn April 1915, five divisions landed on the beach of Gallipoli\n\nThe Turks were well entrenched, so the attack failed for most Australian and New Zealand soldiers.\n\nAfter suffering heavy losses, the British withdrew in January.\n\nIn 1916, the Germans launched a massive offensive against the French fortress of Verdun, which France had to defend at all costs or risk public opinion disaster.\n\nGerman artillery included \"Big Bertha\" guns that fired ton-plus shells.\n\nGeneral Philippe Pétain led a spirited defense of the fortress against the Germans.\n\nAfter the German victory in 1940, he became the disgraced leader of Vichy France.\n\nIn one of the war's costliest battles, the Germans attacked Verdun to bleed France dry, but both sides lost 600,000 troops.\n\nBoth Entente powers launched wasteful and ineffective offensives, such as the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele, to break the German lines.\n\nThe German Weimar Republic's tragic story should not be surprising given its difficult birth at the end of a disastrous war.\n\nIn November 1918, Friedrich Ebert became the republic's first president.\n\nEbert used the old imperial officer corps to defeat Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg's Marxist rebellion and secure his republican regime.\n\nEbert approved Free Crops because the army could not put down the rebellion alone.\n\nFree Crops: A voluntary paramilitary group often with extreme right-wing leanings.\n\nThe Kapp Putsch, a 1920 attempt by some Free Corps to overthrow the democratic state, was thwarted by a general strike.\n\nDespite the Versailles Treaty penalties, the republic stabilized by 1924.\n\nGustav Stresemann, leader of the conservative German People's Party, was Chancellor of Germany in 1923.\n\nBy 1925, Germany was slowly rebuilding its relations with the other nations of Europe.\n\nGermany accepted France's borders in the Locarno Agreement.\n\nGermany joined the League of Nations the following year after Stresemann's efforts.\n\nBy 1929, the republic appeared to be gaining ground in Germany, but the Great Depression would show how little support it had.\n\nThe Communists worked to solidify their control over the vast Russian state.\n\nFor three years they had to fight a life-or-death struggle against the White Forces.\n\nAnti-Communist monarchists and republicans are among them.\n\nBritish and American troops, nominally sent to protect Allies' wartime supplies, supported the Whites.\n\nLenin and Trotsky justified their \"Red Terror\" against right-wing extremists and Bolshevik enemies during the Civil War.\n\nBy 1920, the Communists had defeated the various White armies and firmly established Bolshevik rule over Russia.\n\nIn 1919, the Russian Communists founded the Third International to aid in the cause of revolution.\n\nThe Comintern influenced western European Socialist parties as some Marxists looked to the new Soviet state for guidance.\n\nLenin's repression appalled most Socialists.\n\nThis split Europe into Communist and Socialist parties.\n\nThe German Communists saw the Social Democratic Party as a bigger threat than the Nazis, so this left-wing split helped the Nazis rise.\n\nBy 1920, the Comintern focused on aiding the Soviet Union, which held all leadership positions.\n\n\"War communism\" tightly controlled the economy during the Civil War.\n\nIn 1921, sailors at the Kronstadt Naval Base, a Bolshevik stronghold, rebelled against this program.\n\nLenin replaced war communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) after the rebellion was brutally crushed.\n\nThis policy gave the government the \"heights of industry\" but allowed private enterprise to flourish.\n\nTrotsky wanted war communism's economic structure back because the NEP was too ideological.\n\nAs the leader of the \"Left Opposition,\" Trotsky believed that communism could only survive if it spread to other countries.\n\nNikolai Bukharin, the \"Right Opposition\" leader, opposed him in this debate, building communism within the Soviet state.\n\nJoseph Stalin, a Georgian who joined the party in 1902, played a minor role in the November 1917 coup.\n\nHe wanted power within the Soviet system.\n\nStalin and Bukharin cleverly ousted Trotsky.\n\nIn 1927, Trotsky and his ally Gregory Zinoviev were expelled from the party.\n\nStalin waited two years before he also ousted Bukharin.\n\nIn 1936, Stalin began a series of show trials in which his former opponents were tortured into confessing to state crimes.\n\nStalin eliminated the \"Old Bolsheviks\" who had joined the party before 1917, along with anyone else who’re disloyal.\n\nIn 1940, an agent sent by Stalin assassinated Trotsky.\n\nStalin adopted the Left Opposition's plan to rapidly industrialize Russia after gaining power.\n\nIn 1928 Stalin implemented the first Five-Year Plan, a comprehensive, centrally controlled plan for industrial expansion.\n\nStalin forced agricultural collectivization to pay for this unprecedented economic growth.\n\nThe state declared war on the kulaks (wealthy peasants) and sent party cadres to the countryside to kill those who refused to join the collective farm.\n\nAfter destroying their crops and livestock, millions of kulaks were shot or starved.\n\nThe Soviet Union became a major industrial power by the end of the 1930s, while the West was in a deep economic depression.\n\nIn May 1931, Vienna's most powerful bank, CreditAnstalt, collapsed.\n\nGerman and eastern European banks failed as citizens questioned their solvency.\n\nBanks stopped lending and people started saving.\n\nBecause demand fell, so did the number of jobs.\n\nMaintaining a gold standard, a fixed exchange rate between currencies and gold, worsened these issues for many countries.\n\nThe gold standard prevented countries from using controlled inflation to escape the depression.\n\nThe gold standard's problems were exacerbated by the belief that the best way to deal with an economic depression was to tighten the money supply until all \"bad loans\" and \"failed companies\" went bankrupt.\n\nInflation allows people to save more while still having money to spend, but it also discourages them from saving too much because they realize their money will be worth less in the future.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes was almost a singular voice of dissent.\n\nHe believed that deficit spending could fix the problem of private sector demand by temporarily providing jobs and income to boost spending and revive the economy.\n\n\"Priming the pump\" meant temporarily increasing government spending on public works to unfreeze the economy and get money moving again.\n\nGovernment missteps like raising tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing worsened the depression.\n\nBy 1932, the economies of Europe were performing at only half the 1929 level.\n\nIn the US and Germany, almost one-third of the workforce was unemployed due to the depression.\n\nIn the US, a stable democracy, those in the depression elected Franklin Roosevelt and supported his New Deal.\n\nIn Germany, a weak democracy, republican institutions died and fascism triumphed.\n\nItaly became the first country to have a fascist government before the Great Depression of 1929.\n\nFascism in Italy grew out of national dissatisfaction with its First World War participation.\n\nIn 1915, Italy joined the Entente powers to gain control over Austria-Hungary's Italian-speaking regions.\n\nItaly's military participation was initially disastrous, leading to the near-collapse of the Italian front in 1917, but Italy stayed in the war and helped the Entente powers win.\n\nIn 1919, proportional representation gave parties legislative seats based on their national vote percentages.\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, angry workers occupied factories, threatening a Bolshevik state and changing Italian politics.\n\nThe founder and leader of the Italian Fascists were Benito Mussolini.\n\nHis father was a Socialist who named his son after the Mexican revolutionary Benito Juarez.\n\nMussolini adopted his father’s Socialist beliefs and became the editor of the party newspaper.\n\nMussolini wrote, “The national flag is a rag that should be placed in a dunghill.”\n\nNational Fascist Party — founded by Mussolini.\n\nThe party quickly formed paramilitary squads to fight leftist groups, earning the gratitude of factory owners and landowners who gave the party much-needed cash.\n\nBy 1921, the party had begun to elect members of the Italian parliament.\n\nBy October 1922, Mussolini demanded that King Victor Emmanuel III appoint him and other Fascists to cabinet posts.\n\nMussolini ordered his black-shirted thugs to march on Rome and seize power to support his demands.\n\nIf the king had declared martial law and called in the army, the Fascists would have been easily defeated.\n\nThe Fascist march on Rome was a celebration, not a coup.\n\nFortunately for Mussolini, his consolidation of political power faced little opposition.\n\nAfter taking over in 1922, he only played parliamentary leader for a few months.\n\nHe then made constitutional changes to remove democratic constraints.\n\nIn 1924, Mussolini and the party murdered a Socialist politician, which shattered his early power.\n\nMussolini struggled to make Italy Fascist, possibly due to the country's nature.\n\nIn 1929, he signed the Lateran Pact with the papacy, making peace with established institutions like the Catholic Church.\n\nFor the first time, the papacy officially recognized the Italian state.\n\nMussolini tried to implement the new Italy's corporatist economic program, but it failed.\n\nIn March 1930, Hermann Müller resigned over an unemployment insurance crisis that was becoming too much for the German government due to the depression.\n\nThis was Germany's last democratic government before WWII.\n\nPaul von Hindenburg's presidency made the Weimar Republic's future uncertain.\n\nHindenburg selected Heinrich Brüning, the leader of a middle-of-the-road Catholic party.\n\nBrüning's economic program would have increased left-right political opposition without fixing the economy.\n\nBrüning used Article 48, a Weimar Constitution emergency decree, to govern by presidential decree because he could not win a parliamentary majority.\n\nBrüning believed voters would support austerity.\n\nInstead, the Nazis emerged as the big winners.\n\nThe Nazis went from 12 Reichstag seats to 102 after the election.\n\nBy the spring of 1932, Hindenburg replaced Brüning with wealthy anti-parliamentary conservative Franz von Papen.\n\nIn November, the Nazis won 196 Reichstag seats, making them the largest party.\n\nIn January 1933, Hindenburg asked Hitler to become chancellor.\n\nIt was a remarkable achievement for the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler.\n\nHitler joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party, one of the early Weimar Republic's extremist groups, in 1919.\n\nBy 1923, he believed the party was strong enough to seize power, so he launched the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich which led to failure.\n\nHitler wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle) in prison, expressing his extremist views and his desire to overturn the Treaty of Versailles, which many Germans shared.\n\nAfter the Beer Hall failure in 1923, Hitler decided to use the political system to gain power instead of a coup.\n\nNazi-armed thugs supported their political rallies and disrupted Mussolini's Fascist meetings.\n\nStreet fighting became common in Berlin and other German cities in Weimar.\n\nIn 1933, Hitler became chancellor and quickly consolidated his power.\n\nThe Reichstag building in Berlin was set on fire on February 27, 1933, but the perpetrator is unknown.\n\nNazis, who may have started the fire, blamed the Communists.\n\nHitler convinced the Reichstag to grant him emergency powers, allowing him to abolish nearly all human rights and give the executive branch almost complete power.\n\nDespite ruling Germany, the Nazis received only 44% of the vote in the last election before World War II.\n\nHitler's Enabling Act gave the party emergency powers to govern the state and merged the chancellor and president's powers into one with a non-republican title, the führer.\n\nBy the summer of 1933, Hitler had banned all political parties except the Nazis and attacked the independent trade union movement.\n\nSturmabteilung (S.A): The Nazi political army that had played such an important role in the party’s rise to power.\n\nOnce Hitler was in power, the S.A. was expendable.\n\nIn June 1934, Hitler organized the “Night of the Long Knives,” in which he murdered his old ally Ernst Röhm, the leader of the S.A., who had wanted to make it the backbone of a new revolutionary army\n\nThe Nazification of the German state soon proceeded apace.\n\nThe Nazis worked hard to establish a Ministry of Propaganda under Joseph Goebbels to gain support for such a program.\n\nThe Nazis created a brutal police force to silence political opposition and intimidate anyone who might disagree with the party line.\n\nVersailles created Poland from German territory.\n\nThe new nation was given a strip of territory that split East Prussia from Germany to give Poles sea access.\n\nChamberlain wanted to stop German aggression. He made a deal with France to defend Poland's borders.\n\nThe Soviet Union also asked if the British and French would form a military alliance against the Germans.\n\nAfter Stalin's purge of the officer corps, the British and French doubted the Soviet military's effectiveness and found little evidence that Stalin was more honest than Hitler.\n\nOn August 22, 1939, Stalin announced that Germany and the Soviet Union had signed a non-aggression pact.\n\nGermany would invade Poland, while the Soviets took eastern Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states, which Russia had lost in the First World War.\n\nFrench political and military leaders were pessimistic after the eastern blitzkrieg and Scandinavian defeat.\n\nThe French built the Maginot Line during the interwar period to protect their soldiers in what they assumed would be another war of stagnant positions.\n\nThe Germans simply bypassed the fortifications, which were not extended to the Belgian frontier, and encircled the French armies.\n\nThe British, seeing that France was about to fall, staged a heroic retreat from the Belgian beaches at Dunkirk, using every available British ship, to bring the army back to Great Britain to fight another day.\n\nFrance's new government was led by Marshal Pétain, the hero of the Battle of Verdun.\n\nIn the First World War, Pétain was a pessimist, and he used the opportunity to create a more authoritarian French government by pulling France out of the war.\n\nOne charismatic general, Charles de Gaulle, arrived in London and called for French forces in the colonies to form a new French army to restore national honor.\n\nThe Maquis, or French resistance, fought the Germans and Vichy state in France.\n\nThe Battle of Britain was not the one-sided struggle that is often portrayed.\n\nIt is true that the Luftwaffe, the German air force, had many more planes and trained pilots. But the British had radar, which had been developed at Cambridge University and could detect oncoming German attacks.\n\nThe British Spitfires and Hurricanes were better planes than the German Messerschmitts. The British had also cracked the German secret military code.\n\nHermann Göring, the inept morphine addict in charge of the German air force, ordered the Luftwaffe to attack British cities after a token number of British planes bombed Berlin.\n\nHe made the decision to stop the successful raids on British air bases that had been carried out.\n\nThe Blitz was a terrible strategy that caused a lot of suffering in the cities, but it gave the Royal Air Force (RAF) time to recover.\n\nHitler decided to abandon his plan to invade Britain by the end of September 1940 and focus instead on achieving his ultimate goal—defeating the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Holocaust: The slaughter of six million Jews.\n\nNuremberg Laws: Depriving Jews of citizenship and forcing them to wear a yellow Star of David on their clothing whenever they left their homes.\n\nMarriage and sex between Jews and Gentiles were also forbidden.\n\nOn November 9, 1938, the Nazis launched Kristallnacht.\n\nThat night, several hundred Jews were killed and 30,000 sent to concentration camps, proving the Germans wanted to exterminate them.\n\nThe Nazis' obsession with the \"Jewish Question\" is shown by their decision to use war resources to exterminate European Jewry even though the Russians were resisting.\n\nHitler ordered his top lieutenants to implement the \"Final Solution\" to deal with them and the many Jews from other conquered territories.\n\nBy 1941, one million Jews had been killed, most in mobile vans poisoned by carbon monoxide gas or machine-gunned by S.S. troops.\n\nIn January 1942, the top leaders met in Wannsee, Berlin, to plan a more efficient slaughter.\n\nAuschwitz was the most notorious Nazi concentration and extermination camp in Poland.\n\nS.S. Doctors, including Dr. Josef Mengele, sorted prisoners into work camps and gas chambers upon arrival.\n\nRoma, homosexuals, gender-nonconformists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Russian POWs, Communists, and other \"undesirables\" were also imprisoned.\n\n6 million Jews and 7 million such individuals were killed.\n\nYad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum and memorial, has a row of trees in honor of Gentiles who risked their lives to rescue Jews.\n\nFrance's Vichy government rounded up Jews and handed them over to the Nazis before the Germans asked for their help.\n\nLocals in Ukraine, Croatia, and other Eastern European countries exterminated their Jewish neighbors on their own.\n\nThe US joined the Axis powers after Pearl Harbor and Hitler's 1941 declaration of war.\n\nBy 1943, the Allies had defeated the Axis in Africa and sent troops to Italy, the \"soft underbelly\" of the Axis.\n\nBy 1943, Italy was out of the war, but its campaign had little impact on the war's outcome.\n\nIn November 1943, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt met in Tehran and agreed to invade western Europe from Great Britain.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, the Allies launched the D-Day invasion.\n\nThe Allied landing in Europe and the Russian counterattack after Leningrad's siege ended Nazi Germany.\n\nOn May 8, 1945, a week after the suicide of Hitler, Germany surrendered unconditionally\n\nJapan entered the Second World War to build a vast empire in the Pacific to exploit the natural resources of conquered lands and sell Japanese goods.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, followed by a second on Nagasaki two days later.\n\nOn August 14, the Japanese surrendered, ending history's bloodiest war.\n\nMost of the 50 to 60 million people who died in the conflict were civilians.\n\nThe Soviet Union lost 25 million people, though the exact number will never be known.\n\nAfter the Germans bombed Warsaw in 1939 and followed up in Rotterdam and London, cities across Europe were leveled.\n\nDresden was firebombed by the Allies, killing 50,000 people and destroying almost every German military, economic, and administrative target.\n\nThe Truemmerfrauen, or \"rubble ladies,\" removed wreckage by hand in Berlin and other German cities without men or machinery.\n\nAfter the First World War, the victors' capitals chanted \"Hang the kaiser!\" but did nothing to punish the war's perpetrators.\n\nAfter the liberation of the Nazi death camps and the realization of the unspeakable scale of the slaughter, the Allies agreed to denazify Germany and punish the perpetrators.\n\nThe first Nuremberg Trial's defendants were charged with \"crimes against humanity\" under the new legal concept.\n\nHermann Göring, who swallowed poison smuggled into his cell to avoid execution while 11 others were executed.\n\nDr. Josef Mengele and other Nazis fled to the Middle East and South America, but Gestapo officer Adolf Eichmann was caught.\n\nBy June 1946, the German legal authorities quietly completed denazification after the Americans handed it over.\n\nWest Germans called 1945 \"Zero Hour,\" the darkest moment in their history.\n\nOver the next 20 years, Europe recovered completely, transforming lives and ushering in a period of political and social stability.\n\nSir William Beveridge, a Liberal Party member, proposed in 1942 that all adults pay a weekly contribution to provide benefits to the sick, unemployed, retired, and widowed.\n\nLabour established the National Health Service (NHS), which provided for a comprehensive system of free health care.\n\nIn 1945, the government took over the Bank of England, railroads, and electric, iron, and steel industries.\n\nThe existing owners received fair compensation, and professional managers—often the same ones—continued to run the company.\n\nThe \"Age of Austerity\" lasted until 1954, when wartime butter and sugar rationing ended.\n\nBy the 1951 general election, the Labour Party and the public were tired of change, giving Churchill's Conservatives another chance.\n\nThe \"Politics of Consensus\" emerged because the two major parties agreed on social services and economic management, even though they disagreed on funding.\n\nBy the 1950s, Western Europe's economies had grown faster than Britain's.\n\nAfter the war, Germany rebuilt its factories with the latest technology, while Britain relied on older factories.\n\nBritain also lacked central economic planning and faced aggressive unions that demanded higher wages without productivity gains.\n\nIn 1979, Prime Minister James Callaghan's Labour government couldn't handle a wave of strikes that hurt road transport and public services — the “winter of discontent.”\n\nMargaret Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister, led the Conservative Party to victory.\n\nThatcherism—her economic policies—included tight money supply control to reduce inflation, sharp cuts in public spending, and tax cuts, especially for higher earners.\n\nThatcher was a divisive leader, and if not for the 1982 Falkland Islands war, her career might have ended early.\n\nIn her third term, Thatcher tried to apply market principles to the NHS and education system, and her party split over her opposition to European integration.\n\nAfter 18 years in opposition, Tony Blair's Labour Party won in 1997.\n\nBlair, who became party leader in 1994, created \"New Labour\" by moving Labour away from socialism.\n\nLabour under Blair focused on improving Britain's social services, reforming the House of Lords, and devolving power to Wales and Scotland.\n\nBlair won a second term in 2001 and a third in 2005, but anger over Blair's support for the Iraq War reduced Labour's margin of victory in 2005.\n\nGordon Brown, Blair's longtime Chancellor of the Exchequer, became Labour Party leader and UK prime minister in May 2007.\n\nBrown served until 2010, when David Cameron became prime minister.\n\nCameron resigned in June 2016 after Britain voted for Brexit.\n\nTheresa May became the Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister in July 2016.\n\nFrance in 1945 had to deal with the grim aftermath of 1940's \"Strange Defeat.\"\n\nAlthough it took several years, Marcel Ophuls's powerful 1969 documentary The Sorrow and the Pity opened the door to questioning these national myths.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2007, President Jacques Chirac addressed France's role in the deportation of 66,000 Jews to Germany and other wartime collaboration issues.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, leader of the French government-in-exile, was expected to rule France after the war.\n\nWhen the Fourth Republic refused to establish a strong presidency, de Gaulle left politics.\n\nThe Fourth Republic dealt with colonial issues like the 1954 Indochina defeat and the 1954 Algerian revolt.\n\nAfter the Algerian crisis raised fears of a military coup in France, de Gaulle returned to politics and led the 1958 plebiscite that established the Fifth Republic, which included the powerful presidency he now held.\n\nFrance refused to sign the Limited Test Ban Treaty and detonated its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 to defend itself.\n\nFrance also had an independent foreign policy, withdrawing from NATO's unified command in 1966 and recognizing China's Communist government over the US's objections.\n\nIn 1945, five million men returned from Germany and needed jobs, the transport system was shattered by heavy fighting in the last year of the war, and coal and food supplies were low.\n\nThis dire situation favored the French Communist Party, which had a good wartime resistance record and appeared to offer economic solutions.\n\nThe Soviet Union invasion turned the party against the German occupiers.\n\nJean Monnet, a European Community founder, designed France's economic program.\n\nThe Monnet Plan created the Commissariat Général du Plan (CGP) to run the economy with nonpolitical technocrats.\n\nIt also created Americanization.\n\nBy 1968, young people were disillusioned with French life and angry about overcrowded classrooms, laboratories, and libraries as more students went to college. Paris was the worst.\n\nStudents and workers formed an alliance, but the students' demand for a complete reordering of French society clashed with the workers' more limited demands for wage increases and better working conditions.\n\nGaullists ruled France until 1981 when Socialist François Mitterrand became the longest-serving president.\n\nIn 1995, Paris mayor Jacques Chirac succeeded Mitterrand, who was reelected in 1988.\n\nHe was the second-longest serving French president, serving two full terms for 12 years.\n\nHe promised tax cuts, job programs, and social reform.\n\nIn May 2007, Conservative "
