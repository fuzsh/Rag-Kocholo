Hermann Rudolf Schubert, born in Saxony 1931. Living in Southern Germany since 1950. Studies: Electronics. Employed at Telefunken till 1993. My first marriage lasted 17 years - my wife did not like to talk about her problems, sometimes for few months, when she felt she had been treated unjustly. During those years I learned a lot about what one should do or what one shouldn't; very often I felt absolutely alone. But we had three wonderful kids. My life taught me what to do: for reasons of self-preservation. I had to leave my first family. In that situation I began to think very intensively about partnership. I had many questions and tried to find the answers: What makes one happy? Money? Love? What is happiness? Why can´t people talk to or understand each other? Why is happiness as brittle as glass? When someone is right - what does the partner think? What about compromises? Can happiness be learned in a partnership? Can one be trained to be content? It is certainly not as easy as the multiplication table in school, however life dreams can come true. And today I have been happy for 35 years in my second life. Two of my kids returned to me and my wife. So I tried to venture into people's psyche and provided possible solutions even for difficult cases. The book "Happiness for me? But of course" was written for people who have personal difficulties living with others. My English translator is Brenda Bantle. She was born and raised in the U.S.A. and is currently living in Southern Germany.
