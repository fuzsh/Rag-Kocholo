In vertebrate: Annotated classification

Subclass Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) Generally lack choanae; no fleshy base to paired fins; no internal nares; air sacs usually function as swim bladder; skeleton usually well ossified. Subclass Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes) Usually possess a choana; paired fins with a fleshy base over a bony

In fish: Annotated classification

Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) Fins supported by rays of dermal bone rather than by cartilage. A group of jawed fishes so diverse that no single definition for them can be derived; better understood by determining the distinctive characters of the primitive members and then tracing their…

In vertebrate: The chondrichthyes

…into two groups: the subclasses Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). The latter group includes the lungfishes, which live in marshes, ponds, or streams, and are frequent air breathers. They lay fairly large eggs, with a limited amount of yolk, that are enclosed in jelly coats like those of…

In fish: Actinopterygii: ray-finned fishes

The Actinopterygii, or ray-finned fishes, are the largest class of fishes. In existence for about 400 million years, since the Early Devonian, it consists of some 42 orders containing more than 480 families, at least 80 of which are known only from fossils. The class contains…

…the most primitive of the ray-finned fishes. They were most numerous and possessed the greatest diversity during the last part of the Paleozoic Era and the beginning of the Mesozoic Era (some 252 million years ago). The earliest chondrosteans were those of the order Palaeonisciformes, a label derived from a…

In Triassic Period: Fishes and marine reptiles

Actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), however, continued to flourish during the Triassic, gradually moving from freshwater to marine environments, which were already inhabited by subholostean ray-finned fishes (genera intermediate between palaeoniscoids and holosteans). The shellfish-eating hybodont sharks, already diversified by the end of the Permian, continued into…

…major subdivisions of the superclass Actinopterygii, the other two being the holosteans and the teleosts. The only living representatives are the sturgeons (family Acipenseridae) and paddlefishes (family Polyodontidae) in the order Acipenseriformes. Some taxonomies also include the

In teleost

…major subdivisions of the class Actinopterygii, the most advanced of the bony fishes. The teleosts include virtually all the world’s important sport and commercial fishes, as well as a much larger number of lesser-known species. Teleosts are distinguished primarily by the presence of a homocercal tail, a tail in which…
