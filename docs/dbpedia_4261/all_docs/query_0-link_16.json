        "text": "Abstract\n\nSpiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha) dominate modern marine habitats and comprise more than a quarter of all living vertebrate species1–3. It is believed that this dominance resulted from explosive lineage and phenotypic diversification coincident with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass-extinction event4. It remains unclear, however, if living acanthomorph diversity is the result of a punctuated burst or gradual accumulation of diversity following the K-Pg. We assess these hypotheses with a time-calibrated phylogeny inferred using ultraconserved elements from a sampling of species that represent over 91% of all acanthomorph families, as well as an extensive body shape dataset of extant species. Our results indicate that several million years after the end-Cretaceous, acanthomorphs underwent a prolonged and significant expansion of morphological disparity primarily driven by changes in body elongation, and that acanthomorph lineages containing the bulk of the living species diversity originated throughout the Cenozoic. These acanthomorph lineages radiated into distinct regions of morphospace and retained their iconic phenotypes, including a large group of laterally compressed reef fishes, fast-swimming open-ocean predators, bottom-dwelling flatfishes, seahorses, and pufferfishes. The evolutionary success of spiny-rayed fishes is the culmination of a post K-Pg adaptive radiation in which rates of lineage diversification were decoupled from periods of high phenotypic disparity.\n\nMain\n\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction fundamentally affected the evolutionary trajectory of terrestrial vertebrates, laying the foundation for spectacular radiations of eutherian mammals, neoavian birds, amphibians, and squamates5–12. In contrast, the impact of the K-Pg on marine vertebrate lineages is less clear. Most marine vertebrates are spiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha), which collectively represent over a quarter of all living vertebrates3. It is hypothesized that the mass extinction of dominant Mesozoic plankton feeders following the K-Pg relieved acanthomorph fishes from previous predation and competitive pressures, enabling their occupation of vacated niches13. Paleogene fossils suggest a corresponding increase in acanthomorph taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity14, and phylogenomic analyses have prompted the complementary proposal that the origins of many major acanthomorph lineages coincide with the K-Pg4, 15. However, the acanthomorph fossil record is sparse in the 20 million years around the end-Cretaceous16, and phylogenomic efforts to date have been limited by sampling designs that inadequately represents the group’s staggering taxonomic richness4, 15. These factors have hindered the resolution of the timing and patterns of acanthomorph diversification near the K-Pg; it remains uncertain if acanthomorph diversification in the Cenozoic was gradual or punctuated, and whether there is a coupling of phenotypic and lineage diversification that is considered a hallmark of adaptive radiation17. A well-resolved, time-calibrated, phylogeny that includes all major lineages is critical to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of spiny-rayed fishes in the wake of the K-Pg.\n\nThe largest challenge to acanthomorph evolutionary studies is inferring a phylogeny of its more than 19,450 species3. The resolution of relationships within the subclade Percomorpha, which contains more than 95% of all acanthomorph species, has been particularly difficult. During most of the twentieth century, inferences of acanthomorph and percomorph relationships relied on anatomical characters that resulted in largely unresolved phylogenetic hypotheses18. Although these early morphological investigations defined major groups of acanthomorphs, their conclusions were dramatically upended by the introduction of phylogenies inferred from a relatively small number of Sanger-sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes1, 19–22. For instance, molecular phylogenies placed the anglerfishes—long classified with the group of non-percomorph acanthomorphs that includes the economically-important cods (Gadiformes)—well within Percomorpha as the sister lineage of the pufferfishes19. In addition, molecular phylogenies have identified several major lineages of percomorphs that each encompass a large number of species and taxonomic families1, 21. As an example, one of these lineages discovered in molecular phylogenetic studies contains such disparate lineages as cichlids, blennies, guppies, flyingfishes, surfperches, and mullets22. Despite this progress, the interrelationships among and within the major lineages of percomorphs and acanthomorphs remain unresolved due to limited informativeness in Sanger DNA sequence datasets and limited taxonomic sampling of previous phylogenomic analyses1, 4, 15, 19–23.\n\nHere, we present the results of comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and estimates of divergence times of 1,084 species representing 308 of the 337 (91.4%) acanthomorph taxonomic families. We additionally sampled nine species from Aulopiformes (lizardfishes), Myctophidae (lanternfishes), and Neoscopelidae (blackchins) to serve as outgroups. Our phylogenomic inferences are based on a DNA sequence alignment of 989 ultraconserved element (UCE) loci and our divergence time estimates were calibrated with 43 fossil constraints. We combine this new acanthomorph time tree with phenotypic data for 680 living acanthomorph species24 to explore the patterns of body shape diversification in spiny-rayed fishes across the K-Pg boundary.\n\nThe maximum likelihood analysis of the concatenated UCE dataset departs from previous efforts by providing confident phylogenetic resolution of nearly all sampled families of acanthomorphs and percomorphs (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Figs. 1-25). The UCE phylogeny differs from a phylogenomic analysis of exon capture data in the identification of Paracanthopterygii as monophyletic, the resolution of a clade containing beardfishes (Polymixia) and percopsiforms (troutperches, Pirate Perch, and amblyopsid cavefishes), and the placement of Beryciformes (containing Berycoidei and Holocentridae) as the sister lineage of the species-rich Percomorpha (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1)15. Our results are consistent with earlier molecular analyses in regard to the resolution of major percomorph clades that each include a large number of taxonomic families1, 4, 15, 19–23. For example, there is strong node support [Bootstrap support (BSS) = 100%] for the percomorph subclade Acanthuriformes25, a monophyletic group comprising more than 2,325 species, including anglerfishes, pufferfishes, butterflyfishes, and scores of other percomorph lineages that long evaded resolution in morphological and molecular analyses (Fig. 2). The relationships among the most inclusive lineages of acanthomorphs inferred from the concatenated datasets are largely corroborated in species tree estimates using coalescent methods from individual gene trees (Supplementary Fig. 26). Exceptions include the placement of codlets (Bregmaceros), Beryciformes, and several lineages of Eupercaria whose phylogenetic relationships have historically been difficult to resolve1, 21.\n\nIn addition to yielding confident phylogenetic resolution among major lineages and taxonomic families, the maximum likelihood UCE phylogeny reveals novel relationships among some of the most scientifically interesting lineages of percomorph fishes (Figs. 1, 2, Supplementary Figs. 1-25). For example, Sanger sequencing studies led to the discovery that the enigmatic coral reef-dwelling engineer gobies (Pholidichthys) are the sister lineage of freshwater cichlids (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 11)1, 21, 22. Whereas these Sanger analyses provided weak resolution beyond the monophyly of these two lineages, our UCE phylogeny resolves the freshwater tropical African and South American leaffishes (Polycentridae) as the sister lineage of the Pholidichthys-cichlid clade (BSS = 100%), providing an opportunity for insight into the evolution of the remarkable species richness and key morphological novelties found in cichlid fishes. We also confidently resolve the near-shore rocky reef dwelling False Scorpionfish (Centrogenys vaigiensis) as the sister lineage to a clade of more than 630 species of wrasses and parrotfishes (Labridae; BSS = 100%) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 21). This newly discovered relationship is not corroborated by the species tree analysis, but consistent with this discovery is that wrasses and Centrogenys vaigiensis share ancestral, highly modified components of the “labroid” pharyngeal jaw apparatus22. This result thereby reduces the number of independent evolutions of pharyngognathy, an advanced feeding mechanism that promotes trophic diversification by freeing the oral jaws from prey-processing functions22. The maximum likelihood phylogeny inferred from our UCE dataset provides an important framework for further exploration of the relationships among the most closely related lineages of acanthomorph and percomorph fishes.\n\nDivergence time estimates for Acanthomorpha, inferred from relaxed molecular clock analyses calibrated with 43 well-justified fossil calibrations, allow for unprecedented resolution of the timing and tempo of family-level lineage diversification. The mean Bayesian posterior age estimates for stem lineages for 80% of living acanthomorph families post-date the K-Pg and are primarily distributed across the Paleocene through the early Miocene (∼65 – 15 Mya) (Extended Data Fig. 2). This pattern contrasts with earlier hypotheses of an explosive origin of acanthomorph familial diversity following the K-Pg mass extinction4, 16. Plotting the accumulation of acanthomorph family origination times reveals an extended period of lineage origination that persists for approximately 40 million years after the K-Pg (Fig. 2). Although most of the taxonomic families assigned to living acanthomorphs originated in the Paleogene, we detect no statistically supported mass extinctions or tree-wide shifts in lineage diversification rates, indicating an indiscernible effect of the K-Pg on acanthomorph lineage diversification (Extended Data Fig. 3). Moreover, stepping-stone simulations, used to evaluate the relative and absolute fit of competing diversification models to the observed time-calibrated phylogeny, strongly support a constant-rate birth-death model (Extended Data Table 1). Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary rates of individual acanthomorph lineages are similarly homogenous across the K-Pg and through the Cenozoic (Extended Data Fig. 4). We observe increases in speciation rates in only a few percomorph clades, such as branches in the phylogeny leading to Apogonidae (cardinalfishes), Pseudocrenilabrinae (most Middle Eastern and African cichlids), Chaetodontidae (butterflyfishes), the species-rich Sebastes (rockfishes), and Lycodinae (a lineage of eelpouts).\n\nAlthough lineage diversification rate remained constant through the K-Pg boundary, acanthomorph body shapes began diversifying sharply at the start of the Paleogene into distinct regions of morphospace that correspond to iconic present-day ecomorphological types (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 27). Our analyses of body shape disparity through time, repeated on a sample of 100 trees from the posterior distribution of BEAST time-trees, show that the sudden diversification of acanthomorph body shapes began an average of approximately five million years after the K-Pg (Supplementary Fig. 28). This period of high between-clade phenotypic variation persisted until the early to mid-Eocene (∼45 – 40 Mya) (Fig. 2). This pattern was not driven by a single clade, but rather occurred across all of Acanthomorpha coincident with the origin of several major lineages (Figs. 1,2, Extended Data Fig. 6a). In contrast, subsequent radiations of acanthomorphs primarily occurred within specific percomorph lineages (Extended Data Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 27). These clades expanded into well recognized ecomorphological types, such as pufferfishes and allies (Tetraodontoidei), the charismatic seahorses and relatives (Syngnathiformes), a group of open ocean predators (Scombriformes), bottom-dwelling flatfishes, a large clade of deep-bodied laterally compressed reef fishes including surgeonfishes, butterflyfishes and rabbitfishes, and Perciformes, which includes many large-mouthed predators that repeatedly invaded benthic habitats (Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 27).\n\nOur estimate of the timing of acanthomorph body shape diversification at the onset of the Paleogene refines inferences from the fossil record. Acanthomorph taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity was low in the Late Cretaceous prior to the K-Pg event, after which body shape disparity and taxonomic diversity became greatly elevated14, 16. The timing of this diversification remained unclear due to a scarcity of deposits yielding abundant and well-preserved teleost skeletons between the Campanian-Maastricthian (∼72 Mya) in the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (∼56 Mya)14, 16. Though isolated acanthomorph otoliths are known throughout this interval, they remain little studied relative to those from Eocene and younger deposits26. Our analyses provide the precision lacking in the fossil record, revealing that the disparity observed in early Cenozoic fossil acanthomorphs was likely the product of an extended period of phenotypic diversification that began approximately 60 Mya and lasted approximately 15-20 Myr. The initiation of a steady accumulation of living acanthomorph families and morphological disparity following the K-Pg extends through much of the acanthomorph fossil gap (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the rise of acanthomorph diversity in the early Eocene was not punctuated16.\n\nThe prolonged expansion of morphological variation following the K-Pg was dominated by divergences in body elongation between clades (Extended Data Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 6b,c), a phenotypic trait that has adaptive consequences. Body elongation is a primary axis of body shape variation in freshwater and marine fishes24, 27 that is often coupled with habitat transitions between pelagic, demersal and fully benthic habitats28, including in the aftermath of the K-Pg extinction23. Our observations of diversification in body elongation shortly after the K-Pg is therefore likely correlated with niche divergence along the benthic-pelagic axis. This pattern of morphological diversification is consistent with the classic trend in phenotypic evolution during adaptive radiation17, although it was not accompanied by changes in lineage diversification rate. Nonetheless, our results imply that conditions in the aftermath of the global K-Pg event promoted exceptional morphological diversification perhaps in response to the novel landscape of ecological opportunity that took shape during the Paleogene13.\n\nOur results provide a new perspective to the role of the K-Pg as a catalyst of vertebrate diversification by demonstrating that its effects on acanthomorph lineage diversification rates and disparity were decoupled. Although there is no indication that acanthomorph lineage diversification rates increased near the K-Pg, much less explosively (Extended Data Fig. 3), the time following the K-Pg undoubtedly played a critical role in increasing taxonomic diversity and shaping the ecomorphological disparity of the vast majority of living spiny-rayed fishes (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). The approximately 15-20 Myr period following the K-Pg brought about the origin of ecomorphological types that acted as a reservoir of diversity, setting the stage for more recent, phylogenetically or geographically localized radiations, including endothermic open-ocean tunas, Antarctic notothenioids, parrotfishes on modern coral reefs, and African Rift Lake cichlids29–32. Though the decoupling of lineage and phenotypic diversification in Acanthomorpha contradicts commonly invoked expectations of adaptive radiation17, this pattern is evident in the evolutionary dynamics of other vertebrate adaptive radiations following the K-Pg, including birds and placental mammals5, 8, 33, 34. Our findings illuminate the origin of phenotypic diversity that characterizes the dominance of acanthomorph fishes in modern marine habitats and broadens our understanding of adaptive radiation in species-rich vertebrate lineages following the K-Pg mass extinction event.\n\nMain references\n\n↵\n\nNear, T.

We generated new sequence data from 647 specimens representing 628 species of acanthomorphs and six outgroups. We extracted DNA from muscle or fin tissue following the standard protocol for Qiagen’s DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits. We prepared dual-indexed DNA libraries and targeted the 1,314 UCE loci enriched by the myBaits UCE Acanthomorph kit from Arbor Biosciences4. Enriched libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms in 2 × 150 bp paired-end runs. UCE data for 360 specimens came from five previous phylogenomic studies (Supplementary Table 1), and UCE sequences for 96 species were extracted from whole genome shotgun sequence data published in the NCBI GenBank35, 36\n\nData processing and phylogenetic analyses\n\nWe used the PHYLUCE35, 36 computer package to process raw read data, conduct de novo assembly and construct alignments of UCE loci. We generated two separate alignments of UCE loci present in at least 75% of the samples: one consisting of all 1,109 specimens (1,084 species) and another including only a subset of the 702 species that overlapped with the taxon sampling of a previously published morphological dataset. The 1,084-and 702-taxon alignments consisted of 987 loci (383,250 bp) and 989 loci (499,957 bp), respectively.\n\nUsing these two 75% complete data matrices, we conducted multiple phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood methods in IQ-TREE v. 1.737 and RAxML-ng v. 0.9.038. We topologically constrained the divergence time analyses represented in Figure 1 with phylogenies inferred in IQ-TREE using single-partition alignments of the 702 taxa and 1,084 taxa datasets. Both of these tree searches assumed the GTR+Gamma model of molecular evolution and used ultrafast bootstrap approximation to generate 1,000 bootstrap replicates and 1,000 replicates of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT). We used the program TOPD_v4.639 to ensure the phylogenies inferred using different partitioning schemes and maximum likelihood programs presented similar tree topologies.\n\nWe also used IQ-TREE’s ModelFinder Plus and ultrafast bootstrap approximation options to infer maximum likelihood gene trees for each UCE locus. In TreeShrink40, we used a false positive tolerance rate parameter (alpha) of 0.05 to identify and remove potentially aberrant sequences from the single-gene alignments. We re-aligned filtered alignments using MAFFTv7.130b41 and used them to repeat inference of gene trees in IQ-TREE. We employed the resulting gene trees to generate a summary species tree in ASTRAL-III v5.6.342.\n\nWe applied Bayesian methods to understand the degree of topological discordance along the backbone of the Acanthomorph tree. We inferred gene trees for UCE loci with Bayesian methods for an 82-taxon alignment that represented the major acanthomorph subclades and was generated using MAFFT. We ran these tree searches in MrBayes v. 3.2.743 for 2 million generations, assuming a GTR+Gamma model of molecular evolution. Using an alpha value of 1.0, we estimated genome-wide concordance factors in BUCKy44 as a measure of the amount of topological discordance between these Bayesian gene trees.\n\nDivergence time estimation\n\nWe estimate divergence times for the 702-and 1,084-taxa phylogenies in BEAST v.2.545–47 using reduced datasets of randomly subsampled UCE loci29, 48. For both phylogenies, we repeated dating analyses on three different alignments of 30 loci. For each of these alignments, we accounted for site-specific variation in evolutionary patterns by selecting the best-fit partitioning schemes using PartitionFinder2 v. 2.1.149. We performed at least three replicate analyses for each 30-locus dataset. We ran all BEAST analyses under a relaxed lognormal clock model and a birth-death tree model, using the IQ-TREE phylogenies inferred from the single-partition, 702-taxa and 1,084-taxa alignments as topological constraints. We used forty-three fossil constraints (detailed in the Supplementary Information) to assign minimum age priors and ran BEAST analyses for a minimum of 200 million generations after discarding a burnin of 200 million iterations. We used Tracer v.1.7.150 to assess convergence of parameters across replicate MCMC chains and ensure there were no directional trends in parameter estimates. For each set of random loci, we combined replicate analyses in LogCombiner and constructed maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees using TreeAnnotator in BEAST v1.8.451, with summarized node heights rescaled to reflect the posterior median heights. MCC trees for the 702-taxon datasets were summarized from 10,000 post-burnin, randomly sampled trees, while MCC trees for the 1,084-taxon datasets were summarized from 1,200 such trees.\n\nDiversification rate analyses\n\nWe removed all outgroup and duplicate taxa from the 1,084 taxa maximum clade credibility tree displaying the highest effective sample size (ESS) and used this pruned tree for all diversification rate analyses. We used TESS52 to conduct stepping-stone simulations that estimated the marginal likelihoods of eight birth-death models, allowing us to calculate Bayes Factors and assess the competing models’ relative and absolute fits to the time-calibrated phylogeny of Acanthomorpha. We examined tree-wide speciation, extinction, and net-diversification rates using TESS’s CoMET model. For this analysis, we accounted for our incomplete sampling, specified a uniform sampling strategy, and ran three replicate reversible-jump MCMC chains until ESS values were ≥200. CoMET runs were checked for within-and between-analysis convergence of the diversification rate parameters as described in the Supplementary Information. Using the same time-calibrated phylogeny, we also inferred rate heterogeneity across lineages using BAMM v.2.5.053. BAMM analyses accounted for the incomplete taxon sampling of taxonomic families and other major representative clades and used empirically determined rate priors identified by the R package BAMMtools v.2.1.654. We ran 23 MCMC chains with different combinations of parameters in BAMM, each for 100 million generations, and we identified the rate shifts along specific branches that were predicted by at least sixteen of these analyses.\n\nPhylogenetic comparative methods\n\nWe pruned a body trait dataset of teleost fishes24 to include maximum body depth, maximum fish width, head depth, lower-jaw length, mouth width, minimum caudal-peduncle depth, and minimum caudal-peduncle width for the 680 species that matched the species represented in the 702-taxon UCE phylogeny. To correct for body size, we regressed log-transformed trait values against log-transformed standard fish lengths and calculated phylogenetic residuals in PHYTOOLS55. We assessed disparity through time using GEIGER56 and the time-calibrated IQ-TREE phylogeny. We repeated disparity through time analyses on 100 randomly sampled time trees from the posterior distribution generated in BEAST, and summarized the mean and 95% confidence interval for the 1.0 My time interval after the K-Pg during which average subclade disparity first dropped below the value simulated under Brownian evolution, as well as the proportion of trees through time that strayed from the Brownian prediction. We tested the sensitivity of disparity through time analyses to the exclusion of body shape traits and of major clades that arose immediately around the K-Pg boundary. Finally, we used PHYTOOLS to visualize body shape morphospace using principal component analysis (PCA) and to generate phenograms that visualize the evolutionary histories of the following seven major lineages: Carangiformes, Lophioidei, Perciformes, Scombriformes, “Squamipinnes” (the clade in Supplemental Fig. 23 defined by Chaetodon kleinii and Luvarus imperialis), Syngnathiformes and Tetraodontoidei.\n\nCode availability\n\nComputer code for analyses can be obtained from the authors upon request.\n\nData availability\n\nAlignments used to perform the analyses in this manuscript are available upon request.

Supplementary Methods\n\na. Taxon sampling\n\nThe phylogenetic analyses included UCE sequence data sampled from 1,109 specimens that include 1,084 species. For this study, we collected new UCE sequence data from 653 specimens. We retrieved UCE loci from the remaining 456 specimens at NCBI from previous studies of acanthomorph phylogeny4, 29, 48, 57, 58 or from whole genomic data (Supplementary Table 1). This study included representatives of all currently recognized acanthomorph taxonomic orders, 307 of the 331 (92.7%) described taxonomic families of Acanthomorpha and 276 of the 290 (95.2%) families of Percomorpha3. Based on previous phylogenetic analyses15, 20, we sampled two species of Aulopiformes and seven species of Myctophiformes as outgroups for the phylogenetic analyses: Notolepis coatsi, Alepisauraus ferox, Scopelengys tristis, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus, Neoscopelus microchir, Dasyscopelus selenops, Benthosema glaciale, Notoscopelus caudispinosus, and Ceratoscopelus warmingii. We sampled phenotypic data from 680 of the 1,075-acanthomorph species sampled in the UCE inferred phylogeny. We inferred phylogenies from the UCE dataset for an inclusive taxon sampling of 1,084 species and for a set of 702 species that included the 680 for which corresponding morphological data was obtained. We refer to these UCE datasets and resulting phylogenies as the 1,084 and 702 species datasets and trees, respectively.\n\nb. Library preparation, target enrichment, and sequencing\n\nWe isolated DNA from tissue biopsies using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits following the manufacturer’s protocol. We used a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies) to quantify 1-2 uL of all DNA extractions. We sheared approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA from each sampled specimen using a QSonica Q800R3 sonicator to obtain fragment sizes between 300-600 bp. For library preparation and target enrichment of UCE loci, we followed protocols described in a previous study4 using Kapa HyperPrep kits (Kapa Biosystems) and Illumina TruSeq iTru5 and iTru7 adapters for dual indexing of genomic libraries59. We used a bait set from Arbor Biosciences designed to target 1,314 UCE loci in acanthomorph fishes for target-enrichment of UCE loci4. Enriched libraries were sequenced using 150 bp paired-end sequencing on Illumina HiSeq platforms.\n\nc. Assembly and alignment construction\n\nTo process raw read data, construct assemblies, identify UCE sequences, and construct alignments for each UCE locus, we used the PHYLUCE computer package35, 36, which uses parallel wrapper functions around external programs to perform tasks required to process high-throughput DNA sequence data. We used the illumiprocessor parallel wrapper program (https://github.com/faircloth-lab/illumiprocessor) to implement Trimmomatic60, which removes adapter index sequences and low-quality bases from demultiplexed raw reads. We constructed assemblies for each sample using trinity v.r2013-02-2561 and used the PHYLUCE program phyluce_assembly_match_contigs_to_loci.py to identify which assembled contigs represented UCE sequences by matching them to a FASTA file containing the UCE bait sequences.\n\nTo supplement these sequence data, we extracted UCE loci from existing genomes of 96 species (Supplementary Table 1). We downloaded genomes from NCBI and converted to 2bit format using faToTwoBit from the UCSC Genome Browser Downloads (https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/). Then, we located UCE loci in each genome assembly by running the PHYLUCE program run_multiple_lastzs_sqlite.py with default parameters and the FASTA file containing the UCE bait sequences. We extracted from each assembly identified UCE loci along with ± 500 bp of sequence from each flank using phyluce_probe_slice_sequence_from_genomes.py with default parameters. We used PHYLUCE to run match_contigs_to_loci.py against the extracted loci, before the UCE data harvested from genome assemblies were integrated with the UCE loci enriched from libraries.\n\nWe integrated these two data sets and used PHYLUCE programs to infer a separate set of alignments and phylogenies for the 702 species including the sampling of morphological data and the full 1,109 specimen sampling using the same protocols. We generated alignments for each UCE locus using MAFFT v7.130b41 and trimmed with trimAL v1.4.rev62. For further downstream phylogenetic analyses, we retained UCE loci that included at least 75% of the total specimens in both the 1,084 and 702 species datasets.\n\nd. Phylogenetic analyses\n\nWe inferred phylogenies for both the 1,084 and 702 species datasets using maximum likelihood methods as implemented in IQ-TREE v. 1.737 and RAxML-ng 0.9.038. In IQ-TREE, we ran tree searches using ultrafast bootstrap approximation until 1,000 bootstrap replicates and 1,000 replicates of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) were generated63. Phylogenies inferred in IQ-TREE using the unpartitioned alignments described above served as the topological constraints for subsequent divergence time analyses. Maximum likelihood tree searches conducted in IQ-TREE used the ModelFinderPlus64 option, which applies a relaxed hierarchical clustering search algorithm to determine partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution.\n\nBefore conducting analyses in RAxML-ng v0.9.038, we determined partitioning schemes using PartitionFinder2 v2.1.149, with units of partitioning based on individual UCE loci. We identified these partitioning schemes using a relaxed hierarchical clustering search algorithm with a maximum cluster size set to 1000 data blocks, the Bayesian Information Criterion method for partition model comparison, and GTR+Gamma as the model of molecular evolution. We removed all fully undetermined columns from our partitioned, concatenated alignment using RAxML-ng, compressed the alignment, and converted to binary. We performed maximum likelihood tree searches on these alignments using the extended majority rule criterion method implemented with the autoMRE command to continue bootstrapping until convergence.\n\nWe compared the tree topologies inferred in the concatenated analyses described above using the program TOPD_v4.639. Phylogenies based on the 1,084 species dataset (IQ-TREE single-partition, IQ-TREE multiple partitions, and RAxML-ng multiple partitions) were compared to one another, and separate analyses compared the three phylogenies inferred from the 702 species dataset. We utilized TOPD to calculate partition metrics, i.e., TOPD’s “Split” method65, and path length metrics, i.e., TOPD’s “Nodal” method66. We produced lists of taxa with different phylogenetic positions among the compared trees using TOPD’s “Disagree” method, which removes a single taxon at each iteration and calculates the reduction in trees’ split distance.\n\nWe inferred a summary species tree in ASTRAL-III v5.6.342, using maximum likelihood gene trees for each UCE locus generated with IQ-TREE v 1.6.12. For individual gene tree inference, we applied the ModelFinder Plus64 option to determine the optimal model of molecular evolution as well as the ultrafast bootstrap approximation with a maximum of 10,000 bootstrap iterations. We used TreeShrink40 to identify abnormally long branch lengths in the individual UCE gene trees and to minimize the impact of misspecified sequences. We used a false positive tolerance rate parameter (alpha) of 0.05 in our TreeShrink filtering to automate the removal of potentially aberrant sequences from the UCE alignment. We re-aligned the TreeShrink-pruned alignments using MAFFT v7.130b41 and re-inferred gene trees using IQ-TREE, as above. We used these gene trees to infer a species tree in ASTRAL-III.\n\ne. Concordance factor analyses\n\nWe used BUCKy44 to estimate genome-wide concordance factors, which allows the evaluation of phylogenetic discordance among individual UCE gene trees. We compared alternative phylogenetic hypotheses among the major lineages of Acanthomorpha using these concordance factors. BUCKy estimates the frequency of topological partitions that occur in a sample of Bayesian gene tree posterior distributions and provides an estimate for their genome-wide frequency and 95% confidence intervals. Because the number of possible topological relationships among taxa increases non-linearly as the number of species included in the analysis increases, large taxonomic datasets are intractable for thorough concordance factor analyses with BUCKy. We therefore used a reduced taxonomic dataset of 82 species that represent each of the major subclades of Acanthomorpha to reduce computational burden. For this reduced dataset, we generated alignments of the 82 species using MAFFT (Supplementary Table 1). We used MrBayes v. 3.2.743 to infer a Bayesian gene tree distributions for each UCE locus. We ran MrBayes analyses with a GTR+Gamma molecular evolutionary model for 2 million generations, with trees sampled every 2,000 generations. Using the BUCKy program mbsum, we discarded the first 75% of sampled trees from the posterior sample of each UCE locus as burnin, summarized branching patterns in the remaining post-burnin posterior distribution, and used an alpha value of 1.0 for concordance factor estimation. These gene tree posterior distributions were then used for subsequent BUCKy estimation of concordance factors.\n\nf. Divergence-time estimation\n\nWe estimated divergence times for both the 702 and 1,084 species phylogenies using BEAST v.2.545 following a protocol used in other UCE studies where BEAST analyses were run using reduced datasets of 30 UCE loci29, 48, 67. We constrained the phylogeny used in the BEAST runs using the IQ-TREE analyses of the 1,084 and 702 species datasets. For both the 1,084 and 702 species datasets, we performed BEAST analyses on three different sets of 30 loci, each randomly drawn without replacement from the entire set of ∼1,000 UCE loci. Exploratory BEAST analyses using sets of 25 and 50 loci yielded similar divergence time estimates, justifying the moderately computationally expensive analyses using the 30 locus datasets. For each subset of 30 loci, we determined the optimum partitioning scheme using the relaxed hierarchical clustering algorithm in PartitionFinder2 v. 2.1.149. For divergence dating analyses performed in BEAST, we employed a relaxed lognormal clock model and a birth-death tree model. We assigned minima for age priors using forty-three fossil occurrences, described below. For each 30-locus dataset, we ran at least three replicate analyses for a minimum of 200 million generations beyond a total burnin of 200 million generations. As MCMC chains progressed, we accepted suggestions provided by BEAST for improving operators’ tuning parameter values. We used Tracer v.1.7.1 to observe effective sample size (ESS) values for posterior parameter estimates, to assess convergence among replicate MCMC chains, and to check for directional trends in parameter estimates50. Though the large size of the phylogenies created computational limits that resulted in moderate ESS values for some parameters, most parameter estimates reached ESS values well above 200. Some analyses were run up to 900 million generations in length to obtain adequate ESS values and ensure no directional trends in and unimodal distributions of parameter estimates. We used LogCombiner in BEAST v.1.8.451, 68 to remove a burnin, and trees from each replicate run were randomly thinned. We thinned the sets of 1,084-species trees such that a total of 1,200 trees would remain across all runs, with an equal number of trees from each replicate contributing to the final summary trees. We randomly thinned the sets of 702-species trees such that 10,000 total trees remained across replicate runs. For each set of loci, we used LogCombiner to combine trees from replicate runs and TreeAnnotator in BEAST v.1.8.4 (Drummond et al. 2012) to estimate maximum clade credibility trees.\n\ng. Diversification rate analyses\n\nWe performed diversification rate analyses on the time-calibrated 1,084-taxa phylogeny that was run for the most generations and therefore had the highest ESS values for posterior parameter estimates. Species diversity of acanthomorph lineages used to determine sampling fractions for all diversification rate analyses were based on numbers of species presented in Eschmeyer’s Catalog of Fishes3, which at the time of the analyses included 19,219 species of Acanthomorpha. We removed all outgroups and duplicate samples of the same species before performing diversification rate analyses, leaving a phylogeny consisting of 1,075 acanthomorph species and a sampling fraction of 0.056. We performed stepping-stone simulations within TESS52 to estimate the marginal likelihoods of eight birth-death models and evaluate their fit to the acanthomorph time-calibrated phylogeny. Competing models included those with constant diversification rates, with episodically changing rates, or with decreasing speciation rates. Variants of the constant rate model with and without a mass extinction event were also tested to assess the potential impact of the K-Pg mass extinction on acanthomorph diversification. We tested variants of the competing models that accommodated the effects of incomplete taxon sampling by correcting for uniform (random) or diversified sampling methods.\n\nUsing the simulated marginal likelihoods of candidate models, we calculated Bayes factors and compared the relative fits of models to the acanthomorph phylogeny (Extended Data Table 1). With the exception of the models assuming a decreasing speciation rate, we ran stepping-stone simulations for 10,000 iterations with 1,000 power posteriors (stepping stones) and a burn-in period of 3,000 generations. Due to limited computational resources, we ran the simulations of marginal likelihoods for the decreasing speciation rate (i.e., continuous) models for 2,000 iterations (a burn-in of 500 generations was removed) with 100 power posteriors. This test of relative model fit greatly favored models assuming uniform (random) sampling methods over diversified methods (Extended Data Table 1), informing our model selection in downstream TESS analyses.\n\nWe extracted the three branching process-models that were most favored in the tests of relative model fit and assessed their absolute fit to the acanthomorph phylogeny using posterior-predictive simulations. We compared the predictive distributions of the gamma statistic, number of taxa, and lineage-through-time (LTT) plots to the empirical estimates.\n\nWe inferred the global speciation, extinction and net-diversification rates through time using the CoMET model as employed by TESS. For CoMET analyses represented in Extended Data Fig. 2, we specified a uniform (random) sampling strategy (ρ = 0.056), conditioned the model on taxa survival, discarded a burn-in of 30,000 iterations, and ran three replicate reversible-jump MCMC chains until the effective sample size (ESS) reached 200 or greater. We assessed convergence within each CoMET run by calculating the effective sample sizes and Geweke diagnostics for the diversification rate, and we assessed convergence of multiple runs using the Rubin-Gelman test.\n\nWe inferred global diversification rates and examined rate heterogeneity across clades using BAMM v.2.5.053. Our analyses corrected for incomplete sampling by accounting for the sampling fractions of 304 major representative clades, most of which are taxonomic families, in accordance with the number of species described by Eschmeyer’s Catalog of Fishes 3. We also used the information on species diversity to appropriately adjust these clade-specific sampling fractions for non-monophyletic taxonomic groups. As in the TESS analyses, we set the global sampling fraction for all BAMM analyses to 0.056. We identified appropriate rate priors using the function setBAMMpriors in the R package BAMMtools v.2.1.669, accounting for incomplete taxon sampling.\n\nWe ran Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations for 100 million generations under the default settings. We also used default settings for MCMC scaling operators and move frequencies. We ran BAMM 23 times, each time under different conditions that might be appropriate for a medium-sized tree consisting of ∼1,000 taxa. Runs tested different combinations of numbers of MCMC chains (2 or 4), temperature increment parameters (deltaT = 0.05 or 0.1) and expected number of diversification rate shifts (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45). We tested the effect of changing the number of expected shifts—despite the setBAMMpriors function in BAMMtools recommending an input of just one expected shift— because preliminary runs suggested that the number of diversification rate shifts is greater than 20. For each analysis, we compared Bayes factors for competing prior models with different numbers of expected rate shifts.\n\nh. Body shape trait data\n\nWe pruned a body trait dataset to the 680 species that matched those in the 702-species UCE phylogeny24. The body shape dataset included maximum body depth, maximum fish width, head depth, lower-jaw length, mouth width, minimum caudal-peduncle depth, and minimum caudal-peduncle width. We measured maximum body depth as the maximum linear distance from the dorsal to ventral margin of the body, anywhere in the region between the posterior edge of the operculum to the anterior portion of the caudal peduncle. We measured maximum fish width as the maximum width anywhere along the body. We measured head depth as the vertical distance from the dorsal to ventral margins of the head passing through the center of the eye. We measured lower jaw length as the linear distance from the anterior end of the lower jaw to the articular-quadrate joint. We measured mouth width as the linear distance between the left and right articular-quadrate joints. We measured minimum caudal peduncle depth as the minimum vertical distance from the dorsal to ventral margin of the caudal peduncle. We measured minimum caudal peduncle width as the narrowest point along the caudal peduncle. Lastly, we measured fish standard length as the linear distance from the anterior tip of the upper jaw to the posterior edge of the hypural plate or to the posterior end of the vertebral column (i.e., in species that lack a hypural plate). We accounted for size by regressing log-transformed lengths against log-transformed standard fish length and calculating phylogenetic residuals using the phyl.resid function implemented in PHYTOOLS55. We used this matrix of residuals for seven traits for phylogenetic comparative analyses using a multivariate framework.\n\ni. Disparity through time analyses\n\nWe assessed disparity through time (DTT) using the dtt function implemented in GEIGER56. We incorporated uncertainty in divergence times by repeating analyses across 100 trees randomly sampled from the posterior distribution. Since we were specifically interested in patterns around and following the K-Pg boundary, we summarized disparity through time in 1 My intervals as the proportion of trees in which the observed subclade disparity fell below that expected from a Brownian motion process (i.e., the expected pattern if the clade is undergoing adaptive radiation) (results in Supplementary Fig. 28). Focusing on the time following the K-Pg boundary, we statistically summarized the 1 My time interval during which the observed subclade disparity first dropped below that expected from a Brownian motion process (results in Supplementary Fig. 28). We tested the sensitivity of disparity through time analyses to body shape traits and to the inclusion of major clades by repeating all analyses to the exclusion of clades that arose immediately around the K-Pg boundary and to the exclusion of each trait, as well as repeating the analyses for each trait separately in a univariate framework (results in Extended Data Fig. 6). We also visualized the evolutionary histories of the following focal lineages using the phenogram function implemented in PHYTOOLS55: Carangiformes, Lophioidei, Perciformes, Scombriformes, “Squamipinnes” (here defined as the clade containing Chaetodon kleinii and Luvarus imperialis), Syngnathiformes, and Tetraodontoidei. We visualized body shape morphospace using principal component analysis (PCA) with the prcomp function. Since the traits had different variances, we scaled all traits prior to performing PCA.\n\n2.

First occurrence: †Mahengechromis plethos from Mahenge, Tanzania142. Resolution in phylogenetic analyses: Several phylogenetic resolutions of †Mahengechromis place the taxon as either a crown lineage Cichlidae or crown lineage Pseudocrenilabrinae142, 143. We follow Rabosky et al.119 in conservatively treating †Mahengechromis as a stem-lineage Pseudocrenilabrinae. Character states: The identification of †Mahengechromis as a cichlid is supported by the morphology of the lower pharyngeal jaw, squamation, and meristics of vertebrae and median fins142–144. Stratigraphy: The Mahenge fossil deposits accumulated in a crater formed by intrusion of kimberlite and U-Pb of a zircon crystal dates the formation of the kimberlite at 45.83 +/-0.17 Ma145. Because the lacustrine sediments predate the kimberlite emplacement it was suggested the age of the fossil deposits are 0.2 to 0.1 Ma younger145, 146.

Phylogeny and classification of Acanthomorpha, and a new delimitation of taxonomic orders in Percomorpha\n\nThe maximum likelihood analyses of the 702-taxon and 1,084-taxon UCE datasets confidently resolve the phylogenetic relationships of all sampled acanthomorph families. The phylogeny inferred from the IQ-TREE analysis of the multiple-partition, concatenated 1084-taxon dataset is represented in Supplementary Figs. 1-25. The results of the five other phylogenetic analyses are available on Dryad. Bootstrap support values across the entire IQ-TREE phylogeny are high, with most nodes being supported by 100% bootstrap support and only 27 of 1,107 nodes (2.4%) having values ≤95%. Tree topologies inferred using the different methods described in Section 1d are largely consistent according to comparisons conducted in TOPD-FMTS v.4.639 (see Supplementary Table 2). Robinson-Foulds metrics across all comparisons were low (≤0.033), as were nodal distances (≤1.046). Supplementary Table 2 lists the 19 species that differ in their phylogenetic relationships across the different analyses. Most of these species are found in areas of the tree that have been historically difficult to resolve, such as Anthiadidae, Carangidae and Apogonidae. Tree topologies inferred in IQ-TREE and RAxML using multiple-partition, 700-taxon alignments were identical.\n\nThe non-percomorph acanthomorphs are classified into eight taxonomic orders: Lampriformes, Percopsiformes, Polymixiiformes (a single genus, Polymixia) Zeiformes, Gadiformes, Stylephoriformes (a single species, Stylephorus chordatus), Trachichthyiformes, and Beryciformes (Fig. 1).\n\nThe new UCE-inferred phylogeny provides an opportunity to reevaluate the classification of Percomorpha to identify inclusive taxonomic groupings that reflect phylogenetic relationships. An initial effort at building classifications based on molecular phylogenies attempted to preserve the ordinal ranks of the clades such as the Pleuronectiformes, Tetraodontiformes, Atheriniformes, and Synbranchiformes174. This classification proposed a delimitation of 33 taxonomic orders in Percomorpha that each contain an average of only 7.4 families and 492.9 species, and resulted in 10% of all percomorph families unassigned to a taxonomic order174. In Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs. 1-25, and Supplementary Table 3 we offer an alternative delimitation of 13 clades that we treat as taxonomic orders to accommodate the classification of all 290 percomorph families. In the proposed classification, each taxonomic order comprises an average 2,226.8 species and 18.2 families.\n\nThe names of the orders in the proposed percomorph classification are consistent with conventions in ichthyological systematics by establishing a link with one of the constituent taxonomic families and using the “–iformes” suffix175, 176. For example, this delimitation of Blenniiformes includes the Blenniidae and 48 other families (e.g., cichlids, livebearers, and mullets) that were previously identified as a monophyletic group in molecular phylogenetic studies1, 4, 15, 21, 22, 177. Previously named Ovalentaria22, this diverse clade of percomorphs had been divided among seven orders174, one of which, Mugiliformes, included a single family, Mugilidae (mullets).\n\nb. Phylogeny of non-percomorph acanthomorphs\n\ni. Monophyly and relationships of Paracanthopterygii\n\nSimilar to other phylogenomic studies, this UCE inferred phylogeny resolves a monophyletic and strongly supported Paracanthopterygii that includes Polymixia (beardfishes), Percopsiformes, Zeiformes, Stylephorus chordatus (Tube-eye), and Gadiformes (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1)4, 15, 178. While relationships within Paracanthopterygii differ among phylogenomic studies, the resolution of a clade containing Polymixia and Percopsiformes is the best-supported topology in the concordance factor analysis, with the 95% credible interval of the two alternative resolutions of Polymixia not overlapping with the optimal tree topology (Extended Date Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nii. Phylogenetic relationships of Lampriformes\n\nThe new UCE phylogeny of Acanthomorpha resolves Lampriformes as the sister lineage of Paracanthopterygii (Fig. 1), which agrees with a previous phylogenetic analysis of UCE loci4. Other studies offer conflicting phylogenetic positions for Lampriformes; a phylogenomic analysis of ∼1,000 exons resolve lampriforms as the sister lineage of the Acanthopterygii15, while morphological phylogenies place the lampriforms as the sister lineage of all other Acanthomorpha18. The Bayesian concordance factor analyses result in overlapping 95% credible intervals for the phylogeny that places lampriforms as sister to Paracanthopterygii and the phylogeny that resolves lampriforms as the sister lineage of all other acanthomorphs (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The phylogeny that resolves lampriforms and Acanthopterygii as sister lineages scored the lowest concordance factors and the 95% credible interval of its concordance factors do not overlap with the credible interval of the phylogeny that resolves Lampriformes as the sister lineage of Paracanthopterygii (Extended Data Fig. 1b).\n\niii. Phylogenetic relationships of Gadiformes\n\nThe new UCE phylogeny of Gadiformes is similar to a recent study that utilized DNA sequences from more than 14,000 portions of protein coding genes 179. Results from the two analyses are congruent in resolving Bregmaceros (codlets) as the sister lineage of all other Gadiformes, but differ in three specific relationships. The UCE phylogeny resolves Muraenolepididae (eel cods) and Trachyrincidae (armored grenadiers) as sister lineages, but the exon phylogeny resolves Melanonus (pelagic cods) as the sister lineage of Muraenolepididae. The UCE phylogeny places Merlucciidae (merluccid hakes) as the sister lineage of an inclusive clade containing Phycidae (phycid hakes), Lotidae (hakes and burbots), and Gadidae (cods and haddocks), but the exon phylogeny resolves Merlucciidae as the sister lineage of a clade containing Eulichthys polynemus (Eucla cod), Muraenolepididae, Melanonus, Trachyrincidae, Moridae, Macruronus (blue grenadiers), Lyconus (Atlantic hakes), Bathygadidae (rattails), Steindachneria argenta, and Macrouridae. Lotidae is resolved as monophyletic in the exon phylogeny179, but this lineage is paraphyletic in the UCE phylogeny with Lota lota (Burbot) resolved as the sister lineage of a clade containing Brosme brosme (Cusk), Molva (lings), and Gadidae (true cods) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\niv. Phylogenetic relationships of Acanthopterygii and resolution of the sister lineage of the hyper-diverse Percomorpha\n\nAcanthopterygii includes Trachichthyiformes, Beryciformes, and Percomorpha (Fig. 1). The earliest molecular studies identified the sister lineage of percomorphs as either a monophyletic group consisting of Trachichthyiformes and Beryciformes1, 20 or the beryciform subclade Holocentridae (squirrelfishes)21. The UCE inferred phylogeny presented in this study and previous phylogenomic analyses resolve Trachichthyiformes as the sister lineage to all other acanthopterygians and Beryciformes, which includes Holocentridae, as the percomorph sister lineage4, 15, 178, 180 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). This topology is also the most supported hypothesis in the concordance factor analyses (Extended Data Fig. 1c). The alternative hypotheses, including the phylogeny that places Holocentridae as sister to Percomorpha, produced substantially lower Bayesian concordance factor scores with 95% credible intervals that do not overlap with the scores of the optimal phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 1c). The UCE data presented here reject the hypothesis that Holocentridae is the sister lineage of Percomorpha.\n\nc. Phylogenetic relationships of Percomorpha\n\nPercomorphs are classified in an astounding 290 taxonomic families181, which is more than living birds (252 families) and many more than mammals (167 families), squamates (58 families), amphibians (67 families), and turtles (11 families)182–184. By the middle of the 20th century the vast majority of percomorph families were delimited and considered monophyletic groups175, 185, but relationships among these delimited taxonomic families were woefully unresolved at the start of the 21st century186, 187. This lack of phylogenetic resolution among the nearly 300 taxonomic families led to the now famous analogy that Percomorpha was the “bush at the top” of the teleost phylogeny188. Since the start of the 21st century, however, molecular studies have offered dramatic resolution of percomorph relationships1, 4, 15, 21. The UCE phylogeny inferred in this study resolves the species sampled from 276 taxonomic families into one of twelve taxonomic orders that contain more than one family. All 12 of these inclusive lineages are monophyletic and strongly supported in the UCE phylogeny (Figs. 1,2, Supplementary Figs. 3-25). Relationships are consistent with previous efforts using Sanger sequenced loci and phylogenomic analyses, but no prior analysis included a high fraction (276 of 290) of the percomorph families.\n\nThe UCE phylogeny has strong node support along the backbone of Percomorpha including Eupercaria, which is an inclusive clade containing Perciformes, Centrarchiformes, Labriformes, Acropomatiformes, and Acanthuriformes (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 16-25). Previous phylogenetic analyses strongly support monophyly of Eupercaria but provide little resolution and node support for the interrelationships of its constituent lineages1, 15, 21. The only node in the UCE percomorph phylogeny shared among the delimited 13 taxonomic orders that is not supported with a bootstrap score of 100% is the resolution of Acropomatiformes and Acanthuriformes as a clade, which is supported with a bootstrap score of 99% (Supplementary Fig. 22).\n\ni. The deepest node in the phylogeny of percomorphs: the phylogenetic relationships of Ophidiiformes\n\nOphidiiformes (cusk eels) is resolved as the sister lineage to all other percomorphs (Fig. 1). Relationships within this species-rich lineage of mostly marine fishes are not well known and the delimitation of taxonomic families is in flux189. The UCE phylogeny resolves two clades in Ophidiiformes that correspond to the suborders Bythitoidei and Ophidioidei (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3). Within Bythitoidei, the families Dinematichthyidae (pygmy brotulas) and Bythitidae (livebearing brotulas) are both monophyletic (Supplementary Fig. 3). As discovered in previous studies189–191, the formerly recognized taxonomic families Parabrotulidae and Aphyonidae are phylogenetically nested in Bythitidae (Supplementary Fig. 3). Historically, Ophidioidei contained Ophidiidae and Carapidae, but the UCE phylogeny (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3) as well as previous studies using whole mtDNA genome sequences and Sanger sequenced nuclear genes resolve Carapidae as phylogenetically nested within Ophidiidae1, 21, 119, 192, prompting the synonymization of the family Carapidae with Ophidiidae174.\n\nii. Phylogenetic relationships of Batrachoididae\n\nThere is limited taxon sampling of Batrachoididae in the UCE phylogeny, but the subfamily Batrachoidinae (sampled with Batrachoides pacifici and Opsanus tau) is paraphyletic (Supplementary Fig. 3). Porichthyinae is paraphyletic in a phylogeny inferred from Sanger sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes119.\n\niii. Phylogeny of Gobiiformes\n\nOne of the most surprising results from molecular analyses of percomorph phylogeny was the discovery that gobies, cardinalfishes (Apogonidae), and nurseryfishes (Kurtidae) resolve in a strongly supported monophyletic group20, 193, 194. Subsequent molecular studies resolved two competing hypotheses of relationships among the major lineages of Gobiiformes: 1) Kurtus and Apogonidae resolved as a clade, or 2) Apogonidae as the sister lineage of a clade containing Trichonotus (sand divers) and Gobioidei1, 4, 21, 194–198. The UCE phylogeny in this study resolves two major lineages in Gobiiformes: the Apogonoidei that contains Kurtus and Apogonidae, and a clade containing Trichonotus and Gobioidei (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 3,4). The relationships of the eight taxonomic families classified in Gobioidei are identical to phylogenies inferred using Sanger sequenced mtDNA and nuclear genes197, 198 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\niv. Phylogenetic relationships of Scombriformes and Syngnathiformes\n\nScombriformes (e.g., tunas, cutlassfishes and butterfishes) and Syngnathiformes (e.g., seahorses, flying gurnards and dragonets) are resolved as sister lineages in the UCE phylogeny (Fig. 1), a result that is consistent with other molecular phylogenetic analyses1, 4, 15. This particular result has the surprising implication that relative to all other percomorph teleosts, tunas and seahorses are closely related.\n\nTunas, barracudas, cutlassfishes and swordfishes were historically classified in Scombroidei. Early phylogenetic analyses of Sanger sequenced mtDNA and nuclear genes resolved species classified in the traditional delimitation of Scombroidei into two distantly related percomorph lineages199. Xiphiidae (swordfishes), Istiophoridae (billfishes) and Sphyraenidae (barracudas) were resolved in the clade Carangiformes along with flatfishes, jacks and archerfishes (Fig. 1)48. The remaining lineages of the historical Scombroidei— Scombridae (tunas), Gempylinae (snake mackerels), Trichiurinae (cul"
