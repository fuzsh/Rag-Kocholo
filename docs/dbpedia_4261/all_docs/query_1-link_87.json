        "text": "41\n\nLampreys possess a notochord as adults; however, this notochord is surrounded by a cartilaginous structure called an arcualia, which may resemble an evolutionarily early form of the vertebral column.\n\nReview Question:\n\nReview: Shared traits\n\nReview Question:\n\nQuick Review: Jaws and Paired fins\n\nMost cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. Most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces. Shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin, called placoid scales. Some species of sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton.\n\nSharks have well-developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey, including a keen sense of smell and electroreception, with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal. Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things, including their prey. Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals. Sharks, together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians, also have a sense organ called the lateral line, which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water, and is often considered homologous to “hearing” in terrestrial vertebrates. The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish’s body.\n\nNearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium phosphate matrix. This characteristic has only reversed in a few groups of Osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish, which have primarily cartilaginous skeletons. The skin of bony fishes is often covered by overlapping scales, and glands in the skin secrete mucus that reduces drag when swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation. Like sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system that detects vibrations in the water.\n\nAll bony fishes use gills to breathe. Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective, muscular flap called the operculum. Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder, a gas-filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish.\n\nIn the earliest fish most of the skeleton is formed of bone produced by the dermis, hence its name dermal bone. Dermal bone composed all the externally visible bones of the head and trunk and the scales and biting surfaces inside the mouth. There were other types of specialized bone that developed in various early osteichthyans. These bone types are characterized by the complexity, nature, and composition of the external layers of the dermal bones, as well as their growth processes and whether or not resorption was involved in their development.\n\nAmong other bone types found in early vertebrates are perichondral bone (a thinly laminated acellular bone) and endochondral bone. Perichondral bone is often found surrounding soft tissue that passes through cartilage, as can be found in the placoderms with cartilage braincases where the nerves and arteries passing through the braincase wall can have perichondral bone surrounding them. The endogirdles that support the pelvic and pectoral fins also have perichondral bone surrounding them.\n\nEndochondral bone forms around a cartilage precursor. These bones make up much of the internal skeleton in reptiles and mammals and form the arm and leg bones of the appendicular skeleton. Endochondral bone first evolved as a specialized feature in some groups of gnathostomes (osteichthyans and acanthodians).\n\nAs well as these basic tissue types, there are many types of bone involved in dental tissues that evolved in fish and continued on to the higher land animals. Chondrichthyans have a mostly cartilaginous skeleton, but in the dorsal fin spines, they have a type of dentine with a thin enameloid layer. Nearly all the fossil parts of sharks are a similar type of dental tissue, including the placoid scales covering the body that are similar to small teeth. In many early agnathans, there are layers of dentine covering the dermal bone."
