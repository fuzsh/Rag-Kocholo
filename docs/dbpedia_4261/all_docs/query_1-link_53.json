        "text": "What type of animal is a sea horse? Is it actually a fish?\n\nIt is, and there are about 50 species of seahorses. Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales; instead, they have a thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates arranged in rings throughout their body. Each species has a distinct number of rings. Seahorses have a coronet on their head, which is distinct to each individual, much like a human fingerprint. Seahorses also swim upright, a characteristic not shared by other fish. Seahorses are poor swimmers, so they are most likely to be found resting, with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes that can move independently of each other. Seahorses eat small shrimp, tiny fish, crustaceans, and plankton.\n\nClassification of Fishes There are five different classes of fish species within the vertebrate subphylum. They range from jawless predators, which suck on the flesh of other fish, to complex aquatic organisms with immune organs and advanced predatory skills. The jawless fish classes constitute a subgroup of vertebrates referred to as the infraphylum Agnatha, and the jawed fish classes are included in an infraphylum called Gnathostomata. Within Gnathostomata, the bony fish classes fall into a superclass called Osteichthyes. Table 1 outlines these various subdivisions and the major structural features that identify each group. In this section we will consider the species within each of the five vertebrate classes.\n\nMajor Subdivisions Within the Vertebrate Fish Species Subphylum\n\nInfraphy lum\n\nSupercla ss\n\nClass Jaws Scales Fins True Vertebra l\n\nBone Tissue\n\nColumn Agnatha Myxini No No No No No Hyperoar tia No No\n\nYes, unpaired\n\nBeginnin g No Gnathost omata\n\nChondric hthyes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Osteicht hyes\n\nActinopt erygii Yes Yes Yes, ray Yes Yes Sarcopte rygii Yes Yes Yes, lobe Yes Yes Myxini (Hagfish) The roughly 65 species of hagfish that make up the class Myxini have structural features that are quite different from most vertebrates. In fact, there are many scientists that do not consider them to be a class within the vertebrate subphylum, but they rather treat them as a separate group within the phylum Chordata. In this lesson, we will follow the classification schemes that consider them to be very primitive vertebrates. What do they look like, and how do they differ from most vertebrates? One of the most distinguishing features of hagfish is that they secrete large volumes of a thick, sticky slim or mucus from glands that are located along their bodies. This slime makes it difficult to hold onto a hagfish because, once they secrete the slime, they can slither out of your grip. It is likely that the slime is generally used for escaping the jaws of predators. The slime is also capable of suffocating predators by obstructing their gills. After generating a thick layer of slime, a hagfish will often clean itself off by tying its worm-like body in a knot and then moving the knot along the length of its body, scraping off the slime as it goes. A hagfish is shown in Figure below.\n\n[Figure2]\n\nA hagfish of the class Myxini. These animals are sometimes not considered to be members of the vertebrate subphylum due to the fact that, although they have a cranium surrounding their brain, they do not have a true vertebral column. Notice the barbels surrounding the mouth region.\n\nThe mouth region of a lamprey. Notice the round, tooth-filled sucker that surrounds the mouth located in the center.\n\nAs predators, lampreys use the sucker to attach themselves to the bodies of other fish species. Once attached, they scrape through the skin and feed by sucking the blood of their prey, as shown in Figure below. In addition to many fish species, lampreys can also feed on small invertebrates.\n\n[Figure4]\n\nSeveral lampreys using their strong suckers to feed off of a lake trout.\n\nThere are about 40 species of lampreys that exist today. They range in size from 13 to 100 centimeters (the length of a human hand to the armspan of a human). Lampreys live in either marine or freshwater environments, but even marine lampreys must find a freshwater source when it comes time to spawn. Marine animals that migrate to freshwater environments for spawning and development are called anadromous organisms. Lampreys have an extremely long larval stage that lasts about 7 years. During this period they are called ammocoetes, and they have very different features from adult lampreys. In particular, ammocoetes lack teeth and are not predators. The larval years are spent in freshwater, and marine lampreys only return to the sea once they have matured to adulthood.\n\nChondrichthyes (Cartilaginous) Members of the class Chondrichthyes are jawed, cartilaginous fish that include around 950 species of sharks, rays, and a less well-known group called chimaeras or ratfish. Examples of cartilaginous fish are shown in Figure below**.** They have a true vertebral column, an endoskeleton composed of cartilage (as their name implies), paired fins, scales, and a two- chambered heart. As we discussed earlier in the Fish concepts, the ratio of brain size to body size in fish is generally fairly low relative to the ratio in mammals. The cartilaginous fish are an\n\nexception. Most species have brains that are comparable in size to mammals and birds. As you might expect from a large, well-developed brain, cartilaginous fish (particularly some shark species) exhibit a high level of neuronal function including the ability to problem solve and engage in complex social interactions. An example of both of these skills was observed in 1987 when a group of about seven great white sharks cooperated to bring the body of a dead, partially- beached whale deeper into the ocean so that they could more easily feed on it.\n\n[Figure5]\n\nMembers of the class Chondrichthyes. (a) Whitetip reef shark. (b) Ray. (c) Ratfish.\n\nUnlike their bony relatives, cartilaginous fish do not have a swim bladder. They stay afloat due to the presence of a large oil-filled liver and muscular pectoral fins that enable them to generate lift. The oil contained in the liver is less dense than water and therefore provides buoyancy. In some species, the liver may take up 30% of the animal’s body mass.\n\nThe skin of cartilaginous fish is also unusual in that it is covered with small tooth-like scale structures called dermal teeth (also called dermal denticles ). This tough outer layer serves to protect their skin from parasites and other onslaughts. The texture is similar to sand paper, and for this reason it has been used to make food graters, like the one shown in Figure below, that are widely used in Japan for grating wasabi, Japanese horseradish. Another distinction between cartilaginous fish and most other fish species is that they undergo internal fertilization during sexual reproduction. The males have modified pelvic fins called claspers that are used to deliver semen into the body of the female.\n\na lifetime, some sharks will lose 30,000 teeth! That certainly leaves enough to go around for those of us curious about shark anatomy.\n\n[Figure7]\n\nJaws of a Shark. Sharks have powerful jaws with multiple rows of sharp, saw-like teeth. Most other fish are no match for these powerful predators.\n\nActinopterygii (Bony, Ray-Finned) The class Actinopterygii includes over 20,000 species of bony, ray-finned fish. They represent about half of all vertebrate species in existence today and constitute the vast majority of aquatic vertebrates. Species of ray-finned fish include many of the fish species that we are most familiar with such as goldfish, catfish, carp, salmon, trout, and pike.\n\nAlmost all ray-finned species have an endoskeleton composed primarily of bone. Another feature that contrasts with most Chondrichthyes is a plate-like structure called an operculum that covers and protects the gills. Ray-finned fish have a true vertebral column (or backbone), paired fins, and scales. So what exactly is a “ray-fin?” Ray fins consist of webs of skin tissue supported by flexible, bony rays or spines. These fins are not muscularized, so their movements are dictated by body muscles. They sometimes have a feathery, translucent appearance that is strikingly different from both the fleshy, muscularized, cartilaginous fins of Chondrichthyes and the lobed-fins of Sarcopterygii. A close-up view of the dorsal fin of a ray-finned species is shown in Figure below.\n\n[Figure8]\n\nA close-up view of the dorsal fin of a ray-finned fish in the class Actinopterygii. Notice the thin, almost translucent appearance and the numerous bony rays that give structure to the fin and project independently from the main body. Contrast this fin with those of the lobe-finned species shown in the Figure.\n\nAlthough almost all Actinopterygii species are strictly aquatic and breathe only with gills, there are a few species that can obtain oxygen from air and spend some time out of water. These include walking catfish and the mudskipper, which were discussed earlier in the Fish concepts. Both of these species use modified pectoral fins to hobble around on land, for example, when tides retreat or when temporary pools of freshwater dry up. Mudskippers absorb oxygen through their skin, and walking catfish breathe air through their brachial cavity. In fact, walking catfish are obligate air breathers; if they are not able to surface periodically, they will suffocate. Both ray-finned and lobe-finned (discussed below) fish contain swim bladders, which were described earlier in the Fish concepts, to keep them afloat.\n\nSarcopterygii (Bony, Lobe-Finned) According to some classification schemes, Sarcopterygii includes not only bony, lobe-finned fish, but also all of the tetrapods, their direct descendants. In this chapter we are following classification schemes that place tetrapods in separate classes from the lobe-finned fish, and in this section we will focus on the characteristics of the lobe-finned fish. Tetrapods will be discussed in later lessons and chapters. The most important and distinctive feature of lobe-finned fish are, as the name implies, their lobed fins! Lobed fins differ from the fins of other fish species in that they contain a stump-like appendage made up of bones and muscles. These fins are generally rounded and ultimately gave rise to the legs and limbs of tetrapods. Lobed fins often have rays, but they are merely extensions from the end of the stump region of the fin."
