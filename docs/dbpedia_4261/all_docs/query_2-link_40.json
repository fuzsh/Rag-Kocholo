        "text": "Chondrichthyes is a class of jawed fishes having a cartilaginous skeleton. The class includes a diverse group of fishes including sharks, rays, skates and chimaeras. They are mostly marine fishes.\n\nDownload Complete Chapter Notes of Animal Kingdom\n\nDownload Now\n\nThe other group of fishes are bony fishes, which are included in the class Osteichthyes.\n\nChondrichthyes Classification\n\nChondrichthyes is a class of fishes included in the division Gnathostomata as they have jaws. The division Gnathostomata includes all the vertebrates having jaws. Gnathostomata is divided into two superclasses, viz. Pisces (having fins) and Tetrapoda (bear limbs).\n\nPisces is divided into two classes:\n\nChondrichthyes- Cartilaginous fishes\n\nOsteichthyes- Bony fishes\n\nChondrichthyes is subdivided into two subclasses:\n\nElasmobranchii- Sharks and rays, skates, sawfishes\n\nHolocephali- Chimaeras, also known as ghost sharks\n\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Subphylum Vertebrata Division Gnathostomata Superclass Pisces Class Chondrichthyes\n\nChondrichthyes characteristics\n\nThey are mostly marine fishes.\n\nThey contain a pair of jaws. Their jaws are very powerful.\n\nWhale sharks are the second largest vertebrate and the largest fish. Some whale sharks measure up to 15 m in length.\n\nThe mouth is present ventrally.\n\nThey contain cartilaginous endoskeleton, the deposits of calcium salts provide strength to it.\n\nThe notochord is present throughout life.\n\nMost of them contain a heterocercal tail. The tail has two lobes, the upper lobe is elongated and vertebrae extends into it and a shorter lower lobe, giving rise to the distinct heterocercal tail.\n\nThe skin is covered by minute tooth-like structures called placoid scales.\n\nTheir teeth are modified placoid scales and are not attached to jawbones. They are embedded in the tissue. Old teeth fall and are continuously replaced by the new teeth formed behind it.\n\nThey contain 5-7 pairs of gills. Gaseous exchange occurs through the water current that passes over the gills.\n\nThey lack air bladders so they swim actively to avoid sinking.\n\nThey are poikilotherms or cold-blooded animals and lack the capacity to regulate their internal body temperature.\n\nThey are predatory fishes, they feed on other fishes, crustaceans and molluscs. They filter food particles like planktons from the water current that passes through the mouth, pharynx and gills.\n\nThe heart is two-chambered, contains one auricle and one ventricle.\n\nThey contain a brain and a spinal cord, which is protected by vertebrae.\n\nSense organs are well developed. They have the ability to detect their prey electrically. Sharks contain electroreceptors on their head, which can sense the electric current generated by the movement of their prey. It also helps them in navigation.\n\nIt also has sensory cells in the lateral line organ, which detect all the kinds of vibration, motion, water pressure surrounding them.\n\nSome of them possess electric organs or poison sting, which are used for defence as well as predation.\n\nThe digestive system comprises a mouth, pharynx, stomach, intestine (straight) and cloaca present on the ventral side. Cloaca has a dual function in females and also acts as a reproductive organ apart from excretion.\n\nMale and females are separate and have internal fertilization. Skates and some sharks are oviparous, most of the sharks are ovoviviparous and a few are viviparous.\n\nAdult males bear claspers on their pelvic fins. These are used to transfer sperms to the cloaca of a female.\n\nChondrichthyes Examples\n\nSome of the prominent examples of cartilaginous fishes are:\n\nSharks\n\nScoliodon (Dogfish)\n\nRhincodon (Whale shark)\n\nCharcarodon charcharias (The great white shark)\n\nRays\n\nTrygon (Stingray)\n\nTorpedo (Electric ray)\n\nNarcine bancroftii (Lesser electric ray)\n\nManta (Manta ray)\n\nSkates\n\nLeucoraja erinacea (Little skate)\n\nCruriraja andamanica (Andaman leg skate)\n\nGurgesiella (Small deepwater skate)\n\nSawfishes\n\nPristis clavata (Dwarf sawfish)\n\nAnoxypristis cuspidata (Narrow sawfish)\n\nChimaeras\n\nHydrolagus alphus (Whitespot ghost shark)\n\nCallorhinchus milii (Australian ghost shark)\n\nChimaera argiloba (Whitefin chimaera)\n\nThis was all about Chondrichthyes.
