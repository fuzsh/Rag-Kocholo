        "text": "Ray-finned fish, also known as actinopterygians, belong to the class Actinopterygii and represent the majority of the bony fish population, the other being lobe-finned fish or sarcopterygians. Notably, ray-finned fish account for nearly half of all living vertebrate species and constitute the bulk of fish populations worldwide.\n\nThey get their name from the Ancient Greek words actino-, meaning ‘having rays,’ and ptérux, which means ‘wings’ or ‘fins’ for being lightweight and having flexible fins, formed from skin webbed over radially extended spines (lepidotrichia) from their skeletons. This structure allows them to change shape and provide better thrust than those with fleshier fins, leading to their extensive diversity and population worldwide.\n\nPresently, 42 orders, 431 families, and approximately 27,000 species are recognized within this class. Teleosts (infraclass Teleostei) are the largest family of ray-finned fish, with nearly 26,000 members (approximately 93%) of the total fish population.\n\nDescription\n\nSize\n\nRay-finned fish vary widely in shape and size. The largest ray-finned fish ever discovered is the now-extinct genus Leedsichthys of pachycormid fish, which measured 54 ft (16.5 m). Among the existing types, the Ocean Sunfish is the most massive, weighing nearly 5,000 lbs (2,300 kg), while the Giant Oarfish is the longest, with an average length of 36 ft (11 m).\n\nThe smallest is a member of the carp family, Paedocypris, with females typically measuring 0.3 in (7.9 mm) in length.\n\nBody Plan\n\nThese bony fishes are distinguished from other groups by a single dorsal fin, ganoid or leptoid scales that grow lifelong, and a swim bladder. Additionally, they have well-ossified skeletons and jaw bones that can unhinge and expand.\n\nSwim Bladder\n\nThe swim bladder is a highly specialized organ that evolved from the primitive lung systems of early armored fish, like placoderms. It has a smooth, gas-impervious wall that requires air transfer into the chamber via a network of capillaries called the rete mirabile. By adjusting the air level inside the sac to match the water pressure above them, these ray-finned fish can float without moving their limbs.\n\nThough the most developed bladders in modern teleosts are completely internal and separate from the respiratory system, some species, such as gars and arapaima, use them for breathing, similar to the lungs in land-dwellers.\n\nFins\n\nThe paired fins of fish consist of a fan-like arrangement of thin spines called fin rays, which are supported at their bases by parallel bony structures known as radials.\n\nThe swim bladder enhances buoyancy, allowing the pelvic fins to be positioned just behind the pectoral fins rather than further back, which improves the fish’s agility.\n\nScales\n\nThese vertebrates were once covered with rigid ganoid scales (rhomboidal in shape) consisting of layers of spongy bone, dentine, and ganoine (a substance originating from enamel). However, teleosts have only leptoid scales, which are thinner and more flexible, allowing greater maneuverability and faster movement. These circular scales lack the tough enamel and dentine layers of other fishes.\n\nMany teleosts and all the surviving chondrosteans (paddlefishes and sturgeons) have now completely shed their scales.\n\nBranchiostegal Rays\n\nThe branchiostegal rays are long, curved bones emerging from the branchial cavity. Along with the operculum (a bony covering), they form a protective structure over the gills. They allow the mouth cavity to expand, increasing the water capacity and improving circulation. Also, they enable ray-finned fishes to use suction while catching prey.\n\nTail\n\nAlthough their ancestors had an asymmetric, heterocercal tail with fleshy flaps extending along the axis, most modern species have a homocercal tail (symmetric lobes and a flexible basal joint), which provides buoyancy, uniform thrust, and precise movement.\n\nJaws\n\nThe neopterygians (subclass Neopterygii) possess a freely hanging maxilla (upper jaw), which generates suction to capture food by expanding the protruding oral cavity. The teleosts show further modifications, such as loose skin flaps along the maxilla and a fully circular mouth to improve suction capabilities.\n\nEyes\n\nLike vertebrates, the eyes of ray-finned fish are adapted to detect a wide range of wavelengths, depending on the depth at which they live. Apart from the normal light spectrum, many shallow-water species can perceive ultraviolet light, while others, like salmon and cichlids, can even detect polarized light.\n\nThose living in deep sea or low-light environments have specially evolved long, tube-like eyes to provide better depth perception and improved binocular vision.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe current taxonomy is based on the first Phylogenetic Classification of Bony Fishes by R. Betancur-Rodriguez et al., published in 2013 and updated in 2017 by incorporating the most recent phylogenetic results.\n\nActinopterygii is currently classified under Cladistia and Actinopteri. Within these two main groups, several orders, like Guildayichthyiformes, Elonichthyiformes, and Saurichthyiformes, are now extinct. Actinopteri is further split into Chondrostei and Neopterygii, with the latter containing the most number of species within the greatly diversified infraclasses, Holostei and Teleostei.\n\nWhile the group Chondrostei was initially divided into two orders, the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs), the latter has been newly classified under Cladistia.\n\nClass: Cladistia\n\nOrder: Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish)\n\nClass: Actinopteri\n\nSubclass: Chondrostei\n\nOrder: Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes)\n\nSubclass: Neopterygii\n\nInfraclass: Holostei\n\nOrder: Amiiformes (bowfins)\n\nOrder: Lepisosteiformes (gars)\n\nInfraclass: Teleostei\n\nMegacohort: Elopocephalai\n\nOrder: Elopiformes (tarpon and ladyfishes)\n\nOrder: Albuliformes (bonefishes)\n\nOrder: Notacanthiformes (spiny eels and halosaurs)\n\nOrder: Anguilliformes (true eels)\n\nMegacohort: Osteoglossocephalai\n\nSupercohort: Osteoglossocephala\n\nOrder: Hiodontiformes (goldeye and mooneye)\n\nOrder: Osteoglossiformes (bony-tongued fishes)\n\nSupercohort: Clupeocephala\n\nSubcohort: Clupei\n\nOrder: Clupeiformes (anchovies and herrings)\n\nSubcohort: Alepocephali\n\nOrder: Alepocephaliformes\n\nSubcohort: Ostariophysi\n\nOrder: Gonorynchiformes (milkfishes)\n\nOrder: Cypriniformes (loaches, carp, barbs, minnows, goldfishes, rasboras, danios)\n\nOrder: Characiformes (piranhas, hatchetfishes, tetras, pencil fishes, characins, pacu, and dorado/golden)\n\nOrder: Gymnotiformes (electric eels and knifefishes)\n\nOrder: Siluriformes (catfishes)\n\nSubcohort: Lepidogalaxii\n\nOrder: Lepidogalaxiiformes (salamanderfish)\n\nSubcohort: Protacanthopterygii\n\nOrder: Argentiniformes (slickheads and barreleyes)\n\nOrder: Galaxiiformes\n\nOrder: Salmoniformes (salmon and trout)\n\nOrder: Esociformes (pike)\n\nSubcohort: Stomiati\n\nOrder: Osmeriformes (smelts)\n\nOrder: Stomiatiformes (marine hatchetfishes and bristlemouths)\n\nSubcohort: Neoteleostei\n\nOrder: Ateleopodiformes (jellynose fish)\n\nOrder: Aulopiformes (Bombay duck and lancetfishes)\n\nOrder: Myctophiformes (lanternfishes)\n\nOrder: Lampriformes (ribbonfish, oarfish, and opah)\n\nOrder: Percopsiformes (cavefishes and trout-perches)\n\nOrder: Zeiformes (dories)\n\nOrder: Stylephoriformes (tube-eye or thread-tail)\n\nOrder: Gadiformes (cods)\n\nOrder: Polymixiiformes (beardfishes)\n\nOrder: Beryciformes (pinecone fishes and fangtooths)\n\nOrder: Holocentriformes (soldierfishes)\n\nOrder: Ophidiiformes (pearlfishes)\n\nOrder: Batrachoidiformes (toadfishes)\n\nOrder: Kurtiformes (cardinalfishes and nurseryfishes)\n\nOrder: Gobiiformes (gobies and sleepers)\n\nOrder: Syngnathiformes (seahorses, sea moths, pipefishes, cornetfishes and flying gurnards)\n\nOrder: Scombriformes (mackerels and tuna)\n\nOrder: Synbranchiformes (swamp eels)\n\nOrder: Anabantiformes (snakeheads and gouramies)\n\nOrder: Istiophoriformes (swordfishes, marlins, and billfishes)\n\nOrder: Carangiformes (Jack mackerels and pompanos)\n\nOrder: Pleuronectiformes (flatfish)\n\nOrder: Cichliformes (cichlids, leaf fishes, and convict blenny)\n\nOrder: Atheriniformes (rainbowfishes and silversides)\n\nOrder: Cyprinodontiformes (killifishes, livebearers)\n\nOrder: Beloniformes (ricefishes and flying fishes)\n\nOrder: Mugiliformes (mullets)\n\nOrder: Blenniiformes (blennies)\n\nOrder: Gobiesociformes (clingfishes)\n\nOrder: Gerreiformes (mojarras)\n\nOrder: Labriformes (parrotfishes and wrasses)\n\nOrder: Caproiformes (boarfishes)\n\nOrder: Lophiiformes (anglerfishes)\n\nOrder: Tetraodontiformes (pufferfish and filefishes)\n\nOrder: Centrarchiformes (sunfishes and mandarin fishes)\n\nOrder: Gasterosteiformes (sticklebacks and relatives)\n\nOrder: Scorpaeniformes (Lionfishes and relatives)\n\nOrder: Perciformes (perch, darters, groupers, and sea bass)\n\nEvolution and Fossil Records\n\nThe Andreolepis hedei is the oldest discovered ray-finned fossil, dating back to the late Silurian Period (around 420 million years ago).\n\nThese vertebrates evolved further in the Devonian Period (420 to 358 million years ago), with crown-group Actinopterygians appearing around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (358 million years ago). They were the most widespread aquatic vertebrates by the late Paleozoic Era (around 252 million years ago).\n\nDuring the Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago), members of the order Palaeonisciformes (or Palaeoniscoids) became the most successful, having diverse shapes and sizes with primitive, ganoine-covered scales. Their closest living relatives are sturgeons, bichirs, and paddlefish.\n\nThe neopterygians emerged during the Permian Period (299 to 252 million years ago). These swifter, more agile fish quickly became the dominant subclass, encompassing the largest number of species. Their scales and skeletons became light in weight, and they could quickly dodge their predators.\n\nThe early Mesozoic saw the emergence of a diverse set of holosteans (a group within the neopterygians) capable of living in various habitats, unlike their exclusively freshwater-dwelling modern relatives.\n\nDuring the Late Triassic, the Prohalecites emerged, the early relatives of modern teleosts. However, researchers believe teleosts could have originated as early as the Paleozoic.\n\nAround 320 and 180 million years ago, whole genome duplication (WGD) occurred for teleosts and chondrosteans, respectively, leading to a diverse range of species. Holosteans and bichirs did not undergo this process, retaining most of their original genes.\n\nBy the Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago), they had established themselves as the most successful group of aquatic vertebrates.\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n\nDue to their extensive variety, ray-finned fishes inhabit nearly every aquatic zone. While most families (angelfish, carp, and anchovies) appear worldwide in fresh or saltwater, a few are specific to certain regions. Some, like cod, haddocks, sturgeons, and paddlefish, are exclusive to the Northern Hemisphere, while others, like salmon and trout, occur in both hemispheres but typically in temperate waters. Bowfins and gars are native to North and South America, whereas bichirs and reedfish live in the freshwaters of Africa.\n\nA significant number of species (41%) live in freshwater, with Southeast Asia being the most densely populated. Families like carp, pikes, catfishes, and piranhas prefer mostly rivers and lakes, while eels, herrings, and seahorses are marine inhabitants living in coral reefs. Several groups, such as guppies, cods, and anglerfish, can survive both in salty and freshwater, while gars exclusively occupy brackish waters.\n\nDiet\n\nRay-finned fish can be herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, zooplanktivores, or detritivores. They are generally opportunistic feeders, feeding on anything they encounter.\n\nCarnivores like barracuda, tuna, and flounders primarily feed on other smaller fish, while others like sturgeons eat mollusks, crustaceans, and insects from the sea floor. In contrast, needlefish hunt both fish and insects.\n\nHerbivores like parrotfish, surgeonfish, and blennies eat algae and reef plants.\n\nZooplanktivores mostly eat zooplankton, which consists of small, floating crustaceans like copepods and water fleas.\n\nDetritivores are typically bottom-feeders who feed on detritus (decaying organic matter, including feces.)\n\nReproduction and Life Cycle\n\nTypically, ray-finned fish have two distinct sexes, male and female, with the latter spawning eggs and the former fertilizing them. Mating usually happens in four ways: monogamy, polygyny, polyandry, and polygynandry.\n\nMonogamy, the practice of maintaining a single partner for multiple seasons, is typical among hawkfishes and blennies. Some, like sea basses and darters, show polygyny, with the males having several partners, while anemonefishes display polyandry, the females mating with various males. Herrings and wrasses prefer polygynandry (or promiscuity), where both sexes mate with different partners throughout the breeding season.\n\nHowever, some forms of alternative mating, like synchronous or sequential hermaphroditism, exist in various circumstances.\n\nSynchronous (or simultaneous) hermaphrodites like black hamlets contain ovarian and testicular tissue inside their bodies and can exhibit whichever trait is most advantageous.\n\nSequential hermaphroditism is the sex change of an individual at some point in their life. Protogyny, commonly seen in wrasses, parrotfish, and groupers, is the most popular type, in which fish begin life as females and later convert to males. Some, like moray eels and clownfish, prefer the reverse, starting as males and then transforming into females, a process called protandry. Either external or internal factors can trigger these sex changes.\n\nFertilization\n\nMost ray-finned fish undergo external fertilization to produce offspring. Some, like the mangrove rivulus, can self-fertilize, producing both sperm and eggs internally. However, this often causes inbreeding. To avoid this unwanted situation, some individuals develop into males at temperatures below 66°F (19°C) and fertilize the eggs. In mouthbrooding fish like cichlids, the eggs undergo insemination within the female’s mouth.\n\nDevelopment\n\nAround 21% of the species are either viviparous (give birth to live young) or ovoviviparous (eggs hatch inside the mother’s body), where males show greater parental care than females. Conversely, 79% of egg-laying or oviparous teleosts do not participate in child-rearing.\n\nWhile most temperate fish eggs hatch between 3 to 20 days after laying, those of most coral reef species hatch within just a day.\n\nUnlike other vertebrates, these fish undergo a larval stage and have indeterminate growth (they keep growing throughout their lives). These transparent, free-swimming larvae are quick and responsive, and by the time they attain maturity, they can easily navigate predator-infested waters.\n\nLifespan\n\nSmaller ray-finned fishes generally live shorter lives, with many surviving in the wild for less than a year. However, some varieties have much longer lifespans than predicted, living for decades in captivity. For example, largemouth bass and European perch can survive for 24 to 25 years, while some sturgeons and rockfish can live between 80 to 150 years.\n\nBehavior\n\nMany ray-finned fish, like parrotfish and wrasses, are active during the day for foraging (diurnal). However, some, like tarpon and groupers, feed at dusk (crepuscular), while groups like ponyfishes and cardinalfishes prefer the nighttime (nocturnal).\n\nMigration\n\nMost species exhibit migratory traits. They go on short, daily trips to feed and avoid predators, while long ones are generally reserved for reproductive activities. Others may spend their entire lives in either marine (oceanodromous) or freshwater regions (potamodromous).\n\nThose that migrate between fresh and salty water are called diadromous. Some, like salmon, grow in saltwater and travel to freshwater to spawn (anadromous), while others, including anguillid eels, do the reverse and spawn in salty water (catadromous). Conversely, others, like gobies, move between different salinities for feeding (amphidromous).\n\nThese fish use visual and olfactory clues and factors like ocean currents, temperature, salinity, and the earth’s magnetic field to find their way back after completing extensive journeys. They can easily find locations with accuracy using their remarkable memory.\n\nSchooling\n\nSometimes, these fish can form aggregates or shoals for various purposes, such as feeding, breeding, or seeking protection. Extremely large groups become schools and can contain millions of individuals. They move as one entity, often contorting into random shapes in search of food or avoiding danger.\n\nCommunication\n\nRay-finned fish primarily communicate through vision, mechanoreception (spatial awareness, touch, balance, and hearing), electroreception, and chemoreception (smell and taste).\n\nThey exhibit various body shapes, coloring, and even luminescence to identify each other. In some varieties, juveniles change shape and patterns as they mature, while in others, adults display sexual dimorphism (sexes have different colors).\n\nThese fish commonly use sound to defend territory (damselfishes), detect prey (herrings and cods), or mate (haddocks). They usually do this by stridulation, which involves grinding their teeth, rubbing their fins, or vibrating their muscles. Groups like toadfishes and flying gurnards use the swim bladder to make more complex sounds.\n\nThey can synchronize themselves in enormous schools, using the ability to sense vibrations and fluctuations in water pressure. A long canal (lateral line) composed of sensory cells spans the length of the body and helps them maintain such coordination.\n\nMany groups, like stargazers and elephantfishes, locate hidden prey and navigate deep waters by detecting electrical impulses from different organs using specialized structures.\n\nSalmon and cyprinids utilize nares (nostril-like openings on top of the head) to detect pheromones, which help them identify suitable habitats, members of the same or different species, mating partners, and predators or prey.\n\nFeeding and Digestion\n\nApart from the basic modes of nutrition, many fish are opportunistic feeders and can switch between the modes based on food availability.\n\nCarnivores hunt by various methods depending on the nature of their prey. Fast-start predators (gars and barracudas) with long, slender, and slightly camouflaged bodies lurk motionless and lunge quickly at their food. Ram feeders (billfishes and tuna) have round and incredibly tapered bodies, allowing them to chase at high speeds over vast distances. In contrast, sit-in-wait predators (flatheads and stonefishes) camouflage and bury themselves in wait for unsuspecting prey, using suction to pull them in.\n\nSome hunters, like electric eels and knifefish, can deliver intensely powerful shocks to incapacitate and even kill smaller creatures.\n\nHerbivores use specialized structures, such as pharyngeal mills, extended guts, and gizzards, to break down hard-to-digest plant matter.\n\nZooplanktivores gather in swarms of millions in the open ocean, using their characteristic circular, protruding mouths, forked tails, and streamlined bodies to feed.\n\nEusociality\n\nMany groups, such as catfish, cod, wrasses, and minnows, maintain dominance hierarchies determined by age, size, sex, previous experience, and residency. Typically, males are dominant over females, having access to better feeding grounds, habitats, and ocean currents.\n\nTerritoriality is another form of aggressive behavior in various groups, such as barracuda, freshwater eels, surgeonfishes, and cichlids. Their interactions involve vocalizations, displays, chasing, and biting that occur at territorial boundaries.\n\nDefense\n\nGroups like gobies and bluegills, which are relatively small, aggregate in shoals and synchronize their movements to appear as one giant individual, making it difficult for hunters to separate them. They also hide in bigger coral reefs and burrow into the sand to stay safe.\n\nSome species, like flatfishes and cardinalfishes, mimic their surroundings using skin growths and color patterns, while others, like batfishes, imitate toxic nudibranchs and flatworms, thus fooling predators into leaving them alone.\n\nSpecies like herrings and snappers employ countershading (darker on top and lighter at the bottom) to camouflage themselves. They use natural coloring or luminescent organs to create a false light source. In contrast, anchovies and minnows have shiny scales (mirror-sided), while glassfishes are transparent, which makes them hard to spot.\n\nLastly, some species, like lionfishes and surgeonfishes, are aposematic. They have poisonous body structures and employ bright coloration and aggressive behavior as a warning.\n\nAdaptations\n\nSmall, bony structures inside the inner ear, called otoliths, provide balance and detect sound vibrations in the water.\n\nThese fish have segmented muscle blocks, called myotomes, which contract and expand to assist in their wave-like swimming motion.\n\nTaste buds scattered around the lips, mouth, and gills, along with a sharp sense of smell, help these vertebrates locate food underwater. Some species, like catfish and cod, use whisker-like organs near the mouth (barbels) for taste perception.\n\nCatfishes and knifefishes are the only neopterygians that possess ampullae of Lorenzi, which are mucus-filled pores responsible for electroreception.\n\nSome groups, like lanternfishes, have tiny rows of luminous glands or light-producing symbiotic bacteria cultures along their eye sockets to enhance visibility, communicate with each other, and attract prey.\n\nInteresting Facts"
