        "text": "Osteichthyes is a class of jawed fishes having a bony endoskeleton. It is the largest class of vertebrates and includes a diverse group of marine and freshwater bony fishes.\n\nDownload Complete Chapter Notes of Animal Kingdom\n\nDownload Now\n\nThe other group of jawed fishes are cartilaginous fishes, which are included in the class Chondrichthyes.\n\nOsteichthyes Classification\n\nOsteichthyes is a class of fishes included in the division Gnathostomata, which includes all the vertebrates having jaws. Jawless fishes are included in the division Agnatha and the class Cyclostomata.\n\nGnathostomata is divided into two superclasses, viz. Pisces (having fins) and Tetrapoda (bear limbs).\n\nPisces is divided into two classes:\n\nOsteichthyes- Bony fishes\n\nChondrichthyes- Cartilaginous fishes\n\nOsteichthyes is subdivided into two subclasses:\n\nSarcopterygii- lobe-finned fish\n\nActinopterygii- ray-finned fish\n\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Subphylum Vertebrata Division Gnathostomata Superclass Pisces Class Osteichthyes\n\nOsteichthyes characteristics\n\nWith more than 29,000 species of bony fishes, it is the largest class of vertebrates.\n\nIt includes both marine and freshwater fishes, most of the commercially used fishes are included in this class.\n\nThe size ranges from less than 8 mm in Paedocypris progenetica, which is also the smallest known vertebrate to 4 m and weigh about 1500 kg in the ocean sunfish (Mola mola).\n\nTheir endoskeleton is made up of bones.\n\nPaired and median fins are present, which are supported by long rays of cartilage or bone. Fleshy lobed fins are present in sarcopterygians. These types of fins are supported by bones having joints. These are adapted to live at the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe tail is mostly homocercal.\n\nThey contain a swim bladder or air bladder, which provides buoyancy to them and prevents sinking. The swim bladder also facilitates gaseous exchange.\n\nThe mouth is terminal.\n\nBony fishes contain four pairs of gills. A protective covering of a bony flap known as the operculum protects the gills.\n\nThe sarcopterygians, lungfishes and lobe-finned fishes contain lungs.\n\nThe skin is covered by bony dermal scales known as ganoid, cycloid or ctenoid scales.\n\nThey are poikilotherms or cold-blooded animals and lack the capacity to regulate their internal body temperature. Some of the larger marine fishes like tuna, swordfish, etc. show some level of endothermy.\n\nThe heart is two-chambered, contains one auricle and one ventricle. Lungfishes have a three-chambered heart with two auricles and one ventricle.\n\nThe brain has a small olfactory lobe and cerebellum. There are ten pairs of cranial nerves present.\n\nThe lateral line organ contains hydrodynamic receptors. The sensory unit is called neuromasts. It helps in sensing vibration, water pressure, navigation and locating their prey.\n\nCloaca is absent, different genital and anal openings are present.\n\nThey are ammonotelic and have mesonephric kidneys.\n\nSexes are mostly separate but some are hermaphrodites. They are mostly oviparous and lay a huge amount of eggs. Fertilisation is mostly external and direct development.\n\nIn the male Hippocampus, the brood pouch is present, where eggs incubate.\n\nOsteichthyes Examples\n\nSome of the prominent examples of bony fishes are:\n\nRay-finned fishes\n\nMarine bony fishes\n\nHippocampus (Sea horse)\n\nExocetus (Flying fish)\n\nLophius (Angler fish)\n\nFreshwater bony fishes\n\nLabeo rohita (Rohu)\n\nLabeo catla (Katla)\n\nClarias (Walking catfish or Magur)\n\nMystus (Catfish)\n\nAquarium bony fishes\n\nBetta splendens (Fighting fish)\n\nPterophyllum (Angelfish)\n\nLobe-finned fishes\n\nLungfishes\n\nLepidosiren\n\nNeoceratodus\n\nProtopterus\n\nCoelocanth Latimeria is a living fossil and the oldest known lineage of Sarcopterygii.\n\nThis was all about Osteichthyes.
