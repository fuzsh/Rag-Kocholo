        "text": "Ray finned fishes\n\nTemporal range: Silurian–Recent A coelacanth is a common example of an actinopterygid Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Superclass: Osteichthyes Class: Actinopterygii\n\nActinop, 1817 Subclasses\n\nChondrostei\n\nNeopterygii\n\nCladistia\n\n†Palaeonisciformes\n\n†Tarrasiformes\n\n†Ptycholepiformes\n\nActinopterygii (meaning 'Actinop's teryg), or the ray-finned fishes, constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes.[1]\n\nThe ray-finned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines (\"rays\"), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish). These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles).\n\nNumerically, actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates, comprising nearly 99% of the over 30,000 species of fish.[2] They are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Extant species can range in size from Paedocypris, at 8 millimeters, to the massive ocean sunfish, at 2300 kg, and the long-bodied oarfish, at 11 meters.\n\nCharacteristics[]\n\nRay-finned fishes occur in many variant forms. The main features of a typical ray-finned fish are shown in the diagram at the left.\n\nReproduction[]\n\nIn nearly all ray-finned fish, the sexes are separate, and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid. Development then proceeds with a free-swimming larval stage.[3] However other patterns of ontogeny exist, with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism. In most cases this involves protogyny, fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage, triggered by some internal or external factor. This may be advantageous as females become less prolific as they age while male fecundity increases with age. Protandry, where a fish converts from male to female, is much less common than protogyny.[4] Most families use external rather than internal fertilization.[5] Of the oviparous teleosts, most (79%) do not provide parental care.[6] Viviparity, ovoviviparity, or some form of parental care for eggs, whether by the male, the female, or both parents is seen in a significant fraction (21%) of the 422 teleost families; no care is likely the ancestral condition.[6] Viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6% of teleost species; male care is far more common than female care.[6][7] Male territoriality \"preadapts\" a species for evolving male parental care.[8][9]\n\nThere are a few examples of fish that self-fertilise. The mangrove rivulus is an amphibious, simultaneous hermaphrodite, producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation. This mode of reproduction may be related to the fish's habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits. Males are occasionally produced at temperatures below 19 °C (66 °F) and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female. This maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred.[10]\n\nFossil record[]\n\nThe earliest known fossil actinopterygiian is Andreolepis hedei, dating back 420 million years (Late Silurian). Remains have been found in Russia, Sweden, and Estonia.[11]\n\nClassification[]\n\nActinopterygians are divided into the subclasses Chondrostei and Neopterygii. The Neopterygii, in turn, are divided into the infraclasses Holostei and Teleostei. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely, and as a result, 96% of all known fish species are teleosts. The cladogram shows the major groups of actinopterygians and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) that evolved from a related group of fish.[12][13][14] Approximate dates are from Near et al., 2012.[12]\n\nOsteichthyes\n\nSarcopterygii\n\nCoelacanths, Lungfish\n\nTetrapods\n\nAmphibians\n\nAmniota\n\nMammals\n\nSauropsids (reptiles, birds) File:Zoology of Egypt (1898) (Varanus griseus).png\n\nActinopterygii 400 mya\n\nCladistia\n\nPolypteriformes (bichirs, reedfishes) File:Cuvier-105-Polyptère.jpg\n\nActinopteri\n\nChondrostei\n\nAcipenseriformes (sturgeons, paddlefishes)\n\nNeopterygii 360 mya\n\nHolostei 275 mya\n\nLepisosteiformes (gars)\n\nAmiiformes (bowfins)\n\nTeleostei 310 mya File:Cyprinus carpio3.jpg\n\nThe polypterids (bichirs and ropefish) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians, The Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) are the sister lineage of Neopterygii, and Holostei (bowfin and gars) are the sister lineage of teleosts. The Elopomorpha (eels and tarpons) appears to be the most basic teleosts.[12]\n\nChondrostei Chondrostei (cartilage bone) are primarily cartilaginous fish showing some ossification. There are 52 species divided among two orders, the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs). It is thought that the chondrosteans evolved from bony fish but lost the bony hardening of their cartilaginous skeletons, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton, suggesting that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish.[15] This group has at times been classified with the sharks: the similarities are obvious, as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish, and both lack scales (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest.[15] Chondrostei is paraphyletic meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor; reclassification of the Chondrostei is therefore not out of the question. Neopterygii Neopterygii (new fins) appeared somewhere in the Late Permian, before the time of the dinosaurs. There are only few changes during their evolution from the earlier actinopterygians. They are a very successful group of fishes, because they can move more rapidly than their ancestors. Their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution, and their jaws became more powerful and efficient. While electroreception and the ampullae of Lorenzini is present in all other groups of fish, with the exception of hagfish, Neopterygii has lost this sense, though it later re-evolved within Gymnotiformes and catfishes, who possess nonhomologous teleost ampullae.\n\nThe listing below follows Phylogenetic Classification of Bony Fishes"
