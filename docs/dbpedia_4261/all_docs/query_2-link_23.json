        "text": "The misunderstanding here is the difference between phylogenetic classification and character evolution. Essentially, just because an organism has one certain trait it doesn't automatically belong to some group.\n\nWords like paraphyletic, monophyletic, and clade, are descriptions of groupings by ancestor-descendant relationships. Clade and monophyletic, for example, refer to an ancestor and all of its descendants. Paraphyletic generally refers to an ancestor and most of its descendants, but excluding some portion. Talking about \"bony fish\" but excluding tetrapods would make bony fish a paraphyletic group.\n\nCharacter evolution is the study of how characters have evolved among a group of organisms in light of their phylogenetic relationships. Textbooks often talk about clades having synapomorphies, or characters that have evolved in some ancestor and are present in its descendants. Some clades have clear synapomorphies that do indeed strongly match a clade (e.g. all the members of the clade have the character, and other organisms do not). However, it's not uncommon for synapomorphies to only be mostly true. Perhaps some members of the clade lost the new trait, or some species outside the clade independently evolved the same trait. These exceptions, however, don't change the group membership of those organism.\n\nIt's not the character that defines a species' clade, but the ancestor-descendant relationships. It's not exactly true that Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii are \"classified by the shape of their fins.\" It's just that fin shape is a really good synapomorphy for those clades because it's both consistent and probably has important evolutionary consequences. Because of this people adopted the common names ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes, giving the implication that that's what defines those groups.\n\nThe misconception is understandable because we use characters (previously morphological characters, recently increasingly genomic characters) to craft our hypotheses about what we think are the true ancestor-descendant relationships.\n\nAll that is to say that the most recent common ancestor of Osteichthyes is just that—it is an ancestor of both Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, but doesn't belong to either clade, regardless of its fin morphology. Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii share that common ancestor to the exclusion of other groups, which makes them sister clades."
