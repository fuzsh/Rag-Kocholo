In advanced bony fishes this connection is lost and the swim bladder is separate from esophagus. They have a very specialized gland called the rete mirabilis which is able to keep the pressure in the swimbladder stabiliz\n\n13 Class Actinopterygii characteristics\n\nTwo types of migration seen in fishes Anadromous- migrating from salt water to freshwater to reproduce; spend adult life in sea ex. salmon (born in freshwater then migrate to sea when reach adulthood migrate back to spawning grounds) Catadromous - migrating from freshwater to salt water to reproduce; spend adult life in freshwater ex. eels (born in Sargassum Sea migrate to rivers in\n\n14 Anadromous migration e.g. salmon\n\n15 Anadromous migration e.g. salmon\n\n16 Catadromous migration e.g. freshwater eel\n\n17 Feeding in Fishes Carnivorous - prey on large variety of animals\n\nHerbivorous - eat plants Omnivorous - eat both plants and animals Filter Feeders - able to filter water of plankton and detritus Scavengers - feed on decaying plants and animals All the above have to do with mouth morphology"
