        "text": "The only fully articulated I have ever seen a picture of\n\nPolypterus faraou\n\nA new species of Polypterus has been found inside a lump of rock.\n\nThe fish, which is a member of the Cladistia's Polypteridae family, is the first complete fossil polypterid skeleton ever described.\n\nThe extinct species has been named Polypterus faraou in a paper in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society and was found in an area known as Toros-Menalla in western Djourab, Chad.\n\n\"The articulated skeleton is preserved in three dimensions...\" The articulated skeleton is preserved in three dimensions and has allowed the scientists who discovered it to determine, fairly accurately, where it lies in the fossil record.\n\nThe authors believe the species comes from the Late Miocene(5.3myo) and they claim it's the only verifiable record for the genus Polypterus.\n\nThe species is said to closely resemble Polypterus bichir and P. endlicheri, which still live in the Chad and Chari river systems today.\n\nThey don't know exactly how this and other polypterids are interrelated, but they believe that Polypterus faraou has a primitive body shape and a primitive \"shape of opening of the lateral line on the scales\" which is also seen in P. bichir, P. ansorgii and P. endlicheri.\n\nFor more details see the paper: Otero O, A Likius, P Vignaud and M Brunet, 2006. A new polypterid fish: Polypterus faraou sp. nov. (Cladistia, Polypteridae) from the Late Miocene, Toros-Menalla, Chad. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 146: 227?237.\n\nThe Polypteriformes are a small group of African fresh-water fish comprising\n\n13 species grouped into two genera,Polypterus and E.calabaricus.Although most\n\npaleontologists and zoologists agree that Polypteriformes belong to the group of\n\nosteichthian or bony fish,there exist three divergent views regarding their exact\n\nposition within this broad taxonomic entity: Several observers\n\nhave placed Polypteriformes into a distinct subclass,the Brachiopterygii, whose\n\nphylogenetic origin is not well defined In contrast,numerous investigators\n\nhave regarded Polypteriformes as belonging to the subclass\n\nActinopterygii.In the latter context two phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed.\n\nThe first is that the Polypteriformes most probably separated from the actinopterygian\n\nmain stem very early (as far back as the late paleozoic ) and independently\n\napproached the holostean level. The second hypothesis states that the Polypteri-\n\nformes are primitive actinopterygian fish and represent a living relic of the Paleonis-\n\ncoidei,the extinct ancestors of the entire actinopterygian stock.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe science of taxonomy,is concerned with discovering and describing the enormous diversity of living organisms is an ever-\n\nchanging field.As research sheds light on species and their relationships,taxonomic categories ideally reflect thier diverging paths taken by evolution-responds with name changes and the reassembly of families,orders,classes,phyla,kingdomsand domains.\n\nAmong aquarium organisms are examples of taxa undergoing extensive revisions and ongoing research.\n\ntaxonomic hierarchy\n\nA logical series of successively larger groups into which a species may be placed according to its supposed evolutionary\n\nrelationships with other species.\n\nPolypterids are classified as follows\n\nTaxonomic hierarchy\n\nKingdom Animalia -- Animal\n\nPhylum Chordata -- chordates\n\nSubphylum Vertebrata -- , vertebrates\n\nSuperclass Osteichthyes -- bony fishes\n\nClass Actinopterygii -- ray-finned fishes, spiny rayed fishes\n\nSubclass Chondrostei -- paddlefishes, sturgeons\n\nOrder Polypteriformes\n\nFamily Polypteridae -- bichirs,lobed-finned pike, reed fishes and dinosuar eels\n\nGenus Polypterus\n\nSpecies(example) Polypterus senegalus- gray bichir-Cuviers bichir\n\ndates listed are when the species were described\n\nCladistia Cope, 1871 after Lund, 2000<==o CLADISTIA Cope, 1871 sensu Lund, 2000\n\n|--o &#8224;GUILDAYICHTHYIFORMES Lund, 2000\n\n| `--o &#8224;Guildayichthyidae Lund, 2000\n\n| |-- &#8224;Guildayichthys carnegiei Lund, 2000\n\n| `-- &#8224;Discoserra pectinodon Lund, 2000\n\n`--o POLYPTERIFORMES [Brachiopterygii] (niilinhaukikalat)\n\n|?- &#8224;Dagetella sudamericana [Dajetella]\n\n`--o Polypteridae (niilinhauet; bichirs)\n\n|-- Calamoichthys calabaricus (Smith, 1865) [Erpetoichthys] (käärmehauki, käärmekala; Reedfish)\n\n`--o Polypterus (niilinhauet; bichirs) [9?]\n\n|-- P. ansorgii Boulenger, 1910 (Guinean bichir)\n\n|--o P. bichir Geoffroy St. Hilaire, 1802 (niilinhauki)\n\n| |-- P. b. bichir Geoffroy St. Hilaire, 1802 (Nile bichir)\n\n| |-- P. b. katangae Poll, 1941\n\n| `-- P. b. lapradei Steindachner, 1869\n\n|-- P. delhezi Boulenger, 1899 (Barred bichir)\n\n|--o P. endlicheri Heckel, 1846-49\n\n| |-- P. endlicheri congicus Boulenger, 1898\n\n| `-- P. endlicheri endlicheri Heckel, 1846-49 (Saddled bichir)\n\n|-- P. ornatipinnis Boulenger, 1902 (Ornate bichir)\n\n|--o P. palmas Ayres, 1850 (Shortfin bichir)\n\n| |-- P. palmas buettikoferi Steindachner, 1891\n\n| |-- P. palmas palmas Ayres, 1850 (Shortfin bichir)\n\n| `-- P. palmas polli Gosse, 1988\n\n|-- P. retropinnis Vaillant, 1899 (West African bichir)\n\n|--o P. senegalus Cuvier, 1829 (Gray bichir)\n\n| |-- P. senegalus meridionalis Poll, 1941\n\n| `-- P. senegalus senegalus Cuvier, 1829 (Gray bichir)\n\n`-- P. weeksii Boulenger, 1898 (Mottled bichir)\n\nReference(s):\n\nCarroll, R.

For many centuries, Egypt had been a mysterious country where foreigners (especially Christians) were not welcome. Therefore, antiquarians interested in Ancient Egypt merely had access to the few antiquities taken to Europe by the Romans or by contemporary merchants, and to the inaccurate reports written by Greek and Roman authors. It was Napoleon who really opened up Egypt for the West.\n\nNapoleon had found out that first-hand experience on Egypt&#8217;s past and present was practically lacking.In order to remedy this state of affairs, he decided to invite 167 scholars and artists to accompany the expedition.In 1798 Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire was chosen to be a member of Napoleon's great scientific expedition to Egypt.It was here along the banks of the Nile Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire discovered a in the Nile a one meter-long green fish with gar like scales and several finlets on its back and named it Polypterus(many fins).In 1802 the scientific name Polypterus bichir was given at a conference.it had already been known along the Nile since the time of the pharoahs. The local peoples referred to it as a bichir (unknown pronunciation and spelling). While unable to come up with an exact meaning for the word it was most likely a descriptive term (''whip'' has been suggested) for this type of fish.The French most likely pronounced it as phonetically as possible to the orginal native word and came up with bee-sheer as a pronunciation and spelled 'bichir'.In 1809, the year after his return to France, he was made professor of zoology at the faculty of sciences at Paris, and from that period he devoted himself more exclusively than before to anatomical study.\n\n\"If I had discovered only this species in Egypt, it would compensate me for the pains usually involved in a long journey\"\n\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1809, describing the genus Polypterus and its Nile species Polypterus bichir.*\n\n(English translation)\n\nSo who was Cuvier?\n\nBaron Georges Léopold Chrétien Frédéric Dagobert Cuvier (August 23, 1769&#8211;May 13, 1832) was a French naturalist and zoologist.Cuvier, after corresponding with the well-known naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, was appointed in 1795, at the age of 26, as assistant to the professor of comparative anatomy at the Muséum National.Cuvier's researches on fish, begun in 1801, finally culminated in the publication of the Histoire naturelle des poissons, which contained descriptions of 5000 species of fishes.\n\nIn 1794 Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire entered into correspondence with Georges Cuvier. Shortly after the appointment of Cuvier as assistant at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geoffroy received him into his house. The two friends wrote together five memoirs on natural history, one of which, on the classification of mammals, puts forward the idea of the subordination of characters upon which Cuvier based his zoological system.\n\nAnimals named after Cuvier\n\nThese include Cuvier's beaked whale, Cuvier's Gazelle, Cuvier's toucan, Cuvier's Bichir, and Galeocerdo cuvieri, the tiger shark.\n\nThere are also some extinct animals named after Cuvier, such as the South American giant sloth Catonyx cuvieri.\n\nLUNGS\n\nPaleontological evidence shows that air-breathing appeared some 438-408 million years ago during the late Silurian period (Sundstrom 2002).\n\nTwo main theories are trying to explain its evolution.\n\n1) Theory 1 more widely accepted one argues that warm tropical waters were suffering from either periodical or constant low concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Based on observations of modern species, an existing behavioral responce is fish moving to shallower, higher oxygen availabilty water and utilyzing aquatic surface respiration. Such pressure led to the evolution of specialized organs for breathing athmospheric air and retreaving its oxygen contents (Sundstrom 2002).\n\n2) The second theory suggests that fish started gulping air to increase their buoyancy; the result was again an air-breathing system (Sundstrom 2002).\n\nIn fact, evidence supports both hypothesis. Studies have shown that the air-breathing fish exhibit various structural, behavioral, physiological characteristics, and differ in ventilatory control and central/periferal receptor interactions. This suggests that air-breathing has evolved independently. Graham (1997) stipulates between 38 and 67 independent occurences of air-breathing.\n\nA study by Perry et al. (2001) on the origin of potentially homologous air-filled organs (lungs and swimbladders) also demonstrates the complexity of figuring out the evolution of air-breathing. The Polypteriformes, lungfish, and tetrapods are characterised by the existence of lungs; in all other bony fish the swimbladder is ancestral. Perry et al.(2001) defines lungs as \"paired ventral derivatives of the pharynx posterior to the gills.\" The unpaired swimbladder in gar fish (Ginglymodi), bowfin (Halecomporphi), and basal teleosts is dorsal and evolved from the posterior pharynx. The authors of \"Which came first, the lung or the breath?\" (Perry et al., 2001) demonstrate that extreme variation exists even though air ventilatory mechanisms in the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) and Polypteriformes are similar among different groups, and are markedly different from those of lungfish and tetrapods. Evidence exists that supports the theory that homologous pharyngeal air-filled organs first appeared in early bony fish, but resulted from behavioral mechanisms for surface (water) breathing. The posterior gill pouches or the gills served by the sixth branchial artery might have been the early air-filled organs. It could have later evolved into the respiratory swimbladder and the lungs.\n\nWilson et al. (2000) also looked into the difference between the lobe-finned (Sarcopterygii) and the ray-finned (Actinopterygii) fish, both of which have evolved primitive air breathers. The tetrapods, which stem from Sarcopterygii, utilise a chemoreceptor bound central pattern generator. It is subject to control from both central and peripheral CO2/H+ chemoreceptors. On the contrary, Actinopterygii are believed to lack such chemoreceptors and rely instead on \"reflexive\" behavior. However, using in vitro brainstem from longnose gar fish, Wilson et al. (2000) show that air-breathing patterns occur in brainstem and are subject to changing levels of carbon dioxide. The authors make a case that a central neuronal controller for air-breathing appeared in a common ancestor before the split of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish. This illustrates the difficulty of quantifying the number of independent evolutions of air-breathing suggested above by Graham (1997).Note how the lung on the right runs almost the lenght of the body.\n\npic from digimorph\n\nThe wall of the asymmetrical saclike lungs of the fishes Polypterus and Erpetoichthys consists of several functionally different tissue layers. Their lumen is lined by a surface epithelium composed of (1) highly attenuated cells, termed pneumocytes I; (2) pneumocytes II with lamellar bodies, presumably indicating surfactant production; (3) mucous cells; and (4) ciliated cells. Underlying the pneumocytes I is a dense capillary net. The thin continuous endothelium of this net, together with the pneumocytes I, constitute the very thin blood-air barrier. The basement membrane of epithelium and endothelium fuse in the area of the blood-air barrier (thickness 210 m). Secretory and ciliary cells form longitudinal rows in the epithelium. Below the zone with a gas-exchanging tissue, a layer of connective tissue containing collagen and special elastic fibers occurs. The blood vessels that give rise to or drain the superficial capillary plexus are located in this connective tissue. The outermost layer of the lung consists of muscle cells, a narrow inner zone with smooth muscle cells, and an outer, broader zone with cross-striated muscle cells. The lung is innervated by myelinated and nonmyelinated nerve fibers. The morphology of the gas-exchange tissue in the lungs of these primitive bony fish is fundamentally very similar to that of the lungs of tetrapod vertebrates. The morphologic observations are in close agreement with physiologic data, disclosing well-developed respiratory capacities. Structural simplicity can be regarded as a model from which the lungs of the higher vertebrates derived. In addition to respiratory function, the lungs seem also to have hydrostatic tasks.\n\nA.
