        "text": "The lobe-finned fish refer to all the members of the group Sarcopterygii with the exception of the tetrapods. As their name suggests, the fins of lobe-finned fish are supported by a central appendage composed of bones and muscles, potentially useful for supporting the body on land, as in modern lungfish. Most members of this group are extinct, but the few living species have adapted to different extreme conditions. The lungfishes of South America and Africa burrow into the mud when their ponds or pools dry up, and the coelacanths live at depths of 100-400 meters in the Indian Ocean.\n\nRay-finned fish (Actinopterygii) are the dominant aquatic vertebrates today. They illustrate great diversity in their morphology and habitats, living in shallow to deep and freshwater to marine habitats. Their name comes from the presence of “rays,” fine bony or horny spines that support the webbing of their fins. Trout, salmon, bass, and tuna are typical modern ray-finned fish."
