        "text": "Home âº Sea Life Creatures âº Marine Animals âº Vertebrates\n\nExamples of Marine Vertebrates\n\nThe \"backbone of the animal kingdom\" is a simple way to describe aquatic vertebrates - because all vertebrate sea animals have a spine (a column of bones) and a skeleton.\n\nThis section contains facts and information about the 81,000 living species within the subphylum Vertebrata, along with a comprehensive list of marine vertebrates examples.\n\nMarine Vertebrates that Live in the Oceans\n\nA marine vertebrate is any animal within the classification of \"Kingdom Animalia\" belonging to the sub phylum \"Vertebrata\".\n\nThe group includes more than 60,000 species of the \"Phylum Chordata\" (meaning animals with backbones).\n\nBut, living examples of marine vertebrates make up seven structurally complex superclass organisms (amphibians, reptiles, mammals, birds, bony fish, sharks, and rays).\n\nExtant aquatic vertebrates (e.g. still surviving) range in size from the 7.7 mm microhylid frog to the thirty three (33) metre blue whale.\n\nVertebrates account for approximately 5% of all classifications of animal species - the others make up the marine invertebrates list (without a backbone).\n\nAll vertebrates - marine life included - have an interior skeleton structure; sometimes as traditional bone; others as cartilage; and some with a mixture of both.\n\nWorld Register of Marine Species\n\nThe main aim of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is to provide us with an authoritative classification and catalogue of marine names. Their current data lists around 250,000 checked and accepted marine species.\n\nAccording to WoRMS, the classifications for marine vertebrates fall under the Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata, and Subphylum Vertebrata. There are four (4) main marine superclasses:\n\nAgnatha (jawless fishes)\n\nGnathostomata\n\nPisces (bony fishes)\n\nTetrapoda\n\nSuperclasses Agnatha and Pisces both represent a form of fish. Agnatha contains one hundred and five species of jawless fish (e.g. hagfish, lampreys).\n\nThe superclass Pisces contains more than 27,000 species of bony fishes. They include:\n\nClass Actinopterygii (20,000+ species of ray-finned fishes)\n\nClass Elasmobranchii (928 species of sharks, rays, and skates)\n\nClass Holocephali (928 species of chimaeras)\n\nClass Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes, such as coelacanths and lungfishes)\n\nOther important marine classes fall under the superclass Tetrapoda, including Class Aves (birds), Class Mammalia (all mammals), and Class Reptilia (reptiles).\n\nList of Vertebrates in the Oceans\n\nEven though different groups range in biodiversity, population, size, and shape, here are some common examples of sea animals that are vertebrate:\n\nAnemonefish - Typical example of a marine vertebrate - as distinct from sea anemones.\n\nRed Saddleback Anemonefish\n\nAngelfish (saltwater species)\n\nBlue Ring Angelfish\n\nLemonpeel Angelfish\n\nBarracudas\n\nChevron Barracuda\n\nBatfishes\n\nCircular Batfish\n\nPinnate Batfish\n\nBlenny Fish\n\nCrested Blenny\n\nButterfly Fish\n\nAtoll Butterflyfish\n\nSchooling Bannerfish\n\nCardinal Fish\n\nApogon Imberbis\n\nAstrapogon Stellatus (conch fish)\n\nCobia\n\nDottybacks\n\nFlashlight Fish\n\nFrog Fish\n\nFusiliers\n\nGobies Fishes\n\nDragon Goby\n\nDwarf Pygmy Goby\n\nFirefish Goby\n\nGiant Goby\n\nYellow Prawn-goby\n\nGroupers\n\nLionfish\n\nMahi-Mahi (Dolphinfish)\n\nMola Mola\n\nMoray Eels\n\nParrot Fish\n\nPuffer fish\n\nRay Fish (batoids)\n\nManta Ray\n\nReef Manta Rays\n\nOceanic Manta Ray\n\nSkate Fish\n\nStingrays\n\nJenkins' Whipray\n\nRibbontail Ray\n\nScorpion Fish\n\nSea Bream\n\nDentex Fish\n\nSeahorses\n\nSeahorse Characteristics\n\nDeadly Killer Seahorses\n\nPygmy Seahorse\n\nSea Dragon Facts and Information\n\nSea Snakes\n\nBanded Sea Krait (Laticauda colubrina)\n\nShark Species\n\nBlue Shark Facts\n\nBull Sharks Facts\n\nHammerheads Facts\n\nHorn Shark Facts\n\nLeopard Shark Facts\n\nNurse Sharks\n\nWhale Shark Facts\n\nWhitetip Reef Shark\n\nSnappers\n\nStone Fish\n\nTurtles - Not having a 'visible' backbone - but it is there nonetheless\n\nHawksbill Sea Turtle\n\nWeever Fish (Trachinidae)\n\nLesser Weever\n\nGreater Weever\n\nSpotted Weever\n\nWrasse Fish Species\n\nAsian Sheepshead Wrasse\n\nCuckoo Wrasse\n\nSlingjaw Wrasse\n\nSlippery Dick Wrasse\n\nDivers also enjoyed reading about..."
