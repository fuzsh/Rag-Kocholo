        "text": "The Silver Ferns will meet 2023 Netball World Cup finalists the Australian Diamonds and England Roses during Netball New Zealand’s (NNZ) centenary celebrations, with both the Constellation Cup and Taini Jamison Trophy confirmed for the 2024 season.\n\nThis year NNZ has become the first netball association in the world to reach the centenary milestone and will mark the birthday with two Cadbury Netball Series against England in September and Australia in October.\n\nNetball NZ chief executive Jennie Wyllie said there was no better way to celebrate the sport’s governing body’s big birthday than by taking on last year’s Netball World Cup finalists.\n\n“The world champion Australian side continue to set the bar in international netball, but we showed with two wins in the Constellation Cup in 2023, that we have what it takes to beat the best,” she said.\n\n“England continue to be a threat on the international stage which they showed with their silver medal at the Netball World Cup, and we look forward to welcoming them to our shores again for the Taini Jamison Trophy, a trophy which means a lot to the Silver Ferns.\n\n“We can’t think of a better way to mark 100 years of netball in New Zealand than by playing two of the best teams in the sport, two of our greatest rivals.”\n\nThe Roses will travel to New Zealand to play the Silver Ferns in the opening Test at The Trusts Arena in Auckland on 29 September before heading to Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua on 2 October with the third Test to be played at ILT Stadium Southland in Invercargill on 6 October.\n\nWellington and Auckland will host the Diamonds in the first two Tests of the Constellation Cup to be played at TSB Arena on 20 October and 23 October at Spark Arena, before the series heads across the Tasman with two further Tests to be played in Australia. The dates and venues of the third and fourth Tests are yet to be confirmed by Netball Australia.\n\nThe Silver Ferns met both the Roses and Diamonds last year, coming from behind to beat England to win the Taini Jamison Trophy while they came close to claiming the Constellation Cup, losing the trans-Tasman series on goal difference after it was draw at two games apiece. Tickets will go on sale at a later date.\n\n2024 Cadbury Netball Series\n\nTaini Jamison Trophy\n\nSilver Ferns vs England Roses\n\nSunday, 29 September at The Trusts Arena in Auckland\n\nWednesday, 2 October at Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua\n\nSunday, 6 October at ILT Stadium Southland in Invercargill\n\nConstellation Cup\n\nSilver Ferns vs Australian Diamonds\n\nSunday, 20 October at TSB Arena in Wellington\n\nWednesday, 23 October at Spark Arena in Auckland\n\nAustralia (date & venue TBC)\n\nAustralia (date & venue TBC)"
