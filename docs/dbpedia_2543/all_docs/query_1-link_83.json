        "text": "Funds were set aside for one-off grants to support community initiatives associated with key focus areas. This includes support for projects and operating or capital costs.\n\nIf you missed this round, you can pre-register for the next one in our funding portal at the link below. For any announcements, watch our Facebook, Instagram, or this website.\n\nUnder the framework, the funding backs projects and organisations that will contribute to positive long-term change in The West. The grants concentrate on initiatives that support or are led by communities experiencing inequity in The Trusts’ region. The goal is to enable everyone to access opportunities, resources, networks, and support that enable people to do well on their terms.\n\n“We were impressed by the quality of many of the applications and pleased to see so many organisations addressing inequity in West Auckland,” says Linda Cooper, President of Waitakere Licensing Trust. “We held firm on following the process of focussing on the equity criteria, priorities, and key focus areas set out in The Trusts Community Funding Strategy,” she says. “Ultimately, we want to show that our funding is making an impact and helping to shift the dial for our community.”\n\nThe funding prioritised supporting communities with the most impact, Marcus Amosa, President of Portage Licensing Trust, says. Across all the focus areas, The Trusts prioritised funding centred on improving the lives of young people, connected, resilient and thriving communities, and sustainable environments, as well as partnering with Māori or supporting Pacific communities.\n\nCEO of The Trusts, Allan Pollard, says community members who aligned their application with the strategy fared better. He noted that many applications asked for operational support, writing that times were tougher and other funding sources had been reduced. He says that member organisations were conscious of lowering fees for their communities. Many applications involved supporting mental health, mentoring, and building resilience as people recover from the Auckland floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the challenging economic environment.\n\nThe Trust is reviewing the $250,000 Your West Innovation Fund applications and will report their outcome in the upcoming weeks.\n\nTwo hundred sixty organisations applied for $3,767,297 from Your West Support Fund. The successful recipients have been approved for $369,812 from Portage Licensing Trust and $375,353 from Waitākere Licensing Trust, totalling $745,165.\n\nHere are this year's recipients!"
