        "text": "More than 150 jobs were created during construction and the Victorian Government encouraged contractor Kane Constructions to maximise the female presence on the project. These efforts included a pilot program to encourage women and girls to consider a career in construction while half of Kane Constructions’ and Development Victoria’s project teams were female.\n\nAt the peak of construction, some 26,000 hours were worked by women, equal to 30 per cent of all contributing hours worked during that time. In total, 73 women worked on the redevelopment site in trade and support roles.\n\nYou can’t be what you can’t see, so the women in construction working on the Victorian Government’s $64.6M State Netball and Hockey Centre Redevelopment developed a program to encourage women to find their pathway in the construction industry.\n\nLed by Development Victoria and Kane Constructions, this program aims to promote the challenging and exciting roles within the sector for women."
