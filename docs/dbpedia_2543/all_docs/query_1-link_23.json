        "text": "OUR HISTORY\n\nIn the late 1980’s the Papakura District Council originally purchased the Park land. In a unique structure, the Trust has leased the park from the Council to provide the improvements and amenities. The Trust’s philosophy is that everyone in the community irrespective of age, gender, physical ability or nationality can use the facilities and services provided, for recreation, leisure or sporting pursuits.\n\nThe Trust will continue to build the best facilities that we can whether they be buildings such as the Netball Centre, Pulman Recreation Centre (formerly Gymsport & Recreation Centre), Team Sports Facility, sporting grounds such as the Cricket Ovals or walkways through a scented garden for the blind. The Park will also always be maintained to a high standard and utilised fully. The Trust is looking forward to the future of our community and the Park is an investment for future generations of the Papakura and Counties Manukau region.\n\nFOR THE COMMUNITY\n\nThe Trust is very conscious of the economic demographics of people who live in this region. The Bruce Pulman Park Trust has been set up specifically to maintain and manage the park on a self-funding basis. The Park also operates as a Resource Centre for the many “minor activities and sports” throughout the region who may have fields or playing areas but no clubrooms, computers or administration back up to effectively organise and run their particular activities or train their volunteers.\n\n​​​​​​​HOSTING EVENTS\n\nWe have had many events, large and small at the Park over the years including the World Masters Games (Basketball, Touch & Cycling), Relay for Life, the Circus, Papakura Fun Run and many regional, national and international sports competitions. We look forward to hosting many more exciting community events and sports tournaments."
