        "text": "England beat New Zealand by one goal in a frantic match to reach the final of the Nations Cup, where they will meet world number ones Australia on Sunday.\n\nIn front of a raucous crowd at Leeds' First Direct Arena, the Roses edged a thrilling 58-57 victory.\n\nThe match ebbed and flowed but England led by three before the final quarter and had just enough to hold on to win.\n\n\"A bit of a rollercoaster but that's to be expected,\" said head coach Jess Thirlby.\n\n\"I still don't think we have it worked out how to play against the New Zealand style but we've found our own way and I think that way is gritty. We need to be more efficient with our decision-making. Sometimes we're outsmarted, but have I seen progress? Yes I have.\"\n\nEngland are ranked third in the world while New Zealand are second and Thirlby said she is pleased to see her side begin to make a habit of beating the two dominant forces in netball.\n\n\"We're trying to pit ourselves against Australia and New Zealand as often as we can,\" she said.\n\n\"We're not in a space yet where we can expect to be winning these games by big margins, and as much as it might not look like it, I'm quite enjoying that we're being tested in the way we need to be.\"\n\nThe contest was the latest in a string of thrilling matches between the Roses and the Silver Ferns and, having both lost to 12-time world champions Australia last weekend in London, both sides knew they had to win it to book a place in the final.\n\nIn the World Cup semi-final last year, England came out on top, preventing New Zealand from featuring in the final for the first time in the tournament's history, before the Silver Ferns won a tightly contested three-match series 2-1 on their home turf in September.\n\nThirlby opted for a youthful team in that series but the return of England's experienced players as well as prolific New Zealand shooter Grace Nweke, who was injured for much of last year, made for a tight match.\n\nEngland came firing out of the blocks and it took three and a half minutes for the Silver Ferns to score, by which time the Roses had raced to a five-goal lead thanks to impressive defensive work from Razia Quashie, playing in a tournament for England for the first time since 2020.\n\nBut sloppiness on both sides gave the match a chaotic feel - much to the enjoyment of a buoyant Leeds crowd - and before long the Silver Ferns were back in touching distance, taking a one-goal lead into half-time.\n\nEngland had moments of brilliance - Fran Williams executed the perfect long-range pass to find Eleanor Cardwell under the post while Helen Housby continued to lead from the front in what has been a superb tournament for the 29-year-old.\n\nEllie Rattu, making just her ninth England appearance, showed her potential when she replaced the injured Imogen Allison - piling the pressure on a strong New Zealand attack, spearheaded by Nweke, who scored 47 of her 50 attempts.\n\nBoth teams' benches were on their feet for the final 15 minutes, screaming encouragement and instructions as New Zealand closed the gap to one with minutes on the clock.\n\nThe Silver Ferns had the chance to level with seconds to go but defender Funmi Fadoju popped up with a monumental intercept to prevent Tayla Earle's pass reaching sharp-shooter Nweke and England ran down the clock to see out victory.\n\nThe Roses suffered a narrow two-goal defeat by Australia last weekend and now face a tight turnaround before Sunday's rematch at 16:15 GMT.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Diamonds - already sure of their place in the final after two wins in London last week - faced Uganda for the first time in their history, beating them 63-49 and the African side will take on New Zealand in the third-place play-off match on Sunday."
