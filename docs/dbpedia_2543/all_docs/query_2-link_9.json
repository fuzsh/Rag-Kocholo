        "text": "Millions of Kiwis have passed through doors of The Trusts Area for some of the biggest events in Aotearoa. With fixed and retractable seating for up to 5000 people, the Henderson-based arena can host a motorcycle expo one day and world tours the next – past events include Bon Iver, Snoop Dogg and the super-popular Polynesian Night Markets.\n\nOn the sporting front, you can also get your basketball and netball fix at the indoor arena – this is the proud home of several teams including Waitākere West Auckland Basketball. Take the whole family to an outdoor sporting event at Douglas Track and Field (also known as Waitakere Stadium), a popular venue for athletics, rugby union, rugby league and football.\n\nThere are more than 2000 car parks all within easy walking distance of the arena, most of which are free."
