        "text": "Team History\n\nBased in Auckland, the Northern Mystics were formed in 2007 and represent the Netball Northern Zone whose geographical region stretches from Kaitaia to Waiuku. The Northern Zone has 17 Netball Centres and four satellite venues. The Zone makes up 34 percent of the playing population in New Zealand.\n\nEffectively a merger between the two former National Bank Cup teams, Northern Force and Auckland Diamonds, the Mystics subsequently became founder members of the trans-Tasman ANZ Championship in 2008.\n\nThe Mystics remained for the duration of the ANZ Championship, which ended in 2016, and since 2017 have represented Netball Northern in the ANZ Premiership. Netball Northern is the governing body that represents the Auckland and Northland regions.\n\nYvonne Willering became the Mystics first coach, in 2007, and Temepara Bailey (nee George) its first player.\n\nThe Mystics had their best season in the ANZ Championship in 2011 when the Debbie Fuller-coached team made the Grand Final but had to settle for the runners-up spot when losing to the Queensland Firebirds. They finished third in 2012.\n\nIn the ANZ Premiership, introduced in 2017, the Mystics clinched their first-ever domestic silverware after a 14-year wait when winning the 2021 title.\n\nThe Mystics’ playing strip is predominantly blue while their home venues are The Trusts Arena, Eventfinda Stadium and Vector Arena."
