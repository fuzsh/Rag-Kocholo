From those results, a large team is selected to represent the College at the Auckland Zone competition, including relay teams. The top three from this competition qualify for the Champions of Champions at Mt Smart Stadium.\n\nSaint Kentigern has had a lot of success over the years in the Auckland Championships with many students going on to represent Auckland at the North Island Championships. Our relay teams in particular have broken many College and Auckland records in recent years.\n\nThe National Athletics Championships take place in Term 4 around New Zealand and each year, a number of our students qualify. Top Athletes are encouraged to belong to a club for specialised coaching and training.\n\nBasketball\n\nBasketball is the biggest growing sport at Saint Kentigern. We currently have 18 teams for boys and girls, involving over 260 athletes at all levels. Students also take on the responsibilities of referees and coaches required to facilitate the number of teams - this helps build relationships between the Premier players and Juniors.\n\nCompetition is held during Terms 2 and 3 throughout the greater Auckland area. We have some of the best facilities in the country, with both a two-court gym and a show court, where both the Premier boys and girls compete on a Friday night. Our aim is to be competitive in all grades and have some fun along the way. A big part of our programme is the development of our coaches. We have several student athletes involved in the Premier space who sacrifice their time to offer their knowledge and experience to the next generation of students coming through. We also have several old collegians who have returned to offer their services and help give back.\n\nThe Basketball programme is led by Aaron Young and in recent years, he has developed the programme with the Premier Boys team having their best result in school history, winning the Nationals in 2019.\n\nAaron has been in involved in NZ U17 programme for several years and is the current Head Coach for the NBL team Auckland Tuatara. He has also been selected this year as assistant coach for NZU19 Boys.\n\nThe girls’ program is led by Darci Finnigan, an old collegian who has done an outstanding job building a strong foundation for future success. Recently being promoted into the Premier division in 2022, the direction of the program is in great hands.\n\nCricket\n\nCricket is an exciting and challenging game to play and our coaches encourage commitment and learning as ways to improve, enjoy and have success as both an individual and a team.\n\nThe cricket season starts in Term 1 and continues in Term 4. Games may be played either at home or at school venues throughout the Auckland Cricket Zone. Boys’ Cricket is played at the weekend, with Girls’ Cricket played mid-week.\n\nSaint Kentigern boys and girls 1st XI teams compete in the Auckland Premier competitions, which culminate in National finals at Gillette Cup and Venus Cup respectively. In addition to premier cricket, we offer 14 limited overs and T20 teams that contest grades at all levels to suit any ability.\n\nSaint Kentigern cricket offers coaching, facilities, and a development programme that is second to none.\n\nProfessional Coaches\n\nThe coaching team is led by Head Coach Mark O’Donnell who brings extensive National and International experience to the college. Mark spent 11 seasons as head coach of the Auckland Aces, during which time the Aces captured 8 domestic trophies. He has also held an assistant coach role with the Blacks Caps, and has had International experience with coaching roles in India at the IPL and in the West Indies in the CPL.\n\nMark is joined by a group of vastly experienced coaches:\n\nWajih Uddin - Former 1st Class player with 10,000+ FC runs, and former men’s premiers team coach at Suburbs New Lynn CC\n\nGraeme Beghin – Former Auckland Aces player and current men’s premiers team coach at Auckland University CC\n\nRoy Goodyear – Former 1st Class player and current men’s premiers team coach at Ellerslie\n\nJonathan McInroy - Vastly experienced District Level and School coach\n\nColin Munro – Former Black Cap and current T20 star player\n\nIn addition to the coaching team is strength and conditioning specialist Diederick Kruger.

Within the pavilion is a world class gymnasium, run by a full-time strength and conditioning team.\n\nJunior Cricket Development Classes\n\nThe College offers Cricket Development Classes for talented and committed Year 9 and Year 10 players, and is run by Head of Cricket Mark O’Donnell\n\nIf invited to join the Cricket Development Class, cricket will be included as part of the students curriculum with 4 sessions included each 7 day period throughout the academic year.\n\nClasses will help students develop their practical and mental skills, as a pathway to senior cricket, and are supported by strength and conditioning sessions with coach Diederick Kruger at the college gymnasium.\n\nCycling\n\nCollege cycling covers both road and track cycling. During the winter, we focus on road cycling and in spring and early summer, we focus on track cycling. Our programme caters for boys and girls at all levels, including beginners. We have excellent coaches, all of whom have represented New Zealand, who are committed to the cycling programme and nurturing athletes.\n\nWe have a cycling shed in the Sports Centre, where our equipment is stored and training commences. We have loan bikes available, for a small seasonal fee, to allow new entrants to try the sport. Tamaki Youth Development Sports Club Inc, TYDSCI, is our support club, run by parents, providing equipment such as wind trainers and racing helmets; funding for international representatives, coaching and other assistance.\n\nCycling is a demanding but fulfilling sport that teaches discipline, teamwork and provides a basis for a strong work ethic. Saint Kentigern College cycling has a proud record, winning many team titles and individual titles. We have cyclists who have represented New Zealand and others who have gone on to ride in prestigious international trade teams in Europe.\n\nCycling provides an excellent opportunity for students to become high performing endurance athletes and leaders.\n\nEquestrian\n\nOur equestrians are known for their sportsmanship, skill and, most importantly, their team attitude. Whilst riders often come from different disciplines and levels of skill, we do make a real effort to get together as a team and support each other during events. Our team typically consists of around 20 riders, with 4-8 attending events.\n\nThe equestrian season runs all year, with our earliest event usually at the beginning of Term 1, and our last event in Term 3. Events take place in Auckland, Cambridge and down in Taupo. Any riders are welcome to sign up for events from which teams are selected. Parents are expected to transport riders and their horses to and from events, or to organise transport. A school representative will be at most events to organise teams, timings and updates. Uniforms are available at Mungos, helmet covers and ears for pony/hack are supplied and saddle blankets are shared.\n\nFencing\n\nFencing meets for practice on Wednesdays from 3.30 – 5pm throughout Terms 1-3. Everyone is welcome to attend, though beginners need to start at the beginning of a year when the basic skills are introduced. We have external coaches who come to coach and students may learn either Foil or Sabre as their weapon of choice. Students are welcome to just come to Wednesday training sessions, but those looking to further develop their skills are encouraged to also participate in the Secondary School’s competitions which are held on Saturdays at the Trusts Stadium in Waitakere. These competitions are on an individual basis, and there is also a Teams event in which the College enters a number of teams.\n\nFootball\n\nSaint Kentigern has over 30 football teams ranging from Premier through to competitive and social grades.\n\nTrials are in Term 1, with boys’ competition games on Saturday mornings. Girls’ games are Wednesday after school. Most teams practise at least once a week after school. The football season runs through Terms 2 and 3, although our Football development classes are all year round. Games are played home and away each week.\n\nOur Football Development classes are run for selected boys and girls in Years 7-11. Taking place during Terms 1-4, these classes are for competitive players only and the sessions consist of three field sessions and one strength and conditioning session per 7-day cycle.\n\nThe Boys 1st X1 won the New Zealand Secondary School league in 2018 for the first time in 26 years and were NZ Champions in 2016. They have regularly had players involved in both New Zealand U17 & U20 age group World Cup squads.\n\nOld Collegian, Matt Ridenton went on to become a professional player, initially with Wellington Phoenix and now Newcastle Jets in the Hyundai A-League\n\nThe Girls’ 1st XI won the Auckland Premiership for the first time in 2017 and again in 2018. They were also crowned NZ champions in 2017 for the first time. The girls have had a number of players go on to NZ level teams and Hannah Blake has been Saint Kentigern’s latest NZ Football White Fern in 2018.\n\nGolf\n\nSaint Kentigern College Golf competitions and programmes are widely available to all students and those wishing to represent the College in Auckland or New Zealand Golf Competitions. Our teams are always at the top of their respective competitions throughout Auckland and New Zealand. As winners of the Auckland Teams College Event thirteen times in the last fifteen years, our teams have shown their dominance with numerous provincial and National Individual awards for our players.\n\nMondays in Term 1 is for 9-hole stroke play - the Premier golf team championship for Auckland Secondary School teams. The College has several teams entered in the different divisions of the Auckland Secondary Schools golf championships. The individual Nobilo Saint Kentigern Championships, along with the Auckland Secondary Schools individual eventing programme is held in In Term 2.\n\nGraduates have made their way in a number of areas in golf on leaving the College. These include golf scholarships to the USA, some players turning professional and heading on the different professional tours, and some involved in leading roles within the golf industry.\n\nHockey\n\nThe College is very fortunate to have Ramesh Patel as Director of Hockey, who runs all the trials, selects the teams and coaches many of our teams at the College.\n\nSaint Kentigern has 8-10 teams representing the College in the Auckland competitions across the age groups. Games are played Monday-Fridays in Term 2 and the first half of Term 3, and teams are transported to their games. Students need to have their own stick, mouthguard and shin guards to play and can purchase the uniform at Mungos.\n\nTeams will either practise in the morning or after school on the College turf, or down the road at Auckland Hockey. Year 7 & 8 teams compete in Zone competitions and exchanges.\n\nThe Hockey Boys 1st XI was crowned Auckland, Super City and Rankin Cup Champions in 2018.\n\nEvery year, students are encouraged to represent their region and consistently have over 25 junior representatives, with a few going on to higher honours when they leave school. More recently, Old Collegian Lulu Tuilotolava was our first female Black Stick named in 2018.\n\nMultisport\n\nTriathlon at the College encompasses triathlon, aquathon and duathlon events. The year starts with an intensive three-day triathlon training camp in Taupo in mid to late January. Following this, we train after school twice a week, with Auckland and National competitions held throughout Term 1.\n\nOur programme caters for boys and girls at all levels, including beginners. Various skills in the open water and on the bike are developed. We have experienced coaches who compete in the sport themselves and bring a love of the sport to training.\n\nThe College campus provides an excellent training ground with the school swimming pool, access to quiet cycling roads and expansive fields and a walking/cycling pathway to run on. We have a cycling shed facility to store bikes and loan bikes are available for a small fee. Loan bikes and other equipment such as wind trainers are provided by Tamaki Youth Development Sports Club Inc, TYDSCI which is a support club run by parents.\n\nThe College has a very strong and proud history of individual and team national triathlon titles, and students have gone on to represent New Zealand on the world stage, including competing at the Olympic Games. Triathlon provides a unique challenge tying in three sports, allowing variety for students and great development of endurance.\n\nWhile an individual sport, the team culture provides camaraderie among students and helps bring the best out of each other to develop as people and athletes.\n\nNetball\n\nThe Netball Programme aims to provide a service to all those that wish to play, coach or umpire. An essential part of our programme is to facilitate a pathway for improvement for all players, coaches and officials.\n\nOver the last 10 years, the sport has grown at the College and now over teams compete each week in Terms 2 and 3 at the Auckland Netball Centre, either on a Saturday morning, or Tuesday afternoon for Year 7and 8 teams.\n\nIn addition to these teams, Saint Kentigern has two Netball Development classes, one in Year 9 and one in Year 10. These classes are offered to students who are selected in either of the top two teams for their age group. Both classes include key areas of netball performance, such as video analysis, nutrition, sports psychology, strength and conditioning, and technical and tactical practical sessions.\n\nAll coaches are guided through a mentoring process and regularly observed to maintain high standards. Progression through coaching qualifications is also encouraged.\n\nNetball at Saint Kentigern has grown in success with the top teams in each age group regularly placing in the top two of their grade and Senior A and Premier teams winning various tournament titles.\n\nWe are proud that we produce industrious and committed athletes who regularly achieve the ‘next step’ of their journey be it representative, BEKO or professional contracts with ANZ teams. Such athletes include Tori Kolose, Sydney Fraser, Amorangi Malesala and Tayla Earle\n\nOrienteering\n\nOrienteering challenges both the mind and the body. The sprint series in Term 1 is ideal for students to try out the sport, and then this progresses into forest events and rogaines spread throughout the year. Prior to each different type of event, we have meetings to teach students new skills, particularly related to features on maps, use of compasses, orientation of maps etc. Coaches are present at the events to give feedback to students after their course.\n\nStudents from Saint Kentigern are able to compete in regional events, North Island Championships and Nationals each year. There is scope for elite athletes to be selected for NZ teams. Each year, a NZ Secondary School team is selected to compete in the Australian championships.\n\nThere are opportunities to compete on the world stage in this sport, as schools are selected to represent NZ and compete in the World Secondary School orienteering championships every 2 years.\n\nRowing\n\nSaint Kentigern College Rowing Club runs a full programme for both girls and boys operating out of the club’s rowing shed, which is located on the banks of the Tamaki River, conveniently situated on the edge of the College campus. We are also very fortunate to have a pontoon so rowers can easily access the water during training sessions.\n\nThe club ensures that all rowing skiffs are of the highest quality to enable our rowers to compete at the top level at regattas throughout the season. All classes of boats are available from single sculls to the latest eight oar skiffs for all age groups.\n\nThe success of the club is due to our commitment in ensuring that we have access to the best possible equipment and fully committed coaches to achieve at the highest level. As a result, we have had a number of rowers go on to represent New Zealand at all levels, and also gain entrance into Ivy League Universities in the USA.\n\nAs a sport, rowing has been recognised as a key part in the development of young students, the discipline and work ethic instilled in our young rowers are attributes that will remain with them for life.\n\nRugby\n\nRugby is a high-profile sport at the College. There are always 8-10 teams competing for the College in the Auckland Secondary Schools competition each year, including the 1st XV in the 1A competition.\n\nRugby competitions run in Term 2 and the first 3 weeks of Term 3 on Saturdays, with two trainings for each team during the week after school. Trials and preseason trainings are run in Term 1\n\nWe have a proud history in the 1A competition, especially over the last 10 years, winning the Auckland Championships title five times, and also the World Schools title in 2013\n\nMany of our players go on to Mitre 10 Cup, Super Rugby, Sevens, League and international teams, including in recent years, Dalton Papalii, Blake Gibson, Braydon Ennor, Matt Duffie, TJ Faiane, Etene Nanai-Seturo, Patrick Herbert, Sam Nock, Paripari Parkinson and Finlay Christie.\n\nIn Years 9 and 10, students have the opportunity to trial for the Rugby Academy, which is run during class time. This is a Development Programme covering the basic fundamentals of rugby, along with a strength and conditioning programme throughout the year.\n\nTable Tennis\n\nThe College table tennis programme caters for both high achieving table tennis players and those wishing to represent the College on Friday afternoons in a team environment.\n\nThe College has 24 international standard tables, offering excellent practice facilities and also for hosting the inter-college competition for East Auckland.

Patrick has had extensive coaching experience at both regional and national level, working with both juniors and adults, and is currently the Auckland Table Tennis Association coach with responsibility for schools in East Auckland.\n\nIn recent years, the Saint Kentigern College Premier team has won the Auckland Secondary Schools title, Auckland Secondary Schools Knock-Out title and the Auckland Regional Champion of Champions title.\n\nStudents from the College have not only been successful in winning local, regional and New Zealand titles but also Oceania titles.
