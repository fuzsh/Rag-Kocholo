        "text": "Maidstone Sports Hub has been renamed at the last Council meeting on 1 November to Te Kupenga o Rongomai - Maidstone Sports Hub\n\nThe new name has been gifted by Te Āti Awa and makes a connection between Te Kupenga (a fishing net) and the Hub's outreach to the community, fostering unity and collaboration.\n\nShared clubrooms and indoor training facility\n\nBuildings are 100% dried in. Waterproofing work continues at the Grandstand allowing glass balustrades and seating to be installed next Month.\n\nTremendous amount of interior work has progressed during the race to final completion. Sports flooring is programmed for next Month with interior linings and painting nearing completion.\n\nCar park works almost complete, and it includes the decision to replace the existing paving with new. This was partially funded by the Contractor. Concrete kerbing and walkways to be completed shortly.\n\nTe Aka o te Kupenga - Maidstone Park Trust\n\nMaidstone Trust has been renamed at the last Council meeting on 1 November to Te Aka o te Kupenga Maidstone Park Trust\n\nThe ‘aka’ or vine is the thread that holds the entire net, it supports the net, shapes the net, it’s the part you hold to guide the nets direction,\n\n“The aka, in many instances, is also responsible for delivering waiora (waters of sustenance) and is an indication of life. There is also the added play on words, in its connection with Akatarawa as one of the key mountain ranges in the area.”\n\nTwo new trustees have been appointed from 1 November, Alice O’ Connor and Vincent Jagers\n\nAbout the new Trustees\n\nAlice O’Connor:\n\nAlice is currently engaged in Employment Relations within the Public Service, notably contributing to the Water Services Reform Programme. Although not originally from Upper Hutt, having made the move from Christchurch to Wellington in 2010, she officially became a local in 2017 upon settling in Upper Hutt with her partner. The decision to pursue the Trustee role was fueled by a genuine desire to give back to the community. As she steps into this role, Alice looks forward to actively engaging with diverse community groups and witnessing the vibrant utilisation of Maidstone Sports Hub. You can usually find her staying active by exploring the scenic tracks around Upper Hutt and Te Awa Kairangi, and whenever time permits, they indulge in their passion for travel.\n\nVincent Jaggers:\n\nAs the business manager for Clark Construction Services, located on Railway Ave in Maidstone, directly opposite the new facility at Maidstone Park, Vincent oversees a wide range of construction projects. Vincent’s responsibilities span from residential concrete crack repairs to large-scale civil infrastructure initiatives. Although born and raised in Christchurch, both of his parents have roots in Upper Hutt, and after moving to the area six years ago for work and to be closer to his partner, Rachel, they have witnessed the significant growth and transformation of Upper Hutt. Seeking a deeper connection with the community and a meaningful undertaking, he eagerly accepted a position on the board. Vincent’s focus is on meeting the needs of the diverse members of the community and collaborating to maximise the benefits of both existing and new facilities at Maidstone Park. Balancing the demands of managing the business side of construction, he cherishes the limited free hours spent walking with his partner and their two border collies, exploring local cafes for the best cup of coffee, and maintaining a close bond with their grandmother in Riverside. Despite a busy schedule, family remains a priority, with regular visits to Christchurch to spend time with their dad, sister, and niece.\n\nOther parts of the Masterplan for Maidstone Park\n\nDug outs and bleachers on the multi turf have been installed with some minor finishing work to do.\n\nBleachers by the hockey turf have been installed\n\nWhakatiki Park. The softball diamond alterations have been completed\n\nWhakatiki Park Pavilion agreed works completed.\n\nMaidstone Park Toilet Block – building work has been completed at the Permaloo factory in Gisborne. Site clearance is finished, and the consent is being completed to install the new facility.\n\nSocial Media\n\nFollow Te Aka o te Kupenga on social media:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nOCTOBER 2022 UPDATE\n\nA group of new Trustees have been appointed to the newly created Maidstone Park Trust.\n\nThe Trust, guided by Upper Hutt City Council as a Council Controlled Organisation (CCO), will govern the Maidstone Park Community Sports Hub which includes the shared clubrooms and indoor training facility (currently under construction), and other associated park functions.\n\nThe Trustees were appointed by an interview committee consisting of four Councillors and an independent appointee. “The process for shortlisting and assessing the ten applicants interviewed was thorough and robust” says Council’s Director of Community Services, Mike Ryan.\n\n“The committee was cognizant of ensuring that there was a complimentary mix of skill sets and governance experience amongst the Trustees. We’re confident that the Trustees appointed will work together to advance the purposes of the Trust and enhance the usage of the Maidstone Park Community Sports Hub and in turn the growth of sport, physical activity and play opportunities within our community.”\n\nThe Trustees will appoint a Chair and Deputy Chair at their first meeting scheduled for November.\n\nThe Trustees have a significant amount of work to get through which includes the signing of the Trust Deed, signing of the Management Agreement with Council, registering themselves as a Charitable Trust, developing all the processes and policies for the operation of the hub, employment of staff, along with stakeholder engagement and the establishment of an Operating Advisory Committee.\n\nJointly funded by Council and the Government’s Covid infrastructure recovery fund, the Maidstone Community Sports Hub project is on track to be completed by September 2023, years ahead of its original timeframe.\n\nLeft to right – Julie Morrison, Julie Hood, Zara Kljakovic, Christina Edmonds, Tania Yorwarth, Kelvin Watson\n\nMAY 2022 UPDATE\n\nWe have formally adopted a proposal that will see a new Council Controlled Organisation (CCO) created for Maidstone Park, following consultation with the community earlier this year.\n\nSeveral operating models were assessed to determine the best approach, but a CCO (with charitable trust status) that will provide and promote sporting, recreation, play and leisure opportunities at Maidstone Park, was the option consulted on and supported by the community.\n\nA CCO is an entity in which one or more local authorities control 50% or more of voting rights or appoint 50% or more of the members of the governing body.\n\nThe CCO will initially be responsible for the governance, management and operation of the new shared clubrooms and indoor training facility (green room) currently under construction. The CCO will also take on the responsibilities of the Maidstone Park Turf Trust, which is to be wound up. This Trust oversees the bookings for the multi-use artificial turf and training areas and the bottom level of the pavilion facility (changing rooms and storage).\n\nProgress on the new facility is tracking well, with an estimated completion date of September 2023.\n\nFunding for this (and other additional improvements at Maidstone Park) was received from Council, and the Government as part of its Covid-19 recovery response infrastructure programme.\n\nDirector of Community Services, Mike Ryan says “it’s important to us that the current and future groups who will use the park have a well-managed facility and get the access and support they need.”\n\n“The next step is to appoint trustees to be in place by September/October 2022. The CCO Trustee positions will be open to all within the community, through a transparent, skill-based appointment process. Once appointed, the trustees will start creating their Statement of Intent, engaging staff, and establishing an Operations Advisory Committee” Ryan says.\n\nMore information about the consultation and the establishment of the CCO is available here: letskorero.upperhuttcity.com/mp-trust\n\nFEBRUARY 2022 UPDATE\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Sport and Recreation, Grant Robertson, joined Mayor Guppy, Minister Hipkins, and other community representatives at Maidstone Park on Friday to mark the official ground-breaking of the Maidstone Community Sport Hub project.\n\nThe comprehensive redevelopment of Upper Hutt’s sporting and recreation hub has been fast-tracked thanks to a $15 million funding boost from the Government.\n\nWith demolition of the old club rooms complete, this milestone marks the first phase of construction which will see a new, shared clubrooms and indoor training facility.\n\nBringing together a number of sporting facilities at a centralised hub and creating partnerships between groups, provides the opportunity to consolidate facilities and the operation to be more sustainable and efficient for the future.\n\n“We know many of our sports and clubs here in Upper Hutt are finding it tough to keep things going, with the impacts of COVID-19 and rising operating costs” says Mayor Guppy. “Bringing everyone together to share the new facilities will be an absolute game changer.”\n\nThe hub has been designed in collaboration with the key sports clubs based at Maidstone Park to ensure it meets local needs, but once complete, Upper Hutt City Council believes it will position Maidstone Park as one of the top recreation and leisure destinations in the region.\n\n“With nearby public transport and hospitality offerings, and the recently redeveloped and incredibly popular Maidstone Max, the park has the potential to become a unique and much sought after destination” Mayor Guppy says.\n\nThe Maidstone Community Sports Hub is a major project planned in Upper Hutt City Council’s 2021-2031 Long Term Plan (LTP). It’s on track for completion in late 2023, years ahead of its original timeframe.\n\nYou can watch a video of the sports hub design and read more about the project below.\n\nPhoto (L to R): Minister Robertson, Will Coard (Maycroft), Mayor Guppy, Nigel Grenside (Maycroft), Minister Hipkins and Pip Julian (Stephenson & Turner).\n\nJANUARY 2022 UPDATE\n\nThe Maidstone Community Sports Hub project is well underway thanks to funding from the Government’s COVID-19 recovery response infrastructure programme and council.\n\nNow we’re looking ahead to make sure that once complete, we have the right model in place to manage the facilities, and to support the organisations that use the park.\n\nWe’ve assessed several options to determine the best approach and we think establishing a Council Controlled Organisation (CCO) to provide and promote sporting, recreation, play and leisure opportunities for the community at Maidstone Park, is the best option.\n\nWe’d like to hear what you think.\n\nTo read the Statement of Proposal and to make a submission, go to letskorero.upperhuttcity.com/mp-trust\n\nFeedback closes at 5pm on 24 February 2022.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021 UPDATE\n\nOn Monday 13 September, construction of the new indoor training facility and shared clubrooms will begin at Maidstone Park. With contractors’ onsite and the building cordoned off, there will be some changes to the vehicular and pedestrian access for members of the public.\n\nParking\n\nThere will be no public parking onsite at the construction site, as indicated on the map below in red. Instead, we ask the community to look for other parking areas such as on street parking in Railway Ave, Maidstone Terrace, or Park Street, as well as considering public transport options on game days.\n\nPedestrian access\n\nPedestrian access to the Heretaunga Boxing Club building, Rams Gym, and the rugby fields is shown on the map below in yellow. There will also be way-finding signage on display in these areas.\n\nRugby fields\n\nPremier rugby games in 2022 will still be played at Maidstone Park on our premium playing surfaces, and Portacom changing facilities will be provided.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nFor more information about the Maidstone Community Sports Hub project, go to:\n\nContact a member of our project team at mcshinfo@uhcc.govt.nz.\n\nFollow us on Facebook @UpperHuttCityCouncil.\n\nIf you’re interested in booking Maidstone Park for a sporting event, go to our website and search ‘Book a park’.\n\nJULY 2021 UPDATE\n\nWe’re building a new indoor training facility and shared clubrooms, to help community sport and activities in Upper Hutt thrive.\n\nIt’s the first stage of a three year project which involves upgrades to multiple sporting facilities at the park. Construction is kicking off in September.\n\nThe new community indoor training facility and shared clubrooms will be built where the UH Rams RFC clubrooms are today. The club will move to temporary premises for the 2022 rugby season, and will then co-locate with other sports clubs and groups in the new building.\n\nThe wider components of the sports hub project (upgraded car park, petanque pistes, new tennis shelter, football dugouts, hockey shelters etc.) will be delivered in Stage two (in future financial years and as cashflow is available).\n\nThis project is being jointly funded by Upper Hutt City Council and the Government, as part of the Covid-19 recovery response infrastructure programme.\n\nBringing together a number of sporting facilities at a centralised hub and creating partnerships between groups, provides the opportunity to consolidate facilities and the operation to be more sustainable and efficient for the future. The hub has been designed in collaboration with the key sports clubs based at Maidstone Park to ensure it meets local needs, but once complete, we believe it will position Maidstone Park as one of the top recreation and leisure destinations in the region. With nearby public transport and hospitality offerings, and the recently redeveloped and incredibly popular Maidstone Max, the park has the potential to become a unique and much sought after destination.\n\nSince August 2020, we've been in regular contact with all of the sports and clubs who operate at the park. Clubs nominated two representatives who continue to liaise with the project team. Club representatives attended workshops with architects and other clubs to understand current and future needs. There were a number of opportunities for the wider community to engage in the project, through our Facebook page and at various locations across the city. We ran a 'Sharing Memories' series on Facebook, featuring some of the clubs who operate at the park and some of their most iconic, historical moments. The official ground-breaking event with Ministers Robertson and Hipkins was shared across local, regional and national news channels in February 2022.\n\nThe cost of operating the Maidstone Community Sports Hub is unknown at this time. The charges for use of the facility will be determined by the Council Controlled Organisation (CCO). The Management Agreement between Council and the CCO will identify the key principles and expectations which will provide guidance to the CCO as they determine the community charges. It is proposed to have a tiered price structure with the CCO charges to sports and community groups being fair and reasonable and at rates below other potential users. We are committed to ensuring access and use of the Maidstone Community Sports Hub by community sports, recreation and leisure groups, with minimal barriers in place."
