        "text": "Just before Christmas I finished up with VenuesLive WA at Optus Stadium in Perth. We have just driven the Nullarbor (bucket list) and are now back in Melbourne. I am taking a few months to settle the family back in and work out what is next for me. My seven years at the stadium was extraordinary. From the pre operational period in 2017, where what we achieved in one year to get the venue ready was always hard to comprehend, to the delivery of hundreds of major events, thousands of Meetings & Special Events, tours, cafe operations and Stadium Park events. The skill, hard work, dedication and passion of the VenuesLive team over these years has been inspiring and drove all of us to new levels. Led brilliantly by Mike McKenna and a great executive, we succeeded in what we set out to do - make sure Perth and WA was super proud of their most beautiful stadium in the world, become an entertainment destination of choice and deliver a premium fans first experience every time. A shoutout to the Events & Operations team members over the years - I am so proud of each and every one of you and what we achieved together. Thank you for giving it everything you had, every day…and for caring so much about our brilliant stadium and each other. Best wishes for a big 2024. For those playing at home, in amongst hundreds of incredible events, here are my top five! 5) Chelsea FC 2018 (so proud of how we fired up all the toys in the stadium - it was spectacular and made everyone stand up and take notice) 4) AFL Grand Final 2021 (a GF is always special but to deliver it in 25 days in the middle of COVID was next level - the broader AFL team was awesome to work with). 3) Coldplay November 2023 (seven years of hard work culminated for us in the delivery of a pair of events as perfect as you would ever want and an experience for patrons and staff that was nothing short of two hours of elation) 2) WCE v Collingwood Qualifying Final in 2018 (Optus stadium heaving…the first time I felt the stadium bounce…the noise in the last quarter was stupid) 1) Scorchers winning the BBL Final in early 2023 (exactly why the stadium was built - hot Perth night, full house, super cricket venue, home team icing the game in the last over after looking like they were gone…never heard anything like it). Thank you to everyone at the stadium, Venues West, our clubs, hirers and those across the supporting agencies in Perth that look after the venue with passion and professionalism. Perth is a magic place and we loved every day of this special time."
