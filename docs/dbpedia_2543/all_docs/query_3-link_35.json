        "text": "The Netball Super League is back and it starts with a bang.\n\nAll 10 teams will take to the court for an action-packed opening day on Saturday at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena.\n\nWith plans to professionalise and stars on the move, there are plenty of talking points.\n\nAnd who will earn a place in June's Grand Final?\n\nBBC Sport discusses everything you need to know about this season.\n\nThe big talking point for 2024 is that this campaign will be the last in its current format as the Super League prepares to relaunch as a professional league in 2025.\n\nEngland Netball, the sport's governing body, began an open tender process in October for expressions of interest in joining the newly reformed league and the teams who will be involved are expected to be announced before the end of this season.\n\nBut while ambitions for creating a better experience for fans are high with more matches in arenas and investment in a better \"on-court product\", most players currently also work or study alongside their netball careers.\n\n\"The players are at the heart of everything we do and it's about being able to pay them better and more fairly,\" said Super League chief executive Claire Nelson. \"We will be looking at improving and increasing what they get paid but it will be a slow and steady move towards full professionalisation.\"\n\nBut Manchester Thunder head coach Karen Greig said it is a period of \"uncertainty\" for the league and its players.\n\n\"We have to get bums on seats and get people to follow our sport,\" said Greig. \"We can put a label on it but what does it look like for the players?\n\n\"We've got players that are doctors or teachers with careers. They're not going to be able to just drop everything to become a full-time netballer.\"\n\nHot on the tails of the more established Super League sides are London Pulse, who only joined the league in 2019 but reached a maiden final last year.\n\nWith a plethora of England internationals in their side, including fan favourite Funmi Fadoju and exciting young shooters Olivia Tchine and Berri Neil, Pulse will undoubtedly be bidding for another final.\n\nManchester Thunder were stung by their semi-final loss to Lightning last year; the four-time champions could equal Team Bath's record of five trophies should they take the crown this time.\n\nMeanwhile, the loss of Guscoth and last year's captain Yasmin Brookes could make Surrey Storm's bid for a second consecutive semi-final tricky while Saracens Mavericks have recruited well and will be determined to break their five-season run of finishing fifth, just outside the play-off places.\n\nThe addition of Mentor to Leeds Rhinos is a brilliant bit of business to add experience to their ranks and Severn Stars continue to build on what was a solid season for them last year."
