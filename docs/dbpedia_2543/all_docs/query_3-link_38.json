Leaky roofs and aging facilities could dim the spotlight on future generations. Highly discounted rates allow everyone to participate, but economic hardship threatens this very mission. We can't let this playground of dreams shut down!\n\nYour donation, no matter the size, makes a difference. It ensures Barfoot & Thompson Stadium remains a beacon of hope and opportunity.\n\nTogether, let's invest in our shared future. Donate today and be a hero for this beloved landmark. With your help, we can keep the heart of our community beating strong for another 40!\n\nGood in the Hood\n\nWe are also proud to announce that we have been selected to take part in Good in the Hood for 2024. You can vote for us in-store at our local Kepa Road Z, between 26th August - 22nd September."
