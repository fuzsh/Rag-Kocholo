        "text": "Netball Manawatu has a proud history.\n\nNetball was first played in Palmerston North in 1914. Over the years, the competitions and programmes have developed in all aspects making Netball the number one sport for women in New Zealand. The home of Netball Manawatu is Vautier Park, a modern regional outdoor facility with 17 courts. On-site catering is available during competition days. A number of our competitions are held indoors at Central Energy Trust Arena. Today we have over 4,500 players, coaches, umpires and officials actively involved in everyone's game."
