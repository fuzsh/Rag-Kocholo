        "text": "The Constellation Cup is an annual highlight of the world netball calendar, with two powerhouse sides — the Australian Diamonds and the New Zealand Silver Ferns — having competed for the pride of their countries and our friendly national rivalry since 2010.\n\nEach year two matches take place in Australia and two in New Zealand, with rotating host cities.\n\nThe Diamonds will take on the Silver Ferns at RAC Arena in Perth on 27 October 2024 at 4pm WST, coinciding with Netball WA’s ‘100 years of netball’ celebration commemorating the centenary of the organisation as the sport’s governing body.\n\nNetball is the highest female participation sport in Australia and Netball WA will be hosting a range of events to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nThis comes off the back of fresh interest in the sport at the highest level in Australia. The Diamonds won their 12th World Cup title at the 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town and a gold medal at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games.\n\nAustralia has won 11 of the past 13 Constellation Cup competitions.\n\nNetball WA will deliver the event with the support of an allocation from the Sport and Recreation Events Funding Program.\n\nNetball WA CEO Simone Hansen cannot wait to see the Australian Diamonds in action at the country’s best netball stadium. She said:\n\n“We are very grateful and overjoyed that we have been able to work with the Government, Minister, Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries and Netball Australia to secure this match which will be the perfect way to celebrate the centenary of Netball WA.\n\n“It has been five years since there has been a test match at RAC Arena and we know that the Netball Community and WA sports fans will turn out in their droves for the all-important third test match of the Constellation Cup series.”\n\nNetball Australia CEO Stacey West added: “We are incredibly excited to host the third match, and the first on Australian soil, of the Constellation Cup at Perth’s RAC Arena.\n\n“We thank the Western Australian Government and Netball WA for their investment and support and hope to see a full house of Origin Australian Diamonds fans at RAC Arena.”"
