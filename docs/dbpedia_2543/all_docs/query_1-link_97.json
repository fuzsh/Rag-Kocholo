        "text": "The Central Energy Trust Arena is one of New Zealand’s busiest and most versatile venues.\n\nThe biggest sporting and events complex in the lower North Island, the Arena handles around 3,000 bookings a year and hosts 36 sporting codes, along with trade shows, exhibitions, weddings, dinners, conferences, meetings, festivals, concerts and more.\n\nThe venue brings in more than 400,000 visitors each year. Many of these people live outside of Palmerston North and come here for an event, stay the night in local accommodation, eat out, and enjoy our recreational activities. In 2021, the NZ Superstock Teams Championships weekend alone contributed more than $5.2 million to our local economy.\n\nConveniently located seven-minutes’ walk from the city centre, the Arena is favoured by events that pull big crowds. The 18-hectare site has a park-like feel and offers many indoor and outdoor venues for local and visiting events.\n\nThe oval at the stadium is home to the Manawatū Rugby Union, and in summer is used for international speedway.\n\nUpgrades enhance Arena experience\n\nThe effects of a 2018-2022 construction masterplan can be seen right from CET Arena’s “front door”, with a new entrance plaza, including bridge and digital screens, linking the Arena to Palmy central.\n\nPalmy’s iconic speedway has benefited through the relocation of the speedway pits. They’re more user-friendly for drivers and crews, as well as more visible to speedway spectators. These areas are dual purpose and able to host community activities, recently supporting MidCentral DHB’s vaccination drive.\n\nImprovements have also been made to the lighting, embankment seating and amenities spaces.\n\nThe back playing fields have also benefited from investment, with artificial turf installed to give a more versatile, \"always available\" playing surface for sporting codes.\n\nLocation"
