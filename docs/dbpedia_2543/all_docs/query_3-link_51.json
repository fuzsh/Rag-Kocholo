        "text": "I recently responded to well-known actor Raj Gopi (of Out of Bounds and Kandasamy fame, among others) regarding a comment he made on Facebook about the Paris Olympics being the worst on record.\n\nI thought I would share this with readers because it sums up my thoughts on Paris ’24.\n\nDear Raj, As a preamble, let me say that everybody has their own experiences and perspectives and we are all subjective.\n\nALSO READ | Analysis | Beers and KFC not good options at Paris ’24\n\nIn my case, this my fourth Games and to me, these Games have had the best venues I’ve seen by far — Roland Garros, Stade de France and that amazing beach volleyball venue outside the Eiffel, the Champions Park and many more.\n\nThe transport and accessibility was great.\n\nThe entertainment better than any other city.\n\nAnd it looks amazing with all these historic buildings, history and fan involvement.\n\nAnd I have experienced the VIP and regular man-in-the-street sides. I’ve botched a few train stops, but that’s me.\n\nALSO READ | SA Polocrosse team earn World Cup with nail-biting win over Australia\n\nAnd the weather’s currently as hot, if not hotter, than Durban.\n\nThe competition has been exceptional, with that amazing 100m (no race before with all competitors running under 10 seconds), the tennis (Novak’s final hurrah), golf (Scheffler’s come from behind is unparalleled) and Leon Marchant’s four golds.\n\nTeam SA has not fared well, but competition is tough and our guys have given it their all.\n\nEven the French are very hospitable, contrary to what we were told. I have to think hard to fault them. Oh, yes food and drinks are expensive, but we knew that.\n\nHowever, if you shop around you can find most things.\n\nI’m literally having a breyani now at a Bangladeshi restaurant for about R180.\n\nALSO READ | Woman and her ‘ordinary’ horse steal the show at Dundee July\n\nIf I stayed in my hotel, an ordinary pizza would be R250 and a beer R200.\n\nAlso, I have cycled the Paris CBD easily with three 17-year-old nieces (yes, they’re triplets) and their dad — with no issues — to and from the Eiffel Tower (30km in one day).\n\nTo be honest, I haven’t seen any administrative glitches.\n\nI know there’s controversy about boxer Imane Khelif, but let the international sports arbitration bodies or courts deal with this as there are lots of technicalities, and to be honest, I don’t trust the Russian IBA.\n\nAlso, extremist groups do look for controversy.\n\nI’m pretty religious and if I scoured Paris, there would be many things I could criticise, but I realise that art and religion and politics don’t always mix.\n\nALSO READ | Analysis | If you don’t throw, then you won’t know\n\nAnd especially in Paris, the city of enlightenment and radical thought.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nFor me, Paris has been fantastic and great for the fans and athletes.\n\nTo me, that’s what counts."
