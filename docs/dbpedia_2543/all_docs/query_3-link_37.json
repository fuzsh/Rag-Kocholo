There are over 300 car parks on site with an additional 1,800 overflow parks within easy walking distance, in the surrounding area.\n\nFor everyday use, you will likely find a park within the grounds. With major events we are often able to use the additional parking at the nearby Te Pai Netball Centre which is also within easy walking distance.\n\nBuses can also use the internal loop that allows them to enter the grounds at one gate, disembark passengers and then leave by a different gate without having to turn. Buses entering from the Lincoln Road end use the bus stops right outside the main doors."
