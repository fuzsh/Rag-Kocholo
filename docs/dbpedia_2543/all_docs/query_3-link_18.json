        "text": "State Sport Centres – Parkville is one of Australia’s premier sporting venues offering sporting facilities and programs from grass roots to high-performance, international and Olympic level athletes.\n\nMore than 500,000 people a year play or watch netball, hockey and other events at the centre, with over 80 per cent of its users being female. The recently completed SNHC project provides more opportunities for women of all ages to get active and strive for the best, on and off the courts. The redevelopment had a strong focus on women and girls in sport which will kick start initiatives to drive change and grow female leadership in sport.\n\nVENUE HISTORY\n\nIn 1996 the Royal Park Master Plan was prepared by the City of Melbourne. Under the plan the existing State Netball Centre would be demolished and integrated with the State Hockey Centre.\n\nIn May 1998 funding for the project was announced at $24.5 million and in 1999 a revised budget of $27m was agreed. The approval for the Centre was fast-tracked so it could be assessed by the 2006 Commonwealth Games Evaluations Panel and in mid-1999 construction began. Construction was completed in November 2000, and the facility was officially opened on 16 March 2001.\n\nIn 2021, the SNHC project was completed, which provides more opportunities for women of all ages to get active and strive for the best, on and off the courts. The redevelopment will also establish the Women in Sport Leadership Centre, which will kick start initiatives to drive cultural change and grow female leadership in sport through representation. The major focus of the investment waslevelling the playing field for girls and women.\n\nThe $64.6 million SNHC project has delivered the following:\n\n• 6 new indoor netball courts to replace the current 4 outdoor courts, bringing the total number of netball courts to 11\n\n• A new indoor hockey facility to support the new and emerging sport of indoor hockey\n\n• A high-performance strength and conditioning gym\n\n• The Women in Sport Leadership Centre\n\n• Sports House 2 – modelled on ‘Sports House’ at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre, and providing a home for the peak sporting bodies Netball Victoria and Hockey Victoria\n\n• Upgrades to amenity and infrastructure including: the development of a new front entrance, providing for improved circulation and improving access to local public transport.\n\nMelbourne Sports Centres – Parkville was re-opened by Minister for Tourism, Sport and Major Events Martin Pakula on Wednesday 14 July 2021."
