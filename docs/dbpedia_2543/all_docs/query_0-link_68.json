        "text": "England welcome back experienced players and take on familiar rivals as they prepare to face Australia, New Zealand and Uganda in the Nations Cup.\n\nEach nation will face each other once, with matches played on 20-21 January at Wembley's OVO Arena and 27 January at Leeds' First Direct Arena, culminating in a final on Sunday, 28 January.\n\nEngland will first take on Uganda before facing 12-time world champions Australia in a repeat of last year's World Cup final.\n\nThey then play world number two side New Zealand before competing in either the final or third-place play-off.\n\nLive radio commentary on all of England's matches will be available on Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.\n\nHere are the key things to look out for.\n\nStar shooter Helen Housby and mid-court engine Natalie Metcalf are back in the England squad for the first time since winning a historic silver in Cape Town last year.\n\nThe experienced pair sat out recent series against New Zealand and South Africa as head coach Jess Thirlby afforded several World Cup players an extended break.\n\nMetcalf, who has 82 England caps, co-captained the Roses to a first World Cup final last summer along with Layla Guscoth while Housby was named player of the tournament.\n\nThis competition will provide an opportunity for Housby to take developing goal attack Berri Neil under her wing as Sasha Glasgow, who switched allegiance from Australia to play for England, continues to try to fill the gap left by 117-cap shooter Jo Harten, who retired from international netball last year.\n\nJust six of the 12-strong squad who represented England at the World Cup remain involved after wing attack Chelsea Pitman retired and most-capped player Jade Clarke is not included as Thirlby instead looks to develop her youthful team.\n\n\"This Nations Cup will be another step up and brilliant test for our young, talented squad,\" said Thirlby.\n\n\"This has been one of the hardest selections since coming into the role, testament to the players who continue to push themselves and each other, and a healthy sign of the progress being made to ensure we have a continual pipeline of talent prepared to do the work and set us up for more success both now and in the years to come.\"\n\nDefender Fran Williams has been named as captain for the Nations Cup, having enjoyed a successful stint leading the Roses' in their 2-1 series win over South Africa in December.\n\n\"There's a bit more expectation on myself this time - because now I've done it once and we had success, I want to go up another level with this group,\" Williams told BBC Sport.\n\nThe 26-year-old has skirted around the fringe of the squad in recent years but cemented her status as one of the nation's best defenders at last summer's World Cup.\n\n\"Responsibility goes up again as we take on more of the world's best nations,\" she said. \"I can't wait for the challenge.\n\n\"There's no better challenge than the world's number one and two and the exciting team that is Uganda who are challenging everyone.\"\n\nStrength and leadership in defence is paramount for Williams following the retirement of veteran defender Geva Mentor after the World Cup and Guscoth's decision to take a break from the sport this year.\n\nShe will bring experience to a young defensive line-up, which includes Halimat Adio and Funmi Fadoju along with Razia Quashie, who has been involved in England squads sporadically in recent years.\n\nAustralia have long been the dominant force in world netball and the reigning world and Commonwealth champions will be looking to exert their authority once again.\n\nIt will be the first time world number ones Australia have faced England, ranked third in the world, since the World Cup final last summer.\n\nNew Zealand come into the tournament still stinging after failing to win a medal at the World Cup for the first time in their history.\n\nThe Roses beat the Silver Ferns in the semi-final in Cape Town before Jamaica prevailed in the bronze-medal match.\n\nMeanwhile, it is Uganda's first time in a series against the world's top nations and, after a historic fifth-place finish at the World Cup, they will look to cause further upsets on the world stage.\n\nTheir unique playing style is full of flair and they come into the series with confidence after a 2-1 series win over Wales in Cardiff last week."
