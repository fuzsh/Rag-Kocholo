Biography

Italian actress who first became known as the twin sister of film star Pier Angeli (Anna Maria Pierangeli) before achieving success in her own screen career.

When her father died in 1950, she and the family moved to Hollywood where her twin had already begun to make a mark in films. With a dark, gentle beauty, she was cast as an Indian in "Drum Beat," 1954 and an Israelite in "Solomon and Sheba," 1959. Her most famous role was in 1955 in "The Rose Tattoo," for which she was nominated as Best Supporting Actress. She did a great deal of work on TV and had a secondary career as a singer.

On 27 March 1956, Pavan married French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont in Santa Barbara, California, and the couple remained together until Jean-Pierre's death in 2001. They had two sons, Jean-Claude, born in 1957, and Patrick, in 1960.

On 10 September 1971, her twin sister committed suicide with a drug overdose. Marisa Pavan died on 6 December 2023 at the age of 91 at her home in Saint-Tropez, France.
