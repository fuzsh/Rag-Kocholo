        "text": "Last Updated on June 10, 2023\n\nTo help you celebrate Independence Day, we’ve made a list of movies and television mini-series to watch: you’ll find historical epics about our Founding Fathers, films about the Revolutionary War, and costume dramas set in the late 18th century in America, all perfect for watching over the Fourth of July.\n\nWhile many of these films are available to stream, others can only be found on DVD – or on TV – so once you’ve familiarized yourself with the titles, keep a look out for them to crop up on your channels.\n\nSome of these patriotic period dramas are more historically accurate than others, so if you are using these films for educational purposes about the 4th of July, you’ll want to read the notes and do a bit more research before taking them as factual representations of the nation’s beginnings.\n\nHappy Independence Day, America!\n\n1776 (1972)\n\nA musical retelling of the American Revolution’s political struggle in the Continental Congress to declare independence.\n\nThe nation’s fathers harmonize their way through the founding of America in this musical adapted from a popular Broadway show. Colonial representatives gather in Philadelphia with the aim of establishing a set of governmental rules for the burgeoning United States. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams charge Thomas Jefferson with the work of writing a statement announcing the new country’s emancipation from British rule.\n\nStarring William Daniels, Howard DaSilva, Ken Howard, Blythe Danner.\n\nRated 16+\n\nAvailable to STREAM\n\nThe Adams Chronicles (1976)\n\nWinner of four Emmys® and a Peabody, the thirteen-episode miniseries by PBS commemorating the American Bicentennial created a sensation when it debuted in 1976. Lauded by contemporary critics as “the best and highest-rated series in the history of American public television,” its vitality and historical integrity now prove timeless.\n\nThis lavish series dramatizes four generations of Adamses and 150 years of American history from the birth of the Revolution through the Gilded Age (1758 – 1893). You meet John Adams — passionate revolutionary and second president; John Quincy Adams — proud son of a famous father and sixth president; Charles Francis Adams — skillful minister to Great Britain during the Civil War; and Henry and Charles Francis Adams, Jr. — historian and railroad magnate, respectively.\n\nGoing well beyond politics, this television masterpiece portrays these men as husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons, as well as leaders. Based on the family’s personal diaries and correspondence, The Adams Chronicles not only educates as a true historical epic, but also captivates as a fully human family saga.\n\nStarring Tim Wilson, Michael O’Hare, Wesley Addy, David Birney, George Grizzard, William Daniels, Nicholas Pryor.\n\nNot rated\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nAll For Liberty (2009)\n\nIt is 1775. Henry Felder, a Swiss-German colonist, lives with his family in the British colony of South Carolina. After many years of struggling with corrupt British rulers, Felder is urged by the new patriot governor to write Articles of Separation from the English King. Felder’s old Indian fighting comrade forms a Tory militia to assist the Crown as the fight heats up.\n\nA historically accurate portrayal of the period and the story of one man’s willingness to stand up for his beliefs in order to protect his rights and freedom.\n\nStarring Clarence Felder, Michael Easler, Chris Weatherhead, Bettina Beard, Delfloria Brown, Richard Bryant.\n\nDove Foundation Family Seal of Approval for age 12+\n\nAvailable to STREAM\n\nA More Perfect Union: America Becomes a Nation (1989)\n\nAmerica, 1786, ten years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. England wages a new war of unfair trade and tariffs. Bickering and jealousy fracture the once united states. But a handful of brilliant men, James Madison, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin, lead a political battle to create a new form of government, one that will establish the standard of self-government to the world. A More Perfect Union: America Becomes A Nation is the first comprehensive recreation of those stirring, heated debates during the sweltering summer of 1787.\n\nFilmed on location at Independence Hall, Williamsburg, Virgina, and other historical sites, it dramatically chronicles how America became a nation and established those underlying principles that guard our freedoms today.\n\nStarring Craig Wasson, Michael McGuire, Fredd Wayne, Morgan White, Derryl Yeager, Scott Wilkinson, Ivan Crosland.\n\nDove Foundation Family Seal of Approval for age 12+\n\nAvailable to STREAM\n\nApril Morning (1988)\n\nOn the morning of April 19, 1775, the American Revolution began with the “shot heard ’round the world.” A Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.\n\nThis adaptation of the classic novel by Howard Feast takes place at the dawn of the American Revolution. Superstitious teenager Adam Cooper struggles to gain the approval of his intellectual and devout Christian father, Moses. When a lone rider warns the locals of approaching British troops, Adam surprises his father by joining the local militia. But Adam will have to come of age rapidly amid violence and death to survive the Battles of Lexington and Concord.\n\nStarring Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Urich, Chad Lowe, Susan Blakely, Meredith Salenger, Rip Torn, Joan Heney, Nicholas Kilbertus, Griffith Brewer.\n\nRated 13+\n\nCheck Availability\n\nThe Awakening Land (1978)\n\nUnschooled homesteader Sayward Luckett couldn’t read her name if you showed it to her, yet she fell in love with and married agnostic, book-learned frontier lawyer Portius Wheeler. Now it’s time to make a life with him in wild, wooded 1790s Ohio Territory.\n\nThere will be children, seven in all; joy and hardships aplenty; inconstancies of heart; and the enduring legacy of settling a new land. Based on Conrad Richter’s trilogy of novels (he received a Pulitzer Prize for the third), this three episode miniseries nominated for 6 Emmy Awards celebrates the pioneering spirit as it chronicles Sayward’s heroic, unadorned life.\n\nStarring Elizabeth Montgomery, Hal Holbrook, Jane Seymour, William H. Macy, Chelcie Ross, Steven Keats, Louise Latham.\n\nNot rated\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nBenedict Arnold: A Question of Honor (2003)\n\nThe gripping true story of one of America’s first military heroes and the greed and ambition that led his name to be synonymous with traitor.\n\nThe most sullied figure of the American Revolution receives partial redemption in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor. Produced for the A&E network, this factual drama reveals the lesser-known circumstances of Arnold’s dishonor, beginning in 1777 and chronicling his fall from greatness. The conquering hero of Saratoga and other victories of the Revolution finds himself in an impossible predicament, his allegiance torn between his British loyalist wife (Jane Brennan) and his paternally devoted commander, George Washington (Kelsey Grammer), as his Colonial detractors cast him into a tragic no-win scenario. Authentically detailed and blessed by playwright William Mastrosimone’s poetic period dialogue, Benedict Arnold successfully explores the personal and political facets of a great soldier’s downfall.\n\nAidan Quinn’s expressive melancholy perfectly suits his title role, and Grammer transcends Frasier, lending appropriate gravitas–and some physical resemblance–to his portrayal of America’s future president. Like A&E’s earlier film The Crossing, this is compelling historical drama, entertaining, intelligent, and emotionally complex. –Jeff Shannon\n\nStarring Aidan Quinn, Kelsey Grammer, Flora Montgomery, John Light, John Kavanagh.\n\nNot rated\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nCentennial (1978)\n\nThe economic and cultural growth of Colorado spanning two centuries from the mid-1700s to the late-1970s are depicted in this twelve-episode mini-series.

Based on the book by Howard Fast, The Crossing brings to life Washington’s historic passage across the Delaware on Christmas night, and the lopsided fight that followed.\n\nIn December 1776, the armies of General George Washington (Jeff Daniels) are near the point of collapse; short on money and supplies, ravaged by disease, their numbers thinned by desertion, and freezing in summer uniforms in the midst of a brutal winter, it seems all but impossible that the Colonial Army can hold out much longer against the British Army and their allied German Hessian forces. With imminent defeat a clear possibility, Washington and his troops organize for an audacious surprise attack against the British soldiers on Christmas Day, hinging on the crossing of the freezing Delaware River in the middle of a storm.\n\nStarring Jeff Daniels, Roger Rees, Sebastian Roché, Steven McCarthy, John Henry Canavan.\n\nNot rated, but suitable for 13+ and for those interested in using the film for teaching, there is a lesson plan available here (which points out the historical inaccuracies as well).\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nThe Devil’s Disciple (1987) BBC\n\nIn New Hampshire in 1777, Dick Dudgeon’s father dies. Called back home to the unhappy family he revolted against years ago, Dick finds he has been named heir, much to the horror of his religious mother. And to complicate matters, the British, led by General Burgoyne, have arrived and are readying for an execution. As events reach a crisis, Dick finds he must confront his true nature, as must the village minister.\n\nBased on the play by George Bernard Shaw.\n\nThe Devil’s Disciple is not generally considered one of George Bernard Shaw’s best plays, but it may be among his most enjoyable. In a New England village during the Revolutionary War, disreputable and self-proclaimed Devil’s disciple Richard Dudgeon finds himself inheriting the bulk of his father’s estate, much to the fury of his estranged mother (Elizabeth Spriggs, Sense and Sensibility). But when British soldiers mistake Dudgeon for the Reverend Anthony Anderson and arrest him as a rebel, Dudgeon goes along with the error and consents to be hanged in Anderson’s place–forcing Anderson’s wife Judith to decide whether to save a man she loathes at the cost of her husband’s life. The Devil’s Disciple starts slowly, but the tension mounts steadily, as does the humor. The courtroom debate between Dudgeon and the cynical General Burgoyne is rife with Shaw’s typical wit and paradoxes–but the rise of feeling between Dudgeon and Judith give the production an emotional kick many Shaw plays lack. –Bret Fetzer\n\nStarring Elizabeth Spriggs, Patrick Stewart, Cheryl Maiker, Graham Turner, Ian Richardson, Mike Gwilym, Susan Woolridge.\n\nNot rated\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nDrums Along the Mohawk (1939)\n\nClassic account of a Revolutionary War era farmer’s attempts to build a life for himself and his family in the mohawk valley.\n\nLawless frontier.

Beautiful young Virginian Jane (Martha Scott) steps down from her proper aristocratic upbringing when she marries down-to-earth surveyor Matt Howard (Grant). Deeply in love, they move to the backwoods and begin to raise their family. Major differences emerge, however, when the conservative Jane and her Tory father rebel against Matt’s staunch democratic ideals. Eventually, Matt joins the Colonial forces in the fight for freedom against England, and Jane and Matt are forced to choose between their love for each other and their political beliefs. Exciting and dramatic, The Howards of Virginia is a tumultuous tale of love and adventure.\n\nWith its straightforward retelling of events leading up to the American Revolution, The Howards of Virginia is a standard slice of patriotism from Hollywood’s golden age. Adapted by noted screenwriter Sidney Buchman from Elizabeth Page’s 1939 bestseller Tree of Liberty, this colonial melodrama is notorious for saddling Cary Grant with one of his most ill-fitting roles, and it’s true that Grant’s 20th-century style clashes with his portrayal of buckskinned rebel Matt Howard. Still, his performance is far from being “really bad” (as critic Pauline Kael harshly opined), and Martha Scott brings tenacious dignity to her role as Howard’s pragmatic wife, who defies her aristocratic family to join her new husband in the wilderness of Ohio. The stirrings of rebellion clash with some thankfully outmoded Hollywood clichés (such as Howard’s initial rejection of his mildly disabled son), but overall this remains a respectable and altogether engaging historical adventure, encompassing the early career of Thomas Jefferson and noteworthy for its meticulous attention to period detail. –Jeff Shannon\n\nStarring Cary Grant, Martha Scott, Cedric Hardwicke, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Marshal.\n\nNot rated\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nJanice Meredith / The Beautiful Rebel (1924)\n\nIt is 1774, the eve of the American War of Independence.

The miniseries also explores the extraordinary relationship between Adams and Abigail, his wife of 54 years, a partnership regarded as one of the most moving love stories in American history.\n\nAdapted from David McCullough’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, this lavish seven-part miniseries chronicles the life of Founding Father John Adams, starting with the Boston Massacre of 1770 through his years as an ambassador in Europe, then his terms as vice president and president of the United States, up to his death on July 4, 1826.\n\nAdams, second president of the United States, is portrayed as a skilled orator and principled attorney whose preference for justice over anti-English passions earns enemies. But he also gains the esteem of the first national government of the United States, i.e., the Continental Congress, which seeks non-firebrands capable of making a reasoned if powerful case for America’s break from England’s monarchy. The first thing one notices about John Adams’ dramatizations of congress’ proceedings, and the fervent pro-independence violence in the streets of Boston and elsewhere, is that America’s roots don’t look pretty or idealized here. Some horrendous things happen in the name of protest, driving Adams to push the cause of independence in a legitimate effort to get on with a revolutionary war under the command of George Washington. But the process isn’t easy: not every one of the 13 colonies-turned-states is ready to incur the wrath of England, and behind-the-scenes negotiations prove as much a part of 18th century congressional sessions as they do today.\n\nBesides this peek into a less-romanticized version of the past, John Adams is also a story of the man himself. Adams’ frustration at being forgotten or overlooked at critical junctures of America’s early development–sent abroad for years instead of helping to draft the U.S. constitution–is detailed. So is his dismay that the truth of what actually transpired leading to the signing of the Declaration of Independence has been slowly forgotten and replaced by a rosier myth. But above all, John Adams is the story of two key ties: Adams’ 54-year marriage to Abigail Adams (Laura Linney), every bit her husband’s intellectual equal and anchor, and his difficult, almost symbiotic relationship with Thomas Jefferson (Stephen Dillane) over decades. Giamatti, of course, has to carry much of the drama, and if he doesn’t always seem quite believable in the series’ first half, he becomes increasingly excellent at the point where an aging Adams becomes bitter over his place in history. Linney is marvelous, as is Dillane, Sarah Polley as daughter Nabby, Danny Huston as cousin Samuel Adams, and above all Tom Wilkinson as a complex but indispensable Ben Franklin. –Tom Keogh\n\nStarring Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, Stephen Dillane Tom Wilkinson, Danny Huston, David Morse, Sarah Polley, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Rufus Sewell, Justin Theroux, Guy Henry, Zeljko Ivanek.\n\nNot rated but in general should be suitable for older children.

The film authentically recreates Paul Revere’s ride, the Boston tea party, and decisive battles at Lexington and Concord.\n\n“This Walt Disney filmization of Esther Forbes’ Revolutionary-War novel Johnny Tremain was appropriately released on July 4, 1957. New Disney discovery Hal Stalmaster plays the title character, an apprentice silversmith in 1773 Boston. An on-the-job injury prevents Johnny from finding a job, but he is welcomed with open arms at the headquarters of the Revolution. After standing trial on a trumped-up robbery charge brought about by British sympathizer Jonathan Lyte (Sebastian Cabot), Johnny is set free, whereupon he joins the Sons of Liberty during their execution of the Boston Tea Party. Later on, General Gage (Ralph Clanton), the officer in charge of the colonies, does his best to stem the activities of the Sons of the Liberty without resorting to violence but this becomes a moot point after the battle of Lexington Green. If the storyline of Johnny Tremain seems to be divided into two even halves, it is because the film was originally intended as a two-part installment of the Disneyland TV anthology. As it turned out, the film did receive TV exposure on Walt Disney Presents, divided (as planned) into two segments: “The Boston Tea Party” (first telecast November 21, 1958) and “The Shot That Was Heard Around the World” (December 5, 1958).” – Rotten Tomatoes\n\nStarring Hal Stalmaster, Luana Patten, Jeff York, Sebastian Cabot, Richard Beymer, Rusty Lane, Walter Sande, Whit Bissell, Walter Coy.\n\nRated PG\n\nAvailable to STREAM\n\nJohn Paul Jones (1959)\n\nThe Scottish-born U.S. naval officer becomes a Revolutionary War hero and falls in love with a French noblewoman.\n\nThis expansive spectacle chronicles the adventures and life of the title 18th century naval hero who played a key role in the Revolutionary War.

Left to fend for herself and their children as she sought her husband’s release, Mary Silliman’s story presents the War for Independence in a way that is fresh and engaging to a modern audience. Mary Silliman’s War was produced by Heritage Films, under the auspices of The Institute for Early American History in Colonial Williamsburg, VA. It is based on the biography by Richard and Joy Day Buel, The Way of Duty: A Woman and Her Family in Revolutionary America.\n\nThe American Historical Association writes that “Mary Silliman’s War also provides a remarkably persuasive—and long overdue—representation of a civilian experience of the Revolutionary War. It focuses on one rural community of colonial Americans—in a world that was indeed immediate and local—rather than on the distant military events of the Continental Army or the political concerns of the Continental Congress. That local focus helps to make the variety of political, economic, and social decisions that confronted individual Americans like Mary Silliman and her neighbors more palpable, and illustrates the extent to which the revolutionary conflict affected the lives of ordinary civilians, their families, and their communities.” You can read more about the film here.\n\nStarring Nancy Palk, Richard Donat, Diane D’Aquila, Joanne Miller, Allan Royal.\n\nNot rated\n\nCheck Availability\n\nThe Patriot (2000)\n\nIn 1776 South Carolina, widower and legendary war hero Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) finds himself thrust into the midst of the American Revolutionary War as he helplessly watches his family torn apart by the savage forces of the British Redcoats.

Fighting to protect his family’s freedom and his country’s independence, Martin discovers the pain of betrayal, the redemption of revenge and the passion of love.\n\n“A fable arguing the futility of pacifism, set against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War. It basically wants to be a summer action movie, with a historical gloss. At that, it succeeds. I enjoyed the strength and conviction of Gibson’s performance, the sweep of the battle scenes, and the absurdity of the British caricatures.
