        "text": "LITTLE ROCK — The Arkansas Health Department has decided to issue amended birth certificates for children of same-sex couples who can prove they were married before the child was born.\n\nHealth Department spokesman Meg Mirivel said Monday that the department reviewed an order from Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Tim Fox and decided to amend those specific birth certificates starting last Friday. Fox issued a ruling striking down a portion of the state's birth certificate law and said Arkansas must amend the birth certificates, listing both spouses as parents.\n\nAttorney General Leslie Rutledge has asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to stay that ruling pending her office's appeal.\n\nThe department had agreed to amend the certificates for the children of the three couples who sued, but had turned away other same-sex couples before Friday."
