        "text": "TV producer Norman Lear and actress Marisa Pavan called it a wrap before the New Year’s party starts, at ages 101 and 91, respectively! Lear is perhaps the most influential sitcom creator and developer of all time, responsible for such shows as All in the Family, The Jeffersons, One Day at a Time, Maude, Good Times, Sanford and Son, and Diff’rent Strokes, and continued making television straight up to the present day, winning his final Emmy in 2020 for the Live in Front of a Studio Audience remakes of his classic shows. In 1968, he wrote the screenplay for Divorce American Style and was nominated for an Oscar, as was actress Pavan some thirteen years earlier for her work in The Rose Tattoo, for which she did manage to win a Golden Globe. Her twin sister Pier Angeli is possibly better remembered for her torrid relationship with James Dean, while Pavan put together a better acting resume, including roles in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit, Solomon and Sheba, The Midnight Story, and What Price Glory, along with later guest spots on Wonder Woman and Hawaii Five-0.\n\nKristin M. takes over the deaths lead, picking up at least 14 for the third year in a row, only the third time that’s been achieved (along with Sarah and Dondos). This inches her closer to second overall with yet another All-Years Draftee departing in the last month on Lear, while Bats moves up a spot in the overall with his fifth of the year on Pavan, only taken the last five years (Kristin M, Dondos, Sean, and Bats the past two). Lear’s seventeen years in the pool were on remarkably few teams – the commish in ’07 & ’08, Munchak from 2009 to 2018, and Kristin ever since. Well done, folks!"
