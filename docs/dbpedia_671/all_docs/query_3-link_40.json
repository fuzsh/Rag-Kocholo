Maria is, of course, in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Latin: Maria), a figure hugely important in the Catholic-dominated countries of Italy, Spain and Portugal (not to mention Latin America). Luisa is the feminine form of Luis, which is the Spanish equivalent of Louis (Louise is the English female version). Luis comes from the Germanic personal name Ludwig which means “famous warrior” from the elements “hlud” (fame) and “wig” (warrior). Marisa could also be the combination of Maria and Lisa, Lisa being a diminutive for Elisabetta in Italy. In the Christian New Testament Elizabeth (which means “God is my oath”) was the mother of John the Baptist and Catholic tradition holds she and Mary were cousins. So Marisa could be the marriage of two of the most important female names (Mary/Elizabeth or Maria/Lisa) in the New Testament – for religious Catholics, this is quite significant. English-speakers use this name too, although they usually throw in another “s” as in Marissa. Today, Marisa is most popular in the Portuguese speaking nation of Brazil. It is also relatively common among Hispanic and/or Italian Americans.\n\nAll About the Baby Name – Marisa\n\nPersonality\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME MARISA\n\nThe number Seven personality is deeply mystical and highly in tune with their spirituality. They operate on a different wavelength than the average joe. Spending time alone comes easily to Sevens, as it gives them time to contemplate philosophical, religious and spiritual ideas in an effort to find \"real truth\". Sevens are wise, but often exude mystery as if they are tapped into something the rest of us don't understand. They love the outdoors and are fed by nature. Sevens are constantly seeking to understand human nature, our place in the universe, and the mystery of life in general. This makes them quite artistic and poetic, but they are also keen observers with high intellect - so they are equally scientific-minded. Sevens are charitable and care deeply about the human condition.\n\nPopularity\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME MARISA\n\nMarisa dates back to 1956 on the U.S. female naming charts. In fact, in 1956 Marisa debuted at position #533 out of 1000 right out of the gate. Usually names inch onto the charts, but Marisa came on with a bit of a splash. Why? At the end of 1955 a film was released (The Rose Tattoo – based on a Tennessee Williams play) starring a young Italian-American actress Marisa Pavan. The pretty young actress was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and American movie audiences were introduced to her name on a larger scale. The name saw another little bump in usage in 1966 when iconic actor John Wayne named his daughter Marisa (with his Peruvian wife Pilar Pallete). Marisa continued to climb the charts during the 1970s and 80s as the Hispanic-American population grew (it has done particularly well in the states of Hawaii and New Mexico). It reached a high point at position #167 on the charts in 1977 (not quite a Top 150, but awfully close). Then Marisa reached her second peak in 1994-1995 when the name got even higher at #146 (her best ever) – this time influenced by the very talented and likable Italian-American actress Marisa Tomei. Since the mid-1990s, however, Marisa has been declining in usage. Her drops on the charts have become even more pronounced since 2005. This is a name fast going out of style. Not even Victoria's Secret Angel and gorgeous Sports Illustrated swimsuit supermodel Marisa Miller can revive it. Regardless, this is definitely a pretty name for a pretty girl.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nON MARISA\n\nGENDER:\n\nGirl\n\nORIGIN:\n\nItalian\n\nNUMBER OF SYLLABLES:\n\n3\n\nRANKING POPULARITY:\n\n976\n\nPRONUNCIATION:\n\nmə-RIS-ə\n\nSIMPLE MEANING:\n\nMaria+Lisa (or Luisa)\n\nCharacteristics\n\nOF MARISA\n\nMystical\n\nWise\n\nEccentric\n\nIntuitive\n\nImaginative\n\nPhilosophical\n\nSolitary\n\nCultural References to the Baby Name – Marisa\n\nLiterary Characters\n\nOF THE BABY NAME MARISA\n\nWe cannot find any significant literary characters by the name of Marisa\n\nChildrens Books\n\nON THE BABY NAME MARISA\n\nWe cannot find any childrens books with the first name Marisa\n\nPopular Songs\n\nON MARISA\n\nMarisa\n\na song by Daveâ€™s True Story\n\nFamous People\n\nNAMED MARISA\n\nMarisa Tomei (actress)\n\nMarisa Miller (supermodel)\n\nMarisa Monte (Brazilian pop-star)\n\nMarisa Berenson (actress)\n\nMarisa Paredes (Spanish actress)\n\nMarisa Merlini (Italian actress)\n\nMarisa Pavan (Italian-American actress)\n\nChildren of Famous People\n\nNAMED MARISA\n\nWe cannot find any children of famous people with the first name Marisa\n\nHistoric Figures\n\nWITH THE NAME MARISA\n\nWe cannot find any historically significant people with the first name Marisa"
