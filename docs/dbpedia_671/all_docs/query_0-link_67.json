And, as anyone who's ever been around cameramen knows, that means considerable waiting, sometimes. HER COLORING is what's important, but so are her features and the way they are put together by nature. That is what makes her so valuable. So maybe you expected a carrot-topped gal with purple eyes? At first glance, you might say, \"Well, what makes her so special?\" She has brown hair, brown eyes, red lips, and an alabaster white skin that flushes to the palest pink .\n\nMarilyn's skin is her fortune you may be assured she takes care of it. A blotch on the cheek, a tiny pimple on the nose, which might irritate any woman, would be a tragedy for her. Temporarily, at least She doesn't credit her beauty to a slew of creams. She doesn't sit in front of a mirror trying a variety of beauty aids. She wears a little makeup a bit of eyeliner, a touch of lipstick, and, when the cameramen focus on her, a light film of powder to avoid any possibility of shine .\n\nShe credits her beauty to a balanced diet, and an Italian mother and Irish father. She looks \"just right\" so far as coloring is concerned. So when the cameramen get a picture on the screen that looks just like her, they know they're ready to get the show on the road. Her ideal complexion puts her into position to get many calls for TV commercials. It helps her that she has pretty hands and feet and a fine figure .\n\nMISS GREY puffs ciga-rets, polishes pianos, and offers her TV \"husband\" a stomach remedy with 12:10 Views the Press 2 12:15 Picture for Sunday 2 \"I Was a Male War Bride,\" with Cary Grant, Ann Sheridan, and Marion Marshal.

Our Miss Brooks enough regularity that she spends eight hundred dollars a year on taxis rushing from job to job .\n\nBut how did she get that way? Well, she's had a lot of TV experience in many areas. She used to do an interview show in Philadelphia where she chatted with celebrities from Pearl Buck to Hermione Gingold. She did a weather show on WRCV, Philadelphia and, later, a similar one for WPIX, the New York Daily News TV station. She's done a lot of work on the NBC-TV Today show. A decade ago she was a fashion writer for the Revere Journal in Massachusetts, and worked for the Boston Post .\n\nSubsequently she entered Staley college and holds a B. A. degree from that institution. Marilyn is having a great deal of fun and making a lot of money. But she's not the first color girl NBC-TV ever had and she won't be the last .\n\nShe thinks of marriage as \"the ultimate fulfillment\" and she is looking for a man with character and depth who thinks \"I'm the greatest thing since 7-Up\" and wants seven kids or more. Gentlemen if you qualify the line forms at the right.

Scenes \"The Defeat of the Spanish Armada,\" a special at 2:30 Admiral Howard to do to defeat the enemy. This was no small task for one man, but Vicas has performed far more extraordinary feats. He has attacked a castle in Avignon with flaming arrows, set fires to the great wall of the Kremlin, and recreated a plague from the Crusades .\n\nHe admits to not being basically destructive, but has done all these things in the name of art and history, and for NBC-TV specials. 6iTU THE 16th century,\" he said in a telephone interview, \"the struggle for world dominance lay between England and Spain, and the clash for power pinpointed two of the world's most important historical personali- GETTING GEORGE Vi-cas, head of NBC-TV news European productions, to talk about how he defeated the entire Spanish Armada single-handedly, and with very little trouble, was very little trouble for us. The original defeat of the Spanish Armada took place in 1588 when the Spanish force, the largest naval fleet ever assembled at that time, was defeated by the British navy, one-third their size. The results of Vicas' work will be described in \"The Defeat of the Spanish Armada,\" a special at 2:30 p. m .\n\ntoday on channel 5. Vicas' assignment was to do what it had taken several hundred British flagships and such notable commanders as Sir Francis Drake and Lord SUNDAY AlrVa C-UOICES ties Philip II of Spain and Queen Elizabeth I of England. \"Philip, the autocratic and despotic ruler of Spain, had initiated the Spanish Inquisition and long desired to conquer England, restore it to the Catholic faith, and make himself king. He ordered the greatest fleet of ships ever assembled to be built for the THEY SAID IT p. m .\n\ntoday on channel 5. \"We had the frame of the galleon mounted on an old Italian gunboat of World War II vintage, then sailed the gunboat-galleon around Lake Garda in Italy,\" he said. \"The frame was finally blown off to duplicate the battle of the Armada that took place over 350 years ago along the English channel. \"Soldiers for the show included 'recruits' from the nearby Italian villages. After they were hired, I still felt we didn't have enough people for an Armada, and used members of my filming staff to fill in the gaps one of our cameramen was an admiral of the fleet.\" Vicas tries to insure the historical accuracy of every inch of filming .\n\nHe usually works on a budget of $100,000 per film and has a staff of eight to handle the extensive research necessary for such programs as the Armada. When Sir Francis Drake and other English admirals were called upon to defend England from the \"invin- 1 cible\" Armada, history tells us it was a dangerous task filled with many perils. When Vicas was assigned to defeat the Armada, it was purpose of invading England.\" Vicas went on to explain that the defeat of the Armada has traditionally been considered the greatest stroke of luck in history. The battle was said to be influenced by winds causing the heavy Spanish ships, unfamiliar with the English coast, to sink. \"Philip, backed by Pope Sixtus had invested millions in the Armada,\" said Vicas .\n\n\"But he failed to provide weatherly ships, an experienced commander, and neglected to consider the elements. \"Our special will show that the problem was to work a heavy fleet of rather unsea-worthy ships from Spain up the English channel and then wait off Gravelines for the very rare coincidence of a spring tide, the rise of a light easterly breeze, and the absence of an enemy fleet.\" VICAS, a multilingual Harvard graduate, is a perfectionist when it comes to historical details for his sets. For the Armada special, he constructed a three-masted galleon with intricate carvings, an exact reproduction of a Spanish galleon, circa 1588. WEEF Rages, Stamps, and Blues.
