        "text": "This is a 1958 Lydia Lane article. Enjoy!\n\nWhen Marisa Pavan came to Hollywood she was unhappy. She didn’t speak English too well, she missed her friends in Italy and the people she met here thought of her only as Pier Angeli’s sister. But the other day when we lunched together, Marisa was radiantly happy. We talked about her husband, Jean-Pierre Aumont, and their son Jean. I commented on the contrast between her life and outlook now and the first time we’d met. And Marisa said with deep feeling: “Like a flower blooms in the sunshine, a girl responds to love. It is the prime beauty secret. Happiness Gives Beauty to a Face “There is nothing that gives beauty to a face or -unfolds personality like happiness. In many ways these few years have been wonderful for me. “Working with Anna Magnani and Tennessee Williams’ (referring to the motion picture, “The Rose Tattoo” for which she received an Academy Award nomination) was a great exigence. It was a privilege to be in the presence of such talent and greatness.” As she spoke of her husband her eyes sparkled. “Because of the differences in our years, Jean felt I should wait a little longer to know him better” she said. “But I fell in love with him, and I knew he was the right person for me. This was my happiness. “1 have always felt more or less grownup. As a child I had a feeling of responsibility to myself, and this, I believe, is a sign of maturity. I wanted to develop a mind of my own, to become capable of making my own decisions and to face my mistakes. So much unhappiness is caused by not facing our own mistakes.” “With an altitude like yours, we’d have no delinquent youth,” I remarked. “What did you feel was the biggest thing you had to overcome?”\n\n“I have always been much too critical of myself,” Marisa said quickly, “this resulted in a lack of self-assurance which I’ve been trying to overcome. A negative attitude toward yourself is destructive, and it lacks charm. “Charm is a word that is often misused. It docs not belong to things but to people. It is a variable quality a person you like has charm for you. It is a form of pleasantness that can’t be turned off and on. True charm is always there.” I asked Marisa if living in Paris had made her more fashion-conscious. “I love clothes especially those of the Italian Designer Antonelli,” she replied. “I try to attend the showings in Paris, but I find the French couturiers do not design for my type. Their clothes are too sophisticated and elaborate for me. The possible exception is Hubert de Givenchy, who has a youthful outlook. “You must feel what type you are. I like simple things. I look ‘much better without ‘make-up. I have dark lashes and don’t need mascara, and I wear a very light shade of lipstick. I know the glamour tricks but I don’t often use them.” The waitress brought Marisa a minute steak and spinach. “Remember how overweight I used to be?” she reminded me. “That was when I was unhappy. How I struggled to get thin!” “The more I talk with people,” I said, “the more I realize the importance of the mental side of dieting.”\n\n“I have no problem any more,” Marisa said. “I gave up all Italian foods that I loved the olive oil, the pasta, those rich .sauces and began eating the American way grilled foods, lots of salad, fresh fruits, green vegetables. And I don’t miss them.” “Your figure is adorable now,” I remarked. “I worked to get it this way,” Marisa said. “When I was under contract to Fox I wanted to be thinner, so every morning and every night I exercised for 45 minutes. “I had three favorite exercises for my hips, my stomach and my waist. You don’t have to go to a gym to lose weight. You can get results at home.” I wanted to know more about this routine and asked her to elaborate. Exercise Explained for Reduction of Hips “For my hips,” Marisa said, “I sat on the floor with my legs out in front. Using the palms of my hands for balance, I rocked side to side. You can roll the inches away like this! – “For my waist, I stood up and stretched my arms out from my sides. Then I twisted and bent over to touch the back of my left heel with my right hand and then reversed the procedure. I did this exercise 100 times. But if you aren’t used to exercising, I would advise working up to this gradually. “And for my tummy, I lay flat on the floor, raised my legs up in the air and lowered them very slowly. Just before they touched the floor I raised them again. I did this 100 times in a series of 10, taking a breather in between. “If you want to lose inches in the right places, you have to be consistent and work at it every day.”"
