        "text": "LITTLE ROCK — Arkansas health officials say they'll issue amended birth certificates for the children of three married same-sex couples who sued the state but are holding off on issuing them to other gay couples.\n\nOne of the three couples was issued a certificate Wednesday listing both spouses as parents, and a spokesman said the Health Department will issue amended certificates to the other two couples in the case.\n\nA state judge ordered the state Tuesday to issue the amended certificates. He also struck down a portion of the state birth certificate law, a move that the plaintiffs' attorney says clears the way for other same-sex couples to receive amended certificates.\n\nAttorney General Leslie Rutledge's office said Wednesday it's appealing the judge's decision to the state Supreme Court.\n\nRead Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details."
