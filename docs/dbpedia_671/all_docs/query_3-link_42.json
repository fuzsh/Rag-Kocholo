I’m grateful for my past, for what I went through during the war … I’d say we were strong, definitely not weak.”\n\nAlthough by nature an understated observer, that inner steel, which she found American girls her age did not have, stood her in good stead in the 1950s as she made her name in Hollywood films such as The Rose Tattoo.\n\nIt later enabled her to stand up to studio executives and to overcome the death of her fraternal twin, Anna Maria. Under the stage name Pier Angeli, she had become much the bigger star of the two, not least as the girlfriend"
