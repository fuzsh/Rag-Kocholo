        "text": "Born. To Marisa Pavan, 27, cinemactress (The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit), twin sister of Cinemactress Pier Angeli; and Jean Pierre Aumont, 49, French cinemactor (The Seventh Sin): their second son; in Santa Monica, Calif. Name: Patrick. Weight: 7 Ibs. 12 oz.\n\nBorn. To Claire Bloom, 28, brunette British beauty of stage (Rashomon) and screen (Richard III); and Rod Steiger, 34, Methodical bad man of stage and screen (Cry Terror): their first child, a daughter; in Hollywood. Weight: 8 lbs.\n\nDied. Dorothy Wyndham Paget, 54, onetime British debutante who gave up sports-car racing for horse breeding, in her lifetime spent close to $10 million (from a horsecar and trolley fortune inherited from her grandfather William C. Whitney, Secretary of the Navy in Grover Cleveland’s Cabinet), saddled the winners of 1,532 races, including the peerless Golden Miller, winner of the Grand National in 1934; of a heart attack; in Chalfont St. Giles, England.\n\nDied. Igor V. Kurchatov, 57, Soviet physicist who began tentative nuclear studies in the 1930s, ended up directing the fierce-driving organization that produced the Soviet atomic bomb in 1949, the hydrogen bomb in 1953; of a heart attack; in Moscow. The first Soviet atomic explosion came as a shock to the West largely because it was ignorant of the years of preparation of Kurchatov and his colleagues. Kurchatov, in fact, boasted that Russia invented the first real hydrogen bomb, since the thermonuclear device exploded earlier by the U.S. was too large to serve as a weapon.\n\nDied. Jennie Goldstein, 64, actress in the Yiddish theater for 57 years (Slaves of Luxury, Should a Mother Tell?), revered by her fans as the “Ethel Barrymore of Second Avenue”; of a heart attack; in Manhattan.\n\nDied. Walter Hubert Baddeley, 65, Anglican Bishop of Blackburn, who as a missionary in the South Seas (Bishop of Melanesia) during World War II bundled his charges on Florida Island (in the Solomons) off to the hills when the Japanese arrived, set up a leaf hut as his episcopal seat and ran a hospital and leper colony until the Americans landed; in Clayton-le-Dale, England.\n\nDied. Robert Edwin (“Bobby”) Clark, 71, comedian who convulsed audiences for decades by his frantic pace, greasepainted eyeglasses, a cigar that was sometimes in his mouth, sometimes flying through the air, a leer that “lit up the whole theater”; livened the dated comedies of Sheridan and Congreve with such earthy humor that critics acclaimed him the “funniest clown in the world”; of a heart attack; in Manhattan. After struggling to the top through the rich medium of vaudeville, circus, burlesque, Bobby ad-libbed through a series of revivals that were not worth reviving without him. In Victor Herbert’s Sweethearts, he confided to the audience: “Never was a thin plot so complicated.” When informed in Moliere’s The Would-Be Gentleman that the alphabet is divided into vowels and consonants, he rejoined: “That’s only fair.” A master of low comedy, Bobby brought craftsmanship to roles great and small. His favorite dramatist: Shakespeare, because “the clowns never get killed.”\n\nDied. Major General Oscar von Hindenburg, 77, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg’s son, who influenced his father, when President of Germany, to come to terms with Hitler’s National Socialists, as a reward was permitted to gobble up land tax-free in East Prussia; in Bad Harzburg, West Germany.\n\nDied. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, 79, architect of some of Britain’s handsomest buildings (including the restored House of Commons), who, though a Roman Catholic, designed the Anglican Cathedral at Liverpool, over a lifetime watched it go up but did not live to see it finished; in London.\n\nDied. Ernst von Dohnanyi, 82, Hungarian composer whose works (Suite in F-Sharp Minor, Variations on a Nursery Song) hewed closely to the style of 19th century romanticism; in Manhattan.\n\nDied. Betsy, 9, chimpanzee, whose speedily created (a dozen in half an hour) abstract finger paintings were compared with the works of de Kooning, fetched a total price of $4,500, received a stinging rebuke from Soviet Culture: “It is the most shining example of the decay of bourgeois art”; after a broken leg suffered when her mate (purchased, ironically, with the proceeds from sales of her paintings) tumbled on her at the zoo; in Baltimore."
