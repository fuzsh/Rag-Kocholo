After all, if it can be shown that consistent patterns of bias exist in the choices Hollywood studio executives make with respect to the movies they produce and release, as well as in the specific content of those movies, and that same bias is not reflected in our general population, it becomes obvious that Hollywood is selectively portraying reality, and that moviegoers only have limited options among all of the possibilities that could be portrayed on the silver screen. Thus, the moviegoers themselves could not possibly be significantly influencing such executive-level motion picture choices, since they have never been given the freedom to choose from a comprehensive slate of possibilities. One body of films that provides an excellent opportunity to explore the question of whether Hollywood movies exhibit certain patterns of bias is that entire body of work referred to as “biopics,” (i.e., motion picture biographies). The Hollywood biopics are particularly suited for such a study, because there can be little pre-selection by a film industry observer as to which films are to be included in the research sample (i.e., the studio executives and filmmakers themselves have already decided which subjects they deemed worthy of a film biography). Thus, once these films are isolated, they can be examined to determine if there seems to be a Hollywood preference for certain types of people, (e.g., political liberals as opposed to conservatives, Europeans as opposed to people from other parts 1\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nof the globe, recent immigrants to the U.S. versus those whose families have been in the U.S. for longer periods of time, people with a Jewish heritage as opposed to those who do not have a Jewish heritage, and so forth). This book builds upon the earlier work of George F. Custen, who in 1992 published a study of Hollywood biopics under the title Bio/Pics—How Hollywood Constructed Public History. Custen’s book clearly illustrated that a Hollywood slant on history is apparent from viewing that particular body of films.1 Custen’s study reviewed “291 biopics produced by the major studios and independent production companies during the period 1927–1960.”2 This work is a follow-up to the Custen study. It attempts to extend the time period covered by the study of motion picture biographies, to include more recent biopics (through the early ’90s) and to raise additional important questions not pursued (i.e., avoided) by Custen. This current study includes synopses or reviews for 443 such films released during the period from 1912 through 1994.* As Custen points out, some “characteristics of the films . . . are available without a close viewing of the particular film.”3 Of course, the flip side of that statement is that some characteristics of the biopics cannot be determined without viewing the films.** Thus, since neither Custen’s nor this study of Hollywood biopics can claim to have viewed each of the films in the study, these reports should not be considered the final word on this subject, (i.e., there is room for more work to be done in this area). Specifically, it is not always clear as to whether a particular portrayal is positive or negative when merely reading reviews or synopses of films, although in most instances, that editorial slant can be ascertained. This more current biopic study included a review of synopses of most of the films in the Custen study in addition to other biopics identified for the years 1961 through 1994. Seventeen (17) of the films listed at Appendix C of the Custen book were not described in synopsis form by Custen, Martin, Scheuer, or Walker (the primary sources for this study). Thus, those films are not included in this analysis, for most purposes. For the benefit of future researchers writing on this topic, those omitted films include Jesse James (Paramount–1927), Madame Pompadour (Paramount–1927), Kit Carson (Paramount–1928), The Viking (MGM–1928), The Royal Box (Warner Bros.–1929), The Devine Lady (Warner Bros.–1929), The Mad Empress (Warner Bros.–1939), The Star Maker (Paramount–1939), The Flying Irishman (RKO–1939), The Hamilton Woman (UA–1941), The Return of Daniel Boone (Columbia–1941), Song of My Heart (Allied Artists–1948), Davy Crockett, Indian Scout (UA–1950), Young Daniel Boone (Monogram–1950), The Law and Billy the Kid (Columbia–1954), Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (Republic–1956) and Villa! (TCF–1958). Note that seven (7) of these films fall into the category of American/ Westerns. ** Custen defines the biopic as a film that depicts the life of a historical person, past or present. Although all of the biopics considered in the Custen study and current study are based on the lives of persons who actually existed, not all of them attempt to depict the life, meaning the entire life, of that historical person. Thus, there may be some reasonable disagreement as to the inclusion or exclusion of certain films in these and future biopic studies.\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing.

The more limited conclusions drawn by Custen and those based on the extended study are set forth, along with some comparative analysis of both. Ultimately, the questions raised come down to: does this entire body of work (the biopics) show a Hollywood bias toward certain kinds of people in terms of the number of portrayals, who is portrayed and how? The evidence developed through this survey of motion picture biographies and set forth herein requires an affirmative answer to that question. In addition, of course, when this Hollywood biopic study is read in conjunction with the companion volume Who Really Controls Hollywood, it can be viewed as providing further evidence in support of the established fact that the small group of politically liberal, not very religious Jewish* males of European heritage, and who also control Hollywood do, in fact, engage in the pervasive nepotism, favoritism, cronyism and other forms of discrimination observed by the numerous writers of the Hollywood scene cited herein (see also Hollywood Wars — How Insiders Gained and Maintain Illegitimate Control Over the Film Industry). As Who Really Controls Hollywood reveals, a significant number of observers of the Hollywood scene have, independent of each other, concluded that Hollywood is controlled by a small group of Jewish males of European heritage (or more precisely, a small group of Jewish males of European heritage who are politically liberal and not very religious). As noted in that book, it is also significant that none of the writers in the bibliographies for either of these volumes made an affirmative statement that any other religious, ethnic, cultural or racial group controls Hollywood. Also, as set forth in Who Really Controls Hollywood, the studies of the industry literature and other surveys are consistent with the above-stated observations regarding the Hollywood control group. In addition, as can be seen from the material presented in the companion book Hollywood Wars — How Insiders Gained and Maintain Illegitimate Control Over the Film Industry, (i.e., dealing with the question of how the Hollywood control group gained and maintained its position of power), nepotism and its broader, but related forms of discrimination (favoritism and cronyism) have long been pervasive in the U.S. film industry. * Many Hollywood observers avoid issues relating to the religious/cultural backgrounds of those who dominate the film business for various reasons. However, in the view of this author such avoidance is not only intellectually dishonest, it overlooks an important element that helps determine the kinds of movies we see. After all, movies to a large extent tend to mirror the values, interests, cultural perspectives and prejudices of their makers. In this book, people with names that are commonly considered of Jewish origin are not counted as persons of Jewish heritage for purposes of the statistical calculations presented (only those persons who have been identified as persons of Jewish heritage in published sources are counted), thus such calculations are likely to be more conservative than would otherwise be the case.\n\n3\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nThese two important observations, taken together, underlay the clear relevance of the studies set forth in of this book series dealing with the results of such control, and more specifically with the issue of whether the favoritism demonstrated by the Hollywood control group, has resulted in an unfair advantage for producers, directors, screenwriters, actors and actresses with similar backgrounds (i.e., there is no level playing field in the Hollywood-based U.S. film industry). These observations also form the basis for determining and reporting here (to the extent possible and based on the limited information available), how many of such persons have what appears to be one of the essential elements qualifying them as beneficiaries of such favoritism, (i.e., a Jewish heritage). For these reasons, the following discussion of Hollywood biopics will also include designations, where appropriate (and when available from published sources), of the religious/ cultural background of the filmmakers and studio executives involved. Again, to the extent that this material demonstrates that a disproportionately high number of Jewish actors, actresses, screenwriters, directors and producers were given the opportunity to participate in the making of this body of films, this observed phenomenon adds support for the contention that the Hollywood control group routinely engages in nepotism, favoritism, cronyism and other forms of employment discrimination in selecting who gets to work on these movies (see Hollywood Wars — How Insiders Gained and Maintain Illegitimate Control Over the Film Industry). In addition, to the extent that this study demonstrates that a disproportionate number of Hollywood motion picture biographies focus on so-called Jewish subjects (particularly of Jewish males, who are politically liberal and not very religious), such a separate phenomenon tends to add further support for the fact reported in Who Really Controls Hollywood that the Hollywood-based U.S. film industry is, and has long been, controlled by a small group of Jewish males of European heritage who are politically liberal and not very religious. In addition, this second phenomenon further supports the underlying thesis of another of this book’s companion volumes, Patterns of Bias in Hollywood Movies (Algora, 2012), i.e., that movies mirror the values, interests, cultural perspectives and prejudices of their makers. In other words, without the benefit of being able to read the minds of those who were responsible for making the choices that resulted in the Hollywood biopics, the next best evidence of the motivation behind such choices is the observation and analysis of patterns of apparent bias in the overall record established. This book exposes those patterns of bias with respect to motion picture biographies. Enjoy! John Cones\n\n4\n\nCones, John W..

The Early Years Revisited This chapter provides an overview of the Hollywood motion picture biographies released from 1912 to 1929 and points out several of the earliest patterns of bias in this category of film. One of the earliest films to be released in the U.S. was a biopic, the Britishmade Queen Elizabeth (1912). As the Katz Film Encyclopedia reports, “receipts from this film’s distribution in the U.S. provided [Jewish studio executive] Adolph Zukor4 with the funds to found Paramount.”5 French actress Sarah Bernhardt, described by the Standard Jewish Encyclopedia as a “half-Jewess” starred in the film.6 This early biopic represents the very beginning of a long series of films released in the U.S. marketplace that focus on European history. One of the Warners’ earliest commercial successes, and possibly the first American-made biographical motion picture, came with “a biopic of the American ambassador to Germany, My Four Years in Germany (1918).”7 It may immediately strike many people odd that, with all of the other available subjects from thousands of years of history, a major studio would first choose to make a biopic on such a topic. This was clearly a film that was of ideological interest to the filmmakers and that is most likely why this subject was chosen over all others, during a time coinciding with the American participation in World War I against Germany and its partners in war. Paramount followed in the biopic category in 1923 with its release of The Ten Commandments, a “two-phase silent version of the Book of Exodus and the application of the Ten Commandments in modern life. In part one, set in ancient times, Moses leads the Israelites into the promised land. Part two, set in the modern period (1923 San Francisco), two brothers show the power of prayer and truth.”8 The script was written by Jeanie MacPherson. Cecil B. de 5\n\nCones, John W..

Lasky.10 Another of Warner Bros.’ early efforts was Beau Brummell (1924), a film that tells the story of a “Regency dandy [who] becomes the right-hand man of the Prince of Wales, but falters through his own arrogance.” The script was written by Dorothy Farnum. The film was directed by Harry Beaumont. It starred John Barrymore, Mary Astor (originally Lucille Vasconcellos Langhanke), Jewish actress Carmel Myers11 and Willard Louis. Another version of the same story (which is of questionable interest to American moviegoers) was released in 1954.12 In other words, it is fair to ask, “Were these movies produced and released because Americans were voting with their pocketbooks, as is often suggested by Hollywood studio executives, or were these films chosen because they were of interest to the filmmakers, including the studio executives who authorized the films to be produced and/or released? Most likely, the latter.* In the 1927 UA release The Beloved Rogue, fifteenth-century poet and “thief François Villon becomes a friend of the king, but is banished when he falls for a lady of the court.”13 Paul Bern (Levy)14 wrote the script directed by Alan Crosland. The film starred John Barrymore, Jewish actor Conrad Veidt,15 Marceline Day, Mack Swain and Slim Summerville. The following year (1928), the Warner’s Glorious Betsy continued Hollywood’s interest in European subjects. This film focused on Napoleon’s younger brother and his love for an American girl. Alan Crosland directed and the film starred Conrad Nagel, Dolores Costello, John Miljan and Betty Blythe.16 In 1929, Is Everybody Happy? (Warner Bros.) portrays the story of “Jewish performer . . . Ted Lewis (Theodore Friedman),”17 the “life of a clarinetist (and bandleader) who rises from poverty.” The script was written by Joseph Jackson and James A. Starr. Archie Maylor directed. The film featured Ted Lewis himself, along with Alice Day, Ann Pennington and Lawrence Grant.18 The picture represents one of the earliest of a long line of Hollywood biopics featuring Jewish entertainers.\n\nSome of the films in both the Custen study and this more current update of Hollywood biopics were classified as British or Canadian productions, or U.S. coproductions with any one of several countries. Each of those films are included in this study because they were ultimately either released in the domestic marketplace by a U.S. distributor or released to video and thus available for screening in the U.S. marketplace. In addition, in this current study, some of the movies considered were so-called made-for-television-movies. These have been included because in many instances, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether a so-called made-forTV-movie was actually intended from the very beginning to only be shown on TV, or whether it started out just as any other feature film, with the hope that it would be released into the theatrical marketplace, when after the film was completed, it was adjudged merely suitable for showing on television and/or going direct to video.\n\n*\n\n6\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter 1. The Early Years Revisited\n\nThat same year (1929), the Warner Bros. release Disraeli, focused on the efforts of the “Prime Minister of England (described by Steven Scheuer as ‘wily and brilliant’) as he “paves the way for the Suez Canal.”19 The film included “[f]ictionalized episodes in the life of the Victorian statesman, including his activities as a matchmaker.” Alfred E. Green directed. The film starred George Arliss, Joan Bennett, Florence Arliss, Anthony Bushell, David Torrence, Ivan Simpson and Doris Lloyd.20 The film’s subject, Benjamin Disraeli (the Earl of Beaconsfield), had a Jewish heritage and is listed as Jewish by the New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia.21 On the other hand, Disraeli was baptized in the Anglican Church (1817) in England supposedly because his Jewish father “had a low opinion both of Judaism and of Jews.”22 In addition, however, “Jews were not legally admitted to parliament until 1858, and without his baptism Disraeli could never have become Prime Minster.”23 Also, “Disraeli never took the defensive line that Jews were no worse than other men. He thought they were better . . . Disraeli preached the innate superiority of certain races . . . He was descended, he said . . . ‘in a direct line from one of the oldest races in the world, from that rigidly separate and unmixed Bedouin race who had developed a high civilization at a time when the inhabitants of England were going half naked and eating acorns in the woods’.”24 In the film, Disraeli not only had to fight the opponents of British imperialism, but also had to face up to those who opposed him simply as a Jew. As Patricia Erens points out, the film provides a favorable portrayal of Disraeli and concludes that “the [Jewish] outsider has more loyalty and love for his country than the native Englishman.”25 In summary for these early years, it can be accurately observed that five of the eight biopics released in the U.S. during this period (from 1912 through 1929) focused on the lives of European historical figures. Also, six of the eight either featured a Jewish actor or actress, or focused on the life of a Jewish historical figure. In addition, the only biopic relating to a specific religious figure portrayed the life of a prominent Jewish religious leader (Moses). Thus, this brief survey of the early biopics clearly demonstrates that a bias in favor of European as well as Jewish-related subjects and actor/actresses was apparent from the early days of movies in America. As this work moves forward, an effort will be made to observe whether such early trends continue. Based on the results of this initial survey, it would seem negligent for anyone studying Hollywood biopics to comment on one of these patterns of bias while overlooking the other.\n\n7\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s Hollywood offered 67 biopics during the decade of the ’30s. The clear trend of the decade was a continuing emphasis on European subjects. Thirty-three (nearly 50%) focused on Europeans, including 13 motion picture biographies relating to European royalty (nearly 20%). Each year of the decade, except one, witnessed the release of such a film, with as many as three being released in each of two years. Once again, the Hollywood studio executives would argue that they were only presenting the kinds of movies the people wanted. It is much more likely that such films were being offered because they tended to deal with subjects of interest to the film community, many of whom had European backgrounds. European Royalty — The first of the decade was UA’s Du Barry, Woman of Passion (1930). It was produced by and starred Norma Talmadge, wife “of the influential [Jewish] producer Joseph Schenck,26 who took charge of her career in 1916.” The film purportedly portrays “[i]ncidents in the life of the mistress of Louis XV”27 who was “guillotined for crimes against the state by a Revolutionary tribunal.”28 Sam Taylor directed. Others appearing in the film included William Farnum, Hobart Bosworth, Conrad Nagel and Alison Spikeworth.29 Jewish* producer Irving Thalberg30 then produced an MGM release for release in 1932, Rasputin and the Empress. This movie told the “story of the last years of the Russian court, when a sinister monk gained influence over the empress.”31 In that * Some may argue that it is unfair to focus on the backgrounds of Jewish studio executives and creative personnel to the exclusion of others. On the other hand, whenever the facts demonstrate that African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans, ItalianAmericans, Christians, Muslims, Whites from the South or some other religious, ethnic, cultural or racial group dominates Hollywood, then the focus could rightfully shift to that or those groups. Meanwhile, the facts must lead us where they will, Hollywood smokescreens notwithstanding.\n\n9\n\nCones, John W..

And, of course, it would be fair to characterize the film’s presentation of the non-Jewish religious figure (the monk) as a negative portrayal, making this picture one of the first of a long line of Hollywood films that negatively portray non-Jewish religious figures (see Patterns of Bias in Hollywood Movies). “Alleging that the film libeled her, [Princess Irina] . . . sued MGM in a British court, and was awarded substantial damages. In the United States, a substantial out-ofcourt settlement (reported . . . to have been in the neighborhood of $1 million) was reached with the wronged Romanovs.”32 Richard Boleslawski directed. The film starred John Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Diana Wynyard, Ralph Morgan (originally Raphael Kuhner Wupperman),33 and C. Henry Gordon.34 The following year (1933), Queen Christina (MGM) was produced by the Jewish studio executive Walter Wanger (Feuchtwanger).35 In this biopic, the “queen of 17th-century Sweden, distressed at the thought of a political marriage, goes wandering through her country in men’s clothes and falls in love with the new Spanish ambassador.” Russian-born Jewish director Rouben Mamoulian36 (of Armenian descent)37 directed. The film starred Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Ian Keith, Lewis Stone, C. Aubrey Smith, Reginald Owen and Elizabeth Young.38 A total of three European royalty films came out in 1934. The Scarlet Empress (Paramount — 1934) was [a] fantasia on the love life of Catherine the Great,”39 Czarina of Russia. She was the Russian leader who divided “Russia into provinces and classifie[d] . . . their inhabitants into various categories.” She classified “rich Jews as merchants to be included within the guild, while other Jews [were] . . . classified as burghers. Thus, Russia [became] . . . the first European country in which Jews [were] . . . permitted to elect or to be elected to guild councils and municipalities.”40 Viennaborn Josef Von Sternberg (from an Orthodox Jewish family)41 directed. The film starred Marlene Dietrich, John Lodge, Jewish actor Sam Jaffe,42 Louise Dresser (Kerlin), C. Aubrey Smith, Gavin Gordon and Jameson Thomas.43 That same year (1934), Warner Bros. provided a second telling of the “life of the legendary courtesan at Versailles” in Madame Du Barry, regardless of whether the public wanted to see the story again or not. German-born William Dieterle directed. The film starred Dolores del Rio, Reginal Owen, Victor Jory, Anita Louise, Osgood Perkins and Verree Teasdale.44 Also in 1934, Jewish producer Alexander Korda45 produced Catherine the Great for release in 1934, by United Artists. The film tells “[h]ow Catherine married the mad prince and slowly conquered the Russian court.” Director Paul Czinner was born in Budapest and moved to England before emigrating 10\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\nto the U.S. after the Nazis came to power in 1933.46 The film starred Jewish actress Elisabeth Bergner,47 Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., (grandson of a prominent Jewish lawyer), 48 Flora Robson, Gerald du Maurier, Irene Vanbrugh, Griffith Jones, Joan Gardner and Diana Napier.49 Then in 1935, the UA release Nell Gwyn, starred Anna Neagle, Cedric Hardwicke, Jeanne de Casalis, Murial George, Miles Maileson, Esme Percy and Moore Marriott. The film purportedly tells about the “affair of Charles II (the King of England, Scotland and Ireland who reigned during the Restoration and the return of the constitutional monarchy to Great Britain)50 and an orange seller.”51 According to Judah Gribetz, “[r]estoration of the Stuart monarchy [brought] . . . a challenge to the newly reestablished Jewish community in London when King Charles II [was] . . . petitioned to expel them. The fact that Jewish cloth merchants (were) underselling established London merchants [was] . . . brought as proof that Jews endanger[ed] the economy.” Charles II, however, rejected the petition.52 In addition, Gribetz reports that when the Earl of Berkshire attempted to extort a large sum of money from the Jewish community of England by threatening to apply the Coventicle Act to Jewish worship, the Jews appealed to the king and were reassured that the law would not be used against them.53 Thus, it is fair to observe that King Charles II was somewhat of a hero to many Jews. The ostensible reward was to be favorably portrayed in a Hollywood movie. Irish-born Herbert Wilcox produced and directed. The 1936 European royalty offering was Mary of Scotland (RKO), in which “Mary Stuart refuses to give up her claim to the English throne, and is eventually executed.” The film was directed by John Ford for Jewish producer Pandro S. Berman.54 Historian George MacDonald Fraser called it “the worst historical picture” he had “ever seen.” He says it “romanticizes or distorts the characters beyond recognition.” Fraser further stated that the film portrayed Queen Elizabeth I as “a vicious shrew [and] Mary as a misty-eyed heroine.”55 As an indication of how Queen Elizabeth I related to English Jews of that day, Judah Gribetz points out that a Dr. Rodrigo Lopes, “one of about 80 Marranos* known to live in London during her reign” was the physician to Queen Elizabeth I, and was “executed on a false charge of attempting to poison the queen.” Also, Gribetz reports that Lopes’ fate caused “the Marrano community [in London] to dwindle away.”56 Gribetz reports further, that during the reign of Elizabeth I, and for some years afterwards, Jews could be and were arrested and fined for “failure to attend the Church of England.”57 It is therefore not surprising that a Jewish producer (Berman) might be motivated to portray Queen Elizabeth I in a * “Term applied in Spain and Portugal to the descendants of baptized Jews suspected of secret adherence to Judaism.” [Wigoder, 631].\n\n11\n\nCones, John W..

The power to produce and release a film biography may include the ability to exact a certain measure of revenge on an individual’s historical portrayal. The people who control the production and distribution of movies have that power. The film Mary of Scotland starred Katharine Hepburn, Fredric March, Donald Crisp, Florence Eldridge, Douglas Walton, John Carradine, Robert Barrat, Monte Blue (part Cherokee Indian),58 Moroni Olsen, Frieda Inescort and Alan Mowbray.59 The 1937 film Victoria the Great (RKO) presents “[e]pisodes in the life of Queen Victoria”60 the queen of Great Britain and Ireland from 1837 to 1901. She was a friend of Jewish leader Moses Montefiore (whom she later knighted), and Paul Johnson suggests Sir Montefiore was “probably responsible for her marked Judophilia.”61 During her reign the British government intervened on behalf of Jews in Switzerland (1856), in the Balkans, and at the Congress of Berlin in 1876.62 The film was directed and produced by the Irish-born Herbert Wilcox. It starred Anna Neagle, Jewish actor Anton Walbrook (born Adolf Anton Wilhelm Wohlbruck in Vienna)63 British actor H.B. Warner, Walter Rilla and Mary Morris.64 The next year (1938), in Paramount’s If I Were King, “[the] 14th-century poet and rascal François Villon matches wits with [the French King] Louis XI and leads an uprising of the people.”65 The script was written by Preston Sturges (born Edmond P. Biden in Chicago). Frank Lloyd produced and directed. The film starred Ronald Coleman, Basil Rathbone, Frances Dee, Henry Wilcoxon and Sidney Toler. Also in 1938, Marie Antoinette (MGM) portrayed the “last days of the French court before the revolution” that resulted in the abolition of the French monarchy and the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1793.66 Fraser suggests that “one of the high points in the picture is [the recitation by Jewish actor Joseph Schildkraut]67 “of popular grievances.”68 The emancipation of the Jews of France from numerous disabilities came about as a result of the French Revolution. The script for the film was written by Claudine West, Donald Ogden Stewart and Ernest Vajda. W. S. Van Dyke directed for producer Hunt Stromberg. The film also starred Norma Shearer (who, as noted earlier, had converted to Judaism)69 Tyrone Power, John Barrymore, Robert Morley and Gladys George.70 Finally, in 1938, RKO’s Queen of Destiny (aka Sixty Glorious Years) again presents “[s]cenes from the life of Queen Victoria”71 friend of the Jews.72 The script was written by Robert Vansittart, English-born Miles Malleson and Charles de Grandcourt. Herbert Wilcox (originally from Ireland) produced and directed. The film starred Anna Neagle, Jewish actor Anton Walbrook73 and C. Aubrey Smith.74\n\n12\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\nIn the last year of the decade, 1939, Warner Bros. released The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. In this biopic, “Elizabeth I [the Queen of England] falls in love with the Earl of Essex, but events turn him into a rebel and she has to order his execution.”75 As noted earlier, Elizabeth I “succeeded the Catholic Mary I and reestablished Protestantism in England.”76 Her ascension to the throne also resulted in the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. As noted earlier, with respect to the film Mary of Scotland, Queen Elizabeth I’s reign marked a time of difficulty for Jews in England.77 In any case, the historian Fraser observes that the film “plays false with history.”78 The script for this film was written by Pennsylvania-born Norman Reilly Raine and Aeneas Mackenzie. Michael Curtiz (born in Budapest, of Jewish parentage)79 directed for Chicago-born producer Robert Lord. The film starred Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland and Donald Crisp. Some again may suggest that the Hollywood moviemakers were merely responding to the movie going desires of the American public with such offerings. However, this book provides an additional or alternative motivation, and that is the interests and background of the filmmakers or studio executives themselves (i.e., their own fascination with their European heritage is at least part of the explanation for so many biopics focusing on European royalty). In contrast to the favored royals of Europe, royalty in that section of the world that we might refer to today as the Middle East was almost overlooked by Hollywood during the decade. In 1934, however, Paramount did release Cecil B. de Mille’s Cleopatra. The film focused on the time period “[a]fter Julius Caesar’s death, [when] Cleopatra turns her attention to Mark Antony”80 who had been “given control of the Near East” including the traditional Jewish homeland incorporating Palestine, Judea and Jerusalem.81 The film starred Claudette Colbert, Henry Wilcoxon, Warren William, Gertrude Michael, Jewish actor Joseph Schildkraut,82 Ian Keith, C. Aubrey Smith, Leonard Mudie, Jewish actor Irving Pichel83 and Arthur Hohl. De Mille, whose father (as noted earlier) was Episcopalian and mother was of Jewish descent,84 produced and directed. Entertainers — The second largest area of biopic interest for the Hollywood moviemakers in the 1930s was entertainers (i.e., their own industry). Eight of the motion picture biographies of the ’30s focused on persons in the entertainment field. A European flavor continued to be apparent. Exactly half of the entertainer subjects of the biopics in this decade had European backgrounds. A Lady’s Morals was released by MGM in 1930. In this biopic, “[t]he ‘Swedish nightingale’ [Jenny Lind] learns that love is more important than a singing career.”85 After singing several arias, in this “early musical . . . [the 13\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nLind character ends] up with a blind concert pianist.”86 Sidney Franklin directed. The film starred Grace Moore, Reginald Denny, Wallace Beery and Jobyna Howland. A few years later, in 1934, the 20th Century-Fox release The Mighty Barnum relates “the life and times of the legendary showman.”87 Halliwell’s calls it a “fictionalized biopic of the great showman of the nineties.” The film starred Wallace Beery, Virginia Bruce, Adolphe Menjou, Janet Beecher and Rochelle Hudson.88 Tennessee-born Walter Lang directed for producer Darryl F. Zanuck (of Swiss-Protestant heritage). In 1936, MGM’s The Great Ziegfeld provides a musical salute to the Jewish U.S. theatrical producer Florenz Ziegfeld89 referred to by Steven Scheuer as “the master showman.”90 As Patricia Erens reports, the film “makes no mention of Ziegfeld’s Jewish origins.”91 The film was directed by Chicagoborn Robert Zigler Leonard for producer Hunt Stromberg. It starred William Powell, Vienna-born Jewish actress Luise Rainer,92 Myrna Loy, Frank Morgan, Reginald Owen, Nat Pendleton and Virginia Bruce. Three additional films also treat Ziegfeld’s “legendary career”93 directly, including I’ll See You in My Dreams (1951), The Story of Will Rogers (1952), and The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), all discussed below. Presumably, if the Hollywood film community decides, for whatever reasons, to portray a person’s life in four feature films, the adjective “legendary” would actually become a self-fulfilling prophesy, regardless of the true-life accomplishments of the individual (i.e., the films themselves contribute significantly to the construction of the legend). The following year, in 1937, Warner Bros. released The Great Garrick a motion picture biography of the “British actor and theater manager who was considered the foremost Shakespearean player of his time (1717–1779).”94 In this film “[w]hen Garrick goes to act in Paris, members of the Comédie Française take over a wayside inn and try to teach him a lesson, but the plan goes awry.” The film starred British-born actor Brian Aherne, Edward Everett Horton, Olivia de Havilland, Lionel Atwill and Melville Cooper. The English-born James Whale directed for Jewish producer Mervyn LeRoy95 (from San Francisco). Then in 1938, The Great Waltz (MGM) presented the “screen biography of Johann Strauss.”96 In the film, “[y]oung Johann Strauss becomes Vienna’s waltz king.”97 Strauss was the “founder of the famous Viennese musical family (and) . . . the son of a baptized Jewish innkeeper in Budapest.”98 The script was written by Vienna-born Walter Reisch and Russian-born Samuel Hoffenstein. The French-born Julien Duvivier directed for producer Bernard Hyman.99 In the final year of the decade, in The Great Victor Herbert (Paramount — 1939) the “famous composer plays cupid to two young singers [at the 14\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\nturn of the century].”100 Herbert was an “American musician, composer, and conductor particularly known for his comic operas, including Babes in Toyland (1903).”101 Author and film critic Steven Scheuer labels the biopic “[i]naccurate. . .”102 The script was written by Russel Crouse and Robert Lively. California-born Andrew L. Stone produced and directed. The film starred Walter Connolly, Allan Jones, Mary Martin, Susanna Foster and Lee Bowman. Also in 1939, Swanee River (TCF) portrayed the “life and loves of Stephen Foster”103 whose “works . . . including ‘Oh! Susannah’ (1848), reflect the sentiment of pre-Civil War America.”104 Oddly enough, “although his songs drew their inspiration from Southern life and did much to create the popular romantic image of that life, he himself had no firsthand knowledge of the South beyond that gathered on a single brief visit to New Orleans in 1852.” Foster was born in Pennsylvania, then lived and worked in Cincinnati and New York.105 The script for this biopic was written by John Taintor Foote and New York-born Philip Dunne. Chicago-born Sidney Lanfield directed for producer Darryl F. Zanuck. The film starred Don Ameche, Jewish actor Al Jolson,106 Andrea Leeds, Felix Bressart and Russell Hicks. Finally, in 1939, The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (RKO) portrayed the “husband and wife dance team who had their first success in Paris and became influential international celebrities before he was killed as a flier in World War I”107 Vernon Castle was born in Britain.108 The script was written by Richard Sherman and Jewish lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II.109 New York-born H. C. Potter directed for Jewish producer Pandro S. Berman110 and George Haight. The film starred Fred Astaire (originally Frederick Austerlitz),111 Ginger Rogers, Edna May Oliver, Walter Brennan, the Jewish comedian and actor Lew Fields (originally named Lewis Maurice Schanfield),112 Etienne Girardot and Donald MacBride. Political Figures — Political figures formed the next most popular biopic category for the ’30s with five, although that same number of motion picture biographies were released for crime-related and western figures. In 1930, D.W. Griffith produced and directed UA’s Abraham Lincoln, an “account of Lincoln’s entry into politics and his years of power.”113 The film starred Walter Huston, Una Merkel, Edgar Dearing, Russell Simpson and Henry B. Walthall. The following year, in 1931, the Warner Bros.’ feature Alexander Hamilton focused on the “life of America’s 18th-century financier.” John G. Adolfi directed. The film starred George Arliss, Doris Kenyon, Montague Love, Dudley Digges, Lionel Belmore, Ralf Harolde and Alan Mowbray.114\n\n15\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nTwo years later, in 1933, The Man Who Dared (Fox) featured the “life of a local politician, based on Mayor Cernak of Chicago.” The script was written by Charles Grayson and Sy Bartlett. The film was directed by Lewis R. Foster and starred Lewis Stone, Tom Brown, Barbara Read, Marjorie Main and Forrester Harvey.115 In Parnell (MGM — 1937) “[a] 19th-century Irish politician comes to grief through his love for a married woman.” The film tells the “[s]tory of the great Irish [statesman and] patriot [Charles Steven Parnell] . . .”116 who became “involved in a scandalous divorce trial.”117 The “Irish nationalist leader . . . served as a member of the British parliament (1875–1891) and led Ireland’s Home Rule Movement.”118 According to Custen, the Parnell biopic was also a plea “for political and ethical tolerance,”119 one of the long-standing preferred themes for Hollywood films. This biopic was produced and directed by the New York-born Jewish director John M. Stahl.120 It starred Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, Edmund Gwenn, Edna May Oliver and Alan Marsha.121 Then, in 1939, the 20th Century-Fox release Young Mr. Lincoln again portrays Abraham Lincoln, this time “as a young country lawyer (who) stops a lynching and proves a young man innocent of murder.”122 This was at least the second Hollywood film to this point touching on the life (or death) of Abraham Lincoln. It combines Hollywood’s interest in Lincoln with another favored theme (i.e., the study of mob psychology or the prevention of mob killings). The script was written by Georgia-born Lamar Trotti. John Ford (born in Maine as Sean Aloysius O’Feeney) directed for the Harvardeducated producer Kenneth MacGowan (originally from Massachusetts). The film starred Henry Fonda, Alice Brady, Marjorie Weaver, Richard Cromwell, Donald Meek and Arleen Whelan.123 Crime-Related Subjects — As noted above, Hollywood released as many crime-related biopics in the ’30s as motion picture biographies on political figures and westerns. As the decade opened, Paramount’s Street of Chance (1930) began the long line of Hollywood gangster/outlaw biopics. The film starred William Powell, Kay Francis, Regis Toomey and Jean Arthur. In the film, Powell “plays a de-ethnicized character based on Arnold Rothstein, a (New York, Jewish) gambler about town124 who falls afoul of the boys when he takes his kid brother to the gaming table to teach him a lesson. Sonny cleans out the pros and the fat is in the fire.”125 In real life, “Rothstein was the first Jew to win significant influence” with the Tammany Hall political machine in New York, and “he became the first of the bootleg tycoons.”126 He was also primarily responsible for the 1919 fix of the baseball world series between the Chicago White Sox and the Cincinnati Reds. John Cromwell directed the film for Jewish producer David O. Selznick.127\n\n16\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter 2. Biopics of the 1930s\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of this biopic is that its subject, Arnold Rothstein was, according to Patricia Erens, a notorious Jewish criminal “known during the twenties as ‘the J.P. Morgan of the underworld,’” but, as reported above, the ethnicity of Rothstein was so obliterated that the film was not even included in Erens’s book The Jew in American Cinema. Thus, in the years to come, when the ethnic backgrounds of Italian and Irish criminals were openly portrayed in Hollywood films, the Jewish background of Rothstein (in this film) was so completely annihilated that an expert on the subject of Jews in film does not even recognize this film as an example of Jews in Cinema. Again, the people who control the movie making apparatus have the power to choose to openly depict the ethnicity of other groups when portraying criminals and choose to hide the ethnicity of their own fellows. In 1932, Warner Bros. released I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. The film, produced by Jewish producer Hal B. Wallis128 portrayed an “innocent man [who was] . . . convicted and after brutal treatment with the [Southern] chain gang becomes a vicious criminal on the run.” This film represents one of the early examples of a long Hollywood preference for portraying most things Southern in a negative or stereotypical manner. Jewish director Mervyn LeRoy directed.129 The film starred Jewish actor Paul Muni,130 Glenda Farrell, Helen Vinson and Preston Foster.* Two years later, (1934) Now I’ll Tell once again presented the “story of (Jewish gangster) Arnold Rothstein, gambler/racketeer of the twenties, this time as told by his widow.”131 Edwin Burke wrote and directed for producer Winfield Sheehan. The film starred Spencer Tracy, Helen Twelvetrees, Hobart Cavanaugh, Alice Faye, G.P. Huntley, Jr., Shirley Temple and Leon Ames. Finally, in 1934, Jewish producer David O. Selznick132 portrayed a crimefigure of a different variety in producing Viva Villa! for release by MGM. The film portrays “[t]he career of a Mexican rebel.” Jack Conway directed the script written by Jewish writer Ben Hecht133 (the son of Jewish immigrants from South Russia).134 The film starred Wallace Beery, Fay Wray, Leo Carrillo and Donald Cook. This is the first of only three Hollywood biopics focusing on Mexicans or Mexican-Americans during the period of the study (two about revolutionaries and one about an entertainer). In another variation on the crime figure category, Paramount released, The Buccaneer, in 1938. In this film, French “pirate Jean Lafitte helps President Andrew Jackson to repel the British . . . [d]uring the 1812 war.” The script was written by Jeanie Macpherson, New York-born Jewish writer Edwin Justus Mayer135 and Harold Lamb. Cecil B. de Mille (mother of Jewish descent)136 * This film represents one of the early examples of an incredible series of Hollywood films that consistently portray people, places and things of the American South in a negative or stereotypical manner (see Patterns of Bias in Motion Picture Content).\n\n17\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing.

The film starred Fredric March, Franciska Gaal, Jewish actor Akim Tamiroff137 and Margot Grahame.138 Westerns — Hollywood has also demonstrated some partiality to glamorizing the lives of outlaws from the western era. In 1930, MGM released Billy the Kid, the story of a “young western outlaw [who] is relentlessly pursued by Sheriff Pat Garrett.” King Vidor directed. The film starred Johnny Mack Brown, Wallace Beery, Kay Johnson, Karl Dane and Roscoe Ates.139 Also, in the ’30s decade, 20th Century-Fox released Jesse James (1938). In this film, the two James “brothers take to train robbing when railroad employees harass their family . . . [a]fter the Civil War.”140 The film was directed by Virginia-born Henry King for producer Nunnally Johnson (from Georgia). It starred Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Nancy Kelly, Jane Darwell and Randolph Scott. Fraser says the film provides “a very sympathetic treatment” of the James Boys,141 who are outlaws nonetheless. The desire by Hollywood moguls to portray outlaws in a sympathetic way may be traced to their own roots as outlaw producers. Many of the founders of Hollywood started their careers as independent producers using cameras obtained from the Edison Trust, for which they failed to pay contractual royalties. In an effort to escape the collection efforts of the Edison Trust (which admittedly went too far) many of these outlaw producers moved their operations as far away from the East Coast as possible (i.e., to Hollywood). But, then they used their films about outlaws to explore and portray their sometimes sympathetic motives. Sol M. Wurtzel had struck a blow for the good guys a few years earlier with his production of Frontier Marshal for release by 20th Century-Fox (1933). In this film, “Wyatt Earp cleans up Tombstone.” The script was written by Sam Hellman. Allan Dwan directed. The film starred Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Cesar Romero and Binnie Barnes.142 This same Wyatt Earp story was redone as My Darling Clementine in 1946. Interestingly, there is a Jewish connection with the Wyatt Earp pictures. As Howard Sachar reports, “[a]fter the Civil War, several [Jewish men] won election . . . as mayors, of Rosedale, Wichita, and Dodge City. Adolph Cluck, a Dodge City councilman, liked the looks of a promising young marksman, Wyatt Earp, and appointed him to enforce the law. Earp in turn liked the looks of a visiting San Francisco Jewish woman, Sarah Marcus, and made her his common-law wife. Upon his death many years later, she had him buried in a Jewish cemetery.”143 Another western hero came in the form of the RKO release Daniel Boone (1936). This story of the “early American frontier features rugged outdoor star George O’Brien in the title role and evil John Carradine as a renegade who aids the marauding Indians.”144 Interestingly enough, frontiersman 18\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\nBoone was an employee of the mostly Jewish-owned Transylvania Company (the three Hart brothers and a Richard Henderson) that purchased a twentymillion-acre stretch of Kentucky land south of the Kentucky River for development. In addition, Boone “recruited a Jewish lad (Samuel Sanders) as his assistant.”145 David Howard directed the film in which Heather Angel also makes an appearance.146 As noted above, three other films focusing on various aspects of Daniel Boone’s life were released in 1941, 1950 and 1956. Thus, the legend of Daniel Boone is another in which film portrayals played a hand. Women Subjects — The biopics of the 1930s featured a total of 18 women subjects, a healthy sounding number, although only 27% of the total motion picture biographies for the decade. In addition, of course, ten of the eighteen were of European Royalty, suggesting more interest by Hollywood in Royalty that happened to be female, than the other way around. In 1932, MGM’s Mata Hari takes us back to European politics, telling the story of the “famous lady spy of World War I” who used sex to get the secrets she wanted. George Fitzmaurice directed. The film starred Greta Garbo, Ramon Novarro, Lionel Barrymore, Lewis Stone, C. Henry Gordon, Karen Morely, Blanche Frederici.147 The film was remade in 1985. Hollywood’s second portrayal of a woman as the focus of a biopic in the ’30s was about a woman obsessed with money. In 1934’s You Can’t’ Buy Everything (MGM) “[a] woman obsessed by her mounting bank balance almost ruins the lives of her family.” Minneapolis-born Charles F. Reisner directed. The film starred May Robson, Jean Parker, Lewis Stone, Mary Forbes and Reginald Mason.148 In 1935, RKO presented a female heroine in Annie Oakley. Cliff Reid produced this “historical story, more or less, of the lady later immortalized in Annie Get Your Gun (1950).”149 California-born George Stevens directed. The film starred Barbara Stanwyck, Preston Foster, McIvyn Douglas, Moroni Olsen, Pert Kelton, Andy Clyde and Chief Thunderbird. The following year (1936), The White Angel (Warner Bros.) portrayed the life of Florence Nightingale, the “British nurse who [in 1854] organized and directed a unit of field nurses during the Crimean War and is considered the founder of modern nursing.”150 During the Crimean War (1853–1856) “a coalition of English, French, and Turkish troops defeated the Russian forces, although Crimea itself did not change hands.”151 Crimea is the Russian peninsula in the Black Sea where Jewish settlements date from the first century before the so-called Christian era.152 Again, the Germanborn William Dieterle directed for producer Henry Blanke. The film starred Kay Francis, Ian Hunter, Donald Wood, Nigel Bruce, Donald Crisp, Henry O’Neill, Billy Mauch and Halliwell Hobbes.153 19\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nThat same year, in the 1936 MGM release The Gorgeous Hussy, the “love life of Peggy O’Neal”154 was featured. She was actually Peggy O’Neal Eaton “the daughter of a tavern keeper whose inn was frequented by (Washington D.C.) political figures.” She was the center of a controversy over her supposed relationship with Senator John H. Eaton of Tennessee (whom she later married) while her first husband was at sea. President Andrew Jackson (a close friend of Eaton), “was outraged and became the (social) champion of the Eatons.”155 Clarence Brown directed for Jewish producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz.156 The film starred Joan Crawford, Lionel Barrymore, Franchot Tone, Melvyn Douglas (Hesselberg; whose father was Jewish)157 and Robert Taylor. Also in 1937, MGM’s Conquest focused on the “life of Napoleon’s most enduring mistress.” The script was written by the Russian-born Samuel Hoffenstein, Salka Viertel and S.N. Behrman. Clarence Brown directed for producer Bernard Hyman. The film starred Greta Garbo, Charles Boyer, Reginald Owen, and Alan Marshall.158 This film represents one of the earliest but repeated expressions of interest from Hollywood filmmakers in the life of Napoleon and such interest may stem from the fact that Napoleon “ended the public trading of Jews, Moors and Turks in Malta in the late 1790s.159 During this same period he “liberated many of the Italian ghettos, [with] French troops, young Jews and local enthusiasts tearing down the crumbling old walls with their bare hands.”160 As France’s First Consul, Napoleon also “tried hard to bring the Jews into society . . . as solid citizens.”161 In effect, Napoleon attempted to solve the so-called “Jewish problem” in Europe,162 thus, for many, he was a legitimate Jewish hero. Nurse Edith Cavell (RKO — 1939) was the 2nd movie version of the “story of a British nurse executed as a spy during World War I”163 and the second nurse biopic of the 30’s decade. Nurse Cavell “remained in Brussels after the German occupation (1915) to help smuggle Allied troops to the Dutch border. She was caught by the Germans and executed.”164 Her life was “previously filmed in 1930 as Dawn with Sybil Thorndike.”165 The script for the 1939 version was written by Michael Hogan. The Irish-born Herbert Wilcox directed. The film starred Anna Neagle, George Sanders, May Robson, Edna May Oliver and Alan Marshal.166 In the ’30s, Hollywood’s portrayals of women as subjects for motion picture biographies fell into six narrow categories: European royalty, nurse, mistress, Western gun-toting entertainer, a lady spy who used sex as a weapon and a woman obsessed with money. Doctors — Another category of biopics appearing in the ’30s portrayed doctors. All three of these films were released in the same year, 1936. The Prisoner of Shark Island (TCF) was directed by John Ford (of Irish background)167 for 20\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\nproducer Darryl F. Zanuck. The film told the “[t]rue story of the doctor who innocently set Booth’s injured leg after the Lincoln assassination.” According to Steven Scheuer, the “doctor was given a prejudiced trial and sent to Shark Island.”168 The film once again focuses on the preferred Hollywood theme of the wrongfully accused. The film starred Warner Baxter, Gloria Stuart, Joyce Kay, Claude Gilingwater, Douglas Wood, Harry Carey, Paul Fix and John Carradine.169 In the 20th Century-Fox release The Country Doctor (1936) a “rural physician becomes famous when quintuplets are born to one of his patients.” The film is a “[f]ictionalization of the birth of the Dionne Quintuplets.” Henry King directed for producer Darryl F. Zanuck. The film starred Jean Hersholt, the Dionne Quins, Dorothy Petersen, June Lang, Slim Summerville, Michael Whalen and Robert Barrat.170 A sequel appeared later in the same year (Reunion) and another in 1938 (Five of a Kind). In Reunion (also TCF), the “doctor retires, [and] the townsfolk reunite him with many of the children he has brought into the world.” This film was the “second attempt [in one year] to cash in on the Dionne Quintuplets.” It was directed by Norman Taurog for producer Darryl Zanuck. The script was written by Sam Hellman, Gladys Lehman and Sonya Levien. The film starred Jean Hersholt, Rochelle Hudson, Helen Vinson, Slim Summerville, Jewish actor J. Edward Bromberg,171 and Sara Haden.172 Miners — The Hollywood biopic list for the ’30s provided two films portraying miners (people who struck it rich mining in the West) as their primary subjects. In 1932, Silver Dollar starred Jewish actor Edward G. Robinson (Emanuel Goldenberg),173 Bebe Daniels, Aline MacMahon and Robert Warrick in a biopic “about the man (H.A.W. Tabor) who helped change a mining town into a major city, Denver, Colorado.”174 The Warner Bros. release told the story of a “poor farmer (who) goes to Colorado for the gold rush, strikes it rich and learns that money doesn’t bring happiness.” Alfred E. Green directed.175 This movie reminds us that all movies communicate messages of one sort or another. Consequently, whoever has the power to determine which movies will be produced and distributed to the vast majority of Americans has the power to determine which messages are going to be communicated through this powerful communications medium (see Patterns of Bias in Hollywood Movies). Certain patterns of bias are also apparent from this review of motion picture biographies, and again, such biases tend to mirror the values, interests, cultural perspectives and prejudices of the filmmakers (including the studio executives who have green-light authority). In 1936, Sutter’s Gold (Universal) told the story of “an immigrant [who] has to fight for his rights when [during the California gold rush] a strike 21\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nstarts on his land.” The film was directed by James Cruze. It starred Edward Arnold, Lee Tracy, Binnie Barnes, Katherine Alexander, Addison Richards, Montagu Love and John Miljan.176 In addition, to focusing on the miner as a subject, this film becomes part of another Hollywood favored theme, stories about immigrants. Most of the Hollywood moguls were either immigrants or the direct descendants of recent immigrants. Journalists — Hollywood also provided two portrayals of journalists in its motion picture biographies that decade. In the 1938 20th Century-Fox release Five of a Kind, “[t]wo reporters compete for the best stories about the Dionne Quintuplets. This film was the third effort to exploit the famous quints, then four years old”; thus the journalist angle seemed to be more of an excuse to exploit the quintuplets once again. The script was written by Lou Breslow and John Patrick. It was directed by New York city-born Herbert I. Leeds and starred Jean Hersholt, Claire Trevor, Cesar Romero, Slim Summerville and Henry Wilcoxon.177 A slightly more substantive portrayal of a journalist came with the 1939 20th Century-Fox release of Stanley and Livingstone, although the film was actually about the search for a missionary-explorer. In this film, “the intrepid (British) journalist Henry M. Stanley . . . goes [to Africa] searching for {Scottish] missionary-explorer David Livingstone.”178 The script was written by New York-born Philip Dunne and Julien Josephson. Virginia-born Henry King directed for producer Kenneth MacGowan. The film starred Spencer Tracy, Cedric Hardwicke, Richard Greene, Nancy Kelly and Walter Brennan. Religious Figures — Hollywood also offered a pair of biopics in the ’30s focusing on religious figures. The 1935 UA release Cardinal Richelieu told of the “plots and intrigues of the wily cardinal, the power behind the throne of France.”179 Halliwell’s called the film a “[f]ictionalized biography of the unscrupulous cardinal who was the grey eminence behind Louis XIII.”180 Judah Gribetz reports that “[u]nder the influence of Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII dismisse[d] . . . charges of Judaism against New Christians in France”; and that during “this half-century French crypto-Jews”* were able “to practice Judaism more openly.”181 Thus, he may be considered a legitimate Jewish hero by many. Ohio-born Rowland V. Lee directed for 20th CenturyFox producer Darryl F. Zanuck. The film starred George Arliss, Maureen O’Sullivan, Edward Arnold and Cesar Romero.182 MGM’s 1938 film Boys Town (MGM) told the “story of Father Flanagan and his school for juvenile delinquents.”183 The film includes portrayals of two Jewish characters, “Sidney Miller . . . plays a tenement delinquent . . . named Mo Kahn.” However, according to Patricia Erens, “the more * According to Wigoder (p. 249), Crypto-Jews are “[p]ersons who, while outwardly professing another religion (generally adopted by themselves or their ancestors under compulsion), continue to adhere secretly to Judaism.”\n\n22\n\nCones, John W..

Biopics of the 1930s\n\ninteresting Jewish character is David Morris (played by Henry Hull), a skeptical pawnbroker who provides the money to help Father Flanagan (Spencer Tracy) found Boys Town in Omaha, Nebraska.”184 The script was written by the Canadian-born John Meehan and Dore Schary (described by Gabler as “a committed Jew”)185 Chicago-born Norman Taurog directed for producer John W. Considine, Jr. The film also featured Mickey Rooney (born Joe Yule, Jr. in Brooklyn) and Gene Reynolds. Writers — The 30’s saw the beginning of a long-standing Hollywood preference to feature writers as subjects of motion picture biographies, offering two such biopics for the decade. In the 1934 release The Barretts of Wimpole Street (MGM), an “[i]nvalid Elizabeth Barrett plans to marry poet Robert Browning, against her tyrannical father’s wishes.”186 According to Judah Gribetz, the “writings of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra influence[d] the English poet, Robert Browning (1812–1889)” and Browning’s “most famous poem” focused “on a Jewish theme.” Gribetz also reports that Browning was “strongly sympathetic to the Jews.”187 The film was directed by Sidney Franklin. It starred Norma Shearer, (who had converted to Judaism when she married Jewish producer Irving Thalberg in 1927),188 Fredric March, Charles Laughton, Maureen O’Sullivan, Katherine Alexander and Una O’Connor. Shearer’s Jewish husband Irving Thalberg189 produced. The story was also retold, once again on film, in a 1957 remake. Then in 1937, the Warner Bros. release the Life of Emile Zola starred Jewish actor Paul Muni190 as a continuation of the falsely accused theme. In this film, the Jewish actor Joseph Schildkraut191 played “the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus.” The German-born William Dieterle again directed for producer Henry Blanke. As Paul Johnson reports on the historical incident, the inquiries of the French Jewish writer Bernard Lazare192 into the Dreyfus matter convinced writer Emile Zola that “Dreyfus was innocent and the victim of a frame-up. At the end of 1896 (Lazare) . . . published, in Brussels, a pamphlet” raising “the anti-Semitic issue for the first time on the Jewish side . . . To Lazare, Dreyfus was the archetype Jewish martyr.” The “nonJewish radical . . . Zola, then France’s most popular writer . . . investigated the [Dreyfus] case, wrote an enormous article in defense of Dreyfus and gave it to the rising politician Georges Clemenceau, who ran the story on the front page of his “liberal paper . . . under the headline ‘J’Accuse!’ That was the real beginning of the Dreyfus affair . . . Four days later anti-Semitic riots broke out . . . The army, asked to admit it had made a mistake refused and closed ranks . . . Zola was tried and had to flee the country . . . The Dreyfus affair convulsed France for an entire decade . . . The left [then] won an overwhelming electoral success in 1906.” Ultimately, “Dreyfus was rehabilitated and made a general.”193 23\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nAccording to Patricia Erens, Dreyfus is only identified as a Jew in the film through an entry in a ledger. She also points out that Warner Bros. totally evaded “the anti-Semitic sentiments that motivated the Dreyfus case.” Erens further observes that one of the themes of the film, which will appear again in later movies, is that of the Jewish character providing “the means whereby Gentile characters hone their spiritual soul.”194 Miscellaneous European Occupations — In the ’30s, Hollywood also offered seven more biopics focusing on the lives of Europeans of various occupations, including explorer, scientist, empire builder, philosopher, engineer, banker and romantic. All were men. European Philosopher — In 1933 Warner Bros. (a studio controlled by the four Jewish Warner brothers)195 released the film Voltaire. It portrayed the “life and times of the 18th-century French wit.”196 Judah Gribetz describes Voltaire as “the French philosopher and leading critic of European society before the French Revolution” who, in his “Complete Works,” purportedly made the very anti-Semitic statement regarding Jews: “We find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people, who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched.”197 Without benefit of seeing the actual film, it cannot be determined from the available reviews, whether the portrayal of Voltaire in this movie was favorable or not, but it does not appear likely. John Adolfi directed the film for producer Ray Griffith. The film starred George Arliss, Doris Kenyon, Margaret Lindsay, Reginald Owen, Alan Mowbray, and David Torrence. The script was written by Paul Green. European Bankers—In 1934, 20th Century-Fox/UA released The House of Rothschild. This film is described by critic Steven Scheuer as “[y]our basic boring Arliss (actor George Arliss) historical vehicle with the stagy ham being his wily self . . . Loretta Young as his daughter, Robert Young as her suitor, (Boris) Karloff as the villain, and the Napoleonic wars.”198 The film provides the “chronicles of the famous [European-based Jewish] banking family199 at the time of the Napoleonic Wars.”200 According to Patricia Erens this movie, “more than any other film of the period, confronts Old World anti-Semitism and depicts the long history of German hatred toward the Jew.”201 Albert L. Weker directed for Jewish producer William Goetz202 and Raymond Griffith. C. Aubrey Smith and Arthur Byron also appeared in the film. It is disingenuous indeed for anyone to suggest that such films were being made because that’s what American audiences demanded or wanted. It would be much more honest for the Hollywood establishment to admit that movies do tend, to a large extent, to mirror the values, interests, cultural perspectives and prejudices of their makers, and that because (as pointed 24\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter 2. Biopics of the 1930s\n\nout in the study Who Really Controls Hollywood) this cinematic institution has been controlled for its approximate 100-year history by a small group of politically liberal, not very religious, Jewish males of European heritage, the shared backgrounds of such individuals has in fact influenced their choice of movies over the years. Thus, in order to bring more balance to the ideas and subjects being presented through this important communications medium, it is essential that greater diversity be brought about at all levels in the film community, particularly at the top. European Romantic — That same year (1934), Darryl F. Zanuck produced Affairs of Cellini as a combined 20th Century-Fox and United Artists project. The film portrays the “complex amours of a 16th-century Florentine rake.”203 Gregory La Cava directed. The film starred Fredric March, Constance Bennett, Frank Morgan (originally Francis Phillip Wupperman),204 Fay Wray, Vince Barnett, Louis Calhern and Jessie Ralph. European/British in India — Another 20th Century-Fox production released by United Artists in 1935, Clive of India, told of the “life of the 18thcentury (British) empire builder, with special emphasis on his marriage.”205 The film also explores the “British empire’s adventures in exotic India.”206 Richard Boleslawski (born in Warsaw) directed for Jewish producer William Goetz,207 along with Darryl F. Zanuck and Raymond Griffith. The film starred Ronald Coleman, Loretta Young, Colin Clive, Francis Lister, Montagu Love, Robert Greig, Leo G. Carroll, C. Aubrey Smith and Mischa Auer (originally Mischa Ounskowski, from Russia).208 European Scientist — The following year, 1936, Warner Bros. released The Story of Louis Pasteur. The film tells “[h]ow the eminent 19th-century French scientist overcomes obstacles in finding cures for various diseases.”209 According to Dr. Geoffrey Wigoder the “profoundly religious . . . Jewish bacteriologist . . . Waldemar Mordecai Wolff Haffkine (from Odessa, Russia) actually discovered the . . . serum against cholera and bubonic plague . . . while working . . . at the Pasteur Institute” in Paris.210 The reviews of the film do not make it clear whether a Mordecai character appeared in the film. The German-born William Dieterle directed for German-born producer Henry Blanke. The film starred Jewish actor Paul Muni (Weisenfreund) who was originally from Austria,211 Josephine Hutchison, Anita Louise, Donald Woods, Fritz Leiber, Henry O’Neil, Porter Hall, Jewish actor Akim Tamiroff212 and Walter Kingsford.213 European Explorer — In the 1938 UA release The Adventures of Marco Polo (UA), the “medieval Italian (Venetian) explorer discovers China, fireworks, and a beautiful maiden.”214 Wigoder reports that the explorer made reference in his writings “to a Jewish community in China”215 and that the Catalan Atlas, an important work of cartography” was prepared in 1376 by Jewish 25\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nMotion Picture Biographies\n\nmap makers “Abraham and Judah Crescas in Spain using data provided by Marco Polo.” The script for the film was written by New York-born Robert E. Sherwood for Jewish producer Samuel Goldwyn (Gelbfisz).216 Another New York native, Archie Mayo directed. The film starred Gary Cooper, Sigrid Gurie, Basil Rathbone and Ernest Truex. European Engineer — The 1938 20th Century-Fox release Suez portrayed the “career of French engineer [and diplomat] Ferdinand de Lesseps, who [supervised the construction of] . . . the Suez Canal.”217 As noted earlier, the British Prime Minister Disraeli [of Jewish heritage]218 was instrumental in getting the canal built (see earlier discussion of the 1929 film Disraeli). Thus, this film represents the 2nd time the Hollywood film community has portrayed this important event in film. The script for Suez was written by New York-born Philip Dunne and Julien Josephson. Canadian-born Allan Dwan directed for producer Gene Markey. The film starred Tyrone Power, Annabella, Loretta Young, Hungarian-born Jewish actor J. Edward Bromberg219 and Jewish actor Joseph Schildkraut.220 Miscellaneous U.S. Occupations — Finally, Hollywood portrayed six additional U.S. occupations or “roles” in its motion picture biography slate for the decade of the ’30s, including sportsman/millionaire, Wall Street financier, boxer, inventor, military figure and Native American leader. Again, all were men. Sportsman/Millionaire — In 1935, Universal’s Diamond Jim provided a “fantasia on the life of the nineties millionaire (sportsman and man-abouttown ‘Diamond Jim’ Brady) who sailed pretty close to the wind in business, adored (American comic opera star) Lillian Russell, and developed a gargantuan appetite”221 for food. A. Edward Sutherland directed for producer Edmund Grainger. The film starred Edward Arnold, Jean Arthur, Binnie Barnes, Cesar Romero and Eric Blore.222 Wall Street Financier — In The Toast of New York (RKO–1937) “[a] 19thcentury medicine showman [Jim Fisk] becomes a notorious Wall Street Financier.”223 Fisk was the “American railroad financier and speculator who attempted in 1869 to corner the gold market with Jay Gould leading to Black Friday, a day of nationwide panic.”224 The film was directed by Ohio native Rowland V. Lee for New York-born producer Edward Small. It starred Edward Arnold, Cary Grant, Frances Farmer, Jack Oakie, Donald Meek, Clarence Kolb and Thelma Leeds. Athlete/Boxer — That same year (1937), the little known film Keep Punching showcased “boxer Henry Armstrong”“225 who along with Joe Louis is mentioned by Howard Sachar as the only two boxers to outrank the “preeminent Jewish boxer of the 1930s,” Barney Ross (Barnet Rosofsky).226 Inventor — In the final year of the 1930s, 20th Century-Fox released The Story of Alexander Graham Bell, in which the “inventor of the telephone marries 26\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing. All rights reserved.\n\nChapter 2. Biopics of the 1930s\n\na deaf girl.”227 Wigoder credits the Jewish U.S. inventor Emile Berliner with refining Bell’s newly invented telephone and making it “practical for longdistance use.”228 The script for the film was written by Georgia-born Lamar Trotti. New York-born Irving Cummings directed for producer Kenneth MacGowan. The film starred Don Ameche, Henry Fonda, Loretta Young, Charles Coburn and Gene Lockhart. Military Figure/Texan — Also in 1939, Man of Conquest presents the “story of Sam Houston, soldier, statesman, hero of Texas.”229 This film appears to represent one of the rare exceptions to the Hollywood tendency to portray most things Southern in a negative or stereotypical manner (see the chapter “Hollywood’s Rape of the South” in Patterns of Bias in Hollywood Movies). The script was written by Wells Root and E. E. Paramore, Jr. George Nicholls, Jr. directed for New York-born producer Sol C. Siegel. The film starred Richard Dix, Joan Fontaine, Gail Patrick, Edward Ellis and Victor Jory.230 Native American Leader — In the 1939 Paramount release Geronimo, the “seventh cavalry gives the Indians a run for their money.” New York-born Paul H. Slone wrote and directed. The film starred Ellen Drew, Preston Foster, Andy Devine (born Jeremiah Schwartz),231 Gene Lockhart, Ralph Morgan and William Henry.232 As noted earlier, the most obvious Hollywood preference expressed through its biopics during the decade of the ’30s was the emphasis on European subjects. Hollywood also demonstrated a clear preference for male subjects as opposed to women. In fact, except for European royalty, only five other occupational categories featured women. In addition, two of those were in service of men (nurses during war and mistress). Another was for entertaining, presumably both male and female audiences. The fourth used sex to get information from men and the fifth had a severe character flaw: she was obsessed with money. Other than the U.S. and Europe, the settings for this body of ’30s biopics were very limited. Cleopatra was the only film set in the Middle-East and Africa (areas of the world nearest Europe). Another, Stanley and Livingstone, featured two Europeans in Africa. Still another, (Suez) focused on a European’s contribution to the construction of the Suez Canal. In The Adventures of Marco Polo, a European discovers China, and Clive of India, featured a European in India. Finally, Mexico was the only other country serving as a setting for the ’30s biopics, but again, the story (Viva Villa!) was directly related to Pancho Villa’s activities in or influence on the U.S. Thus, none of the Hollywood biopic offerings for the ’30s could completely remove themselves from the ambit of the U.S. or Europe. A pattern of heavy Jewish involvement also emerged in the ’30s biopics with at least 38 of the 67 films (57%) containing some important Jewishrelated element (i.e., subject, hero, character, studio executive, producer, director, writer, actor/actress, historical connection or some combination thereof). 27\n\nCones, John W..

Motion Picture Biographies of the 1940s Hollywood produced or released some 96 biopics in the ’40s, substantially more than its 67 biopics of the ’30s. Some of the previously established trends in biographical motion pictures produced or released by Hollywood film entities, changed dramatically in the 1940s. Others remained persistent (see further discussion at end of chapter). The emphasis on European subjects and settings, although still higher than any other part of the world (other than the U.S.), was decisively replaced by U.S. subjects and settings in the 1940’s biopics. Out of a total of 96 biopics of the ’40s, 21 were about European subjects or settings. In addition, the popularity among Hollywood filmmakers of the motion picture biographies of the lives of European Royalty dropped from 13 to 2. The new leader for ’40s biopics was the entertainer category. Entertainers were featured in 28 motion picture biographies of the 1940s (29%). Western figures came in at a distant second with 14. Athletes, political figures/issues and criminal figures then followed in order. Entertainers — In the first year of the 1940s, the film Lillian Russell (TCF) told of the “life and loves of the famous nineties entertainer”233 who was originally from Iowa and was born Helen Louise Leonard. “Her early training in voice and violin was supplemented by a year of opera study in New York City under (the Jewish musician and violinist)234 Leopold Damrosch.”235 The script for the film was written by William Anthony McGuire. New York-born Irving Cummings directed for producer Gene Markey. The film starred Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Edward Arnold, Warren William, Henry Fonda, Helen Westley and Dorothy Peterson.236 Also in 1940, The Lady With Red Hair (Warner Bros.) presented the “life of actress Mrs. Leslie Carter and her association with Jewish237 impresario David 29\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing.

German-born Curtis Bernhardt (who had emigrated to France when the Nazis came to power and then to Hollywood in 1940)239 directed for producer Edmund Grainger. The film starred Miriam Hopkins, Claude Rains, Richard Ainley, John Litel, Laura Hope Crews, Helen Westly and Fritz Leiber. The following year, in the 1941 UA release The Great Awakening (aka New Wine), Franz Schubert “seeks the patronage of Beethoven and sacrifices his love life to music.”240 Franz Peter Schubert was an “Austrian composer who perfected the form of the German art song in his more than 600 compositions for voice and piano. He also composed symphonies and chamber music.”241 The German composer Ludwig van Beethoven was considered the “greatest composer of his day.”242 These were the “good Germans” that Custen talked about in his book. The script for the film was written by Howard Estabrook and Nicholas Jory. German-born Reinhold Schunzel directed. The film starred Alan Curtis, Ilona Massey, Albert Basserman, Binnie Barnes and Sterling Holloway. Also in 1941, the Warner release The Man Who Came to Dinner presented a “caricature of Alexander Woollcott,” the drama critic who contributed regularly to the New Yorker magazine and was a member “of the famed literary ‘Round table’ at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City.”243 In the film, the “acid-tongue radio celebrity (and American drama critic and journalist) breaks his hip while on a lecture tour, and terrorizes the inhabitants of the suburban home where he must stay for several weeks.”244 The script was written by Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein. Philadelphia-born William Keighley directed for producers Jack Saper and New York-born Jewish producer Jerome Irving “Jerry” Wald.245 The film starred Monty Woolley, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan and Jewish performer Jimmy Durante.246 In 1942, the 20th Century-Fox release My Gal Sal presented the “career and romances of (Gay Nineties) songwriter Paul Dreiser.” The script was written by Seton I. Miller, Darrell Ware and Karl Tunberg (originally from Washington state). New York-born Irving Cummings directed for producer Robert Bassler. The film starred Rita Hayworth, Victor Mature, John Sutton, Carole Landis, James Gleason, Jewish actor Phil Silvers,247 Walter Catlett, Mona Maris and Frank Orth.248 The next year, 1943, Is Everybody Happy? (Columbia) was a remake of the 1929 Warner Bros. release of the same name, and again “[b]ased on the career of [‘Jewish performer’249 and] band leader Ted Lewis.” The film “tells of the ups and downs of [the Ted Lewis jazz band].250 To this point in the history of Hollywood motion picture biographies, only two films had been produced about an American band leader. Both focused on the life of the 30\n\nCones, John W.. Motion Picture Biographies : The Hollywood Spin on Historical Figures, Algora Publishing, 2015. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2015. Algora Publishing.

Clearly, a large number of better known big-band leaders of the era had to be overlooked to re-do the story of Ted Lewis on the screen. The script was written by Monte Brice. California native Charles Barton directed. The film starred Lewis, Jewish actor Larry Parks (Samuel Lawrence Klausman Parks),251 Michael Duane and Nan Wynn.252 The 1943 Paramount release Dixie portrayed “the life of old-time minstrel man Dan Emmett,” the Ohio-born composer of “Dixie’s Land,” the song which became the unofficial anthem of the (Confederate) rebellion.”253 Steven Scheuer described the film as “fictitious.”254 The script was written by Karl Tunberg (originally from Washington state) and Darrell Ware. London-born A. Edward Sutherland directed for producer Paul Jones. The film starred Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour, Marjorie Reynolds and Lynne Overman.255 Also in 1943, Yankee Doodle Dandy (Warner Bros.) told the “life story of dancing vaudevillian George M. Cohan”256 who was formerly married to “Jewish vaudeville star Ethel Levey.”257 The script was written by Virginiaborn Robert Buckner and Edmund Joseph. Jewish director Michael Curtiz258 directed for Jewish producer Hal B. Wallis259 and William Cagney. The film starred James Cagney, Joan Leslie, Walter Huston, Rosemary de Camp, Richard Whorf, George Tobias, Jeanne Cagney, Irene Manning and S.Z. Sakall. The next year (1944), Shine On, Harvest Moon (Warner Bros.) portrayed the “life and times of (Jewish) vaudeville singer Nora Bayes (originally Dora Goldberg).”260 The script was written by Sam Hellman and Richard Weil and Francis Swan and James Kern. San Francisco-born David Butler directed for producer William Jacobs. The film starred Ann Sheridan, Dennis Morgan, Jack Carson, Irene Manning, S.Z. Sakall, Marie Wilson and Robert Shayne.261 Also in 1944, Irish Eyes Are Smiling (TCF) presented the “life and times of a nineties songwriter, Ernest R. Ball. The script was written by Earl Baldwin, John Tucker Battle. The Russian-born Gregory Ratoff (who also performed with the Yiddish Players in New York)262 directed for producer Damon Runyon. The film starred Dick Haymes, June Haver, Monty Woolley, Anthony Quinn, Beverly Whitney, Jewish actor Maxie Rosenbloom,263 Boston-born Veda Ann Borg and Clarence Kolb.264 At mid-decade, the Warner Bros. release Rhapsody in Blue (1945) starred Robert Alda, Jewish actor Oscar Levant,265 Charles Coburn and Alexis Smith in the life story of the “famous Jewish composer” George Gershwin. The film, however, “hardly” mentions “the composer’s ethnic background.”266 In addition, according to Halliwell’s, the film is “[n]o more trustworthy on factual matters than other Hollywood biopics of its era.”267 The script\n\n31\n\nCones, John W..

Lasky.268 The 1945 20th Century-Fox release The Dolly Sisters portrayed the “lives of a Hungarian sister act in American vaudeville.”269 The film “featured S.Z.
