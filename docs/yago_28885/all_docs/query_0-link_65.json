        "text": "Maximilian I of Mexico 6 July 1832 – 19 June 1867) was an Austrian archduke who reigned as the only Emperor of the Second Mexican Empire from 10 April 1864 until his execution on 19 June 1867. A younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Maximilian had a distinguished career as commander-in-chief of the Imperial Austrian Navy.\n\nQuotes about Maximilian I of Mexico\n\n[edit]\n\nWill make good soldiers, very devoted to the government of Emperor Maximilian.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), An imperial crown for Maximilian. Le Journal de Bruxelles, 25 april 1864.\n\nThe enterprise that Archduke Maximilian will attempt remains what it was on the first day, an adventure where, besides a lot of energy, tact and resources, we must add a lot of happiness to succeed.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), An imperial crown for Maximilian. The liberal opinion had its reservations. After all, it was a democratic and liberal regime that had been overthrown by the French to be replaced by a monarchy. They did not share the Catholic belief that religion would have such a positive effect on the establishment of the empire. The expedition was seen as a venture that had a chance of success, but which would require a lot of luck. Le Journal de Bruxelles, 25 april 1864.\n\nWill you believe that I am not convinced that all the Mexican debt holders will be paid, that the Archduke will obtain from the Holy Father a concordat which satisfies the faith of the bishops and the population, that the silver mines will pay floods of this precious metal in the coffers of the emperor, that the Mexicans will become good and placid bourgeois like the Tyroleans of Brixen or Botrena.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), An imperial crown for Maximilian. L’ Echo du Parlement, 9 april 1864.\n\nIt is claimed that it was the Archduchess Charlotte who determined her husband's final acceptance. The princess is young, beautiful, lively, and the noble ambition to wear a crown and found a dynasty would have seduced her.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), An imperial crown for Maximilian. There were rumors about the influence that Charlotte would have exerted on Maximilian's decision to accept the throne. Le Journal de Bruxelles, 16 april 1864.\n\nWhatever opinion one forms of the enterprise to which Archduke Maximilian has just devoted his life, it is not possible for us Belgians to forget that the princess who shares the destinies of the new emperor is also the beloved daughter of our king, that she grew up among us, that our homeland is her own, and that she has the right to count on the sympathies and the wishes of her compatriots .\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), Belgian volunteers for their princess On March 24, 1864, the formation of a Belgo-Mexican Volunteer Legion was announced. Immediately positions were taken. The Liberals supported the formation of the regiment despite their doubts about the establishment of the Empire. The legion could also count on Catholic support, albeit with some reservations. However, others immediately launched a campaign against the formation of the legion. L’ Indépendance Belge, 25 maart 1864.\n\nIt is understandable that a colonial establishment organized under such conditions cannot fail to prosper. We are also convinced that the example of the Empress' s guards will be followed by a large number of our compatriots who, trusting with reason in the new situation in Mexico, will take advantage of all this set of circumstances so exceptionally advantageous, to to go bring the contribution of their arms and their intelligence to the beautiful work of civilization undertaken by the emperor Maximilian and the empress Charlotte, his august companion.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes.

L’ Indépendance Belge, 25 maart 1864.\n\nIt is not likely that such an important and energetic step could be taken without great results for his rule and his popularity. At the moment we are hardly in a position to judge the success and extent of it, but it certainly contains within itself the means to regenerate Mexico. The first problem that the new emperor will now have to solve will be that of satisfying the Liberal Party without alienating the affection of the Church.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), The New Throne, Catholic Opposition L’ Echo du Parlement, 5 februari 1865.\n\nThis is how the Mexican Empire will perish, a creation based on the assumption of a southern triumph and which today finds itself singularly compromised by the opposite result. Even with a president less democratic than Mr. Johnson, the United States would never have tolerated the establishment at its gates of an absolute monarchy under the rule of a foreign dynasty. The misfortunes of the civil war did not allow them to oppose it when the facts were unfolding. Perhaps in order to avoid a war with France they will not attack the new order of things directly, but certainly they would do nothing to support it, and the disbandment of their armies will provide them with all the desirable means to overthrow it indirectly.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), The New Throne, Catholic Opposition The attitude of the United States was seen as crucial in Belgian opinion. And the reports about this became more hostile, no one doubted that the United States supported Juarez. Which would be one of the major reasons for Maximilian's fall. L’ Indépendance Belge, 18 mei 1865.\n\nHow did Emperor Maximilian spoil such a beautiful position in such a short time? He had been called in hatred of the Jewish liberals and acclaimed by the Catholics, who form the overwhelming majority of Mexicans, and he had nothing more in a hurry than to upset the Catholics and display sentiments of this false liberalism which can destroy, who cannot build anything.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), The Tumbling Throne the Catholics saw no future for the Empire. The blame was placed on Maximilian's church policy. He had forfeited the wonderful opportunity that had been given to establish his empire. Le Bien Public, 19 juni 1866.\n\nSacrified, betrayed, sold, Maximilian, whatever mistakes he made, deserves pity on his fate.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), Queretaro: The Bloody End of the Empire The news of the fall of Queretaro sparked a new wave of speculation about Maximilian's situation. It was sometimes assumed that he had been exiled from Mexico and on his way to Europe. Other reports said he was dying from injuries sustained while ingesting Queretaro. All the newspapers had one thing in common, none of them wanted Maximilian's execution. Le Bien Public, 27 juni 1867.\n\nWe can only judge the fact in itself and this fact is deplorable, even less for the man who was its victim than for the cause which made him a martyr. His life was shattered; to continue her existence with the remorse and humiliation with which she would have been filled was the most cruel punishment that could be inflicted on her. We cannot say that his execution is a crime, but it is undoubtedly a political fault, like all extreme and violent acts, and what Republican Mexico will believe to have gained in security, it will lose in sympathy and in consideration. Despite the precedent of the condemnable decree against the Juarists, the republic will hardly wash away this cold spilled blood more than a month after the capture of this unfortunate prince. This sad fact will be rightly invoked and unfortunately exploited against the government of Juarez and those who will succeed it.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), Queretaro: The Bloody End of the Empire All the hopes expressed and petitions to Juarez could not change the fact that Maximilian was already dead. This was also announced in Europe at the beginning of July via a telegram sent by the commander of the Elizabeth, the Austrian ship off the Mexican coast. It was reported that Maximilian had been executed and that Juarez also refused to release his body. The news sparked a storm of protest. L’ Indépendance Belge, 4 juli 1867.\n\nMaximilian fought like a hero, suffered like a hero and died a hero.\n\nThe Mexican adventure of Maximilian and Charlotte through Belgian eyes. The Mexican Empire in the Newspaper Press (1864-1867). (Wim Bouw), Queretaro: The Bloody End of the Empire Le Bien Public branded the execution as murder and Juarez as an ignoble bandit. Maximilian, on the other hand, was seen as a hero.
