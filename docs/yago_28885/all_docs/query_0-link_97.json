        "text": "Chapultepec Castle is one of the most historic architectural monuments in our country, and it is the only royal castle on the continent; it was the home of the second emperor of Mexico: Maximilian of Habsburg and his wife Charlotte of Belgium.\n\nNapoleon III and Eugenia de Montijo sent the couple a series of objects to transform the Imperial Castle. And although several of these objects are currently in the National History Museum, we can still see traces of the emperors in Chapultepec, which holds more than 75,000 historical objects.\n\nAfter the triumphant entry of Juárez, the instruction was given that all objects that belonged to the archduke should be sold, in order to obtain money; the order was turned on July 15, 1867. What was not sold was used by the republican government.\n\nToday you can see Carlota's room, in gold and blue colors, it was decorated with tapestries, carpets, tableware and European ornaments. When Maximilian left Mexico City in anticipation of the end of his government in late 1866, he ordered the dismantling of his palaces. A long history of losses and reunions began. The French Boulle style bedroom shown here was acquired by President Manuel González, who believed it belonged to Carlota. Maximilian's brass bed and other objects were part of the furniture abandoned in the Castle after his death.\n\nLikewise, you can see the bathroom made up of a marble tub, which was made especially for Charlotte by Atilio Tangassi and cost 200 pesos at the time. In the tearoom you can see sculptures of fauns, nymphs and satyrs, 19th century French chairs and armchairs, a Louis XV style display cabinet made by the famous French cabinetmaker François Linke. The tapestries that decorate some of the rooms of the Alcázar are reproductions made from original fragments and they show the crowned eagle and the slogan: “Equity in justice”.\n\nIn the music room there is the Louis XV-style hazelnut wood room that Napoleon III presented to Maximilian, and scenes from the fables written by Jean de La Fontaine are reproduced in Aubusson's gobelin tapestries. The pianos, one English and one French in yellow from the Collard & Collard brand, on the sides and on the cover have their monogram: MIM and was a gift from Napoleon for the emperor's 33rd birthday.\n\nIn the reading room there is an alabaster vase with the coat of arms of Maximilian's empire in relief, a bust of Jean de La Fontaine and two 19th century French sculptures, this room is a recreation of the reading cabinet that the emperor could have had.\n\nThere is also the daily carriage of Maximilian and Carlota, although it was later used by President Juárez and there is also the gala carriage of the emperors, which the citizens of Lombardy-Venice presented to Maximilian. The interior of the carriage is upholstered in silk and velvet, and according to the records of the National History Museum, it was used only twice."
