        "text": "Detail from Albert Grafle’s portrait of Charlotte of Belgium as Empress of Mexico, ca. 1860s (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nI’ve received numerous excited messages from readers about the recent royal jewel news out of Switzerland: the “discovery” of a suite of emerald and diamond jewelry that belonged to Princess Charlotte of Belgium, who is perhaps better known to history as Empress Carlota of Mexico.\n\nCharlotte and Maxmilian in 1857, the year they married (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe jewels come from the collection of Princess Charlotte of Belgium, the only daughter of King Leopold I of Belgium. (That makes her, of course, a first cousin of both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert; she was named for her father’s first wife, the tragic Princess Charlotte of Wales.) She became first Archduchess Charlotte of Austria and then Empress Carlota of Mexico during her marriage to Archduke Maximilian, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. The couple married in 1857, and less than a decade later, Emperor Napoleon III decided to tap Maximilian to become the first Emperor of Mexico. (Long story very short: the French had invaded Mexico in 1861, and they wanted to make the nation a sort of French North American satellite state, with the country remaining under French control via Maximilian.)\n\nThe newly-rediscovered parure: (clockwise from top left) hair comb, tiara (upside down), necklace, and brooch (SKKG)\n\nAccording to the Stiftung für Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte (SKKG), the jewelry set was a gift to Charlotte from Maximilian. The suite as presently composed consists of four coordinating pieces: a tiara (or diadem) with a matching hair comb, meant to be worn together as a set; a necklace; and a large brooch. The SKKG writes that the “89 emeralds alone weigh 400 carats.” The entire parure features design elements typical of the Second Empire period. The SKKG notes that the tiara is particularly grand, possibly as a way to underline “the empress’s claim to power.” They also suggest that the choice of emeralds wasn’t a random one, as the color is a prominent part of the Mexican tricolor flag.\n\nSantiago Rebull’s portrait of Empress Carlota, 1867 (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nCharlotte may have worn the set even before she set off for Mexico. In her 2014 biography of Maximilian and Charlotte, M.M. McAllen notes that the couple “were received with the highest state of honors and given an opulent reception and dinner at the imperial palace of the Hofburg” in Vienna before traveling to Mexico. She writes that “Carlota wore a diamond and emerald tiara designed for her new rank in Mexico” at that dinner. The jewels may have gained even greater significance once the couple arrived in Mexico. According to their article, the SKKG believes that the new Empress Carlota may have worn the parure for her coronation in Mexico City in 1864. Unfortunately, despite these glittering references, I haven’t found a photograph or painting of Charlotte wearing the emerald parure.\n\nAlbert Grafle’s portrait of Charlotte of Belgium as Empress of Mexico, ca. 1860s (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMaximilian and Charlotte’s reign in Mexico was both brief and disastrous. The French were still battling Republican forces all over the country, and by 1866, they packed up their military might and headed back to Europe. Charlotte too headed back to Europe, hoping to drum up support for her husband. (She packed her jewelry in her luggage.) Napoleon III reportedly tried to convince Maxmilian to evacuate as well, but he refused, and he was captured and executed.\n\nCharlotte as Empress of Mexico (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAfter Maximilian’s death, Charlotte was understandably depressed and anxious, constantly afraid that she was being targeted by people who also wanted to hurt her. Psychiatrists reportedly treated her for a nervous breakdown. She lived out the rest of her life in Italy and Belgium, eventually residing in solitude at Bouchout Castle. She died there in 1927.\n\nCharlotte, photographed in Italy ca. 1866 (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nExactly what happened to the emerald suite immediately after Charlotte’s death is unclear, but in November 1978, the set was sold at a Swiss auction house. The buyer was an eccentric collector, Bruno Stefanini. The jewels remained in his possession until his death in December 2018, and they were recently rediscovered during an inventory of his immense estate. The jewels remain a part of his foundation, the Stiftung für Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte, and I’m hopeful they’ll eventually be put on display to the public.\n\nKuehn/United Archives/Alamy\n\nThe once-mighty Habsburg dynasty no longer reigns in Europe, but members of the family still retain a few of their magnificent jewels. Today, we’ve got a look at one of their tiaras: the Habsburg Pearl Bandeau.\n\nKeystone Pictures USA/ZUMAPRESS/Alamy\n\nThe bandeau has been with the family since at least the 1950s, though the design suggests that it may be far older than that. The piece features pearls set on various diamond elements, including diamond circles and lozenges. Like many bandeaux, this one looks like it may have originally been the base of a larger diadem, perhaps a large tiara or even a small crown.\n\nIn July 1956, the bandeau made an important appearance at a Habsburg family wedding. Archduchess Charlotte, the seventh child of Emperor Karl and Empress Zita, wore the tiara as she married Duke Georg of Mecklenburg in a religious ceremony in Germany. The press referred to the bandeau simply as “a diamond tiara” in reports on the wedding.\n\nEarlier the same year, the bandeau had been worn by Charlotte’s sister-in-law, Archduchess Regina, for another royal wedding: the nuptials of another Habsburg relative, Archduke Ferdinand, and Countess Helene of Toerring-Jettenbach (a niece of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent). Above, Regina is pictured wearing the bandeau during the festivities; she’s sitting with Princess Kira of Prussia, who is wearing the towering Prussian Clover Coronet. (More on that tiara here!)\n\nKuehn/United Archives/Alamy\n\nThe bandeau has also been worn by at least two more Habsburg brides. In 1980, Archduchess Monika wore the bandeau for her wedding to Don Luis María Gonzaga de Casanova-Cárdenas y Barón, Duke of Santangelo. And in January 1993, the bandeau featured at the wedding of Archduke Karl (the current head of the House of Habsburg) and his (now estranged) wife, Baroness Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza.\n\nKuehn/United Archives/Alamy\n\nOn Francesca’s wedding day, the bandeau was backed in white satin, presumably to help the details of the tiara to stand out more successfully.\n\nOne of the bandeau’s most recent public appearances came in May 2004, when Francesca wore it for a gala theater performance held in Copenhagen on the night before the wedding of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark. Here’s hoping we’ll see this one again in the future — perhaps on another Habsburg bride?\n\nPatrick van Katwijk/Getty Images\n\nOn Saturday, the people of Luxembourg said farewell to a former head of state: Grand Duke Jean, who died on April 23 at the age of 98. Today, we’re looking at the elegant jewels worn by Jean’s family and friends for the state funeral. Our first post covers jewels worn by his close family members.\n\n© Guy Wolff/Luxembourger Wort\n\nGrand Duke Jean’s funeral was held at the Cathedral of Notre Dame of Luxembourg. It’s the same church where he married Princess Josephine-Charlotte of Belgium in 1953. (Read about her wedding jewels here.)\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nJean’s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren were among those gathered to celebrate his long, fascinating life.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nA reception was also held later in the day, following the funeral services.\n\nJOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg, Grand Duke Jean’s daughter-in-law, wore classic pearls for the service and reception.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nHere’s another angle that shows her elegant single strand of pearls, as well as her pearl drop earrings.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nHereditary Grand Duchess Stephanie of Luxembourg wore black and white earrings for the day.\n\nPatrick van Katwijk/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Claire of Luxembourg kept her jewelry very simple, wearing small diamond stud earrings.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Luxembourg wore a lovely pair of modern earrings set with cabochons, perhaps either moonstones or opals, as well as a black headband.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nGrand Duke Jean’s elder daughter, Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria, wore lovely pearl drop earrings from the Nassau family jewelry collection for the funeral.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Samuel Kirszenbaum\n\nA view from the reception also shows that she wore another important family jewel: Grand Duchess Maria Ana’s Pearl Negligee Pendant. (Read more about it here!)\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nMarie Astrid’s elder daughter, Marie Christine, was one of the royal grandchildren who took part in the prayers during the funeral mass. She wore pearl earrings and a delicate necklace.\n\nPatrick van Katwijk/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Liechtenstein, Grand Duke Jean’s younger daughter, wore pearls for the service as well, along with an intriguing pair of earrings and a diamond brooch that was (unfortunately) hidden beneath a scarf in most of the photographs from the day.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nPrincess Margaretha’s elder daughter, Princess Maria-Anunciata of Liechtenstein, wore a pair of shining earrings for the mass, though they were concealed a bit by her hair.\n\nJOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPearls were also the accessory of choice for Countess Diane of Nassau and Princess Sibilla of Luxembourg, both of whom were daughters-in-law of the late Grand Duke.\n\n© Cour grand-ducale/Sophie Margue\n\nPrincess Marie Gabrielle of Nassau (daughter of Prince Jean and Helene Vestur) wore diamond and pearl drop earrings as she prayed during the mass.\n\nStay tuned later today for more royal jewels from the service…"
