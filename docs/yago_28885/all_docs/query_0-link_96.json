        "text": "Few people know that the last Empress of Mexico Carlota, born as Princess Charlotte of Belgium, was actually Sisi’s sister-in-law. This is her tragic story…\n\nYouth\n\nCharlotte, born on June 7 1840, was the only daughter of King Leopold I of Belgium by his second wife, Louise of Orléans (daughter of King Louis Philippe of France). She had three brothers: Louis-Philippe (who died in infancy), Leopold (the later King Leopold II of Belgium) and Philippe, Count of Flanders. Her father was Queen Victoria’s and Prince Albert’s uncle, so she was their first cousin.\n\nThe first tragedy in her life was the death of her mother, Queen Louise-Marie, when Charlotte was ten years old.\n\nWedding\n\nOn 27 July 1857 in Brussels, Charlotte married the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Contrary to her sister-in-law, Empress Elisabeth, she had a good relationship with her mother-in-law, Princess Sophie.\n\nThe couple spent their first couple of years of married life in Italy as the archduke served as the governor of the Austrian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. The position was purely nominal, as power rested in the hand of the Emperor and his officers.\n\nEmpress of Mexico\n\nIn the early 1860s, the ambitious Napoleon III (Empress Eugenie’s husband) initiated the French intervention in Mexico. He was looking for suitable figurehead to serve as the nominal emperor of Mexico. He knew that Maximilian was eager to find a more important political role. Franz Joseph was against it, but Maximilian accepted the Mexican crown and the couple sailed for the New World.\n\nThe imperial couple were crowned at the Catedral Metropolitana in 1864. They chose Chapultepec Castle (Mexico City) as their basis. As Empress, Charlotte changed her name into Carlota. She took her imperial duties very seriously.\n\nQuickly after the coronation, the French support was fading away and France withdrew their troops from Mexico. The political situation became very critical. Charlotte returned to Europe to seek assistance for her husband. She went to Paris, Vienna, and finally in Rome from Pope Pius IX. Unfortunately, probably caused by stress she showed symptoms of paranoia, collapsed emotionally and was in no sate to return back to Mexico. Meanwhile, Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.\n\nWidowhood\n\nCharlotte took her court to Miramare, Maximilian’s castle near Trieste, Italy. Now archduchess again, Frans Joseph placed Charlotte under custody of his brother Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria.\n\nShe was kept in observance by a team of medical and imperial guards. The medical team decided that the empress could not be told of the execution of her husband. Queen Marie Henriett gave her sister-in-law a faked telegram from her husband to come back to Brussels.\n\nThis worked and the empress-dowager left Miramare for the last time. Together with her sister-in law, Queen Marie Henriette, she left for Belgium.\n\nHer brother, King Leopold II of Belgium, gave her Bouchout Castle. He cared deaply for his sister and Charlotte was really grateful to him.\n\nAlthough mentally ill, she reached quite an old age. And during World War I, her Belgian estate was surrounded by the occupying German army. But being the sister-in-law of the Emperor of Austria Hungary – a German ally – whe was safe and spared.\n\nCharlotte died of pneumonia on 19 January 1927, and is buried in the Royal Crypt of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken.\n\nDo you want to see more images of Charlotte, please have a look at my Pinterest board on her:"
