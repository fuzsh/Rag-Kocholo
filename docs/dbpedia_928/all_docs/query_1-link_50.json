What about the fallen discount stores in the Buckeye State?\n\nAkron\n\nClick/Acme Super Center\n\nMiracle Mart\n\nTwin Valu\n\nCincinnati\n\nSwallen's - closed\n\nRink's - closed\n\nCleveland\n\nAtlantic Mills/Spartan Atlantic\n\nClarkins\n\nGiant Tiger > Gaylords\n\nMr. Wiggs - only based in Cleveland\n\nUncle Bill's > Cook United > Cook's\n\nColumbus\n\nHart's > Big Bear Plus - both chains closed\n\nDayton\n\nConcord City - now part of Value City\n\nE.F. MacDonald - closed\n\nGoldman's - closed\n\nToledo\n\nArlan's\n\nBargain City > Rink's - closed\n\nOntario - closed\n\nTopp's - closed\n\nYoungstown\n\nAlmart\n\nAlso, let us not forget the regional and national discounters that left Ohio when the parent chain closed: Best Products, G.C. Murphy/Murphy Mart, Gold Circle, Grant's, McCrory, Service Merchandise, S.S. Kresge, Twin Fair, Woolco, Woolworth, Zayre\n\nA few details about some of the stores:\n\nConcord City - the commercials were kind of a cultural landmark in Dayton. Four copies of owner Jerry Cohen would appear onscreen, each taking turns describing what's on sale. At the end, all four of them would say in unison \"See you. Pleeeeeeeeease.\"\n\nGoldman's - one of these, in Moraine, was quickly turned into a Kmart in the early 80s. There was also a larger one with a gabled roof bearing the store's name, located on the north side of the former traffic circle at N. Dixie Drive and Wagner Ford Rd. and I-75. I think that one became a flea market.\n\nE.F. MacDonald Co. - In high school, I asked a schoolmate where he got the neat new boom box, and he answered \"MacDonald's\". I was like, \"Huh?\" Who knows, the discount chain may actually have been popular in Dayton before the golden-arched bearer of a similar name came to town.\n\nSwallen's - Commercials out of Cincinnati used to sing \"You'll find it at Swallen's!\"\n\nI am really liking Mike From Daytons intel on the boom years in Dayton. There was another discount store (I think) called Rightmayers (sp?) or Rightmeyers...in Kettering off at Stroop and Marshall. This would have been the 1960s.\n\nArlans was in Louisville too. They had a good art supply section, oddly enough. They also used these big supergraphics to spice up the blank store wall that had a more public face (like facing a freeway).\n\nTopps was elsewhere in the Midwest as well..they where in Chicago and in Louisville, during the 1960s. I think they went under in 1970 or a bit later.\n\nI think with the advent of K-Mart there was a big boom in the 1960s of other companies getting into the early big-box discount store market. Although Wal-Mart is whats big now, the concept of the suburban big-box retail store dated back to the 1960s at least.\n\nOne store I remember while growing up in Celina was Barr's. It was pretty much your typical downtown five-and-dime store in small-town Ohio. Being a kid at the time, the two things I remember most are the toy department that was located in the basement and the old-fashioned candy counter. I think they probably went out of business in the early to mid 90's. I'm not sure how big the chain was at its peak or demise, but I do remember that they were owned by a parent company with a different name when they closed. I've searched, but haven't been able to find any information online.\n\nAnother store that I was reminded of recently was The Sundry Store. While I was home not too long ago, my mom got something out of the attic and it was in a Sundry Store bag...never would have remembered it otherwise (probably because they didn't have a toy department). It too was a chain of stores in small towns in Ohio...the bag had the list of locations on the bag, but I didn't look closely. I think it was more like a pharmacy, but without the actual pharmacy.\n\nBest, or Best Products, was a well-known discount store in the format known as \"catalog showroom\". You browsed items in a showroom, and made a note of what you wanted to buy. Then you took it to a service desk who sent the order to an onsite (upstairs) warehouse (sometimes via pneumatic tube!). You then had to wait until you were paged to the \"Main Checkout\", then you picked up your item at the pickup area -- a long inclined conveyor belt from upstairs.\n\nThe Best stores I was familiar with had a toy/baby goods department in a separate compartment on the left, but they used the traditional store setup.\n\nService Merchandise was also a catalog showroom store, but I think there were some later stores that were traditional off-the-shelf. Both chains are gone now.\n\nBefore the B-E-S-T logo in different sizes, they had a stylized \"B\" with red, yellow, and blue coloring in its loops. Best was also known for building these post-modern stores that looked like they were somehow damaged, though none were in Ohio.\n\nhttp://www.metropolismag.com/images/images_0403/bst/notch_op051_t.jpg\n\nhttp://www.metropolismag.com/images/images_0403/bst/BEST_int_ext04rev_t.jpg\n\nhttp://www.metropolismag.com/images/images_0403/bst/BEST_hialeah_built01_t.jpg\n\nThe Best in Toledo was at Westgate; there's now a Home Depot on the site.\n\nThe Best in Trotwood was on Salem Ave. near the mall. The building still stands as a church, last I checked.\n\nThe Best near the Dayton Mall was on SR-741, east side, south of the mall. Not sure what's there now.\n\nThere was a Best inside the Charleston Town Center mall in WV.\n\nSomeone mentioned mixing up Best and Best Buy. Actually the former was built right to the latter in Annapolis, MD back in '97 or so. They finished building the Best just in time for the chain to call it quits. Whole thing reminds me of where at the Westland Mall in Columbus, there was a Wendy's Bridal shop right next door to a Wendy's hamburger restaurant. That, I say they had to have done on purpose."
