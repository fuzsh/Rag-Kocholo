        "text": "Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP has promoted insurance recovery lawyer Jorge Aviles to Counsel. “Jorge has deep experience in a wide range of insurance lines and coverage litigation. This comprehensive knowledge of insurance makes Jorge an excellent coverage attorney who has successfully recovered millions of dollars in insurance for clients,” said practice head Syed Ahmad. Ahmad added, “Jorge is also skilled at discerning client needs and foresees potential issues that will come up while advising clients on coverage issues or during litigation.” Partner Lorelie Masters remarked that “Jorge has experience in cross-border disputes and international arbitrations, and in complex mass-torts and longtail insurance coverage claims that make him a great asset to our team and clients.” “Jorge has the ability to get results for clients in highly contested cases of the greatest import to his clients. Jorge also has a demonstrated record of public service and dedication to giving back through various pro bono representations,” said former practice head Walter Andrews. Partner Mike Levine added, “Jorge’s promotion is well-deserved. Jorge is a rising star in the legal community, as evidenced by the fact that he is a graduate of the 2024 class of the John Payton D.C. Bar Leadership Academy; a Fellow of the Leadership Council on Legal Diversity; was recognized as a Best Lawyer for Insurance Law, The Best Lawyers in America; and was named a Break Out Award Winner by Business Insurance.”"
