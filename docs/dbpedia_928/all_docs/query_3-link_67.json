        "text": "If you feel you have been the victim of harassment by Revco Solutionsâ debt collectors, you are not alone. Revco Solutions is a debt collection company that receives many complaints about inaccurate debt collection accounts. Having an open account from Revco Solutions on your credit report can hurt your credit score for several years. At worst, this can create major financial stress for some individuals. Beyond that, it is simply tedious to deal with repeated phone calls and letters about a debt you donât owe.\n\nWant to know what to do if Revco Solutions is on your credit report? This guide will cover everything you need to know when dealing with Revco Solutions.\n\nIs Revco Solutions a Legitimate Company?\n\nAny time you receive notice about a debt from an unknown source, itâs natural to wonder if itâs a scam. The good news, if you can call it that, is that Revco Solutions is not a scam. Revco Solutions is a legitimate company. This means there is a process in place to dispute your debt. It also means that Revco Solutions is bound by law to follow fair practices when attempting to collect debts.\n\nRevco Solutions is a company that provides several different financial services for corporate clients. However, debt collection is the primary service Revco Solution offers. As such, if you have been contacted by Revco Solutions, it is likely due to a supposed debt you owe.\n\nWhile Revco Solutions is a legitimate business, they are not accredited by the Better Business Bureau. The company is given a B- rating by the BBB. Relative to other debt collectors, Revco Solutions does have a slightly better record when it comes to responding to customer complaints. However, Revco Solution still receives a high volume of complaints about their debt collection practices. The most common complaints have to do with Revco Solutions attempting to collect debts that have already been paid.\n\nHow Can I Contact Revco Solutions?\n\nRevco Solutions is headquartered in North Carolina, but the business operates out of multiple locations. Here is the companyâs full contact information:\n\nWebsite: https://revcosolutions.com/Â\n\nCorporate Headquarters Address: 2700 Meridian Parkway, Suite 200, Durham, NC, 27713\n\nPhone Number: 855-202-0113\n\nFax: 866-291-7413\n\nEmail: Mail@RevcoSolutions.com\n\nIn addition to their corporate headquarters, Revco Solutions also has locations in New Jersey, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Nebraska.\n\nWho Does Revco Solutions Collect For?\n\nRevco Solutions primarily collects medical debts on behalf of healthcare providers. Many of their clients are hospitals and healthcare networks located across America. A few clients mentioned on Revco Solutionsâ website include Trivergent Health Alliance, Penn Highlands Healthcare, and Kettering Health Network.\n\nIn addition to healthcare providers, Revco Solutions also works with some utility companies. However, in most cases, Revco Solutions will contact you concerning an overdue medical debt.\n\nIs It a Good Idea to Contact Revco Solutions Directly?\n\nYou might be tempted to contact Revco Solutions at some point when resolving your account with them. However, contacting them on your own without being prepared can make your life more difficult. It is important to know how to deal with collection agencies before responding. It is recommended that you hire the help of a credit repair company before attempting to settle your account with Revco Solutions.\n\nMany debt collection agencies are difficult to deal with on your own. Credit repair companies offer expert guidance to help you achieve the best possible solution.\n\nWhat Rights Do I Have When Dealing With Revco Solutions?\n\nRevco Solutions is a certified debt collection company. This means that they are subject to both the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) and FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act). These legislative acts provide protections for consumers when dealing with debt collection agencies. They also set in stone certain guidelines that all debt collectors must follow when collecting consumer debts. Debt collectors like Revco Solutions may not engage in any of the following behaviors when attempting to collect a debt:\n\nUsing violent or threatening language\n\nThreatening any undue legal action\n\nCollection of any amount of money greater than the predetermined amount.\n\nHarassment via excessive or inconvenient contact, such as early-morning or late-night hours.\n\nUse of any deceptive or misleading tactics\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of behaviors that Revco Solutions may not engage in. If you feel you have been victimized by harassment from Revco Solutions which violates the FDCPA, you may file a complaint. The FTC (Fair Trade Commission) and CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) both monitor debt collectors for fair practices.\n\nWhy Is Revco Solutions Contacting Me?\n\nIf Revco Solutions is contacting you about a debt, it means their records indicate that you have an outstanding debt with one of their clients. However, many people complain that Revco Solutions contacts them about debts that are not actually owed.\n\nIf you do owe a medical debt and Revco Solutions contacts you, it means they have taken over debt collection efforts on behalf of your healthcare provider. However, if you do not owe a debt, there are several reasons why Revco Solutions could mistakenly contact you. Here are a few common reasons why Revco Solutions could contact you by mistake:\n\nYour file got mixed up with somebody elseâs file.\n\nA debt you had paid was accidentally marked as unpaid.\n\nA duplicate file on your account caused a paid debt to appear unpaid\n\nA debt that has expired was mistakenly marked as open.\n\nAn error with your insurance provider resulted in healthcare services appearing to be unpaid.\n\nThere may be several other reasons why Revco Solutions is contacting you. Figuring out why, or what mistake was made, is an important part of removing Revco Solutions from your credit report.\n\nHow to Remove Revco Solutions From Your Credit Report\n\nSo, if you have an unpaid debt from Revco Solutions on your credit report, how can you remove it? Your first guess might be to simply pay the debt. But doing this does not remove it from your credit report right away. Having paid a debt collector simply changes your report status from âunpaidâ to âpaidâ. While that is a slight improvement, it will still linger on your credit report for seven years.\n\nInstead of paying your debt, you have several options to remove Revco Solutions from your credit report more quickly.\n\nThe first step when dealing with Revco Solutions should be to request debt verification. If Revco Solutions cannot prove that you owe a debt, the account may be removed from your credit report. This is the best-case scenario when dealing with Revco Solutions. However, if they do verify your debt, you have a couple of other options to remove it from your credit report.\n\nFirst, you can dispute the debt. This process can be difficult to undertake alone, and we highly recommend enlisting professional help from a credit repair company.\n\nAnother option is to reach a settlement with Revco Solutions. This involves agreeing to pay a portion of the debt by a certain date. In exchange, Revco Solutions will remove your debt and will stop appearing on your credit report. This is also a difficult process to navigate. A credit repair expert can often negotiate a fairer settlement on your behalf.\n\nA third option is to simply wait for the statute of limitations on your debt to pass. Debt collections appear on your credit report for up to 7 years, but are removed after that time period."
