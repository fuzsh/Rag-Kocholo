This is a great example of the depth of GA’s network, which includes buyers with unique strategic value that can deliver considerable advantages to the selling shareholders.\n\nNavient (Nasdaq:NAVI) retained GA to divest one of its subsidiaries, General Revenue Corporation (GRC).

This is the third acquisition that GA has facilitated for this client in the past 14 months. The transaction is an excellent strategic fit for GA’s client as the acquired company provides the exact services sought in the desired geography, works on the same software platform as the acquirer, and offers many operating synergies. Satisfying the diverse goals of both selling shareholders, one shareholder will transition into retirement while the other will remain in a key role with the company.\n\nDiversified Healthcare Resources (DHR) is a dominant, high-growth player in the eligibility and enrollment sector, providing services and a unique technology platform to major hospitals and health systems throughout California.

A transaction was completed with Collection Bureau Hudson Valley (CBHV), a well-established ARM firm offering post-chargeoff 3rd party receivables management and other services to clients in the financial and healthcare segments. The partnership with CBHV will enable both companies to broaden their suite of service offerings, leverage the expertise of the other and more effectively fulfill their growth objectives.\n\nThis transaction began with our advising a senior executive, Tim Bauer, regarding his objective to create a substantial ARM firm through acquisition and organically driven growth. Greenberg Advisors assisted Mr. Bauer in developing and refining his plan, describing it properly to potential funding partners, and securing attractive terms with the funding partner best suited to support Bauer's goals. Having solidified an exclusive funding partnership with H.I.G. Capital in Spring 2009, we further advised both H.I.G. and Bauer in the pursuit of acquisition candidates through a newly created entity, Reprise Management Group.

Greenberg co-led this effort, resulting in the acquisition of Attention LLC, a fast-growing firm servicing clients in healthcare, auto deficiency, and financial services.\n\nTRAK is the largest independent firm in the United States providing data analytics and legal inventory management of charged-off consumer receivables. H.I.G. sought to acquire a niche service provider within the ARM industry, and it was TRAK’s management team, scale, unique legal approach, and its use of proprietary analytics that contributed to H.I.G.’s interest. This acquisition marks H.I.G.'s second recent transaction in ARM, and is intended to serve as a platform for complementary acquisitions. Greenberg Advisors initiated the transaction and provided advisory services to H.I.G. throughout.\n\nNCM is a national purchaser and servicer of secured and unsecured bankruptcy-impaired consumer receivables. NCM's shareholders sought to maximize their investment by structuring a transaction with the right strategic partner, and to remain active in the operations. Key elements of the transaction included the sale of equity to an investor group possessing key strategic relationships to help fuel growth, as well as the establishment of a credit facility with Siemens First Capital for portfolio purchases, more than tripling NCM's purchasing capability. Greenberg’s comprehensive buyer/investor relationships led to this new buyer and new capital entering the ARM industry.\n\nRMA was among the top 10 largest ARM firms in the US, serving major credit grantors, primarily in the financial and telecom sectors.

Integrity, with over 300 employees, services many of the largest blue chip credit grantors in the United States. The acquisition will bring many benefits to the NARS operating platform, including the integration of Integrity’s senior management team and high-end infrastructure, which is comprised of three US-based call centers and one call center based in Santiago, Chile.

As part of its growth strategy, CBV sought to acquire an ARM firm in the United States to serve as its platform for accessing the much larger charge-off volumes that are available in the US. They engaged Greenberg Advisors to advise them in validating, fine-tuning, and executing their strategy, resulting in the acquisition of Primary Financial Services, based in Phoenix, Arizona. Primary, which focuses on the collection of financial and related charge-offs for major credit grantors, is an excellent fit for CBV both culturally and strategically, and is an ideal platform for CBV's entry into the US market.\n\nH.I.G. Capital, through its affiliate, National Asset Recovery Services (NARS), sought to build upon its BPO and first-party outsourcing capabilities by expanding significantly into third-party debt collection.

Our relationships with investors seeking an opportunity with these characteristics enabled us to contact a narrow group of highly capable parties, and close the transaction quickly -- within 60 days -- while maximizing the value for UFLP.
