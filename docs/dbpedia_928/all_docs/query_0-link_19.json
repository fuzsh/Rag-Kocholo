        "text": "Without a doubt, multigenerational travel is one of the hottest trends going. Multigenerational vacations bring the entire family together to enjoy exciting adventures and to make memories that last a lifetime.\n\nThirty-six percent of vacation bookings are multigenerational, according to travel association figures. The 55 and older generation worked hard, invested well and many of them are already enjoying retirement.\n\nYet, 54 percent of grandparents say they wish they had more time to spend with their grandchildren. And now, they have found the way; grandparents are taking the lead and booking trips for their whole family.\n\nTricia Scott, agent at Visit Mickey Vacations, reports an increase in multigenerational travel in the past few years. Travel to Disney offers plenty of trips for all ages that have nothing to do with parks or with Mickey Mouse.\n\nScott answers a few questions about multigenerational trips.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BEST TRIPS?\n\nIt’s a destination that can fit everyone’s pace. Nobody wants to feel left behind or the one holding everyone else back. Babies and grandparents may want a slower pace. Teens tend to be in a hurry.\n\nSo, what are the best options?\n\nTRY A CRUISE\n\nDisney Cruise Line ships have activities and areas specifically designed for the entire family. They also have several adults-only areas, including spas and nightclubs.\n\nKids, too, have their areas which are conveniently divided by age groups.\n\nDisney Cruise Line ships stop at a private island, Castaway Cay, on trips to the Bahamas or to the Caribbean. Other trips include cruises to ports in Alaska, Europe, Mexico, California and the Canadian coasts.\n\nRoyal Caribbean, which is not affiliated with Disney, is another cruise line that does a great job with families. If you like to gamble, that might be a choice because Disney ships do not have onboard casinos.\n\n...\n\nLike many life skills, optimism doesn’t come as easily as it did when we were 20. Optimism is an exercise we can practice. We can attain it — and maintain it — if we put in the effort and keep our sights on a better future.\n\nOptimism is a positive, empowered frame of mind while contemplating times to come (“Let’s do this!”) Pessimism is a negative, helpless outlook (“It’ll never work. Don’t even try.”) Optimism and youth often go hand-in-hand, because that’s when time, energy and ambition are on our side. Over time, disappointments and setbacks come, relationships and health fail, loved ones die. Suddenly, our options seem limited. Our hopes fade.\n\nBut hope and optimism can be renewed. Springtime is the ideal season to shake off stagnant wintry thinking and regain a fresh perspective. Restoration, refreshment and rejuvenation can be cultivated if you plant the seeds of optimism.\n\nMOVE FORWARD\n\nDr. Ronald J. Morrison is in the practice of pushing back against despair. As senior pastor of Hope Alliance Bible Church in Maple Heights, he serves an inner-city community where poverty, poor education, unemployment, homelessness and violence prevail.\n\nFrom the pulpit and also as executive director of community development corporation Alliance for Family Hope, Inc. (AFH), he instills hope in people. The goal is to transform the communities in Southeast Cleveland, reversing the pattern of deterioration and instability. With educate, encourage and enrich as its guiding principles, the AFH provides educational, enrichment, mentoring and vocational programs for disadvantaged and at-risk youth “to become productive citizens, well educated, deeply encouraged, and enriched beyond their wildest imaginations.”\n\nMorrison says that optimistic people like himself keep an eye on the future, which helps them get through the difficulties of the present. Their optimism is founded on a belief that the best days are yet to come.\n\n...\n\nA Cleveland Indians game is all about having fun. When the cry “Play Ball” goes out, those two words send shivers down the spine of most Indians fans. In the next few hours something exciting is going to happen, and the ballpark will be filled with cheers (and maybe a few groans). No one knows that feeling better than long-time Indians season ticket holder Terry Bittner, 58, who will be there cheering on the Tribe with his family and friends.\n\nHope runs eternal for the 2016 season and for Bittner, this season is going to be another great ride.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FIRST RECOLLECTION OF THE CLEVELAND INDIANS IN YOUR LIFE?\n\nIn 1965, I received a 9-volt transistor radio for my birthday which I could hide under my pillow at night and listen to the games. Back then, Vic Davalillo and Sam McDowell were my favorites. I remember on Opening Day going to school with a book that I had cut all the pages out of so I could hold the radio in the center and hide it from the teacher. I ran the ear plug wire up my sleeve and turned my head so the teacher couldn’t see what I was doing. Of course I got caught, but I remember the principal asking me what the score was before sending me back to the classroom.\n\nDID YOU GO TO GAMES WITH YOUR FAMILY?\n\nTribe games were definitely family events. The place is so friendly. I’d hold my youngest son on my lap and my two other kids and my wife, Cheryl, would enjoy the game from our other three seats. The kids are now 32 (Andy), 28 (Molly) and 26 (Cory).\n\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SEASON?\n\nHitting, hitting, hitting and some improved defense. I’m counting on the pitching to be there.\n\n...\n\nIf somnolence (also known as sleepiness) is what eludes you, then it’s time to start taking the problem more seriously.\n\nSleep issues often can be underdiagnosed because people think it’s just part of getting older, and they don’t raise their concerns with a doctor. That’s the word from a local sleep expert who’s made a career out of helping people fall — and stay asleep.\n\nTHE AGE FACTOR\n\n“Don’t give up hope,” says Dr. Dennis Auckley, Director of MetroHealth’s Center for Sleep Medicine and associate professor of sleep medicine at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nHe cautions those suffering from sleep challenges to distinguish between the many causes of disruption, some of which are natural.\n\n“Sleep architecture changes with age,” he says. “A person may sleep the same amount as in the past but they’re in a lighter stage when they aren’t dreaming and can be awakened easily, leading to the perception that they are not sleeping as well. It’s just normal physiology.”\n\nSleeping is an activity that consumes one third of our lives. It’s hard to ignore the role it plays, so disruption to it requires serious consideration.\n\nSLEEPLESSNESS CAUSES\n\nTwo common causes of sleep disruption include apnea and menopause symptoms of hot flashes and hormone imbalance. Up to 18 percent of people 55 -70 suffer from apnea, and among those, three to five percent require therapy.\n\nSnoring, a byproduct of apnea or its own issue, eventually becomes widespread as people get older. By age 50, 60 percent of men and 40 percent of women snore. By age 60, 55 percent of people snore, Dr. Kingman Strohl, Director of Sleep Medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University says.\n\nThe most common treatments for both apnea and snoring include weight loss, oral appliances, a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device, increasing fitness levels and positional therapy such as sleeping on your side.\n\n...\n\nWhat happens when you style a professional photographer and a retired rocket scientist? They become one of the most inspiring and fashionable couples around.\n\nLinda Ford of North Olmsted wanted to refresh and streamline the remnants of her former corporate life to better reflect her current passion, capturing milestone life moments as a photographer. She started with her closet and turned to Traci McBride, a wardrobe stylist and founder of STYLEDbyTee.com.\n\n“Working with a wardrobe styl- ist gave me a freedom I never had before,” Ford says. “Learning why certain items worked and others didn’t was eyeopening – it wasn’t me, it was the cut of the clothes.\n\nI have more space in my closet, clothes I love that express me and mix into so many unique outfits, and a “Look Book” so I just effortlessly recreate outfits every day. My style is fun and expressive, which is how I live my life.”\n\nHer husband Bill, says, “It’s priceless to have a wardrobe that easily transitions and layers into my on-the-go life, supporting my beautiful wife on photo shoots, enjoying activities with our grand kids and traveling around the world. “My style is colorful and complementary to the love of my life.”\n\nCLOSET DETOX\n\n• Avoid hanging onto sizes that no longer fit you; they are using valuable real estate in the closet. Remove what doesn’t reflect who you are now, andm embrace your ‘now’ body.\n\n• Fit is next. Try on every item in front of a mirror. Note what needs to be tailored and consider the costs involved. Do you love the item enough to reinvest in it?\n\n• Proportion is key. Too long or too wide for your body looks sloppy.\n\n• Subtle details make all the difference. Mix pin stripes and plaid as Bill did in the photo.\n\n...\n\nWhen the 40th annual Cleveland International Film Festival kicks off March 30, at least 100,000 people are expected to attend the 12-day movie marathon in theaters around Northeast Ohio.\n\n“We like to say there’s something in this festival for everyone,” says Patrick Shepherd, CIFF associate director. “People hear “international film festival” and they think they’re walking into a film with subtitles, and that’s true for some, with films from over 60 countries. But it’s a wide selection of films and lots of documentaries.”\n\nThe CIFF offers a great opportunity not only to see unusual and highly regarded films, but also to interact with the people who make them, he adds.\n\n“A lot of times the credits will roll and the lights go up and the director or an actor or the subject of a documentary is there and there are discussions,” Shepherd says.\n\nPLENTY OF CHOICES\n\nFrom family-friendly films, which are perfect for all ages, to intense documentaries and quirky feature films, choices are broad and the selection vast.\n\n“Some people want a film from their ancestral homeland. Others want to see films of women of the world,” Shepherd says.\n\nAn average of 45 screenings are held each day starting around 9:15 a.m. The late shows begin Fridays and Saturdays with 11:30 p.m. screenings. In all, around 400 films will be shown. More than 500 screenings are scheduled.\n\nMost films are in the Tower City Cinemas, offering a convenient way to see movies all day, every day throughout the event, Shepherd says.\n\nOne way to plan your day – or days – at the festival is to look at the festival program and choose a category of films to see. The program meticulously indexes the films to make it easy for visitors to find a good film fit, he adds.\n\nThis year, join thousands of others for some “fun in the dark.”\n\n...\n\nDo you remember the last thing you forgot?\n\nIt’s okay and normal to forget things occasionally. Everyone does. If it happens more than you would like, or if you notice a change in your memory and brain function, it may be time for a memory screening.\n\nThe Center 4 Brain Health on the Menorah Park Campus is registered as a Community Awareness-Raising and Education Site (C.A.R.E.S.) with the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America. Screenings are available by appointment throughout the year. The free screenings take only about 15 minutes, and the public is invited to come and bring a friend or family member.\n\nIn addition to brain screenings, the center also offers classes designed to strengthen a participant’s memory and problem-solving skills, to teach meditation exercises and to help them master stress relief techniques — all designed to improve memory and cognition.\n\nDo you need support? Care partners for individuals with memory and thinking concerns can attend the Center’s Care Partner Support Groups held from 6 p.m. – 7 p.m. on the second Tuesday of each month.\n\nThe Brain Health Information Resource Center provides education, support, and materials for various aspects of brain health including: nutrition, diet, cognitive and physical exercise, sleep, emotional wellness, and personal health concerns such as high blood pressure, stroke, and medications.\n\nFor more information on classes, or to make an appointment for a memory screening, contact Krystal L. Culler, Center 4 Brain Health, at 216-839-6685 or email center4brainhealth@menorahpark. org. or visit center4brainhealth.org.\n\n...\n\nCelebrate Arbor Day at Holden Arboretum with a visit through the treetops and a presentation by a tree canopy expert, which are planned throughout the weekend from Friday, April 29 through Sunday, May 1 at the arboretum’s Corning Visitor Center.\n\n“Out on a Limb – Exploration of Global Forest Canopies,” will also be the featured Arbor Day lecture at 7 p.m. Friday. The speaker, Meg Lowman, Chief of Science and Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences, is an internationally known tree canopy researcher and the author of “Life in the Treetops.” The lecture is free and open to the public, but registration is required.\n\nCome join the nationally-celebrated observance that encourages tree planting and care. Guided tree climbing, crafts, portable sawmill demonstrations and character presentations by Johnny Appleseed and John Muir are just a few of the family friendly activities that are planned at Holden from 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAdmission to the grounds is free Friday. Non-arboretum member tickets for the Canopy Walk and Emergent Tower are $4 for adults, $2 for children. On Saturday and Sunday, non-member discount admission is $10 per car or $20 per car (which includes admission to the Canopy Walk/Emergent Tower) while supplies last.\n\nHolden Arboretum is located at 9500 Sperry Road in Kirtland.
