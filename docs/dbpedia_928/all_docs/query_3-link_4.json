The Revco team will politely advise patients on their options for resolving their outstanding medical bills so they are motivated to pay, not intimidated into doing so.\n\nImproved Recovery Rates\n\nWe’ll direct collection efforts to the accounts most likely to pay. Algorithms and targeted processes help us determine which patients to contact and which collection method will maximize resolution.\n\nBetter Patient Relations\n\nOur compassionate team encourages patients to take advantage of available payment programs. Whether you’re a national health system or a vital regional provider, we’ll use personable, clear communication to establish trust and protect your reputation.\n\nRegulatory Adherence\n\nOur team members adhere to all regulatory guidance outlined under the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act and comply with the HIPAA standards, FTC rules, and other key regulations. This rigorous compliance ensures your organization is represented as a leader in honorable debt collection practices.\n\n“Kettering Health Network has utilized the collections services of Revco Solutions with great satisfaction.
