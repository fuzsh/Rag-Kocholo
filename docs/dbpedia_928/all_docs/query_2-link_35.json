He also served as lead counsel to Jay Alix as Examiner of a $450 million fraud in In re Phar Mor, Inc. and led the successful Chapter 11 case for International Total Services, Inc., the preboard aviation security screening company, which undertook most of the nation’s aviation checkpoints after Sept. 11, 2001, until the Transportation Security Administration assumed control over and responsibility for preboard aviation screening.\n\nMost recently, Jeffrey served as lead bankruptcy counsel for the Chapter 7 trustee for ITT Education, Inc. in the prosecution of D&O claims, fraudulent transfer claims and professional liability claims relating to in excess of $1 billion in catastrophic damages and for the Official General Unsecured Creditors Committee of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., the largest for-profit postsecondary education provider to file for Chapter 11 reorganization.\n\nJeffrey has served as a board member for Lexford Residential Properties Trust (NYSE: LFT), Insignia Financial Group (NYSE: IFS) and International Total Services (NASDAQ: ITSW).\n\n\"When the outlook was grim for our debt-ridden, publicly held healthcare company, we called on Jeffrey Schwartz for thoughtful and creative guidance. The result was a remarkably favorable recovery for all stakeholders. I am forever indebted to Jeffrey and glad he's back in Cleveland.\"\n\nJon H. Outcalt, Sr., former Chairman of NCS HealthCare, Inc.\n\n\"Jeffrey Schwartz helped me lead a multibillion-dollar bankrupt company into a very profitable NYSE-listed company. He wanted the company to thrive as much as I did and worked constantly and creatively to make it happen. In a situation like this, that level of commitment is a must.\"\n\nBoake A. Sells, former Chairman and CEO of Revco, D.S., Inc."
