        "text": "George Simons | July 29, 2024\n\nIf you are being harassed by a debt collector affiliated with CBCS Collections, you may be stressed, anxious and unsure about the future. This is understandable since CBCS Collections, like many other debt collection agencies, use aggressive and unethical practices to try and coerce you into paying what they claim you owe. That's why CBCS Collections might call you all day long, at night, and try to get in touch with you on email and social media to ipersuade you to pay an alleged debt.\n\nWho Is CBCS Collections?\n\nCBCS Collections is a debt collection agency that merged with Professional Recovery Consultants, Inc. in 2020, and subsequently changed its name to Revco Solutions. It is well-known in the collections world for using questionable methods to collect debts. The debt collection agency is based in North Carolina, with offices throughout the US, and has been the subject of complaints by consumers for alleged violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nFor instance, some consumers say that debt collectors with this company have used aggressive communication techniques that violate federal laws. They have even attempted to collect debts that are not owed. If CBCS Collections has contacted you to collect a debt, you need to be apprised of your rights before you respond.\n\nLearn more: How to Beat Revco Solutions\n\nIf you get threatening communications from CBCS Collections or have been served with a lawsuit, never give up hope!

Watch the follow interview with a consumer rights attorney for expert tips on how to settle debt and avoid going to court:\n\nContact CBCS debt collectors\n\nReady to reach out to negotiate debt settlement? You can contact CBCS debt collections, now known as Revco Solutions, at the following phone number and address:\n\nPhone: 855-202-0113\n\nAddress: 2700 Meridian Parkway Suite 200, Durham, NC 27713\n\nCBCS (now Revco) is not the same as CBCS Collections LLC\n\nCBCS, now known as Revco Solutions, is not to be confused with another agency, CBCS Collections LLC. This distinction is vital for anyone who has previously dealt with CBCS Collections and might now encounter Revco Solutions. Understanding this change is essential in comprehending the current landscape of debt collection and how it might affect individuals who have previously had interactions with CBCS Collections.\n\nThe FDCPA protects you from debt collectors like CBCS Collections\n\nCBCS Collections is well-known for trying to prey on consumers who don't understand the legal rights they have as stated in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This law states several rules and guidelines that control how debt collectors can legally treat you. Sometimes debt collectors go over the line because they only receive payment when they collect debts. Some restrictions on these shady companies include:\n\nDebt collectors can never contact you at work.\n\nDebt collectors cannot use bad language and threats when they talk to you or send you letters.\n\nDebt collectors are not allowed to threaten you with lawsuits.\n\nDebt collectors cannot call you at home before 8 am or after 9 pm.\n\nDon't let debt collectors threaten you. Respond with SoloSuit.\n\nDefend yourself if you’ve been sued by CBCS Collections\n\nIf CBCS Collections sues you for debt collection, it's important to respond proactively to the lawsuit. Never ignore the lawsuit because it will not go away. You're just surrendering to the company and letting them win. You mustn't make this mistake.\n\nThe first step to responding to a debt lawsuit against CBCS is to check if it’s Revco Solutions or CBCS Collections LLC suing. Remember, Credit Bureau Collection Services, Inc. (CBCS) recently changed its name to Revco Solutions, so you must determine which company is actually suing you.\n\nHere are some things to try when you write your Answer to the lawsuit:\n\nNever say that you are liable for the debt they claim. Why? Because this debt collection company must prove that you owe the debt they say you owe.\n\nFile the Answer with the Clerk of Court within the timeframe required, which is usually 20 or 30 days after you get the complaint.\n\nMail your Answer copy to the CBCS Collections representative, and make sure it's stamped by the Clerk of Court.\n\nThese affirmative defenses can work in your Answer\n\nWhen you answer the CBCS Collections lawsuit, you have a chance to point out any problems with the allegations. Remember that debt collectors must prove that you owe them the money they say you do. This means the company must show the following before you legally are required to pay the debt:\n\nCBCS Collections has a legal right to sue you for an outstanding debt.\n\nYou are the person who owes the debt.\n\nYou owe what is listed by CBCS Collections in the complaint they filed with the court.\n\nDepending on your financial situation, you could argue that the company did not file the suit within the statute of limitations for your state. The statute of limitations says the time that someone has to sue you.\n\nIf CBCS Collections sues you for a debt that is outside the statute of limitations, you could have the suit dismissed with prejudice.\n\nAlso, think about filing a countersuit against CBCS Collections if you think it violated the FDCPA. If you have clear proof that CBCS violated this law, you may be able to get compensatory damages and have your attorney fees paid.\n\nMake the right defenses the right way with SoloSuit.\n\nFollow these steps if CBCS Collections sues\n\nHere's a quick summary of actions to take if CBCS Collections files a lawsuit against you to recover debts:\n\nCheck if it's Revco Solutions suing you vs CBCS Collections LLC\n\nNote all phone calls that happen before 8 am and after 9 pm. Also, write down if the company calls you at work or uses bad language and threats.\n\nBe certain you file the Answer within the proper time frame.\n\nIn the Answer, it's critical to raise at least one affirmative defense, such as a violation of the statute of limitations. Also, demand evidence that CBCS Collections has that you owe them the money they allege in their communications. And, they must prove that you are the one who owes the debt.\n\nThe strategies and defenses described above may be effective in prevailing against CBCS Collections in court. Also, remember to file a counterclaim if you can prove they violated the FDCPA. They may owe you compensatory damages if they fail to follow the law.\n\nOverall, remember that being sued by a debt collector isn't the end of the world. There are actions you can take to defend yourself in court and protect your rights.\n\n>>Read the FastCompany article: Debt Lawsuits Are Complicated: This Website Makes Them Simpler To Navigate\n\n>>Read the NPR story on SoloSuit: A Student Solution To Give Utah Debtors A Fighting Chance\n\nHow to Answer a Summons for debt collection in all 50 states\n\nHere's a list of guides on how to respond to a debt collection lawsuit in each state:\n\nThe Ultimate 50 State Guide\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii\n\nIdaho\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nIowa\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMississippi\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNevada\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew York\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nVermont; Vermont (Small Claims court)\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWisconsin\n\nWyoming\n\nGuides on how to resolve debt with every debt collector\n\nAre you being sued by a debt collector?
