The option to litigate against three of Revco's former execs -- founder Sidney Dworkin, his son Mark Dworkin and former Revco President William Edwards -- would be granted to the trade creditors' committee. Sells commented that the period spent in bankruptcy has been \"useful in that [Revco has] created a highly efficient machine for a very competetive industry.\" Revco noted that its \"new marketing strategies and systems technology\" contributed to the \"strongest\" third quarter and nine months results since it filed for bankruptcy. Revco posted an 11.9% sales gain to $522.9 mil. in the third quarter of FY 1992 (ended Feb. 8). Net income was $16.2 mil., compared to a $12.7 mil. net loss in third quarter fiscal 1991. Operating profit increased more than five-fold to $18 mil. in the quarter. For the nine months, Revco sales rose 10.2% to $1.43 bil. The company's net loss of $8.3 mil. was lower than the $62.2 mil. net loss reported in the comparable period. Operating profit was $24.2 mil. for the period, compared to a $13.9 mil. operating loss a year ago. No borrowings were made under Revco's $80 mil. debtor-in- possession credit in the nine month period. Cash reserves remain at $158 mil., \"more than adequate to allow Revco to fund the plan of reorganization,\" the company said. Revco modified its plan of reorganization at the beginning of the year after three other plans failed to gain acceptance by all creditor groups. Two of those plans proposed acquisition of Revco by competitors Eckerd and Rite Aid; both of those efforts fell through. Eckerd acquired 220 Revco outlets in a streamlining move by the bankrupt chain in 1990."
