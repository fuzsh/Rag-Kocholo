        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nRite Aid Corporation was founded in 1962 and it is the largest drugstore chain on the East Coast and the third largest in the United States. In 1999, Rite Aid Corporation was found guilty of 20 counts of fraud and ordered to pay $1.3 billion in fines and settlements. This case study will discuss Rite Aid Corporation, its former senior executives, and how they managed to commit the fraud through 2003. This study will also analyze and discuss the different legal attributes of fraud, its punishments, and the outcome of their wrongdoings. Financial fraud has been around as long as people have existed. It is nothing new and is committed by companies and individuals all over the world. Financial fraud is defined as engaging in behavior with the purpose of deceiving others in regards to monetary transactions to alter financial information or to acquire money or property through false pretenses. Financial statement fraud is when a company intentionally records any sort of false transactions on their financial statements to mislead the public and its investors. This is done through either concealing information or distorting information and is a direct violation of Rule 10-b5 which prohibits any type of fraud in the sale of securities. Financial statement fraud usually has the most significant impact on the success of shareholders or the general investing public and can cause harm to many if discovered.\n\n2. Financial Challenges\n\nIn the final years of the study, Rite Aid Corporation's (RAD) financial health seems to be in the most critical conditions. The company's debts are skyrocketing when it resulted close to an equal share with their market value. From year 2000 to 2002, the company's total assets were decreasing, while the debts were increasing. In 3 years, the company lost around 1.6 billion dollars from their assets. Long-term debts also increased rapidly during 3 years, around 2 billion dollars. It indicates that RAD is in a really deep debt pit and hard to gain better financial condition. In the end, they might have to get help from debt consolidation to ease their debt burdens. This will help them to get better payment terms, lower their interest rates, save some money, and increase their cash flow. Based on the exhibit 1, RAD always reported losses in every fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. Even though the value was decreasing, it is still a loss. This will give a very negative long-term effect for the company. When the stockholders see the company is not profitable and has a lot of debts, they might want to sell their shares if they want to cut their losses, or the worst is they just let their shares be diluted until worthless because the stock price is declining. This is called market aversion and it has already happened to RAD when its share values were decreased around 72% from 2000 to 2002. Then, what are the causes of these conditions? Based on the case study, RAD has been dealing with drug price escalations. In the year 2000 to 2001, the price increases were dramatic, up to 15%. This resulted in shortages of gross profits and cut the marginal revenues. This situation made it hard to gain cash and increased debts. The company also has to take some adjustments by closing unprofitable stores, laying off employees, and reducing store working hours. This will adversely affect customer access to the stores and services at a time when customer retention is already a big problem. Those events took place in a tight competition from other drug store retailers. If it is not addressed, there might be a great chance that RAD will lose its customers and fail to regain the lost customers due to the events that had happened. All of these may cause more revenue losses and unprofitable margins.\n\n2.1. Declining Revenue\n\nRite Aid's income declined almost 10% in 2009, to $26.3 billion. The income decline was principally because of a drop in same-store sales, an abatement in new store openers, and store closings. A decline in sales for hypochondriac drugs, pain relievers, and cold cures constrained many drug store PoM producers to trim costs. Income from front-end sales dropped 1.5% and drug store sales declined 1% because of a discretionary change in product blend and lower client traffic. The organization's drug store acquisition income diminished by about 8% because of the drug store same-store sales decay, extra generic medicine sales, and the extremely inglorious Revco acquisition income base coming about because of acquired store divestitures. Despite the fact that the organization's drug store same-store sales were off 1.7% in the primary quarter, prescription sales were flat, the first run through in quite a while, because of expanded generic medicine usage. While it is as yet too soon to get check change for the Federal Medicaid Reimbursement program moving sales far from higher margin branded to lower cost generic drugs, it is estimated this had a 1% effect on drug store same-store sales. It additionally shows up there were a few brief drug store income underperformance issues that definitely won't ever be obviously known. Customer research through continuous Shoppers' Journals and different scientific studies distinguish a critical customer service level dropvers upper North Atlantic states with 80% of this being notable, with the larger part more experienced in the drug store industry, distinguishing medication error frequency and on occasion store tidiness as the critical issues and areas of concern. At the July Certification Conference, area store groups distinguished and verified these concerns and realized that if numerous more standard clients are to be retained and expected to increase drug store clients, especially those which are high profit, there should be a significant improvement in store conditions. A trend analysis of the hosed issue areas has been coordinated with the objective of setting up measurable improvement goals.\n\n2.2. Rising Costs\n\nThe work done by Rite Aid Company and its operations is heavily affected by financial constraints over the past few years. The primary reason for this is the loss of earnings by the company, which has effectively driven it to the brink of insolvency. The revenue of the firm has declined from $1.17 billion in 2008 to $2.98 billion in the 1st quarter of its fiscal year 2011. The huge loss in earnings over those years has driven Rite Aid to become a company whose primary focus is to right its ship to avoid insolvency or possible bankruptcy in the future. Rising costs have affected the financial well-being of Rite Aid. The tough economic times over the past few years and the huge loss of jobs in the United States have effectively driven a high unemployment rate. When the demand for employment is low, people require cheaper healthcare and/or a healthcare provider that can offer similar services at a lower cost. Rite Aid has had to lower prices on many items in its stores to meet the needs of its customers. Another major factor is the higher cost of medications and insurance for its employees. With a decline in revenue and an increase in costs, Rite Aid has seen profit margins shrink over the years.\n\n3. Competitive Landscape\n\nIncreased competition from online retailers Rite Aid is facing higher competition from online retailers who are offering a more convenient supply of prescription medication. Online sales of prescription medication are projected to rise at an annual rate of 14% to $9 billion between 2010 and 2015. With the aging population and increasing prevalence of chronic disease, the market for pharmaceuticals is growing, and consumers are eager to find the best prices. As the uninsured and underinsured populations rise due to high unemployment and government cuts on healthcare benefits, consumers will become more cost-conscious when purchasing prescription drugs. Online retailers do not have the same overhead costs as traditional pharmacies and often sell prescription drugs at a lower price. Consumers do not have to incur the cost of gas and time to visit the pharmacy and perhaps wait in line. Finally, a few large online retailers such as drugstore.com and the partnership between Wal-Mart and Amazon.com now have strategic agreements with PBMs, which might provide them with more visibility and a greater in-network status. This will make it more difficult for Rite Aid to grow sales to the underinsured and insured population.\n\n3.1. Increased Competition from Online Retailers\n\nDespite having a favorable position in the retail pharmacy market industry, a major concern for Rite Aid stems from the increased pressure of competition from online retailers. In 2010, the online drug market had grown to an estimated $75 billion, creating an increasingly competitive environment for Rite Aid. In comparison to purchasing goods from traditional drug stores, online shopping allows consumers to make price comparisons between an array of online retailers, observe online discounts/sales, and eliminates the need to drive to a store to make a purchase. Faced with economic downturn, high rates of uninsured individuals, and the growing unemployment rates, consumers have become more price conscious when purchasing items necessary for their health and wellbeing. An increasing trend for customers is unable to afford the branded medications and purchasing generic brand drugs, which Rite Aid, Walgreens, and CVS pharmacies do not make a large profit due to the volume of inventory they must keep for the consumer who needs the brand name medication. With the continued high rate of consumers using the internet to purchase medications and the ability to automatically substitute brand-to-generic on internet pharmacies at a much cheaper price, Rite Aid's profits from sales of medications may see a decline. Another point that can affect Rite Aid's front-end sales is future consumer purchases of OTC items and health and beauty aid products being added to their mail order prescription due to the convenience of having everything delivered right to their door. Customers are buying a wider variety of products available at a wide range of online stores. Due to the competitive environment, the price of medications can be less expensive than those in the stores and have less sales tax. This may take away from the front-end retail sales. With lower cost and the added convenience of free shipping from purchasing an amount of items greater than a certain price, future customers may opt to have more of their daily necessities delivered to their home. This increased trend of buying medications and OTC items HBAs delivered will cause a decrease in the number of consumers visiting local drug stores to make their purchases. With decreased profit from the sales of medications and front-end items, Rite Aid will face a need to close additional stores and cut costs of employees to offset the losses. Rite Aid must find a new strategy to keep a customer base and increase profits on existing customer segments.\n\n3.2. Pressure from Larger Pharmacy Chains\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, increased in-store sales continue to drive much of the revenue growth for the chain drug store industry. However, the industry continues to see an increase in the number of non-traditional drug stores that compete directly against chain drug stores. Chief among these retailers are the larger pharmacy chains such as CVS and Walgreens, who are aggressively adding more stores and expanding their services. In the years leading up to this paper, both CVS and Walgreens added roughly 500 stores apiece. This growth is significant when compared to the industry growth rate of 1-2%. This overabundance of drug stores has caused a situation of bad clustering in the industry. Too many stores within a market has caused intense price competition and has made top line growth very difficult to achieve. CVS and Walgreens are also aiming to take away market share by increasing their presence in the retail-based clinic market and through acquisitions. Historically, drug stores have been the primary location for consumers to purchase prescription drugs. However, with the creation of pharmacy benefits managers (PBM) and the movement towards mail order prescriptions, there has been a dislocation of the traditional link between where a patient visits a doctor and a patient purchases drugs. In order to relink this nexus, both CVS and Walgreens have created retail clinics to provide a convenient and low-cost method for patients to visit a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. At this point, Rite Aid has followed this strategy and opened 58 clinics located in 6 different states. Acquisitions have also been a key strategy for the larger pharmacy chains. CVS made the significant acquisition of Caremark in 2007, a PBM that at the time was committed to moving the PBM service market away from mail order and towards more convenient internet-based drug purchases. With this PBM merger and a $25 billion debt issuance to finance this, CVS was committing to take large amounts of Rite Aid & Caremark business away from the retail side. The Walgreens acquisition of Duane Reade in 2010 was a higher dollar acquisition, but not nearly as significant percentage-wise given the size of Walgreens. However, Walgreens made a strategic move to set them up for international expansions into lucrative urban markets. These past and potential future clinic acquisitions and drug store acquisitions are quite threatening to the overall competitive stance of Rite Aid.\n\n3.3. Changing Consumer Behavior\n\nThere were references to people not buying as many newsletters and of a policy of buying a minimum of two that readers found difficult. Book companies that had an entire set of books published at once sometimes found the second and third books in the series would be late in the sequence. Readers who had gotten the first book had then bought the rest of the series from elsewhere, doubly harming the company in loss of sales. One reader who bought books alphabetically from a mail order book club said that since buying from Amazon, he would look up specific books and end up buying that book alone. Consumer's attitudes towards buying new products to relieve prices of household staples such as medicines, cleaning products, and toiletries were reviewed. There were several who said that they were now doing one big shop (£40 plus) at a large supermarket and getting everything at once, rather than multiple shops scattered across the month at convenience stores. One customer from Ohio pointed out that with a planned closing of a few stores in his area, he would still go to the last one remaining because he would not be able to get everything at once from the supermarket. Those shopping for regular prescription drugs found that they needed to have a good reason or cheaper price to buy elsewhere, usually driven by insurance companies. It was a rough easy to split the customers into two large distinct groups: those who buy most things online and those who do not very often. The behavior of the latter group was less changed, and their shopping habits would be driven by changes to the store itself. This included store locations, where several people saw the opening of new stores as a good sign. Overall, new stores, store renovations, and a changing demographic in some locations were seen as efforts to modernize the store's image and appeal to a wider range of customers.\n\n4. Strategic Initiatives\n\nCost-cutting initiatives comprised the largest portion of strategic changes made under Rite Aid's revitalization plan. Tumultuous times delivered hard hits to the company's profits. In the year ending in March 1999, Rite Aid reported a loss of $801.4 million. The next year, reports showed a $1.05 billion loss. The losses showed a systemic problem with the company's structure, mainly in relation to rapid expansion activities in the 1990s. The company's debt was now rated as junk status and stock price hovered just above $5 per share. Efforts to regain money by selling acquired stores were competitive and therefore cut into recent store profits made by Rite Aid. The company was now pressured to find a newer, more efficient way to operate its chain. In 2000, newly elected CEO Robert Miller took action by downsizing the corporation, selling more than 1,000 store locations. Rite Aid aimed at trimming its store locations to feature more centralized networks of stores, making convenient use for district management and cross-store product distribution. Such trimming helped Rite Aid to reduce administrative/executive costs once spread out too thinly over an abundance of stores. Store locations were halved for quicker profit turnover. However, controversy was caused by the closure of stores located in lower-income areas. Rite Aid made efforts to relocate pharmacy customer records and prescription inventories to surrounding Rite Aid locations, taking the place of business from the closed stores. The action would work to sustain pharmacy customer sales in affected areas until Rite Aid could provide newer store locations in the future. An overall decrease in staffing cut more than 10,000 jobs from the company. Downsized Rite Aid needed fewer workers to maintain its operations. Measures were taken to ensure that enough competent workers remained with Rite Aid, through providing severance packages and outsourced job-search assistance for employees terminated due to the downsizing. A $100 million staff-investment program was initiated to secure adequate training and skill maintenance for retained employees.\n\n4.1. Cost-cutting Measures\n\nSupported by structural and organizational changes, Rite Aid has developed an impressive operational focus that has helped the company drive cost savings. In the face of declining revenues in 2006 and 2007, Rite Aid developed initiatives and restructuring totaling approximately $1.5 billion, designed to help the company better position itself for the long term, reduce deep costs, and drive future profitability. These initiatives were wide-ranging and took place over several years, ending in 2010. They included the transformation of entire business units and processes, including restructuring the field organization and a full redesign of the inventory and supply chain. A major target was restructuring the store base, and thanks to an extensive property evaluation and store analysis efforts, Rite Aid was able to identify approximately 500 stores for closure, many of which were non-producing obsolete locations near new stores. This led to a large number of store closures but was a net benefit as the company successfully relocated over 400 affected stores into former locations. These store moves were largely cost-neutral to potentially profitable, thanks to landlord conveyance incentive agreements and/or sublease and assignment of the lease to another retailer.\n\n4.2. Expansion of Services\n\nA key reason for the transition was a shift in the range of advice rendering. Yet, as the nature of services expanded, some typical products were to be downsized or eliminated. In preparing to extend the scope of pharmacy services, it would be trying to proceed in running sharp fronts towards US retail pharmacies, but by targeting other nations where access to main competitive chains is more limited. The early planning stages have sounded out several areas of potential growth. The first is in clinical pharmacy services. This expanse entails many things in varied practice settings. Our company defines clinical pharmacy services as the direct application of pharmacist knowledge to a definitive therapeutic recommendation that addresses a patient-specific medical issue. This is a departure from the traditional role of dispensing medication, which has become an increasingly less complex task with the advent of the health in use of health provider-administered prepackaged medicines. In order to accomplish this, Rite Aid must avail itself to more face-to-face interaction between the pharmacist and patient. This can be done in settings such as an outpatient clinic or doctor's office. Another area can be an expansion in pharmacist-run disease state management consultative services. With the Fruth-Wolfe bill, pharmacist services in WV Medicaid patients have increased to a potential 600,000 more patients who may now qualify to receive consultative services. This bill will open up many more opportunities for WV pharmacists to provide evidence-based quality care with the needs of increasing patient health outcomes. The final area of growth is in the general increase in pharmacist professional services conducted outside the realm of dispensing medication. An example of this would be an increase in immunization services provided in a retail setting. This not only is a valuable public health service but it also acts as a tool to help generate traffic in stores. This has the potential for significant business-to-business partnerships with vaccine pharmaceutical companies. With the nature of drug products being tied to commission-based sales, these companies sometimes employ tactics to get vaccinations administered at a low cost or for free in hopes to bring in new customers for prescription drugs of the same indication. This can create a scenario of joint promotions and cost various cost-to-service efficacy analysis as a method to build a value-based platform that creates a higher standard of care. These areas of clinical services have various levels of potential profitability and risk, but with an overall decline in traditional dispensing product, decisions for what services are to be rendered may be based on healthcare reimbursement for said services.\n\n4.3. Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nThe way in which Rite Aid undertook the development of its EnvisionRx PBM outlines the most insightful business strategy the company has put into place. By recognizing the potential of the then largely undeveloped PBM market, Rite Aid sought to compete with the current market leaders such as Caremark and Express Scripts. Rite Aid could offer a cost-effective pharmacy service within its stores, which would be integrated with EnvisionRx mail-order pharmacy services, notably expanding the Rite Aid pharmacies' available services. In aligning with the market trend - shifting prescriptions from retail to mail-order due to lower cost and greater consumer convenience - this strategy targeted to increase the number of prescriptions filled while not taking away from the customer count in-store. The main aim of this strategy is to leverage EnvisionRx nationally and to other retail pharmacies, in an attempt to lower cost and increase efficiency of drug distribution. At the time of writing, Rite Aid has achieved stage one of the plan with group one of the EnvisionRx implementation at Rite Aid stores. This strategy has been successful to date; however, evidence cannot be seen in financial statements until further EnvisionRx integration is achieved. An acquisition that arose between Rite Aid and EnvisionRx was the taking over of the PBM, acquired by Rite Aid in June 2015. This purchase was priced at $2 billion, showing the company's dedication and confidence towards the success of the EnvisionRx model. This is a primary example of the previously stated aim, in integrating a pharmacy service that can cut costs for Rite Aid consumers and focusing on mail-order prescriptions at a national or retail chain level. Upon its taking, the site of the PBM was moved to Pittsburgh, PA, where it remains to be integrating the newly formed company. This particular acquisition has positive financial implications, contributing towards Rite Aid's debt reduction and increased earnings with the intention of funding further EnvisionRx integration."
