Should the Big B deal go through its 397 outlets would put 2,184-unit Revco only about 200 stores behind industry leader Rite Aid in store count.\n\nThe acquisition would also likely vault Revco past Rite Aid into second place among drug chains in sales behind Walgreen Co. Adding Bessemer, Ala.-based Big B's $737 million in sales last year to Revco's $5.09 billion would give the latter the edge in the race to become the second drug chain to reach the $6 billion mark.\n\nRevco bid $15 per share for all of the outstanding stock of Big B in a hostile tender offer that is scheduled to expire on October 7. The price is 53% over the $9.81 average dosing price of Big B shares for the three months ended-September 6. Big B has approximately 22 million shares on a fully diluted basis, of which Revco already owns 1.19 million, or 5.4%. With the support of 10% of stockholders Revco could call a special meeting at which a majority of shareholders could vote to replace Big B's board of directors.\n\nWhile Big B has resisted earlier overtures from the Twinsburg-based chain, including a $14 per share offer, Revco president and chief executive officer Dwayne Hoven says the merger would give the two companies greater economies of scale, bolstering their ability to compete for third-party pharmacy contracts.\n\nIn a letter to Anthony Bruno, chairman and chief executive officer of Big B, Hoven notes, \"The combination of Revco and Big B offers numerous advantages over either company remaining as a stand-alone entity, and, for Big B, over any other possible strategic combination.\"\n\nBruno says the Big B board will carefully consider the \"unsolicited\" offer. The chain asked that its shareholders delay making a decision on the offer until being advised of the board's position. While Big B has repeatedly stated a preference for remaining independent, a 26% one-day jump in its stock price following the offer triggered speculation that Rite Aid, Eckerd Corp. or CVS might make competing offers or that Revco might increase its bid.\n\n\"We think this is a very attractive offer,\" Hoven notes. \"We hope the Big B board will recognize the benefits of this transaction for Big B and its shareholders. We do not need the Big B board to take any action to permit our offer to proceed; and if it takes any action to block our offer we're committed to this transaction and will take whatever action seems appropriate at the time.\"\n\nThe deal would give Revco entry into Mississippi, the Florida panhandle and Alabama, where Big B has about 160 stores and where Hoven was born and raised. It would also add about 160 units to Revco's 180 stores in Georgia, making it the dominant player in the that state. Combining the market share of the two chains in Atlanta would push Revco into first place in the booming area with 27% of sales, three points ahead of Eckerd. Atlanta has also drawn the attention of CVS, which is making its debut there with 10 outlets and plans to eventually have up to 150 stores.\n\nIs strategic fit\n\nHoven points out that Big B's coverage of the Southeast dove-tailed with Revco's 14-state operating area. \"This offers an excellent strategic fit,\" he says. \"There's very little duplication of store or distribution center locations.\"\n\nGeorgia and Tennessee - where Big B has about 20 outlets - are the only states where the chains overlap, minimizing antitrust concerns. Asked about the possibility of being forced to close or sell stores, Hoven notes he would leave that matter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). But in a reference to the agency's breakup of the Rite Aid-Revco merger, he says, \"We were very sensitive and are very sensitive to the FTC issues.\"\n\nAdding that the chain had \"done its homework,\" he says he is confident that the FTC would approve the Big B deal.\n\nAsked whether the bid was an attempt to boost morale following the five months of uncertainty precipitated by Rite Aid's bid for Revco, Hoven says, \"I think our people have come back together very rapidly. They're energized and enthusiastic about the possibility of doing this acquisition and are committed to going forward.\"\n\nHe notes that Revco and Big B have similar operating philosophies. Big B's average store size of 9,000 square feet compares with Revco's range of 8,500 to 10,500 square feet. If the deal closes Revco will move quickly to install its pharmacy and point-of-sale technology systems and merchandise mix, necessitating some remodeling of Big B stores, according to Hoven. The outlets would also get the Revco banner.\n\nHoven calls chain drug mergers inevitable, saying it is increasingly difficult for regional operators to meet consumer demand for lower prices. \"Consolidation will continue in this industry, and if you're not preparing for the future you are preparing for potential failure,\" he says."
