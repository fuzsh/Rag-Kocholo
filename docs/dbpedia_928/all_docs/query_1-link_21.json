The price includes $300 million of Hook debt that Revco will assume.\n\nWhen the merger is completed this summer, Revco will operate 2,367 stores in the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast, and have total sales of $4.54 billion, according to Drug Store News, an industry publication. Shareholders of both companies must still approve terms of the deal.\n\nThe Walgreen Company is the sales leader with $8.3 billion in the 1993 fiscal year, while the Rite Aid Corporation is the industry leader in number of stores with 2,689.\n\nIn New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Hook-Superx, which is based in Cincinnati, closed at $12.75, up $3.625, while Revco shares closed down 62.5 cents, to $15.75.
