        "text": "Less than a year after leading Revco D. S. Inc. in a $1.29 billion leveraged buyout, Sidney Dworkin, a founder and its chairman, abruptly resigned yesterday as head of the nation's largest drugstore chain, along with his son, Marc, an executive vice president.\n\nThe Dworkins, who denied being forced to leave, said they had sold their interest in Revco for an undisclosed amount of cash and certain company assets. The assets include a 22 percent interest in the General Computer Company, a pharmacy software supplier, and the ownership of a four-unit discount drug chain, called Get It for Less.\n\nThe Dworkin family had owned 11.6 percent of Revco after the company went private in December 1986. New Leader in Place\n\nThe resignations were announced as Revco confirmed the appointment of Boake A. Sells, former president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, as its chairman and chief executive. Mr. Sells, who will receive an equity stake in Revco estimated at $20 million by some sources, will also assume the chief executive's post from William B. Edwards, who remains president and will be chief operating officer.\n\nGiven the elder Mr. Dworkin's leading role in the buyout, the resignations were somewhat unusual because an evaluation of management quality would have been important in the decision by lenders and equity holders to participate in the deal.\n\nHowever, Revco's financial performance had been weak even before the company went private. Some of Revco's internal problems are said to involve the lack of adequate electronic data systems and insufficient delegation of authority.
