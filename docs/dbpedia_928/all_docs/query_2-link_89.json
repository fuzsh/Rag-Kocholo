        "text": "Human Resource Capacity\n\nThe Recommendation: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Defense (DoD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) should work with academia, private organizations, and foundations to support efforts at rebuilding the human resource capacity at both academic centers and public health agencies in the relevant sciences—such as medical entomology, vector and reservoir biology and ecology, and zoonoses—necessary to control vector-borne and zoonotic diseases.\n\nBackground Erosion in the human resource capacity to address VBDs is linked to the erosion of overall public health infrastructure for VBDs. Surveillance and control programs for VBDs are expensive. These programs are especially vulnerable to reductions or elimination when budget shortfalls occur and when VBD activity is incorrectly perceived to be controlled. Both of these issues have led to decreased support for and deterioration of public health surveillance and control capacity throughout the world. For example, the sporadic and epidemic nature of many VBDs resulted in the closure of state programs and in the demise of university training programs in medical entomology and vector biology (NRC, 1983). In the developing world, where resources are much more limited, the consequences of such reductions can be even more dramatic. For example, in the 1950s and 1960s the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and participating western hemisphere countries established a remarkably effective program to control Ae. aegypti to preclude the emergence of sylvatic YFV into urban populations (Gratz, 1999; Monath, 2001; Gubler, 2002a). Overall, the program was quite effective, but success led to demise of the programs, and the resources to support these efforts were shifted to other priorities. Now Ae. aegypti is resurgent and essentially hyperabundant throughout much of tropical and subtropical America. Concomitantly all four dengue virus serotypes including American/Asian genotypes are cocirculating in Latin America (Beaty, 2000; Gubler, 2002a). High mosquito abundance and intensive virus transmission have resulted in a state of dengue hyperendemnicity, resulting in the emergence of DHF-DSS as a major public health problem in the Americas. In addition, YFV has recently caused epidemics in South America and Africa (Monath, 2001; Gubler, 2002b). With Ae. aegypti resurgent in metropolitan areas in the Americas, it seems to be only a question of when urban yellow fever will reemerge or chikungunya (Charrel et al., 2007) will emerge in these areas with disastrous consequences.\n\nConcomitant with the erosion of VBD control infrastructure has been the dramatic decline in medical entomology/vector biology expertise. Indeed, it was difficult to identify local medical entomologists, vector biologists, and arbovirologists to respond to the WNV emergency in the initially affected states. There has been a reduction in the numbers of medical entomologists, vector biologists, and vector control personnel. This unfortunate trend and its public health implications were first described in a U.S. National Academy of Sciences report (NRC, 1983). The emergence of WNV and the paucity of human resources available to address that emergency were ample testimony to the prescience of the authors of that report. The critical needs in this area have also been addressed in other publications and books (e.g., Spielman, 1994). However, these reports did little to change attitudes in academic departments across the nation. Medical entomology positions were invariably lost when occupants retired or left and when entomology departments combined with plant pathology and related departments.\n\nResponses With the emergence of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic erlichiosis, and WNV disease in the United States and the resurgence of VBDs throughout the world (Gratz, 1999; Gubler, 2002b), organizations such as the NIH, the World Health Organization Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (WHO-TDR), and a number of foundations began to promote research in vector biology. With increased funding and program development opportunities, there has been an increase in the number of scientists entering the field, many of whom are now assuming faculty positions in universities. Indeed, there has been a renaissance in vector biology, which is providing not only new knowledge and targets for vector control but also a new generation of vector biologists capable of applying modern molecular and quantitative approaches to control VBDs. Hopefully, as the scientific excitement in and public health importance of the field is recognized, and the opportunities for program development in vector biology increase, student demand will increase and previously lost positions will be regained in entomology departments. This will provide a renewed stream of students to replenish the depleted ranks of medical entomologists at all levels.\n\nTraining Training of a new generation of vector biologists/medical entomologists capable of applying modern molecular and information technology approaches to prevent and control emerging and resurging VBDs is critical. A number of agencies, including WHO-TDR, PAHO, NIH, CDC, and private foundations, recognized this situation and initiated training programs for vector biologists and medical entomologists in the United States and other countries. Frequently, however, such programs only address urgent needs. For example, the emergence of WNV resulted in a major effort by CDC to train individuals in mosquito identification, arbovirology, and mosquito control. WHO provides workshops devoted to specific important issues concerning vectors and VBDs in disease-endemic areas. Such programs, however, typically do not provide personnel with in-depth training in molecular, biological, epidemiological, and information technology techniques or permit trainees to exploit these techniques effectively in real-world situations.\n\nEfficient training strategies are necessary to address the human resource needs in all areas of VBDs, from identification and processing of vectors to gene identification and characterization, and to development of GIS and other information technology-based approaches for control of vectors and VBDs. Web-based training programs, courses, and texts would seem to be a robust enough venue to address critical short-term needs. However, alternate approaches are necessary to provide quickly a new generation of VBD specialists and leaders. The Biology of Disease Vectors course was notable in this regard. This intensive 2-week course, which was supported by the MacArthur Foundation, WHO-TDR, and other agencies, was developed to catalyze the use of modern molecular and quantitative approaches into medical entomology and vector biology. The course also provided exceptional learning and networking opportunities for vector biologists. Many of the students emerged as leaders, trainers, and program initiators in their respective countries. Internationally recognized faculty provided invaluable networking and career opportunities.\n\nSimilar courses should be offered to provide a new generation of leaders in critical and emerging disciplines. For example, the renaissance of vector biology/medical entomology at NIH and the new vector biology study section has been very laboratory associated; field-oriented and control programs have not kept pace. Training programs and research focusing on the biological, behavioral, entomological, and environmental determinants of pathogen emergence and persistence, and that incorporate the most modern and robust molecular and information technology tools, are desperately needed. These would be powerful incentives to translate the explosion of new information concerning vectors into field-relevant tools and management strategies, and to train vector biologists capable of incorporating the new methodologies into daily vector and disease control operations. Indeed, the cadre of molecular vector biologists trained in the laboratories contributing to the renaissance of vector biology would be excellent candidates for such a course.\n\nThere have been some very notable successes in programs to promote field-oriented VBD research. CDC has established major extramural efforts to partner with state and university scientists to address important vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, WNV disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. This leverages CDC monies and talents to address emerging disease issues, provides support for applied epidemiological research and training in disease endemic sites, and greatly enhances communication and partnering between CDC and state and local institutions. In addition, CDC launched a Fellowship Training Program (FTP) in Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in direct response to the introduction of WNV into the United States. The purpose of the FTP was to provide training in arbovirology, microbiology, entomology, and epidemiology relating to VBDs. The goal was to improve the ability of the U.S. public health system to respond to the problem of VBDs by increasing the number of specialists with demonstrated skills in the public health aspects of VBDs and to provide them with the essential, pertinent field and research skills. Programs such as the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research (ICIDR) and Tropical Medicine Research Units also provide excellent training and research opportunities in field-oriented vector biology and control programs. The NIH ICIDR grants with the companion ABC Fogarty Center training programs are well conceived in this regard and emphasize epidemiological research and training in disease-endemic areas in the context of NIH-funded research programs. Scientists not only are trained in cutting-edge scientific methodology but also apply new discoveries and approaches in disease-endemic countries.\n\nThese types of programs need to be continued and expanded upon in the future, especially to transfer scientific and technical know-how to the developing world where improved vector and disease control is a matter of life and death. Unfortunately, funding for the CDC FTP in Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases has been terminated after one funding cycle, despite the productivity and popularity of this program, which was such a well-conceived approach to address human resource needs in field-oriented vector biology and VBD control.\n\nTraining opportunities in disease-endemic countries Long-term presence of sustainable laboratories in selected disease-endemic countries is critical (IOM, 2003). Such laboratories are invaluable for research, training, and surveillance for tropical and emerging diseases and for training vector biologists. Historically, the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit, U.S. Army, and WHO laboratories have provided outstanding opportunities for trainees to obtain experience in tropical disease research. Such programs also initiate long-term interactions with collaborators in tropical regions and yield long-term benefits by establishing public health infrastructure, training and research opportunities, and listening posts in areas of the world where many pathogens emerge.\n\nInnovative approaches for rebuilding and sustaining medical entomology/vector biology Some very innovative approaches to augment proposals to address national and international needs in medical entomology/vector biology and to sustain the expertise were proposed by the Committee (IOM, 2003). Some of these are listed in . For example, CDC could establish a medical entomology/vector biology program to complement the existing Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, and the officers emerging from the new program could provide support to national and international jurisdictions requesting entomological expertise. The USDA and DoD should establish a similar program devoted to vectors of animal diseases. Such programs would bring great visibility and prestige to the field. In addition, Regional Centers of Excellence (RCEs) in medical entomology/vector biology should be established, which would provide service, training, and research in medical entomology/vector biology at the regional level, thereby replacing many of the programs lost at the state and local levels. Such an effort would also bring visibility to the field, would provide positions for medical entomologists, and would provide training opportunities for VBD specialists. These RCEs would preferably be incorporated into larger Interdisciplinary and Zoonotic Infectious Disease Centers (IOM, 2003), which would be sustainable and would be invaluable resources to the regions, states, nation, and the world in issues involving vector-borne and other emerging diseases and bioterrorism.\n\nTABLE 3-3\n\nInnovative Approaches to Restoring Human Resource Capacity in Vector-Borne Diseases.\n\nSummary The efforts and programs outlined and proposed would bring visibility and prestige to medical entomology/vector biology, would educate public and professional groups concerning the importance of vectors and VBDs, and would provide incentives for discipline development and sustainability. These actions would undoubtedly increase student demand and would be of great value in increasing the number of faculty positions and programs in medical entomology/vector biology in the United States.\n\nIncrease the Armamentarium for Vector Control\n\nThe Recommendation: DoD and NIH should develop new and expand upon current research efforts to enhance the armamentarium for vector control. The development of safe and effective pesticides and repellents, as well as novel strategies for prolonging the use of existing pesticides by mitigating the evolution of resistance, is paramount in the absence of vaccines to prevent most VBDs. In addition, newer methods of vector control—such as biopesticides and biocontrol agents to augment chemical pesticides, and novel strategies for interrupting vector-borne pathogen transmission—should be developed and evaluated for effectiveness.\n\nBackground There is a critical need to increase the armamentarium for vector control both in terms of new pesticides and formulations, and new targets and approaches for control. Complicating control of VBDs has been a lack of knowledge of fundamental genetic, biological, and environmental determinants of vector pesticide resistance, vectorial capacity, and vector competence. Indeed, the vector has frequently been viewed as a black box, with little knowledge of the molecular bases of pesticide resistance or pathogen transmission. Similarly, there was a paucity of information concerning critical components of vector biology such as vector immunity, development, diapause, longevity, and so forth, all of which could lead to novel targets and interventions.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, traditional approaches based on pesticides to reduce vector populations or to repel vectors will remain the first line of defense against emerging and resurging VBDs. Development of new pesticides and formulations is critical because of emerging resistance to existing pesticides in vector populations and removal of other pesticides from the armamentarium of vector control (Hemingway et al., 2002, 2006). Societal aversion to the use of pesticides, because of perceived environmental and health effects, is of great concern. This has led to resistance to pesticide application even in the face of ongoing epidemics, such as WNV disease epidemics in New York and Colorado, and the removal of pesticides from control programs. In this regard, the discovery and subsequent use of DDT to control VBDs was a major achievement in public health (Attaran et al., 2000). However, indiscriminant DDT usage associated with agricultural practices led to detrimental effects in nontarget organisms, and DDT was banned even for public health use in indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs. New pesticides have proven to be more expensive, less stable, and less efficacious than DDT. Unfortunately, the widespread termination of DDT usage coincided with a resurgence in malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue, and other diseases that are transmitted principally indoors (Roberts et al., 1997; Gratz, 1999; Attaran et al., 2000). IRS of DDT disrupts the close association between the human host and important anthropophilic and endophilic vectors, such as Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, thereby reducing transmission and disease. Clearly, development of environmentally sensitive insecticides and formulations with the efficacy of DDT is a public health imperative.\n\nUnfortunately, no new public health pesticides for adult mosquitoes have been developed in more than 30 years (Hemingway et al., 2006). Pyrethroids are the cornerstone of vector control, whether for use in spraying, IRS, or bednets (Hawley et al., 2003). Knockdown resistance (kdr) as well as metabolic resistance to pyrethroids has emerged in An. gambiae populations in Africa. The effect that kdr in Anopheles populations may have on the efficacy of bednets and other control measures of this disease remains to be determined (Guillet et al., 2001; N’Guessan et al., 2007). Numerous studies are now documenting resistance in Ae. aegypti to commonly used pesticides targeting immatures and adults, potentially removing these from the armamentarium used by mosquito control officials to control dengue (see Eisen and Beaty in Chapter 2). For example, increasing resistance to temephos, which is widely used for control of Ae. aegypti, is of great concern (e.g., Lima et al., 2003). Resistance in vectors is a major problem and one that will undoubtedly worsen without the development of new, environmentally sensitive resistance-breaking pesticides.\n\nResponses The Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC) (Hemingway et al., 2006) was founded to address this and other needs and opportunities identified in the 2003 IOM report. The major objectives of the IVCC are to partner with industry to develop new pesticides and formulations and to develop new tools and approaches to manage vector control programs and mitigate pesticide resistance, focusing upon vector control in and around the house. The IVCC and a number of its projects are reviewed in papers by Coleman and Hemingway, Eisen and Beaty, and Scott in this report.\n\nPesticides The Committee recognized the public health imperative to develop new environmentally sensitive insecticides and formulations with the efficacy of DDT. The IVCC (Hemingway et al., 2006) is addressing this in a very unique and potentially powerful way. The first objective of the IVCC is to develop new insecticides and formulations for vector control. The loss of DDT and the potential loss of pyrethroids for vector control due to emerging resistance would be a public health catastrophe. The most expeditious way to develop new pesticides and formulations is to partner with the agrochemical industry. Unfortunately, as noted previously, no new adulticides have been developed in more than 30 years. This is partially due to perceived limited market size for public health pesticides and the costs and opportunity losses associated with bringing a public health pesticide product to market. The IVCC is partnering with industry to develop and deploy new public health pesticides and/or formulations for vector control. The cost of developing a new insecticide is in the range of $70 million. The IVCC will help address issues involving market failure by removing some of the risk associated with bringing a product forward. Partnering companies will revisit existing pesticide libraries with the intent of repurposing products, participate in the development of resistance-breaking pesticides, and even develop new active ingredients. The IVCC will provide the vector and disease expertise as well as field sites to conduct proof of concept and WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) trials, which would be difficult for industrial partners to do. Indeed, the latter issue is a major disincentive to companies becoming involved in public health pesticide development, which will be alleviated by partnerships with IVCC consortium institutions. Such private-public partnerships seem to be an excellent way to address critical needs in developing new public health pesticides.\n\nThe Committee recognized the public health needs for continued use of DDT in the face of VBD epidemics. Since domicile treatment with DDT has not been associated with major adverse environmental consequences, this practice should be allowed for vector control in public health emergencies until equally effective and inexpensive substitutes for DDT are developed. Care will be needed to ensure that availability of DDT for public health uses does not result in its use in agricultural applications. DDT controls VBDs, such as dengue and malaria, not only by killing vectors but also by repelling them (Roberts et al., 1997), thereby disrupting the close association between the human host and anthropophilic and endophagic vectors (e.g., An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti) and dramatically reducing opportunities for pathogen transmission. Clearly, development of efficacious and environmentally sensitive alternatives to DDT needs to become a major research objective, and one in which the issues of repellency receive equal attention with killing capacity.\n\nThe Committee also recommended using pesticides in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs, which incorporate established agricultural practices to mitigate the evolution of resistance (e.g., rotation of pesticide usage, inclusion of refugia with no pesticide applications), to provide better stewardship of pesticides, thereby extending their useful life. Incorporation of new molecular tools to diagnose pesticide resistance into routine control program activities would result in more effective and efficient pesticide usage. Development of novel strategies to prolong pesticide efficacy, such as negative cross-resistance, should be possible in this era of high-throughput screening (Pittendrigh and Gaffney, 2001). Determining the effect of pesticide resistance prevalence on control of VBDs would be of great value for risk assessment.\n\nThe renaissance in vector biology described below has also provided unprecedented information concerning pesticide resistance in vectors. Indeed, the publication of the genomes of the two major VBD vectors An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti (Holt et al., 2002; Nene et al., 2007) has provided dramatic insight into the molecular bases of resistance (Hemingway et al., 2002). This information can be exploited for developing new tools and approaches for monitoring and mitigating resistance (e.g., David et al., 2005), and for developing new pesticides for vector control.\n\nNew biopesticides and biocontrol agents to augment chemical pesticides The Committee also recommended renewed effort in developing a new generation of biocontrol agents, such as viruses and bacteria, which could augment chemical pesticides and be incorporated into IPM approaches for vector control. New formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis and B. sphaericus exhibit promise for vector control, even in tropical regions (Fillinger et al., 2003; Frederici, 2005). Baculoviruses (Becnel, 2006) or parvoviruses (Carlson et al., 2006) from mosquitoes may be useful for vector control. Other biopesticide agents could now be improved using molecular genetic approaches to make them more effective control agents. For example, viruses can be used to transduce effector molecules to enhance vector knockdown or manipulate vector phenotypes.\n\nInnovative interventions As noted earlier, for many years the vector was essentially viewed as a black box. Little was known about the molecular bases of vector competence, vector biology, vector immunology, and other vector phenotypes critical to pathogen transmission. Such information is essential for developing new interventions for VBD control.\n\nThe field of vector biology is currently experiencing a renaissance. Efforts of the MacArthur Foundation’s Network on the Biology of Parasite Vectors, as well as other agencies, institutions, and investigators, to infuse modern molecular and genetic approaches into vector research has led to the emergence of a new field of vector molecular biology and the resultant explosion of information on vectors. The genomes of two of the most important vectors of diseases to humankind—An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti—have now been sequenced (Holt et al., 2002; Nene et al., 2007), and other culicine and tick vector genomes are currently being sequenced. Major advances in vector transformation, genetics, and molecular biology have occurred, including the development of effective transformation strategies for culicine and anopheline mosquitoes (Coates et al., 1998; Catteruccia et al., 2000); new tools such as virus-based transducing systems and RNAi for gene expression and characterization in vectors (e.g., Johnson et al., 1999; Levashina et al., 2001); robust population genetic approaches for characterizing gene flow in vector populations (e.g., Lanzaro et al., 1995; Besansky et al., 1997; Gorrochotegui-Escalante et al., 2000); molecular taxonomic approaches for identifying vectors and cryptic species (e.g., Ballinger-Crabtree et al., 1992; Collins and Paskewitz, 1996); new insight into the vector immune system and the development of the field of vector immunology (Christophides et al., 2002; Bartholomay et al., 2003; Keene et al., 2004; Blandin et al., 2004; Waterhouse et al., 2007); new immunization strategies that incorporate vector salivary protein antigens to reduce pathogen transmission or other antigens for vector killing vaccines (e.g., Titus and Ribiero, 1988; Kamhawi et al., 2000); new insights and understanding of vector olfaction and host seeking (e.g., Fox et al., 2001; Pitts et al., 2004), which provides opportunities for developing new repellents and attractants for vector traps; new understanding of the infection, development, and transmission of pathogens by vectors (e.g., Dimopoulos et al., 1998; Sanders et al., 2005); new insights into the molecular biology of vectors (e.g., Barillas-Mury et al., 1995; Valenzuela et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2004); and the molecular manipulation of vectors to make them resistant to pathogen (dengue virus and malaria) transmission (e.g., Ito et al., 2002; Franz et al., 2006; Olson et al., 1996).\n\nThe accumulation of new knowledge of vector biology has been stunning. Indeed, the field moved from one mosquito gene in 1989 (James et al., 1989) to more than 14,000 genes with the publication of the An. gambiae genome in 2002 (Holt et al., 2002). In silico approaches have revolutionized gene identification and research in vector biology, and the post-genomics era in vector biology offers great promise for identifying new targets and approaches for control of vectors and VBDs. This renaissance in vector biology is reflected by the dramatic increase in vector grants at NIH, the development of a new vector biology study section at NIH, a dramatic increase in the number of publications in leading journals, and a dramatic increase in vector biology presentations and sessions at scientific society meetings. There is now unprecedented accumulation of information concerning vector biology, population genetics, genomics, immunity, and so forth. The task is to translate this research and knowledge into tools and approaches to combat VBDs.\n\nThe Committee also recommended continued or expanded research in areas pertinent to VBD control, including the following:\n\nNew repellents and attractants Repellents remain a first line of defense against emerging or resurging VBDs. Development of new personal and spatial repellents for prevention of VBDs was highly recommended by the committee as a potentially very fruitful area of research. Modern high-throughput and genomic approaches may permit identification of new molecules with repellent activity similar to that of DEET (and DDT), but without adverse effects. Understanding the molecular basis of vector olfaction and host seeking (Hill et al., 2002) may lead to new repellents and attractants to control vectors (Day et al., 2001).\n\nNovel immunization strategies for vector-borne diseases Insights into the molecular basis of vector-pathogen-host interactions provide new strategies to control VBDs (Willadsen, 2001; Foy et al., 2003). Immunizing hosts to vector-specific determinants of pathogen transmission (e.g., salivary effector proteins that enhance pathogen infection [Titus and Ribeiro, 1988]) could provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple pathogens or strains (Kamhawi et al., 2000; Valenzuela et al., 2003). Other critical determinants of pathogen infection of and transmission by vectors (e.g., vector proteolytic enzymes, which process arbovirus proteins and condition vector infection) could be targeted for transmission-blocking vaccines (Carter, 2001). Immunizing vertebrate hosts to immunologically-privileged vector antigens could kill or impair blood-feeding mosquitoes, a strategy that works for ticks (Willadsen, 2001), and may also be useful against mosquito vectors (e.g., An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti), which feed frequently on humans (Foy et al., 2002). Theoretically, these vectors would feed on other hosts (zooprophylaxis), thereby reducing pathogen transmission.\n\nNovel genetic approaches to the control of vector-borne diseases Genetic approaches in which vector populations are manipulated to become incompetent vectors also offer the potential to interrupt pathogen transmission. Such approaches would minimize potential environmental issues associated with pesticide usage and would not create an ecological vacuum that other vectors could occupy. The vector population could theoretically be genetically immunized to make it nonpermissive to pathogen transmission. The “immunogens” could be driven into vector populations by harnessing naturally occurring arthropod systems, such as transposable elements, symbionts (e.g., Wolbachia), or transducing viruses, which would be vector specific (Beaty, 2000). RNAi was recently documented as a robust immune response to arboviruses in vectors (Keene et al., 2004), and was quickly exploited to develop transgenic mosquitoes immunized to prevent dengue infection (Franz et al., 2006). Proof of principle has been provided that vectors can be molecular manipulated to make them refractory to arboviruses and trypansome and malaria parasites (Olson et al., 1996; Beard et al., 2002; Ito et al., 2002; Franz et al., 2006). Considering the amazing amount of recent progress in vector molecular biology, continued research in this area may well provide dramatically new approaches for VBD control.\n\nSummary The renaissance in vector biology is providing unprecedented information concerning the molecular basis of vector biology and critical vector phenotypes that could be exploited for vector control. Testimony to the growth of the field from the black box of the vector to the renaissance in vector molecular biology is the formation of VectorBase (Lawson et al., 2007)—a critical resource for collecting and making available the explosion of information concerning vectors that has emerged in recent years from investigations of vector molecular biology, genomics, population genetics, and pathogen-vector-host interactions, etc. Undoubtedly, this information can be exploited to develop alternate, novel strategies for vector control, for disrupting host-vector interactions, and for interrupting pathogen transmission.\n\nGeographic Information Systems and Robust Models for Predicting and Preventing Vector-Borne Diseases\n\nThe Recommendation: CDC, DoD, and NIH should work with state and local public health agencies and academia to expand efforts to exploit geographic information systems and robust models for predicting and preventing the emergence of VB and zoonotic diseases.\n\nBackground Because biological and environmental factors condition transmission of pathogens from vectors or vertebrate amplification or reservoir hosts to humans, temporal models based on climate data to predict outbreaks of sporadically occurring diseases and GIS-based models to predict spatial risk patterns have great potential for providing predictive capability for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. A GIS spatial backbone can also be incorporated into a computer-based decision support system as a tool for analysis and presentation of relevant environmental, entomological, or epidemiological data (e.g., presence of larval habitat for anopheline mosquitoes, areas with especially high vector abundance, or locations of human disease cases). This type of system can revolutionize surveillance, risk assessment, and prevention strategies for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, manage and mitigate pesticide resistance, and permit focusing of resources and talents on prevention efforts in the areas at greatest risk.\n\nResponses In the United States, climate-based models to predict outbreaks of rare but severe vector-borne or zoonotic diseases have been developed for hanta-virus pulmonary syndrome and plague (Glass et al., 2000, 2002; Hjelle and Glass, 2000; Enscore et al., 2002). GIS- and/or remote sensing-based models predicting the presence of vector breeding habitat, acarological or entomological risk of exposure to vectors (vector abundance or density), or risk of pathogen exposure (presence or abundance of infected vectors or vertebrates, presence or incidence of human disease) have been developed for a variety of diseases including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, plague, and WNV disease in the United States, and dengue and malaria in tropical areas (e.g., Kitron et al., 1991; Glass et al., 1995, 2000, 2002; Boone et al., 2000; Hay et al., 2000; Brownstein et al., 2002; Rogers et al., 2002; Peterson et al., 2005; Diuk-Wasser et al., 2006; Eisen et al., 2006, 2007a,b). GIS-based modeling approaches also have been used to study spatial patterns of gene flow in key mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti (e.g., Gorrochetegui-Escalante et al., 2000; Bosio et al., 2005; da Costa-Ribeiro et al., 2007) and rodent reservoirs of Sin Nombre virus (Root et al., 2003). Incorporation of GIS into computer-based decision support systems for management of VBDs is described in the paper by Eisen and Beaty in this report.\n\nTo date, there has been a tendency in the research community to stovepipe GIS-based risk modeling approaches for VBDs to either vector data or epidemiological data. This is highly unfortunate because these two types of data have weaknesses but also complementary strengths. For example, although the location of sampling sites for vector data readily can be georeferenced, human behavior may strongly impact risk of vector and pathogen contact. On the other hand, a human disease case, which unequivocally demonstrates contact with an infected vector, often is accompanied by questionable information regarding the pathogen exposure site. To overcome these issues, models combining independently derived estimates for vector risk and epidemiological risk are needed (Eisen et al., 2006).\n\nIn the case of GIS-derived risk models for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases based on epidemiological data in the United States, plague and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome models are most reliable because probable sites of pathogen exposure are determined through comprehensive case investigations carried out by state health agencies or CDC (Eisen et al., 2007a,b). The more common but less severe Lyme disease and WNV disease are far more problematic in this regard because the quality of information from case files regarding probable sites of pathogen exposure is highly variable, which can compromise the output model. Simply put, the tremendous potential for using GIS modeling approaches in spatial epidemiology and ecoepidemiology currently is severely compromised for many VBDs based on poor quality of information regarding pathogen exposure site (Eisen and Eisen, 2007).\n\nAdvances in GIS technology and the ever-increasing use of the Internet as a primary knowledge resource present tremendous but currently largely untapped possibilities for disseminating information regarding spatially explicit risk of exposure to VBDs. Using a web mapping approach, static risk maps can readily be converted to a dynamic web-based information delivery system where selecting an area of interest provides a close-up view showing risk patterns for labeled spatial units (e.g., counties, zip codes, or census tracts) and the location of major roads, population centers, and other easily recognizable features. This approach will facilitate information transfer regarding VBD risk to both the medical community and the public at large.\n\nIndeed, web-based delivery of research information is a sadly neglected field that in the future can help to bridge the gap between the research community, the public health community, and the public. Much information of immediate interest and practical use to public health practitioners and the U.S. public now languishing in scientific journals could be effectively broadcast through web-based information delivery systems developed by academic or public health institutions. Positive examples from the academic side are scarce but include the University of Rhode Island web-based Tick Encounter Resource Center4 and the Iowa State University Medical Entomology Laboratory website for mosquito- and tick-borne disease.5\n\nSummary There has been an explosion in information technology solutions to prediction, prevention, and control of VBDs in recent years. This includes implementation of computer-based VBD surveillance systems (e.g., CDC’s ArboNET and WHO’s DengueNet), development of decision support systems for VBD management, a plethora of GIS-based models predicting risk of exposure to vectors or VBDs, and movement toward web-based delivery of GIS-based risk maps and other pertinent and evidence-based information related to prevention and control of VBDs. One main task ahead is to adapt the technological solutions now being incorporated into routine surveillance and control activities in developed countries for use in resource-poor countries in desperate need of VBD management solutions.\n\nLack of Adequate Training and Training Models\n\nThe past 50 years have seen revolutions in medical, biomedical, and public health training, which have pulled apart many of the shared values and approaches that once formed the basis of natural interdisciplinary alliances. Throughout the 1930s epidemiology and microbiology were closely allied fields within biomedicine. When the United States began its experiment with schools of public health in the 1920s, they were located within medical schools because of the obvious importance of the medical arts and basic biomedical sciences, but were also established with the conscious intent to forge interdisciplinary partnerships with the social sciences (Fee and Acheson, 1991).\n\nWhether or not this was an idea doomed to failure from the beginning, as many Europeans seem to believe, it has worked poorly with respect to the particular question of vector-borne diseases. Few schools of public health are found outside the United States; of the 33 American schools, most are now free-standing (i.e., not within, and in general not closely allied with, medical schools). Indeed, it is customary to view the two as being in competition. Infectious disease epidemiology, so recently the bedrock of most schools of public health, has been marginalized in all but a few. Public health laboratory programs, long required for accreditation, have been dropped. Most graduates of public health masters programs have had no infectious disease experience beyond an epidemiology survey course; in most schools, students desiring solid infectious disease epidemiology training have difficulty acquiring it.\n\nEven epidemiology departments have been largely abandoned to the study of chronic and behavioral disorders, fueled by the “massaging” of large data sets with sophisticated computer programs rather than “hands-on” or “real-world” experiences. American-born physicians have also become something of an endangered species within public health schools, most of which have become focused on social sciences, as well as health services administration and health education. Even maternal and child health programs have often tilted toward program administration. With the exception of a few excellent schools, prominent among them the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, public health schools seem incapable of making substantial contributions to the creation of a professional and scientific workforce engaged in interdisciplinary approaches to vector-borne diseases in their current configurations.\n\nBeyond schools of public health, the picture remains grim. Nearly a century after the “Flexner report” (1910), American medical schools have been gradually squeezing out the basic sciences in favor of courses in ethics, intercultural sensitivity, doctor–patient relationships, and so forth. In some schools anatomy is now an elective. In others, resident physicians, whose counterparts three decades ago would have been delivering babies and assisting at major surgeries, now stand waiting at the bedside to have procedure cards signed for drawing 10 cc of blood from an arm vein. Medical education is expensive, and the public wants doctors with whom they can empathize. At the same time, the biomedical sciences have become increasingly complex and technical, and thus less accessible to medical students and medical graduates with generalist educations that include only survey courses in the basic sciences. Some medical schools (e.g., Duke) have experimented with aggressive programs that emphasize scientific training (O’Connor et al., 2007), but most of these, however excellent, are not oriented toward tropical medicine, epidemiology, or vector-borne diseases.\n\nTwo approaches that have worked extremely well, as judged by the quality and output of scientific work and the record of professional development of vector-borne disease and tropical medicine researchers, have been those of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The DoD has long maintained sophisticated overseas labs in partnership with scientists from host countries (e.g., the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science [AFRIMS] in Bangkok, Thailand; and the Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 [NAMRU-3] in Masr-el-Gedida, Egypt). These and a number of other overseas laboratories have been leaders in interdisciplinary and international tropical medicine research. They have also trained several generations of leaders in tropical medicine/vector-borne diseases, including researchers based in preventive medicine, microbiology, entomology, and other allied fields. Unfortunately, however, these programs are “one of a kind,” may be difficult to duplicate outside the military environment, and are expensive to operate. In recent years, the military emphasis on the “warfighter” mission, as well as the outside contracting of many medical services, has led to concerns that continued existence of the overseas research programs may be imperiled.\n\nThe CDC has for decades been involved in national and international vector-borne disease research and investigation. In recent years, these activities have been sustained even though strained by losses of key scientists. A different challenge has been a greater emphasis for young Atlanta-based scientists on program management, with fewer opportunities to do hands-on work, including overseas field work, in part a result of the growing expertise of state health departments and foreign ministries of health who are less dependent on the once unique outbreak investigative skills of the CDC. While historically successful in supporting solid research and training a cadre of leaders, the ability of relevant CDC programs to expand seems limited; like the DoD programs, the CDC vector-borne and international programs may be “one of a kind,” resistant to duplication, and easily saturated."
