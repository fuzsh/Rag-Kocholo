E-mail: metrodesk@plaind.com\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and\n\nKen Skapik\n\nand his wife,\n\nSandy Stern\n\n, were driving on I-480 after seeing a ho-hum show with tickets someone had given them.\n\nAcross town, their friends were celebrating a birthday at a trendy Tremont restaurant. A year ago, the Beachwood couple would have been at the party. But between November and January, when hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs to a souring economy, Ken and Sandy were laid off, too.\n\nNow there was no room in the family budget for extras. Still, Ken felt guilty when he heard his wife lamenting about missing the party. As he drove, Ken told Sandy they should splurge. It would probably cost them $60 or $70, but what the heck.\n\nIt was tempting. But they had one daughter in college, another headed there and a slew of other obligations. Sandy, tears brimming, told Ken they'd better just head home to watch a movie. Ken agreed, but after they pulled in the drive, the couple parted.\n\nSandy headed to her computer. Ken walked the dog. And in the empty space between them, at least for that night, hung all the stress, fear, grief, anger, shame and other emotions that come with any job loss -- let alone a job loss times two. Nearly 600,000 Ohioans received unemployment benefits in March, about 10 percent of the state's work force. The Plain Dealer is chronicling the journeys of 88 people laid off in Northeast Ohio during an extended series called \"Help Wanted.\" Included in the group are Ken and Sandy and two other married couples looking for jobs.\n\nCounselors and psychologists say that these rough economic times are tough on relationships -- particularly those in which both spouses suddenly lose income.\n\nCouples like Ken and Sandy, who have successfully navigated hardships before in their marriages -- both were laid off in 1991 -- are likely to survive and even grow stronger, some experts say. But if a marriage is already frayed, the double whammy of losing jobs might leave their relationship in shreds.\n\n\"When one person loses a job, much of the stress goes on the other person as a safety net. But when both are unemployed, there is no net,\" said Francis Chiappa, president of Horizons Counseling Services in Parma Heights.\n\nIt's important, he said, for the couple to see themselves as a team.\n\nThe Hanuses of Solon lost their economic net within three weeks -- Rick was laid off Feb. 6., Colleen on Feb. 25.\n\n\"It's hard being together 24/7,\" Colleen said last week. \"I joke all the time that I'm either going to kill him or he's going to kill me or everything is going to be OK.\"\n\nThe Generation X couple -- who were married 17 years ago on Saturday -- have two kids, two Weimaraners and a schedule full of coaching youth teams, volunteering at church and Boy Scouts.\n\nRick marvels how they got everything done when they were both working. For most of the marriage, he has been the easygoing one in the relationship. \"We're oil and vinegar, and I'm definitely the vinegar,\" Colleen said.\n\n'Help Wanted' on WCPN, WVIZ\n\nThe Plain Dealer is collaborating with WCPN FM/90.3 and WVIZ Channel 25 Ideastream on the \"Help Wanted\" series. Throughout the year, there will be multiple reports, interviews, videos and discussions about the experiences of the jobless.\n\nBut now Colleen finds herself in a new role. She is Rick's support. Sometimes, she fears her husband blames himself for losing his general manager job. She tells him it wasn't his fault.\n\n\"But like every guy, he doesn't talk,\" Colleen said. \"He says he's doing OK, but I think it's harder for him. He's the man, he's supposed to be making money.\"\n\nThe family has cut back. They stopped calling for pizza. They're driving a 22-year-old car Rick's parents gave them. And now, even the kids stop themselves before asking for things at the grocery store.\n\nBut there are steep challenges.\n\nRick, who worked for the same company 15 years, received no severance. Colleen's small severance runs out this month.\n\nSometimes they argue about money. Colleen said Rick wants her to make some of the tough decisions and she insists they make them together.\n\nThat kind of sharing is important, said Bill Boomer, director of Catholic Charities' marriage and family ministry. There is a temptation for couples to get anxious and pull away from each other, but that's the worst thing they can do, he said.\n\n\"Any time there's a conflict, particularly about money, remember the vows: For richer or poorer, for better or worse,\" Boomer said. \"Remind yourself and verbally tell each other that.\"\n\nIn 1991, the commercial real estate market tanked when Ken and Sandy lived in Washington, D.C., and both lost their jobs. That time seems worlds away now even though both find themselves jobless again.\n\n\"Back then, our biggest expense was diapers,\" Sandy said.\n\nAt the time, the couple had a 20-month-old daughter and a second on the way, yet they confidently remade their lives. They moved to Cleveland -- Sandy's hometown. Ken used what he learned in general contracting and reinvented a career in retail installation (helping CVS, for example, redesign all the former Revco stores). And Sandy went on to a lucrative career as an executive recruiter.\n\nThis time around, Ken is 51, Sandy is 52, and their two daughters are close to launching lives of their own. Expectations, fears and responsibilities have changed.\n\nTo cope, Sandy works out at the gym nearly every day and started cooking.\n\nKen, meanwhile, threw himself into the hunt for new work. He spent last week on a road trip visiting old clients in back-to-back meetings from Atlanta to Tennessee.\n\nIt's been a time of reflection for both of them -- about themselves, each other and their marriage. Ken last week described two epiphanies:\n\nThe first happened about a month ago on the Saturday night they missed the Tremont party. In the past, Ken said, he would have dismissed Sandy's sadness, telling her there is nothing they could do about it.\n\n\"I realized I was cutting her off emotionally,\" he said last week, choking on his own emotion. Sandy \"wears her emotions on her sleeve,\" he said, and he finally realized that he needed to let her do that. It's what balances his pragmatism.\n\nHis second epiphany came a couple of months before. Ken said he got up early one morning and noticed Sandy was awake, staring at the ceiling.\n\n\"All my life, I wake up and in 10 seconds, I'm going to make coffee. I don't sit and think about the day,\" Ken said. \"But Sandy will sit there and think. She does all that worrying for the both of us.\"\n\nNeither of them has found a job, so there's no wiping away the worry. But Ken struck on something that has helped.\n\nWhen Ken and Sandy married, they canceled a honeymoon in Europe after Ken's mom died. Last year, the couple finally made it there, visiting Portugal and Spain.\n\nEvery day, they walked from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m., took a two-hour nap, and then headed out for dinner and more adventures. On the flight home, before they knew their jobs were in jeopardy, Ken and Sandy agreed to start saving for a second trip.\n\nThose savings are dashed now, but when Sandy is stressed out, Ken tells her to think about those afternoons in Barcelona sitting in a cafe together, drinking a bottle of wine.\n\n\"The long-term goal is that this kind of life in Barcelona is going to be our lifestyle,\" Sandy said. Ken said he thinks that long-delayed honeymoon -- or at least the memory -- has strengthened their marriage during this rough time.\n\nSandy agreed: \"It helps to work as a team.\""
