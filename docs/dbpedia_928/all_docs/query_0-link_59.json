        "text": "Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, can you tell me where and when you were born, and something about the community that you grew up in? 0:06 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, let me give you my full name. My name is R., first initial, Kelly, K-E-L-L-Y, Bryant, B-R-Y-A-N-T, Jr. Now, I never used my first name, never have, my father never used it, so everybody called us Kelly all these years. So I just didn't want to confuse people about calling me by my first name and I don't even recognize it when I hear it. I was born on September the 22nd, 1917. I'm now 77 years old. I was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina in Edgecombe County, and I went to this public schools there in Rocky Mount and finished Booker T. Washington High School in 1935. I left Rocky Mount and went to college at Hampton University and finished there under a work year program in May 1940. And I've taken some additional courses at North Carolina Central and bunch of other places around, but no additional degree work. 0:19 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Rocky Mount is a small town, about 75 miles east of Durham. And at the time that I was in school there in the '30s, there were roughly, I would imagine about maybe eight or 10,000 Blacks if that many. And the school itself was a minimum high school. By that I mean that the courses and whatnot there, even the facility, was a minimum facility. For instance, there was no cafeteria there, no gymnasium, no industrial arts or anything of this sort. In fact, we played basketball in tobacco warehouses and we played football in the city ballpark. And so we just didn't have any facilities. 1:42 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We did have an auditorium and we had a home ec department that would prepare soup on rainy days when kids couldn't go home or go to the nearest store, this kind of a thing. But that was about the extent of what we had. The science department at a few jars with a frog or snakes or something in them and maybe two, three Bunsen burners and that was about it. It was an 11-year high school. I finished high school at age 17, but I think I got a good background because I went off to a university to take some courses that I had never heard of. And in fact, I had never heard the word accounting. It was not in our vocabulary. And the only typewriter in the building was a hand-me-down type machine in the principal's office from some other school there in the city. So even though there were limitations, our teachers were very thorough. 2:38 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I lived across the street from the principal's home who housed several teachers. And so if anything went wrong, word got home about the time I did. And if I'm out in the street playing and back then in those years, and hadn't gotten my homework, they would ask me, \"You got your homework yet?\" This kind of business. Of course, that made it necessary that we had to toe the line. They were interested people, they visited your home and they kept parents informed of all kinds of activities at school. So my people were very much interested in our being educated, and so we had to toe the line. 3:53 Paul Ortiz Where did the teachers come from, who taught at the high school? Were they local orâ€” 4:41 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Really, there were only one or two of them that I knew their schooling. There were some teachers in the high school had went to what is now North Carolina Central University. Some from Shaw. There was some from St. Augustine's and there was one from Wilberforce in Ohio and Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte. But now there could have been others from Fayetteville State and from Elizabeth City and some other schools. But at that time, all of them are from Black universities, Black schools. And we had some good teachers. 4:51 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We had one teacher who finished Howard University, and her name was Anna Easter Brown, and she taught history in the high school and she wanted to make sure that we knew Black history. So she would teach the American history up until maybe Christmas some point, and then she would take out her book by Carter Woodson on Black history. And of course, above her blackboard in her room, she had pictures of all of the outstanding Blacks. It seems that there was a company at that time that had gotten all of these pictures and framed them in some kind of a uniform manner. So they made a nice display across the top of a blackboard. 5:43 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. If someone came from the office of the city schools, Rocky Mount Schools, and came into her room and she was talking some of this Black history, she would just change the conversation and we always laughed and talked about it because we would say yes, the kind of things that she did, if she was talking about Booker T. Washington and somebody walked in and she starts talking about George Washington crossing the Potomac if this guy was there. (laughs) 6:39 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But anyway, she was unusual, and incidentally, she was one of the founders of the AKA Sorority, which is one of the larger sororities of the Black women. And she used to live right there in Rocky Mount and she's buried there, but she was famous for her Black history. And it made an impression on me because my father used to talk a lot about Blacks that were considered outstanding, and I can remember him talking about W.E.B. Du Bois and William Pickens and Booker Washington and some of the others that he just talked about. 7:19 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So when I got to Hampton and they had what they called a musical arts program, and these people would come in and talk on the arts part, I guess. And I got a chance to meet some of these folk, and I started setting up some autographs and I got a collection of maybe 75, 6 autographs now. I started back renewing it after 60 years almost. But anyway, I have such people in there that I actually met at Hampton as W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson and George Washington Carver, Mary McLeod Bethune, Adams Clayton Powell, Paul Robeson, just gobs of them. Matthew Henson and Dorothy Maynor and Mary McLeod Bethune, Hubert Julian. Just gobs of these autographs. And I use them now in talking to kids at school on Black history. I just carry my autographs, tell about them, show them the actual signatures of these people and how I got the autograph and little history about them. Now let's get back to your question. 8:03 Paul Ortiz Okay. Well, I'm interested because it seems like Black history played such a role in your life, as far as yourself, in going back to your high school days, why do you think the administration at the high school was not enthused about Black history? You mentioned that the teacher would change the subject. 9:21 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, it was up until a few years ago, and I would speak certainly up until Martin Luther King or even after Martin Luther King, school administrations weren't concerned at all about teaching Black history. They wanted you to have American history, talking about all of these days from Virginia Dare through the Civil War and all this sort of thing. And this is what was being taught in our schools and yet there were people who felt the importance of our knowing. And so there, at some point it had kind of died away to a point that we lost some of the history, an area of history, because we didn't have writers to keep it up. Now, I remember back years ago when I was in college, there was a guy in the Tuskegee, Alabama, whose name was Monroe Works, I guess, W-O-R-K-S, I believe it was. 9:47 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And he wrote what we, he called a Negro yearbook, and some copies are still around, but I don't know what year he stopped. But I can remember when I left Hampton in 1940, I believe it was still available, and that gave us gobs of information on Blacks, Black organizations and what people were active in certain areas and all this sort of thing. He even gave street address, telephone numbers and all this sort of thing. I had called the Durham Library about those books and they said they had a few copies, but I'm not sure it's whether they have a set over a period of years. But back in the '30s where I was, they had a whole set of these books and they added to them every year. 10:58 Paul Ortiz It sounds like Black history in your high school with Mrs. Brown was almost like a adventure [indistinct 00:12:03] to talk about it. [indistinct 00:12:10] 11:52 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, she had to do it on what we used to call the QT. (laughs) That means do it quietly and not make any big issues out of it. And when we get together and talk about it in our reunions, and we had our 50th, we working towards our 60th, which will be next year, we laughed and talked about the teachers and what they had done. In fact, at our 50th reunion, I think there were three of our teachers there. There is still one living in New York and we haven't seen her all these years. There may be some others that we've lost track of, but next year we going to invite this one if she can come or send us a message and a picture or something and we'll send her a picture of what we have left of our class. It wasn't a large class, I don't think it was but 26 of us in our high school class, so it was a small high school. I don't know you had more than 400 children in whole high school. 12:12 Paul Ortiz What role did Booker T. Washington High School play in the wider community? 13:17 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, it served as a focal point. We had an auditorium, so events that were not religious, for instance, could be held in this auditorium, like musical programs, plays. I can remember participating in plays, school plays and concerts and lectures. And periodically, we had some things that the school sponsored that were of community interest and we participated in those two. For instance, I can remember some fellow coming through Rocky Mount, who was a sailor on some ship. I don't remember what ship it was. And as he traveled, he would stop in communities and just talk about his experiences on ship, onboard ship in the Navy. And we found that kind of a thing different because we had no other way of getting some of that contact in a small community. 13:30 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We had small theater, but that was cowboy and Indians and nothing necessarily educational about it. And so the people had to really pull together and form programs and community groups to help educate and entertain us and them. Back there then, we had people in the community that were musicians and they would put together singings and things for special occasions, particularly holidays like Easter would have what they call the Easter Cantata, and they'd have Christmas singing and carol singing and all this sort of thing. So they were together in that type of thing. 14:40 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And then during the year when Roosevelt became president, he started out his alphabet organizations. Some of those were organized in Rocky Mount. And I can remember my mother teaching music on one of those programs. And there was an orchestra that was put together. Excuse me. She taught reading to adults. She was a graduate at Shaw University. I don't know how far my father went in school, I don't think high school. He was born in 1886, so when he was 15, 16 years old, that was about 1900. So it wasn't much anything there. Cut that offâ€” [INTERRUPTION 00:16:49] 15:32 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, you were talking about your parents and I was wondering what your family life was like? [indistinct 00:16:58] 16:41 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, I thought we had a good family, even though the Depression caused some problems. Now, my father was a grocery man and he and his brother started in business there in Rocky Mount, oh, I guess about 1908, 09, 10, 11, something along there. And then they decided to open separate businesses in different section of the city. And when I was about 10 years old, he had five or six stores in different parts of the little town of Rocky Mount and two cafÃ©s. But the Depression came in the thirties and he had to close some of them because he had granted credit to a lot of people and they weren't able to pay, so he couldn't manage. 16:59 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So he left Rocky Mount to try to seek work, and I think he left in '29. He came back in '31. No, it must have been 1930. He wasn't gone too long. He came back and tried to put things back together, tried to save our home place and all this sort of thing. And then in March 1931, my mother's mother, who lived here in Durham, died. And so he brought me to Durham to the funeral, of course, the whole family was here. But I came a day later and after the funeral was over, he told us that he was going try to find work somewhere else. And he left and went to Niles, Ohio and worked on a steel mill there for a while. And of course, that wasn't permanent work apparently, and there wasn't enough in it for him to send very much money back to help us. My mother continued to try to operate in one of the stores, and then it finally folded sometime during the '30s because then after that I went to work another grocery man, working after school at night and on weekends. 18:04 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But he left Ohio and went to Buffalo, New York, Chicago, and oh, I don't know, he went everywhere. He ended up in California, Sacramento, and at certain seasons he would go, he got a job as a supervisor of farm workers. These people had picked stuff and he would travel with them from San Bernardino to Sacramento and back and forth. And then he got ill and we tried to get him to come back home and he said that he couldn't fly. He was fearful of planes and his condition wouldn't allow him to cross the mountains. I guess the air was thin or something. He told him that he couldn't come back. 19:40 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So then we would go out to see him, and I made an effortâ€”my sister went out to see him twice. I made my plans to go out to see him, to be out there in July, and he died in March of 1953. So then we flew his body back to Rocky Mount and he was buried then. And see, I was out of college and I was working here in Durham then, but the last time I saw him was here at my grandmother's funeral in 1931, the last time I really saw him. But he kept in touch. He tried to help me while I was in school and all that sort of thing, and did what he could. 20:32 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, when your father was running the grocery business, the name of some of these stores? 21:20 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, Bryant's Grocery and they put his name, R. Kelly Bryant's Grocery Store on some of them, but it was Bryant's Grocery Stores and his brother ran one and his was named W.A. Bryant Grocery. He just kept one store. Then after he died in the '20s, his wife continued to operate that one. His wife and children. I think he died in 1922. 21:38 Paul Ortiz So during the 1920s, there was a Black business district in Rocky Mount? 22:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Oh, yes. 22:03 Paul Ortiz What would be the kinds of businesses, connection between Black businesses were there? 22:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, in Rocky Mount, a small place like that, we had a block, two blocks really, and we had a drug store on each corner. We had at one time two theaters, any number of restaurants, at that time they called them cafÃ©s. And we had two funeral homes in that district. There was a pool room, which is called a billiard parlor, whatever it is, billiard parlor. And what else was in that block? They had the shoe repairman and the shoe shine place, and then the doctors' offices were above the drug stores and we had lawyers also located in those buildings and beauticians. Then a little further down, we had dry cleaners, filling stations and a assortment of other little buildings. I can't even remember what some of them were there, barbershops, things like that. 22:18 Paul Ortiz This was within a one block radius? 23:39 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah. Well, let's look at it like this. This was what was known as Thomas Street. This was Main Street, and this was where the railroad went down the middle of Main Street. Have you ever been to Rocky Mount, North Carolina? About 75 miles from here. But anyway, you probably wouldn't have gone downtown. Main Street is divided by a railroad of the Atlantic Coastline runs right down the middle of the street, double tracks. And on this side, it's one way going this way, on this side, one way coming this way. And the county stops at the railroad. When you cross the railroad, you're in another county. 23:44 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So we live on the Edgecombe County side, and I had relatives living on the Nash County side and the elementary schools that I went to on the Nash side. So we had to walk across town to go to school, but the high school on this side. 24:22 Paul Ortiz In Edgecombe County? 24:38 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. In Edgecombe County. Now the stores were located along this block on this side and down this block. So it was kind of a thing like this. 24:40 Paul Ortiz And that was Davis or Main? 24:50 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. This is on Thomas? 24:53 Paul Ortiz On Thomas. 24:54 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. On Thomas Street. 24:54 Paul Ortiz On Thomas. 24:55 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. This is on Thomas Street, facing Thomas. This was facing Main, and the main downtown started here and went this way. 24:55 Paul Ortiz Okay. 25:02 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But we were just at the edge of the downtown area. Then later there was a strip of businesses, maybe six or eight little small shops that came on in this block. But that was about it. And scattered around in Rocky Mount, we had grocery stores all around, and the nearest grocery store to this site was about two and a half blocks. You come down to this corner, turn this way, and this was in the second block on this street, there was a grocery store, print shop, filling stations. There were a couple grocery stores. My daddy owned one there. And so we just had dry cleaning establishments, garages, all around, scattered various places. 25:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Then over on this side in Nash County, there was a little strip of maybe about six or eight businesses, a little corner over here. My daddy had a store in that one too. Then he had another one way over on the other side of Rocky Mount which was called South Rocky Mount. And then from this point, he had had two down in this end of the town. Then he had one over on the highway, on Raleigh Road area. So they were scattered all around and he had it going pretty well. And back there then, they had something called the Colored Merchants Association. Now, I'm not sure as to where it was based, but they were collective buyers, and so the stores would get together and order from this particular warehouse, and in fact, they had some canneries to even put the names on the cans. Like Kroger's now has its name on the cans. Well, they were doing that back there then. 25:46 Paul Ortiz Huh. 26:42 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So he was active in that. 26:46 Paul Ortiz So Black families, say, during the 1920s, could go to the Black business district and take care of just about every need? 26:50 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Except for clothing and furniture and stuff. They didn't have that there, you see? But all the otherâ€”Yeah, had their own dentists and everything. Then another thing about that community was that it was a railroad center. It still is to a limited extent. But then they had what they call the Emerson shop of the Atlantic Coastline Railroad, and they would change engines. They were using coal then, the steam engines. So a train would pull the cars from Richmond where the line began, from Richmond to Rocky Mount. 27:01 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And in some instances, they pull it from Richmond to Florence, South Carolina. But whatever, they came to Rocky Mount, they would refuel with coal and they would change crews. And so you had a shop that would even repair trains there, engines. They had a round house, they called it. And it was almost like one of these old fashionedâ€”It was like an old fashioned grease rack where you drove your car right over a pit and the people would go down in the pit and change the oil and all that sort ofâ€” 27:46 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, they did engines the same way. They'd pull them right on this thing, and it was like a clock. They would pull it in here and then this turntable would turn around and then they would go and put it in a stall, you see? And then another one come in, they'd put it in this stall. And so they had the engines all the way around. They called it a roundhouse. And they had crews there, and Blacks had a lot of jobs in that area at that time, and it was considered good pay. And I don't imagine those people were getting more than $200 a month, if that much. But back there then, teachers were working for $60 a month, back there then, so it was considered good money, whatever it is. So it weren't necessarily a social set, but they were a little higher up, what you call above middle income people that worked there, lived there. 28:18 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, I think you mentioned you did have brothers and sisters. 29:13 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I had one brother and well, there were really, originally, our family, really, there were five of us. One died way before I was born, and then one boy died when I was about 10 years old. But there were three of us left to grow up together. And my sister is still living, she's older and she's here in Durham. My brother died in 1978. And so that's about the family right now, just my sister and myself. Of course, we have other relatives. We got plenty of relatives. We have family reunions on both sides, father and my mother's side. So we got a lot of relatives. 29:23 Paul Ortiz When you were growing up, would your relatives visits or did you have a reunion tradition then? [indistinct 00:30:19] 30:07 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. They didn't call it a reunion. And I guess what we did, more or less, they would visit. People were different, I guess, than we are now. We would go and travel, by old cars, whatever, train, and we'd go visit with friends, relatives, or we attended funerals, which we all got back together and this kind of thing. But there was a good rapport on my father's side of the family and on my mother's side of the family. Now, my grandmotherâ€”And my mother was from Durham, and on her side of the family, we would come to Durham every summer, stay with my grandmother up here. That's how I got to know Durham so well. And then my father's mother was right there in Rocky Mount, so we just walk over to her house almost anytime, on the way from school, we'd go by to see her and this kind of thing. And so we were a close knit family, still are down that way. A whole lot of Bryants down in Rocky Mount now. 30:18 Paul Ortiz Who was responsible for the decisions made in the family for, say, budget or financial? 31:18 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. To tell you the truth, I would assume that my father did. However, after he left, my mother carried on. So I would imagine that she did a good bit of it too, particularly with the financial side of the family, because she was able to carry on after he left. And she kept things together the best she could. Incidentally, we lost everything we had during that Depression, the home place and everything. 31:32 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So we moved out of the house and that's when my mother got involved in some of this WPA work. And she played organist for a couple of churches and she taught music. And believe it or not, I can remember when she was teaching music at 15 cents a lesson. And I think people charge, what? $10 for 45 minutes, in some place, $20 or whatever it is. But back there then, that kept us going, kept us alive. And the little work that I got, I don't recall my sister ever working, but I worked at the filling station at one time and a print shop. And most of the time I worked was at a grocery store and I worked after school at night and on weekends. 31:59 Paul Ortiz So the grocery store was your first employment? 32:52 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah. Well, I knew about that because I was around my daddy's stores all the time. So I just knew more about it and liked it. When I went to college, I went to take business because I wanted to get into business like my daddy was. 32:54 Paul Ortiz What happened to the Black business district or were other businesses impacted by the Depression as well? 33:11 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. The problem that downtowns had after shopping centers came. The same thing affected that area, but they're still there in Rocky Mount, some of those businesses. I don't mean the same ones, but that area is still a business area. And they're not as many boarded-up windows and doors as you find in some cities as you travel through or as many as we got here in downtown Durham. We got some boarded-up windows and doors around here. Another thing that was interesting about that era, and it still is true, being a rural type place, it was a tobacco town too. 33:22 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It was a center for sale of tobacco, but being rural like it was, people would come to town, they called it, on the first Saturday of each month. And these farmers would come in and buy whatever they needed and equipment and instruments, they would buy some of their meats, like salted meat if they didn't fix it themselves on the farm and furniture and things like that. Would bring their trucks and wagons in and buy stuff and carry it back home. And they always met on the first Saturday and families would meet and this block would be just crowded with people on the first Saturday. And I had forgotten that. So one day, in recent years, it's been in the last five years, I was riding through Rocky Mount on a Saturday morning. I said, \"What in the world? They got a riot going on here today?\" (laughs) And then it hit me that that was the first Saturday. So the people still do that. 34:02 Paul Ortiz Still do that? 34:56 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Still do that. Come in town on the first Saturday. 34:56 Paul Ortiz Did you go to those as a child, did your family go? [indistinct 00:35:10] 35:01 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. On this first Saturday? 35:03 Paul Ortiz On the first Saturday. 35:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, it was more or less the rural people coming in and they would let the others know. \"I'd be down on Thomas Street and I'd get there about 10:00.\" And if you wanted [indistinct 00:35:22], they'd go up and talk, sit and eat in the restaurants and whatnot and eat ice cream in the drug stores and talk and stand out and lean against their cars and wagons. So it was a kind of a get-together. And even though you may not necessarily have been family connected, you might be a good friend of mine. \"I'll see you in Rocky Mount on the first Saturday.\" And they meet, do whatever they doing, transact business, if they had any. 35:11 Paul Ortiz I see. 35:47 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And this kind of thing, it was just a gathering. But these were mostly rural people and those people who were related or connected or associated with these rural people would also meet out there. They just had gobs of folks. 35:48 Paul Ortiz And it was on Thomas. And was it primarily Black people? 36:00 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, they were almost all. Now the Whites may have met, they may have, but I wasn't familiar with a gathering like that. Now, there was a place we called Tobacco Town, which wasn't too far from that area. It was right there across on that side of the track. And it was one of these country stores over there that sold feed and grain, and I guess they bartered and sold between each other and seeds and things like that, plow points and sheds, things like that. 36:00 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So we would see people over there, but they weren't necessarily in the crowds that we were. And you could almost see each other. But as I said, there would be Blacks over there too. See, there'd be some over there shopping, getting some of the things they've gone after. But it was not a crowd, I mean, a gathering where they just got together and stood there forever. They just talked. But these folks stayed up till about dusk and then they'd go back home. 36:45 Paul Ortiz So it sounds like even though were in town, there were still ties between Black people in the countrysideâ€” 37:23 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Oh yes. 37:23 Paul Ortiz â€”and Rocky Mount. 37:23 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Oh yeah. Yes. And the thing there too, we didn't have a lot of class structure in Rocky Mount. I guess everybody was connected, I guess, through their churches, more so than they were by whether you were a teacher or a doctor or somebody else with a different society. They had a little thing going for themselves, but that was more or less through their fraternities and sororities and they would hold an annual dance or something of this sort. But people came there from everywhere to that. Also when I was a kid, they had what they called the June German and I was down there the other day last Saturday, and I said something about a June German and people laughed. 37:35 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But back there then, then they would take a warehouse, one of those big tobacco warehouses, which was probably a third of a block and decorated and have a big dance. Now the Whites would have their dance on Friday night and they would get their bands to come and play for them on Friday night. Then they would rent the building to Blacks for Saturday night. And so we didn't have to decorate. 38:22 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We just got our bands and moved in. So that was where we had all of the leading Black bands in the country to come. And they looked forward to coming to the June German. And I'm talking about people like Erskine Hawkins and Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington, Fats Waller and all those guys. Cab Calloway who died yesterday, he and his band, his brotherâ€”He had a brother, what was his name? Elmer Calloway, he had a band. A sister named Blanche Calloway, she had a band. And we had Chick Webb and I can just name those bands back that then, they would come every year. 38:50 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Sometimes they would have two bands. They would have something like an early evening thing, starting with a matinee type thing and one band and sometimes they were just local bands. People from Durham [indistinct 00:39:45] they had a small band and they would start it up. And then about 8:30 or 9:00, the big band would start and play all night. And the police would go back in their office and put their feet up on the desk and they didn't care what happened. I guess you had nothing but drunks, people getting drunk on the streets. Back then that was even illegal, but they didn't bother, White nor Blacks [indistinct 00:40:10]. Unless you got in a mighty bad something, they didn't bother. 39:30 Paul Ortiz Were there parts of town or certain events that your parents would tell you stay away from there or don't go to that part of town? 40:14 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Not in Rocky Mount. Not in Rocky Mount. I don't remember anywhere in Rocky Mount that we couldn't go walking. And there were no buses, anything like that. So we did walk. We walked everywhere we went. I'd walk over to my grandmother's on the other side of town. I guess I'd walk an hour, I guess, from my house over there, 45 minutes, an hour to get to her house. She always had something good for us, you know how older people were. 40:25 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I remember one time I went over there and she asked me if I wanted some cymling pie and it had pie hanging onto it, of course, I said, \"Yeah.\" So she served it and I ate it and it tasted good. I said, \"Grandmom,\" I said, \"What is this?\" She said, \"Cymling pie.\" I said, \"What is cymling?\" She said, \"Well, some people call them squash.\" But that's first time I had squash pie. But I looked at word up. I was telling somebody that not long ago, and they said they'd heard that word, but I wasn't able to find that word anywhere. 40:52 Paul Ortiz What church did your family belong to when you were growing up? 41:29 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, the Bryants mainly belonged to what was called Mount Zion First Baptist Church. And it's still there in Rocky Mount. But somewhere down the line, the church split, I guess it must have been in the '70s or '80s. 41:35 Paul Ortiz 1970s? 41:48 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, they split and they got now another one called the Metropolitan Baptist Church, and few members of our family went with that. That's still some of the members in the other church too. Both of them have built new churches. 41:48 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, what were race relations like when you were growing up? 42:06 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, they were strong in Rocky Mount. When I say strong, we were highly divided. We had a police department there that did, I guess about anything you heard of anywhere else where they would arrest Blacks in the street, beat them up do anything they wanted. There was no recourse to it. There were no White places that Blacks could eat. I don't know anywhere. There was a Greek that ran a restaurant in that block, but he was catering to Blacks. But we could go to department stores, grocery stores and furniture stores, things like that. But we were limited. 42:17 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I can remember seeing the Ku Klux parade a couple times while I was a kid in Rocky Mount. And there was a lynching. I understand, when I was a kid, they told me it was about 20 miles out of Rocky Mount. I don't remember the name now, but it was somewhere in that area. Wasn't part of Rocky Mount. What happened and what the reason for that, I was just a kid. But I remember a lot talking about it. We were employed when we got beyond the employment at the railroad, we were employed as domestics and as elevator operators and janitors in stores. [indistinct 00:44:09] in place, even in restaurants, we were justâ€”Not restaurants, even in theaters, we were just kind of a bellman or something, just [indistinct 00:44:24] in the theaters, cleaning and whatnot. 43:13\n\nPaul Ortiz So, Mr. Bryant, there was a kind of ceilingâ€” 0:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yes. 0:04 Paul Ortiz â€”you were saying, whereâ€” 0:04 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Now, there were one or two jobs there. They were unusual. There was a guy, in my childhood days, name of Martin, I can't think of his first name. But he was an electrician. And apparently, one of the top electricians in Rocky Mount. I guess you'd call him a lineman, because I can remember when they would call himâ€”He didn't live too far from where we lived. They would call him all times at night, and on weekends, to do special jobs. I mean, let's go outâ€”I remember once I was standing in the post office, and a storm came. And while we were standing there, the lightning, the pole out in front of the post office. And the lights went out, all around. And I would imagine, while during that rainâ€”Time the rain was over, this guy Martin had been summonsed to come down. He went up that pole and got these lights back on. Now, that was back, had to have been, back in the twenties. Now, that was one person. That was unusual employment. 0:04 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It seems that there were one or two others. There were some fellows working for the city that had jobs, like operating grade machines, that ordinarily, the Blacks didn't get that kind of work. And they rode on these horse pool, dump truck, I mean, what you call them, garbage wagons, but none of them grading machines, and things like that. A Mr. Hewlett, I can remember, had a job like that. And he, back there then, they were renting. There were not very many paved streets, so they had to have somebody just create all the streets, all get their bumps and hills out of them after rains and things like that. 1:15 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And he had a nice job and there were maybe others. But right off, those two came to my mind. But those people that worked at the railroad shop may have been the laborers, but they got good work. Now, they were firemen. And I think all of the firemen that I saw back in those years were Black. So you had an engineer and a fireman on each engine. The firemen was Black. And sometimes they would even have two firemen on a train, particularly on a freight train where they had the steam pressure. And so that somebody could be shoveling coal and picking at the fire, another person serving as a lookout on the right side, or on the left side of being firemen [indistinct 00:02:47]. The engineer was on the right side of the engine. So, they had to watch for traffic, cars coming across the road, animals on the track, and all that sort of thing. So, one person had to look from one side, and one look from this side. 1:58 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. See, they didn't have a open windshield, like these things have now. So they were employed, and did a lot of work. And then, at the shop, they repaired wrecked cars, and they did painting of passenger cars, or repairing of those. And there's gobs of different kinds of assignments that those people worked with. And then, they had a shifting, we call it a shifting operation, where if a freight train came in with 150 cars on it, there may have been some cars that came from Boston or somewhere, coming to Durham. So when they got to Rocky Mount, this freight would pull off on the side track, and they'd break it up into sections. And then there would be an engine that would take the cars coming from Durham, and then run them down the side track and make up another train. And then, before this train left, they would put train cars on that they would have in Rocky Mount, and going further south, or going further north. So, it was really a big operation then. It was a big operation. 2:58 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, when did you first become aware of segregation in life? 4:08 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, the first instanceâ€”Well, I had a number of instances, but I can remember going into a grocery store once. And the man's name was on the back of the cash register. And I'm standingâ€”These grocery stores then were the kind where you had a counter, down your left in the store, and all the food and canned stuff were put on shelves. You had a meat market on this end, or something of this sort. And you would go up and ask for what you wanted, and they would go get it, and bring it to you, and fill your order. Then they would cash, you'd have a check, charge youâ€”So, I'm standing there waiting, and I just read the man's name on the back of his cash register. And I don't remember the name. It said \"J.M. Brown\", something like this, you know. So, I just said, \"J.M. Brown\". He said, \"What did you say?\" I said, \"I said, 'J.M. Brown.'\" \"Put a mister in front of my name!\" And this is the kind of thing that went on. 4:12 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And that's the way they did. And back there then, the older people were required to tip their hats when they saw white women. And many instances, we had to get off the sidewalk. If they were walking two abreast or three abreast, we got off, had to get off the sidewalk. They made no effort to let us by. Now, I can remember that. I can remember my father being beaten by some white men once. We were riding. He had a Model T Ford, one of these two-seaters with a cloth top or canvas top on it. So, we were riding out in the rural area of Edgecombe County, northeast of Rocky Mount, as I can recall. And I would imagine that I was five years old. My sister was seven. And my brother was young because he was the baby in my mother's lap. 5:15 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And we were driving, and we passed a car sitting on the side of the road. And these fellas were drinking. In some stretch of rural land. So we passed, and went on down the road, and I guess we'd gone about a mile. And this car caught up with us, and cut right across in front of us and stopped us. And they pulled my daddy out and beat him, but reason, I don't know. And he got big gash on his eye, whatnot, kind of that thing. And we were too small to do anything to help. And our mother was holding the baby and hollering going on. But that was the worst of the things that I can remember, when I was a kid. Don't have any idea who they were, where they came from and any sortâ€” 6:16 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But other than that, we were required to go to Black schools. We were requiredâ€”The churches were separate, and so many of them are now. A lot of them are. Andâ€”Oh, I guess the usual things that we were having in existence in the sixties were still in effect back there then. We had no Black library. And so, the only books that we had were the few that we had in the high school. And, in fact, my father bought books. I was telling my son today that our home place is still in Rocky Mount, it's still intact, just like it was. My mother died in 1976. And sheâ€”My father bought books. We have, in that house now, a whole wall of bookcases, the kind that you pull out the glass front door, one of these antique things. Everything in the house is antique. It's a wonder somebody hadn't cleaned it out. Nobody lives there. But he got \"Encyclopedia Britannica\", I guess, 1917 edition of it, the whole set. 6:58 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. He has the Harvard Classics, he has the Literary Digest sets of booksâ€”And it seems to me there's another set there, in those things. There are three of those bookshelves. And, in fact, we didn't have to go to the library school to do our homework. We had books at our house to do that. Then my mother had these music books. And I have stacks of music magazines and music books from the twenties. There used to be an organization in Philadelphia named Theodore Presser, who published a monthly magazine of song and music. Just music. And it was for musicians. And I was looking through some things I had brought from Rocky Mount, about, oh, a year ago, and ran across about 10 of those Theodore Presser magazines dated in 1926, 27, 28. And I just thumbed through them, you know, and I saw one or two songs that I thought that our organist at church might have been interested in, and so I just photocopied them, and she was pleased to get them. 8:17 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But we had stacks of those for years down there. And then, we haveâ€”Well, the whole place is furnished. We got a Coldspot refrigerator down, it's running right now! And that thing has to have been bought in the forties. And piano, and the television, radioâ€”And the few to pass that house, you would think somebody was living there. The lights come on at night, they go off. Nobody's staying there. Telephone's even hooked up in my mother's name. She's been dead, what? Almost 14, 18 years, I guess. 9:33 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, how would the Black community, or people in the Black community, respond to racial injustice in the twenties? 10:14 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, we had the NAACP. My father was the local secretary of that group, and I have some of his letters that he wrote to people back then in. And they would call in people like W.E.B. DuBois, and Walter White, and William Pickens, and others, to come at crisis situations, and do pretty much like Jesse Jackson does now. He comes into the community trying to bring the people back together, and try to help them get some solutions. However, those people would sometimes run away. I mean, they were just ordered out of town, and all od this sort of thing, if something came up thatâ€” 10:27 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And you had policemen who were part of the Klan, or any other organization that wanted to make sure that Blacks stayed on this side of the railroad, and this kind of a thing. That was in existence; that was quite prevalent. And I can remember a policeman by the name of Zimmerman or Zinaman, whatever it was, and he would come to Blacks, to the residence, he didn't need warrants of any kind. He'd come and kick doors and do just what he wanted to do. And there was no recourse against his actions. But I remember that. 11:16 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And then there was a guy that was on a motorcycle. And I'm not sure how much harassment Blacks got back there then from that, but I do know he arrested a whole lot of folk for a whole lot of different things. I don't know what it could have been. It could have been speeding or whatnot. It might have been with whiskey in the cars, whatever, I don't know, back there then. But he did a lot of arresting people and getting them into court. Now, we had Black lawyers, but their chances of winning cases, with some of those lawyers in Rocky Mount were slim. So, they were used basically for real estate, and things like that. But as a criminal lawyer to come in to help you, we couldn't get a lot of help from the Black lawyers because they didn't even recognize them hardly in the court system. 11:58 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, when was the NAACP chapter organized in Rocky Mount? 12:57 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I don't know. But maybe if I look back at some of that stationery, I might be able to come up with a date written on it, or something that's all organized and something. Butâ€” 13:07 Paul Ortiz So, your father was hiring members? 13:16 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I'm not sure. And see, when the national organization was organized, what, in 1910, I believe, 19-eight or 1910, and I don't know how long it took it to filter down to Rocky Mount before he got going, but I would imagine it was in the twenties. 13:27 Paul Ortiz And you mentioned earlier that there were crisis situations that the local chapter would try to address, and that they would call inâ€”Like, back in the forties. What were some of those crisis situations? 13:48 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, it could have been a murder, or could have been the beating of a citizen, Black citizen. Could have beenâ€”And we had a lot of situations where Blacks lost property. We had a lot of situations. I can remember when the lawyers, the white lawyers, would set up some kind of deal, like, if you going to buy a house from him, or through him, he'd have their things rigged up so that you really didn't have a deed of trust. And you could be paying on that house, or a lot on that farm for years, and in order once they put you off of it. And even those who had deeds of trust, they would get behind, say, two payments and they would put off. This kind of stuff. So, we had a lot of that going on. And even though there were Blacks who were able to go all the way through and get the final maintenance of the ownership of the property, we had a lot of them that lost property like that. 14:06 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And when I look back, even when I came to Durham in the forties, there were still some deals where Blacks would be paying, and they'd be given a receipt. And, when they woke up, they really didn't own the land, or the house, and this kind of thing. And that led to the Organization of Black Institutions, Financial Institutions. And Durham led us in this area. But they were limited to people on loans, limited to people in Durham County, for the most part. But now it's, they going to go all over the state. But back there then, they were limited. And that charter didn't go but so far. But, even there itâ€”Mutual Savings, Mutual Community Savings Bank, was organized as the Mutual Savings and Loan Association here in Durham about 1920, '21, somewhere back then. And that started this big incidence, high incidence of homeownership among Blacks. But there in Rocky Mount, you had to rely on what you could get from either real estate companyâ€” 15:26 Paul Ortiz Right. 16:53 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah. Yeah. There were no Black real estate companies. Or through a bank. In some instances, there were people who worked for some of these White people, who helped them get things. So, they did have some of that. But if you didn't know anybody, then you just had a problem trying to get what youâ€”So you were just renting in this town. 16:56 Paul Ortiz So, Mr. Bryant, you came to Durham in the early 1940s, is that correct? 17:21 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, I came to Durham in '41, to stay here permanently. 17:28 Paul Ortiz And, how was it that you came to Durham? You knowâ€”Well, you obviously had some family here. 17:29 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yes. Now, my mother's mother stillâ€”The property was still in the family. But my mother had two sisters that were working in North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. One was the secretary to the medical director, and the other one was the secretary of the director of personnel, and the person in charge of some of the field officers. And when I finished collegeâ€”and I majored in accountingâ€”I stayed at the school and worked, oh, I guess from May to January, I guess, when I came right here, either January or February in '41, February I believe it was. So, I stayed up at Hampton and worked there, but I was placing applications everywhere. But I had sent one down here to North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. And I had applied for postal work in the northern states. There were no Black poster people at that time in this area at all. 17:42 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Now I can remember, when I was a little fella, that I was a Black postman here, but I imagine he was the only one and he just served the Hayti area. But when he was left, then from that point on untilâ€”Or I guess way up in the fifties or sixties before they got in more Black on postal service in that area. Now, I was going, I had applied for a job in Newsom Park, which was a housing development, a Black housing development in Newport. But I didn't get it, so I was still working. While I was working there, my aunt called and told me that there was an opening here in Durham if I was interested in coming to Durham. And she told me to make application to that. And that was the Mutual Saving Loan Association, which is now the Mutual Community Bank around the car. 18:56 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And so I, made application to there, and I was employed. So I came to Durham to work for that organization. And I stayed with my aunt, my mother's sister. And incidentally, one of them had a birthdayâ€”The other one died in '81. But the one that's living had a birthday on the 31st of last month, two, three weeks ago. And she's 98 years old. And so, she's doing pretty good. She's in bed now, most of the time. But she's doing pretty good. 19:58 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But I stayed and we traveled back and forth to work together. We all worked in the same building, you know, so we're living in the same neighborhood. So, it was fine for me to come to Durham. And then I got settled. Then I left theâ€”In 1944, I left the Mutual Community Savings Bank and went to North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. And I stayed there until 1981, at which time I retired. And then, the person that was the Grand Secretary for this organization died. And this group asked meâ€”I was working with this group all the time, as a volunteer member of a committee, the auditing committee. And they asked me if I'd take it over. And I took it over. They said, part-time work. Well, only thing I follow part-time is the pitch. 20:35 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But anyway, I've been with it and I've enjoyed, I think I've made some contributions. But I kept it together all the time, [indistinct 00:21:50]. So it looks like it's moving along nicely. 21:40 Paul Ortiz What role did the Mutual Savings and Loan Association play in the Black community in Durham? 21:56 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It had two big roles. One was savings. It had a savings program that taught children as well as adults, the importance of saving some money out of your check. And it was broken down, so that even kids could put a little money in. And they had accounts that you would put in 25 cents a week. And so, it was kind of a thing that tobacco-working people and all these other people were able to save money over a period of few years, enough money to buy home. And of course, they had these home loans, and even people borrowing to repair. Back there then, even when I came, you know, could get a roof on a house for, I don't know, $300, this kind of thing. 22:12 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. In fact, the home that I was living in with my aunt cost, in 1935, that house cost $3,500. And it had a big living room, a big front cement porch across the front of the house. She had a large dining room, a kitchen with a kitchenette in it, pantry. And, on the second floor, she hadâ€”And she had a half bath on the first floor. And upstairs she had three bedrooms and a bath, and had a basement. For $3500. Now, it'd cost you that much to just to buy a condo! You can't get much of anything for $3500 now. 23:12 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And the other aunt, the one that's living now, built her one, the same design, but larger, you know? And I don't remember her figures, but it wasn't too much different. But that was built in the thirties, too. And while working with them, I can remember, I wasâ€”Mr. R.L. McDougald was the vice president. At that time, C.C. Spaulding was the president of most of these units that we had around. New President Bank, the Mutual, I mean North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Mutual Saving and Loan Association, and maybe two, three others. He was president of it. 23:51 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And R.L. McDougald was Vice President of all of them. And he was a guy that had an unusual ability. He died in his forties. But he had an unusual ability of dealing with real estate. And things that he touched, it turned the gold the way I would look. And because when he died, he hadâ€”And he died in the forties, he had almost a half million dollar estate, property, right here in Durham. It's four hundred and some thousand, I don't remember what it was now. 24:47 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But anyway, he was the person in charge of that office, I mean, of this place. And we hadâ€”And John S. Stewart, who is still living, was the person that ran it. He was the Mutual Savings and Loan, and he retired from it. And of course, Peter Allison and I, had the F.B. Allison is a CEO and all that sort of thing. But anyway, he, McDougald, helped Blacks buy lots. I can remember a white man, I don't know who he was right now, but I can find out owned a lot of land out here in the Mill Grove area, which is out here in the Bright Town section. 25:26 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And I don't how many acres it was, there were. But he wanted to buy it, because Blacks lived all around it. This man told him, said, \"No Black man is going to ever own that land.\" And so, Mac told him, \"Thank you.\" Now, McDougald looked like a white man. He was tall and light-skinned, and if you didn't know him, you know, just mix him up with the other races. But anyway, he told the guy, he said, \"Okay, fine.\" 26:21 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And there was a guy namedâ€”Hold off, I'm thinking about another guy. He's from Greensboro, and he developed a Black community down South Roxboro called Lincoln Heights. What was that guy's name? But anyway, he came, he dealt with the bank here, got his loans for Black students, back in Saving Loan. And see, McDougald was vice president of the bank and the Mutual Saving and Loan, you see. So, he steered these loans for him, helped them with them. And so, McDougald told him,\"There's a piece of property I want.\" And he told him, \"Well, what's wrong? Why can't you get it?\" He told him, \"The man said he wasn't going to sell to no Black.\" 26:53 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So he said, \"Well, if you want, I'll get it for you.\" And sure enough, he went and got the piece of property, and transferred it over to McDougald. Friends, this kind. So Mac went back to the man, and said he wasn't no Black, and says, \"I got it.\" But, now what he did with that land, he cut it up into lots, sold these lots at $200 a piece, and got that area started with homeowners in that area. And I think, after he sold the first 10 lots, he got all of the money back that he put into that whole thing. And I would imagine, there must have been at least a hundred lots cut out that space, out of that place. 27:36 Paul Ortiz In that section, yeah. And it was calledâ€” 28:25 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Mill Grove. 28:25 Paul Ortiz Mill Grove. 28:36 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yes, it was placed in the Mill Grove area. And they had a school and everything out there already, a few homes. But it was rural. They went all the way out and brought people in, they had to [indistinct 00:28:43]. But then it developed right around that school, and then later, built a new school a little further out, and used that school. It's used for something now. It's still there. But McDougald was one of these guys that helped her out. And there were sections down in the Hayti area, take Dunstan Street. There were maybe 25 homes built on Dunstan Street right off of Fayetteville Street, through those kind of development projects for Black homeownership. And there was Dunbar Street. It developed the same way. And then you get down into the area of Mimosa, Pekoe, Otis and Masondale. Pekoe, P-E-K-O-E, and Masondale Streets were areas where were developed. 28:36 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So, the efforts of these financial institutions and those persons that hadâ€”In later years, Mr. Wheeler, John, Hervey, H-E-R-V-E-Y, Hervey Wheeler, became president of the bank. And he continued the same program. And, as I said, John Stewart became president of the Beach Saving Loan Association, or later, F.B. Allison Jr. And they inherited the same thing. And it's still an active and viable part of the community now, that Blacks can get this financing. 29:43 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But, prior to that time, there were chosen Blacks that could get financing for homes through the White institutions around here. And you had to know somebody who knew somebody or something of the sort. But we had a lot of Blacks working in the factories here. They made good money. And I can remember, this company here called Uzzle's Motor Company, refused to sell a Cadillac to person here named Walter McKinney. And because he worked at a factory, he said, \"Now, if Mr. Spaulding wanted one, or Mr. McDougald, or Dr. Shepherd down at Central, somebody else wanted a Cadillac, they could get it. But a tobaccoâ€”No. So, McKinney went to Detroit, and got him a Cadillac. Go on up to the factory and got it work! But I can remember that, too. That was in the forties. 30:22 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And there was another company here called Johnson Motor Company. And it finally woke up to the fact that Blacks working at the factories could pay for Buicks. And so, then they started courting them, you know? And they had the, what they call now, the Roadmaster, back there then, they were selling those Roadmasters right and left to Black folks. They called them \"225s\". I don't know whether that was horsepower or something. But it was on the side of the car, \"Roadmaster 225\". But then as I said, they woke up and started selling the big cars and whatnot to Blacks. These factory people, and you see them walking down the street with their little blue aprons on, and blue little hats, and all that sort of business? They find out those folks had spending money. And there was one good company had tan uniforms, one that had blue. But you could tell them in the streets because they had to uniforms of work, okay. After that, bought. And so, that began to develop a relationship with stores downtown. 31:26 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But there was still stores downtown, in the forties, one or two, that would not allow Blacks to try on dresses. And if a Black went in a store, they were the last ones to be served. They just had to stand around for a while. And there were hat shops that required Black women to put something on their head before it would allow them to try on a hat. Now, you'd have to ask someone of them to tell you whatever that was. I don't know whether it was a paper cover or something, put on the head. Well, something they had to put on the head before they could put a hat on. And there were some stores that did not have rooms for Black women to try on dresses and things like that. But we avoided those. 32:39 Paul Ortiz So, Mr. Bryant, it sounds like Mr. McDougald had a realâ€”Would it be safe to say that he had a vision of the Mutual playing the role of helping to build Black [indistinct 00:33:57]? 33:41 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, just don't say McDougald alone, because there were others, but Macâ€”And incidentally, there's a housing project over here at East Durham, McDougald Terrace, that's named after him. And there's a gymnasium. Right, yeah, a gym, what is it? Yeah, a gymnasium, down at North Carolina Central, named after him, McDougald Gymnasium. But it didn't just start with Mac. This started back in 18-something. Say, for instance, North Carolina Mutual was started in 1898. 33:57 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And, even at that time, there were Blacks who were looking at situations that could be developed through efforts in their community, in their community. And they knew what was happening. But you had guys like John Merrick, Aaron McDuffie Mooreâ€”Now, John Merrick was a barber. Aaron McDuffie Moore was a medical doctor. There was W.G. Pearson, who was an educator. And incidentally, he died, I believe, in the forties. I think I have a funeral program. I went to his funeral. But he was a grown man in 1888! (laughs) So he was an old man when he died. 34:34 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But anyway, that's the kind of thing thatâ€”The reason I said that is because I was looking through some of our history books here, in this office, and saw where he was a member and officer of this Grand Large in 1888. But he was an educator, and laterâ€”And he served, really, as the Black superintendent of schools. In other words, if a Black teacher came from any other, anywhere, and wanted a job here, as I understand it, the school board would ask his opinion about that person before they would hire him, and this kind of a thing. And he would make requests for school teachers and whatnot. He had one thing that everybody laughs about. He apparently went to Wilberforce University in Ohio, in Xenia, Ohio. But every year, he would go up there, and pick the senior that he wanted to come to Durham as a teacher, later, get them to come to Durham. In other words, that was his pipeline for teachers. 35:19 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Now, if others came, oh, it was all right, but he made sure that some out of the Wilberforce came here every year. And then, later, he built a place across the street from him, and they called that place the Rosa Lee, I believe it was. But it was a huge building, but it was an apartment for female teachers. And these teachers stayed in there. There were a couple places like that in Durham. They had been provided for these single teachers, who I guess wanted to stay together, or found to be better that they stayed together, and for their work-related housing. 36:33 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Now, and that was a guy way back whose name was Fitzgerald, and I believe his name was George Fitzgerald. He owned a brickyard, and he made brick. And a lot of these buildings down at Five Point area were built around here, you know where the Five Point area, here in Durham, used to be a crossroad of Five Point. Now it's a little thing down there, where you got a little pool of water and stuff, [indistinct 00:37:44] Square, where Main Street crosses Chapel Hill Street down there. Yeah, many of those buildings that were there, those older buildings were made with bricks out Fitzgerald's brickyard. 37:18 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And now let me see, all these guys got together. There was a guy named Dawkins, who was a schoolteacher, andâ€”Who else was in that groupâ€”Have to go get the history thing on that. But anyway, there were a number of them. So, they got together and started North Carolina Mutual, John Merrick and Aaron, Dr. Moore, were the ones that put it together, and got it going. Then they got them a bank, and some same guys, and maybe one or two others that added to it. And the Mutual Savings Loan Association. Then they started a fire insurance company, a bankers' fire insurance company. And some of these same folk, and J.C. Scarborough was in on it, the man who ran Scarborough's Funeral Home. 37:57 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Then they started what they called the Southern Fidelity Mutual Insurance Company. That was a hospitalization company. All these big corporations were started here, but it was small. Then they developed a library for Blacks, boys' club, and any number of other kind of shops and businesses among Blacks here. So, their success, I guess, came from the momentum of an early start, and from the ills of Segregation, and from just need. They just had to. And see, when the redevelopment came through here, and messed upâ€”Well, I don't say messed up; that's what they did, though. 39:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It came in and removed, relocated and removed. There were 106 businesses on those two, three streets, Black businesses on those streets that were affected. And we had everything from five and 10, the printer store, print shop, barber shop, grocery stores, undertaker shops. We had dry-cleaning shops, hotels, theater. One theater was left. But my lifetime in this area, there'd been three theaters. You had doctors and mechanics and filling stations and beauty shops; shoe repair school and all this kind of, all these things were involved. 39:58 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But this East West expressway came right through the middle of it. And all of us still feel it was by design. They didn't tear all the white businesses by going across that way. They did a few, but not many. And they went straight through the middle of this, right aboutâ€”We knew the people up in the age, and they just gave up, said, \"I'm not going to try to relocate, or start over again.\" And so, they just accepted what they got out of it, and retired or whatnot. And there were others that moved all over various places in Durham. 40:49 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And Speed Service Center, for instance, this filling station and service center on Pettigrew Street where Fayetteville Street crosses down there. And they had a station, and they did all kinds of repair, and they had auto tire retreading process, and all that stuff. Now, they are located maybe five miles out from that spot going out outside of town. There were florists and other things that they scattered all over town. And finally, since '65, when most of it happened. A lot of those people have passed on, and the businesses have closed. But that was lousy. 41:30 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But now coming back to your question about this homeownership. All of this, and these groups, put this thing together, and all of them worked together in doing it. And many of the ministers made tremendous contributions, through their congregations, to foster this. And another thing that helped us a whole lot was, that these guys got together and put together a pretty good political machine. And the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People. And they have had a number of successes in getting out to vote to get Blacks elected and get those who were friends to Blacks elected. Never been able to get rid of Jesse Helms, though. 42:14 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Whenever I go out of state, anywhere I go out of state, folks say, \"Why don't y'all do something with Jesse Helms?\" Because people, he affects people all the time. People are upset by what's going on, and that. Well, that's one we'll do, someday, we'll get it straight. I was a secretary of the Durham Business and Professional Chain. That was a kind of a Black Chamber of Commerce here, from 1943 to 1992. And we worked in that effort to try to unify and keep Black businesses together. And we had everything from training sessions, to participation in parades, and putting packages together, financial packages together. Almost all the stuff and things was done in that organization. 43:13 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I worked with the Boy Scouts from the same year, 1943 to 1988, as Scoutmaster. No, I was in Scouting from that time. I was scoutmaster from 1951 to 19â€” 44:12\n\nPaul Ortiz Okay. And you were speaking about trying to get an anchor tenant. 0:01 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. That's correct. We were never able to get one. Now, we had Winn-Dixie one time looking at it, and we thought they were going to be in there. We had Goodyear, excuse me, Service Center, and we thought that we were going to have them in there. And then there was another supermarket, I'm not sure as to which one it was. I don't think it was A&P, but there was another one that had shown some interest and concern, but we were never able to get those to participate. Now, we made a bid for the land, and as I can remember, it was 50 cents an acre, 50 cents a square foot, and it was 11 acres or more land there. 0:04 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And seems like to me, the price on that land was, I don't know, I'd be guessing at it. I could find the figures up. Seemed like to me it was $135,000 or something like that for the land, which was reasonable. But without those anchor tenants, we just could not get the financing off the crown. And so we had to give it up. But we had architects that came here from all over. In fact, Harvey Gantt, the guy that ran for mayor, ran against Jesse Helms. He came here as an architect and looked at our product and thought it was a good idea. 1:07 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We had a guy to come out of Ohio who had built a number of prisons across the country, and he had some contractors who owed him favors, and he was willing to use that part of his contacts in helping us develop this. But as I say, we were never able to get it off the ground. I know we had at least two complete models made of theâ€”And I don't know any number of drawings, blueprints, and drawings of the site, but we were never able toâ€”I just wonder where those models are now. You got people who throw everything and then there are people that try to keep some things. But even though we got a Durham Business Professional chain office right now, I don't think anybody knows where those models are. 1:53 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. They were tabletop models, about size of this desk. I think one was about half the size of this desktop, but it showed the sites, you know how they make them up, little models the entire project? But it was interesting though, in trying to develop that. There were two churches inside the shopping center. One is still down in that area, which is the St. Joseph's Historical Center. That's there. The other one was White Rock in its original site, which would've been about in the area of one of the ramps there on the expressway on the east side of Fayetteville Street. I think the ramp went right through one of the rooms in the church. 2:52 Paul Ortiz The church had to move. 3:42 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It had to move, but they were trying to figure out some way to keep the two there. So the church finally concluded it had to go. St. Josephs attempted to stay there. And then in later, years of development of it, they left too. But there were two other businesses that were there that made it a terrible combination, and they're still. There's the church, the whiskey store and the bank. They're still there. But after we failed, I was going to use the word failâ€”after we were not able to get it off the ground, then the redevelopment commission cut the property up into lots, and the various persons took lots as a medical center that were put on the Fayetteville street side. And on the other side of it, they put in a Fox Hill or fox something, housing development. Then the bank bought in some additional land for parking and they drive in and all that sort of thing. 3:46 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So the idea just filled. Then the Phoenix Square moved in between the whiskey store and the bank. I mean, whiskey store and the church and developed that area, but it was a nice site. We had all of the ingredients of a successful shopping center. In fact, in later years, a guy came here. Well, he was born and raised here, but he went and finished Duke, and he left North Carolina and stayed for a number of years. And he came back and he had been in a city where a Black shopping center was developed, but it was developed with the assistance of the city. 4:54 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. See, we weren't able to get any support from the city. He said, \"Well, we're going to sell you the land at a reasonable price, and you have to do the rest of it yourself.\" Even though they got federal money here. But they used the federal money to develop downtown. And at one time they were going to put canopies over the sidewalks of the businesses downtown, and I think they put up one or two of them and gotâ€”But anyway, the money was really spent in these flower boxes and all this stuff you see down decoration, this mall's thing in here, where these brick stuff is in here and this kind of a thing. Andâ€” 5:37 Paul Ortiz Those are primarily White owned businesses? 6:16 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, they were. And so as a result, we didn't get any support from the city on that to amount anything. But this guy that came in was Nat White Jr. This fellow that you going to interview, it was his son. He came in here and as a result of his efforts with a different make up of the city council, a different make up of it, the county commission, he was able to get some support. And so the property on the west side of Fayetteville Street was made available. And he set upâ€”Oh God, he tied Development Corporation. 6:18 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And that corporation took the leadership in developing the Heritage Square Shopping Center. And of course at that time, then Winn-Dixie came in and participated, and then they had a true Value hardware store and one or two others down there, Pick-N-Pay and Family Dollar and Revco and one or two others, went in there. The Pick-N-Pay recently left, but something else has moved in in its place. The Ace Hardware left, and now the city has put some training program or something they have in that areas, but the rest of it is still together. 7:07 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, during the sixties when you were organizing the Chain corporations, this is part of this effort to relocate Black owned businesses. You mentioned that the city council was definitely not an ally in those. Did you also have a sense that there were other sources of opposition to your plans to relocate the businesses? 8:05 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I'm not aware right at this point. I probably knew them at one time, but I'm not, right at this moment, aware of those that were. Apparently there were some quiet opposition to development of that. I think from the very beginning of the planning, because of the fact that it was decided to go straight through this shopping area, it could have gone without other ways, but it just wiped out this entire Black operation. Which somebody would sayâ€”oh, geez. [INTERRUPTION 00:09:26] 8:42 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And I'm talking about the White community. With some of the organizations that I'm still associated with to say to me, \"Aren't you all still mad about what happened to the Black businesses?\" And if said this, \"And if I were you, I'd be mad as hell right now because of what happened.\" And we don't know as we look back, as to what would've happened to all of those Black businesses if they were just left there. The chances are that some of them would've had other family members that would've carried them on, or there would've been some sort of a development that might have got a few of them together and may have done something different from what was done, from what they were doing. And then there may have been some franchises that might have helped by moving into the community and whatnot. 9:26 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But down in that area, out of those 106 stores, we had a five and 10 cents store. We had a furniture store, we had jewelers, jewelry, watchmakers. We had a print shop. We had attorneys offices, doctor's offices. We had a meat market that sold basically meats. We had restaurants, beauty shops. They were undertaker shops there. We had one place that we had several, we call filling stations, but we had one place that did automobile tyre work, including recapping and all this sort of thing. 10:36 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We had, I don't know how many grocery stores that were involved. We had a photographer place, we had an appliance store, we had Chinese restaurant. We had a small token type bowling alley. It wasn't a full-fledged bowling alley, but it was something that we could for entertainment. We had a real estate office. I just named one right after the other, all these businesses that were there. We had the Chicken Hut, which is a Chicken Hut now. It was a Chicken Box then, they were on Roxboro Street. It was then called Pine Street. Andâ€” 11:15 Paul Ortiz Oh, I ate there last summer. That's onâ€” 11:57 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Fayetteville. Downâ€”Yeah, it's a Chicken Hut now. But it was up here on this end up on Pine Street. So we had a hotel, we had two theaters. We just had all kinds of businesses along there. And there was some others than Blacks. There was a guy down there named Katz. I don't know what he was, but I guess maybe he was, might have been a Jew. And there was a fellow that looked like he might have been an Iranian or something. And then there was a Chinese restaurant. 12:00 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. There was another guy down there, gosh, I don't know his name. He was White. And then there was Mose Levy, I think he was Jewish. And was any other down there? I think all the rest of it was Black. We had a small library, florist and whatnot. The small library eventuallyâ€”This was before the expressway, but the building was still there. They developed into the Stanford L. Warren Library. And that library thing in the Black community came out of White Rock Baptist Church. 12:37 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. We had schools, we had the boys club in there. We had a place teaching welding. We had a shoe repair school. I think there were two down there eventually. And I mean, just gobs of things that were there. And the Black community had all of this to their advantage because they could just come down on this area and do all of their shopping and buying. And as I said, except for things like they could buy at Belk's, all that clothing, and some of those things like furnishings for houses and all that sort of thing, like draperies and things like that, you could get them right and get what you wanted down there. So it was a nice operation. And as I said, we had the hotel down there. In fact, there were two at one time. It was a Jones Hotel in the Biltmore Hotel. 13:23 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And so it led us to support ourselves, support each other. And it got so strong that in 1968, and this was after the expressway had gone through and did all it did. We had a selective buying campaign. I don't know whether I mentioned that or not. And that was because out of all that was happening and the frustrations that we had, Blacks were not being employed and absorbed in White businesses. So downtown Blacks were just janitors, messengers, elevate operators, things like that. And so they had this campaign to push for employment where you could work with dignity. And this started in the middle of the summer, first of the summer, I guess, in 1968. And it got momentum going. And so by Christmas time, I think the downtown stores then realized that Blacks were really not coming to buy anymore. 14:36 Paul Ortiz And this was Black Christmas? [crosstalk 00:16:03] 15:59 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And it was done by what we called the Black Solidarity Committee, which was also associated with these others and what they were doing. But we had a little different type leadership in that we had younger people involved. And it worked up to a point that we were able to, with the assistance of some persons that were sympathetic with our concerns, that were able to get all of that cleared up within maybe the last 10 days before Christmas. 16:04 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Because these merchants realized that this stuff that they had bought for Christmas wasn't going to move. And we were telling our people to wear your clothes with dignity, repairing, paint the toys and make the children continue to play with those or buy elsewhere. And so people were going to Greensboro, Burlington, Raleigh, and everywhere else to do what they needed, get what they needed, and Durham was going to suffer from that. And they realized it. And so they came across. 16:40 Paul Ortiz So even after the tragedy of the expressway, there was still a tremendous amount of solidarity within the Black community. 17:16 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Oh, yes. And the voting strength and this kind of a thing, I don't think ever changed. It's still in place. And so that helped us get from theâ€”I don't wantâ€” what was itâ€”The unfriendly political bodies here in Durham to people who were understanding of the community, entire community, and then with representation from the entire community. And that's how they got started down so many years. 17:28 Paul Ortiz Mr. Bryant, you mentioned the billboard. And a few days ago I was reading an interview that one of my colleagues had done with York Garrett, who I believe was the drugstore owner at the Biltmore Drugstore. And he mentioned in his interview that the Biltmore served the function as a place whereâ€”I mean, not only did you goâ€”I mean, not only was it a hotel, you could go prescription filled, and it sounded like it was also a place where you can go and have entertainment. And I think you mentioned there was a place that you could read newspapers, so? 18:17 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yeah, on the first floor of that place, we had the Biltmore Hotel, I mean the Biltmore drugstore, which was operated by Dr. Garrett. And incidentally, he'd be a hundred years old Saturday, celebrate his 100th birthday the 10th of December. We had the Biltmore restaurant there. And it was a restaurant with booths and whatnot in it. But you would go there and they had the regular menus. Then up on the second floor, they had a open meeting room. I don't have any idea how large it was now, but I guess it was at least as large as the first half of this floor. Pretty good size room. 19:12 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But it was made available to organizations, groups and families for meeting purposes. You could rent it and use it. And in some instances they would let you use it free depending upon who you were or the organization really. And so you had small banquets there. You had meetings there, you had social events there. You had bridge clubs and garden clubs and others using the building. And so that was what, but now above that floor was the living quarters. That was above the second floor. 20:05 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But it seems to me, as I can remember, there were one or two smaller rooms open for public use on that floor because I can remember us having board meetings of the Durham Business Professional Chain up there in a small room. But next door to it was the theater, which was a rigor theater. And next door that, was a building that was owned by us. This group. The Prince Hall Masons of North Carolina. It originally was built as what was called the Donut Shop, which was a restaurant. And it also had a meeting area, a large meeting area where you could have banquets and whatnot. 20:46 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And then on the second floor, it had office space that was rented to anybody that needed office space. But there were a couple of doctors in there and dentists and so forth on that second floor. And on the top floor, they had the Banneker Radio School, which was teaching veterans and young Blacks radio repair, and what else? They were teaching them all just electronic stuff. And they stayed there untilâ€”I guess they were there up until the seventies. 21:33 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Excuse me. Then we bought the building after the Donut Shop had closed, and then it was operated for a short period of time as a restaurant. And in one part of it became a doctor's office. And we used it as a Masonic building with meeting rooms on top floor. And the second floor was this office space. We kept it until Urban Renewal came along and we sold it to the redevelopment Commission. And I said in the seventies, but it wasn't in the seventies, seemed like to me that was in the fifties when we got it. I got the record here somewhere, when we bought it. 22:28 Paul Ortiz But it appeared to have been Black owned. 23:19 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. It was Black owned, yes. The Logan family, the man that ran the theater next to it, owned it. And he lived down right across from North Carolina Central. In fact, his children are still here. His two daughters and a son, both all right here at Durham. Now they live down in that area. And so the hotel did provide a center of activity from the Black community and people would go to the drug store and byâ€”Well, the things you get at that time a drug store, you all had this ice cream and soft drinks. I don't think there was any food that amounted to anything but nabs and things like that. 23:23 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But while you were waiting for your prescription, and they had a full line of medicine, while you were waiting for your prescription, you beat people there. And they had the cigar counter and the smoking tobaccos of all kinds. And Mr. Spaulding, C.C. Spaulding, who was the president of the principal corporations Black, was many times and most of the time, he would walk up here to work to this Mutual building where the bank is now. And he would come through that area and stop at the hotel, I mean the drug store, and to pick him up a newspaper and a couple cigars and just come on across the track on up town. And he was an unusual person. 24:18 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. He, as prominent as he was across the country as a leader of this, he was a down to earth person. And he had one article was written in Look Magazine, I think they called him Mr. Public Relations. But he would walk all the way through in Hayti. And there was one area in Hayti that was supposed to have been rough. Well, it wasn't that rough because all of my life, I don't ever remember being feared anything about going through there. But Mr. Spaulding didn't either. He'd walk right through it. And anybody out there, even the people that, same as the homeless now, for instance, or the alcoholics that would be out there, they would speak to him and he'd speak to them, just keep on going. They didn't have any problem. They'd all recognize that that was Mr. Spaulding. And he was a kind of a guy that if you ever saw him, you just think he was an unusual person in some respect. 25:13 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And it had been said over and over again that if you really passed him on the street and didn't know him, he would turn around and look and say, \"Wonder who that guy is.\" He was just that distinguished looking and he's quite a person. He was president of the mechanics and farmersâ€”I mean theâ€”Well, he was president of the bank. He was president of the North Carolina Mutual and President of the Mutual savings too, while I was there. So when I went from one company to the other, I was still working for the same president. So he was just president of a different group. 26:17 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And I was working there when he passed in 1952 and participated in the funeral arrangements. I was working with getting cars to participate in the service and all that sort of thing, and lining them up and this kind of thing. They used a lot of us in the office there to see that thing went out all right. And that's the only funeral that I've ever seen where they had to use a flat bed of a tractor trailer to carry the flowers. That's what they got. A batch of flat bed of a tractor, I got to pick it somewhere. And loaded that thing with flowers from one end to the other carry it down that cemetery. 26:55 Paul Ortiz So he was a much loved person? 27:44 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yes, he was. And he was known across the country. People from everywhere would come inâ€”Booker Washington and some of these old people came to Durham just to see him talk with him back then in the '17 and '15, the 1915, back then we had pictures of them. And in fact, I had a picture in my hand this morning, because I didn't bring up here, but it's a little paper weight with a mirror on one side and what looks like a plastic cover on the outside with a picture on it. And it's a picture of the group up at the office, those officers, the board members of that, and I don't know what they call it, but they didn't call it plastic then. They had a name for it, but it was just like plastic. But it's one that I just collected in the family that had all these years. But he was quite a person. 27:46 Paul Ortiz So you actually had a working relationship with CC's father? 28:39 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Yes. In fact, he would come through the building and laid out there, sitting out there. Now, in fact, the fellow that was here the other day when you were here, all of us worked under him. He would come through the building and walk from desk to desk. He would do this about a couple times a month. He just walked through the building and talked to each person, \"How you feel today?\" And \"How's your work coming along?\" And this kind of business. And whenever he came to me, he would always call my mother by her first name, say, \"How is Maggie?\" And I said, \"Mama's doing fine.\" \"Well, when has she been to Durham?\" Or he would say, \"I was down in Rocky Mountain, saw her.\" Or something of this sort. But he knew all of the families and okay and he was just that kind of a person. Pat on the back to keep up the good work. 28:44 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And he had that kind of a rapport with everybody from the top on down through the janitors. And that's why people liked him. And he was that same way at church, on the streets or wherever he went, and in whatever city and where we had offices all over the country. He knew almost all of the agents except the new ones. He knew them by name. And he could give a speech or a pep talk that could produce new business. Wherever he went, he'd go and say, \"Well, we do so and so and we got this kind of a product and new product.\" And talk about it, this kind of a policy that we have and just promote, that kind of a thing. And he had been with the company from the beginning, and he died in, let's say 1952. He died on his birthday too. 29:31 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I think it was August the second, someday like that. It was in August '52. And when he had the funeral, and it was at White Rock, which was at that time the largest Black church in Durham. That church, we had so many people they had block the street and put speakers outside and we got chairs, folding chairs from a whole lot of places. And so we just had people all out in the street. In fact, I never did get inside the church after the service started, they had prominent people from everywhere participating on the program. 30:31 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Mordecai Johnson came here. He was president of Howard University at that time. And in fact, I got a funeral program around here, somewhere on there. And all these people that participated in that service. But you could hear it all from outside and it was well attended, well attended. People came and said all over the state, traveled to Durham and all over the country to participate in that service, that funeral service. Reverend Miles Mark Fisher, who made White Rock famous and White Rock made him famous, was the pastor of the church at that time, Miles Mark Fisher. 31:13 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And it was a remarkable event. Now if you go back and look at some of those pictures I got, you see people's faces that you really didn't realize that were there, oh so and so's picture and this kind of a thing. But it was an outstanding thing. And I see I have the newspapers. I mean, in fact, he is the only person that I know of, as long as I've been in Durham, where in any time the people here in Durham has taken a picture and made a whole framed page picture out of this one person. He's the only one like that, and I was showing that to somebody not long ago. We just took the whole page and framed a picture of him. And this was before he died. 32:02 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And I was trying to remember the occasion, but there was something going on here and to use here, put his picture on the page like that. And there were a number of times that I just made pictures of him. I'd go up to his office and tell if I wanted him to pose for a picture and he didn't mind, he'd pull instead, \"Weren't you at your desk?\" Go ahead and make a picture. And I can remember when color pictures first came out and you could get film. I went to get a picture of him and got him sitting at his desk. 32:53 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And he came from a large group of Spaulding. In fact, now a book has been printed on the Spaulding family. And they all came from, I say all of them, most of them came from Columbus County that was the area where they grew up. The older people was down around Whitesville and what's the other little town down there? Which anyways, Columbus County. And they going all over the world, these Spauldings. And many of them done a very well job, a good job. We've had the attorneys and ministers, politicians and all sorts of persons come out the Spauldings family. And Columbus County, and let see what's the other place down there? See it right quick. I don't even see it on here. Well, go ahead with your next question. 33:23 Paul Ortiz Oh, okay. Oh, Mr. Bryant I was wondering, the question just came to mind. The physical location of the Mutual, it's obviously wasn't in the Hayti district or originally wasn't a group? 35:05 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. No, it was never. It had a district office in that area, but it was never down there. Back in the late, well, in the early nineties or the somewhere back there, Blacks began owned property up here. So they owned the building right around the corner. And that was where the North Carolina Mutual was organized. Well, I won't say organized. They eventually moved into that. I don't think they owned that at the beginning. But the person was that founded the organization, had office space downtown. 35:28 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. For instance, John Merrick ran a barber shop that was somewhere on Chapel Hill Street. And back there then, there was a Brickyard in Durham run by the Fitzgeralds. And they owned land over on Chapel Hill Street. So eventually North Carolina Mutual acquired the land on Parish Street and built a building. And that six story building around there was built about 1920, 1921. But the building next to it was there years back. And that was where they operated until this 1920 building was organized, built I mean. Then the Mutual Saving and Loan Association was organized in 1921. 36:20 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And it developed an office space in the mechanics and Farmers Bank. They had something like a teller's window in there. And when I came here in 1941, they were still operating in that office in the bank. And then they had aâ€”See that time banks closed about one o'clock every day. So after one o'clock, I would go to lunch and then go down to [indistinct 00:37:47] to the Dunbar Realty company where they hadâ€”We had a safe and our files had records down there and a posting machine. 37:21 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. So then I would take the little [indistinct 00:38:05] and slip some things and go down there and then post all the records up to date each day down there. And then do the book community accounting part there. And if people came in to pay, of course they could pay down there, they had come up town. And then it's from 1:30 to 5:00, they could pay down there. So that went on until the Mutual Savings decided to buy the building next door and fix it up. But I had moved out, I mean I had left then. I was working with the North Carolina Mutual. 38:03 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. But after that, Mutual Savings bought that building, developed and made a very nice building out of it. It's still being used by some governmental group. But then they bought the building around the corner, not more than three years ago. And now they have this building around and maybe five stories, four or five stories around next to the post office. And that's where they are now. Very nice building. But then eventually North Carolina Mutual bought all of the buildings from where the bank is now. And the bank was always on that first floor. I say always. I mean after that building was built, it was built with the bank participating on that first floor. And The Mutual had all the other floors, including the basement. All right, then The Mutual bought piece by piece until they bought all the buildings to this side of it, to the corner, this building and a part of the building next door to it, to us here. 38:45 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And then they bought a building out in the middle of that parking lot over there, which was a pretty good sized building. And we put our industrial department over there. We were growing real fast, put our industrial department over there and we put the tabulating department over there. This floor was our cafeteria and they built a ramp across our alley back there. So you could just walk out of one side and come out on over here and going over here. Then of course you had to go outdoors, go across over there. And on this level we had the cafeteria. Below here was an auditorium where we met once a week, all the employees gathered and they would have a kind of forum program. In fact that's what they called it, a forum, at which time we would update it on what the company was doing. 39:50 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. And it was operated with employee officers. So the officers of the company would come in and participate when called upon to do things. We had speakers that would come to Durham from everywhere, just about, to visit the office. If they came in on the day that we would have the forum, we always had them to come down and give us a talk. Then you would go through the door, the imprint of the door is still on the wall over there on the other side. We'd go into the next building. And over there we had the claims department, the actuary department, on the first floor we had our printing department. As I can remember when we moved from over here to [indistinct 00:41:26] chapel hill street. Now you know where it is beyond on other side of chapel hill street here. Now, I worked in there from the time that they opened that building in 1965 until I retired in 1981. I worked in that building. And soâ€” 40:42 Paul Ortiz Was there ever a talk about siting Mutual in the Hayti district or was itâ€”? 41:49 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. No, I don't recall any mention of ever moving it there. Now, I've heard of references of the bank, in recent years, moving a Biltmore building down in that area, but I don't hear much more about that anymore. But we did have a district office down there and all of our agents had worked in this area, worked out at the office down there. 41:54 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. I [indistinct 00:42:29] do all this yawning, brother. I stayed up late. 42:20 Paul Ortiz Right. I'll just ask you one or two wrap up questions. And you can go on with your busy day. When did you meet Mrs. Bryant? 42:32 R. Kelly Bryant, Jr. Well, that's interesting. I met her in college when I was at Hampton. She lived in the little town outside of Hampton called Phoebus. It was near Buckroe beach area. But it was between the school area and the beach. And she was a student there finishing the high school, that was the Phoenix High School that was at that time located on Hampton's campus. And it was used as a training place for teachers of our school. And Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia. I had a cousin there from Rocky Mou"
