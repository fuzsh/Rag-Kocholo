I also wanted to post it here, where it seems folks really appreciate their Dayton nostalgia. I would be interested to see if anyone has photos from the 1980s of the businesses mentioned in the post: The House of Magic, Elder-Beerman Van Buren, Rike's Kettering, Armadillo Records, or Westward Ho. Thank you!\n\nDisappearing Dayton landmarks\n\nPosted by: daytonnostalgia\n\nDate: November 13, 2007 11:37PM\n\nThank you for reading my first post at the Dayton Daily News forums. While I wish my topic pertained more to the Speak Up! folder so that maximum traffic will view it, I'm also quite content staying out of the political line of fire.\n\nWith the announcement of the closing of GS Outfitters, Sidney Schultz echoed my feelings when he said \"the very texture of our lives is going away.\" We have lost dining landmarks such as Neil's Heritage House and more recently, Dominic's. Nothing is left of the former site of Elder-Beerman Van Buren, which was such a fond yarn in the fabric of my childhood. I have also been a local magic enthusiast for around 20 years, and Dayton lost a real treasure when The House of Magic closed in the mid-'90s.\n\nArmadillo Records is gone... The Westward Ho... Rike's... I would like to hear your memories of these great businesses of the past and more that have disappeared from the Dayton area. Mike C\n\n13 posts\n\nDec 24, 2007\n\n9:52 AM I remember when GS Outfitters was \"General Surplus\". They had all sorts of Army surplus items. I bought all my Army things there, canteen, shirts, pants and assorted items to play \"Army man\". They had lots of neat things and the store always had that certain smell about it.\n\nI'm waiting for Bonnetts books to close at any time. I spent may a dollar there buying all my older comic books.\n\nHow about all the \"Chili Parlors\" we had in Dayton. Pedros on S. Gettsyburg and Michaels Chili on Main Street. I'm sure there were more but I can only remember those two. historymom\n\n5 posts\n\nMar 26, 2008\n\n4:55 PM I could go on for hours about this one! Growing up in Kettering, I can relate to your memories of Elder Beerman Van Buren. I used to love it when they put up their Christmas decorations. It made it seem like a \"big city\" department store. I really miss Rike's Kettering; especially when it wasn't quite so fancy and had checkouts by the front door. Kresge's was in the same shopping center and all the neighborhood kids would walk over there in the summer and buy cokes and hot dogs at the grill.\n\nWe also had \"Shopper's Fair\" which is where the \"Bob's Food Warehouse\" stood for many years.\n\nDoes anyone remember \"Sandy's\" hamburger restaurant? The logo was a scottish lass in a kilt. We had several of those in Dayton.\n\nI also miss Sears downtown. \"Downtown Dayton Day\" was wonderful. My friends parents would actually let them skip school to go shopping! Downtown was the place to be!\n\nI remember thinking the Petula Clark song \"Downtown\" was about downtown Dayton! Jimmy Z\n\n1 post\n\nApr 15, 2008\n\n7:40 PM I'd like to know if any one remebers Sisari's Cashba Lounge and Cafeteria at 101 East Stewart, across the street from the National Cash Register Company (NCR). It was owned by my cousin Catherine and her husband John Sisari in the 1950's and 60's. They did a great business as they cashed NCR employee pay checks. Do any of you remeber Catherine or John? She died in 1975 of cancer. John died in 1981. They had an adopted daughter, April. Does anyone know where Aril is today? E-mail me or call 301 261-7849 Bill68\n\n21 posts\n\nDec 22, 2008\n\n4:20 PM I was born in August, 1950 so I was 13 when the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan on Feb.9, 1964. The 60's, for me anyway, started that night and ended with the Sharon Tate murder on August 9, 1969. Those were magical years growing up in Dayton. I lived in Northridge and caught a bus near the Frisch's on Keowee, went downtown to Mayor's Records and met the pre-hippie kids there, went to Sears and sometimes had a hot dog at their stand-up counter, met girls on the mezzanine at Rike's and sometimes had a submarine sandwich at the sub shop there. Looked at the latest fashions at Price Stores, Rikes, and the old Elder-Beerman store across from McCrory's. Remember pin-stripe hip-huggers? The girls with long straight hair in 1965? The girls who wore matching tights and sweaters with a short skirt in between? Go-go boots? All the boys used Jade East cologne (which is available again) and sometimes Hai Karate. Lots of Beatle boots, sometimes made of suede, bought at Hardy's on Main St. Picture Simon and Garfunkel on The Sounds of Silence album with jeans and boots. Everyone seemed to have a maroon shirt and frequently a short sleeve Poor Boy sweater in blue or maroon. The kids who met downtown tried for that look while the greasers didn't seem to be downtown, but stayed back at their home grounds for the most part.\n\nWhat I think I miss most are the smells of the Arcade, McCrory's, Kresge's, and the theatres downtown. TheSquirrel\n\n2 posts\n\nJan 31, 2009\n\n6:29 PM Here's a landmark: the KAP Signs mural on N. Main Street, across from the end of Shiloh Springs Rd. Facing northbound, the mural depicted a little girl having just written \"KAP Signs\" in crayon. The last S was backwards; although that's a stereotypical kiddie error, someone told me that really was a mistake. Also, the crayon she had in her hands was not the same color as the last letter. Even so, KAP did a lot or murals and wooden signs in Dayton throughout at least the 80s.\n\nDoes anyone remember this \"eyesore\" landmark: on the north side of the then T-intersection of Turner Rd. and Wolf Rd., was a discount department store of some sort that was constructed in the middle of a field, yet never opened. It sat languishing empty for years, with some graffiti, until it was finally demolished. I think it was eliminated as training for local firefighters, same as the nearby unfinished senior version of a Cardinal community at the T-intersection of Basore Rd. and Shiloh Springs.\n\nWho remembers the Imperial House South? It was at the northwest corner of the I-75/SR-725 interchange, and most recently was a Ramada IIRC. One thing I remember about that place was the interior corridor on the west side was LONG. Also, they had a catering hall that was popular for local functions (did that later become a niteclub called the \"boom-boom room\"?). It was only demolished recently, apparently for a car dealer to locate there. There was also an Imperial House North; it was at the Needmore exit, and in it became a Radisson, with Georgio club (visited there as a young adult, when veteran DJ Gene \"by-golly\" Barry was in charge). Not sure what's there now.\n\nOther vanished landmarks:\n\n-- the four tall smokestacks along the Great Miami River at I-75 in Moraine, with a sign on the plant structure reading \"Dayton Power and Light Company\" These were torn down in the 90s IIRC. I think they were replaced with cleaner technology generators. (Another DP&L generator, close to downtown, also vanished; these were located a few hundred yards south of Sinclair, on the other side of the tracks)\n\n-- On I-70, at the Englewood exit, was a HUGE colorful sign for the Holiday Inn there, which due to its position in the Stillwater valley, could be seen from miles away at night. We used to call this their \"jukebox\" sign, which Holiday Inn phased out in the early 1980s in favor more plain, energy-efficient signage. So conspicuous was this particular landmark, when it was replaced with a smaller sign in 1984, at least one person missed their I-70 exit!\n\nSample \"jukebox\" sign:\n\nhttp://www.yesterland.com/images-sidetrips/motel3.jpg TEW\n\n5 posts\n\nFeb 03, 2009\n\n7:32 PM Here are a few old places to jog your memory, depending on your age of course: Lowe's Ames theater on Main Street near Forest Park, Victory theater downtown Dayton (not the current one), Lowes theater downtown Dayton, The Hullabaloo behind Forest Park(saw the Hollies there),Golden Point fast food restaurant on Dixie Dr next to the Pastime bowling alley, the Candlelight Restaurant in Northridge near the Dixie Drive-in theater. Good ole days. tlturbo\n\n85 posts\n\nFeb 05, 2009\n\n10:32 AM Squirrel\n\nI remember the Imperial House places. Only because they both had a restaurant and on Friday (I think) nights they had an all you could eat seafood buffet. Had LOBSTER. THAT was a great place to take a gal if you wanted to impress her. All the Lobster you could eat. The Imperial House South was across I-75 from the drive-in I think. Bill68\n\n40 posts\n\nFeb 05, 2009\n\n3:53 PM Loved The Golden Point. It became Jacquie's later. The Pastime was a great place to bowl around 1965, 1966, and 1967. They had pretty good hamburgers there also. I saw a picture of the Golden Point in one of my old year books. There was a Cha-R-Burger next to the Northridge Middle School farther up N. Dixie where the kids would meet and, sometimes, fight. trolleyfan\n\n4 posts\n\nFeb 28, 2010\n\n9:29 PM I grew up in Belmont and then Kettering on Ackerman Blvd. I was at Town and Country Shopping center when it first opened. Not ONE of the original stores are still there. I remember; Millers Sporting Goods, The Metropolitan, Howard Johnson Restaurant, Grey's Drug Store, Kresges Dime Store, Chris Harris Record Rack, Vic Cassano and Mom Donesi's Pizza Palace. How about Gallaghers Drug Store in Belmont, or the old trolly Barn at Smithville and Watervliet, that became Parkmoor Drive In, or the Equity Deli, Max's Shoe Store, Alber's Grocery Store, Kennitts Dept Store, and Gastino's Hardware, Murphy's Bakery, Bower's Records and TV Shop with listening booths. Want More ? I have tons of memories. rosewoodroyal83\n\n8 posts\n\nMar 03, 2010\n\n4:14 PM Wow, what a great thread! I'm referring to posts, then I'll list a few of my own.\n\ndayton nostalgia - Armadillo Records! The entire back wall was 45s of the top 100. Neil's Heritage House, and across the street was Cassano's store #1. How do you close your first store?\n\nhistorymom - Bob's Food warehouse, no shopping bags, just boxes from the store's stock. El-Bee VB, toys, records, and electronics in the basement, various things in the mezzanine over the years.\n\nThe Squirrel - My grandmother worked for Ledex, downtown and later in Vandalia. We went to her company Christmas party every year at Wampler's/Hara. They gave age appropriate gifts to all the children in attendance, unheard of today. I remember driving by that eyesore everytime we went. I had always heard that some sort of union issues kept it from being completed. \"SCAB\" was grafittied all over the building. The DP&L smokestacks were always the sign to a little kid in the car that we were almost there when going downtown on NB 75.\n\ntrolleyfan -Yes I want more memories and insights to the Dayton of the past.\n\nAh, Town and Country, seperate buildings with driveways between the buildings. Many a time my mom snatched my arm to keep me from getting hit just running off the curb without looking. The Metroplolitan, it took a pretty special occasion for us to go there. Eichelberger was over Shroyer from T&C. Liberal Market(which became Freedom Foods when Liberal closed), EF MacDonald, a Revco maybe?\n\nAnd now a few of my own, Gray or was it Grey Drug, I remember one in Van Buren Shopping center, on forrer near the Smithville end. Kroger at the east end, Woolworth, etc. Going to Olan Mills behind T&C for pictures that were insanely expensive and took forevr to get. I have an envelope full of OM pics my parents had taken of a pretty young me in 1974. 2 poses, 3 8x10, 5 5x7, and 1 11x14 - $85.60!!! in 1974 That was like a month's worth of groceries in 1974!\n\nDa-Bel Theater, Burger Chef, when KFC was Colonel Sander's and Lee's was Famous Recipe, Arthur Treacher's, London Bobby, Brun's, Fotomat, Union 76, Gulf, Bonded, Phillips 66, Atta-Boy, Wolohan Lumber, King Kwik, Stop & Go, Borden on David near Captain Kidd drive-in etc, Rink's, Gold Circle, Fazio's, Red Baron arcade at the Dayton Mall, etc, etc Last Edited by on Mar 03, 2010 4:18 PM fishers1951\n\n17 posts\n\nMar 03, 2010\n\n5:02 PM Squirrel and others: Probably about '75 or '80 we were stupid enough to be talked into going to some meeting to get involved in a pyramid plan - they were going to open a discount/club type store in that vacant \"Scab\" building. Cant for the life of me remember what the group was called - but I did get a real nice set of pots and pans that you had to buy to join. We were supposed to reap the benefits of everyone who shopped there!!then, of course, you were supposed to get others to join under your name. What a ripoff...

It looked a little like a German blue max cross pendant. trolleyfan\n\n5 posts\n\nMar 07, 2010\n\n4:19 PM Talk about fashion ! (that I wish I could FORGET !) I was living on Ackerman Blvd and in the sixth grade at Oakview Elementary School. That was most likely 1956 or 57. The guys wore White Bucks (shoes) and the trend that spring was trousers that were either flourescent green, orange, or yellow ! HOW COULD WE WEAR THAT CRAP ? But we did and thought we were the coolest. leafy\n\n5 posts\n\nMar 10, 2010\n\n10:29 PM trolleyfan\n\nMy aunt and uncle lived on Ackerman Blvd in the late 50's Bob and Evelyn Ackerman(not named for them)\n\ntwo sons, Bob and Jerry and a daughter Debbie\n\nneighbors of yours??? trolleyfan\n\n6 posts\n\nMar 14, 2010\n\n5:20 PM Doesn't ring a bell, but that was 51 years ago.

I've been racking my brain trying to remember the name of that church. Thank You. We played St. Anthony's on several Sunday Afternoons, I think in 1963 and 1964. The full name of our band was Marvin, Betty, anf the Triumphs. We also played with the WING jocks at Forest Park Caverns, and Wamplers Ball-A-Rena. Usually with Skinny Bobby Harper or Lew Swanson. We also played a couple Saturdays at the Coca Cola Auditorium at the WING Teen Club hosted by Jim Smith. I do remember Teddy & The Rough Riders quite well. We played once or twice with them at a battle of the bands. Teddy Grills is still living in Fairborn last I heard and Jim Hargrove (guitar and brains behind the band) is living in Texas. I have all three of their singles still, but trying hard to find the album they did with WING called Swing With Wing. They were featured on side A and a Folk Group was on side B. We never played with Gene Barry much to my regret. He was my favorite Jock at Wing and I LOVED his sign off. Thanks again for the name.

I grew up in Belmont before moving to Kettering in my junior high school year. I remember most all the places in Belmont you mentioned. I lived on Nordale and spent most all my errand and grass cutting money in \"downtown\" Belmont. It was a wonderful place to grow up. I've tried to find pictures of that area from the 50's but have had very little luck. Hankster65\n\n7 posts\n\nMay 04, 2010\n\n1:17 PM Some of the more obscure places from downtown Dayton that I remember...there was the area around Jefferson and 5th that had all the pawn shops. As a kid I loved that somewhat gritty area. I still remember seeing \"Saturday Night Specials,\" that is cheap guns, in the pawn shop windows for $12.95. And they always had the nudie playing cards on display, which at that age was pretty darned exciting.\n\nThen there was the Ohio Theater and the Rialto. (I think that was the name.) They would have been around Jefferson and 6th. Fairly sleazy, but, cheap admission.\n\nOver on Ludlow there were some nasty bars: Mac's, the Minute, and the Rocket, along with some flop houses, such as the Antler Hotel. There was also a cab company there and a greasy spoon restaurant, the name of which escapes me. There was also an adult movie theater and book store called the Cinema X. If you wonder how I remember all this its because I spent one summer working at the Cinema X to help get me through college. But don't tell anybody! phil pixley\n\n11 posts\n\nMay 04, 2010\n\n1:50 PM Hankster65,man you just listed some great places that made Dayton different&great!!!You can only have so many franchises&then your city will loose its identity.Not everyone wants to be abig farm town like the big cow town to the west. phil pixley\n\n12 posts\n\nMay 04, 2010\n\n1:53 PM Sorry I meant to the east,oh well same difference!!

LOVED IT. Hankster65\n\n11 posts\n\nMay 04, 2010\n\n6:15 PM Hey, Phil, I went to Belmont Elementary, then freshman year at Belmont High, then sophomore year at Patterson Co-op, followed by junior and senior years at Fairmont West, where I graduated in 1965. My favorite school was Patterson, largely because it was downtown. From the time I was young, maybe about 11, I took the bus downtown and loved it. Spent many happy hours prowling the pawn shops, the movie houses, and yeah, the library...the old one and the \"new\" one. Who knows, we may have crossed paths at some point. As a kid too young to drive, the only time I went to the major places such as Rikes was to Christmas shop and to \"pick up\" girls. Sadly I was a much better shopper than a picker upper! trolleyfan\n\n11 posts\n\nMay 04, 2010\n\n8:10 PM I have one great picture of Belmont in 1953. I was standing in front of Bower's record store looking towards Smithville. Tell me how to E-mail it to you and I will, or if you can post pics here, tell me how. I went to kindergarten at Belmont Elementery, moved to Ackerman Blvd in Kettering and went 6 years at Oakview Elementary, 7th grade at Dwight Barns Jr. High ( the original Fairmont High School) and moved to Beavercreek in Woodhaven and went the rest of the way at Beavercrekk High School. Bought my first guitar at one of the sleezy pawn shops you mentioned, dreamed of the day I could sneak into the Mayfair Theatre, which I never did LOL. I graduated in 1964 so we are just 1 year apart. OH! remember the Pecan Rolls at Murphy's Bakery ?

I had forgotten that \"Belmont Bakery\" was known as \"Murphey's Bakery\" back in the day. I don't remember the pecan rolls, I must have been too busy with the custard filled stuff. Your name doesn't ring a bell, but considering the decrapitated state of this old mind that's hardly surprising. We may have crossed paths at some point.\n\nSorry you were never successful at sneaking into the Mayfair. That kind of place will never be ever again. It was quite the place. I think I first successfully conned my way in when I was 15. If I recall, the trick to conning your way in was to have the admission price! I don't think they were real gung ho on adhering to those pesky legal technicalities.\n\nMy first wife (Jacquie Hicks) lived right off Ackerman on Cushing and went to Barnes. Maybe you knew her or one of her sisters. This board is great...I'm really glad I found it. - Tim Adams Last Edited by on May 05, 2010 3:59 PM trolleyfan\n\n12 posts\n\nMay 05, 2010\n\n8:30 PM Hi Tim and icsalum. I just sent Curt and you Tim the two pics you asked for. Maybe we did meet. It's been a long time ago. My name is Barry Kiefaber and I was born in Belmont but moved to Ackerman Blvd when I was five. I still spent a lot of time in Belmont. My Uncle Lamar started and owned Tobias Funeral Home and my cousin Danny Tobias and I are the same age. I was up there a lot. When I was a sophmore at Beavercreek High School, I played organ for Marv & Betty & the Triumphs around Dayton for several Years. I met a ton of people while in the band. Anyway I agree this board is very cool and I love talking about the good ole days. It's a way to kinda go back and visit. I'll see if i can find any more pics. Take care.

They probably go for megabucks to collectors. nightcrawler\n\n1 post\n\nMay 28, 2010\n\n3:01 PM Trolleyfan Do you remember a gig where Marv, Betty and the Triumphs played the first half of a show/dance and Ivan and the Sabres played the second half? It was at Wampler's--not sure if is was the Barn or the Ballarena. Probably 1963. trolleyfan\n\n13 posts\n\nMay 29, 2010\n\n7:19 PM Not sure about a specific gig, but we played on the same bill as Ivan & the Sabres 5 or 6 times. I do remember one at Forest Park Caverns, and we were at Wamplers Ballarena several times. I knew Ivan (Dale Browne) before the bands as he lived next door to my Uncle Chuck and Aunt Helen on Lammers Court off Farhills Avenue and the road that Siebanthallers Nursery was on. The gig I remember in 1964 was at Wamplers when we opened for Lonnie Mack. I really loved that band. Nobody was tighter.

With a matinee and gifts. (Circa 1966-69) Later the Journal Herald newspaper used to hold their annual paperboy recognition program there.I got Joe Nuxall's autograph there one year Does anyone have memories of the \"Old River\" pool. I stopped by about a year ago. I thought as I was walking up to the old entrance to the bath house it was still there, but alas in had been filled in..

If I ever win half a billion in one of the super-lottos, one thing I will do is buy that land from (I, guess it's) U.D., reinstate that pool, and endow it for operating costs - and then donate it to the City of Dayton (or better still, MetroParks) as a free pool for all kids, young and old, in the region.\n\nOf course I realize that expecting to find a way to restore those great high-dives and the deep well without exhausting the endowment on insurance money (if an insurer could be found) is probably as much of a pipe dream as winning all that bread. Sigh. RnRDoc57\n\n1 post\n\nJun 06, 2010\n\n4:02 PM Hi, all. Been reading thru this thread with much interest and thought I'd add my two pennies.\n\nOn the subject of Dayton record stores...I worked at quite a few of them. Not an original Daytonian, but moved here in '76 to open Second Time Around with a friend of mine. I consider it also a disappeared landmark, as it has long since changed from what it started out as. In 1980, it changed hands, and soon thereafter was remodeled to become more like a \"mall store\". Not the \"homey little shop\" it once was.\n\nAlso worked at Armadillo's for a year or so, and Trader Vic's Music Emporium (now Cassano's), and also for my buddy Geoff at Renaissance Music Media, which closed up in '03.\n\nAnd a note to trolleyfan,\n\nyou said you liked Gene Barry's sign-off...check out WSWO Ultimate Oldies, 101.1 out of Huber Heights, on Thursday nights at 7. My friend, Coastal Eddy does the Radio Cafe show 7 - 10 and uses the same sign-off. trolleyfan\n\n14 posts\n\nJun 09, 2010\n\n7:38 PM Thanks for the heads up RnRDoc57. Unfortunly, I still live in Atlanta Georgia and can't access the Dayton Stations. I am in the process of trying to move back to Dayton, so next time we come up I will certainly check out Coastal Eddy's Sign Off. Also, what was the name of the used record store at the corner of Stroop & Marshall Rds back in the late 70 or Early Eighty's. I bought some really rare 45's back then, and next time I came home, it was gone. Also there was a decent shop on Smithville Ave on the same side of the road as Van Buren Shopping Center. It was down by what I think is a car wash, just down from where Wilmington dumped out on Smithville. deanbob\n\n1 post\n\nDec 20, 2011\n\n8:44 AM To Squirrel\n\nThe only big building at Turner and Wolf was supposed to be Skateworld of Dayton, then it was a hot minute going to be the new location for Children's Palace or the upstart Toy R Us...\n\nbut it was never fully operational if I recall Rummah\n\n14 posts\n\nDec 22, 2011\n\n9:27 PM Sorry to hear that Renaissance Music closed. It was a fun place. I remember going to it before checking out a midnight show at the Dabel. First place I ever saw CD's. aprils\n\n1 post\n\nMay 13, 2012\n\n12:22 PM I've see several post's looking for the daughter of John & Catherine Sisari. I'm here in Dayton. If you have any information ie: pictures, matchbooks, ashtrays, memorabilia from the Cashba...please contact me! Suellen813Hd\n\n1 post\n\nMay 13, 2012\n\n9:44 PM I lived in Dayton until 1974. I remember Rike's and the Arcade. We lived above the arcade in apartment many years ago. I remember the Red White and Blue Pool hall, and the Rialto theater. Found this site when trying to find a 1950's telephone book to look up our old phone number on Van Lear street. luv my dayton\n\n3 posts\n\nMay 24, 2012\n\n12:22 PM So many landmarks have fallen to the bulldozer. Don't forget the Carillon Cafeteria. As previously listed have been to everyone of them. Westward Ho was an every week thing with my in-laws and never got a bad meal there. Magic shop I think was near there on Brown street. I remember Shelley dress shoppe downtown Dayton,where on Mondays a DJ named Jolly Rogers broadcast from there and we would head down there so we could make a dedication to our newest weekly crush. I also remember when the streets were safe to be. Sad how things have changed."
