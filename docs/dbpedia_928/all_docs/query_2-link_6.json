        "text": "The Jack Eckerd Corporation, a Florida-based drugstore chain, announced yesterday that it was offering to buy Revco D.S., the large drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy after a failed leveraged buyout.\n\nRevco said it had rejected the Eckerd bid, submitted on May 16, at a board meeting on June 6 because the offer was \"insufficient in value for further consideration.\" Revco, based in Twinsburgh, Ohio, said the Eckerd bid was unsolicited. Eckerd offered to buy the company and bring it out of its bankruptcy reorganization effort; Revco filed a plan for reorganization on June 7.\n\nDespite the rejection, the offer has the support of some of Revco's creditors, and it could still succeed. The offer came about because a committee of one group of Revco's creditors, frustrated with the reorganization's slow pace, asked Eckerd to bid, people involved in the bankruptcy said. Value Not Disclosed\n\nThe total value of the offer was not disclosed. But in a recent court hearing, a Revco lawyer estimated that the company had a value of about $835 million. An adviser to one of the creditor committees, however, said the market was putting the value of all of Revco's securities at about $340 million.\n\n\"While we have not received a formal response to our proposal, we have been told the information requested would not be forthcoming at this time,\" Eckerd's chairman, Stewart Turley, said in a statement. Revco's management has reportedly refused to turn over financial information Eckard said it would need to proceed with the offer.\n\nDavid Supino, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company, Revco's investment banker, said in a statement that \"most creditors of Revco have expressed their belief that they would receive more value in a stand-alone reorganization plan\" than through an acquisition like the one offered by Eckerd.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
