The move established an instant challenge to Walgreen Co.'s long-standing dominance of the trade class in terms of dollar volume, created a force to be reckoned with in the pharmacy benefits management market, and sent ripples of uncertainty through every medium-size chain in an already dramatically consolidated industry.\n\nRite Aid chairman and chief executive officer Martin Grass frames the blockbuster deal primarily in terms of the competition to administer third-party prescription drug plans.\n\nComparing the prospects of Rite Aid's pharmacy benefits management company (PBM), Eagle Managed Care, with those of the pharmaceutical manufacturer-owned PBMs that now dominate the market, Grass says the merger will begin to level the playing field. He contends Rite Aid will be the best positioned drug chain in the country to compete for managed care contracts with the three drug company-owned PBMs (Merck-Medco Managed Care Inc., a subsidiary of Merck & Co.; PCS Health Systems, which is owned by Eli Lilly & Co.; and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Diversified Pharmaceutical Services). Rite Aid will now be able to offer third-party payers unsurpassed pharmacy services and prices, he adds.\n\nThe expansion of the store network behind Eagle will be important leverage in attracting new contracts, comments Grass. Payers and administrators \"can't afford to ignore the numbers of stores we can offer their plans - numbers no other retailer can rival,\" he says. \"Bigger is better.\"\n\nRite Aid's commitment to keeping pharmacy margins profitable was reinforced this year when Grass withdrew the chain from the Maryland state employees prescription drug benefits plan, which, beginning January 1, was scheduled to start being administered by Merck-Medco. Grass believed the PBM's terms were so oppressive that participating in the plan would be a losing proposition.\n\nSeveral other retail pharmacy operators doing business in Maryland - CVS, Giant Food Inc., NeighborCare Pharmacies and the Epic network - took a similar position. With state employees having few options for places to go for prescriptions, Maryland was forced to cancel its contract with Merck-Medco.\n\n\"We're not going to let the middleman make a profit on our backs,\" Grass said in December.\n\nHe also vowed that the pullout would not be an isolated event. \"We'll continue to look at each plan individually, but we'll also be much more aggressive and vocal on this issue. This is the first large plan we have rejected, but it will not be the last.\"\n\nThe move by Rite Aid was not without risk, as a pending lawsuit by Merck-Medco charging antitrust violations demonstrates.\n\nMeanwhile, through the Revco merger Rite Aid hurtles forward in the conventional chain drug business, extending its industry leadership in store count to over 4,500 units in 22 states. That gives it more than twice as many outlets as No. 2 Walgreens. Projected annual sales of nearly $10 billion at Rite Aid mean Walgreens, which had volume of $10.4 billion in its last full fiscal year, may finally have to look over its shoulder at a competitor. And the cost of completing the transaction notwithstanding, Rite Aid executives expect the merger to add to earnings very quickly.\n\nThe acquisition increases the drug chain's debt as a percent of total capital from 48% to 59.6%, but the company has pledged to reduce it below 50% within three years. Rite Aid will take a onetime restructuring charge of around $163 million to complete the deal, but expects to save close to $156 million a year through efficiencies gained by combining operations. The savings will come specifically from closing Revco's headquarters in Twinsburg, Ohio; eliminating redundancies in such areas as advertising and distribution; and through economies of scale in buying.\n\nThree or more of 11 distribution centers of the combined operation are likely to be closed. Most likely Revco facilities will be shuttered, because of Grass' belief that Rite Aid's warehouse technology is superior. For the same reason Revco's point-of-sale scanning and pharmacy computer systems will be replaced by Rite Aid's.\n\nSome 300 stores will be closed in major markets across the Midwest and Southeast. Whether Rite Aid or Revco units will be shuttered will be determined on a case by case assessment of real estate and performance. But all the stores in the merged chain will get the Rite Aid banner.\n\nGrass says fewer than 50 people will be needed to replace 1,100 jobs being eliminated at the Revco home office. Two Revco executives who will stay with the merged company are Jim Mastrian and Jay Ross. Mastrian, who was executive vice president of marketing at Revco, will be executive vice president of merchandising at Rite Aid, where he will be in charge of advertising and pricing as well as merchandising. Ross, vice president of merchandising at Revco, will serve along with him. Rite Aid executive vice president of marketing Kevin Mann will be responsible for purchasing.\n\nThe executives will be able to exploit first-place drug store market shares from Portland, Me., to Nashville, Tenn., and from Charleston, S.C., to Grand Rapids/Muskegon, Mich. While the merger adds only one state, Illinois, to Rite Aid's territory, it will give the chain newfound power in a number of key areas.\n\nIn Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Va., for example, Rite Aid will become the dominant player. Before the merger it controlled 14% of the drug store market there, while Phar-Mor Inc. had 15% and Revco held 31%. Now Rite Aid will have a stranglehold on the area with a 45% share.\n\nIn greater Cincinnati, where Walgreens led a close race with a 25% share, Rite Aid will add its 7% to Revco's 21% and instantly vault to No. 1. In Charlotte/Gastonia, N.C./Rock Hill, S.C., the addition of Revco's 27% share to Rite Aid's 7% will allow the latter to challenge Eckerd Corp. for the top spot. Both chains will control some 35% of drug store volume.\n\nLikewise in Pittsburgh, Rite Aid's 15% share added to Revco's 14% will put the former in a dead heat with hometown chain Thrift Drug, which accounts for 29% of the business in what is the 13th largest drug store market in the nation.\n\nA dramatic change is also in store for the No. 8 market, the booming Cleveland area, which attracted Walgreens in 1994. Walgreens' blitz of \"America's North Coast\" gave it a 4% share last year with 19 stores, and the chain plans to add perhaps 40 more outlets in the market in the near term. But now it will have to contend with a combined Rite Aid-Revco share of 32%, as well as the 22% share of former market leader Marc's.\n\nAs stunning as the November 1995 announcement of the purchase of Revco was, Rite Aid was hardly sleeping earlier in the year. Under Grass, who took over the reins of the company from his father, Alex, in early March, the drug chain was active on the acquisition and divestiture front in Florida, New England and New York City.\n\nIn the Sunshine State Rite Aid sold the stores or assets of 109 units to Eckerd Corp. for about $75 million, leaving it with just 24 outlets in northern Florida. In New England the company picked up 18 drug stores and two health and beauty aids units from Brooks Pharmacy, while selling Brooks the stores or assets of 36 outlets in Massachusetts and Rhode island. A drive to be No. 1 or No. 2 in every one of its markets led to the moves, according to Grass.\n\n\"We want to get out of weak states like that and really concentrate on the states in which we have some power,\" he commented last year.\n\nIn greater New York Rite Aid decided that Duane Reade, long the dominant player, was ride for a challenge and maneuvered into the No. 1 spot by buying 50 outlets from Pathmark Stores Inc. and Red Apple Supermarkets. The purchase gave Rite Aid more than 100 units in the country's No. 2 drug store market, compared with Duane Reade's 60 stores. (The Revco deal added 14 outlets in the borough of Staten Island.)\n\nIt can be fairly said that even before the merger with Revco Rite Aid was storming markets throughout its operating area. All told, the chain debuted hundreds of new, relocated or expanded stores in its last fiscal year, and it has a similar number on the drawing board this year as part of a three-year plan to complete 1,000 such projects.\n\n\"We're really smoking,\" Grass said last fall. \"I don't think that anybody else is going to be knocking out 300-plus 10,00-square-foot stores a year.\"\n\nWell before the merger the executive had made real estate the heart of a new corporate strategy featuring enlarged stores, united management for pharmacy and the front end, and sale of noncore businesses. Rite Aid completed its divestiture of such operations with the sale of its ADAP auto parts chain last spring.\n\nThe payoff of the growth strategy was new stores averaging over $3 million in sales. Grass attributes that performance to an expanded prototype, which is transforming a chain that rose to the front ranks of the industry as a bantam store operator. The new 10,000-square-foot units provide sufficient space to emphasize convenience food, enlarged cosmetics and bath departments, one-hour photoprocessing and drive-through pharmacies when possible.\n\n\"We're giving consumers much more of a reason to come to us,\" he remarks.\n\nSenior vice president of corporate real estate Phil Markovitz adds, \"We think of ourselves today as much more of a destination store than years ago when we just appended ourselves to supermarkets in shopping centers.\"\n\nHe notes that new units are generally freestanding, with 40 to 50 parking spots and, ideally, are situated at major intersections with a traffic light.\n\nDuring the year Grass and Markovitz built up Rite Aid's real estate department to 15 area directors and three regional directors, while dedicating six of the chain's lawyers to real estate full time.\n\nRite Aid has also gone the extra mile to engender goodwill locally, as evidenced by store openings in New York and Philadelphia. In the case of New York, the retailer managed to launch a new unit on January 8 - the day of the blizzard of '96. The outlet in Brooklyn was the only store open on its block and customers poured in, according to district manager John Sullivan.\n\nIn Philadelphia Rite Aid has won a positive reception for its construction of an outlet on the site of the burned and demolished Palumbo's restaurant, a longtime landmark. When a Catholic church around the corner asked if the company could resurface its school playground, Rite Aid fulfilled the request.\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquisition, it remains to be seen how Revco's 8,450-square-foot prototype stores will fit in with Rite Aid's move toward larger outlets. But Grass maintains, \"The Revco prototype-size stores are such that we'll be able to merchandise them the way we want to.\"\n\nWhile the merger was announced just prior to winter, Grass actually hatched the plan last summer. At the National Association of Chain Drug Stores board meeting in August he said he found \"a very negative environment to the effect that declining pharmacy margins were destroying the chain drug industry. I understood that this mood was conducive to an acquisition. And in my view no chain would fit our needs or overlay our markets so completely as would Revco.\"\n\nReturning to Camp Hill, he phoned David Schulte, a partner in the Zell/Chilmark Fund LP, which owned the largest bloc of Revco stock. Schulte was interested, and events moved swiftly from that point.\n\nGrass has praised Revco employees, especially in the operations and merchandising areas. He even concedes that Revco was possibly superior to Rite Aid in merchandise presentation, in-store ambience and promotional flair.\n\nOn the other hand, Rite Aid's more sophisticated operations, particularly in such areas as technology, made its pricing more responsive to marketplace realities than Revco's. The former's margins were about 2 points better than the latter's, he adds, while acknowledging, \"Revco ran exciting drug stores, and we can learn a lot from it.\"\n\nHowever the integration of the formats plays out, Rite Aid has already established one of the most imposing market positions in the history of chain drug retailing. To solidify that standing, Grass has opted to end Revco's reliance on weekly circulars in favor of TV commercials, with some print support.\n\n\"We have the store density to make television advertising pay,\" he explains. \"In fact, it's already paying off for us in the markets in which we've been testing it for the past several months. It's not that we're against tabs; it's that we don't believe we have to run one every week and take the margin hits to accomplish what we want to.\"\n\nPerhaps the highest praise for the decision to buy Revco comes from Alex Grass, a now legendary chain drug industry figure and still a Rite Aid board member. \"I truly believe that Martin is, by experience, training and knowledge, the ideal person to run Rite Aid,\" he says. \"Thus far, his actions as chief executive officer have justified that view.\"\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: RITE AID\n\n* HEADQUARTERS - Camp Hill, Pa.\n\n* INDUSTRY RANK - 1 in stores, 2 in sales\n\n* Full-year results (3/2/96)\n\nSales - $5.45 billion (+20.3%) Net earnings - $158.9 million (+12.5%) Net margins - 2.9% Comparable-store sales - +6.6%\n\n* Number of drug stores - 2,759\n\n* Number of states operating - 21 + D.C.\n\n* Number of drug stores opened in 1995 - 145\n\n* Number of drug stores closed or sold in 1995 - 215\n\n* Number of drug stores planned for 1996 - 350(*)\n\n* Average sales per store - $1.8 million(**)\n\n* Average store size - 9,600 sq. ft.\n\n* Distribution - Warehouses (5)\n\n* Excludes planned Revco acquisition.\n\n** CDR estimate\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Pathmark exits the stand-alone drug store business\n\nWOODBRIDGE, N.J. - The decision by Pathmark Stores Inc. to sell its 30- unit chain of conventional drug stores to Rite Aid Corp. last July has had significant effects on the retailers and the regional market.\n\nAs expected, the $60.5 million infusion of capital from the sale has helped strengthen Pathmark's strategic position in its core supermarket business and lessened its long-term debt. \"This divestiture has allowed us to focus on the growth of our supermarkets,\" comments chairman and chief executive officer Jack Futterman.\"\n\nOf greater significance to the chain drug industry was the abrupt market share realignment that took pace in greater New York in the wake of Pathmark's exit from the stand-alone drug store business. Rite Aid, which is the largest drug chain in North America in terms of store count, acquired the Pathmark stores as part of its strategy of establishing a leadership position in the New York market - the nation's second largest, with annual drug store sales of some $2.65 billion.\n\nThe deal upped Rite Aid's presence there from 51 to 80 units. Prior to the acquisition Duane Reade, which operates some 60 stores in New York, had been the longtime leader.\n\nWhile Rite Aid has launched a store redesign program in the Pathmark outlets that runs through 1996 to ensure a greater degree of consistency between the newly acquired stores and the remainder of the chain, there was virtually no downtime resulting from the change of ownership.\n\nFor Pathmark the objective of the transaction was to help increase the sales and profitability of its supermarket business. Plans call for a record number of store enlargements (25) this year, as well as the launch of additional Pathmark 2000 units (six of them are slated to debut). The latter format utilizes additional space to offer an expanded variety of products, especially high-margin perishables.\n\nArticle Details Title Annotation:1996 CDR State of the Industry Report; Rite Aid Corp.; Revco D.S.
