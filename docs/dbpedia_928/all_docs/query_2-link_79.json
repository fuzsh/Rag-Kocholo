        "text": "DOW DOLLAR YIELD30 INDUSTRIALS VS. JAPANESE YEN 30-YEAR U.S. BOND\n\n3038.46 129.90 8.00\n\n+7.15 -0.125 -0.01\n\nSTOCKS REBOUND. The stock market advanced Wednesday, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rising 7.15 points to 3,038.46.\n\n10-YEAR T-NOTE YIELDS FALL. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell in Wednesday's auction to the lowest level since 1987 as the government continued its $38-billion quarterly refunding. The average yield was 7.53 percent, down from 7.94 percent at the last auction on Aug. 7. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 7.5 percent. A total of $12-billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling $24.06-billion.\n\nTampa Bay/State\n\nEckerd sweetens\n\nbid for Revco\n\nJack Eckerd Corp. Wednesday announced improvements to its plan to acquire Revco D.S., Inc., the Twinsburg, Ohio-based drugstore chain that is reorganizing in bankruptcy court.\n\nThe new Eckerd proposal improves the stake that unsecured creditors, trade and noteholders would get in a newly formed company that would be the parent of Eckerd and Revco.\n\nEckerd submitted its new plan to bankruptcy court in Ohio after its original proposal was rejected by Revco creditors and after Rite Aid Corp., a national competitor, filed its proposal to take over Revco.\n\nAGENCY RATINGS UPDATED. Florida lottery officials on Wednesday pinpointed a mathematical error that inadvertently gave Tampa-based Earle Palmer Brown the lead in the contest for the lottery's $27-million ad account. After officials corrected the error, Tampa-based Bozell Inc. gained first place, with Earle Palmer Brown trailing in the rankings by two points. The two other competing agencies _ BBDO-South in Atlanta and W.B. Doner of Michigan and St. Petersburg _ keep their third and fourth rankings, respectively. The selection process remains stalled because four disqualified agencies filed protests with the state last week.\n\nHARDEE'S OUTLETS CLOSE. Hardee's Food Systems Inc. has closed three restaurants in the Largo area _ at 9080 Ulmerton Road, 1581 Missouri Ave. and 180 Belcher Road. The North Carolina company did not provide information about the store closings.\n\nSOUTHNET GETS CONTRACT. Southnet Corp., a Tampa-based long-distance telephone company, has received a three-year contract to provide operator services to Tec LD of Daleville, Ala. The contract calls for Tec LD to begin routing some long-distance calls to Southnet, which expects a $3.8-million increase in annual revenues.\n\nNation/World\n\nINSURERS HEALTHY. The vast majority of insurance companies remain financially secure, a new survey shows. Story, 2E\n\nKEATING DEFENSE TO REST. Charles Keating Jr.'s defense attorney said Wednesday he will rest his case without calling a witness and will tell jurors that prosecutors never proved Keating defrauded investors at his Lincoln Savings. Closing arguments are set for Tuesday in Los Angeles.\n\nBANK MERGER ENDORSED. A watchdog group said Wednesday it agreed not to challenge the planned merger of NCNB Corp. and C&S/Sovran Corp. in exchange for a role in the new bank's plans to lend $10-billion in low-income areas. The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, will help pre-qualify loan applicants for NationsBank.\n\nMATERNITY LEAVE APPROVED. Euro-\n\npean Community nations agreed Wednesday to guarantee women 14 weeks maternity leave at wages at least equal to the sick pay offered in their countries. The compromise moves the trade bloc toward common standards before it forms a single market at the end of next year. The United States and South Africa are the only industrialized nations in the world that do not require employers to provide some form of parental leave.\n\nEarnings\n\nBELMAC. Belmac Corp. of Tampa reported $602,000 in sales for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, the first significant revenues in company history. The Tampa pharmaceutical company had a loss of $1.4-million, or 18 cents per share, compared to a loss of $389,000, or 6 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. Belmac said the larger loss was the result of increased expenses as the company began selling its antibiotic drug in France.\n\nMID-STATE FEDERAL. Mid-State Federal Savings Bank in Ocala said Wednesday it earned $301,000, or 15 cents per share, for the quarter ending Sept. 30, which contributed to an annual profit of $1.52-million, or 75 cents a share. In the fiscal 1990 year, the thrift lost $1.97-million or 95 cents per share. Mid-State operates 24 branch offices in a five-county area in west-central Florida.\n\nCorrection\n\nRep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., opposed Clarence Thomas' nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, but did not vote on it since only the Senate acts on court nominations. A story Wednesday on Schroeder's appearance in Tampa had incorrect information."
