        "text": "Kent soon may have three stand-alone chain drugstores under construction at the same time, as drugstores rush to capture the local market share and serve the aging baby boomer population.\n\nAt Summit and South Water streets, Walgreens is expected to be under construction soon. The site is directly across the street from one of its competitors, CVS.\n\nMeanwhile, another CVS is planned for S.R. 59 at the Kent/Franklin Township border. Across the street, construction is beginning on Discount Drug Mart.\n\nAcross the state, the trend is the same. Chain drugstores are moving from strip malls to larger, stand-alone locations as they expand to serve an aging population.\n\nSometimes competitors wind up on the same corner because they reach the same conclusion about a location's customer base and convenience.\n\n\"Drugstores are vying for the convenient locations,\" Rite Aid Corp. spokeswoman Sarah Datz said Tuesday from Camp Hill, Pa. \"It's a normal thing.\"\n\nRite Aid, which has 3,800 stores in 30 states, has 310 in Ohio. About half of the Ohio stores have moved to new buildings or have been rebuilt in the past three years.\n\nLocally, Rite Aid soon may become the only drug store in Kent still located in a shopping plaza. Rite Aid spokesman Tom Andrzejewski said the company hasn't identified a site for a stand-alone location, although it continues to look for one.\n\n\"Rite Aid is always looking for ways to serve its customer base better,\" he said. \"Customers have voiced that the new, slightly larger stores better fill their needs. It's convenient for time-starved people who need the convenience of a drive-up pharmacy and a store where they can do a number of things at once.\"\n\nDatz said new and expanded stores mean improved convenience, selection and prices.\n\nThat's similar to the thinking of the Walgreens chain of 2,738 drugstores _ 80 of them in Ohio. Walgreens has a goal of 3,000 stores by next year.\n\nOne of them is planned for the former site of the Kent City Annex, which burned in 1982, and the sites of the Summit Car Wash, the old Kent city jail and two other houses. The jail, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is expected to be moved to Fred Fuller Park, where it will become a place for small parties. The other structures are to be razed.\n\nWalgreens' proposal raised the ire of many local residents, who said the city didn't need another drugstore and who worried about the impact of the store on Thompson's, the lone independent drugstore in downtown Kent.\n\nWalgreens has been moving toward stand-alone locations with more parking and drive-thru windows since the early 1990's, according to spokeswoman Yvette Venable in Deerfield, Ill.\n\n\"Close-in parking, get in and get out fast,\" she said.\n\nCVS Corp. has 414 stores in Ohio, company spokesman Todd Andrews said. That's about 10 percent of the Rye, N.Y.-based company's stores. He said he could not discuss growth plans.\n\nOne reason for the growth is the aging population. Drugstores nationwide filled 2.8 billion prescriptions last year and expect to fill 4 billion by 2005.\n\nTom McConnell, chief financial officer for the Medina-based Discount Drug Mart, said insurance companies are now more willing to provide coverage for prescription medicines, something that wasn't always the case. The population is also aging, meaning a greater demand for prescription medications.\n\n\"There are new drugs coming out all the time to cure things we never thought of before,\" he said.\n\nMore spacious stores also allow the chains to increase profits by offering more items, said Anne Brumbaugh, an assistant professor of marketing at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nAt Discount Drug Mart, the focus is on the items offered in the \"front end,\" where customers can buy everything from groceries to paint.\n\n\"Our focus is a little bit different,\" McConnell said. \"We're looking for a place where there is a need for a store like ours, where you can get your plumbing supplies, most grocery items, dog food and have one-stop shopping.\"\n\nJames Myers, owner of Thompson's, remembers the days when downtown Kent had five drugstores within the same block. One was a major chain _ Standard Drug _ which later became Revco and then CVS. Another was a regional chain _ Lea's, and the others were independents.\n\n\"We survived, they didn't,\" he said.\n\nIt's the changing insurance requirements that are making it harder for drugstores to survive these days. Insurance providers are paying a small subsidy to pharmacists who fill their prescriptions, or are directing people to mail-order prescription plans.\n\nMeanwhile, chain drugstores have a shortage of pharmacists because of the proliferation of pharmacies in an area and because pharmacists aren't willing to work long hours. Other companies decide not to cover certain medications.\n\nThose factors can make it sometimes more attractive for some independents to close up shop, he said.\n\n\"They aren't making enough money to justify the time they spend in their own store, so they close up and go to work for the big chains and make more money,\" Myers said.\n\nThompson's is now going the route of some of its independent counterparts and has negotiated to become a medicare supplier, since those who supply sick room supplies generally earn a greater subsidy than they do for supplying medicine. Thompson's hasn't seen any profits from that move yet, however.\n\nInsurance regulations also are making it more difficult for customers, who sometimes find their medications aren't covered by their insurance plans, Myers said.\n\n\"We've had people who come in with prescriptions they've been taking on an ongoing basis for years, and suddenly on Jan. 1, the insurance company won't cover it,\" he said. \"So they go back to their doctor and ask him to prescribe an alternative medicine. Maybe they've already tried that medicine.\"\n\nSuch plans dictate what doctors can prescribe for their patients, he said.\n\n\"Suddenly, there's someone else looking over the doctor's shoulder, and it's the insurance company,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell sounds more like an independent pharmacist than the chief financial officer of a drugstore chain when he talks about the threat national chains pose to the smaller players in the drugstore business. That's because the regional is still relatively small, with 44 stores, all in Ohio.\n\nThree more stores, all in Dayton, are expected to open soon, and three in the northern part of the state, including the Kent location, are expected to open by next year.\n\nThe chain is lobbying the legislature to approve \"any willing provider legislation,\" which would stop insurance companies from eliminating the competition in an area by requiring all those insured under their plans to do business at one chain pharmacy.\n\n\"It takes choice away from you,\" he said of such plans. \"You want to have a choice of what pharmacy you deal with. All those choices are in jeopardy if you get shut out by insurance companies.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story."
