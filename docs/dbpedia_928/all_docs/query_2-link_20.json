Morgan Securities Inc. analyst Mark Husson. \"Now it has to get off that slab and start moving again.\"\n\nAccording to senior executives at the 2,100-unit drug chain headquartered here, nothing at Revco will change. They claim that the company will continue to be a strong player in the chain drug industry, striving to meet the needs of consumers in the 14 states in which it operates.\n\n\"Revco remains the second largest drug chain in America,\" president and chief executive officer Dwayne Hoven stated the day after the FTC unanimously voted to try to block the merger on the grounds that it would make Rite Aid too strong and kill competition in the pharmacy business in many areas served by the two companies. \"Since the initial agreement was announced in November Revco has continued to operate as an independent company. Our performance has been among the strongest in the industry, and we're confident that we'll continue to be a strong competitor.\"\n\nAnalysis expect the drug chain to earn around $83 million on $5.2 billion in sales this fiscal year. And, because Revco suspended efforts to build stores and invest in technological systems after Rite Aid made its bid for the company, expenses have been lower than last year while sales have remained strong.\n\n\"All of the qualities that have made Revco great are still intact,\" Hoven continued, \"including our attractive stores, strong distribution network, good vendor relations, state-of-the-art pharmacy computer systems and, most important, our people.\"\n\nWhile the drug chain's ability to withstand the aborted takeover attempt, coupled with its rise out of bankruptcy earlier this decade, clearly shows it can survive even under the toughest circumstances, there are several major challenges that Revco will have to overcome.\n\nDuring the five months of negotiations with Rite Aid, the chain fell behind its rivals in developing its own pharmacy benefits manager.\n\nAnother long-term task facing Revco is clear: grow fast enough and become efficient enough to offset the pressure being put on prescription drug margins.\n\nWith third-party payers rapidly increasing the percentage of pharmacy sales they account for, such large drug chains as Revco are getting a lot of that business. But that has a downside. As the managed care companies pay for more of the prescriptions Revco dispenses, gross margins are being squeezed, falling from a reported 29.6% a year ago to 29.3% now.\n\nA problem could also exist in motivating store-level personnel, many of whom were less than thrilled by the decision last fall to sell the company to Rite Aid for $1.8 billion. The feeling among many of them is that the failure of the takeover only means that another buyer will be sought.\n\n\"We're happy, but we still have to see what happens in the future,\" one employee at headquarters told a local newspaper the day after the FTC decision was made public.\n\nAt the heart of the workers' uncertainty is what such investors as Sam Zell, who holds a 20% stake in Revco, will do. Zell, whose cash infusion helped the drug chain emerge from Chapter 11 as an independent entity in 1992, stood to make $240 million from the Rite Aid deal.\n\nBut after the FTC decided to attempt to block the deal, Zell and Talton Embry, who serve as cochairmen of Revco and are its largest shareholders, indicated that the board wasn't seeking another buyer.\n\n\"Revco will go forward as an independent drug chain under its present management team,\" they noted in a prepared statement after a special directors meeting last month. \"We believe that Revco is a strong, viable drug chain that can continue to be very successful.\"\n\nWith operations in 14 Eastern, Midwestern and Southern states, Revco is indeed a force to be reckoned with. However, because the company had to open its books and reveal confidential operating procedures to Rite Aid, it's closest competitor, some suggest that the chain may have been severely weakened.\n\nBut one thing Revco has in its favor, those same industry analysts say, is that the company was rapidly expanding when the takeover bid occurred. A few days after the announcement that the merger with Rite Aid had fallen through, Hoven announced that Revco was reactivating its growth plans.\n\n\"Despite the delays of the past five months, we'll have opened 138 new and relocated stores during the current fiscal year,\" he remarked. \"Although we've missed out on some real estate development opportunities while enduring the attempted acquisition, we expect to open at least 100 new and relocated stores in our upcoming fiscal year. After fiscal 1997 we expect to be seeking sites for 150 newly built and relocated stores each year.\"\n\nWhile Revco's aggressive expansion strategy may help the chain regain its former luster, many have questioned management's ability to remotivate its work force.\n\nAt least one member of the company's executive team apparently wasn't willing to wait and see how Revco would fare. A few days after the deal with Rite Aid fizzled, executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer James Hagan revealed that he was leaving the drug chain to become senior vice president and chief financial officer of Bruno's Inc., an operator of 255 supermarkets in the Southeast.\n\nHagan asserted that his decision wasn't based on Revco's uncertain future during the five months that Rite Aid was attempting to finalize its takeover of the chain. \"I am quite confident that both the near- and long-term prospects for Revco remain excellent,\" he commented. \"This was an opportunity that presented itself during the five months that Rite Aid attempted to acquire Revco and prior to recent developments here.\"\n\nHoven expects Hagan's departure to be an isolated incident and that the remainder of Revco's executive team will remain intact.\n\nEarlier this month the company's board authorized the repurchase of up to 3 million shares of stock. \"The near- and long-term prospects for the growth and profitability of Revco remain outstanding, and our stock represents excellent value,\" Hoven added.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Revco names Carney a senior VP\n\nTWINSBURG, Ohio - Revco D.S. has promoted vice president and controller Brian Carney to the post of senior vice president of finance and accounting, as well as naming him to its executive committee.\n\n\"Carney has made numerous contributions to the success of the company since he joined us in 1989,\" says president and chief executive officer Dwayne Hoven. \"I am confident that he will excel in his new position, assuming responsibility for not only the controller's office but also managed care accounting and treasury functions.\"\n\nPrior to moving to the drug chain Carney spent seven years with the Cleveland office of Arthur Andersen LLP, where he specialized in retail companies. He became vice president and controller at Revco in 1992.\n\nThe treasury duties Carney will handle were most recently the responsibility of Ware Grove, who resigned as vice president and treasurer to become chief financial officer of Lesco Inc."
