Although part of the improvement was due to erratic factors, such as cheaper oil prices, economists predicted a declining trend in the deficit as the cheaper dollar makes U.S .\n\ngoods more attractive overseas. In the first three months of the year, the deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted $35.95 billion on a balance-of-pay- tute for International Economics. \"The external deficit clearly will be coming down. \"On the other hand, it's got to be kept in mind that the level of the deficit is still unsustainably high,\" he said. While exports and imports both rose to record levels in the first quarter, exports grew faster .\n\nExports rose $6.66 billion, or 9.8 percent, to $74.67 billion, while imports were up $1.41 billion, or 1.3 percent, to $110.62 billion. The country is enjoying an export boom that will continue to grow through the benefits of the cheaper dollar and will continue to shrink the deficit, Bergsten said. \"What this indicates is that the lower exchange rates of the dollar has largely restored America's price competitiveness in the world,\" he said, noting that export growth outpaced import growth by 2-to-l over the past year. Bergsten said Americans must cut their spending, which continues to bring disturbingly high volumes of imports into the country, if the United States is to erase its deficit.

The report presenting the trade figures on a balance-of-payments basis, excluding military sales and the cost of insurance and shipping, was new evidence that the United States is making progress toward reducing its economic imbalances with trading partners. \"I think it is the start of a trend,\" said Fred Bergsten, director of he Insti 1 Exports $74.7 billion Exports $74.7 bill km $25 as n6 i 87 Tae '84 '83 The quarterly merchandise trade balance is adusted lor gold exchange, Canadian trade pacts, U.S. military transfers and seasonal variation.

If successful, his $60 a share takeover would be the most costly in U.S. history, topping even Chevron buyout of Gulf Corp .\n\nfour years ago for $13.3 billion. Icahn, already the company's biggest shareholder, made his offer after talks with Texaco's managers aimed at settling their differences broke off earlier in the day. He now seeks to acquire the 85 percent of the company he does not already own, for about $12.4 billion. Icahn gave the company less than 48 hours to accept or reject the huge offer, setting a deadline of 5 p.m. EDT on Friday .\n\nAnalysts said the short expiration cast doubt on the seriousness of his bid. Texaco said it had ended the talks when Icahn demanded special treatment from the company. Texaco said it could not accommodate Icahn without favoring him over other shareholders, which it suggested would be close to paying greenmail, or hurting the company. It said Icahn had sought a deal in which Texaco would buy proportionately more of his shares, which amount to 14.8 percent of Texaco's common stock, than it would buy from other shareholders in a special share buyback program. Icahn told Reuters that Texaco's comments were \"a complete misstatement of facts.\" In a letter to Texaco, Icahn said he may bring others into his proposed takeover effort .\n\nA number of other investors have bought big blocks of Texaco stock, including buyout specialists Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts. Icahn also said Texaco's board may continue to seek prospective merger partners. Icahn, who built up a major reputation as an astute corporate raider before he became chairman of Trans World Airlines has consistently pushed for a sale of the oil company, claiming that poor management has held back the value of the stock, hurting shareholders. After the talks between Icahn and Texaco broke off, the oil company said it expected to face a proxy fight from Icahn. Icahn said he may drop his proxy fight if the company allows shareholders to consider his offer .\n\nTexaco closed $1 higher Wednesday at $46,875 on the New York Stock Exchange before Icahn announced his offer. In an earlier statement about the break-off in talks, Texaco said it has \"negotiated tirelessly in good faith\" to avoid a fight. Texaco said it \"simply could not structure a transaction that would satisfy Icahn's demands without violating our pledge not to provide consideration that was not available to all our shareholders or threatening Texaco's economic future.\" \"While the various transactions proposed by Icahn may not technically be greenmail, they would in Texaco's view benefit Icahn at the expense of the best interest of the company and its shareholders generally,\" Texaco said.

In 1979, the Elyria-based company had sales of $19 million. By 1990 it expects sales to reach $200 million, Mixon said .\n\nThe company's products are made at plants in Elyria; Orlando, Wales; and Hanover, West Germany.

Shareholders earned 60 cents a share in 1986 but lost 19 cents a share in 1985 .\n\nAccording to the company's proxy statement, Mixon owns 14.8 percent of the company's outstanding stock, or 38,848 shares. Though sales and earnings are improving, Mixon said that because the company is in an expansion mode there won't be any stock dividends for several years. \"We are pouring every nickel we have back into the company,\" Mixon said. \"I would not recommend anybody investing in Invacare with the idea of dividends in ple being cared for at home, a trend that reduces costly hospital stays. \"More medical things are done in the home, and therefore more equipment is needed,\" Mixon said .\n\n\"Congress is learning that it's more effective to treat people at home.\" About 90 percent of Invacare's products are paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or some other government insurance program. Analysts' estimates that 1988's share earnings could nearly double to 80 cents a share from 43 cents a share in 1987 are attainable, said Mixon, who is also the chairman and the company's prices for finished products from rising, could cut into earnings during the year, company officials said. Mixon said after the meeting that he expects sales at Invacare, one of the nation's largest producers of home health-care products such as wheelchairs and home-health beds, to rise between 18 percent and 20 percent this year. Sales should rise to between $155 million and $160 million, compared with $131 million in 1987, he said. The home health-care industry is expected to grow between 8 percent and 9 percent this year, Mixon said .\n\nThis growth is largely attributed to more peo Rising prices for raw materials threaten to tighten Invacare already thin profit margin on its home health-care products this year, President A.

Lyster also said it is still not clear how plant operations will be affected by recent revelations that the plant may contain questionable pipes. Federal regulators have ordered the Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear plants to inspect or replace questionable piping materials that may have been installed at the plants .\n\nThe Perry plant is in North Perry, about 35 miles east of Cleveland, and the Davis-Besse plant is in northwest Ohio, about 30 miles east of Toledo. raised more than $1 billion to finance the highly leveraged buyout of Revco in late 1986.
