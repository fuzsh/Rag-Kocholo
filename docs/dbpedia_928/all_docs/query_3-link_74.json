Was it:\n\n* Dwayne Hoven.\n\n* Sam Zell.\n\n* David Schulte.\n\n* Martin Grass.\n\nIf your answer was Martin Grass, you're correct. Rite Aid Corp.'s chief executive officer conceived and is in the process of engineering what's arguably the most significant merger in chain drug history. The Rite Aid-Revco marriage is the first-ever chain drug merger that's about more than conventional drug stores, more than volume, more than numbers of stores, more than market share. Yet it's about all of those things.\n\nAt the heart of Rite Aid's acquisition of Revco D.S. are such issues and buzzwords as managed care, pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), shrinking pharmacy margins and, grandiose as it sounds, the future of pharmacy in America.\n\nGrass has long been convinced that for Rite Aid to remain a major player in the prescription drug business - and to control its destiny in the managed care environment in which the future of pharmacy will be played out - store density is the key. And despite its industry-leading 2,717 drug stores, Rite Aid until now hasn't had the store density with which to compete for third-party business in an environment dominated by the likes of Merck & Co.'s Medco Containment Services subsidiary or Eli Lilly & Co.'s PCS Health Systems Inc. unit.\n\nSo Grass believes. That belief is at the heart of Rite Aid's bid to acquire Revco.\n\nBy last summer Grass had already become comfortable dealing with other major drug chains on store-related issues. He had sold most of Rite Aid's Florida stores to Eckerd Corp. In separate transactions he withdrew from Massachusetts and Rhode Island, two states with a small Rite Aid presence, by selling his 24 stores in those states to CVS and Jean Coutu Group's Brooks Pharmacy subsidiary, while strengthening the chain's position in Maine by purchasing 18 drug stores and two health and beauty aids outlets from Brooks.\n\nSo it was that Grass arrived at the August National Association of Chain Drug Stores board meeting in Colorado Springs with an open mind and an aggressive agenda, willing to listen to and suggest ways in which Rite Aid's market position might be improved.\n\nRite Aid-Revco: New strength in many markets\n\nState City Market Rank in share market\n\nGeorgia Macon 27% 1 Savannah 53% 1\n\nKentucky Lexington 41% 1 Louisville 18% 3\n\nMaryland Baltimore 30% 1\n\nNew York Poughkeepsie 26% 1 Utica/Rome 23% 2\n\nNorth Carolina Greensboro/ 36% 1 Winston-Salem Hickory 43% 1\n\nOhio Akron 35% 1 Canton/Massillon 41% 1 Cincinnati 27% 1 Cleveland 29% 1 Columbus 33% 1 Dayton/Springfield 41% 1 Hamilton 35% 1 Youngstown/Warren 33% 1\n\nPennsylvania Erie 35% 1 Pittsburgh 27% 2 Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 20% 2\n\nSouth Carolina Charleston 48% 1 Columbia 45% 1 Greenville/Spartanburg 50% 1 Rock Hill 32% 1\n\nTennessee Kingsport 55% 1 Knoxville 38% 1 Nashville 25% 1\n\nVirginia Norfolk/Virginia Beach 42% 1 Richmond/Petersburg 25% 2\n\nWest Virginia Charleston 50% 1 Huntington 32% 1\n\nSource: xxxxxxxx Rite Aid Revco Total\n\nAlabama 5 0 5 Connecticut 48 0 48 Delaware 19 0 19 District of Columbia 23 0 23 Georgia 55 177 232 Illinois 0 70 70 Indiana 32 295 327 Kentucky 117 64 181 Maine 93 0 93 Maryland 179 44 223 Michigan 345 0 345 New Hampshire 39 0 39 New Jersey 187 23 210 New York 319 103 422 North Carolina 109 289 398 Ohio 323 366 689 Pennsylvania 395 107 502 South Carolina 79 183 262 Tennessee 37 120 157 Vermont 11 0 11 Virginia 160 217 377 West Virginia 134 60 194\n\nTOTALS 2,717 2,118 4,835\n\n\"At the NACDS board meeting 1 found a very negative environment,\" he explains, \"to the effect that declining pharmacy margins were destroying the chain drug industry. I understood that this mood was conducive to an acquisition. And in my view, no chain would fit our needs or overlay our markets so completely as would Revco.\"\n\nWhen he returned to Rite Aid's Camp Hill headquarters after the Colorado Springs meeting, Grass immediately phoned David Schulte, a major investor in Revco and a partner in the Zell/Chilmark Fund LP (owner of the largest bloc of Revco stock). Schulte was interested, telling Grass that he would ask Hoven to send him the pertinent financial data immediately. Events moved swiftly from that point, and an agreement was finalized during the last week in November.\n\nGrass expects the transaction to be completed later this month, at which point half of Revco's stock will have been tendered to Rite Aid. He sees few problems with federal or state agencies.\n\nGrass spent a day in mid-December at Revco, coming away with strongly positive feelings about both the retailer and its people. \"There are some capable people at Revco, especially in operations and merchandising,\" he remarks. \"I envision us offering jobs to six or seven Revco officers and many people in middle management.\"\n\nComparing the ways that Revco and Rite Aid operate, Grass believes the former is possibly superior to Rite Aid in such tangibles as merchandise presentation, in-store ambience and promotional flair.\n\n\"We're the more sophisticated operator - especially in such areas as technology,\" he adds. \"Because of that, I believe our pricing policy is more realistic and more cognizant of marketplace realities than is Revco's. Our margins are about 2 points stronger than Revco's, with the result that we make 2 cents more on every dollar of volume than Revco does. But Revco runs exciting drug stores, and we can learn a lot from it.\"\n\nThough his thinking is only now crystallizing, Grass has already made many decisions. Some 300 drug stores will be closed in Rite Aid's major markets across the Midwest and Southeast. Whether the closings will be Revco or Rite Aid outlets will be determined on a case by case basis, with the better real estate winning out. Grass reiterates, however, that the store names will be changed to Rite Aid.\n\nAlso likely to be closed are three or more of the combined 11 distribution centers that the retailer will operate. Here again, Grass has yet to determine which warehouses will be shut, or whether they'll be Revco or Rite Aid facilities.\n\nHowever, the best guess is that some Revco distribution centers will be closed, if only because Grass believes that Rite Aid's technology is superior to Revco's. For this same reason, Revco's point-of-sale and pharmacy computer systems will be replaced by Rite Aid's system.\n\nGrass is viewing the merger on two levels simultaneously. On the more basic level of market penetration, dominance and leadership he thinks that the Revco acquisition will give Rite Aid unprecedented strength in many major Midwestern and Southeastern markets. Viewed as a traditional acquisition, then, the Rite Aid-Revco merger has propelled Rite Aid into one of the very strongest market positions in the history of drug store retailing.\n\nTo solidify that position, Grass has already decided to eschew Revco's reliance on print advertising (it runs 52 tabs a year) in favor of television, with some print support.\n\n\"We have the store density to make television advertising pay,\" explains Grass. \"In fact, it's already paying off for us in the markets in which we've been testing it for the past several months. It's not that we're against tabs: it's that we don't believe we have to run one every week and take the margin hits to accomplish what we want.\"\n\nAtop the traditional market opportunities that the Rite Aid-Revco merger brings are advantages in today's managed care environment.\n\n\"I believe that we now have the coverage and store density in such states as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia and others to compete effectively for third-party pharmacy programs,\" says Grass. \"PBMs simply can't ignore the numbers of stores we can offer their plans - numbers no other retailer can rival.\"\n\nBeyond those thoughts, Grass, an extremely creative and financially astute manager, is letting his mind dwell on the possibilities. \"It's not inconceivable,\" he notes, \"for us to open a satellite computer facility in Twinsburg, like the one we now operate in Baltimore, for the simple reason that we can attract additional capable computer people in a major market like Cleveland. Whether we'll do it or not, I don't know.\"\n\nIndeed, the possibilities, given the acquisition and the logical and fertile mind of Martin Grass, appear endless."
