        "text": "OD GreensSubmitted by Don Tobul\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nOD Greens aims to address two problems:\n\nThere are no workplace training facilities that are operated by other veterans. Transitioning service members will find adaptable and scalable work functions in an environment that is highly structured and veteran-centric!\n\nThe byproduct of our work allows us to provide hyperlocal, hydroponic, pesticide free produce to the surroundings communities.\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nAs a combat veteran, former physics and chemistry teacher, and licensed professional mental health counselor, I am uniquely qualified to assist disabled veterans in their transition by teaching them the skills they need in order to better understand their barriers and limitations.\n\nFurthermore, OD Greens over the past year has demonstrated market viability with the hydroponic produce component. With one full time farmer and a part time farmhand, we have been able to provide 3 high end restaurants with produce and have also sold remaining produce through online sales and at farmers markets. Our produce has been called some of the best around and that it’s freshness is without comparison. Since the produce is hyperlocal, we deliver the day of harvest and minimize transportation costs.\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nThe primary mission of OD Greens is to provide workplace training and mental health services to disabled veterans to assist them in their transition back to civilian life. We use vertical hydroponic farming as platform to support this training. OD Greens has been producing lettuce, herbs, and specialty greens since January 2019, and will look to incorporate the counseling services beginning January 2020.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nAs a combat veteran, vocational rehabilitation counselor, and mental health counselor, my education and work experience place me in a position to serve the veteran population and effectively build rapport to further assist in their transition.\n\nWhile my areas of expertise is in counseling and the sciences I have no experience in running a business. I have worked with SCORE to assist me in filling these gaps and have 3 mentors presently. Their help has been invaluable to this point.\n\nIn order to continue moving forward to incorporate the workplace training and counseling services, I will need assistance with locating a facility, assistance with basic business finance, and help building social media and web presence.\n\nUndercover AcroSubmitted by Kimmi Schonhorst\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nSexual violence. One in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college. Educational programs have not been successful, and one reason is because educational programs do not provide opportunities to put the theories into practice.\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nI plan to teach Acro and Consent workshops to not only educate, but also practice communication skills around consent. Acro (AKA partner acrobatics or acro yoga) is a very physical sport that requires trust and communication between partners. My students will practice: asking for permission before touching someone, stating their own boundaries, listening to other people's boundaries, hearing and responding to \"no\" appropriately, and realizing that no one is entitled to any physical act that involves another person's body (sexual or not).\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nI have taught one pro-bono Acro and Consent class to a group of 11 8th graders. It went over really well with them, although they were the perfect candidates bc they have already received a lot of diversity training. The challenges I am facing include building credibility as a consent workshop and making connections with schools. This weekend I hope to figure out different business/funding models - creative ways to make this a sustainable venture.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nI have a background in sexual violence prevention (worked in the women's resource center throughout college), but could always use more help in this arena. I also am a certified Acro and Social Justice instructor. I have experience working with youth (I was a camp counselor for a couple years). I am an alumni of an entrepreneurship fellowship program called Venture for America. I could use help with the business/finance side and with building a website.\n\nCorredorSubmitted by Karishma Bali\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nSafety, quality, and pedestrian traffic for international runners\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nProviding a trustworthy network of global runners\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nBeta/prototype slide deck of mobile application\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\n“As a woman in her twenties, I have most definitely caught the running bug. Having run two marathons, I long to complete 26 marathons in my lifetime. 2018 was a busy year, and I was unsure if I would be able to run my third race this past year. After temporarily relocating to Spain, I made it a priority in my schedule to train for race number three before the year ended. Initially, training was very difficult. I would have to stop frequently because I would get caught in pedestrian traffic in Barcelona. Frustrated, I did not have a reliable platform to know where or what times were best to schedule my runs. As a woman new to a city, I was also reluctant to venture off into new trails or pathways because of safety concerns. Being familiar with the running world, I knew there is a large community out there and I wondered what I could do to help and create such a platform. With that, the innovation of the mobile application Corredor was inspired.”\n\nVOLSubmitted by Cameron Tolbert\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nLoving, caring, and dedicated people volunteer, and across Cleveland this year more than 100,000 individuals will choose to spend their time helping their neighbors. This is wonderful, but this community of volunteers is dispersed and the result is that the impact that community of volunteers will have is a fraction of its potential.\n\nWhat if we unlock that potential? What if we built a platform that supported our cities social heros? What if we made a social network of dedicated volunteers that spanned across the county? What if we allowed nonprofits to tap into this network and find specific volunteers with skill sets they are looking to recruit?\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nMade for adults and retirees. VOL is an app meant to provide a dedicated platform for volunteers to form communities, manage their volunteer experiences, and engage with nonprofit organizations based on their interests and availability.\n\nAs a company, we are a team of dedicated individuals supporting the operations of nonprofits, and improving citywide volunteerism rates with strong advertising and marketing campaigns. We believe whole-heartedly in the power of community and work to uphold the values of personal privacy, ethics, diversity, and patriotism.\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nI have spoken to a few non-profit organizations, placed at two school-wide competitions, and created a very rough wire-frame.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nMy talents are split between a relentless passion to rethink voluntarism, and a deep-seated desire to learn and adapt. I have a drive to hustle and the conscientiousness to persist, and the wisdom to pivot intelligently.\n\nI do not pretend to know what I do not, but I will learn. At the moment, I require help in: Software Development, Human Resourcing, UI design, Market Research, Monetization Strategy, Financial Management, and Legal Advising.\n\nA Co-founder would be nice, but I want to build a company of like-minded people who discover and pursue issues that change the way we live, and so any Co-founder would need to understand this venture is a long-haul that requires risk and risk management.\n\nSmart, Adaptive Room LightingSubmitted by Colb Uhlemann\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association's \"State of the Air\" report, Cleveland has the ninth worst air quality of any city in the nation. Among the causes for this poor standing is ozone produced by coal-burning power plants. Steps to reduce energy usage will reduce demand for electricity and slow the production of polluting compounds.\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nOur project is a lighting system which maintains a desired brightness in a room using a hybrid of natural and overhead lighting. At points in the day when plenty of sunlight enters through the windows, the lights inside would compensate by dimming to the appropriate level. Conversely, the interior lights would remain on at the desired brightness during times of less sun.\n\nOur solution would be retrofittable; that is, it would be compatible with current electrical systems in buildings. This keeps installation costs lower and makes the system available to a wider market.\n\nThe lighting system has a couple other noteworthy features. Its \"smart\" capability facilitates remote control via WiFi from anywhere in the world, allowing users to toggle the lights at any time. We also hope to implement a predictive model which learns from the user's habits and manages the lights on its own throughout the day. Lastly, the system would have a digital statistics readout summarizing energy usage and savings over a period.\n\nWhile our solution won't cut air pollution down overnight, it is uniquely positioned to chip away at the issue over time. Any user that opts into the system will be, day in and day out, contributing to the larger goal of reducing popular usage over time. In the end, our solution eliminates the redundancy between different sources and optimizes a common activity for energy conservation.\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nMy team and I are students at Case Western Reserve University, and we recently developed this idea at the 12-hour CWRU WelcomeBackHack last Saturday (9/7). The project won Best in Presentation, Best in Making, and Best in Social Impact at the hackathon. This idea is still in its early stages, and, while we experienced many small successes and setbacks in the creation of our prototype, our next step is to deepen our understanding of its mission, impact, and technical requirements. That is, refine our project and iterate on past progress.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nMy team currently consists of Jun Park, Nate Labrie, and myself. Allow me to briefly introduce everyone.\n\nJun is a first-year computer engineering student. He has experience with several programming languages, including Angular, Java, Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL. To date, he has handled the web interface portion of the project.\n\nNate is a second-year mechanical engineering student. He specializes in modeling and making but also has experience with robotics and rocketry. Being a fairly hands-on guy, he has been responsible for the design and fabrication of our model.\n\nI, Colb, am a second-year electrical engineering student. I have project experience in several fields of tinkering, but my main interest is hardware. I've been handling the electronics for the project, including microcontroller programming, wiring, testing, and soldering. I can program in Arduino, Java, and Python, and I have lots of expertise in 3D design and printing.\n\nBeyond the three of us, we could benefit from an IoT expert and monetization strategist. While we were able to put together a prototype for the hackathon, we have much to learn about common practice in developing our product. Also, our group generally lacks entrepreneurial experience and would need guidance creating a business model.\n\nParents in MotionSubmitted by Chanel Williams\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nAffordable and safe transportation for children and low income families.\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nThis idea will solve the need for low income families for safe, affordable rides. What is unique about this solution is that it will work on a 2 for 1 ratio system, that will enable families to use more rides than they use.\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nWe are generating revenue and picking up steam, demand is growing.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nI am uniquely in this position to solve this problem because I came from low income/blue collar with transportation needs. I saw first hand the difference maker it was to be able to take advantage of extracurricular activities and opportunities. I still see this with non-profits like Tech Corp, that teach basic computer science to at-risk, those kids face many challenges just to be able to get the opportunity to learn a skill not readily available, in an environment that will enrich them academically and later, professionally. The skill that I bring to the table are tech skills and I am very passionate about taking those barriers out of the equation.\n\nWhat I need to make this happen are other tech people, designers, and people REALLY into user experience. People with connections to housing authorities or community interests that need transportation help. And we would to speak with someone in the transportation space.\n\nWhat is needed to make this happen is an online presence to gather information.\n\nPositive Transitioning AppSubmitted by Lakia Goodman\n\nWhat is the problem are you solving?\n\nWe are working to solve the recidivism rate in the United States and to bring our communities together.\n\nHow will this idea solve the problem?\n\nThis idea solves the problem by providing 24/7 resources and support to individuals returning to our communities. We will work with other nonprofit organizations as a support when their doors may not be open for service.\n\nIs this idea brand new or has it been partially-vetted?\n\nPartially-vetted\n\nHow you have vetted your idea and the success or difficulties you have seen thus far?\n\nOur app is already launched on the Google Play store under Positive Transitioning. We intend to continually launch with new and updated services, such as real time shelter bed availability, real time risk and needs assessments for life coaches, parole officers and others, just to name a few. One of our difficulties is marketing the app and bringing in users. We have recently relaunched a new version of the app.\n\nWhy are YOU uniquely positioned to solve the problem? What other people do you need to help?\n\nCurrently we have a co-founder with a background in forensic psychology that develops the programs for the organization. We have a Cpa that manages the business part of the organization and social media. Our third co-founder is a millennial graduating with a criminal justice degree.\n\nThe additional expertise we could use are in marketing, AI technology and volunteer management. We currently also have a wide range of volunteers that help in all aspects of the business. Our nonprofit is web-based so it allows for individuals all over the world to volunteer and help support."
