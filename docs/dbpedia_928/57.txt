Revco D.S. Inc., operator of the nation's largest drugstore chain, said yesterday that its board had received an offer from a group of senior executives to acquire the company for $33 a share in cash and shares of preferred stock that it valued at an additional $3 a share, or a total of $1.161 billion.

It is the second-largest leveraged buyout offer ever in the drugstore industry. The largest was a $1.184 billion bid in October by the Jack Eckerd Corporation, which operates Eckerd Drug Stores, to go private. That deal is pending.

Yesterday's announcement was made after Revco's stock closed at $32.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 75 cents.

Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, said its board had set up a committee of independent directors to evaluate the proposal. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Golenberg & Company of Cleveland are acting as financial advisers to the investment group. 'A Highly Confident Letter'

Glenn Golenberg, the chairman of the Cleveland firm, said, ''We have a commitment letter from a lead bank and Salomon Brothers presented a highly confident letter to the board.'' He declined to provide further details of the financing.

Revco said the leaders of the management group were Sidney Dworkin, Revco's chairman and chief executive, and R. Carroll Hudson, the company's chief financial officer. Mr. Golenberg said that ''several institutional investors'' were involved in the offer and that the lead investor group, in conjunction with management, would be the Transcontinental Services Group N.V., a investment holding company based in London whose chairman is Nathaniel de Rothschild.
