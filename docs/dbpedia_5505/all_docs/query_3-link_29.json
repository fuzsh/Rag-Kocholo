        "text": "If you find yourself traveling through northeastern Pennsylvania, you might want to add Nescopeck State Park to your travel route.\n\nIt’s a day-use facility in Luzerne County that’s a great place to take a short walk or relax by the lake.\n\nI spent Saturday morning at the park while participating in an ice fishing program conducted by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.\n\nLake Frances has nine acres of warm water fish like bluegill and perch, and the fish commission stocks it with trout. Six miles of Nescopeck Creek are designated as a high-quality, cold-water fishery and contains brown trout and native brook trout. Several miles of the creek are designated as delayed harvest, artificial-lure only.\n\nUnusual deer: Unusual deer, fox find home in northeastern Pennsylvania\n\n“I like that it’s kind of quiet, but it’s still close to urban areas. It feels remote,” Megan Fedor, environmental education specialist, said about the park that’s close to Hazleton and Wilkes Barre. “People can come out for their lunch breaks and enjoy a quiet moment,” she said.\n\nThe 3,550-acre park has wetlands, forests and a variety of habitat between Mount Yeager and Nescopeck Mountain. The park is open throughout the year and you can go cross country skiing on the trails. The park points out the trails are not groomed but are relatively flat or have slight grades, making them a great way to explore the park during winter.\n\n“It’s a great place to visit in all seasons,” she said. If there’s at least six inches of snow, you can borrow snowshoes from their office for use on the trail.\n\nLandscapers take notice: Pennsylvania decided to ban three invasive plants\n\nChris Wolf and his son, Kevin, 11, of White Haven, Luzerne County were ice fishing on Lake Frances. “If you catch something, you don’t know what it is until you get it out of the hole,” Kevin said about why he likes ice fishing.\n\n“The rangers do a great job. They always treated our family beautifully,” Chris said about his family’s many adventures to the park.\n\nHiking and hunting\n\nDuring the pandemic, Kevin Wolf said, he spent a lot time walking the trails. “Every day was a hike,” Chris said.\n\nKevin recommends the Farmstead Trail. \"There’s some old machinery on it,” he said about it being a farm at one time.\n\n“It’s beautiful,” Chris Wolf said. “We like getting outdoors and spending time with family.”\n\nThe park has a variety of 15 trails that are relatively short jaunts ranging from 3/4 of a mile to three miles long.\n\nYour next adventure starts here: Step up your gear, plan your next outdoor trip at the NRA Great American Outdoor Show\n\nAlong the trails you can see unusual wildlife. “Folks have spotted bobcats, and otters and you’ll never know when a bear will pop up,” Fedor said. The park reports it is good place to birdwatch as about 170 species of birds have been documented there.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to hunt, the park has land set aside for those looking for deer, turkey, black bear and small game animals like rabbits, squirrels and woodcocks.\n\nThe park also holds a variety of programs through the Raphael J. Musto Visitors and Environmental Education Center and Park Office. The building opened in 2004 and has natural history exhibits, restrooms and a classroom.\n\n\"There’s lots of great things to do at the park,” Fedor concluded.\n\nContact Us\n\n1137 Honey Hole Road\n\nDrums, PA 18222\n\nPhone: 570-403-2006\n\nnescopecksp@pa.gov\n\nBrian Whipkey is the outdoors columnist for USA TODAY Network sites in Pennsylvania.
