Musto (The Citizens' Voice photo)\n\nWILKES-BARRE, Pa. â€” A federal judge has ruled that an ailing former northeastern Pennsylvania senator in prison on corruption charges can return home for an examination by his own doctors.\n\nAttorneys for 85-year-old Raphael Musto say he has cancer and may have as little as two months to live.\n\nA federal judge on Friday approved his lawyers' request that he be released from a federal medical prison in North Carolina, where he was sent in January after being declared mentally unfit to stand trial.\n\nWhile there, he was diagnosed with advanced-stage lymph cell cancer.\n\nMusto is in custody on charges he accepted cash and other perks for helping obtain taxpayer money for development projects, and took additional cash for helping a municipality get state loans."
