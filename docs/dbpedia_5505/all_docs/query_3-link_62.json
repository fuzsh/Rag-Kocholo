        "text": "It's been a year since I graduated from Harvard Business School. Time really flies and waits for no one. Over this year, I have had time to reflect, and below are three lessons that I have learned or that have resurfaced post-HBS: 1. Do not let graduating from business school be your peak; the name of your business school will only get you so far. Post-MBA, you must tap into the same grit and fervor that got you into B-school and apply it to your new role, business venture, or endeavor. 2. You went to business school to network, so use it. A wise person once said, \"If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.\" If you need something, reach out to that highly accomplished, expensive network that you built while you were in school. 3. You will be an alumnus/alumna longer than you were a student. You are a student for two years and an alum for the rest of your life. Join alumni networks, as they can be instrumental in helping you build community, transition into a new role, and find mentors. Congratulations to all the graduates, especially the African American Student Union at Harvard Business School grads! üì∑ cred: Quadir Wilson #HarvardBusinessSchool #HBS #MBA #Bschool #Graduation #Grad #Alumni\n\nMission Statements, Mottos, Values & your MBA Application (some tips on school research) If you've poked around the #MBA admissions world for any amount of time, you've probably heard of Stanford #GSB and their famous motto: ‚ÄúChange lives, change organizations, change the world.‚Äù And you probably know that they do indeed seek applicants who have the stuff needed to create such change. Which means, throughout your #application you'd want to share some authentic moments from your life that imply you have and can change the world. All #Bschools have missions, mottos or values, and it is worth getting to know them as you do your school research. Anyone who knows me, knows I am \"loco\" for Duke #Fuqua and Dean Bill Boulding and the school's focus on decency (DQ or the \"decency quotient\") - want to know more about Duke's values, read \"Living our Values\" on Fuqua's \"about\" page. Here are some excerpts from other top programs and their missions: #MITSloan - to develop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world & to generate ideas that advance management practice (plus their mens et manus philosophy) #IESE - to develop leaders who strive to have a deep, positive and lasting impact on people, companies and society through professional excellence, integrity & spirit of service. #Tuck - We will develop wise, decisive leaders with global perspectives who will transform organizations & change the world. #CBS - Educating and developing leaders and builders of enterprises who create value for their stakeholders and society at large. (Which you can see big-time in their recent doubling-down on climate and tech initiatives). #INSEAD - to bring together people, cultures and ideas to develop responsible leaders who transform business and society. (also note their recent curriculum overhaul to embed sustainability) #Kellogg - to educate, equip and inspire leaders who build strong organizations and wisely leverage the power of markets to create lasting value. (plus note their LOR Question 1 which talks about how it \"values students who are inclusive and encouraging of others with differing perspectives and backgrounds\" and asks recommenders to share an example) And so much more that schools tout as values: #NYUStern and their \"EQ+IQ\" focus #ChicagoBooth and the famous \"Chicago Approach\" + their \"Pay it forward\" culture So, as you are doing your school research for your MBA #applications, look at the school's values and think about how they mesh with your own + identify ways to express those in your essays. My mission is to take the mystery, and misery, out of the MBA admissions process. Hope this little post does a bit of that. In values, Candy #allme #noAI #writingisstillcool #mbaadmissionsconsultant #AIGAC"
