In addition to her husband and parents, Betty was recently predeceased by her loving daughter, Susan Cirella. Betty loved all children and animals. They were drawn to her, and she to them. She had a special ability to relate to them and interact with them, an ability she retained throughout her life. She always gave her grandchildren and great-grandchildren her undivided attention and devotion. Betty was multi-talented and enjoyed gardening, sewing, knitting, crocheting and entertaining. Family and friends were often recipients of her many, perfectly finished projects. At Lord Chamberlain, Betty especially enjoyed attending church services and the many recreation programs. The family would like to thank all the caregivers and staff who took care of her at Lord Chamberlain. In lieu of flower, please make memorial contributions to a charity of your choice. Due to the current pandemic situation the family has elected to have a private family service. The Adzima Funeral Home-Stratford has been entrusted with the funeral arrangements.

Berni, home to heaven at the age of 67 after a courageous battle with the COVID-19. Silvio was born in Italy to Bruno and Teresina Berni. He was a dedicated family man and leaves behind his wife, Cathy, and their children; Erin, Michael, Teresina and Faith and is also survived by his son-in-law, Jason, two grandsons, Bradley and Beckett as well as his sister, Maria, and her daughter, Katerina. Silvio had a large family that included many in-laws, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins around the world and he loved keeping in contact with and visiting so many of them.\n\nEven though he would tell you that he was “just an accountant”, he was the Vice President of Corporate Development and Controller at GGCP, Inc. in Greenwich. Silvio was known among those who loved him for his generous and compassionate nature. He was always willing to help everyone, however they needed it. He was an active member at Christ the Redeemer Church and the Knights of Columbus. Throughout his life and career, he loved interacting with family, colleagues, friends and strangers. He could have a long conversation with anyone, and often did! He had many lifelong friends he kept in touch with until the very end.\n\nSilvio’s eventual final resting place will be in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, NY, so he can be with his parents and nephew, Alex. Due to the current climate, a celebration of his life will happen when it is deemed appropriate. A mass was offered for him by the Gabelli Family at Fordham University on April 20th and can be viewed online. In lieu of everything being offered, please consider making a donation in his name to any of the following organizations whose work Silvio admired: The Beth-el Shelter, the Woodruff Family YMCA, the Connecticut Food Bank or the Boys and Girls Village in Milford.\n\nBerrien, Allen Groves\n\nA lifelong Milford resident, Allen Graves Berrien was born on December 27, 1932 to C. Gordon Berrien and Helen G. Berrien and died on April 13, 2020. It is so fitting that he passed on a stormy weather day. Few things brought him more joy than a good storm, it was almost as though he arranged it.\n\nHe is survived by his brothers: David N. (Judy) Berrien of Tallahasee, FL and Peter L. (Judy) Berrien of Dennis, MA; by his children: Allen D. Berrien of Falls Village, Nancy (Stephen) Bennett, of Milford, Laurel (William) VanWilgen of Branford, and Leigh Bak of Milford; his grandchildren: Andrew Bodick, Katharine Mix, Stephen Bak, Emily Bak, Kate Briggs, Elizabeth Berrien, Heather Berrien, and Douglas Berrien; and by Florence Berrien, his former wife, mother of his children, high school sweetheart, and lifelong friend.\n\nAllen graduated from Milford High School in 1950 and served in the US Navy from 1951 – 1955. Upon his discharge from the Navy, he worked at Pratt and Whitney while attending Quinnipiac College where he obtained his Associates Degree.\n\nHe was the owner and operator of Milford Boat Works which was founded by his father in 1946. Allen may not have been the founder, but he and Flo, together with his longtime business partner Barry Peale, grew the boatyard into the amazing facility it is today. Until the day he died, one of his favorite things to talk about was what was going on at the boatyard. If we were doing something wrong, he’d let us know.\n\nHe was a consummate boat handler. At first, it seemed to be just bravado but it turned out he was just so darned confident and skilled. He did scare the you-know-what out of his family many times with said bravado.\n\nHis sailing skills earned him many awards throughout Long Island Sound and beyond. Many Berrien dogs got to drink from the abundance of silver-plated trophies that he collected over the years. He got a big kick out of that…dogs drinking out of silver-plate and kids drinking out of jelly jars.\n\nSea Scout Ship 25 was formed in his living room nearly 60 years ago. From that time until it was disbanded about ten years ago, it provided many young men and women with an education about being on the water, sailing and adventure. Allen remained in touch with many of the original Sea Scouts.\n\nAllen served for many years as a volunteer firefighter in the City of Milford, ultimately serving as Captain of Arctic Engine Company Number 1. Flo and his children all remember the sound of the Plectron going off in the middle of the night, and Dad racing off to a fire. We all super-enjoyed that magnetic blue light he stuck on the roof of the car, especially when he let us go to a fire with him. How he ever had the energy to get up and go to work the next morning still puzzles us.\n\nHe was an early board member who volunteered tirelessly for Connecticut Marine Trades Association in its infancy. He was very proud of his work with the marine trades, especially in establishing a boat show and in lobbying for legislation about anything involving the water. He co-founded CHUM (Concerned Harbor Users of Milford) with his dear friends Al Hotchkiss and Ken Neff. Together they brought many issues important to the vitality and environment of Milford Harbor into the eyes of the public.\n\nHe served as Harbormaster in Milford, served on the Harbor Commission for many years and worked hard to form Milford’s Harbor Management Plan, the first of its kind in the State of Connecticut. He was instrumental in the planning and building of Milford’s Lisman Landing Marina, the public marina in Milford. When he got frustrated by the slow-moving wheels of planning for the marina, he engaged a local architect and just paid for the plans. Allen just believed in getting things done.\n\nHe was an active and devoted member of Mary Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church and served on numerous committees there including the Board of Trustees and was instrumental in forming the Foundation for the church. Ironically, he wasn’t born a Methodist; he was raised a Congregationalist. Every Sunday morning, his Mom would clean him up and send him off to Sunday School at the “Big White Church”. Until he came home with a perfect attendance award from the Methodist church, she was none the wiser. It turned out the Methodist church was a shorter walk. Bingo!\n\nHe never met a restaurant that he didn’t feel deserved his utmost devotion and attention. When dementia forced his move to assisted living, we found the Styrofoam packing still in his oven… ten years after it was installed. He struggled with how to leave a proper tip and was generous to a fault. Since Mom always did the math when they were married, Dad just thought it best to round up. If the bill was $21, he’d round it up to $40! Quite a few happy servers out there!\n\nHe served on so many committees and boards that it’s really hard to remember them all. I think what we’d like to remember is that if he believed in something, he would work to make it happen. What more to share about Allen? He was a voracious reader, an unbridled sharer of opinions, a devotee of corny jokes, loved gardening and trees, and was as hard a worker as was ever born. He was a tough employer but always fair. He loved all dogs and shared a special bond with his own dogs throughout his lifetime. Additionally, the man just plain loved to drive. Not your typical Sunday afternoon drive mind you. Proof? When he volunteered with the International Executive Service Corps, he drove to Guatemala, not once but twice.\n\nAll of these things made Allen an amazing man and a memorable character. It would be wrong to ignore the fact that when you added dementia to his strong personality traits, the outcome was “challenging.” This made his later years difficult for his family, friends, and caregivers (and downright torture for him as his independence slipped away). To that end, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the amazing care provided to him by Shana Hylton, which allowed him to remain in his beautiful home for as long as possible. Special thanks to Dean Swanson of Woodbury, former operator of Hill’s Service Station at the corner of Lafayette and Broad. We lovingly referred to his tenure “visiting” at Dean’s as “adult daycare.” Dean is truly as good a friend as can be had.\n\nThanks as well to the amazing staff at Wesley Village who provided care and comfort to Dad and finally to Dr. Susan Kashaf of the West Haven VA Hospital. Words cannot describe how special she was to Allen, she “got” him, and that wasn’t always easy.\n\nIf you feel the need to honor Allen in some way, please do something nice for someone. If you’re reading this, you probably already do nice things, just do something even nicer.\n\nCody-White Funeral Home in Milford is assisting the family with arrangements and there will be no services at this time. The family will plan an event in the future where we hope more “colorful” stories about him can be shared. To leave online condolences, please visit www.codywhitefuneralservice.com.\n\nBetso, Gus A. II\n\nGus A. Betso II, age 38, of Milford, passed away suddenly on April 18, 2020. Gus was born in Bridgeport on October 12, 1981, beloved son of Gus Sr. and Bertha (Otero) Betso.

Gonzalez), three sisters, Trina (Betso) Kanuch and her husband Bob (their children, Isabel, Olivia and Mackenzie Kanuch), Ashleigh Betso and her fiancé, Scott Melchionno, and Madelynn Betso, along with several aunts, uncles, and cousins. He was a 2000 graduate of Kolbe Cathedral High School and an avid New York Giants fan who spent his spare time with his many friends and family members working on cars, watching movies or listening to music. Gus had been an employee of the city of Bridgeport maintaining the grounds and machines at The Fairchild Wheeler Golf Course and a long-term affiliate with the Vazzy’s restaurant chain working as a chef in several locations. He was a big guy with a huge heart who was loved by all who knew him, he had a fun-loving nature that will be missed by too many people to count. Due to the current pandemic situation the family has elected to have services at a later date and a memorial service to celebrate Gus’s life will be announced at a later time. The Adzima Funeral Home-Stratford has been entrusted with the funeral arrangements.

Biancur passed away peacefully on April 15 at Quinnipiac Valley Health Center, Wallingford, CT. Irma was born on August 13 in San Lorenzo in Campo, Le Marche, Italy, daughter of Alfredo and Santina (Torcellini) Cappelloni. When Irma’s family arrived they made their home on Portsea Street in New Haven where she met Ben, her future husband. They became friends in elementary school and attended Commercial High School together. Irma excelled in many things including stenography and athletics. Before working as a stenographer at the Amtrak Diesel Shop in New Haven she completed necessary coursework at Quinnipiac College. Irma was happiest in her kitchen while Ben tended their vegetable garden. We treasure our memories at her dinner table enjoying her specialties such as lasagne and potato salad and sour cream coffee cake. It’s easy to imagine her at the kitchen sink lost in her preparations, humming her favorite Ella FitzGerald and Bobby Darin tunes.\n\nIrma kept herself informed by reading the New Haven Register each evening while she and Ben sat side by side in their chairs. She rarely missed an episode of Jeopardy, her favorite t.v. show. She lived in the same house for the last fifty years of her life with Ben until his death in 2012.\n\nIrma leaves behind three children: Robert (Geraldine) Biancur, Janet (Ralph) Veenema, and Lorraine (Anthony) Gioco. She also leaves six grandchildren: Douglas Biancur, Patrick Biancur, Kristin (Dan) Stryker, Ralph (Erin) Veenema, Derek Veenema and Anthony B. Gioco. She also leaves two great-grandsons. Irma also leaves one sister, Celeste (John) Stocking, and was predeceased by three sisters: Lina (Primo) Baldaserini, Amelia (Giuseppe) Silvestrini, Alda (Vasinto) Carboni as well as many nieces and nephews. I would only want her to know how much we all loved her and how our lives will change without her now.\n\nOur most sincere gratitude to the nurses and staff at Quinnipiac Valley Health Center, Wallingford, CT, for their care, affection and guidance during this difficult time. Irma will be interred next to Ben at Saint Lawrence Cemetery, New Haven, CT, and a memorial to celebrate her life will be held when these unstable times allow. The Celentano Funeral Home, 424 Elm St. New Haven is in charge of arrangements.\n\nDeAndrade, Robert\n\nRobert DeAndrade, also known as “Gator” to his friends, passed away Wednesday, April 15, 2020. In life, Gator was proud to wear his club colors and loved riding his Harley. Robert was the oldest of three children and was predeceased by his parents Manuel and Hilda DeAndrade, as well as the love of his life, Laura (Zemel) DeAndrade. His younger brother, Daniel DeAndrade, and sister, Annie (DeAndrade) Kleynowski and her husband Leo, still live in Milford, the town they all grew up in. Robert had one child, Robert Mishler, who grew up in the same house in Milford as his father. Robert was also a very proud uncle to Amy Lee, Eric Kleynowski and his wife, Erika, and Michelle Kleynowski. The last edition to Robert’s legacy was his two grandchildren Megan and Kayla. It would be impossible to list all of the club brothers that Robert loved and was loyal to, but there was no stronger bond than he has with his club brother, Jack Baltas. If there is something that stood out about Gator, it would be his loyalty to his club brothers and his strong bonds with his family. He will be missed; RIP.\n\nDeLeo, Craig Frank\n\nLelas, Susan Ann\n\nSusan Ann Lelas, 64, of Milford, unexpectedly passed away on April 7, 2020.

Pacheco-Montagnino passed peacefully from this earth at 99.5 years of age in Milford, CT.\n\nShe was escorted into heaven by her younger brother, Dominick DiNino, who passed away on the same date one year earlier, at almost the exact same time.\n\nJohn Pacheco SR and her second husband, Joseph Montagnino, as well as an extended group of family and friends, were certainly there to celebrate her arrival.\n\nBorn on November 22, 1920, in Abruzzi, Italy, Bianca endured the painful loss of her mother at the age of 5. She remained in Italy with her maternal grandmother until age 17, at which time she ventured across the Atlantic Ocean to join her father, John DiNino, who had previously migrated to America.\n\nIn the course of her life, Bianca grew to become a strong, independent woman who loved music, dancing and people. But, her true passion and talent was found in the kitchen, as an Italian gourmet chef. After marrying John Pacheco Sr., she happily settled into married life and enjoyed entertaining large groups of family and friends with her exceptional, home-made Italian foods and deserts. This talent also compelled her to write a cook book, with her own unique recipes, later in life.\n\nNeedless to say, Bianca was also devoted to her two sons, John and Joseph. After the untimely passing of her husband in 1967, she focused on raising her boys with hard work and unwavering determination, insisting upon high grades, college attendance, graduation and business success.\n\nShe eventually remarried and embraced the opportunity travel the world with her second husband, Joseph Montagnino, of Stratford, CT. Joe was a remarkable administrator and, upon his retirement from General Electric, took it upon himself to organize and lead over 50 tour groups to exciting locations all around the globe.\n\nAccording to the nurses and health care attendants who cared for Bianca in her later years at the Carriage Green at Milford Senior Living Center, she continued to be a dominant, liberating force among her peers and was the catalyst for many fun activities and excursions.\n\nIn retrospect, it is amazing to reflect upon the scope of the social and scientific advancements that took place in the USA, from 1920 to 2020, during Bianca’s journey on earth. From transportation on horse-back to the introduction of cars, trucks and airplanes; from the use of gas lighting to the implementation of electricity into cities and homes nation-wide; from receiving news, entertainment and communication via radio, movie screens and rotary telephones, to the technoligical evolution of television, computers, PCs and cell phones; not to mention the NASA Moon Landing and space travel, Bianca experienced a journey that was full of on-going change and exponential social development that few people witness in one life-time!\n\nBianca was predeceased by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John DiNino, husband John Pacheco Sr., step-mother Mary DiNino, brother Dominic DiNino, sister Angie Voss, grandson Christopher Tweeton and several nieces and nephews.\n\nShe is survived by her son John Pacheco II, wife Angela; son Joseph Pacheco, Edward Montagnino, wife Evelyn and Ginger Montagnino.\n\nExtended family members include: Grandchildren Caroline Pricher, ESQ., Timothy Tweeton, Joshua Pacheco and Adam Pacheco. Nieces, nephews and cousins include: Joan DiNino-Buchanan, Karen Madej, Patricia Scalia, Susan Voss, Eva Voss, Rob Voss, Dillan Voss, Ryan Buchanan, Brandon Buchanan and Barbara Dahlgren.\n\nHowever, because of the travel restrictions and social gathering guidelines imposed to address the national COVID-19 pandemic, no public memorial service can be held.\n\nAt this challenging time, your thoughts and prayers for Bianca and her beloved Italy, as well as the United States of America, are requested. Arrangements are under the direction of Thomas M. Gallagher Funeral Home (203)-359-9999.
