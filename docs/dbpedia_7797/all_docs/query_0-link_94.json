        "text": "One of my goals when launching this blog in 2011 was to revive interest in the important, but unfortunately neglected and largely forgotten, contributions to monetary and macroeconomic theory of Ralph Hawtrey. Two important books published within the last year have focused attention on Ralph Hawtrey: The Federal Reserve: A New History by Robert Hetzel, and The Capital Order by Clara Elizabeth Mattei.\n\nWhile Hetzel’s discussion of Hawtrey’s monetary theory of the Great Depression is generally positive, it criticizes him for discounting, unlike Milton Friedman, the efficacy of open-market operations in reviving aggregate demand. But Hetzel’s criticism relies on an incomplete reading of Hawtrey’s discussions of open-market operations. Mattei’s criticism of Hawtrey is very different from Hetzel’s narrow technical criticism. Mattei is clearly deeply hostile to Hawtrey, portraying him as the grey eminence behind the austerity policies of the British Treasury and the Bank of England in the 1920s both before and after Britain restored the prewar gold standard. Mattei holds Hawtrey uniquely responsible for providing the intellectual rationale for the fiscal and monetary policies that ruthlessly tolerated high unemployment to suppress inflation and hold down wages.\n\nI’ll address the inaccuracies in Hetzel’s discussion of Hawtrey and especially in Mattei’s deeply flawed misrepresentations of Hawtrey in future posts. In this post, I provide an overview of Hawtrey’s career drawn from papers I’ve written (two of which were co-authored by my friend Ron Batchelder) about Hawtrey included in my recent book, Studies in the History of Monetary Theory: Controversies and Clarifications (Chapters 10-14)\n\nRalph George Hawtrey, born in 1879, two years before his friend, fellow Cambridge man and Apostle, John Maynard Keynes, with whom he often disagreed, was in the 1920s and early 1930s almost as well-known as, and perhaps even more influential, at least among economists and policy-makers, than Keynes. Despite their Cambridge educations and careers in economics, as undergraduates, they both concentrated on mathematics[1] and philosophy and were deeply influenced by the Cambridge philosopher, G. E. Moore. Neither formally studied economics under Alfred Marshall.[2]\n\nPerhaps the last autodidact to make significant contributions to economic theory, Hawtrey began his study of economics only when preparing for the civil-service exam at the Treasury. Hawtrey’s Cambridge background, his friendship with Keynes, and the similarities between his own monetary theories and those of Marshall, Keynes and other Cambridge economists contributed to the widespread impression that Hawtrey had ties to the Cambridge school of economics, a connection Hawtrey denied. Hawtrey’s powerful analytical mind, his command of monetary history and deep and wide knowledge of monetary and business institutions, acquired by dint of intense independent study, led to a rapid rise in the Treasury bureaucracy, eventually becoming Director of Economic Studies in 1919, a position he held until he retired from the Treasury in 1945.\n\nCoincidentally, both Hawtrey and Keynes published their first books in 1913, Keynes writing about the reform of the Indian Currency system (Indian Currency and Finance) and Hawtrey propounding his monetary theory of the business cycle (Good and Bad Trade). A more substantive coincidence in their first books is that they both described a gold-exchange standard (resurrecting an idea described almost a century earlier by Ricardo in his Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency) in which gold coins do not circulate and the central bank holds reserves, not in gold, but in foreign exchange denominated in currencies legally convertible into gold.\n\nThe trajectory of Hawtrey’s carrier (like Keynes’s) was sharply upward after publication of his first book. Hawtrey’s reputation was further enhanced by important academic articles about the history of monetary institutions and the gold standard. Those studies were incorporated in Hawtrey’s most important work on monetary economics, Currency and Credit published in 1919, a profound treatise on monetary economics in which his deep theoretical insights were deployed to shed light on important events and developments in the history of monetary institutions. A resounding success, the volume becoming a standard work routinely assigned to students of money and banking for over a decade, establishing Hawtrey as one of the most widely read and frequently cited economists in the 1920s and even the 1930s.\n\nAlthough Keynes, by virtue of his celebrated book The Economic Consequences of the Peace became one of the most prominent public figures in Britain in the immediate postwar period, Hawtrey’s reputation among economists and policy makers likely overshadowed Keynes’s in the early 1920s. That distinction is exemplified by their roles at the 1922 Genoa Conference on postwar international cooperation and reconstruction.\n\nIn his writings about postwar monetary reconstruction, Hawtrey emphasized the necessity for international cooperation to restore international gold standard lest an uncoordinated restoration by individual countries with countries seeking to accumulate gold, thereby causing gold to appreciate and prices in terms of gold to fall. It was Hawtrey’s warnings, echoed independently by the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel, that caused the Treasury to recommend that planning for a coordinated restoration of the gold standard be included in agenda of the Genoa Conference.\n\nWhile Hawtrey was the intellectual inspiration for including restoration of gold standard on the agenda of the Genoa Conference, Keynes’s role at Genoa was journalistic, serving as a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. Keynes criticized the plan to reestablish an international gold standard even in the form of a gold-exchange standard that he and Hawtrey had described a decade earlier. Keynes observed that there was then only one nation with an effective gold standard, the United States. Conjecturing that the US, holding 40% of the world’s gold reserves, would likely choose to divest itself of at least part of its gold hoard, causing gold depreciation, Keynes argued that rejoining the gold standard would mean importing inflation from the United States. Keynes therefore recommended that Britain to adopt an independent monetary policy detached from gold to achieve a stable domestic price level.\n\nBut after it became clear that the US had no intention of unburdening itself of its huge gold holdings, Keynes reversed his rationale for opposing restoration of the gold standard. Given the depreciation of sterling against the dollar during and after World War I, the goal of restoring the prewar dollar-sterling parity of $4.86/pound would require Britain to endure even more deflation than it had already suffered following the sharp US deflation of 1920-21.\n\nWhen Winston Churchill, appointed Chancelor of the Exchequer in the new Conservative Government, announced in November 1924 that he would restore the gold standard at the prewar parity by April 1925, the pound appreciated against the dollar. But the market exchange rate with the dollar remained 10% below the prewar parity. Keynes began arguing against restoring the prewar parity because a further 10% deflation would impose an unacceptable hardship on an economy that had not recovered from the effects of the recession and high unemployment caused by earlier deflation.\n\nAfter personally consulting Keynes in person about his argument against restoring the prewar parity, Churchill also invited Hawtrey to hear his argument in favor of restoring the prewar parity. Hawtrey believed that doing so would bolster London’s position as the preeminent international financial center. But he also urged that, to avoid the dire consequences that Keynes warned would follow restoration of the prewar parity, the Bank of England reduce Bank Rate to promote economic expansion and employment. Given the unique position of London as the center of international finance, Hawtrey was confident that the Bank of England could ease its monetary policy and that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would ease their policies as well, thereby allowing the gold standard to be restored without significant deflation.\n\nSupported by his Treasury advisers including Hawtrey, Churchill restored the gold standard at the prewar dollar parity in April 1925, causing Keynes to publish his brutal critique of that decision in his pamphlet The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill. While the consequences were perhaps not as dire as Keynes had predicted, they were less favorable than Hawtrey had hoped, the Bank of England refusing to reduce Bank Rate below 5% as Hawtrey had urged. At any rate, after a brief downturn in the latter part of 1925, the British economy did expand moderately from 1926 through early 1929 with unemployment declining slightly before Britain, along with the rest of the world, plunged into the Great Depression in the second half of 1929.\n\nKeynes and Hawtrey again came into indirect opposition in the 1929 general election campaign, when Lloyd George, leader of the Liberal Party, proposed a program of public works to increase employment. In rejecting Lloyd George’s proposal, Churchill cited the “traditional Treasury view” that public spending simply displaced an equal amount of private spending, merely shifting spending from the private to the public sector without increasing total output and employment.\n\nThe source of “the traditional Treasury” view” was Hawtrey, himself, who had made the argument at length in a 1925 article in the Economic Journal which he had previously made in less detail in Good and Bad Trade. Replying to Churchill, Keynes and Hubert Henderson co-authored a pamphlet Can Lloyd George Do It supporting Lloyd George’s proposal and criticizing the Treasury View.\n\nKeynes and Hawtrey confronted each other in person when Hawtrey testified before the Macmillan Committee investigating the causes of high unemployment. As a member of the Committee, Keynes questioned Hawtrey about his argument that the Bank of England could have countered rising unemployment by reducing Bank Rate, seemingly exposing an inconsistency in Hawtrey’s responses to his questions. But, when considered in light of Hawtrey’s assumption that a reduction in Bank Rate by the Bank of England would have led to Federal Reserve and other central banks to reduce their interest rates rather than absorb further inflows of gold, the inconsistency is resolved (see this post for further explanation).\n\nAlthough Hawtrey had warned of the dreadful consequences of restoring the gold standard without coordination among central bank to avoid rapid accumulation of gold reserves, his warnings were disregarded when France returned to the gold standard in 1927 and began rapidly increasing its gold reserves in 1928. Hawtrey’s association with the Treasury view fostered the misimpression that, despite his unheeded advocacy of reducing Bank Rate to reduce unemployment, Hawtrey was oblivious to, or unconcerned by, the problem of unemployment. While Keynes often tried out new ideas, as he did with his neo-Wicksellian theory of the business cycle in his Treatise on Money only to abandon it in response to criticism and the changing economic environment of the Great Depression before writing his General Theory of Interest, Income and Money, Hawtrey stuck to the same basic theory developed in his first two books.\n\nWhile his output of new publications in the 1930s did not flag, Hawtrey’s reputation among economists and his influence in the Treasury gradually declined, especially after publication of Keynes’s General Theory as the attention of economists was increasingly occupied by an effort to comprehend and assimilate it into the received body of economic theory. By the time he retired from the Treasury in 1945 to become Professor of International Economics at the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Hawtrey was no longer at the cutting edge of the economics profession, and his work gradually fell from the view of younger economists.\n\nNevertheless, for the next two decades as he advanced to old age, Hawtrey continued to publish important works, mostly, but not exclusively concerning the conduct of British monetary policy, especially his lonely criticism of Britain’s 1947 devaluation of the pound. Elaborating on arguments advanced in his early writings, Hawtrey anticipated much of what would become known as the monetary approach to the balance of payments.\n\nGiven his monetary explanation of the Great Depression, it might have been expected that Monetarists, especially Milton Friedman, who, in the early 1950s, began his effort to develop a monetary theory of the Great Depression as an alternative to the Keynesian theory of a sudden decline in animal spirits that caused a stock-market crash and a drop in investment spending from which the private economy could not recover on its own, would have found Hawtrey’s explanation of the causes of the Great Depression to be worth their attention. However, one would search for Hawtrey’s name almost in vain in Friedman’s writings in general, and in his writings on the Great Depression, in particular. Certainly there was no recognition in the Monetarist literature on the Great Depression that a monetary theory of the Great Depression had actually been advanced by Hawtrey as the Great Depression was unfolding or that Hawtrey had warned in advance of the danger of the catastrophic deflation that would result from an uncoordinated restoration of the gold standard.\n\nYears after Friedman’s magnum opus The Monetary History of the US was published, various researchers, including Peter Temin, Barry Eichengreen, Ben Bernanke, Kenneth Mouré, Clark Johnson, Scott Sumner, and Ronald Batchelder and I, recognized the critical importance of the newly restored gold standard in causing the Great Depression. While most of the later authors cited Hawtrey’s writings, the full extent of Hawtrey’s contributions that fully anticipated all the major conclusions of the later research remains generally unrecognized in most of the recent literature on the Great Depression, while Friedman’s very flawed account of the Great Depression continues to be regarded by most economists and financial historians as authoritative if not definitive.\n\nIn a future post, I’ll discuss Hetzel’s account of Hawtrey’s explanation of the Great Depression. Unlike earlier Monetarists who ignored Hawtrey’s explanation entirely, Hetzel does credit Hawtrey with having provided a coherent explanation of the causes of the Great Depression, without acknowledging the many respects in which Hawtrey’s explanation is more complete and more persuasive than Friedman’s. He also argues that Friedman provided a better account of the recovery than Hawtrey, because Friedman, unlike Hawtrey, recognized the effectiveness of open-market operations which Hawtrey maintained would be ineffective in initiating a recovery in situations of what Hawtrey called credit deadlock.\n\nIn another post, I’ll discuss the highly critical, and I believe tendentious, treatment by Clara Elizabeth Mattei, of Hawtrey’s supposed role in devising and rationalizing the austerity policies of the British Treasury in the 1920s up to and including the Great Depression.\n\n[1] While Keynes was an accomplished mathematician who wrote an important philosophical and mathematical work A Treatise on Probability praised extravagantly by Bertrand Russell, Hawtrey’s mathematical skills were sufficiently formidable to have drawn the attention of Russell who included a footnote in his Principia Mathematica replying to a letter from Hawtrey.\n\n[2] Keynes, however, the son of John Neville Keynes, a Cambridge philosopher and economist, had a personal connection to Marshall apart from his formal studies at Cambridge. Rather than pursue graduate studies, Hawtrey chose a career in the civil service, first at the Admiralty and soon thereafter at the Treasury.\n\nLast week Houston McCulloch, one of the leading monetary economists of my generation, posted an insightful and thoughtful discussion of the causes of the Great Depression with which I largely, though not entirely, agree. Although Scott Sumner has already commented on Hu’s discussion, I also wanted to weigh in with some of my comments. Here is how McCulloch sets up his discussion.\n\nUnderstanding what caused the Great Depression of 1929-39 and why it persisted so long has been fairly characterized by Ben Bernanke as the “Holy Grail of Macroeconomics.” The fear that the financial crisis of 2008 would lead to a similar Depression induced the Fed to use its emergency powers to bail out failing firms and to more than quadruple the monetary base, while Congress authorized additional bailouts and doubled the national debt. Could the Great Recession have taken a similar turn had these extreme measures not been taken?\n\nEconomists have often blamed the Depression on U.S. monetary policy or financial institutions. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) famously argued that a spontaneous wave of runs against fragile fractional reserve banks led to a rise in the currency/deposit ratio. The Fed failed to offset the resulting fall in the money multiplier with base expansion, leading to a disastrous 24% deflation from 1929 to 1933. Through the short-run Phillips curve effect (Friedman 1968), this in turn led to a surge in unemployment to 22.5% by 1932.\n\nThe Debt-Deflation theory of Irving Fisher, and later Ben Bernanke (1995), takes the deflation as given, and blames the severity of the disruption on the massive bankruptcies that were caused by the increased burden of nominal indebtedness. Murray Rothbard (1963) uses the “Austrian” business cycle theory of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek to blame the downturn on excessive domestic credit expansion by the Fed during the 1920s that disturbed the intertemporal structure of production (cf. McCulloch 2014).\n\nMy own view, after pondering the problem for many decades, is that indeed the Depression was monetary in origin, but that the ultimate blame lies not with U.S. domestic monetary and financial policy during the 1920s and 30s. Rather, the massive deflation was an inevitable consequence of Europe’s departure from the gold standard during World War I — and its bungled and abrupt attempt to return to gold in the late 1920s.\n\nI agree with every word of this introductory passage, so let’s continue.\n\nIn brief, the departure of the European belligerents from gold in 1914 massively reduced the global demand for gold, leading to the inflation of prices in terms of gold — and, therefore, in terms of currencies like the U.S. dollar which were convertible to gold at a fixed parity. After the war, Europe initially postponed its return to gold, leading to a plateau of high prices during the 1920s that came to be perceived as the new normal. In the late 1920s, there was a scramble to return to the pre-war gold standard, with the inevitable consequence that commodity prices — in terms of gold, and therefore in terms of the dollar — had to return to something approaching their 1914 level.\n\nThe deflation was thus inevitable, but was made much more harmful by its postponement and then abruptness. In retrospect, the UK could have returned to its pre-war parity with far less pain by emulating the U.S. post-Civil War policy of freezing the monetary base until the price level gradually fell to its pre-war level. France should not have over-devalued the franc, and then should have monetized its gold influx rather than acting as a global gold sink. Gold reserve ratios were unnecessarily high, especially in France.\n\nHere is where I start to quibble a bit with Hu, mainly about the importance of Britain’s 1925 resumption of convertibility at the prewar parity with the dollar. Largely owing to Keynes’s essay “The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill,” in which Keynes berated Churchill for agreeing to the demands of the City and to the advice of the British Treasury advisers (including Ralph Hawtrey), on whom he relied despite Keynes’s attempt to convince him otherwise, to quickly resume gold convertibility at the prewar dollar parity, warning of the devastating effects of the subsequent deflation on British industry and employment, much greater significance has been attributed to the resumption of convertibility than it actually had on the subsequent course of events. Keynes’s analysis of the deflationary effect of the resumption was largely correct, but the effect turned out to be milder than he anticipated. Britain had already undergone a severe deflation in the early 1920s largely as a result of the American deflation. Thus by 1925, Britain had already undergone nearly 5 years of continuous deflation that brought the foreign exchange value of sterling to within 10 percent of the prewar dollar parity. The remaining deflation required to enable sterling to appreciate another 10 percent was not trivial, but by 1925 most of the deflationary pain had already been absorbed. Britain was able to sustain further mild deflation for the next four years till mid-1929 even as the British economy grew and unemployment declined gradually. The myth that Britain was mired in a continuous depression after the resumption of convertibility in 1925 has no basis in the evidence. Certainly, a faster recovery would have been desirable, and Hawtrey consistently criticized the Bank of England for keeping Bank Rate at 5% even with deflation in the 1-2% range.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve was somewhat accommodative in the 1925-28 period, but could have easily been even more accommodative. As McCulloch correctly notes it was really France, which undervalued the franc when it restored convertibility in 1928, and began accumulating gold in record quantities that became the primary destabilizing force in the world economy. Britain was largely an innocent bystander.\n\nHowever, given that the U.S. had a fixed exchange rate relative to gold and no control over Europe’s misguided policies, it was stuck with importing the global gold deflation — regardless of its own domestic monetary policies. The debt/deflation problem undoubtedly aggravated the Depression and led to bank failures, which in turn increased the currency/deposit ratio and compounded the situation. However, a substantial portion of the fall in the U.S. nominal money stock was to be expected as a result of the inevitable deflation — and therefore was the product, rather than the primary cause, of the deflation. The anti-competitive policies of the Hoover years and FDR’s New Deal (Rothbard 1963, Ohanian 2009) surely aggravated and prolonged the Depression, but were not the ultimate cause.\n\nActually, the Fed, holding 40% of the world’s gold reserves in 1929, could have eased pressure on the world gold market by allowing an efflux of gold to accommodate the French demand for gold. However, instead of taking an accommodative stance, the Fed, seized by dread of stock-market speculation, kept increasing short-term interest rates, thereby attracting gold into the United States instead of allowing gold to flow out, increasing pressure on the world gold market and triggering the latent deflationary forces that until mid-1929 had been kept at bay. Anti-competitive policies under Hoover and under FDR were certainly not helpful, but those policies, as McCulloch recognizes, did not cause the collapse of output between 1929 and 1933.\n\nContemporary economists Ralph Hawtrey, Charles Rist, and Gustav Cassel warned throughout the 1920s that substantial deflation, in terms of gold and therefore the dollar, would be required to sustain a return to anything like the 1914 gold standard.[1] In 1928, Cassel actually predicted that a global depression was imminent:\n\nThe post-War superfluity of gold is, however, of an entirely temporary character, and the great problem is how to meet the growing scarcity of gold which threatens the world both from increased demand and from diminished supply. We must solve this problem by a systematic restriction of the monetary demand for gold. Only if we succeed in doing this can we hope to prevent a permanent fall in the general price level and a prolonged and world-wide depression which would inevitably be connected with such a fall in prices [as quoted by Johnson (1997, p. 55)].\n\nAs early as 1919 both Hawtrey and Cassel had warned that a global depression would follow an attempt to restore the gold standard as it existed before World War I. To avoid such a deflation it was necessary to limit the increase in the monetary demand for gold. Hawtrey and Cassel therefore proposed shifting to a gold exchange standard in which gold coinage would not be restored and central banks would hold non-gold foreign exchange reserves rather than gold bullion. The 1922 Genoa Resolutions were largely inspired by the analysis of Hawtrey and Cassel, and those resolutions were largely complied with until France began its insane gold accumulation policy in 1928 just as the Fed began tightening monetary policy to suppress stock-market speculation, thereby triggering, more or less inadvertently, an almost equally massive inflow of gold into the US. (On Hawtrey and Cassel, see my paper with Ron Batchelder.)\n\nMcCulloch has a very interesting discussion of the role of the gold standard as a tool of war finance, which reminds me of Earl Thompson’s take on the gold standard, (“Gold Standard: Causes and Consequences”) that Earl contributed to a volume I edited, Business Cycles and Depressions: An Encyclopedia. To keep this post from growing inordinately long, and because it’s somewhat tangential to McCulloch’s larger theme, I won’t comment on that part of McCulloch’s discussion.\n\nThe Gold Exchange Standard\n\nAfter the war, in order to stay on gold at $20.67 an ounce, with Europe off gold, the U.S. had to undo its post-1917 inflation. The Fed achieved this by raising the discount rate on War Bonds, beginning in late 1919, inducing banks to repay their corresponding loans. The result was a sharp 16% fall in the price level from 1920 to 1922. Unemployment rose from 3.0% in 1919 to 8.7% in 1921. However, nominal wages fell quickly, and unemployment was back to 4.8% by 1923, where it remained until 1929.[3]\n\nThe 1920-22 deflation thus brought the U.S. price level into equilibrium, but only in a world with Europe still off gold. Restoring the full 1914 gold standard would have required going back to approximately the 1914 value of gold in terms of commodities, and therefore the 1914 U.S. price level, after perhaps extrapolating for a continuation of the 1900-1914 “gold inflation.”\n\nThis is basically right except that I don’t think it makes sense to refer to the US price level as being in equilibrium in 1922. Holding 40% of the world’s monetary gold reserves, the US was in a position to determine the value of gold at whatever level it wanted. To call the particular level at which the US decided to stabilize the value of gold in 1922 an equilibrium is not based on any clear definition of equilibrium that I can identify.\n\nHowever, the European countries did not seriously try to get back on gold until the second half of the 1920s. The Genoa Conference of 1922 recognized that prices were too high for a full gold standard, but instead tried to put off the necessary deflation with an unrealistic “Gold Exchange Standard.” Under that system, only the “gold center” countries, the U.S. and UK, would hold actual gold reserves, while other central banks would be encouraged to hold dollar or sterling reserves, which in turn would only be fractionally backed by gold. The Gold Exchange Standard sounded good on paper, but unrealistically assumed that the rest of the world would permanently kowtow to the financial supremacy of New York and London.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that the Genoa Resolutions were unrealistic in the sense that they assumed that countries going back on the gold standard would be willing to forego the holding of gold reserves to a greater extent than they were willing to. But to a large extent, this was the result of systematically incorrect ideas about how the gold standard worked before World War I and how the system could work after World War I, not of any inherent or necessary properties of the gold standard itself. Nor was the assumption that the rest of the world would permanently kowtow to the financial supremacy of New York and London all that unrealistic when considered in the light of how readily, before World War I, the rest of the world kowtowed to the financial supremacy of London.\n\nIn 1926, under Raymond Poincaré, France stabilized the franc after a 5:1 devaluation. However, it overdid the devaluation, leaving the franc undervalued by about 25%, according to The Economist (Johnson 1997, p. 131). Normally, under the specie flow mechanism, this would have led to a rapid accumulation of international reserves accompanied by monetary expansion and inflation, until the price level caught up with purchasing power parity. But instead, the Banque de France sterilized the reserve influx by reducing its holdings of government and commercial credit, so that inflation did not automatically stop the reserve inflow. Furthermore, it often cashed dollar and sterling reserves for gold, again contrary to the Gold Exchange Standard. The Banking Law of 1928 made the new exchange rate, as well as the gold-only policy, official. By 1932, French gold reserves were 80% of currency and sight deposits (Irwin 2012), and France had acquired 28.4% of world gold reserves — even though it accounted for only 6.6% of world manufacturing output (Johnson 1997, p. 194). This “French Gold Sink” created even more deflationary pressure on gold, and therefore dollar prices, than would otherwise have been expected.\n\nHere McCulloch is unintentionally displaying some of the systematically incorrect ideas about how the gold standard worked that I referred to above. McCulloch is correct that the franc was substantially undervalued when France restored convertibility in 1928. But under the gold standard, the French price level would automatically adjust to the world price level regardless of what happened to the French money supply. However, the Bank of France, partly because it was cashing in the rapidly accumulating foreign exchange reserves for gold as French exports were rising and its imports falling given the low internal French price level, and partly because it was legally barred from increasing the supply of banknotes by open-market operations, was accumulating gold both actively and passively. With no mechanism for increasing the quantity of banknotes in France, a balance of payment of surplus was the only mechanism by which an excess demand for money could be accommodated. It was not an inflow of gold that was being sterilized (sterilization being a misnomer reflecting a confusion about the direction of causality) it was the lack of any domestic mechanism for increasing the quantity of banknotes that caused an inflow of gold. Importing gold was the only means by which an excess domestic demand for banknotes could be satisfied.\n\nThe Second Post-War Deflation\n\nBy 1931, French gold withdrawals forced Germany to adopt exchange controls, and Britain to give up convertibility altogether. However, these countries did not then disgorge their remaining gold, but held onto it in the hopes of one day restoring free convertibility. Meanwhile, after having been burned by the Bank of England’s suspension, the “Gold Bloc” countries — Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland — also began amassing gold reserves in earnest, raising their share of world gold reserves from 4.2% in June 1930 to 11.1% two years later (Johnson 1997, p. 194). Despite the dollar’s relatively strong position, the Fed also contributed to the problem by raising its gold coverage ratio to over 75% by 1930, well in excess of the 40% required by law (Irwin 2012, Fig. 5).\n\nThe result was a second post-war deflation as the value of gold, and therefore of the dollar, in terms of commodities, abruptly caught up with the greatly increased global demand for gold. The U.S. price level fell 24.0% between 1929 and 1933, with deflation averaging 6.6% per year for 4 years in a row. Unemployment shot up to 22.5% by 1932.\n\nBy 1933, the U.S. price level was still well above its 1914 level. However, if the “gold inflation” of 1900-1914 is extrapolated to 1933, as in Figure 3, the trend comes out to almost the 1933 price level. It therefore appears that the U.S. price level, if not its unemployment rate, was finally near its equilibrium under a global gold standard with the dollar at $20.67 per ounce, and that further deflation was probably unnecessary.[4]\n\nOnce again McCulloch posits an equilibrium price level under a global gold standard. The mistake is in assuming that there is a fixed monetary demand for gold, which is an assumption completely without foundation. The monetary demand for gold is not fixed. The greater the monetary demand for gold the higher the equilibrium real value of gold and the lower the price level in terms of gold. The equilibrium price level is a function of the monetary demand for gold.\n\nThe 1929-33 deflation was much more destructive than the 1920-22 deflation, in large part because it followed a 7-year “plateau” of relatively stable prices that lulled the credit and labor markets into thinking that the higher price level was the new norm — and that gave borrowers time to accumulate substantial nominal debt. In 1919-1920, on the other hand, the newly elevated price level seemed abnormally high and likely to come back down in the near future, as it had after 1812 and 1865.\n\nThis is correct, and I fully agree.\n\nHow It Could Have been Different\n\nIn retrospect, the UK could have successfully gotten itself back on gold with far less disruption simply by emulating the U.S. post-Civil War policy of freezing the monetary base at its war-end level, and then letting the economy grow into the money supply with a gradual deflation. This might have taken 14 years, as in the U.S. between 1865-79, or even longer, but it would have been superior to the economic, social, and political turmoil that the UK experienced. After the pound rose to its pre-war parity of $4.86, the BOE could have begun gradually buying gold reserves with new liabilities and even redeeming those liabilities on demand for gold, subject to reserve availability. Once reserves reached say 20% of its liabilities, it could have started to extend domestic credit to the government and the private sector through the banks, while still maintaining convertibility. Gold coins could even have been circulated, as demanded.\n\nAgain, I reiterate that, although the UK resumption was more painful for Britain than it need have been, the resumption had little destabilizing effect on the international economy. The UK did not have a destabilizing effect on the world economy until the September 1931 crisis that caused Britain to leave the gold standard.\n\nIf the UK and other countries had all simply devalued in proportion to their domestic price levels at the end of the war, they could have returned to gold quicker, and with less deflation. However, given that a country’s real demand for money — and therefore its demand for real gold reserves — depends only on the real size of the economy and its net gold reserve ratio, such policies would not have reduced the ultimate global demand for gold or lessened the postwar deflation in countries that remained on gold at a fixed parity.\n\nThis is an important point. Devaluation was a way of avoiding an overvalued currency and the relative deflation that a single country needed to undergo. But the main problem facing the world in restoring the gold standard was not the relative deflation of countries with overvalued currencies but the absolute deflation associated with an increased world demand for gold across all countries. Indeed, it was France, the country that did devalue that was the greatest source of increased demand for gold owing to its internal monetary policies based on a perverse gold standard ideology.\n\nIn fact, the problem was not that gold was “undervalued” (as Johnson puts it) or that there was a “shortage” of gold (as per Cassel and others), but that the price level in terms of gold, and therefore dollars, was simply unsustainably high given Europe’s determination to return to gold. In any event, it was inconceivable that the U.S. would have devalued in 1922, since it had plenty of gold, had already corrected its price level to the world situation with the 1920-22 deflation, and did not have the excuse of a banking crisis as in 1933.\n\nI think that this is totally right. It was not the undervaluation of individual currencies that was the problem, it was the increase in the demand for gold associated with the simultaneous return of many countries to the gold standard. It is also a mistake to confuse Cassel’s discussion of gold shortage, which he viewed as a long-term problem, with the increase in gold demand associated with returning to the gold standard which was the cause of sudden deflation starting in 1929 as a result of the huge increase in gold demand by the Bank of France, a phenomenon that McCulloch mentions early on in his discussion but does not refer to again.\n\nIn my fifth month of blogging in November 2011, I wrote a post which I called “The Economic Consequences of Mrs. Merkel.” The title, as I explained, was inspired by J. M. Keynes’s famous essay “The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill,” which eloquently warned that Britain was courting disaster by restoring the convertibility of sterling into gold at the prewar parity of $4.86 to the pound, the dollar then being the only major currency convertible into gold. The title of Keynes’s essay, in turn, had been inspired by Keynes’s celebrated book The Economic Consequences of the Peace about the disastrous Treaty of Versailles, which accurately foretold the futility of imposing punishing war reparations on Germany.\n\nIn his essay, Keynes warned that by restoring the prewar parity, Churchill would force Britain into an untenable deflation at a time when more than 10% of the British labor force was unemployed (i.e., looking for, but unable to find, a job at prevailing wages). Keynes argued that the deflation necessitated by restoration of the prewar parity would impose an intolerable burden of continued and increased unemployment on British workers.\n\nBut, as it turned out, Churchill’s decision turned out to be less disastrous than Keynes had feared. The resulting deflation was quite mild, wages in nominal terms were roughly stable, and real output and employment grew steadily with unemployment gradually falling under 10% by 1928. The deflationary shock that Keynes had warned against turned out to be less severe than Keynes had feared because the U.S. Federal Reserve, under the leadership of Benjamin Strong, President of the New York Fed, the de facto monetary authority of the US and the world, followed a policy that allowed a slight increase in the world price level in terms of dollars, thereby moderating the deflationary effect on Britain of restoring the prewar sterling/dollar exchange rate.\n\nThanks to Strong’s enlightened policy, the world economy continued to expand through 1928. I won’t discuss the sequence of events in 1928 and 1929 that led to the 1929 stock market crash, but those events had little, if anything, to do with Churchill’s 1925 decision. I’ve discussed the causes of the 1929 crash and the Great Depression in many other places including my 2011 post about Mrs. Merkel, so I will skip the 1929 story in this post.\n\nThe point that I want to make is that even though Keynes’s criticism of Churchill’s decision to restore the prewar dollar/sterling parity was well-taken, the dire consequences that Keynes foretold, although they did arrive a few years thereafter, were not actually caused by Churchill’s decision, but by decisions made in Paris and New York, over which Britain may have had some influence, but little, if any, control.\n\nWhat I want to discuss in this post is how my warnings about potential disaster almost six and a half years ago have turned out. Here’s how I described the situation in November 2011:\n\nFast forward some four score years to today’s tragic re-enactment of the deflationary dynamics that nearly destroyed European civilization in the 1930s. But what a role reversal! In 1930 it was Germany that was desperately seeking to avoid defaulting on its obligations by engaging in round after round of futile austerity measures and deflationary wage cuts, causing the collapse of one major European financial institution after another in the annus horribilis of 1931, finally (at least a year after too late) forcing Britain off the gold standard in September 1931. Eighty years ago it was France, accumulating huge quantities of gold, in Midas-like self-satisfaction despite the economic wreckage it was inflicting on the rest of Europe and ultimately itself, whose monetary policy was decisive for the international value of gold and the downward course of the international economy. Now, it is Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe dominating the European Central Bank, which effectively controls the value of the euro. And just as deflation under the gold standard made it impossible for Germany (and its state and local governments) not to default on its obligations in 1931, the policy of the European Central Bank, self-righteously dictated by Germany, has made default by Greece and now Italy and at least three other members of the Eurozone inevitable. . . .\n\nIf the European central bank does not soon – and I mean really soon – grasp that there is no exit from the debt crisis without a reversal of monetary policy sufficient to enable nominal incomes in all the economies in the Eurozone to grow more rapidly than does their indebtedness, the downward spiral will overtake even the stronger European economies. (I pointed out three months ago that the European crisis is a NGDP crisis not a debt crisis.) As the weakest countries choose to ditch the euro and revert back to their own national currencies, the euro is likely to start to appreciate as it comes to resemble ever more closely the old deutschmark. At some point the deflationary pressures of a rising euro will cause even the Germans, like the French in 1935, to relent. But one shudders at the economic damage that will be inflicted until the Germans come to their senses. Only then will we be able to assess the full economic consequences of Mrs. Merkel.\n\nGreece did default, but the European Community succeeded in imposing draconian austerity measures on Greece, while Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal, which had all been in some danger, managed to avoid default. That they did so is due first to the enormous cost that would have be borne by a country in the Eurozone to extricate itself from the Eurozone and reinstitute its own national currency and second to the actions taken by Mario Draghi, who succeeded Jean Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank in November 2011. If monetary secession from the eurozone were less fraught, surely Greece and perhaps other countries would have chosen that course rather than absorb the continuing pain of remaining in the eurozone.\n\nBut if it were not for a decisive change in policy by Draghi, Greece and perhaps other countries would have been compelled to follow that uncharted and potentially catastrophic path. But, after assuming leadership of the ECB, Draghi immediately reversed the perverse interest-rate hikes imposed by his predecessor and, even more crucially, announced in July 2012 that the ECB “is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough.” Draghi’s reassurance that monetary easing would be sufficient to avoid default calmed markets, alleviated market pressure driving up interest rates on debt issued by those countries.\n\nBut although Draghi’s courageous actions to ease monetary policy in the face of German disapproval avoided a complete collapse, the damage inflicted by Mrs. Merkel’s ferocious anti-inflation policy did irreparable damage, not only on Greece, but, by deepening the European downturn and delaying and suppressing the recovery, on the rest of the European community, inflaming anti-EU, populist nationalism in much of Europe that helped fuel the campaign for Brexit in the UK and has inspired similar anti-EU movements elsewhere in Europe and almost prevented Mrs. Merkel from forming a government after the election a few months ago.\n\nMrs. Merkel is perhaps the most impressive political leader of our time, and her willingness to follow a humanitarian policy toward refugees fleeing the horrors of war and persecution showed an extraordinary degree of political courage and personal decency that ought to serve as a model for other politicians to emulate. But that admirable legacy will be forever tarnished by the damage she inflicted on her own country and the rest of the EU by her misguided battle against the phantom threat of inflation."
