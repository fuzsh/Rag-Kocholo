Illustrations. 464 pp. $32.95 (cloth), ISBN 978-0-19-875535-7.\n\nReviewed by John Graham (Rutgers University at Newark)\n\nPublished on H-Socialisms (April, 2021)\n\nCommissioned by Gary Roth (Rutgers University - Newark)\n\nPrintable Version: https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=55876\n\nFrank Ramsey: Mathematics, Economics, and Philosophy\n\n“Any biography of Frank Ramsey must start with, and be haunted by, his death,” writes Cheryl Misak in this first full-length biography of the 1920s Cambridge genius who died at the age of twenty-six (p. xxiii). By the time of his death in January 1930, he had published fewer than twelve papers in four fields of study. Including his undergraduate years, Ramsey was an academic for less than ten years, but he made fundamental contributions to mathematics, logic, philosophy, and economics. His trailblazing work on choice under uncertainty cut across disciplines. In economics, he authored two published papers in the Economic Journal, still considered among the top contributions ever published there. In philosophy and mathematics, he made advances in multiple areas, reflected in approaches, propositions, and theorems that still bear his name.\n\nThe son of a Cambridge mathematician, Ramsey spent nearly all of his life in the bucolic English university town that was home to some of the greatest thinkers of the early twentieth century, including philosophers Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein; economists John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Pigou; and mathematicians G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood. Many years their junior, he was treated as an equal even as an undergraduate; as a young mathematics fellow at King’s College, he influenced them as much as they nurtured him. Speaking in particular of Keynes and the three philosophers, Misak notes that Ramsey “would become the singular mind who could engage each [of them] on their own terms. There would be simply no one else who could do that, including these four themselves” (p. 54).\n\nMisak, professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto, has written an outstanding and readable intellectual biography of Ramsey, based on his entire body of work, much of which only appeared in print years after his death. Over time, Ramsey’s reputation as an economist, logician, and philosopher has grown in stature. Misak observes that “much of Ramsey’s work had a delayed effect.... The rest of the world had to catch up with him, especially on technical matters” (p. xxvi). While she does a yeoman’s job explaining many of his fundamental ideas, she has wisely invited a group of distinguished scholars to write fuller explanations of some of his specific contributions. These appear as guest boxes scattered throughout the book, which may be skipped, skimmed, or studied in detail by readers, depending on their own training, expertise, and interests. This five-hundred-page book is equally the story of a young genius, uncharacteristically modest, accessible, and vulnerable, as seen from his own diaries and letters, “which were not occasions for creativity and were not meant for posterity,” and from the writings of his friends and colleagues, including illustrious Cambridge Apostles, distinguished Oxbridge dons, and some of the most colorful characters of the Bloomsbury group (p. xxxiv).\n\nFrank Ramsey was born on February 22, 1903, the first of four children born to Arthur and Agnes, whose second son Michael would go on to serve as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1961 to 1974. Arthur was a competent but conventional mathematician and administrator at Magdalene College. Agnes was among the first women educated at Oxford whom Misak describes as a powerhouse and progressive advocate for liberal causes. Her children were devoted to her, while puritanical Arthur was often-times sulky, silent, and emotionally distant from the family. Their beloved and precocious son Frank won a scholarship to Winchester, where he was reserved, remote, and self-contained. One fellow student recalled, “Ramsey was an adult at the age of twelve” (p. 28). He excelled without effort at mathematics and became a pacifist, socialist, and avid reader of advanced texts in philosophy, logic, politics, and economics. Back home in Cambridge, he studied German under C. K. Ogden, editor of The Cambridge Magazine, who would publish two of his earliest articles. At age seventeen, he competed for a scholarship at Trinity College, placing first in mathematics and two additional fields. He entered Cambridge in October 1920.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Frank, although physically large, was several years younger than any of his all-male classmates, many of them returning war veterans. By inclination, he drifted toward friends who were bright, accomplished, ambitious, fun-loving, artistic, and invariably pacifists and socialists. One of them was fellow mathematics student Richard Braithwaite, later professor of philosophy at Cambridge, who would edit an important selection of Ramsey’s papers for publication after his death. Braithwaite, three years Ramsey’s senior, recommended Ramsey for membership in the Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as The Apostles, whose best-known senior members included Keynes, Russell, Moore, Hardy, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, and E. M. Forster. Braithwaite had already introduced Ramsey to Keynes in early 1921, and the two formed an immediate intellectual bond (unlike the romantic one Keynes shared with another of Ramsey’s close friends, Sebastian Sprout). After Ramsey’s death, Keynes recalled that “economists living in Cambridge have been accustomed from his undergraduate days to try their theories on the keen edge of his critical and logical faculties.”[1]\n\nRamsey began his course of study for the Mathematical Tripos (examinations that qualify a Cambridge undergraduate for a bachelor’s degree) under the guidance of his father and Trinity’s Littlewood. In his own reading material and choice of lectures, Ramsey was more attracted to politics, philosophy, and economics than to pure mathematics. Even still, he took every opportunity to hear the London-based mathematician-turned-philosopher Russell speak. In 1924 Ramsey corrected page proofs for the second edition of Alfred North Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica and the following year published his thoughts on the subject under the title “The Foundations of Mathematics.” After his first term, Ramsey began attending Moore’s lectures, a charismatic presence adored by Cambridge academics and Bloomsbury artists alike. Moore later confessed about Ramsey: “he was much cleverer than I was, and consequently I felt distinctly nervous in lecturing before him” (p. 90). Ramsey also went to Keynes’s lectures on statistics and was observed to take copious notes.\n\nIn his second year at Trinity, Ramsey published two noteworthy papers in The Cambridge Magazine. The first was a critical review of Keynes’s 1921 book, A Treatise on Probability, a widely praised philosophical study steeped in the tradition of Moore and Russell, which offered a theory of rational behavior under uncertainty. Keynes’s first biographer, Roy Harrod, would later note that Ramsey’s “criticism carried more weight with Keynes than any other, and it is not clear that Keynes felt that he had a satisfactory answer to it” (p. 118). In essence, Ramsey’s criticism was that Keynes, and by extension Moore and Russell, gave insufficient weight to subjective probability and to the practical implications of one’s own beliefs. The second of Ramsey’s Cambridge papers was a mathematical refutation of an odd economic populist proposal circulating at the time known as the social credit movement advocating subsidies to labor. Ramsey used basic calculus to demonstrate the faulty national income accounting on which the proposal was based. His friend Braithwaite claimed that this article made economists sit up and take notice. Not least among them was Keynes himself, who wrote to a colleague that Ramsey was “certainly far and away the most brilliant undergraduate who has appeared for many years in the border-country between Philosophy and Mathematics” (p. 112).\n\nWhile pursuing the Mathematical Tripos with first class honors, Ramsey was increasingly drawn to philosophy and even considered for a time sitting for the Moral Philosophy Tripos. Instead, he took up his publisher friend Ogden’s offer to translate Wittgenstein’s Tractatus from the German for its initial English publication in 1922. Ramsey worked without compensation or written credit for his enormous efforts other than a brief mention in the book’s preface recognizing Ramsey “for assistance both with the translation and in the preparation of the book for the press” (p. 132). Misak says that Ramsey was unfazed by this lack of credit, as what interested him was understanding Wittgenstein’s ideas about the relationship between language and reality, captured by the thesis that “the limits of language mean the limits of my world” (p. 135). By separating “atomic facts” linked to pictures and reality from propositions of logic, mathematics, philosophy, and religion, Misak explains, Wittgenstein was “making space for.... impressions of the good, or the beautiful, or the value, and significance of one’s life, but those impressions are ineffable” (p. 136). Shortly after the publication of Tractatus, Ramsey published a review of it in the October 1923 issue of the journal Mind, which became one of the primary means by which English readers learned about Wittgenstein’s ideas.[2] Indeed, Misak notes that even Moore would use Ramsey’s exposition as the basis of his own lectures on Wittgenstein up until 1929.\n\nIn September 1923 Ramsey paid a two-week visit to Wittgenstein at his home in Puchberg, Austria. The pair spent the entire visit going through the Tractatus line by line, at a rate of one page per hour, with Ramsey taking extensive notes. In a letter home to his parents, Ramsey summed up his enthusiasm this way: “He is great. I used to think Moore a great man, but beside W!” (p. 141). Ramsey would visit Wittgenstein at least three more times between March and September 1924, although with each visit his youthful enthusiasm for the man and his approach to philosophy would dim. Ramsey’s primary purpose for being in Austria was to receive psychoanalysis in Vienna from Theodor Reik, an early pupil of Sigmund Freud. Still a virgin and suffering unrequited love for a married woman back home, Ramsey spent six months in psychoanalysis, as had many of his Cambridge and Bloomsbury friends. By the early fall, and after several visits to local brothels, he announced himself cured, just in time to return to Cambridge for the Michaelmas term. With the support of Braithwaite and Keynes, he had been named a fellow and lecturer in mathematics at King’s, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nRamsey settled quickly into his role at King’s, easily making the transition from undergraduate to faculty member in the course of just four years. One of his first students was Richard Kahn, who would go on to work out the concept of the government expenditure multiplier, now closely associated with Keynesian economics. Despite his heavy academic responsibilities, Ramsey found ample time for his friends and delivered at least three Freudian-tinged talks to the Apostles on society and sex, utilitarianism, and feminism. Most important of all, in late autumn 1924 he met Lettice Baker, a highly intelligent, free-spirited woman, five years his senior. Ramsey and Baker began a sexual relationship almost immediately, and despite his parents’ reservations, the couple married the following August. Misak notes that the couple “thought that probably nobody is monogamous, and lived accordingly. Lettice had a number of affairs, Frank perhaps only one” (p. 247). The couple would have two daughters.\n\nRamsey’s brother Michael once said that his brother wasn’t ambitious; “he was just fired up by his thoughts” (p. 257). It was the profound questions of philosophy that mattered to him most, especially the nature of meaning and truth. In what Misak calls the spectacularly productive year of 1926, he worked on two papers, “Facts and Propositions” (published in 1927) and “Truth and Probability” (published posthumously in 1931), which still resonate with scholars today. The first paper was heavily influenced by Wittgenstein and Russell, but Ramsey broadened their work by adopting a pragmatic account of meaning summarized by “if a belief leads to successful actions, it is true” (p. 259). The second paper took exception with Keynes’s view of probability (as largely objective frequency theory) by confronting the issue of partial beliefs. To Ramsey, probability can be subjective but may be measured by reference to one’s willingness to act on one’s beliefs, or to bet (although not necessarily with money). As Ramsey observed, “whenever we got to the station we are betting that a train will really run, and if we had not a sufficient degree of belief in this we should decline the bet and stay at home” (p. 268). In these papers, Ramsey introduced the notions of “subjective expected utility” and “rational choice theory,” which are now widely acknowledged as the (uncredited) foundation for John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern’s 1944 pathbreaking masterpiece, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Later decision theorists, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert A. Simon and statistician Leonard Savage, did give Ramsey the credit he deserves. As Simon wrote: “Ramsey had shown that, by an appropriate series of experiments, the utilities and subjective probabilities assigned by a subject to a set of uncertain alternatives could be measured simultaneously.”[3]\n\nRamsey’s work on expected utility and subjective probabilities is one of three areas of research in which contemporary economists credit Ramsey’s foundational input. The other two subject areas, optimal taxation and saving behavior, derive from the only two purely economics papers he would ever publish. Both “A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation” published in 1927 and “A Mathematical Theory of Saving” from 1928 appeared in the Economic Journal, a prestigious British journal founded by Alfred Marshall in 1890 and then edited by Keynes. On the occasion of its 125th anniversary in 2015, the Economic Journal published a retrospective volume devoted to the most significant articles from its past issues and included both of Ramsey’s contributions, a distinction awarded no other economist, including Keynes himself.\n\nRamsey’s published work in economics was influenced by the two mainstays of 1920s Cambridge economics, Keynes and Pigou, the latter having rooms adjacent to Ramsey’s at King’s. Both economists came to rely on Ramsey’s superior facility with mathematics. In 1927 Pigou wrote to Keynes: “Ramsey is writing out a paper on some results he got in the course of doing sums for me—with a marvelously simple generalized formula about taxes. Don’t let him be too modest to produce it for the journal” (p. 308). Those “sums” to which Pigou referred would result in nearly fifteen journal pages of differential calculus titled “A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation.” To raise a given sum of government revenue, Ramsey showed that under certain reasonable assumptions, total utility losses from commodity taxes are minimized if every commodity is taxed at a potentially differential rate, dependent on its price elasticities of supply and demand. The less price-sensitive is the production or consumption of a good, the higher will be its optimal tax rate. Economists today recognize Ramsey’s paper, in Nobel Prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz’s words, “as launching the field of optimal taxation and revolutionizing public finance.”[4] But like much of his work, this contribution would not be widely appreciated until years after his death.\n\nRamsey’s second paper in the Economic Journal grew out of his first. In one section of his tax paper, Ramsey considered whether it was appropriate to tax saving in addition to spending, without coming to a definitive conclusion. This focus on individual and societal saving behavior led to perhaps his richest paper in economics, “A Mathematical Theory of Saving,” although the dividends it provided were again not recognized immediately, as the heavy reliance on mathematics kept the paper from a wider audience for many years. Even in the early 1970s I was not aware of Ramsey’s paper during my own graduate school training. These days, however, first-year PhD students routinely study it as one of the foundational papers in the field of economic growth and optimal growth theory, or what graduate macroeconomic textbooks call the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans growth model. It is also noteworthy that Ramsey’s saving paper foreshadowed later Nobel Prize-winning work from the 1950s and 1960s by Paul Samuelson and Peter Diamond on overlapping generations consumption-loan models; by Milton Friedman on the permanent income hypothesis; and by Franco Modigliani on life-cycle models of household consumption, saving, and labor supply.\n\nIn 1928 Ramsey delivered his saving paper to Keynes along with a letter that ended: “Of course, the whole thing is a waste of time, as I’m mainly occupied on a book about logic, from which this distracts” (p. 316). One part of this ongoing work was a paper titled “On a Problem of Formal Logic” delivered to the London Mathematical Society and published in their Proceedings in 1930 shortly after his death. Misak tells us that Ramsey’s paper made two lasting contributions to the fields of mathematical logic and computer science. The first was to make headway on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz’s Entscheidungsproblem (from the seventeenth century), or decision problem, a topic revived in 1928 by David Hilbert, who asked whether or not there exists a procedure of giving a “yes-no” answer to whether a particular mathematical statement can be proven. (As it turns out, the decision problem would be shown to be unsolvable by two individuals working independently. One of them was Alan Turing who entered King’s as a mathematics student in 1931, one year after Ramsey’s death.) The second contribution of his logic paper would inspire a branch of mathematical combinatorics known as “Ramsey Theory” that studies conditions under which order, or patterns, must exist in a system. Misak concludes: “like so much of Ramsey’s work, Ramsey’s Theorem is a beautiful pure idea, but useful in the real world.... This transcendental idea is heavily employed by engineers” (p. 340).\n\nAfter quarreling with Ramsey in 1925, Wittgenstein left England for four years. He returned to Cambridge in what turned out to be Ramsey’s final year of life and the two quickly reconciled. Ramsey even served as Wittgenstein’s thesis advisor, with the forty-year-old being granted his doctorate degree based on the Tractatus as his thesis. Ramsey himself submitted the required summary paragraph to the university, explaining that the thesis proposes “to set a limit to what can be thought; or rather, not to what can be thought but to what can be expressed in language; for in order to set a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit, to think, that is, what cannot be thought. The limit can therefore only be drawn in language and what lies beyond it is simply nonsense” (p. 353). Misak reports that the two philosophers formed an extremely close bond, meeting almost daily in 1929. Much of Cambridge found them an odd couple, one friend describing Wittgenstein as looking “deeply unhappy all the time, [as if] ... the world was not his friend ... [while] in Frank’s moon face there was a sort of serenity and this wonderful great smile and this great laugh.” Wittgenstein would describe his conversations with Ramsey this way: “they’re like some energetic sport and conducted, I think, in a good spirit. There is something erotic and chivalrous about them” (p. 356). In his Philosophical Investigations (1953), published posthumously, Wittgenstein would credit Ramsey for helping him move away from many of his earlier beliefs and closer toward a form of naturalism or pragmatism espoused by Ramsey.\n\nRamsey himself published nothing in philosophy the last three years of his life but was known to be working on a book to be titled Truth and Probability, a much-expanded version of his paper of the same name. After his death, his friend Braithwaite published some of this work in The Foundations of Mathematics and Other Logical Essays in 1931, and in 1991 five edited chapters were published under the title On Truth. In his work, Ramsey tried to show “how truth is a property of our fallible human judgments, yet is objective” (p. 384). Misak says he presented “a general theory of truth on which a true belief is one which fits with the facts and with successful human action” (p. 393). As a philosopher, Misak is well positioned to critically review and assess Ramsey’s impact on the field of philosophy, both his considerable influence on Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and Ramsey’s own unpublished writings from the late twenties. She notes that at Braithwaite’s eightieth birthday party in 1980, the Oxford-trained philosopher A. J. Ayer is said to have remarked that Cambridge philosophers had spent the 1930s “chewing over Wittgenstein when they ought to have been chewing over Ramsey” (p. 410).\n\nIn November 1929, Ramsey fell sick from an unknown illness and died of jaundice on January 19, 1930, one month shy of his twenty-seventh birthday. Misak speculates that Ramsey might have died from Weil’s disease, caused by bacteria carried by animal urine, contracted from swimming in the River Cam during an unseasonably warm stretch in late October. His death was felt acutely by his family, friends, and colleagues. Keynes wrote his wife Lydia: “Frank Ramsey died last night.... He was in his way the greatest genius in college and such a dear creature besides.” His Bloomsbury friend Strachey wrote: “I always thought there was something of Newton about him—the ease and majesty of the thought—and the gentleness of the temperament” (p. 421). Misak ends her biography by giving Ramsey the last words, from a talk he delivered to his fellow Apostles in 1925: “In time the world will cool and everything will die, but that is a long time off still.... I find just now at least the world a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you ... [as] it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one’s activities” (p. 429).\n\nNotes\n\n[1].
