        "text": "One of my goals when launching this blog in 2011 was to revive interest in the important, but unfortunately neglected and largely forgotten, contributions to monetary and macroeconomic theory of Ralph Hawtrey. Two important books published within the last year have focused attention on Ralph Hawtrey: The Federal Reserve: A New History by Robert Hetzel, and The Capital Order by Clara Elizabeth Mattei.\n\nWhile Hetzel’s discussion of Hawtrey’s monetary theory of the Great Depression is generally positive, it criticizes him for discounting, unlike Milton Friedman, the efficacy of open-market operations in reviving aggregate demand. But Hetzel’s criticism relies on an incomplete reading of Hawtrey’s discussions of open-market operations. Mattei’s criticism of Hawtrey is very different from Hetzel’s narrow technical criticism. Mattei is clearly deeply hostile to Hawtrey, portraying him as the grey eminence behind the austerity policies of the British Treasury and the Bank of England in the 1920s both before and after Britain restored the prewar gold standard. Mattei holds Hawtrey uniquely responsible for providing the intellectual rationale for the fiscal and monetary policies that ruthlessly tolerated high unemployment to suppress inflation and hold down wages.\n\nI’ll address the inaccuracies in Hetzel’s discussion of Hawtrey and especially in Mattei’s deeply flawed misrepresentations of Hawtrey in future posts. In this post, I provide an overview of Hawtrey’s career drawn from papers I’ve written (two of which were co-authored by my friend Ron Batchelder) about Hawtrey included in my recent book, Studies in the History of Monetary Theory: Controversies and Clarifications (Chapters 10-14)\n\nRalph George Hawtrey, born in 1879, two years before his friend, fellow Cambridge man and Apostle, John Maynard Keynes, with whom he often disagreed, was in the 1920s and early 1930s almost as well-known as, and perhaps even more influential, at least among economists and policy-makers, than Keynes. Despite their Cambridge educations and careers in economics, as undergraduates, they both concentrated on mathematics[1] and philosophy and were deeply influenced by the Cambridge philosopher, G. E. Moore. Neither formally studied economics under Alfred Marshall.[2]\n\nPerhaps the last autodidact to make significant contributions to economic theory, Hawtrey began his study of economics only when preparing for the civil-service exam at the Treasury. Hawtrey’s Cambridge background, his friendship with Keynes, and the similarities between his own monetary theories and those of Marshall, Keynes and other Cambridge economists contributed to the widespread impression that Hawtrey had ties to the Cambridge school of economics, a connection Hawtrey denied. Hawtrey’s powerful analytical mind, his command of monetary history and deep and wide knowledge of monetary and business institutions, acquired by dint of intense independent study, led to a rapid rise in the Treasury bureaucracy, eventually becoming Director of Economic Studies in 1919, a position he held until he retired from the Treasury in 1945.\n\nCoincidentally, both Hawtrey and Keynes published their first books in 1913, Keynes writing about the reform of the Indian Currency system (Indian Currency and Finance) and Hawtrey propounding his monetary theory of the business cycle (Good and Bad Trade). A more substantive coincidence in their first books is that they both described a gold-exchange standard (resurrecting an idea described almost a century earlier by Ricardo in his Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency) in which gold coins do not circulate and the central bank holds reserves, not in gold, but in foreign exchange denominated in currencies legally convertible into gold.\n\nThe trajectory of Hawtrey’s carrier (like Keynes’s) was sharply upward after publication of his first book. Hawtrey’s reputation was further enhanced by important academic articles about the history of monetary institutions and the gold standard. Those studies were incorporated in Hawtrey’s most important work on monetary economics, Currency and Credit published in 1919, a profound treatise on monetary economics in which his deep theoretical insights were deployed to shed light on important events and developments in the history of monetary institutions. A resounding success, the volume becoming a standard work routinely assigned to students of money and banking for over a decade, establishing Hawtrey as one of the most widely read and frequently cited economists in the 1920s and even the 1930s.\n\nAlthough Keynes, by virtue of his celebrated book The Economic Consequences of the Peace became one of the most prominent public figures in Britain in the immediate postwar period, Hawtrey’s reputation among economists and policy makers likely overshadowed Keynes’s in the early 1920s. That distinction is exemplified by their roles at the 1922 Genoa Conference on postwar international cooperation and reconstruction.\n\nIn his writings about postwar monetary reconstruction, Hawtrey emphasized the necessity for international cooperation to restore international gold standard lest an uncoordinated restoration by individual countries with countries seeking to accumulate gold, thereby causing gold to appreciate and prices in terms of gold to fall. It was Hawtrey’s warnings, echoed independently by the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel, that caused the Treasury to recommend that planning for a coordinated restoration of the gold standard be included in agenda of the Genoa Conference.\n\nWhile Hawtrey was the intellectual inspiration for including restoration of gold standard on the agenda of the Genoa Conference, Keynes’s role at Genoa was journalistic, serving as a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. Keynes criticized the plan to reestablish an international gold standard even in the form of a gold-exchange standard that he and Hawtrey had described a decade earlier. Keynes observed that there was then only one nation with an effective gold standard, the United States. Conjecturing that the US, holding 40% of the world’s gold reserves, would likely choose to divest itself of at least part of its gold hoard, causing gold depreciation, Keynes argued that rejoining the gold standard would mean importing inflation from the United States. Keynes therefore recommended that Britain to adopt an independent monetary policy detached from gold to achieve a stable domestic price level.\n\nBut after it became clear that the US had no intention of unburdening itself of its huge gold holdings, Keynes reversed his rationale for opposing restoration of the gold standard. Given the depreciation of sterling against the dollar during and after World War I, the goal of restoring the prewar dollar-sterling parity of $4.86/pound would require Britain to endure even more deflation than it had already suffered following the sharp US deflation of 1920-21.\n\nWhen Winston Churchill, appointed Chancelor of the Exchequer in the new Conservative Government, announced in November 1924 that he would restore the gold standard at the prewar parity by April 1925, the pound appreciated against the dollar. But the market exchange rate with the dollar remained 10% below the prewar parity. Keynes began arguing against restoring the prewar parity because a further 10% deflation would impose an unacceptable hardship on an economy that had not recovered from the effects of the recession and high unemployment caused by earlier deflation.\n\nAfter personally consulting Keynes in person about his argument against restoring the prewar parity, Churchill also invited Hawtrey to hear his argument in favor of restoring the prewar parity. Hawtrey believed that doing so would bolster London’s position as the preeminent international financial center. But he also urged that, to avoid the dire consequences that Keynes warned would follow restoration of the prewar parity, the Bank of England reduce Bank Rate to promote economic expansion and employment. Given the unique position of London as the center of international finance, Hawtrey was confident that the Bank of England could ease its monetary policy and that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would ease their policies as well, thereby allowing the gold standard to be restored without significant deflation.\n\nSupported by his Treasury advisers including Hawtrey, Churchill restored the gold standard at the prewar dollar parity in April 1925, causing Keynes to publish his brutal critique of that decision in his pamphlet The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill. While the consequences were perhaps not as dire as Keynes had predicted, they were less favorable than Hawtrey had hoped, the Bank of England refusing to reduce Bank Rate below 5% as Hawtrey had urged. At any rate, after a brief downturn in the latter part of 1925, the British economy did expand moderately from 1926 through early 1929 with unemployment declining slightly before Britain, along with the rest of the world, plunged into the Great Depression in the second half of 1929.\n\nKeynes and Hawtrey again came into indirect opposition in the 1929 general election campaign, when Lloyd George, leader of the Liberal Party, proposed a program of public works to increase employment. In rejecting Lloyd George’s proposal, Churchill cited the “traditional Treasury view” that public spending simply displaced an equal amount of private spending, merely shifting spending from the private to the public sector without increasing total output and employment.\n\nThe source of “the traditional Treasury” view” was Hawtrey, himself, who had made the argument at length in a 1925 article in the Economic Journal which he had previously made in less detail in Good and Bad Trade. Replying to Churchill, Keynes and Hubert Henderson co-authored a pamphlet Can Lloyd George Do It supporting Lloyd George’s proposal and criticizing the Treasury View.\n\nKeynes and Hawtrey confronted each other in person when Hawtrey testified before the Macmillan Committee investigating the causes of high unemployment. As a member of the Committee, Keynes questioned Hawtrey about his argument that the Bank of England could have countered rising unemployment by reducing Bank Rate, seemingly exposing an inconsistency in Hawtrey’s responses to his questions. But, when considered in light of Hawtrey’s assumption that a reduction in Bank Rate by the Bank of England would have led to Federal Reserve and other central banks to reduce their interest rates rather than absorb further inflows of gold, the inconsistency is resolved (see this post for further explanation).\n\nAlthough Hawtrey had warned of the dreadful consequences of restoring the gold standard without coordination among central bank to avoid rapid accumulation of gold reserves, his warnings were disregarded when France returned to the gold standard in 1927 and began rapidly increasing its gold reserves in 1928. Hawtrey’s association with the Treasury view fostered the misimpression that, despite his unheeded advocacy of reducing Bank Rate to reduce unemployment, Hawtrey was oblivious to, or unconcerned by, the problem of unemployment. While Keynes often tried out new ideas, as he did with his neo-Wicksellian theory of the business cycle in his Treatise on Money only to abandon it in response to criticism and the changing economic environment of the Great Depression before writing his General Theory of Interest, Income and Money, Hawtrey stuck to the same basic theory developed in his first two books.\n\nWhile his output of new publications in the 1930s did not flag, Hawtrey’s reputation among economists and his influence in the Treasury gradually declined, especially after publication of Keynes’s General Theory as the attention of economists was increasingly occupied by an effort to comprehend and assimilate it into the received body of economic theory. By the time he retired from the Treasury in 1945 to become Professor of International Economics at the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Hawtrey was no longer at the cutting edge of the economics profession, and his work gradually fell from the view of younger economists.\n\nNevertheless, for the next two decades as he advanced to old age, Hawtrey continued to publish important works, mostly, but not exclusively concerning the conduct of British monetary policy, especially his lonely criticism of Britain’s 1947 devaluation of the pound. Elaborating on arguments advanced in his early writings, Hawtrey anticipated much of what would become known as the monetary approach to the balance of payments.\n\nGiven his monetary explanation of the Great Depression, it might have been expected that Monetarists, especially Milton Friedman, who, in the early 1950s, began his effort to develop a monetary theory of the Great Depression as an alternative to the Keynesian theory of a sudden decline in animal spirits that caused a stock-market crash and a drop in investment spending from which the private economy could not recover on its own, would have found Hawtrey’s explanation of the causes of the Great Depression to be worth their attention. However, one would search for Hawtrey’s name almost in vain in Friedman’s writings in general, and in his writings on the Great Depression, in particular. Certainly there was no recognition in the Monetarist literature on the Great Depression that a monetary theory of the Great Depression had actually been advanced by Hawtrey as the Great Depression was unfolding or that Hawtrey had warned in advance of the danger of the catastrophic deflation that would result from an uncoordinated restoration of the gold standard.\n\nYears after Friedman’s magnum opus The Monetary History of the US was published, various researchers, including Peter Temin, Barry Eichengreen, Ben Bernanke, Kenneth Mouré, Clark Johnson, Scott Sumner, and Ronald Batchelder and I, recognized the critical importance of the newly restored gold standard in causing the Great Depression. While most of the later authors cited Hawtrey’s writings, the full extent of Hawtrey’s contributions that fully anticipated all the major conclusions of the later research remains generally unrecognized in most of the recent literature on the Great Depression, while Friedman’s very flawed account of the Great Depression continues to be regarded by most economists and financial historians as authoritative if not definitive.\n\nIn a future post, I’ll discuss Hetzel’s account of Hawtrey’s explanation of the Great Depression. Unlike earlier Monetarists who ignored Hawtrey’s explanation entirely, Hetzel does credit Hawtrey with having provided a coherent explanation of the causes of the Great Depression, without acknowledging the many respects in which Hawtrey’s explanation is more complete and more persuasive than Friedman’s. He also argues that Friedman provided a better account of the recovery than Hawtrey, because Friedman, unlike Hawtrey, recognized the effectiveness of open-market operations which Hawtrey maintained would be ineffective in initiating a recovery in situations of what Hawtrey called credit deadlock.\n\nIn another post, I’ll discuss the highly critical, and I believe tendentious, treatment by Clara Elizabeth Mattei, of Hawtrey’s supposed role in devising and rationalizing the austerity policies of the British Treasury in the 1920s up to and including the Great Depression.\n\n[1] While Keynes was an accomplished mathematician who wrote an important philosophical and mathematical work A Treatise on Probability praised extravagantly by Bertrand Russell, Hawtrey’s mathematical skills were sufficiently formidable to have drawn the attention of Russell who included a footnote in his Principia Mathematica replying to a letter from Hawtrey."
