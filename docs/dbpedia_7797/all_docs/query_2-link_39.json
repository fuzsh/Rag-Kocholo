        "text": "The present work investigates the economic thought of the Cambridge Apostles, the famous élite intellectual group which counted J.M. Keynes among its members. In the first decades of the XX century the Apostles’ Society worked as a first-class think-tank where a cross-fertilization of feelings and ideas among some of the most brilliant minds of the time occurred in a peculiarly interdisciplinary context. G. E. Moore (1873-1958), one of the most influential British philosophers in the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, was the leader of the Apostles’ Society at the beginning of the century. His great book, Principia Ethica (1903), through a radical criticism of idealism, hedonistic utilitarianism, and empiricism, undermined the philosophical basis of Victorian conventional morality, and was enthusiastically greeted by the young Apostles. Moore indicated the states of consciousness consisting in the pleasure of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beauty as the greatest intrinsic goods; for them only he endorsed the performing any public or private duty. From the perspective of the historian of economic thought, there are three problems related to Moore’s impact on the Apostles. The first is the difference between the young and the mature Keynes’s adhesion to Moore’s teachings, as reported in My Early Beliefs (1938); the second relates to the divergent interpretations that the Apostles gave of Moore’s influence on them; the third contrasts Moore’s ‘unwordliness’ with the Apostles-economists’ intellectual and professional concerns. The first problem has been tackled by most authors who have studied Moore’s influence on Keynes, but the other two have been largely neglected. In particular, the paradox referred to in the third question has not been convincingly explained. Moreover, while in the last thirty years the philosophical foundations of Keynes’s economics have been the subject of a very extensive literature, and Moore’s influence has been duly acknowledged, the same cannot be said for Keynes’s fellow Apostles. The present research aims to assess the impact of such similar philosophical background on their views: it emphasizes, first, the simultaneous recurrence of ethical, social and political elements in the works of the Apostles-economists in the first decades of the XX century. Second, it points to some neglected features in Moore’s philosophy that shaped the Apostles’ concerns as well as their intellectual approach."
