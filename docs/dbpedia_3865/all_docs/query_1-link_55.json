        "text": "The study assessed the impact of irrigation schemes on reducing poverty in Chirumanzu District. The research gives a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of irrigation farming on poverty alleviation. Irrigation is a panacea to rainfall variability. This follows extreme weather conditions which have affected Sub Saharan Africa over the past decade. The research approach encompasses mixed methods. Out of a population of 116 farmers a sample of 35 was randomly selected. Data collection were administered through researcher administered questionnaires, focus group discussions, key informant interviews and observation. Furthermore, secondary data were acquired through document analysis. The study presents tables and graphs, through the use of Ms excel. The researcher established that Musena irrigation scheme has reduced vulnerability of farmers and enhanced livelihood outcomes. In the face of challenges which include pests and diseases, lack of financial and human capital. Thus, it can be concluded that irrigation farming has the potential to increase, crop yield and inherently reducing poverty. The study recommends increased capitalisation to farmers and more investment by the government in irrigation, research and extension services.\n\nClimate change is putting increasing stress on the livelihoods of people living in the world’s drylands. Smallholder irrigation has long been seen as a means of improving food security in areas with unpredictable rainfall, and is now being promoted as part of climate change adaptation strategies. The Ruti Irrigation Scheme in Zimbabwe was begun by Oxfam in 2009 with these objectives in mind. This report examines the findings of two evaluations of the project and shows that the irrigation scheme has had more significant social and economic impacts than those measured by a quantitative study alone. However, the positive impacts for wellbeing have not been as extensive as originally hoped – having been affected by extreme weather events and the decision to reserve scarce water for use by sugar estates further downstream. This suggests that while smallholder irrigation schemes can provide important local benefits, these are threatened not only by the usual difficulties associated with their implementation, but also by the greater challenges posed by climate change and the resource conflicts that are being exacerbated as a result. These are problems which require significant changes in policy and practice at catchment-wide, national, and international levels.\n\nIncreasing food production by developing small-scale irrigation schemes is a requirement for tackling household food insecurity. Strategies, such as the World Vision, Enhancing Nutrition, Stepping Up Resilience and Enterprise, have been established to enhance food availability in the drought-prone Burirano Ward 4, Chipinge, Zimbabwe, through the drip irrigation intervention. This study analysed the extent to which the drip intervention has increased food production, abilities, income and nutrition of households. Consequently, the key factors impacting the performance of the drip irrigation scheme were assessed. The study utilised a mixed-method convergent parallel design, drawing from semi-structured questionnaires administered on a census of 40 household beneficiaries as well as a focus group discussion of five key informants directly linked to the Chidzadza irrigation scheme, Burirano Ward 4, Chipinge, Zimbabwe. The findings show that the drip irrigation scheme significantly increased households’ food production abilities, nutrition and income. The main factors responsible for the success of the drip irrigation scheme are cheap labour from household members and agriculture extension support. Issues that prevent the success of the scheme include erratic rain supplies and damaged water pipes. Strategies to increase household food production through the drip irrigation scheme include maintenance of water pipes, an increase in water catchment areas and water availability through solarpowered borehole systems.\n\nAmongst a plethora of challenges facing the African continent today is the food security issue. Close to 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are food insecure (Bremner, 2012). A number of reasons have been advanced to explain the food insecurity situation of which inter-alia include climate change, low food and agricultural productivity and production. This article is centred on assessing the use of treadle pumps micro irrigation technologies strategy in an attempt to counter low food and agricultural productivity in Umzingwane district of Zimbabwe. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used with data being collected through questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. A total of 100 smallholder farmers participated in the study which covered 6 Wards. Study findings reveal that the use of treadle pumps improves household food security though this inevitably comes at a cost to the natural environment. This is largely due to the way in which t..."
