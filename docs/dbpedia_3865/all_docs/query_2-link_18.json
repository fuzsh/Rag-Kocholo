At age two on July 11, 2019, Valiant was seen “chasing after” a group of Bigg’s killer whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca until the orcas left the area.\n\nOn June 26 last year, ­Victoria-based Eagle Wing Tours observed Bigg’s killer whale T125A, a large male, ­pushing Valiant as some younger orcas attempted to get on top of the whale, but Valiant turned sharply and went on the ­offensive, chasing the group off.\n\nGless said the “extreme ­scarring” on Valiant’s tail ­suggests the whale might have survived a brutal orca attack at just a few months old.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Did that initial encounter shape the way Valiant interacts with orcas today? The message is pretty clear — don’t mess with ­Valiant,” said Gless.\n\nTransient orcas — the ­largest species in the dolphin family — eat seals and sea lions and will hunt and eat younger whale calves, said Gless.\n\nScientists have shown in studies on both coasts of North America that orcas are also known to harass adult humpbacks — and even grab a quick chunk of meat off them.\n\nOrcas would seem to have the advantage of superior speed and four rows of teeth. Humpbacks, which are baleen whales, don’t have teeth — only screened mouths that filter water for krill and other feed.\n\nBut humpbacks are no ­pushovers, said Gless.\n\nAdult humpbacks weigh between 30 and 50 tonnes, some growing up to 60 metres in length, said Gless.\n\nA humpback’s dorsal fin is extremely powerful and its ­pectoral flippers are the largest of any whale, measuring up to five metres long.\n\nOften encrusted with sharp barnacles, the flippers are another deterrent against orca attacks, said Gless. The aggressive trumpeting, or short, sharp bursts of breathing, are also noted in the breeding ground when males vie for females.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGless said based on the documented scars on the tails of humpbacks in the Salish Sea, at least 25 per cent have had encounters with orcas at some point in their lives, usually at a young age.\n\nBut even as humpbacks grow older and heavier, orca attacks do happen, she said.\n\nHumpbacks consider orcas an arch enemy, said Gless.\n\n“There have been many ­documented cases around the world of ­humpbacks protecting other types of whales,” she said.\n\n“Our [whale-watching] members have also seen humpbacks stopping orca sea lion hunts.”\n\nGless said whether the ­humpbacks are ­trying to help other mammals or ­acting aggressively for ­self-­preservation is unknown.\n\nIn 2016, a team of researchers from Oregon State University found 30 cases from around the world in which humpbacks attacked orcas when they were pursuing whales and other ­mammals.\n\n“The humpback whale is, to our knowledge, the only cetacean that deliberately approaches attacking mammal-eating killer whales and can drive them off,” said Dr. Robert Pitman, a marine ecologist and co-author of the report.\n\n“We suggest that the evolution of the humpback’s massive pectoral flippers may have given it an advantage over killer whales and perhaps altered the balance of power in their interactions.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Oregon State paper said the humpback’s formidable appendages, when used in concert with the flukes, “afford humpbacks with fore and aft, offensive and defensive weaponry — a capability that is unique among living baleen whales.”\n\nThe incident this week comes after whale watchers report record numbers of Bigg’s orca and humpback sightings in the Salish Sea over the past year.\n\nMore news, fewer ads, faster load time: Get unlimited, ad-lite access to The Vancouver Sun, The Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.
