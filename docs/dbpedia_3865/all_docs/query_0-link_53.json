What is surprising\n\nvillagers is the sudden shift to peace by a party known for a history of\n\nviolence and intimidation.\n\nThe 2008 political violence was the worst episode of violence that is still\n\nfresh in the minds Muzarabani villagers.\n\nAnd now, those who have been busy addressing meetings include Zanu PF\n\nprovincial youth chairperson Gilbert Kanhutu.\n\nIn an interview in Harare recently, Kanhutu admitted that they were\n\nspreading the message of peace in the whole of Mashonaland Province,\n\nstressing that Zanu PF wants to go to elections without violence tags.\n\n“People are going out saying Zanu PF is violent, so we want to show that we\n\nunderstand the importance of peace,” said Kanhutu.\n\n“We want to take people from the opposition and show them the good things\n\ndone by Zanu PF, there is no need to deny them food aid and they should know\n\nthat Zanu PF is the best party.\n\n“We don’t have to campaign intimidating people, we are promising peace,”\n\nKanhutu said.\n\nThe party has a culture of addressing and briefing its membership on the\n\nresolutions and proceedings from the annual conference or congress.\n\nVillagers in Muzarabani said previous annual conferences resulted in\n\nincreased violence targeted at MDC supporters in the area.\n\n“Each time they came from the conference or congress, they would be on the\n\nhigh and would promise to deal with MDC supporters and we are surprised at\n\nthe sudden toning down of such calls,” Freddy Matonhodze, a villager in\n\nMuzarabani said.\n\nMatonhodze added that the Zanu PF annual conference had the power to shape\n\nthe flow of politics in Muzarabani.\n\n“Previously they would start from the time they disembark from buses and for\n\nus, it was one of the most challenging moments as we would be forced to\n\neither disappear or seek refuge in some secret places waiting for them to\n\ncool down,” Matonhodze added.\n\nAt one of the feedback meetings held last year, Zanu PF leadership told\n\nvillagers that if ever any of their members was going to assault an MDC\n\nsupporter, he/she would face justice without support or help from the party.\n\n“We say no to violence, but we don’t want you to interact with them. It is\n\nnot allowed to engage in violence but we will find ways of dealing with\n\nthem,” Kanhutu was heard saying at the feedback meeting at Muzarabani Growth\n\nPoint.\n\nKanhutu is also reported to have appealed for non-politicised distribution\n\nof food aid in all villages.\n\nKanhutu told villagers that they were prepared for peaceful elections and\n\nwill not engage in acts of violence.\n\nIn Ward 7, Hwata area, the local leadership addressed a feedback meeting\n\nencouraging party members to give food to everyone regardless of political\n\nmembership.\n\nOne of the villagers who attended the meeting said the party leadership,\n\nincluding Kanhutu, said everyone was supposed to get seed regardless of\n\ntheir political affiliation.\n\nSome villagers said this was a major climb-down because it was the first\n\ntime Zanu PF leadership in Muzarabani had campaigned for peace.\n\n“We were surprised, it had become common that after their annual conference,\n\nviolence threats would escalate.\n\n“We could not believe it, when we heard them preaching peace throughout\n\ntheir address, we thought they were going to resort back to their usual\n\nsong.\n\n“We wish these could be genuine calls because it helps us settle down,” a\n\nvillager said.\n\nAt Hoya Business Centre in Ward 17, Faiton Mupinga who is the district\n\nchairperson together with Tafira Mahau and James Chibau addressed a feedback\n\nmeeting urging party supporters to maintain peace and share Grain Marketing\n\nBoard (GMB) grain loan scheme with MDC members.\n\nThe same message of peace was delivered to Muringazuva area Ward 8 and\n\nDambakurima area Ward 5.\n\nIn these areas, the Zanu PF local leadership told villagers that the\n\nreferendum was going to be yardstick for the party’s popularity.\n\nHowever, in Kaerezi village Ward 23, Amon Mavedzenge a Zanu PF youth\n\naddressed a meeting warning MDC supporters that “zvakaitika 2008 zvishoma”.\n\nVillagers who quizzed the sincerity of Zanu PF calling for peace said it was\n\nhard to tell if the calls were genuine because there were still incidents\n\nwhere MDC supporters were being intimidated and harassed by Zanu PF members.\n\nItai Charumbuka, MDC Muzarabani District chairperson, said on October 27,\n\n2012 he was forced out of a commuter omnibus by touts believed to be Zanu PF\n\nmembers.\n\n“A tout came and told me to get off the kombi as the driver was\n\nuncomfortable taking off with me\n\n“After I refused to disembark, all the other passengers were told to change\n\ninto another kombi leaving me alone,” Charumbuka said.\n\nCharumbuka added that the kombi driver finally came himself and instructed\n\nthat I should leave the kombi, in the process inciting other passengers to\n\nforce me out.\n\n“My crime was that I was going to attend an MDC rally where the party\n\npresident was due to address at Chaona Growth Point,” Charumbuka added.\n\nVillagers also raised allegations that Zanu PF was interfering in the\n\nrecruitment of workers at cotton companies operating at Muzarabani Growth\n\nPoint.\n\nBut a party member who did not want to be named dismissed the allegations\n\nsaying that all the people in Muzarabani were Zanu PF supporters.\n\n“If you ask any person you meet here in Muzarabani, they are Zanu PF\n\nsupporters, so as long as those employed at the cotton companies are from\n\nMuzarabani, they are Zanu PF supporters,” he said.\n\nCommenting on the reports of partisan recruitment of workers at cotton\n\ncompanies, the soft spoken Kanhutu said he is a worker at the company and\n\nhas every reason to employ those he likes.\n\n“As a worker of Cottco and as a leader in Zanu PF I will take advantage\n\nbecause it’s sort of campaigning, if Tendai Biti is to have a company he\n\ncannot employ a wrong person because he may be looking for support.\n\n“I am a leader in Muzarabani and this is an opportunity to give back to the\n\npeople who made me a provincial youth chairman,” he said.\n\nKanhutu added that he does not recruit Zanu PF members arguing that they\n\nmake announcement on days of recruitment.\n\n“I only announce that on this day we are recruiting workers and people come\n\nand we employ them, we recruit from as far as Chadereka, Kanyemba Chiwenga,”\n\nsaid Kanhutu.\n\nMuzarabani district is still regarded as a “one-party state” continues to\n\nrally behind Zanu PF and the party controls most rural district councils\n\nwith the MDC having only one councillor.\n\nThe district is volatile as MDC supporters claim that Zanu PF systematically\n\nmonitors virtually all institutions from council, cotton companies,\n\nteachers and agricultural extension services workers to touts. -

The area has an\n\nestimated population of 60 000 and is largely a cotton farming district.\n\nAccording to locals in the area, Muzarabani means a frequently flooded area.\n\nIn an almost similar style the area was flooded by political violence which\n\nleft trails of destruction and deserted homes across the district.\n\nAccording to a report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre\n\n(IDPMC), the displacement of MDC activists and ordinary voters in 2008 was\n\nnot merely a by-product of violence, but was part of a systematic attempt to\n\nchange Zimbabwe’s political landscape by driving people away from the wards\n\nthey were registered to vote in and to ensure that those affected by the\n\nabuses cannot return home.\n\nAn investigation into the issue of displaced voters in Muzarabani revealed\n\nthe majority of people who were displaced in the 2008 political violence\n\nnever returned to their homes and there is no hope they will return before\n\nan election is held.\n\nPresident Robert Mugabe’s call for elections in June 2013 indirectly means\n\nthe political environment is conducive for an election to be held.\n\nParties are gearing up for an election, but the question remains, are people\n\nready for an election?\n\nThe environment in Muzarabani proves otherwise as there is no hope that\n\nthose who fled will return to vote for fear of a repeat of the 2008\n\nviolence.\n\nItai Charumbuka, a victim of political violence who later returned home\n\nafter the 2008 terror campaign said he is still living in fear of a repeat\n\nof the madness.\n\n“As of now the Zanu PF youths who terrorised us are on a low profile but\n\nthey will be monitoring our movements. When the talk of elections intensify\n\nthey will ravage like fire.\n\n“I am always in fear of what may befall me if elections come. I was once a\n\nvictim and villagers were warned not to associate with me,” he told the\n\nDaily News on Sunday.\n\nMedium Chidhindi, a 56-year-old displaced voter from Machaya Ward 3 who is\n\nstill being haunted by the experiences she had in 2008 expressed no interest\n\nof going back home before an election is held.\n\nHer homestead was destroyed by Zanu PF youths who were terrorising people in\n\nthe area.\n\nHer property was burnt down and her herd of cattle was taken to the Zanu PF\n\nbase to feed the youths.\n\n“I loved my rural home but I don’t think I have the guts to go back there, I\n\nam rather safe here in the city. I had invested a lot in building my\n\nhomestead but I lost everything I worked for in a few minutes,” she said.\n\nChidhindi went back to try and settle after the run-off but she was attacked\n\nagain and left her rural home for good.\n\nHer son Josphat Chidhindi, 22, was attacked by an axe when he had gone to\n\ncheck on a few beasts they had left.\n\nChidhindi’s homestead has dilapidated and there is no hope of resurgence.\n\nThe house was destroyed to the ground. Remains of property destroyed five\n\nyears ago are scattered around the yard.\n\nNorman Chamunorwa, 40, also from Machaya Ward fled in May 2008 after his\n\nhouses were burnt by Zanu PF youths.\n\nIn March 2012 he would have wantecd to go back and start over but was told\n\nby his headman Bernard Chibaya that he no longer had a place in the village\n\nbecause he was a trouble causer.\n\n“I was told by the headman that my field and stand were given to someone\n\nelse because I was causing havoc in the village by supporting the MDC,” he\n\nsaid.\n\nNorman was a registered voter in Muzarabani but he is now living in Harare\n\nwhere he found refuge after escaping death threats in his village.\n\nSitembile Chinzou (65) and her family fled from their homestead in July 2008\n\nafter being severely beaten and accused of creating a Harvest House in\n\nMuzarabani.\n\nHer homestead was burnt and an engine for one of their grinding mills was\n\nthrown into a well.\n\nWith experience being the best teacher, Sitembile said she will not go back\n\nand be a voter in Muzarabani.\n\nSitembile said her husband, Freddy Chinzou, passed on in February 2012 due\n\nto stress and the injuries he sustained from the beatings.\n\n“My husband was the MDC chairperson in our ward. The Zanu PF youths said\n\nthey had come to destroy the MDC Headquarters, Harvest House; we had created\n\nin the area. We were told to go and live in Britain with Tsvangirai,” she\n\nsaid.\n\nSince 2008, Sitembile said she was unable to enjoy her conjugal rights with\n\nher husband who is now late because she sustained severe injuries after she\n\nwas assaulted on her private parts and back.\n\n“I was forced to open up my legs and was beaten with a baton stick on my\n\nprivate parts,” she said.\n\nVillagers who were displaced in Muzarabani have not come to terms with the\n\nexperiences they had in 2008.Without assurance that a recurrence of the 2008\n\nterror campaign will not see the light of day many have vowed not to go back\n\nto their homes.\n\nTheir lives have changed for the worst, their cattle, goats, chickens were\n\nslaughtered during the 2008 madness.\n\nThey all confirmed that life is terrible in their new locations.\n\nAnd, hopes are fading fast that they will ever return to their old homes.\n\nNo hope of return for displaced votersRegistrar General Tobaiwa Mudede has\n\nbeen accused of oiling the Zanu PF election rigging plots in the ensuing\n\nelections. - Gamuchirayi Masiyiwa\n\nMtshabezi water finally reaches Bulawayo\n\nhttp://www.dailynews.co.zw\n\nSunday, 13 January 2013 12:39\n\nHARARE - The much-awaited Mtshabezi Dam water is finally coming to the city\n\nof Bulawayo in a move likely to bolster water supply, a Cabinet minister has\n\nsaid.\n\nThis comes at a time when the project, which has been under construction for\n\nyears, has missed several deadlines.\n\n“I am happy to say that finally water has reached Bulawayo,” minister of\n\nWater Resources Management Samuel Sipepa Nkomo told a news conference in\n\nBulawayo.\n\nNkomo said the engineers were finally able to release water into the Lower\n\nNcema Dam.\n\n“As of today we were able to address the issue of leaks. The engineers have\n\nalso released water into Lower Ncema,” an upbeat Nkomo said.\n\nAssistant director of Engineering in the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) Ian\n\nMthunzi said: “I was there and I saw it with my own eyes. It is a great day\n\nfor Bulawayo and we are very grateful.”\n\nErratic power supply at the pump station had put the project in limbo, but\n\nhas since been resolved, according to Nkomo.\n\n“We are using synchronised generators and they are working as I speak. To\n\nbolster power supply, poles and wiring for electricity have already reached\n\nthe pump house,” he said.\n\nHowever, Nkomo said Mtshabezi water was not going to significantly reduce\n\nthe water shedding which was increased last to 96 hours per week.\n\n“The reduction of water shedding is up to BCC. But we are hoping that water\n\nfrom Mtshabezi will reduce the water rationing,” Nkomo said.\n\nBulawayo residents have been subjected to 96 hours of water shedding every\n\nweek which has caused many to go for days without water, while fears of\n\ndisease outbreak grips the city.\n\nBut with Mtshabezi water coming to the “City of Kings”, Bulawayo residents\n\nare hopeful that water problems will be a thing of the past. - Nyasha\n\nChingono\n\nMasvingo MDC youths demand 10 parly seats\n\nhttp://www.dailynews.co.zw\n\nSunday, 13 January 2013 12:34\n\nMASVINGO - Youths in Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s MDC Masvingo\n\nProvince have demanded 10 of the total 26 parliamentary seats.\n\nThe youth assembly resolved at a provincial youth executive meeting held at\n\nthe party offices yesterday that youths should be actively involved in the\n\npolitical field.\n\nMasvingo youth wing provincial chairperson Oliver Chirume said the seats\n\nwould be reserved for youths, even in the forthcoming primary elections.\n\n“We held a youth executive meeting here and we resolved that the party\n\nleadership should reserve 10 seats for the youths on the total 26 seats in\n\nthe whole province,” Chirume said. “We want the youth to be given this quota\n\nbecause of late they have been sidelined.\n\n“And in these 10 seats only youths will contest against each other in\n\nprimaries. We do not want to see the elderly guys coming to challenge us in\n\nthe seats.”\n\nHe added that by reserving the seats, the move would guarantee increased\n\nyouth participation in Parliament and national processes.\n\n“Youths should be more involved in national processes and nation building\n\nhence the need for a chance to participate in politics.”\n\nChirume said gone were the days when youths would be used as running dogs\n\nand tools of political violence by the elderly politicians.\n\nIn the meeting, the youths agreed that they would be moving into\n\nconstituencies to carry out massive voter education programmes to persuade\n\nyoung people to participate in elections and support their counterparts\n\nseeking political office.\n\nWith the 10 seats, he said the MDC will be able to wrestle the 12 seats that\n\nwere won by Zanu PF in the previous general polls held in 2008.\n\nMDC won 14 seats and the youths believe that their participation in the\n\nforthcoming elections could whitewash Zanu PF.\n\n“If we are given the chance to have the ten seats, we assure the party that\n\nthe 12 seats in the hands of Zanu PF will be ours and we will whitewash the\n\nageing party,” Chirume said. “We have the energy and vitality to go into the\n\nconstituencies and convince the electorate that real change is coming.” -\n\nGodfrey Mtimba\n\nMinister in $1,2bn mess\n\nhttp://www.dailynews.co.zw/\n\nSunday, 13 January 2013 13:03\n\nHARARE - An international consortium of investors has said it was suspending\n\nR10 billion (approximately $1,2 billion) investment in southern Zimbabwe,\n\napparently because of pervasive corruption and demands for bribes by Cabinet\n\nministers.\n\nThe announcement came after a rare statement by the consortium, represented\n\nby the Cape Town-based businessman Peter Kohler that he had decided not to\n\nsolve problems by slipping money under the table.\n\nThe international investment consortium had raised the cash to establish a\n\nhuge tourist facility in the arid Matabeleland South, one of the poorest\n\nareas of the country boasting of a bird sanctuary and game reserve.\n\nPresident Robert Mugabe has acknowledged that corruption is a national\n\nproblem, and curbing official corruption is one of the goals of his tenure\n\nif he wins re-election.\n\nAt his party’s conclave in Gweru last month, Mugabe railed against his\n\nofficials often used to extort prospective investors, and said the problem\n\nhad been brought to his attention by former South Africa president Thabo\n\nMbeki.\n\nBeyond embarrassing Mugabe’s administration, the international consortium’s\n\nstance could mark an economic turning point if it leads to more foreign\n\nbusinesses speaking out against corruption here.\n\nThe decision is particularly damning for Zimbabwe as the consortium, which\n\ndeclined to be named, runs businesses in dozens of countries around the\n\nworld and is hardly thin-skinned when it comes to dealing with\n\nbureaucracies.\n\nSimon Spooner, a spokesperson for the consortium, said they had decided to\n\nkeep the matter under wraps hoping to rescue the R10 billion deal that could\n\nhave immensely benefited Matabeleland South.\n\nAccording to Spooner, the project would have created 10 000 jobs and\n\nprovided huge infrastructural development for the local people; electricity,\n\nnew villages, feedlots, irrigation, an international airport, power station\n\nand a large number of exclusive lodges and a 400 unit condominium complex on\n\nthe Shashe River.\n\nIt was based on four memorandum of understandings (MoUs) with the local\n\npeople and communities of Matshatshuta, Hwali and Tuli Circle and the\n\nNational Parks, hence the consent of Environment and Natural Resources\n\nminister Francis Nhema was required.\n\n“Things stumbled along and it would seem that underhand dealings were\n\ndemanded,” Spooner said.\n\nThe talks were said to have involved Home Affairs minister Kembo Mohadi and\n\nZapu president Dumiso Dabengwa, an ex-minister of Home Affairs, to persuade\n\nNhema to get the money invested ahead of the November 2012 deadline.\n\nMohadi was unreachable for comment yesterday.\n\nBut Dabengwa said he had advised the investor where to go and did not get\n\ninvolved beyond that.\n\n“I advised him how to go about it,” Dabengwa told the Daily News on Sunday\n\nyesterday.\n\n“I don’t know how far he had gone. But it was certainly a huge project. It\n\nwas also going to open a short cut to Johannesburg on the Kezi road.”\n\nUnder the deal, the communities were going to be granted ownership of the\n\nwhole investment and benefit from about 10 000 jobs.\n\n“From that point on (in 2010), much transpired until finally Nhema put a\n\nstop to it by stating, ‘If you think that people will be given title, you\n\ncan forget it’,” Spooner said.\n\n“Five MoUs needed to be signed and minister Nhema stood in the way,” he\n\nsaid.\n\n“He vehemently objected to title of the infrastructure being given to the\n\nfour local communities.\n\n“The discussion to unlock the process involved none other than Dabengwa and\n\nme at one stage and Mohadi. It was scuppered.”\n\nNhema yesterday insisted he had nothing to do with the deal, which he said\n\nshould have been handled by the Zimbabwe Investment Authority.\n\n“I don’t have anything to do with that. Did he go through the Zimbabwe\n\nInvestment Centre?\n\n“They are approved there. We deal with policy issues,” he told the Daily\n\nNews on Sunday yesterday.\n\nThe consortium cited the unpredictability of administrative processes in\n\nZimbabwe as the basis of the decision to pull out the R10 billion\n\ninvestment.\n\nIt is just the latest case of bribe-taking and shakedowns by Zimbabwean\n\nofficials that had become intolerable.\n\nThe consortium’s announcement came after exhausting all channels, but took a\n\nprincipled decision not to pay bribes in Zimbabwe.\n\nForeign executives have complained privately for decades that bribery is an\n\nintegral part of Zimbabwean business culture, often tolerated or silently\n\nrebuffed.\n\nIn fact, foreign companies retain legions of lawyers so they can adhere\n\nscrupulously to regulations in hopes of avoiding providing an opening for\n\nbribe-seeking officials.\n\nZimbabwe has fared badly on Transparency International’s corruption\n\nperception index (CPI), ranked 163 in 176 countries polled worldwide,\n\naccording to the December 5, 2012 CPI.\n\nThe corruption has become so endemic that traffic police routinely take cash\n\nbribes.\n\nHowever, it is the next level of official venality, so-called administrative\n\ncorruption that is most harmful to business and authorities with the power\n\nto halt business activity are blatantly demanding bribes, a move that has\n\nriled even Mugabe. - Gift Phiri, Political Editor\n\nMarange diamond fields in Zimbabwe: Zanu–PF’s enrichment project?\n\nhttp://www.newstimeafrica.com\n\nBernard Chiketo\n\nJANUARY 13, 2013\n\nZimbabwe’s Marange diamond mining fields are being governed by a predatory\n\nZanu – PF elite using its access to state power to enrich itself, against\n\nthe interests of the people as a whole, acting in collusion with the mining\n\ncompanies.\n\nAt least this is South Africa’s former President, Thabo Mbeki confessed fear\n\nduring Zimbabwe’s Diamond Conference in Victoria Falls early last November.\n\n“The country’s political leadership, including all parties which serve in\n\nthe current inclusive Government established because of the GPA (Global\n\nPolitical Agreement), must absolutely ensure that the diamond mining\n\nindustry is not governed by a predatory elite which uses its access to state\n\npower to enrich itself, against the interests of the people as a whole,\n\nacting in collusion with the mining companies,” Mbeki advised.\n\nFor Finance Minister, Tendai Biti, who is Movement for Democratic Change\n\n(MDC – T) Secretary General the reality could even be worse!

This economy needs every resource it can\n\nget including diamond revenue,” Biti had said earlier in the year.\n\nTafadzwa Musarara, Resources Exploitation Watch Director, a pro-Zanu – PF\n\ncivic organisation told a Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG)\n\nconvened diamond conference held in Harare late in November that mining\n\nfirms were protected by law not make public their balance sheets as they\n\nwere registered as private limited companies hence the nation had no reason\n\nto complain of any ‘opaqueness’.\n\nMusarara further noted that Treasury ought to be more realistic in its\n\nexpectations of revenue flow from Marange saying the firms were still\n\nrecuperating their infrastructural investments adding that the firms must\n\neven be commended for their current contributions.\n\nPresenting his Mid-Term Fiscal policy in July, Biti again blamed poor\n\nrevenue inflows from diamonds from the Marange fields noting that of US$600\n\nmillion he had expected from diamond sales this year, only US$41, 6 million\n\nhad been received during the first half of the year, forcing him to cut his\n\n2012 national budget from US$4 billion to US$3, 4 billion.\n\nBiti even protests that due process was not followed in awarding the\n\nconcession prejudicing the country of millions of dollars and has been\n\npushing for the cancellation of all existing claims through a Diamond\n\nControl Revenue Bill of 2011 which seeks to place the fields under the joint\n\nsupervision of the finance and mining ministries.\n\nSection 4 (1) (a) of the draft Bill states: “Any mineral right, which was in\n\nforce under the Mines Act immediately before the fixed date (date of\n\ncommencement of Act) and which authorised the grantee or holder to prospect\n\nfor additionally, or alternatively, to mine or work any alluvial deposit of\n\ndiamonds, shall, to the extent of such authorisation, be void.” Section 6\n\n(4) (b) of the Bill adds that “The minister, with the approval of the\n\nminister responsible for mines, may, by written notice to the (claim)\n\nholder, fix appropriate terms and conditions subject to which mining\n\noperations may continue on the holder’s mining location.”\n\nZimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) owns the 80,000 hectares\n\ndiamond fields which geologists estimate to contain two to seven billion\n\ncarats of raw diamonds and currently contributing up to 25 per cent of the\n\nglobal diamond output.\n\nWhile ZMDC wholly owns Marange Resources Ltd it has 50 – 50 joint ventures\n\nforeigners in the other three companies — Diamond Mining Corporation (DMC),\n\nMbada Diamonds and Anjin Investments. According to human rights group,\n\nGlobal Witness, Mbada Diamonds’ board is chaired by Zimbabwe’s former Air\n\nVice Marshall Robert Mhlanga while Anjin Investments, is a joint venture\n\nbetween a little-known Zimbabwean company, Matt Bronze, and a Chinese\n\nconstruction company. Anjin’s board also Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Defence\n\npermanent secretary, two commissioners of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, and\n\ncurrent and former officers of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.\n\nOf all the companies Biti is particularly critical of Anjin which he accuses\n\nof not remitting anything to Treasury despite being the largest diamond\n\nproducer on the Marange diamond fields.\n\nHowever, the Chinese- owned diamond producer —which has ventured into the\n\nhospitality and aviation industries — says it has discharged its statutory\n\nobligations and had remitted US$30 million to Treasury adding that the\n\nfinance minister was scapegoating them for over-estimating possible diamond\n\nrevenue by basing his US$600 million projection on the assumption that a\n\ncarat of diamond was worth US$1,300 when, in fact, its average value is\n\nUS$60.\n\n“It is either he is untruthful, incompetent or illiterate. He made the\n\nblunder and miscalculated. He must be man enough and admit that he made a\n\nmistake,” Anjin board member Munyaradzi Machacha said.\n\nMines Minister Obert Mpofu also maintains that the mining industry was\n\ncontributing enough and was the biggest contributor to Zimbabwe’s economy.\n\n“Biti is a liar. The mining industry is the largest contributor to the\n\ncountry’s economy,” Mpofu a Mining, Engineering and Transport (Mine Entra)\n\nconference in Bulawayo following Biti’s mid-Term Fiscal Policy Review.\n\nMpofu is also accused of directly benefiting from the Marange diamond fields\n\nand is famed to own half of Zimbabwe resort town of Victoria Falls.\n\nZanu – PF politburo member, former Minister of Mines and current\n\nParliamentary Committee on Mines and Energy chairperson, Edward Chininga, in\n\na government local daily the Chronicle, blamed the current sanctions regime\n\nfor the limited revenue flow from Marange as they are ‘creating loopholes\n\nfor illegal trade and fiscal leakages,’ a muted confirmation of shadowy\n\ndiamond deals in the sector. All four firms were slapped with US sanctions\n\nas they are under ZMDC a primary target of the financial restrictions.\n\nIn Chininga’s call for the removal of the US sanctions recently he said\n\nsince the four companies are now fully compliant with the Kimberly Process\n\nCertification Scheme (KPCS) which the US itself chaired until recently\n\nshould lift the restrictions.\n\n“Therefore,” Chininga said of the US, “it should not at the same time create\n\nan environment that promotes illegal sale of diamonds through financial\n\nsanctions that force companies to circumvent normal export channels. These\n\nfinancial restrictions and sanctions create loopholes for illegal, fiscal\n\nleakages and loss of revenues to Zimbabwe.”\n\nThis explains why perhaps the balance sheets of the firms operating in\n\nMarange remain so opaque.\n\nEddie Cross a Bulawayo South Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Member of\n\nParliament speaking at the CNRG conference also claimed the Minister of\n\nMines was covering up Zanu – PF’s illicit diamond deals in the past five\n\nyears.\n\nCross said Mpofu misrepresented to Parliament that Zimbabwe had realised\n\nonly $200 million from the sale of raw diamonds over five years in which\n\ntime total payments to Treasury had been over $174 million imputing that the\n\nminers had paid out most of the money earned from the sale of diamonds\n\nsomething he said was patently false.\n\nCross even argues that Zanu – PF strategically positioned the current mining\n\nfirms to secure the Marange fields to assure the party of funding on the eve\n\nof its entry into a government of national unity (GNU) in which they were to\n\nlose control of Treasury and the social welfare ministry which has the\n\nNational Social Security Authority (NSSA) – a cash cow, to his party.\n\nHe said there was no hope that there could even be transparency in Marange\n\nfor as long as the current actors retained their licences which forms his\n\nparty’s support for the nationalisation of the fields which Biti has been\n\npushing for. “In 2011, the Parliament of Zimbabwe adopted a motion without\n\ndissent, that the Marange diamond fields be nationalised. It is pleasing to\n\nsee that the Minister of Finance has announced that that is exactly what is\n\nintended under the new Diamond Act and that we can expect action shortly,”\n\nhe said.\n\nWhile Partnership Africa Canada (PAC) a key civic organisation in the KPCS\n\nin a report published last month claim that Zimbabwe may have lost up to\n\nUS$2 billion over the past three years Cross claims that this year alone\n\nmore than 37 million carats of diamonds worth over $4billion have been\n\nextracted from Marange.\n\nCross, an economist said while his estimates appeared outrageous they were\n\nin fact conservative arguing that they were based on actual figures he\n\nobtained during his own private investigations. However his colleague in MDC\n\nand Mpofu’s deputy in the ministry of mines, Gift Chimanikire told Voice of\n\nAmerica that while he was unsure of the source of Cross’s figures they\n\nseemed “too exaggerated.”\n\nCross said in 2011 he got copies of actual daily production figures for\n\nMarange Resources (Pvt.) limited which showed that in 2009, the company\n\nprocessed 25000 tonnes of ore/sand producing an average of 19.86 carats per\n\ntonne which he then used to generate his estimates.\n\nEvidence of income that is not being accounted for strongly indicating it is\n\nemanating from Marange includes a deficit on imports of an excess of US$4\n\nbillion; 2012 motor vehicle imports of US$1,4 billion; significant\n\nexpenditure by individuals and firms linked to Marange including luxury\n\napartments and houses, even high rise buildings in South Africa; expenditure\n\nof perhaps $300 million via the Presidents Fund on free crop inputs,\n\nscholarships and bursaries (64 per cent of students at Fort Hare University\n\nin South Africa is paid for by this scholarship); purchase of two new long\n\nrange Airbus Aircrafts (to be hired out to Air Zimbabwe); and expenditures\n\non military equipment and facilities that are not provided for in the\n\nnational budget, among other things.\n\nCNRG Executive Director Farai Maguwu expressed fears at that the diamond\n\nrevenue Treasury is failing to account for could be used by Zanu – PF to\n\nsubvert the country’s democratic processes.\n\nSpeaking at the same conference Deputy Minister for Justice and Legal\n\nAffairs, Obert Gutu, an MDC –T senior official, called on civic\n\norganisations to gather forensic evidence on any irregularities in the\n\nsector for his ministry to act on. Gutu cast doubt on the effectiveness of\n\nthe recently unveiled diamond policy because of rampant corruption.\n\nCross, Maguwu and Gutu however made it clear that Zimbabweans could not\n\npossible expect KPCS to help address the national quest for greater\n\ntransparency in the sector due to its limited definition of ‘conflict\n\ndiamonds’ which does not cover the current scenario unfolding in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn June 2009, Ian Smillie, the research coordinator for PAC who helped draft\n\nthe KPCS, quit his post, saying, “[The Kimberley Process] is in danger of\n\nbecoming irrelevant and it’s letting all manner of crooks off the hook.”\n\nThe debate surrounding the capacity of the KPCS to clean the market of blood\n\ndiamonds while it hung on to a limited definition of “conflict diamonds” led\n\nto the withdrawal of founding member Global Witness from the process in\n\nDecember 2011.\n\n“The Kimberly Process does not take into account human and legal rights\n\nabuse in the exploitation of diamonds, it only adopts a stance if it can be\n\ndemonstrated that diamond production is being used to promote and fund armed\n\nattacks on civilians. It does not take into account the use of such funds to\n\ndestabilise countries or political systems. It therefore cannot be taken as\n\na suitable measure to define what has and is happening in Zimbabwe,” Cross\n\nsaid.\n\nBoasting Biti – Zimbabwe Vigil Diary: 12th January 2013\n\nOn a bitterly cold day the Vigil kept warm by laughing at the reported remarks by Finance Minister, Tendai Biti, at a Zimbabwe investment conference here in London.\n\n‘Reported’ remarks because we couldn’t afford to go to the meeting to hear for ourselves at a cost of £90 for the cheapest ticket (http://www.zimdiaspora.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10632:biti-announces-election-date-in-london&catid=38:travel-tips&Itemid=18 – By 29.10.2013: Biti announces election date in London).\n\nBiti apparently said that Zimbabwe had become ‘a safe and lucrative place to come and invest in’ and was ‘pregnant with opportunities’. The Minister was also quoted as saying Zimbabwe was on course to have a new constitution – oblivious to the irony that the latest meeting of the cabinet committee appointed to deal with the constitution deadlock had to be postponed because of his absence on one of the expensive overseas visits which he criticized his government colleagues for when he delivered his last budget.\n\nHis trip also took him to Canada where he pleaded unsuccessfully for the lifting of sanctions on Mugabe’s friends. If Biti wanted to justify the expense of his trip and the delay it occasioned to the never-ending constitution making process he should have gone to Germany to apologise for the seizure of German property in Zimbabwe in contravention of a bilateral protection agreement. He might have got the Germans to withdraw their threat to boycott the tourism jamboree planned for the Victoria Falls in August.\n\nBetter still he could have come and shivered with us at the Vigil where we tell all who pass by not to invest in Zimbabwe until Biti says something sensible about selective indigenization, rampant corruption and general institutional freeloading that has become the hallmark of the unity government.\n\nIf Biti had come he would at least have enjoyed the spectacular dancing of Consolata Ngwenya, a member of the Siyaya Arts Group which has been touring the UK with their show ‘Zambezi Express’. There are lots of videos on youtube of this group.\n\nAway on his travels, Biti probably missed the article in the Zimbabwe Independent by the veteran journalist Iden Wetherell. He paints a rather different picture of the situation in Zimbabwe. ‘Zimbabwe, I am sorry to report at the beginning of 2013, is a mess’, he says. ‘It must be evident to even the most simple-minded observers that very little has changed on the ground. The farms audit remains a mirage, senior civil servants are still blatantly partisan, broadcasting is the fiefdom of the former ruling party as it attempts to claw back its electoral losses, while local government has sunk into a state of anarchy as Zanu PF supporters build wherever they like. In the midst of this chaos we have the sad prospect of a party hoping to win power that is asleep at the wheel. They are reluctant to tell us what they stand for, slow to respond to the mendacious claims of our erstwhile rulers, and only too keen to learn from their mistakes. Meanwhile their leader is pressing for a motorcade which is the last thing the motorists of Harare want to see on their roads’ (https://www.zimbabwesituation.com/old/jan12a_2013.html#Z14 – Let’s prove ‘detractors’ wrong).\n\nOther points\n\n·26 Vigil supporters went on to a meeting of the Central London branch of our sister organization Restoration of Human Rights in Zimbabwe (ROHR). The Chair, Fungayi Mabhunu said they must intensify their efforts for peace, justice and freedom. It was agreed that the branch would organize a demonstration to hand over ROHR’s petition to the UK Border Agency asking them to stop deportations until after the elections in Zimbabwe.\n\n·Our first Zimbabwe Action Forum of 2013 will be next Saturday after the Vigil (see Events and Notices for details). We are holding these forums more frequently to focus more closely on our activism. Forums will now be held on the first and third Saturdays of every month.\n\n·Round 13 of the Free Zimbabwe Global Campaign (FZGC) will take place next Saturday when we will demonstrate outside the South African High Commission to urge President Zuma take a more robust approach to Mugabe to ensure a level playing field for the coming elections (see Events and Notices for details).\n\n·Today we conclude our summary of Vigil highlights of 2012, covering the second half of the year (see: http://www.zimvigil.co.uk/the-vigil-diary/465-vigil-highlights-july--december-2012). We note the Vigil diary of 1st September says: ‘We have Tendai Biti touring the world expressing his admiration for Mugabe and saying how the economy is poised to power ahead. Yet now he tells a luxurious conference at the Victoria Falls that Zimbabwe has a per capita annual income of about $320’.\n\n·Vigil supporter, musician Kudaushe Matimba (formerly of the Bundu Boys), is performing in a concert ‘Mwalimu Express’ in London on Sunday 20th January. There will also be a showing of the film ‘Robert Mugabe . . . What happened?’ For details see Events and Notices.\n\nFor latest Vigil pictures check: http://www.flickr.com/photos/zimbabwevigil/.

ROHR grew out of the need for the Vigil to have an organization on the ground in Zimbabwe which reflected the Vigil’s mission statement in a practical way. ROHR in the UK actively fundraises through membership subscriptions, events, sales etc to support the activities of ROHR in Zimbabwe. Please note that the official website of ROHR Zimbabwe is http://www.rohrzimbabwe.org/. Any other website claiming to be the official website of ROHR in no way represents the views and opinions of ROHR.\n\n·ZBN News. The Vigil management team wishes to make it clear that the Zimbabwe Vigil is not responsible for Zimbabwe Broadcasting Network News (ZBN News). We are happy that they attend our activities and provide television coverage but we have no control over them. All enquiries about ZBN News should be addressed to ZBN News.\n\n·Vigil Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8157345519&ref=ts.\n\n·Vigil Myspace page: http://www.myspace.com/zimbabwevigil.\n\n·Useful websites: www.zanupfcrime.com which reports on Zanu PF abuses and www.ipaidabribe.org.zw where people can report corruption in Zimbabwe.\n\nVigil Highlights: July – December 2012\n\nSaturday 21st July\n\nRussian diplomats peeping out from behind the curtains of their London Embassy must have been surprised to see President Mugabe at a demonstration against Moscow’s reported plans to supply helicopter gunships in return for Zimbabwean platinum deposits. Mugabe – in the form of Vigil management team member Fungayi Mabhunu wearing our Mugabe mask – was carrying a poster reading ‘I want a Russian helicopter’. The demo caused quite a security stir as the embassy is in a sensitive location near Kensington Palace. There was a heavy police presence with appropriately enough a helicopter overhead.\n\nIt is with great sadness that the Vigil reports the death of Bernard Hukwa, a faithful supporter who was also a member of our sister organization ROHR and the MDC. His body was found in the Thames. We know he was worried about being unable to support his family in Zimbabwe.\n\nSaturday 4th August\n\nThe European Union’s new friend Robert Mugabe popped up at the Vigil on Olympic ‘Super Saturday’ to display his array of gold medals. Mugabe was given a ‘wild’ card entry to the Games following the EU’s announcement that sanctions were being eased. But he was still not satisfied with his haul: gold medals for Men’s Skulls, Rowing (backwards), Shooting, Torture, Genocide and Looting – as well, of course, as the COPAC marathon, which involves 3.5 years going nowhere. Thanks to Fungayi Mabhunu for sporting our Mugabe mask.\n\nTuesday 21st August\n\nZimbabwean exiles demonstrated outside the Mozambique High Commission in London to urge the new SADC Chair, Mozambican President Guebuza, to keep up pressure to secure free and fair elections in Zimbabwe next year. The demonstration was part of the 21st Movement Free Zimbabwe Global Campaign which has seen protests around the 21st of each month since January. A letter was handed over to a Mozambican official by nine year old Leslie Nkanyezi representing the demonstrators from the MDC, the Vigil, ROHR and the Zimbabwe We Can (ZWC) movement. The letter noted: ‘We are pleased to see that the summit in Maputo reaffirmed the decisions already taken on Zimbabwe but we see little evidence of urgency in the summit resolutions, particularly in preparing the ground so that the elections will be free and fair.’\n\nSaturday 1st September\n\nVigil supporters gathered after our weekly protest outside the Embassy for a wide-ranging discussion of the threatening situation in Zimbabwe and the Vigil’s role in the fight for freedom and democracy. Our monthly Action Forum thought almost unanimously that the MDC was unlikely to be in charge after the next election. Questions were asked why the MDC had allowed itself to be seduced by the ludicrous constitution-making process while nothing had been done to ensure free and fair elections. We have Tendai Biti touring the world expressing his admiration for Mugabe and saying how the economy is poised to power ahead. Yet now he tells a luxurious conference at the Victoria Falls that Zimbabwe has a per capita annual income of about $320. Our meeting noted that Professor David Hulme of Manchester University had told the Victoria Falls conference that Zimbabwe had seen one of the biggest declines in human and economic development recorded among countries not in a war situation.\n\nWednesday 5th September\n\nVigil members attended a meeting at Parliament called to discuss the deteriorating situation in Swaziland. We were there to support the Swaziland Vigil during a week of activism coinciding with Swaziland’s Independence Day on 6th September.\n\nSaturday 8th September\n\nOn the second last day of the Paralympics, Vigil supporters saw off President Mugabe in the Marathon. He only agreed to take part if he was promised the gold medal and he insisted that we give it to him before the race to make sure. He also demanded to start a day before the opposition, given that he is about the oldest contender in the dictator stakes. Furthermore, he insisted on starting at the Embassy which is only a short distance to the finishing line in the nearby Mall. Thanks to Fungayi Mabhunu for playing Marathon Mugabe wearing our mask.\n\nSaturday 15th September\n\nMugabe’s intolerant comments about Jamaican Rastafarians (as our poster put it ‘Mugabe’s message to Jamaica: stop da ganja man and da strong drink and cut the hair’) opened the eyes of Caribbeans to his true character. We have had endless discussions with our brothers in the British Caribbean community over the past 10 years but they have been firmly fixed on an unreal picture of Mugabe as a warrior for African liberation. Now they have been kicked in the groin by their hero’s feet of clay. A dreadlocked mask of Mugabe puffing a giant spliff featured prominently at the Vigil, where he welcomed the arrival of Tsvangirai’s rival brides by rickshaw. Mugabe then handed them to a kneeling Tsvangirai with a placard reading ‘Morgan’s Zanu PF brides’.\n\nSaturday 22nd September\n\nAs the Vigil’s contribution to the Zimbabwe Diaspora 21st Movement’s Global Campaign, we took letters to the Tanzanian and Botswana High Commissions in London. Our letter to President Kikwete of Tanzania noted:’ Your predecessor, Julius Nyerere, told Mugabe that he was inheriting the jewel of Africa. At that time Zimbabwe had the second most advanced economy in sub-Saharan Africa. Now after 32 years of Mugabe’s misrule it is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries.’ The letter to President Khama of Botswana said: ‘We applaud your comments at a recent banquet in Gaberone for President Zuma that “nothing less than free and fair elections in Zimbabwe should be acceptable to the international community”.\n\nOne of our members has contacted her relatives in Bulawayo to find out how they are getting on with synchronized toilet flushing. We have asked them to let us know when it’s happening so we can flush our toilets in sympathy.\n\nSaturday 29th September\n\nAfter reading our last diary, a leading MDC figure in the UK, while thanking us for our help, complained that we were again criticizing the MDC. Here is our reply: ‘We would like to assure you that we are not against the MDC. But we feel an obligation to be critical when the leadership is failing the party’s members. To do otherwise would be following the example of Zanu PF . . . the Vigil applauds the many MDC members working bravely and unselfishly for change. Without the support of these members the party would not exist. They and you have every right, if not a duty, to criticize the leadership when it fails.’\n\nSaturday 6th October\n\nThanks to the BBC and others picking up our Bulawayo lavatory ‘scoop’, we have helped launch the prospective Olympic sport of ‘synchronised toilet flushing’.\n\nZimbabwe Vigil’s 10th Anniversary – Saturday 13th October\n\nToday marked the beginning of our 11th year outside the Embassy in line with the mission statement we adopted in 2002: ‘The Vigil, outside the Zimbabwe Embassy, 429 Strand, London, takes place every Saturday from 14.00 to 18.00 to protest against gross violations of human rights in Zimbabwe. The Vigil will continue until internationally-monitored, free and fair elections are held in Zimbabwe.’ Today was certainly no celebration as our objectives are far from being achieved.\n\nThe protest has been described by the Observer newspaper as the largest regular demonstration in London. Attendance has ranged from a handful to more than 300. Petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of passers-by have been submitted to the UK government, the UN, the EU, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community etc.\n\nWe went on after the Vigil down the road to the India Club in the Aldwych where, Ephraim Tapa, one of the founder members of the Vigil, chaired a meeting to discuss the way forward. He mentioned the BBC interview this week given by the Zanu PF Justice Minister Chinamasa in which he made it clear that Zanu PF will never hand over power. Many people expressed despair at the situation at home. The meeting ended troubled and uncertain but with determination to continue the Vigil until our objectives are achieved.\n\nSaturday 20th October\n\nOn the eve of the 2nd Stakeholders’ Meeting on the new constitution, Zimbabweans exiled in the UK gathered outside the Zimbabwe Embassy to underline our fears that this ludicrous process would again be hijacked by Zanu PF. The gathering was part of the 10th round of monthly demonstrations by the Free Zimbabwe Global Diaspora 21st Movement. A petition was drawn up on the spot and signed by participants, including many MDC members as well as Vigil and ROHR supporters, and slipped under the Embassy’s front door. It said: ‘We deplore the upsurge in political violence and the arbitrary arrests of opposition members and warn you that we will continue our campaign until there are free and fair elections.’\n\nSaturday 27th October\n\nROHR Central London Branch was launched today. An interim committee was elected with Fungayi Mabhunu of the Vigil as Chair. Participants felt that ROHR Central London would have a pivotal and challenging campaigning role in the UK capital where government headquarters and foreign embassies are based.\n\nSaturday 3rd November\n\nA UK daily newspaper The Independent asked the Vigil to write a blog explaining what has kept us going for the past decade. Here it is: http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/11/06/the-zimbabwe-vigils-10th-anniversary-is-no-cause-for-celebration/.\n\nTuesday 6th November\n\nSeveral Vigil management team members attended a meeting in Parliament addressed by Ben Freeth who, together with his father-in-law Mike Campbell, successfully took Mugabe to the SADC International Court after they were evicted from their farm. The Tribunal was then suspended after pressure from Mugabe. The meeting was also addressed by the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, and the exiled MDC T Treasurer Roy Bennett who said ‘There needs to be a clean break with the past in Zimbabwe very soon or the country will be a permanent basket case like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Somalia.’\n\nSaturday 10th November\n\nBen Freeth joined us at the Vigil and urged us to keep up the struggle: ‘We are encouraged because every week we see you are still there’, he said. After the Vigil Ben attended the monthly meeting of the Zimbabwe Action Forum where he said huge problems continue at home and no real reforms were taking place. He said our partner organization Restoration of Human Rights was part of the answer.\n\nSaturday 17th November\n\nIn the past week the Vigil received a sudden surge of calls from Zimbabweans in detention facing possible deportation.\n\nWednesday 21st November\n\nVigil and MDC supporters delivered a petition to the Zimbabwe Embassy demanding transparency in Zimbabwe’s diamond sales. It was part of the monthly demonstrations held by the diaspora around the world. Although it was a working day, the Embassy’s front doors were closed so we slipped our petition under the door.\n\nSaturday 1st December\n\nVigil management team member Josephine Zhuga had happy news for us today. After a long battle – when she was told her papers had been lost – she has finally been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Lindy Bare and Philip Maponga, who played the roles of Tsvangirai and his new wife Elizabeth in our mock wedding on 15th September, announced that they are to get married. They had never met before our event.\n\nSaturday 8th December\n\nOur sister organization the Restoration of Human Rights in Zimbabwe (ROHR) met in Birmingham to elect a new executive. Vigil founder member Ephraim Tapa, who set up ROHR in 2007, was confirmed as Chair. The conference resolved to relaunch programmes in Zimbabwe and start operations in South Africa. Signatures were collected for a petition to the UK Border Agency protesting at the treatment of Zimbabwean deportees.\n\nSaturday 22nd December\n\nOn the shortest Saturday of the year, with darkness falling before 4 pm, and floods reported from many parts of the UK, we gathered in the rain to sing and dance outside the South African High Commission to petition President Zuma for tough action against Mugabe. The demonstration was part of the 21st Movement Global Protest launched in January which has seen monthly demonstrations by the diaspora under the banner ‘Reclaim Zimbabwe’. The petition to President Zuma had been signed by 5,000 people who have stopped at the Vigil outside the Zimbabwe Embassy in recent months.\n\nVigil co-ordinators"
