Once\n\nagain they fired shots at the house of Mrs Thea Cochrane (67). Approximately\n\n25 shots were fired. Thea was in the house alone and her son Ian was in his\n\nhome some 200 meters away with his wife and children.\n\nThe mob broke through the security fence and several ran around the house\n\nshouting and intimidating the elderly Thea.\n\nMeanwhile at another house on the farm, members of the invading group broke\n\ninto the house smashing windows and looting the household contents.\n\nA fire was started on some dry pastureland close to the stables and hay\n\nbales were engulfed in flames startling the horses. A horse belonging to the\n\nchildren did not manage to break free and was badly burnt and had to be put\n\ndown early this evening.\n\nThe police were summoned and responded after other farmers in the area went\n\nto the station to impress upon them that lives could be lost if no police\n\npresence was timeously established. The Police eventually responded with\n\n4-armed details and two assistant inspectors who could not have adequately\n\ncoped with the 60 plus crowd who fortunately had dispersed just before the\n\nPolice arrived.\n\nThe Police remained on site for just over 40 minutes but did not take a\n\nwritten report, or details of the stolen property. They left after refusing\n\nto provide an armed guard.\n\nInformation to hand today is that the ZANU PF youth leader in the area\n\naccompanied by his supporters stole 3 shotguns from guards from a\n\nneighbouring farm last night.\n\nBackground info filed yesterday (10th September 2002)\n\nReports being received indicate that a Karoi farming family are presently\n\nbarricaded in their home following the arrival on their farm of a group of\n\nabout 60-70 people. Two people are armed with automatic shotguns, and\n\nanother, who is a notorious war veteran in the area by the name of Patrick\n\nMapunga, is armed with an FN.\n\nIan Cochrane (43), his mother Thea (67), his sister Sally Magjwick, and two\n\nchildren Hamish (5) and Stacey (3), are presently in the main house of the\n\nhomestead at their 3 000 acre Renroc Farm. The Cochrane's do not have a\n\nsection 8, but were issued with a Section 5.\n\nEvidence of trouble initially surfaced on Monday night at about 6pm when a\n\ncrowd gathered outside the homestead, which comprises two houses. This\n\nmorning, a white vehicle with about 60-70 people arrived on the farm, and at\n\nabout 8:30am, two men, armed with an automatic shotgun, broke into the fence\n\nof the smaller house where Ian was. Ian took his rifle and chased them out\n\nof the garden.\n\nSoon afterwards, another group of people broke into the main house and\n\ncalled the elder Mrs. Cochrane to come out of the house. She went out and\n\nconfronted the group of people, one of whom was armed with the FN. They\n\ngrabbed her and tried to drag her away, however she managed to break free.\n\nDuring the scuffle, Mrs Cochrane's communication radio and cellphone were\n\ntaken from her.\n\nAt this point, Sally called Ian to tell him what was happening and he\n\npromptly took his rifle again and was forced to wade through the larger\n\ngroup of people in an effort to reach his family in the main house. As he\n\nwas doing so, a shot was fired and stones were hurled at him. In response,\n\nIan fired a shot into the ground.\n\nIan was forced to circle the fence around the house for a while as the gates\n\nwere closed. Several more shots were fired at him and he fired twice in\n\nresponse. His sister managed to open the gate for him and he went and joined\n\nhis family.\n\nOne of the farm vehicles took a bullet in the side and all roads leading to\n\nthe farm have been barricaded. Police are refusing to respond to the\n\nsituation.\n\nEnds.\n\n11 September 2002\n\nFor more info, please contact Jenni Williams\n\nMobile (+263) 91 300456 or 11213 885 or on email jennipr@mweb.co.zw\n\nOr Fax (+2639) 63978 or (+2634) 703829 Office email: prnews@mweb.co.zw Farmer tells of 'mob attack'\n\nMedia24 Africa Bureau\n\nHarare - \"Things got a bit out of hand,\" is how Ian Cochrane (41) of Renroc\n\nfarm in the Karoi district described his \"little shootout\" with farm\n\ninvaders under the leadership of a senior war veteran.\n\nThe attackers used, among other things, shotguns and an R1 attack rifle -\n\nnormally issued to Zimbabwean police officials.\n\nCochrane alleged that the police's failure to react to calls for assistance\n\nwas part of a \"well-planned conspiracy\".\n\nHe said his problems started on Monday night when a group of about 65 people\n\narrived on Renroc farm.\n\n\"Everything was under control until a bakkie with armed men and a truck with\n\nabout 50 invaders arrived on the farm on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"When I walked out of my house to lock the gate of the security fence, I\n\nwalked into a man with an automatic shotgun. I pointed my pistol at him,\n\nforced him outside the fence and locked the gate.\"\n\nMen grabbed his mother\n\nWhile this was happening, Cochrane's elderly mother, Thea, his sister,\n\nSally, and her two young children, Hamish and Stacy, were in a second house\n\nabout 200m from Cochrane's one. The second house has its own security fence\n\nand gate.\n\nCochrane said: \"The group of invaders split into two and the group at my\n\nmother's house called her outside to speak to her and she complied. Then,\n\neverything went wrong.\"\n\nThe men grabbed Cochrane's mother and tried to drag her away, but she\n\nmanaged to pull free. Her pistol and cellphone were taken from her before\n\nshe managed to reach the safety of her home.\n\n\"I knew I had to help my mother. I locked my own security gate behind me and\n\nwalked across the open ground to her house as casually as possible with my\n\nautomatic shotgun in my hands.\n\n\"The group at my house followed. I walked backwards the entire way, pointing\n\nmy shotgun at them while they were shouting and throwing stones at me.\n\n\"It was the longest 200m of my life. I fired a shot into the ground, but\n\nthey kept coming.\n\n\"When I reached my mother's house, the security gate was also locked. I\n\ncouldn't go forward or backwards and walked along the security fence with\n\nthe angry mob following me.\n\n\"Then, two or three of the attackers hiding behind our hangar started\n\nshooting at me with, among other things, an R1. I know the guy with the R1.\n\nHe is Patrick Mupunga, head of the war veterans in Karoi. I fired several\n\nshots at them before Sally managed to open the gate.\"\n\n'You develop a very thick skin'\n\nOther farmers from the district arrived to help. Cochrane said: \"They were\n\nalso shot at and my neighbour was nearly hit by a bullet going through his\n\nbakkie window.\"\n\nCochrane said the police arrived only about five hours after the drama had\n\nstarted. \"The three men with firearms had disappeared by that time,\" said\n\nCochrane.\n\nThe three men had left for the neighbouring farm of Piet Storrop, where a\n\nsimilar drama had unfolded. The Storrops could not be reached for comment,\n\nbut Cochrane said everything was \"back to normal\".\n\nCochrane said: \"My mother is severely traumatised, but everything else is\n\nunder control. We have been living with this for two years now and you\n\ndevelop a very thick skin.\"\n\nFrom The Independent (UK), 11 September\n\nWhite farmer in gun skirmish\n\nBy Angus Shaw, AP, in Harare\n\nA white farmer exchanged gunfire yesterday with ruling party militants who shot at his homestead and tried to force him off his land. Ian Cochrane fired eight shots into the ground and some above the heads of militants who were surrounding the farmhouse in Karoi district, 125 miles north-west of Harare. No one was hurt. Three of the attackers, armed with pump-action shotguns and a rifle, were accompanied by about 50 militants who barricaded Mr Cochrane and his family inside the yard, Alan Parsons, a neighbour, said. Police intervened, dispersing the attackers, who moved away in trucks to adjacent properties from where at least two more gunshots were heard. The leader of the militants was identified as an army major, Mr Parsons said. \"It seems they are trying to provoke farmers to retaliate with weapons,\" he said. Farmers leaders said Mr Cochrane was among 26 farmers contesting the legality of government eviction orders to leave their farms in the Karoi grain and tobacco belt.\n\nThe independent Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum said the displacement of farmers had risen since 8 August, the eviction deadline for about 2,900 landowners. Property and equipment had been stolen. In one recent incident, a farmer who fled for her safety returned to find militants in her house and property strewn outside. In south-eastern Chimanimani, police officers, soldiers and Central Intelligence Organisation agents were \"meting out a reign of terror\", assaulting civilians with fists, boots and whips, the forum said. No one from the government was available for comment. President Robert Mugabe vowed last week to crack down on defiant whites. \"Time is not on their side,\" he declared. Earlier yesterday, police reported that 306 white farmers had been arrested since the eviction deadline. Most were freed on bail but prohibited from returning to their farms before trial proceedings. The government is trying to seize about 95 per cent of white-owned farms.\n\nTHERE are African leaders today who remain reluctant to criticise Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, despite the suffering he has inflicted on his people, despite his illegitimate hold on power, and despite the human rights abuses of his regime.\n\nPerhaps they feel a sense of loyalty. Perhaps there is a deeprooted sympathy for the black ruler of an African nation who claims to be defying the rich, white colonial oppressor.\n\nIf so, we have to tell them that their loyalty, however noble a sentiment, is both wrong and misplaced. Their loyalty and support should not be for this tyrant, but for the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe people who attempted to remove him democratically, through the ballot box were denied this right by the regime's cynical programme of intimidation, vote rigging and blatant electoral fraud. The people now face starvation because of the regime's incompetent and brutal destruction of the rural economy. This is where the loyalties of other African nations should be placed.\n\nMugabe's days are limited he is an aging leader desperately defying the will of his people. Opposition to his rule is gathering pace, both inside Zimbabwe and around the world.\n\nWe beseech African leaders to help the voice of millions of Zimbabweans to be heard through truly democratic elections.\n\nWhen democracy and stability are restored, and Zimbabwe is once more a neighbour you can be proud of as part of, we will remember those who stood by us in our struggle; who showed true solidarity with the Zimbabweans.\n\nWe ask the community of nations in Africa to come to our aid now. There are more than 12-million black Zimbabweans suffering under the savage rule of this tyrant. Help us win our freedom.\n\nEphraim TapaChief SpokesmanSave Zimbabwe campaign"
