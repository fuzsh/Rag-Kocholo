It comprises four areas within the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate and covers the entire west bank of the Shashe River within the Thuli Circle.\n\nThe protected area comprises the Thuli Safari Area, plus 3 small botanical reserves:\n\n* Pioneer Botanical Reserve, area of 0.38 km2\n\n* South Camp Botanical Reserve, area of 0.26 km2\n\n* Tolo River Botanical Reserve, area of 0.44 km2The four reserves are administered as a single unit, from the National Parks and Wildlife authority office on the east bank of the Shashe River - just outside the protected area and immediately south of the village of Tuli.\n\nHistory of the Park\n\nThuli (Tuli) Safari Area was proclaimed in 1975. Prior to that date (from 1958), it was a controlled hunting area.\n\nIn terms of a memorandum signed on 22 June 2006, Thuli Parks and Wildlife Land forms the core of the conservation area that Zimbabwe shall contribute to the Limpopo-Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area [Limpopo-Shashe Conservation Area Formally Agreed On. \"Kruger Park Times\" [http://www.krugerpark.co.za/krugerpark-times-3-7-limpopo-shashe-22703.html] ] .\n\nFeatures\n\nFlora\n\nMost of the Thuli area is scrubland, with \"Mopane\" and combretum bush. The Shashe valley, the park's eastern border, supports riverine vegetation such as \"Ficus\" and \"Faidherbia\" [Hyde, M.A. and Wursten, B. 2008. \" [http://www.zimbabweflora.co.zw/speciesdata/location-display.php?location_id=TU Flora of Zimbabwe] :\" Location details: Shashe Wilderness Camp and the Tuli area] .\n\nFauna\n\nAnimal life includes elephants, black rhinos, lion, wild dog, cheetah and leopard, many of which move freely between the protected area and neighbouring Botswana and South Africa [\"Update on the Limpopo-Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area\", Limpopo Valley Carnivores. [http://limpopocarnivores.wildlifedirect.org/2008/06/12/update-on-the-limpopo-shashe-transfrontier-conservation-area/] ] .\n\nGeography and Geology\n\nThe protected area comprises a flat landscape, giving way to rugged hilly terrain near the Shashe River. The underlying geology is entirely basalt, of Jurassic age [Thompson, R.L. 1979. The geology of the area around Tuli, Mazunga and Gongwe. \"Rhodesia Geological Survey Short Report\" 40] .\n\nArchaeological, Historical and Cultural0"
