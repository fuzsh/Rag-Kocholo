        "text": "Witchcraft and Witchcraft Cleansing in Southern Zimbabwe 39 Anth •ropos 102.2007 Few traditional healers and diviners are found amongst the Sotho since many of them belong to Christian churches and independent church move ments. Thus, we see a fracture in the community along religious lines, which also mostly overlaps with a socioeconomic differentiation or fracture along similar lines: between “traditionalists” and poorer members of the community, and Christians and more wealthy and influential members. As an informant said: “The people are now caught in be tween; they sometimes believe that the traditional Way works better than the modern way, and at last they will believe in one.” An interview with a Patanian woman, a n ’anga turned Christian and recruited by the tsikamtanda, c an exemplify this. Her story mirrors how individ- nals not seldom switch from traditional religion t° Christianity and back or use meanings from both, finding them useful in coping with their life situations. She retold how it was through divining that they told me I was a Christian but they still saw snakes on top of me. They called my family members and told them that my at nadlozi still want me to work as a traditional doctor. They told me that the reason why my children are not c °ming home is that I had thrown away my traditional healing tools. So my family members also agreed that they want the spirits back, and the Tsikas asked them if ihey could work with me and rebuild my power. I don’t n eed to retrain as a n’anga but just to be revisited by ttty last powers. So when I was here in Patana I was an a Pprentice for the healers. So now I have returned back to the commandments of my ancestors. fr is evident that religious and socioeconomic dif ferences can sometimes reinforce each other and fracture the community between more wealthy Christians and “Traditionalists” and poorer Inde pendent Church adherents. This has been fertile soil for the emergence of new, mostly younger n anga and diviners exploiting such differences eommercially. An old man complained, “These People of today who tell you they can perform the ceremonies ... who cheat people for money, they are lying as these things need a same family frtfe •.. some are Christians and follow Western culture, how can the ancestors give powers while s °me of the family members are Christians?” One informant bluntly expressed it as “a problem of culture in our society” where people were starting t° blame many of the new n ’anga and diviners for the increasing sickness and seemingly worsening Noughts. fr is this situation in Hwali ward the tsikam tanda entered into. How successful were they? According to a woman from one of the poorer homesteads, only a n’anga can find out the evil spirit, but after the Tsikas, who many of us trusted, we saw that some of the n’anga were a nuisance because they lied. Some of the pinpointed witches in our area are the n ’anga whom people have lost trust in. We believe ukuloya, witchcraft, is a family thing and we have some clans pointed out as practicing it. So, the Tsikas have taken the business from the n ’anga who were possessing herbs for sorcery, bewitching, killing, and bringing conflicts in families. But there were families in Patana who had mixed feelings about the activities of the tsikamtanda. These were the more successful families, some of them Christians, who realized the strong social levelling mechanisms at work at the cleansing ceremonies. For them the witchcraft cleansing was seen as something that could lead to less witchcraft accusations by the poorer envying the more successful in the community. In this respect the activities of the Traditional Healers Group were seen by them as a sort of protection. But it was also a dilemma because, on the other hand, such families could be called in front of the tsikamtanda and be accused of greed at the expense of the poorer, who in turn wanted to be protected from the rich. Therefore, most of the richer families did not acknowledge or partake in the cleansing activities. 11 * A family head from one of these families thought that there are rumours of witchcraft among families which are progressing and have children in school and are working outside the area. Such rumours are about witchcraft that will kill or turn mad those who have succeeded. But after the cleansing of the Tsikas most people feel a sigh of relief from witchcraft because they say, “we are more afraid of this kind of an act of evil than of being exposed.” But not only families with educated members and with members working outside the ward had mixed feelings about the activities of the tsikamtanda. Rumours circulated that witchcraft was behind their progress as seen by their bumper harvests and fat cattle. The more successful cattle rearers and farmers felt, therefore, exposed and vulnerable with the arrival of the diviners. In one case the kraalhead of a Patana line, himself a “traditional 11 Both Christian- and Zionist-type churches have offered alternative moral communities for villagers in Hwali since the 1950s. With their dualistic cosmology, the churches perceive witchcraft as evil. Most of their adherents would be reluctant to attend witchcraft cleansing ceremonies."
