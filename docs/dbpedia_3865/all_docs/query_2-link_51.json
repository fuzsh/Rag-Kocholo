        "text": "Distribution\n\nSperm whales are found in all oceans of the world, but they are concentrated in areas of highly productive and deep water.\n\nMales and females have quite different distributions. Females tend to remain below 40° latitude, whereas large males can be found right up to the southern limits of the ice in the North Atlantic. Only males are found as far north as Svalbard. In mid-latitudes there is a north-south seasonal migration, with them moving pole-ward in summer. Females appear to occupy home ranges whereas males show more variable movement patterns; some remain in coastal waters over periods of years, while others roam much more widely.\n\nGeneral ecology\n\nThere is thought to be approximately 6,200 sperm whales in the Northeast Atlantic region.\n\nFemales are highly social and live together with other females and their young in groups that usually number about 12 individuals. Groups containing young calves stagger their diving activities such that some adult animals are always on the surface with the calves. Groups can join together with others for some days at a time, and females have been documented to shift groups. Members of a group are very cohesive and perform group defence against predators, forming tight clusters with calves on the inside of the group. Sperm whales are sometimes very active at the surface, breaching, lobtailing and rolling, while at other times they simply rest close together.\n\nYoung males leave their mother’s pod and form bachelor schools with similarly sized males. As males grow older the groups they occur in shrink in size, until very large males become solitary.\n\nSperm whales perform quiet squeals and trumpets, but for the most part the sounds they produce are high frequency clicks. The most common click trains are thought to be echolocation; used as a means of finding food. However, some stereotyped click trains likely have a social function.\n\nSperm whales are very deep divers, and are largely benthic feeders. Routine dives are to 400 m for periods of 35 minutes, but they can dive to vast depths for periods of over one hour. The maximum recorded depth is 3,000 m.\n\nSperm whales predominantly eat squid but also eat large fish that inhabit deep waters. Killer whales are their principle predator, although it is thought that large sharks may pose a threat to young animals.\n\nLife history and reproduction\n\nSperm whales have a gestation period of 14–16 months and calves are suckled for several years, although they start eating solid food before they are 12 months old. The specific time of mating and birthing is not known.\n\nLarge, mature males migrate south for breeding purposes, and are intermittently observed associating with female groups. Females reach sexual maturity when they are about nine years old. They give birth about every five years thereafter. Males reach sexual maturity at about 10 years old, but are unlikely able to participate in mating before they are 20 or more.\n\nLongevity is not known, but sperm whales are thought to live to be over 70 years of age."
