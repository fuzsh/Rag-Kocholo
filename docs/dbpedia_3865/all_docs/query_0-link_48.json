Approximately 97% of the goats are owned by smallholder farmers. The majority of goats are indigenous, either of the smaller type (East African goat) found in the eastern and central areas or the larger type (Matabele goat) of southern and western Zimbabwe. Goats play an important role in the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. They are valued primarily for production of meat, milk, manure, skins and cash from the sales of goat products. Apart from these main functions, Zimbabwean goats are also important in a number of ways. These include food security, insurance against crop failure, and slaughter during religious and customary rites as well as festive occasions. Goat by-products such as blood and bone meal have a commercial value. This workshop report is based on findings gathered during a survey in six districts in the arid areas of the southwestern part of the country. The workshop report highlights the state of goat production in the country, challenges and interventions that can be undertaken to improve the situation.This information is targeted at key players in the goat industry (goat keepers, service providers as well as policy makers in the country) who are seen as the major drivers.

INTRODUCTION\n\n12. 3 Opening Address Bothwell Makodza, former director of DLPD, now AGRITEX Goat production plays an important role in Zimbabwe’s agricultural development. As of 2003, there were more than 3 Mio goats in Zimbabwe, about 70% of which were found in the semi-arid areas and owned by small-scale farmers. More than other livestock, goats are particularly suited to the semi-arid areas due to their ability to adapt to harsh climatic conditions including drought. They also contribute immensely to improving livelihoods in rural Zimbabwe. As many women own goats, goat production is a means to empower women and HIV/AIDS-affected households, providing quality food and income. Although the importance of goats has largely been recognized, the goat sector in Zimbabwe faces major challenges such as: • Low genetic potential for increased production • Inadequate nutrition • Prevalence of diseases • Poor management practices (high kid mortality, low birth weights) • Limited market outlets for small ruminants and their products • Inadequate research and extension services • Lack of economic incentives leading to reduced offtake • Lack of a central database to provide information for monitoring and evaluation There are also a number of possibilities to develop the goat sector: • Improving farmers’ access to appropriate extension and technical support services • Facilitating commercially oriented small livestock projects in communal areas • Resuscitating small livestock production structures in resettled areas • Advocating for concessionary finances for improved management (feeds and veterinary, breed stock purchase, fencing, handling facilities) • Establishing small ruminant breeding and multiplication centers and propagating local breeds for distribution to farmers • Facilitatinggeneticimprovementprogramsforindigenousbreedsanddevelopingsimplebreeding procedures involving farmers at the grassroots level • Supporting research on improved small livestock nutrition, health and hygiene, environmentally friendly housing and handling techniques as well as marketing • Establishing market information systems for farmers and improving market infrastructure and services We welcome the initiative of the Goat Forum in bringing the various players in the goat sector together at this workshop. We will use this opportunity to identify realistic options and agree on action plans to strengthen the existing potential of the goat sector and assist small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe to obtain the maximum from their goats. Objectives of the Workshop The overall objective of the workshop was to build a common understanding and initiate dialogue between stakeholders on how to establish competitive goat enterprises. With a clear strategy, the\n\n13. 4 research and development community in Zimbabwe will be better equipped to help small-scale farmers and other players benefit more from goats. To achieve this overall objective the workshop recognized the following issues: • Being the first of its nature, the workshop was designed to set the foundation for a dynamic discussion process consisting of inputs, sharing ideas and experiences and feedback from all stakeholders. The dialogue is expected to continue outside the forum as more stakeholders adopt a multi-sectoral approach to research and development. • A common understanding, sustained by joint visioning, should propel all stakeholders within and across their respective sub-sectors into active participation in the various activities aimed at developing competitive goat enterprises. • The process of achieving the intended goal of a vibrant goat industry in Zimbabwe is as important as the output. There is, therefore, a need to establish a systematic approach that will ensure the synchronization of initiatives at all levels of the goat value chain. The specific objectives of the workshop were to: • introduce the Goat Forum to all stakeholders • report on the existing work of the Goat Forum • share experiences on other existing goat programs • identify opportunities and design strategies to establish successful goat enterprises in Zimbabwe Workshop Methodology and Structure Those who work with goats at one or more stages of the value chain, including farmer representatives, farmer organizations, NGOs, government departments, universities and international research institutions, private players such as abattoirs and stock feed providers as well as policy makers were invited to the workshop.These stakeholders brought with them a broad spectrum of experiences as well as significant technical and organizational inputs. In order to create a dynamic strategy development process based on a common understanding of the relevant issues pertaining to the goat industry in Zimbabwe, the workshop started with the sharing of existing information on the current state of goat production and marketing, as well as on-going activities that aim to enhance the sector. Thereafter, the participants jointly developed a vision for the goat industry, which would guide the rest of the meeting. The participants were then split into various workinggroups,representingdifferentvaluechainlevels,orsub-sectors,inthegoatindustry.Eachgroup was tasked to debate the current state of the goat industry and identify opportunities and challenges for that specific sub-sector. Against the outcome of this brainstorming, the groups then analyzed existing strategies in goat production and marketing, and systematically developed directions for improvement. Maximizing on the strengths, tapping into existing opportunities and countering challenges would lead toward the joint formation of a vision for the goat industry. At each step the groups presented their results in plenary sessions and included the feedback from the discussions into the next step of the strategy development process (Appendix 1). Finally, the participants were tasked with brainstorming their key programs and activities in goat production and marketing, which are presented as action plans in Appendix 2. These focal areas and capacities can be drawn upon for operationalizing the strategy developed during this workshop. A list of participants and their contact information is provided in Appendix 3. Appendix 4 lists the key reference literature that was cited in this report.\n\n14. THE STATE OF GOAT PRODUCTION AND MARKETING\n\n16. 7 Context of the Goat Sector in Zimbabwe Nicholas Nyathi, SNV The goat sector has been recognized as having great potential to contribute to poverty alleviation and improved livelihoods for farmers in remote areas. The development arena has placed a new focus on this sector for food security, income growth and economic development. This contextual analysis gives an overview of the importance of the goat sector from a global perspective and with a special focus on Zimbabwe. Global trends More than 95% of the world’s goat population is found in poorly endowed areas such as the dry zones and the mountainous areas in the developing countries of Asia and Africa. Of all the livestock species, goats are increasing in number. Goat populations have witnessed a +8.1% change between 1990 and 1996atagloballevel,withthemaximumchange(+27%)inAsiancountries(Morand-FehrandBoyazoglu, 1999; Devendra and Chantalakhana, 2002). Goats contribute a significant proportion towards national economies worldwide and this is projected to increase in the coming years. Small-scale farmers, especially those in remote areas, and the landless are gradually recognizing the potential of goats as a low-cost solution to their poor resource endowments. Therefore, goats deserve greater attention at both the macro and micro levels (Peacock et al., 2005). Regional trends The role of livestock is becoming more important in southern Africa. As elsewhere in the world, there is an increasing urban demand for livestock products based on growing urban populations with higher incomes and associated dietary changes (Delgado et al., 1999). However, southern Africa is not benefiting enough from these opportunities. The productivity and offtake of small-scale production systemsremainlowinmostoftheregion,thoughthereisalsolargevariability.CountriessuchasNamibia and South Africa have well-developed goat markets and export livestock within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, whereas livestock markets in Mozambique or Zimbabwe are largely undeveloped (van Rooyen, 2007). The countries in the region now realize the potential inherent in livestock and there are more initiatives to improve livestock production and marketing. The overarching aim is to assist rural households to escape the poverty trap through market-driven livestock production. Goats are the most common livestock species being promoted as they are now viewed as being a source of empowerment, especially for marginal groups, such as female-headed households and those affected by HIV/AIDS. National trends Zimbabwe has regions with different agro-ecological potentials and different suitabilities for goat production. In Natural Regions I to III crops do well because of the favorable climatic conditions whereas most livestock is found in the drier regions, IV (parts of Manica land, Mashonaland Central and East, Masvingo and Matabeleland North and South) and V (parts of Manicaland, Masvingo and Matabeleland North and South; Figure 1). In these drought-prone areas goats are considered to be highly valuable assets for income generation and source of investment. Almost all goats are found in communal areas;\n\n17. 8 thus, the goat sector has the potential to ensure food security and alleviate poverty for a significant proportion of the rural population. ThelivestockindustryinZimbabwehasfacedalotofchallengesoverthelast10years.Beforethefull-scale land reform program started in 2000, the livestock sector had a dual structure (large-scale commercial and small-scale subsistence). Large-scale commercial farmers in Natural Regions IV and V concentrated on cattle ranching. Supported by well-developed infrastructure and services they supplied livestock products to export markets such as the European Union. As a result of poor management and limited access to inputs and services, small-scale farmers could not comply with those market requirements and remained subsistence oriented. However, now the breakdown of the commercial sector since the land reform program gives small-scale farmers a new chance to venture into commercial livestock production in order to fill the gap in the demand for livestock products within the country. Recent developments have pushed attention towards small stock production. Since the national cattle herd size has declined by more than 70% in the last decade (a result of land reform, unfavorable economicconditions,anddroughts),smallstock,particularlygoatshaveassumedincreasingimportance. The reduction in cattle production has caused a deficit in beef supply. This has created an important opportunity for the goat industry because goat meat can serve as a ready alternative to beef given that the population of goats in Zimbabwe is currently at 3 million (FAO, 2005). Also, because they make no contribution to cropping activities, farmers are more willing to dispose of them. Goat numbers have been steadily increasing and there is a greater scope for goat market development in the urban and rural areas. Figure 1. Distribution of livestock by provinces in Zimbabwe.

The export permit was, however, cancelled around 2000. In recent years, Cold Storage Company (CSC), Associated Meat Packers (AMP), and NashCo-Farmsaver (Mount Hampden) abattoirs have received some inquiries from Bahrain and Dubai for supplies of at least 30 tons of goat meat per month. They have so far failed to deliver the needed quantities. Despite the great potential, the market demand for goat meat cannot be met by the current supply volumes and on average there is a demand gap for goat meat of at least 60% (Nyathi et al., 2007). Public investments in goat production and marketing are insufficient and policies incomplete. Traditionally, in Zimbabwe, government and NGO development initiatives have focused more on crops rather than livestock, mainly because food security has largely been defined in terms of crop production. Within the livestock sector, support was focused on the commercial sector (mainly beef), and on veterinary services, but other livestock management issues such as feeding, water and shelter were not adequately addressed. Opportunities in the goat sub-sector A livestock scoping study confirmed great opportunities for small stock, particularly goats, to improve livelihoods among rural households in Zimbabwe, provided that livestock productivity is enhanced and appropriate inputs and services can be availed (Sibanda, 2005). The study revealed that 98% of an estimated number of 3 Mio goats in Zimbabwe are produced by the less affluent section of the community. If farmers would improve their management regimes, the number of goats could be increased by 40–60% within 2 years. A recent study on goat production and marketing commissioned by the Goat Forum revealed that farmers value the multiple functions of goats and rank income as most important, followed by meat, milk, manure and traditional rituals (Homann et al., 2007). Farmers find it easier to dispose their goats than their cattle because they keep their cattle for draft power and milk . Improved goat production and better access to markets can therefore make a substantial contribution to enhancing the livelihoods of the rural poor. Looking at the major market flows of goats in Zimbabwe, Nyathi et al. (2007) confirmed that most goats and goat products originate in Matabeleland mainly from Beitbridge, Gwanda, Matobo, Bubi, Binga, Mangwe and Bulilima districts. For Masvingo, they originate mainly from Chivi, Chiredzi, and Mwenezi districts. For example, in 2006, more than 30000 goats from Gwanda were registered as being sold and another significant number was sold through informal channels that were not documented. The flows confirm that the main market destinations for goats are urban areas, such as the principal cities of Harare and Bulawayo, where many poor people need access to low-cost quality protein, and higher income groups can afford to pay for higher quality protein. Improving the efficiency in goat production and marketing operations could enhance these market flows. This would drive farmers in the rural supply areas towards commercialization. Developing specific value chains can enhance the efficiency in goat production and marketing. This includes the establishment of public-private sector partnerships between the main players in the goat sector, such as government departments (AGRITEX, local authorities), private sector (butcheries, transporters, abattoirs, supermarkets and restaurants), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (Plan\n\n19. 10 International, Heifer International, World Vision, Practical Action), research organizations (ICRISAT), and input suppliers (animal health, agro-processing feed suppliers, banks). These value chains are aimed at empowering small-scale goat producers and transforming them into well-informed players in market-oriented goat production. This should improve the competitiveness of goat producers and consequently contribute to economic development as well as improving the livelihoods of the poor.

Sixty-six percent of Zimbabweans engage in agriculture as a major source of income and 27% find employment in agriculture. Agriculture contributes 17% of the national GDP and livestock production 21% of the agricultural GDP. Recent changes in the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe have resulted in reduced commercial cattle herds. Beef production is down by between 60 and 75%. Furthermore, growth rates for meat and milk are negative and there are serious shortages of inputs – both hardware (infrastructure, animal health products, feed etc.) and software (information, support services, and institutions). However, with these changes also come opportunities. There are opportunities for small-scale livestock keepers to engage in commercial production that would fill the void in the market left by the reduction in the number of commercial livestock farmers. In addition, the livestock revolution suggests that meat and milk production in Zimbabwe should rise to between 39% and 36% respectively to maintain current consumption levels; this in itself represents a huge opportunity. There have also been changes in the market demand. Goat meat now compares favorably with beef in local meat markets and retailers commonly cite shortages of goat meat as a challenge. The role and value of cattle and goats Results from the goat survey undertaken by the Goat Forum indicated that livestock is by far the most important source of on-farm income in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe (Homann et al., 2007). More than 60% of farmers cited livestock as one of the top three sources of income, followed by remittances and cash crops, crop farming, labor and other small-scale industries (Figure 1). Income from livestock is primarily used to purchase food items that are not produced on-farm and to fund education (Figure 2). When comparing the role of cattle with goats it is clear that cattle are primarily used for their flow products (milk, draft power and manure) whereas goats are a major source of cash income and meat, adding to household nutritional security (Figure 3). While cattle take the highest position in terms of cultural, monetary, insurance and prestige values, ownership has dramatically declined in the recent past. On average, 38.9% of goat owners interviewed for this study had no cattle, varying from 19.3% in Nkayi to as much as 49% in Gwanda (Table 1). Cattle herds were also small and varied between households. Among the cattle owners, 25% of the house­­holds owned less than three head of cattle, 25% owned between three and five head of cattle and 25% of the households owned more than 10 cattle. The remaining 25%, those with a potential for commercialization, ranged from 11 to 51 heads of cattle. Table 1. Percentage of households that do not own cattle in six districts of Zimbabwe Total Beitbridge Gwanda Matopo Binga Nkayi Tsholotsho 38.9 43.7 49.0 47.4 40.7 19.3 31.5\n\n21. 12 Figure 2.

Protecting and increasing these herds can make a huge impact on food security and education. Determinants of goat ownership Most owners of goats were fathers (41.7%), followed by mothers (35.8%), sons (13.9%), daughters (5.9%), and extended family members (2.7%). Goat ownership has a strong gender component as many women in all districts owned goats.The fact that sons and daughters owned goats underlines the importance of addressing the young generation as custodians of goats for improved management. Male-headed households kept larger goat herds, followed by de facto female-headed households (Table 2). Households with a male component owned more goats than de jure female-headed households or child-headed households, the latter thus being more vulnerable. Ownership was not significantly influenced by age, but better educated household heads owned larger goat herds.This clearly illustrates the need for different development approaches when dealing with different types of ownerships.

Decision making and labor in goat management Allfamilymemberscontributedtothedecision-makingprocessandlaborwithregardtogoatproduction (Figure 4). Fathers and mothers made the majority of decisions on goat management and sons were also involved. Fathers were more involved in decisions about health, slaughter and sales; however, mothers also decided in all aspects of goat management. It is important to note the high proportion of women involved in making decisions on slaughtering (household nutrition) and sale (income). Figure 4.

They provided more labor for feeding, herding, and watering than other family members. Fathers and mothers provided more labor to animal health and sales and fathers and sons provided most of the labor for slaughter. An important observation is that a significant proportion of farmers did not make any decisions or invest labor in goat management. Farmers exercised little control, particularly with respect to feeding and breeding, but relied on communal resources instead. More than 60% of the farmers did not actively manage breeding and more than 20% were not active in feeding. Addressing these two management aspects could have huge returns by reducing mortality and increasing the productivity of goats. Conclusions Goats contribute significantly to human livelihoods through the provision of food, directly through meat and milk and indirectly by increasing farmers’ability to buy foodstuff not produced on farm. Goats complement the value of cattle and their role is increasing in the rural areas of semi-arid Zimbabwe.They contribute significantly to funding education, which is a critically important determinant in increasing off-farm income and the ability to manage livestock more efficiently. Goat production is sensitive to the needs of the vulnerable and addresses important issues with regard to the increasingly important role that woman play as heads of households and decision makers in the rural landscape. Facilitating the development of increased goat production will thus build human livelihoods and contribute directly towards the Millennium Development Goals. However, this will require the establishment of transparent and efficient markets where both the rich and poor can sell goats. Such markets will not only ensure a constant supply of affordable meat to both rural and urban consumers, but will also provide the incentives required for increased investment in sustainable competitive goat enterprises.

Answer: The study considers the social role of goats. Previous studies have shown the social contributions to be greater than others, but shifts in the contributions have been noted over time. Under current conditions in Zimbabwe, goats’ economic and nutritional contributions outweigh social contributions. Question: How significant is the cash contribution of goats compared to cattle? Answer: The role of cattle is different from the role of goats. Cattle can be viewed as an interest and savings account whereas goats are a current account.\n\n25. 16 Goat Production and Management Joseph L. N. Sikosana, DAR4D Background The Goat Forum study on goat production and marketing identified high numbers of goat mortalities as the key challenge that restricts small-scale farmers from realizing the maximum benefits from their goats (Homann et al., 2007). On average, 26% of a household’s goats died, whereas only 11% of the goats were sold and 7% were slaughtered. Goat mortalities affected young and adult goats across the study districts. Goat mortalities spike during the dry season (July–November) when feed and fodder resources become scarce and of lower nutritional quality. Poor nutrition renders goats more susceptible to diseases and less able to recover from stress. Farmers need their goats for sale mainly in January to cover school fees and for slaughter in December, the festivity season. Reducing the number of goat mortalities during the late dry season could directly avail more goats for the sale and slaughter peaks. Although farmers appreciate goats for their multiple functions, they invest little in management technologies that would secure goats’survival in dry seasons or even to achieve higher performance of their herds. As a result, goat productivity remains low and farmers have fewer goats available for use. They are forced to keep their goats merely to maintain their herds. It is especially important for poor households to maintain their minimum herd size as they depend more heavily on goats and often have few alternative means for quality nutrition or to cover the purchases of their daily needs. The study concluded that reducing goat mortality through improved management is the most effective way of supporting small-scale farmers in semi-arid Zimbabwe. This would help poor farmers maintain goat herds in production and better-off farmers would benefit from enhancing the performance of their goat herds, enabling them to enter into more commercially oriented production. Priorities for goat production and management Thefollowingparagraphsthrowsomelightintofarmers’existingmanagementpractices,theirchallenges and constraints, and how these can be overcome. Feeding Farmers depend on natural rangelands to feed their goats. However, these feed resources became limited in quantity and also vary with the prevailing weather conditions. During the dry season the rangelands lose feed quality and are not sufficient to maintain goats in healthy condition. According to farmers’ information, feed shortages are common during the months of July to November. Dry season feeding is of high priority to them in order to alleviate feed shortages and ensure the survival of goats. The feed calendar (Figure 1) shows that farmers supplement their small stock nutrition during the dry season, contrary to the assumption that goats survive from rangelands alone. Most farmers (83%) supplementedrangelandgrazingbyfeedinglegumeresidues(groundnuthay,cowpeahay,andbambara nut hay) or cereal crop residues to their goats (mainly sorghum and maize). Some farmers improved the nutrition of their goats by cutting and carrying legume trees or collecting Acacia pods. Few farmers also purchased commercial feeds. However, growing forages was not common. Despite farmers’efforts, mainly using locally available material, goats’body conditions during dry periods deteriorated.\n\n26. 17 Figure 1. Seasonal feed resources across the study districts for the year 2005/2006. Improving animal nutrition to reduce dry season mortality and augment animal condition will require access to information and support services, as well as inputs. Many farmers indicated they have access to alternative feed sources, but they lack the know-how regarding processing and storage. Much can be done to improve farmers’ capacity to add value to their feed resources. In addition, there is a serious need to investigate the potential of improved dual-purpose crops and fodder varieties in semi-arid Zimbabwe. Animal health Farmersshowedabasicunderstandingofgoatdiseases,prevention,andtreatments.Mostofthediseases mentionedbyfarmerswerelocationandseasonspecific(Figure2).Threequartersofthefarmersreported goat disease problems during the dry season, which could be due to poor nutrition and subsequent poor body condition.The common diseases during the dry season were pulpy kidney (enterotoxaemia), internal parasites, tick-borne diseases, and eye problems. Farmers reported fewer diseases during the rainy season; these included foot rot, tick-borne diseases, and pulpy kidney. Internal parasites were a common problem throughout the year. More than 40% of the respondents attempted to prevent some of the diseases mentioned and more than 50% attempted to treat diseases. Disease prevention and treatment involved traditional, non-conventional, and conventional methods. The frequent use of traditional medicines was however not a reflection of farmers’deep indigenous knowledge, but rather existed by default as the inputs and know-how to apply the other methods were either inaccessible or unaffordable. Foreffectivediseasepreventionandtreatment,farmers’needaccesstoinformationonfarm-leveldisease management and they also need access to relevant support services (animal health care clinics) and inputs (vaccines, dipping, dosing and medical care). This will require increased government investment in personnel, infrastructure, and input supply.

They lack the awareness that appropriate shelter can preventmanygoatdiseasesandreducemortalityrates,especiallyforgoatkids.Kidsarehighlyvulnerable to cold and wet periods and soon succumb to exposure. Foot rot is a common problem during the wet season when goats are housed in muddy or water-logged conditions. Dry, well-ventilated housing has been proven to be highly effective in reducing deaths during the wet season. Many farmers also seem to be unaware that very effective goat shelters can be built from local materials costing little more than the price of labor. Proper housing would protect animals against wind, cold, disease risks, rain and muddy conditions, which prevail during the rainy season. Breeding and husbandry Maintaining and improving a good breeding stock is an important element to goat management. However, although farmers see the importance of improved breeding, uncontrolled breeding is practiced in the communal areas, compromising planning for mating periods and selection for quality criteria. As a result, goats tend to kid any time of the year. Under controlled mating, kidding could coincide with periods of better feed availability or planned supplementary feeding. Furthermore, only 33% of the farmers maintained their own breeding buck. In most of the flocks with a breeding buck the proportion of males to females was very low – 1:7 as opposed to the recommended ratio of 1:25. Many farmers did not realize the value of maintaining breeding bucks, as they could not control access to their bucks. Instead, they tend to castrate the males in their flocks, as a measure of reducing straying or improving meat quality. Farmers cull their goats, but this is mainly due to old age or poor condition, which does not improve the breeding quality. Figure 2.

Farmers prioritized a need for information on animal health, followed by marketing, feeding, and breeding. Most of the management challenges can be overcome with simple technologies or know-how on how to implement the improved management options. Althoughmorethan50%ofthefarmershadaccesstoinformationfromvarioussources,mostinformation flows were between farmers.While information flows from farmer-to-farmer are highly effective, sources of new information or improved technologies are limited. The second-most important sources of information were government departments in the Ministry of Agriculture, NGOs, and local authorities. However, information from these sources are generally weak and interaction irregular. Appropriate ways of communicating with farmers need to be found and relevant information must be made accessible to them. In addition to this, enabling farmers to use new information or knowledge also requires access to inputs: improved dry season feed is often impossible because of a lack of genetic material, knowledge regarding growing, processing, and storage of feed and dual-purpose crops. Similarly, animal health is weakened by the lack of infrastructure, such as dip tanks for goats, acaricides, and other animal health care products. Success in improving the current situation thus depends on greater access to information, know-how and the relevant inputs. Relationship between goat sales and management investment The study also investigated whether farmers who sell more goats also invest more in goat management, indicating a disposition to commercialize. However, a clear pattern between higher sales and management investments could not be found. Farmers who sold more goats invested more in practices such as purchasing breeding bucks, castrating bucks more often, culling for higher performance, and providing roofed housing; but they were not necessarily more involved in disease prevention and treatment or feeding, which would be the most effective strategies to avail more goats for sale. These results indicate that although farmers are aware of the need to improve management and do participate in goat markets, they have not yet developed strategic investments for obtaining higher market benefits from goats. Conclusion As the first steps to building healthy profitable goat enterprises in Zimbabwe, basic animal health, nutrition, and housing initiatives are needed to reduce mortality rates.This would allow farmers to build their flocks and produce quality animals for household consumption and sale. Effective goat markets are needed to encourage farmers to invest in improved management. Linking extension and input delivery more directly with marketing strategies will improve production and create better prices for farmers. The resulting higher productivity and offtake rates would make significant contributions to improving rural livelihoods. References Homann S, van Rooyen A, Moyo T and Nengomasha Z. 2007.

Answer: There are several interacting factors, such as feed and health management, that affect mortality rates. These should be addressed first. Question: Do you have any insights on the use of traditional remedies and disease prevention methods? Has any research been conducted on these methods? Answer: The advantage of traditional remedies is that they have been known to reduce costs. However, traditional remedies also have limitations, for example, dosages are not known. At Matopos Research Station, research was conducted using some local herbs and other plants with high tannin contents to control internal parasites, mainly worms. In South Africa there are already similar efforts. There is a global shift towards animals that are organically produced (no chemicals). This represents an opportunity for Zimbabwe. Question: How do the mortality statistics at Matopos Research Station compare with the survey data? Answer: Mortalities at Matopos Research Station used to be at 30% before we started improving housing etc. However, it is still fairly high probably due to a high concentration of animals in one place. Comment: Your results have shown that the primary means of information transfer is from farmer to farmer. However, the quality of information shared was not measured. We need to determine whetherfarmersaregivingeachotherhigh-qualityinformation.Andifnot,weneedtodeterminehowto provide them with good information so that they can pass it on to each other. Question: What is the relationship between management and the number of goats that are sold? Did you analyze whether marketing had an influence on the activities that were invested in? Answer: The study results show that those farmers who sold more goats invested in various management practices. But the investments were not consistent and did not necessarily yield higher benefits. For example, farmers did not increase feed utilization or invest in better quality feed. So while the inclination to invest in improved technologies is evident, farmers’ actions do not necessarily translate to higher sales or greater profits.\n\n30. 21 Promoting Goat Markets and Technology Development in Semi-Arid Zimbabwe for Food Security and Income Growth Sabine Homann, ICRISAT Background In the past 25 years, livestock production has tripled and per capita consumption of meat has doubled in the developing world. While developing countries accounted for 80% of the growth in global livestock production during this period (FAO, 2005a), this “revolution” has largely bypassed southern Africa (Delgado et al., 1999). Livestock production in the region needs to double to fulfill demand during the period to 2020. For this to happen small-scale livestock producers need to be better integrated into the commercial market. Zimbabwe has an estimated 3 Mio goats of which the vast majority is owned by small-scale farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems (FAO, 2005b). Although these low input systems are not highly productive, households do realize most on-farm income from livestock (FAO, 2005a). Goats, specifically, are utilized to supplement household food requirements and sold to purchase food items and fund educational expenses (Homann et al., 2007). The recent collapse of the commercial livestock sector in Zimbabwe provides a unique opportunity for small-scale farmers to make use of existing infrastructure and local and regional markets to commercialize goat production. However, at present, the commercial market for goats remains grossly underdeveloped. Weak public and private sectors are failing to provide the necessary inputs and know-how (Hargreaves et al., 2005) and the erratic climate and frequent droughts often result in dry season feed shortages and high mortality rates. Our major objective is to shift small-scale farmers from low input to more competitive market-oriented goat production systems. We hypothesize that if markets are better developed and market linkages are strengthened small-scale farmers will invest in improved technologies to increase production, improve animal quality, and consequently increase market-related offtakes. We expect that this will yield immediate (income growth, food security) as well as longer-term benefits (reducing environmental degradation, improved sustainability of agro-ecosystems). Facilitating the development of competitive goat production systems in Zimbabwe Most livestock projects in the past have focused on promoting specific technologies and have largely failed because they ignored socioeconomic and institutional issues (LID, 1999). We have followed a more integrated approach by investigating challenges (and opportunities) from production to consumption along a value chain, while also addressing policy and institutional factors affecting goat production. Table 1 represents a simple goat value chain in Zimbabwe based on a reconnaissance survey conducted with goat market players in September–October 2005. Further analysis, based on key person interviews, household surveys and participatory rural appraisals identified the challenges at each stage of the value chain. The development objectives to address these challenges and probable impact pathways to achieve the overall goal are also included. An analysis of Table 1 reveals two critical factors – low production and poorly developed markets – as primary constraints to achieving more competitive goat production.\n\n31. 22 Production constraints High mortality rates The majority of households in Zimbabwe (52%) have herds of fewer than 8 goats and 30% have between 8 and 20 goats. Only 18% of households surveyed had more than 20 goats. Given the relatively small herd sizes, farmers in Zimbabwe cannot afford to lose many animals through mortalities. The study showed, however, that farmers lose 26% of their goats to mortalities whereas only 11% were sold and 5% slaughtered for home consumption (Figure 1). Even though the total outflows from the herds are large (>40%), only 16% of goats are gainfully utilized. Reducing mortality rates has thus been identified as the most effective strategy to increase productivity and herd sizes. Poor management The main cause of high mortality rates is poor management practices, and, more specifically, lack of dry season feed, poor animal health and housing. Addressing these three factors individually or collectively can substantially reduce mortalities. However, we argue that, without the appropriate market-based incentives, farmers will be unable or unwilling to invest in improved management strategies. Table 1. Goat value chain challenges, development objectives and impact pathways in Zimbabwe Players Challenges Development objectives Impact pathways Farmers • High mortalities • Low offtake rates • Poor animal quality • Low product prices • Improve access to input and support services (health, feeding/water, housing, marketing) • Higher goat production levels • Higher incomes and food security Input suppliers • Lack of inputs, technology and information • Limited service capacity • Lack of policy and advocacy • Improve targeting and access to inputs and technologies • Create enabling legal frameworks • More technology uptake and production systems development Market players • Poor market access, organization, facilities and infrastructure • Lack of market information, pricing, grading, weighing and control systems • Improve access to market services and infrastructure • Reduce transaction costs (transport bureaucracy) • Improve communication between stakeholders • Competitive markets • Investments in market development • New public-private partnerships sustain market activities Processors & retailers • High processing costs • Inconsistent product supply (volume, quality) • Product demand not met • Evaluate market potentials • Develop markets for low cost and high-quality products • Align supply and demand • New niche markets • Investment in value addition and product diversification Consumers • Lack of information on consumer preferences and willingness to pay • Higher flows of livestock products within rural and to urban areas • Improve low cost and high quality protein supply • Supply of low cost and high-quality products ensured\n\n32. 23 Figure 1. Monthly outflows in goat flocks in Zimbabwe. (CWS=cold wet season, CDS=cold dry season, HDS=hot dry season, HWS=hot wet season) Market constraints Input markets and production support Inputs, technologies and information have to a large extent been focused on the large-scale commercial producer. Therefore, apart from a lack of knowledge and information, inputs such as vaccines, acaracides, and commercially produced animal feeds are not accessible to the small-scale producer because of high procurement costs, transport logistics and costs, and bulk packaging. Output markets and market intermediaries Producers often do not have access to markets – a function of distance to a market place, market places with inadequate infrastructure, lack of information regarding the market process, rules of trade, pricing grading and control systems. On the other hand, buyers/traders/processors face challenges of low product quality and inconsistent and/or low product supplies, making continuous flow to the consumer impossible. Can market-led technology development enhance the adoption of improved technologies? Results from this study suggest that increased goat sales will increase managerial investment and that better market access improves offtake rates. Goat sales increase managerial investment Farmers who sold more goats invested more in certain management components such as purchasing breeding bucks, castrating bucks more often, culling for higher performance and providing roofed Numberofgoats 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 May-05 Mortality Jun-05 Jul-05 Aug-05 Sep-05 Oct-05 Nov-05 Dec-05 Jan-06 Feb-06 Mar-06 Apr-06 Sold/exchanged Slaughter Lost Predators CWS CDS HDS HWS CWS\n\n33. 24 housing than those who sold fewer animals. While these strategies suggest a willingness to invest in improved technologies farmers would have better results if they invested more in goat health and feeding. Market access improves offtakes More goats were sold in districts with better-developed goat markets (Gwanda and Binga) than where markets are weak (Table 2). In districts with more market development, traders often buy goats in bulk for sale to urban areas.These traders play an important role in facilitating higher offtakes. In the districts with limited market development farmers largely depend on farmer-to-farmer sales. Table 2.

However, considering the informal character of existing goat markets and lack of clear incentives (low and erratic price structures), we conclude that farmers would further increase managerial investment and sell more animals if both input and output markets were to improve. Way forward Fromtheprevioussectionsitisclearthatimprovedgoatproductionandmarketingcanplayanimportant role in food security and income growth for small-scale farmers while providing options for local and regional market development. How does one implement such a process? Innovation Platforms Fora for participatory identification and implementation of strategies are being developed to facilitate competitive production systems and reduce transaction costs along the value chain. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and partners are establishing Innovation Platforms which bring all players in the goat value chain together to collectively identify opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed to improve goat production and markets in Zimbabwe. These Innovation Platforms, consisting of stakeholders pertaining to an existing local market system, evaluate specific local constraints in production and marketing and suggest agreeable options for improvement through dialogue, implementation, evaluation, and adaptation. With all role players present, buyers relate demand and quality expectations directly to producers, and producers and market intermediaries can articulate challenges and address these collectively. The research\n\n34. 25 and development community suggests specific technologies to address these challenges and opportunities. These changes in production and marketing are then implemented and evaluated. This process allows for the selection of the most appropriate technology packages (feeding, animal health care, housing) and input delivery and improved marketing systems for any given location. Moreover, the approach engages public and private as well as policy players in a common vision and catalyzes a better understanding of how to achieve this. Keeping all players engaged and motivated requires a significant investment in facilitation during the initial phase. Ideally this role will be taken over by the key stakeholders during the course of the development of the Innovation Platform, thus ensuring sustainability. Technology and market systems development for all Farmers can be placed within two categories: those with smaller herds who rely heavily on goats during timesofdistressandwhoneedsupportinbuildingherdsandincreasingproduction,andthosewithlarger herds who need support to improve both productivity as well as quality. An important consideration for the Innovation Platform approach is that research and development work should better target the specific needs of each category and better align production with market demands. This will improve the efficiency of the entire system and ensure that stronger individuals within the system do not trap all the benefits.

However, that seems to have been ignored. Answer: This time the focus was on the production side. However, we will be conducting other studies, which will consider the consumers, among other issues.\n\n35. 26 Question: Did you determine whether farmers sell their goats for immediate needs or whether they plan their sales in advance as this will determine the quality of the goats sold? Answer: Farmers are currently selling their goats mainly to meet an immediate need for cash. There is need to raise the awareness of farmers in terms of the potential of goats as a commercial enterprise. Question: What do we need to energize the value chain to deal with the challenge of informal markets? Answer: We believe that dialogue is the answer.The Innovation Platform promotes dialogue among the key role players in the value chain.This should generate a considerable amount of energy to achieve the desired commercial activities. Question: We are concerned about re-inventing the wheel. What prevents this from going the same way as other projects? Answer: We are not re-inventing the wheel as much as we are making sure the wheel gets used by adopting a participatory approach when identifying the challenges at production and management level. For instance, demand for goat meat increases in December but farmers want to sell their animals in Januarywhentheyneedmoneyforschoolfees.Therefore,theprojectaimstobring/testthosetechnologies that will match supply to demand. Question: Does the lack of sale pens and infrastructure have an effect on the number of goats sold? Answer: Infrastructure is very important. For example, at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair, there were no facilities to display goats during the auctions and this had a huge impact on prices. The lack of sale facilities is critical in Zimbabwe. Other southern African countries have formal markets but have gone through some stages of development.

ACTORS AND ACTIVITIES TO ENHANCE GOAT PRODUCTION AND MARKETING\n\n38. 29 The Goat Forum Nicholas Nyathi, SNV Introduction In March 2006 key stakeholders involved in livestock promotion in Bulawayo came together to discuss challenges and opportunities in goat production and marketing. These discussions resulted in the birth of a network – the Goat Forum. This outcome was a recognition that strong partnerships are necessary and that each organization donated their expertise in a given area to develop the goat sector effectively and lead farmers out of poverty. The founding members of the Goat Forum are the Department of Livestock Production (DLPD now restructured as Agricultural Technical and Extension Services (AGRITEX)), ICRISAT, Matopos Research Station (MRS, now restructured as Department of Agricultural Research for Development, DAR4D) and SNV.The Goat Forum has since expanded to include the Department ofVeterinary Services (DVS) and the Organization of Rural Association for Progress (ORAP). The Forum also collaborates with organizations such as the FAO, Small Ruminants Network, Zimbabwe Farmers Union, local authorities, and NGOs such as Heifer International or Practical Action, and bi- and multilateral organizations such as Deutscher Entwicklungsdienst (DED), SADC, and the European Union. Goal The main goal of the Forum is to discuss issues related to goat production, marketing and policy development. The Goat Forum also tasked itself with conducting joint activities, sharing knowledge and resources for synergy. This will facilitate the achievement of improved farmers’ livelihoods and economic development through competitive goat production and marketing systems by 2015. Objectives The specific objectives of the Goat Forum are to: 1. Identify opportunities and challenges in goat production, marketing, support services, and policy sectors 2. Develop goat markets and infrastructure, and provide information as well as appropriate management technologies 3. Facilitate input and service systems based on strong partnerships between the public and private sectors 4. Develop capacities of farmers and government and non-government support systems 5. Coordinate and evaluate development interventions 6. Influence donors and policy makers for more investments 7. Source funding for research and development projects Target groups The main target groups of the Goat Forum are the resource-poor farmers who choose to keep goats to improve their livelihoods and the commercializing farmers who want to invest in goat production and marketing to regularly supply high-quality goats to the market.\n\n39. 30 Mode of operation TheGoatForumworksthroughregularmeetingswithaflexibleagenda,andishostedbySNV.TheForum plans and implements activities by creating ad hoc task forces in line with the vision and objectives. Membership is sustained by interest and commitment. Current activities Farmer representatives, as well as a number of other stakeholders in the goat sub-sector, especially those from chosen supply chains, are involved in the activities of the Goat Forum. Private sector participation is viewed as the key to the success of marketing activities.The buyers, transporters, processors as well as input suppliers are involved in dialogue platforms to discuss goat marketing and production issues. The Goat Forum is currently involved in the following activities: 1. Implementation of EU–ORAP project on: Improved goat production and market participation for food security and sustainable livelihoods in Zimbabwe. This project has four objectives: a. to establish an Innovation Platform to facilitate information flow between all players along the value chain and support the development of appropriate market channels, technologies and services in Zimbabwe b. to increase the efficiency of related value chain processes, ie, reduced transaction costs through improved infrastructure, information flow, technology and partnerships c. to increase the competitiveness of smallholder goat producers d. to improve feed management technologies and natural resources use 2. Household assessments using questionnaires and participatory rural appraisals 3. Facilitating and piloting marketing systems, for example, goat auctions at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) and in Gwanda 4. Capacity development of smallholder producers through training and exposure sessions, for example, exhibiting goats at ZITF and goat management and marketing trainings in Gwanda and Lupane 5. Documenting activities and processes jointly carried out by the Forum, for example, look and learn visits to Namibian livestock markets and to South African goat farms 6. Participating at national level activities for positioning and profiling the forum, for example, attending regular meetings held by the Livestock Working Group, hosted by FAO in Harare Achievements The Goat Forum’s formation and institutional set up has allowed the network to collaborate on activities such as: 1. Publishing a baseline report and briefing notes on goat production and marketing, with joint data collection, analysis, feedback to farmers and report writing 2. Holding a national workshop on enhancement of incomes and livelihoods through improved farmers’ practices on goat production and marketing in Bulawayo 3. Developing training modules on goat management and marketing, as well as new business models 4. Publishing an article in New Farmer magazine on experiences in goat auctioning at the ZITF\n\n40. 31 In terms of capacity development, the Goat Forum invested in the following activities: 1. Mobilized farmers for alternative market options, including information dissemination, association building, dialoguing with market players 2. Trained farmers on running goat farming as a business, production and marketing strategies 3. Facilitated farmer-to-farmer exchanges and other look and learn visits locally and regionally 4. Established Innovation Platforms for improved communication between farmers and market players 5. Developed marketing models (auction systems) that have been adopted by local authorities for implementation 6. Designed and published the Goat Forum brochure The Goat Forum also managed to raise new resources. We received Є1.9 million from the EU for a joint project on improved goat production and market participation for food security and sustainable livelihoods in Zimbabwe (the EU–ORAP project). Though recently launched, the activities carried out by the Goat Forum have already resulted in changes in the sector: • Farmer behavior is gradually moving from subsistence to commercialization of goats. Farmers became more aware of the causes of animal mortality; they established producer groups and increased participation in development activities. • Participating stakeholders have started to strategize and design plans that are based on market driven and business approaches. • Private sector organizations are starting to appreciate added value of business linkages and participation of rural farmers in the supply chain. Lessons learned The short period of collaboration among the stakeholders in this Forum has revealed important lessons. It is important to note that facilitating a partnership of organizations with diverse aims and interests is not easy. Such relationships are successful only if they are based on a common vision and shared objectives.Without a common vision, partners will not see the benefit of participating in an activity that does not have a bearing on what they believe. Another important lesson emerging from this collaboration is that to successfully develop effective and working partnerships, there is need for members to be honest and engage in frank dialogue, highlighting areas of conflicts and interests. Partnerships that do not disclose important information not only create operational barriers, but also create suspicion and reduce commitment to the interests of the partnership. The development of partnerships is a long-term process, not a single event. Since it takes time to build trustworthy partnerships, there is need for all partners to show their commitment and have patience in awaiting results. To this end, it is vital to realize that a partnership can only work if there are win-win opportunities and the value of participation for all partners is clear. Consultation among collaborating organizations has been noted as an important factor in cementing mutual understanding and fostering a unity of purpose, so that the organizations can effectively complement their different skills and expertise.\n\n41. 32 Conclusions Although the Goat Forum is young and still needs nurturing, it has shown great potential to provide guidance in transforming the goat sub-sector with benefits for poor households as well as commercializing farmers in the semi-arid regions of Zimbabwe. It places multi-sectoral collaboration at a new level that encourages the participation of the private and public sectors in the economic life of goat producers. Discussion Question: What does it take to be a member of the Goat Forum? Answer: Interest and motivation. It is an open forum. Question: Is it strictly corporate membership? Answer: Yes. It is not for individuals. Question: Is there a membership fee? Answer: No. The Forum is more about commitment and interest in the goat subsector. It is not just about coming together, but is action oriented. Question: To what extent has the Forum been formalized? Answer: So far the Goat Forum is informal. It is driven by the natural momentum with interest in the issues facing the goat sub-sector.\n\n42. 33 Promoting Goat Marketing through Exhibitions Darlington Sarupinda, SNV Farmers can sometimes underestimate the value of their own assets. Many farmers in Zimbabwe undervalue their livestock because they have no clear idea of the prices. By exhibiting goats at ZITF the Goat Forum in collaboration with the Bulawayo Agricultural Society attempted to demonstrate the true value of goats to farmers in Gwanda and Matobo districts and the importance of collective action. The ZITF, a week-long annual event in Bulawayo, arguably provides one of the most competitive markets for different products. This is why it was deemed the perfect location to demonstrate the commercial value of goats. In early 2007, members of the Goat Forum decided to identify and support farmers who had the ambition to exhibit goats during the ZITF which was scheduled for the end of April. Objectives The overall objective of exhibiting goats at the ZITF was to facilitate a shift in the mindsets of the farmers from keeping goats under poor management conditions to realizing how much more they can benefit from doing goat farming as a business. The specific objectives were to: • support goat producers to exhibit and sell goats at a high-value urban market, • enhance goat producers’ awareness about the existence and requirements of high-value markets, and • facilitate contacts between goat producers and market intermediaries (traders, abattoirs, transporters, etc.). Target groups, partnerships, and stakeholder involvement The target groups who were involved in exhibiting goats at the ZITF were both male and female small-scale goat farmers from Dzembe ward of Matobo district and Manama ward of Gwanda district. Matobo and Gwanda were selected because members of the Goat Forum had already some contact groups in the selected sites and these districts boasted large goat populations. The farmers actively participatedinthecompleteprocessofpreparation,exhibition,andevaluation.Farmersatbothlocations selected a representative who accompanied the goats to the ZITF. The farmer representatives manned the exhibition site on a full-time basis and interacted with the various visitors. Members of the Goat Forum facilitated farmer participation at the ZITF by contributing resources and expertise during the mobilization of farmers, transport, training, and evaluation of the initiative. Some private sector actors donated resources to cover handling, supplementary feeds, and housing the animals. A private auctioneer was responsible for organizing the auction. A number of retailers and processors registered for the auction. A reputable private sector meat-processing firm made the highest bid and bought the goats. Activities: preparation, implementation and evaluation To set the ball rolling Goat Forum members convened awareness creation meetings in Gwanda and Matobo districts a month before the ZITF. Emphasis was placed on the need to exhibit good quality goats (young, good body conditions, and castrated male goats) that would achieve higher prices at the auction. Those farmers who were interested in sending their goats to the ZITF were assisted to prepare\n\n43. 34 for this event in the selection of appropriate goats, and on the ground vaccination, dosing, and tagging for identification. A total of 20 goats were then taken to Matopos Research Station for a couple of days where they were weighed and had their hooves trimmed with the full participation of accompanying farmer representatives. A day before the start of the fair the goats were transported to the exhibition site at the ZITF grounds. Two types of goats were displayed: breeding and slaughter stock. They were displayed in open pens alongside those goats owned by research stations and commercial farmers.This gave buyers and visitors a chance to assess the goats before the actual auction. On the second day of the fair, the goats were classified according to age based on their teeth: milk, 2, 4, 6 permanent incisor teeth, or full mouth. The goats were then judged on their body condition, posture, size for age, and the width of their back. The idea was to teach farmers about the quality assessment criteria. Goats from the rural farmers competed well against the goats from research stations. Farmers with the best goats were given certificates and prizes. On the last day of the fair, the 20 goats were offered up for bidding. However, they had to be sold as one lot due to lack of appropriate infrastructure. The prices for goats went from US$0.50 to US$0.85 per kilogram live weight. Live weight prices for cattle ranged between US$1 and US$1.20 per kilogram. Thisdemonstratedtofarmersthattheirgoatsarevaluableassetsandcouldbesoldforhighlycompetitive prices. The prices they received were three times more than the prices they could have received at the farm gate. Farmers understood that by selling at the auction they created competition among the bidders which resulted in higher prices. Aweekafterthefair,feedbacksessionswereheldwherethefarmerswereabletodiscusstheirexperiences with regard to lessons learned and costs involved with members of the Goat Forum.The farmers realized the value and economies-of-scale that could be exploited from jointly marketing their goats in the high-value urban markets. Outcomes The initial benefits that came from exposing the farmers at the ZITF platform were higher prices for goats, better access to market information, and an understanding of the requirements of high-value markets. Through the auction farmers realized the value of their goats and started negotiating higher prices in their home areas. Figure 1 shows that farmers from Manama who participated in the exhibition started selling their goats at much higher prices compared to farmers in other localities in Gwanda, Beitbridge and Mwenezi. Before participating in the ZITF auction, farmers in Manama had been selling their goats at the same low price as farmers in the other locations. The increase in prices after their exposure at the ZITF translates into better access to food, health and other services if sustained in a stable macro-economic environment. Another benefit from the ZITF initiative was the formation of a producer association in Manama ward. More than 80 goat producers from six villages in Manama came together to form the Manama Goat Producers Association with the goal of improving goat production and marketing. The Association members requested the Goat Forum to provide training on goat business management and improved husbandry practices. The training resulted in farmers implementing some management strategies that would reduce kid mortality, increase kidding rates, and boost offtake rates. These include improved housing, kid management, health management and feed management.\n\n44. 35 Figure 1. Average prices per goat (US$) at different locations in Matabeleland South, Zimbabwe. Lessons learned Exhibitionsprovideausefulplatformforsmall-scalefarmerstolearnaboutmarketprocessesandestablish links with market intermediaries. A better understanding of market requirements and the support of various public and private service suppliers (stock feed suppliers, animal health services, traders, local authorities, transport, auctioneers, abattoirs, insurance) can enable farmers to sell improved animals at higher prices. Better collaboration with other stakeholders can result in better coordination, pooling of scarce resources at reduced cost, and improved service provision to the small-scale producers. Furthermore, exhibitions can encourage market development as they attract more goats for sale to supply the urban markets with higher quality products, and also as private sector actors participate with the intention of identifying new business opportunities. Way forward As a result of the ZITF initiative the Goat Forum planned a number of actions. These include: • strengthening producer groups to increase their bargaining power and competitiveness, taking up additional functions such as bulking and transport, lobbying and advocacy, • identifyingothermarketopportunitiesandfacilitatingaccesstothemarketsandmarketinformation by smallholder producers, • facilitating appropriate financial services for livestock sector players, • facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogue and partnership building resulting in appropriate livestock business models with clear working arrangements, and • supporting the development of enabling policy frameworks. 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Pricepergoat(US$) Gwanda Manama Gwanda Hwali Gwanda Mulambapeli Beitbridge Mwenezi Dec-06 Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 May-07 Jun-07 Jul-07\n\n45. 36 Discussion Question: In preparation for the ZITF, goats were dosed and vaccinated. Are these normal farmer practices? Answer: These are not normal practices for farmers in Zimbabwe. However, the preparations were meant to demonstrate to farmers good goat management practices that will result in better quality animals and eventually higher prices. Question: How does the farm gate price of goats in Zimbabwe compare to that in Namibia and South Africa? Answer: These prices cannot really be compared since Zimbabwe does not currently have a grading system.\n\n46. 37 Strengthening the Capacity of Goat Farmers through Training Trinity Senda, DAR4D Background A goat production and marketing study carried out by the Goat Forum in the six districts of Matabeleland North and South showed that farmers lose a large number of animals to mortality, instead of being used productively for consumption and sale (Homann et al., 2007). Low goat productivity keeps farmers at the stage of subsistence farming, trying to secure the survival of their existing goat herds. Under these conditions, farmers have little market orientation as few farmers have enough goats for sale and most goat sales are to cover farmers’ immediate needs. Because farmers lack alternative market options they often sell their goats at the farm gate, where they are in a bad position to negotiate prices. As a result farmers have not been realizing the full potential of goat farming as a viable source of livelihoods for a long time. Since there is no attractive incentive, farmers invest little in goat production and management, perpetuating low goat productivity. It is because of this context that the Goat Forum found it necessary to train farmers as well as other stakeholders in goat production and marketing. Objectives The overall objective of the training sessions is to enhance farmers’ understanding of marketing processes and strengthen their skills in goat production and management. This is expected to enable farmers to obtain higher benefits from their goats. The specific objectives are to: • increase farmers’ awareness that goat production is a viable enterprise for improved livelihoods if properly managed; • strengthen farmers’ capacity to produce, manage, and market goats to a level that competitive goat enterprises are established in the smallholder sector; and • increase the interaction between farmers and other stakeholders in the goat value chain so as to increase the information about market requirements and the inputs needed. Target groups The training activities target goat farmers who are in the herd building stage as well as those who are more advanced in commercialized goat production. The activities preferably address goat producer groups who can easily mobilize each other and can promise mutual assistance after the training. Activities ThetrainingactivitiesoftheGoatForumcomprisedseveralelementsfromconductingneedsassessments to the development of a farmers’needs oriented training manual to actual training sessions for farmers, as well as integrating small stock issues on the agenda of extension services and producing awareness creation and information material. Training needs assessments Training needs in goat production and marketing were identified in Manama with the Manama Goat Farmers Association. The Association consists of farmers from different villages of ward 17. Farmers highlighted high kid and goat mortalities as one of their biggest constraints to goat production. These\n\n47. 38 mortalities were attributed to poor housing, poor nutrition, and high incidence of diseases. Another area of concern to the farmers was the lack of market information such as current livestock prices; alternative markets and what the market requires. To ensure that the suggested areas of training were not lost in the preparation of the manual, two members of the Association were invited to attend one of the meetings where the manual was being drafted. Goat training manual development Based on the results from the needs assessment and recommendations of the goat production and marketing study, the Goat Forum members developed a training manual that addresses the special needs of goat farmers in semi-arid Zimbabwe. The key topics of the module include goat production (ie, health, nutrition, housing, breeding,) as well as marketing and entrepreneurship. The research finding and technologies developed on Matopos Research Station were also incorporated into the manual. Department of Livestock Production (DLPD now restructured as AGRITEX), contributed their broad experience in livestock extension work and information dissemination to farmer groups. SNV contributed information on marketing and entrepreneurship. The module was drafted in such a way that it is easy to use by farmers and plans are underway to translate it into local languages. Training sessions Actual training sessions on goat production, marketing, and entrepreneurship were held in Manama and Lupane targeting farmers who were already organized into goat producer groups. The contents of the training were based on the manual and were further modified according to farmers’special request. The training team consisted of individuals from the different organizations engaged in the Goat Forum to exploit their expertise. The methods used for training included adult learning principles, meaning that a more participatory training approach was used. Farmers were invited to own the training process by organizing the venue for the trainings and selecting the group members to attend the sessions. During the training farmers were free to contribute to the way they were trained, and the agenda was arranged accordingly. Farmers were given breaks to boost the energy levels and keep them following the discussion. Members from the Goat Forum assisted in providing the materials required for training such as stationery and transport. Extension services The local DLPD extension staff was engaged in the training and was expected to provide further goat specific extension services for these farmers after the training. The DLPD has staff stationed in the communities in order to ensure continuous interaction with farmers. The department will enhance and improve the farmers’ knowledge on goat production and marketing according to future needs. The department also drives the district agricultural shows and assists goat farmers in participating in these shows. This gives farmers an opportunity to interact with other role players in the goat sector. Flyers, posters and pamphlets The Goat Forum developed complementary material on contacts, activities, and key results that were distributed at various public places and events.This assisted in awareness creation and dissemination of key information to stakeholders along the goat value chain.\n\n48. 39 Impact Training farmers went a long way in trying to improve their knowledge base in goat production and marketing. The training contributed to raising farmers’ awareness on key production constraints, management options, and market requirements. This was evidenced by the farmers’interest to exhibit goats at the ZITF, and the type of animals they selected for this event. Most farmers are now keeping recordsongoatproductionparametersandtaggingtheiranimals.Somefarmershavestartedpurchasing veterinary supplies for their goats. The training manual has reached many hands and generated a lot of interest from various farmers and support organizations. There have been a lot of enquiries on how the manual can be made available to the public. There has also been a call from the New Farmer magazine to write an article on goat production and marketing that would cover goat farmers nationwide. Lessons learned • Farmers have a lot of knowledge with regard to goat production. However, they need more information on the exact application of management strategies to reach certain purposes, as well as options for further improvements. • Farmers learn a lot from each other and there is a lot of interaction between them. It is important to keep this momentum and strengthen farmers’ opportunity to share experiences, especially during trainings. For instance, in Manama there was a farmer who was very knowledgeable on the urea treatment of stover, and after briefly presenting how it is done other farmers understood the subject a lot better. • A practical session is always critical as farmers seemed to learn better by seeing and doing than by hearing or reading. • Follow-up visits and further training is crucial to cover the full range of goat production and marketing issues during the different seasons of a year. Way forward • To promote easier understanding, the training manual needs to be translated into the vernacular. • Toreachagreateraudience,themanualshouldbepublishedandtrainingopportunitiesforfarmers should be advertised to various partners and at different events. • There is need for further training of extension workers on goat production and marketing as they are in close contact with the farmers and can build on and further develop the training activities in their respective areas. • Funds need to be availed for the further dissemination of training material as well as conducting training sessions for farmers and extension workers.

Answer: The manual covers various aspects of goat production, management and marketing, but not farmer group formation. The topics covered are based on farmers’ requests on training, and can be extended. Question: How easy is it for one farmer to transfer the training to others? Answer: The manual is still being worked on to make it more user-friendly. Comment: Please involve extension agents in the development of the manual in order to get their inputs on layout, content and how it will be best addressed to the farmers. Answer: Stakeholders are being invited to give their inputs into the manual. Question: What extension methods are you using to conduct the training? Answer: Adult extension with farmer participation in a classroom approach."
