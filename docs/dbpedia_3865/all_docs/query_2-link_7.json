        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe killer whale (Orcinus orca) is an apex predator found in all the world's oceans (Forney & Wade, 2006). Although a generalist species, studies have revealed discrete prey specializations of sympatric populations in some regions (e.g., Ford et al., 1998; Saulitis, Matkin, Barrett‐Lennard, Heise, & Ellis, 2000) with foraging behaviors apparently culturally transmitted through generations within matrilineal social units (Ford & Ellis, 2014; Riesch, Barrett‐Lennard, Ellis, Ford, & Deecke, 2012). Through cultural divergence and social isolation of specialized groups, prey specialization may influence population structure (Hoelzel et al., 2007; Riesch et al., 2012), and eventually facilitate ecotype formation (Foote et al., 2016). Due to different patterns of resource use, killer whale populations may be differentially impacted by human activities. In the coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific, so‐called resident killer whales rely on salmonids as a main food source while transient killer whales appear to feed exclusively on marine mammal prey (e.g., Ford & Ellis, 2014; Ford et al., 1998). The resident and transient killer whale communities constitute distinct populations and ecotypes (Morin et al., 2010). Divergent demographic trends for these populations since the mid‐1990s have resulted in disparate conservation status and management strategies (COSEWIC, 2008). This is an example of why understanding interindividual diet variations may be important in the management of this species.\n\nIn the North Atlantic, at least two types of killer whales differing in morphology, tooth wear and nitrogen isotopic values have been suggested (Foote, Newton, Piertney, Willerslev, & Gilbert, 2009). A far‐ranging generalist so‐called Type 1 includes herring‐feeding killer whales off Norway and Iceland, but with interindividual variation in the dietary proportions of contributing prey items, including high trophic level prey (Foote et al., 2009). This suggestion was supported by a variation in intrapopulation ecological niche in Iceland (Samarra et al., 2018; Samarra, Vighi, Aguilar, & Vikingsson, 2017), and field observations of a subset of individuals switching between pinniped and fish prey from both Norway (Vongraven & Bisther, 2014) and Iceland (Foote, Similä, Vikingsson, & Stevick, 2010). In contrast, larger Type 2 killer whales appear to specialize on cetacean prey (Foote et al., 2009). However, current classification in two types may be oversimplistic considering the large diversity of ecological/dietary patterns across the North Atlantic (see Jourdain, Ugarte, et al., 2019 for a review). Foraging strategies of North Atlantic killer whales at the group and individual levels remain poorly understood.\n\nKiller whales in Norway have historically been thought to specialize on herring (Clupea harengus) and to mainly associate with the most abundant Norwegian Spring Spawning (NSS) stock (Similä, Holst, & Christensen, 1996), as supported by concurrent observations. Herring made up almost the entire stomach contents of killer whales caught prior to 1980 (Christensen, 1982, 1982), and killer whales typically occur in large seasonal aggregations at herring wintering grounds (Bisther & Vongraven, 1995; Similä et al., 1996), where they display remarkably specialized feeding behaviors (Domenici, Batty, Similä, & Ogam, 2000; Similä & Ugarte, 1993). However, as killer whale studies have primarily been conducted at herring wintering grounds until recently, other prey utilized in other areas were unlikely to be identified. Research efforts extended to other seasons and regions in Norwegian waters have documented new prey species, for example, the Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus, Nøttestad et al., 2014), the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Vester & Hammerschmidt, 2013), the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena, Cosentino, 2015), and the gray (Halichoerus grypus) and harbor (Phoca vitulina) seals (Jourdain, Vongraven, Bisther, & Karoliussen, 2017; Vongraven & Bisther, 2014). However, the lack of identification data and/or only brief periods of data collection for these studies precluded any assessment of dietary differences and specializations among killer whale individuals/groups.\n\nEfforts began in 2013 to investigate feeding habits at the individual level, combining predation records of photo‐identified individuals, behavioral observations, and tissue samples collected throughout multiple years (Jourdain, Karoliussen, Vos, Zakharov, & Tougard, 2019; Jourdain et al., 2017, this study). Results revealed that some social groups specialize to some extent on pinnipeds (Jourdain et al., 2017) and that some herring‐eating individuals seasonally switch to feeding on locally abundant lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) in spring (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019). Social interactions among sympatric killer whales adopting distinct foraging behaviors have not been investigated to date. Field observations provide only a snapshot of observable feeding bouts; combining observational records with time‐integrated dietary markers would assist in assessing interindividual variations in diet, as well as persistency of prey specialization over longer periods of time.\n\nBecause the isotopic composition of a predator's tissue reflects that of its prey resources in a predictable/quantifiable manner (DeNiro & Epstein, 1978), stable isotopes have been commonly used in dietary studies (see Newsome, Clementz, & Koch, 2010 for a review). Due to a greater retention of the heavier 15N isotope than the lighter 14N isotope in the production of nitrogenous waste, the nitrogen ratio of 15N to 14N (δ15N) shows a stepwise enrichment from food source to consumer and is therefore indicative of relative trophic position (DeNiro & Epstein, 1978; Hobson & Clark, 1992). The carbon ratio of 13C to 12C (δ13C), primarily reflects variable carbon origins of inshore/benthic versus pelagic/offshore sources, therefore allowing for discrimination between feeding locations in marine systems (Hobson, Piatt, & Pitocchelli, 1994). Typically, inshore/benthic ecosystems are characterized by higher δ13C values than pelagic/offshore systems. Isotopic variance within a population, characterized by variance in the δ13C and δ15N values of its individuals, can be used as a measure of diet variation, referred to as niche width (Bearhop, Adams, Waldron, Fuller, & Macleod, 2004). Typically, consumers that feed on a wide range of food sources will display larger variations in isotopic signatures and thus a wider niche than prey specialists that feed on a narrow range of prey. Similarly, consumers that feed in multiple locations will show greater variations in δ13C, that is, a wider niche (Bearhop et al., 2004).\n\nIn the study of killer whales, high variability in δ15N and δ13C values has proved effective in assessing inter and intrapopulation dietary variations and preferences (Durban, Fearnbach, Burrows, Ylitalo, & Pitman, 2017; Herman et al., 2005; Krahn et al., 2007; Reisinger et al., 2016; Samarra et al., 2017; Tixier et al., 2019). Isotopic profiles confirmed dietary segregation between sympatric resource specialists in the northeastern Pacific (Herman et al., 2005) and around the Antarctic Peninsula (Durban et al., 2017) but also revealed generalist killer whale populations adopting a mixed diet including both fish and mammal prey (Reisinger et al., 2016; Tixier et al., 2019). In these studies, a priori knowledge of sampled individuals/populations through previous field observations has been highly beneficial for meaningful interpretation of dietary patterns (Newsome et al., 2010).\n\nIn this study, we use δ15N and δ13C values from killer whale skin samples collected throughout the year in northern Norway. The aims were to (a) measure interindividual variations in dietary habits by comparing isotopic profiles, that is, trophic level and niche width, of fish and seal‐eating killer whales; (b) estimate the contribution of pinniped prey to the diet of seal‐eating killer whales. Results are discussed in light of predation records available for the sampled whales to assess consistency in individuals’ dietary habits and further evaluate the degree of prey specialization for these whales.\n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n2.1. Sample collection\n\nKiller whale biopsy samples were collected in August and November 2017 and from April through July 2018 in northern Norway. In November, samples were collected in Kvænangen, Skjervøy (Figure ). This fjord was part of the herring wintering grounds (ICES, 2018), and killer whales were observed foraging on herring at time of sampling. The rest of the year, samples were collected off Andøya (Figure ), where killer whales were encountered throughout the year and are known to seasonally feed on various prey types including herring (Jourdain & Vongraven, 2017), pinnipeds (Jourdain et al., 2017), and lumpfish (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019).\n\nKiller whale biopsies were sampled using an ARTS darting system (Restech) and 25 × 9 mm or 40 × 9 mm stainless steel tips in 2017, and with an injection gun (Pneu‐Dart Inc) and 25 × 7 mm tips in 2018. The biopsy tips were sterilized with boiling water and 95% ethanol and placed in clean plastic bags before use. Killer whales were sampled when travelling or feeding. The region directly posterior to the dorsal fin of adult and subadult killer whales was the target area for sampling. For each sampled individual, identification photographs were taken. Biopsy darts containing skin and blubber were retrieved, stored in a clean plastic bag and placed in a cooling box while at sea. Onshore, skin and blubber layers were sliced apart and stored separately at −20°C until analysis. Isotopic values measured in killer whale skin are expected to represent the individuals’ diet in the four to six weeks prior to sampling. This is based on controlled diet experiments that estimated half‐time turnover rates for bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops trucuntus) skin to be 24 ± 8 d for carbon and 48 ± 19 d for nitrogen (Giménez, Ramírez, Almunia, Forero, & Stephanis, 2016).\n\nEstimating the diet of consumers requires isotopic prey values. Because isotopic values may vary greatly both in space and time, it is important that both prey and killer whales are sampled within matching geographic areas and time periods (Phillips et al., 2014). Herring muscle (n = 4) was collected in November 2017 in Kvænangen, Skjervøy, lumpfish muscle (n = 5) was collected in March–April 2017 in Andfjord while conducting focal studies of feeding killer whales (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019). Muscle from a dead stranded harbor seal was sampled in November 2017 in Andenes.\n\n2.2. Data processing\n\nSampled killer whales were identified using nicks, shape and size of the dorsal fin, and scarring and pigmentation patterns of the saddle patch (Bigg, 1982). Individuals were matched to an existing catalogue of 971 killer whales identified between 2007 and 2018 in northern Norway (Jourdain & Karoliussen, 2018). Classification of sex was done as per Bigg (1982). Records of predation on seals collected in 2013–2018 were used to assign sampled killer whales a priori to one of the two diet groups. Individuals with a history of predation on seals were assigned to the group Seal‐eaters, while individuals with no such history were classified as Fish‐eaters. In addition, individuals were assigned a group reflecting season at sampling. Group Winter included individuals sampled at herring wintering grounds in November, group Spring contained individuals sampled at lumpfish spawning grounds in April–May and group Summer included the whales sampled from June through August in Andfjord (Figure ).\n\n2.3. Stable isotope analysis\n\nSkin samples from killer whales, and muscle from lumpfish, herring, and seal were freeze‐dried and ground individually with an agate mortar and pestle to a fine powder. An aliquot was rinsed three times in a 2:1 chloroform: methanol solution to remove lipids, following the method developed by Folch, Lees, and Stanley (1957) and modified by Elliott, Roth, and Crook (2017). An aliquot from the bulk tissue was not treated with any chloroform: methanol solution. A duplicate analysis was run on nonlipid‐extracted and lipid‐extracted values, in accordance with recommendations (Lesage et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2012). δ13C values were determined from lipid‐extracted samples to control for the low δ13C found in the lipid fraction of an organism that can lead to bias (DeNiro & Epstein, 1978; Tarroux et al., 2010; Yurkowski, Hussey, Semeniuk, Ferguson, & Fisk, 2015). δ15N values were determined from nonlipid‐extracted samples due to the unpredictable changes in δ15N values in fish muscle and cetacean skin following lipid extraction (Lesage et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2012). The powdered sample (1 mg ± 5%) was weighed into a tin capsule. The δ15N and δ13C ratios were measured simultaneously using an Elemental Analyzer (EA) IsoLink Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) System, consisting of a Flash EA and a DeltaV IRMS (Thermo Scientific, Germany). All analyses were conducted at the Stable Isotope Laboratory at the University of Oslo. The quality of the analysis was assured by the incorporation into each run two internal reference materials, JGLUT (L‐glutamic acid, δ13C = −13.43‰, δ15N = −4.34‰, Fisher Scientific) and POPPGLY (glycine, δ13C = −36.58‰, δ15N = 11.25‰, Fisher Scientific). δ13C was calibrated to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) scale using LSVEC (lithium carbonate, δ13C = −46.6‰) and NBS‐ 19 (calcium carbonate, δ13C = 1.95‰) (both obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Austria). δ15N was calibrated to the AIR scale using USGS40 (L‐glutamic acid, δ15N = −4.52‰) and USGS41 (L‐glutamic acid, δ15N = 47.57‰) (both obtained from the United States Geological Survey). Analytical precision based on repeated analyses of quality assurance material JALA (alanine, δ13C = −20.62‰, δ15N = −3.16‰, Fisher Scientific) indicated measurement errors of 0.09 ± 0.01‰ for δ15N and 0.06 ± 0.02‰ for δ13C.\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nAll statistics were performed in R v.3.4.1. for Mac OS X (R Development Core Team, 2017). The α level was set to p = .05. To test simultaneously the effect of independent variables sex, diet group (Seal‐eaters vs. Fish‐eaters), and sampling season group (Winter, Spring, and Summer) on isotopic ratios, a multiple linear regression model was fitted to the data measured for δ15N and δ13C. Diagnostic plots were used to investigate normality of the residuals, while Levene's test run in the package car (Fox & Weisberg, 2011) was used to validate homogeneity of variance in residuals. Significant explanatory variables were identified by conducting a forward model selection in the package stats, from the null model to the full global model featuring all variables. A lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for model selection, and a higher adjusted R‐squared as an indication of the fit of each model.\n\nA mixture model‐based clustering analysis using the mclust package was conducted on the δ15N and δ13C values to estimate the most likely number of clusters and the probability of individuals belonging to each cluster (Scrucca, Fop, Murphy, & Raftery, 2016). The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to select the best model. Individual assignment to clusters was compared to field observations for validation.\n\nThe isotopic niche, referring to the isospace delineated by δ15N and δ13C values, of resulting clusters was estimated using calculated convex hull areas (encompassing all data points) and bivariate ellipses in the package SIBER (Jackson, Inger, Parnell, & Bearhop, 2011). The Standard Ellipse Area (SEA) is a measure of the standard deviation for bivariate data. SEA corrected for small sample size (SEAC), containing 40% of the data regardless the sample size, enabled robust comparison between clusters. Bayesian Standard Ellipse Areas (SEAB) were generated using 106 posterior draws for each cluster and used to statistically compare niche width between clusters (Jackson et al., 2011).\n\nWe used stable isotope mixing models (Parnell et al., 2013) in the package simmr (Parnell, 2016) to estimate relative contributions of herring, lumpfish, and seal prey to the diet of seal‐eating killer whales at the cluster level. All three prey groups were confirmed to be part of the diet of seal‐eating killer whales from field observations (see Table and Discussion). In a Bayesian framework, and accounting for the putative diet components of a consumer and uncertainties in both food source and consumer isotopic values, models estimate the distributions of possible diets. Killer whale δ15N and δ13C skin values were input as the consumer data and mean (±SD) isotopic values of herring, lumpfish, and seal muscle were used as sources (see Results). To set uncertainty around the single data point available for seal prey, we used published uncertainty data (SDδ13C = 0.2, SDδ15N = 0.3) on isotopic muscle values from stranded harbor seals (n = 9) that were collected over a short period of time and from a single region (Hobson, Sease, Merrick, & Piatt, 1997). Concentration dependencies and corrections for trophic discrimination, only optional when running mixing models with simmr, were not computed. Due to the large variation in both δ15N and δ13C values (see Results) among seal‐eating killer whales, mixing models were also run at the individual level using the same segment values.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nWhale IDSexAgeClusterDiet at samplingSampling monthδ15Nδ13C(a priori) Fish‐eating individualsNKW‐063MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.5NKW‐153MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.6NKW‐165MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.4NKW‐180MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.8−19.6NKW‐183MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.9−19.4NKW‐421MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.0NKW‐506MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.6NKW‐511FemaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.4−19.7NKW‐862MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.9−18.9NKW‐867MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.5−19.2NKW‐918MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.5−19.4NKW‐919MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.8−19.8NKW‐920MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.6−19.6NKW‐922MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.7−19.1NKW‐923MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.6−18.9NKW‐924MaleAdultSeal‐eaterHerringNovember12.6−18.3NKW‐937MaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.9−19.5UNK 1 N/ASubadultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.4−19.2NKW‐004MaleAdultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.8−18.1NKW‐079MaleAdultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.5−17.7NKW‐348MaleAdultHerring‐eaterLumpfishApril11.5−19.2NKW‐537FemaleAdultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.5−18.4NKW‐572MaleAdultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.5−18.3NKW‐714MaleSubadultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.9−18.3NKW‐908N/AN/ALumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.8−18.2NKW‐978N/AN/ALumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.3−18.3Y137N/ASubadultLumpfish‐eaterLumpfishApril11.5−18.1NKW‐598MaleAdultLumpfish‐eaterN/AJuly11.3−18.6(a priori) Seal‐eating individualsNKW‐785FemaleAdultHerring‐eaterHerringNovember11.5−19.2K1FemaleAdultSeal‐eaterLumpfishMay12.6−18.5KI01MaleAdultSeal‐eaterN/ANovember12.4−19.4KI03FemaleAdultSeal‐eaterN/ANovember12.3−20.0KI05MaleAdultSeal‐eaterN/ANovember12.8−19.2KI06FemaleAdultSeal‐eaterPinnipedsAugust13.2−18.9KI07MaleAdultSeal‐eaterPinnipedsJune12.3−18.0NKW‐096FemaleAdultSeal‐eaterPinnipedsAugust12.5−19.1NKW‐823N/AN/ASeal‐eaterPinnipedsAugust12.9−19.4NKW‐921MaleAdultSeal‐eaterPinnipedsAugust12.5−18.5\n\nExpected δ15N and δ13C values were also calculated for herring, lumpfish, and seal‐eaters if they were prey specialists using the diet‐to‐tissue skin discrimination factors 1.57 ± 0.52‰ and 1.01 ± 0.37‰ for nitrogen and carbon, respectively, as estimated for bottlenose dolphins by Giménez et al. (2016). The following equations were used, as per Herman et al. (2005):\n\nδN-expected=∑i=1nDieti∗δ15Ni+1.57\n\nδC-expected=∑i=1nDieti∗δ13Ci+1.01\n\nwhere n is the number of different prey species consumed, Diet i is the proportion of each prey species consumed, and δ15N i and δ13C i are the measured isotopic ratio values of the ith prey species being herring, lumpfish, or seal.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nRecent killer whale studies in Norway suggested multiple prey resources (Cosentino, 2015; Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019; Jourdain et al., 2017; Nøttestad et al., 2014; Vester & Hammerschmidt, 2013; Vongraven & Bisther, 2014) as opposed to initial observations of killer whales being herring specialists in this region (Christensen, 1982; Similä et al., 1996). Our results further support a generalist population characterized by interindividual dietary variations. Low variation in δ15N and δ13C skin values for killer whales sampled at herring and lumpfish grounds supported previous field observations of seasonal specialization on abundant fish prey (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019; Similä et al., 1996; Similä & Ugarte, 1993). Higher δ15N skin values measured throughout the year for individuals repeatedly observed feeding on seals in 1988–2016 (Jourdain et al., 2017; Vongraven & Bisther, 2014) supported persistent feeding at higher trophic level and marked preference for pinniped prey for these whales, though a wide isotopic niche indicated a diversified diet.\n\nHerring and lumpfish‐eating killer whales had similar δ15N values, indicative of feeding at comparable trophic levels. Low variation in δ15N and δ13C values in herring‐eaters (Cluster 2) resulted in the narrowest niche of the three clusters, implying consistency in diet among individuals and apparent prey specialization in the winter months of high herring abundance. This is consistent with Foote, Vester, Vikingsson, and Newton (2012) who found only little variation in isotopic values (mean ± SD: 11.8 ± 0.5, range = 10.9–12.9, n = 20) in killer whales sampled at herring wintering grounds in northern Norway in 2005 and 2007. Lumpfish‐eating killer whales (Cluster 3), sampled in the first half of April in Andfjord, were shown to seasonally feed on lumpfish, based on predatory observations and molecular identification of target prey (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019). These whales showed a slightly wider isotopic niche, possibly indicative of a gradual seasonal switch in diet, from herring to lumpfish. As the wintering herring initiates its progressive migration southwards to spawning grounds at the end of January in the study area (Røttingen, 1990), the lumpfish migration from offshore feeding areas to inland spawning grounds starts in February (Eriksen, Durif, & Prozorkevich, 2014). Such overlap in time and space between the two fish species could promote temporary inclusion of both fish prey in killer whales’ diet. Indeed, sampled lumpfish‐eating killer whales were confirmed to be feeding on herring from winter encounters between 2015 and 2018 (Jourdain, Karoliussen, et al., 2019). In any case, seasonal specialization on lumpfish is likely reflecting a seasonal local peak in prey abundance rather than true dietary preference.\n\nA few individuals sampled at herring grounds (i.e., whales KI01, KI03, KI05, and NKW‐924) and lumpfish grounds (i.e., whale K1) showed higher δ15N skin values, indicative of feeding on higher trophic level prey. These whales were assigned to Cluster 1: seal‐eaters for which distinctive enrichment in 15N correlated with apparent inclusion of seals in their diet. This was confirmed from field observations for nine of the 10 whales in this cluster (see Jourdain et al., 2017). Seal‐eaters showed δ15N skin values in average 1.0‰, and up to 1.9‰, higher compared to fish‐eaters, regardless of sampling season. These values are consistent with approximately one trophic level, assuming an estimated discrimination factor of ~1.57‰ for nitrogen for bottlenose dolphin (Giménez et al., 2016). This falls within or exceeds the range of values discriminative of fish versus marine mammal‐eating killer whales in Iceland (ΔN = 1.32‰ in Samarra et al., 2017), British Columbia/Washington State (ΔN = 0.7‰, in Herman et al., 2005), Eastern Aleutian Islands (ΔN = 1.2‰ in Herman et al., 2005), and Antarctica (ΔN = 0.9‰ in Durban et al., 2017). Disparate isotopic profiles among individuals sampled at matching times and locations in our study indicate co‐occurrence of individuals that include, and others that do not include, pinnipeds to their diet. Elevated δ15N values found in three of the 20 killer whales sampled at herring wintering grounds by Foote et al. (2012) also suggested such dietary structuring.\n\nCombined with individual predation records collected over years and up to several decades (see Jourdain et al., 2017; Vongraven & Bisther, 2014), our results confirm persistent dietary preference rather than opportunistic feeding on pinnipeds for these whales. Consistently elevated δ15N values for all ten seal‐eaters (Cluster 1) sampled in all seasons further indicated that predation on seals (or other high trophic level prey) occurred throughout the year, even at times of high abundance of fish prey. This was supported by strikingly similar skin δ15N values measured for individuals KI01, KI03, and KI07. All three individuals were shown to constitute a stable long‐lasting social group that hunts and feeds cooperatively (Jourdain et al., 2017), and therefore, comparable diet and isotopic profiles are expected for these whales. Although sampled in different seasons for this study (see Table ), year‐round homogeneous δ15N values support consistent feeding habits for this group regardless of the time of the year.\n\nA wider isotopic niche found for seal‐eating killer whales compared to fish‐eaters implies a more diversified diet. This was supported by the following observations of seal‐eating individuals also feeding on fish prey. Adult males NKW‐924 and KI01 were photographed while scavenging around herring‐purse seiners in November 2017 and 2018 (EJ, unpublished data), respectively, confirming effective inclusion of herring to their diets. Whales KI03, KI05, and KI06 were also observed carousel feeding on herring off Ona, Møre coast, Norway in 1991, immediately prior to travelling near‐shore to chase harbor seals (Vongraven & Bisther, 2014). Female K1 was observed feeding on lumpfish at time of sampling in May 2018 before resuming nearshore foraging as previously described for seal‐eating groups (Jourdain et al., 2017). Expected δ15N values calculated for seal‐eaters if they were prey specialists were in further support of a mixed diet (Table ).\n\nWhen computing herring, lumpfish, and harbor seal as putative prey of seal‐eating killer whales (Cluster 1), isotope mixing models suggested that seal prey made up 46 to 68% of these whales’ diet (2.5 and 97.5% quartiles at the cluster level), therefore suggesting fish prey as an equal or secondary food source (Figure ). However, these results should only be considered preliminary and interpreted with caution due to small sample size for both killer whale and prey values, and due to the limitations and assumptions involved in the use of these models. Mixing models are very sensitive to the assumption that all potential prey sources are computed (Bond & Diamond, 2011; Parnell et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2014), which can be confirmed if isotopic values of the consumer fall within the mixing polygon of the connecting food sources once corrected for trophic fractionation (Phillips & Koch, 2002). This was not the case here (see Figure ), implying missing prey sources. Also, if there was large temporal and/or individual variation in diet composition; that is, not all seal‐eating individuals in Cluster 1 feeding on all three prey types, and not at time of sampling, computing herring, lumpfish, and seal prey could be unsuitable (Phillips et al., 2014; Phillips & Koch, 2002). Another caveat in our models resides in the use of variation values from harbor seals that were not collected in our study area. Further efforts in monitoring food sources to better obtain a priori knowledge on individuals’ diet, and collecting prey samples, are warranted. More complete datasets and inclusion of appropriate trophic discrimination factors would allow for more accurate diet reconstruction (Phillips et al., 2014) of seal‐eating killer whales in Norway and should be a priority for future research.\n\nNevertheless, the large variation observed in estimated dietary contributions among seal‐eating killer whales is consistent with the wide isotopic niche that characterizes this cluster (Figures , , ). Importantly, there might be a gradient of dietary patterns among Norwegian killer whales ranging from fish specialists (Clusters 2 and 3: herring and lumpfish‐eaters) on one end to individuals that feed most extensively on high trophic level prey (Cluster 1: seal‐eaters) on the other end. Contrasting field observations and isotopic values for whale NKW‐785 support this theory. This female was observed feeding on pinnipeds on one encounter day in June 2017 (EJ unpublished data) and feeding on herring at time of sampling in November of the same year. Owing to low δ15N skin values, this whale was assigned to the cluster herring‐eaters by the Gaussian mixture model, bringing evidence that not all killer whales known as seal‐eaters from field observations forage on pinnipeds throughout the year. Instead, some individuals may seasonally switch between specialized feeding behaviors or may only opportunistically feed on seals.\n\nVariations in δ13C among the three sampling groups support variable foraging areas in relation to seasonal prey movement and/or foraging on prey that utilize different habitats. The lowest δ13C values measured for herring‐eaters (Cluster 2) sampled in November at herring wintering grounds coincide with killer whales just returning from their summer offshore distribution (Nøttestad et al., 2014, 2015), following the migration of the herring to the coastal wintering grounds in early fall. Lower δ13C values could also be a result of specializing on herring, which is a pelagic fish spending most of its life offshore (Dragesund, Hamre, & Ulltang, 1980). The highest δ13C values measured in killer whales sampled at lumpfish spawning grounds in spring (Cluster 3) were indicative of a coastal habitat for these whales. This is consistent with a winter spent in fjords foraging on wintering herring but could also be a result of temporarily specializing on the lumpfish which is a semipelagic fish (Davenport, 1985). Intermediate δ13C values for whales sampled from June through August could indicate intergroup variations in foraging areas due to a mosaic of prey resources (Jourdain et al., 2017; Nøttestad et al., 2014; Similä et al., 1996) relied upon at this time of the year.\n\nExpected values of δ15N and δ13C in skin of killer whales that would exclusively feed on seal prey indicate that pinniped‐eating individuals sampled in this study are not prey specialists. Vongraven and Bisther (2014) suggested that the near total collapse of the NSS herring in 1970 caused by overfishing, could have forced a herring‐dependent population of killer whales to switch to other prey types including pinnipeds. Phenotypic plasticity and the ability to learn and culturally transmit new hunting techniques may have facilitated such a switch (Riesch et al. 2012; Samarra & Miller, 2015). Further resource specialization may increase foraging efficiency if experienced foragers benefit from enhanced searching and handling abilities of better selected cost‐effective prey (see Bolnick et al., 2003). Under consistent environmental conditions, and if prey specialists indeed experienced a greater fitness than generalists, the level of prey specialization could increase over time regardless of target prey, as shown in other species (Annett & Pierotti, 1999; Golet, Kuletz, Roby, & Irons, 2000).\n\nDespite a small sample size, our study captured a diversity of dietary patterns largely consistent with field observations. Results highlight dietary structuring and differences in prey specialization within this killer whale population which could reflect either seasonal localized food abundance, individuals’ true dietary preferences, or both. Resampling of individuals over time and throughout the year would assist in assessing intraindividual dietary variations. While links between diet, genetics and social structure remain to be investigated in this region, our observations confirm that at least seasonal range overlap occurs among killer whale groups adopting distinct diets."
