        "text": "Most people underestimate the importance of good spatial planning and the impact it can have on their space as a fundamental element of the interior design process.\n\n1. It starts with an in-depth analysis of how space is to be used by individual’s lifestyles, objects, events.\n\n2. We then draw up a plan that defines the zones of the space and the activities that will take place in these specific zones. The space plan will also define the circulation patterns that show how people will move through the zones.\n\n3. The plan is finished by adding details such as furniture, equipment and hardware placement.\n\nDesign themes and colours are customisable to cater to our individual clients. As such, we encourage our clients to discuss their design aspirations with us to help ignite the creative design process, and to ensure any added fixtures or furniture will be able to serve its purpose within the living space.\n\nA well-designed living space greatly improves your overall wellbeing, so why not invest in making it the best you possibly can? With personalized decor, a well-planned pre-construction consultation, and the right functional features, you can bring your own personality to your space, and turn it into a home you’ll love to live in for years to come. Your chosen materials and colors are critical in determining your final design as well as the reliability and durability of your fixtures. This is why we work to provide our clients with our expert advice at every stage, to ensure their final space possesses both form and functions."
