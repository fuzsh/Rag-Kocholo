        "text": "Witchcraft and Witchcraft Cleansing in Southern Zimbabwe 41 'Vnthropos 102.2007 for giving permission to these Tsikas because what they leave behind after their divination is hatred, conflicts, jealousy amongst families and relatives. Different Modes of Witchcraft From the above voices from Hwali and Patana villagers it is possible to discern different modes °f witchcraft with different moral overtones (En- glund 1996:271) revealing hotbeds and motives °f witchcraft, and also disclosing who uses witch craft accusations against whom in what contexts amongst Hwali and Patana villagers. One com mon denominator for all of them are increasing inequalities in the community. Inequalities have, °f course, always existed in the small-scale kin communities in the area and conflicts have then largely been solved within the frame of ancestral re ligion, explaining misfortunes and sickness by the displeasures of the ancestors. In this way, in ternal conflicts could be solved without blaming and fracturing too many interpersonal relations. In time with the land squeeze, the resettle ment, and fragmentation of the Sotho, Venda, and ^debele groups in Gwanda South and Hwali in smaller households, there is, according to infor mants, a decline in corporate ancestral rites, a pat tern accelerating after 1980 and the dispowerment °f traditional leaders. At the same time there is an increase in labour migration, and the emergence of Christian churches and sects that further weakens cooperation and solidarity built on the earlier kin settlements. This is a development common in the whole labour migration region, and it leads to new forms of inequality and causes new conflicts between kin and neighbours. In such a context witchcraft accusations get renewed impetus. In many respects the phenomena of witchcraft an d gossip (see Gluckman 1963; Paine 1967) have similarities. Both work hand in hand (to many People in Patana gossiping and quarrelling are s ymptoms of witchcraft) and the increase of gossip a nd backbiting opens the way for witchcraft accu sions and mirrors differentiation and inequalities ln the community. 14 * Gossip can, as do witchcraft Sensations, function as “a culturally controlled §ame with important social functions,” the fore most being to preserve the social unity and moral- % of social groups by controlling competing and eviating individuals (Gluckman 1963:312). But, 14 Michael Taussig (1993:85), Adam Ashforth (1996:1194), and Peter Geschiere (1997: 204) note, both witchcraft and gossip can be characterized as “public secrets.” as with witchcraft and witchcraft accusations, gos sip can also be seen more instrumental, and as such, apart from “a genre of informal information,” foremost as “a device intended to forward and protect individual interests” (Paine 1967: 278). Thus, there are gossip and rumours of corrup tion of ward leaders appropriating new resources for themselves and their relatives. This also applies to the more successful cattle rearing and farming families and individuals in the community and their relatives and in-laws, many of whom are working outside the area. Such families are seen by the more disadvantaged as accumulating an in appropriate share of the resources of the area and, when they bring in resources from outside, of not sharing these with poorer families and settlement lines. Thus, it is in such conditions of scarcity and inequality, where gossip and backbiting persist, that we see how witchcraft or sorcery step in. The idiom of witchcraft becomes dynamic and useful in this setting, and should not be seen as too dis tant from Western idioms of “exploitation,” “cor ruption,” and “intrusive government” (MacGaffey 1997: ix), especially in contexts of resources com ing from outside, as in development programmes. Harri Englund (1996:273) argues with data from Dedza villagers in Malawi that it is not anxi eties over “modernity” as such (see Comaroff and Comaroff 1993), that mould witchcraft discourses in many rural areas of Africa. We must instead see witchcraft discourses as situated, historically, with in particular sociohistorical conditions that have evolved out of modernity in the rural areas. In this respect he holds that such discourses “con stitute an argument about moral personhood and represent individualism as an inversion of moral ity.” Accordingly, Englund finds that the Dedza villagers’ discourses of witchcraft are shaped by how and why accumulation of wealth takes place and by whom. He notes that there are three modes of witchcraft in the area based on envy, greed, and protection, and that they reflect “a morality of accumulation,” which shows that individualism is not restricted to specific modes of livelihood (Englund 1996:274). Applying Englund’s argument on the witchcraft discourses on Hwali ward and Patana village, we can discern how similar images of the moral person and accumulation inform these discourses and mirror a local society over a number of years participating in the process of commoditization. Thus it is possible to discern three broad modes of witchcraft in the context of unequal access to resources and employment in Hwali ward as they are represented by the voices of the villagers."
