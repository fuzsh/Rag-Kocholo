There is a reason why MoP changed them for the better. And before you call MoP talent trees cookie cutter, the TBC ones are as well. You basically only have one option in order to get the best performance out of your class. Maybe a hybrid system that allowed you to pick from multiple specs like how TBC talent trees work. While I doubt that Blizzard will add this, can someone please make an add-on to?\n\nAnd before someone says “Go back to Retail,” you can’t play TBC in Retail. While Outland may be in Retail you can’t go back and do the old raid bosses. The mechanics just don’t work properly. These raids were made for the TBC class design. These outdated complex talent trees will scare off new boosted players (which are the people that the boost is aimed at)."
