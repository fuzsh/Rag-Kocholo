        "text": "Our History\n\nThe Continental Hotel originally opened in 1866 as the Jefferson House, but burnt to the ground in 1893. Rebuilt in the same year The Continental Hotel today is a striking image of the original from a century ago, from the outside fa√ßade, to the painstakingly maintained tile floors and tin ceilings, to the original reception desk. While indulging our guests with modern amenities in all our rooms, original photos and antiquities throughout the hotel provide a glimpse back in time at our community over the years.\n\nOur Community\n\nThe Continental Hotel isn't just a hotel. It's part of a living legacy to preserve the historic community established by philanthropist, entrepreneur and Iowa native, Morgan E. Cline. In addition to our business and tourism hotel services, we are also a social enterprise, providing a limited number of affordable senior living units to members of the Centerville, Iowa community. We also rent out our Majestic Theater, an affiliated property of The Continental Hotel, at heavily subsidized rates to local non-profit groups for fundraisers and cultural events.\n\nIn partnership with the Morgan E. Cline Perpetual Charitable Foundation, any profits made support historic preservation, economic development, entrepreneurship and cultural opportunities in Appanoose County."
