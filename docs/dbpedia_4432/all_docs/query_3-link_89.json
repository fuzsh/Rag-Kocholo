        "text": "Learn about the Washington-Centerville Public Library's rich 200+ year-old history.\n\nEarly Beginnings\n\nThe Library's history traces back to 1810, seven years after Ohio became a state, when literate Yankee settlers formed the Washington Social Library Company. This joint stock company was modeled after America's first subscription library founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1731. Chartered by the newly elected General Assembly of the State of Ohio, the Washington Social Library Company flourished for some thirty years, until 1840.\n\nForerunner of the public library was the Centerville Library Club, organized circa 1900. The Rev. B. F. Vaughn, Ida Weller, and other community leaders met in members' homes for literary programs and raised funds for books by sponsoring theater productions and lyceums. In 1930, they turned over their collection of some 150 volumes to the newly incorporated Washington Township Public Library. Seven Library trustees were appointed by the Board of Education, as they are now, and tax monies were made available by the Montgomery County auditor.\n\nGoing Public\n\nThe first public library was located in two rooms of the early red brick home of Sara and May Anderson on West Franklin Street. Mrs. Minnie McNeil was named the first librarian at a salary of $360 per year. In 1946, the Library was moved to a former blacksmith shop at 18 S. Main Street and still housed only a few thousand books.\n\nIncreases in population during the post-World War II period translated to increases in Library usage. From 1955 to 1960 the number of books and users doubled. As the area changed from a rural setting to a suburban community, expanded Library services became imperative.\n\nCenterville Library\n\nIn 1961, a new building, the Centerville Library, was constructed at 105 Virginia Avenue on land provided by the Board of Education for $1.00. The new facility was named for Centerville, Ohio, an early settlement on the trail between Dayton and Cincinnati. This settlement, situated on the divide between the Little Miami and Great Miami Rivers, was so named because it flourished as a hub of activity, equidistant from several early towns. Centerville's first residents replaced early crude log houses with limestone homes, built for permanence and still remaining today. The Centerville Library opened to the public in 1962, with additions opening in 1964 and 1972 to accommodate the increasing number of users.\n\nA Second Library\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Library Board began planning an additional library to serve the northern part of the community. A storefront North Branch was opened in the Washington Square Shopping Center in January of 1974. The popularity of that \"Little Library\" prompted the trustees to arrange for yet a larger library facility. Also, at this time, the first professional Library Director was hired to direct the library. Among her first duties were the planning of the new facility and the development of a collection for that library. The larger facility opened in a converted bank building at 6060 Far Hills Avenue in 1980, replacing the popular North Branch. The new building was named Woodbourne Library, after another early settlement no longer in existence.\n\nWith the new Woodbourne Library came several internal changes. The early 1980s saw an increase in departmentalization within the library and the hiring of the first specialists in Reference and Adult Services/Audio-Visual. Heavy demand for Library service in the growing community soon necessitated construction of a 7,700 square foot addition to the Woodbourne Library, opening in 1986. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the positions of Personnel Specialist and Automation Specialist were added, forming the Centerville Library Operations Team to direct daily operations, under the guidance of the Library Director.\n\nGrowth and Change\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, Library usage grew by more than 235%. Over 9,000 people visited the two Libraries each week. The Library Board of Trustees purchased property at the corner of Spring Valley Road and Virginia Avenue as a site for a larger facility to take the place of the overcrowded Centerville Library.\n\nThe next century of Library service began to take shape with a series of changes in the 1990s. In 1991, the Library system changed its name from Washington Township Public Library to Washington-Centerville Public Library. Programs and discussions on employee empowerment provided the inception of a forward-thinking business approach. A bond issue was placed on the ballot in 1993 to complete the capital fund for construction of the new Centerville Library, and was passed with the assistance of over 650 volunteers informing voters. In 1994, Washington-Centerville Public Library became fully-automated, as the new Dynix system was installed. All circulation activity was now on-line, allowing patron records and catalog information to be transferred between, and instantly updated at each Library building.\n\nA New, \"Million-Story\" Building\n\nOn February 20, 1995, the new Centerville Library opened at 111 West Spring Valley Road, replacing the old Virginia Avenue branch. This newest and largest of the Washington-Centerville Public Library facilities includes 31,600 total square feet plus a mechanical mezzanine, with 1,100 square feet of program space, a board room, and a maximum capacity of 200,000 volumes. As the headquarters location, Centerville Library also houses the technical processing center and administrative offices for Washington-Centerville Public Library. It was designed to be \"user-friendly\", spacious, accessible to the physically impaired, and wired for current and future technology needs.\n\nSkyrocketing Usage\n\nThe addition of the new Centerville Library increased Library usage even further, elevating Washington-Centerville Public Library from 26th in circulation among Ohio's 250 public libraries to 20th in a single year. In 1995, annual circulation surpassed the mark of one million items. Technological advances remained a focal point as Dial-In Access to Library catalogs was made available to patrons through their home computers. A CD-ROM software collection was also debuted for circulation to the public.\n\nThese stations provided access to full text magazine databases, as well as CD-ROM databases selected by the Library. Some stations provided full access to the Internet. Two beautiful sculptures were dedicated in 1996 and 1997 - Gary Price's \"Storytime\" at Woodbourne Library, and Michael Frasca's \"The Record\" at Centerville Library.\n\nIn 1996, more infrastructure was required by the growing organization, so the first Public Relations/Programming Specialist position was created, as well as the first Facilities Maintenance Coordinator position. Washington-Centerville Public Library has maintained its commitment to technological modernization through continued progress in the information age. The first Library website debuted in 1996, and Internet programs for the public began that same year. In 1997, the Library created Information Stations for public use.\n\nNational Recognition, Funding Changes, New Services\n\nIn 1998, Hennen's American Public Rating Index (HAPLR) ranked Washington-Centerville Public Library 2nd in the nation among libraries with a population 10,000-99,999. This reflected the hard work of the 113 employees that staffed the Library during this year. In 1998, the state and local funding formula changed. The funding formula recognized the new, larger facility and increased size and cost of operations. Prior to this change, the local operating levy accounted for 50% of the Library's income. The new formula shifted this percentage resulting in 50% from state and 41% from the local levy. The Teen Advisory Board debuted in August of 1998, giving teens the opportunity to work on programs, contests, material suggestions, and the website.\n\nIn August of 1999, Washington-Centerville Public Library was ranked 1st in the nation among libraries of similar size and larger. HAPLR ranked the Library 3rd in the nation among all 9,000 libraries. Also in 1999, the Woodbourne Library Refurbishment project was completed, giving the Library a fresh, new look.\n\nThe Library also added two new services in 1999. First, DVDs were made available for loan as more patrons began to purchase DVD players. New Library multipurpose cards were also introduced. With the new card patrons could checkout as well as pay for copies and Internet printing using the debit capabilities of the card.\n\nA Busy Y2K\n\nThe year 2000 was a big year for Washington-Centerville Public Library. The Library ranked #1 again in the population category while climbing to #2 among all libraries. The Library was the only Ohio library to place first this time and one of only three libraries to place first in 2000 and 1999. In 2000, the Library was ranked the 16th busiest library among Ohio's 250 libraries. This is a jump of ten positions in the past ten years.\n\nFormer Board President and long time Library trustee, Mrs. Yeck, established the Dorothy R. Yeck Endowment for the Arts at Woodbourne Library in 2000. The restricted endowment is intended to further the arts at Woodbourne Library. Also, Winifred Dewey, a 16 year member of the Library Board, established the John P. Dewey Business Endowment in the name of her late husband, John P. Dewey, who served ten years on the Washington-Centerville Public Library Board of Trustees. The gift endows purchase of business and travel materials and business services enhancement.\n\nA new website was designed in 2000 to offer more service to the patrons. The website became an interactive gateway to Library and information services and provided a more unified Library image. New services included online program registration and catalog access.\n\nA partnership with the University of Dayton's Erma Bombeck Writers Workshop and Library's Erma Bombeck Writing Competition proved to be very successful. The contest was merged with this UD event honoring Dayton native Erma Bombeck and included a writers' workshop and celebrity events. These events received region-wide print and television coverage for Washington-Centerville Public Library.\n\nContinued Success\n\nIn 2001, Washington-Centerville Public Library ranked 1st again in the population category. A ten-year report to the community showed efficiency and growth. The report showed that over the ten year time period Library usage quadrupled, reference questions jumped 263%, and over a quarter million new items were added, increasing circulation 83%. 2002 proved to be yet another successful year for Washington-Centerville Public Library. Again, the Library was ranked 1st among libraries of similar size and 2nd among the nation's 7,000 libraries. Also in 2002, a new ten-year operating levy passed by an outstanding 66% margin.\n\nDemand for materials in 2002 was at an all time high due largely to availability of outstanding materials and programming, increased hours, and the promotion of the Library during the levy campaign. The result was an outstanding circulation increase of 12.9% for the year, reaching almost two million items.\n\nLevy Passage Results in New Services\n\nA variety of new and expanded collections and services were implemented in 2002. Sunday hours were added at Centerville Library, increasing Sunday circulation by 200% from September through December. This new service was well received by the patrons and the community. Another new service, Express Collection, debuted, offering quantities of popular reading titles for instant checkout for 7-day loan with no holds. Technology upgrades for the year included an updated web-based catalog system. This new system replaced the text-based Web CAT. eCatalog added interactivity that boosted website traffic 85%. Express Notice also debuted in 2002, providing email notices for holds and overdues, and continuing to expand the new line of popular Express Services.\n\nNumber of Items Checked Out Tops 2 Million\n\nAnnual circulation of materials surpassed the 2 million items mark in 2003, and the HAPLR index once again ranked the Library #1 for the fourth consecutive year. Library traffic of all kinds grew by leaps and bounds, with over 670,000 visitors through the doors, and more than 300,000 visitors to the Library's website (over 1.8 million hits). Records were shattered for number of reference questions asked, information station usage, audio-visual circulation, and more, yet the Library was more efficient than ever, reducing its expenditures in response to shortfalls in funding.\n\nMore Express Services were added as well to make using the Library even easier for patrons. Express Info, a 24/7 Web-based reference service, made it possible for patrons to get their research questions answered even when the Library is not open. Also, the addition of several Express Checkout machines allowed patrons to check out their own materials and circumvent long lines that sometimes occur at the circulation desk.\n\nw\n\nLibrary Ranks 10th Busiest in the State Among Public Libraries\n\nCitizens checked out more than 2.2 million items in 2004 bringing the per capita circulation to 42 items - 3 times that of the national average! It also marked the first year that audiovisual materials such as movies, music and audiobooks surpassed print materials in circulation. Visits to the Library were up by 9% in 2004, resulting in over 700,000 visits to the physical Libraries and more than 350,000 visits to the website.\n\nPatrons Can Check Out Library Materials Without Ever Leaving Home\n\nA new Digital Collection debuted in 2005 that made it possible for patrons to check out and download eBooks and eAudiobooks right from home or work. This marked the continuation of the Library's commitment to offering more web-based and technological services that make the Library even more convenient.\n\nNew Formats, Convenient Services Delight Patrons\n\n2006 marked the debut of new formats like Playaway - portable book/media player all in one - and Express Collection Movies - new release DVDs for quick loan. In addition, more books in Spanish, Hindi, Chinese and Korean were added for adults and children. New services like Express Select - prepackaged bundles of books, movies and music on a specific topic - and Wi-Fi made using the Library even more convenient.To further support early literacy, the Library added several programs including Baby Summer Reading Club for newborns thru age 3, and Prime Time Family Reading Time - a program designed specifically for 'at-risk' families.\n\nCelebrating the Good Life\n\nCreated in 2006, the Dottie Yeck Good Life Award Writing Contest is a writing contest for teens in grades 7-9 to share ideas about how to live a life that is fun, purposeful and happy. Centerville native and National Football League New York Jets player Nick Mangold served as spokesman for this popular contest which encouraged teens to write about Dottie Yeckâs formula for a good life: Being Good + Doing Good = Having Fun + Being Happy.\n\n\"Most Beautiful Book Ever Written\" now at Centerville Library\n\nThanks to the generosity of the Fallang family, a rare fascimile copy of The Book of Kells was donated to the Library in early 2007. This replica of the 1200 year-old illuminated manuscript spurred a two-year long series of events to educate patrons about the early middle ages, the time period in which the Book was written.\n\nThe Book of Kells series delivered the most successful programs in Library history, setting new community and organizational standards for quality. Programs were diverse and interactive featuring the history of the period in year one and Illuminating the Times and the arts in year two. The Amazing Art of Kells and Scholar Series presentations by local and nationally renowned experts in the field of medieval history were a part of both years.\n\nMore than 18,000 people attended the programs and more than 12,000 visited the exhibits which counted 32 organizations as collaborators, including universities, associations, the Centerville Arts Commission, Centerville City Schools, Society for Creative Anachronism, Washington-Centerville Library Foundation, and Washington Townshipâs Town Hall.\n\nNew Library Catalog Offers Patrons More Features and Functionality\n\nIn October 2007, the Library replaced a 14-year-old catalog system with a new system called Millennium. The system offers patrons some of the most up-to-date technology available including new features like courtesy email reminder notices of upcoming due dates, an optional reading history to track previously checked out materials, and more user-friendly and robust searching features.\n\nA Pattern of Innovation and Excellence\n\nIn 2008, Washington-Centerville Public Library ranked #1 for the sixth time in its population category, making it the longest continuous #1 ranking of any library in the country â while still ranking above the stateâs average in efficiency. Of Ohioâs 251 libraries, Washington-Centerville Public Library ranks as the 12th busiest. The total cardholder base grows to more than 70,000 as new patron card registrations increase by 15 percent.\n\nKids Get Their Own Website\n\nIn 2008, a new website designed for children and featuring Bobo, the storytime monkey, made its debut. This interactive website, accessible from the main website, encourages kids to Read! (get suggestions, write a review, or listen to a story), Learn! (ask a question, learn cool stuff, or get homework help), and Do! (play games, color or create their own stories, jokes and poems). The site also features fun kid-centered polls, trivia questions, and offers homework help. To celebrate the new site, a new signature library card, featuring Bobo, was developed just for kids.\n\nLibrary at the Forefront with Video Games\n\nWashington-Centerville Public Library continued its innovative approach to service and materials with the introduction of video games for Nintendoâs Wii, PlayStation 2, 3, and Xbox 360. One of only a handful of libraries in the state to offer video games, the collection set records from the start. On the very first day, patrons checked out 64% of the video games available. Patrons enjoyed this collection for many years, until it was eventually decommissioned as gaming trends shifted online and fewer people were checking out games.\n\nMarket Driven Collections\n\nThanks to a market-driven selection philosophy, checkout of materials remained an impressive 2.2 million. Despite the introduction of new audiovisual collections, check out of books grew almost 7% over the previous year. Teen books in particular showed strong gains with an 18% increase - proving that teenagers value reading as much as technology.\n\nConvenient and Civic-Minded Services\n\nWith new international travel guidelines in place, staff at the Centerville Library became certified U.S. Passport Processing Agents as the library processed passports for more than 800 new or returning travelers throughout the area in its first year. Convenient evening and Saturday hours by appointment only added to the other civic services offered by the library including voter registration, which saw an astronomical near 400% increase in registrations in 2008.\n\nâBrary Blogs\n\nReference and Technology services continued to gain new cyber ground with the addition of text messaging reference services, the expansion of home-accessible research databases, as well as a growing lineup of Library Blogs. Library blogs offered patrons a convenient way to get new book suggestions, business information, and provided a forum for teens to share views on books and music. Library blogs were discontinued in 2017 in favor of more popular social media platforms.\n\nLibrary Collections and Services Assist During Recession\n\nIn 2009, the Library experienced double digit increases in both visits and circulation, bringing total checkouts to more than 2.5 million annually. A growing demand for free entertainment options, including the newly added Blu-Ray movie collection, was the direct result of the ongoing recession. Demands for Internet access and computer training grew as more citizens found themselves looking for new jobs as a result of lay-offs. Library funding from the state also fell victim to decreased tax revenue and as a result the Libraryâs focus shifted to streamlining operations and increasing efficiency. To absorb the increased level of business without adding more staff, the Library invested in new Express Checkout stations. Despite the shortfall in state funding, the library ranked #1 for the 7th time in the HAPLR Index.\n\n200 Years of Great Books, Great Libraries\n\nIn 2010, the Library celebrated 200 years of service to the communities of Centerville and Washington Township. The year was dedicated to celebrating Great Books and Great Libraries and included more than 80 events and activities that drew more than 8,100 participants. The celebration was even more special due to the year-long support of more than thirty businesses and organizations. The year culminated with Dinner at the Trace, the Libraryâs first ever fundraising event. Keynote speaker for the evening was Bob Danzig, former 20-year CEO of Hearst Newspaper Group. Mr. Danzig summed it up best when he dubbed libraries as beacons of hope and sources of inspiration. We agree and believe it is for those reasons, that Washington-Centerville Public Library has stood the test of time.\n\nCommunicating the Need for Local Support\n\nYears of dwindling state financial support and the expiration of the current 10-year levy prompted Washington-Centerville Public Libraryâs decision to place a 3.0 mill operating levy on the November 2011 ballot.\n\nA comprehensive campaign was designed to further inform and persuade citizens to Support Our Library, Our Future. Despite citizen concerns about high taxes, the Libraryâs 3.0 mill operating levy passed by 61%. More impressively, the levy passed in 100% of the voting precincts, proving support for the Library exists throughout our community. The approved levy will supply the Library with operating revenue from 2013-2023.\n\nFriends of Washington-Centerville Public Library Debuts\n\nIn 2011, a group of motivated citizens joined forces to begin the formation of a Friends group. In February 2012 that group was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501c3 non-profit. The Friends of WCPL successfully planned two book sales in their debut year raising nearly $20,000 and issuing several grants to the library to complete many projects.\n\neCollections & Library Hours Expand\n\nAs the 14th busiest public library in Ohio, checking out more than 2.2 million items annually, Washington-Centerville Public Library prides itself in providing access to popular materials and offering services to help connect patrons with what to read.\n\nThe easiest way to increase access to library materials is for the facility to be open. The Library responded to community survey input by implementing Sunday hours during the summer at Centerville Library beginning July 8, 2012.\n\nWhile print and audio/visual circulation returned to pre-recession levels, the Digital Collection circulation skyrocketed â up nearly 110% for 2012 and is renamed the \"eCollection\" to encompass new digital items like eMusic and eZines. As a complement to the digital content available, the Library began circulating 10 Kobo eReaders in November 2012.\n\nSupporting Early Literacy\n\nIn 2013, the Library made gains in coordinating early literacy efforts more closely with those of the Centerville City Schools. State mandates like the Common Core and 3rd grade reading guarantee provided an opportunity for the Library to make a bigger impact. As a result of collaborative efforts with school administrators, library staff fine-tuned the childrenâs summer reading club, supported the Weller Elementary School Read-A-Thon and launched a Kindergarten Storytime, which helped push annual storytime attendance towards the 11,000 mark. In addition, new programs were created to emphasize science and math; two content areas found on state-mandated tests. All these efforts help support young readers, and their educators, in meeting state standards. These efforts join existing literacy programs like Tail Waggin Tutors and Sensory Storytime.\n\nContinuing Education and Enlightenment at the Library\n\nAlso in 2013, the Library expanded its lineup of Tech Classes to include more software and social network offerings. Free courses like Linked In, Microsoft Publisher and Advanced Excel build skills to make citizens more employable. This growth in offerings would not have been possible without newly purchased laptops and devices which offer the flexibility for hands on classes to be offered at additional times throughout the day (versus only before the Library opens).\n\nIn tandem with the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, the Library also hosted a national travelling exhibit, funded by an American Library Association Grant, called Lincoln: The Constitution and the Civil War. The exhibit drew more than 35,000 visitors over its six-week stay at the Centerville Library and almost 1,8000 attended the scholar series and programs for children and teens that complemented the exhibit. The exhibit was a first of its kind for the Library.\n\nCheckouts Continue to Grow\n\nIn 2013, patrons checked out nearly 2.4 million items for an increase of 3% over 2012. Even more notable, this was the first increase in total circulation since 2009. Several factors may have contributed to this increase including the growing popularity of eCollection items, the addition of SearchOhio, policy changes that made it easier to access materials, and an increase in materials expenditures. More than $1 million was invested in adding new items to the collection, a 7.4% increase over 2012.\n\nImproving the Patron Experience\n\nMany facilities improvements were made in 2013 to make the library more inviting, easier and safer to use. New tables, chairs and alphabet tables can now be found in the childrenâs room thanks to the help of a private donation from the Yeck Family and support from the Friends of WCPL. Colorful banners adorn the Centerville Library and help patrons find key services, and a new seating area with a power cube makes it possible for more patrons to use the library as a mobile office.\n\nIn addition, the Library purchased the McDonalds property adjacent to the Cataloging Center. This property, which will be used initially as a staging site for the rear egress project, will open many new opportunities for the Woodbourne Library property. Progress was also made to develop a rear egress driveway at Woodbourne Library thanks to the Library Board of Trustees, the City of Centerville, Washington Township, the Conner Group and Mr. Wang, owner of North China restaurant.\n\nSurvey Says!\n\nIn 2014, the Library surveyed patrons to get input on customer satisfaction and to garner input on the site plan for the future expansion of the Woodbourne Library. Findings confirmed that WCPL patrons are highly satisfied and anxiously anticipating a bigger and better Woodbourne Library.\n\neCollection Usage Doubles\n\nAlso in 2014, the Library continued to evolve the collection to make items more easily accessible in multiple formats. More than 23,000 new eBooks and eAudiobooks were purchased to satisfy growing demand for digital materials. Circulation of digital materials doubled from 2013 to 2014.\n\nGreat Return on Investment\n\nBy holding the line on expenses and lobbying state legislators to increase state funding to libraries, WCPL maximized return on investment for local citizens. In fact, for every $1 spent in taxes for the Library, citizens get $3.36 in value.\n\nGrowing and Improving Facilities\n\n2015 marked the beginning of a major expansion at Woodbourne Library. On May 21, 2015, the Library dedicated Bob Corbin Drive, a newly constructed rear driveway to allow safer egress from Woodbourne Library. In addition, several public forums were held to get input that became the groundwork for a site plan that merged three properties into a unified campus.\n\nExhibits Abound\n\nThe Library hosted two exhibits in 2015. Peanutsâ¦Naturally, an exhibit featuring more than 50 didactic panels and digital reproductions of Peanuts strips, was at the Centerville Library through the spring and summer. Later that same year, Money $marts, a grant-funded financial literacy exhibit, helped children and teens ages 3-18 learn how to responsibly earn, save and spent money. A complementary set of programs ran concurrently with both exhibits.\n\nFriends of Washington-Centerville Public Library Win 2016 OLC Award\n\nThe Friends of Washington-Centerville Public Library have won the 2016 Ohio Friends of the Library Recognition Award. This prestigious award recognizes innovative Friends groups across the state that support library programs, increase community awareness, and promote the mission and core values of the library. Read the OLC annoucement and news release for more details.\n\nLibrary Implements RFID Technology, New Self-Checkout Machines\n\nThe 2018 expansion and renovation of the Woodbourne Library prompted some related technological improvements at Washington-Centerville Public Library. The Library recently converted the entire Library collection from a barcode system to a RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system, as well as installed new RFID compatible self-checkout machines and security gates. RFID offers the most up-to-date technology and several other benefits including: faster checkout/checkin, fewer misplaced items, and more ergonomically friendly with ability to scan multiple items at once.\n\nWoodbourne Library Expansion & Renovation Project\n\nWith feedback solicited in a series of community forums, Woodbourne Library was expanded by 9,000 sq. ft. and completely renovated. The Library was closed from January 2017 through September 2018 to complete the work. Woodbourne Library reopened on September 23, 2018 with a public grand opening. A few days prior to the grand opening a private sneak peek event was held to raise funds for an interactive childrenâs wall.\n\nThe Woodbourne Library was designed to meet the needs of Library users now and in the future, while retaining the Mid-century Modern elements that make it an architectural treasure.\n\nThe renovation and expansion:\n\nRedesigned the Library to fit changing patron needs, including adding a Creativity Space, Quiet reading room, Childrenâs Garden, and a Teen Room.\n\nResponded to community requests for meeting space, including a Community Room and five meeting rooms/quiet rooms, all available for free use by the public with a valid Washington-Centerville Library card.\n\nRevived the interior with four original works of art from local artists, and a colorful palette of new paint, carpet and furnishings that complement the Mid-century design of the building.\n\nResolved barriers to using the Library with expanded parking, a drive-up book return and additional restrooms\n\nRestored the iconic sunscreen to its original beauty.\n\nRetained favorite library features like ample shelving for the collection, an inviting Childrenâs Room with storytime area, computer workstations and browsing shelves.\n\nCOVID-19 Response\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the library swiftly adapted its services. During the governor-mandated closure from March to May, staff implemented virtual storytimes, online programs, live chat support, and remote library card registration. We also utilized the 3-D printer to produce face mask extenders for healthcare workers. Curbside service began at Woodbourne Library in May, with in-person services resuming in June. The Board of Trustees used this period to renovate the Centerville Library parking lot. Despite this delay, both libraries were operational by August 2020. Services were gradually reintroduced as conditions allowed, with safety protocols in place to continue serving the community throughout this challenging period.\n\nVoters Approve Renewal Levy for Library\n\nIn November 2021, residents of Centerville/Washington Township overwhelmingly approved a 3.0 mills renewal continuous levy for Washington-Centerville Public Library. The revenue generated from the levy, at no additional cost to local taxpayers, will support current operating expenses, including robust collections, engaging programs, responsive services and outstanding facilities.\n\nLibrary Eliminates Overdue Fines for Patrons\n\nIn May 2022, overdue fines on most library materials were eliminated at Washington-Centerville Public Library (WCPL), in an effort to eliminate barriers to access to information the library provides. Overdue fines for Express books and movies, maker kits, hotspots, and items borrowed through SearchOhio or OhioLink will remain. Fees for previously billed items will also remain. Items not returned within 21 days of the due date will be billed.\n\nâRecent studies have shown that eliminating overdue fines actually increases the rate of return on borrowed library materials,â said WCPL Director Liz Fultz. âWe want to be a welcoming establishment for the community and this is one more way to do that.â Contrary to popular belief, money collected from overdue fines is actually a small portion of overall revenue for WCPL. In 2021, less than 0.4% of total revenues was collected in overdue fines.\n\nCreativity Commons Opens at RecPlex\n\nIn June 2022, Creativity Commons, a makerspace for innovation, learning and creativity opened. This community partnership between Washington-Centerville Public Library and Washington Township RecPlex makes cutting edge equipment and technology accessible to the community.\n\nVega Discover\n\nIn May 2023, the Library replaced the 10 year old Encore catalog with a new catalog, Vega Discover. Vega Discover features improved website accessibility, more frequent feature updates and material formats rolled in to one entry.\n\nLibrary Van\n\nThe Library's expansion into lending non-traditional items through its Library of Things created a need for secure inter-building transport. To address this, the Library acquired its first vehicle, a large Sprinter van, in Spring 2023. This purchase not only resolved the transportation issue but also enhanced efficiency in materials handling. Additionally, the van's size allowed for a more prominent presence at community events, including the Americana parade.\n\nWashington-Centerville Public Library Adds Administrative Building\n\nThe Library acquired a 4,340 square foot building at 561 Congress Park, Washington Township, for $435,000 in September 2023. This facility, not open to the public, serves as office and garage space for administrative and support services. Director Liz Fultz noted, \"This Congress Park location will allow us to reconfigure Centerville Library, expanding services and space for patrons.\" The purchase was funded by the $500,000 sale of a vacant lot on Mandel Drive, owned by the library since 1974 and sold in 2021. Staff relocated to the new space in May 2024."
