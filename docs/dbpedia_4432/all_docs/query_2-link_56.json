        "text": "The highest honor for any high school speech and debate coach is election to the National Speech & Debate Association Hall of Fame. Each year, nominations are sought from member coaches. In the month of April, current Hall of Fame members and coaches with at least three diamonds vote to determine which nominees will be elected members of this most distinguished body.\n\n2024 Inductees\n\nCarol Biel, Brian Eanes, Adam Jacobi, Renee Motter, Steven Schappaugh, Demond Wilson, David Yastremski\n\nNote: NSDA member coaches must be logged in to access the nomination form.\n\nIt was a great honor to be asked to write brief biographies of the truly remarkable people who have been elected by their peers to enter the NSDA Hall of Fame… What I hope is that each member will read all the bios and meet colleagues they never knew, or wanted to know better, and learn the history of their profession by reading the exploits of colleagues in times past. — James Copeland\n\nAbout the Hall of Fame\n\nIntroductory Essay\n\nBy James Copeland (2017) It may appear curious that a national organization founded in 1925 waited more than 50 years before establishing a Hall of Fame to reward members who had rendered exceptional service and/or who had achieved exceptional success. Yet not until the October 1977 Executive Council meeting was a motion passed unanimously to establish a National Forensic League Hall of Fame. The guidelines for such an organization were brief, yet complete:\n\nI. Mr. Bruno Jacob, Secretary-Emeritus, shall name the first ten members of the Hall.\n\nA. The initial ten inductees shall be, in the opinion of Mr. Jacob, the all-time greatest NFL coaches (currently coaching or retired, living or deceased) based upon:\n\n1. Service to the NFL 2. Chapter awards (largest chapter, leading chapter) 3. Record at the National Tournament 4. Record at district and State tournaments\n\nII. Additional coaches may be elected by:\n\nA. An “old timers” committee composed of Mr. Jacob, Mr. Odom, and Mr. Winfield may recommend retired or deceased coaches to the members of the Hall. A 2/3 vote of the living members is required to elect these members.\n\nB. District Chairmen or members of the District Committee may suggest retired or inactive coaches they consider worthy of election to the Hall. These names shall be submitted to all coaches holding three diamonds or more. The two nominees each year receiving the greatest number of votes by preferential ballot shall be inducted.\n\nIII. Additional persons, not coaches, may be elected by:\n\nA. A unanimous vote of the Executive Council (these persons shall have rendered great, unstinting and continuous service to NFL).\n\nMr. Jacob wrote the reasons for his founding member selections in the September 1978 issue of Rostrum: “In selecting the coaches to be nominated to the Hall of Fame, I set up two criteria:\n\nFirst, that coach shall have demonstrated over a number of years a consistent ability as a superior speech teacher and speech coach as demonstrated by several tangible achievements: the number of students qualified to reach the finals in the national speech tournament; the winning of championships in that tournament; the winning of the Tau Kappa Alpha [now Pi Kappa Delta/Bruno E. Jacob] Trophy (or the tournament sweepstakes [now the School of Excellence] award); attainment by the coach of the NFL Diamond Key Award.\n\nSecond, devotion to the NFL [now the NSDA] as indicated by service as District Chairman, National Director, National Officer, or as host to the National Speech Tournament.”\n\nMr. Jacob then named ten founding members to the new Hall of Fame. By unanimous vote, the Executive Council had earlier named Mr. Jacob to the Hall of Fame. Rostrum editor Albert Odom, himself later elected to the Hall, wrote in the September 1978 Rostrum: “Bruno E. Jacob was presented the NFL Hall of Fame membership number one. It wasn’t a surprise to anyone except Mr. Jacob that he would be the number one selection.” The award was presented on behalf of the 450,000 members of the NFL. Karl E. Mundt, Former United States Senator and longtime National Forensic League President, was posthumously awarded membership number two. The 12 initial members were officially inducted at the National Tournament banquet held during the 1978 National Tournament hosted by Northwestern University. An elegant ceremony was performed at McCormick Place, the Chicago convention hall on the Lake Michigan shore. Each living member spoke, but the premiere speech was delivered by Mr. Jacob. Frail and ill, Mr. Jacob poured out his heart about the meaning of the National Forensic League and the wonderful people who rendered great service to the organization and to the youth involved in speech activities. Unfortunately, no audio or video copy of that speech can be found, but perhaps Mr. Jacob’s retirement speech, delivered at the 1969 Washington, D.C., National Tournament banquet, can provide a glimpse of Mr. Jacob’s emotions and the power of his oratorical skills. “…What can a man say at a moment like this. There are moments in life when a heart is so full of emotion… The book of my life is nearly finished. We are writing the pages of the last chapter now. I am haunted by the words of the dying Cecil Rhodes…, ‘So much to do, so little done.’ As I look back I am distressed by the opportunities neglected, the blank pages in my book. But the moving finger writes; and, having writ, moves on. Nor all my piety or wit will lure it back to change half a line, nor all my tears wash out one word of it.” The Hall was expanded at the Spring 1987 Executive Council meeting: “Moved by Mitchell, seconded by Fernandes, that this year the Hall of Fame admit three retired and three active coaches. Passed. Unanimous.” At the Fall 1987 Council meeting, a special committee was established to discuss Hall of Fame membership qualifications. The committee was comprised of Jean Boles, Charline Burton, Ralph Carey, Carmendale Fernandes, Richard Sodikow, L. D. Naegelin, H. B. Mitchell, and James Copeland, acting NFL Secretary. That committee recommended that four nominees should be elected each year: two by the three-diamond or higher coaches, and two by the living Hall members. Twenty-five years of service or retirement was required for nomination. An “old timer’s” committee and Honorary nominees could also be elected. Originally, the names of nominees elected were kept secret, like the Motion Picture Oscars, and announced at the national banquet. After a few newly elected members failed to attend the banquet or failed to qualify students to the National Tournament and did not attend, it was decided that, like the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the new inductees would be announced in advance. In 1987, a separate Hall of Fame banquet was established, hosted by Billy Tate, to induct the new honorees prior to their public presentation at the Donus D. Roberts Diamond Assembly. Two Hall of Fame members, Jean Boles and Ruby Krider, deserve special commendation. Jean Boles served as Hall of Fame secretary from her induction in 1983 until her death. Ms. Boles, a former student of the legendary debate coach H. B. Mitchell and later an outstanding Texas coach herself, corresponded with Hall members, spearheaded the establishment of Hall of Fame scholarships for the winners of the National Tournament supplemental events, and was instrumental in obtaining a federal not-for-profit designation for the Hall of Fame. Mrs. Krider, inducted in 1979 and one of the finest teachers of oral interpretation in the NFL, originated the idea for a Hall of Fame pin. She and her husband Clem designed an octagonal, gold pin with the NFL key as the escutcheon, bearing the image of the eye which sees all sides of a topic, the lamp of knowledge, and the initials NFL diagonal across the key. The words “Hall of Fame” border the edges of the pin, which is still in use and highly treasured to this day. It took more than 50 years for the National Forensic League (now the National Speech & Debate Association) to establish a Hall of Fame. After almost four decades, what is the state of this elite, yet important, organization now? Some Halls of Fame are so large that the honor seems meaningless. Once during a performance of the Grand Ole Opry, the aging Roy Acuff, once the Opry’s greatest star, and an early member of the Country Music Hall of Fame introduced a singer by saying, “Please welcome a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame… I think he is a member… They’re gettin’ so many in there it’s hard to keep track…” Bruno Jacob’s decision to limit Hall induction to only those coaches who have achieved consistent superiority in teaching and coaching and have performed exemplary service to the organization is a standard which has stood the test of time. Although one may argue that deserving coaches not yet tapped deserve election, no one can persuasively argue that any previous inductee did not earn that special honor. Only one individual elected to the NFL Hall of Fame refused induction! The great Minnesota teacher R. J. Happe coached many champion debate teams and two future Minnesota governors. Happe was also the first four-diamond coach in NFL history! Yet he refused induction because he was angry that Mr. Jacob did not choose him as one of the original members. Some Halls of Fame are governed by politics: membership is determined by friendships and marred by campaigning. The famous Oklahoma coach Charline Burton insisted during a 1987 meeting of the Special Hall of Fame committee that Hall recognition “not be political!” Her words were true then and true now. Voting to enshrine a coach should never be based upon friendship, never be decided upon state or regional pride, and certainly never be influenced by competitive animosity. Campaigning by a coach or their supporters is out of character. This ultimate honor should seek the person! So how stands our Hall? Strong and vibrant! Ninety-two years after the founding of the NFL, the careers of more than 200 members in the National Speech & Debate Association Hall of Fame will continue to serve as a beacon to those who spend their careers “Training Youth for Leadership.” John West, an honorary NFL member and great supporter, knew of an Association of Halls of Fame. Members include Halls with huge museum displays and auditoriums, which are visited by millions of people yearly, as well as smaller Halls, only marked by a small plaque or a book of names. But all of these Halls have one thing in common: members who have achieved uncommon and sustained excellence. The National Speech & Debate Association Hall of Fame is neither the grandest nor the smallest Hall, but it is one of the strongest and most elite: honoring almost a century of fine teaching and coaching of speech activities for almost four decades. Its members invite you to achieve membership: Bruno Jacob and more than 200 honorees have marked your path.\n\nAuthor's Note\n\nIt was a great honor to be asked to write brief biographies of the truly remarkable people who have been elected by their peers to enter the NSDA Hall of Fame. I assume I was selected as author because I personally knew all but seven of the honorees. I bridged two generations: I met founder Bruno Jacob as a student contestant in 1957. I am writing these words 60 years later, after missing my first National Tournament since 1964. Since the bios are about members of the NSDA Hall of Fame, NSDA honors and service are highlighted, but NCFL, Barkley Forum, state league, and national circuit successes are also mentioned. I ask the understanding of the readers on two points. The brevity of the bios was decided by the NSDA. I know much more could have been written about each member. And the difficulty of accessing decades old state and invitational tournament results often meant that members’ honors are incomplete. Fortunately, many living members of the Hall were most cooperative in helping me create a complete picture of their careers, by filling out a questionnaire and by personal correspondence. I believe a biography should be interesting to read. A bio contains records, but must be more. Most important is that it have a theme to describe each individual career and individual anecdotes to illuminate each individual personality. My template was the brief bios occasionally found in The New Yorker magazine. Each living person mentioned herein will, of course, read their own bio. What I hope is that each member will read all the bios and meet colleagues they never knew, or wanted to know better, and learn the history of their profession by reading the exploits of colleagues in times past. I wish to thank the people who made this project possible: Pam Cady Wycoff (MN), who proposed the original idea; Annie Reisener (NSDA office), who oversaw the project; Vicki Pape (NSDA office), who edited the bios and layout; David Johnson (TX) and Ron Krikac (WY), whose knowledge of NFL history was essential; and all the Hall of Fame members, past and present, who lived these fascinating lives. I hope to live to finish all the bios. If not, those that I wrote are signed with my name. Respectfully, James Copeland\n\nHall of Fame Selection Process\n\nAnnually, the current living Hall of Fame members and NSDA coaches with three or more Diamond Awards will select four inductees annually.\n\nAll living Hall of Fame members shall be allowed to cast a vote for up to four individuals for induction into that year’s NSDA Hall of Fame. All living three-diamond coaches, including qualified Hall of Fame members, will also be allowed to cast a vote for up to four individuals for induction into that year’s NSDA Hall of Fame. The first two inductees shall be the two individuals receiving the most total votes from the Hall of Fame member vote only. The third and fourth inductees shall be the two individuals receiving the most total votes from the combined votes of Hall of Fame members and three-diamond coaches. The vote of Hall of Fame members with three or more diamonds is double in weight. If either of the top two vote getters are the first or second choice of the Hall of Fame only vote, the induction goes to the next place winner(s) of the combined vote. If there is a tie for the fourth inductee using the combined vote, the preference of the Hall of Fame only vote will break it.\n\nA fifth inductee is chosen annually to the Hall of Fame, called a “Legends” selection. This individual can either be an older or deceased coach or a non-coach who was worthy of consideration. The individual is not required to have ever been on a regular Hall of Fame ballot, but could have been and would still be eligible. A Legends nominee is not someone who appears on the current Hall of Fame ballot. It is recommended (but not required) that the selection committee seek out individuals who have either appeared on the ballot several times with no selection and have since fallen from annual consideration due to failed attempts at selection or who have never been considered on a ballot due to the unique situation of their relationship with the organization (longtime staff, collegiate coach, longtime supporter, etc.).\n\nThe primary standards which are to be considered are the following:\n\n-Service to the National Speech & Debate Association\n\n-Chapter Awards and Recognition\n\n-Record of Student Success in NSDA Competition and State Tournaments\n\n“Legends” Selection Process:\n\nThe selection of the Legends inductee will use the following process:\n\nEach year, the current Board President selects a committee of current Hall Fame members who will serve on the Hall of Fame Legend Selection Committee. One of the individuals selected will be chosen as the chair and in the future will be one of two repeat members from the prior year, having served as a member of the committee. The committee will consist of both newly selected and longtime Hall of Fame members, as well as individuals who represent diversity of geography, school size, ethnicity, etc. Individuals can be selected to the committee multiple times, but not consecutively (beyond the two mentioned above) and never more than twice in a five-year period.\n\nPrior to April 15, the committee will accept nominations from the current Hall of Fame members and the Executive Director, as well as do their own research into potential nominees as the Legends selection for that year. This research will be provided as documentation to the committee to determine the credibility of the nominees. Documentation may include NSDA district and national level competition, service, and leadership accomplishments as well as testimony of contemporaries of the time. Noteworthy awards and forensic accomplishments may be included. After year one, the current committee can also consider people that were considered by the previous committee.\n\nIn April, the Legends committee will deliberate and select one individual as that year’s Legends pick for the Hall of Fame to be announced with the other four elected inductees.\n\nHave a question or concern?

After graduating from Yale University, Jonathan has coached eight NJ state LD champions, was the coach of the 2018 NDCA Dukes/Bailey winner, and has had debaters make it to late elimination rounds and top speaker positions at Stanford, Emory, Greenhill, Wake Forest, Harvard, the Tournament of Champions, and the NSDA Nationals, including the second speaker in LD in 2015. He has also coached two members of the USA Debate team. Jonathan has generously given of his time and talents to the speech and debate community and the NSDA. He served on the Lincoln-Douglas Wording Committee for many years. He has also served as the co-chair of Lincoln-Douglas Debate at the NSDA National Tournament for the past four years. Because of Jonathan’s commitment to leadership and service to the speech and debate communities, he was named 2014 National Debate Coach Association Educator of the Year, 2016 Glenn Pelham Award winner, and a member of the prestigious Barkley Forum Key Society.\n\nMartha Benham\n\nInducted 2023 Colorado\n\nMartha Benham has been an integral part of the speech and debate community for more than 20 years. She has coached numerous state qualifiers, state finalists, state champions, national qualifiers, and national finalists. Although the success experienced by her students is impressive, her dedication to promoting speech and debate is even more so. For years, Martha has been instrumental in the planning and logistics of the state speech conference. Each year, she collaborates with others to teach new coaches the basics and make them feel welcome. At the national level, Martha has served on the LD Wording Committee and is the chair of her NSDA district. She has presented at the NSDA national education conference and was site host for the conference in 2017. She is constantly looking for ways to bridge local programs and local students with national resources to support their involvement in this life-changing activity. Martha’s dedication to her students as well as the state and national speech communities has resulted in her induction into the Colorado High School Activities Hall of Fame, receiving the Ralph E. Carey Award for Distinguished Career Service and other prestigious awards.\n\nWilliam Bennett\n\nInducted 2023 New Mexico\n\nWilliam Bennett’s record at the National Tournament is among the strongest in history. Bill qualified more than 40 students—nine reached the final round; five won the championship. His Lincoln-Douglas debaters closed out the final round at the 1986 Nationals—the first time in NFL/NSDA history debaters from the same school reached the final stage. He coached seven Extemp speakers to the national finals; three won the championship. What is truly amazing is that his record was accomplished in small schools, on small budgets, and with no national circuit participation. Bill coached in Wyoming, Nebraska, Illinois, and New Mexico. Bill was a staunch supporter of the NFL, supporting chapters in four different high schools. His state records include over 60 champions. He was very proud that his daughter qualified to Nationals in three different years. Her point record is still the highest total in her chapter after 17 years. Bill was an educator who shared his skills with the entire forensic community. He published quality textbooks and handbooks starting in 1973, writing with clarity about the theory and practice of contest events as well as how to coach students to excel in these events. Bill and his wife Catherine conducted speech and debate summer camps since the 1980s.\n\nMatt Heimes\n\nInducted 2023 Nebraska\n\nMatt Heimes is an exemplary teacher and four-diamond coach who has spent more than 30 years coaching forensics. Early in his career, Matt started two NSDA chapters in rural Nebraska before moving to Lincoln Southwest to open the school and start their chapter in 2002. Since then, Matt has built the program to one of the top 100 programs in the country. Competitively, Matt has qualified 365 students to Nationals and coached over 20 national finalists, including the 2022 NSDA national champion in Expository. On the state level, Matt’s teams in South Platte, Wauneta-Palisade, and Lincoln Southwest have captured district and state team championships. In addition to competitive success, Matt leads by example through service to the local, state, and national forensic community. He has served on the Nebraska Speech Communication and Theatre Association board for 25 years, advocating to update practices to reflect the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Matt was a founding member of the NIETOC and has served as its president since 2018. Perhaps his most endearing quality is his integrity. Matt coaches his students tirelessly, not only developing their communication skills but teaching them to be well-rounded, responsible citizens beyond high school.\n\nSarah Rosenberg\n\nInducted 2023 New York\n\nWith a career spanning more than five decades, Sarah Rosenberg has helped bring the joy of public speaking and competitive acting into the lives of thousands of students across the country. From her humble beginnings as an English and Speech/Drama teacher at Maclay Junior High School in the San Fernando Valley, to producing critically acclaimed off-Broadway re-imaginings of Shakespearean classics like A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Tempest, her career has transcended the mere ordinary. From coaching state and national champions, to countless finalists at the state and national levels, to her most recent recognition by the NIETOC with the Josephine Dukes Award in recognition of her contributions to teaching and the fine arts, her passion for helping youth discover their voices is unparalleled. She is willing to work with every student, no matter the challenge, to help them to discover their own talent. Her example has motivated many of her students to go on to become actors, teachers, and playwrights themselves. Her commitment to bringing out all of the finest attributes of America’s youth— leadership, equity, integrity, humility, and a dedication to service above self—is exactly how she has thrived for so long and still serves as an exemplar for us all.\n\nRaphael Scott Waldrop\n\nInducted 2023 Mississippi\n\nRaphael Scott Waldrop is the head coach of Mississippi’s Hattiesburg High School nationally recognized speech and debate team.

She unlocks the potential in young people to be forceful and passionate advocates for what is important and what is right—skills that persist long past their time as her students. Sheryl’s work with students fundamentally changes their lives for the better.\n\nMichael Patterson\n\nInducted 2022 Oklahoma\n\nIn his 42 years at Guymon High School in Oklahoma, Michael has won numerous accolades and sent hundreds of students to Nationals—many into deep out rounds. However, his service to the speech and debate community is the reason he embodies all the characteristics of one who belongs in the NSDA Hall of Fame. Guymon is rural and only graduates about 100 students per year. However, during his career, Michael has grown his program larger than football or band. As a six-diamond coach with five service plaques, Michael’s coaching successes are tremendous. He has won 15 Oklahoma team championships and coached more than 100 individual event state champions. He has been named West Oklahoma District Coach of the Year, Oklahoma Speech and Debate Coach of the Year by the NFHS, H. B. Mitchell Speech and Debate Coach of the Year by the Oklahoma Speech, Theater, and Communication Association, Guymon Public Schools’ District Teacher of the Year, and was one of four finalists for Oklahoma State Teacher of the Year in 2019.

From 1978-1984, 1994-1998, and 2004-2005, he was at Iona Prep in New Rochelle, NY where he added speech and Congress to the debate program, was head coach, and in later years was assistant coach to a former student. He coached a national champion in Congress and assisted in coaching an NCFL Declamation champion and the overall state championships in speech and Congress in 1998, the same year that Iona Prep was an NCFL speech co-national champion. In 1998, he became principal at Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame in Miami, FL, restoring the speech program.\n\nFrom 1984-1994 and from 2005 to the present, he has been a head or assistant coach at Catholic Memorial, Boston.

Dr. Edwards participated in four years of debate at the University of Iowa and earned his Ph.D. in Communication Studies in 1976. In high school circles, Dr. Edwards is most well-known for his creation of the TRPC and TRIEPC tournament tabulation software which revolutionized and modernized the facilitation of speech and debate competitions throughout the United States and internationally. In addition, Dr. Edwards has been one of the most prominent authors of publications in the field of speech, debate, and communication in the past four decades. As the author of the topic introduction issue of Forensic Quarterly since 1972 and an active member of the national Policy Debate topic wording process, Dr. Edwards has literally shaped the educational landscape of debate in and out of the classroom throughout his entire career.\n\nAs a volunteer in the high school community, Rich has devoted hundreds of thousands of hours to running and facilitating local, state, and national level tournaments. When many would believe that his role in the activity could not get any more impactful, it was Dr. Edwards who created the first comprehensive system for tabulating the National Speech & Debate Tournament. His insight and revolutionary thinking allowed for levels of efficiency and accuracy that has led to thousands of students gaining access to the event.\n\n“Whether you are Tommie Lindsey Jr or Liz Cheney, the power of speech is necessarily tethered to the art of public service…Sure, trophies and championships are fine, but if we can teach kids to revere each other as people, I believe we will have done the world a greater good.”\n\n– Alphonse Michael Marks\n\nAlphonse Michael Marks\n\nInducted 2021 (MS)\n\nAs one of the few African American speech and debate coaches in the country at that time, Michael Marks had already qualified students to the NFL tournament while directing his first program at Lumberton High School in Lumberton, Mississippi, at the age of 19.

Scott Wunn started his coaching career in small town Iowa with goals focused on helping students and spreading the activity of speech and debate. He developed two separate school programs, which each became the largest and most successful in the state. State and national championships followed in due course. In 2002, his student won the NSDA Humorous championship, and in 2003, his students placed third in Humorous Interpretation and second in Duo Interpretation.\n\nThen, in 2003, Scott was selected by the Board of Directors to direct our organization, providing opportunities for students and coaches nationwide. His role changed, but his desire to expand opportunities and promote our activity remained the same. His leadership has helped meet the needs of our membership from the growth and funding of Public Forum to the creation of Informative, POI, and Big Questions. During his tenure, he has fostered recognition of our activity by moving to a more accurate brand and name and strengthened it by creating NSDE Day. Scott organized seven leadership and education conferences to encourage membership engagement and has made sure diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts have been expanded to include coaches’ caucuses, a formal equity statement, and equity officers.

After coaching a Girls’ Extemporaneous Speaking national champion at Purcell High School (OK), she established the speech and debate program at Bellaire High School in Houston (TX). Her championship program would later be continued by Bill Henderson, Cecil Pickett, and David Johnson, all of whom would be later elected to the NSDA (then NFL) Hall of Fame.\n\nMollie Martin’s coaching record at the National Tournament (1950-1961) was truly remarkable: coach of the National Sweepstakes champions (and Coach of the Year) in 1958 and 1959; coach of the Girls’ Extemporaneous Speaking champions in 1952 and 1961; and coach of a Boys’ Extemporaneous Speaking champion in 1960.\n\nMs. Martin coached when entries to Nationals were scarce. Only five events were held: Debate, Boys’/Girls’ Extemporaneous Speaking, Oratory, Dramatic Interpretation, and Congress. Qualification was difficult. Only first place at the district tournament qualified, and only first place at the Texas UIL state tournament qualified. Ms. Martin coached in Oklahoma and Texas, where there were many NFL member schools and fierce competition.\n\nMollie’s service to our activity was admirable. She founded, and each year directed, the largest tournament in the nation: the Bellaire Forensic Tournament. It was larger than Nationals and the most prestigious high school invitational tournament. The first young woman to win the male-dominated debate division at the Bellaire tournament during Mollie Martin’s years was Elizabeth Herring, now Senator Elizabeth Warren, coached by Hall of Fame coach Charline Burton from Oklahoma!\n\nMollie accomplished more in a few years than most coaches accomplish in a career. Truly a pioneer, Ms. Martin was arguably one of the most successful coaches of her time!\n\n— Compiled by David Johnson and James Copeland\n\nJim Cavallo\n\nInducted 2020 Indiana\n\nRenowned coach and legend Jim Copeland said that NFL/NSDA founder Bruno E. Jacob believed the Hall of Fame should be based on three factors: district success, state success, and National Tournament qualifying success. Jim Cavallo is a four-diamond coach who achieved all three. Jim coached both speech and debate from 1971 until he retired in 2009. He spent three of those years coaching at Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond, Indiana. From 1997 to 2009, he was Chesterton’s Program Director. He actively coached speech events, but his focus was in Congress and, primarily, Policy Debate.\n\nJim had a legendary career as a teacher and was considered a steady influence with students and helped them develop leadership skills as well as political awareness and a willingness to use time and social skills to serve. Jim served on the Indiana High School League Board of Directors for 10 years, was a member of the Indiana High School Forensic League Hall of Fame, and even helped design the IHSFL State Debate Tournament format. He coached 13 Policy Debate state champions, 4 Congress state champions, 15 Congressional Debate and 34 Policy Debate national qualifiers with many of these teams and individuals advancing to outrounds and national recognition.\n\nOn a larger scale, Jim was a Chesterton High School coach of record when Chesterton won five consecutive team national championships in the late 1980s and 90s. He also was noted when Chesterton won an NFL/NSDA National School of Excellence Award—and, in 2009 Jim received the Odom Commendation when Chesterton won its third Bruno E. Jacob award.\n\nAdditionally, in the early 1970s, Jim was one of the first Policy Debate coaches to break from the “boys club” mentality and encourage, promote, and recruit young women to do Policy Debate. To Jim, every student had talent, potential, and the ability to contribute to constructive argumentation.\n\n— Compiled from nomination bio\n\nCheryl Potts\n\nInducted 2020 Texas\n\nJohn F.

In Missouri, that coach is Georgia Brady. Great coaches coach students who often become great coaches themselves. So it was with Georgia, who was coached by Hall of Fame member Margaret Meredith. “She started teaching me what it meant to be a leader and opened the door to a career I loved,” recalls Georgia. “Four years with her opened so many doors of opportunity, scholarships, travel.” Coach Brady’s philosophy always emphasized empathy. “I always tried to keep foremost in my thoughts that these young people were fragile, impressionable human beings,” she says. “Guiding, stimulating, and helping students to produce and express new thoughts, as well as evaluating…the many claims in our ‘marketplace of ideas’ was a primary goal.” Georgia Brady has coached at four Missouri schools: Hickman Mills; North Kansas City; Blue Springs; and Blue Springs South. Her students have won Missouri state championships in debate and speech. Her chapters have earned multiple Leading Chapter Awards, multiple District Tournament Plaques and Trophies, and multiple Academic All American student designations. She has qualified large squads of students to Nationals, including her daughter twice and two finalists in Extemp Commentary. Ms. Brady has been widely honored: five times as Suburban Conference Coach of the Year; as the Speech and Theater Association of Missouri Outstanding Teacher; and as Missouri Mock Trial Coach of the Year. She has earned eight NSDA Diamond Awards and the NSDA Distinguished Service Key.

Cynthia Burgett, in her Hall of Fame induction year, became only the second coach in history to coach a team to close out the Policy Debate final round. Her debate success was not unexpected. She had earlier coached eight state champion teams in Kansas and qualified Policy teams to Nationals for 23 consecutive years. Eight teams won trophies by reaching the top 14. In 1997, her Washburn Rural team was the last undefeated team and finished third. In 2016, she coached the top speaker in Policy Debate. In her retirement year, the pinnacle was in sight. In round 12, there were only three undefeated teams, all from Kansas. Two were Cindy’s; both survived to claim the final round as theirs alone. Cynthia Burgett was inducted into the Kansas Speech Communication Association Hall of Fame in 2014 and received the Kansas Debate Coaches Hall of Fame Service award in 2019. Coach Burgett believes that her “disappointing moments have all been overshadowed by the many good things that have been in my career as a coach.” Her motto, shared with every novice class is, “It is better to be a good person than a good debater, but it’s nice if you can do both.” Cindy philosophy of coaching: “Offer young people an opportunity to learn and develop lifelong skills in speaking and in reasoning. I want them to celebrate their talent and intellect as a squad.” “I would be skeptical that anyone does this alone, should they claim to do so,” says Cindy. “I could not without the support of mother, my administration, my fellow coaches…and students who loved this squad and this activity, and worked hard to make themselves and me look good.” Will coaching a team to close out Policy finals mean that Cynthia Burgett will finally join the list of NSDA’s debate greatest coaches? No. She has always been on that list! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nDr. Mike Edmonds\n\nInducted 2019\n\nColorado\n\nFrom a young age, Mike Edmonds has been highly involved in competitive forensics.

For 28 years this hard working teacher has achieved excellence in four great forums: Kentucky state tournaments; Barkley Forum Invitational tournaments; NSDA National Tournaments; and NCFL Grand Tournaments. In three different years, Meadows’ squads won first place in every league: KHSSL, NSDA, NCFL, and KESDA. “Do or do not; there is no try,” says Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, which is the motto of the Danville team. “I have insisted students jump in or jump out—really give the activity a go or not… That’s applied to my coaches and me too,” says Meadows. “We give it our best version of ourselves.” Best, indeed! In 23 trips to KHSSL state, the Danville team has eight firsts and nine seconds. In the Kentucky NSDA district tournament, Danville has won multiple yearly Sweepstakes Plaques and six District Trophies. At Nationals, Steve has qualified competitors every year, including five finalists and a runner-up in International Extemp.

In earlier years, the awards assemblies were emceed by the elegant Carmendale Fernandes, the articulate Albert Odom, the presidential team of Frank Sferra and Donus Roberts, and southern gentleman Billy Tate. But no former emcee’s accolades have had the “Big Voice” impact as the one from Timothy Sheaff! But Tim is more than a voice. He is a fine coach. Mr. Sheaff believes, “Fundamentally, everything is an argument. Whether it be explicit, like in debate or the public speaking events, or implicit, like the Interp events. Everything you say matters and trying to speak without an argument is pointless.” John F. Kennedy said, “We do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Tim agrees. “This is both a call to action for self to ‘jump into the deep end’ and experience failure, but also to the community, that we must address hard issues and make speech valuable.” Tim has coached 25 years at Dowling Catholic High School (IA). State league wins include back-to-back state speech team champions in 2001 and 2002; coaching both the Policy team champion and the sweepstakes winning team in 2013; and coaching the IHSSA debate sweepstakes winners in 2015. At NSDA Districts, Sheaff’s squad has won the Sweepstakes Plaque six years and the District Trophy three times. Dowling’s chapter led the district several years as largest chapter, earning three Leading Chapter Awards. At Nationals, Dowling always qualified large squads, including 17 in 2013! Sheaff’s debaters placed third in 2002 and won a School of Excellence Award. Two speakers reached finals including a Humorous Interp champion and back-to-back finalist years for extemper Brian Garfield. Coach Sheaff served his profession as district chair, winning Bronze, Silver, and Gold Awards. Tim earned five diamonds, and currently serves as a member of the NSDA Board of Directors. The NSDA is a Sheaff family affair: all six of Tim’s children have been members and five have qualified for Nationals thus far. That remarkable feat deserves a Tim Sheaff style accolade for each successful child! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\n2018 Inductees\n\nAnita Boyd\n\nInducted 2018 Mississippi “Present at the beginning” was Anita Boyd. After years of being part of the Deep South district with Alabama, a Mississippi district was established. Anita, Betty Whitlock, Michael Marks, Randy Patterson, and other Mississippi coaches took on the challenge of building the new district. All were hard workers and deeply committed, none more so than Anita, then coach at Laurel High School until retirement in 2007 and now coach at Laurel Christian High School. Twice selected as Mississippi Speech and Debate Educator of the Year, Ms. Boyd views her state’s coaches as a close-knit family. Anita is one of the very few coach-parents who have experienced the thrill of coaching their child to win a national championship, her daughter Jessica in Storytelling. Ms. Boyd has also coached a third in Expository Speaking and two semifinalist orators at Nationals. At the NCFL Grand Tournament, Anita coached a finalist in Duo Interp and semifinalists in Drama and Oral Interp. In NFL/NSDA district competition her teams have won a Plaque and two Sweepstakes Trophies. Her chapters have earned three Leading Chapter Awards and honored 11 Academic All Americans, one of whom placed in the national top ten in NSDA points. Anita says, “I have seen so many students changed by speech and debate… I believe that every child who wants to compete on a team should be able to do so. I don’t think it matters if that student ever wins a debate tournament, or ends up as a finalist in an Interp round. I believe speech and debate is about the child, rather than the trophies. I know if I can keep that child motivated, he or she will benefit from the journey and… will have learned how to communicate effectively with the world…” A four-diamond coach, Anita Boyd has served continually as chair or member on the Mississippi District Committee and in the National Tournament supplemental tab room. She also was instrumental in founding NCFL in her state and serves in the tab room of the NCFL Grand Tournament. Anita Boyd has taught students for 40 years and counting. We can all learn from her commitment. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nMary Gormley\n\nInducted 2018 New Jersey Mary is a tall, well-spoken woman who brings a unique personal touch to coaching. Whether it is long range planning with her squad, or immediate one-to-one conversation about the needs and goals of each student, the empathy that is craved and demanded by adolescents, is there from Mary. Her most interesting insight: “Of utmost importance is that the child feels safe in an environment where criticism is key to improvement… By letting the student know that failure presents the opportunity to try something anew or differently, we open up all sorts of possibilities for success.” Mary concludes, “Success may not necessarily come with a trophy, but somewhere down the line, whether it be an interview, a presentation, an audition…that individual has been strengthened by the bonds of support, and the acceptance of criticism as a vehicle for growth, during a career as a speech and debate competitor.” Few coaches have realized that their activity is based upon criticism. Mary is a team builder who believes peer coaching is fundamental to an effective team. And she is proactive, spending time with students in “writing conferences” where personal goals are defined. Another effective technique is her use of lunch walks to build relationships and avoid judgments. Her Montville [NJ] chapter earned two Leading Chapter Awards. Thirty-two members were named Academic All Americans. The team won four Plaques and three Trophies at the district tournament. Five-diamond coach Mary Gormley served 17 terms as district chair, winning a Gold award. At Nationals she has celebrated a School of Excellence Award. Her students were second in Extemp and Congress; finalists in Dramatic Interp, Oratory, Commentary; and won a Congressional Bowl. Mary was New Jersey speech Coach of the Year in 2000. She has coached multiple state winners, among them her first (Humor, 1992), and Sweepstakes (1998), a huge “turnaround” for her squad. Retired from Montville, Mary will continue coaching at Delbarton. Her deep understanding of how to use criticism will continue to shape student success. To learn more about Mary, read the article written by Andrew Hong, published in the April/May 2018 issue of Rostrum magazine. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nMario Herrera\n\nInducted 2018 Georgia National recognition has been earned by the Grady High School (GA) program coached by Hall of Fame coach Mario Herrera. In 2011, Taylor Walker, a talented young lady from Grady, was declared the NSDA Student of the Year. Grady also won sweepstakes awards at both the NSDA and NCFL National Tournaments that same year. In 2016, the Grady squad met with President Barack Obama’s advisers in the Eisenhower Office Building in Washington, D.C., for a wide-ranging discussion on national issues including the transition to Trump and America’s place in the world. Coach Herrera and his squad are no strangers to success. At the Georgia State Tournament, they have achieved nine consecutive tournament championships and are working hard to extend the streak. The Grady program is perennially the largest program in the Georgia Northern Mountain District and earned the Leading Chapter Award in 2006, 2011, and 2017. Grady competitors are regularly the high point leaders in the district. Mario’s squads have won the District Tournament Trophy four times and the District Sweepstakes Plaque 14 years. Coach Herrera has a proactive philosophy of running his program: “Some kids need the team. The team needs some kids. This activity can be a great equalizer of opportunity. To that end, all students should be encouraged, challenged, and embraced. It’s my job to help students realize not just they have a voice, but that their voice matters. That is the true success in this activity.” Mario Herrera has earned his fifth diamond and is a recipient of the Richard Bracknell Service Award, named after the legendary coach who hosted the 2003 Atlanta Nationals. Mario coached at two New Mexico schools prior to Grady. He contends that he became a coach because “speech and debate saved me in high school. It helped me recover from my own folly, challenged me to be successful yet humble, and provided a path toward success.” Most Hall of Fame coaches are retired. Mario looks forward to 15 more joyous years of coaching! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nGreg Malis\n\nInducted 2018 Illinois; Louisiana Thomas Wolfe wrote, “You can’t go home again.” Why not? Hall of Fame coach Greg Malis made the trip twice. A Policy debater for national powerhouse Glenbrook North (IL), Greg first coached at Clark High School (TX), where Hall of Fame coach Kandi King taught him how to run a team and coach speech. In 1996, Greg became coach at Isidore Newman School (LA). His excellent results included winning Sweepstakes and Policy Debate at the 1997 New York City Invitational. In 2002, he returned home to his alma mater to teach math, coach LD and speech, and marry Alma Nicholson. Greg coached the state LD champion three years, including two closeouts. He also mentored several Extemp national entries, including a sweep of district qualifiers in 2006. In 2011, Greg and Alma returned to Greg’s New Orleans home to resurrect the Newman program. It was a challenge. They inherited a small, inexperienced team with a poor work ethic, but a strong fun ethic, loving to travel to, but not prepare for, tournaments. One student, qualified for his third trip to Nationals, chose to go on a trip with friends instead. Alma and Greg blamed themselves and began instilling work requirements: increased practice hours, expanded tournament schedule, and participation in at least two events. They stressed that students should appreciate the opportunity to represent one’s school in competition. Greg’s philosophy was, “We need seniors to model the best work ethic. No tournament is unimportant… Come to practice every day, on time, and ready to work.” The results spoke for themselves: Policy closed out at state in 2017; Newman’s squad was the only school to place in the top three at state for five consecutive years, 2014-2018; Greg and Alma shared Coach of the Year honors in 2016. A Newman Policy team qualified for the elite Tournament of Champions in 2018, breaking a 16-year hiatus. Greg remains a math teacher, but has retired from active coaching. He and Alma were one of the great matrimonial coaching teams, like Greg’s close friends, Lanny and B. J. Naegelin. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nJack Tuckness\n\nInducted 2018 Missouri How does one achieve an exemplary coaching career? A solid philosophy of student focused learning? A large inclusive program? Skillful team building? Consistently successful competitive outcomes? These criteria certainly have been achieved by Missouri’s Jack Tuckness. Originally he established the high school speech and debate program at Waynesville High School (MO). He soon moved to the new Kickapoo High School, where he built a program that was successful for 13 years, placing in Missouri State tournament events, and qualifying 20 entries to Nationals, including a finalist in Extemp and a runner up in Congress. After taking an 11 year hiatus to pursue other interests, Mr. Tuckness substituted as Springfield Parkview High School head coach, qualifying five students to Nationals. In 1998 he was tapped to be head coach at Springfield Central High School. The next 19 years he built Central into a national power, becoming one of the nation’s largest chapters with 12 NSDA All Americans and a stellar national record: three debate semifinalists (one Policy, two Public Forum); eight speech finalists; a Speech School of Excellence Award; and five Debate School of Excellence Awards. Jack is very proud of his student who was a finalist for Student of the Year. But he is most proud that his children were multiple qualifiers to Nationals and achieved quarterfinals in Dramatic Interp, a fifth place finish in Congressional Debate, and a tenth place and a national championship in International Extemp! Mr. Tuckness trained students with his philosophy: “Challenge the students to take responsibility for themselves. They are encouraged to work on their own and share their success with their teammates. I want to help them set realistic goals and not be afraid to stretch themselves. I want them not to fear failure, but turn failure into success, through persistence, hard work, and a positive attitude.” In the last 44 years, Jack says he attended 38 Nationals, 34 to compete, seven with his children, and three times for the fun of it. With his record, they all were fun! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\n2017 Inductees\n\nDr. Paulette \"Polly\" Reikowski\n\nInducted 2017 Minnesota One debate has been never ending in judges’ lounges, professional meetings, and conventions, so let us resolve it here! “What is the most important element for a successful high school forensic program?” The “sine qua non” for a great program, or indeed any activity program, is a supportive high school administrator. A program cannot be established without administrative permission and cannot succeed without administrative approval and support. Champion Hall of Fame coach H. B. Mitchell used to boast, “I never had any trouble as coach. I was the principal at the high school!” Enthusiastic, bright, empathetic, and creative, Dr. Polly Reikowski is principal at Eagan High School (MN). A former coach, her administrative philosophy for activity programs is student-centered: “What is best for the student, most challenging, and also most sustainable [is] the student’s welfare. [It] is more important than the program’s… The effort to ‘grow’ former students…into coaches…is vital.” Polly is a true hands-on administrator. She travels to Nationals and some invitationals with students and has assisted in coaching and judging all events. Her most exhilarating moment was being with the Eagan team when they were presented NSDA’s top award, the Bruno Jacob Trophy. Dr. Reikowski has often been honored: serving six years on the Minnesota state league board, representing Speech, Debate and One Act Play programs; serving on the NSDA Board of Directors as administrative representative; serving as manager for the annual Minnesota State Speech and Debate tournaments; and most important, being honored by her colleagues, with induction into the MSHSL Hall of Fame as a coach, director, and leader in the arts. “I have a lifetime of teaching and coaching,” Polly says. “I have been blessed to be with amazing coaches, teachers, and students every year… I have been fortunate to work with amazing coaches. Many of these people are legends—what a joy to get to know them in person.” Polly, the joy is ours, to know and work with you! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nJames W. \"Jay\" Rye, III\n\nInducted 2017 Alabama A great Southern coach in the tradition of Billy Tate, Dr. Kenny Barfield, and Sandra Silvers is James “Jay” Rye of Montgomery Academy (AL). He has served his profession often and well. Three times Jay has been the National Tournament host in Birmingham. The events were among the largest NSDA tournaments ever held and were hosted in the grand manner of Southern hospitality. Coach Rye served as Deep South district chair, receiving the 2009 Chair of the Year Award. He also holds an Emory Barkley Forum Key. Jay was named Alabama Coach of the Year in 1992 and tapped for the Alabama Speech and Debate Coaches Hall of Fame in 2017. Nationally, Rye has served as NDSA Board member and was awarded the Distinguished Service Key and Plaque. He has earned five diamonds. Mr. Rye has compiled an enviable record as coach. Montgomery Academy has won more championships at the Alabama State Tournament than any other school, dating back to 1956. He coached a national champion in Dramatic Interpretation in 2006. He qualified four LD debaters to the Tournament of Champions in a single year. His Public Forum Debate team won the Stanford University Tournament in 2008. Montgomery Academy won eight District Plaques and five District Trophies. Jay has coached 140 national qualifiers and counting and is always disappointed when a senior fails to qualify. Coach Rye believes, “All students can learn from speech and debate, whether the critical thinking skills, the research skills (or) the ability to think quickly on your feet… (E)very student can benefit from the life skills that are taught.” Jay has dedicated his professional life to speech and debate education. He is known for his ability to expand access to speech and debate within his community and beyond. Another legendary Southerner, Emory University coach Glenn Pelham, often said, “The purpose of one’s life is to serve.” Jay Rye has certainly met and exceeded that test! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nJulie Sheinman\n\nInducted 2017 New York Julie Sheinman entered the forensic world from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts after earning her MFA in Acting. In 1984, Julie “received the call” to teach. In her first year teaching, she began the speech and debate program at Manhattan’s Stuyvesant High School where she has been the loyal shepherd for thousands of students ever since. In addition to running the speech and debate team, Julie teaches Acting at Stuyvesant and has arranged donations of free Broadway theatre tickets for students. She has taken more than 5,000 students to Broadway, many of whom had never seen a Broadway show!\n\nUnder Julie’s 37-year guidance, Stuyvesant has had successful students in every event, including champions in Humorous Interpretation, Congressional Debate, Prose, and multiple NSDA finalists. Her consistently strong team has won dozens of awards including the Bruno E. Jacob Trophy, 10 NCFL team sweepstakes awards, 11 individual NCFL champions, over 40 state champions, and the New York State Sweepstakes Championship multiple times. Over the past few years, Stuyvesant has added Parliamentary Debate to their list of categories. They are ranked nationally.\n\nJulie is a six-diamond coach, Key Coach of the Barkley Forum, and member of both the New York City NSDA District Committee and NYCFL Board, on which she has served for 30 years. Julie was the recipient of the first Stuyvesant High School Alumni Award in recognition of her service and commitment to Stuyvesant. In 2014, she was inducted into the NYCFL Hall of Fame. She has received multiple Outstanding Educator Awards from the University of Chicago.\n\nAmong her forensic graduates are “Billy on the Street” Eichner, actors Telly Leung and Lucy Liu, National Review editor Reihan Salam, former champion Policy debater Hannah Rosin (now with Slate and NPR) and her partner, the nemesis of high schoolers everywhere, David Coleman, president of The College Board. Several of her former team members are running speech and debate programs all over the U.S. This is a humbling testimonial to the experience these alums had while on the Stuyvesant team, and Julie sees this as a major part of her legacy to the activity.\n\nJulie’s heartfelt mission is to offer young people opportunities to become finer people, and finer speakers and debaters. The Stuyvesant Team is diverse and inclusive. From the team’s beginning in 1984, Julie has held the position that no student will ever be denied participation because of financial limits. And no student has! Like all Directors of Forensics, she is a coach, fundraiser, travel agent, nurse, and chaperone… Through her mission, Julie has left an indelible imprint of dedication and integrity with all who have crossed her path. Of all her many students, Julie is most proud of her daughter Fannie, who was the team novice director in 2015-2016. Fannie graduated from Tufts University in 2020 and is currently in veterinary school.\n\nJimmy L. Smith\n\nInducted 2017 Texas Robert Kennedy once said, “I dream of things that never were and ask, ‘why not?'” Jimmy Smith, coach at Princeton High School (TX) is such a visionary. He saw a need for a forum where Texas 3A and smaller schools could debate the style used in the Texas UIL State Tournament, and not the Texas Forensic Association style, which is much different. Moving from the Tall Cotton District in the Panhandle to East Texas, Jimmy was impressed by the Northeast Texas Debate Association, founded by Janice Caldwell. Jimmy envisioned an NFL district with these schools only. His idea attracted 21 schools to the first UIL/NFL district tournament. The first district was so successful and popular that two more were generated. Smaller schools saw the benefits of the NSDA in an equal, competitive atmosphere. Smith later created the LBJ District and the Yellow Rose District, where he serves as district chair. He has been awarded the NSDA Gold Award and the NSDA Distinguished Key and Plaque for his efforts. Coach Smith’s team lives up to his dictum, “Small schools are just as good as big schools, we only do it differently.” Princeton has qualified at least one student to Nationals every year and often wins the squad sweepstakes at tournaments. They have been their district’s Largest Chapter seven times and counting. Smith is equally successful, earning the UIL Sponsor Excellence Award and the Renaissance Teacher of the Year designation. He also serves as a UIL Congressional Debate Adviser. Jimmy’s advice to students: “Remember that there can only be one person to win; but I promise you everyone wins with the knowledge they gain.” Coach Smith’s advice to coaches: “Enjoy it! It’s the hardest job you can have, but the dividends are unbelievable…. Let the students be students and don’t try to win for them. Your toughest job will be explaining to a student why they missed finals. Coaching is about 20 years later, when a student gives you a hug and says, ‘Thanks.'” Texas students owe Coach Jimmy Smith a big hug for creating new opportunities for them. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nJacquelyn \"Jacci\" Young\n\nInducted 2017 Missouri Exemplar, Mentor, Legend: Four decades and still going strong is Jacquelyn Young, currently speech and debate coach at Blue Springs High School (MO). The first African American woman elected to the NSDA Hall of Fame, her amazing competitive record bears witness to her commitment and skills. At the MSHSAA Tournament, Jacci coached 14 state champions. At NSDA Nationals, she has qualified 87 students, including six semifinalists, seven finalists, three final round winners, and three champions. Her squads have won three School of Excellence Awards and two School of Honor Trophies. Although Missouri rules do not allow participation in National Circuit Invitationals, Ms. Young entered one student in the George Mason University Patriot Games. He won four of five events and won tenth in sweepstakes by himself! Jacquelyn’s philosophy of coaching “is centered around respect for each other… I expect each student to give 100%. My goal is to motivate them to see the life skill value that each of them can achieve through going through this activity.” She engages diverse learners from a variety of backgrounds and gives them the skills and motivation to achieve success. Coach Young’s service to her community and her profession is well known. She has created and performed several educational webinars and seminars for the NSDA and the Speech and Theater Association of Missouri coaches and students. Because of her integrity, Jacci is always chosen to serve on the district tournament tabulation committee. Her most exhilarating moments were when she was chosen as co-emcee of the National Awards Assembly and earning a fifth diamond for her NSDA key. A very disappointing moment was when her son, her best Drama entry, did not get to compete in the district tournament. “All my career,” Jacci explains, “I have worked to represent God first and the codes of ethics of my school district and the NSDA.” Jacquelyn Young: a career making a difference; a life well lived. —Compiled by James Copeland\n\n2016 Inductees\n\nByron Arthur\n\nInducted 2016 Louisiana The two greatest speeches ever given at the Hall of Fame banquet were delivered by Bruno Jacob and Byron Arthur. In 1978, NFL/NSDA founder Bruno Jacob, ailing and frail, mesmerized the inaugural banquet with his vision that created the League. In 2016, inductee Byron Arthur delivered a compelling, powerful call to action on topics like diversity, inclusion, and love. Mr. Arthur has been honored as Louisiana High School Speech League Coach of the Year. He is a Key Coach at Emory University’s Barkley Forum. The NSDA awarded Byron the first Frank Sferra Director’s Commendation in 2014. A former NCFL Diocesan Moderator, Byron now serves on the NSDA Board of Directors. Byron coached at two chapters: New Orleans-Jesuit and Holy Cross School. He created two strong regional tournaments, which attracted a national field of competitors. As an NFL/NSDA and NCFL coach, his squads won two state championships and earned national championships in 1996 and 2015. One of Byron’s debaters was selected to the USA Debate Team. An Arthur-coached debate team won Policy Debate at The Glenbrooks, a renowned national circuit event. “Love, relationships, and rigor,” contends Byron, are at the heart of successful coaching. “Love is making your team a place where students find nurture, joy, support, and discipline. Relationships mean as a teacher/coach, I have the strength to be vulnerable to my students, and in turn, allow them to do the same. They understand this is about so much more than winning. Finally, rigor means…students are bold enough to meet the challenges before them, and in turn, will challenge themselves. In the end, we are looking to inspire our students to be productive citizens, who will lead and change the communities in which they live.” Coach Arthur thanks his mother, Delores, his high school band director, Mr. Orkus, and his debate coach, Amelia J. Dyer, who “showed me how to be a loving and effective teacher. Most of all, the young men at Holy Cross and Jesuit…the true Blessings that God has rained down into my life.” — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nEloise Weisinger Blair\n\nInducted 2016 Texas Eloise Weisinger Blair is a cautionary tale. For many years, she did what the heart and soul of the teaching profession does: she brought heart and soul into her classroom. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, Eloise was tasked with a school where the factors of real life would exhaust any teacher before she ever got a contestant to the starting line. Eloise did not have the rooms full of exceptional students. Few were great by nature; most had greatness thrust upon them—by Eloise. She never complained, she just worked harder. And she superimposed her sense of excellence on students who had not seen it before in themselves or others. She was a great AP English teacher and a great coach. The cautionary tale? Eloise is two teachers. Her first career I just described. She had a second career at another school with the type of student body she had never had, and her successes reached national acclaim. There by the grace of God she could illustrate that greatness of teaching is not determined by success of student performance. The truly great teachers are probably toiling in the vineyards of the less advantaged and are doing more good than will ever be recorded in the annals the NDSA. Eloise knows what few of the vainglorious in the coaching ranks know: excellence in coaching is excellence in real teaching and real teaching might occur away from the awards assembly in God’s starker vineyards. Eloise has excelled in both fields. — Compiled by Hall of Fame coach David Johnson At Houston Lamar High School, Eloise coached the national champion in Extemporaneous Debate in 2016 and 2017: the same student, a rare double winner. She also had a Public Forum Debate quarterfinalist, and two finalists in International Extemporaneous Speaking. Her students have also placed at the NCFL Grand Finals. In the district tournament, her Lamar squad won three Sweepstakes Plaques and one District Trophy. Coach Blair’s students have also won and placed at both Texas state tournaments, UIL and TFA. Eloise, a five-diamond coach, has been honored by the National Federation, the Texas Speech Communication Association, the University Interscholastic League, and the University of Houston School of Education. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nMark Ferguson\n\nInducted 2016 Illinois Everyone loves a show! Ed Sullivan’s “Really Great Shew” dominated television; Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie Home Companion” entertained radio listeners for 40 years. But no one is better at producing a show than Mark Ferguson, retired Director of Television and Film at Glenbrook South High School (IL). He transformed the National Tournament Awards Assembly into a multimedia extravaganza! Mark’s story begins as a student NFL competitor for Perry High School in Ohio. Future Hall of Fame coach “Louie” Mattachione coached Mark, who won the 1973 NFL National Tournament in Dramatic Interpretation. For more than ten years, Mark served as speech coach at GBS and coached his own national champion in 1993, future screen star and cabaret performer Emily Bergl, in Poetry. Mark also developed a new Television and Film program at GBS. He had access to modern equipment, rare for a high school, and was able to teach all aspects of professional video and film production. In 1991, NFL Councilor Ted Belch, host of the Glenbrook Nationals, wanted to create a unique event. Mark Ferguson suggested interactive video interviews, a daily news show, and a video history of the tournament. The tournament was a huge hit, and Mark’s work was widely praised. The NFL then requested Mark to make the National Awards Assembly a celebration of achievement, like the Academy Awards, and Mark brought professional direction to the project. But always the educator, he used his students and alumni as crew. Audiences were entranced, but rarely realized that 16-hour days and immaculate planning were necessary to create this ultimate reality show. The NFL also had another project in mind: “The humblest student in the land, should be taught by the greatest teacher in the land.” How? Video! Using a grant from the Bradley Foundation, Mark Ferguson directed a series of videos featuring great NFL coaches, each teaching their specialty. Champion student, champion coach, director of professionally staged award shows and important educational videos: the NSDA applauds the compelling work of Hall of Fame Coach Mark Ferguson. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nRobert Shepard\n\nInducted 2016 Missouri; Texas Words define each person’s life. Words like opportunity, commitment, and pride would define the life and work of Robert Shepard, originally from Missouri, currently the coach at Plano High School (TX). Robert maximizes opportunity for his students. He provides his commitment to their growth and success, requests their commitment, and gives them opportunities to succeed. He takes pride in the result, and the results have been consistently excellent. In Missouri, Shepard’s troupe of inner city, urban youth won the Missouri state championship in Readers Theater. In Texas, his squad won the state sweepstakes with entries only in individual events. At NSDA Districts, his team won both the Sweepstakes Plaque and the District Trophy. At Nationals, he has coached a Poetry champion, a third place in Dramatic, and a finalist in Oratory. Mr. Shepard has earned three diamonds and served as president of the Texas Forensic Association. Robert explains his coaching philosophy by analogy: “Students are like plants, all needing different…conditions in order to thrive… As a gardener, it is my responsibility to understand and respond to those needs so they have every opportunity to mature… That may happen early or it may take time…but regardless…they will forever be changed by the nurturing and tending in the speech program.” Mr. Shepard also points out, “I don’t just educate children but also other coaches, providing resources and feedback to make them stronger. A team can only improve to the level of their competition, so the stronger the playing field, the stronger the competitor.” But Shepard the teacher knows, “We must teach students before we can coach them… We must teach (coaches) before we can mentor them.” Once taught and coached, a team is great to behold. Robert is proud when “onlookers knew our team was there to compete, and regardless of their ability or potential to place…they presented themselves as a unified team, with a unified purpose.” — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nDr. Alfred \"Tuna\" Snider\n\nInducted 2016 Vermont The National Forensic League (now the National Speech & Debate Association) was a high school speech association, but it never forgot its college roots. Bruno Jacob, a college debate competitor and college teacher, was its founder. His model was Pi Kappa Delta, a college debate fraternity. Tau Kappa Delta, another college speech group, donated the National Tournament Trophy. When debate was banned at the National Tournament by the Secondary Principals Association for five years, it was Karl Robinson, a Northwestern University professor, who helped Bruno reinstate debate in 1950. Many colleges hosted the National Tournament. College coaches like James Unger sponsored high school speech/debate summer institutes, where college coaches taught. High school coaches who became college coaches conducted high school invitational tournaments: Glenn Pelham, the Barkley Forum at Emory; and J. W. Patterson, the Tournament of Champions at Kentucky. Dr. Rich Edwards of Baylor spent hundreds of hours computerizing an ever-larger National Tournament. But it was Dr. Alfred Snider, coach of debate at the University of Vermont, who was the key figure in international high school debate. For three years, he coached of the U.S. high school national team, with excellent results in several international competitions, including the World Schools Debating Championships. “Tuna” also conducted debate-training activities in 44 countries and brought World Schools style debate to the NSDA in America. For 10 years Professor Snider served as Operations Director at the National Tournament. The hard work of “Tuna” and his crew of collegiate coaches made larger and larger tournaments possible. Alfred Snider was honored at the 2008 National Speech & Debate Tournament with the NSDA Humanitarian Award. The USA World Schools Debate Invitational championship trophy is named in his honor. Dr. Snider spent more than 40 years promoting debate and critical communication worldwide. He knew debate was competitive, but proved it also could unify people, cultures, and nationalities. — Compiled by James Copeland\n\n2015 Inductees\n\nDr. Elizabeth Ballard\n\nInducted 2015 Oklahoma The doctor is in…the NSDA. Dr. Betsy Ballard, coach at Norman High School (OK), is one of the very few NSDA coaches to earn a Ph.D. Academics always support their discipline, and Dr. Ballard has performed continuous service to the speech community: as host chair of the superior 1998 Oklahoma Nationals, at the University of Oklahoma; and ten terms as district chair of the Western Oklahoma District. Dr. Betsy has earned many honors for her teaching and coaching skills: the H.B. Mitchell Award for Outstanding Coaching, twice; the Charline Burton Speech Educator Award in the Western Oklahoma District; and the 2001 Speech Educator of the Year award from the Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association. She was awarded both Silver and Gold Awards by the NSDA. Dr. Ballard was awarded the Ralph E. Carey Trophy for Distinguished Career Service by the NSDA in 2012. She earned five coaching diamonds. Ballard is also play director, and her students excelled by winning several state team speech championships and One Act Play Awards. In the NSDA finals she coached two national runner-ups: LD Debate and Congressional Debate–Senate. Under the tutelage of Dr. Ballard, her chapter led the district in new members nine years; and was the largest chapter three times. The Norman High School squad won the Leading Chapter Award four times! The doctor’s philosophy is academically sound. “You have to be both a good winner and good loser in life,” instructs Betsy. “Speech competitions are a good place to work on both.” Ballard insists, “Always have a plan for success. If you don’t, you have by default, a plan for failure.” She deals with negative situations by turning them into learning situations, asking her students, “What are you going to do to solve this problem you have created for yourselves?” Dr. Elizabeth Ballard: Ph.D. in English, coach of champions, national host, state leader, district chair, honored colleague. When the doctor was in, speech activities in Oklahoma were indeed, OK! — Compiled by James Copeland\n\nJane Boyd\n\nInducted 2015 Arkansas; Texas “Miss Perfect,” NFL Secretary Jim Copeland called her. Whatever service was needed, Jane Boyd performed to perfection: teaching, coaching, management, hospitality. A four-diamond coach, she served for more than two decades on the District Committee, three terms as district chair, and won the Best New Chair award in 2001.
