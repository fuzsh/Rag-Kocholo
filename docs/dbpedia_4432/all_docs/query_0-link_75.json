        "text": "1. Low or no-cost monthly premiums\n\nYou have access to a Medicare Advantage plan as low as $0 monthly. If you don't qualify for a $0 premium plan, the average is $51.61 per month. This premium is low, especially compared to a Medicare Supplement plan or your Part B premiums.\n\n2. Lower out-of-pocket costs\n\nOriginal Medicare doesn't cap their out-of-pocket costs, so you could end up with unexpectedly high medical bills. With Original Medicare Part B, you must pay the premium, deductible, and 20% coinsurance for Medicare-approved services and procedures. The 20% can add up.\n\n3. Additional benefits not available with Original Medicare\n\nWant routine dental coverage? Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance) don't offer comprehensive dental, vision, or hearing coverage. These services would be entirely out-of-pocket for you.\n\nThe good news? Medicare Advantage plans have low or no-cost premiums, an out-of-pocket maximum, offer additional benefits, and are regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). With a Medicare Advantage plan, you could receive prescription drug coverage, routine dental, vision, hearing, transportation, reduced cost-sharing, a gym membership, and more.\n\nMedicare Advantage Special Needs Plans (SNPs)\n\nSpecial Needs Plans, or SNPs, are a type of Medicare Advantage plan. There are two types of Special Needs Plans that may be available to you: Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNP).\n\nChronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) are limited to people with specific illnesses or characteristics. For example, you may qualify for a C-SNP if you have diabetes, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), HIV/AIDS, dementia, chronic heart failure, or other qualifying illness. Medicare C-SNPs tailor benefits, provider choices, and drug formularies to meet the needs of the special needs groups they serve.\n\nYou may qualify for a Dual Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) if you are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. With a D-SNP, the State of Indiana may cover your Medicare costs, depending on your eligibility."
