        "text": "Evergreen Library Cards\n\nAnyone, regardless of residency, may come to the Centerville Public Library. A library card is required only if you wish to check out materials to take with you.\n\nCenterville Public Library is a member of Evergreen Indiana, a network of more than 100 Indiana libraries. If you are a resident of Center Township, the library card you obtain at Centerville is an Evergreen card and it may be used at any Evergreen library.\n\nChildren 5 years of age and older may obtain their own card. Materials for children age 4 and younger may be checked out on the card of a parent or legal guardian.\n\nApplications must be filled out and signed in person at the library.\n\nCenter Township Residents\n\nBring a government-issued photo ID. If your ID does not show your current address, also bring a utility bill, tax receipt or bank statement that has your current address. Anyone 17 and younger does not need to have ID, but the parent or legal guardian signing for them must show ID.\n\nNon-Center Township Residents\n\nMorrisson-Reeves Library (Abington, Boston, Clay, Dalton, Franklin, Green, Harrison, New Garden, Perry, Wayne and Webster Townships), Cambridge City Library (Jackson and Washington Townships), Hagerstown Library (Jefferson Township) and Dublin Library are part of the Evergreen network. Residents of those townships need to get their Evergreen card from their home library, but that same card will work at Centerville.\n\nIndiana residents who live outside of Wayne County, and who donâ€™t live where there is an Evergreen library, may obtain a Centerville card if their home library is part of the state reciprocal agreement. This reciprocal-borrower card may be used at Centerville but not other Evergreen libraries.\n\nRenew an Existing Card\n\nLibrary card accounts must be updated every two years for residents and every year for reciprocal borrowers. To renew your library card, please visit the library and present a valid photo ID (as well as proof of residency if your address has changed), and we will renew your account at no cost.\n\nReplace a Lost Library Card\n\nA replacement Evergreen card may be obtained for a $2.00 fee. It is not necessary to bring proof of residency again, unless your account has expired."
