        "text": "About the City of Centerville\n\nThe City of Centerville is located halfway between Houston and Dallas on I-45, at Texas Hwy 75 and Texas 7. Centerville is the Heart of the “Deerest Place in Texas” Leon County. We are a convenient place to stop and visit. Reminisce in the recently remodeled 1887 courthouse, visit one of the last “Hanging jails”, browse antique shops or picnic in the gazebo on the “Square” or the small city park. Each 4th of July, the Courthouse Square becomes a hubbub of celebration of our freedom. This tradition, which originally began in the 1850’s, is now an annual event with good food, arts and crafts sales, entertainment, games for children of all ages and ending with a night of outstanding fireworks. Special events include the 4th of July Celebration and Christmas on the Square.\n\nOur History\n\nThe town of Centreville, as it was first spelled, officially became the Leon County Seat on January 24, 1850. D. C. Carrington donated 100 acres of land and another 100 acres was purchased for a token price of five dollars from Robert J. Townes. The County kept the town square and sold off the rest which became the current City of Centerville. Thomas H. Garner built the first house south of the courthouse square. W. B. Johnson and Brother had the first business to be established. W. A. Saunders built the first hotel and D. N. Whatley built the first drug store. H. A. McWhirter conducted the first school in back of the drug store. Centerville’s first church building was constructed and shared by all denominations. The first post office was established with Wm. B. Johnson as postmaster. In 1882, the city had grown and had a district school, a gristmill and cotton gin and a population of 400. Centerville is yet a lively place to live, with good schools, churches and a fine social climate."
