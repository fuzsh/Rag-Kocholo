        "text": "RICHMOND, Ind. — The air above the Richmond 2 solar park remains crystal clear on a sunny April day even as thousands of solar panels produce electricity.\n\nThat's in stark contrast to the image most associated with energy production: A large coal-fired plant belching smoke and polluting the air. The Indiana Municipal Power Agency, a nonprofit, wholesale power provider with 61 member communities, decided in 2000 it needed to reduce its dependence on coal.\n\nIMPA, which includes Richmond, Centerville and Dublin as members, in 2000 set a 20-year goal of generating 20 percent of its energy by sources other than coal, said Raj Rao, IMPA's president and CEO, who began his energy career in 1977 at Richmond Power and Light.\n\n\"As of this year, we have 67 percent of the energy coming from coal and 33 percent is coming from something else,\" Rao said. \"We have decided that by 2030 we need to have 50 percent dependence on coal and 50 percent coming from some other resources.\"\n\nSolar power represents a part of that non-coal energy. By the end of 2018, IMPA had 20 solar parks statewide with a generating capacity of 48.2 megawatts. That still lags far behind the 615 megawatt capacity of its coal facilities, the 410 megawatt capacity of its natural gas facilities and the 296 megawatt capacity of purchased wind and nuclear electricity.\n\nHowever, even as the Richmond 2 solar panels have begun producing electricity in earnest, more plans progress to expand that production in the city and in Wayne County. IMPA on Tuesday celebrated the Richmond 2 solar park along Interstate 70 with a ribbon cutting, although the park began energy production last year. At the same time, two more Richmond parks along I-70 continue development, as does a smaller park in Centerville.\n\nIMPA's use of solar power actually began during 2014 in Richmond. A small solar park was installed at Richmond Power & Light's location along Indiana 27. That Richmond 1 site produces a capacity of 1 megawatt and can power 144 homes. The new Richmond 2 facility features about 27,000 solar panels with an output of 7.44 megawatts that can power more than 1,000 homes.\n\n\"Richmond has been a wonderful host,\" Rao said.\n\nThe Richmond 2 facility sits on 58 acres that were formerly part of New Creations at 6200 National Road E. just off I-70 on the city's east side. Construction is set to begin in June on the Richmond 3 solar park, which sits just south of I-70 on a 46-acre site at 635 Commerce Road, next to Berry Plastics where Commerce Road ends. Construction takes six to eight months. It is planned to produce 4.5 megawatts.\n\nEven before Richmond 3 begins formal construction, IMPA plans Richmond 4, which also is just south of I-70. Richmond's Board of Zoning Appeals on April 11 approved 4-0 a petition requesting zoning variances for the proposed Richmond 4, which is planned as four parcels on both sides of Industries Road just west of Flatley Road. The variance would allow a chain-link security fence with barbed wire and eliminate the need to plant buffering trees that would shade solar panels.\n\nProject manager Emily Williams told the BZA that Richmond 4 would produce 7.9 megawatts and start production, if all goes as planned, during the first part of 2020. That would raise Richmond's output to 20.8 megawatts.\n\n\"We may be getting as much as 20 to 25 percent of our energy from solar or renewable,\" said Randy Baker, general manager for RP&L.\n\nPlans have also begun for a 1-megawatt solar field on a McMinn Road plot near College Corner Road north of Centerville. The town's plan commission conducted a public hearing April 18 about IMPA's request to change the 17-acre site's zoning from agricultural to industrial.\n\nThe electricity generated by the solar parks enters the power grid just like all other energy produced or bought by IMPA. Because it's far less than Richmond's use, which Baker said can peak around 150 megawatts and drop to about 80 megawatts, that energy is used locally.\n\n\"The city of Richmond is so fortunate to enjoy such an impactful and mutually beneficial relationship with IMPA,\" Mayor Dave Snow said. \"As we continue to add to our tool kit to attract people to the city of Richmond, this goes a long way in attracting people to our city and making Richmond a city that’s looking forward instead of just at the issues we face today and how we can better serve today. What are we doing to look forward and be a more environmentally sustainable city?\"\n\nThe planned Richmond 3, Richmond 4 and Centerville solar parks are among 11 new solar parks currently planned or under construction that would raise IMPA's total to 31 stretching from Tell City in the south to Argos in the north and from Richmond in the east to Waynetown in the west. IMPA projects that will increase its solar capacity statewide to 88 megawats, and IMPA continues its ownership of production facilities that help reduce its costs.\n\n“We have the resources, we built the machines, and right now 85 to 90 percent of the power that’s coming to IMPA through its members are coming from our own resources, our own machines,\" Rao said. \"We don’t buy too much in the market.”\n\nThat has proven cost-efficient for IMPA's members. According to its 2018 annual report, IMPA has lowered its rates 7.40 percent from 2017 to 2019. That includes a 1.05 percent drop in 2017, a 5.25 percent drop in 2018 and a 1.10 percent drop in 2019.\n\nAlthough the new solar parks, including Richmond 2, utilize a single axis tracking system that enables the solar panels to follow the sun by rotating on their own, solar power unfortunately isn't a 24-hour-a-day energy source. IMPA will continue to need coal and other resources.\n\n“The sun doesn’t shine all the day and wind doesn’t blow all the time, so that means still there’s a time we need to work on making sure the other resources are available,” Rao said.\n\nBut when the sun does shine, Richmond stands at the forefront of IMPA's solar plans. A billboard along I-70 for IMPA and RP&L claims they are \"bringing solar power and low electric rates to your community,\" but the city's importance is most notable because of the Richmond 2 solar park — soon to be joined by two others — clearly visible from the highway.\n\n\"We will have plenty of solar parks in Richmond,\" Rao said. \"As much as we can fit.\""
