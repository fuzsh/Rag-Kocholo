With the power to choose a provider like Just Energy, you can access carbon offsets to help lessen your carbon footprint.\n\nMore Affordable Rates\n\nEnergy is a substantial portion of home and business expenses, but it doesn’t have to be when you reside in a deregulated energy market. Deregulation allows multiple energy providers to compete for your business. In a world where customers value affordable energy, the electricity and natural gas providers with the best rates win. This incentivizes providers like Just Energy to offer incredibly competitive rates to entice you to sign a contract.\n\nBetter Customer Service\n\nCompetition in deregulated energy markets doesn’t just mean better prices. It also means finding a new energy provider is easy. To keep you around, natural gas and electricity providers like Just Energy provide a customer service experience you’ll never forget.
