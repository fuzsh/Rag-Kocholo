B. Blair, inventor of the contrivance and head of the manufacturing company, J. W. Hawley, head of the sales company, and C. B. Conn, salesman, with their wives, are in Rochester and will secure permanent residences at once. As soon as a factory site is secured, the plant will be moved here from Decatur, Ill. Several locations are available.\n\nThe F. & M. Assn directors have written the following letter for the public:\n\n\"The Universal Safety Corporation, at present located in Decatur, Ill., has furnished this Association complete detailed information relative to its organization, financial condition, manufacturing plans and capital requirements, all of which have been carefully investigated by the directors of the Association, and have been found to be satisfactory in every way.\n\n\"The company in question purposes [sic] to locate its manufacturing plant in Rochester, and to that end, is offering a limited quantity of its capital stock for sale. The proceeds of this stock are to be used for the purchase of the manufacturing building, additional machinery, materials, payroll requirements and other expenses incident to the establishment of this factory in Rochester.\n\n\"This Association does not guarantee nor assume liability for any sum or sums invested in this or any other enterprise. It does, however, take pleasure in recommending the Universal Safety Corporation, as being in the opinion of the officers and directors of this Association, a responsible legitimate enterprise, organized and conducted along sound business lines, and recommends that the people of this vicinity extend their cooperation and support to the establishment of the factory of this company in Rochester.\n\nFarmers & Merchants Assn\n\nJ.

Moore, J. W. Hawley and Guy Alspach -- to arrange a banquet to be held within the next week or 10 days at which time final arrangements will be completed. Each stockholder of the corporation will be expected to be present at this banquet and bring with him guests, who are interested in the project.\n\n[Rochester Sentinel, Saturday, November 16, 1918]\n\nSAFDICATOR PLANT STILL IN DECATUR\n\nBecause of the differences existing between the two companies, The Universal Safety Sales Corporation and the Universal Safety Corp., have dissolved relationship, according to a letter received Monday from J. A. Hawley, president of the former concern. The Safety Sales Corporation, which attempted to float a stock issue here for the manufacturing concern, notified the local people that all money paid over on stock would be refunded, as soon as possible.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean, however, that the Safdicator factory will not come to Rochester, as it is understood that Dr. J. B. Blair, the inventor, is still desirous of locating here under a more favorable proposition than the one already made.\n\nMr. Hawley and his associates made many friends here, however, and Rochester men who were interested, will regret the trouble.\n\n[Rochester Sentinel, Monday, December 16, 1918]\n\nSAFETY FIRST CO.

The owner of the new factory and sales company is Bert Hisey who now has a nice business of his own in the tire patch game. The complete set as such is named the \"Safety First\" outfit.\n\nFor several years Mr. Hisey has sold a tire patch and repair outfit for other concerns in Northern Indiana. Profiting by his experience he worked up a patch of his own which has held up under the most trying conditions. The patch in fact practically becomes a part of the tube after it has once been attached.\n\nMr. Hisey makes the complete outfit at his home and in a short time will start on the road selling the patch to dealers.

Presidential Nominee Tom Dewey may know all the finer arts of gangbusting, politics, etc., but he still has much to learn about horse shoes.\n\nThe current issue of Life magazine (page 2), shows a picture of Mr. and Mrs. Dewey standing under a horse shoe which is nailed with the open end down on the front of the springhouse on their farm.\n\nAccording to superstition, says an old timer, the horse shoe should always be hung prongs up. When hung prongs down all of the good luck runs out of the open end.\n\nIncluded in a number of letters to Life's editors was one from Charles W. Safford, well-known Newcastle township farmer. Safford's comment follows:\n\n\"If Tom Dewey wins, I'll hang my horse shoe wrong end up, too. Charles W.

The Chamber of Commerce purchased a site for them in Fansler's Manitou Heights and the factory was completed.\n\nThe company was confronted with a general strike in Rochester, Warsaw and Bourbon.

The subject of this review attended the public schools of Jay county and then took work at the normal school at Marion, Indiana, with a view toward following the profession of teaching.

The former died in 1845, when Henry was but twelve years old, leaving him to carve a fortune for himself. He had, up to that time, received very little schooling and subsequently got still less. Thus he obtained a very limited education. He engaged as a farm hand, and, by dint of his own industry and economy, accumulated sufficient to purchase a farm of his own. August 25, 1855, his marriage with Catharine Feller was solemnized, and their union has been blessed with ten children, viz: Thomas J., who married Flora Huffman; Mary A., Edward F., Urias B., Esther E., wife of Enos Swihart; Lydia A., Daniel M., Albert H., Sarah J., and Melissa C. In 1864 he emigrated to Miami County and settled on the farm where he now lives. In his vocation of farming he has been uniformly successful, now owning 160 acres of well improved land.

When John was four years old his parents emigrated to Ohio and located in Fairfield County, but two years later they removed to Lagan County, Ohio. After residing here three years, they located in Henry County, Ohio. In 1838 they returned to Fairfield County, Ohio, where our subject spent his youth working upon a farm by the month. In November, 1851, he came to this county and located in Union Township. He removed to Allen Township and located where he now resides in March, 1860. During his entire life he has been engaged in agricultural pursuits. A part of his attention, however, has been given to the stock business. January 8, 1854, he was married to Ann Elizabeth Cover, a native of Frederick County, Maryland, born, of German descent, August 4, 1833. She was the eldest child born to William and Lucinda (Hina) Cover, both natives of Maryland. This marriage has resulted in the birth of seven children: Their names are Charles W., William I., Charlotte L., Rosa M., Elmer H., Noah W. and Jams G. Of these William I. died when eighteen months old. In politics Mr. Savage is an ardent Republican. He owns a handsome little farm of ninety-two acres nearly all of which is in cultivation. His farm is fitted up with good fences and buildings and is a very desirable location. Mr. Savage is an enterprising and influential farmer and one of the honored and worthy citizens of the township.\n\n[History of Miami County, Indiana, 1887, Brant & Fuller. pp. 528-529]\n\nSAVAGE, LYMAN J. [Macy, Allen Township, Miami County]\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nLyman J. Savage, one of the enterprising young business men of Macy, was born in Allen Township, this county, June 30, 1858. Our subject spent his boyhood and youth upon his father's farm and attending the district school. He received in this an ordinary common school education. In the fall of 1880, he engaged in the furniture business in Macy, in partnership with his father, the name of the firm being L. J. Savage & Co. They have a commodious little business room well stocked with furniture, and are doing a good profitable business. Emma F. Farrar, daughter of Charles and Rebecca (Rammer) Farrar, of Macy, became his wife November 1, 1879. Their marriage has resulted in the birth of three children, all of whom are living. Their names are William R., Edith, and Charles T. Mr. and Mrs. Savage are members of the Christian Church. The former is a member of the F. & A. M. Lodge and a Republican in politics.\n\n[History of Miami County, Indiana, 1887, Brant & Fuller. p. 529]\n\nSAWDUST AND TINSEL [Rochester, Indiana]\n\nSee> Cole Bros.\n\n__________\n\nSAWDUST AND TINSEL\n\nBy Foyd King, General Agent, Cole Bros. and Clyde Beatty's\n\nTrained Wild Animal Circus\n\nAs told to Earl L. Sisson\n\nChapter I\n\nThis is the story of a circus, its life, its fortune and its adversities. Its purpose is to take you from the distruction and tumult of the road to the more quiet and congenial surroundings of the winter quarters, to survey operations from the hour when new and unwonted scenes appear to challenge the blase temperament of the city, or to startle the retirement of the county seat to the finale of a season of activity, when the bandmaster's baton drops upon the last note of \"Home, Sweet Home\".\n\nIt will scrutinize the coming of strangers into strange places and observe the magic building of Rome in a day. We shall gaze upon the gorgeous pageant of a parade on Main Street and follow it with the thrill of boyhood and girlhood, back to the \"lot\" where we shall peer freely, unreservedly about a tented empire with its strange sounds and entrancing sights.\n\nWe will see the master mind and his associates in counsel and in action. It shall be our prerogative to study the life, character and habits of the motley throng of \"show\" people and learn of morals and manners, of hopes and fears, of trials and solicitudes, and in it we shall be privileged to pass sunny hours on meadows enamelled with violets and buttercups, where the circus is passing its day, a halcyon day upon which memory rests with fond tenacity for the thousands of troopers who have written the history of the great white top during a century that has passed.\n\nFirst Show in 1830\n\nIt was about the year 1830 in the environs of New York City when a red-coated, bespangled little band struck up a merry melody while a small round-top tent swelled gracefully upward. It was the first tented circus erected in America, and it was then that the open-air show assumed the dignity and importance of an under-cover performance. A crude enough affair it was as compared with the perfection and finish of its present day successor. The flags and banners and bunting which now add so much grace and beauty waved no friendly greeting; the clamorous welcome of side-show barkers and ticket sellers was missing; no menagerie offered its accumulated wealth of curious, snarling beasts; human curiosity was yet to be awakened to the overpowering splendor and magnificence of the parade; there was a lack of sentiment and excitement and appeal to the senses; only din and confusion and broiling heat. And from that meagre beginning has evolved the major circus of today, involving a buainess so estensive that few persons possess anything but the vaguest conception of its magnitude, organization and the methods of operation.\n\nHighly Systematized\n\nUnderlying the pomp and the glitter of sawdust and tinsel is a system of government and management whose scale and scope are stupendous and staggering. Few human institutions are more perfect in operation and direction. From a standardized pattern which has been in the cutting for a hundred years, the Army has found hints of strengthening its nomenclature. European monarchs, visiting American circuses incognito have marvelled at the celerity with which train-load upon trainload of materials have been packed and loaded and moved off into the night to be unpacked and erected again on the following day.\n\nMr. Average Citizen who arrives at the railroad yards with the break of dawn and watches the debarkation of the show in Centerville sees the long string of \"flats\" loaded with flashing red baggage wagons, the horse cars, the cook shack. He wonders at the mercurial change that daybreak brings. His memory limns with scenes from a pervious circus day. He is filled with expectancy for the thousand and one wonders which promise to unfold before him ere the show loads out at night. But of the bister colored background of management, preparation, expense and risk so devoid of the saga that spells romance and charm, he knows nothing and cares less.\n\nAnd yet, what an important part those very elements play. How dramatically woven into the warp and weft of the gigantic pattern. What emergencies constantly met and dealth with. What perplexing obstacles overcome. What of the amount of capital invested; the gamble against time and weather and accident; those and many other vicissitudes against which the circus stakes.\n\nNo Fabulous Profits\n\nThere is a popular misapprehension about circus profits. Perhaps the very glamour of it all is responsible. Mr. Average Citizen seeing a well-filled tent may conclude that there must be fabulous monetary returns. A major circus \"top\" may very lilely seat 10-thousand persons. And a hasty calculation would show probably gross receipts at about $7,000.00. The average daily free admissions are 11-hundred. These are largely the tickets given for billposting privileges, city officials, newspapers and others. Sometimes the number is larger. It is known that on one occasion, where conditions appeared hostile to the circus, three thousand free tickets were necessary in order to iron out the difficulties. Then, it is true that the average circus day sees one child's face to each four adults. That means that with a capacity house there will be twenty-five hundred half-fare admissions. If you deduct these from the maximum $7,500.00 fabulous profits dwindle rapidly.\n\nThen too, the casual observer whose inexperienced eye visualizes a capacity house may reckon without knowledge. He fails to see the fellow who spreads himeslf out over two seats regardless of the plea of an experienced usher who attempts to correct the condition.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Monday, January 28, 1935]\n\nChapter II\n\nThe modern circus like the modern merchant must concede that the customer is always right. If a courteous request be ignored, there is no alternative, the circus can do nothing but retire gracefully and lose its revenue, and there are few crowds of ten thousand souls into which are not fused the presence of many who would shrink from purloining a loaf of bread, but will peculate additional seating space in a circus without remorse.\n\nThe circus does not run its season, dissolve and disperse. In winter the entire establishment must be maintained. Only performers and workmen are dropped, and with the former this is generally but a suspension of service, for contracts are frequently made for a period of years. Owners, managers, contracting agents, advertising agents, press agents, treasurer, bookkeepers and others find no idle moments. Rolling stock suffering from the effects of the season entour, needs the carpenter and the painter; new acts and novelties must be secured or produced to keep abreast of the ever changing times; new routes must be considered and laid out; and to do this the management must know the population and character of every town; have information of the condition of business and the prospects for the coming season; know the national, state and municipal laws and the character of licenses together with the price of food for man and beast. Floods, droughts, windstorms and their effects upon crops and people must be considered. Railroad terminals including loading and unloading facilities, heighth of tunnels and their relative position to loading yards must be taken into account. Proximity of show lots to loading yards, condition of soil of the lot and availability of substitute grounds, in event of heavy rain comes into the picture. The circus is a fair-weather show and the management must have a definite knowledge of wet and dry conditions and seasons in order to avoid encountering, insofar as possible, any unpropitious meteoroligical handicaps.\n\nTransportation Problems\n\nThe question of transportation is the most important one involved, and upon its cost and facilities the route of the circus is in a great measure determined. A small town, strategically located with reference to converging railroads and highways may offer greater possibilities to the trained circus manager than does its city neighbor fifty miles away.\n\nAll through the winter months a corps of expert seamstresses must be employed turning out new uniforms and trappings for man, woman and beast. Rich plush and gold bullion, rare Spanish lace, glittering jewels, lustrous white satin must be cut and sewed. Gay colored spangles must be made and attached in order that the whole ensemble may appear bright and new, a gala spectacle resplendent with dash and color.\n\nCircus day, to the men who have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested, it will be seen, means the culmination of long, careful and systematic preparation. To get ready for the day has been the work of many months and has employed the talents and attention of men who are wonderfully adept in their work. The advance staff of a major circus consists usually of a general agent, a railway contractor, an executive agent, several general contracting agents and assistants; Car No. 1, carrying about twenty persons; first advertising car. No. 2, bearing the chief press agent, car manager and from twenty to twenty-five men; car No. 3, with eighteen to twenty men; car No. 4, carrying a special press agent and car manager and from twelve to fifteen men, including \"route riders\" and special ticket agents; and finally the \"layer-out\" or \"twenty-four hour man\" who is only a day ahead of the circus.\n\nThe railroad contractor is the first man out. He must be conversant with railway time tables, know mileage and connections and familiarize himself with yard ficilities, tunnel clearances, bridges, et cetera. He plans in addition to the actual transortation of the show, special excursion rates and other tentative details. The general contracting agent follows. He makes arrangements for the feed, show-lot, as well as accommodations for advance men, bill-boards, water connections and other similar needs. The contracts negotiated by these two men often run into the thousands of dollars daily and must pass the rigid scrutiny of the experienced general agent to whom no phaze of the business is unfamiliar.\n\nSkirmish Cars\n\nCar No. 1, professionally known as the \"skirmish car\" is most fretuently called into the service of fighting opposition. As soon as a railway contractor for a rival circus puts in an appearance on the route the general manager is promptly notified. There is at once a formidable concentration of forces at the threatened point. No stone is left unturned or chance overlooked to gain the advantage. Billboards, barns, fences, trees, windows, and all other available space is bought with apparently reckless abandon. Banners printed on muslin are swung from awnings, wires, buildings. Often, more money than may be realized when the show hits town is spent in order to check further encroachment on the route.\n\nPublicity Great Problem\n\nAttached to a passenger train, about four weeks in advance of the show, is car No. 2. The general contracting press agent is aboard with advertising cuts and prepared \"copy\" for the newspapers, and while he contracts the press, a force of bill posters hang the town with multi-colored lithographs. Each team has a native driver who knows every road, every available barn, and every unhospitable dog. Permission is always secured from owners of buildings before \"paper\" is hung, for without permission the astute showman knows that a bill soon becomes a thing of shreds and tatters. In return for the privilege of posting a bill, an order for tickets is given, which is promptly honored if the agreement has been honestly kept.\n\nThe men on the two following cars, No. 3 and No. 4, see to it that the work of their predecessors is followed up carefully. Various neglected preliminary works is in their charge. They replace posters torn or down and endeavor to find new points of vantage where additional paper may be posted. They check up and report any discrepancy of the other advance men and forward a detailed report of their work and observations to the general agent.\n\nOn the day preceding the arrival of the show, the \"twenty-four hour man\" is on the ground. He inspects the lot, fixes the movement from train to grounds, lays out the parade route and performs a variety of other final duties.\n\nRoughly estimated, it appears reasonable that the several major circuses together with their smaller contemporaries will use during the average seven months tour a total of about 600 advance men outside the regular agents, contractors, inspectors, etc. This will require about 36 advertising cars, which in the course of a season will travel to every nook and corner of this vast continent. These men post upward of 170,000 sheets of paper daily and as their display averages about 30 days on the boards, it is safe to estimate that for each day's exhibition, 5,000,000 sheets of poster lithographs are in sight.\n\nToday the public is apt to judge the size of an organization largely by the amount of \"paper\" it posts. The trend therefore is to use more and more posters.\n\nOne large circus, during a single season, a few years ago, used a total of 77 kinds of lithographs varying in size from one to 60 sheets and let loose on the public a total of 12 publications, from four-page to 24 folio couriers. Their total editions represented nearly five and one-half million copies.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Tuesday, January 29, 1935]\n\nChapter III\n\nSuperstitions and Colloquialisms\n\nCircus folk are inherently superstitious. Omens and portents are a favorite hobby. Disease, death, disaster are usually presaged by signs according to the circus code. Many show people carry amulets or charms. A rabbit's foot, a four leaf clover or a horse shoe may ward off evil. To see three white horses in succession without catching sight of a red-headed woman is a favorable sign usually attended with good luck, while the breaking of a mirror may mean death, or seven years ill luck, or both. To put a hunchback on his hump brings you good fortune, but to see a cross-eyed man come on the lot forebodes some dark, ominous fate. A peacock's presence is fraught with promise but to hear the hoot of an owl at night is a sign of death. A bit of foam on a cup of coffee often indicates money and should be swallowed intact at once. But to open an umbrella in tent or building will precipitate showers of poverty. One only tempts fate to change undergarments that have accidentally been put on wrong side out before retiring at night, but a hat worn with the bow in front wards off danger. A corpse waiting at the station for a train on arrival of the show in the morning signifies that ill fortune has passed, but woe be unto you if the box be on the platform when the show departs at night. And should a mouse gnaw your clothing, take care, but if a black cat come to you, life holds promise of fortune and happiness.\n\nMany performers, it is said, invariably enter the ring with right foot forward, and should this little precaution be neglected, it is necessary to back out and re-enter in proper manner. Many circus people regard certain colors or combinations of colors a hoodoo. Most of them consider Friday an unlucky day, and if the thirteenth falls on Friday, misfortune stalks very near. The figure \"13\" is the pseudonym of misfortune.\n\nBut if their superstitions are ingrained, their language is just as truly impregnated. The slang and colloquialism form a secret tongue, a jargon, racy, pungent and pregnant of meaning. In order that the reader may better understand the succeeding chapters of this work, the more widely used and familiar terms are explained.\n\n\"Lot\" means the show grounds in the parlance of the circus. One might go through a season with a major show and never hear a tent referred to in any other way than a \"top.\" The big tent is always the \"big top,\" the cook tent is the \"cook top,\" the menagerie tent, the \"menagerie top,\" etc. The side-show is the \"kid's-show.\" Peformers, whether sitting in exhibition in the side-show, or featuring the super act in the \"big top\" are \"working.\" Thus, should one happen to hear the Bearded Lady, who does nothing more than pose before the probing eyes of the customers, say: \"I'm not working tomorrow\" it would mean she would not be sitting in her usual place in the \"kid-show\" the following afternoon.\n\n\"Stall\" used as a noun or verb, is a popular expression to indicate anything tending to conceal attention, a confederate who diverts attention, an accomplice under cover. For instance, \"I am stalling for a walk-away,\" if I refrain from notifying a customer that he has forgotten his change. \"Nix\" is circus for no, or a watchword to warn a confederate or accomplice that someone in authority is near. The circus in its entirety is always referred to as \"the show.\"\n\nA \"snack\" is a lunch, therefore a \"snack-stand\" is any place where a bite of food may be obtained. The men who sell peanuts, pop, lemonade, etc. are \"butchers.\" Peanuts are always \"red-hots.\" Lemonade is \"juice\" and water is \"plain juice.\" A \"heel\" is any rustic. \"Hey Rube\" is a clarion call, recognized by any showman as a danger signal. It originated in the old circus when fistic encounters between town rowdies and canvas men were common. The \"grand march,\" or inaugural by the entire ensemble at the opening of the performance is the show man's \"tournament.\" A ticket is always a \"fake\" while a reserved seat is a \"reserve\" and a general admission is a \"blue.\" The expression \"cremo\" means that you hold a \"blue\" ticket and is used between ushers. A \"grifter\" is a grafter while the term \"grafter-show\" indicates a show with dishonest motives. In circus dialect \"yap\" or \"hick\" is applied to any credulous person.\n\nA policeman in plain clothes is a \"dick,\" a trunk is a \"keester,\" a handbag is a \"turkey.\" Any man about the lot is a \"guy\" exccept the manager, who is known as the \"main guy.\" A nickel is a \"jit,\" a quarter is \"two bits,\" a dollar is a \"buck,\" a five-dollar bill is a \"fin.\" To \"fan a guy\" means to search him for concealed weapons. A pistol is a \"gat,\" a pocketbook is a \"leather\" a complimentary ticket is a \"brod\" while an elephant is always a \"bull.\"\n\nHuman eyes as spoken of in circus slang are \"lamps\" while the man who runs the electric lighting plant of the show is always the \"chandelier man\" and his lights, instead of being lamps are \"beacons.\" Circus posters or lithographs are \"paper\" and other printed pieces, including programs, etc., are \"soft stuff.\" Side show barkers are \"speelers\" clowns are \"kinkers.\" A lion or a tiger is a \"cat,\" sea-lions are always \"seals,\" camels, zebras, giraffes, etc. are \"lead stock\" and horses are known as \"pelters.\"\n\nCompared with the circus of another day the elevated standard among its men and women is a revelation. The new atmospher seems charged with health and happiness, virtue and vigor. Drunkenness is no longer tolerated. Immediate discharge, no matter what the rank of the offender is the penalty and except in rare instances among canvasmen (\"jigsies\") there is seldom provocation for punishment. Of other vices common in many walks of life, there is no evidence. The very nature of the life, with its claims on mind and body, forbids immoral or vicious excesses. Those who indulge in them are looked upon with coldness by their associates and made to find themselves delinquents. Gambling is strictly prohibited, and fines are imposed upon employees heard using profane or obscene language. The women of the circus are not permitted to converse with persons outside the show personnel and immediate discharge awaits the man who is caught talking with women, not members of the show. Every employee is charged with the duty of being polite and courteous not only to members of the show, but to everybody who visits it.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Wednesday, January 30, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nElephants\n\nOf all the animals that go to make up a menagerie, the elephant is in all probability the most familiar. His size, his structure, his close approach to intelligent understanding have come to make him a circus fundamental.\n\nOf all elephants that have featured in circus history, Jumbo has been most thoroughly publicized. An old time circus man who was close to P. T. Barnum during the days of his undisputed reign over the American circus, told the story of the big elephant's coming to this country.\n\n\"Jumbo,\" he said, \"was an African elephant that had been brought from the Congo to the London Zoo in the late Seventies. He was a good natured fellow, but very stupid. An agent of the Barnum show, hearing that Jumbo might be bought, began negotiations which ended with the purchase of the big fellow for two thousand pounds, (about $10,000.00) considered at the time a fabulous sum. But neither the agent nor Phineas T., had any idea of the money-making possibilities in sight, or the attraction prize which they were securing.\n\n\"The beast had been a pet with the children of the Zoo, and announcement of his purchase by an American was received by stolid Britishers with none too much favor. It required about two weeks to build a cage sufficiently large to accommodate the monster pachyderm on his voyage over-seas, and when keepers went to the zoo to lead Jumbo to the ship, they found him sullen and morose. He seemed to understand that something was wrong. He submitted to being led as far as the gate but would suffer himself to go no farther and lay down in the street. It was purely a case of elephantic obstinancy and the animal would not budge. There he measured his length in the dust for twenty-four hours despite all urging and entreaty, to the despair of the custodians, who little realized the wonderful effect the incident would have on the owner's pocketbook.\n\n\"English newspapers promptly seized upon the occurrance for a story. 'Dear old Jumbo,' they said, refused to leave the scene of happy days with the children, his exhibition of protest was one of remarkable sagacity; they hoped he would continue to defy the Yankee showmen and remain in London; he was the pet and friend of the little ones and ought never to be disposed of.\n\n\"The elephant when in repose or resistance rests on his knees and one British newspaper sagely remarked that 'Jumbo was in an attitude of prayer.' The Humane Society was appealed to and someone made a sympathetic hit by telling how lonesome and melancholy was Alice, Jumbo's abandoned wife. The pathos of the thing was very affecting on the surface, but it proved to be a phenomenal advertisement.\n\n\"The animal finally got on his feet and marched to the boat. Weeping women and children lined the route. The circus owners became aware of possibilities in publicity and adroitly concealing their identity, got out an injunction, 'in the interests of the London public,' attempting to restrain the brute's departure. Of course it was dissolved, but it kept feeling at a high pitch up to the time of sailing. The Baroness Burdett-Courts and a party of British notables visited the steamer to say good-bye and left a big box of buns, of which Jumbo was very fond, for his voyage to America.\n\n\"The story of the brute's reluctance to leave his English friends was judiciously broacast here and became the feature of the circus, whereas otherwise he would probably have attracted only passing attention. It was his own fortuitous conduct, and not the superior skill of the showman that made Jumbo's career on this side so profitable. The beast was killed in 1885 at Ft. Thomas, Ontario when on another occasion of his stubbornness, he refused to step off a railroad track and was crushed by the oncoming locomotive.\"\n\nThere have been other famous elephants, including Old Bolivar, of Adam Forepaugh fame, Sampson, the big fellow with the W. W. Cole show and Diamond of more recent years, who killed a girl on the street because he saw her with an old trainer for whom he had deep affection.\n\nBut there is no more thrilling tale of circus elephants than the story of a winter quarters battle between an elephant and a lion.\n\nIt took place several years ago but it still stands the most breath-taking epoch of the big tops.\n\nA mammouth black-maned Nubian got loose one night in the animal house, chased the keeper out of the building and proceeded to the elephant quarters. Singling out the largest \"bull\" of the herd, the big cat leaped his roaring challenge. The elephant stood nodding where he was chained to a stake near the door. The lion hesitated a moment, then lay back on his haunches. He crept slowly forward until he was within reach of the elephant. Then he raised his paw and struck at the supine trunk. The tough skin was somewhat torn and the elehant became instantly awake, and raising his trunk struck back at the lion. The latter escaped by jumping backward, then crouched again and prepared to spring. Quick as a flash, was the movement which landed him on the elephant's head. But he had to deal with a power greater than his own, over which his only advantage was his agility. The elephant easily shook him off, and tossed him some distance. The contest was then quickly decided. The lion prepared for another spring. With ears flattened against his head and eyes gleaming like balls of fire he crept stealthily forward, cautiously measuring the distance. With a suppressed growl, the lithe, tawny form shot throu the air. The elephant's trunk was curled back and his little black, shoe-button eyes were snapping viciously With a motion as quick as to be almost imperceptible, the huge proboscis was lowered and elevated twice and then descended with terrific force, striking the cat while he was yet in mid-air. The beast of prey fell stunned, and before he could recover the elephant dealt him a terrific blow in the side, and reaching forward the full length of his chain he drew the antagonist toward him. Then lifting his free foot he leaned his entire weight on the fallen foe. The effect was to crush the ribs of the conquered monarch of the veldt. In this manner he trampled the lion until life was extinct. Raising the grotesque form he tossed it contemptouusly to the other end of the room. Then trumpeting his paean of victory so that all might know his prowess, the great beast settled comfortably back to resume his nodding.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Friday, February 1, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWhite Elephants\n\nThe term \"white elephant,\" long associated with something akin to a \"bugaboo\" originated a few years previous to the turn of the century and was at that time identified wth probably the fiercest bit of circus rivalry of record. This campaign of exploitation began when a noted circus owner of that period announced the purchase of an albino \"bull\" from the erratic sovereign of Burma, King Theebaw.\n\nThe elephant was not white, but a leprous-looking shade of flesh color. It was really the first time one of these Albinos had ever been brought out of Asia. All that the king had done in the extravagant execution of his autocratic power was as nothing compared to the sale of the white elephant, and his subjects were furious. You see, the white elephant of Burma was looked upon in that day as a sort of sacred emblem. Priests were given to prostrating themselves when one passed by and all religious and ritualistic homage was paid to it. A noble of high rank was suffered to be the chamberlain to this most sacred of beasts, compared to which the Cats of Rubastes were but pagan contemporaries, scarcely worthy of a place in the princely retinue of such royal blood. Illness in the animal was significant of some eerie, ominous evil. Its very gestures afforded auguries, suspicious or sinister. For several years the white elephant was the greatest circus attraction under the big tops. Then something happened.\n\nA rival circus owner, nettled by the publicity and great ticket-wagon value of the Albino set about to meet his competition. A dispatch from Algiers quickly announced the purchase there of another white elephant for $10,000.00. Its entry into the country was attended by great secrecy. Before the original white elephant owner was aware, another was on exhibition. Charges of fraud resulted only in counter charges of deceit, trickery and swindle. Each circus claimed their elehant to be the only white pachyderm in America.\n\nIn order to create curiosity and keep it at the highest point the more recent \"importation\" was always swathed in bandages from the end of his trunk to the point of his tail and moved in a specially constructed car, so that no one might see him except by ticket in the menagerie tent. There, after the bandages were removed, a special religious ceremony was held before the animal by reputed Burmese priests, clad in robes of shimmering yellow, red and white silk. Occasionally some visitor might be heard to remark, unkindly, that the religious rites suddenly terminated as soon as the menagerie tent was emptied of visitors and resumed with alacrity when spectators approached. It was true that the elephant was nearer the color of freshly fallen snow on Monday than at the close of the week, but the owner very often sent the animal into the water where he would be rubbed and scoured, just to convince the more skeptical visitors that the beast's complexion had not; those who winked knowingly and muttered something about waterproof paint.\n\nAn international authority on zoology was persuaded to endorse the white elephant. His sponsorship so vexed the owners of the original Albino that crews of publicity agents were sent out on the show's route to denounce the beast as a fraud. But this seemed only to popularize him with the result that soon the \"white\" one was drawing greater crowds than was his Royal Highness from the Imperial Gardens of the great King Theebaw. Specimen supremacy was further tightened by the purchase of a white monkey as a companion of the elephant.\n\nIn Chicago, a representative of the King of Siam viewed the elephant, and after a cursory examination of the beast was heard to mutter something which apparently was uncomplimentary, but a wide-awake press agent who was present saw to it that the Siamese dignitary was quoted as saying the animal was the genuine article.\n\nAnd so the controversy continued until the Albino was killed in a fire, and with competition gone, public interest waned and the brush and snowy liquid were laid aside, while the mere mention of \"white elephant\" became known as a superlative; a thing devoid of value.\n\nThere are two distinct types of elephants, the Indian and the African. The former differs from the latter, not only in its greater size and in the characteristics of the skull and teeth, but also in the comparative small form of the ears, the pale brown color of the skin and in having four toes on the front feet and five on the hind feet, whereas the African has but four toes front and three rear. The intelligence of the Indian is greater, too, than that of the African, whose head is much shorter, the forehead more convex and the ears of much greater breadth and magnitude, covering nearly a sixth of the entire body. And while the Indian elehant slopes downward from withers to hind quarters, his African cousin's osseous structure is higher at hips than at shoulders.\n\nThe average life of the elephant is about 80 years and he does not possess his full power and vigor until after 30. An approximate idea of a brute's age may be determined, according to elephant men, by the turn-over of the upper edge of the ear. The edge is quite straight until the animal is eight or nine years old. At 30 the fringe has attained a length of an inch, and between 30 and 50 the droop grows another inch. At 80, it will quite likely be from two and one-half to three inches.\n\nExtravagant ideas are held as to the height of elephants. Best authorities claim that in India and Burma, the largest males seldom attain a height of more than 10 feet, while the tallest females do not exceed eight and one-half feet.\n\nJumbo, the largest African elephant ever to have been exhibited in the United States, was reported to have been 10 feet, four inches at the withers, or shoulder blades, but the body was not as heavy as the largest Indian elephants which often attain weights of three or four tons.\n\nThe carcass of an Indian elephant seven feet four inches high, weighed in portions, gave a total weight of 4,500 pounds. The skin averaged from three-quarters of an inch to one inch in thickness.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Monday, February 4, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nElephant Stampedes\n\nElephant stampedes are not uncommon. They have been going on ever since the big pachyderms have been collected into herds in America, but few persons who have never seen these \"bulls\" go jungle, know the fear and the anxiety they create; and too often the damage a herd on stampede may do.\n\nMany stories have been written - tales that bristle with excitement and romance and thrills, but no more vivid picture of the stampede has ever been outlined than the story of the elephant raid in the heart of the great Canadian Rockies . . . . in the country of the grizzly, the puma and the wolf. It is a tale of fear-filled days that stretched an eerie, malign spell across a period of weeks, a pall that clutched like some dense tendril of fog about the cabins of hardy mountaineers and stood in dark silhouette against the background of the eternal hills that were fringed with pine, like some awe-spreading umbrage, waiting, lurking, and ready to swallow them up. It was fear -- the fear of beasts gone native in a strange land -- beasts, against which inexperience could assuage no reasonable or permanent theory of safety or protection.\n\nThe date was the sixth of August, 1926 - a day well marked on the calendars around Cranbrook, British Columbia.\n\nThe Sells-Floto circus, under the management of Zack Terrell, moved from Calgary on the night of the fifth, skirted the shores of beautiful Lake Louise, and stopped at Cranbrook about 5 o'clock on the morning of the sixth. The high, dry air was tangy and redolent of pine. Man and beast sensed the call of the wild. It was like some gnawing, burning flame that lapped against the foundation of the soul, trying to ignite it with the fire of freedom and to burn from around it the bulwark of restraint.\n\nMen fought it. Animals quickened to its urge. And when the elephant car was opened and the fourteen \"bulls\" were taken out, twelve of them, headed by old Myrtle, broke away from their keepers and headed for the hills.\n\nFlower gardens, fences, fruit trees, small buildings, all fell before the frenzied rush of the beasts. A waging mass of trunks thrown high in the air seemed to accentuate the trumpeting rhythm, while high above, a \"V\" of honking wild geese drifted lazily northward, their shrill cries drowned by the weird shrilling challenge of the herd.\n\nEvery available man was pressed into service, and during the following week, all but three of the brutes had been rounded up and returned to the elephant car, which had been held at Cranbrook, while the show proceeded on its route sans \"bulls.\"\n\nBut the forest and great mountain fastness had seemingly opened and swallowed Myrtle, Tillie and Charlie Ed. Rumors of their presence came filtering in from mountain cabins here and there. A band of Indians were engaged to trail the beasts. Traps were set and every means known were pressed into use in an effort to capture them. On August 16th, ten days after the stampede, Tillie fell into a trap and was returned to Cranbrook and shipped to the show, then at Eugene, Oregon.\n\nPneumonia Claims Myrtle\n\nIt was not until the 9th of September, or thirty-three days after she led the herd into the hills that Myrtle was heare from, some thirteen miles away. A party was immediately formed and set out to effect her capture. All day long the chase continued, but Myrtle could not be taken. As a result, the big elephant contracted pneumonia and several days later her carcass was found.\n\nAs the searching party approached the prostrate hulk of the old leader, three grizzly bears were heard to grunt in alarm and scamper off into the woods. The elephant's head and one leg were brought back to Cranbrook and later presented to the University of Alberta at Edmonton. A year later a party from the University returned to the scene of Myrtle's demise, but found nothing. Grizzly bears, wolves and mountain lions had been there before them.\n\nCharlie Ed, the last of the trio to face capture, was located near Smith Lake, B.C., in mid-summer and after a lengthy chase was finally trapped and captured. He was returned to the herd with the show at San Francisco after nearly six weeks of freedom.\n\nWith the capture of Charley Ed the \"rumor mill\" of British Columbia ceased operation. Weird tales of attacks on isolated cabins, damage to fruit trees and vegetables, fences and barns and even houses; fantastic stories of strange trysts and behemoth love; of feminine hatred brought into the open by Myrtle and Tillie for the favor of Charlie Ed, and last but by no means least, complaints for damages to property, genuine and fancied, true and fictitious, passed into the limbo of the forgotten, but not until expense that ran well into the thousands of dollars had been paid.\n\nFrom out of this stampede with its terrors, its weeks of anxiety for both showmen and residents of the Cranbrook vicinity, and its aftermath of damage claims, there came also undisputable proof of elephantic memory.\n\nSustains Repurtation\n\nCharlie Ed, relieved of those irksome periods of performance and permitted to spend halcyon days of freedom and idleness in the Canadian wastes, returned to the show, took his place in the elephant act on the following day and did his stunts with the same ease and precision that had marked his performance under daily rehearsals, thus bearing out the age-old contention of trainers, that an elephant never forgets - that he will return to an act after long periods of time have elapsed, and that he will perform his stunt with the same ease with which he had originally mastered it.\n\nAnd although records do not mention a return of the stampede fever among the elephants which so tragically transformed a peaceful little western town into a quagmire of excitement, old elephant men wag their heads and give vent to a cryptic thought that seems always to remind one of the story of the man who slipped an elephant a piece of tobacco in a bag of peanuts, or to recall the prime requisite of all good elephants lore - \"he never forgets.\" And that might seem to fit either peanuts or stampedes.\n\nNote: In relating the account of the Cranbrook stampede, officials of The Sells-Floto Circus were profuse in their praise for the superior work done by Allen King, noted lion trainer, for assistance rendered during those trying weeks.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Wednesday, February 6, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nBaby Elephants\n\nWhile several baby elephants have been born in captivity since the coming of the big pachyderms to America, the dream of circus owners to successfully propigate the species has been an ambition fraught with many disappointments.\n\nPrior to the year 1880, all efforts to induce elephants to bear young in ths country were unavailing, but on March 10th of that year the arrival of the first baby, later to be known as \"Little Columbia,\" proved an eopch in the realm of the circus, as well as a box office feature for the Bailey show during the years immediately following.\n\nThe event attracted a great deal of interest among scientists and students of natural history. From the time the circus went into winter quarters at Philadelphia some four months preceding the birth of the baby, several of the most distinguished physicians in the city regularly visited the prospective mother, and the diet and conduct of the animal, whose name was Hebe, were studied with great care. Crowds of people flocked to see the baby. Its birth disproved a great many theories which scientific men had accepted as facts of zoology since the days of Pliny. The chief of these were that the period of gestation is really twenty months and twenty days, instead of from twenty-two to twenty-three months as had previously been attributed, and that the young does not suckle the mother through the trunk, but through the mouth.\n\nCaptivity No Impediment\n\nLittle Columbia weighed one hundred and twenty-six pounds at birth, was thirty inches high and measured thirty-five inches from the tip of her tiny seven-inch trunk to the crupper. She was of a pale mauve color, quite strong and active; a perfect specimen. A glimpse into her history reveals that being born in captivity was no impediment to growth, for she is still alive and one of the largest female elephants in America.\n\nNo more interesting chapter in animal propigation has ever been written than that of the herd's devotion to Hebe during the season preceding the arrival of the baby.\n\n\"The other elephants, about twenty-five of them, seemed to understand Hebe's condition,\" said her trainer. \"They extended to her every kind of elephantic courtesy. During an act in which she performed with nine others, a pedestal upon which she was standing gave way. Hebe wavered uncertainly in an effort to avoid falling. The trainer, watching the others, suddenly observed confusion. Vainly he shouted at the \"bulls\" but they paid no attention, instead, they wheeled, rushing madly toward the tottering Hebe. And just as the big stool collapsed beneath her, two of them reached her, one standing on each side. Allowing their great bodies to act as cushions, they permitted her to slide gently to the ground. The crowd watched them return to their act, little knowing the cause of this unprecedented action.\"\n\n$52,000 Insurance on Baby\n\nThe second baby elephant arrived at the Barnum winter quarters in Bridgeport, Conn., on February 2nd, 1882. The mother, whose name was Queen, was a fifteen year old animal. This baby, whose life was protected by an insurance policy of fifty-two thousand dollars, was considered the most valuable infant animal ever known. Mr. Barnum was often quoted as saying that three hundred thousand dollars would be no temptation to dispose of the baby, and later events proved the wisdom of his appraisal. The youngster, which was shown with old Jumbo, and about which many tales were written, setting forth the big fellow's affection for the infant, drew throngs of the curious, the revenues therefrom exceeding many times the fabulous sum set by the astute P. T.\n\nThe Barnum baby weighed forty-five pounds at birth. It was two feet six inches high and three feet long, exclusive of its miniature trunk, which was about five inches in length. It was perfect in form, of a bluiish color and covered with coarse black hair about one inch long.\n\nLike little Columbia, the Barnum baby is still alive, according to reports, and with some twenty-five years of life's expectancy before it, has many circus seasons ahead.\n\nAbout the time of the arrival of the two first baby elephants in captivity, a woman, Mrs. William Newman, wife of the famous \"Elephant Bill,\" broke into fame as the first woman trainer of the leviathans of the animal kingdom.\n\nShe was a matronly looking person, quite stout, and pleasant mannered, devoid withal of the masculine traits that her occupation might seem to require, at her command the elephants, eight in number, marched, wheeled, countermarched, halted promptly and \"grounded arms\" by lying on their sides. Then like schoolboys, delighted at a release from what they deemed duty, the huge beasts broke ranks and assumed different postures and occupations about the ring. One of them stood on his head, another turned a grindstone with his trunk, a third walked on a revolving barrel, and several others respectively engaged, to their own apparent amusement, in dancing on a pedestal, ringing a bell and \"clapping hands.\"\n\nPerrformances Improve\n\nIn later years, all of these stunts have been duplicated many times. Indeed, the past decade has witnessed many, and certainly better performances, but not since the days of Mrs. Newman, has the circus known a woman who could so successfully train and handle a group of elephants.\n\nOne of the most amusing of all elephant acts was the boxing stunt between a big \"bull\" named \"John L. Sullivan\" and his trainer, a husky negro known as \"Eph\" Thompson.\n\nThe son of Ham had a splendid idea, but quite obviously failed to visualize the results. Throughout the winter, he laced a boxing glove on the brute's trunk, and together they went through the various phases of sparring, shadow boxing and other gymnastic requisites. And as \"John L.\" became accustomed to this new form of elephantic diversion, he grew exceedingly adept and seemed to enjoy it. By the time for dress rehearsals, just before the show took the road, he was in full possession of the much touted \"haymaker\" which he appeared wont to use on the region of \"Eph's\" head, face and chin.\n\nBy the time of the opening performance, \"John L.\" had watched the clown referee count ten over the prostrate form of the pugilistic \"Eph\" with a regularity that would have aroused the envy of his famous namesake, and it was only by dire threats that the management, who had billed the act as a feature, were able to persuade the pugnacious negro to appear before an audience.\n\nThings went along smoothly for a week; \"Eph\" by adroit feints managed to stay clear of the devastating hooks and jabs, but on the afternoon of the eighth performance, \"John L.\" apparently tiring of stalling, suddenly reached out and wrapping his trunk about the Negro's neck, pulled the man toward him and before \"Eph\" could step clear, swing a hefty blow to the side of his head. The man crumpled and fell and as trainers rushed in, the brute reached down, picked up the prone form and tossed it clear of the ring.\n\nThus was the ring career of \"Eph\" Thompson, \"the only living man capable of withstanding the terrific blows of the world's only prize-fighting pachyderm\" ended.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Friday, February 8, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Menagerie Tent\n\nInto the menagerie tent, with its great variety of animals caged and unconfined, streams the open-mouthed human parade, stopping to observe and comment on its way to the \"big top.\"\n\nThe lions and tigers pace back and forth in their gilded dens with hungry eyes that gleam in green and gold. Steadily, they stare through the steel bars but take no heed of the pigmy humans who stare back. There is something in those gleaming eyes that tells of thoughts far from the sawdust and tinsel of the circus; something that harkens of the call of jungle and bush. The insatiable elephant swings his greedy trunk tirelessly, and the black leopard slinks back to the shadows of the darkened corner of his cage, his jaundiced eyes half-closed as if in mute protest at looking into the endless stream of the inquisitive and the gullible.\n\nAnd watching the scene in all its aspects, is a jovial, deep-voiced man who urges the immediate necessty of securing advantageous seats under the adjoining canvas. He controls the peanut (red-hots) and lemonade (juice) privilege. Long experience has taught him all the arts and devices of his business. He appreciates that his sales will not begin in any volume until the audience is comfortably seated. Then he displays his commercial craftiness by overwheling the big area with peanuts and popcorn \"butchers.\" No lemonade is yet in evidence. Thirst comes on apace. Throats that are salty soon become dry. And circus lemonade has always been noted for the brazen misnomer it bears A river of it could be made from a dozen citrus fruits. But when its assauging presence is seen in the trays of a corps of hawkers, one is apt to forget the flavor and buy -- if for no other reason than to keep one's feet safe from the trampling that seems imminent with each succeeding vendor.\n\nAnd should a rain come up, our friend the catering manager is ready with umbrellas, and again we hear the cries of hawker hounds. He is ready for any meteoroligal change and usually finds a way to keep his agents fore until time to announce the \"concert.\"\n\nMonkey Business\n\nThe monkey cage is usually the most popular institution in the menagerie tent. We have outgrown the \"variety cage\" of olden days, which was a collection of one den of monkeys, pigs, cats, dogs and rabbits. It was an interesting collection, no doubt to rural folks, but an insufferable nuisance to the showman. Circus monkeys die rapidly. The show which starts the season with a large number of them seldom returns from a season en tour with all that it started out with. Climatic changes act with quick fatality upon these sensitive creatures.\n\nThere is always a \"bully\" in the monkey cage and the privileges of the \"bully\" are most alluring. He takes for himself the choicest bits of food, chooses the most comfortable perch or corner, gives orders and demands instant obedience, and cuffs and bites and annoys his cage mates until one of them, driven desperate, turns and administers Mr. \"Bully\" a sound thrashing, after which the emoluments of the vanquished become the special privileges of the victor and the bully monkey business is resumed under new leadership.\n\nA Proven Barometer\n\nThe monkey cage at nightfall is a sure indication of the generosity or parsimoniousness, as the case may be, of the community. In some towns they are gorged with succulent tid-bits; the audience has fed them lavishly. Again, they give pleading indication of hunger, a sure sign of penuriousness in that locality and generally reflected in the receipts of the day.\n\nHippo The Pet\n\nThe hippopotamus, sleeping or floundering in his tank, and raising his head at intervals for the purpose of respiration, is never without a wondering audience. His is a harmless disposition and he is always a pet with the animal keepers. His den is usually too small to permit him to get his huge body under water and it is necessary at stated intervals to wash him as a protection against disease. He revels in this operation and makes no protest against the use of soap and scrub-brush. Contrary to general belief, his skin is the thickest of all animals, usually from two to three inches.\n\nRhinos Die Early\n\nEvery menagerie attendant is asked why the show has no rhinoceros. This animal has always been a problem to keepers, for captivity generally results in early death. He is a beast so essentially of the wilds that all efforts at breeding in captivity have failed. All experienced showmen recall an attempt to take performing liberties with one of these spike-nosed monsters during an engagement in a small Illinois city. He killed two men, upset four dens of animals, tore down a museum tent, stampeded people for blocks and finally brought up in a vacant house, the door of which had been left ajarl. Few, if any attempts to exhibit the rhino since that episode have been made. But the principal reason that they are so seldom seen in the menagerie is because of the scarcity of the animals, the difficulties encountered in capturing them and the excessive cost, which in view of their short life in captivity, makes an unprofitable risk.\n\nElephants Vs. Electricity\n\nThe showman is often asked whether or not an elephant's skin is really a non-conductor of electricity. Tests prove that elephants appear to be immune from the effects of the current, but that does not definitely answer the question. It may be that the skin does not allow the voltage to pierce it, but that is wholly problematical. The following incidents are related. Your guess is as good as any.\n\nIn tests conducted by electrical engineers, heavy currents have been used, currents to which other animals were seen to writhe in pain, but which seemed only to titillate the big pachyderms, and with no harmful effects. Indeed the beasts acted as if they thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIn 1901, an African elephant then quartered at the Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo, N.Y., suddenly developed man-killing tendencies, and as is customary, he was doomed to die.\n\nTaken to a spot close to the great Tower of Electricity, he was heavily chained. 0Electrodes were placed against the top of his head and to each of his four feet, then the full current of those gigantic Niagara generators was turned into the body.\n\nA gaping throng stood motionless as the chief electrcian held up his hand and an assistant turned the switch. The electrocution of a murderous elephant was a sight never before offered the curious and the modest. The crowd held its breath while the ammeter registered twenty-two hundred folts and the big African, apparently bored under the silence blinked his little eyes as unconcerned as though Niagara with all its power was only a myth.\n\nTwo weeks later, he was to face a firing squad and died with a bullet in his vitals.\n\n[The News-Sentinel, Tuesday, February 12, 1935]\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMenagerie Highlights\n\nIn the preceding chapter we spoke of the hippopotamus as a pet of the animal handlers; of his harmless disposition and the thickness of his skin; and of his never-failing prerogative to attract a crowd wherever he is shown.\n\nAnd here, we shall discuss a few of the highlights of his career in captivity.\n\nThe \"hip\" by which sobriquette he is called by the circus-minded, came to America at about the time the gun at Ft. Sumpter was heard around the world. Phineas T. Barnum, then the owner of a museum in New York City imported the beast from the upper-reaches of the Nile, and with that ingenius and astute foresight which made him dean of the American circus, advertised the animal as \"the great, behemoth of the Scriptures.\" So extensive was this campaign of publicity and so subtle the modus operandi of exhibiting the beast, that thousands of people rushed to see him. Indeed, it is said that among the thousands of visitors were many biblical students who were prone to accept the beast in the light of Barnum's claim.\n\nThe Hippopotamus' skin is of a dark, reddish-brown color, full of cracks and cross-etchings, with dapplings of irregular dark spots. In maturity he is more than ten feet long and nearly six feet high. When he gives voice, the lions are humiliated and the tigers acknowledge defeat. It is a deafening kind of roar, between that of a bull and the bray of an elephant. His daily diet consists of several bushels of potatoes, apples, carrots, oats, bran, hay and salt. It is said that the daily ration for this beast is equal to the combined sustenance of four horses, two cows and a hog.\n\nKeepers assert that the only hippopotamus ever born in captivity arrived in a zoo in one of the larger cities. Ignorance caused the loss of the first. Keepers, believing the little one might drown if allowed to be left in the water, kept it high and dry and attempted to nurse it with a bottle. It died in ten days after birth. Then it was decided not to interfere when the second mother brought forth young and it was then discovered that the baby hippo nursed beneath the surface of the water.\n\nGiraffs Frail\n\nCircus people are said to regard the giraffe as the bearer of good fortune and claim that if one is fortunate enough to have the \"gentleman\" with the elongated neck rub one's hand with its tongue fortune is sure to follow.\n\nBut that privilege is rarely accorded for the reason that circus management frowns upon it. Giraffes are very costly and much care is needed to help them weather the trials of the road. A quarter of a century ago, few if any were seen with traveling circuses. The low, small railway cars of that day were wholly inadequate to care for their great height, but in more recent years, larger equipment and a more profound knowledge of the animals, make possible their transport, and few major circuses are without these beautiful beasts.\n\nContrary to the usual, the giraffe has no vocal cords and for that reason is unable to make a sound. With his long neck, he is equipped in natural habitats, to reach the higher limbs of trees and pluck the tenderest shoots and sprouts. For that reason he is very choicey about his fare and quite often goes on hunger strike rather than munch hay that is not just up to his standard of quality and tenderness.\n\nThe first baby giraffe born in captivity, arrived in the Autumn of 1880. He was five feet high, while his mother stood eighteen feet tall. Since that date, many others have been propigated in this country. Unlike most other animals, the giraffe is not subject to either trainig or labor. His value, therefore, consists only in his presence.\n\nCamels\n\nOf course, no menagerie would be complete without the camel, for no portrayal of a chapter from Arabian Nights would be complete without the beast most common to that enchanted realm.\n\nEvery circus boasts several \"camels\" whether they be camels or domedaries; in the parlance of the big top, they rate only one name. They are, of course, closely related in species except that the dromedary has but one hump, while the camel boasts two. Their chief value to the circus is their appearance in the parade, mounted by dusky, \"burned-cork\" Arabs.\n\nFast Day\n\nSunday is \"Fast Day\" in the menagerie tent while the circus is on the road. While men and women usually enjoy something a little out of the ordinary on the day of rest, the animals must get along on \"bread and water\" (from which the bread has been withheld).\n\n\"Unjust,\" you say?\n\nIt appears that way on the surface, but of course there is a reason. Animals in their wild state are frequently forced to go without food for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and so, trainers have learned that animals are healthier when forced to do without feeding one day in seven.\n\nIn this program, one is surprised to note that with approach of the feeding hour - 6 o'clock in the afternoon - animals that pace their dens nervously for six days a week, waiting for the raiton of liver and beef, calmly watch the time slip by on Sunday evening without so much as a move. They learn this schedule with almost unbelievable certainty and accept it without a murmur.\n\nAnd as a result, there is very little sickness among the menagerie's occupants. Of course they are watched closely and given assidious attention if the slightest indisposition is manifested, but the experienced trainer lays more faith in his theory of \"fast-day\" than to anythng else.\n\nThe Storehouse\n\nTo all intent and purpose, the menagerie tent is the storehouse of the show. From it comes \"the den of pythons\" for the snake-charmer in the side-show; the lions and tigers, pumas, bears, hyenas and leopards for the big animal acts, the monkeys and dogs for the animal ride numbers and the elephants for the ring acts. Only the horses have separate quarters.\n\n'The News-Sentinel, Monday, February 18, 1935]\n\nSAWYER MOTOR SALES [Rochester, Indiana]\n\nSee: Louderback Garage\n\n__________\n\n[Adv] Used Cars, lowest prices in town. - - - - SAWYER MOTOR SALES, Dodge-Plymouth direct Factory Dealer.

He is the seventh son of Conrad and Elizabeth Sayger, natives of Virginia. This couple were blessed with seven sons and five daughters, all but one of whom are yet living. Moses attended the common schools, receiving but a limited education, remaining at home and assisting in the farm labor until he reached his majority. March 2, 1837, he was united in marriage to Miss Polly Shewan, a native of Virginia, born in 1820. Mr. Sayger came to Indiana in the fall of 1849, and located in Miami County, where he remained seven years. In the spring of 1857, he removed to Fulton County, locating where he now resides in Henry Township. His farm contains 160 acres of choice land well cultivated, and on which he has built a pleasant and commodious brick residence, and a convenient barn and the necessary outbuildings. Mr. S. received no inheritance, and his success is due to his own industry and foresight as a business man. He is a Deacon in the German Baptist Church at Beaver Dam, of which a part of his family are members. The union of Mr. and Mrs. Sayger has been blessed with eight children--Cynthia, Mary Ann, Jacob, Virginia, Levina, Catharine, Peter and Vallandigham, all of whom are married but the youngest.\n\n[T. B. Helm, Fulton County Atlas, A. L. Kingman, 1883, p. 40]\n\nSCAAR-BAUMEL COMPANY [Rochester, Indiana]\n\nTUBE FACTORY MAY OCCUPY THE FORMER GAUGE VALVE PLANT\n\nOne of the best possibilities yet offered in the city for a going concern to take over the Gauge Valve Factory location became known here Tuesday when W. B. Kilgore, of Chicago, visited the city and went over the local plant with William Biddinger, receiver.\n\nMr. Kilgore is president of the Scaar-Baumel Company of 1274 West North Ave., Chicago, which is incorporated for $20,000. His organization has outgrown its present building and he is looking for a new location outside of Chicago where it can expand and at the same time be freed from labor troubles.\n\nHe asks that the building and site of the Gauge Valve factory be taken over by local men and that when the pay roll has reached a justifiable total showing that considerable more than the purchase price has been turned back into the town that all of the site be deeded over to the company. It will be remembered that the property is now up for sale by the receiver.\n\nMr. Kilgore states that his factory makes tubing of various kinds for refrigerators and for cold storage plants and that present orders necessitate an immediate expansion. He says that it would be necessary for the company to build an additional building here alongside the present plant at once as the tubes are first made in 60 foot lengths and while extended must be turned around inside the building. The company would build the new structure itself, he stated.\n\nThe Scaar-Baumel Company stock is owned by three individuals. The two others besides Mr. Kilgore, are young men who have active managership of the plant and they would come here at once. The organization would employ 25 men at once and gradually increase this number to 60.\n\nThe manufacturer assured local business men that the organization was a closed corporation and that no stock would be offered for sale. He invited investigators to inspect his plant and books at Chicago and altogether made a very favorable impression. He learned of the local factory site through J. B. Bartholomew, of Chicago, who was formerly with the Rochester Bridge Company.\n\nO. R. Carlson, president of the Young Men's Business Association, went into the details of the proposition with Mr. Kilgore and Tuesday night held a conference with Mayor King, Mr. Biddinger, and several business men and was practically assured that sufficient money would be raised in the city to buy the plant and hold it in escrow. Definite action will be taken by the Y.M.B.A. some time this week.\n\n[Rochester Sentinel, Wednesday, May 2, 1923]\n\nFINAL DRIVE FOR BRINGING FACTORY HERE TO BE MADE\n\nFinal plans for the bringing of the Scaar-Baumel Company of Chicago here to occupy the Gauge Valve building in East Rochester were worked out at an open meeting of the Young Men's Business Association Tuesday evening, when W. B. Kilgore, president of the concern, appeared before the organization.\n\nThere was about 30 members and business men present when Mr. Kilgore explained that he desired to bring his refrigerator tube plant to Rochester where it could expand without great additional cost and where the labor troubles such as exist in Chicago could be avoided. He stated that he would be willing to come here the moment that he is informed the factory and site has been purchased by the Rochester citizens and will be turned over to his corporation to use. He said if a duplicate of the Warren Glove Factory agreement, which worked out so satisfactorily, was drawn up he would sign that. This provides that he would be given the use of the factory site free of charge until the payroll amounted to the required figures when it was to be deeded over to him.\n\nMr. Kilgore went on to explain that he had already entered into negotiations with the Rochester Bridge Company with regard to purchasing their lots adjacent to the Gauge Valve property and that he would start the erection of another building there. He would also remove the posts from the Gauge Valve structure so that 60 foot length tubing could be handled in the one large room. The new plant would be built of steel and concrete block and would be 120 by 80 feet.
