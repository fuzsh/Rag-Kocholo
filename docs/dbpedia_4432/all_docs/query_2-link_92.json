        "text": "STEPHEN A. KELLY - At the time of his death Stephen A. Kelly was connected with the coach and car department of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company at Centerville. He was always a resident of the middle west and possessed the enterprising spirit which has been the dominant feature in the development and upbuilding of the upper Mississippi valley. He was born in Hancock county, Illinois, August 30, 1843, and is a son of John and Margaret (Boyd) Kelly, who were natives of Ireland and of Pennsylvania respectively. On crossing the Atlantic to the new world, attracted by the broader business opportunities which he believed might be secured on this side of the Atlantic, the father made his way to the interior of the country, settling in Hancock county, Illinois, in the '30s. There he entered land from the government and at once began to turn the sod and prepare the tract for cultivation. Throughout his remaining days he carried on farm work there, his life's labors being ended in death in 1862, when fifty-five years of age.\n\nThe youthful days of Stephen A. Kelly were passed in Illinois and his education was acquired in the district schools. He lived upon the home farm, early becoming familiar with the duties and labors incident to its development and cultivation. After his parents died he purchased the interests of the other heirs in the property and continued the cultivation of the fields until November, 1889, when he sold his interests in Illinois and came to Centerville, Iowa. Here he entered the employ of what is now the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company, in connection with the car and coach department, and thus continued throughout his remaining days or for a period of twenty years. His long continuance with the company well indicates his efficient workmanship and his fidelity to the interests of those whom he represented. He died in May, 1908, after a short illness, leaving behind him many warm friends.\n\nIt was in October, 1875, that Mr. Kelly was united in marriage to Miss Amanda M. Riggs, a daughter of William and Amelia Riggs, who were natives of West Virginia. Her father was a farmer by occupation and upon his removal to Illinois in 1855 purchased a tract of land in Hancock county, which he cultivated and improved until he was called to his final rest, passing away in January, 1883. His wife survived him until November, 1900.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Kelly became the parents of three children: Chloe, who is the wife of Dr. W. B. Miller, of Centerville; Jennie M., who is the wife of John B. McNeal, superintendent of the Egypt Coal Company of Mystic, Iowa; and Frank L., who is employed as an engineer on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. Mrs. Kelly holds membership with the Methodist church but her husband was a member of the Catholic church. In politics he was a democrat but did not seek nor desire office, for other duties and interests always claimed his time and attention. He did not seek to figure prominently in any public connection but those who knew him recognized his genuine worth and entertained for him warm regard.\n\nJOSEPH N. KERSCHNER, who has owned and operated a grocery store in Centerville since 1908, is numbered among the diligent and enterprising young business men of the community. He was born in Clarinda, Page county, Iowa, on the 4th of August, 1877, his parents being William A. and Catherine (Barnthouse) Kerschner. The father, who was of German lineage, was born in Montpelier, Indiana, on October 15, 1830, and there he was likewise reared and educated and subsequently learned the cabinetmaker's trade. The mother, who is of French extraction, is a native of Ohio, her birth having occurred in Tuscarawas county on the 25th of June, 1836. When a girl of about fifteen years she removed with her parents to Indiana, where she was later married. In the early '50s Mr. and Mrs. Kerschner came to Iowa, settling in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Appanoose county, where the father purchased forty acres of coal land. After operating his mines for several years he disposed of his holding and removed with his family to Cass county, Nebraska. There he purchased a well improved farm of a hundred and twenty acres and turned his attention to agricultural pursuits, which he followed for ten years. He next removed to Lincoln, that state, and resumed his trade, residing in the latter city until 1894. On August 1, of that year, accompanied by his wife and family, he went to Fitzgerald, Florida, making the journey, a distance of thffee thousand miles, in a covered wagon. They reached their destination in the month of December and there passed the winter. The next spring they returned to Iowa, but after a brief sojourn here, the father again started westward, Portland, Oregon, being his next place of residence. There he passed away in 1902. The mother, however, is living and continues to reside in Portland, making her home with her children.\n\nThe early years of Joseph N. Kerschner were passed in the parental home. In the acquirement of an education he attended the public schools in the various places where the family resided, completing his course of study in the high school of Lincoln, Nebraska, from which institution he was graduated with the class of 1894. He went south with the family that fall, returning to Iowa with them in the spring of 1895, and here he has ever since made his home. When he came back to Centerville he obtained a clerkship in the store of Drake & Lane, continuing to work for them and various other grocers in the city until 1908. He applied himself earnestly to a thorough mastery of the business and as he was industrious and thrifty during that time he also managed to accumulate a small capital. It was his ambition to have an establishment of his own, his desire in this direction being realized four years ago when he purchased the grocery stock of Isaac Brooks. As he carries a good line of staple and fancy groceries, which he offers at reasonable prices, he has succeeded in building up a trade that gives him every reason to feel assured of a constantly increasing business. He is gracious and accommodating in his treatment of patrons and in the conduct of his store has adopted a policy that commends him to the confidence of those with whom he has transactions, all of which qualities are uniting in winning well deserved success.\n\nIn 1898, Mr. Kerschner was married to Miss Clara Vought, a daughter of Larkin and Malissa Vought, the father a native of Indiana and the mother of Virginia, whence she came to Iowa with her parents when a child. They were married in Keosauqua, this state, and very soon thereafter located on a farm near Udell, where the father still resides with his son George. The mother passed away in 1912. Mrs. Kerschner was born in Udell in 1878, and was reared, educated and married in this county. Of this marriage there have been born two children: Mabel, whose birth occurred in September, 1900; and Marion, who was born in January, 1902.\n\nThe parents manifest their religious faith through their connection with the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Kerschner is a member of the blue lodge and chapter of the Masonic order, and he also belongs to the Royal Arcanum and the Modern Woodmen of America, being clerk of the local camp of the last named organization. Politically he supports the republican party and is a member of the school board. Mr. Kerschner is a young man of earnest purpose, upright principles and reliable methods, all of which qualities he daily manifests in the conduct of his business. Such success as has come to him is well deserved and has been won through his individual efforts, as he has made his own way in the world since he was a youth and merits much commendation for the excellent use he has made of his opportunities.\n\nTHOMAS WESLEY KILLION - Journalism finds a worthy representative in Thomas Wesley Killion, owner and publisher of the Centerville Weekly Sun. He was born in Orleans, Appanoose county, Iowa, July 7, 1860, a son of Thomas Jefferson Killion, who was engaged in general merchandising at Orleans at the time of the birth of his son Thomas. He also held the position of justice of the peace there and was prominent in democratic circles before the war, being regarded as a local oracle in political connections. He married Jeannette Ann Killion, a most consistent Christian woman.\n\nIn early life Thomas Wesley Killion took up the occupation of farming which he followed continuously until thirty-five years of age. His connection with journalism began on the 1st of March, 1898, when he established the Semi-Weekly Sun at Moulton, continuing its publication at that place until February, 1911, when the plant was removed to Centerville, where the paper is still published as a weekly. He likewise established the Centerville Weekly Sun on the 14th of February, 1912, and has succeeded in building up a large circulation as well as developing a good job printing business. His office is well equipped with everything necessary for turning out high-class job printing as well as for the publication of a paper. To these lines Mr. Killion gives his entire attention with the result that his patrons receive a most readable journal, attractive from the standpoint of the printer's art as well as a medium of general and local news.\n\nOn the 2d of April, 1885, at Centerville, Iowa, Mr. Killion was married to Miss Sarah F. Clark, a daughter of William A. Clark, in whose honor the Grand Army post at Moulton was named. Her father was a veteran of the Civil war and also a noted Methodist minister. For several years prior to her marriage the daughter was successfully engaged in teaching in Appanoose county. To Mr. and Mrs. Killion have been born four children : Carl G., who married Miss Myrtle Benson, of Albia, Iowa; E. Floyd, who married Miss Minnie Ward, of Centerville Iowa; Paul E., a graduate of the Moulton high school of the class of 1912; and Pearl E., a freshman in the high school.\n\nMr. Killion voted with the democratic party and is recognized as one of its prominent local leaders. He was chairman of the Appanoose county democratic central committee for three years, during which time capable management succeeded in drawing out and increasing the vote of that party largely. In 1908 he was named for county recorder and ran far ahead of the regular party vote. He held the office of justice of the peace for three years, beginning in 1887. He was appointed postmaster at Moulton, Iowa, by President Cleveland, and took possession of the office December 1, 1893, holding it until February 5, 1898. He stands strongly in support of all he believes to be right and is a worthy representative of other organizations outside of political ranks. He became a charter member of Moulton Camp, M. W. A., and on its organization in April, 1896, was elected to the office of worthy advisor, so serving for two terms. He was afterward chosen venerable consul and held that office for three consecutive years. He was elected excellent banker and so served during the year 1910. In 1900 he became a member of the Brotherhood of American Yeomen, joining the order at Moulton and filling the office of correspondent for five years and that of master of ceremonies for one year. He helped to organize the order in Centerville and is now its honorable foreman. He has been a delegate to all its state conclaves and to two of its supreme conclaves, the last one being held in Minneapolis in 1909. Christian principles have also long formed a guiding spirit in his life. When sixteen years of age he became a member of the Christian church and held the office of church deacon during the years 1909-10. Good business qualifications with a talent for making a newspaper have made him a successful journalist and publisher, and a keen interest in the welfare of his country has led him to become a stanch champion of party principles which he deems essential to the welfare of state and country. He lives up to a high standard of ethical teaching as found in the tenets of the fraternities with which he is connected and he has been a cooperant factor in that labor which seeks the moral progress of the community.\n\nAARON WASHINGTON KINCADE - Appanoose county numbers among its most prominent and successful native sons Aaron Washington Kincade, who owns two hundred and eighty-seven acres near Moravia, a portion of which constitutes the place, on which he was born November 1, 1866. He is a son of Francis and Martha (Luse) Kincade, the former a native of Illinois and the latter of Taylor township, Appanoose county. The maternal grandfather of our subject, Aaron Luse, came to Iowa from Ohio about the year 1851, while the paternal branch of the family was founded in this section of the state by Washington Kincade, who settled in Taylor township about the year 1862, coming to this section from his native state of Illinois. Francis Kincade passed away when the subject of this review was only six months old and his widow with her son made her home with her father, Aaron Luse. Later the mother of our subject married Evan L. Foster but Aaron W. Kincade continued to make his home with his grandfather, by whom he was reared to manhood.\n\nAaron W. Kincade acquired his education in the public schools of Appanoose county and upon the death of his grandfather inherited eighty acres of land, which constitutes a portion of his present farm. At the age of eighteen he began his independent career and after his marriage, which occurred less than one year afterward, he built a home upon his eighty acres. Additions to this first tract have been made from time to time, Mr. Kincade owning at present two hundred and eighty-seven acres of land, provided with a fine residence, barns and outbuildings and everything necessary for the conduct of a modern farm. He engages in general agricultural pursuits but gives special attention to the breeding of Poland China hogs and Shorthorn cattle, his animals commanding a high price and ready sale upon the market. During the years Mr. Kincade has cultivated the soil his work has always been progressive, able and intelligently carried forward and has resulted in the very gratifying measure of prosperity which he enjoys today and which places him among the representative men of this locality.\n\nOn the 9th of September, 1885, before he had reached his nineteenth year, Aaron W. Kincade was united in marriage to Miss Caroline Hiner, a daughter of Abraham Hiner, who came to Appanoose county in early times from Indiana. He located in Taylor township, where he resided until the time of his death. Mr. and Mrs. Kincade became the parents of four children: Bessie, the wife of Ira F. Boshak, of Chariton township; Russell, who passed away, leaving three children, Goldie, Herbert and Kermit; Rissie, who married Grover C. Kaster, of Taylor township; and Ernest, who lives at home. Mrs. Kincade is a devout member of the Methodist Episcopal church.\n\nMr. Kincade gives his political support to the republican party and has served in various important positions, including those of township assessor, constable and a member of the school board. He has done efficient work along public lines, being at all times progressive and public- spirited in his citizenship, while as a business man he has gained a notable place because of his keen discernment, his unremitting energy and his untiring industry. His place in agricultural circles of Appanoose county is a prominent one and is the more commendable as it has been achieved by honorable and continuous effort.\n\nLINCOLN KNAPP - Probably no man is better known throughout Appanoose county as a breeder of high-grade heavy draft horses than Lincoln Knapp, who has made his home in Centerville since 1881 and in the intervening years has become widely recognized as a progressive, able and resourceful business man. He is a native of Appanoose county, born August 22, 1861, and is a son of Jacob and Frances (Allen) Knapp, the former a native of Ohio, where his birth occurred May 3, 1827, and the latter of Massachusetts, born January 13, 1824. The father was of German ancestry and when he had reached maturity worked in his father's tannery in Madison county, Ohio, for some time. Later he learned the shoemaker's trade, but after his marriage, which occurred January 1, 1846, he went farther west, locating in Centerville, Appanoose county, where he purchased land. He bought forty acres, upon which a part of the city now stands, and there opened a shoe shop which he conducted for two years with gratifying success. He invested the profits of this enterprise in five hundred acres of land in Chariton township and began farming and dealing in horses. Gradually he abandoned the general aspects of his agricultural pursuits and centered his attention upon horse breeding, becoming well known as an importer and raiser of heavy draft horses. Being a man of excellent training and with a gift for writing, he made his knowledge more truly effective by contributing many articles to the breeders' journals and gazettes. In 1881 he rented out his farm and returned to the city, buying twenty-four acres within the town limits. The property which he purchased was the old Waddington homestead, a beautiful, picturesque home built in the southern style of architecture and one of the largest houses in the city. The father of our subject took up his residence there and continued his horse-breeding business until his death, which occurred on the 6th of March, 1896. His widow resides in Independence township with her daughter, Mrs. D. O. Scott.\n\nLincoln Knapp acquired his education in the country schools in Chariton township and from his childhood was familiar with the principles of scientific stock-breeding. He remained on the farm with his father until 1881 and then accompanied his parents into the city, where he has lived continuously since that time. After his marriage, which occurred in 1882, he bought a home at No. 903 West Maple street and went into partnership with his father in the breeding of draft horses. After the death of Jacob Knapp his son carried forward the work which he had begun and now gives his entire attention to the breeding of Percheron horses. In this he has met with a success which is the natural result of his long familiarity with his business, his great natural ability and his scientific methods.\n\nIn 1882 Mr. Knapp was united in marriage to Miss Zada Slater, a daughter of William K. and Rachel (Hanold) Slater, the former of whom was bona in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, on the 22d of July, 1833, and the latter in Portage county, Ohio, February 8, 1843. Mrs. Knapp's father is of English ancestry, her grandfather having come from the British Isles when he was fifteen years of age and settled in Philadelphia. On the maternal side Mrs. Knapp is of Scotch descent. Her father left his native state of Pennsylvania when he was sixteen years of age and went to North Benton, Ohio, where his marriage occurred. He taught school there for several years and later followed the same profession in the public schools of Van Buren county, Michigan, laboring in that section from 1856 to 1876. Being a man of keen spiritual perception and of a logical mind religiously inclined, his attention was attracted to the higher things of life and he felt himself inspired to proclaim religious truths. He was ordained in the Christian church and preached in Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois and later in Appanoose county, being aided in his work by his broad culture, wide reading and retentive memory. He remained in Iowa until 1899 and then returned to Michigan, where he died on the 28th of September, 1904. His wife is living on the home place in Michigan, but spends her winters in Iowa with Mr, and Mrs. Knapp. Mrs. Knapp is the only child born to their union, her birthplace being Van Buren county, Michigan, and her natal day June 24, 1861. Our subject and his wife have one daughter, Eva, who was born in Missouri, March 7, 1883. She is the wife of Harry C. Bradley, by whom she has two children: Dorothy, born March 20, 1906; and James K., whose birth occurred July 8, 1911.\n\nMr. Knapp has no fraternal affiliations and although he gives loyal support to the republican party, has never sought public office. He early realized that success must be purchased at the price of earnest and well directed labor and his record has been one of indefatigable effort and close application to business.\n\nSAMUEL D. KNOX, is proprietor of a harness business in Mystic, with which line of trade he has been continuously connected since 1884, although his present enterprise was not established until 1891. He was born in Keokuk county, Iowa, where the town of Hedrick now stands, on the 5th of February, 1851, his parents being William D. and Amanda J. (Doughty) Knox. The mother was born in Indiana, May 26, 1826, while the father's birth occurred in that state, December 12, 1822. They were married in Iowa on the 15th of November, 1846, and throughout the entire period of their married life, save for two years spent in Hancock county, Illinois, they resided in Jefferson county, Iowa. He followed both farming and merchandising and his was an active, useful life. His wife passed away in 1880. In their family were five children: John M., who is a resident of Winfield, Kansas; Washington W., living in Abingdon, Iowa; Samuel D., of this review; Arthur M., who died in infancy; and Norris S., who makes his home in Rock Island, Illinois.\n\nSamuel D. Knox resided with his parents in Jefferson county, with the exception of two years spent in Illinois, up to the time when he came to Appanoose county. He learned the harness-making trade in Abingdon, and applying himself closely to the business became a good workman. He has been engaged in that line of trade since 1884 and on the 13th of November, 1891, he came to Mystic where he has since made his home. He is now one of the oldest residents of the town, which was founded in 1887, four years before his arrival. He has figured continuously as a factor in its commercial enterprise for twenty-one years and is a wide- awake, alert, energetic business man, who closely watches and utilizes his opportunities for the attainment of success.\n\nIn politics Mr. Knox is a democrat, having closely adhered to the principles of the party since age conferred upon him the right of franchise. He served as postmaster in Abingdon under President Cleveland's first administration and he has been mayor of Mystic for one term. He is well known in fraternal circles, having been identified with the Masons for twenty-one years and is a past master of Walnut Lodge, No. 588, A. F. & A. M. of Mystic. His identification with the Odd Fellows dates from October, 1884, and he is a member of Marwin Lodge, No. 555, of Mystic. In his life he is loyal to the teachings of these organizations, recognizing the duties and obligations of his fellowmen and extending to them a helping hand when occasion arises.\n\nISAAC S. LANE, deceased, was for many years engaged in carpentering in Appanoose county and there are many who remember him as a citizen of genuine worth, possessing many admirable, manly traits that gained for him the friendship and kindly regard of all who knew him. Mr. Lane was born in Brown county, Ohio, in February, 1835, a son of John and Anna (Dawson) Lane, who were natives of Virginia. The father was a cabinet-maker by trade and sought a home in this county at an early period in its development, the remainder of his life being here passed.\n\nIsaac S. Lane was reared and educated in Ohio, becoming a resident of Appanoose county in 1854. He, too, was a cabinet-maker, having learned the trade with his father, and he followed that pursuit until after the inauguration of the Civil war, when his patriotic spirit was aroused and he enlisted in an Illinois regiment, with which he served for one year. On the expiration of that period he joined the navy, with which he served for about three years. He next went to St. Louis, where he took up the trade of ship carpentering and was upon the river, running from St. Louis to New Orleans. A few years thus passed, after which he returned to Centerville and with the capital acquired from his labors he established a grocery store. Later he embarked in the meat business, conducting a market for fifteen years or more, but eventually he retired from that line of merchandising and again took up carpentering, which he followed until he was unable to work any longer. His life was ever a busy, active and useful one, in which he made good use of his time and opportunities. He was ever honest in his dealings and energetic and persistent, and whatever he accomplished was the reward of his earnest labor.\n\nOn the 25th of November, 1897, Mr. Lane was married to Mrs. Susan (Wales) Majors, a daughter of Leonard and Elizabeth (Dougherty) Wales, who were natives of Maryland and Kentucky respectively. The father was a farmer by occupation and came in pioneer times to Appanoose county, where he secured land which he transformed into rich and productive fields, cultivating it continuously until his death in 1869. His wife survived him for twenty years, passing away in January, 1889. By a former marriage Mrs. Lane had three children: Sophia, who is the wife of Thomas Croxton; Catherine, who gave her hand in marriage to Louis Roth; and James Majors, a resident of Centerville.\n\nThe death of Mr. Lane occurred January 13, 1911, and was the occasion of deep regret to many friends. He had nearly passed the seventy-sixth milestone on life's journey and all who knew him esteemed him for his sterling worth. He voted with the democratic party, believing its principles most conducive to good government, and his religious faith was that of the Presbyterian church, in which he long held membership. He was also a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and Mrs. Lane belongs to the Women's Relief Groups. She owns a nice home at No. 411 North Twelfth street, where she is now pleasantly situated. There was nothing particularly spectacular in the history of Mr. Lane but he always did his duty, lived peaceably with his fellowmen and followed the Golden Rule, and such men are the real strength of the community in which they reside.\n\nJOHN LANKFORD - For almost forty-seven years John Lankford was engaged in the furniture and undertaking business in Centerville and throughout the entire period ranked as one of the leading, enterprising and progressive merchants of the city. Honored and esteemed by all, he is now living retired at the age of eighty-five years, his well spent life having gained for him a high place in the regard of his fellow townsmen. He is one of the venerable residents of Appanoose county, his birth having occurred in Indianapolis, Indiana, about a mile east of the courthouse on what was known as Pogues Run, March 31, 1827. His parents were Robert F. and Sarah (Street) Lankford.\n\nThe father, a native of Virginia, was born near Petersburg of English ancestry and became a carpenter and cabinetmaker by trade. He died in Missouri in 1883 while his wife passed away near Indianapolis in 1835.\n\nTheir son, John Lankford, attended a district school about seven miles from Indianapolis and in his youthful days learned the carpenter's trade under the direction of his father. When nineteen years of age he went to Preble county, Ohio, where he worked on the construction of the courthouse in 1849-50. He spent four years in carpentering in Preble county and then started westward, traveling by stage coach to Hamilton, Ohio, by bus to Cincinnati and by boat to St. Louis, where he remained for three days, after which he proceeded by boat to Keokuk, Iowa, and then walked across the country to Ottumwa, this state. This was in 1850. He was employed in carpenter work in that city from June until December and on the 15th of the latter month arrived in Centerville, Iowa. The town had been laid out and at that time contained a population of about one hundred. Appanoose county, however, was a frontier district and contained only one hundred and fifty voters. Much of the land was still in possession of the government for only here and there settlement had been made, showing that the work of civilization and improvement had been begun. During the winter following his arrival Mr. Lankford conducted a shoe shop and in the spring began work at the carpenter's trade which he followed for fifteen years. In 1865 he engaged in the furniture and undertaking business, buying out the store of Pendington & Houston. From that time until 1912 he was at the head of the business and his enterprising methods, his sound judgment, his energy and his industry were factors in his growing success, making him ultimately one of the prosperous residents of the city. In 1912 he sold out to his son Roy, who is today the leading furniture dealer of Centerville, conducting a large and well-equipped store and enjoying an extensive patronage.\n\nOn the 21st of September, 1852, Mr. Lankford was united in marriage to Miss Nancy Jane Henderson, a daughter of William S. and Sarah Henderson, both of whom were natives of Kentucky and were representatives of old American families. Mrs. Lankford was born in the Blue Grass state and when a child accompanied her parents on their removal to Indiana. Subsequently she became a resident of Iowa and was married in Centerville. On the 21st of September, 1902, this venerable and highly esteemed couple celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in their pleasant home at No. 112 East Maple street, and on September 21, 1912, they passed their sixtieth year of a harmonious married life, the diamond jubilee, surrounded by members of the family and among many friends, neighbors and well-wishers. It is seldom that a man and wife travel life's journey together for sixty years, and the event was a most unusual and interesting one, greatly enjoyed by all who were present, including their living children, their three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. A sumptuous meal was served and the bride and groom of sixty years before received a number of beautiful and tasteful gifts as mementos of the occasion. Mr. and Mrs. Lankford were the parents of eight children. William S. is a retired furniture dealer of Centerville, conducting a business here independent of his father for many years. Sarah became the wife of W. G. Clarke, an attorney and real-estate dealer of McAllister, Oklahoma, and they have four children: Ethel and Robert, both of McAllister; Harry E., now of Albia; and George, of McAllister. Heber Lankford, who was a railroad conductor, died January 13, 1907, at North Judson, Indiana. He married Lulu May Ammons, who now resides in Salem, Oregon, and they were the parents of a son, John Ammon Lankford, who is with his mother. Beatrice is the widow of John B. Spooner, who was foreman of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroad shops in Centerville, where he died in 1898. Mrs. Spooner and her daughter Jessie now make their home with her parents. Grace is the wife of E. E. Tyner, a city mail carrier of Indianapolis, and they have four children, Earl, Adrian, Melvin and Robert. Carl, a painter and decorator of Centerville, married Annie Cheeseman, of this place. Roy, who succeeded his father in business, married Orpha Albright, of Unionville, Missouri. He is prominent in fraternal circles, belonging to the lodge, chapter and commandery in Masonry, to the Mystic Shrine and also the Modern Woodmen camp of Centerville. Leona, the youngest of the family, is the wife of Claude Henaman, of Centerville, manager of the A. E. Wooden clothing store. They have one child, Mary Frances.\n\nMr. Lankford has been a republican since the organization of the party. His first presidential vote, however, was cast for General Taylor and in 1912 he voted for the reelection of President Taft. His sons are also true-blue republicans, unfaltering in their advocacy of the party principles. Mr. Lankford became a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Eaton, Ohio, in 1850, and joined Centerville lodge as a charter member and the only one now living. He is today the oldest Odd Fellow in Iowa. He has paid dues into the lodge for sixty-two years and has never drawn a single dollar in benefits. He likewise holds membership with the Masons, belonging to both the blue lodge and commandery of Centerville. His religious faith is that of the New Light church and his wife is a member of the First Church of Christ. When in 1912 he retired from active business at the age of eighty-five years he was the oldest active undertaker in the United States. He is indeed a remarkable man, one of strong character and of marked individuality. He has never worn an overcoat, yet he has been ill but few times in his life. His mind is yet exceedingly alert and he keeps in touch with the questions and interests of the day. He has built many of the palatial homes in Appanoose county, a number of which are still standing, and with the development, progress and improvement of the county along many lines he has been closely associated. He was a member of the first city council of Centerville and was school director for a number of years, but in his later years has never cared for nor desired office and when elected justice of the peace refused to serve. Nature has been kind to him because he has never abused her laws. One usually thinks of old age as a period when mental as well as physical powers weaken, but there is an old age which grows stronger and brighter mentally and morally as the years go by and gives out of its rich store of wisdom and experience for the benefit of others. Such has been the record of John Lankford, who is not only one of the most venerable but also one of the most honored citizens of Appanoose county and honored and respected wherever known and most of all where he is best known.\n\nJAMES MADISON LEPPER - In every line of activity hard work, determination and ambition are the foundation of success and upon them James M. Lepper has built up his prosperity in the general contracting and building business in Centerville. He has been engaged in this line of occupation during all of his active life and has gained a proficiency in it which, combined with his straightforward and honorable principles, makes him one of the leading business men of his community. He is a native son of Appanoose county, born February 23, 1861, his parents being James and Mary Ann (Clark) Lepper. The father was born in New York state. May 31, 1821, and at an early age became acquainted with the hardships and responsibilities of life, being burdened when he was still a child with the support of his parents. He faced the obstacles in his path with confidence and courage and at the age of sixteen was able to bring his father and mother west to Waverly, Pike county, Ohio, where he rented a home and secured employment as a farm hand. Being ambitious, energetic and economical, he saved his money and was eventually able to rent land which he developed and improved successfully for a number of years. He married in Ohio in 1855, his wife being a native of Jackson county, that state, born December 15, 1827. Later the father of our subject came to Appanoose county and purchased one hundred and sixty acres of land in Walnut township, whereon he resided until his death, which occurred in 1895. After his demise his widow remained upon the farm, making her home with her son Barton. She passed away in September, 1912. James Lepper's career offers many splendid examples of the value of determination and resolute purpose in the accomplishment of success, for he started out without money and destitute of outside help or influence and gradually worked his way upward until he became known as one of the most prominent breeders of Durham cattle in Appanoose county. In official circles, too, he made his name honored and respected and held various township offices, representing always republican doctrines and principles. He was a man of upright character and exemplified in his life the doctrines of the Methodist Episcopal church, in which he believed.\n\nJames M. Lepper of this review attended the district schools and spent his childhood upon his father's farm. After he had attained his majority he went to Mystic and there learned the carpentering trade, working at it for wages for one year. He soon, however, abandoned carpentering in order to engage in contracting and building and in this way he gained valuable experience in his chosen line of activity. In the fall of 1903 he came to Centerville and established his office in this city. With characteristic energy he applied himself to his duties, bending his energies to the building up of a representative patronage. In this he has succeeded, for his ability soon made him widely known and today he occupies a place among the leading contractors in the city. He does a great deal of residence work and has built many of the finest homes in Centerville, all of which are attractive in design and substantial in construction. Mr. Lepper has carefully watched his business interests, noting his opportunities for success, and the years have brought him gratifying prosperity as reward for his well directed labors.\n\nOn the 4th of Oecember, 1889, Mr. Lepper was united in marriage to Miss Louisa McMurray, a daughter of John A. and Elizabeth (Hawthorn) McMurray, of whom further mention is made elsewhere in this work. Mr. and Mrs. Lepper have become the parents of a son, Jesse, whose birth occurred in Appanoose county, July 19, 1892, and who is now assisting his father. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lepper are devout members of the First Methodist Episcopal church and both are well known in the affairs of the Woman's Relief Corps. Mr. Lepper is a republican in politics and has always been interested in the growth and advancement of Appanoose county, although his public spirit never takes the form of office seeking, and he is a progressive man who seems to realize the value of every situation and to make the most of his many opportunities. Through legitimate lines of expansion he has built up a growing business which is indicative of his spirit of enterprise and determination.\n\nDAVID LODWICK - A spirit of enterprise and progressiveness in business characterizes the activities of David Lodwick, one of the partners in the Lodwick Brothers Coal Company, now owning and operating five mines at Mystic. This is one of the most important industries of this section of the county, adding materially to its wealth in that it furnishes employment to a large number of workmen while at the same time returning a substantial income to the proprietors. Mr. Lodwick is a native of the little rock-ribbed country of South Wales, his birth having occurred at Pun Dyram, near Dowlais, January 7, 1864. His parents were William and Ann (James) Lodwick, both of whom were born in 1824, the former in Cardiganshire and the latter in Pembrokeshire. In 1870 the entire family came to the United States, settling first at Akron, Ohio, and a short time thereafter they went to Youngstown, remaining in the vicinity of that city for about twenty years. They were also for several years in Shawnee, in Perry county, but finally returned to Youngstown, where both the father and mother passed away, the former dying in 1887, while the latter survived him for twenty years, departing this life in 1907. William Lodwick engaged in coal mining throughout his entire life. Unto him and his wife were born seven children: John B., still living at Youngstown, Ohio; Rachel, the wife of John Llewellyn, of Mystic; L. L., who is in partnership with his brother David, and makes his home in Ottumwa, Iowa; Margaret, who married Lewis E. Lewis and is living in Youngstown, Ohio; W. B., a resident of Greeley, Colorado; David; and Martha Ann, who is the wife of John D. Williams, of Sherodsville, Ohio.\n\nDavid Lodwick was a lad of but six years when the family crossed the Atlantic to the new world. He remained with his parents until he had attained his majority and his boyhood days were largely spent around the mines. For four years, however, he was employed in the rolling mills at Youngstown but during the remainder of his life he has been identified with mining interests. He dug coal for many years and did everything connected with the mining of that product so that he thoroughly knows the business in principle and detail. In 1889 he came to Mystic with his brother William and has now made his home here for a period of twenty- three years. His brothers, J. B. and L. L. Lodwick, had preceded him to this district in order to lease some coal land and had succeeded in leasing one hundred and sixty acres from John M. Elgin. David Lodwick and his brother William then opened two drift mines on the property above mentioned and David Lodwick has since been actively engaged in the operation of the mines, giving his personal supervision to the work. He is associated in the business with his brothers, L. L. and J. B., the three forming the Lodwick Brothers Coal Company of Mystic. They are now operating five mines in this district, having a capacity of eight hundred and fifty tons of coal per day. One of these mines was opened and developed entirely by David Lodwick, his brothers, however, being associated with him in the operation of the other four. He is the active partner in the business and has complete charge of the mines. He also conducts two supply stores in connection with the mines and employs altogether about five hundred workmen. His long experience has made him familiar with every phase of mining and mine equipment as well as mine operation and he is today one of the prosperous residents of the county, having attained a measure of success which is the direct result of his unfaltering industry, his perseverance and his determination. He has platted Roosevelt Heights, an addition to Mystic, and he is also the owner of a half interest in Fruitland, an addition which he opened in connection with T. R. Sedgwick. In IQH he built and now owns the Masonic Temple here and he is also the owner of a corner block on Second and Main streets.\n\nMr. Lodwick has always been most active in the affairs of the town, contributing in large measure to its upbuilding and improvement and to the establishment of a high moral tone here. His political allegiance has ever been given to the republican party and he has filled several offices. He assisted in the corporation of the town of Mystic in 1890 and for several years acted as city clerk. He was also a member of the city council for a number of years and was mayor two years, during which period he gave to the city a faithful, businesslike administration. He has always stood for progress and reform and has shown his deep interest in the cause of education by active service on the school board of which he was president for several years. He has taken a most helpful part in suppressing the liquor traffic and he was untiring in his efforts to secure the admission of the interurban line when it was opposed by the merchants of the town.\n\nIn 1891, Mr. Lodwick was united in marriage to Miss Marjorie Griffiths, who was born in Wales in September, 1864, and came to the United States in 1869 with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John R. Griffiths. The children of this marriage were six in number: William G., who is attending college in Mount Pleasant, Iowa; John S., a high-school student; David, Charles T, and Albert, all yet at home; and Mary Evelyn, who died at the age of eight years. The parents are members of the Episcopal church and Mr. Lodwick has served on the official board. He is a Master Mason, belonging to Walnut Lodge, No. 588, A. F. & A. M., and is also connected with the Woodmen. His interests are broad, his activities resourceful, his public spirit unfailing He has accomplished much that is beneficial to the city and his business enterprises have always contributed to public prosperity as well as to individual success.\n\nREV. MARTIN M. LOFTUS, has been rector of St. Mary's Catholic church of Centerville for the past eight years and has labored zealously and effectively to foster its growth and influence. His birth occurred in Burlington, Iowa, on the 9th of August, 1875, his parents being John and Ellen (McCormick) Loftus, the former a native of County Mayo, Ireland, and the latter of County Roscommon. John Loftus, a contractor by trade, emigrated to the United States in 1862 and took up his abode in Newark, New Jersey. In 1870 he came to Burlington, Iowa, where he embarked in business as a contractor and where he has resided continuously since. It was in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, that he wedded Miss Ellen McCormick, who had made her way direct to Burlington after landing on the shores of the United States. Unto them were born the following children: Thomas, who is rector of St. Mary's Catholic church at Oskaloosa, Iowa; Martin M., of this review; John, who is engaged in business as a contractor at Burlington in association with his father; and Elizabeth, at home\n\n.\n\nIn the acquirement of an education Martin M. Loftus attended Lourdes Academy at Burlington, Iowa, and also St. Ambrose College at Davenport. Later he entered St. Paul's Seminary at St. Paul, Minnesota, and subsequently completed his studies at St. Mary's Seminary of Baltimore, Maryland. From September, 1901, until November, 1902, he was actively identified with educational interests as professor of Latin, History and Greek in St. Ambrose College of Davenport, Iowa. In 1902 Rev. Loftus went to Council Bluffs, Iowa, as assistant to Father Smythe at St. Francis Xavier church of that city, remaining there until July, 1904, when he came to Centerville. On the seventeenth day of that month he became rector of St. Mary's church of Centerville, which has since remained under his supervision and has steadily grown in membership and as an influence for good. The church and parish house are pleasantly located on South Eighteenth street.\n\nIn his political views Father Loftus is independent, not desiring to be bound by party ties when helping to select men and measures to further the general welfare. Fraternally he is identified with the Knights of Columbus, belonging to Loras Council at Davenport, Iowa. He has labored with consecrated zeal to promote the spread of Catholicity here and has won the love and support of his parishioners in an unusual degree.\n\nHe has proved himself in the discharge of his important duties a far-sighted and reliable business man and an able financier and is regarded as one of the most valuable men connected with the bank. He has other important financial interests, being a stockholder in the First National Bank of Seymour and the owner of a large automobile livery business in Numa. In addition he holds title to eighty acres of improved farm land in Lincoln township, just adjoining the town.\n\nFraternally Mr. Long is affiliated with the Ancient Order of United Workmen, acting as financier of that organization. His religious views are in accord with the doctrines of the Methodist church, and politically he gives allegiance to the democratic party, supporting always its men and measures, although he never seeks office for himself. He is well known in this county where he has lived since his birth and has a wide acquaintance here, having won uniform trust and good-will by reason of a life which in all of its phases is upright, straightforward and honorable. He is still a young man but has proven himself able, ambitious and energetic and he cannot fail of continued progress and increasing prominence in the financial world.\n\nJ. H. LUSE - Since the year 1864 J. H. Luse has been a resident of Appanoose county and is therefore qualified to speak with authority of the events which have shaped its history and have had important bearing upon its progress. He is now filling the office of postmaster at Mystic and has held other public positions, the duties of which he has ever promptly and faithfully discharged. He was born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, September 20, 1860, a son of Boan and Hannah (Horner) Luse, who were also natives of the Keystone state, the father having been born in Greene county and the mother in Fayette county. The family comes of French ancestry on the father's side and is of German lineage in the maternal line. The grandfather, Henry A. Luse, was a native of New Jersey, served as a soldier of the War of 1812 and led an active business life, devoting the greater part of his time and attention to farming, his interests in that line being so carefully conducted that in time he became a wealthy man. He continued a resident of Pennsylvania until his death.\n\nIn the year 1864 Boan and Hannah Luse left their native state and came to Iowa, taking up their abode in Walnut township, Appanoose county, about a mile and a half north of Mystic. They settled on the farm that is now owned and occupied by their son, James F. Luse, and both died upon the old home place. They had for thirty-seven years lived in the county when the father passed away in 1901, at the age of seventy-seven years. His wife also reached the age of seventy-seven, her death occurring in 1906. He had made farming his life work and as he prospered in his undertakings he extended the boundaries of the home place until he owned four hundred acres in one body. He was a very quiet, resourceful man, of retiring disposition but genuine worth gave him the warm regard of those who knew him. In the family were four sons, while the only daughter, Ella, who was the third in order of birth, died in Pennsylvania when but a year old. The sons are: Henry A., who died in 1876, at the age of twenty-two years; Joseph R., a resident of Seymour, Iowa; J. H., of this review; and James Frank, a farmer of this county.\n\nJ. H. Luse was but four years of age when the family arrived in Iowa, and the experiences of his youth and boyhood were those which usually fall to the lot of the farm lad. When not in the school room, his time and attention were largely taken up with the work of the fields and he continued with his parents until 1885. He then started in the business world as a clerk and was employed in various stores in Mystic for eight or ten years. In the meantime he took an active interest in politics and his fellow townsmen, recognizing his worth and ability, elected him to the office of mayor of Mystic in 1892. He served for one term, or two years, and afterward went upon the road as a traveling salesman, representing the Lodwich Brothers Coal Company for three years. He then held the office of assistant postmaster for one year and during the past five years has been postmaster of Mystic. He also filled the position of township assessor for one term in the '80s. His political support has ever been given to the republican party. He was reared in that faith and has never seen occasion to change his principles.\n\nMr. Luse has been married twice. In 1884 he wedded Flora B. Stevens, who was born in Wapello county, Iowa, and died in Appanoose county in 1889, when twenty-six years of age, leaving a little daughter, Jessie M., who died at the age of four years. In 1896 Mr. Luse was again married, his second union being with Malina A. Fuller, who was born in Appanoose county in 1858. There are four children of this marriage. May, Helen, Marjorie and John Boan. The parents are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, in the work of which they are actively interested, while to its support they contribute liberally. Mr. Luse is now serving on the official board and otherwise manifests his interest in the growth of the church and in promoting its influence. He is a Master Mason, belonging to Walnut Lodge, No. 588, at Mystic, and his fidelity to its teachings makes him a worthy exemplar of the craft.\n\nJACKSON LUSE, needs no introduction to the readers of this volume for he has spent his entire life in this county and his conduct has ever been actuated by high principles, with due regard for the rights of his fellowmen. He belongs to that class of substantial agriculturists who constitute the real strength and stability of any community and are the builders of its progress and prosperity. Born on the old homestead farm on the 8th of April, 1855, Jackson Luse has therefore been a resident of Appanoose county for more than fifty-seven years. He represents one of the old pioneer families here, being a son of Aaron Luse, a native of Trumbull county, Ohio, who was bom on the 12th of March, 1819. The grandfather, William Luse, was a native of Pennsylvania and on removing from that state established his home in Ohio, where he continued to reside until called to his final rest. Aaron Luse was reared in Ohio to the age of nineteen years when he went to Missouri and afterward to Illinois. Subsequently he arrived in Van Buren county, Iowa, and there when a young man of twenty-two years was married to Miss Martha Smith, who was born near Cleveland, Ohio, October 26, 1821, and came to Iowa with her parents when the state was still under territorial rule, the family home being established in Van Buren county. Ten years after their marriage, which was celebrated on the 24th of January, 1841, Mr. and Mrs. Aaron Luse came to Appanoose which was still a frontier district, much of the land being then in possession of the government. Mr. Luse entered a claim which he transformed into one of the best farms of the township and in addition to the cultivation of die cereals best adapted to soil and climate he successfully engaged in raising stock. He also planted an orchard which soon came into good bearing and throughout the years of his residence here took an active and helpful interest in the agricultural and horticultural development of this part of the state. He erected upon his place a commodious and attractive home, also barns and other necessary outbuildings for the shelter of grain and stock and in all of his business dealings was found to be thoroughly reliable as well as enterprising and progressive. His many sterling traits of character commanded for him the confidence and good-will of all who knew him. His death, which occurred August 25, 1881, when he was sixty-two years of age, was a cause of deep regret to all those who knew him. His wife survived him for about seventeen years, dying August 3, 1898, when she was about seventy-seven years of age. They were for many years active and valued members of the Methodist Episcopal church, taking a helpful part in its work and contributing generously to its support. Mr. Luse served as church steward and also as superintendent of the Sunday school for a number of years. The cause of education found in him a champion and he advanced the interests of the schools while serving on the board. He was likewise township assessor, township trustee and justice of the peace and discharged every duty devolving upon him, whether of a public or private nature, in the most capable and satisfactory manner. The family numbered eight children: Mrs. Rosetta Cline, whose husband died of disease contracted in the Civil war, while she passed away in Moravia, Iowa, April 13, 1911, at the age of sixty-nine years; Mrs. Sarah J. Skinner, who died at Main, Iowa, January 13, 1906, when sixty- one years of age; Mrs. Martha Foster, a widow living in Taylor town- ship; Laura E., the wife of Rev. George M. Andrews, of Kenesaw, Adams county, Nebraska; W. J., of Garden Grove, Iowa; Jackson; Mary, the wife of T. J. Turner, of Moravia; and Douglas, who died at the age of eleven months.\n\nThe experiences which came to Jackson Luse in his boyhood and youth were those which usually fall to the farm lad who is trained in a home where energy, economy and industry are regarded as important factors in life. As opportunity offered he pursued his education in one of the old-time log schoolhouses and in the school of experience he has since learned many valuable lessons. He was married when twenty-one years of age to Miss Mina Kaster, who was born in Chariton township, Appanoose county, and was reared and educated here. Her father, Robert Kaster, was a native of Pennsylvania and lived for some time in Indiana before coming to Iowa. On his arrival in this state he cast in his lot with the early settlers of Appanoose county and became well known and prominent here. He had wedded Mary McDaniel, who was also a native of Pennsylvania. His death occurred October 6, 1895, when he was seventy-four years of age, while his wife died January 24, 1912, at the age of eighty-six. Mr. Kaster voted with the democratic party and his religious faith was that of the Methodist Episcopal church of which his wife was also a consistent and loyal member. For a number of years he was a class leader in the Fairview church, taking an active part in its work and giving generously to its support. Mr. and Mrs. Kaster were the parents of ten children: Nancy, who died at the age of nine years; Mrs. Hulda J. Worthington, of Hamilton county, Nebraska; Mrs. Mary E. Boyer, of Chariton township; Robert H., of Appanoose county; Mrs. Luse; James M., of Monroe county, Iowa; Mrs. Hannah E. Gladfelder, of Chariton township; William and Benjamin, both deceased; and Mrs. Australia Worthington, who passed away at York, Nebraska.\n\nThroughout his entire life Jackson Luse has carried on general agricultural pursuits and the nursery business, save for two years which he spent in the village of Main and one year in Nebraska. The habits of industry and perseverance which he formed in his youth have remained salient features in his success. He is today the owner of two hundred and eighty acres of good land which includes the old homestead farm. His fields are carefully tilled and produce substantial crops and as the years have gone by he has won that prosperity which is the reward of earnest, persistent and honorable labor. In 1892 he established a nursery which he conducted successfully for almost ten years, after which he closed out the business in order to devote his attention more exclusively to the cultivation of grain. For two years he conducted a store in Main and also served as postmaster during that time. His attention, however, has been largely given to his farm which is a splendidly improved property. In addition to a new home upon the place he has three large and substantial barns. A fine orchard of ten acres is enclosed by a half-mile of evergreen trees which serve as a wind-break as well as add to the beauty of the place. The greater part of the land is under cultivation, producing excellent crops each year, and Mr. Luse is justly regarded as one of the most enterprising and progressive farmers of his locality, keeping in touch with the trend of modern progress. He utilizes the latest improved machinery to facilitate the work of the fields, has always practiced rotation of crops and employs other modern and scientific methods the value of which has been proven by practical experience.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Luse have become parents of seven children: Effie V., the wife of J. W. McDaniel, of Chariton township; Elbert Aaron, Robert E., Lloyd E. and Gus E., all of whom are married and have homes of their own upon farms in Taylor township; and Cody Jackson and Coy E., who are yet with their parents. The son Elbert A. was married February 26, 1902, to Miss Bertha Mae Stockwell and they became the parents of a son and two daughters: Doyle and Freda, at home; and Ruby, who died at the age of fifteen months. Robert E. was married May 30, 1903, to Miss Glennie Mae Hixon, and they had a daughter, Glennie Marie, who died in infancy. Lloyd E. was married April 3, 1912, to Erma H. Glick. Gus E. was married June 24, 1909, to Miss Edna A. Tisue, who departed this life July 22, 1909, and on the 15th of February, 1911, he was again married, his second union being with Miss Mae J. Jones, by whom he has one son, Thomas Jackson. To Mr. and Mrs. McDaniel have been born six children, four sons and two daughters, William G., Ryman Jack- son, Lyndon Luse, Lloyd E., Bertha Gladys and Daphne Viola.\n\nThe parents are members of the Methodist Episcopal church and their lives are guided by its teachings. For a quarter of a century Mr. Luse has served as one of the church trustees, has also been Sunday school superintendent and church steward. His political allegiance is given to the republican party and he is a prominent worker in its local ranks. He filled the office of township assessor for six consecutive years, was township trustee for three terms, has been justice of the peace and a member of the school board. In every relation of life he has commanded the confidence and good-will of those who know him, for his life has been upright and honorable and he holds to high ideals. He has lived to witness remarkable changes in the county during the fifty-seven years of his residence here, for its wild lands have been claimed and cultivated, towns and villages have sprung up, schools and churches have been built and all modern improvements have been introduced. As the years have gone by he has ever borne his share in the work of advancement, giving his support and indorsement to all measures for the material, social, intellectual and moral benefit of the community.\n\nHARRY E. LUTHER, is proprietor of the largest garage in Centerville and in addition is sales agent for the Ford and Oakland automobiles. He established this business in 1907 and has met with growing success in its conduct. His birth occurred in Clinton, Iowa, May 23, 1880, his parents being Charles E. and Anna R. (Hodgson) Luther, the former a native of Illinois and the latter of Canada. In early life the father followed farming but soon after his marriage turned his attention to railroading, running a train for a time. Subsequently he took-up construction work and finally removed to Clinton, Iowa, where he was employed on construction work by the Northwestern Railroad Company. His next place of residence was at What Cheer, Iowa, where he embarked in the hotel business, conducting the Clifton House there for three years. On the expiration of that period he returned to railway service in connection with construction work for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company. After some time he left that business and removed to Birmingham, Missouri, where he continued for a year. He next bought a farm near Burlington, Iowa, which he cultivated for a year, and then returned to Clinton in 1892. For six years thereafter he lived retired but indolence and idleness were utterly foreign to his nature and at the end of that period he took another position in connection with construction work with the Northwestern road when that company was laying its double track from Boone to Council Bluffs, a task that required a year for its completion. At the end of that time Mr. Luther once more retired and is now comfortably situated in Clinton.\n\nHarry E. Luther was reared and educated in that city, attending the public schools. He afterward learned the plumber's trade which he followed for three years in Clinton and for one year in Kansas City, Missouri. He next returned to Clinton and took charge of the sporting goods department of the wholesale hardware house of C. E. Armstrong & Company, remaining there for three years. Going to the isthmus of Tehuantepec he there joined his brother and took charge of the mechanical department of the Tehuantepec Rubber Culture Company with which he was connected for three years. On his return to the United States he made his way northward to St. Louis, where he entered the employ of the Simmons Hardware company. That was during the year of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition there and Mr. Luther did all the decorating for the ten thousand dollar exhibit of the company at the fair. He afterward came to Centerville where he engaged in the hardware business on his own account until 1907, when he sold out, turning his attention to the automobile business. For five years he handled the Ford machine exclusively but now also handles the Oakland car and conducts the largest garage in the city, receiving a liberal patronage.\n\nIn 1900 Mr. Luther was married to Miss Rosa Pauline Flynn, a daughter of Michael and Hattie Flynn. The father died when Mrs. Luther was an infant and she was quite young at the time of her mother's demise. By her marriage she has become the mother of two children: Arthur E., eleven years of age; and Pauline M., aged five. Mr. Luther owns several residence lots here and has a pleasant and attractive home at No. 315 North Fifteenth street. He holds membership with the Elks lodge and gives his political support to the republican party. His has been an active and useful life and while he has never been actuated by the spirit of vaulting ambition he has never hesitated to take a forward step when the way was open. Thus gradually he has advanced and he is now at the head of a business which is constantly growing and bringing him a substantial income.\n\nGEORGE D. LYNCH, M. D. , who since 1901 has engaged in the practice of medicine, opening an office in Moravia in 1905, is one of Iowa's native sons, his birth having occurred in Monterey, Davis county, February 21, 1872. His parents are William and Catherine (Moyer) Lynch. The father was born in Kentucky, January 8, 1840, and the mother's birth occurred in the same state in 1841. They came to Iowa with their respective parents at an early age and were married in Davis county. The father resided at Hilltown until the time of his marriage and engaged in the operation of a mill at that place, but for many years has carried on farming and now owns and occupies a good tract of land in this county. In their family are the following children: Amarilla, the wife of J. S. Horn, of Moulton, Iowa; John S., also of that place; George D.; Etta, the wife of Ambrose Horn, of Moulton; and Mayme, the wife of Bud Henson.\n\nDr. Lynch resided at the place of his birth until 1899, spending his youthful days in the usual manner of farm lads whose time is occupied with the work of the fields and the duties of the schoolroom. He was liberally educated, supplementing his early, advantages by a course of study in the Southern Iowa Normal School at Bloomfield, in which he completed the teacher's course by graduation with the class of 1890. He then taught for sixteen terms, between 1890 and 1898, after which he entered the Keokuk Medical College, in which he studied for two years. He next became a student in Barnes University at St. Louis, where he completed his medical course in 1901. Dr. Lynch located for practice at Tindall, Missouri, where he remained until 1905, when he came to Moravia, where he has since engaged in general practice. He is capable, earnest and conscientious in the performance of his professional duties and is accorded a liberal patronage, for he has demonstrated his ability to successfully cope with the intricate problems that continuously confront the physician. He has some business interests outside of his profession, being a stockholder in the Farmers State Bank at Trenton, Missouri, and is also the owner of excellent farm land between Moravia and Centerville.\n\nIn 1891 Dr. Lynch was united in marriage to Miss Mattie A. Davis, a native of Wayne county and a daughter of W. M. and Emma Davis. They have one child, Fanchen Pauline. Dr. Lynch gives his political allegiance to the republican party and at one time was candidate for nomination for state senator from the district comprising Appanoose and Davis counties. He is loyal in his service of the party and through political activity seeks to further the best interests of good government. Fraternally he is connected with the Masons and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, but after all it is his professional duties which claim the greater part of his time and attention and to the end of promoting his knowledge and efficiency in the line of his chosen profession he is a member of the county and state medical societies."
