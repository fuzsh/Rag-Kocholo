        "text": "Built between 1832 and 1836, you will find a series of five arches throughout town. Word is that property along the road was so valuable when the town was being settled in the early 1800’s, builders didn’t want to waste an inch of frontage on lanes or alleys. Instead, they put in arched passages to allow people and wagons access to the back of their buildings."
