Based on the valuable responses collected, the BERC successfully calculated the 2017 value of the IU East Regional Business Confidence Index. The report had been released on the IU East Business and Economic Research Center (the BERC) website at iue.edu/business/berc.\n\nThe BERC, a center within the School of Business and Economics at Indiana University East, is again working with the local economic development corporations and chambers of commerce to conduct the 2018 annual business survey for the East-Central Indiana region. The survey will be open to businesses/companies in the Fayette, Henry, Randolph, Union, and Wayne counties from Monday, September 17, to Friday, September 28.\n\nResults of the survey will help the BERC maintain the IU East Regional Business Confidence Index to monitor the business sentiment and economic trend in our region, and also assist further the local and regional economic studies conducted by the BERC. In addition, survey results might aid the aforementioned economic development corporations and chambers of commerce for consideration as part of any future strategic planning and economic development efforts to facilitate a healthy business climate in the region.\n\nResponses to the 10-minute survey will be confidential.

Each event will feature 8 to 10 speakers telling stories inspired by a loose theme. \"Making it\" is the theme for the first event â set for 7 p.m. on Thursday, September 27, at 923 North E Street â the space shared by Maria Mitrione's and New Boswell's in Richmond's Depot District. The event is free and open to the public; food and drinks cost extra.\n\nWarp & Woof's organizers are a professor and two students associated with the writing program at the Earlham School of Religion, which provided seed money for the event. They plan to host four events per year â fall, winter, spring, and summer.\n\n\"These storytelling events are everywhere,\" said Ben Brazil, director of ESR's Ministry of Writing Program. \"Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Muncie â you name it. And people love them, because people love a good story. Wayne County is not as urban as those other places, but I'm betting our stories are just as good.\"\n\nAs a form, storytelling has gained traction nationwide â via podcasts, festivals, and regular events in hundreds of cities. Brazil, who leads writing courses at the Quaker seminary, said that he believes such events are a kind of community ministry.\n\n\"The name Warp & Woof sounds a little weird, but it comes from our vision,\" Brazil said. \"'Warp' means the threads that run lengthwise. \"Woof\" means the threads that run across them. Together, they make up a complete fabric.\n\n\"We think of stories as threads in just the same way. Together they weave together the fabric of our community. We want to help that weaving happen â and if that happens to require a really fun event with drinks and food, we can live with that, too.\"\n\nAlthough the line-up for the first show is set, anyone who lives in Wayne County is invited to propose a story \"regardless of their politics, skin color, religious beliefs â whatever,\" Brazil said. \"This is for everyone.\"\n\nTo learn more, visit Warp & Woof on the web at www.warpandwoofstories.org.\n\nTickets for Nico and Vinz Concert on September 22nd Available at Earlham College\n\nPosted August 22, 2018\n\nAs a part of Homecoming Weekend, Nico & Vinz hit the stage.

The effort will eliminate the use of more than a million foam cups, half a million foam bowls and plates and almost 150,000 take-out containers used annually in the cafÃ©. \"The new wares utilize less energy and water during manufacturing than the alternatives, and do not release toxic residues into the soil during composition,\" says Kris Ankeny, director of Food & Nutrition Services at Reid Health.\n\n\"Compostables\" is a term that is regulated by the American Society of Testing and Materials and is defined as a manufactured item that can degrade within 90 days into organic and inorganic materials without releasing toxic residues during the process, Ankeny says.\n\nThe new products being used in the cafÃ© include cups that look to be plastic, but are made of a combination of potato or cornstarch polymers, wheat straw, sugarcane, recycled paper and other plant-based resins. \"These products, which are virtually nontoxic upon decomposition, offer a significantly reduced degradation timeframe than their traditional counterparts and thus impose a negligible burden on local landfills.\"\n\nAnkeny noted the following about some of the traditional materials and their decomposition rates:\n\nAluminum cans â 175 years\n\nHard plastic bottle caps â more than 400 years\n\nPolystyrene foam â more than 500 years\n\nThe compostable products are starkly better:\n\nClear cups and silverware made from plant resins â two to four months in commercial facilities or one to two years at home\n\nWheat straw take-out containers and plates â two to three months in commercial facilities, up to six months at home\n\nPaper hot cups and bowls â two to three months in commercial facilities, from three to 12 months at home\n\n\"The sustainable changes made by Reid Health seek to preserve the integrity of tomorrow now by eliminating waste that could ultimately disrupt the lives of the Reid community,\" Ankeny says.\n\nThe latest change is the newest of several recycling and sustainability efforts implemented by the Food & Nutrition Services department. The department participates in a Food Rescue program that reduces waste and contributes to a reduction in community food insecurity; collects plastic bottle caps in a partnership with Cope Environmental Center that recycles the plastic into other uses; and will soon offer a re-usable lidded cup and straw, which will continue to reduce single-use items.\n\nWernle's Catalyst4Change Honoring Tamika Catchings\n\nPosted September 6, 2018\n\nWernle Youth and Family Treatment Center, Richmond, IN to host over 400 on September 20, 2018.\n\nWernle's most prestigious event - Catalyst4Change will be held on Thursday, September 20th on its campus in the Lingle Wellness Center.

We are very impressed by the educational opportunities it is offering to students,\" says Alan Scantland. \"Both of us benefitted from tremendous opportunities when we were Earlham students, and we are happy to be able to support a variety of important initiatives at the College.\"\n\nHighlights of the gift, which is pledged over a three-year period, will include support for:\n\nContinuing Earlham's recently piloted Engagement Grants program, which provide support for students who are academically sound and engaged in the campus community but at risk of leaving due to financial concerns;\n\nExpanding Earlham's Summer Research Fund;\n\nLaunching a three-week off-campus program in May for student-athletes;\n\nIncreasing funds for student conference travel; and\n\nExpanding support for teaching faculty to integrate co-curricular experiences into academic departments, programs and divisions.\n\n\"We are grateful that our alumni continue to make leadership gifts to create exceptional learning opportunities for our students,\" Interim President Avis Stewart says. \"This generous gift will support innovations in our curriculum that will significantly impact learning for all students, regardless of major or background.\"\n\nThis gift will bolster support for Earlham's EPIC initiative, a student-centered approach to the liberal arts and sciences that connects traditional coursework with transformative learning experiences, including research, off-campus study, internships and leadership development, to prepare students for life after college.\n\nEarlham also offers The EPIC Advantage â a funded internship, project or research experience (averaging $5,000) for all students â a level of support that few other institutions in the country can match. Last year, 324 students participated in EPIC Advantage experiences across the world. Earlham launched The EPIC Advantage with a $7.5 million gift from the Scantlands in the spring of 2017.\n\nWith the addition of this new funding, Earlham is positioned to once again offer Engagement Grants to students with evidenced engagement in and out of the classroom. Last year, more than 60 students in good academic standing were approved for these awards averaging $2,200 per student, based on the students' need, as part of the roll out of the three-year program.\n\nNext May, student-athletes competing in men's basketball and women's volleyball will travel to Cape Town, South Africa, as part of effort to make sure all students benefit from EPIC. The program offers student-athletes an opportunity for high impact experiential learning, international travel and athletic competition. The program provides a new option to student-athletes who are interested in off-campus study, in addition the numerous offerings the College already offers to all students.\n\nThe increased support for teaching faculty will enable continued innovation and integration of EPIC into academic departments, divisions and programs.\n\n\"With funding over a three-year period, we have the opportunity to evaluate the success of each initiative and tailor our offerings to best meet the needs and expectations of this incoming generation,\" says Kristin Champa, vice president for institutional advancement. \"This gift is a wonderful example of alumni co-investing in the Earlham experience. We are grateful that the Scantlands are continuing to support the College's ongoing commitment to deliver the high-impact opportunities that students need to prepare for rewarding careers, wherever their paths may take them.\"\n\nMashrou' Leila Scheduled to Perform at Earlham College on Saturday, September 8th\n\nPosted August 22, 2018\n\nBorn of a nocturnal encounter at the American University of Beirut in 2008, Mashrou' Leila is a six-member band that fuses the craftiness of a music workshop with the punch of stadium rock.

This also keeps our health care bills down,\" says Doris Ebeling, Human Resources Director for Frank Miller Lumber Co. in Union City. Her company has worked with Reid Health for five years.\n\n\"Bringing Reid Health on site allows the employee the advantage of getting their screenings without taking off work. They also have the ability to have their results sent directly to their doctor,\" Ebeling said. She has had the Reid Health team conduct various wellness screenings on site and has also made it possible for team members to come to the hospital for other tests such as heart scans. \"The results of their tests have brought their attention to issues such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and thyroid issues, among others.\"\n\nJennifer Stachler, registered dietitian, conducts a healthy cooking demonstration for Richmond Power & Light employees.\n\nRhonda McClure, Human Resources Assistant at Richmond Power & Light, has also been connected to Reid Health wellness for about four years. She said health screenings and other on-site presentations have been positively received by the team. \"One employee stated the event was discussed outside of work and because of that conversation, a family member visited his physician, asked for testing and discovered an issue.

She received her bachelors in elementary education and then went on to teach 2nd and 3rd grades. She loved her experience in the classroom and working with fellow educators and families. As Julie and her husband, Mike, began planning for starting their own family, they both decided for Julie to stay connected with education, but on a part-time basis. Soon, Julie was hired as the District Manager of Junior Achievement (JA) of Eastern Indiana.\n\nJA works to teach students K-12 about financial literacy, workforce readiness, and entrepreneurship. Under Julie's leadership, the awareness of JA and the amount of classes served has grown throughout her three years with the non-profit. JA and the Chamber have formed a partnership (JA in a Day) that has been making a big impact on Wayne County seniors. As the new School is Cool coordinator, Julie hopes to strengthen partnerships with the chamber, schools, parents, and Wayne County families. She hopes to tackle absenteeism and develop a spirit of grit among students who will later enter the community's workforce.\n\nMelissa Vance, President and CEO of the Chamber, said, \"We are pleased to have Julie join the Chamber team. She has been involved with our Business & Education Committee, so we have known her work ethic and attention to detail for quite some time. Because she is involved with the schools already through her position with Junior Achievement, I am confident the School Is Cool transition will be seamless.\"\n\nThe Wayne County Area Chamber of Commerce is a business network that promotes members and the community by encouraging economic growth and a superior quality of life. The organization does this by providing networking opportunities, developing strategic partnerships and facilitating and/or leading initiatives that serve this purpose.

Every school year the Indiana State Police receives numerous complaints about school bus stop arm violations from school corporations around the state. The Indiana Department of Education surveys school corporations annually for stop arm violations on one given day, and reports those numbers to the National Association of State Directors for Pupil Transportation Services (NASDPTS).\n\nThere are just over 16,000 school buses on the road in Indiana, and according to the yearly statistics, as the number of school buses on the road has increased, so has the number of school bus stop arm violations.\n\nThe Indiana State Police would like to remind motorists of the Indiana law concerning school buses, flashing lights and stop arms. Remember, when approaching a school bus, from any direction, which is stopped with its flashing red lights activated and its stop arm extended, motorists must STOP, even on multiple lane undivided highways.\n\nMotorists who are on a highway that is divided by a barrier or unimproved median (i.e. a concrete or cable barrier or a grass median) are required to stop only if they are traveling the same direction as the school bus. If there is no unimproved median or barrier, then all lanes of a highway, in all directions must stop for a school bus stop arm.\n\nWhen approaching a school bus always be prepared to stop and watch for stopped traffic.\n\nDisregarding a school bus stop arm is a serious moving violation and one that school bus drivers are quick to report. Violation of this law is a Class \"A\" infraction and is punishable by a maximum fine of up to $10,000.\n\nThe Indiana State Police is committed to the safety of our children, motorists and highways, and will continue our enforcement and education efforts to ensure that safety. To learn more about national stop arm violation statistics you may access the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services web site at http://www.nasdpts.org/StopArm/index.html\n\nI-70 Pavement Patching Scheduled for Wayne County\n\nPosted August 8, 2018\n\nThe Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is scheduled to close the right lane on I-70 eastbound from between mile marker 144 to 146 (from east of Centerville Rest Area to east of Centerville Road exit 145) to complete pavement patching.\n\nThe lane closure is anticipated for Friday, Aug. 10, weather permitting, and is expected to be completed by Monday, Aug. 13.\n\nStay informed\n\nFollow @INDOTEast on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nSubscribe to receive text and email alerts about INDOT projects and services at alerts.indot.in.gov.\n\nLearn about highway work zones and other traffic alerts at indot.carsprogram.org, 1-800-261-ROAD (7623) or 511 from a mobile phone.\n\nReid Health in the Community Is Focus of August Medical Monday\n\nPosted August 9, 2018\n\nThe August Medical Monday features two key team members involved in Reid Health community outreach.\n\nAngela Cline, director of Reid Health Community Benefit, and Sharrie Harlin, Community Outreach, will share about their areas and roles in the health system's outreach work in the region.
