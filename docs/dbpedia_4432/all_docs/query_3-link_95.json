This body of work has been created since retiring and returning to the Cape. The work expresses her love of living near the ocean, her love of family, and her connection to the world.\n\nSally grew up in East Falmouth, then at age 12 moved to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. There she took private art lessons from a local artist. Throughout her education she always pursued art.\n\nFast forward to 2009, Sally lived and worked as a Paralegal in Sacramento. This is when her artist's journey truly began. She began weekly classes with Patris Miller at Patris Studio and Gallery. She took these weekly classes for 7 years. In addition to these weekly classes Sally took numerous workshops with Michael Siegel, Salvador Victor, Abigail VanCannon, Victoria Brooks, Scott Martin, and Thomas Starnes.\n\nIn Sacramento, Sally regularly participated in Second Saturday sessions painting Live Model and participated in local Plein Air paint outs. She also participated in Student Art shows where she sold her work.Sally was a member of the California Arts Club and is now a member of the Cape Cod Art Association.\n\nFrida Kahlo said, \"I paint flowers so they will not die.\" Sally paints memories so they will not fade. Each brush stroke recalls these moments.\n\nSally Gruber's art will be on display for the month of August, with select pieces available for purchase. A portion of proceeds benefit the library."
