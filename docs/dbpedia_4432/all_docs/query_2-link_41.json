        "text": "Carol Abohatab – Campbell, CA\n\nFrom the beginning of her career, Carol was destined to blaze a trail through the indoor marching arts. With early affiliations to groups like Quasar, Erte, and State Street Review, her abilities as a performer and educator would shape the movement programs of many of WGI’s most iconic participating groups.\n\nSince then, she has taught at Emerald Marquis, San Jose Raiders, SCV Winter guard, and many different local area high schools. In addition to teaching the next generation of WGI, she shares her love for the activity through adjudication, dedicated to upholding the standard for excellence that she helped to set throughout her career.\n\nWayne Harris – San Francisco, CA\n\nHarris found his love for the marching arts early in his life but didn’t get involved in the winter scene until 1972. While taking acting classes in Canada, Harris realized the techniques he was learning could easily apply to the marching arts performances he enjoyed watching and teaching so much.\n\nOver the following decades, he taught countless performers how to create a storyline through their facial expressions and body language, influencing generations of the activity with his knowledge of storytelling. He continues this practice with many different groups to this day, pushing the boundaries of creativity and expression on the performance floor.\n\nRosie Miller Queen – Huntington Beach, CA\n\nEvery once in a while, an individual comes along with an unparalleled sense of creativity, attention to detail, and dedication to excellence that fuels the growth and evolution of the activity. Rosie Miller Queen is a fierce advocate for the indoor marching arts, and her influence can be seen across decades of WGI’s organizational and competitive scenes.\n\nThe marching arts played a significant role in Rosie’s life and helped shape her into who she is today. Throughout her many roles in the activity as a performer, educator, designer, adjudicator, and mentor, she has continued inspiring those around her.\n\nEileen Cunningham – Dorchester, MA\n\nEileen Cunningham is a WGI lifer. If that term could apply to one person’s service to one guard, it certainly applies here.\n\nEileen joined St Ann’s in 1965. She has been involved with the organization ever since, influencing thousands of lives in the process. Under her leadership, the organization had an eight-year run with multiple guards in Finals from 1995-2002. In 1998, alone, St. Ann’s had three groups in Finals at the World Championships.\n\nWilliam Harty – Glenn Ellyn, IL\n\nFrom attending the initial setup meetings while WGI was still a concept, to contributing towards the development of WGI’s judging philosophy, William Harty has held a crucial role in shepherding the activity into what it is today. Beyond Harty’s behind-the-scenes accomplishments, he served as a WGI Board member and had a very active career in forming and directing the Chicago-based Guardsmen Winter Guard, which was well known for creating thematic, crowd-pleasing shows.\n\nDaniel Wiles – Avon, IN\n\nFollowing more than three decades of unparalleled work as a performer, instructor, and designer, Daniel Wiles has become a mainstay for WGI. His innovative mind and groundbreaking work has helped guide groups such as Lincoln-Way HS and Southport HS to become gold medalists, and Avon HS to ten different WGI medal placements. Daniel’s passion, leadership and vision have impacted WGI history for years to come.\n\nTom Beresford – Poughquag, NY\n\nTom Beresford is an accomplished instructor and designer, working with the Sunrisers and Bridgemen Drum & Bugle Corps, along with many other bands on the east coast. Within WGI, Beresford’s positions have included Regional Director, Contest Administrator for Regionals and World Championships, serving with the Site Management Committee, WGI Strategic Planning Committee, and the Steering Committee. Beresford is highly respected by colleagues and friends, especially in the marching arts for his devotion and wisdom throughout the decades.\n\nTim Fairbanks – Dayton, OH\n\nTim Fairbanks brought Centerville High School to their first WGI Percussion World Championships in 1998. They would go on to win the Gold Medal at World Championships in 1999. A few years later, he began working with a new line known as Rhythm X. Within the next twenty years, Fairbanks earned seven Gold Medals and many Silver and Bronze Medals.

Fairbanks is currently Vice President of the Percussion Division. While this honor is bestowed based on Fairbank’s lofty achievements, he is still in his prime as a designer, and fans can look forward to viewing his creations for many seasons to come.\n\nMichael Shapiro – Lake Balboa, CA\n\nShapiro’s World Class marching career began with the Alliance of Miami in 1987, where he performed until 1992, spending his summers with Spirit of Atlanta and Madison Scouts, respectively. After his formative years as a performer, Michael taught and assisted at The Company and Chimeras. Later, he began teaching in Ohio with Carroll High School. His career would span across the country as he taught the likes of Centerville High School, Diamond Bar High School, and Crown Guard, to name only a few. In more recent years, Shapiro has continued to captivate audiences and take home the highest rankings in the activity with his work with groups such as Corona and Tarpon Springs. Shapiro is known within the winter guard community for his masterful musicality and unique conceptualization. His creative voice is bright and distinct, recognizable to anyone familiar with his work. Many of Shapiro’s students have gone on to become top-notch designers and teachers themselves. Shapiro pushes the geographical boundaries of the activity with influence in North America, Europe, and Asia. Over the past 17 years, Shapiro has helped shape Mayflower into a consistent WGI World Class Finalist. He has been a part of carefully shaping and nurturing the color guard community in the UK.\n\nPeggy Twiggs – Revere, MA\n\nIn 1967, Twiggs began marching in Drum Corps International with the IC Reveries, later called the 27th Lancers, where she spun flag until her age out season in 1973. It was during this time that the famous “Peggy” spin came to fruition. Peggy started developing “routines” for the flags and once her drill instructor saw what she was doing, she was asked to create a “trick flag” line. The flag line began learning all kinds of spins and tosses, which led to the “Peggy” spin being incorporated into the 27th Lancers’ 1972 show. Since then, the “Peggy” spin has also been used over the years in programs all around the world. This spin left a monumental mark by adding a new level of technicality to the activity. After aging out of drum and bugle corps, Peggy spent her time teaching local color guards and in 1978 she became involved in the first ever season of Winter Guard International. Since the inception of WGI, she has left her mark on many incredible groups that have taken the floor at World Championships. Peggy’s legacy is not limited to her contributions to color guard technique, as her teaching style has left an immense impact on all who have had the privilege of working with her.\n\nJonathan Vanderkolff – Bloomington, IN\n\nJon marched with the crosstown Kiwanis Kavaliers; then, as a member of the Garfield Cadets in the 1980s. He majored in music and graduated with an honors degree from the New England Conservatory. His eye for innovation and detail soon propelled him into the elites in the field of visual design. Vanderkolff designed Star of Indiana’s iconic 1993 Barber and Bartok show, which continues to influence drill writers to this day. He has served as Visual Designer for the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps since 2013 and helped the group win their first DCI championship last August. Other notable corps who have marched his drills include the Madison Scouts and Ventures.

His work with Santa Clara Vanguard earned Championships in 2009, 2011, and 2015. During this time he was also elected by the Color Guard Advisory Board to serve on the Steering Committee for three consecutive terms. Jon worked to broaden the design and effect captions judging criteria to reward creative and unique programs.\n\nJC Connor – Crestview, Florida\n\nSouthern native JC Connor was a valued pioneer and relentless contributor to the WGI organization. During his time, JC served the activity in many executive capacities. He became WGI’s Southern Regional Director in 1983 and held that position for 16 years, overseeing massive growth of winter guards in southern states. This was largely due to his efforts to create a separate WGI Scholastic division out of the previous “one division fits all” format of WGI’s earlier years. The addition of a new scholastic division contributed to a massive growth of units in the southern region and eventually all across the country. His continued mission of promoting the Scholastic division donned him the “Champion of Scholastic Units.” Although JC is no longer with us physically, his decades of influences to the organization will continue to flourish for years to come.\n\nCharles Gumbert – Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nCharles Gumbert known to many as “Charlie” is the Director of The Pride of Cincinnati Winter Guard (POC).
