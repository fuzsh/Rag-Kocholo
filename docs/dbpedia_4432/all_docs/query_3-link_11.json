Founded in 1779, Nashville has grown from a small settlement into a bustling city that's a hub for music, healthcare, and education.

This picturesque setting offers plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities, from boating and fishing on the river to hiking and picnicking in the numerous parks and green spaces around the city. The climate here features hot summers and mild winters, typical of the region, allowing residents to enjoy the outdoors year-round.\n\nThe economy in Nashville is dynamic and growing, with healthcare, education, and music being the leading sectors.
