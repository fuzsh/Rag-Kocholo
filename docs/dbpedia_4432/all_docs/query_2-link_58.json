        "text": "#3 Choice (out of what will be a top 20) - Norwin HS (The Knights of Norwin) from North Huntingdon, PA\n\nNorwin has participated in BOA every year since 1979, with the exception of 1992. They are one of the most successful bands in BOA at the regional level. As of 2019, they have been a regional finalist over 75 times, more than any other band. They have won over 35 regional class titles and as of 2019 have a total of 29 BOA regional titles, more than any other band. Norwin has actually held the distinction of being the band with the most BOA regional wins every year since 1980. In 1980, they became the first band to win two BOA regionals in the same season and in 2012 they became the first band to win three BOA regionals in the same season. They are also the only band to have won at least one BOA regional title in each of the 5 decades of BOA's existence. While their regional wins over the last 18 years or so have been from regionals that are not as competitive as other parts of the country, that is not the case for their regional wins during the 1980s when there were far fewer regionals held and the eastern regionals tended to be among the more competitive. During the 1980s, Norwin won 11 regional titles, more than double any other band in that decade.\n\nAt Grand Nationals, Norwin is a 9 time finalist (81-85, 87, 89, 90, 95), a three time Open Class Champion and the 1982 Grand National Champion. During the 1980s, Norwin was a GN finalist more times than any other band. Norwin's biggest success came under the direction of LJ Hancock who led the band from 1976 to 2001. During the first half of the 1980s, Norwin's performances were rock solid. They were also a band that started the season really strong, one of the reasons they won so many regionals. In addition to their powerful sound, they were noted for having an incredible drum line and an awesome rifle line. They were considered GN contentenders in each of their first four trips to nationals (81 - 84) and in addition to their win in 82 were runner up to the title twice. During the late 80s and throughout the 90s, Norwin had a lot of ups and downs, even failing to make GN finals on several occasions. Some notable performances did include their last three appearances in GN finals. During the 89 and 90 seasons, they did Disney themed shows (actually I believe they did a few more in the early 90s). This was the early years of the themed based shows. It was rumored that Norwin had a Disney sponsorship which gave them a big budget for props. They had large props (something that was not common in those days) and had guard and band members come out as Disney characters from time to time. While shows have become much more imaginative and sophisticated since then, during that time period, the Norwin Disney shows were quite innovative. The whole idea of these bigger budget shows with props and costuming would gain in popularity in the coming years.\n\nThe controversial departure and subsequent passing of long time director LJ Hancock in the early 2000s obviously hit the program hard. Norwin has since had a few director changes over the years. Their school district has also seen a drop in enrollment, which probably also means some drop in financial support. These things have likely posed some challenges in recent years. However, Norwin has remained a strong competitor in BOA events across the northeast and has had several good shows over the years. Their only trip to GN since 1997 was in 2011 when they finished 19th in semi finals. I hope this program continues to remain strong for years to come.\n\nA Brief History of the Norwin Band\n\nLJ Hancok BOA Hall of Fame\n\n#4 Choice - Marian Catholic HS (Spartans), from Chicago Heights, IL\n\nYes, I am sure this is no surprise to anyone. As of the end of the end of the 2019 season, the following are their accolades: At the BOA regional level, Marian has been a finalist over 40 times and a regional class champion over 20 times. They have won 5 BOA regional titles. During the 1980s, Marian won five consecutive summer national titles. At Grand Nationals, there is no other band that has had more success. Marian Catholic is a 34 time Grand National finalist (1984 to 2017), more times than any other band by a long shot. Marian has won 21 Grand National Class titles (20 AA and 1 AAA), which is more than double any other band. They have also won the Grand National title 7 times (85,87,88,89,94,97,2000), more than any other band. This includes becoming the first band to win three consecutive Grand National titles.\n\nMarian has had one head director throughout all of this success, Mr. Greg Bimm, who has directed the Marian Catholic marching band since 1977. I think if you ask those outside of the program what is the secret to Marian's success, they would say the genius that is Greg Bimm. Keep in mind that he has also been their primary music arranger and drill writer for decades. In various interviews with Mr Bimm that I have read or seen, Mr. Bimm credits the hard work of Marian's students and the support from the Marian school administration and parents. The story goes that Mr. Bimm became director of Marian in 1977 when they were a small and struggling band program. He then built the band program to become a national power house by the mid 1980s. He has managed to sustain the program at this level for decades. Some unique aspects about the Marian Catholic marching band is that their students come into the program as freshman from all different middle school programs throughout mostly the southern Chicago suburbs with varying degrees of skill. Mr. Bimm must then take those students and bring them up to the level that is Marian. Marian's marching band also heavily uses student leaders (mainly seniors) to assist in the instruction of the band, especially during sectionals. These facts make their success even more impressive.\n\nDuring the 1980s, no band won more Grand National titles than Marian. They were a pioneering band in the art of making a marching band sound more like a symphonic band. The depth, the phrasing and the nuances of their music were exceptional. They also proved that a marching band does not always have to play loud to be effective. They superbly illustrated this in their 1989 show where they performed Webber's \"Pie Jesu\" in the mid section of the show. At that point in time, I don't think another high school marching band put forth so much emotion on the field. Another area that Marian was making strides in during the 1980s was in visual difficulty. It seemed that each season from 84 through 89, their drill became a little more difficult and complex and their guard routines became more challenging; this as their music performances got better and better.\n\nRight from the start of the 1990s, and persisting through the rest of the decade and into the 2000s, Marian took things to a whole new level. They began playing more complex music and musical arrangements. I would say they probably played more notes than any other band. They were also among one of the bands who were testing the ability of students to tackle things like frequent tempo changes and mixed metering. Many of their music performances would fluctuate from fast and furious, to soft and subtle, then back to fast and furious. The technical ability that their band members exhibited was amazing. Often times they would take on music selections that no other band would dare try to accomplish on the field. It was almost as if they would take insanely difficult music, turn it inside out and then play it. Their shows also packed a ton of visual difficulty into them as well. Marian was constantly in motion, often times doing rapid directional shifts, blind drill passes and other complex drill moves. Their visual designs also packed a ton of symbolism into the drill. Due to the difficulty of their shows, it would usually take the band until right up to Grand Nationals to perfect it. This is why since 1990 they have only won one regional title, despite picking up three more GN titles and finishing in the top five in finals numerous times. Even in the 2010s, as shows have taken on a significantly larger production value, Marian has managed to keep up with the times. The level of creativity in their 2011 The Passion Tree show and 2015's String Theory are two prime examples.\n\nIt still has taken some getting used to the fact that Marian has failed to make GN finals the last two seasons. Keep in mind they still have had top 20 finished in Semi Finals. One of the reasons for this is of course the fact that Grand Nationals and BOA in general has become significantly more competitive. I would actually say that their 2019 GN semi finals performance would have made finals 10 years ago. Another challenge that Marian has faced is declining enrollment for over a decade. I think that in the 2019 season their high school enrollment dropped to under 1000 students, making them a significantly smaller school in comparison to the sizes of the schools that the bands finishing in the top half of GN semi finals come from. I suspect there may also be some decline in enrollment and/or funding cuts to the elementary and middle school programs that feed into Marian. These factors and the inevitable future retirement of Greg Bimm will be challenges that Marian will have to face this next decade. I have heard Mr Bimm say in interviews that the Marian Catholic marching band would not have been as strong a band without BOA. I would in turn say that BOA would not be what it is today without Marian Catholic.\n\nChicago Tribune video on Marian from 2009\n\n2005 - Greg Bimm BOA Hall of Fame\n\n2012 GN clip\n\n2013 GN clip\n\n2014 Gn clip\n\n2015 GN clip\n\n2016 GN clip\n\n2017 GN clip\n\nA few select Greg Bimm interviews\n\n2009\n\n2012\n\n2013 - GN finals\n\n2015 - GN finals warm up\n\n#5 Choice - Westfield HS (The Big Red Band) from Houston, TX\n\nDuring the 1981 to 1982 school year, Spring South (which I believe was just for 9th graders) was converted into a full 4 year high school and renamed Westfield HS. In 1982, Philip Geiger was hired as marching band director. Within just a few short years, Mr. Geiger took this band to their first BOA Grand National where they were runner up to Marian Catholic. Mr. Geiger directed the marching band from 1982 into the middle of the 2000s. The band's biggest success came during his tenure. Westfield has been a BOA regional finalist around 30 times and have won 9 regional titles, including the very first BOA San Antonio Super Regional in 2003. Between 1984 and 1999, Westfield attended one Texas regional per season and placed either first or second every year. Westfield only attended four Grand Nationals. Had they attended more frequently between the mid 80s and mid 2000s they would have racked up many more GN finals appearances than just four. Their appearances in 1985, 1990 and 1995 garnered them second place finishes each time and two BOA Class titles. They are the first Texas band to be a GN finalist. During their fourth and final GN appearance in 2003, they picked up another class title and were crowned Grand National Champion.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Texas still had many strong marching bands (of course nothing like today). The strong music education programs in the state and high attendance at high school football games (incentive for the marching band to play well) contributed to this. During the course of the 70s and 80s, as more bands began to take on the corps style programs, Texas bands for the most part seemed to fall a little behind what top level BOA bands were doing, especially in the visual aspect. Then came Westfield. They played more difficult and sophisticated music. They also brought in well renown drill designers, like Steve Brubaker. So not only were they playing more challenging music, they were marching to far more complex and difficult drill. During the latter half of the 1980s, Westfield was said to have inspired many band programs in Texas (and future band directors and designers in the state). For a few of the years in the late 80s, there was simply no other Texas band that was at the level of Westfield. They proved that you could still get a high quality ensemble sound while at the same time delivering a superb visual performance. During the 1990s, other power house Texas programs emerged; neighboring Spring was among the earliest to rise to the level of Westfield. During the entire 1990s, Westfield still churned out solid shows year after year and continued to inspire future Texas band programs. Certainly the quality of their sound and overall music performance is what they are most known for. In addition to brass and woodwinds, they also had an amazing percussion section; all qualities that have since become a signature of top level Texas bands in BOA. Westfield also showcased some instrumental features that were not too common at the time they did them, but would then become common; like the french horn solos in 1990 and the bassoon ensemble in 2003.\n\nWhile the 2000s saw Westfield slip in placement at the Texas BOA regionals, they had one amazing season in 2003 where they finally picked up the Grand National title, which had eluded them in their three prior trips to Grand Nationals. The retirement of Mr Geiger in the mid 2000s and a gradual decline in Spring ISD music programs had huge impacts on Westfield. As a result, their BOA participation has dwindled this decade. Taking into consideration all of the Texas programs that were inspired by what Westfield did in the 1980s and 1990s and seeing what Texas bands are now accomplishing in BOA, I count Westfield as one of the most influential bands in BOA history.\n\nWestfield 1990 Season Documentary - This is a fairly long (2 hour) documentary that goes through the entire 1990 season.

Since 1984, they have participated in both BOA regionals and Grand Nationals every single year. In fact, Centerville and Marian Catholic are the only two bands that have attended Grand Nationals every year since 1984. As of 2019, Centerville has been a BOA regional finalist at least 70 times. In fact, they may actually be second to Norwin in terms of total number of regional finals appearances as they have typically attended multiple BOA regionals per season. They have won 20 BOA regional titles. Between 2002 and 2005, they won 8 consecutive BOA regionals. At Grand Nationals, they have been a semi finalist every year of the semi finals era except one. They are a 19 time Grand National finalist (84,86-89, 92-2000, 03-05, 08,09) and are the 1992 Grand National Champions.\n\nThe Centerville HS marching band has a legacy that goes back to the early 20th century, when parades and small drill teams were the big thing for high school marching bands. Centerville was transformed into a national calibur competitive marching band when Wayne Markworth became director in the 1970s. He directed the band through the 2004 season when he retired. It was under Mr. Markworth that Centerville developed into one of the biggest perennial favorites in BOA. During the 70s and early 80s, jazz was often played during the up tempo part of marching band shows when the band stood still (or mostly still), known as the concert piece. In 1984, Centerville took this one step further and debuted an all jazz show and renamed themselves the Centerville Jazz Band (which they still call themselves today). Jazz would remain their main repertoire. Centerville played all kinds of jazz over the years, including big band era, funk, blues; they even infused jazz with some classical and Latin music. I imagine doing an all jazz show was not easy, but Centerville really played some great jazz. Centerville always seemed to be more about pleasing the audience rather than pleasing the judges, and the audience responded. During the 80s and 90s, when military style was still heavily present, Centerville took on a much more laid back attitude with their performance; they had to play it cool. That's not to say that they were sloppy. In fact several of their shows, especially during the 90s and 2000s, had superb visual quality and featured a world class guard. Dr Tim Lautzenheiser once referred to Centerville as the desert in Grand National finals; a seemingly perfect way to describe them. They were one of the early bands to use electronics and synthesizers in the pit. They also did a lot for saxophones in marching band. They typically had a large saxophone section in relation to their band size and really used them well, not to mention some of the amazing sax solos and ensembles that appeared throughout Centerville's history. They were also one of the earliest bands to have their soloists or ensemble groups wear sunglasses; again had to add that cool factor. Even today, when I hear a great jazz soloist in BOA, I think back to Centerville.\n\nOne of the success stories with Centerville has been the fact that the retirement of Mr. Markworth did not lead to the demise of the band program. Since his retirement, Centerville went on to make three more appearances in Grand National finals and won several more BOA regional titles. They have also been near consistent GN semi finalists and regional finalists. Even though they have not made GN finals since 2009, they continue to put forth strong and entertaining shows, although there have been a few years where they have strayed a bit farther from their jazz roots. Wayne's son Andrew took over the band program the first few years after Wayne's retirement. Since 2007, they have been under the direction of Brandon Barrometti. Their 20th place finish in the hyper competitive 2019 Grand National semi finals suggests they still have many years of success ahead of them.\n\nA brief history of the band from their website\n\n2007 - Wayne Markworth BOA Hall of Fame\n\nWayne Markworth BOA Hall of Fame - 2007 Video"
