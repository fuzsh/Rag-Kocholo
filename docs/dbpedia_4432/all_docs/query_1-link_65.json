        "text": "Indiana Department of Transportation plans to close its Centerville Welcome Center for about two years to make an estimated $42 million in improvements.\n\nThe project near Mile Marker 143 on westbound Interstate 70 is part of INDOT’s 10-year rest area and welcome center improvement plan.\n\nThe Centerville Welcome Center will be completely reconstructed with the addition of several amenities, including a children’s play area, adult recreation area, walking path, dog park and interior interactive exhibits, according to Kyleigh Cramer, public relations director for INDOT’s East Central District.\n\nThe new facility will be inspired by Indiana’s basketball heritage and history with the sport.\n\nAfter bids are reviewed and awarded, groundbreaking is expected this fall to begin the two-year construction schedule.\n\nCenterville’s welcome center was built in 1975 and currently offers parking spots for motor vehicles and semis. Today’s amenities include restrooms, vending machines and brochures for tourists.\n\nINDOT will upgrade the sanitary lift station as part of the construction project. The Town of Centerville will continue to maintain the lift station, Cramer said.\n\nCenterville’s town manager, Kevin Slick, said at council’s Jan. 9 meeting that he had met earlier that day with law and engineering professionals regarding INDOT’s rest area plans and the lift station improvements.\n\nSlick estimated the lift station upgrade will take at least a year to complete.\n\nINDOT plans to invest more than $600 million into 21 of its rest areas and welcome centers around the state by the end of fiscal year 2034.\n\nINDOT currently operates 26 rest areas or welcome centers in 17 areas around the state.\n\nFor more information, call INDOT Customer Service at 855-463-6848 or visit indot4u.com.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the January 17 2024 print edition of the Western Wayne News."
