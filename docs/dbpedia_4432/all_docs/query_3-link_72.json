        "text": "The Centerville Small Area Plan will explore how Centerville could grow over the next 20 years. It will focus on how redevelopment can bring new amenities (e.g., retail, restaurants, and new parks and plazas), improve transportation (including transit, trails, and roadways), and provide new housing for current and future Centerville residents.\n\nYour input is critical to the plan’s success! With your help, we can craft a vision of Centerville that captures the needs and desires of the community.\n\nWhat aspects of Centerville would you like to see improved? What would make Centerville a stronger community? Get engaged and share your ideas with us at 2045UnifiedPlan@TSW-Design.com.\n\nThe 2045 Unified Plan sets the vision for future growth and development in Gwinnett County, imagining the county as a tapestry of Daily Communities — places where people can meet their daily needs and access retail, entertainment, and open space within a 15-minute trip from home. Each community is unique based on its size, location, history, and culture. Centerville is one of Gwinnett’s 87 Daily Communities. The plan highlights how thoughtful redevelopment can create healthy, strong Daily Communities across the county. Learn more from the 2045 Unified Plan."
