The streets were originally 100 feet wide, but with the increased activity in town when it became the county seat, the width was decreased to 65 feet. Buildings with common walls were erected in front of original buildings. The original buildings could then be reached through the archways.\n\nThe five existing Archways are unusual in the interior of the United States. The Centerville Archways date from 1823 through 1836.\n\nBackenstoes Archway, circa 1835 at 139 East Main Street\n\nDill Archway, circa 1830 at 109 S. Morton Avenue\n\nShortridge Archway, circa 1820 at 205 West Main Street\n\nLantz Archway, circa 1823 at 212 West Main Street\n\nMalone Archway, circa 1836 at 119 West Main Street\n\nLog cabin courthouse\n\nCenterville is home to Wayne County's original log courthouse which was moved to Centerville and restored in 1998. It is the only original log courthouse still standing in the Northwest Territory.\n\nThe house at 319 West Main in Centerville, Indiana was home to Indiana's Civil War governor, Oliver P. Morton. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFor a fun bit of history, read about the \"war\" between Centerville and Richmond over the location of the county seat in 1873.\n\nHistory of Centerville from the Town of Centerville\n\nSome facts about us\n\nThe Mansion House is located along National Road\n\nHistoric Centerville, Inc. owns and works on the Mansion House Inn, the Salisbury Log Courthouse, and Centerville’s historic railroad shanty. It is important to keep these building in good shape for generations to come. All fourth grade students tour the buildings and learn the important place they play in the town’s history.
