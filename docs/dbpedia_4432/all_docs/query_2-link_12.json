        "text": "The History of Drake Hall\n\nDesign & Construction\n\nD.C. Bradley, a prominent banker and businessman built the sprawling home as the primary residence for his family, located near the heart of Centerville, Iowa in 1909. Des Moines based architects Frank Wetherell & Alvah Gage designed the home in 1908. This team of renown Iowa architects Wetherell & Gage had previously designed the Appanoose County Courthouse located in the nearby town square, which was dedicated on September 12, 1904.\n\nMaster architect Frank E. Wetherell (Sept 5, 1869 - Oct 6, 1961) was responsible for numerous buildings, schools, libraries, homes and Mason's temples throughout the state of Iowa. Frank Wetherell designed twelve of the Carnegie libraries in Iowa, and fourty-four properties in Oskaloosa. In Centerville, in addition to the county courthouse, Wetherell also designed the local high school, Drake Avenue Christian Church and the chapel at Oakland Cemetery.\n\nThe August 1st, 1908 Improvement Bulletin announced plans for the Bradley home: \"Smith, Wetherell & Gage, architects, are making plans for a 14-room residence for D.C. Bradley at Centerville, Iowa. It is to be of pressed brick, tile roof, hot water heat. Cost, thirty-thousand dollars.\"\n\nHowever, sometime in the design process, the plans significantly changed from that newspaper announcement. It is believed that the design was changed to reflect a uniquely Japanese aesthetic after the big sensation for all things Japanese, introduced by the 1904 St. Louis World Exhibition's re-creation of a traditional Japanese village.\n\nIn the end, the Bradley home ended up costing a hundred-thousand dollars (over three-and-a-half million dollars today), with the distinctive hand-hewn Bedford Limestone on the exterior with wavy, Japanese pagoda like green-tiled roof consisting of over twenty-two rooms covering over 10,000 square feet of living space. Additionally, there is a fully walkable basement and large two-story carriage house made to look like a Japanese teahouse.\n\nExterior of the House\n\nThe exterior of the Bradley home is imposing and architecturally unique. Country Homes magazine featured the Bradley home in its July-august 1921 edition. The article describes the home as a “delightfully unconventional” and “picturesque,” with a “sturdy individuality.” The magazine struggles to identify the home’s exact architectural style, arguing that it may have “originated a very desirable type in itself.” However, it goes on to say the influence on the design is “definitely Japanese,” and that the exterior “might be termed ‘Dutch Colonial,’ but for a saucy curl outwards of the roof at the eaves.”\n\nA prominent feature of the home is its massively built walls. Constructed of the finest Bedford Limestone, a high-quality limestone mined in South-Central Indiana. The stone blocks were roughly hewn at the quarry, then brought to Iowa by train and hand-cut on site by two Italian master stonemasons.\n\nDefining features of the front of the home include two high chimneys, clerestory, hip roof and an extended front veranda that wraps around the side of the home. The rear elevation of the home is notable for its irregular, almost rambling formation of gables on the upper stories and multiple balconies.\n\nIn the rear of the home stands a smaller building that originally served as the carriage house and chauffeur’s dwelling/workshop. The back yard originally housed an expensive large greenhouse surrounded by lush formal gardens including roses and small shrubs, alternating with informal groups of larger shrubs, masses of flowers and groves of ornamental trees.\n\nDavid Campbell (D.C.) Bradley\n\nAugust 13, 1858 - February 2, 1928 (69)\n\nD.C. Bradley was a prominent banker, businessman and civic leader in Southern Iowa. He was the president of Centerville’s First National Bank and held banking interests in Fairfield, Seymour, Promise City, Exline, Mystic, Moravia, Bloomfield and six other Iowa banks.\n\nAdditionally, D.C. held controlling interests in Centerville Light & Traction Company, a streetcar and electrical power company; Pure Ice Company, and ice producing plant, and Centerville Brick Company, a brick manufacturer. He also owned coal mines, including the Iowa Block Mine in Exline and the Barrett and the Garfield coal mines in Mystic, Iowa. He also had an extensive financial portfolio of agricultural and real estate holdings, co-owning one of the largest hog farms in Iowa and engaged in various agricultural processing and shipping businesses.\n\nMr. Bradley was considered a pillar of the Centerville community, serving both on the Centerville City Council and the Centerville Board of Education. He was active in the Presbyterian church and in politics. He belonged to the Masonic fraternity, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks, and was a founder of the local Kiwanis Club.\n\nD.C. Bradley was known to be “outgoing and very public-spirited.” However the beginning of the Great Depression devastated his interests financially. D.C., distraught over his rapidly sinking fortunes never recovered his financial standing and died in his sleep at the age of 69 in 1928.\n\nGolden Age Nursing Home\n\n(1955 to 1963)\n\nIn September of 1955, Jack O. and Mabel Phillips along with Grover and Nellie Phillips purchased the Bradley home and established a nursing home. In December of 1956, Howard W. and Eloise Shaffer bought the property and the nursing home business, branding it the Golden Age Nursing Home.\n\nEloise was a nurse by training and oversaw the home’s operations while husband Howard was the facilities manager.\n\nThe Schaffers operated the nursing home at the Bradley home until 1963. Records show that they had as many as 62 residents and 20 employees at one time while at the Bradley home. Recollections from family members are that patients who were no longer mobile lived on the third floor in the ballroom, which afforded more mobile patients the lower two stories.\n\nThe Bradley home served as the Golden Age Nursing Home until 1962. At this time, both the nursing home and Centerville Community College were looking to expand their operations. Centerville Community College purchased the home for $50,000. The Golden Age Nursing Home built a new facility that opened in 1963 on the South side of Centerville, along Highway 5, where it still stands today.\n\nELEMENTARY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION BUILDING\n\n(1970 to 1999)\n\nIn 1970, after Centerville Community College vacated the Bradley home, the Centerville Community School District moved its administrative offices into the home, retaining the name Fannon Hall.\n\nAt the same time, the home became home to Fannon Hall Elementary. When it opened, it included a kindergarten class, two first grade classes and two second grade classes. The schoolchildren walked to nearby Central Elementary for their lunches, and the same elementary school principal oversaw Central, Fannon Hall, and Lincoln Elementary schools. Local residents recall a children’s sandbox in the enclosed veranda of the Bradley home for the students.\n\nFaced with a leaking roof, accessibility issues coupled with rising maintenance and utility costs, the Centerville Community School District in the late 1990s started looking for a way to leave the Bradley home and build a more affordable administration office. Enter Morgan Cline, a former resident of nearby Exline, Iowa - a wealthy advertising executive, and Centerville-area philanthropist. On January 8th, 2000, Cline purchased the Bradley home for $75,000, with an additional $75,000 donation to the Centerville School District. Cline’s generosity allowed the school district to build its current administrative offices just north of the Centerville Historic Courthouse Square.\n\nMORGAN CLINE & PRESERVATION\n\n(2000 to 2020)\n\nMorgan E. Cline (August 26, 1932 - April 20, 2014) was a philanthropist, entrepreneur, advertising executive, and real estate preservationist.\n\nBorn in Exline, Iowa in a poor household, Morgan went on to become a pharmacist, and co-founded the Cline, Davis & Mann advertising agency in New York City. Over 17 years, the company grew to become a dominant force in the pharmaceutical advertising field. The company launched both iconic brands such as Viagra and Lipitor, two of the most successful pharmaceutical advertising campaigns of all time.\n\nFollowing his business career, Morgan sought to give back to the community that raised him and gave him his strong values. A boon to Appanoose County, Morgan bought and restored many historic buildings that were badly in need of restoration and preservation. He also founded a kidney dialysis center, a community sports complex, and projects in his own hometown of nearby Exline.\n\nWhen it came to buying and restoring the Bradley home, fortunately the previous uses of the mansion had not altered important architectural and decorative features. The original stained glass, fireplaces and fine wood flooring and paneling remained incredibly intact. Sadly, the original frescoed ceilings in the bedrooms had been painted over and all of the fine furnishings had been sold off over the decades. However, thanks to Morgan’s significant investment, the Bradley home still provides a strong idea of what the home was like in its glory days. After remodeling the home, Morgan established the Shoppes at Bradley Hall as a way to attract visitors to the restored home as well as to the city of Centerville and Appanoose County.\n\nMorgan wanted to ensure his legacy of philanthropy to be continued even after his death. In his will, he established the Morgan E. Cline Foundation to continue his good works in Appanoose County.\n\nA NEW ERA\n\n(2020 to Present)\n\nIn early 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic severely affected many retail establishments, and after nearly 20 years the Shoppes at Bradley Hall succumbed to the shutdowns and was forced to go out of business. This left the Cline Foundation that owned the property to look at possibly liquidating the Bradley home. In a difficult business decision, the board of directors of the Cline Foundation voted to sell the property to improve cash flow in order to fund various charities and causes that would continue the philanthropy that Morgan wanted to go on.\n\nAfter selling their Orlando home in August of 2021, Kyle Shiroma and Gerhard Spillmann began looking for their “forever home.” After viewing some promising homes in Indiana and Pennsylvania, the couple decided to look at the Bradley home. Upon entering the Bradley home, the couple immediately fell in love with the architecture and the beautifully preserved interiors. They were especially appreciative at how welcoming and helpful the people of Centerville are, so the couple submitted their proposal, with the express intent to preserve and restore the home. The Cline foundation board was excited to learn that the couple’s desire was to be an integral part of the community, and have special events in the future restored gardens which would help bring commerce into Centerville. The Cline Foundation board members felt they found the most ideal home buyers to preserve and restore such an iconic Centerville structure.\n\nGerhard and Kyle are avid collectors of fine antique furniture, fine art and decorative art from the late 1800s to early 1900s, which fit like a hand in glove in the Bradley home. The couple christened their new home “Drake Hall” after the name came to Kyle in a dream as they were looking to purchase a home in Pennsylvania. A drake is a juvenile dragon less than 100 years old according to Japanese mythology. After that deal fell through, the couple looked at Bradley Hall and it just happened to be on Drake Avenue! They took it as a sign that it was meant to be - now the much-beloved home is once again a shining beacon for the city of Centerville."
