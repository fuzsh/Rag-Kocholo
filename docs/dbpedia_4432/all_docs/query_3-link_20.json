After the American Revolution, the Northwest Territory was opened for settlers. The earliest settler in Washington Township was Dr. John Hole. Centerville’s founding fathers, Aaron Nutt, Benjamin Robbins, and Benjamin Archer, traveled from New Jersey, through Pennsylvania, and finally north from Kentucky. The men surveyed John Symmes’s land in 1796 and they chose their own lots. They retrieved their families from Kentucky and settled here over the next couple of years. The rich farmland and limestone quarries made this area an ideal location for starting a new life and many more settlers arrived. Limestone was used in the construction of many early buildings. Several of these historic Stone Buildings still exist today. Montgomery County and Washington Township were established by the legislature when Ohio became a state in 1803. Centerville officially became a town in 1830 and became incorporated as a city in 1968. There are also many important People, Places, and Historical Events of interest that played important roles in shaping our area that have been cataloged and documented by our members."
