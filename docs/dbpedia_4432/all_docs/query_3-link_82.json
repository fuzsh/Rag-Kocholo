        "text": "It would employ up to 600 people. But engineers say it would also create considerable traffic with 344 delivery vans leaving and returning to the warehouse daily, plus 21 larger semi-trucks. A study found that traffic will block some driveways along 21st Avenue with or without the new warehouse. It suggested new medians be built and the timing on traffic lights be adjusted. But engineers say other nearby intersections will continue to function at acceptable levels.\n\nCenterville Mayor D. Love said the city is excited to have Amazon in town.\n\n“We’re definitely excited to say the City of Centerville has an organization like Amazon coming to us to want to be a neighbor. That’s really exciting for us,” said Mayor Love. “Obviously we want to make sure that we’re doing it the right way and we’re doing what’s best for all of our citizens, being mindful of the citizens that live closest to there, but then also being mindful of our entire city.”\n\nA noise study concluded the site will not disturb the expected quiet of homes nearby. Truck loading docks on the west side of the building will be within 500 feet of single family homes. Noise levels will be analyzed after the first year of operation. Amazon would pay for noise mitigation if necessary.\n\n“To me it’s logical to give it some time to see what these noise conditions are and how we address that,” said Council Member Russ Koski. “Why build a wall if it’s not going to make a difference?”\n\nCity officials say they don’t expect noise levels to be a major problem. Amazon hopes to open the facility by fall of 2023."
