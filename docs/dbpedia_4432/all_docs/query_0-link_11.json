        "text": "I like the cozy, safe neighborhood I reside in. I've hardly seen any criminal activity here and we're a bonded community of neighbors. But I'd like the town's recycling plant to be more accessible, since to the general public it usually isn't. Or at least, there aren't trucks that take recycling to the plant for us.\n\nThis town is your average small, midwestern town. It is relatively safe and it has the best schooling test scores in the surrounding counties for its size. However, there really is nothing to do. If boring is what you're looking for then this is the place. You have to drive to the next town, Richmond, just to go out to eat."
