Items such as groceries, prescription medications, and medical devices may be exempt from the sales tax increase. Businesses must update their point-of-sale systems to accurately reflect the new rates and exemptions.\n\nRecent changes to Indiana sales tax\n\nIn 2024, Indiana implemented several changes to its sales tax regulations. These adjustments were part of a broader initiative to streamline tax collection and enhance state revenue. Here’s a summary of the key changes compared to 2023:\n\nSales Tax Rate Increase: On January 1, 2024, Indiana raised its state sales tax rate from 7% to 7.25%. This slight increase aims to bolster state funds for infrastructure and public services. In 2023, the rate was a consistent 7%.\n\nExpanded Taxable Goods and Services: Effective March 1, 2024, Indiana expanded the list of taxable goods and services. Newly taxable items include certain digital goods (like e-books and online streaming subscriptions) and services such as home cleaning and landscaping. In 2023, these digital goods and personal services were largely exempt.\n\nRemote Seller Threshold Adjustment: Beginning July 1, 2024, the threshold for remote sellers to collect Indiana sales tax was lowered from $100,000 to $75,000 in annual gross sales or 200 transactions. In 2023, only remote sellers with over $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions were required to collect sales tax.\n\nMarketplace Facilitator Compliance: As of October 1, 2024, marketplace facilitators are required to comply with more stringent reporting and tax remittance obligations. This change was designed to improve tax compliance among online and multi-state retailers by requiring them to report detailed transaction information to the state. In 2023, compliance requirements for marketplace facilitators were less rigorous, focusing mainly on high-level reporting.\n\nThese changes reflect Indiana's efforts to modernize its tax system and ensure a more consistent revenue stream by adapting to evolving market conditions.\n\nCollecting sales tax in Centerville\n\nIn Indiana, origin-based sales tax collection means the tax rate is determined by the seller's location, whereas destination-based sales tax collection means the tax rate is determined by the buyer's location.\n\nFor Centerville, this distinction affects how businesses calculate and remit taxes. If the city uses an origin-based system, local businesses charge their own city's tax rate. In a destination-based system, businesses charge the buyer’s city's tax rate, requiring precise tracking of customers' locations.\n\nUnderstanding origin vs. destination sales tax collection\n\nIndiana uses a modified origin-based sales tax system for intrastate transactions. This means that the sales tax rate applied is based on the location of the seller, but with certain modifications. Specifically, retailers must collect sales tax based on the rate in effect in the location where the seller has a presence or business location, rather than solely the buyer's location.\n\nReference: Indiana Department of Revenue, Sales Tax Information Bulletin #84 (available at in.gov/dor)\n\nTaxable products in Indiana\n\nCertainly!
