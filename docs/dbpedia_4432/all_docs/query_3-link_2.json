A core suburb of Metro Dayton, its population was 24,240 as of the 2020 census.[5]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the city is located primarily in Montgomery County,[6] a small portion is located in Greene County.[7]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.85 square miles (28.10 km2), of which 10.78 square miles (27.92 km2) is land and 0.07 square miles (0.18 km2) is water.[8]\n\nCenterville and Washington Township voted November 4, 2008 on whether to create a merger commission.[9] The proposed merger commission succeeded in the city but failed in the township.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1796,[10] American explorer Benjamin Robbins founded Centerville, Ohio, naming it after his hometown of Centreville, New Jersey, due to its location between two rivers and its proximity to several other communities. Robbins and two of his brothers chose land in Centerville, with Robbins selecting 160 acres northwest of the town center because of the abundance of springs. During settlement, settlers discovered limestone in Centerville, leading to the replacement of many log cabins with more durable limestone structures. On April 6, 1797, Robbins's family arrived in Centerville from Dry Ridge, Kentucky after ten days of constructing a wagon road, and began assembling houses. Robbins established a log cabin for his family, but during occupancy, the roof was blown away during a storm. Robbins's son, Sam, became the cities first mayor. By 1820, Robbins added a second floor to the house and replaced the base with limestone.[11] In 1803, one-room schoolhouses were established in Centerville, offering education from grades 1 to 6.[citation needed] Benjamin Robbins died on June 3, 1837, and was buried at the Sugar Creek Baptist Cemetery.[12]\n\nIn 1900, the U.S. Post Office changed the town’s name from Centreville to Centerville. On December 2, 1968, Centerville became a city.[11] In 1973, Centerville High School was established.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880274—1890252−8.0%190029015.1%191035321.7%1920335−5.1%193040019.4%194056140.3%195082747.4%19603,490322.0%197010,333196.1%198018,88682.8%199021,08211.6%200023,0249.2%201023,9994.2%202024,2401.0%2023 (est.)25,754[3]6.2%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[19] of 2010, there were 23,999 people, 10,693 households, and 6,694 families living in the city.
