        "text": "Board of Supervisors Vote to Deny Centerville Small Area Plan\n\nThe Goochland County Board of Supervisors voted to deny the Centerville Small Area Plan during their October 4th public hearing.\n\nDuring the Wednesday night public hearing, Timmons Group presented a statistical analysis on the amendments received during the most recent citizen input period. It became apparent that there was no clear consensus on how to proceed. Following the presentation and public comment period, the Goochland County Board of Supervisors voted to deny the Centerville Small Area Plan, thus ending that planning process. The full report presented to the Board of Supervisors is available below:\n\nCenterville Smal Area Plan Citizen Feedback Report and Appendix\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Report Presentation - October 4, 2023\n\nThe Small Area Plan was started in response to the significant growth pressures the County is experiencing, especially in the Centerville area. The County’s Comprehensive Plan addresses Centerville at a high level, however this plan was intended to provide guiding principles for transportation, land use, and community character.\n\nAll information compiled during this planning process, including citizen feedback received during the amendment process, will be archived, and kept on file.\n\nCounty staff have been directed to move on to other projects that had been deferred during the Small Area Plan process, which started in February of 2022. The incoming Board of Supervisors, who will take office in January 2024, will decide when and how to move forward with planning efforts for the Centerville area.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan October 4th Public Hearing Information\n\nThe County finalized the Centerville Small Area Plan Report on Tuesday afternoon, October 3rd, 2023, and has released it publicly. The full report, including the proposed amendments received during the online amendment period, is available at this location.\n\nCenterville Smal Area Plan Citizen Feedback Report and Appendix\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Report Presentation - October 4, 2023\n\nA presentation on the report will occur at the Special Meeting of the Goochland County Board of Supervisors for the Centerville Small Area Plan Public Hearing on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, beginning at 6:00 PM. The Public Hearing will occur in the Board Room (Room 250) of the Goochland County Administration Building located at 1800 Sandy Hook Road, Goochland, VA 23063.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Report to Be Shared\n\nDuring the October 4th Public Hearing\n\nThe Centerville Small Area Plan has been scheduled for a public hearing on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, beginning at 6:00 p.m. in the Board Room (Room 250) of the Goochland County Administration Building located at 1800 Sandy Hook Road, Goochland, VA 23063.\n\nDuring the October 4th public hearing, a report including the proposed amendments received during the online amendment period will be shared with the Board of Supervisors.\n\nThe Goochland County Board of Supervisors deferred consideration of the Centerville Small Area Plan during their August 7th meeting. In response to the many citizens who felt additional time and engagement was needed, the Board directed staff to prepare an avenue for additional public input. An online public amendment proposal period was held via a submission form on the county website from August 11th through September 15th. Through the amendment proposal process a total of 632 amendments and 225 forms were received online.\n\nThe Centerville Small Area Plan encountered difficulty garnering support from the beginning. Given the widely divergent suggestions received in the most recent amendment proposal period, together with the public comments from earlier public hearings and meetings, it has become apparent to staff that there is no clear path forward. County staff appreciate the continued participation from the community in the Centerville Small Area Plan process.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Public Hearing Scheduled for Wednesday, October 4th\n\nThe Centerville Small Area Plan has been scheduled for a public hearing on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, beginning at 6:00 p.m. in the Board Room (Room 250) of the Goochland County Administration Building located at 1800 Sandy Hook Road, Goochland, VA 23063.\n\nThis is a change in the anticipated process for consideration of the Small Area Plan. On August 7, 2023, the Goochland County Board of Supervisors deferred consideration of the Plan, acknowledging that there were still many citizens who felt that they needed additional time and engagement in the small area plan process. At that time, the Board directed staff to prepare a process for additional citizen input to be taken through the county website and it was announced that the Board would hold a work session on the Small Area Plan on October 24, 2023.\n\nThe period for additional citizen input closed on Friday, September 15. The sheer volume of amendments proposed (225 forms submitted with 632 proposed amendments) and the overwhelmingly negative feedback represented by those amendments and comments has caused the county to change the previously identified process.\n\nIn response to that feedback, county staff has been directed to cancel the planned October 24 work session and schedule a public hearing on the proposed Centerville Small Area Plan at the earliest possible date, which is Wednesday, October 4, 2023.\n\nCharlie Vaughters, Vice Chair of the Board and District 4 representative, where Centerville is located, said “It has become clear that my constituents do not want a Plan like this in place at this time. This past month’s amendment and comment process after the Board of Supervisor’s deferral of the plan in August has brought to light numerous concerns from residents in District 4 and from across Goochland County. Accordingly, eliminating the planned October work session and moving up the public hearing and vote on the Plan to as soon as possible will be responsive to the citizens’ concerns.”\n\nCounty staff are thankful for the overall engagement from the Goochland community on the Centerville Small Area Plan process and the input shared, all of which will be preserved as staff moves on to focus on other identified Board and community priorities.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Proposed Amendment Submissions Accepted Through September 15th\n\nGoochland County is accepting proposed amendments to the Centerville Small Area Plan via an online submission form. Developed after the Board of Supervisors deferred consideration of the plan on August 7th, the online form allows residents, business owners, and property owners in Goochland to submit proposed amendments to the plan along with their rationale for the amendments. The submission form can be found on the County’s small area plans website at www.goochlandva.us/villageplans2022. Individuals submitting proposed amendments should use the latest draft of the Centerville Small Area Plan that is available at this link as a reference point for proposed amendments. Proposed amendments will be accepted through September 15, 2023.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan – Proposed Amendments Submission Form\n\nhttps://www.goochlandva.us/FormCenter/Community-Development-14/Centerville-Small-Area-Plan-Proposed-Ame-95\n\nThe submission form allows individuals to submit up to three (3) proposed amendments per form. If individuals need to submit more than three (3) proposed amendments, please use additional forms. It is important that everyone uses the submission form to submit proposed amendments, for consistency purposes, including proposed amendments previously submitted prior to August 7, 2023. Proposed amendments will only be accepted through the submission form.\n\nThe form can be completed via computer, tablet, or mobile device. Public computer access is available at Pamunkey Regional Library locations, including the Goochland and Rockville branches, and at Goochland’s Community Development Customer Service Center during normal business hours for individuals to take advantage of to complete the Centerville Small Area Plan Proposed Amendment Form.

Creating an account and signing-in does provide advantages including allowing individuals to save progress on the form and to receive notifications from the website. It is important to click “submit” or “submit and print” to submit the form once you have completed it.\n\nProposed amendments will be accepted through the submission form through September 15, 2023, at which time staff will compile the proposed amendments along with the rationales to share with the Board of Supervisors at an October 24, 2023, work session for discussion. The October 24, 2023, work session will occur at 9 a.m. in Conference Room 270 in the County Administration Building located at 1800 Sandy Hook Road, Goochland, VA 23063.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan – Key Dates\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Proposed Amendment Form Went Live - August 11, 2023\n\nDeadline to Submit Centerville Small Area Plan Proposed Amendments - September 15, 2023\n\nBoard of Supervisors Work Session on Proposed Amendments - October 24, 2023 at 9 AM\n\nFor more information on the proposed Centerville Small Area Plan or its process, please visit www.goochlandva.us/VillagePlans2022 or contact Goochland County Community Development at 804-556-5840 or via email at centervilleplan22@goochlandva.us.\n\nCenterville Small Area Plan Proposed Amendment Process and Key Dates\n\nAt the August 7 Special Meeting, the Goochland County Board of Supervisors deferred consideration of the proposed Centerville Small Area Plan to a special meeting to be held before December 22, with a specific date to be determined based on availability.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors chose to defer consideration of the proposed Centerville Small Area Plan based on the concerns Board members have heard from the community who felt they needed additional time and engagement in the small area plan process.\n\nVice Chair and District 4 representative Charlie Vaughters, in making the deferral motion, stated that the Board members considered deferring the Centerville Plan until January, when new Board members would take office, but that County Attorney Tara McGee advised that the Board had to act on the plan by December 22. Since the Centerville Plan is an amendment to the county’s comprehensive plan, state law provides a limited amount of time for the Board to act after the Planning Commission’s recommendation.\n\nAt the direction of the Board of Supervisors, county staff has developed a submission form as an engagement tool for the proposed Centerville Small Area Plan, to enable residents, business owners, and property owners in Goochland to submit proposed amendments to the plan together with their rationale for the amendments.

Staff anticipates launching the engagement tool by the end of this week and accepting the proposed amendments until about mid-September.
