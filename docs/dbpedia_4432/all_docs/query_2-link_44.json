The campus continues to grow and evolve as we look to the future of amateur athletics.\n\nThe NSC was built by the State of Minnesota as part of a statewide building program to improve Minnesota’s amateur sports facilities in preparation for the state’s bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. The facility has welcomed over 50 million visitors since its opening.\n\nIn 1998, the original four rinks of the Schwan Super Rink were funded by a cooperative of eleven local governments partnering with the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission.

This year, two events are held on the NSC’ s playing fields, the USA Youth Club Championships, August 11-12 and the USA Grand Masters Championships, September 1-3.\n\nAugust 5-19, the annual USA Hockey Women’s Festival brings the 80 best women’s hockey players in the country to the Schwan Super Rink for the U.S. Women’s National Team’s annual summer training camp. The marquee event of the two-week camp is a three-game series between the U.S. and Canadian U18 National Teams. Held in rink 5, the games draw capacity crowds. After splitting the first two games, the final game goes to a dramatic overtime shootout – but only after USA scores three times in the final 4:53 of the third period to tie the score 4-4 at the end of regulation.

The board hired Conventions, Sports & Leisure International (“CSL”) and the Ripken Design Group to research the options of building a 20-field baseball and softball facility versus building a multi-use field complex. After studying the issue for nearly a year, the NSC board ultimately voted to scrap the baseball idea and instead develop multi-use fields, for soccer, rugby, lacrosse and ultimate. While the board was intrigued with the idea of jumping into the baseball and softball market, the more expensive field construction costs for baseball, paired with the smaller revenue projections, made the board’s decision straightforward.\n\nThe Minnesota Stars FC professional soccer team, previously owned by the North American Soccer League, is purchased by Dr. Bill McGuire. The team is soon rebranded as Minnesota United FC. The team continues to train and play their home games at the NSC Stadium.\n\nIn April, the Schwan Super Rink hosts the Ice Skating Institute’s Synchronized Skating National Championships.

The race expo was held in the Sport Expo Center.\n\nIn early December, the Schwan Super Rink hosts the One Hockey Gone Wild tournament. A hockey tournament at the Super Rink isn’t unusual by itself, but this tournament is notable because 85 of 90 teams came from outside Minnesota.\n\nDecember 13-15 the Sport Expo Center hosts the Minnesota Level 3-5 State Gymnastics Championships. This marks the first time the Expo Center was used for gymnastics, and the venue was popular with athletes and fans.\n\nUSA Hockey holds two training camps for Women’s National Teams at the Schwan Super Rink. The senior Women’s National Team holds a camp December 14-18 and the U18 National Team has a camp from December 26-31.

The Wall of Fame garnered a fair amount of media attention during the month it was up.\n\nIn February, the National Sports Center made People Magazine. A two-page spread fashion photo of the 2014 U.S. Women’s Olympic Hockey Team leads off People’s 10-page “Olympic Insider” preview of the Sochi Olympic Winter Games. The photo was actually taken on December 16, 2013 at the National Sports Center’s Schwan Center, during the team’s training camp at the Schwan Super Rink.\n\nIn May, the NSC learned it received $3.2 million in State of Minnesota capital bonding funds to add up to 20 new athletic fields for soccer, lacrosse, rugby, ultimate and other field sports on 80 acres between 105th and 109th Avenues NE, just east of existing soccer fields. The fields will be developed on land the NSC already owns.\n\nThe Walleye Chop adult hockey tournament, May 9-11, celebrated its 10th anniversary by hosting 122 teams, the largest ever. The event is always held on the opening weekend of Minnesota Walleye Fishing Season, and it proves that not all guys fish. This event stakes its claim to be more than hockey, with a fun component that includes a tailgating competition, minnow races and a fish fry.\n\nThe annual Herb Brooks Foundation Golf Classic and Hall of Fame event in June was a who’s-who of American hockey. Some of the hockey celebrities who participated included 1980 Olympians Dave Christian and Rob McClanahan, Minnesota Wild coach Mike Yeo and general manager Chuck Fletcher, Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Nick Leddy, New Jersey Devils forward Ryan Carter, Colorado Avalanche forward Brad Malone and New York Islanders center Anders Lee. Chuck Grillo was inducted into the Herb Brooks Foundation Hall of Fame.

On the final day of the tournament, Minnesota United FC played (and defeated) Swansea City of the English Premier League, marking the first appearance in Minnesota by an EPL team.\n\nPaul Erickson announced on July 23 that he would retire late in the year from his position as Executive Director of the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission (MASC), where he has served since its creation in 1987. He served with boards appointed by five different governors – Rudy Perpich, Arne Carlson, Jesse Ventura, Tim Pawlenty and Mark Dayton.\n\n“I’ve been planning on retiring for over a year,” Erickson stated. “I feel it is a perfect time to retire, as the MASC and the National Sports Center programs are well established and financially sound. The future is bright.”\n\nAnyone who thinks that ice hockey takes a break at the NSC would be sorely mistaken. In 2014, summer programs at the Schwan Super Rink showed impressive numbers. The five-weekend USA International Cup drew 189 teams from eight states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, North Dakota, Alaska, California and Colorado) and two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Manitoba). Ninety-nine teams played in the summer session of the Minnesota Wild Adult League. Development programs like the Wes Walz Minnesota Wild Hockey School and the Intensity camp added another 163 players together in both programs. The Miracle Gold AAA program, which is based at the Schwan Super Rink, fielded a record 24 boys and girls teams from ages 1998 through 2007 totaling 350 participants.\n\nIn the spring, the NSC received $475,000 in asset preservation funding from the State of Minnesota for roof repair on the Schwan Super Rink and the installation of a new energy-efficient LED lighting system. The Super Rink repair was completed over the summer, and in the fall, the NSC took delivery of 549 new light fixtures, which were installed in the Sports Hall and the remainder in exterior fixtures on parking lots and building exteriors. The NSC’s consumption of energy for lighting will be reduced from 1.23 million kilowatt hours (kWh) annually to 602,020 kWh. This is a savings equivalent to the annual energy usage of 39.6 homes, or 1,009 barrels of oil.\n\nOn December 1, the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission (MASC) appointed a new executive director to replace retiring director Paul Erickson. Todd M. Johnson, a board member of the National Sports Center Foundation since 2008, was chosen from a group of two finalists from an original pool of 132 applicants.\n\nFor a number of years, the NSC had been monitoring the deteriorating condition of the aging NSC Velodrome, which dates back to the opening of the National Sports Center In 1990. Repairs have been made, but the pace of needed repairs had increased. At its December 18, 2014 board meeting, the National Sports Center Foundation board debated a resolution that would have shared the repair cost with a group of local racing advocates, the Friends of the Velodrome.\n\nThe hope was to keep the track open for 4-6 more years, after when the NSC Velodrome would be decommissioned. After a lengthy discussion, the NSCF board voted no on the proposed resolution.\n\nHowever, the Friends of the Velodrome organization almost immediately started a campaign to raise their own money to fully fund the repairs. At the year end, the fund raising was in motion, but the goal not yet reached.\n\n2015\n\nIn March, the Friends of Velodrome Racing in Minnesota (FOVR) signed an agreement with the National Sports Center Foundation to repair and re-open the NSC Velodrome. The agreement marked the successful raising of over $100,000 by the Friends organization. The money was used to make structural repairs to the track. That work was done in March and April, and the track opened its 26th season of racing on schedule, May 21.\n\nMinnesota United FC, the professional soccer team that trains and plays home games at the NSC was granted a future Major League Soccer franchise, to start play in a new stadium in 2017 or 2018. The impact on Minnesota United home attendance in the NSC Stadium was immediate and impressive. Through the first eight home games of the season, the team drew over 9,000 fans for each game, including three sell-outs.\n\nThe Stick-It to Cancer hockey tournament in April drew 57 women’s teams hailing from Minnesota, Wisconsin, California, Iowa, North Dakota, Michigan, Illinois and Ontario. The tournament was a fund raiser for the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, and teams raised $51,500 for the Cancer Center.\n\nNever folks for humility, the Schwan Super Rink marketing staff tags the Walleye Chop as “The Stanley Cup of Adult Hockey.” And for the 128 teams who competed in the 11th edition of the tournament, a record, it certainly was – if Stanley Cup games came with tailgating, minnow racing, a fish fry, fireworks and live music. Originally developed as a creative counter-programming idea to sell soft ice time on the Minnesota Walleye Fishing Opener weekend, the Walleye Chop has grown to be one of the largest adult hockey tournaments in the U.S., and certainly the biggest held under one roof. This year’s tournament used all eight sheets of ice at the Super Rink.\n\nIn May, USA Hockey holds its first ever Women’s National Hockey Team Goaltending Development Camp at the Schwan Super Rink. The camp brought in 18 of the top female goaltenders who are eligible for international play, led by two-time Olympian Jessie Vetter (Cottage Grove, Wis.). The roster included five players with Minnesota ties, the most of any state.\n\nEvery year the National Sports Center hosts some new and unique events.

Forty food trucks crammed the main parking lot, and several thousand hungry customers enjoyed this one-day event.\n\nThe 30th annual Schwan’s USA CUP in July set another team registration record: 1,153 teams from 19 states and 16 countries. One new country was represented, Abuba.\n\nAt the Schwan’s USA CUP, the NSC tried a new tactic to increase recycling. All team leaders and coaches were issued recycling and trash bags at team check-in. Rather than asking individuals to find recycling bins, teams were asked to manage their own waste and then deposit recycling and trash at central locations.\n\nAfter surveying the waste after the tournament, Ace Solid Waste, the National Sports Center’s waste partner, reported these numbers: trash – 13.11 tons or 72 percent; recycling – 4.1 tons or 23 percent; cardboard – 0.9 Tons or 5 percent; total waste diverted – 5.0 tons or 28 percent.\n\n“The important thing is that for the first time, we have baseline data that tournament staff can use to build future recycling strategies,” said Ashley Marston, the NSC’s Sustainability Manager.\n\n2016\n\nThe Schwan Super Rink played host to two USA Hockey National Championship tournaments in March. The Women’s Senior Championship, featuring A, B and C divisions, was held March 31-April 3. The Girls Tier I division, made up of the 14U, 16U and 19U divisions, was held March 31-April 4.

Two of the fields and the softball complex are lighted.\n\nThis initial lease was short-term, expiring at the end of 2016. The MASC and the MAC subsequently negotiated a 30-year lease.\n\nThe Schwan Super Rink staff call it “The Stanley Cup of Adult Hockey,” and for the 12th anniversary of the Walleye Chop in May, 128 teams competed in 16 different divisions. Teams represented 10 different states and provinces: Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ontario, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Anoka County Recycling & Resource Solutions held its 27th annual Recycling Recognition Awards ceremony at the Anoka County Government Center in May. The National Sports Center was recognized for expanding the campus’ recycling program by adding containers to all areas of the facility to increase the convenience of recycling for its guests.\n\nIn June, the NSC and the Blaine Soccer Club (BSC) announced a partnership to benefit both organizations.

In their final home match on October 29, United fell to the New York Cosmos 1-0.\n\nThe Victory Links Golf Course opened a new Indoor Learning Center inside the Victory Links Clubhouse. Instead of offering a row of golf simulators where players could hit hundreds of balls, this Learning Center was non-traditional. Yes, there was a hitting net for full-swing practice. But there is also a ping pong table, basketball hoops on the walls, foam logs, small medicine balls, and even toy trains. Victory Links Golf Pro Jason Erickson explained that all the toys and non-golf activities were relevant to learning the proper golf swing.\n\n2017\n\nIn January the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission (MASC) finalized a 30-year lease agreement with the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) for 49 acres of multi-use sports playing fields east of the National Sports Center (NSC) campus. The 49-acres, sometimes referred to as the Blaine Soccer Complex, is located immediately east of the Schwan Super Rink parking lot. The parcel includes 10 multi-use fields and four softball fields.\n\nThe MAC and the MASC had previously agreed to a one-year lease in 2016. After that lease was finalized, both parties immediately moved toward agreement on a long-term lease, and this long-term lease was the result.\n\nIn the Spring, the NSC began a master planning process. LHB, Inc. a multi-disciplinary engineering, architecture, and planning firm was brought on board to lead staff and outside stakeholders to identify future needs, challenges, and opportunities on the NSC’s 600-acre, 26 year-old campus. In early May, a Town Hall was held for staff, board members, and members of the public. Some of the issues addressed at the Town Hall were land-use issues, potential future expansion, improvement of already-built areas, connecting campus units, meeting community needs, and improving signage, pedestrian safety, and vehicle access and flow.\n\nIn May, construction started on the NSC campus for a new Spring Lake Park School District preK-4 elementary school, near the intersection of Davenport St. NE and 105th Ave. NE. The NSC enthusiastically supported the school construction. The district purchased 11 acres from the State of Minnesota, and the exact location of the school will be at the west end of the Main Parking Lot, just north of the NSC Velodrome. When the school opens in September 2018, over 600 students are expected to be served by the school.\n\nThe Schwan Super Rink hosted the third annual USA Hockey Women’s National Team Goalie Development Camp May 11-14.

Sod was laid on those fields in the late fall, and the fields will be ready for use in the spring of 2018.\n\nMinnesota United players and staff had a major presence at Schwan’s USA CUP in July. Players had several meet-and-greets with youth players during the week, the team held two training sessions that were open to the public, USA CUP players attended two home games that were held during the tournament, and several invited USA CUP teams were treated to behind-the-scenes tours of the team’s locker room.\n\nIn early August, the NSC hosted what has become one of its marque annual tournaments, the USA Ultimate Youth Club Championship (YCC). But this year there was a new twist. An additional tournament, the International Club Championship (ICC), for elite international teams, was held simultaneously. The ICC attracted teams from Canada, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Great Britain, and the semifinals and championship matches were broadcast on ESPN3.\n\nAll total, the YCC division featured 99 teams, and the ICC division hosted 36 teams.\n\nIn August, the City of Blaine began a major project to reconstruct 105th Ave NE, a busy city street that bisects the campus.

The event, one of the largest held at the Super Rink, has been hosted at the NSC for 14 straight years.\n\nNew artificial turf was installed inside the NSC’s Indoor Sports Hall. The turf will be used by Minnesota United FC for indoor training, and the NSC will utilize the field for soccer leagues and sports training.\n\nIn October, the NSC began work on a major renovation to the Stadium field. The historic grass field inside the Stadium was replaced with two full-sized artificial turf fields. During the fall, the grass was removed, the backside bleachers were removed, the field has leveled, sub-surface drainage was installed, and on November 30, the contractor began the process of laying out the new artificial turf field.
