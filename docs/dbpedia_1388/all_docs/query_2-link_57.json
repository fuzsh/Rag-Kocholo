        "text": "A checklist of San Diego’s classic Mexican restaurants\n\nSan Diego has been called the “birthplace of California,” and the cultures and cuisines of Mexico have influenced our food choices since the city’s beginnings. Here’s a quick checklist of classic Mexican restaurants from the San Diego and Tijuana area. Some you’ve never heard of, and some that over the years have come to be well-loved institutions. Several Tijuana-area restaurants are included, even though they may not have focused solely on Mexican food.\n\nRestaurants with checkmarks are still in business today [2024].\n\n(1829-✔) Casa de Bandini, Old Town San Diego historic home (1829) and hotel (1869) which once housed the popular Casa de Bandini Restaurant (1971-2005).\n\nPeruvian-born Juan Bandini was one of the first to regularly entertain traveling guests in his own home in San Diego when it was still controlled by Spain. For his family’s service to Spain, he was granted Rancho Tecate, then later Rancho Jurupa.\n\nHe hosted fandangos, sometimes very elaborate and lasting for days. It has been said that single dinners set Bandini back as much as a thousand dollars.\n\nA second story was added to the adobe home by Albert Lewis Seeley, and the building became his Cosmopolitan Hotel (1869).\n\nHearkening back to the old days of Don Juan’s Californio hospitality, Diane Powers opened Casa de Bandini restaurant in the building as part of her Bazaar del Mundo concept – designer shops selling handcrafted goods, traditional Mexican food, live mariachi music, handmade tortillas, margaritas — all presented in an environment depicting Colonial Mexico.\n\nIt lasted on the spot until 2005 when the State of California revoked her concessions in a bid to rebrand Old Town as a ‘more authentic’ California Old West destination. Think Westworld, with tacos.\n\nPowers relocated Bazaar del Mundo to nearby its original location, and Casa de Bandini restaurant to Carlsbad (2009). The Bandini house was then renovated back to its American period, and once again operates as the Cosmopolitan Hotel and restaurant.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBandini Home (1829)\n\n2660 Calhoun Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\nCosmopolitan Hotel (1869)\n\n2660 Calhoun Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\nCasa de Bandini Old Town (1971-2005)\n\n2660 Calhoun Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\nCasa de Bandini Carlsbad (2009-✔)\n\n1901 Calle Barcelona\n\nCarlsbad, CA 92009\n\n(1887-c1893) Mexican Restaurant, Although not very originally named, Jose Murillo’s was one of the first Mexican restaurants in Alonzo Horton’s New Town allowed to advertise in the local newspaper — ‘all kinds of Spanish’ dishes … Tamales and enchiladas a specialty.’\n\n“But whatever other folly you may be led into, let me implore you to wholly abstain from that deadly concoction, the Mexican tamale. Ugh! I can taste mine now.\n\n“A tamale is a curious and dubious combination of chicken hash, meal, olives, red pepper, and I know not what, enclosed in a corn-husk, steamed until furiously hot, and then offered for sale by Mexicans in such a sweet, appealing way that few can resist the novelty. It has a more uncertain pedigree than the sausage, and its effects are serious…”\n\n—Travel writer Kate Sanborn, 1893\n\nAccepted by native San Diegans today, the tamal was much maligned at the time by some unadventurous travel writers. Unfortunately, many out-of-towners could not digest foods (physically or mentally) out of their comfort zone. So intrinsic to San Diego cuisine, the tamal earned its own category in city directories. Looking for ‘tamale manufacturers?’ Ahh! There they are…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNew Town\n\n552 Sixth Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92101\n\n(1917-1936) The Foreign Club, was Tijuana’s most popular casino and nightclub for many years until eclipsed by the grandeur of Agua Caliente. It was run by three American investors, Marvin Allen, Frank Beyer and Carl Withington, who’d formed their ABW Syndicate to fully take advantage of Baja California’s licensing of gambling casinos, cabarets, saloons and prostitution. A silent partner who afforded them some protections was Colonel Aberlardo Rodriguez, former president of Mexico and later governor of Sonora. After a fire, the resort was completely redesigned and rebuilt by San Diego architect Frank W Stevenson (Glen Abbey Memorial Park, Casa de Mañana, Bush Egyptian Theatre, Hotel Comercial in Tijuana, Colonial Hotel in La Jolla, etc).\n\nThe Foreign Club Cafe de Luxe was the place to dine and dance after a heavy night of gambling. Full meals were $1 to $1.50. A la carte you could get filet mignon with mushroom sauce for one dollar. Caviar, seventy-five cents. Breakfast served all day – their rhum omelet was a pricey one dollar. As for native Mexican food, they offered homemade chicken tamales, stuffed peppers, or turkey enchiladas, two for fifty cents. Local wines Blanco Brillante, Rioja Clarete, Rioja de Mesa Cenicero and Santo Tomas were one dollar a bottle. The Foreign Club catered exclusively to affluent Anglo-American customers who’d come down to ‘do Tijuana.’ Few Mexicanos were employed there, and blacks were not allowed admittance.\n\nEntertainment, of course, was provided — orchestras, floorshows, and dancing. In 1932-33 the pre-eminent dancers to perform at The Foreign Club and Caesar’s Place were Spaniard Eduardo Cansino and daughter Margarita. At the time Cansino, his Irish wife Volga, and their children lived in Chula Vista, as many who work in Tijuana do to this day.\n\nTheir provocative dances Eduardo choreographed got the fourteen year-old noticed by Hollywood types visiting Tijuana. Margarita soon got studio contracts and took her mother’s maiden name — to become Rita Hayworth.\n\nMexican President Cardenas’ ban on gambling effectively shut down entire resorts like the Foreign Club and Agua Caliente casinos. The Mexican government took possession, converting Agua Caliente into a girls’ school. The Foreign Club burned down in 1935.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nZona Centro\n\nThird and Main\n\n[Av Revolución 911]\n\n22000 Tijuana, BC, México\n\n(1918-1990s) Old Town Tamale Factory started out as a window-service takeout place by Palomon R Robles, and grew into the first popular, full-fledged Mexican restaurant serving Old Town San Diego until Ramona’s Spanish Kitchen opened in the 1930s. Robles operated out of an old green house on Taylor Street until his death in 1941. The structure had been Old Town’s first schoolhouse and was moved there years before.\n\nAfter his death, the Tamale Factory continued under the direction of his god-daughter Natividad Garcia and husband John Alton Todd until 1952 when the city acquired the land for the new Morena Blvd overpass. There was talk of demolishing the schoolhouse, but it was saved, renovated, and moved to its original location on Mason Street in Old Town.\n\nThe Todds re-opened their Tamale Factory in a new building across the street and operated until 1979 when it became Eric’s Rib Place. The building is now a motorcycle dealership. They moved their restaurant once more to Congress Street until retiring.\n\nOld Town Tamale Factory was of course known for their authentic tamales, but also their large chile rellenos and a hot sauce so good ‘Johnnie’ Todd said it ‘will make you want to eat more, if you are hungry — or not!’\n\nFor years, Johnnie Todd had a good-natured pogonotrophic competition with fellow restaurateur George Pernicano (Pernicano’s Casa di Baffi) as to who had the longest mustache. Below is an episode of I’ve Got A Secret featuring Pernicano and Todd, from 11 Movember 1959.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nOld Town (1918-1952)\n\n4260 Taylor Street\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nOld Town (1952-1979)\n\n4263 Taylor Street\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nOld Town\n\n2540 Congress Street\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\n(1918-2013) El Porvenír Tortilleria, a small unmarked building in Barrio Logan, was run for generations by Rafaela Aguilera and family. Known far and wide throughout San Diego for their traditional Mexican food, tortillas, tacos, burritos and carnitas. It may be gone now, but Las Quatro Milpas and Super Cocina carry on the traditions of a simple daily menu of homemade, family-style Mexican cooking.\n\nBarrio Logan\n\n1786 National Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\n(1927-✔) Caesar’s, the restaurant of Northern Italian immigrant Abelardo Cesare ‘Caesar’ Cardini (1896-1956) in Hotel Caesar, Tijuana, now famous as prohibition-era landmark and the traditional birthplace of Caesar’s Salad. Joining his brother Alessandro ‘Alex’ Cardini to Tijuana around 1922-23, Caesar started a place behind The Foreign Club in Callejón del Travieso (‘Alley of the Wicked’).\n\nAfter several Tijuana fires, he moved and built Hotel Caesar’s Place in the present location. It was Tijuana’s biggest hotel, complete with Caesar’s fancy restaurant. Its fire-proof concrete construction attracted overnight visitors, who had previously been wary of Tijuana’s bi-yearly firestorms. Caesar’s was — and still is — more Continental rather than strictly Mexican, but is nevertheless included here. While the Cardini brothers came from classic French cooking backgrounds in Europe and San Francisco, their food was influenced by their Northern Italian roots and regional Mexican traditions. It was the original Baja-Med!\n\nPrior to the opening of San Diego’s 1935 California Pacific International Exposition (and its eagerly anticipated crowd of tourists) Cardini split with partners Joseph P Ferraris (1893-1978) and Clemente Sebastian Monaco (1889-1945). Cardini then set up shop with his brothers Alex, Nereo, and Gaudenzio up the street in Hotel Comercial (another Frank Stevenson designed building) with his Original Caesar’s Place. There were now two Caesar’s in Tijuana! But the Cardinis’ place next to Mexicali Beer’s ‘La Ballena’ long bar, with its large welcoming signs, was the first tourists would encounter. The Cardinis’ place was known for nightly floorshows featuring ‘strolling troubadours’ (Mariachis) in charro outfits, imported booze, wine cellar, fine Italian and Mexican food, tableside caneton à la presse, and of course Caesar’s tableside salad. With the Mexican government outlawing gambling, the end of Prohibition, and horseracing legalized in the US, tourism came to a screeching halt in Tijuana.\n\nBy 1936, he quit his businesses in Tijuana, moved to San Diego, and opened Caesar Cardini Cafe. His Tijuana cafes lived on through different owners in Hotel Caesar through the 1990s when it closed briefly. Caesar’s Tijuana is today [2017] run by Grupo Plascencia in the original Hotel Caesar. Signs at the old Hotel Comercial location were still up on the building in 1939, was it still in business? The building for many years hosted The Tropics bar, and is now a pharmacy and shops.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCaesar’s Place (c1923)\n\nNear 2nd and B Streets\n\nCallejón del Travieso\n\nTijuana, BC Mexico 22000\n\nCaesar’s Place (c1926-27)\n\nNear Hotel Americano / Domino\n\n8121 Calle Benito Juárez 2nda\n\nTijuana, BC, México 22000\n\nHotel Caesar’s Place (c1927-1934)\n\n1059 Avenida Revolución\n\nTijuana, BC, México 22000\n\nOriginal Caesar’s Place (1934-1936)\n\nHotel Comercial\n\n804 Avenida Revolución\n\nTijuana, BC, México 22000\n\nCaesar’s Restaurant\n\nHotel Caesar (1934-✔)\n\n1059 Avenida Revolución\n\nTijuana, BC, México 22000\n\n(1928-2018) Ramona’s Spanish Kitchen / La Piñata, originally the family home of the Machado-Peters family, they began selling food from a kitchen take-out window (1928). Florence Peters converted the residence into a sit-down restaurant, Ramona’s Spanish Kitchen, (1933) to take advantage of tourists’ fascination with the story of Ramona.\n\nNearby, Old Town’s Casa de Estudillo was renamed Ramona’s Marriage Place and heavily marketed as the venue from Helen Hunt Jackson’s period romance novel.\n\nFlorence’s sister Vivian Peters and husband Cecil Joseph Flanagan assumed the restaurant business. Vivian and Florence were from Old San Diego’s Machado family and employed an entirely Mexican staff. Oldtimers regularly came in for their favorite ‘old-fashioned’ tamales. Vivian often boasted that Ramona’s — being established in 1933 — was the first modern, sit-down Mexican restaurant in Old Town. “The only thing close to it at the time was the Old Town Tamale Factory which made tamales to take out…”\n\nRamona’s Spanish Kitchen was taken over as La Piñata (1969), and counted itself as the oldest restaurant in Old Town San Diego, the oldest Mexican restaurant in San Diego if you counted from its take-out window days of 1928. La Piñata closed in November 2018. Las Cuatro Milpas now beats it by a smidgeon as the oldest continuously open, family-owned Mexican restaurant in San Diego.

Architect Richard Requa based the garden on that of the Casa del Rey Moro in Ronda, Spain for the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. San Diego sculptor Donal Hord was commissioned to execute the ‘Woman of Tehuantepec,’ located in the center of the building’s courtyard patio.\n\nIva Cole Valle and husband Paul (Gray Gables Inn, Embassy Hotel Restaurant, Valle’s) operated the restaurant and tea room from its opening to during WWII when it was relocated to Hotel Embassy on Park Blvd, as much of Balboa Park was closed to the public. Its buildings were used by the military, the House of Hospitality served as quarters for Navy nurses. Mrs Valle opened a tea room in her home when her husband Paul fell gravely ill. Iva was a successful businesswoman in the male-dominated San Diego restaurant industry of the 1930s, and an inspiration to many women entrepreneurs during WWII. She built the business up to include several locations of the popular Valle’s steak houses before retiring in 1961.\n\nAfter the war, the cafe was operated by subsequent lessees including Mrs Helen Priest, Garner P Dicus, and Helen Thompson. During the 1960s, Cafe del Rey Moro was remodeled by Sue Cox. It was renamed El Prado (1997) after the original building was demolished and rebuilt.

A second Aztec Dining Room, located at the East End of Old Town, was opened in 1966.\n\nMrs Castro ran the kitchen with her daughter Dolores, grandchildren, and an entirely Mexican staff. All food was prepared from traditional family recipes – their Aztec chili sauce took two days to make!

Thus, the taquito (‘little taco’ aka the rolled taco) was born. Cielito Lindo on Olvera Street in Los Angeles claims the invention in the 1930s. He moved El Indio to its present location in 1947, and built his own tortilla manufacturing machine from scratch.\n\nWait in line and stare up at the remaining old murals of Aztec gods – there’s Xipe Totec god of spring, Huitzilopochtli god of war, Tonatiuh sun god, Chalchiuhtlicue goddess of water, and last but not least El Indio ‘god of Mexican food.’ The tortillas and chips are local favorites!\n\nAfter Pesqueira’s death in 1981 his son Ralph Jr took over, and El Indio to this day is still a family-run business. They briefly operated a second location El Indio Shop, on Fourth Avenue across from Horton Plaza. Go for the taquitos, stay for the chips.\n\nLittle Italy (1940-1947)\n\nIndia and Grape Streets\n\nSan Diego, CA 92103\n\nMission Hills (1947-✔)\n\n3695 India Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92103\n\nGaslamp Quarter (closed)\n\n409 F Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92101\n\n(1942-1948) El Pico Dining Room, opened as the dining room to George Marston and Frank Cardwell’s successful Casa del Pico Motor Hotel (1940). El Pico provided mostly American meals to the motel’s guests and local defense workers during WWII. It was renovated, renamed El Nopal Dining Room (1948), and began serving ‘Spanish Dinners’ in earnest. The area was converted into shops during the 1970s as Bazaar del Mundo, and is known today as the Fiesta del Reyes shopping arcade.\n\nOld Town\n\n4016 Wallace Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\n(1945-1974) Manuel’s Restaurante, in the historic Casa de Pedrorena y Altamirano, the last adobe built in Old Town. Built by Don Miguel Pedrorena (1869, CA Historical Landmark 70). Renovated, operated and advertised as an historical restaurant by Manuel and Thelma Moseley for decades. Even after they divorced and Thelma remarried, they remained partners. It was, as Manuel said, ‘one friendship that matrimony has not harmed.’ Thelma oversaw the kitchen, Manuel designed the interior, murals and menus. His whimsical cactus sculpture and faux adobe archway entrance were removed when the property was restored to its original state. “Where cooking is an art and eating is a pleasure…”\n\nOld Town\n\n2616 San Diego Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\n(1946-2004) Mexican Village was originally Coronado’s first firehouse, opened in 1898. When they moved to new digs, Johnny’s Steak House was established in the spot by John D Jacks and Raymond R Daenitz. The one-room eatery was soon sold and re-opened as Mexican Village by Alvin Burtron Jr, James E and Polly Calvert and Karyll F Betts. Jim and Polly Calvert operated Coronado’s Island Cafe, decorated by San Diego artist Russell Dale Moffett. Moffett decorated the new restaurant as a Mexican village, complete with wishing well and murals of maricahis (he also did murals in Sherman’s, Paris Inn, Eddie’s Cafe, Tropic Cafe and Hillcrest Bowl). Food by Al and Veronica (Johnny’s Steak House) Burtron. Bernadine and Lowell A. DeWeese took over until a grease fire inspired them to sell.\n\nIn 1949, Canadian hockey players Albert John Chisholm ‘Bert’ Forsyth (1911-2008), James ‘Jim’ Forsyth (1914-2001), and Bert’s wife Mary Kay bought the business. The brothers owned and coached the San Diego Skyhawks hockey club from 1946 to 1948, and sold their interests to buy the restaurant.\n\nOver the years, they grew Mexican Village into a landmark restaurant that eventually seated hundreds and offered banquet and catering services. They expanded with a piano bar, the Adobe Room, more dining area. Notable guests included the Blue Angels, Eddie Fisher, Liberace, Ricardo Montalban, Vincent Price, Ronald Regan, Senator Jack Schrade, and Mae West.\n\nFavorites on the menu were Mexican Village Romaine Salad, Mexican Pizza (invented by Bert Forsyth in 1956) and margaritas. Mexican Village Romaine Dressing, they bottled and sold commercially for years through their Mex-Pac line of foods.\n\nThe restaurant was later owned by Sharon Considine and Mayson Hwa. The remodeled building now hosts Coronado Brewing Company.\n\nCoronado\n\n120 Orange Avenue\n\nCoronado, CA 92118\n\n(1946-1980s) Romaine’s Restaurant Mexicano, named for proprietor Romaine Shackleford (Top’s, Romaine’s, Ye Golden Lion Tavern), originally started Downtown (1946-1955) then moved to larger facilities in Old Town (1962). Shackleford made a quite a popular place of his Top’s Restaurant and Motel (1940-1946ish) at Laurel and Pacific Highway. It’s round Blackout Bar became famous, and so did he locally. So he put his name on a Mexican-themed restaurant on Broadway for years. Then it was a partnership in Ye Golden Lion Tavern when it moved to El Cajon Blvd.\n\nIn 1962 he built a big 6,000 square-feet Mexican restaurant at the entrance of Old Town, on the corner of Taylor and Juan Streets. Romaine’s executive chef was Henry Soto, and his favorites were albondigas soup, Caesar salads, tampiqueña, chile verde, and giant margaritas.

A Solana Beach historical landmark.\n\nOver the decades it’s been enlarged several times to accommodate larger crowds and is still run by the family. Like many other authentic Mexican restaurants in San Diego, the kitchen is run almost entirely by Hispanic women. Making delicious food — chile rellenos, tacos, the Abuelita and El Campesino combination plates. Get it with turkey…\n\nYour table’s order is marked on a laminated checklist. As the food is prepared, it’s checked off the list, and the card goes to the cashier. All you have to do is tell them what table number you were at, and they ring you up. Catalina Gonzales’ daughter assures us it’s a full-proof system.\n\nEden Gardens\n\n621 Valley Avenue\n\nSolana Beach, CA 92075\n\n(1947-c1972) La Plaza, La Jolla Mexican Restaurant and home of the blended margarita cocktail, established by Morris ‘Moe’ Locke, was first located in a station building at the end of the San Diego Trolley. La Jolla Hermosa was developed in 1927 as a high-end residential area, with Spanish style buildings designed by La Jolla architect Edgar V Ullrich (Casa de Mañana, Paul and Alex’s, Tijuana). Locke leased the old station building from the San Carlos Electric Railroad and established La Plaza Restaurant with his wife Mary in 1947.\n\nMoe Locke was an avid horse racing fan and owned his own stable of racers. He frequented the tracks including trips to Tijuana, Rosarito, and Ensenada in Mexico. His Mexican restaurant would be influenced by his Baja trips, including the drinks served in its adjoining El Toro bar. The story goes that in 1947 Moe told his bartender Albert Rincon ‘Al’ Hernandez about a new cocktail he’d tried in Baja. One he liked and thought would catch on in the States, called ‘Margarita.’ It was made at the time with tequila, Cointreau or Damiana, and lemon or lime juice.\n\nAl used tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, added some crushed ice, and blended it for a bit. They added salt around the rim of the glass and lime for garnish, and voila! the modern, Americanized Margarita as millions would come to know it. (It wasn’t until 1971 that the frozen, Slurpee-like Margarita would be invented.)\n\nHernandez spent the rest of his career popularizing the margarita, including stints at Holiday Inn La Jolla, Mi Burro Restaurant at the Royal Inn, and Hernandez’ Hideaway. Another La Plaza bartender named Alfonso Fierro would later spread the Margarita Word at his own place, Alfonso’s of La Jolla.\n\nAl’s wife Helen Gutierrez Hernandez was the head waitress at the plaza and served regulars that included writers Raymond Chandler, Ted Geisel, Jonathan Latimer, Max Miller, Neil Morgan, and Billy Wilder. Chandler lived just up the street.\n\nWhen the building was annexed by the Methodist Church for more space, the Lockes moved to restaurant row on Prospect Street. The Hernandez family eventually bought La Plaza from the Lockes, adding live music, Flamenco dance shows, favorites like sour cream enchiladas, steak ranchero, and of course — pitchers of margaritas! It closed when Al and Helena moved to North County and opened Hernandez’ Hideaway in on the shores of Lake Hodges.

It had been enlarged from the El Pico auto court dining room in 1948. Restaurateur Stella Buck Lopez moved her place to a brand new larger building at Pacific Highway and Grand Avenue in Pacific Beach in 1960, but the business survived just one year. The Old Town location was acquired by the State of California when Old Town State Historic Park was formed (1968), and became park headquarters (1970), Hamburguesa (1975), Rancho El Nopal (c1995), Jolly Boy Restaurant & Saloon (2005) and is now Barra Barra Saloon [2017].\n\nOld Town (1948-1960)\n\n4016 Wallace Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\nPacific Beach (1960-1961)\n\n6375 Pacific Highway\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\n(1948-2005) La Casa Blanca, was built on the site of the Jose Manuel Machado home in Old Town that was destroyed by fire in 1858.

He kept with it until he’d earned enough to open his own place.\n\nChuey’s was a very popular Mexican restaurant with locals — everyone knew where it was — the old, faded-red Quonset hut right by the Coronado Bay Bridge in Barrio Logan.

It has since grown into a chain of nearly 20 restaurants in California, Arizona, and Texas operated by grandson Javier Correa, Jr. And yes, they still used Maria’s original recipes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSombrero Taco Shop (1961-1980)\n\nRolando\n\n6686 El Cajon Blvd\n\nSan Diego, Ca 92115\n\nSombrero No.1 (1984)\n\nSouth Park\n\n2201 Fern Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92104\n\nSombrero Mexican Food\n\nEl Cajon\n\n1215 West Main Street\n\nEl Cajon, CA 92020\n\n(1964-✔) Roberto’s Taco Shop, starting out with a tortilleria and cafe in San Ysidro (Tortilleria San Ysidro, La Fonda Cafe), Roberto Robledo (1928-1999), his wife Dolores and thirteen children grew their family tree of ubiquitous taco shops to over 70 in the Southwest (not including all the *berto’s variations). Robledo was born in Santo Domingo, San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and came to the US as a laborer. He believed in hard work.\n\nBefore Roberto’s, the Robledos opened their first restaurant La Lomita Taco Shop (1970), a shop in Golden Hill run by Dolores that served small bean burritos called ‘Poor Boys’ for 10 cents each. A Starbucks is on the corner of 28th and B Streets now.\n\nThe next year they took over Jesse and Esther Viramonte’s restaurant at 4920 University Avenue. It was still known as Jesse’s Restaurant until Robledo renamed it Roberto’s Place.\n\nA few years later, the first carne asada burrito was sold from their National City taco shop (now known as Roberto’s No 1). To this day, Roberto’s specializes fast Mexican food, carne asada burritos, and rolled tacos.\n\nLater Robledo’s cousins, the Dominguez family, started the Alberto’s Mexican Food chain.\n\nTortilleria San Ysidro (1964-1969)\n\n229A East San Ysidro Blvd\n\nSan Ysidro, CA\n\nLa Fonda Cafe (1969)\n\nSan Ysidro\n\n314 East San Ysidro Blvd\n\nSan Ysidro, CA\n\nLa Lomita Taco Shop (1970)\n\nGolden Hill\n\n2786 B Street (28th and B Streets)\n\nSan Diego, CA 92102\n\nRoberto’s No. 1\n\nNational City\n\n1406 Highland Avenue\n\nNational City, CA 91950\n\n(1967-✔) Chiquita’s Mexican Restaurant.

Advertised as an historic 16th-Century hacienda, but in the same spot as prior restaurants The Luau, Mister Lucky’s Smorgette, Valle’s La Jolla and The Connoisseur. Pellar claimed to have invented the strawberry margarita and nachos. In 1980, the Pellars opened a short-lived second location in the newly built Seaport Village. The Windansea location lasted until mid-2019, when it finally closed to make way for a new real estate development.

Now operated by Ponce Meza, Jr and second generation members of Meza family. In 1957, Meza came to the US from the town of Talpa in Jalisco, México. He started as a dishwasher at Padrillo’s on El Cajon Blvd, then worked and cooked for years at Nati’s Mexican Restaurant in Ocean Beach.\n\nHe and brother Maximiliano, who worked at El Cortez Hotel, lived together in Kensington. In 1969, Ponce took over the late Myrtle Middleton’s Kensington Cafe on the corner of Adams Avenue and 40th Street (way before CalTrans’ earthmovers came through the neighborhood, carving out Interstate 15). Ponce’s was a small restaurant with counter service, serving Mexican food adapted and perfected from recipes he’d learned throughout his career. It was the community meeting spot – across the street from the hardware store, Hallmark shop (for decades the venerable Kensington Video), theatre and bar (Kensington Club).\n\nIn 2001 Ponce Sr retired and his children took over the business. A couple of years later they gave the place a much-needed remodel and updated the menu. It still has all the original favorites, including Ponce’s chile rellenos and chicken enchiladas. But newer items as well. Their pork carnitas are traditionally made with lard, oranges, and Mexican Coca-Cola.\n\nKensington\n\n4050 Adams Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92116\n\n(1970-1995) ¡Hamburguesa! this Old Town San Diego restaurant used to be Nopal Dining Room, and was re-imagined by Diane Powers in the 1970s. In 1995, the restaurant was recast again as a more historical eatery named Rancho El Nopal. It is now [2017] Barra Barra Saloon.\n\nOld Town\n\n4016 Wallace Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\n(1971-2020) Alfonso’s of La Jolla, landmark Mexican restaurant and bar founded by Alfonso Fierro in the heart of La Jolla Village. Alfonso worked in la Jolla for years, starting out as a busboy and then bartender at La Plaza Mexican Restaurant.\n\nRegulars were shocked when it closed briefly to relocate to Solana Beach. The second location was run by Alfonso’s son Jorge Fierro. Years of tradition, the same menu, and family recipes handed down from generation to generation, made Alfonso’s a staple for fine Mexican dining.\n\nLa Jolla (1971-2015)\n\n1251 Prospect Street\n\nLa Jolla, CA 92037\n\nSolana Beach (2016-2020)\n\nBeachwalk Shopping Center\n\n437 South Highway 101, #301\n\nSolana Beach, CA 92075\n\n(1971-✔) Casa de Pico, Diane Powers’ patio restaurant, was located in the heart of her Bazaar del Mundo, Old Town until relocated to Grossmont Center.

When he came to San Diego, Julio started out working as a 27-year-old busboy during the day and attending night school to learn English. He worked his way up at Pat Brillo’s Mexican Restaurant, at 10th and E Streets (now, Pokez), eventually becoming its manager. In the 1960s he and Sabino Uribe bought the University Avenue location from Pat Brillo. The restaurant was Julio’s life – he lived next door to it, and never took a vacation.\n\n“If someone didn’t have money to pay, he would pay for their meal,” said a friend, Manny Vitug. “Other restaurant owners would make them leave, but he fed them. He could never turn anyone away.” Later they would sell the building and lease it back from the new owners. Julio closed the restaurant in 2006 when he lost that lease, and died of kidney failure the next year.\n\nJulio’s was known for its ranch-style dinners, carne con chile verde, chile colorado, Guadalajara tacos and the famous bacon-topped nachos.\n\nAfter it closed, Julio’s maître d’ Mario Arenas Arellano, and several of his cousins purchased much of its furniture and opened their own version, Casa Adams (2006-2016) on Adams Avenue. Arellano came from Guadalajara, México, and started working for Julio in 1971. Arellano’s menu was similar and had many of Julio’s favorites.\n\nCity Heights\n\n4502 University Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92105\n\n(1972-2013) Casa de Loma, cozy Mexican restaurant, piano bar and adjoining full sports pub (Ballast Pub) owned by Leonard Silva. A regular go-to for many in the Roseville neighborhood of Point Loma, his standard Tex-Mex fare included chile ‘rellanos,’ La Casa Special — steak ranchero in Spanish sauce for $3.75, carne asada plates, El Sombrero — a 95-cent ‘tostado’ with refried beans, lettuce, cheese, avocado, black olives and sour cream. Daily luncheon specials for $1.40.\n\nLenny Sliva’s place had red leatherette booths and the piano bar featured 50-cent Coors served up by bartenders hired as ‘mini-skirt types.’ Singer Frankie Laine dropped in to eat and maybe more than once got tricked into singing a set or two. Silva would later run several other restaurants including The Boobie Trap (now, Old Venice).\n\nCasa de Loma lasted until 2013 when the old building was renovated and became Sushi Lounge Point Loma.\n\nRoseville\n\n1304 Rosecrans Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92106\n\n(1972-✔) Hernandez’ Hideaway, the charming, old-school Mexican restaurant overlooking Lake Hodges, was established in 1972 by Albert Rincon Hernandez Sr (1915-2006) and wife Helena Gutierrez. Albert for years tended the El Toro bar at Morris ‘Moe’ Locke’s La Plaza Restaurant in La Jolla Hermosa. Today Albert Hernandez is acknowledged as the one to popularize the blended margarita cocktail in the States, and margaritas followed wherever he went.\n\nAfter Moe Locke died in 1956, his wife Mary sold La Plaza to the Methodist church and relocated it to the up-and-coming restaurant row on Prospect Street in La Jolla. The Hernandez family bought La Plaza several years thereafter. In 1972, the Hernandez family bought and remodeled the Lakeview Inn steakhouse in Del Dios and opened their Hernandez’ Hideaway. Helena used family recipes and oversaw the kitchen, Albert ran the bar and pumped out the margaritas. Favorites on chef Blas Garcia Cerda’s menu were Helena’s sour cream chicken enchiladas, enchilada pie, stuffed quesadillas and chili verde. In the 1930s Cerda immigrated from Coahuila de Zaragoza, México. He settled in Texas, where the Texan-Mexican style of cuisine — Tex-Mex — was coming up.\n\nDel Dios\n\n19320 Lake Drive\n\nEscondido, CA 92029\n\n(1972-2017) Salazar’s Fine Mexican Food, with the neighborhood being enveloped by new condominium buildings, it was reassuring to see Frank Salazar’s old standby going strong for so many years.\n\nAdded plus: the 1972 interior was intact until the end. A short block away from San Diego police headquarters, it was a favorite of law enforcement professionals for decades. Home-style Mexican food, specialties included fish tacos, caldo de pescado and camarrones al mojo de ajo.\n\nEast Village\n\n1502 Market Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92101\n\n(1972-✔) Tacos el Gordo started in Tijuana (1972), and now the family-run business has several uber-popular locations in San Diego, Las Vegas and Tijuana. There is a new Downtown San Diego location being planned [2017].\n\nTacos el Gordo in Chula Vista offers counter service, with each line offering a different kind of taco. Queue up for delicious tacos made with fresh tortillas. Flavors include carne asada (marinated beef), suadero (braised beef brisket), cabeza (beef head), buche (pork stomach), lengua (beef tongue),\n\nChula Vista (1998)\n\n689 H Street\n\nChula Vista, CA 91910\n\nZona Urbana Rio Tijuana\n\n9210 Blvd General Rodolfo Sánchez Taboada\n\nTijuana, BC, México 22010\n\nSouth Bay\n\n3265 Palm Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92154\n\n(1975-✔) Alberto’s Mexican Food original chain of taco shops was founded in 1975 by Roberto Robledo’s (Roberto’s Taco Shops) nephews from San Luis Potosí, México, brothers Juan Diego Rodriguez and Alvaro Rodriguez. One story says Robledo allowed them to use the Roberto’s name, another says they just did and Robledo sued them. In any event, they ended up changing the existing signage to “Alberto’s” with spraypaint.\n\nThe two were eventually found guilty of tax evasion, and the chain is now owned by Abel Dominguez, Leonor Luna, and Arcelia Dominguez. The new owners’ anchor is in Poway (they took over an old Pinic N’ Chicken) and the chain now has over 90 outlets in California, Arizona, and Utah.\n\nIronically, new operators are using the Alberto’s name and the chain is going after them for trademark violations…\n\nLook for the bright orange- and red-striped buildings serving enchiladas, tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, and combination plates.\n\nOriginal Alberto’s No. 1 (c1976)\n\nConvoy\n\n4125 Convoy Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92111\n\nNew Alberto’s No. 1 (1988-c2010)\n\nPoway\n\n13095 Poway Road\n\nPoway, CA 92064\n\n(1982-✔) Miguel’s Cocina, founded in 1982 by Mike and Barbara Morton as an extension of their popular Brigantine family of restaurants. Miguel’s Cocina uses family recipes from chef Javier Alaniz, serving up freshly made tortillas, cóctel de camarones, tasty margaritas, albondigas, mulitas, swordfish tacos, enchiladas rancheras and suisas, fajitas, and of couse a carne asada burritos. Miguel’s No 1 is in the original Brigantine location, which moved across the street replacing Harpoon Henry’s on the Byron Street causeway (now, Shelter Island Drive).\n\nThe Miguel’s in Coronado sits in the romantically shaded and cool courtyard of El Cordova Hotel.\n\nAround 2010 they converted several of their Zócalo Grill ‘Nuevo Latino’ eateries into Miguel’s Cocinas. And soon, they will be opening another in the remodeled Anthony’s location on the Embarcadero.\n\nPoint Loma (1982)\n\n2912 Shelter Island Drive\n\nSan Diego, CA 92106\n\nCoronado\n\nEl Cordova Hotel\n\n1351 Orange Avenue\n\nCoronado, CA 92118\n\nOld Town (previously Zócalo Grill, La Casa Blanca)\n\n2444 San Diego Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\nZócalo 4S Ranch (2010, previously Zócalo Grill)\n\n10514 Craftsman Way\n\nSan Diego, CA 92127\n\nEastlake\n\n970 Eastlake Parkway #108\n\nChula Vista, CA 91914\n\nCarlsbad\n\n5980 Avenida Encinas\n\nCarlsbad, CA 92008\n\nEast Village (2017)\n\nPETCO Park, Field Level #104\n\n100 Park Blvd\n\nSan Diego, CA 92101\n\n(1982-✔) Porkyland started out as a small tortilleria in Barrio Logan. The family started serving carnitas, and the rest is history.\n\nTheir homemade carnitas takes six hours to cook in a traditional copper olla, large open pot. In 1984 they opened a location in La Jolla, which recently closed and was moved to Del Mar Heights.\n\nPorkyland is now owned by Pepe and Deborah Stepensky.\n\nBarrio Logan (1982-2012)\n\n2196 Logan Avenue\n\nSan Diego, CA 92113\n\nLa Jolla (1984-2017)\n\n1030 Torrey Pines Road\n\nLa Jolla, CA 92037\n\nTorrey Hills (2015-✔)\n\nTorrey Hills Shopping Center\n\n4645 Carmel Mountain Road, #201\n\nSan Diego, CA 92130\n\nDel Mar Heights\n\nCarmel Country Plaza (2017-✔)\n\n12880 Carmel Country Road, D-100\n\nSan Diego, CA 92130\n\n(1983) El Fandango Restaurant, operated by Consuelo Puente and Jim Miller, was a California State Parks attempt at a more historically accurate restaurant in Old Town.\n\nInterpretive menus, employees in period costume and lackluster food did not go over well with tourists — it seems as though they still wanted the Californio myth, the romance of Ramona, and the thrill of Old Mexico.\n\nOld Town\n\n2734 Calhoun Street\n\nSan Diego, CA 92110\n\n(1983-✔) Rubio’s fast casual restaurant chain specializing in traditional Baja fish tacos, was founded by Ralph Rubio, and has grown to include more than 200 restaurants in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Utah. It is now known as Rubio’s Coastal Grill.\n\nRubio and some friends from San Diego State University were on spring break in San Felipe, Baja California when he first encountered fish tacos at a local stand, and was inspired to open a restaurant in San Diego. With a bountiful supply of fresh seafood available, tacos de pescado became popular with visitors and coastal residents of Baja Sur. Rubio’s fish tacos are made from Alaskan pollock, battered, fried, and served in a corn tortilla with shredded cabbage, crema, and a lime.\n\nRubio’s No. 1 opened in 1983 at a former Orange Julius on Mission Bay Drive in Pacific Beach, serving fish tacos, calamari, and French fries.\n\nRubio’s No. 1 (1983)\n\nPacific Beach\n\n4504 Mission Bay Drive\n\nSan Diego, CA 92109\n\n(1988-✔) Super Cocina, serving up authentic comida casera (‘homemade food’) from different regions of Mexico.
