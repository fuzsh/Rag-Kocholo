        "text": "Despite those \"memorable dispatches\" of 1975, Fidel Castro remarked to Régis Debray that he was not yet convinced of the Colombian writer’s \"revolutionary firmness.\" True, García Márquez had refused to support the Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in the famous affair of his forced \"confessions,\" that tropical echo of the Moscow Trials that led to the break of many Latin American intellectuals with the regime. Castro noted this, but still he wasn’t sure, and so no interview was granted. García Márquez had to content himself at the time with interviewing the strongman of Panama, Omar Torrijos, a second-rank Caribbean dictator but a faithful reader of García Márquez. Torrijos had this to say about The Autumn of the Patriarch: \"It’s true, it’s us, what we’re like.\" \"His comment left me astonished and delighted,\" said García Márquez. And \"quite quickly,\" writes Martin, \"the two men would come to build a friendship based on a deep emotional attraction which evidently turned over time into a kind of love affair.\"\n\nIn 1976 García Márquez returned to Cuba, and after waiting for a month (like the legendary colonel) at the Hotel Nacional for a call from the Comandante, the meeting that he had been anticipating for almost two decades finally took place. Once accepted by Castro, and under his personal supervision, he wrote \"Operación Carlota: Cuba in Angola,\" a chronicle that won him an award from the International Press Organization. Mario Vargas Llosa (who had written and published a doctoral thesis on One Hundred Years of Solitude) bluntly called him Castro’s \"lackey.\" Two years later, García Márquez declared that his adherence to the Cuban way was in a sense similar to Catholicism: it was \"a Communion with the Saints.\"\n\nMartin devotes a few passages to describing the growing bond between the Comandante and the writer after 1980. \"Ours is an intellectual friendship,\" García Márquez said in 1982. \"When we get together we talk about literature.\" And it was not just literature that united them. \"They began to have an annual vacation together at Castro’s residence at Cayo Largo,\" Martin records, \"where sometimes alone, sometimes with guests, they would sail in his fast launch or his cruiser Acuaramas.\"\n\nGarcía Márquez’s wife \"particularly enjoyed these occasions because Fidel had a special way with women, always attentive and with an old-style gallantry that was both pleasurable and flattering.\" He also informs us of Castro’s culinary skills, and of Gabo’s taste for caviar and Castro’s for cod. For the Nobel ceremony, Castro sent his friend a boatload of rum, and upon the family’s return he put them up at Protocol House number six, which, just a few years later, would become their Cuban home. There García Márquez \"overwhelmed\" guests such as Debray with bottles of Veuve Clicquot. \"There is no contradiction between being rich and being revolutionary,\" García Márquez declared, \"as long as you are sincere about being a revolutionary and not sincere about being a rich man.\"\n\nIn this vein—not of socialist realism but of socialite realism—Martin could have gotten some juice out of Gabo and Fidel, by Ángel Esteban and Stéphanie Panichelli (which he mentions in his bibliography but does not quote in the book). This volume presents the testimony of the Cuban poet Miguel Barnet, a friend of García Márquez and president of the Fernando Ortiz Foundation. Barnet gives a detailed account of the parties at the \"Siboney mansion,\" describing even the attire of the host. Fidel and Gabo—says Barnet—\"are true specialists in culinary matters, and they know how to appreciate good food and good wines. Gabo is the ‘great sybarite,’ because of his love for sweets, cod, seafood, and food in general.\" And Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, a Spanish writer and friend of Castro, collected the following testimony from the \"great Smith,\" who was perhaps Cuba’s best chef: \"Gabo is a great admirer of my cooking and he’s promised me a foreword for my cookbook, which is almost finished.\" In that cookbook, each of the dishes is dedicated to the person for whom it was created. Gabo’s is \"Lobster à la Macondo,\" and Fidel Castro’s is \"Turtle Consommé.\" It is important to note that in those days the Cuban ration book (which had been introduced in 1962) contained, per month and per person, the following delicacies: seven pounds of rice and thirty ounces of beans, five pounds of sugar, half a pound of oil, four hundred grams of pasta, ten eggs, one pound of frozen chicken, and half a pound of ground meat (chicken), to which fish, mortadella, or sausage could be added as an alternative in the category of \"meat products.\"\n\nIn The Autumn of the Patriarch, the Patriarch looks down on the man of letters: \"they’ve got fever in their quills like thoroughbred roosters when they are molting so that they are no good for anything except when they are good for something.\" García Márquez, now with a house of his own on the island, was good for plenty. In December 1986, he established a film academy in San Antonio de los Baños: the New Latin American Cinema Foundation. The new institution—financed by García Márquez—was important for the regime, because culture in Latin America has always been an essential source of legitimacy. Among its guests would be Robert Redford, Steven Spielberg, and Francis Ford Coppola. The academy, as Martin describes it, was a clever and exciting idea: \"Cinema was convivial, collective, proactive, youthful; cinema was sexy and cinema was fun. And García Márquez lived every minute of it; he was surrounded by attractive young women and energetic and ambitious but deferential young men, and he was in his element.\"\n\nMartin is right: García Márquez was \"in his element.\" What Martin does not see is the biographical significance of what he is recounting. The whole thing was like a reconstruction of the Macondian paradise from before the leaf storm, with the advantage that now it was Gabriel García Márquez who lived on the other side, the privileged side, the \"American\" side. For ordinary Cubans, his Siboney mansion, the lavish meals, the champagne, the seafood, the marvelous pastas prepared by Castro, the yacht outings were—as García Márquez wrote about the \"forbidden city\" of the Yankees in Aracataca—\"fleeting visions of a remote and unlikely world that was veiled to us mortals.\"\n\nBest of all was once more being able to walk hand in hand with the patriarch. In 1988 García Márquez wrote a profile of the \"caudillo\" (as he calls him) that was published as the prologue to Habla Fidel, or Fidel Speaks, a book by the Italian Gianni Minà. In this profile he furnished a sweeping literary homage to his hero (\"He may be unaware of the force of his presence, which seems to take up all the space in the room, though he isn’t as tall or as big as he seems at first glance\"). That same year, living in Havana, García Márquez made progress on a book about Bolívar’s final journey: The General in His Labyrinth. Martin suggests that his description of Bolívar was inspired by traits of Castro, and vice versa.\n\nThe following year began badly, with the reverberations of a public letter signed in December 1988 by several writers of international renown who demanded that Castro follow in the footsteps of Pinochet and dare to submit his regime to a plebiscite. For García Márquez—who in the 1970s had expressed his disdain for the institutions, the laws, and the freedoms of \"bourgeois\" democracy, and in December 1981 had mocked the \"crocodile tears\" of the \"usual anti-Soviets and anti-communists\" after the repression of Solidarity in Poland—the letter was another chapter in the rise of the \"right\" fostered by John Paul II, Thatcher, Reagan, and Gorbachev himself. (In a visit to Moscow in the late 1980s, García Márquez had warned Gorbachev of the danger of surrendering to the empire.)\n\nOf the signatories to this letter of protest against political unfreedom in Cuba, Martin writes that \"the American names are not especially impressive, apart from Susan Sontag, nor were the Latin American ones (no Carlos Fuentes, Augusto Roa Bastos, etc.).\" Among the American authors who did not impress Martin were Saul Bellow and Elie Wiesel; among the Latin Americans, Reinaldo Arenas (who composed the document), Ernesto Sábato, Mario Vargas Llosa, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and Octavio Paz; among the Europeans, Juan Goytisolo, Federico Fellini, Eugene Ionesco, Czesław Miłosz, and Camilo José Cela.\n\nBut this is understandable. For the biographer and for his subject, \"1989 would be the year of apocalypse.\" Even more of a blow to Cuba’s prestige than the downfall of communism in Eastern Europe was the much-talked-about verdict against Division General Arnaldo Ochoa and the brothers Antonio (Tony) and Patricio de la Guardia, on charges of drug trafficking and treason against the Revolution. This dark and ugly episode—to which Martin devotes only a couple of paragraphs—came to public attention in June 1989. According to the journalist Andrés Oppenheimer, the movement of drugs through Cuba began in 1986 and had the tacit blessing of Fidel, until the American intelligence services detected a compromised operation. Castro then took the opportunity to kill four birds with one stone: he could rid himself of a potentially serious enemy (Ochoa was one of the supreme commanders of the intervention in Angola, a veteran of the incursions into Venezuela, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Nicaragua, and officially recognized as a \"Hero of the Revolution\") along with the de la Guardia brothers, both of them Castro’s friends and attached to the Ministry of the Interior under another \"implicated party,\" the division general José Abrantes. Fidel had entrusted Tony de la Guardia, his \"protegé,\" with multiple intelligence operations (such as the laundering of $60 million for Argentina’s Montoneros in 1975, in payment for a kidnapping). It is hard to believe that this new venture—expressly ordered by Abrantes—did not enjoy Fidel’s blessing, like everything on the island. But the end justified the means.\n\nThe remarkable fact is that Antonio de la Guardia, a character out of an action film, was also a close friend of García Márquez. One of his paintings hung in García Márquez’s house in Havana. In that same year, 1989, Gabo dedicated The General in His Labyrinth to him: \"For Tony, may he sow good.\" On July 9, when the final verdict was about to be announced, Castro visited García Márquez at his house in Havana. Oppenheimer reconstructed fragments of the long conversation. \"If they are executed,\" García Márquez is reported to have said, \"nobody on earth will believe it wasn’t you who gave the order.\" Later that night, the writer received Ileana de la Guardia, Tony’s daughter, and her husband Jorge Masseti (the son of the late guerrilla leader Jorge Ricardo Masseti, an old friend and García Márquez’s erstwhile boss at Prensa Latina). They had come to beg García Márquez to intercede on de la Guardia’s behalf, to save his life. The writer said things like \"Fidel would be crazy if he allowed the executions,\" and raised their hopes. He told them not to worry, and advised them not to appeal to any human rights organizations. Four days went by. Then, on July 13, 1989, Gabo’s good friend Tony de la Guardia and Ochoa were executed. Patricio was sentenced to thirty years in prison and Abrantes to twenty. The latter died of a heart attack in 1991.\n\nAlthough he left Cuba before the execution, according to testimony collected by Ileana de la Guardia herself, García Márquez attended \"part of the trial, along with Fidel and Raúl, behind the ‘great mirror’ in the hall of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces.\" In Paris, during the bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution, he told François Mitterrand that it had all been just \"a quarrel among officers.\" Publicly he claimed to have \"very good information\" that the charges of \"treason\" were justified, and he observed that, given the situation, Castro had no alternative.\n\nA few months before the events, writing the final pages of The General in His Labyrinth, García Márquez had depicted Simón Bolívar raving in his sleep as he remembers his order to shoot the brave mulatto general Manuel Piar, who had been invincible against the Spaniards and a hero of the masses. \"It was the most savage use of power in his life,\" García Márquez observes in his novel, \"but the most opportune as well, for with it he consolidated his authority, unified his command, and cleared the road to glory.\" And at the chapter’s climax García Márquez puts his grandfather’s words in Bolívar’s mouth: \"I’d do it all over again.\"\n\n\"I don’t publish any book these days,\" García Márquez said sometime in the mid-1980s, \"before the Comandante reads it.\" Which is why, regarding the passage about Bolívar and Piar, Martin wonders, \"Did he [Castro] remember it as he made his decision?\" Of course he remembered it. But given the \"very good information\" that García Márquez has always claimed to have about Cuba, and given his closeness to Antonio de la Guardia, the interesting questions concern not the dictator but the writer. Was García Márquez unaware of his friend Tony’s secret assignments? As he was writing his novel, did he even consider the possibility that his friends would be arrested on charges of purported \"treason\"?\n\nAnd so an old cycle of complicity was complete. It began with an execution in the inner circle of the young García Márquez—his grandfather’s shooting of his friend and lieutenant Medardo, his lover’s son—and it ended with another execution in his inner circle: the Comandante’s sentencing of his friend Tony, the sower of good. The writer who, from an early age, adopted his grandfather’s \"political morality,\" the one who \"quite cold-bloodedly puts politics before morality,\" the one who saw Castro as \"his own grandfather figure, against whom he could not, would not dare, would not even wish, to win,\" had been obliged to test his theory in flesh and blood. And he had accepted the verdict of power.\n\nThe friendship and the lobsters have continued for twenty years. Panegyrist, court adviser, press agent, ambassador-at-large, plenipotentiary representative, head of foreign public relations: García Márquez has been all these things for Castro. In 1996, he dined with President Clinton and told him that \"if you and Fidel could sit face to face, there wouldn’t be any problem left.\" After September 11, he published a long letter to Bush: \"How does it feel now that the horror is erupting in your own yard and not in your neighbor’s living room?\"\n\nThings were going pretty well for the writer and the Commandante, except at a few moments, as in 2003, when a movement more important and universal than democracy, the movement for human rights, seemed to come between them. In March of that year, in a sudden and devastating blow, Castro reprised the Moscow Trials, sentencing seventy-eight dissidents to anywhere from twelve to twenty-seven years in prison. (One of them was accused of possessing a Sony tape recorder.) Immediately thereafter, in the heat of the moment, he ordered the execution of three boys who had tried to flee paradise on a ferry. Confronted with this crime, José Saramago declared (though he later retracted his statement) that \"this is as far as I go\" with his relationship with Castro. But Susan Sontag went further, and at the Bogotá Book Fair, she confronted García Márquez: \"He’s this country’s greatest writer and I admire him very much, but it’s unpardonable that he hasn’t spoken out about the latest measures taken by the Cuban regime.\"\n\nIn response, García Márquez seemed to distance himself vaguely from Castro: \"Regarding the death penalty, I don’t have anything to add to what I’ve said in private and publicly as long as I can remember: I’m against it in any place, for any reason, in any circumstances.\" As if the issue were the death penalty! And almost immediately he distanced himself from his distancing: \"Some media outlets—among them CNN—are manipulating and distorting my response to Susan Sontag, to make it seem like a statement against the Cuban Revolution.\" For emphasis, he repeated an old argument, justifying his personal relations with Castro: \"I can’t count the number of prisoners, dissidents, and conspirators whom I’ve helped, in absolute silence, to get out of jail or emigrate from Cuba over the last twenty years at least.\"\n\nIn \"absolute silence\" or in absolute complicity? Why would García Márquez have helped anyone leave Cuba if he did not consider their imprisonment unjust? And if he considered it unjust, to the extent of championing their cause, why did he continue—why does he still continue—to support a regime that commits such injustices? Wouldn’t it have been more valuable to denounce the unjust incarceration of those \"prisoners, dissidents, and conspirators\" and thus help to abolish the political prison system?\n\nGabriel García Márquez is not a hothouse writer. He claims to be proud of his work as a reporter. He promotes journalism at an academy in Colombia. He has asserted that the news story is a literary genre with the potential to be \"not just true to life but better than life. It’s as good as a story or a novel, but with one sacred and inviolable difference: novels and stories permit unlimited fabrication but news stories have to be true down to the last comma.\" How, then, to reconcile this declaration of journalistic ethics with his own concealment of the truth in Cuba, despite his possession of privileged inside information?\n\nEventually history makes both aesthetic and moral judgments. Aesthetically speaking, it is a little premature to say that García Márquez is the \"new Cervantes.\" But in moral terms, certainly, there is no comparison. A hero in the war against the Turks, wounded and maimed in battle, castaway and prisoner in Algeria for five years, Cervantes lived his ideals, his tribulations, and his poverty with Quixote-like integrity, and enjoyed the supreme freedom of accepting his defeats with humor. There is not a trace of such greatness of spirit in García Márquez, who has avidly collaborated with oppression and dictatorship. Cervantes? Not by a long shot.\n\nThe beauties of the fiction of Gabriel García Márquez will survive the twisted loyalties of the man who created it, just as the work of Céline survives his passion for the Nazis and the work of Pound survives his admiration for Mussolini. But it would be an act of poetic justice if, in the autumn of his life and at the zenith of his glory, he disassociated himself from Fidel Castro and put his influence at the service of the Cuban boat people. There is no point in hoping for such a transformation, of course. It is the kind of thing that happens only in García Márquez novels.\n\nEnrique Krauze is the editor of Letras Libres.
