        "text": "Aug. 13, 1926\n\nSon of Privilege\n\nFidel Castro Ruz is born in the eastern Cuban village of Biran, the son of a well-off, Spanish-born landowner.\n\nJuly 26, 1953\n\nLeads Failed Uprising\n\nMr. Castro leads an armed uprising against Cuba’s military dictator, Fulgencio Batista, with an attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Mr. Castro and his fellow revolutionaries are routed.\n\nSep. 1, 1953\n\nRevolutionaries on Trial\n\nMr. Castro is among 100 revolutionaries tried in connection with the July 26 uprising. Mr. Castro, a young lawyer, is allowed to defend himself. At the trial, he utters what will become one of his most often quoted statements: “History will absolve me.”\n\nMay. 1, 1955\n\nCastro Goes Into Exile in Mexico\n\nMr. Castro is given amnesty for his role in the 1953 uprising, is released from prison, and goes into exile in Mexico.\n\nDec. 2, 1956\n\nRevolutionaries Land in Cuba\n\nMr. Castro and 81 other would-be revolutionaries land in Cuba on the yacht Granma. Only about a dozen survive the battle, including Mr. Castro, his brother Raúl and Che Guevara. The trio regroup in the Sierra Maestra, where they begin a guerrilla war. Initial reports list Fidel and Raúl Castro among the dead.\n\nJan. 1, 1959\n\nBatista Is Overthrown\n\nAsserting that Mr. Castro and his rebels have gained military superiority over the Cuban Army, Mr. Batista surrenders the presidency and goes into exile in the Dominican Republic.\n\nJan. 8, 1959\n\nCastro Enters Havana\n\nMr. Castro enters Havana after a triumphal journey across Cuba. As supreme “Comandante” of the armed forces, he begins the political, economic and social transformation of Cuba, starting agrarian reform and nationalizing most foreign and local businesses.\n\nFeb. 13, 1959\n\nNamed Prime Minister\n\nMr. Castro becomes prime minister of the revolutionary government, replacing the interim prime minister, José Miró Cardona.\n\nJan. 3, 1961\n\nU.S. Severs Ties With Cuba\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower formally breaks off diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nApr. 19, 1961\n\nU.S.-Backed Invaders Routed\n\nMr. Castro directs troops in the defeat of an invasion attempt by C.I.A.-backed Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs.\n\nFeb. 7, 1962\n\nU.S. Imposes Economic Embargo\n\nThe United States bans all imports from and exports to Cuba.\n\nOct. 14, 1962\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\n\nThe presence of Soviet warheads in Cuba is discovered and provokes a standoff between Moscow and Washington. Many fear nuclear war, but the Soviet Union decides to withdraw missiles after President John F. Kennedy imposes a naval blockade on the island.\n\nOct. 1, 1965\n\nCuban Communist Party Created\n\nMr. Castro founds the Cuban Communist Party and is named first secretary.\n\nJan. 1, 1976\n\nCastro Assumes the Presidency\n\nMr. Castro becomes president of Cuba, in a move ratified by the newly created National Assembly.\n\nApr. 15, 1980\n\nThousands Flee to U.S. in Boatlift\n\nAddled by a struggling economy and a continuing problem with dissidents, Mr. Castro allows any Cubans wishing to leave the country to do so from the port of Mariel. From mid-April through October, more than 120,000 Cubans enter the United States. Mr. Castro insists, however, that every boat departing the port must include prisoners and the country’s unwanted mentally ill.\n\nDec. 26, 1991\n\nSoviet Collapse Devastates Cuba\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, the $5 billion a year in subsidies Cuba relied on for so long disappears. With the island’s economy in ruins, Mr. Castro is forced to abandon a strict centralized economy and begins to experiment with capitalism.\n\nAug. 14, 1993\n\nBan on U.S. Currency Is Lifted\n\nMr. Castro ends his government’s ban on the use of United States dollars, one in a series of limited economic openings that the Cuban government says is aimed at saving the revolution.\n\nAug. 5, 1994\n\nHavana Riots\n\nHundreds of Havana residents riot in the biggest anti-Castro disturbance since the 1959 revolution.\n\nAug. 19, 1994\n\nA New Exodus, a New U.S. Policy\n\nIn August and September, more than 35,000 people leave Cuba in flimsy boats and rafts. The migration prompts President Bill Clinton to make an abrupt change to Cuban refugee policy. He announces on Aug. 19 that Cubans intercepted at sea by the United States Navy or Coast Guard will be transferred to holding camps or held in custody if they reach the United States mainland.\n\nFeb. 24, 1996\n\nExile Group’s Planes Shot Down\n\nCuban MIG fighters shoot down two small American planes in the Florida Straits belonging to the Miami-based Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue. Four crew members are killed.\n\nNov. 25, 1999\n\nElián González Saga\n\nMr. Castro opens a mass public campaign for the return of Elián González, a 5-year-old Cuban boy who survived the capsizing of a boat off the Florida coast in November that drowned his mother before being taken to relatives in Miami. After six months of a bitter dispute and huge protests in Miami, the boy is returned to his father’s custody in June 2000 in what is seen as a major propaganda victory for Mr. Castro.\n\nJun. 23, 2001\n\nCastro Appears to Faint\n\nTwo hours into a speech at a public rally, Mr. Castro appears to faint during a speech on a hot day. He returns within minutes to say he is fine.\n\nJun. 12, 2002\n\nCubans March in Havana\n\nMr. Castro leads one million Cubans in a march along the Havana waterfront in a campaign to defend his government’s socialist system in the face of growing dissent and stepped-up pressure from the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nJun. 25, 2002\n\nSocialism ‘Irrevocable’\n\nCuba declares socialism “irrevocable” in a constitutional amendment passed by the National Assembly.\n\nMar. 18, 2003\n\nActivists and Journalists Jailed\n\nIn a crackdown on dissidents, Mr. Castro jails 75 pro-democracy activists and independent journalists, accusing them of subversion and conspiracy with American diplomats.\n\nOct. 20, 2004\n\nInjured in a Fall\n\nMr. Castro fractures his left knee and arm in a fall after delivering a speech on the steps of Che Guevara’s mausoleum in Santa Clara, Cuba. He later says that he conducted government business by cellphone during an ambulance ride and that he refused general anesthesia.\n\nJul. 31, 2006\n\nTemporary Shift of Power\n\nMr. Castro gives power to his brother Raúl after undergoing emergency surgery to stop intestinal bleeding caused by an undisclosed illness.\n\nDec. 17, 2007\n\nHints of Change at the Top\n\nIn a statement read on state television, Mr. Castro says he is willing to hand over the reins of Cuba’s government to a younger generation of leaders. “My basic duty is not to cling to office, nor even more so, to obstruct the rise of people much younger,” he says, “but to pass on experiences and ideas whose modest value arises from the exceptional era in which I lived.”\n\nFeb. 19, 2008\n\nCastro Steps Down\n\nEnding one of the longest tenures as one of the most powerful communist heads of state in the world, Fidel Castro steps down as the president of Cuba and cedes power to his brother Raúl. In a statement, Fidel Castro says, “It would betray my conscience to occupy a responsibility that requires mobility and the total commitment that I am not in the physical condition to offer.”\n\nSep. 30, 2012\n\nPhotos Appear to Debunk Rumors\n\nAmid rumors that Mr. Castro is dead or nearly so, a former Venezuelan official and a Cuban state-run website both show what they say are recent pictures of him.\n\nDec. 17, 2014\n\nU.S. and Cuba Announce Restoration of Diplomatic Ties\n\nPresident Raúl Castro, and President Obama announced an agreement on Dec. 17 to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, but Fidel Castro was conspicuously absent from public view.\n\nBut he broke his silence a little more than a month later on Jan. 26 in a letter published in Granma, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, giving a qualified endorsement of the détente.\n\nApr. 19, 2016\n\nIn Farewell, Castro Urges Party to Fulfill His Vision\n\nMr. Castro bids farewell to Cuba’s Communist Party, telling members that he will soon die and urging them to fulfill his communist vision.\n\n“Soon, I will be 90,” says Mr. Castro, 89, who speaks in a strong but rasping voice at the close of a four-day party congress in Havana.\n\n“Our turn comes to us all,” adds Mr. Castro, who makes his longest public address in years, “but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure.”\n\nNov. 25, 2016\n\nFidel Castro, Cuban Revolutionary Who Defied U.S., Dies at 90\n\nMr. Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the United States for nearly half a century as Cuba’s maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died Friday. He was 90.\n\nHis death was announced by Cuban state television.\n\nIn declining health for several years, Mr. Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his Communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when he was felled by a serious illness. He provisionally ceded much of his power to his younger brother Raúl, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as president. Raúl Castro, who had fought alongside Fidel Castro from the earliest days of the insurrection and remained minister of defense and his brother’s closest confidant, has ruled Cuba since then, although he has told the Cuban people he intends to resign in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement"
