He was born on June 23, 1982 in New Braunfels, TX, to Nicolas and Virginia Sanchez and was blessed with an additional set of parents Robert and Bernadette Sullivent. Carlos was a loving father of two beautiful children who were his entire world, to whom he cherished every moment he had with them. Carlos was a Certified Training Manager for Take 5 Oil Change. He had a passion for movies, cooking, having fun, drinking beer, and chasing a good time. Carlos had the biggest and most generous heart. His kind smile and contagious laughter never made anyone feel alone. When you were with Carlos you were always as close as family.\n\nHe is survived by two beautiful children Francisco and Mila Sanchez; their loving mother Priscilla Garcia; his devoted significant other Kristy Hinojos and her two children Dezeray and Tonyray; mother Virginia Sanchez and parents Robert and Bernadette Sullivent; 8 brothers Randall Sanchez, Marcos Escobedo (Jolisa), Scott Wagner (Jackalyn), Alex Wagner (Patriz),\n\nCharles Sullivent (Liz), Martin Sullivent, Glenn Wagner, and Ezra McClary (Michelle); 6 sisters Carol Cooper, Karen Lievre (Jim), Kimberly Sanchez (Brian), Tricia Sanchez, Gloria Escobedo, and Wendalyn Long (David); numerous nieces, nephews, and extended family; and an endless number of friends that he loved deeply\n\n.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his father Nicolas P. Sanchez Sr; brothers Carl J. and James L. Cooper, Nicolas P. Sanchez Jr; two brother in laws Raul E. Nevarez, Juan Rios; sister in law Rosemary Sanchez.\n\nHe will be forever missed by his family and friends. Though he is always watching over us, we\n\nhave to follow his last words on earth, â€œTake a number and have a seat\"."
