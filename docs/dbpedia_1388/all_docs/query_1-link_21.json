        "text": "Biochar is a form of carbonized organic matter produced by thermal degradation under hypoxic conditions (pyrolysis) (Lehmann and Joseph 2015). In recent years biochar has gained attention due to its beneficial effects on plants and soil health in agroecosystems. Biochar has been proposed to improve plant germination, regeneration, and restoration (Steiner et al. 2007; Beesley et al. 2011; Lehmann and Joseph 2015). When used as soil amendment, biochar has shown beneficial effects on crops (Yamato et al. 2006; Steiner et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012; Concilco et al. 2018). Biochar can be used to address environmental challenges, for example thanks to its structure and its interactions with the environment, has the potential to reduce greenhouse emissions by sequestering carbon in the soil and this makes it a promising material for climate change mitigation in soils (Luo et al. 2023).\n\nSeveral soil microorganisms are another component that can improve plant growth and development, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are root associated plant symbionts (Smith and Read 2008). AMF provide important ecosystem services including improved plant nutrition, increased tolerance to stress and improved soil structure and fertility (Gianinazzi et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2018). AMF explore the soil in search of water and nutrients such as phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and zinc (Zn), and transport these nutrients to the plant. In exchange, AMF receive carbohydrates from the photosynthesis (Smith and Read 2008).\n\nMaize plants (Zea mays L. Poaceae), one of the most economically important crops used as food, animal feed and industrial products (Ranum et al. 2014), form natural associations with AMF. Maize crops are threatened by various herbivorous insect pests (Bahena-Juárez and Cortez-Mondaca 2015), including the armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a voracious pest able to consume large amounts of foliage (Nagoshi et al. 2018). Commonly, S. frugiperda is found throughout the American continent (Pogue 2002) and has recently invaded Africa and several countries in Asia and even Oceania (Goergen et al. 2016; Nayyar et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2021).\n\nIn multitrophic interactions as that between foliar herbivore insects, plants and soil microorganisms, alterations in the phenotype of each participant can take place, which may impact both positively and negatively the outcome of these interactions (Gehring and Whitham 2002; Contreras-Cornejo et al. 2018). For example, AMF can improve the defense of its host plant, activating its defense mechanisms (Pozo and Azcón, 2007). Biotic interactions between herbivore insects, plants and soil microorganisms are complex, and the impact and specific effect in each of the involved organisms depend on the plant species, microorganism, and guild of the herbivore (Gehring and Whitham 2002; Koricheva et al. 2009).\n\nIn this context, few studies have investigated the combined effect of biochar amendments and mycorrhizal associations on herbivore arthropods (Warnock et al. 2007; Solaiman et al. 2010; Elad et al. 2010; Hou et al. 2015; Cook and de Andrade-Neto 2018; Chen et al. 2019). Because of the ecological and agricultural importance of AMF and the strong potential of biochar, it is important to elucidate whether biochar can alter the multitrophic interaction between maize, AMF and the fall armyworm and, if so, the biochemical and physiological mechanisms involved.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of biochar and AMF on maize and the performance of the pest S. frugiperda. Our hypothesis was that biochar and AMF will improve maize nutrition and growth individually, and to a higher extent when combined, reduce plant damage from S. frugiperda herbivory.\n\nExperimental design, set-up and variables measured\n\nA multifactorial greenhouse experiment was carried out with maize plants with three factors: (1) herbivorous insect (with and without S. frugiperda), (2) biochar (0, 5 and 10% of biochar as a proportion of the soil substrate) and (3) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (without AMF, with a native consortium of AMF and with a pure culture of Rhizophagus irregularis, BEG87). This resulted in 18 treatments with five replicates, for a total of 90 experimental units (2 × 3x3 × 5). The experiment was kept for ten weeks under greenhouse conditions and harvested. Plant biomass parameters including height, shoot and root dry weight, total plant biomass, plant nutrition (C and N concentration), performance of S. frugiperda (herbivory level and larval weight) and percentage of mycorrhizal colonization were evaluated.\n\nPlant material and growth conditions\n\nThe maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid line Asgrow® PUMA genotype was used. An agricultural soil collected in the municipality of Morelia, Michoacán (19°41′09″ N, 101°14′17″ W, 1900 m.a.s.l.), Luvisol type containing 53.2, 19.4 and 27.2% of clay, sand and silt respectively was used López-Carmona et al. (2019). The soil had neutral pH (7.28) and 5.8, 23.2 and 303 ppm of P, N and K, respectively. The soil was mixed with silicate river sand, in a 1:1 (weight/weight) ratio. Subsequently, 200 kg of the mixture were sterilized in a ProGrow® electric sterilizer at 93 °C for 72 h. Then, the soil was fertilized with a complete mineral solution (mg kg−1 of substrate): KH2PO4 (30), K2SO4 (75), CaCl2·2H2O (75), CuSO4 5H2O (2.1), ZnSO4 7H2O (5.4), MnSO4·H2O (10.5), CoSO4·7H2O (0.39), MgSO4·7H2O (45), Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.18) NH4NO3 (30). NH4NO3 (30) was applied weekly from the second week until the end of the experiment. Three maize seeds were sown in each pot. After ten days, two seedlings were removed. Plants were irrigated at 80% field capacity by weight throughout the experiment. Biochar was provided by the Ecotechnologies Laboratory at the Ecosystems and Sustainability Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (IIES-UNAM). It was made from pine wood at a temperature of 700 °C in a top-lit updraft (TLUD) type stove.\n\nFungal growth and plant inoculation experiments\n\nThe AMF used in this work were the following: Rhizophagus irregularis strain BEG87, which was propagated in clover Trifolium sp. L. provided by the Agroecology Laboratory at IIES-UNAM. The native inoculum of AMF used in the experiments was taken from an agricultural soil, containing native AMF present at the site. The mycorrhizal inoculum was applied as suggested by Real-Santillán et al. (2019) with the difference that they applied a greater amount of non-sterile soil (25%). The inoculum in this study consisted of 10% non-sterile soil containing the native AMF and 10% soil containing the R. irregularis strain. These separate AMF inocula were mixed homogeneously with the sterilized soil in a 10:1 (weight/weight) ratio. Biochar was applied in the corresponding treatments at 5 and 10% of the soil (v:v).\n\nThe soil microbiota was restored with native microorganisms (except AMF), following the method proposed by Ames et al. (1987). This procedure was carried out a few days after sowing the seeds, as follows: first, 100 g of soil from each of the non-sterilized soils that served to obtain the native consortium and the R. irregularis strain were ground, mixed homogeneously and dissolved in 1.5 L of water, stirring in a Corning® PC-420D stirrer with a magnetic rod for 1 h at 750 rpm. Next, the solution was filtered through several sieves, each one with a smaller diameter than the previous one (1.68 mm, 1 mm, 0.425 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.035 mm), and finally the solution was sieved through a filter paper. The resulting liquid was mixed homogeneously in 5 L of water and 50 mL was applied to all the plants.\n\nHerbivory assay\n\nSpodoptera frugiperda was used as a model herbivore insect. Larvae of S. frugiperda were obtained from a hatchling from the Biotic Interactions and Altered Habitats Laboratory (IIES-UNAM). Eggs collected from laboratory-mated adults were used to maintain the colony. Larvae were reared on an agar-based optimal semi-synthetic diet (Poitout and Bues 1974) before experimental use. After eight weeks of maize plant growth, five second instar (L2) larvae were placed near the stem apex. Before placing them, the plants were covered with a mesh of French tergal (0.2 mm of pore diameter) to prevent the escape of the larvae. This same process was also carried out on plants that did not carry insects. Each week, plant height measurements were taken.\n\nHarvest and plant analysis\n\nTen weeks after sowing and two weeks after larval exposure, the insects were removed from the plants and weighed on an Ohaus Adventurer Pro® analytical balance (0.001 g accuracy). Subsequently, herbivory was visually evaluated with a severity index with six damage categories: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (0, 1–5, 6–12, 13–25, 26–50 and 51–100% of damaged area, respectively) (Dirzo and Domínguez 1995). Next, roots were separated from the shoot, washed to remove soil debris, dried in a Fisher Scientific® oven at 80 °C for 72 h, and weighed on the analytical balance above mentioned. Roots were stored in plastic bags in a freezer at -20 °C until processing.\n\nAMF root colonization\n\nThe roots were thawed, washed again, and placed in a longitudinal arrangement to be cut transversely 1 cm, and 1 g of root was taken from each sample. Subsequently 10% KOH was added to the roots, which were stained according to Kormanik and McGraw (1982), with the exception that trypan blue was used instead of acid fuchsin. Afterwards, roots were placed in a gridded petri dish with 1 cm separation between lines. Root intercepts were counted with an Olympus® stereoscope at 4X using the intercept method (Giovannetti and Mosse 1980).\n\nDetermination of chemical elements in the plant tissues\n\nThe concentration of total shoot C and N was measured with a FLASH 2000 elemental organic analyzer (Thermo scientific®, Rodano Milan, Italy). For this, dry plants were previously ground in a Thomas Scientific® mill with a number 40 sieve (0.42 mm). Subsequently, each sample was weighed and encapsulated in tin containers of 3 to 3.5 µg, and introduced into the analyzer at a temperature of 950 °C (Krotz et al. 2016). The Eager Xperience® 1.3 software was used to determine the concentrations of C and N (mg g−1).\n\nData analysis\n\nData were analyzed using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The LSD (Least significant differences) test was used to find differences between factor treatment means. The assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity were verified with the Andersen-Darling and Bartlett tests, respectively. The percentage of AMF root colonization was angularly transformed (Zar 1999). All analyses were performed with 95% confidence. A structural equation model was used to test direct and indirect effects of biochar and colonization on herbivory, fall armyworm weight, total biomass and carbon/nitrogen relation. We chose the model with the best global goodness of fit with the pairwise SEM package in R 3.6.2 (www.r-project.org/), testing hypotheses that made biological sense. For the graphs, Sigma plot® 14.0 (https://systatsoftware.com/products/sigmaplot/) and Origin® 2018 SR1 (www.originlab.com/) were used. Figure 5 representing the path analysis was made with the Inkscape 1.1 software www.inkscape.org.\n\nIn the present study, individual and combined effects of biochar and AMF on maize plants growth and nutrition, and performance of the herbivore insect S. frugiperda were evaluated. Our results show only individual effects of biochar and AMF, rejecting the hypothesis that the combination of biochar and AMF would result in increased maize nutrition and growth to a higher extent than individually, leading to reduced plant damage from S. frugiperda herbivory. However, the structural equation model showed complex direct and indirect relationships between biochar, plants, and fall armyworm. These interactions are mediated by mycorrhiza and plant nutrients.\n\nContrary to our expectations biochar soil application reduced maize growth, with the highest dose resulting in the strongest maize growth suppression. As the dose of biochar was increased, a reduction in the amount of damage caused by insects to plants was observed, that is, there was a decrease in insect herbivory in both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal maize plants. Other studies have reported that biochar decreased or had no effect on biomass production in maize (Gaskin et al. 2010; Güereña et al. 2013). In this sense, reduced plant development has also been found in other crops after soil amendment with biochar (McClellan et al. 2007; Rondon et al. 2007; Van Zwieten et al. 2010). However, beneficial effects of biochar on maize plants, both in terms of fresh total plant biomass and yield has also been observed (Yamato et al 2006; Major et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012). Therefore, the effect of biochar seems to vary most likely depending on the conditions such as crop type, fertilization, growth substrate, and the material, temperature and pressure used in biochar preparation method, which can play a decisive role in its capacity to retain and release nutrients (Rajkovich et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012; Agrafioti et al. 2013).\n\nIn addition, negative effects on the development of maize with biochar produced at lower temperatures have also been reported (Rajkovich et al. 2012). Furthermore, biochar with a low content of volatile matter (such as ash) can be beneficial for plants and, on the contrary, a high ash content can cause negative effect on plant growth (McClellan et al. (2007). However, this negative effect is likely to be observed in each season during the first five years of maize growth, as mentioned by Major et al. (2010), observing no positive results in the first year of maize planting, but the opposite in the following three years. In this regard, Lehmann and Joseph (2015) pointed out that one of the advantages of using biochar as an amendment is that it remains stable for a long time, which can ultimately improve plant growth. Hence, we cannot rule out that biochar used in the present study made with pine wood, retained nutrients instead of releasing them, as observed in the case of the C:N ratio at 10% amendment with lower shoot C:N ratio, and this may have had negative effects that translated into reduced plant biomass. It is therefore necessary to experiment with varying pyrolysis temperatures in order to optimize and standardize its production to improve plant growth.\n\nThere is increasing interest among researchers on the influence of biochar on herbivorous insects (Hou et al. 2015). In the present study, biochar decreased herbivory by S. frugiperda. Similar studies have reported negative impacts on insects of the Lepidoptera family when using biochar. For example, Bakhat et al. (2020) found a reduction in damage by the borer Leucinodes orbonalis Guenée (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to brinjal plants, decreasing its growth as the level of biochar amendments increased. In the same way, Chen et al. (2019) reported higher mortality of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), when fed on rice plants grown with high biochar levels. In addition, negative effects have also been found on feeding, development, fertility, infestation and incidence of insects such as Aphidoidea Hymenoptera and Hemiptera (Elad et al. 2010; Hou et al. 2015; Cook and de Andrade-Neto 2018; Fu et al. 2018: Bakhat et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Bonanomi et al. (2021).\n\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms by which biochar affects phytophagous insects remain unknown, but plant defense is likely to be increased (Waqas et al. 2018). Bakhat et al. (2020) observed that silicon (Si) content increased in rice plants with biochar amendments. It is known that Si affects the resistance of plants to various orders of herbivorous insects and pathogens in various crops (Castellanos-González et al. 2015; Ratnadass et al. 2024) including the armyworm (Nagaratna et al. 2022). In this sense, Pavani et al. (2023) tested biochar made from rice hulls and imidazole (a Si solubilizer), both rich in Si, and found a reduction in fall armyworm damage and a reduction in the percentage of infestation in maize plants. Besides, agronomic parameters were positively influenced.\n\nFurthermore, defense against herbivorous insects can be influenced by various pathways activated by phytohormones that regulate plant development, such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid and ethylene (Bari and Jones 2009; Fenn and Giovannoni 2021). However, the interactions that trigger this defense are extremely complex and may even be bidirectional. It is known that soil microorganisms, such as AMF, can induce resistance (Pozo and Azcón, 2007), but it is also possible that herbivorous insects, such as the maize earworm, modify the expression pathways of jasmonic acid, affecting its levels and concentrations (Ankala et al. 2013). In addition to its role in defense, this phytohormone (JA) can influence mutualism with AMF (Hause et al. 2007).\n\nNo parameters of resistance were evaluated in the present study, but it would be interesting to evaluate defense in plants under these conditions. It was observed that AMF root colonization in terms of single factor effects was greater in treatments with biochar. It is known that microbial activity tends to increase with increasing biochar application (Steiner et al. 2008; Kolb et al. 2009), possibly due to its high porosity, favoring the development of soil microbiota and therefore offering a microhabitat to the extraradical hyphae of AMF, which can easily spread and sporulate on the porous surfaces (Pietikäinen et al. 2000; Saito and Marumoto 2002). Additionally, biochar can induce changes in root exudates that in turn influence plant processes and can impact C cycling in soils (Pei et al. 2020). For example, charcoal can stimulate mycorrhizal colonization in crops (Warnock et al. 2007), as noted by Steiner et al. (2004) and Yamato et al. (2006) when observing that the root colonization rate of AMF increased after the application of biochar. In this sense, in wheat and clover plants Solaiman et al. (2010), observed a greater AMF root colonization when biochar was applied and this in turn had a positive effect on plant development. This was also pointed out by Matsubara et al. (1995), who added biochar to volcanic soils inoculated with Glomus etunicatum. On the contrary, some studies have shown that biochar can decrease AMF root colonization, as observed by Abenza (2012), while in other studies no effect was found on the number of AMF spores or root colonization (Rondon et al. 2007). Moreover, the effect of biochar amendments on the microbial communities in the rhizosphere will depend not only on the type of biochar, but also on the host plant. This is relevant since the exudates that reach the roots from photosynthesis can impact microbial communities in the rhizosphere and influence biogeochemical cycles (Schoonhoven et al. 2005).\n\nPlants and AMF form complex interactions that can affect herbivorous insect communities and vice versa (Gehring and Whitham 2002; Koricheva et al. 2009). In the present study, herbivory by S. frugiperda reduced AMF root colonization, as observed in other studies (Gehring and Whitham 2002; Gehring and Bennett 2009). It is possible that this negative effect due to herbivory by chewing insects is due to a lower flow of photosynthates towards the roots due to the destruction of the photosynthetic machinery (Gange et al. 2002). In this regard, Markkola et al. (2004) mentioned that, to maintain the plant-AMF symbiosis, it is necessary to allocate large amounts of photosynthates to the rhizosphere and, therefore, the loss of leaf area has a negative impact on the ability to maintain AMF. In addition, this decrease in exudates can also impact the community of interacting microorganisms in the rhizosphere (Schoonhoven et al. 2005).\n\nIn field and laboratory work, Gange et al. (2002) observed that herbivory by the phytophagous insect Arctia caja L. (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), reduced AMF root colonization in Plantago lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae), but had no effect on AMF root colonization in Senecio jacobaea L. (Asteraceae). Also, in Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae), Wamberg et al. (2003) found that when subject to herbivory by the weevil Sitona lineatus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) AMF root colonization was reduced. However, AMF colonization also reduced herbivory.\n\nHerbivory can also increase AMF root colonization as observed by Kula et al. (2005), in pastures attacked by grasshoppers. However, other studies did not find such an effect (Kosola et al. 2004; Wearn and Gange 2007).\n\nIn the present study, herbivory by S. frugiperda reduced AMF root colonization and took advantage of the symbiosis to obtain a better development, which translated into a higher larval weight, regardless of the deterrent effect created by the concentrations of biochar.\n\nThere are several studies where herbivores have better development and life parameters in mycorrhizal plants (Gange and West 1994; Tomczak et al. 2016; Bernaola et al. 2018). Consistent with this work, Goverde et al. (2000) pointed out that the survival and larval weight of the butterfly Polyommatus icarus Rottemburg (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) fed with mycorrhizal plants of Lotus corniculatus L. (Fabaceae), were greater than those of larvae fed with non-mycorrhizal plants. In the same sense, Barber (2013), Real-Santillán et al. (2019) and García-Gómez et al. (2021) observed that larvae of Spodoptera exigua Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and S. frugiperda consumed a significantly higher amount of leaf tissue in mycorrhizal plants. It is possible that a better nutritional quality of the shoot tissue provided by the AMF is the cause of a better larval development of S. frugiperda (Real-Santillán et al. 2019; García-Gómez et al. 2021). Some authors mention that the association between plants and AMF can modulate defense by inducing plant resistance to herbivores (Pozo and Azcón, 2007; Tao et al. 2016). However, in this work, as mentioned before, no defense parameter was evaluated. Finally, the interactions between AMF and herbivorous insects mediated by the host plant are very complex and can have varying effects (positive, negative and neutral) that will depend on several factors, such as the species of insects, the mycorrhizal inoculum used and the host plant (Gehring and Whitham 2002)."
