        "text": "With deepest sorrow, we announce that Raul Luigi Garcia, age 36, our most beloved son, father, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin, uncle and friend passed suddenly on December 2, 2019.\n\nThose who knew Raul, even just a little, lost a shining light in their lives.\n\nBorn at St. Mary’s Hospital in Orange, NJ, to parents Nestor and Maria (Viola) Garcia. Raul attended Our Lady of Lourdes in West Orange, NJ, until the 5th grade when he moved to Mendham, NJ. He graduated Mendham High School in 2001 and attended Morris County College for Hotel/Restaurant Management. He worked in the restaurant business for many years before securing a job in sales, while living in Long Branch, NJ, the last years of his time with us.\n\nRaul loved life! He loved cooking and going out to eat with family and friends. He was passionate about music. In his free time he enjoyed going to the beach, watching movies, skiing and talking with/meeting new friends. He enjoyed laughing and learning from others. He was happiest when spending time with family and friends, which he adored. He especially loved the holidays when the family was all together. Raul never failed to make his friends and family laugh, and the memory of his beautiful soul will be cherished forever.\n\nRaul will be terribly missed everyday by his parents Nestor and Maria (Viola) Garcia, his son Joseph Garcia, his sister Lelia Topalanchik and brother-in-law Matthew Topalanchik, his nephews Anthony and Nicholas Topalanchik, his grandmother (nonna) Agostina Palmieri, his uncle and aunt Luigi and Donna Viola, his uncle Vincent Viola, his cousins Kristin and Katelyn Viola, his girlfriend Katie Jones and his many more loving family members and close friends.\n\nA private funeral was held for his family on December 5, 2019. A Memorial Mass open to family and friends in remembrance of Raul will be held on his birthday, Friday, February 14, 2020 at 6 PM at St. Joseph’s Church, 8 W. Main Street, Mendham, NJ."
