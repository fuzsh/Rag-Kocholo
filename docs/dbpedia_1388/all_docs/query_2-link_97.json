        "text": "Spain beat Belgium 3-2, surprising many who had tipped the Belgians for a medal. Germany edged out Argentina 3-2 in a tightly contested match that came down to the final moments. India and the Netherlands were the other semi-finalists to battle it out this 5 August.\n\nThe first ones to take place this 5 August in the Olympic Village were China and Australia Women's Teams. China ended up victors in a thrilling match 3-2 against pre-match favourites Australia, courtesy of scores from Ma Ning, Dan Wen, and Zhong Jiaqi. The Asian team were 3-1 up in the third quarter before Tatum Stewart's goal on 45 minutes ensured it would be a fierce finish.\n\nBut China held on to take their place in the final four and there were understandably scenes of total jubilation for the team in red after. They are just one win away from securing a first Olympic medal in women's hockey since their home Games in 2008.\n\n\"Las Leonas\" from Argentina beat Germany on penalties to reach the semi-finals. The Argentine women's hockey team had a dramatic match, where they equalised just before the end with the goalkeeper vital in the final minutes. More than a minute before the final whistle, Julieta Jankunas deflected in a short corner from Agustina Gorzelany to level the scores. In the shoot-out, Germany was unable to convert on all four attempts, with Consentino making three saves and one deflection.\n\nDespite an extraordinary performance by star goalkeeper Clara Perez, Spain succumbed to the Yves du Manoir in the quarter-finals in the second match of the day. They will go on to win an Olympic diploma, just as they did at Tokyo 2020 and Rio 2016.\n\nThe Red Panthers will be contesting their second semi-final at an Olympic tournament. Belgium showed why they are the best defending team. Carlos Garc√≠a Cuenca's team did not have their day against an opponent who controlled them at all times and increased their pressure and intensity in the last quarter, which is when the two goals came for the Belgians, who will face China in the semi-finals, while on the other side of the draw, the Netherlands will face Argentina.\n\nThe Redsticks hardly troubled their opponents' goal and if you don't get there and score on the few chances you have, it is very difficult to beat a team like the Belgians, with a place in the semi-finals of an Olympic Games at stake.\n\nMen's Hockey recap\n\nSpain beat Belgium 3-2, surprising many who had tipped the Belgians for a medal. Germany edged out Argentina 3-2 in a tightly contested match that came down to the final moments. India and the Netherlands are the other semi-finalists. The semi-finals will take place on Tuesday, while the women's quarter-finals begin on Monday.\n\nIn men's field hockey, Spain scored an important 3-2 victory over Belgium, defying all pre-tournament predictions and avenging their 3-1 defeat at Tokyo 2020. This triumph booked Spain's place in the semi-finals of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, with a double chance of winning a medal. Spain's goals came from Jose Maria Basterra, Marc Reyne and Marc Miralles.\n\nAfter an intense opening period, India and Great Britain kicked off a much-anticipated quarter-final clash. Great Britain were out to avenge their defeat at Tokyo 2020, when India won 3-1.\n\nIn a tightly contested match, which was marred by the suspension of India's Amit Rohidas for punching William Calnan in the face with his stick (2 minutes into the second quarter), the recent Olympic bronze medallists had to play a defensive game for the majority of the match, despite taking the lead through Harmanpreet Singh's goal from a penalty corner (22').\n\nGreat Britain equalised through Lee Morton (27') and tried to turn the game around, but they couldn't match the outstanding performance of the Indian goalkeeper (man of the match) and the match ended in a 1-1 draw at the end of normal time.\n\nThe Indian goalkeeper was also instrumental in the penalty shoot-out that decided the semi-final place, saving one of the two penalties the English missed. The Netherlands, who finished second in their group, lived up to the pre-match hype and triumphed over Australia, who finished third. The Europeans avenged their previous meeting when the Kangaroos won 3-0 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time.\n\nThis match, however, was one of European dominance from start to finish, although the goals came in the second half. Duco Telgenkamp scored the Netherlands' first goal from a penalty corner 10 minutes into the third quarter. Despite Australia's best efforts to equalise, Thijs van Dam sealed the Netherlands' place in the semi-finals with a second goal seven minutes from time, setting up a meeting with Spain.\n\nThe match between Argentina and Germany began in a similar vein, with the score level at 1-1 after the first quarter. Buenos Aires-born Gonzalo Peillat, who won the gold medal with Argentina at Rio 2016, celebrated passionately after scoring Germany's second goal from a penalty corner, his speciality.\n\nAt the start of the third quarter, the second half remained evenly balanced, although Germany looked the stronger side. Argentina struggled against a physically strong German defence. With 12 minutes remaining, Agustin Mazzili deflected in a shot to make it 2-2 and set up a fierce battle for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nIn the final moments, Germany took the lead with 6 minutes remaining and then defended the result as best they could. With 3 minutes remaining, Argentina attempted a desperate comeback by taking off their goalkeeper and bringing on an extra field player. They won a couple of penalty corners, but Germany's young goalkeeper made crucial saves as time ran out.\n\nThe semi-finals will be played on Tuesday 6 August at 14:00 and 19:00 CEST with Spain v Netherlands and India v Germany battling for medals in the same stadium that hosted the last Olympic Games in France exactly a century ago. The group stage of the Paris 2024 Women's Hockey Tournament ended last Saturday and the quarter-final matches have now been confirmed.\n\nChina vs. Australia, Germany vs. Argentina, Netherlands vs. Great Britain and Belgium vs. Spain will be played on Monday 5 August at 10:00, 12:30, 17:30 and 20:00 CEST. The winners will progress to the semi-finals, where they will compete for a medal at the Yves-du-Manoir Olympic Stadium in Colombes."
