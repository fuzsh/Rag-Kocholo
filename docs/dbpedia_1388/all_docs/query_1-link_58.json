        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nPedro Almodóvar has toyed with film noir before, most memorably in his 1997 film \"Live Flesh.\" But his newest movie, \"Bad Education,\" is a delirious, headlong immersion and re-invention of a style that has lured countless filmmakers onto its treacherous shoals. Because we live in a shameless age, this genre -- synonymous with secrets, shadows and twisty, hairpin-turning plots that point toward an abyss -- often seems forced when its conventions are recycled in our tell-all tabloid environment.\n\nBut Mr. Almodóvar, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which film noir is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. He believes in the passions bordering on obsessions that drive films noirs. Any movie that refuses to deliver that emotional payload, he also knows, is only a shell, no matter how clever its construction.\n\nA successful film noir is an act of seduction, in which storytelling, music and imagery lead us to imagine a shadow world of infinite temptation and corruption. Traditionally, the designated siren who lures us into the shallows is a toxic femme fatale as ruthless as she is irresistible.\n\nThe coup de grâce of \"Bad Education,\" which ricochets back and forth between 1964 and 1980, with a finale set mostly in 1977, is that here the femme fatale is a predatory pre-operative transsexual named Ignacio. Once a beautiful boy soprano, he/she was abused by a priest, Father Manolo (Daniel Giménez Cacho), the principal of his Catholic boys' school. The priest was so besotted with him that he expelled Ignacio's boyfriend Enrique (Raúl García Forneiro) from the school after catching the two hiding in the shower. Or so Ignacio's version of the story has it.\n\nThe grown-up Ignacio is played by two actors, Gael García Bernal (pouty and doe-eyed) and Francisco Boira (lupine and feral). As the film deepens and the characters' mistaken and multiple identities accumulate, and the priest returns from the past in a new, desperate guise, \"Bad Education\" evokes Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo,\" with its confusions of fantasy and reality. \"Bad Education\" is further enriched by the notion of different versions of the same story subjected to modification, first as literature, then as a movie spooled through different characters' imaginations. Only at the end are some, but not all, of the facts revealed.\n\nBecause the figure of Ignacio is sexually ambiguous on the most fundamental level, you don't mind the absence of a major female character in \"Bad Education.\" The attraction and repulsion exerted by the two Ignacios lend the film all the sinister heat and tension you could hope for. Mr. Bernal, who plays three interlocking roles, is a transcendent dramatic chameleon shuffling three faces: ambitious actor, drag temptress and ruthless hustler.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
