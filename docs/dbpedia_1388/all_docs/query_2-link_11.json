Longoria’s career began in 1998, when she won the title of Miss Corpus Christi, and later began entering talent contests that led her to Los Angeles; shortly after, she was spotted and signed by a theatrical agent. Longoria’s breakout role was that of Isabella Braña on the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless from 2001 to 2003. From 2004, she starred as Gabrielle Solis on the ABC television series Desperate Housewives for 8 seasons ending in 2012. For her work on Desperate Housewives, she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy and five Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations, winning two. Longoria was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the youngest of four daughters born to ninth-generation Mexican-American (Tejano) parents Ella Eva (Mireles) and Enrique Longoria, Jr. She was raised Roman Catholic. While in high school she worked at a Wendy’s restaurant part-time for three years. Longoria received her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology at nearby Texas A&M University-Kingsville.

She has performed in a variety of music genres, including jazz, pop and country, but has enjoyed her greatest success singing in Spanish. Cardona was born in El Paso, Texas.

Her first single to achieve success was \"He's a Rebel\", which in 1962 reached #5 in Australia and #115 in the United States.

He shoots and produces many of his films in Mexico and his home state, Texas. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film El Mariachi, which was a commercial success after grossing $2 million against a budget of $7,000. The film spawned two sequels known collectively as the Mexico Trilogy: Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. He directed From Dusk till Dawn in 1996 and developed its television adaptation series (2014–present). Rodriguez co-directed the 2005 neo-noir crime thriller anthology Sin City (adapted from the graphic novel of the same name) and the 2014 sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Rodriguez also directed the Spy Kids films, The Faculty, as well as The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, Planet Terror, and Machete. He is a friend and frequent collaborator of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who founded the production company A Band Apart, which Rodriguez was a member of. In December 2013, Rodriguez launched his own cable television channel, El Rey. Rodríguez was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican-American parents Rebecca (née Villegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodríguez, a salesman. He began his interest in film at age eleven, when his father bought one of the first VCRs, which came with a camera. While attending St. Anthony High School Seminary in San Antonio, Rodríguez was commissioned to videotape the school's football games. According to his sister, he was fired soon afterward as he had shot footage in a cinematic style, getting shots of parents' reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. In high school he met Carlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college. Rodriguez went to the College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, where he also developed a love of cartooning. Not having grades high enough to be accepted into the school's film program, he created a daily comic strip entitled Los Hooligans. Many of the characters were based on his siblings – in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic ran for three years in the student newspaper The Daily Texan, while Rodríguez continued to make short films.\n\nVicente Fernández\n\nRanchera Singer\n\nVicente \"Chente\" Fernández Gómez (born February 17, 1940) is a Mexican retired singer, actor, and film producer. Nicknamed as \"El Rey de la Cancion Ranchera\" (The King of Ranchera Music) throughout the Hispanosphere, Fernández started his career singing for tips on the street, and has since become a cultural icon, recording more than 50 albums and contributing to more than 30 films. He is the father of the popular singer Alejandro Fernández and Vicente Fernandez Jr, and uncle of Jackeline (\"Jackie\") Fernandez. For over 50 years, Vicente Fernandez has maintained his position as the greatest living singer of Mexico, gathering an operatic vocal range, with a deep understanding of the roots of ranchera music. He is renowned for his melodramatic voice.[citation needed] In the dozens of Mexican films in which he has been a star, a role he often was left to perfection: the proud charro, or Mexican cowboy. Although less well-known to English-speaking audiences, Fernandez has consistently filled stadiums and venues throughout his 55-plus years of performing.[citation needed] His repertoire consists of rancheras and other Mexican classics. He is accompanied live by a mariachi group, but he is not technically a mariachi musician, as he plays no instrument live. Fernandez's work has earned him two Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, fourteen Lo Nuestro Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has sold over 50 million copies worldwide. He has an estimated net worth USD 25 million.\n\nDr. Carlos Orozco\n\nPhysician\n\nDr. Carlos Orozco and Dr. Hugo Castañeda, two San Antonio physicians who stopped by a park in Mexico City while they were on a medical mission, dedicated themselves to returning Milam to a people’s park. As a result of their discussions about the purpose and vision of Milam Park, the Friends of Milam Park was formed under the umbrella of the San Antonio Parks Foundation. That same year, the 10 foot high concrete walls built during the 1976 renovation project were knocked down to make way for the park’s latest renovation. The park was renovated to include game tables where senior citizens could play dominos and checkers; a children’s playscape and water feature; a walking/jogging trail; new benches and trees. The centerpiece of the park is the Jalisco Pavilion. Through Dr. Orozco’s efforts under the auspices of the Friends of Milam Park and the San Antonio Parks Foundation, volunteers from USAA, Fort Sam Houston, Valero and others laid 200,000 cherry red and mocha D’Hanis bricks in the park’s promenade in 1993 and 1994. Private donations made it possible to place 60 park benches throughout the park in those same years.\n\nJudge Juan F. Vasquez\n\nJudge of the United States Tax Court\n\nJuan F.

Julián Castro was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Maria “Rosie” Castro and Jessie Guzman. He is the identical twin brother of current United States Representative Joaquín Castro. His mother was a Chicanapolitical activist who helped establish the Chicano political party La Raza Unida and who ran unsuccessfully for the San Antonio City Council in 1971. Castro once stated, “My mother is probably the biggest reason my brother and I are in public service. Growing up, she would take us to a lot of rallies and organizational meetings and other things that are very boring for an 8-9 year old.” Castro’s Texan roots trace back to 1920, when his grandmother Victoria Castro joined extended family members there as a six year-old orphan from northern Mexico. In 2007, Castro married Erica Lira, an elementary school teacher. In 2009, their daughter Carina Castro was born. On December 27, 2014, Castro announced via Twitter the birth of the couple’s child, a son, Cristián Julián Castro.\n\nHeriberto \"Berto\" Guerra, Jr.\n\nBusinessman\n\nHeriberto “Berto” Guerra Jr. was appointed chairman of the San Antonio Water System Board of Trustees in 2011.

Kennedy described Cesar Chavez as \"one of the heroic figures of our time.\" A true American hero, Cesar was a civil rights, Latino and farm labor leader; a genuinely religious and spiritual figure; a community organizer and social entrepreneur; a champion of militant nonviolent social change; and a crusader for the environment and consumer rights. A first-generation American, he was born on March 31, 1927, near his family's small homestead in the North Gila River Valley outside Yuma, Arizona. At age 11, his family lost their farm during the Great Depression and became migrant farm workers. Throughout his youth and into adulthood, Cesar traveled the migrant streams throughout California laboring in the fields, orchards and vineyards, where he was exposed to the hardships and injustices of farm worker life. After attending numerous schools as the family migrated, Cesar finished his formal education after the eighth grade and worked the fields full-time to help support his family. Although his formal education ended then, he later satisfied an insatiable intellectual curiosity and was self-taught on an eclectic range of subjects through reading during the rest of his life. Cesar joined the U.S. Navy in 1946, in the aftermath of World War II, and served in the Western Pacific. He returned from the service in 1948 to marry Helen Fabela, whom he met while working in fields and vineyards around Delano. Together they settled in the East San Jose barrio of Sal Si Puedes (Get Out if You Can), and had eight children, later enjoying 31 grandchildren.\n\nJesse Treviño\n\nArtist\n\nSon of San Antonio, Vietnam Veteran, American Hero, Artist - Jesse Treviño has spent his life honoring the City he loves though the creation of breathtaking images which have become inextricably intertwined with the image of San Antonio, Texas. The level of precision and beauty captured by Treviño on his canvases has led him to be called one of America's finest realist painters and muralists. Treviño won his first art contest at the age of six (6). He attended Fox Technical High School where he honed his artistic skills leading to an art scholarship. The reality of Treviño's amazing talent is made all the more stunning by the series of events that conspired to deprive the world of it. While attending the Art Students League on scholarship in New York, with plans to continue his studies in Paris, Treviño received his draft notice for Vietnam. On February 23, 1967, Treviño was hit by the blast of a booby trap and a sniper's bullet, the 19-year-old lay bleeding in a rice paddy, his body peppered with shrapnel. Injected with morphine on the battlefield, Treviño recalls his thoughts: \"I was thinking about my mother, my brothers, the barrio where I grew up in San Antonio and all those images — 'I want to paint them,' that's what I was thinking: 'If there's any way I can come out of this alive, I'm going to paint those places and those people.' “Ultimately, Treviño lost his right arm and painting hand to his injuries. Overcoming physical pain and depression he trained himself to paint with his left hand. He enrolled in a drawing course at San Antonio College and later earned his Bachelor's Degree from Our Lady of the Lake University and a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio. In 1984, Treviño was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Awards Medal by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in Washington D.C. where he presented a painting of the Alamo to President Ronald Reagan. In 1994, Treviño's work was featured in a one man show at the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. where two of Treviño's paintings are included in our Nation's permanent collection. And more recently in 2009, a second major one-man show, a career retrospective at the Smithsonian affiliated Museo Alameda, featured a chronological look at Treviño's work from child prodigy to mature master. In recent years, Treviño has focused on large scale public art projects such as the nine-story one-hundred foot tall mosaic mural on the facade of Christus Santa Rosa Children's Hospital titled “Spirit of Healing”. This project and others such as “La Veladora” on the Guadalupe Theater, a 40-foot three-dimensional mosaic dedicated to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks and his latest work in progress, a 130 foot tall Veterans Monument Tower at Elmendorf Lake in San Antonio’s Westside, are and will be destinations and landmarks in San Antonio for generations to come. Treviño’s legacy is a testament to his battlefield promise to dedicate his talent to paint the things that really matter to him. In his own words, \"My whole career as an artist is in terms of what kind of things I can do here in San Antonio to make it a much more beautiful place\".\n\nLionel Sosa\n\nArtist and Marketing Consultant\n\nLionel Sosa is an independent marketing consultant and nationally recognized portrait artist.

Her father, Romulo Munguia, was a printer and political activist who fled the violence and made his way to San Antonio in 1926. He found work at the Spanish-language La Prensa and was followed here by his family. The Munguia family settled in the Prospect Hill neighborhood in the nascent West Side barrio. Over the course of three generations the extended family always has lived within a few blocks of that first home. Elvira met George Cisneros, an infantry man who survived three years of combat in the Pacific Theater and rose to the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves. Together they would have five children. The high profile achieved by Henry and the other Cisneros siblings obscured the role Elvira played in the city in an era when women, especially Mexican-American women, had to make their own opportunities to advance. World War II interrupted her studies at the University of Texas at Austin. With her brothers serving in the Army and Army Air Corps, Elvira came home to work in her father’s printing business and attend business school to become a bookkeeper, which led to a job at Frost Bank.

The second oldest of seven siblings, Mungia would never leave home during his active duty stint. Now a successful and heavily connected insider in San Antonio's local political scene, Mungia, a high school dropout, runs a family-owned print shop that has been operating in the same predominantly-Latino West Side neighborhood for nearly seven decades. It was post-war boomtown San Antonio, and he and his wife Martha, who married in 1945 after he left the service, were looking to buy land to build a house. \"We found the place we liked, filled out all the forms and we were told the deal had been accepted. The next day, the sales promoter asks about my name, he said he was not familiar with the name, and asked what it was. “I said, proudly, 'I'm Mexican,'\" Munguia recalled. \"All of a sudden, the guy said there was a slight problem with the paperwork and could he call me back? \"I said, 'No, you so-and-so. I know what you are doing, not selling to me 'cause I am Mexican. To hell with you.' And I called off the deal.\" It was that incident that would make Mungia decide to join such groups as LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) and the American G.I. Forum, which were founded to promote Latino interests and openly denounce racial discrimination. It was what Mungia calls the more subtle instances of discrimination that led him in 1950 to be among a small group of businessmen -- he was the only Hispanic -- to promote Henry B. Gonzalez's first attempt to become a state representative in Austin.\n\nFrank Herrera\n\nAttorney for the National Labor Relations Board\n\nAdmitted to the bar in 1967, Mr. Herrera served as an attorney for the National Labor Relations Board.

He lived on the streets of San Diego, landed a job grooming dogs, and soon gained a reputation for his calming effect on even the most difficult cases. With a few dollars in his pocket, he moved north to Los Angeles and took a job washing cars. With the money he saved, he started a freelance dog rehabilitation service, primarily offering his expertise with extreme cases. This led him to open his first Dog Psychology Center, which eventually became the current 43-acre site in the Santa Clarita Valley, now including a sheep herding area, air conditioned kennels, swimming pool, obstacle course, and hiking trails. The Dog Psychology Center is a featured location in “Cesar 911.” In addition to co-authoring six books, Cesar has created numerous instructional DVDs and continues to host a popular series of seminars where attendees learn how to apply his extensive knowledge of dog psychology and rehabilitation techniques.

As a result of their discussions about the purpose and vision of Milam Park, the Friends of Milam Park was formed under the umbrella of the San Antonio Parks Foundation. That same year, the 10 foot high concrete walls built during the 1976 renovation project were knocked down to make way for the park's latest renovation. The park was renovated to include game tables where senior citizens could play dominos and checkers; a children's playscape and water feature; a walking/jogging trail; exercise stations and new benches and trees. The centerpiece of the new vision of the park was a 26-foot copper-roofed gazebo designed by Jalisco architect Salvador de Alba Martin where groups were able to perform. Dubbed the \"Jalisco Pavilion,\" the gazebo was officially presented to the City of San Antonio in July 1993. The gazebo features cast-iron columns and railings and a cantera stone base. It was made possible through a cooperative effort with Guadalajara, a San Antonio Sister City, and the state of Jalisco.\n\nGilbert Duran\n\nArtist Non Grata\n\nHe has a mysterious sadness that surrounds him yet a compilation of severe intensity and quiet gentleness masked with a sense of surreal dominance is what defines him. His painting is sporadic with endless weeks of contemplating a painting and not being able to lift a paintbrush followed by an incurable sense of urgency to create. All that is heard are the frantic strokes of a brush against a virgin canvas tied to an ancient easel waiting in anticipation for what is to come. The echo of erratic brushes striking iridescent linen taunts his imagination and drowns out the haunting music of a weeping violin that drifts endlessly through a glassless window. He will pace back and forth on his chameleon-colored floors like a famished leopard contemplating his prey. He will paint for days, canvas after canvas, color upon color, destroying sable brushes in turmoil with no regard for food or sleep. Only when his compulsion to paint has been conceived will he finally lay down his brushes and then be consumed by his creations; spinning into devastation of self-doubt. Exhausted and filled with anguish he will contemplate painting over everything he has\n\nLuis Lopez\n\nArtist\n\nBorn Rio Bravo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, Luis Lopez migrated to the United States in the 70s. Lopez initiated his career as an artist in 1975. He spent several years cultivating his artistic knowledge and worked on various public art projects and exhibitions of his work. Public interest in Lopez talent increased and he began receiving various commissions throughout the United States and Mexico. With the success of establishing a reputation for himself as a Fine Artist, Lopez built a permanent home for his art studio and gallery in San Antonio called La Casa Rosa in the historic Tobin Hill.

Under his supervision, more than ten different locations and galleries in the Tobin Hill area are displaying art and sculptures from local artists. His efforts have resulted in attracting attention to the Tobin Hill historical community. Lopez spends part of his time painting at his newest studio in the mountains of Hidalgo, Mexico where he finds solace and inspiration.\n\nRobert Ytuarte\n\nArtist\n\nA unique combination of study, work and travel has allowed internationally known artist Robert Ytuarte to develop an unusually powerful style that is unique among his peers. A native of San Antonio, Texas, Robert relocated early in his career to California in pursuit of his dreams and love of art, which led him to San Francisco. This where he focused on learning the techniques of the old masters, combining colors and textures. While studying and doing Portraits, he focused on perfecting his art. During his stay in California, Robert was approached by the publishing firm, Visual Creations, to design a piece of art work which they published. From this original piece, Robert then designed a line of greeting cards based on a variety of children’s books portrayed by a humorous cat and mouse —“Smarty Cats”. Drawn to the diverse culture of New Orleans, Robert furthered his career and developed the singular method of combining different media to create sepia portraits that have become his trademark. It was while working among the many artists in the Jackson Square area of New Orleans, Louisiana, that he created two beautiful sepia works for the 1984 World’s Fair and Mardi Gras which were published. Since returning home to San Antonio, Robert has been perfecting and expanding his talents. He has had many exhibits and has contributed pieces of his art work for fundraisers, one of which was to revitalize Milam Park in 1992. In 1995, he was chosen to design and create an original art work titled “Motion Portraits of George Gervin and James Silas” for the San Antonio Spurs. These huge banners were viewed by thousands at the Alamodome during all home and televised games. In 1996 and 1997, he donated several pieces to the Cameron County Child Welfare Board. The auction was held at the Historic Brownsville Museum and the proceeds went to help prevent Child Abuse. While focusing on his Hispanic culture, Robert combined his style and created a powerful series of paintings that only speak for themselves. Robert started this line in 1997 and is still creating them. He had a one-man exhibit at Galeria Ortiz in Market Square, San Antonio from October 23 to November 15, 1998. The show was a success. At this time, Robert has created more than 48 original paintings in his series titled, “Sombras”. One can also view one of his works at La Margarita Restaurant in San Antonio’s Market Square titled, “Sombra De Un Beso”. The mural was commissioned by MTC. Robert is currently restoring and revitalizing a large al fresco mural at Mi Tierra Café & Bakery.\n\nRosita Fernández\n\nMexican-American Singer and Actress\n\nRosita Fernández (Monterrey, 1919–San Antonio, Texas, 2006), was a Mexican-American popular singer and actress.
