        "text": "If you've never worked at Walmart you might not know that there is a uniform color code for Walmart stores across The Lone Star State and around the country.\n\nAnd since each store from Dallas, TX to Denver, CO, shares the same color-coded emergency announcement system, it's not a bad idea to brush up on what each code means.\n\nToday, let's learn what each color is and what they mean. Who knows, this information could save the life of a stranger, someone you love, or even your own.\n\nGoing to elementary school in California, I vividly remember practicing hiding under desks and standing in doorways during earthquake drills. That's not nearly as scary as practicing being bombed, like they did during The Cold War, or active shooter drills that kids do now.\n\nIf you're ever shopping at Walmart and hear a \"Code Brown\" over the intercom it means that there is a shooter on the premises. If this happens you should go toward an exit, if you can. Thanks to Common Cents Mom for this information.\n\nThere are 7 different codes that signify different types of emergencies:\n\nCode Red – This code means there is a fire of some type within the store. After the color is spoken, it’s usually followed by a number. This number refers to the aisle or part of the store where the fire has broken out.\n\nCode White – This code means an accident (such as an injury) or another type of incident has happened within the store.\n\nCode Orange – This code pertains to a chemical spill in some location inside or outside. After the color has been spoken, the location of the chemical spill is also given. Employees who are free at the time of the announcement must help take care of the spill.\n\nCode Black – This code comes about when there is dangerous and severe weather in the area.\n\nCode Brown – When you hear this code, it means that there is a shooter on the premises. This indicates it’s time to head to an exit, if you can. If you’re not near an exit, make sure to follow employee instructions and remain calm.\n\nCode Green – This code means that there is an active hostage situation taking place. If you can do it safely, call the police and request help. Remain as calm as possible and ensure you’re in a safe area of the store.\n\nCode Blue – This code means that there is a potential bomb threat happening in the store."
