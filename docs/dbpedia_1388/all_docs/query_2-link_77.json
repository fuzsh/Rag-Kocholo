        "text": "Early in the spring of 2020, Angélica Garcia felt like she was being called back home. The singer/songwriter had spent the last three years in Richmond, Virginia, but her roots were firmly planted in California.\n\nShe’d spent most of her life in El Monte — the city in the San Gabriel Valley just 20 20 minutes east of downtown L.A., where she was raised by her parents and grandparents. (Her mother, also named Angélica, was a singer who had grown up performing rancheras with her siblings at rodeos around L.A. and Mexico.) Angélica spent most of her childhood moving around the city, learning how to fit in each time she enrolled in a new school. At 17, she followed her parents across the country to Accomac, Virginia — a tiny rural town on the state’s eastern shore.\n\n\"It was challenging, but I tried to always see the positive side of those experiences,\" she tells GRAMMY.com. \"In some ways it was like traveling back in time to live there, but I also just thought, Wow, this is a whole different culture that I get to be a part of.\"\n\nAfter high school, she moved to Richmond and fell into the city’s indie scene, performing in several bands while recording and releasing her own solo music. Her semi-autobiographical track \"Jícama\" made it onto President Obama's 2019 year-end music list, giving her a boost of recognition just before she released her 2020 album, Cha Cha Palace. The album was a celebration of her Salvadoran-Mexican heritage, bursting at the seams with influences from across the Latin American diaspora, merging cumbia, ranchera, and reggaeton with psychedelic rock and pop.\n\nJust before the pandemic, Garcia felt as if she \"was being called to start over in L.A.\" With COVID-forced closures throughout the city, it wasn’t quite the return Garcia had hoped for. It did, however, present an opportunity for grounding and reconnection — not just with Garcia's hometown, but with roots, culture, and voice.\n\nShe turned inward, dredging up gnarled, complicated feelings about her identity. She’d started to find success writing music that she felt deeply connected to, but Garcia was also grappling with the realization that it was written in a language neither of her grandparents spoke. She turned to poetry, trying to work through her feelings of grief and disconnect.\n\nWhat inspired your move back to California?\n\nI loved living in Richmond, but I was having a really hard time towards the end. Moving kind of felt like something that I had to do. That was one of the difficult things that I was navigating around the time of writing Gemelo.\n\nThe album touches on the concept of grief and loss, but also discovery. What was going on in your life as you were writing it?\n\nThe record feels like traveling through grief. In real life, I was processing some really difficult changes and adapting as a person. I felt like there was a version of me who was going through the motions and phasing in and out of grief. My body was there, but my mind was somewhere else. I felt like I was almost in a dissociative state.\n\nHow does that sense of self you were grappling with tie into the album’s title, Gemelo?\n\nIt’s funny, it almost feels like the album revealed itself to me over time. I was maybe three or four songs in before I really started to see a through line between them. I wasn’t sure they were going to turn into an album, but they started to feel like part of a body of work.\n\nIn the beginning, I think I kept noticing these themes of reflection, the idea of past lives, all these emotions that kept coming up. Later, I was searching and searching for a record title, and I kept seeing the word \"twin.\" I hadn’t actually tried translating it into Spanish, but when I did, it was like a light bulb went off. I heard \"gemelo,\" and everything made sense.\n\nWhat about the concept of twins were you drawn to?\n\nI often felt like I had this intuition guiding me and helping me through some of these decisions, and helping to protect me. That, to me, is my gemelo. We have the version of ourselves that exists in the physical world, and then we have an intuitive self, a spirit self, that’s guiding us, even when our tangible self is too confused to really understand everything.\n\nMost of this album is in Spanish. What’s your relationship to the language? Did you grow up speaking it?\n\nIt’s always been a very core part of my childhood and my formative memories. Most of the people that I love speak Spanish. So even if I wasn’t always exercising it every day, anytime I spoke to the core people in my life — my grandparents, my mom, or my dad — I was always hearing Spanish. It’s also some of the first music that I learned how to sing, so it felt very natural to me to have it in my mouth and on my tongue.\n\nI just realized I’d never actually tried to express myself as a writer, creatively, in this language. I really wanted to honor that side of myself and my family lineage, and give it a shot.\n\nWould you say you express yourself differently in Spanish than in English?\n\nI feel like maybe it was almost easier to write in Spanish. I’ve been a musician for so long that it can be really easy to be like, \"Oh, this is how a song should go,\" or \"I should have a chorus that sounds like this.\" In some ways, because I didn't have the same framework or rules with Spanish, I was leaning a lot on imagery and on concepts in a way that was a very fun and refreshing challenge.\n\nI think it brought out a little bit more of my philosophical side, because I didn't feel the same pressures that sometimes I feel when working on music in English.\n\nDid exploring that side of yourself also help you connect on a different level with your family and your roots?\n\nI always felt a deep connection to my roots. It can be so easy to just get caught up in everyday life, so it's really fascinating when you look back, and you see the similarities between you. It really makes you wonder how much of it is nature and how much of it is nurture? And how many of these things I do were literally inherited, you know?\n\nHow did that seep into your writing for this album?\n\nIt’s funny, before I moved back to California, a really good friend of mine in Richmond got really into looking up their ancestry. We would just dedicate time to researching our family histories, and things like that. It was nice to do it with a friend, because you had somebody to talk to about it.\n\nAs I was learning, I was writing down the names of my relatives and putting them in a specific area in my room where I would meditate a lot. I would journal with the candles lit, and one day, I was sitting in front of that area and the song \"Juanita\" just poured out of me. The name came out so clearly.\n\nSome songs you labor over for months, or even years, and they might not come out. This one just poured out like it was raining from the sky. Later, I was sitting around a coffee table with my mom and my grandma, and she was like, \"Oh, yeah, your great great grandma, Mama Juana. Juanita …\" and I was just thinking, Wait, what? My grandma was telling me how Juana was this mystical woman, and I thought, Wow, she really wanted a song.\n\nIn addition to \"Juanita,\" your songs really tap into the stories of strong women, feminine joy, and feminine anger. How have the women in your family influenced your music?\n\nI love the perspective of the women in my family because there’s so much personality and resilience. They’re badass. My grandmother would tell me stories about being a little girl in El Salvador selling coffee, and her whole journey to work at the U.S. embassy, which is eventually how she got to the U.S. And my mother, being a child performing rodeos, told me stories about walking from one gig to another in Mexico with my grandpa because the van had broken down.\n\nSometimes I feel like people like to focus on their material accomplishments, like money or degrees. But the story of my mom walking from a gig as a child in her rodeo outfit, or the fact that my grandmother went from selling coffee in the jungle in El Salvador to L.A.? That's an accomplishment. That's resilience.\n\nThey’re full of these vibrant stories, because they had to navigate through so many trials. Because of them, I experienced a lot of love and magic, care, and nurturing. It’s unfortunate to me that those traits are sometimes seen as soft instead of strong, when it’s both. They redefined strength for me.\n\nGemelo’s final track, \"Paloma,\" feels like such a triumphant celebration. What significance does that song have for you?\n\nI wanted to end with gratitude. \"Paloma\" is a song about seeing the divine reflected in each other, in the people you love, and how, even when we're extremely critical of ourselves, we all hold the divine within us. We’re all walking this earth with the power to do incredible things. That outlook has really gotten me through so much in life. It can be so easy to get lost in the grief, but the light is what cuts through all of it for me.\n\nThe Marías Plunge Into The Depths On 'Submarine': How The Band Found Courage In Collective Pain\n\nWith two albums under his belt, Cornejo makes his major label debut with Mirada, released on July 18 via Zaragoza Records / Interscope. The album features the wistful, sad sierreño sound that made Cornejo famous three years ago with \"Está Dañada,\" a heart-wrenching ballad from his first LP, Alma Vacía (2021).\n\nIn the single, which has amassed over 270 million streams on Spotify, Ivan — then 17 — captivated listeners with powerful melodies accompanied by languid and nostalgic vocals, reciting verses filled with maturity beyond his years.\n\nIn Mirada, the Música Mexicana breakout star presents 12 solo songs inspired by summer nights, including singles \"Aquí te Espero,\" \"Donde Estás,\" \"Baby Please,\" and \"Intercambio Injusto.\" As with his previous productions, Cornejo makes heartbreak the central theme of his album while guitars and melodies reminiscent of alternative rock take center stage.\n\nWhile the album doesn’t feature additional artists, Cornejo opened up to collaboration within the studio. The singer, used to collaborating solely with his producer, Frank Rio, encountered a challenge when bringing two additional creatives into the studio.\n\n\"The process for this new project was very different,\" Cornejo tells GRAMMY.com in a Zoom interview from Mexico City. \"[Having other] creatives in the studio [resulted] a lot of learning. For example, my producer and I learned a lot from each other; we had constructive disagreements. We heard each other's opinions and learned a lot from this project.\"\n\nThe rising sad sierreño star discusses with GRAMMY.com the creative challenge of Mirada, the artistic boundaries he pushed along the way, the advantage behind bilingual songwriting, and the unexpected singer that influenced his lyrics.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n'Mirada' feels very personal, almost like a diary. How would you describe the album's overall theme and feeling?\n\nWhile writing and recording this album, I wanted it to feel very personal, intimate, and gentle but with a little more uplifting sound.\n\nI wanted the Mirada theme to feel like a nostalgic summer night. I want people to feel like they can play these songs on the beach, with friends, or alone in bed. I wanted it to feel a little euphoric.\n\nThe record showcases a blend of Latin and Anglo influences. Tracks like \"Baby Please,\" \"Dónde Estás,\" and \"Aquí te espero\" have a rock ballad feel. What inspired this fusion?\n\nMy influences come through a lot. I remember listening to my sister's and brother's music at eight while my parents would play classical regional Mexican music, like mariachi and corridos. As I grew up and started making music, it meshed into this sad sierreño and this funky Spanish alternative [genre].\n\nThe guitar is a staple in your sound. How did it become so central to your musical expression?\n\nI started playing the guitar when I was about seven. I fell completely in love with the instrument. My mom tried to put me in violin classes, and I learned the instrument for a while, but the guitar kept winning me over. I kept learning more and more about the guitar, and around 12, I started learning songs by Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys and Tame Impala, and that's where my music emerged.\n\nMirada portrays the nostalgia around summer nights. How were those nights for you?\n\nI spent it with my friends, making a bonfire and hanging out at the beach, pool, or jacuzzi.\n\nThose nights when you just put your phone away and let the wind hit you and talk about your feelings, your thoughts are different, that kind of night.\n\nWhat kind of music did you listen to on those summer nights?\n\nLast summer, I listened to [Bad Bunny’s] Un Verano Sin Ti; [that album] was No. 1 on my playlist.\n\nThe year before, I listened to just any vibey music, like Arctic Monkeys, Tame Impala, or Radiohead, when I was alone. Cigarettes After Sex, I listened to them a lot during the summer when I was going to sleep. I always put them on.\n\nYou say that each track on this album is pushing the boundaries of your art. In what aspect are you breaking those barriers?\n\nI go back to my last two albums [Alma Vacía and 2022’s Dañado,] and I want to grow as an artist and musician every time I listen to them.\n\nEvery time we enter the studio, [my producer] Frank Rio and I try our best to push the limits for ourselves and keep growing as artists. Vocally, musically, instrumentally, [we're] trying our best to make things sound even better.\n\nHow do you achieve that? Do you take vocal references from singers you like? Instrumentally, how do you break patterns within the genre?\n\nSometimes, when I feel something is missing from a song or I want to do something but don't know how to listen to a bunch of music that I think [is similar].\n\nFor example, each song on Mirada has a very different style. Depending on the style of the song, I’d listen to genres, styles, or certain ways that artists sing that match that song. Listening to those songs gives me ideas; it's like combining those ideas.\n\nVocally, for example, if I don't know how to sing a specific word or note, I listen to references and try to combine them in the best way possible.\n\nYour lyrics show maturity beyond your years. Do you consider yourself an old soul?\n\nYes, I'm an old soul, for sure. When I was 7 years old, my brother would play Johnny Cash songs, and I was right behind him listening to them, downloading all the songs. I remember that for a while, I would go to sleep listening to Johnny Cash for an entire year.\n\nRead more: Meet The Gen Z Women Claiming Space In The Regional Mexican Music Movement\n\nYour song often references therapy sessions, and your fans even consider you the therapist of an entire generation. Do you feel that way?\n\nI never realized my music had that effect. I would read comments saying, \"Oh, he healed me\" or, \"I feel better now,\" or \"he's my therapist, he's my comfort artist.\" That gave me a lot of joy because my music touched my fans in a very emotional way.\n\n[Those comments] gave me the great idea of naming my [last] tour \"Terapia.\" [Going to a concert] It's like you go to a therapist and you hear them. It all made sense. I hope my music is therapy for a lot of people.\n\nHave you ever been to therapy yourself?\n\nNo, I have not. But... I should go. [Laughs.]\n\nHow do you articulate emotions clearly in your songs, especially without formal therapy experience?\n\nI write about emotions that everyone goes through or has been through. And I try to write it in a way that sounds fresh and new. Also, melodies are very important because you can say something; depending on the melody, it can change your feelings. I try my best to make it hit the heart melodically and lyrically.\n\nWhat about Spanish led you to express heartbreak in this language?\n\nI was very inspired by Mexican music because there's something about the sound and the language that is very romantic. For example, there are some phrases in English that you might translate to Spanish, and they sound better in Spanish. Since my first language is English, I can translate them into Spanish and make them sound better and more emotional.\n\nI try to write [songs first] in Spanish, but from time to time, when I get stuck, I start thinking in English. I try to think of just lyrics, and I'm like, okay, that's a cool lyric; how do I make it fit into this? And then, if it doesn't work, I'll try another one and another one until something works, or I get an idea in English, and it just works in Spanish.\n\n[Being bilingual] gives you two perspectives, which helps a lot in the writing process.\n\nWhat does it mean to you to represent Mexican American culture through your music?\n\nIt feels like you're put on a pedestal and have to be a role model. Being part of two cultures is a blessing, because you have two sides and perspectives. I'm very lucky to be here in Mexico and to learn about Mexican culture while still being from the United States and learning from American culture.\n\nDid you feel you fit in when you were growing up?\n\nNo. At first, no. I was very shy.\n\nDid music give you that sense of belonging?\n\nYeah, for sure. It gave me relief as I fit somewhere, and my voice was being heard. [It makes me feel] like I have support and people are [rooting for] me, and it helps me feel a bit understood.\n\nAs you enter your twenties and deal with growing fame, do you feel pressure being labeled as the voice of a generation?\n\nI feel the pressure of being a role model, but it's a good kind of pressure. It helps me to make sure that I'm always giving my all. It's almost like motivation; I have to keep trying my best every time to be a role model.\n\nIt helps me to ensure that I'm always giving 100 percent and that it's like motivation, too. I have to keep trying my best each time to be a role model.\n\nYou sold out the mythical Houston Rodeo in April. How did singing to a crowd of 72,000 make you feel?\n\n[Selena] and Johnny Cash are many of my favorite artists and artists that I look up to [have performed there]. It was a complete honor to play the Houston Rodeo and one of the scariest things I've ever done. [Laughs.]\n\nIt was scary at first. But when I realized that there were a good number of fans, I took out my in-ears, and I heard nearly the whole stadium singing back to me. It was such a beautiful and unforgettable night for me. It was a crazy experience.\n\nLet’s not bury the lede here: Café Tacvba’s Re is one of the pantheon rock albums in the Spanish language. And arguably one of the greatest rock albums in any language.\n\nSince its release 30 years ago on July 22, it’s been held up as one of the most ambitious and eclectic albums of its time, elevating the standard by which almost every rock en español band would be held to ever since — including its own creators. As a song cycle, Re is a whirlwind, with genre exercises and mini-suites scattered seemingly at random. Many pop critics liken its sonic diversity to the Beatles’ White Album, which is true if you’re just counting musical styles. But whereas the Fab Four were indulging their personalities within the group context, Café Tacvba conveyed solidarity in putting together an almost sui generis collection of madcap melodies.\n\nAs a whole, Re was a great leap forward for Latin American rock music, and a landmark for Mexican music in general.\n\nIt's important to consider the context of Café Tacvba in 1994. Despite its large population and long history as a Latin American cultural center, Mexico City lagged in establishing serious rock acts aside from outliers such as El Tri. Part of this is due to the politics of the age — including the Mexican government’s notorious crackdown on public rock concerts after several clashes between rock fans and police during the '70s — leaving the majority of Mexican rock bands resigned to playing in shady, underground clubs.\n\nHowever, the 1980s saw the birth of BMG’s \"Rock de tu Idioma\" marketing blitz, and Mexican record companies finally began to put efforts into finding a national equivalent to South American-born stadium bands like Soda Stereo and Los Enanitos Verdes. On their second album, El Circo, Madilta Vecindad brought Mexico City to the forefront of the modern rock en español movement with their innovative mix of rock n’roll and ska crossed with pachuco subculture. Other bands that emerged around this time — from the gothic Caifanes (whom the band is currently touring with across the United States) to the arena rockers Maná — began building large audiences across the continent, but the scene still lacked a singular act that could elevate Mexican rock to the forefront.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'El Nervio Del Volcán' At 30: How Caifanes' Final Album Became A Classic In Latin American Rock\n\nEnter los Tacvbos. Aligning based on their shared passion for English new wave music, Café Tacvba was formed in the late '80s by college friends Rubén Albarrán and Joselo Rangel, who would serve as vocalist and guitarist, respectively. In time, they were joined by Joselo’s brother (and bassist) Quique and the multi-instrumentalist Emmanuel \"Meme\" de Real, choosing to name their band after a historic Mexico City café. Café Tacvba spent the late '80s evolving from a college garage band into one of Mexico’s most exciting live acts. After the release of their seminal 1992 self-titled debut — a frantic collection of ska-punk mayhem and colorful pop songs — expectations were high that the band could deliver a follow-up that would mirror their electric live show. What the band delivered would end up altering the entire scene completely.\n\nRe did not sell well in Mexico upon release, though the band fermented interest during a sold out tour of Chile and Argentina. This, along with exposure from the recent launch of MTV in Mexico, was the major catalyst for the album’s fortunes taking an upturn. As the Mexican music listening public soon gathered, Re had something for everyone: From the smooth bolero of \"Esa Noche,\" the frenetic banda of \"El Fin de la Infancia,\" and the glittery Mexican pop of \"Las Flores.\" Lyrically the band was speaking to its compadres, most notably on \"El Metro,\" a bizarre short story of a lovelorn man trapped inside the Mexico City subway.\n\nDespite its madcap sound and unabashed orgullo Mexicano, Re’s deepest theme is about the cyclical nature of life. There’s an obvious hint to it within the album art’s spiral conch shell, and more allusions in the song title \"El Ciclón\" and the reflexivity of \"Pez\" and \"Verde,\" which bleed in-and-out of each other.\n\nBut dig deeper and the album is rife with references to life, death, rebirth, and natural law. \"Ixtepec\" sounds like a buoyant pop number but is really a cryptic tale about Death coming to collect his bounty, underlined with the refrain that \"life is a cycle.\" Multiple songs, including \"Trópico de Cáncer\" and closer \"El Balcón,\" reference reclamation of their birth land from the conquistadors, with the former song in particular telling a heartbreaking story of a civil engineer encountering the ecological damage to which he’s complicit. And there’s also the understated elegance of \"El Tlatoani del Barrio,\" which recounts a love story in a pre-Columbian world soundtracked by Indigenous chants and a disco boogie.\n\nUnlike many bands in a similar position, Café Tacvba never tried to replicate the magic of Re. Their next release was the covers album Alalancha de Éxitos, itself born out of their label’s reaction about Re’s lack of commercial hits (this bet paid off; the album was nominated for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance at the 40th GRAMMY Awards). Their visionary, hyper-experimental 1999 release Revés/Yo Soy, solidified their critical standing by winning a Latin GRAMMY for Best Rock Album and earning a GRAMMY nod. Today, it's a cult item currently unavailable on any streaming service due to label in-fighting.\n\nAfter the turn of the century came Cuatro Caminos, a much more traditional sounding rock album, which led them to new critical and commercial heights, including their only GRAMMY win for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album, and their career ever since has seen them find their groove as the thinking person’s favorite Mexican rock band. But within their exceptional catalog, Re remains a glorious outlier.\n\nEven if Café Tacvba had never released another record after Re, their legacy would have remained secure. Re was among the major catalysts for the second wave of Mexican alterna-rock, which saw the likes of Julieta Venegas and Kinky elevating the genre with new sounds and perspectives. All modern rock owes a debt to the freewheeling spirit of Re, and the album’s continued influence and criticalaccolades are proof-positive of that.\n\nIn a sense, it’s almost poetic that Café Tacvba — a band formed through their shared idolization of David Bowie, the Clash, and the Cure — ended up proving to be as essential and venerable to rock history as any of their influences.\n\nWith the success of \"El Belicón\" and \"Ella Baila Sola\" under his belt, Peso Pluma released GÉNESIS in June 2023. Despite being his third album, Peso considers it his true debut in music.\n\n\"I didn't want to delete my previous albums [Efectos Secundario and Ah Y Que?] because they represent my beginnings,\" Peso toldBillboard in a cover story published a few weeks after the release of GÉNESIS. In the same conversation, the singer said he saw himself winning his first GRAMMY and breaking more records.\n\nRead more: 5 Takeaways From Peso Pluma's New Album 'GÉNESIS'\n\nIn February 2024, Peso Pluma did just that. He took home the golden gramophone for Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano) — his first GRAMMY Award. This victory didn't weigh on him as he approached his next production. \"It pushed me to want to create something different that the fans haven't heard from me before,\" Peso Pluma tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nWhile GÉNESIS and ÉXODO may differ in substance, they share similarities beyond music. That both records pull from the Bible for their names is not a random occurrence; the opening book of the Hebrew and Christian Bible delves into the genesis of creation, while the Book of Exodus explores the themes of liberation, redemption, and Moses' role in leading the Israelites through the uncharted waters of the Red Sea.\n\n\"ÉXODO is the continuation of GÉNESIS, which was the beginning,\" Peso Pluma explains to GRAMMY.com. \"ÉXODO means new beginnings, a new era for me. We are preparing for the next chapter, and that's what we are doing for Mexican music, paving the way, laying the groundwork for what's next because it doesn't stop here.\"\n\nHis \"sophomore\" album is divided into two discs: the first is corridos, and the second is urban. It also continues the line of collaborations, with twenty tracks where Peso Pluma shares the limelight.\n\n\"Some of my fans were craving música Mexicana, and some were craving urbano, and I wanted to give them everything while still staying true to myself and choosing songs and lyrics that spoke to me,\" he continues.\n\nÉXODO's disc one starts with \"LA DURANGO,\" the album's fourth single, featuring Eslabon Armando and Junior H. In the record, he also invites collaborators such as Natanael Cano and Gabito Ballesteros for \"VINO TINTO\" and Mexican rising star Ivan Cornejo on the melancholic \"RELOJ,\" among others.\n\nFor Side B, Peso enlisted heavyweights from the urban genre in the Anglo and Latin markets: Anitta in the steamy \"BELLAKEO,\" Rich The Kid in the bilingual \"GIMME A SECOND,\" and Quavo in the existential trap \"PA NO PENSAR.\" Cardi B, Arcángel, Ryan Castro, Kenia OS, and DJ Snake complete ÉXODO's genre crossover.\n\nÉXODO, luxury, drugs, alcohol, and women continue to take center stage in the lyrics, accompanied by fast-paced guitar-driven melodies and reverb-dense vocals. However, the production sheds light on the vulnerable side of Peso and explores the unexpected consequences of becoming globally famous.\n\n\"Fans really get to see the other side of the coin; there are two sides to me. It's darker, rawer,\" Peso says about the record.\n\nIn the songs \"HOLLYWOOD\" and \"LA PATRULLA,\" for example, Peso details how this musical path keeps him up at night, as well as his aspirations, and how he remains the same despite his success.\n\nPerhaps one of the deepest and rawest songs on the album is \"14:14,\" a track inspired by the Bible verse 14:14 from the Book of Exodus, which, the singer explains, was fundamental amidst the turbulence he faced on the way to global stardom.\n\n\"[The] verse 14:14 says 'The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.' This verse couldn't be truer,\" Peso Pluma says. \"Over time, I learned to really trust in this and believe that some things are not up to me and I should trust the process.\"\n\nIn the song — one of the few on the album without a collaboration — Peso references the challenges of his profession and how his faith has kept him afloat amid the vicissitudes. \"Things from the job that no one understands/I hide the rosary under my shirt so I don't poison myself, so I don't feel guilty/because whatever happens, the Boss will forgive me,\" he sings.\n\nIn \"BRUCE WAYNE,\" Peso Pluma croons about the passionate feelings his career arouses: \"First they love you, and then they hate you/wishing the worst, envy and death,\" the song says.\n\nThe singer resorts to comparing himself to a superhero figure again. In an unusual twist, Peso crosses comic universes, moving from his now traditional reference to Spider-Man to one from the DC Comics world: Bruce Wayne, Batman's secret identity. A wealthy man, part of Gotham's high society, Bruce Wayne is known for transforming his darkness into power while remaining reserved and isolated.\n\n\"Everyone has two sides of them, even me,\" Peso tells GRAMMY.com. \"Peso Pluma on stage is a high-energy person, someone who is powerful and dominates a show and isn't afraid of anything. And then there is Hassan, who's chill and more relaxed and who deals with all the realities of life.\"\n\nDuring the year and a half it took him to complete ÉXODO, Peso Pluma had to deal with the diverse nuances of a global star's life, including a widely publicized breakup from Argentine rapper/singer Nicki Nicole, the cancellation of one of his shows in October 2023 after a Mexico drug cartel issued a death threat against him, and a media frenzy over his alleged admission to a rehabilitation clinic, the latest a rumor he laid to rest during a March interview withRolling Stone for his Future of Music cover story.\n\n\"The reality is, all these days, I've been in the studio working on ÉXODO,\" the artist explained to Rolling Stone.\n\nMost of 2023 was a successful balancing act for Peso Pluma, who combined touring, an album release, rare media engagements, two Coachella appearances, all the while developing another record. According to the singer, ÉXODO was created in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Mexico. \"We go to the studio everywhere!\" Peso says. \"It doesn't really matter where we are; I love to get into the studio and work when we have free time.\"\n\nLike GÉNESIS, ÉXODO will be released via Peso Pluma's Double P Records, of which he is the CEO and A&R. Much of the talent the Mexican singer has signed to his label took part in the album's production, and songwriting process.\n\n\"For the Mexican music side, I had the whole [touring] band with me; I like to have them involved in the process so that we can all give our input on how it sounds, discuss what we think needs to be changed, create new ideas,\" he explains.\n\nPeso Pluma knows that echoing the success of 2023 is no easy task. He was the most streamed artist in the U.S. on YouTube, surpassing Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny, and was the second most-listened to Latin artist in the country, amassing an impressive 1.9 billion streams, according to Luminate.\n\nMúsica Mexicana emerged as one of the most successful genres in 2023, witnessing a remarkable 60 percent surge in streaming numbers, adds Luminate's annual report, crediting Peso Pluma along Eslabon Armado, Junior H, and Fuerza Regida as part of this success.\n\nCollaborations on and off the mic have undoubtedly played a significant role in the rise of Música Mexicana on the global stage. Peso knows that the key to continuing onward is teaming up with renowned artists inside and outside his genre.\n\n\"All of us coming together is what pushed música Mexicana to go global,\" the singer affirms. \"We showed the world what Mexico has to offer, and now no one can deny the power and talent we have in our country.\"\n\nShakira's Road To 'Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran': How Overcoming A Breakup Opened A New Chapter In Her Artistry"
