        "text": "Raul Roa Garcia, Cuba's Foreign Minister for 17 years, died Tuesday in Havana after a long illness. He was 75 years old. Dr. Roa helped negotiate two important agreements between the United States and Cuba: the decision in 1965 to permit an airlift of Cuban emigrants to this country, and the 1973 accord calling for extradition or extreme punishment of aircraft hijackers.\n\nDr. Roa, who was also a University of Havana professor, was appointed Foreign Minister by Fidel Castro after the revolution in 1959. He served in that post until 1976, after which he served as vice president of the National Assembly and member of the Council of State until illness forced his retirement last year.\n\nHis only child, Raul Roa-Kouri, is Cuba's chief representative at the United Nations. Led Cuban Rebel Movement\n\nDr. Roa was born in Havana on April 18, 1907. He entered the University of Havana in 1925, was elected a member of the leftist students directorate in 1930 and was imprisoned in 1931 for his anti-Government activities.\n\nHe participated in the revolt led by Fulgencio Batista against the Government of Gerardo Machado in 1933 but was removed by General Batista from the succeeding administration.\n\nDr. Roa joined a general strike against the Batista Government in 1935. When that failed, he fled to the United States and organized a Cuban revolutionary association in New York.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
