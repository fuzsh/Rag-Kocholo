        "text": "* The early theory of unequal exchange was of course part of a larger problem of economists' and demographers' recognition of underdevelopment and the “population explosion” in the years after the War; such recognition was inevitably influenced by the Cold War, decolonization, new nationalisms, neutralism, and the rise of a host of U.N. and other international agencies. The Third World-including the perception of its inhabitants' common interests against the West-was in most respects reified in the years between the end of the War and the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandungin 1955. In particular, the demographer and economic historian Alfred Sauvycoined the term “Tiers Monde” in 1952 on the model of the Abbe Sieyes revolutionary Tiers Etat of 1789, and the journal Tiers Monde and a collection of essays with the same title appeared in 1956. (L'observateur, 14 Aug. 1952, p. 5; Sauvy to author, Paris, 15 Dec. 1978.) But Latin America, where centerperiphery theory was born, was not generally considered part of the Third World until after the Cuban Revolution (1959).\n\n19. When the War began in September 1939, a secret pact between the Bank of England and Argentina's Central Bank established that the South American nation would accept sterling for its sales to Britain, and that this money would be used exclusively for paying for British exports to Argentina or to buy back Argentine bonds and purchase British-owned railways. That is, the sterling was held in a blocked account that could not be converted into other currencies, and would constitute payments in a captive export market for British goods after the War. No interest was to be paid on this account, and Britain did not have to use its precious dollars, which Argentina sorely needed. According to Fodor and O'Connell, “During this period [and for a time after the 1943 coup] … Argentina did not use its sterling to liquidate its foreign debt nor to buy up [British-owned] railroads, with the result that while Argentina's debts to Britain paid interest, British debts to Argentina did not.” (Argentina was apparently willing to accept the lopsided pact of 1939 because of the collapse of cereal prices again at the outset of the War, and the probable loss of her remaining continental markets as the conflict developed.) Even in the postcoup years (i.e., after Prebisch left the Central Bank), the pro-Axis government continued to bow to the economic demands of Britain, for fear of losing its only large market. Fodor and O'Connell, “La Argentina,” pp. 56 (quotation), 57, 59.\n\n76. Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (1855–1920), a Rumanian Marxist, distinguished between “global” society and “local” societies. He used the former term to describe the dynamic capitalist nations, in a way roughly equivalent to Prebisch's center; local societies, a group of “feudal,” dependent countries, were similar to the periphery. Gherea's idée maitresse, according to Henri Stahl, was that Rumanian society's development could not be understood except as a “fragment of an expanding world capitalist system.” Aside from Gherea's work, Marxist texts on imperialism before World War I reveal little interest in underdevelopment as imperialism seen “from below.” In the view of Fred Gottheil, for Lenin, Kautsky, Luxemburg, and Hilferding, “The colonized regions were regarded simply as depositories for capitalism's surplus commodities, labor, and capital. Whatever became of these surpluses in the regions … was clearly peripheral to their interest.” Yet Lenin's position began to change after the Soviets seized power, and this fact was reflected in the pronouncements of the Communist International, as early as its second congress in 1920. At its sixth congress in 1928 the Comintern declared capitalism in colonial areas to be a reactionary force, because capitalists allied with comprador bourgeoisies and other traditional groups. As Paul Singer notes, this analysis brought into focus for the first time the relations of social classes in underdeveloped countries.\n\nPrebisch in the early years of ECLA had nothing to say about class relationships in the periphery; but his emphasis on relative prices between agricultural and industrial goods had a precedent among Soviet theorists (though once again there is no indication of any influence on Prebisch's thinking). I refer to the Soviet industrialization debate between 1924 and 1928, resulting in Stalin's decision in the latter year to develop heavy industry and to collectivize agriculture as part of the First Five-Year Plan. Evgeni Preobrazhenski, an advocate of rapid industrialization during the period of the “semi-capitalist” New Economic Policy (1921–28), contended that the agricultural sector should subsidize industrial development in the U.S.S.R., through a pricing policy for industrial goods “on the basis of monopoly,” as Preobrazhenski put it. This was part of what Preobrazhenski called “socialist primitive accumulation,” the allegedly more humane counterpart of the capitalist primitive accumulation described with such passion in chapters 26 and 27 of Marx's Capital. At the end of the 1920s, collectivization terminated the peasants' freedom to choose when and at what terms to sell their surpluses. In Prebisch's scheme, unequal exchange between agricultural and industrial producers largely occurs through the action of the business cycle, but, as we have seen, monopolistic pricing played some role.\n\nOn these matters, see Henri H. Stahl, “Théories de C. D. Gherea sur les lois de la pénétration du capitalisme dans les pays retardataires,” Review [of the Fernand Braudel Institute] 2, 1 (Summer 1978), pp. 106, 108–09; Fred M. Gottheil, “On an Economic Theory of Colonialism,” Journal of Economic Issues 9, 1 (Mar. 1977), p. 93; Paul Singer, “Divisão internacional do trabalho e empresas multinacionais,” in CEBRAP Caderno 28: Multinacionais: internacionalização e crise (São Paulo: Brasiliense, 1977), pp. 55–56 (Albert Hirschman brought this article to my attention); and Alexander Erlich, The Soviet Industrialization Debate, 1924–1928 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960), pp. 49, 50, 55, 121.\n\n82. The data base (for Britain), which showed long-term deterioration of the periphery's terms of trade, was criticized: it allowed for no change in the quality of goods, a process that presumably affected industrial more than agricultural commodities, because of a higher rate of technological progress in the center. Furthermore, P. T. Ellsworth pointed out that the British series included exports F.O.B. but imports C.I.F., and argued that a fall in the prices of primary goods from 1876 to 1905 was largely due to a fall in transportation costs (owing to a combination of advances in steamship and rail networks). But the same writer showed that the evidence for the 1930s supported Prebisch—British export prices did not fall because of resistance to cuts in wages and profits.\n\nUsing data for the period 1950–60, Werner Baer showed that there was substantial evidence that the deterioration of the terms of trade in many parts of the underdeveloped world owed to low income elasticity of demand for its complement's goods at the center, and high elasticity at the periphery. While acknowledging that monopolistic pricing at the center was difficult to prove, Baer found that for 1950–60 the periphery's export prices tended to decrease or to fluctuate widely. Wages (in constant terms) for the years 1950–59 rose in selected center countries, while those in peripheral countries fell.\n\nMore recently Paul Bairoch has attacked Prebisch's terms-of-trade argument as a long-term phenomenon. Bairoch contends that, contrary to Prebisch, primary goods benefited in the secular trends of the terms of trade from 1870 to the early 1950s. To begin with, Bairoch challenges the choice of the terminal year (1938) of the original U.N. study (Relative Prices) as an abnormal one. He also cites trade figures for the United States and France (data not available in 1949), which diverge from the trends of the British experience (Robert Lipsey had already shown this for the U.S.). Furthermore, Bairoch demonstrates that the internal terms of trade for several developed countries moved in favor of agricultural goods in the years 1876–80 to 1926–29. Finally, he cites long-term studies of terms of trade for several primary-exporting countries which contradict the U.N.'s findings. Yet Bairoch does think the terms of trade moved against the Third World countries from 1954–55 to 1962–63. Among the several causes of this trend was a factor Prebisch had cited—“a difference between the less-developed and the developed countries in the manner in which the gains from increased productivity accrued.” Despite Bairoch's forceful arguments on the long-term trends, the dispute about the effects of terms of trade between developed and underdeveloped countries remained very much alive in the year he published (1975).\n\nSee Ellsworth, “The Terms of Trade between Primary Producing and Industrial Countries,” Inter-American Economic Affairs 10, 1 (Summer 1956), pp. 55–57, 63: Baer, “The Economics of Prebisch and ECLA,” in Charles T. Nisbet, ed., Latin America: Problems in Economic Development (New York: Free Press, 1969), pp. 215–17; Bairoch, The Economic Development of the Third World since 1900 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), pp. 111–34, especially 120, 125, 132, 134 (quotation); Robert E.
