        "text": "0.2 History\n\nOn April 27, 1962, CONICET created the National Institute of Radio Astronomy (INRA). Soon after, an agreement was signed with the UBA, the University of La Plata (UNLP), and the CIC, stating that all these institutions would work together to support the new institute. Finally, the name was changed to Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomía (Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy) to avoid confusion with another institute dedicated to agricultural technologies, but with the same acronym.\n\nThe history of the IAR has been presented in detail by Bajaja (2009). What is offered in this section is a brief account along with some personal views.\n\nDr. Carlos M. Varsavsky (1933-1983, Figure 2), from UBA, was chosen as director of the Institute and Dr. Carlos Jaschek of the La Plata Observatory was appointed as deputy director. Eng. Juan del Giorgio was appointed technical advisor. Varsavksy received his Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard in 1959. He was known as the translator into English of the classic book Cosmic Radio Waves by I.S. Shklovsky. In 1960 he returned to Argentina and became Professor of Physics at the University of Buenos Aires, where he lectured on radio astronomy and joined the CAR group. The original staff of the IAR consisted of the aforementioned authorities, the engineers Rubén Dugatkin, Emilio Filloy (both recently returned from the USA), Omar González Ferro, and the students Valentín Boriakoff (electronics), Fernando Raúl Colomb, and Esteban Bajaja (both students of physics).\n\nThe first task of the group was to find a suitable site for the installation of the radio telescope. The site should be accessible from both La Plata and Buenos Aires, but relatively isolated to minimize radio interference from human sources. The selected location was within the Pereyra Iraola Park, a protected reserve located near Villa Elisa, 40 km from the city of Buenos Aires. Ten hectares were ceded by the Province of Buenos Aires through an agreement signed on October 30, 1962. Almost immediately, work began on the site. A 1944 International truck and a 50 kVA ex-military diesel generator were used to build the first workshop and other facilities (see Figure 3). Amazingly, both are still in use in 2023.\n\nTo supervise the work of assembling the radio telescope, at the beginning of November 1963, Eng. Everett Ecklund was sent from the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW). The construction started on November 14th. The construction process is described in detail by Bajaja (2009) and will not be repeated here. Figure 4 shows the construction of the dish, still resting on the ground.\n\nOnce the dish was completed, a first receiver with 10 channels was installed and on April 1, 1965, the first detection of HI was achieved. The dish (central ring + platform + ribs + surface) was supported on pillars on the ground, facing the zenith. This historic landmark occurred only 12 years after the original detection of the HI line at Harvard. It was a milestone in the history of the IAR and radio astronomy in the southern hemisphere. At the end of that same year, the dish was mounted on the pedestal (Figure 5).\n\nAs the construction of the radio telescope progressed, other buildings were added to the complex: a main building for offices, library, and control of the instrument (see Figure 6); and a building with laboratories and workshops for electronics. Finally, the inauguration of the radio telescope took place on March 26, 1966, in the presence of personalities from national and foreign institutions, including H. Van de Hulst, the first proponent of the HI 21-cm line as a diagnostic tool of the interstellar medium (Figure 7). During the inauguration ceremony, speeches were given by Dr. Tuve, in his capacity as Director of the DTM and representative of the CIW, and by Dr. Varsavsky, as Director of the IAR. Soon after, the scientific observations began: IAR as a radio astronomy observatory was born.\n\nIt did not take long for politics to interfere with the normal development of activities. On June 28, 1966, the Argentine Armed Forces carried out a coup against the constitutional government of Arturo Umberto Illia and established the self-proclaimed “Argentine Revolution”. On July 29, 1966, five academic departments of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), occupied by students, professors, and graduates, were brutally repressed and evacuated in opposition to the decision of the de facto government to intervene in the universities and overthrow the government regime. The episode in which professors were beaten and expelled was known as “The Night of the Long Batons.” Subsequently, the military government of General Juan Carlos Onganía decided to unilaterally revoke the academic freedom established in the 1918 university reform. Most professors resigned and many left the country.\n\nVarsavsky, who was wounded in the episode (Fig. 8), resigned from the university and moved his office to the IAR. Many students came with him. Some of them later became famous scientists: Diego and Catherine Cesarsky, Jorge Vernazza, Peter Mészáros, Federico Strauss, Zulema Abraham, Silvia Garzoli, Esteban Bajaja, Raul Colomb, and Wolfgang Poeppel, among others (see Fig. 9).\n\nDespite the political turmoil, research with the new radio telescope continued. Then, in 1969, during the month of May, some serious incidents occurred in the cities of Rosario and Corrientes, with the death of two students. In the large city of Córdoba, some unions and groups of students called for a strike to be held on May 30. Then, on May 28, a note signed by the staff of the IAR, criticizing the regime of the de facto president Onganía, was addressed to CONICET, whose authorities were invited to join the strike of May 30. The note was also sent to the newspapers. On May 29, 1969, very serious disturbances occurred in Córdoba, riots that were later called “El Cordobazo” and that marked the beginning of the end of the Onganía government. First the police and then the army intervened to suppress the uprising. Four people were killed, more than 100 were wounded, and many were imprisoned. Meanwhile, the note sent by IAR personnel led to serious disciplinary action by CONICET: Varsavsky was fired as director, and the closure of the IAR was considered. Finally, bureaucratic sanctions were imposed on the staff. Disillusioned by the lack of support from the CIW, Varsavsky resigned from CONICET and gave up scientific research. In 1977, after his nephew Varsavsky was kidnapped and murdered by state terrorism, he left the country. He immigrated with his family to the United States, where he became deputy director of the Institute for Economic Analysis at New York University. He would die in 1983 at the age of 49.\n\nEmilio Filloy replaced Varsavsky as interim director until Dr. Kent Turner of DTM was appointed as the new director. During his tenure, there were two important milestones in the history of the IAR: a second, twin radio telescope was built (Fig. 10) and a new building housing the telescope control room was inaugurated (Fig. 11). Turner was also involved in the supervision of students, including Félix Mirabel, who later became one of the most renowned Argentine astronomers. In 1973, elections were held and Héctor Cámpora was elected as the new president. The climate was not favorable for US citizens at that time, so Turner resigned and returned to the US. The new interim director was Raúl Colomb. In 1975, after returning to the country from a long stay in the Netherlands, Esteban Bajaja was appointed director by CONICET.\n\nDuring Bajaja’s tenure as director, a new receiver for the first telescope was built through a renewal agreement with the DTM. This receiver was a significant improvement over the previous one. It was designed for operation at 21 and 18 cm, with noise temperatures of 83K and 90K, respectively. A PDP-11/20 computer was used for data acquisition. A new front end was also installed at Antenna 1 on July 21, 1979. It was equipped with a corrugated feeder, carefully designed to attenuate spurious radiation from directions outside the surface of the antenna (the so-called “spillover” effect). The filters for the spectral observations consisted of a set of 24 crystal filters, 2.2 kHz wide, 3 kHz apart, for observing very narrow lines of HI or for observing lines of OH. Another set of 112 channels of 10 kHz width and 10 kHz spacing was used for general observations of Galactic HI. Finally, a set of 84 channels of 75.8 kHz (16 kms−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT), separated by 75.8 kHz, was devoted to the observation of galaxies. All of these filters occupied a large part of the control room.\n\nWith the new equipment, the observatory began a number of important scientific programs, including surveys of HI in galaxies, high-speed clouds, HI in the Magellanic Clouds, a survey of galactic HI at low and intermediate velocities, studies of supernova remnants and HII regions, and observations of recombination lines and OH molecules. The first telescope operated at nearly 100 % of its capacity.\n\nAfter a very successful administration, Bajaja asked for a leave of absence to take a sabbatical year devoted to research. He was replaced as director by Raúl Colomb during the period 1982-1984. Colomb focused on the newest radio telescope, in which a continuum receiver was installed. The idea was to perform a survey of the entire sky in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn. In the northern hemisphere, the observations were made with a 25-meter radio telescope located on Stockert hill in Bad Münstereifel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. A receiver with polarimetric capabilities was developed at the IAR for the project.\n\nBajaja resumed the directorship in 1984, but soon resigned in discontent because CONICET introduced major changes in the management of scientific budgets. Colomb returned as director for the next 10 years. During these years, most of the efforts were devoted to the surveys. In 1989, an agreement was signed with the Planetary Society to install an 8.4 million channel spectrum analyzer to search for radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligent beings. This instrument, called META II (Mega Channel Extraterrestrial Assay), was built at Harvard by two IAR engineers: Juan Carlos Olalde and Eduardo Hurrell. The instrument became operational on October 12, 1990, and was active for more than two years, accumulating about 9,000 hours of observations. During these observations, 1,600,000 independent spectra of 8.4 million channels each were obtained, more than 1013superscript101310^{13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bytes of data. Of the spectra obtained, only those containing peculiar signals were recorded. Finally, 10 suspected cases were selected, but none were confirmed.\n\nIn 1989, the author of this article and Jorge Combi started working at the IAR as telescope operators. In total, they spent more than 300 nights observing with the telescopes during the next two years. This gives an idea of the intensive use of the radio telescopes at that time. In 1992, they both received grants from CONICET to do their Ph.D. research at the IAR, and began to use the instrumental knowledge they had acquired during their years as operators to develop their own research projects on blazars and high-energy particles in the galaxy. Without knowing it, they started relativistic astrophysics in Argentina.\n\nIn 1995, Colomb asked for a leave of absence to take a leadership position in the newly created National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE), and was again replaced by Bajaja. Bajaja remained director until September 1997, when he asked for a new sabbatical year and submitted his resignation as director. Ricardo Morras replaced him as interim director. In November 1997, CONICET appointed Marcelo Arnal as the new director, on the recommendation of Bajaja. After only 2 years, Arnal’s directorship was terminated by CONICET (see Bajaja 2009), and Ricardo Morras was reappointed as interim director. However, he would remain in charge of the institute for 7 years. This was the time it took for CONICET to call for an opposition to cover the position of director.\n\nMorras had to face serious difficulties due to the economic crisis in the country during the years 2001 and 2002 and the consequences of the inherited problems with CONICET. The budget was cut and even the possibility of closing the institute was considered by the authorities; the telescopes had been out of operation during the previous administration and would remain out of service for almost two decades. However, Morras seized the opportunity to begin a fruitful collaboration with CONAE to develop technology for the space program, taking advantage of the strength of the technical staff. As work intensified with new projects related to different satellites, new facilities were built at the Institute. These included a new building for laboratories and a full anechoic chamber (one of only two such facilities in the country, Figure 12), and a far-field test facility (Figure 13). With these new capabilities, the IAR also began to offer technological services. Slowly, under the administration of Morras and the technological supervision of Engs. Juan Sanz and Juan J. Larrarte, the Institute became a recognized technological research and development center within the Argentine system. The number of technical personnel increased dramatically during these years.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view, most of the research has been done in the field of relativistic astrophysics. In 2000, Romero and Combi, together with Paula Benaglia and Diego Torres, founded the Group of Relativistic Astrophysics and Radio Astronomy (GARRA). This group, led by Romero, was the first to exploit the recent results of gamma-ray instruments, adopting a multi-wavelength approach and interweaving theory and observations. Such an approach, applied systematically for the first time in South America, was extremely successful. Soon the group grew to include up to 20 researchers and students, publishing hundreds of papers and gaining a strong international reputation. Eventually, Romero became professor of relativistic astrophysics at the University of La Plata, Combi created the chair of X-ray astronomy at the same university, Benaglia, who became a leading expert in radio interferometry, founded the group FRINGE, and Torres emigrated first to the USA and then to Spain, where he became director of the Institute of Space Science of Catalonia.\n\nAt the end of 2007, CONICET finally opened the opposition for the directorship and E.M. Arnal returned as director. In a first term he continued the policies of Morras, but after a while he devoted most of his efforts to a new project: a submillimeter radio telescope to be installed in the province of Salta, in the northwestern part of the country, at an altitude of 5000 meters. This project, whose original idea had been conceived long before by Félix Mirabel, was finally approved by the new Ministry of Science (MinCyT) and a substantial budget of several million dollars was allocated. The radio telescope would be purchased by Brazil from the German company Vertex. It was the same design used by ALMA Array in its telescopes. The site and infrastructure would be the responsibility of Argentina, as would the integration of the instrument. The final instrument would be operated as an Argentine-Brazilian facility (see Romero 2020 for a description of the project, called LLAMA). The scale of such a project was underestimated and management problems soon emerged. The consequences for IAR were serious. The director devoted most resources to LLAMA and other projects were affected. Technological activities decreased dramatically and most of the contracted staff moved to other institutions. At the same time, work on the site made little progress. When the telescope finally arrived in Argentina in 2017, Arnal resigned from the project. At the end of the year, he retired as director of the IAR and left the institute. Since he had not appointed a deputy director, the institute was left headless. The situation was very delicate, as the instrument had been left at the international customs, where high fees had to be paid for its storage. While a new advertisement for the position of Director was organized, two successive interim Directors were appointed by CONICET: Eng. Leandro García and Dr. Leonardo Pellizza. García managed to get the telescope out of customs, but the budget for the project was cut by MinCyT.\n\nIn August 2018, Gustavo E. Romero took over as the new director of the IAR. The situation was difficult: the LLAMA project was stopped by MinCyT, there was no other institutional project, the deterioration of the Institute’s facilities was unprecedented, the IAR’s bank accounts were frozen by court order, the Institute was completely isolated within the Argentine science and technology system (there was no communication even with the nearby AGGO Observatory), the radio telescopes had been out of service for about 20 years, technological development and the associated technology transfer had stopped, the technical staff was decimated: about 40 professionals left the IAR in the previous 10 years (see Fig. 14).\n\nMinCyT soon decided to transfer the management of LLAMA to ITEDA, an institute dedicated to astroparticle detection and related technologies. After a year and a half, when the government changed in 2019, the responsibility for integrating the instrument was transferred again, this time to INVAP, a government technology company. IAR remained as a consultant and contractor for some specific tasks. Romero was then able to devote his full attention to the reorganization of the Institute. After resolving the legal problems left by LLAMA’s management, he implemented a new structure to allow for better coordination and cooperation in achieving institutional goals. Two large areas were created: scientific and technological, each with a person in charge. The technological area has two large sectors, the Observatory and the Technology Development and Transfer Sector, again each with a head appointed by the director. Under these structures, several departments have been created, each with its own supervisor: the Electronic Department, the Mechanical Department, the Systems Department and the Outreach Department. All these departments have their own structure and must provide the services necessary to achieve the institutional objectives. This system proved to be very efficient.\n\nThe next step was to obtain funding for a new institutional project. To achieve this, a new security plan was proposed to CONICET: the six hectares of the IAR property were fenced off, access to the institute was automated, and the entire property was monitored with more than 40 cameras. Security was unified with that of the neighboring AGGO observatory, with which an agreement was signed. With half of the budget spent on security guards in the past, this new system, fully developed and implemented by IAR staff in record time, freed up significant funds for other purposes.\n\nThese purposes were dictated by the new institutional project: the recovery of the radio telescopes, the complete upgrade of their technology, and the development of a new astronomical facility: the so-called Multipurpose Interferometric Array (MIA), which is now progressing with the construction of a demonstrator. Technology transfer has also been strongly promoted and new projects have emerged: from nanosatellites to medical equipment to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of the funds that had been obtained from the services were used for the improvement of the working conditions. The progress stimulated renewed support from CONICET, CIC and UNLP. New facilities were built, including a clean laboratory (Fig. 15). International support was strong, with generous donations and cooperation from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), the Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory, the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER), the Parkes Observatory, and others. More than 15 different types of agreements have been signed in 4 years. Also, the association with CONAE was strengthened with a new agreement and digital receivers for radio astronomy were developed for the two deep space antennas operating in Argentina. The first one was installed in December 2022.\n\nIn 2019, both radio telescopes are IAR were baptized and the observatory was reopened (Figs. 16 and 17). The telescopes, which had been called “Antenna 1” and “Antenna 2” for almost 50 years, were now named after Carlos M. Varsavsky and Esteban Bajaja, respectively. By the time of its 60th anniversary, the IAR was once again a leading research institute in Argentina."
