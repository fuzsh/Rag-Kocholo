        "text": "History of the US Jaycees\n\nHenry Giessenbier\n\nThe U.S. Junior Chamber founder Henry Giessenbierâs vision of providing young people with leadership through community service can be broken down into four Areas of Opportunity: Business, Individual, Community, and International.\n\nBusiness: embodying the line of the Jaycee Creed, which states âEconomic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise,â this area provides an opportunity for individual members to contribute to the development and enhancement of the economic infrastructure, prosperity, and well-being for their community as well as all nations.\n\nIndividual: embodying the line of the Jaycee Creed which states âEarthâs great treasure lies in human personality,â this area provides an opportunity for individual members to realize their personal potential through training programs.\n\nCommunity: embodying the line of the Jaycee Creed which states âService to humanity is the best work of life,â this area develops the sensitivity of individual members to societal problems and community dynamics by providing experience in community problem solving.\n\nInternational: embodying the line of the Jaycee Creed which states âThat the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations,â this area provides an opportunity for individual members to contribute to the development of goodwill, understanding, and cooperation among all peoples.\n\nThe Junior Chamber organization is: âa constructive action organization of young persons who devote a portion of their time to community service in the public interest, developing young persons as leaders in their communities.â (Taken from The U.S. Junior Chamber Bylaws Manual.)\n\nThe purpose of the Junior Chamber is: âto promote and foster the growth and development of young personsâ civic organizations in the United States, designed to inculcate (to teach and impress upon) in the individual membership of such organization a spirit of genuine Americanism and civic interest, andâ¦to provide them with opportunity for personal development and achievement and an avenue for intelligent participationâ¦in the affairs of the community, state, and nation, and to develop true friendship and understanding among young persons of all nations.â (Taken from The U.S. Junior Chamber Bylaws Manual.)\n\nSimply put, the purpose of the local chapter is to become a force for good in the community, determining community needs and providing solutions by planning and facilitating community service projects. In the act of serving, members receive hands-on experience, which translates to the enhancement of personal growth and the development of valuable leadership skills. This is the total Junior Chamber Concept.\n\nHenry âHyâ Giessenbier visualized an organization that would allow young men to develop their business skills and reputations in the community. In his era, most young men were out of school and working by the age of 15. Their first jobs were most likely the jobs they held throughout their lives. With luck and hard work, some might reach executive positions by their forties. Giessenbier felt that young men were not receiving the opportunities necessary to develop their skills at a younger age, thus depriving our nation of an important resource, and so he formed the founding ideals of the U.S. Junior Chamber.\n\n1915 Mission Inn St. Louis Mo â Birthplace of the Jaycees\n\nThe origin of Junior Chamber can be traced as far Â back as 1910 to the city of St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States of America. A young man named Henry Giessenbier and his friends formed the Herculaneum Dance Club, a social outlet for the communityâs youth. Unknown at the time, Giessenbier was laying the foundation for what would become a global movement. On October 13, 1915, the first JCI Movement was founded when 32 men joined to form the Young Menâs Progressive Association (YMPCA) at the Mission Inn located in their hometown of St. Louis, USA.\n\nFive years later, in 1915, Colonel H.N. Morgan, a prominent St. Louis citizen, inspired the members of the dance club to become more involved in civic issues. Giessenbier and 32 other young men formed the Young Menâs Progressive Civic Association (YMPCA) on October 13, 1915. This organization grew to a membership of 750 in less than five months.\n\nTHE BIRTH OF JUNIOR CHAMBER\n\nThe very next year, 1916, saw another change of name as the YMPCA became Junior Citizens, commonly called JCs, which later became Jaycees. The year 1918 marked another change as the JCs were affiliated with the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce and officially became the St. Louis Junior Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAfter WWI, Giessenbier contacted other cities in the United States with similar young businessmenâs groups, and, subsequently, 29 clubs from around the nation formed the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce. Henry Giessenbier was elected the first President of the national organization.\n\nCROSSING THE ATLANTIC\n\nThe international chapter of the organization began in 1923 with the Winnipeg Board of Tradeâs becoming the first Junior Chamber outside the United States. By 1928 the idea of an international body crossed the Atlantic Ocean to England.\n\nIn 1940 a resolution was passed by the United States Junior Chamber approving a program to further mutual interests among countries in Central and South America. This lead to the establishment of Junior Chambers in Mexico City, Guatemala City, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama City in 1943.\n\nThe realization of Junior Chamber International had Â begun. In 1944 the first international conference was held in Mexico City. Raul Garcia Vidal of Mexico was elected the first President. The countries which formed Junior Chamber International were: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and the United States of America.\n\nTHE FIRST WORLD CONGRESS\n\nTwo years later, in February of 1946, the first World Congress was held in Panama City. This congress was attended by 44 delegates from 16 different countries. The international organization was formally constituted, a temporary constitution was approved, and the word âCommerceâ was omitted from the official name.\n\nErasmo Chambonnet of Panama was elected the second JCI President at that Congress, and Australia and Canada were officially affiliated.\n\nIn 1948 the JCI Creed was officially adopted at the IV JCI World Congress in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1952 a permanent Secretariat was established. In 1972 the name was changed to Jaycees International; however, in 1988 the name was changed back to Junior Chamber International.\n\nU.S. Junior Chamber History\n\nHenry âHyâ Giessenbier visualized an organization that would allow young men to develop their business skills and reputations in the community.
