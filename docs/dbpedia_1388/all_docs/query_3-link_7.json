        "text": "Raúl García-Ordóñez was born in Littleton, New Hampshire, which was near the town of Bethlehem, a popular destination for Cuban golfers. He began his sporting career in Cuba in the late 1930s, but focused more on swimming at first than basketball. As a student at La Salle in Havana, however, he began to gravitate towards the latter sport.\n\nAfter two years of education at Ridley College in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, García-Ordóñez returned to Cuba to attend law school at the University of Havana. In order to do this, however, he needed to complete his Cuban Baccalaureate Program, and only Baldor Academy would permit him to do so in one year instead of two. During his time there, he helped them win a championship against the basketball powerhouses of Belen and La Salle in 1942. He joined the Cuban national team in 1943 and had many years of international experience prior to his selection for the delegation to the 1948 London Olympics. There, Cuba was eliminated in the round robin and placed 13th overall in the classification round. García-Ordóñez was chosen to carry the national flag during the Opening Ceremony."
