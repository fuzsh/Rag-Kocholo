Summarised her argument was, that by virtue of the filing on December 6th 2012 of the document titled Return of Writ of Habeas Corpus ad Subjiciendum and certain Affidavits in support thereof, which together established on the face of the record that both the deportation and detention orders issued respectively on the 24th day March 2010 and 7th day of December 2012 were lawful, section 23 of the Immigration Act, Cap. 190 ousted the jurisdiction of this Court to review the said Detention and/or Deportation Order.\n\n10\n\nThis Court ruled on this “in limine” submission on Monday 17th December, 2012 rejecting the same.\n\n11\n\nThe hearing of the substantive application commenced on 18th December 2012.\n\n12\n\nThe main focus of the claimant's submission shifted somewhat from the approach taken and/or outlined in the Without Notice Application of October 2012, but the factual matrix within which these submissions were made remains the same and I propose to begin by outlining the relevant facts in this determination.\n\nTHE RELEVANT FACTS\n\n13\n\nRaul Garcia is a Cuban national, having been born there in 1954. This fact, however, was not immediately known to the Barbadian authorities who apprehended him in 1994; and this concealment of his true identity was the genesis of the significant troubles facing Raul Garcia from 2010 to date.\n\n14\n\nIn September 1994 the Barbadian authorities apprehended a man named Edilberto Coronell, who was tried by the Barbadian courts for crimes involving the importation, possession and trafficking of a substantial amount of the drug cocaine (490 pounds). Edilberto Coronell carried a passport which identified him as a national of Colombia. This passport evidenced the fact that prior to his apprehension in September 1994; Edilberto Coronell had made two previous visits to Barbados in May and August 1994 and had used the same passport for travel to Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela (see Affidavit of Emerson Shepherd, Immigration Officer). Counsel for the respondents asserts that these are relevant facts, as is the fact that the passport of Edilberto Coronell was false.\n\n15\n\nIt appears also to be undisputed that Edilberto Coronell in the years prior to his capture in Barbados used the following aliases: Edilberto Coronell Munoz, Edilberto Munoz-Coronell, Edilberto Munoz and Raul Thomas Garcia. It is deposed that he has also used as his date of birth, the 4th day of September 1954 and the 5th day of January 1961.\n\n16\n\nEdilberto Coronell was eventually sentenced by our Court of Appeal to a term of imprisonment of 15 and 20 years for the drug related offences referred to above.\n\n17\n\nThere is some dispute as to when his true identity became known: whether 1997 (when Interpol passed certain information to the Commissioner of Police), 2001 (when the claimant asserts that he informed the then Superintendent of Prisons), or 2010 (when the information was first made known to Immigration Department/Chief Immigration Officer). However, since both the claimant and the respondents have based their submissions on the relevant authorities, (namely the Minister Responsible for Immigration and the Chief Immigration Officer) becoming aware of his true identify in 2010 (see Affidavit of and cross-examination of Emerson Shepherd; in addition the claimant as part of his case asserts that he informed the Immigration Department of his true identity in early March 2010), it has become a moot point whether this information was known prior to 2010. The claimant asserts that after the death of his son in 2001 from a drug overdose, he made his true identity known to the then Superintendent of Prisons, but it appears from the unchallenged Affidavit in Response of Cedric Moore, currently Assistant Superintendent of Prisons, filed herein on December 6th 2012 “that there is no record of the claimant notifying the Prisons in 2001 that he was not a Colombian national but was in fact a Cuban by birth”.\n\n18\n\nThe claimant tells us, and this was independently confirmed by the Chief Immigration Officer in 2010, (as evidenced by the Affidavit of Emerson Shepherd) that he abandoned Cuba with his family in 1964 at the age of ten (10). He spent his childhood and young adult life in the United States of America where he was subsequently granted the status of a legal permanent resident. (see Affidavit of David Welch Exhibit DW6).\n\n19\n\nIn 1988 Raul Garcia left the United States. At that time he had a 1982 conviction for cocaine possession and fled in avoidance of a pending drug charge. He took up residence in Colombia under a new identity, namely, Edilberto Munoz Coronell.\n\n20\n\nIt was from Colombia some 6 years later that he launched the enterprise of bringing drugs into Barbados for which he was incarcerated in 1994. His sentence of imprisonment for these offences came to an end in March 2010.\n\n21\n\nThe claimant raises in issue as a relevant fact his record in Barbados since incarceration. It is his assertion that he is fully rehabilitated and that the Raul Garcia of 1994 is not the same person presently before the Court. He asserts that he was a model prisoner who participated in Rehabilitation Programmes at the Prison, and at the end of his sentence both the Prison's Head of Custody, De Carlo Payne and his Rehabilitation Officer/Counsellor, Father Clement Paul gave the claimant an outstanding Rehabilitation Report (see Exhibit RG1 and 2). Whilst at the Prison he was enrolled in the Art Programme and won awards at the National Independence Festival of Creative Arts (NIFCA). He was allowed to participate in the annual Holetown Festival and Bridgetown Market and attended at Ilaro Court to receive his NIFCA Awards. It is his assertion (in large measure confirmed by the report of Superintendent of Prisons De Carlo Payne in his letter of 12th January, 2009) that he was an unofficial counsellor to other inmates who had drug addiction problems. He deposes that the death of his eldest son in 2001 of a drug overdose was cathartic and proved to be a significant milestone in his rehabilitation. It is also asserted by him that his prison sentence was discounted as a result of his good behaviour.\n\n22\n\nOn the 11th March 2010 the claimant's prison term came to an end. On that date, he was handed over to officers from the Immigration Department and was taken..."
