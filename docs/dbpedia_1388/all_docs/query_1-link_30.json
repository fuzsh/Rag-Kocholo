        "text": "Conceria Pasubio: Fatturato 350Mâ‚¬ (2022). Intervista al CEO Luca Pretto \"We donâ€™t have suppliers, we have partners. We are all part of a much bigger supply chain with the final customer that will choose one final product. So I feel part of Porsche, I feel part of Bentley, I feel part of Lamborghini. We share goals. We want to engage them in our strategy and we want to be transparent. We have to understand that we are part of a bigger family than our single company,\" Pretto states. \"Itâ€™s not a matter of contracts, itâ€™s a matter of a vision of the same target. We need to grow together, we need to perform together, but we have to sign a pact of continuous improvement.\" \"My concentration now is on who more than what. Who makes things happen and how to organize them, how to make talent grow in the company, how to attract talent from outside of the company. I want to be a facilitator of the talent in our company,\" \"With the right people, you can execute the perfect product.\" Pretto says. #leather #pasubio #concerie #supplychain #fashion #luxury #automotive #lamborghini #bentley #ferrari #bmw #rollroyce #mercedes #car #supercars\n\nDrive it like you stole it!! You DID!! ðŸ˜Ž 13th Apr, 2024 10:00 The April 2024 Auction Lot 187 1982 Porsche 928 S Stunning condition and history Sold for Â£21,275 <<< Manual 5 speed 928 ðŸ˜‹ Lot details Registration: VJM954Y Chassis: WPOZZZZ92ZDS840322 Odometer: 220,000 Transmission: Manual MOT: February 2025 Very low ownership Amazing service history Rare non-sunroof car Great original specification Fresh MOT Porsche 928 S Manual finished in possibly the best colour of Guards Red matched with the ultra-rare â€˜tweedâ€™ cloth trim. We are informed it was supplied new to Porsche Cars GB on 4/10/1982 for the personal use of the then managing director Peter Bulbeck, with whom it remained until sold in June 1984 to Mr Richard Cleare of R.H. Cleare & Company Ltd. He was a World Sportscar Championship entrant with a Tiga-Porsche for several years in the mid-1980s and managed a few outings in IMSA GTP at Le-Mans, not in this car thankfully! When the car left the factory in 1982, it was specified very well with such things as rear storage box, electric front left seat, cruise control, sport shock absorbers, recoil bumpers, limited slip differential, heated and electric passenger door mirror, forged alloy wheels and was ordered as a non-sunroof model. The service history is staggering with two service books filled with 27 stamps, all of which are Porsche dealers, as well as a large collection of invoices, receipts and even MOTs dating back to 1989. If you were to go through all the invoices, you would see a total expenditure of c.Â£130,000 of which c.Â£30,000 was spent in the last few years. We are sure this figure is on the lean side, and it could be considerably more if you factor in all the Porsche main dealer costs. The vendor even paid Porsche Bolton Â£60 for a set of new number plates in November this year, as he wasnâ€™t happy with how the previous ones looked. A testament to how each of the four owners have cared for it, which is not something you see very often. Passing its last MOT in November with no advisories, it sits on a set of matching Pirelli P Zero tyres and has recently benefitted from new boot carpets and floor mats. This example is one of the best cared for cars we have come across and deserves to go to an owner who will carry on with the same care and attention it has enjoyed all itâ€™s life. This is one of those cars where everything is as good as it could be, with an amazing history, great owners, manual gearbox, stunning condition and very rare too. This venerable classic 928 is a great opportunity to own and enjoy one of Porscheâ€™s landmark Grand Tourers. #classic #classics #classiccars #collectorcars #carcollectors #historic #vintage #performance #racing #rallying #driving #car #cars #automotiveindustry #auto #autos #autoindustry #auction #forsale #sold #automotive #investment #privatesale"
