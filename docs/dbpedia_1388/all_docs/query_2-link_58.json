        "text": "Her father was a psychiatrist and had a clinic in the city of Gijón, where she later moved to live with her two brothers and her mother, who was a teacher. Her parents’ higher education had a strong influence on the family’s three children, as it was always clear to the couple that they should all (both boys and girls) pursue a university degree, something unusual at a time when families did not normally support women’s education.\n\nJosé Salas, Margarita’s father, lived in the Student Residence in Madrid and knew the great intellectuals of the time, such as Buñuel, Dalí, Lorca and Severo Ochoa himself, who later played a key role in the scientist’s education and career. The friendship and certain kinship of Margarita’s father with the Nobel laureate had a decisive influence on her interest in becoming a biochemist. But her interests were not limited to science: as a child, she was educated in a religious centre, the Colegio de la Asunción in Gijón, where the sciences were just as important as the humanities and the arts, leading her to take an interest in both fields, an interest she kept up throughout her life. In her pre-university course she ultimately chose science, although she was torn between chemistry and medicine.\n\nThe event that marked Margarita Salas’s decision to pursue research happened while she was still a student: a talk by Severo Ochoa in Oviedo that she attended, and a book on biochemistry that he subsequently sent her from New York. She received a degree in Chemical Sciences and a PhD in Biochemistry from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) where she met her husband Eladio Viñuela, also a biochemist. They later both furthered their studies at New York University under the supervision of Severo Ochoa between 1964 and 1967. When she began her doctoral thesis in 1961 with Professor Alerto Sols, women were not working in research, although Ochoa ‘always treated me as a person, regardless of the fact that I was a woman’, Margarita later defended.\n\nTogether with Eladio Viñuela, with whom she shared all the time, sacrifice and passion that research work demands, she returned to Spain through funding from the Memorial Fund for Medical Research to embark on a line of pioneering research in the field of molecular biology, which was still in its infancy in Spain: the interesting phage (a virus that infects bacteria) known as Phi29. Soon after, they started taking on doctoral students, thanks to grants for the training of research personnel, and the laboratory began to thrive with new human and material resources. Margarita was however always in the shadow of her husband, who decided to shift his focus to another line of research —African swine fever virus— leaving her to lead the Phi29 study.\n\nMargarita Salas, who authored more than 350 scientific publications, supervised 30 doctoral theses, delivered over 400 presentations, and held 8 patents throughout her career, was always a strong advocate for women’s rights based on her own experiences. She served as a professor of Molecular Genetics at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) and directed the Severo Ochoa Center for Molecular Biology until 1994. Besides being a renowned figure in her field, she was a scientist known to the general public, which is uncommon in Spain, especially for a woman. She was probably the only scientist that non-scientific people recognized as a researcher. Moreover, Margarita was an excellent mentor; dozens of researchers passed through her laboratory and still identify themselves as “margaritos.” Many of them now hold important positions in the scientific sector.\n\nMargarita was a leading figure in condemning discrimination against women in science. She said it took her a long time to realise this and how it had affected her own career. But once she became aware of it, she always spoke out publicly about these gender biases. She was behind the creation of the first research centre in her field to be opened in Spain, the current Severo Ochoa Centre for Molecular Biology, where she devoted her entire life to the study of this small, simple virus, which she said ‘has a difficult name’: bacteriophage Phi29, which would later become the Spanish National Research Council’s (CSIC) most profitable patent with applications in genetic engineering and biotechnology. Her first patent earned the Centre for Scientific Research half of the income it received from all the patents registered during her tenure.\n\nA tiny protein associated with a virus became a true goldmine for spanish science thanks to Margarita Salas. The Phi29 polymerase allows for the amplification of a small DNA sample by thousands or millions of times, a crucial discovery for genetics laboratories, forensic researchers, and even the scientific police. This is one of the best examples of how basic science can also offer real and useful applications and significant economic returns.\n\nThroughout her life, Margarita received numerous awards and recognitions: she was the first Spanish scientist to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the United States and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was awarded the Mendel Medal, the Rey Jaime I Award, the National Ramón y Cajal Award, the “L’Oréal-Unesco For Women In Science” Award, and the Echegaray Medal, among other honors. The last recognition she received was the European Inventor Award 2019 in two categories: Lifetime Achievement and the Popular Prize, awarded by the public, something that had never happened in the history of these awards. Additionally, she was a Member of the Royal Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences and of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE). She served as President of the Institute of Spain, the institution that coordinates the eight academies of national scope, and received numerous honorary doctorates from a multitude of universities. Since 2002, she was an Honorary Member of the Association of Women Researchers and Technologists (AMIT).\n\nAfter the death of the Asturian scientist in 2019, her daughter Lucía Viñuela Salas, some of her disciples like former minister Cristina Garmendia, several Spanish Autonomous Communities, and institutions closely related to her professional life, such as the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) or the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), took the first steps to create a foundation in her name. In March 2023, the team of the Foundation joined the project, and it started with the aim of highlighting the legacy left by the inspiring figure of Margarita Salas, awakening scientific vocations at all ages and educational stages that project research in our country, supporting scientific dissemination to make this knowledge accessible, and becoming an international reference for support and promotion of STEAM education, as well as access and circularity of scientific-technical talent in the work environment."
