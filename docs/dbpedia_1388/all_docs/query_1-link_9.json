        "text": "FLINT, MI —Raul Garcia says he keeps a Vicks nasal inhaler in his car, pulls it out briefly whenever there is an “unpleasant smell\" and carries on with the job.\n\nThe man responsible for maintaining thousands of blighted properties in Flint says he does this sometimes unpleasant job because he loves the city and its residents.\n\nIn a few months, that will come to an end. Garcia is planning to retire in November as the city of Flint’s Blight Coordinator after seven years.\n\nMLive-The Flint Journal caught up with Garcia this past summer to talk about his life and his time spent fighting the massive problem of blight in the city.\n\nBeginnings\n\nGarcia was 60 years old and only a couple years into his retirement from the Flint Fire Department when he became the blight coordinator in 2013.\n\nHe knew the streets well after serving as a Flint firefighter for more than 16 years. He also knew blight was a crucial issue in the city, but was hesitant about accepting the job because he didn’t want to be “another incompetent city employee.”\n\nWhile he knew blight was a big problem for Flint, Garcia didn’t expect to be responsible for 14,000 properties, his personal estimate of how many blighted properties there are in Flint.\n\nHis first day on the job was a daunting. He said a towering stack of complaints waited on his desk. He dug in, calling residents who complained six months earlier. Each person said, “Wow, I’m surprised you’re even calling.”\n\nBlight refers to any land that is deemed to be in a dilapidated, unsafe or unsightly condition, so Garcia is responsible for maintaining everything from vacant lots with overgrown grass to abandoned or burned homes that could be dangerous. Garcia said it’s the perfect job for him because he likes to keep busy, and every day there’s something new.\n\nAlong with one other blight elimination officer, Adam Schumacher, Garcia is responsible for enforcing the city’s blight and illegal dumping ordinances.\n\nGarcia works from 8 a.m. to about 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, but he usually puts in extra hours. Why?\n\n“Because I love Flint,” Garcia said. “It always comes back to that.”\n\nSometimes, volunteers from Americorp or other volunteer organizations work with him and Schumacher, and he said he never asks someone to do something that he wouldn’t do himself.\n\nWhat it’s like fighting blight in Flint\n\nWhen he was first hired in 2013, Garcia was supposed to do the job for two years. Six years later, there’s still more work to do than he can manage on his own, and he has a lot of stories about everything he’s encountered.\n\nHe once investigated a vacant house where it was reported about 10 cats had been abandoned. Garcia said the house and the cats were in “unbelievable” condition. From the outside, swarms of flies could be seen circling the house. Inside, feces and filth were falling from the ceiling. Garcia and his team removed 50 cats who’d been abandoned in the house for more than nine months.\n\nA large part of Garcia’s job is heading cleanup efforts to address illegal dumping in the city. From dozens of tires dumped in an empty lot to heaps of trash bags forgotten on the side of the road, Garcia tries to respond. Once, Garcia had to remove the bodies of 35 dead dogs dumped on a street.\n\n“It doesn’t bother me,” Garcia said with a shrug.\n\nGarcia does his best to prioritize his daily tasks. He routinely takes stock of the blight office’s complaints and places the highest priority on properties in areas with a lot of residents, particularly those with children and seniors.\n\nHis second priority is addressing illegal dumping, which has been a big problem in the city. At least once or twice a week, Garcia has to clean up a property where someone has dumped trash. Often, he has to clean up the same properties repeatedly, as people who dump illegally tend to frequent certain spots in the city.\n\nGarcia said his favorite part of the job is the neighborhood Clean & Green groups of Flint residents he works with sometimes.\n\nClean & Green is a Genesee County Land Bank Authority program that supports community and neighborhood groups who clean and maintain vacant properties in the city. The groups do their best to mow lawns, pick up trash and aid in other maintenance projects in their area, but they call Garcia when there’s a bad case of blight or illegal dumping.\n\nGarcia said he really appreciates those groups, especially the ones who show up at work sites with volunteers when they know he’ll be working. When certain neighborhood groups call Garcia about blight or illegal dumping, he responds right away because he knows it will be truly appreciated.\n\nEvery year, Garcia takes the winter months off to go to Texas with his wife and work on the home he’s building outside the Houston area. Last year when he was leaving for the winter, a neighborhood group thought he wasn’t coming back so they invited him to their meeting at a steakhouse and bought dinner for him and his wife.\n\n“It’s just those kind of people that really touch my heart,” Garcia said. “This is what I like to do and it’s a good feeling. There are a lot of people who are really grateful and that’s what keeps me going.”\n\nMost residents are extremely grateful when Garcia follows through on taking care of a complaint, because they’ve often been made empty promises and let down in the past. Sometimes, though, residents take out their frustration with the city and the blight issue on Garcia, he said. Once, he went to a neighborhood and was greeted by an angry, aggressive man who was yelling that it was “about damn time” the city showed up. But that doesn’t deter Garcia.\n\n“I don’t let people bother me. When people get ignorant or disrespectful, my response is, ‘Obviously you’re having a bad day, I’ll come back another day,’ and I walk off,” Garcia said.\n\nIn the six years Garcia has spent working as the blight elimination coordinator, he has worked in every neighborhood and just about every inch of the city. He said no matter where he goes, he’s always felt safe on the job and has never felt like he was in danger.\n\n“I like to say I’ve earned my respect from Flint. (Residents) know that I’m out here trying to make a difference so I think that’s why they don’t give me a hard time,” Garcia said. “I do it because Flint made me who I am today.”\n\nHow Flint made him who he is today\n\nWhen Garcia first moved to Flint in May of 1980 as a young Army recruiter, he hated it.\n\nEvery week for his first two years in the city, he called his supervisor asking to be moved somewhere else. He was told he would have to stay in Flint for four years and make the best of it.\n\nSlowly, Garcia said, something changed. He was very successful as a recruiter, and his wife got a job as a social worker in the Flint schools.\n\nSuddenly, it was 14 years later, Garcia’s two children had graduated from Central High School, and he retired from the Army. He told his wife, “Well, it’s time to go home.\" But she was still working as a social worker and told him they weren’t going anywhere. So, he found something new to do.\n\nIt was always Garcia’s dream to be a police officer and they happened to be taking applications, so he applied. He was asked to apply for the fire department too, which he did on a whim, not thinking anything of it because he was one of 900 applicants for 25 available jobs.\n\n“I thought well it’s not gonna be in my favor, I’m 42 years old, I’m competing with these 25-year-old kids,” Garcia said.\n\nHowever, after he placed in the top 10 percent in an agility test, he made it to his final interview, in which he said he was a “little cocky.”\n\nThe last question the interviewer asked him was: Why should we hire you over all these younger guys?\n\nHe answered, “Well, for two reasons: The first reason is you only have to teach me one time, I pick up quick. Two, if you don’t hire me it’s your loss, not my loss.”\n\nThey seemed to agree, because he was hired soon after and fought fires in Flint for 16 years.\n\nGarcia grew up in a family of nine, with six siblings and a father who expected greatness. When he joined the military at 19 years old, his father said, “Don’t come back if you fail.”\n\nLike his father, Garcia believes in putting maximum effort into what he does, whether that’s in the military, as a firefighter, blight elimination coordinator or, most important to him, a family man.\n\nAll six of his siblings are educators, and he’s the only “bum,” as he puts it. He laughs when he recalls his father being mad at him for never going to college, to which he would reply, “Dad, I’m the happiest and I’ve done well for myself.”\n\nGarcia says he got lucky because he married a good woman and “batted 100 percent” because both of his two kids went to college and became educators. After not going himself, it was a big priority that his kids receive a college education.\n\nGarcia is proud to own two homes in Flint, one for him and his wife, and one right next door for his daughter and grandchildren. He always told himself that he would leave Flint and go home to Texas after his oldest grandson graduates high school. He’ll be graduating in 2021, so Garcia only plans on spending a couple more years in Flint.\n\nLife after Flint\n\nAfter seven years, Garcia is gearing up for retirement. He plans to fully be retired in November, he said.\n\nAlthough he’s excited for his next chapter, he’s worried about finding someone with enough “heart” to replace him.\n\n“I’ve been trying to find somebody who has the heart to do this job because to do your job, you have to treat people with respect even though they might not treat you with respect,” Garcia said.\n\nThere are three important qualities Garcia feels the next blight elimination coordinator should possess: They must have a big heart, know how to talk to people and have a strong work ethic.\n\nOnce he retires, Garcia will be looking for something new to do, much to the dismay of his wife, who wishes he would just enjoy retirement. He’s done a lot of volunteer work for Special Olympics in the past, so he thinks he might get more involved with that, or a program to help other veterans, or maybe seniors. Whatever he does, he wants to keep moving.\n\n“I just can’t sit at home doing nothing,” Garcia said.\n\nUntil then, though, Garcia will continue to spend every day doing his best to eliminate blight in Flint.\n\n“Flint was good to me,” he said. “I feel like I owe it to Flint.”"
