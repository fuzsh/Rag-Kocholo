        "text": "Tim Walz\n\ngovernor of Minnesota and vice presidential candidate\n\nTim Walz’s political biography is the kind of tale found in Hollywood movies, unless, of course, producers had rejected the screenplay as too ridiculous. Key points in his story include:\n\nServed in the National Guard for 24 years\n\nTaught geography in rural Minnesota, where he helped coach a high school football team to its first state championship\n\nBecame interested in politics in 2004 after a group of students he was chaperoning was denied access to a campaign event for Pres. George W. Bush\n\nElected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2006 to a seat that had previously been held by Republicans for more than a decade\n\nChosen by Kamala Harris in 2024 to be the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party\n\nEarly life\n\nTimothy James Walz was born in West Point, Nebraska, on April 6, 1964, to Darlene Rose Walz (née Reiman) and James F. Walz. His father was a high school administrator, and the family, which included his three siblings, lived in rural Nebraska. Walz graduated from high school in 1982; his graduating class had just 25 students. His father died the next year of lung cancer, and Walz worked for several years in agriculture and factory jobs while also serving as a member of the National Guard. He eventually attended college at Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska, graduating in 1989. Following in his father’s footsteps as an educator, he spent a year teaching in China before returning to Nebraska to teach and coach.\n\nLife in Minnesota\n\nMeet Tim Walz\n\nBirth date: April 6, 1964\n\nBirthplace: West Point, Nebraska, U.S.\n\nEducation: Chadron State College, B.S. in social science education, 1989; Minnesota State University, M.S. in educational leadership, 2001\n\nCurrent role: Democratic governor of Minnesota; vice presidential candidate\n\nFamily: Married Gwen Whipple in 1994; they have two children, Hope, born in 2001, and Gus, born in 2006\n\nQuote: “Right now, Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital—you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”\n\nWhile teaching in Nebraska, Walz met a fellow teacher named Gwen Whipple. The two married in 1994 and in 1996 moved to Minnesota, Whipple’s home state. Walz began teaching geography and coaching football at Mankato West High School. In 1999 he helped coach the football team to its first state championship. The same year Walz was approached by a student who wanted to start a gay-straight alliance and asked him to be the faculty sponsor. He took on the role, telling Minneapolis’s Star Tribune in 2018, “It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.”\n\nWhile teaching, coaching, and advising, Walz continued to serve in the National Guard, and he subsequently did tours that included stints in Europe and the Arctic Circle, as well as Arkansas and Texas. In 1995 Walz was stopped for driving 96 mph in a 55 mph zone. He failed a sobriety test, was arrested, and ultimately pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He no longer drinks alcohol but is often seen chugging Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nIn 2004 Walz took a group of students on a field trip to a campaign event for Pres. George W. Bush in Mankato. But, as Walz tells the story, the group was denied access because one of the students had a sticker for Bush’s opponent in the 2004 presidential election, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. Angered by what he saw as a snub of students who wanted to learn about the political process, Walz volunteered for the Kerry campaign.\n\nAlthough Kerry lost, Walz had caught the political bug. He wondered what the Democratic field for Minnesota’s 1st congressional district looked like only to discover that no one wanted to run against Republican incumbent Gil Gutknecht, who had held the seat since 1995. He attended a political boot camp named for the late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone that taught him about organizing and campaigning and, as Walz put it, “how to maintain your authenticity.” Helped by a wave of anti-Republican sentiment fueled by opposition to the Iraq War, Walz won the seat in an upset.\n\nLife as a politician\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Walz, a hunter and a gun owner in a largely rural district, developed a reputation for trying to work with Republicans in Congress and even received an A rating from the National Rife Association, until he renounced the group after the school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. He was also particularly active in working on legislation involving military families.\n\nIn 2018 Walz ran and was elected to become Minnesota’s 41st governor. His first term as governor was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 murder in Minneapolis of George Floyd. As protesters took to the streets to protest police brutality, the looting and violence was more than local police departments could handle. Minneapolis’s mayor asked Walz to send in the Minnesota National Guard. Walz issued an order to do so a day later, but he faced criticism from Republicans in the state for not acting sooner.\n\nDespite the controversy, he was reelected in 2022, and, in the wake of Democratic outrage over the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Minnesota Legislature became controlled by Democrats for the first time since 2014. As governor he helped pass legislation that secured abortion rights, allowed undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses, provided free lunches to all public school students, legalized marijuana, and enacted gun control regulations. In 2023 he became chair of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nWhile well-known and respected in Democratic Party circles, Walz was largely seen as a dark-horse candidate in the competition to become Vice Pres. Kamala Harris’s running mate. Other contenders for the position included Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. But Walz emerged as a straight-talking, energetic figure. He joked that he might cost the ticket votes in Wisconsin because, as a longtime Minnesota Vikings fan, he could not pretend to root for the Green Bay Packers. In the wake of controversy that swelled around Republican Party presidential nominee Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, Walz told supporters at a Harris campaign event in late July, “These guys are just weird.” Within days, weird had become the Democratic watchword for the Republican ticket. A week later Harris announced Walz as her running mate.\n\nTracy Grant"
