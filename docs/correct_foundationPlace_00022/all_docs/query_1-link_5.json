        "text": "Conceiving, designing and sustaining the built environment are among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The use of the latest modern computer technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning offer completely new possibilities for ecologically, and economically sustainable solutions to this challenge. Thanks to a generous donation of the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation, TUM has founded the \"TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute Artificial Intelligence for the Built World\" to conduct research on this future-oriented technological focus area.\n\nThe TUM GNI is closely associated with the Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI) and the Leonhard-Obermeyer-Center (LOC). A particular role in TUM GNI’s missions plays the execution of joint research projects between scientists from informatics and scientist from domains related to the built environment. You can find more information on the mission and structure of the TUM GNI here.\n\nFunding by Nemetschek Innovation Foundation\n\nThe TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute is funded trough a generous donation by the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation. The foundation supports the institute with initial funding of 20 million euros over the next ten years. In addition, the non-profit foundation is providing approximately 30 million euros in project funding. All details have been defined in a comprehensive funding agreement („Fördervereinbarung”) between the Nemetschek Innovationsstiftung and TUM, signed on November 10, 2020."
