        "text": "Editor's Note:\n\nI wrote this article for two main reasons: first, the immense opportunities in the AEC industry for the new generation, promoting it as a viable and impactful career choice. Second, I want to call on seasoned construction professionals to integrate their experience with emerging technologies, which is crucial for transformative changes in the industry. I reference 'Crossing the Chasm' and 'The Innovator's Dilemma' to underscore technology adaptation frameworks in tackling the industry's complex challenges and the need for a paradigm shift that prioritizes data in decision-making and policy formulation. If you're interested in advancing the industry through technology, I encourage you to get in touch and get involved.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nOver my decade-long journey in the architecture and construction industry, I've had the privilege of engaging with diverse individuals, ranging from onsite superintendents, project managers, architects, and engineers to startup founders, venture capitalists, angel investors, academics, and students. These interactions have highlighted the vastness and complexity of construction technology, encompassing everything from its fundamental concepts of construction management to advanced topics like the potential impact of AI on our industry.\n\nAt EllisDon, I've gained valuable insights into how a company's commitment to innovation can drive significant progress in the industry. The firm's top-down approach to fostering innovation sets it apart, an attribute many companies aspire to but often find challenging to implementâ€”this proactive stance on innovation influences business operations and growth.\n\nEllisDon's historical embrace of technology has been particularly remarkable. From introducing Canada's first tower cranes in the 1950s and early adoption of computerized accounting and cost control to building the Skydome in the late 80s and exploring Public-Private Partnership (P3) contracts in the 2000s, the company has consistently demonstrated adaptability and foresight. Recent endeavours, like in-house software development, launching the ConTech Accelerator (shout out to Provision, The Link , and Sitelink) and partnering with Timescapes for AI-powered construction cameras, further establish EllisDon as a trailblazer in industry innovation. These initiatives are a testament to EllisDon's progressive nature and mirror the broader trends and potential trajectories within the construction sector.\n\nAiming to provide a 30,000-foot overview of the construction technology landscape, I've tried to distill and document these diverse insights. The convergence of what was traditionally in construction point solutions or separate areas of expertise is now becoming more and more essential to be considered as parts of a whole. It's not just about understanding the current state of construction technology but also about envisioning future directions and possibilities and the discourse we can have around these topics. For those who may already be in the AEC industry or those joining the industry now, it is a great time to focus on construction technology; in the words of Paul Dirac, \"New ideas here are needed.\"\n\nIn this context, I find that we can glean a lot of wisdom from Clayton Christensen's \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and Geoffrey Moore's \"Crossing the Chasm\". These works offer valuable perspectives on technological disruptions across various industries, and their principles are particularly relevant to construction technology. They provide a framework for understanding the challenges of adopting new technologies we can apply in our industry, which traditionally leans towards incremental change.\n\nThe Evolutionary Course of Technology in Construction:\n\nTechnological advancements have dramatically reshaped traditional industries, leading to the emergence of specialized domains like PropTech (Property Technology) and FinTech (Financial Technology). PropTech encompasses a broad spectrum of tech innovations in real estate, addressing everything from financial proformas to transactional and operational processes. As a subset of PropTech, ConTech (Construction Technology) hones in on the construction sector, innovating building design and construction with novel tools and methods. This includes Building Information Modeling (BIM), many software and hardware solutions, reality capture technologies such as drones and laser scanning, 3D printing, robotics, IoT, and data.\n\nWhile PropTech has transformed real estate with online property listings, intelligent building technologies, and AI-driven market analysis, and FinTech has redefined financial services through digital banking, mobile payments, and blockchain innovations, the bet is that ConTech will bring a similar paradigm shift in construction. This transformation in ConTech is bringing about substantial changes in the industry, mirroring the transformative impact seen in its counterparts. This wave of digital revolution, stemming from the internet and communication advancements, sets the stage for Industry 4.0, ushering in a new era of interconnected and automated manufacturing and industrial processes.\n\nOther notable examples include:\n\nHealthTech: Technology in healthcare, including telemedicine, wearable health monitors, and AI in diagnostics.\n\nEdTech: The use of technology in education, from e-learning platforms to educational apps and virtual classrooms.\n\nAgriTech: Technological advancements in agriculture, like precision farming, drone technology, and sustainable farming solutions.\n\nCleanTech: Technology aimed at improving environmental sustainability, including renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles, and green building practices.\n\nInsurTech: Integrating technology in the insurance sector, streamlining processes and enhancing services through digital platforms, big data analytics, and AI-driven risk assessment tools.\n\nThe transformative changes in the PropTech and FinTech sectors set a promising precedent for ConTech. PropTech has changed real estate with platforms like Zillow and Rightmove, focused on property transactions and companies such as Roofr, Pandaloc, and Kin Insurance, introduced innovative solutions in roofing, landlord-tenant matchmaking, and simplified insurance, respectively. Further innovations include HouseSigma's real estate platform, HomeViews' property review site, and companies like VergeSense, Mynd Property Management, and TurboTenant transforming workspace analytics, property management, and landlord software.\n\nPropTech innovations allowing flexible renting/leasing, like Airbnb for residential and WeWork for commercial, have also contributed to this transformation. It is worth noting that it is not all profits and glory. Airbnb recorded its first profits since its IPO in 2018 in 2022, and WeWork is going through its bankruptcy procedure.\n\nSimilarly, FinTech has reshaped financial services with digital banking, mobile payments, and blockchain technologies. The presence of 300+ unicorns globally in the FinTech landscape as of 2024 makes it hard to ignore the significant impact and growth. Canadian success stories like Shopify's commerce platform, Wealthsimple's investment tools, Trulioo's electronic identity services, and FreshBooks' accounting solutions, alongside US giants such as PayPal's online payment system, Stripe's financial services, Block's (formerly Square) mobile payment solutions, and Chime's fintech innovations, collectively showcase the remarkable growth and innovation in North America's financial technology landscape.\n\nLike PropTech and FinTech, ConTech is on the path to bringing the same wave of change, leveraging new technologies to modernize project planning, execution, and management. The construction industry, traditionally slow to adapt, is undergoing a significant transformation and has caught the attention of some of the most prominent Venture Capitalists (VCs) from Silicon Valley. The history of ConTech reflects the evolution and integration of digital tools and advanced technologies in the construction industry, from the shift away from manual drafting to computer-aided design (CAD), from paper drawings to project and document management platforms and the adoption of BIM. And now, with the recent boom of artificial intelligence, there is a whole new realm of startups and new potential for existing offerings.\n\nIn the evolving ConTech landscape, startups now face a significant shift in financial dynamics. The once abundant venture capital, which served as a lifeline, enabling these innovators to find their footing in the market, has generally become more challenging to access. This escalation in capital costs presents a stark challenge, contrasting sharply with the previous year's more accessible funding climate. As a result, these startups, traditionally buoyed by venture capital until reaching market stability, must adopt a more bootstrapped approach. This new reality demands leaner operations and heightened resourcefulness, potentially slowing innovation's pace but, on the flip side, fostering a more sustainable and resilient growth path in this high-risk, low-margin industry. It also presents a perfect opportunity to see rollups, mergers, and acquisitions in the space.\n\nWith all of this potential and fast-moving changes in the ConTech space, I find it helpful to learn not only from adjacent industries but also from the works of others. I intend to explore how the theories of Clayton Christensen and Geoffrey Moore intersect with my practical, albeit anecdotal, experiences with technology in the construction industry.\n\nCollectively, these theories provide an excellent framework, aiding in understanding how disruptive technologies can be introduced and adopted in the construction industry. They can guide individuals and businesses (startups and existing AEC firms) through the complexities of innovation, market acceptance, and scaling in a sector traditionally slow to embrace changeâ€”a concept I will repeatedly state.\n\nUnderstanding Christensen and Moore's Theories in the Construction Context\n\nLet's dig into Clayton Christensen's \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and Geoffrey Moore's \"Crossing the Chasm\" and add the context of what we are seeing in ConTech.\n\nThe Innovator's Dilemma:\n\nChristensen's work on disruptive innovation explains how smaller companies with fewer resources can successfully challenge established businesses with technologies that initially seem inferior.\n\nDisruptive vs. Sustaining Innovation: Disruptive innovations create new markets by offering simpler, more affordable solutions, contrasting with sustaining innovations that improve existing products.\n\nKey Examples from the Book: The Hard Disk Drive Industry and Steel Mini Mills are classic examples of disruptive technologies that initially served niche markets but eventually overtook the established ones. Seagate Technology in the hard disk drive industry, Nucor's Mini Mills taking on the integrated steel market, Xerox's challenges with new printing technologies, Honda Motorcycles' disruptive entry with smaller bikes, and DEC's failure to adapt to the personal computer revolution.\n\nCrossing the Chasm:\n\nMoore's theory addresses the challenge of moving technology products from early adopters to the early majority.\n\nTechnology Adoption Life Cycle: This model categorizes consumers into groups, highlighting the 'chasm' between early adopters and the early majority.\n\nKey Examples from the Book: Autodesk's domination of the computer-aided design (CAD) market with AutoCAD and Adobe's establishment of industry standards through PostScript, Illustrator, and Photoshop exemplify successful strategies to cross the chasm. Apple's early personal computers and Intel's shift to microprocessors also exemplify this transition.\n\nApplying Theories to Construction:\n\nIn the construction context, these theories shed light on both the opportunities and challenges of new technology integration:\n\nDisruptive Innovation: Technologies like BIM, 3D printing, IoT, and AI, though starting small, can potentially revolutionize construction. Modular construction, while promising, exemplifies the struggle to find a niche that Christensen describes.\n\nMarket Adoption Challenges: New technologies often confront barriers to adoption, including costs, regulatory challenges, and skill requirements. Moore's framework assists in strategizing to bridge this gap.\n\nRisk Management and Stakeholder Dynamics: The construction industry's cautious approach and the complex web of stakeholders make adopting new technologies a nuanced process. I would recommend reading Aaron Toppston's article \"A Look Into Commercial Construction\" on Medium; Aaron highlights that the contracting process in commercial construction plays a crucial role in determining how risk is distributed among these stakeholders. Different contract types (from lump sum to design-build), specific scopes of work and risk allocations. This contractual framework significantly influences the adoption and application of technology in the industry.\n\nScaling Innovations: Christensen and Moore provide insights into scaling innovations from niche applications to industry-wide standards.\n\nIntegrating the insights from \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and \"Crossing the Chasm\" into the context of the construction industry is priceless. Their theories offer a must-read perspective for business leaders and industry experts, providing crucial frameworks for understanding technological adoption and market dynamics. BIM is an excellent example of successful market penetration, reflecting Moore's concept of crossing the chasm. Its adoption in over 70% of global projects marks the transition from a niche tool to a mainstream methodology. However, to fully realize BIM's potential across the lifecycle of projects, more integrated implementation strategies are needed, justifying the need for government mandates. I know this sounds particularly striking to my American friends coming from a Canadian!\n\nOn the other hand, technologies like modular construction embody Christensen's concept of disruptive innovation. Modular construction has yet to find its footing in the market despite its potential to revolutionize construction practices. Can it follow a similar path that the steel mini-mills did?\n\nFor professionals in the construction industry, the insights gleaned from 'The Innovator's Dilemma' and 'Crossing the Chasm' are far more than theoretical concepts; they serve as practical guideposts. These theories aid in developing tailored strategies and skillfully navigating the intricate terrain of technology adoption and implementation, which invariably differs from one technology to another. For example, I think the approach required to implement a BIM strategy differs significantly from that needed for robotics integration. However, the overarching digital construction strategy must harmonize these diverse elements, orchestrating them to function cohesively at a higher level. This nuanced understanding is essential for effectively leveraging various technological advancements within the construction industry.\n\nChallenges in Implementing ConTech: A Grounded View\n\nLet's assume that ConTech can be heralded as a manifestation of Christensen's disruptive innovation, and based on the PropTech and FinTech chasm crossing, we should have the same fate with ConTech.\n\nIn reality, construction faces significant practical difficulties in the implementation of technology. I mentioned modular construction earlier; the practical business difficulties are evidenced by the closure of many modular construction divisions and startups, highlighting the complexities of translating theoretical innovation into market-ready solutions.\n\nConstruction, being risk averse and having a slower adoption rate, has also proven to be a longer-burn industry for sales compared to traditional markets, with an average of 8 touchpoints before a conversion. As anecdotal as it may be, I have heard from various folks, from innovation leads to startups and VCs, that they are noticing a much longer number of touchpoints to get through in our industry. Even some core technologies, like document and project management tools, have had a long burn to hit their market equilibrium. For example, Tooey Courtemance, founder of Procore, mentioned it took them 13 years to finally cross the $10M revenue mark. They had roughly raised $30M (not to mention all the risk Tooey took personally), but in the following 8 years, they had over $800M in revenues. Worth mentioning is that they started in the early 2000s (side note: check out the 20VC podcast episode).\n\nUnderstanding the contractor perspective in the construction industry reveals a deep-seated culture of risk aversion and comparatively modest R&D investment, primarily driven by the industry's narrow margins and cash flow challenges. This is further compounded by the intensely competitive nature prevalent across North American construction markets, where traditionally, the lowest bid often secures the deal. Consequently, startups, innovators, and established players must navigate not just the development of products, technology, and distribution strategies as per Christensen's framework but also brace for longer sales cycles, a reality distinct from other sectors. This is particularly evident in the case of megaprojects, which frequently pioneer innovation, their larger budgets enabling the incorporation of advanced technology to mitigate project risks. While this isn't an absolute rule, it's a notable trend observed by many. Therefore, patience becomes a critical virtue for ConTech startups, even more so than for their counterparts in PropTech or FinTech, who operate in comparatively less constrained environments (but have their own challenges).\n\nIt reminds me of a quote from Keynes: \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\"\n\nDocument Management in Moore's \"Crossing the Chasm\" Framework:\n\nIn Moore's framework, the journey of Fieldwire by Hilti and PlanGrid, an Autodesk company in the construction industry, illustrates the quintessential crossing of the chasm. Initially, these platforms appealed to a limited group of tech-savvy early adopters who quickly recognized their potential. Over time, their user-friendly and reliable nature helped them gain traction with a broader audience in the construction sector. This broader market values tools that simplify and streamline their workflows.\n\nThe acquisition of PlanGrid by Autodesk for $875 million in 2018 and Fieldwire by Hilti for $300 million in 2021 underscores this transition. These acquisitions validated the growing importance of innovative technology in construction. They enabled companies like Autodesk and Hilti to enhance their product offerings, like Autodesk's Docs module, and expand their software suites. This strategic move by larger companies is a testament to the successful crossing of the chasm, where these digital tools have moved from niche solutions to essential components in the construction industry's toolkit.\n\nChristensen's \"Innovator's Dilemma\" in Document Management:\n\nThe evolution of project management from a paper-heavy, manual process to the adoption of digital tools like Fieldwire and PlanGrid aligns with Christensen's concept of disruptive innovation. Before the advent of digital tools like Fieldwire and PlanGrid, construction teams relied heavily on printing full-size and half-size paper drawings. Updates to these drawings posed significant challenges â€“ they were often manually taped onto the existing plans, a method that was not only cumbersome but also fraught with inefficiencies and a high potential for error. This reliance on physical, paper-based processes made project management in construction slow and introduced room for inaccuracy, reflecting an industry deeply rooted in traditional methods.\n\nThe introduction of digital tools marked a significant departure from these outdated methods. Fieldwire and PlanGrid initially catered to specific, unaddressed needs within niche markets. They offered streamlined, efficient solutions for project management and collaboration, challenging the construction industry's status quo. Their eventual adoption and integration into the operations of larger, established companies highlight a strategic pivot towards embracing innovative, disruptive solutions to remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.\n\nIntegrating digital document management tools like Fieldwire and PlanGrid into construction aligns with Clayton Christensen's disruptive innovations and Geoffrey Moore's concept of crossing the market adoption chasm. These technologies have been pivotal for the industry's advancement in the digital era.\n\nLooking back at the Brookfield Place Calgary Project in 2014 (check out this video for an overview), where we implemented Fieldwire, the initial reception of these tools was mixed. Early adopters quickly recognized their potential, while many seasoned professionals remained skeptical. This period was critical in demonstrating the diversity of attitudes towards new technologies in construction.\n\nAt that time, adopting Fieldwire alongside traditional printed drawings was a strategic approach to bridge the gap between the tech-forward early adopters and the more traditional late majority. This strategy reflected Moore's 'Crossing the Chasm' concept, acknowledging the varied pace of technology adoption in the construction sector.\n\nIn retrospect, while adopting digital tools in the construction industry now seems obvious, it was a journey requiring strategic insight and adaptability. It highlights the importance of catering to different user groups, ensuring a smooth transition to innovative technologies and maintaining the industry's competitiveness and efficiency in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. And seeing the chasm being crossed in realtime.\n\nBuilding Information Modeling: Addressing The Slow Adoption Challenges\n\nBIM's emergence in the construction industry, particularly in the early to mid-2000s, signified a crucial shift in design and construction practices, paralleling the broader evolution of digital technology. This transformation, however, came with challenges, such as varying effectiveness based on project complexity, steep learning curves, and different levels of industry preparedness. This is commonly discussed in many sources; I recommend checking out Alice Leung 's post on Substack.\n\nReflecting on my experience at BRZ Architecture in 2012, specifically during the design of the Pincher Creek Municipal District Building, I remember working on the working drawings using traditional CAD software. For renderings and visualizations, we used SketchUp, which was especially helpful given the building's curved design. There was a critical moment when I tried to coordinate the mechanical and electrical systems against the structure's curvature, which became challenging. SketchUp proved invaluable in quickly modelling these systems, allowing me to understand and correct misinterpretations in CAD drawings. However, when the opportunity arose to use Revit on a new project with tight deadlines, I hesitated. It became clear that transitioning from CAD and SketchUp to Revit took a lot of work. Achieving the same level of detail and accuracy in Revit required more time than we could afford on the project. This experience underscored an essential aspect of BIM implementation: learning new software and a fundamental change in business processes. Adopting BIM is often a slow and incremental shift, demanding new skills and reevaluating traditional project design and execution methodologies while still delivering under stringent project timelines.\n\nIn North America, the gradual acceptance of BIM can be analyzed through the lens of Clayton Christensen's \"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which highlights the reluctance of established firms to embrace disruptive technologies. This hesitance results in a gap between early adopters and the broader industry, as illustrated in Geoffrey Moore's \"Crossing the Chasm.\" In contrast, government mandates in the UK and Singapore have effectively pushed past these barriers, showcasing the significant role of policy in driving technological adoption. However, this approach has sparked debates about government intervention versus market-driven innovation in the construction industry.\n\nEffective BIM implementation also depends on aligning contractual structures and client understanding. Clear communication about BIM's capabilities and limitations is critical. The UK BIM Level 2 and ISO 19650 standards have been instrumental in this regard. The UK BIM Level 2, mandated by the government, specifies practices and standards for digital project management, including model creation, collaborative working, and standardized data formats. ISO 19650, building on these principles, provides international guidelines for managing information throughout a built asset's life cycle, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in both delivery and operation. These standards promote collaboration, reduce errors, and improve quality and sustainability in construction projects, benefiting the entire industry.\n\nThe evolution of BIM in construction parallels the earlier transition from manual drafting to CAD. This shift from labour-intensive, traditional drafting methods to streamlined, computerized processes in the late 1980s and early 1990s marked a significant revolution in engineering design. In a similar vein, BIM is transitioning from a novel concept to an indispensable tool in construction, showcasing the profound influence of technological advancements on industry practices.\n\nAn important aspect to consider is the cost implication of these technological shifts. Before CAD, drawing a line on paper had a tangible material cost. With the advent of CAD, the cost of creating a line dropped dramatically, becoming infinitely cheap. However, this brought about a trade-off: less time was spent contemplating the design being drawn. Those who have experienced hand drafting can relate to the frustration of tearing a sheet while erasing a line and the ensuing need to start over. In contrast, CAD introduced a level of ease and flexibility in design modifications.\n\nThis technological shift also brought about a change in roles within the industry. The move from architects as master builders to General Contractors (GCs) taking on a more significant role in coordination is evident, especially in BIM processes. This is highlighted by the emergence and growth of Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) teams within GCs and trade companies. This evolution reflects a change in tools and processes and a shift in the dynamics of construction project management and execution.\n\nModular Construction and Theoretical Synergy: Navigating Real-World Complexities\n\nThe convergence of Clayton Christensen's and Geoffrey Moore's theories is particularly evident in ConTech. Yet, the journey of modular construction underscores the considerable disparity between theoretical projections and practical feasibility. In recent years, there has been substantial investment in the modular sector by GCs and VCs, making it one of the most frequent investments since 2019.\n\nTake, for example, the now-defunct Katerra, a notable startup that adopted the traditional Silicon Valley growth model. Katerra's collapse, likely due to a mix of factors, including soaring costs, COVID-19 impacts, unprofitability, project delays, factory closures, and a controversial track record, represents a perfect storm. Its strategy, emulating the rapid growth typical of tech industries, seemed misaligned with the slower-paced real estate and construction sectors. Similarly, Veev, once hailed as a \"unicorn\" in Silicon Valley and focused on modular residential homes, encountered parallel challenges, leading to the liquidation of its assets after failing to secure further capital.\n\nThe widespread adoption of modular construction faces numerous obstacles. These include diverse building codes, limited state or provincial programs, transportation costs, and a general need for more understanding among developers. Organizational challenges, a scarcity of domestic manufacturers, and significant capital and operational costs further complicate matters. The construction sector is also beholden by volatile business backlogs and pipelines, planning complexities, political instability, and the novelty of modular construction. Additionally, the requirement for uniform, reproducible designs presents a challenge in an industry known for its variability. The law of diminishing returns in the construction technology sector, as highlighted by Jonathan Marsh and Jeff Sample on The ConTechCrew Podcast episode, stuck with me. This principle, illustrating how further investments yield smaller returns, is a critical insight for those in the industry.\n\nDespite these challenges, prefabrication and modular construction are predicted to grow and substantially impact the industry. However, they are unlikely to replace traditional onsite construction methods completely. The inherent characteristics of the construction industry, exemplified by decentralized operations and the need for specialized onsite skills, make a total shift to factory-based construction impractical. The future of construction will likely involve combining traditional methods and an increased use of prefabricated components, blending the best of both worlds. A push to DfMA, as we've already seen with multi-trade racks for mechanical ductwork, sprinkler pipe, electrical trays and conduits, lighting, framing and drywall.\n\nSoup de Jour: AI in Construction\n\nThe recent spotlight on Artificial Intelligence (AI), mainly due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), has underscored its significance in modern technology. While AI extends its capabilities beyond LLMs to tasks like automating data analysis and crafting predictive models, its evolutionary path closely aligns with the trajectories depicted by Moore and Christensen.\n\nLet's simplify AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). AI is like giving computers the ability to do things we think need human smarts, like understanding languages or finding patterns. ML is a part of AI where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being directly programmed. Deep Learning is a more complex part of ML, using large networks that can handle big data to make decisions. Large language models (LLMs) use AI, ML, and DL to understand and create human-like language. I recommend reading Hugh Seaton's book, The Construction Technology Handbook, an excellent primer on AI and ConTech.\n\nMajor tech firms, including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, and Amazon, are heavily investing in AI. Microsoft's acquisition of OpenAI exemplifies Christensen's 'The Innovator's Dilemma,' where established companies acquire startups with disruptive technologies to maintain industry leadership. In construction, this trend is echoed by companies like Autodesk, Procore Technologies, and Nemetschek Group with initiatives such as Autodesk AI, Procore Copilot, and Nemetschek's partnership with elevait GmbH & Co. KG, underscoring AI's increasing importance within our industry.\n\nIntegrating AI in construction signals the industry's evolving direction. It brings forth challenges, including enhancing digital literacy and adapting existing methods to new technological advancements. AI's proficiency in managing repetitive tasks, aiding in design and planning, and offering predictive insights presents significant advantages for workers, companies, and clients alike. Concurrently, the global AI infrastructure market is poised for substantial growth, expected to exceed a 35% CAGR for the next several years. This development holds promise for GCs in both adopting new technologies and constructing AI-focused data centers.\n\nEarly adopters set the industry's direction and reap benefits, emphasizing the importance for firms and individuals to engage with AI actively. Bridging the \"chasm\" and overcoming the \"Innovator's Dilemma\" requires a concerted effort to embrace digital transformation and upskill the workforce in AI and digital technologies. Efforts to address these challenges include substantial-tech investments and the development of construction-specific AI solutions. McKinsey reports that construction invests about 1% in technology, significantly lower than other industries, highlighting the need for increased digitization and investment in data processing tools and capabilities. Bloomberg also forecasts that AI is going to become up to 12% of IT spending in the not-too-distant future.\n\nChatGPT has proven its ability to handle various tasks, from practical applications to creative endeavours. In the construction industry, several innovative startups are utilizing GPT-like technology, integrating it with domain-specific expertise:\n\nTogal.AI simplifies the estimation process by enabling users to upload architectural drawings and automatically produce quantities, counts, and take-offs. It also offers the convenience of asking specific questions like \"How many parking spaces do we have?\"\n\nThe Link employs AI to streamline the complex process of managing construction specifications. Their system efficiently generates submittal logs, which traditionally demand significant manual labour. The technology enhances user experience by allowing queries like \"What submittals do I need for curtainwall?\"\n\nProvision a startup specializing in identifying and managing risks in construction contracts. This platform not only aids in fostering improved collaboration but also supports language-based prompts, enabling users to ask direct questions like \"What are the liquidated damages provisions in the contract?\"\n\nThese examples showcase how blending AI with construction expertise is really starting to change traditional practices, making processes more efficient and user-friendly and bringing a modern, data-driven approach to various aspects of construction management. Early innings, but I am excited to see how this will continue to grow.\n\nEven before the rise of LLMs, AI was already making significant strides in the construction industry, particularly as a powerful data processing and verification tool. Often too resource-intensive for traditional methods, these tasks found a new ally in AI. Let's look at some of the practical applications of AI in the construction industry over the past few years:\n\nIn 2019, our team won a new project which involved constructing a new bridge, overpass, MSE walls, and creek realignment. This project allowed us to pilot AI Clearing's solution. This technology compares our Civil 3D/CAD designs and project schedule with drone imagery. The tool proved effective but highlighted the necessity of converting 2D documents into 3D documents, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive digital data requirements to help with broader adoption. Check out this video for an overview.\n\nAlso in 2019, we explored Quartz.co, a tool developed to assist our concrete and formwork teams in detecting potential issues, such as overlooked sleeving before concrete pours. Quartz.co was innovative but slightly ahead of the curve, as the industry was still (and still is) adapting to providing timely digital information. Unfortunately, the company had to close down, reflecting the challenges associated with the early adoption of advanced technologies in a market that needed to be prepared for them. Check out SiteAware now, though.\n\nin 2020 with Versatile. This system, equipped with various sensors, including weight cells and accelerometers, offered insights into crane usage. Our implementation of Versatile provided a new perspective on crane operations, contributing to our understanding of AI's potential in construction\n\nin 2021 and 2022 with Buildots on the University of Toronto's SRIC Project. We employed their technology for tracking construction progress using 360-degree photographic data compared against our BIM and schedule information. Initially met with some skepticism, the use of Buildots and our VDC strategy earned EllisDon the Construction Management Award in the 2023 Innovation Spotlight Awards by Building Transformations, showcasing AI's evolving role and impact in the construction industry.\n\nLet's not forget the applications of computer vision use cases in construction. Companies like Timescapes, AICON and others are providing tools to turbocharge project insights by deploying analytics on project progress photos and continuing to build out construction-specific analytics.\n\nThe generative AI side of things in the ConTech market is also pretty impressive, although I haven't been able to directly work with these offerings, from conceptual and design options-focused startups like TestFit and Hypar to construction schedule simulation with ALICE Technologies Inc. and with production and construction-ready models and drawings like Swapp and Augmenta.\n\nMy experience with these technologies underscores AI's practical value in construction, moving beyond theoretical models and into tangible applications. A data-first approach is essential to fully harness the potential of these advanced tools across more types of projects. AI-based technologies have the potential to revolutionize civil and commercial projects. Still, their efficacy depends on the quality of digital information fed into them from the start. The principle of \"garbage in, garbage out\" is particularly pertinent here, emphasizing the importance of reliable data as a foundation. This need underscores why digital mandates are crucial in optimizing the benefits of these AI technologies in construction.\n\nThe Convergence of Reality Capture\n\nThe development and integration of reality capture technologies in construction, such as LiDAR, drones, and photography, closely align with the concepts in Christensen's \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and Moore's \"Crossing the Chasm.\" Initially evolving from basic spatial measurement methods, these technologies have undergone significant incremental improvements, epitomizing the disruptive innovation Christensen described. The shift from traditional surveying techniques to sophisticated digital methods like LiDAR marked a pivotal advancement.\n\nOne of the key factors in bridging reality capture technology from early adopters to a broader market, as Moore outlines, has been the emergence and integration of 360-degree photography. This technology, more accessible and user-friendly than specialized tools like LiDAR, played a significant role in democratizing reality capture for a wider audience. While LiDAR offered unparalleled precision, its complexity and cost limited its early use to larger projects or those requiring high precision. In contrast, 360-degree photography, being more affordable and easier to use, quickly gained popularity for a wide range of applications in construction, from project documentation to management. This broadened the technology's appeal and facilitated its crossover into mainstream construction practices.\n\nIn practical terms, reality capture is now commonly used in construction for tasks such as verifying floor flatness and levelness, creating detailed as-built documentation for aligning construction with design plans and coordinating existing conditions for the new design. Post-construction, these technologies are making their way to proving out the value for facility management and maintenance. Giving rise to a new phenomenon, the digital twin.\n\nThe trajectory of reality capture technology in construction, from laser scanning to the rise of 360-degree photography, demonstrates the journey from niche innovation to widespread industry acceptance. This transition illustrates the principles discussed in \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and \"Crossing the Chasm,\" where a technology initially adopted by a few pioneers becomes essential in a broader market as it aligns more closely with industry needs and accessibility.\n\nI think the convergence of reality capture is not just a technological advancement but also a reflection of the construction industry's adaptation to modern project management principles and the embrace of innovative, accessible technologies. The next frontier is to use AI to help reduce the time it takes to process the captured data and create automated outputs for the end users, including 3D models and floor plans. A great startup in this space is builtstream Inc. aiming to transform point clouds into 3D models.\n\nIoT, VR/AR, and Robotics\n\nThe integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in our everyday lives has successfully 'crossed the chasm' to widespread acceptance, mirroring a similar trajectory in the construction industry. Just as devices like Google Nest and Amazon Alexa have become commonplace in homes, streamlining daily routines with smart automation, IoT is carving a similar path in construction. This trend is akin to the futuristic visions seen in movies like 'Minority Report' and 'The Terminator,' where advanced technology seamlessly integrates into daily life and work.\n\nAR/VR, which once seemed like a distant concept from 'Minority Report,' is now transitioning into a practical tool for project visualization and design coordination in construction. These technologies are transforming how projects are presented, reviewed, and visualized, much like their cinematic counterparts. And with Apple's Vision Pro, we can expect a bigger push into the mainstream around the corner.\n\nIn contrast, the adoption of robotics in construction initially brought forward apprehensions reminiscent of 'The Terminator.' The concern wasn't about a dystopian future but job security â€“ the fear that robots might replace human workers. However, construction robots are proving to be assets that enhance precision and reliability in tasks. They're here to assist, not to chase Sarah Connor, echoing the iconic 'I'll be back' line with a positive twist: robots returning to complete construction jobs accurately and efficiently.\n\nMy first experience with VR was using Google Cardboard and a nifty script that my colleague had helped write to export Navisworks viewpoints in panoramic format; it was very cool, but it wasn't well received on-site. When the Oculus GO was released, we showcased a project for a client at an open house, taking the first steps in using VR for project presentation. We later used the VR session to replace a mock-up review. This transition to VR for virtual mock-ups instead of traditional physical ones aligns with Christensen's theory on how VR can change conventional practices in design reviews.\n\nIoT's practical applications in construction are extensive and growing. From sensors monitoring concrete temperatures to cameras tracking progress, the parallels with its use in consumer technology are evident. My work with Alberta IoT and EllisDon has reinforced that we are just beginning to get beyond the early adopters to the early majority in the AEC industry.\n\nRobotics in construction is also gaining momentum. The excitement around Boston Dynamics' Spot and Hilti's Jaibot marked the beginning of a new era in construction robotics, leading to innovative startups like Optimotive and Raise Robotics. The field is expanding with automated layout solutions from Rugged Robotics, Dusty Robotics, and HP Site Print, indicating a burgeoning future for robotics in construction.\n\nAs these technologies evolve from niche innovations to industry standards, they reflect the progression outlined in 'The Innovator's Dilemma' and 'Crossing the Chasm.' IoT, AR/VR, and robotics are becoming more integrated into construction processes, opening new possibilities for the AECO industry.\n\nData\n\nThe linchpin connecting the diverse technologies in construction â€” from BIM and AI to Robotics, IoT, and drones â€” is data. It's not just the data we gather, create, or analyze but the capacity to harness it for informed decision-making that truly unlocks value. Reflecting on Winston Churchill's famous words, \"We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us,\" it's apt to consider a modern twist in our digital age: \"We create our data, and thereafter, it shapes us.\"\n\nThis adage resonates profoundly in the context of construction technology. Just as buildings once shaped our environments, now the data we generate shapes the future of construction. However, the journey of data integration in construction aligns with the theories of \"Crossing the Chasm\" and \"The Innovator's Dilemma.\" Adopting data-driven technologies faces the challenge of bridging the gap from early adopters keen on innovation to the pragmatic early majority who prioritize reliability and widespread utility. This transition is pivotal for technologies to become mainstream in construction. Hence why, we need field-experienced folks just as much as we need the technology; you can't have one without the other.\n\nThe trajectory of data-centric technologies in construction aligns with the narrative presented in \"The Innovator's Dilemma.\" Initially, the disruptive impact of these technologies is often met with skepticism, perceived as overly complex or excessively novel. However, as these technologies mature and their benefits in improving efficiency and decision-making become evident, they gradually earn wider acceptance. This transition from being viewed as innovative novelties to becoming industry standards is pivotal for harnessing the full potential of data in construction. The growing presence of data scientists and data analysts within the construction industry indicates that we are well along this transformative journey.\n\nThe point is that embracing the digital transformation in construction is not just about adopting new technologies; it's about understanding and navigating the intricacies of this technological evolution paired with an understanding of the business of construction. The industry's success in leveraging data effectively hinges on its ability to navigate these theoretical frameworks, ensuring that data doesn't just inform construction practices but fundamentally reshapes them for the better. In doing so, we harness the true power of data, where it becomes not just a tool for construction but a cornerstone of industry innovation and growth.\n\nIndustry Organizations\n\nIndustry organizations play a crucial role in propelling ConTech forward; organizations like Building Transformations , buildingSMART International, BuiltWorlds, Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), and Canadian Construction Association - Association canadienne de la construction (CCA) are playing a pivotal role in driving the industry's digital transformation by providing a place and space for us to network, discuss, and learn.\n\nBuilding Transformations complements these efforts by fostering industry innovation through various programs, events, certifications, think tanks, and awards. They offer membership opportunities for individuals and organizations, aiming to improve best practices and drive efficiencies across the construction industry.\n\nBuildingSMART International is dedicated to advancing digital innovation, mainly focusing on international BIM standards. Their work enhances collaboration and efficiency throughout project and asset lifecycles, with programs emphasizing Standards, Compliance, and User Engagement to encourage BIM adoption and a more integrated digital approach in construction.\n\nBuiltWorlds, meanwhile, serves as a dynamic network and community, bridging the gap between construction and technology. It provides a vital platform for professionals to share insights, explore emerging technologies, and collaborate. BuiltWorlds is a catalyst for innovative thinking and application in the built environment through conferences, research, and digital content.\n\nMeanwhile, the AGC and the CCA serve as national advocates for the construction industry in the US and Canada, respectively. They champion the adoption of innovative construction practices and technologies, providing their members with policy advocacy, educational resources, and support. Both organizations play a crucial role in fostering an environment conducive to technological advancement within their respective regions and across the broader construction industry.\n\nTogether, these organizations are instrumental in shaping the construction industry's future. By advocating for technological adoption, fostering collaborative environments, and providing platforms for innovation and knowledge sharing, they ensure that the construction sector remains at the forefront of digital and technological advancements while working to attract more talent into the industry.\n\nConclusion: Crafting a Realistic Future for Construction\n\nAs the construction industry stands at a crucial junction, influenced by theoretical insights and tempered by real-world experiences, it faces a complex landscape. Embracing ConTech requires innovation and recognizing and addressing the inherent challenges in these technologies. Moving forward, a balance of visionary thinking and practical industry knowledge is crucial in shaping a realistic, efficient, and sustainable construction future.\n\nStartup Highlight: these startups showcase the culmination of many technologies covered earlier.\n\nAI Clearing : Specializes in construction progress monitoring through AI Surveyor, leveraging machine learning and drone data for auto site reports.\n\nAugmenta: Focuses on automating building design for contractors and engineers.\n\nBuildots: Develop a data-driven construction management platform using AI and a 360-degree camera.\n\ncmBuilder.io: A web-based site logistics and pre-construction planning tool launched publicly on September 15th, 2020.
