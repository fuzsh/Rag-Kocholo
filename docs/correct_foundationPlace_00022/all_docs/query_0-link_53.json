        "text": "Detail was established in the 1960s; the company established by Georg Nemetschek took its first steps in the same era. The passion for digital planning processes has never left him. In the meantime, more than one generation of planners has grown up with products from the Nemetschek Group. For Georg Nemetschek, there is no retirement and no stopping. We are pleased to share his overview of the past 60 years and his perspectives for the future.\n\nWhat is the legacy of the 1960s?\n\nI prefer to leave any judgement of the architecture of that time to the architecture critics, but I will say this: the prefabricated buildings of the GDR have not survived as a building system. For me, the 60s have a particular significance. I associate them with the inception of digitization for all planning processes in the construction industry, though it was still limited to alphanumerical tasks such as engineering-related calculations and invitations to tender, allocations and accounting.\n\nWhere will architecture be 60 years from now?\n\nIn terms of form and function, it will have continued its revolutionary course of development. According to a report from the UN, the building market is responsible for 38 % (!) of the worldâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions. Climate protection will lead to new, technology-driven, intelligent buildings, and new materials from climate-neutral manufacturing will be available. Architects will use AI-supported planning tools that give him extensive freedom in design. In addition, it will also offer support with dimensions, technical training and preparing cost estimates. They will carry the responsibility for applying their genius to creating a humane environment despite all the specifications.\n\nWhen did you first encounter Detail?\n\nMy firm is just two years younger than Detail. I was first interested in Detail as the son of an architect; later, it served as a textbook when we developed our CAD software known as Allplan. We used the high-quality magazine to test the functionality and integrity of our developments against the details in the publication. With the greatest respect, I would like to wish Detail another 60 successful years!"
