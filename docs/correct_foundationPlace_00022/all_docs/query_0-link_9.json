        "text": "The foundation is dedicated exclusively to charitable purposes, supporting projects in the areas of education, science and research, arts and culture, the environment, international understanding and social projects.\n\nThe foundation has received a donation consisting of funding in the form of cash and one million shares in Nemetschek AG from Prof. Georg Nemetschek and his son Dr. Ralf Nemetschek. The Nemetschek foundation will harness the proceeds of the original donation and dividend payments from the stock in order to pursue its charitable goals for the benefit of society.\n\nProfessor Nemetschek stated in his announcement: \"I believe that the notable economic success of the Nemetschek Corporation is due not only to our personal contributions but also, alongside the hard work and efficiency of our employees, to the political and social environment in the Federal Republic of Germany. The unique historical environment of postwar Germany was conducive to entrepreneurial initiative and remains so today\". The Nemetschek family accordingly believes that the free, democratic structure of Germany must be buttressed and enhanced by socially responsible and beneficial actions generated by responsible initiatives involving fortunes built in this country.\n\nDr. Ralf Nemetschek will assume the leadership of the foundation\"s affairs as Executive Director. Professor Nemetschek will chair the foundation board. The foundation has its headquarters in the Nemetschek building at Konrad-Zuse-Platz 1 in 81829 Munich."
