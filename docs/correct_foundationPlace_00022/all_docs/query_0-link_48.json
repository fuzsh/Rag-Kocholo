        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series. Before we dive into our discussion, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you share with us the backstory about what brought you to your specific career path?\n\nAs a child I wanted to work as a cashier in the supermarket (at that time the cashiers were typing all numbers), or as an architect. Throughout my career, I have worked with value creation in different industries with large corporations, and I also had my own interior design business. So I guess — although not strictly through my own planning — they have all been the seeds for me to now being the CFO of one of the world’s most successful software companies for the built world, with both architects and design creatives. A great combination of everything I like.\n\nMy path has not been straight in any way, but driven by my strong curiosity and my love of frequent new challenges, paired with studies and a combined major in international capital markets, with a focus in economics, and organizational management. I have taken the chances that have been given to me to combine these two perspectives in my professional roles, both the overarching structural perspective on how to create value with a business model, and how to build the right organizational structures.. I believe both are utterly important and I love the combination of the two.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career?\n\nWhat a difficult question! I truly believe that in leadership — especially when you are often taking on a new perspective in your role — there are interesting stories more or less daily. If one does not feel this, I think it is high time to change the role. And the unpredictability and continuous change is the best part of my role. I was a part of the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008 when I was a CFO for a financial services company in a country that was early and severely hit by the global financial crisis. And in the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, I had just changed my role, which presented a whole new set of challenges. Both of these situations showed me that there is always an opportunity in every situation, and what I believe Steve Jobs once said: “To be positive in a negative situation is not naïve, that’s leadership.” I totally agree, and the larger crises have definitely shown me that.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Do you have a story about how that was relevant in your life?\n\n“Everyone wants to be a diamond, but few are willing to be cut.” I believe this is such great food for thought in so many different situations, especially in our working lives, but also in self-development — something I believe is key in leadership. It doesn’t mean that something needs to be difficult to succeed, however it shows that we need to take different steps outside of our comfort zone in order to continuously develop our strengths and to shine.\n\nI never planned my career path, however I have always deliberately taken sometimes odd chances. At times, these decisions did not seem to be the easiest, but they represented something new, and therefore a new challenge in which I could grow. In any new solution, I always make sure that there is a new ingredient/aspect that could be a challenge for me. This has taken me places I could never have imagined, and I never get bored.\n\nIs there a particular book that made a significant impact on your leadership style? Can you share a story or an example of that?\n\nA mixture of so many, but one I believe had a simple way of very pragmatically explaining how to build a winning team is: It’s Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy by Captain Michael Abrashoff. It’s a story about the worst ship in the Navy that changed the way the team worked, the empowerment, responsibility, accountability, and mindset. For me, a strong team is making sure everyone feels in charge and takes responsibility for their work, and is proud and aware of their impact. Often, it is easier to delegate. The tasks get done, yet sometimes the team does not really feel accountable. Everybody needs to feel and see their impact, and that starts with commitment and trust from the leader. It also, however, requires willingness from the team members. Both have to be nurtured for success.\n\nWhat do you think makes your company stand out? Can you share a story?\n\nWhat sets our company apart is a combination of factors that have been essential to our success. Firstly, our rich heritage stems from the strong vision and determination of Professor Georg Nemetschek, our founder. His foresight has laid the foundation for our company’s enduring legacy of innovation and excellence, which started in 1963.\n\nMoreover, we have a presence across the entire value chain. Through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have seamlessly integrated diverse companies, allowing us to offer comprehensive solutions that meet our customers’ evolving needs. This approach sets us apart from our competitors and enables us to provide real value to our clients.\n\nAdditionally, our strong ties to academia and our deep understanding of customer needs further differentiate us in the market. By actively engaging with academic institutions, such as the Technical University Of Munich (TUM), and listening closely to our customers, we stay at the forefront of industry trends and developments. This ensures that our innovative solutions are tailored to address real-world challenges.\n\nYou are a successful business leader. Which three character traits do you think were most instrumental to your success? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nI believe leadership is very individual and always needs to be adapted to the current role at hand. It is a perennial task to develop and does not stand still. So for each role I have had, there have certainly been different traits that were important. But something that has always helped me is my curiosity and the fact that I have always taken much energy from self-reflection. If my curiosity had not had me constantly engaging in new business models and company history, I would probably not have jumped on so many different challenges that sometimes seemed very “far from home.” This includes changing my industry focus, new geographies and cultures that were a bit more different than the one I grew up in, e.g. my time in Russia and China, but these different experiences helped me learn the most both about myself and also on how to lead a business model and company towards continued success. These situations, and the quite intense amount of self-reflection that came with it as I was definitely struggling at times, showed me how I could develop further. The power of knowing that you have mastered something grew — and I had fun! Resilience is a strength built by doing. This goes both for us as individuals and equally for corporations.\n\nLeadership often entails making difficult decisions or hard choices between two apparently good paths. Can you share a story with us about a hard decision or choice you had to make as a leader?\n\nMany years ago, I read a terrific article where someone explained that when faced with a difficult choice, there is no such thing as finding the right answer, but rather, deciding on one route and then making everything on that route go as if it was the right decision. This has often helped me. Early in my career I decided to leave my job and my industry to start my own company with a friend. Many advised us not to do it as it seemed very risky to “jump off the train” of a good job. Others were highly appreciative of how thrilling it was of us having the courage to build our own company. There were so many times when I asked myself why on earth I took that step — it was my greatest challenge, but also the biggest reward. It was the best decision I have ever made. You learn a lot about yourself when you need to depend on yourself to be successful. I learned so much, and as odd as it might sound, it is probably the one choice I made that has actually helped me the most in my corporate career. And it enables me to take both perspectives, to act as an entrepreneur within a strong corporate framework while being in a corporate role — I love to combine the two perspectives. I believe it is important to remember that success is not something you have, success is something you have had or can have again — and for success to continue, we need to be bold enough to make decisions that, at times, seem difficult.\n\nOk, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. Most of our readers — in fact, most people — think they have a pretty good idea of what a C-Suite executive does. But in just a few words can you explain what a C-Level executive does that is different from the responsibilities of other leaders?\n\nThe one perspective, I’d say is the even broader and end-to-end perspective on things. Despite not knowing all the details, the C-level executive needs to be able to act, steer, and direct quickly on all topics, making sure that all the dots are connected. The other one thing I would mention is the need to always look two steps further ahead; the C-Level executive needs to act strongly as a pacemaker and to make sure that the organization is always prepared for the route it is taking.\n\nWhat are the “myths” that you would like to dispel about being a CEO or executive? Can you explain what you mean?\n\nThat the executive is the smartest person in the room — and needs to be. The C-Level task is to guide and direct, but together with the full team. It is true that one needs the experience in order to quickly grasp and be able to make decisions, however based on the work of the entire team. That is why it is so important to have strong experts below the C-level who have a clear perspective and can articulate to the C-level. That’s how a successful organization works — as a strong team where everyone knows and takes full responsibility for their respective role.\n\nWhat are the most common leadership mistakes you have seen C-Suite leaders make when they start leading a new team? What can be done to avoid those errors?\n\nDifficult to say as it is so individual and depends on the corporation and the situation. But perhaps to strive to want to be in control of everything, which is impossible. As a C-Suite leader, you need to be able to make decisions on non-complete data, you need to have the inner strength to act and decide by asking the right questions despite not being in control of all details. And probably — but there are very different views on this — to take too many people with you from your previous role to the new corporation. Part of being a leader is also to adapt and learn; if you continue to work only with the close team you have been working with in the last role, which would probably feel very comfortable, you do not need to adapt and develop as much. I believe this is a missed opportunity to grow as a leader if you do. And that, for me, is key — also for organizational growth.\n\nIn your experience, which aspect of running a company tends to be most underestimated? Can you explain or give an example?\n\nCourage and time. You need to be courageous. Your own willingness and the corporation’s appetite and ability to take risks will differ, however, you need to be courageous when running a company. It cannot always be done by the book, and you can never be in total harmony. Courageous decisions make a company grow, and you will often need to move forward even though you do not feel completely ready."
