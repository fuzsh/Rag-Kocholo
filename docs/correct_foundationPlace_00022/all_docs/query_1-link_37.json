        "text": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by private companies in Nemetschek indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nThe top 4 shareholders own 51% of the company\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Nemetschek SE ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that private companies own the lion's share in the company with 39% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nMeanwhile, institutions make up 25% of the company’s shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nemetschek.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nemetschek?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nemetschek. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Nemetschek's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNemetschek is not owned by hedge funds. Pro. Georg Nemetschek Foundation is currently the company's largest shareholder with 39% of shares outstanding. With 5.4% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Ralf Nemetschek and Nemetschek Foundation, Endowment Arm are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOn looking further, we found that 51% of the shares are owned by the top 4 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Nemetschek\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nWe can see that insiders own shares in Nemetschek SE. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €810m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 39%, of the Nemetschek stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find .\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
