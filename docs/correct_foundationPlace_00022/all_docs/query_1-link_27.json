        "text": "Providing AEC/O software solutions, the Nemetschek Group is a pioneer for digital transformation in the construction industry using Open BIM\n\nThe Nemetschek Group is a developer and vendor of AEC/O software for planners, general contractors, owners, architects, and engineers, covering the entire lifecycle of building and infrastructure projects, from the initial planning to the design, construction, and operational stages.\n\nFounded in 1963 by Professor Georg Nemetschek, the company is a pioneer of digital transformation for the AEC/O industry. The software solutions of the group’s thirteen brands increase the quality of the construction process and improve the digital workflows of all those involved by driving collaboration and enabling a seamless flow of data and information.\n\nThe Group has a strong focus on open standards and is a key driver of OPEN BIM workflows, as underlined by its active involvement in crucial industry associations such as buildingSMART.\n\nIn addition to its market leading position in the construction industry, the portfolio also includes digital solutions for visualization, 3D modeling, and animation, used by creative minds in the media and entertainment industry.\n\nLeveraging digital solutions\n\nRecent studies show that the construction industry is among the least digitised industries worldwide. At the same time, the complexity of construction projects is rapidly increasing and owners and general contractors alike are facing a growing number of challenges to build on time, within budget, in line with quality requirements – and ideally, sustainably. By leveraging the Nemetschek Group’s various digital solutions, buildings can be planned, built, and operated more efficiently, sustainably, and cost-effectively.\n\nThe Nemetschek Group employs more than 3,400 experts around the globe. Organized in four customer-oriented divisions (plan & design, build & construct, manage & operate, as well as media & entertainment), the company’s AEC/O software solutions are currently used by approximately six million users worldwide.\n\nSince its foundation over 50 years ago, the Nemetschek Group has been an advocate for seamless collaboration, connecting professions along the complete building life cycle and actively driving the creation, definition, and use of open standards (Open BIM).\n\nOften mistakenly considered as complex, the value for owners and general contractors is obvious:\n\nOnly open standards allow for a seamless end-to-end flow of BIM data, and\n\nOnly open standards guarantee that the best companies (rather than those using the right software programs) can be employed for every single step of the project.\n\nThe unique structure of the Nemetschek Group – the Nemetschek Ecosystem – enables the thirteen highly specialised brands to continue operating independently while at the same time remaining extremely close to their respective customer groups.\n\nAs one of PBC Today’s valued stakeholders, Nemetschek Group offers sector-leading insight into the AEC/O industry.\n\nYou can access stakeholder related news, reports and guides below.\n\nNemetschek brands:"
