The foundation's activities will focus on promoting competence and excellence in the construction industry in the areas of research, teaching, innovation, and academic life. In particular, the institution is intended to support the business location Germany in taking a leading role in the technologically, economically, and socially relevant future area of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is one of the essential pillars of the building industry of the future.\n\nTo provide the foundation with adequate financial resources, Prof. Nemetschek has transferred 350,000 privately held shares of Nemetschek SE to the foundation. The mandatory notification required by law (so-called directors' dealings) regarding this transaction and its publication by the company was made today.\n\nThe Nemetschek Innovation Foundation will financially support strategic and university research as well as research-oriented teaching and innovation. To ensure a solid supply of resources, it will finance endowed professorships and institutes at universities and colleges.\n\nProf. Nemetschek is one of the pioneers of the digital transformation of the AEC industry (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) worldwide. The Nemetschek Group, which he founded in 1963 and has been listed on the stock exchange since 1999, is today one of the leading international providers of software solutions for the industry, covering the entire life cycle of buildings.\n\n\"My professional life has always been characterized by the ambition to achieve technical progress for the benefit of people through creative and practice-oriented research and development in the field of designing, building, using and managing buildings\", says Prof. Nemetschek. \"The fact that I have succeeded in this not only as a scientist but also as an entrepreneur has prompted me to ensure the continuation of this important research activity through the Innovation Foundation. Moreover, it should be a matter of course in our country that wealthy people give back part of their assets to society.\n\nThe Nemetschek Innovation Foundation is already the third foundation of Prof. Nemetschek. The \"Professor Georg Nemetschek Foundation\" was established in 1996 for the benefit of the Faculty of Civil Engineering at Munich University of Applied Sciences. Among other things, the foundation made possible the establishment of the iabi Institute for Applied Building Information Technology.\n\nIn 2007, he and his family set up the \"Nemetschek Foundation\", also a non-profit organization, whose work contributes to democratic culture in Germany."
