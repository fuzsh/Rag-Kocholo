        "text": "Professor Georg Nemetschek, born in 1934, is the founder, majority shareholder and guiding spirit of the Nemetschek Group, one of the largest listed software companies in Germany.\n\nIn the late 1960s, anticipating change in the construction industry, he opted for software, played a personal role in major developments and still drives innovation and digitalization in the entire building sector with energy and action to this day, not only in the Group but also in the industry as a whole.\n\nIn addition, Professor Nemetschek dedicates a substantial part of his assets to non-profit purposes, e.g. within the scope of the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation .\n\nEarly fascination\n\nWhile studying civil engineering at the Technical University in Munich, Georg Nemetschek was already fascinated by the PERM, a tube computer built by Professors Piloty and Sauer and, along with Konrad Zuse’s Z1, a milestone in the history of computer technology.\n\nVision software\n\nGeorg Nemetschek’s passion for computers and software led him to take the risk of investing in the development of software as early as the 1960s – at a time when PCs did not yet exist. Success proved him right: in 1963, the freshly founded engineering firm for the construction industry was one of the first to use programs to calculate finite elements for highly loaded, irregularly supported slabs.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneur\n\nGeorg Nemetschek took the engineering office, founded in 1963, and evolved it into today’s Nemetschek Group, one of the leading providers of software solutions for the construction industry. As early as 1977, he was setting standards with the development of software for structural engineering. In 1999, followed the stock market listing and subsequent strong, profitable growth of the company, which today serves as an umbrella uniting four segments that cover the entire life cycle of a building with their software solutions. The founder continues to directly and immediately hold controlling interest and the majority of the voting rights of Nemetschek SE, which is listed on the MDax and TecDax.\n\nPromoting young talent\n\nIn 1971, Georg Nemetschek was appointed professor at the Munich University of Applied Sciences. He headed the Department of Civil Engineering/Steel Construction as Dean for many years and fulfilled this role until 1996, paying particular attention to the practical training of students. Thus, throughby means of endowments, he made sure that students always had access to the latest software and hardware.\n\nAwards\n\nAs a “visionary and successful entrepreneur in the development of information technology in the construction industry”, Professor Nemetschek receives the Konrad Zuse medal in 1997.\n\nIn recognition of his unique life’s work, Professor Nemetschek is awarded the Federal Cross of Merit in 2001.\n\nIn 2013, Professor Nemetschek is honored with the Konrad Zuse plaque for his achievements in the field of construction software and commitment to promoting young talent.\n\nIn 2014, Professor Nemetschek is inducted into the “Hall of Fame of IT\" of the magazine Computerwoche.\n\nFoundations"
