        "text": "This week I had the privilege to speak at the Digital Construction Week in London, to share our thoughts on #AI deployment in the #AECO industries. To deploy AI responsibly means adding a layer to protect the creative process, I want to stress that there won’t be AI without the human behind it. While we let AI enhance our work, it is essential for us as a software provider to ensure our users’ data and creative intellectual property is protected. Thank you Alasdair Reisner for hosting the panel, and thank you Pierre Saunal, Sarah Rock, and Lee Morris for the interesting discussion and sharing your insights!
