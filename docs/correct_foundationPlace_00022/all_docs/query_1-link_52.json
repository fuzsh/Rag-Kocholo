        "text": "Tecklenburg succeeds in the digital transformation from a traditional construction company to a BIM specialist with software solutions from the Nemetschek Group. In a construction project put out for tender throughout Europe, Tecklenburg was able to prevail over all competitors thanks to its expertise, and implemented the project on time and within budget.\n\nTecklenburg is a sixth-generation building contractor, successful since its inception in 1878. Its fields of activity include public building projects such as police buildings or daycare centers, neighborhood developments, food markets, and private and terraced houses. The Tecklenburg Group acts as investor, project developer, and general contractor in construction projects. In addition to Managing Director Hermann Tecklenburg, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, coach of the national women’s soccer team, is also a shareholder of the Tecklenburg Group.\n\nAs Managing Director, Hermann Tecklenburg has always been innovative and willing to permanently develop the company. That is why he decided to introduce Building Information Modeling (BIM) three years ago. The goals were to accelerate planning phases, to be able to identify and correct errors in advance, and to work more efficiently. In addition, model-based working is a mandatory prerequisite for participating in tenders for public buildings. Ultimately, BIM makes a construction company more competitive.\n\nOne important decision was to specify the BIM tools to be used by external planners, architects, and construction companies. Those who want to be subcontracted by Tecklenburg must, for example, work with the Nemetschek brands Solibri and Allplan. However, the connection to other software solutions is possible thanks to OPEN BIM.\n\nRead the rest of Tackling Digital Transformation: German Contractor Tecklenburg Builds District Police Building in Record Time\n\nSustainable business and healthy ecosystems are the basis for healthy living. The construction industry is one of the most resource-intensive sectors of the economy. Demand for housing is also continuously increasing. Accordingly, the construction industry is challenged to use raw materials and energy more efficiently so that buildings can be designed, built, and operated more sustainably. These lighthouse projects from the Nemetschek Group show that sustainability and digitalization go hand-in-hand in the construction industry – from the initial design to the operation of the finished building.\n\nSustainability in the Middle of the City\n\nIn 2018, Lacaton & Vassal, together with Quartus Résidentiel and Habitat & Humanisme, were awarded the contract for the conversion of the Marcel Lelong building as part of the “Saint-Vincent-de-Paul” spatial planning concept in the heart of Paris. The project is scheduled for completion in 2024.\n\nRead the rest of Sustainable Design, Construction, and Management of Buildings\n\nSanjay Gangal interviews Tanja Kufner, Head of Startups & Venture Investments at the Nemetschek Group, and Artem Kuchukov, CEO and Co-Founder of KEWAZO\n\nTanja, the Nemetschek Group has recently invested in the German robotics startup KEWAZO. Why KEWAZO?\n\nTanja: Currently, all stakeholders in the construction industry are facing acute challenges: rising prices for raw materials, labor shortage, and a high pressure on productivity often result in cost overruns and low efficiency in construction projects. That’s where digital solutions come into play: We as the Nemetschek Group are one of the leading providers for software and in combination with KEWAZO’s robotic products that enable the automation and digitalization of the on-site material flow by combining robotics and data analytics, we can help customers worldwide to respond to these challenges.\n\nArtem, you are CEO and one of the Co-Founders of KEWAZO. Why did you found KEWAZO and what is its mission?\n\nRead the rest of Nemetschek Group and KEWAZO Discuss Digitalization of Construction Sites\n\nBridges connect places and people and ensure the smooth transport of goods. Their planning is complex – and urgently needs a digitalization boost. The Nemetschek Group provides an overview on the future of the planning and construction of bridges.\n\nBridges are an important part of our building culture. It is not only the safety and load-bearing capacity of bridges that is relevant, but also their design. There are creative approaches to designing the bridge form that address the forces in the structure in an architecturally exciting way. Bridges have always been a showcase for the art of engineering and are increasingly symbols of the future theme of sustainability, whether through optimized use of materials or the use of renewable raw materials. The overriding goal of bridge construction remains to improve transport logistics. The first bridges were built as early as the Neolithic Age. Today, bridges form the foundation of any modern transport infrastructure. The performance of the federal highway network in Germany, for example, is based on 39,500 bridges, with a total length of over 2,000 kilometers.\n\nRead the rest of A Digital Way to Building Bridges\n\nChoosing the “right” building materials is a powerful lever for more sustainability and a lower carbon footprint of buildings. These assessments require digital tools – and a digital way of thinking. The Nemetschek Group discusses how digital tools and OPEN BIM can make a difference.\n\nClimate change has been a key focus for the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AEC/O) industry for some time. However, recently released figures from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) send a stark warning: the industry is not on track to achieve its 2050 decarbonization targets. According to UNEP’s 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction, the sector still accounted for around 37% of energy and process-related CO2 emissions in 2021.\n\nIt’s clear that more needs to be done. While no single approach ensures total decarbonization, the environmental impacts of new construction projects need to be assessed at a very early stage in order to minimize the building’s carbon footprint across its entire life cycle. This requires a holistic data management across the whole building lifecycle. Choosing sustainable materials wherever possible is an excellent start. By assessing materials early in the planning process, more sustainable options can be specified which reduce the carbon emissions generated during manufacturing, construction, and operation. Typically, this is done using a life cycle assessment (LCA).\n\nRead the rest of Digital Tools for a More Sustainable Choice of Building Materials\n\nSanjay Gangal interviews Viktor Várkonyi, Member of the Executive Board and Chief Division Officer Planning & Design Division at the Nemetschek Group.\n\nViktor, Takenaka Corporation is working closely with Nemetschek. What is so special about this company?\n\nTakenaka Corporation is one of the largest general contractors in Japan. Since its founding in 1610, Takenaka has specialized in architecture & design. Today, they employ more than 2,400 architects. Takenaka Corporation has been committed to realizing customer dreams and shaping the world since their very beginnings, more than 400 years ago and they have participated in major projects that deeply affect Japan´s society, economy, and culture. Takenaka is following an Integrated Design-to-Build approach to create impressive buildings and structures across the globe.\n\nRead the rest of How Takenaka Corporation Embraces the OPEN BIM and Building Lifecycle Intelligence with Nemetschek Solutions\n\nSanjay Gangal interviews Tanja Kufner, Head of Startups & Venture Investments at the Nemetschek Group, and Sarah Crawley and John Ryan, co-founders of SymTerra.\n\nTanja, the Nemetschek Group has recently invested in the UK-based startup SymTerra. Why SymTerra?\n\nTanja: SymTerra offers a site communication platform that facilitates communication, collaboration, and visibility across the supply chain in construction. This enables different stakeholders to work closely – and better together. Investing in SymTerra perfectly aligns with our strategy of driving innovation and digitalization throughout the entire value chain of construction. I’m very happy that the investment in SymTerra will help stakeholders to achieve better project results, as the productivity of the construction industry grew by only one percent annually over the last 20 years. As a result, the industry lags far behind other sectors, not only in terms of digitalization, but also regarding efficiency. That’s where we see a perfect fit between our mission to drive efficiency and SymTerra’s solution.\n\nRead the rest of Nemetschek Group and SymTerra Discuss Driving Efficiency in Construction\n\nTwo megatrends are dominating the current discussion and both present major challenges and opportunities. Alongside digitalization, sustainability is right in the spotlight. Climate targets, circular economy, CO2 pricing, the use of the latest methods and processes – there are countless initiatives and measures across the construction industry to curb climate change and its consequences. Every single one of them is facing challenges. The good news is that significant improvements can be achieved with proven digital solutions. Across the entire life cycle, a building can be planned, built, and managed much more efficiently and thus more sustainably – cost savings included. The following cases demonstrate that sustainability and efficiency go hand in hand – when relying on the right software tools, such as the solutions from the Nemetschek Group\n\nRead the rest of Plan, Build, and Operate More Efficiently and Sustainably with Software Solutions from the Nemetschek Group\n\nThe construction industry is one of the world’s biggest emitters of CO2. Of all materials used in construction, 10% are unnecessary or are wasted, and 30% of all construction work is spent fixing errors. Also, 90% of all large construction projects overrun in terms of time or cost. Why is that the case? One of the most important reasons is the urgent need to catch up in terms of digitalization. The Nemetschek Group is driving innovation with their software solutions, combining it with investments in entrepreneurship and young, successful startups.\n\nDriving Innovation within the Construction industry\n\nEven in the planning and construction process, efficiency and sustainability could – and must – be significantly increased through comprehensive digitalization. Fortunately, a rethink is currently taking place among many stakeholders in the construction lifecycle – driven by an innovative, disruptive start-up industry that is providing countless creative ideas for more sustainable construction. The number of startups in the construction industry developing digital solutions to better connect machines, building materials, and people is growing steadily. In addition to know-how and entrepreneurship, these young entrepreneurs bring one crucial quality to the table: the power of persuasion to inspire the rather traditional, conservative, and fragmented construction industry to embrace their solutions. For example, Madaster, based in the Netherlands and Berlin, managed in a very short time to win 33 well-known German companies as supporters for its new online materials register. With Madaster, every registered building receives a so-called material passport, on which the amount of material, reuse potential, material value and the current residual raw material value are shown. This is a highly recent issue; for instance, the German government is planning the introduction of a digital building resource passport. This is also intended to promote a circular economy in the building sector. Madaster has its finger on the pulse here.\n\nRead the rest of Shaping the World together: Innovative Startups and the Nemetschek Group"
