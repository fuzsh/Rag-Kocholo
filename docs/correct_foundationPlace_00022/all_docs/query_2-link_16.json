        "text": "Extending across 12 hectares across CBD land, the project is easily the largest district development in the southern hemisphere - and one of the biggest builds ever attempted in Queensland. Faced with immense scale, extreme complexity and near-unfathomable levels of information - the team at one of the world’s largest construction projects is using software solutions from the Nemetschek Group to succeed.\n\nBrisbane is Australia’s third largest city; a thriving business hub that grew from an initial European settlement at Queen’s Wharf in the early 1800s. Now, that historic site is being carefully restored and reimagined in an effort to attract more than 1.5 million extra tourists to the city and create over 8,000 jobs. Led by the Destination Brisbane Consortium, the AUD $3.6BN megaproject will see the construction of four new towers and the restoration of several heritage buildings. Once complete, the new Queen’s Wharf district will offer hotels, apartments, 12 football pitches worth of public space and a new physical link across the river.\n\nBuilding a new district of this scale - and all next to a river in a historic city center - is extremely complex. Rising to the challenge, the project team, led by lead architect Cottee Parker, has embraced digital collaboration to plan and coordinate their vast amounts of design data - working in an information modelling environment and employing 16 different software tools across 39 contributing companies; from architects and engineers to contractors and suppliers.Information modelling allows the team to clearly organize all of the project’s key information in an easy-to-access, central place. It’s where the 3D-models, data and specifications are all kept and coordinated by the team. The approach improves efficiency, dramatically increases people’s understanding of the proposals and cuts waste.\n\nAt Queen’s Wharf, digital engineering specialist DBM Vircon, responsible for the project management of the overall construction project, has over 340 models under management and is processing 215 individual models each week. The owner, Destination Brisbane Consortium, ensured Queen's Wharf development leveraged the vendor-independent Open BIM approach, allowing all parties to work with the tools they prefer. Gabor Gulyas, project lead and operations manager for digital engineering at DBM Vircon, explains that “interoperability and a consistent Open BIM workflow are essential for this project. There is no way around it, if you keep in mind that up to 300 people are working on the design models at the same time in peak periods, coordinating over 200 different models.”\n\nTeam working at the design stage was enabled by Graphisoft’s Archicad. Following Integrated Design principles, architects and engineers were able to review and check the same models in real time - understanding each others’ intentions and picking up errors before they occurred on site. The tool’s “Open BIM” compatibility meant that any models could be brought in and coordinated in Archicad, even if they weren’t produced in the software - breaking down barriers and improving team working. On any construction site, time means money, and when part of a building can’t be built because of a lack of clear design information or worse, gets built wrong, the impact can be huge.\n\nTo avoid such circumstances on a project as big and complex as Queen’s Wharf, the team used Solibri to check design information for errors before it was issued to the contractors on site. The approach de-risked a critical step, saving the time and money that can be lost when errors occur on site. Aside from ensuring information is correct, just finding and getting access to what you need on a project of this scale can be challenging, especially once on site, and giving everyone a level playing field to find and open what they need - regardless of how digitally savvy they are - is fundamental."
