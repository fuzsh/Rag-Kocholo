        "text": "A high-priesthood of financial elite holds the keys to the operating system of an economy showing signs of terminal dysfunctioning. In this context, commons-oriented network collectives, values and practices are gaining traction. Movements like free/open source software or p2p collaborative economy represent a cultural shift towards a more sustainable, egalitarian future. Can cryptoeconomics and blockchain technologies facilitate the transition from surveillance capitalism and data extractivism to common-based social architecture? This course will focus on critical and creative engagements with the building and scaling up of alternative visions and infrastructures. On the menu: data sovereignty, platform cooperativism, Universal Basic Income (or better, basic equity!); cosmo-financial practices and values to processually and ecologically integrate the externalities presiding to current capital formation; critical questioning of key cryptoeconomics concepts and their relation to the legacy of neoliberalism; etc. “They’re building something in there, something down there. Mutual debt, debt unpayable, debt unbounded, debt unconsolidated…” (The Undercommons).\n\nErik Bordeleau (PhD, Université de Montréal) is researcher at the SenseLab (Concordia University, Montreal) and fugitive financial designer at the Economic Space Agency (ECSA). He is also affiliated to the research group HAR (Histoire des arts et des representations - Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La défense) and co-founder of the collectives Entrepreneurs du commun and Econautic Consultancy. His work articulates at the intersection of political philosophy, media and financial theory, contemporary art and cinema studies, with a marked interest for the speculative turn and the renewal of the question of the possible in contemporary thinking.\n\nThe School of Disobedience is an experimental format to test new ways of independent knowledge production in the 21st century. The inspiration is the spirit of Berlin, the city as an image for this time and this world, heterogeneous, international and politicized. The goal of the School of Disobedience is to concentrate this potential of the city and put it to use for working on a common future. The combination of humanistic and technological perspectives should help to support specific projects which are based on a progressive view of society and will further our sense of justice.\n\nLaunched in fall 2018 and continuing into 2019, the School of Disobedience will work in the Grünen Salon with a set of events to test formats and content of the para-academic practice. There will be seminars open for anybody interested in the connection of academic and activist thinking and working, a lab for technologists and theoreticians, a makerspace for people with experiences in different areas, from law to coding, from NGO to academia. Each month, a different academic expert leads a seminar on his or her research and invites people of all ages, professions and experience to join as its students. There will also be monthly public evening events in the evenings, which will allow the general audience an insight into that month’s issue in focus.\n\nThe School of Disobedience is supported by the Nemetschek Foundation."
