        "text": "192 Used software: Scia Engineer Client The City Rüsselsheim is best known in connection with the automotive industry. The production of Opel was situated here originally. Now it has about 60.000 residents and many other famous car manufactures such as Hyundai, Kia, Saab and recently Chevrolet are developing their models here. The Order In 2007 the Square near the Rüsselsheim Train Station was renovated. The four parts of the tree edges sails protecting pedestrians from the sun have been planned by the office of Architect O. Feuerabend and will only be used during the summer time. The problem was to find enough place and the right position for the foundations as the network of pipelines in the underground was very dense. To solve the problem a foundation with tension piles was suggested. Technical data The structure consists of four sails with edge lengths between 8.0 m and 15.0 m. The sails are tightened between five guyed steel masts by means of adjustable tension steel bars. The mast lengths are about 3.5 m, 4.2 m and 6.0 m and the material of the sails is of the Ferrari 502 type. A block foundation with tension piles was used by all bearing points and it follows the ground inclination of the area. Software and Model Scia Engineer was chosen to do the general 3D-Modelling. The sails were defined as plates with membrane properties, the edge bars as cables and the tension bars were prestressed, so that the deflection under the dead load and the bars forces in system could be optimized. The foundation was modelled as ‘elastic supported 2D-plates’ with tension piles as anchors. For the further elevations of the system, grid meshes according to the joint points were created. DIN 4112 Flying Buildings was used for the wind loads. Separate 1D/2D models were created to calculate and optimize the connection details between the sail and the masts. Calculation steps The design and optimisation of the steel and sail structure was verified according to the third order theory. The foundation was designed according to the Dipl.-Ing.

CAE Special Projects 5 Shadow sail structure covering the square before the railway station Rüsselsheim The Square in front of the Rüsselsheim Train Station was renovated in 2007. In addition to this renovation was concepted a shadow sail construction for the pedestrian aria of the square. The sails are going to be used only in the summer to protect the visitors against the sun. The spanning of the square will be done in four parts; each part will be spanned with a three edged sail. To solve the problem of the limited ground area a foundation with tension piles had to be designed. For the 3D-Modelling with calculations Scia Engineer software was used. A separate 1D/2D parts model was created to calculate and optimize the connection details between the sails and the masts. The foundation drawing, detailed production drawing for the connections including 3D-PDF model have been done with the Scia Engineer construction drawing tool.
