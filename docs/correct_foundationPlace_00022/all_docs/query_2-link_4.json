        "text": "A look at the shareholders of Nemetschek SE (ETR:NEM) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that company controlled foundation own the lion's share in the company with 43% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nClearly, company controlled foundation benefitted the most after the company's market cap rose by €362m last week.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nemetschek.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Nemetschek\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nemetschek?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Nemetschek does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Nemetschek's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nemetschek. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Nemetschek Foundation, Endowment Arm with 43% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 4.0% and 3.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Georg Nemetschek, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman Emeritus.\n\nTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Nemetschek\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in Nemetschek SE. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own €196m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 6.7%, of the Nemetschek stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nemetschek better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
