        "text": "MUSEUM OF BATTLE AND CEMETERY - Tutrakan, Bulgaria 📍 wow, what a beautiful #shape 😍 The museum boasts an appealing, interactive, and versatile #design. Its main highlight is the round hall diorama, measuring 18 m in diameter and 8 m in height. This space is dedicated to captivating video and hologram presentations, incorporating elements like shooting, bombs, and voices. The #building itself features a triangular shape, with half of it located underground and a partial second floor housing technical offices. 👏 #usercontest #scia #concrete #steel #bim #innovation #construction\n\nSUPERMARKET CAMPING ‘LES SABLONS’ - Portiragnes, France 📍 The #building is a supermarket of 720 m² for the Camping « Les Sablons » and consists of the following four parts: sales areas, bakery, storage and offices. This #construction is at only 220 m of the Mediterranean Sea and had to fit into the landscape. Despite a large #surface, the building therefore has the smallest possible height (4,5 m). The specific part of this project is the tight deadline. While not all companies were known yet, the first results of the #analysis were awaited in a few days to allow the construction of the #foundations. In order to meet the deadlines of constructions, the studies (#calculations and #drawing) had to be finished for the most part in two weeks for the #structure. ⏱ 🚀 😍\n\nTIMBER CONCRETE COMPOSITE BICYCLE BRIDGE - Brussels, Belgium 📍 The architects chose a #timber #bridge to harmonize with the natural surroundings, protecting the timber with a #concrete slab for #durability. With a single span of 28.4 m, the bridge is supported on both ends. The concrete #slab is 0.26 m high, while the glued #glulam #beams are 1.2 m high. The deck width is 6 m, with each glulam beam measuring 2.5 m in width. Challenges arose due to the lack of regulations for timber concrete composite bridges, considering factors like #stiffness of connections, time-dependent behavior, and internal stresses from temperature variation. Amazing Project! Arcadis 😍\n\nFOOTBRIDGE OF LA GLACERIE - Montluçon, France📍 The #footbridge of La Glacerie is a #bridge that spans the Cher River and is located in the town of Montluçon, connecting the West and North parts of the city. The dimensions of the 64 x 3 m footbridge make this #aluminum crossing #structure of 64 m between supports one of the largest of Europe. The supporting structure of the footbridge is made of aluminium lattice #framework in the WARREN truss configuration and is supported on reinforced #concrete headers. These headers are founded by deep #foundations, which provide the necessary support for the gangway structure. The use of aluminium for the lattice framework provides a lightweight and durable solution for the gangway, while the reinforced concrete headers and deep foundations ensure the necessary #stability and #strength to support pedestrian traffic. We ❤️ this bridge!\n\nCANOPY ENTRANCE ‘GASTHUISBERG’ - Leuven, Belgium 📍 The fully glazed #steel canopy visually connects different levels and features long #columns that extend to the lower levels. Steel is used for the #stairs, #bridges, and #canopy #structure. Glass #elevators in the circulation void enhance the play of lightand shadow, drawing attention upward. The force effects were initially estimated using elastic linear #calculations. Subsequently, EEM calculations were employed to investigate instability phenomena. Stresses were verified through second-order calculations, considering form errors in the characteristic instability shapes. Such a great #project 😍\n\nDo you know about the SCIA student contest? 🤔 Are you currently working on a project with SCIA Engineer for your studies? Then use the project to take part in our student contest. This gives you the chance to win international attention and prize money. 🤑 👏 That sounds good, doesn't it? You can get more information and take part directly here: https://lnkd.in/gVYBj72b #student #scia #contest #engenieering #university #learning #prize #enigneer #project\n\nWE CAN DANCE STAGE FESTIVAL 🎶 - Zeebrugge, Belgium 📍 A beach cover structure was built using standard sea containers loaded with concrete blocks as walls and base construction. The roof was clad with plastic ozone-resistant film on curved beams. Located on a beach, the construction faced high wind pressure on the open side. SCIA Engineer was used to calculate wind speeds and determine stability. The software also aided in analyzing material tensions, deformations, and cost estimations. By using uniform profiles, the engineering process was streamlined, reducing costs while ensuring structural integrity and safety. 😎 💃 #engineering #engineer #steel #bim #structure #festival #construction"
