        "text": "As for sustainability, we implement systems to monitor energy consumption by occupant or unit and provide data insights that lead to better building performance. These technologies also meet tenant expectations for conservation: An EY survey found that post-pandemic, nearly half of people plan to prioritize the environment and climate change in how they live and the products they buy; for 26 percent, sustainability will be their most important purchase criteria three years from now. Moreover, our emphasis on green technology helps meet the goals of investors and occupiers dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates.\n\nSustainability is also tied to livability and well-being. Residential and commercial occupants want spaces where they can thrive, whether it’s better lighting and air quality, or a clearer understanding of their carbon footprint. Healthier, more eco-friendly environments are in the spotlight post-pandemic: 57 percent of consumers say they want to make healthier choices in their product purchases in the longer term, according to the survey by EY consulting. Some 43 percent say health or “what’s good for me” will be the most important purchase criteria for them three years from now. Technology also helps us deliver the same high-tech experiences in the built environment that occupants enjoy in other aspects of their lives. We invest in innovations that maximize space utility, simplify guest access, automate the reservation and use of amenities, help occupants communicate with neighbors, and control appliances, lighting and thermostats – among others. Such features distinguish our buildings from a tenant standpoint, which ultimately drives performance of the asset in the market.\n\nFinally, technology enhances our asset management, corporate processes, and organizational structure. We use building management technology to provide real-time visibility into the critical infrastructure in our properties. We can spot and address performance issues more quickly and collect an array of data to produce actionable insights. Software improves transparency in our asset management and streamlines and optimizes our corporate processes. This yields higher internal productivity from our teams, as well as better internal financial controls and investor relations. Finally, our technology philosophy drives our organizational structure. We modeled our firm after agile software developers, with flat teams that facilitate the free flow of information and expertise to propel productivity. As tech founder and author Chris Clearfield noted, “…today more than ever, there is a recognition that leading with technology requires a critical focus on people and processes, not just the technology itself.”\n\nMeanwhile, technology can be hugely expensive. Presidio Bay has been adopting models that allow us to absorb costs by amortizing them over a much longer period of time. This means we can capture the value of the solution and pass on the costs to tenants over years, creating a win-win for everyone. It helps that we are long-term holders of the assets we build. Other developers may be loath to take a risk on technology that increases asset values beyond their ownership lifecycle; and multiple stakeholders can thwart investment momentum.\n\nFinally, developers have finite windows of time to make long-lasting decisions. Once the ball is moving – the design is set, the project is in planning, entitlement and pre-construction – the built environment is not very malleable. There is a point in a project lifecycle at which it becomes much more difficult to implement technology. Very early on, we try to be as thoughtful as possible and make key decisions around what areas to integrate tech products, what providers are servicing these project areas, how early they can be brought into the process, and, most importantly, whether we can work together to develop mutually acceptable solutions.\n\nFortunately, our deep involvement in PropTech investment gives us insight into the landscape of innovation, and we work to design flexibility whenever possible into our processes. “Emerging technologies may sometimes seem a long way off … but they all have the potential to increase the spectrum of risks for property owners,” a KPMG report noted. “It is critical that the industry carefully considers both the direct and indirect potential impacts of these and builds flexibility into both their buildings and businesses, in order to react quickly as they materialize. … When you consider the lifespan of buildings, and the lead time for new developments and changes to existing plans, it is vital that property players take long-term changes and trends into account when making decisions – black swan events can often be predictable if you know where to look.”\n\nTo understand how Presidio Bay Ventures engages with startups, it’s worth examining one of our success stories. We invested early in Latch, a maker of smart locks and building-management software. The company’s operating system provides a seamless, intuitive and mobile-first access control that moves away from the traditional key but maintains security and peace of mind for the owner-operator. With Latch, residents use a smartphone, code, or physical key to unlock their door, and can text a temporary code to provide entry to dog walkers, maintenance workers and other visitors. For added security, the Latch locks are also equipped with a discreet security camera feature. Device fleet management and activity monitoring is entirely cloud-based and accessible by tenants, staff and service providers at various permission settings, giving our team an efficient tool to manage access control while eliminating significant challenges associated with tenant turnover and multi-visitor environments that we frequently encounter in our multifamily assets.\n\nFrom start to finish, we enjoyed a close relationship and direct line of communication with the founding team, which was critical to the success of our implementation. Latch provided a smooth onboarding experience in terms of identifying which of their products best fit our development. We integrated Latch into our construction costs early on by introducing the firm to our architects, door hardware suppliers, and general contracting teams. We made sure that the products we were expecting were included in our construction drawings so that when they were ordered, we knew who needed to receive them. Rather than trying to compete with door frames and hardware subcontractors directly, Latch did an excellent job correctly identifying the right channel partners in their customer markets, so our general contractor was aware of precisely where the products would be sourced from, which subcontractors would receive the products, when they would be on the site, and when they would get installed. As issues arose, we were able to have collaborative conversations with Latch, the channel partner and subcontractor that were key to resolving coordination, installation, and repair issues.\n\nIn 2021, Tishman Speyer Properties took Latch public by merging it with a SPAC, TS Innovations Acquisitions Corp., raising $453 million from the public offering (NASDAQ: LTCH). With this new round of funding, we expect to see a wide range of new products introduced and these products rolled out at scale by some of the industry’s largest developers.\n\nBUILDING OPERATIONS\n\nRise Buildings\n\nRise Buildings is a mobile app provider that integrates multiple real estate systems to enhance the tenant experience and integrate it with property operations. For example, the platform integrates directly with in-place property management, access control, and sensor systems, as well as amenities and elevators. Rise solutions include access and visitor management, health and safety, property operations, and tenant experience. The platform provides a single place for Springline tenants to open doors, pay rent, reserve amenities, receive building news, and communicate with neighbors. Rise also provides data that enables actionable insights. Through Rise, we will have a better understanding of where and when certain areas of Springline are being populated or visited, potentially informing decisions about their use, such as on how retail space is curated.\n\nEnertiv\n\nEnertiv is a connected SaaS platform that brings together modern software tools to digitize operations and provide real-time visibility into the performance of critical infrastructure. Through constant monitoring, Enertiv can sense performance issues such as leaks in a building and notify property management staff. The system provides better transparency into maintenance, energy efficiency, capital planning, tenant billing, the indoor environment, and more. Enertiv can break down energy consumption and utility consumption by tenant or unit, and provide data insights that lead to more efficient building performance and better tenant experiences. The platform has been shown to increase net operating income while delivering a payback period of under a year. Enertiv will be crucial to solving the challenges around data collection with regards to ESG targets for both the building and tenants.\n\nSavioke & Knightscope\n\nSpringline will be one of the communities to employ the use of autonomous robots to deliver everything from take-out to contracts, lattes to flowers while also managing on-site physical security. Savioke’s Relay system has a lockable payload with trackable navigation to ensure packages are delivered safely and securely while they seamlessly navigate elevators and multiple floor layouts. Relay will allow Springline to deliver unparalleled convenience and engagement with our tenants. Meanwhile, Knightscope provides a range of autonomous security robots (ASRs) that offer security patrols as well as a physical presence that deliver real-time, actionable intelligence anytime and anywhere, giving our security team the ability to detect and react faster to incidents occurring across the expansive 6.4-acre site.\n\nBbot\n\nBbot is a restaurant and hospitality tech startup dedicated to simplifying and improving the ordering and payments process. Bbot offers a configurable solution for restaurants, bars, hotels, cinemas, and other hospitality organizations to create digital menus and provide guest-controlled, contactless ordering, and payment. At Springline, we will be utilizing Bbot and integrating it within our Rise Buildings application to provide a one-stop solution for our tenants who wish to order from one of the many food and beverage purveyors on site.\n\nTENANT EXPERIENCE\n\nIOTAS\n\nIOTAS provides smart home technology for our multifamily residences. The IOTAS app provides one-touch and voice access to smart lights, locks, plugs, shades, thermostatic control, and more, along with options to set personalized home automations according to preferences. The app has been shown to increase rents, lower turnover, reduce maintenance cost, improve energy efficiency, and speed lease-up time.\n\nRhino\n\nSpringline will be partnering with Rhino to provide a deposit-free experience to renters of multifamily units at the project. Rhino will significantly reduce the friction and inefficiency typically associated with an upfront deposit by allowing the tenant to pay a small monthly fee as an insurance premium. This will provide sufficient security to Springline in the event of damage or repairs upon unit turnover.\n\nFernish\n\nFernish provides a unique ‘rent-to-own’ model for one of the biggest financial and logistical pain points to relocating: furniture. Fernish has partnered with some of the top brands in designer furniture to more efficiently serve the majority of urban professionals who move, on average, at least once every 18 months. Changing tastes, home layouts and budgets have led to the rise of ‘fast furniture’: inexpensive, yet poorly designed and manufactured items that have resulted in skyrocketing waste in the industry. With Fernish, consumers can turn an upfront $5,000+ investment into a more manageable and flexible monthly rental solution, complete with turnkey delivery and installation. Customers can choose from a variety of rental durations and even have a ‘buy-it-now’ option at any point. If they wish to return the furniture or exchange for a different item, Fernish’s proprietary reverse-supply chain has been carefully designed to maximize the useful life and monetization of each piece of furniture. At Springline, we believe Fernish will help remove the friction of moving into the project while providing a more hassle-free living experience for our tenants.\n\nOri\n\nOri is a modular furniture company started by veterans of MIT Media Lab. The firm builds innovative, multifunctional, robotic-powered, smart space solutions that allow residents to effortlessly expand their living space. Tenants can conceal a bed during the workday, reveal a closet or a home office on demand, or easily divide their space at the touch of a button, a tap of a mobile app, or by voice command. Ori enables one-bedroom units to function as a one-and-half bedroom, almost a two-bedroom, and helps reduce the attrition rate of residents who outgrow their space. We will be deploying Ori’s pocket office and cloud bed solutions in almost one-third of our units (primarily junior one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms) to maximize the utility of these units to renters.\n\nBlueport\n\nBlueport provides managed technology solutions that enable tenants to connect effortlessly to the internet and power IoT devices, providing seamless connectivity across the entire 6.4-acre property. The firm custom designs, installs, and supports wired and wireless internet systems, with best-in-class equipment to ensure reliability and performance. Springline residents will have a single network offering turnkey connectivity for all their devices, without having to engage their own internet service providers.\n\nWELLNESS\n\nWELL v2 Compliance (Powered by Rise & Enertiv)\n\nLeveraging Enertiv’s existing integration with best-in-class air quality monitoring sensors, Springline will maintain 24/7 achievement of the WELL v2 (A01 Air Quality) standards for air quality. Our system takes into account building-wide levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 orPM10), VOC testing (formaldehyde, benzine, toluene), ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, radon, and nitrogen dioxide. By creating an integration between Rise and Enertiv, Springline will be able to display this data in real-time to tenants on the building application.\n\nR-Zero Sanitization\n\nR-Zero is a biosafety company that designs affordable, sustainable solutions built on a platform of IoT connected devices, revolutionizing disinfection with hardware and software technology. Products include Arc, a hospital-grade disinfectant for surfaces and air, using UV-C light rather than harmful chemicals. Disinfection can be accomplished in two minutes per room. The IoT platform delivers real-time data to the R-Zero Dashboard, so the process is visible and can be tracked, and cleaning protocols made more efficient and effective over time. R-zero recently acquired CoWorkr, a company that delivers and manages room-occupancy sensors, so that it can combine real-time data on human activity within a building with management’s cleaning and sanitization protocols. This saves time and optimizes for areas that need more sanitization, at minimal disruption to the tenant experience.\n\nNeedlepoint Ionization\n\nNeedlepoint Ionization GPS-iMOD units are installed into each rooftop air handling unit at Springline. GPS’s needlepoint bipolar ionization technology generates ions that are distributed into the air circulated in occupied spaces. These ions seek out and form bonds with particles in the air, such as dust, dander, smoke and even viruses, through a process called agglomeration. This creates a snowball effect in which particles begin to cluster together. The larger a cluster of particles becomes, the easier it is for Springline’s HVAC system to filter it out of the air.\n\nSanuvox BioWall\n\nThe Sanuvox BioWall UVC air disinfection system is installed in the return and supply ducting of Springline’s HVAC system to disinfect airborne mold, virus, bacteria, and carbon-based odors. The system consists of five lamps, each secured in their own parabolic aluminum reflector for maximum UVC intensity. In addition, the BioWall is installed parallel to airflow to achieve the maximum amount of contact time with airborne contaminants. This compliments our filtration and needlepoint ionization system by disinfecting any particles that are not captured by the filter."
