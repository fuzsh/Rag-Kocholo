        "text": "October 3, 2012\n\nSessions Provide 4 AIA/CES/HSW or LA CES PDH and Offer Skills Needed to Adopt BIM Workflows\n\nColumbia, Md. (Oct. 3, 2012) – Nemetschek Vectorworks, Inc. will host a series of BIM Camps this November to help architects and designers learn the skills they need to adopt Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows. Sessions offer attendees the opportunity to earn four continuing education units, and are scheduled for New York City and San Francisco, with more on the way.\n\n“There is no question that open standards-based BIM is the way the world is moving,” says Deke Smith, FAIA, Executive Director of the Building Seismic Safety Council and buildingSMART allianceTM. “Getting a good understanding of how to use IFC-based BIM [Industry Foundation Class – ISO 16739] will give designers a leg up on the competition.”\n\nBIM Camp attendees will learn the skills they need to successfully implement BIM workflows into their practices, better understand how IFC-based standards benefit design teams, create sustainable and high-performing designs and collaborate through Open BIM. Attendees also receive a BIM Survival Kit, loaded with presentation materials and other resources.\n\nThe concepts taught at both locations will be identical and include:\n\nEquip Yourself – What is BIM?\n\nWhere am I on the BIM Path?\n\nBig BIM: Description and Case Study\n\nSmall Green BIM\n\nLegal Issues in BIM\n\nSite Planning Workflows with BIM\n\nPlugging Structural Analysis and Design into the BIM Workflow\n\nThe following organizations are sponsoring or participating in the BIM Camps: buildingSMART alliance; buildingSMART alliance Interest Group NYC; François Lévy Architect; Novedge; Nemetschek Scia; Severson & Werson, A Professional Corporation; and Zetlin & De Chiara LLP.\n\nThe first BIM Camp takes place on Thursday, November 1, in New York City, from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m., and a second session will be offered in San Francisco on Friday, November 9, from 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Times listed are local times, and additional networking events are planned around each BIM Camp.\n\nThe cost to attend a BIM Camp is $25 per person for AIA members, Vectorworks Service Select members and students. The fee for non-members/non-students is $40 per person. Registrants can save 10 percent by signing up before October 12, 2012. Visit www.vectorworks.net/eastBIMcamp or www.vectorworks.net/westBIMcamp to learn more or to register for the BIM Camp in New York or San Francisco, respectively. Registration fees will fund the Vectorworks Young Architects Student Scholarship Program (http://www.vectorworks.net/scholarship/) to be awarded later this year.\n\nFor more information about BIM Camps, email BIMcamp@vectorworks.net or call 888-646-4223.\n\nVisit http://www.vectorworks.net/openbim to learn more about Open BIM, an initiative of buildingSMART International and several leading software vendors using the open buildingSMART Data Model, and whose supporters include software vendors such as Nemetschek Vectorworks, AEC practices (designers, engineers and constructors), as well as building owners.\n\nAbout Nemetschek Vectorworks, Inc.\n\nNemetschek Vectorworks, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nemetschek Group and has been developing software since 1985.
