        "text": "Key Insights\n\nSignificant control over Nemetschek by private companies implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions\n\nThe top 4 shareholders own 51% of the company\n\nInstitutions own 24% of Nemetschek\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Nemetschek SE (ETR:NEM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 39% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAs a result, private companies were the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s 4.2% gain.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nemetschek.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Nemetschek\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nemetschek?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nemetschek. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Nemetschek, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Nemetschek. Pro. Georg Nemetschek Foundation is currently the company's largest shareholder with 39% of shares outstanding. With 5.4% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Ralf Nemetschek and Nemetschek Foundation, Endowment Arm are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOur research also brought to light the fact that roughly 51% of the company is controlled by the top 4 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Nemetschek\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in Nemetschek SE. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth €853m. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Nemetschek. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 39%, of the Nemetschek stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
