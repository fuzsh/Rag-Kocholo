        "text": "At this month’s Georgia Highlands College (GHC) Foundation Camp, groups of boys ages 10 to 12 were able to experience new adventures on and off campus.\n\n“Providing off-campus activities is instrumental in the development of each camper, by enriching their awareness,” GHC’s GHAME Coordinator and Brother 2 Brother Assistant Director Evan Snelling said.\n\nActivities included a trip to the Rome-Floyd E.C.O. Center – a joint department of the City of Rome and Floyd County that exists to provide natural resource education. Here, campers learned first-hand about the ecology of Northwest Georgia by viewing 25 live animal exhibits of reptiles, amphibians, fish and lizards native to the region while getting hands on with wildlife such as snakes and a small alligator.\n\nFor a chance to see some wildlife in action, campers went for a ride on the Sulzbacher Roman Holiday, Rome’s 40-passenger excursion boat.\n\nCampers also were able to learn about local industry – and an essential skill – by visiting Pirelli Tires for a tour of the facility.\n\n“Pirelli was added to the schedule to ensure all campers were taught how to change a tire and broaden their views on career possibilities,” Snelling said.\n\nBack on the Floyd campus, campers were able to enjoy some traditional activities like tug-of-war, flag football, kayaking and canoeing while also participating in a small-scale film production with GHC film instructor and School of Humanities Division Chair Seth Ingram.\n\nAt the end of the week, an awards ceremony was held to recognize several campers who made an impression through athletics, academics and their growth as campers.\n\n“We present an assortment of awards such as kayak and canoeing award, to a film award, to a brotherhood award for the campers who show the most concern and commitment to other campers’ well-being,” Snelling said. “We give awards to demonstrate what they are doing and being taught is more important than having fun and socializing.”\n\nDuring this year’s Foundation Camp at Georgia Highlands College (GHC), student counselors were given an opportunity to help enrich the lives of young attendees while also getting to enjoy a little childhood nostalgia.\n\nFor example, student and counselor David Smith said his experience at the camp reaffirmed his passion for education and desire to help young people achieve success. Smith, who is a resident of Rome and is majoring in education, said while the camp offers fun activities such as canoeing and sports, it also utilizes the setting of a college campus, allowing students to learn more about Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through hands-on activities.\n\nIn addition, counselors and other volunteers work with campers to provide valuable guidance and advice on topics such as anger management, avoiding drugs and the importance of making a good first impression.\n\n“One of our activities teaches young men how to become gentlemen and do things you have to do in the real world – like how to tie a tie, shake hands, make eye contact and basically how to make a good first impression,” Smith said. “We teach them this because a first impression could be the last thing someone remembers after they’ve met you.”\n\nCurrently enrolled in GHC’s pre-engineering pathway, student and counselor Andrew Livsey said he has enjoyed getting to know the various Foundation Camp attendees through activities like flag football, dodgeball and basketball.\n\n“It’s important to build that personal bond so that they’ll feel comfortable talking to you and asking you questions,” Livsey said. “We’ve had a sit down where we talk with the campers about what they want to be in life, and me and the other counselors talk about our paths and try to enlighten the campers on the importance of staying in school, getting your degree and becoming successful.”\n\nFor example, Livsey helped campers understand his goal of being an automotive designer and engineer by asking campers about their favorite car, which allowed him to go into greater detail about his experiences and how education plays a critical role in achieving his dreams.\n\nLivsey said he was inspired to participate as a camp counselor because of his longtime involvement with the 100 Black Men of Rome-Northwest Georgia. As a participant in the organization’s robotics camp when he was younger, Livsey said he experienced the benefits of mentorship and wanted to provide campers with a similar influence.\n\n“What I’ve taken away from the camp is learning that you’re never too young to make a difference, and you’re never too young to choose a path,” Livsey said.\n\nThe camp, which is one of several partnerships between the 100 Black Men of Rome-Northwest Georgia and Georgia Highlands College, is funded by generous donors and the GHC Foundation, giving students the opportunity to attend the camp free of charge, including transportation and a breakfast and lunch.\n\nThe young attendees to Georgia Highlands College’s (GHC) Foundation Camp enjoyed fun in the sun the past two weeks through activities such as canoeing and kayaking, sports and scavenger hunts… and even a bit of science.\n\nUnder the buzzing propellers of drones, Professor of Biology Sharryse Henderson brought science-based activities out of GHC’s School of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) to the groups of boys, ages 10 to 12.\n\n“This age group is still very interested in science, and they find it exciting,” Henderson said. “We’re trying to help maintain that excitement for science and technology, to show them it’s not as hard as everyone says it is, that it is applicable to real-world challenges and that it is fun.”\n\nThe Foundation Camp kids each had a turn at piloting a drone through an obstacle course.\n\nTwelve-year-old Caleb, who has attended the camp in the past, said he enjoyed being able to fly a drone and has had a fun week at Foundation Camp.\n\n“This was pretty fun, and I’m glad we got the opportunity,” he said of the drone activity.\n\nStudents involved in the Georgia Highlands African American and Minority Male Excellence (GHAME) and Brother 2 Brother (B2B) student organizations volunteer to serve as counselors, mentoring the campers on brotherhood and the importance of higher education, while also helping them learn skills they will need as they continue toward adulthood.\n\nFor example, 11-year-old De’Nezz said he learned some valuable skills through activities like learning to make a good first impression by shaking hands and making eye contact for example.\n\n“We learned how to tie a tie. It was pretty hard, but they showed us the way,” Caleb added. “It’s important, because you never know when you might have to wear a tie.”\n\nThe camp, which is one of several partnerships between the 100 Black Men of Rome-Northwest Georgia and Georgia Highlands College, is funded by generous donors and the GHC Foundation, giving students the opportunity to attend the camp free of charge, including transportation and a breakfast and lunch.\n\nIn a report showing that the University System of Georgia (USG) state economic impact grew to $18.6 billion, Georgia Highlands College (GHC) holds the second highest economic impact among state colleges in Georgia for fiscal year 2020.\n\nGHC’s economic impact was over $170 million and was part of the system directly and indirectly generating 155,010 jobs in the state.\n\nThe annual study is conducted on behalf of the Board of Regents by Jeffrey M. Humphreys, Ph.D., director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth in the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business.\n\nAccording to the report, every dollar spent directly by USG institutions and their students generated an additional 47 cents for the surrounding region’s economy. While $12.7 billion of the $18.6 billion was a result of that direct spending, the remaining $5.9 billion was additional spending within local communities sparked by the presence of a USG institution.\n\nWith an uptick in direct spending for FY2020, the report found, “In sum, USG institutions were a vital source of economic stability.”\n\nThe Selig Center also conducted a companion study led by Humphreys and Alexandra P. Hill titled, “Lifetime Earnings for University System of Georgia Class of 2020.” The lifetime earnings report showed how work-life earnings increase substantially with each step up in earned degree.\n\nUSG’s 2020 graduates who work in Georgia are expected to bring in a combined of $175 billion in lifetime earnings, of which $59 billion (34 percent) can be attributed to their degrees.\n\n“With strong support from the state and significant planning from our campuses, USG’s economic impact on local communities across Georgia held steady despite a challenging year,” Acting Chancellor Teresa MacCartney said. “At the same time, a degree from a USG institution continues to add real value to the lives of our graduates and their families. We remain focused on doing everything in our power to help more Georgians complete college and ensure our state has a well-prepared, highly skilled workforce to grow Georgia’s economy.”\n\nThe full economic impact report and the lifetime earnings report are available online.\n\nTaking a biology course at Georgia Highlands College (GHC) is more than textbooks and labs. Through a partnership with The Margaret and Luke Pettit Preserve, GHC students are given the opportunity to perform experiential research and projects involving wildlife, plants and ecosystems.\n\nInterim Dean for GHC’s School of STEM Jason Christian stated these courses are called “Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences” or CURE courses.\n\n“In a CURE course, students are given some parameters to align with but then allowed to develop, implement and complete their own research on a topic they choose,” he said. “CURE courses give hands-on experience to STEM students early in their academic careers.”\n\nChristian added that the CURE courses will help students think about ideal approaches for individual undergraduate research projects, as well. He said in the field of STEM, undergraduate research can be incredibly desirable for students interested in graduate school or some professional programs like medical or veterinary schools.\n\n“The partnership with the Pettit Preserve gives us an opportunity to provide those experiences right in our own backyard,” he said.\n\nAdditionally, students in other courses out of the School of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) are also working on hands-on research at Allatoona Lake completing an analysis on the amount of dissolved oxygen, conductivity and pH of the water as well levels of coliform bacteria.\n\nPhysical Sciences Chair Erin Shufro explained that GHC has a partnership with the Lake Allatoona Association, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to raise awareness and protect the lake.\n\n“This is a perfect partnership opportunity to get our students involved in the community and to gain research experience at the same time,” she said.\n\nUnlike the undergraduate research project at Pettit Preserve, the research at Allatoona Lake has a broader scope in terms of student involvement, with the research project not being tied to a specific course.\n\n“We are accepting all students who want to participate in undergraduate research no matter what their background,” Shufro said. “I want all our students to experience the fun of research and gain the skills that we can teach them.”\n\nVisit highlands.edu to learn more about research opportunities at GHC.\n\nGeorgia Highlands College (GHC) has partnered with SDS2 (A Nemetschek Company) for the opening of a learning lab for students in the new bachelor’s in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC).\n\nBIM is the technology-driven process for estimating, creating and managing information and visuals on a construction project. A building information model represents a 3D version of every aspect of the project, from facade to foundation to structural steel.\n\nGHC’s partnerships with local industry leaders in the field led to an affordable degree pathway to a fast-growing sector with high-paying careers.\n\nThe partnership with SDS2 gives students access to a learning lab at GHC’s Cartersville site with some of the leading software for 3D steel detailing software with intelligent connection design. SDS2 generously donated the software and technology utilized in this learning lab.\n\nA ribbon cutting for the lab was held late June and the name of the lab was unveiled as the “SDS2 Learning Lab” in honor of the company’s generous contribution.\n\nThe new bachelor’s program will go before the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools for certification this fall. Slated to come online in January, it is one of just two programs of its kind in the nation. The other is at Purdue University.\n\nVisit highlands.edu for information on applying and getting started at GHC.\n\nA dark cloud creeps over the Floyd campus at Georgia Highlands College, then rain and thunder and flashes of lightning – and as soon as the director yells, “cut,” it’s all over. Making a thunderstorm in the middle of a sunny day for a two-minute scene may be called “movie magic” by most, but for the GHC film students working on a professional film set for a Local Cinema Studios production, it’s hours and hours of hard work.\n\nGHC film student Albert Cooper, of Cedartown, has been quickly learning the basics of working in the grip and lighting department as part of the crew to make “movie storms” appear on command.\n\n“What I have been doing recently is putting up lights and setting up a scene with a thunderstorm and rain,” Cooper said. “I was so surprised, because I used to think why would it take so many months for a movie to come out, so my biggest takeaway from working on the set is that film production takes a lot of time.”\n\nCooper attends classes at the Rome and Cartersville sites. He aspires to operate his own production studio after graduating from GHC.\n\n“Once I learned about what all I can do in film, that really put everything together for me and I realized this is what I want to do,” he said.\n\nGHC film student Joseph McDaniel, of Rome, has had a similar experience in the film program and working on the professional film set this summer.\n\n“I have always wanted to be a film major,” he said. “I grew up watching and reading behind-the-scenes features…”\n\nMcDaniel has a background in art and was excited to learn he could apply those skills in the art department for the film.\n\n“I have been helping dress sets, setting up every location, and I’ve done a lot of drawing in the background,” he said.\n\nAs McDaniel works to complete his degree taking classes on the Floyd campus, he said he knows that reaching his ultimate goal will require experience and hard work.\n\n“My short-term goals in the film industry are to get a job and start working on film sets as soon as possible, and so I’m really happy with what I have been able to do here,” McDaniel said. “Long term, I would like to learn everything I can and eventually get into directing…”\n\nAs a student in Georgia Highlands College’s (GHC) Film Studies pathway, Ivy Hong Le is interested in the pre-production aspect of filmmaking – especially scriptwriting.\n\nOn a Local Cinema Studios production at GHC, she had the opportunity to gain an inside look at how a script comes to life and the importance of creativity on set as an intern on the set of the film “Holy Irresistible,” which includes scenes shot at the Floyd campus.\n\n“Basically, what we do in the art department is decorating for the scene and putting out props or making them for the scene,” Hong Le said. “We have spent the past week setting up a house.”\n\nWhile the art department can often repurpose existing items and create others, Hong Le learned that sometimes there is no substitute for the real thing. For example, one day she had had to drive to Kennesaw in order to purchase two fish to be used in one of the scenes.\n\n“They had to be whole fish, with their heads attached, and I couldn’t find them nearby,” Hong Le said.\n\nShe said working in the art department requires strict attention to detail, ensuring that scenes flow properly. For example, Hong Le said that she learned the importance of ensuring continuity while setting up, breaking down and relocating portions of the set.\n\n“If one little thing is out of place, it can ruin a scene, so we take lots of pictures of where everything is placed,” Hong Le said.\n\nShe said being on set has helped her gain perspective on the multiple roles required to make a film production a success. And although the production has required 12-hour days and late nights, she said the experience has been invaluable.\n\n“I definitely learn more through experience and connections, and this has been great,” Hong Le said. “We laugh a lot when we’re working, and we’ll sometimes have get-togethers after we’re done.”\n\nHong Le resides in Rome and attends classes at the Rome site. Her plans after graduation are to explore the many opportunities available in Georgia’s growing film industry.\n\nStudents in Georgia Highlands College’s film program are putting what they’ve learned in the classroom to practice on a production set through a partnership with Local Cinema Studios.\n\nLocal Cinema Studios develops independent movie productions with special emphasis on collaboration between film students and professional filmmakers.\n\n“We work with universities and the cities they inhabit to enhance education, forward careers, provide opportunity and encourage creativity,” the studio touts in its mission statement. “We bring productions to life that are not possible within other filmmaking models. Our projects empower new voices while also building up the communities they represent.”\n\nGHC’s film students have been busy working on the production for an upcoming narrative film called “Holy Irresistible,” an original story by screenwriter Andrew Shearer.\n\nThe studio and film crew utilized parts of GHC’s Floyd campus for scenes and film production. Classrooms were converted into set design rooms, costume closets and prop departments. Locations like Paris Lake and the Lakeview building were utilized and transformed for the backdrop of key scenes.\n\n“Having an independent film shoot on GHC’s campus offering internships to film students creates an amazing opportunity for students to get hands-on experience on a working film set and learning to creatively problem-solve in real-time under the tutelage of film industry professionals,” Chair of Film Studies Seth Ingram said.\n\nFour GHC students were selected for the highly competitive internships, with two students being placed in the Art Department and two in the Grip and Electric department. Overall, the internships were comprised of students from 10 colleges and universities from around the country.\n\n“Typically, the internships are reserved for more experienced students at the junior and senior level, or even graduate levels, so for GHC to have four students earn an internship is really exciting for our film program,” Ingram said.\n\nAnd in the middle of building sets, recording scenes, staging, lightning, and everything in between, GHC’s film students have been hard at work in the mix.\n\n“At Local Cinema Studios, our mission is to provide a path from academia to industry,” the studio’s mission statement says.\n\nVisit film.highlands.edu to learn more about the film program at GHC.\n\nVisit localcinemastudios.com to learn more about Local Cinema Studios."
