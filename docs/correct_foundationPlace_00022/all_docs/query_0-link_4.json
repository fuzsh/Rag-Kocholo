        "text": "Professor Georg Nemetschek, born in 1934, is the founder, majority shareholder and guiding spirit of the Nemetschek Group, one of the largest listed software companies in Germany.\n\nIn the late 1960s, anticipating change in the construction industry, he opted for software, played a personal role in major developments and still drives innovation and digitalization in the entire building sector with energy and action to this day.\n\nIn addition, Professor Nemetschek dedicates a substantial part of his assets to non-profit purposes, e.g. within the scope of the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation.\n\nGeorg Nemetschek’s passion for computers and software led him to take the risk of investing in the development of software as early as the 1960s – at a time when PCs did not yet exist. Success proved him right: in 1963, the freshly founded “engineering firm for the construction industry” was one of the first to use programs to calculate finite elements for highly loaded, irregularly supported slabs.\n\nGeorg Nemetschek took the engineering office, founded in 1963, and evolved it into today’s Nemetschek Group, one of the leading providers of software solutions for the construction industry. As early as 1977, he was setting standards with the development of software for structural engineering. In 1999, followed the stock market listing and subsequent strong, profitable growth of the company, which today serves as an umbrella uniting four segments that cover the entire life cycle of a building with their software solutions. The founder continues to directly and immediately hold controlling interest and the majority of the voting rights of Nemetschek SE, which is listed on the MDax and TecDax.\n\nIn 1971, Georg Nemetschek was appointed professor at the Munich University of Applied Sciences. He headed the Department of Civil Engineering/Steel Construction as Dean for many years and fulfilled this role until 1996, paying particular attention to the practical training of students. Thus, by means of endowments, he made sure that students always had access to the latest software and hardware.\n\nThe “Nemetschek Innovation Foundation” was founded by Prof. Georg Nemetschek in 2020 The focus of the foundation’s activities relates to the support of science and research as well as the promotion of expertise and excellence in construction in the areas of research, teaching, innovation and academic life.\n\nThe “Nemetschek Foundation” was established by the Nemetschek family at the end of 2007. With their foundation, they want to make a contribution to strengthening democracy in Germany. In this way, they would like to give something back to the free society that has shaped their lives and made their entrepreneurial success possible. Further projects and information on the Foundation can be found at www.nemetschek-stiftung.de.\n\nThe “Professor Georg Nemetschek Foundation” was established back in 1996 for the benefit of the Faculty of Civil Engineering at Munich University of Applied Sciences. Among other things, the Foundation enabled the establishment of the iabi Institute for Applied Construction Informatics.\n\nFind out more"
