        "text": "The shareholders of DC-Software Doster &Christmann GmbH have sold 100% of their shares in the company to FRILO Software GmbH, Stuttgart, part of Nemetschek Group, Munich. The Munich-based company has been developing special software solutions for foundation engineering since 1989. With the acquisition, FRILO strategically expands its product portfolio in the foundation engineering & foundations segment and thus strengthens its position as a leading provider of structural analysis programs.\n\nWith more than 30 programs, DC-Software covers a comprehensive range of digital foundation engineering solutions. The software company’s offering is divided into two foundation engineering subsectors. Users apply the programs of the DC Soil Mechanics segment for soil investigations, soil and contaminated site investigations as well as the visualization of geothermal boreholes and geothermal probes. The DC Foundation Engineering Statics program group, on the other hand, comprises software solutions for geotechnical calculations, foundation engineering as well as groundwater drawdown and infiltration.\n\nSince its incorporation in 1989, DC-Software has developed into a sustainably growing and profitable company. With the acquisition of the company that is established on the DACH market, FRILO expands its portfolio in the segment of foundation engineering & foundations in a trend-setting way. “We are extremely pleased to have gained many years of expertise in software development in the special field of foundation engineering for our customers with DC-Software,” says Markus Gallenberger, managing director of FRILO. “Due to the expansion of our foundation engineering solutions, our customers benefit from an enormous solution portfolio that FRILO provides for their daily business. The consistently growing and beneficial product portfolio always makes the difference for our customers.”\n\n“We attach great importance to ensuring continuity for customers and employees with the takeover. I am convinced that FRILO and the Nemetschek Group provide the appropriate conditions for this,” says Dr.-Ing. Armin Doster, co-founder of DC-Software. “In addition, we expect this step to enable us to profitably use the strong synergies between the two companies and to benefit from new impulses.”\n\nAtares* acted as exclusive M&A advisor to DC-Software and supported the client throughout the entire sales transaction. In addition to the implementation of a structured sales process, the consulting services included the preparation of marketing and transaction documents, identification and approaching of potential investors including management presentations as well as support in the due diligence and negotiation of the transaction. The transaction team of atares consisted of Jan Pörschmann (Partner, Munich), and Maximilian Gluchowski (Associate, Munich).\n\nAtares is the digital M&A boutique for technology-driven midcap companies in Germany and sees itself as a pioneer for the digitalization of the M&A industry. Founded in 2001, atares has advised more than 200 transactions in more than 20 years. The focus is on transaction volumes between EUR 10 and 100 million of mostly owner-managed companies. Since November 2023, the company formerly known as Proventis Partners, Munich, has been operating under the new company name atares GmbH. Atares has long-standing personal contacts with corporate and Private Equity investors and M&A advisors in Europe, North and South America and Asia. Highly specialized expertise for the market, empathy for people and passion make atares a sought-after M&A partner for the tech champions of tomorrow. More than 20 employees at atares in Munich and Düsseldorf manage their projects via the in-house developed digital M&A dealfloor (dealfloor.co) – for value-adding, efficient transactions with the best user experience."
