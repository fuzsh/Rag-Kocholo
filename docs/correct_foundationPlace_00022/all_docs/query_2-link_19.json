Since the mid 1990s, company founder Professor Georg Nemetschek has been focusing on the best way to achieve this. The vision: Nemetschek wants to provide all those involved in the design, construction and management of buildings with all the relevant data at any time and place in a consistent form, and thereby optimize the entire life cycle of buildings with regard to quality, costs and deadlines. Thanks to the internet, this vision can now be realized.\n\n6.

CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Networked planning, construction, management. The future. Even in times of global mass production, every building remains unique. It is the product of collaboration between numerous participants that join forces for the project and constantly have to communicate with each other. The processes relating to building are complex, because they are planned, controlled and executed by numerous disciplines at different locations. As a result, progress with regard to productivity is lower in the building sector than in other industries. Nemetschek‘s goal is to optimize interdisciplinary collaboration in the construction process and increase efﬁciency with the help of sophisticated information technologies. The group‘s organi- zation along the construction value chain – design, construction, management – emanates from this “To- The decisive challenge is ﬁguring tal Quality“ approach: out how one discipline can process Efﬁcient processes require efﬁcient communication and smooth data exchange. The key challenge here relevant data from another – is for one discipline to be able to directly process regardless of the software used. relevant data from another discipline, regardless of whether this data comes from CAD programs, solutions for structural calculations, construction process planning, documents or ERP programs for costing – and without the need for time-con- suming re-input of data, as has often been necessary up to now. In some areas, this already works well; the seamless integration between CAD software and structural analysis programs from the Nemetschek Group is one example of this. But the real goal is far more ambitious: ultimately, a central data model for every construction project will integrate the work done by all the discip- lines involved, regardless of the software used. In this way – and that is what Nemetschek understands by the much-discussed Building Informa- tion Modeling (BIM) – not only will the planning and construction process itself become far more productive, there will also be a signiﬁcant increase in efﬁciency in the decades-long management phase of a building. The building manager has access to the central data model, and thus the related detailed information, at all times and can therefore carry out necessary renovation or refurbishment measures far more easily and cost-effectively. The owner has access to the entire building project‘s DNA, so to speak. 5\n\n10. Networked construction. How to get there. The company founder‘s vision is within reach today – thanks to the extended capabilities of the internet and the increased linking up of large sections of business. Only recently has the internet started to offer the bandwidths required to manage large volumes of data at the required speed, and today, ﬂat rates are common. Information exchange, as well as the handling of entire busi- ness processes over the internet is so normal that location- and device-independent use of ser- vices via cloud computing is becoming the most important trend in the IT industry. Nemetschek is taking advantage of this development: a team of experts at group level is develop- ing a new Web platform that provides information on demand and in structured form to all those involved in a construction project. In the ﬁrst version of the platform, users are able to evaluate, comment on and link to relevant ﬁles and documents, whatever their format, and regardless of time and place. The second development step for the platform is to provide the currently relevant data – and only this data – from one discipline‘s software solution to another discipline‘s program in such a way that this data can be processed there directly, commented on and imported back, and, if applic- able, with instructions for action. Previous data exchange formats such as the manufacturer- HOW CUSTOMERS BENEFIT FROM THE INTER NET » Program services can be procured ﬂexibly » Customers pay for what they need – ﬁxed costs become variable costs » Content that makes work easier is available in the latest version at any time » Teams can work together regardless of where the individual members are located » Interdisciplinary collaboration becomes easier\n\n11.

HOW NEMETSCHEK BENEFITS FROM THE INTER NET » Customer loyalty becomes stronger and more direct » Marketing can operate in a more targeted way » Repeat sales increase » Internationalization becomes easier » The offer of additional services also opens up further sales opportunities and access to new customer groups independent format IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), which has been supported by Nemetschek for years, have so far lacked precisely these communicative and collaborative functions – for example, to track who changed or released which version of a detail, and when. However, these collaborative additional functions are of fundamental importance for clarifying the construction process – and Nemetschek‘s new cooperation platform aims to provide these functions, closely linked with the data exchanged via IFC. Step by step, a central data model will therefore be A central data model is created created for each building project on the platform, and for each building project on the will gradually integrate the work of all disciplines. This does not just cover the virtual 3D building model; the platform that gradually integrates individual contents are linked with the relevant addition- the work of all disciplines. al data from the cost plan through to ofﬁcial approval. Nemetschek is working intensively on the implemen- tation of this project, and in doing so, it is also creating a suitable framework for the expertise relating to the construction process which the group has gathered over decades, and which is the company‘s real USP. Not only that, the platform is open: the service offerings from external partners can also be inte- grated easily. Whether it‘s a service for performing a collision check on the plans from different partners, or the offer of a detailed energy evaluation for the data model, those involved in the construction project can take advantage of a wide range of different building information services from third parties, depending on what they need.\n\n13. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG From license to service business In this way, the group is developing from a software provider to a provider of solutions and ser- vices for the design, construction and management of buildings. The advancement of cloud com- puting favors the development of the business model towards software as a service. Nemetschek not only offers software licenses and maintenance agreements, it also makes its solu- tions available as required and ﬂexibly in real time over the internet. While many still have security concerns about moving business-critical applications to the public cloud; hybrid models, or a completely private cloud, are possible alternatives: Customers can access with these, companies create their own cloud, for example, by storing their programs from and operating software in central computer centers. anywhere, and if ne- Nemetschek sees this trend as an opportunity. Over the course of this cessary lease computer year, the individual portfolio companies under the group umbrella will capacities and software offer Web-based versions of their solutions. The facility management software from Nemetschek subsidiary Allplan, for example, is already for new employees at available as a Web version. Customers can work with their software after short notice. logging in on the internet, instead of receiving the program as a DVD and installing it locally, as in the past. As a result, they can access their programs from anywhere – in the ofﬁce, from home, or while on business trips. If necessary, customers can lease computer ca- pacities and software for new employees at short notice. This is billed easily and transparently with a monthly fee, which the customer pays for each user. New opportunities for international sales and distribution The new offering will only gradually gain acceptance on the market. The leasing of additional software to handle peaks in demand will certainly be of particular interest – and it is also an attractive alternative for those new to their profession. And for Nemetschek itself, it offers new opportunities for international sales and distribution; for example, software can no longer be pirated if it is, from the outset, only available as a service in certain markets. The merging of software and the internet also enables us to offer additional beneﬁts for the user. The Nemetschek portfolio companies will be able to increase customer loyalty and further in- crease repeat sales. Nemetschek‘s largest subsidiaries, Allplan und Graphisoft, are already taking advantage of these opportunities offered by the internet. 9\n\n15. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Networked planning. Now. The internet offers access to the most up-to-date content, any place, and time – and precise- ly this is the advantage of the new generation of Nemetschek Allplan: The “Allplan Connect” service portal, which will be available from April 2011, not only enables automatic updates via the internet, but it also gives customers a central internet service for the software across the whole of Europe. Using their personal login data, planners can access current content in the form of thousands of CAD objects for their planning documents and presentations, any time and any place – from windows and doors to furniture and ﬂoor coverings. And the content is constantly being expanded, because renowned The central internet service for manufacturers are also interested in having their detailed information available. the software permits access to the As the objects are often country-speciﬁc, and are latest design tools and community often deﬁned in different ways, Allplan Connect expertise, any time, any place. offers a way of searching for locally relevant content in the national language. From the service portal, the objects can be easily integrated into the planning documents created with Allplan. There are also valuable planning tools such as design details for the construction of individual parts of the building. With their personalized access portal, Allplan customers not only have access to various e-learning offerings, but can also directly contact the technical support team, and ﬁnd out about the status of their inquiries. At the same time, the service portal integrates social media function- alities; via a user forum, customers can network and exchange information, for example. Step by step, the boundaries between the internet and the installed software are becoming blurred. What‘s more, Allplan is also able to learn more about what its customers want, and can address these needs more directly. 11\n\n16. Networking in a team. Now. Teamwork between several architects in a project across different locations – in the age of the internet, that should really be a matter of course. But in reality, up until recently, long waiting times for data synchronization hindered joint work on a building model. Nemetschek subsidiary Graphisoft has solved this problem with the Teamwork 2.0 function in- tegrated into its Archicad program. The BIM server, a model-based server solution, constantly manages the central building model and access to it via the internet. This server means that users now only need to send individual project elements, rather than entire projects, over the data line. This reduces the data volume and makes updates much faster. Every employee can re- serve and edit the element he or she is responsible for, and Regardless of location, every then make it available to the team again. Access rights and employee can reserve and edit the changes made are clearly documented. Short messages via the integrated message function show the processing status individual elements he or she is or a new task. responsible for, and then make them In 2010, the practicability of the solution was veriﬁed mul- available to the team again. tiple times. For example, different planning teams in Berlin, Dortmund, Munich and Vienna simultaneously worked on an ofﬁce building project. “The most impressive thing was that everything was so unspectacular. That reveals its high suitability for day-to-day use,” said the Deutsche Bauzeitung, journal for the construction industry. The customer‘s increase in efﬁciency is obvious. Many architectural ﬁrms create joint ventures for larger projects, and many large ofﬁces work with small partner ofﬁces locally. The Graphisoft solution also supports mobile working when out of the ofﬁce or at home – and increases accept- ance among users as a result.\n\n17.

TO OUR SH A R EHOLDERS 16 Letter to the Shareholders 18 Nemetschek on the Capital Market 20 Corporate Governance 23 Report of the Supervisory Board\n\n20. To our Shareholders Letter to the Shareholders Dear shareholders, ladies and gentlemen, In 2010, the Nemetschek Group overcame the consequences of the global economic crisis. In the ﬁrst year after the crisis, sales revenues had already returned to the 2008 level. Thanks to the ongoing, keenly pursued cost management and clear focus on our core business, the operating margin reached a record level. To achieve this level over the long term, we must continue to grow – and invest in growth. With a planned increase in sales of around 10 percent, the Nemetschek Group has set an ambitious target for the current ﬁscal year. This requires substantial investments in the product and service offering as well as in our market presence, and implies a moderate increase in personnel. In 2011, we will continue to drive forward internationalization and above all concentrate on countries outside Europe. Even though the relevant industry associations predict continued market growth in Germany, France and Scandinavia, where Nemetschek is traditionally strong, a moderate upward trend for Europe as a whole is not expected until 2012. The emerging economies, on the other hand, are characterized by far more dynamic growth. These countries include Brazil, where our Belgian subsidiary Scia saw initial successes in 2010. In view of this, in the second quarter we will open a branch in Brazil, which will in future also distribute further products from the group. SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN WEB TECHNOLOGIES Nemetschek is known as a technology company that invests heavily in research and development – in 2010, the ﬁgure was almost 24 percent of sales revenues. In 2011, we aim to increase this percentage. The Nemetschek Group management is determined to systematically take advantage of the new opportunities for growth re sulting from the general trend toward cloud computing. On the one hand, this requires additional investment on the part of the subsidiaries to make their software solutions Web-ready and to be able to offer additional services over the internet in the future. In doing so, they will systematically increase customer beneﬁt and therefore customer loyalty. On the other hand, the holding is pushing cross-company Web topics forward, because the managing board and supervisory board are convinced that the new technologies offer great opportunities for the group as a whole. These technologies open up new options for internationalization, if software can be offered as a service. In addition, Nemetschek has the unique opportunity to provide a new framework for its extensive knowledge relating of the design, construction and management of buildings and present itself as a complete solution provider for the construction process, just as the company‘s founder envisaged. With the functionalities and bandwidths available today, the internet enables new forms of collaboration and communication between all those involved in the construction process, and therefore also completely new services relating to the construc- tion process. It is precisely this that the group is working on – and we are therefore dedicating considerable space to this topic in this year‘s annual report.\n\n21. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Letter to the Shareholders Ernst Homolka, CEO LONG-TERM STRENGTHENING OF THE COMPANY VALUE We are undertaking these efforts with a clear goal: Nemetschek should grow and become more proﬁtable over the long term – thereby generating substantial added value for customers, shareholders and employees. This goes hand in hand with the long-term increase of the company value. Dear shareholders, 2010 was a very successful year for the Nemetschek group. We achieved a record operating result and the cash ﬂow from operating activities is higher than ever. The equity ratio is 57 percent. With this in mind, the managing board and supervisory board have decided to propose doubling the dividend at this year’s annual general meeting. We believe that now is the right time for our shareholders to participate substantially in the success of the company. Rest assured that we are doing everything to keep the Nemetschek Group on its successful course – and to achieve further successes. Thank you for your trust. Yours, Ernst Homolka 17\n\n22. Nemetschek on the Capital Market HIGHEST SHARE PRICE IN TEN YEARS For a large part of 2010, the global stock markets were affected by the worrying economic situation in a few southern European countries, particularly Greece. Until the fall, the stock markets were extremely nervous, and the mood did not change until the last quarter: The DAX (German stock index) exceeded the 7,000 point mark several times, among other things as a result of the positive data on Germany‘s economic development, and at the end of 2010 was around 16 percent higher than at the start of the year. The Nemetschek stock, which is listed in the Prime Standard (ISIN DE0006452907), was largely unaffected by the nervous mood on the stock markets. From mid-April, it developed signiﬁcantly better than the relevant indexes such as the TecDAX. Overall, the share rose by around 94 percent in 2010 and reached its highest price since the start of 2000, 32.28 euros, on December 3, 2010.

That month, the trading volume on Xetra reached the rela- European stock tively high level of around 215,000 shares. The Nemetschek share was largely able to withstand the increasing exchanges nervousness on the European stock exchanges as of May: the price hovered around the 22 euro mark, but did not fall further below it. The price rose clearly after DZ Bank included coverage of the share on October 14, and set a price target of 44 euros. The upward trend in a now friendly environment was further bolstered by the good results for the third quarter and the reinforced forecast for the 2010 ﬁscal year. Following an investor roadshow over several days by the managing board and IR management at the start of December, it then rose above the 30 euro mark: On December 3, the share closed at 32.28 euros, the highest price for 10 years. At the end of December, the price was 31.87 euros. MAJORITY OF SHARES OWNED BY FAMILY The Nemetschek family holds over 53 percent of the total 9,625,000 Nemetschek shares. The remaining 46.5 percent are free ﬂoating. Around 50 percent of the freely tradable stocks are held by institutional investors. Of these, only two hold slightly more than three percent of the capital stock of Nemetschek AG. The remaining stocks are held by private investors. Two designated sponsors provided sufﬁcient liquidity for the stock: WestLB and Equinet, which was replaced by DZ Bank in October. WestLB and Goldman Sachs published regular analy- ses on the Nemetschek stock in 2010, as did DZ Bank as of October.

All items on the agenda requiring consent were voted through by stock holders with over 90 percent support. The resolution on the appropriation of proﬁts and payment of a dividend of 0.50 euros was approved by 98.6 percent.

Corporate Governance The German Corporate Governance Code in the current version dated May 26, 2010, contains recommenda- tions on the management and oversight of Germany’s publicly traded corporations, as well as nationally and internationally recognized standards for good corporate management. For Nemetschek AG’s managing board and supervisory board, responsible and value-based corporate management and supervision are a matter of course and a basic prerequisite for economic activity over the long term. This includes efﬁcient cooperation between the managing board and supervisory board, respect for the interests of shareholders and employees, transparent corporate communication and responsibility for risk handling. The managing board and supervisory board largely follow the recommendations in the current version of the Corporate Governance Code. The few exceptions concern individual regulations in the Code which, from their point of view, do not suit the requirements of medium-sized enterprises. Every year, as part of the statutory regulations, the managing board and supervisory board of Nemetschek AG issue a statement that the company has adhered to, and adheres to, recommendations of the government commission’s German Corporate Governance Code. If certain recommendations have not been followed, then this is stated too. The current Nemetschek AG declaration of conformity in accordance with § 161 of the Stock Corporation Act, which can be viewed on the company’s website at www.nemetschek.com, was made on March 24, 2011. Additional information COOPERATION BETWEEN MANAGING BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD The managing board and supervisory board again worked closely and trustfully together in 2010. The mana- ging board has sole responsibility for the management of Nemetschek AG and is committed to the interests of the company and to increasing the shareholder value over the long term. It reports to the supervisory board regularly, quickly and comprehensively, in written and verbal form, about all relevant issues relating to business development and company planning, including the risk situation, risk management and compliance. More information on this can be found in the supervisory board’s report on pages 23-25 of this annual report, as well as in the management report. COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT Compliance, i.e., the act of adhering to valid provisions, is a basic prerequisite for successful economic activity over the long term. The managing board ensures that legal requirements and internal company guidelines within the Nemetschek Group are adhered to. They are supported in this by the internal Compliance Ofﬁcer and a Compliance Team. The Compliance Team’s tasks include providing support for the management bodies and departments in the group’s companies to ensure that all business processes conform to the law and meet inter- nal guidelines. To ensure compliance over the long term throughout the company, Compliance Managers were installed in key parts of the group in 2009. Long-serving and particularly experienced employees were entrusted with this task. In this context, a compliance training program for all of the Nemetschek Group’s employees was launched. Detailed information on Nemetschek AG’s risk management system can be found on pages 46 et seq of the management report. REMUNERATION OF MANAGING BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, we have been reporting the individual remuneration of all members of the managing board and supervisory board for a long time. A break- down of the remuneration of the individual members by component can be found in the management report.\n\n25. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Corporate Governance The remuneration of members of the managing board consists of a basic salary and variable compensation. The variable compensation is largely dependent on the attainment of corporate objectives with respect to reve- nues and earnings. A smaller portion of the variable remuneration is paid out upon achieving individual tar- gets. In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the members of the supervisory board also receive performance-related and ﬁxed remuneration. This is based on the consolidated earnings per share. With a view to corporate management over the long term and in accordance with the requirements of the German Act on the Appropriateness of Managing Board Remuneration (VorstAG), the incentive plan for the managing board and executive ofﬁces was extended to include a long-term component at the end of 2009. The long-term incentive plan, which covers a time frame of four years, includes performance-related com- ponents based on corporate objectives and the development of the share price. Thus, it is ensured that the interests of the managing board and the interests of the shareholders are sustainably linked to long-term increases in shareholder value. DIRECTORS’ DEALINGS AND SHARE OPTION SCHEMES No transactions subject to report were announced in the calendar year 2010. The share option scheme of Nemetschek AG from 2003 matured with effect from July 28, 2008 and was not replaced by a new share option scheme. Nemetschek AG has currently not issued any option rights. TRANSPARENCY Nemetschek places great importance on transparency and effectively ensures that the principle of equal treat- ment for shareholders is strictly adhered to. All corporate communication is geared towards informing all inve- stors comprehensively and in a timely manner. As part of its investor relations activities, Nemetschek regularly organizes meetings with analysts and institutional investors. Furthermore, the publication of the quarterly state- ments is followed by telephone conferences. The presentations made in this connection are freely available simultaneously on the Internet at www.nemetschek.com and are supplemented by audio recordings. Since 2010 Nemetschek has additionally published a newsletter which reports between the quarterly reports on important developments within the group. As soon as Nemetschek becomes aware that a shareholder is subject to report because they have exceeded or fallen below the proportion of voting rights stated in the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (German Securities Trading Act), then this fact is announced by the company without delay. Information on the shares held by the mana- ging board and supervisory board can be found in the remuneration report of the management report and in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. The ﬁnancial calendar published on the Internet contains all the publication dates for the relevant ﬁnancial reports. In this respect, Nemetschek has set itself the goal of exceeding the provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code and publishes its quarterly results within 30 days of the end of the relevant reporting period. 21\n\n26. Declaration of conformity in accordance with § 161 of the Stock Corporation Act, dated March 24, 2011 In accordance with § 161 of the Stock Corporation Act, the managing board and supervisory board of Nemet- schek AG declare that the recommendations of the “Government Commission of the German Corporate Gover- nance Code“, version dated May 26, 2010, published in the ofﬁcial part of the electronic Federal Gazette on July 2, 2010, (hereinafter “Code“), have been and are being met, though with the following exceptions: In Code Item 2.3.3, sentence 2 the GCGC recommends that the company should also assist shareholders in postal votes and with proxies. The Articles of Association of Nemetschek AG have not yet provided for the option of postal voting. In our view, postal votes have not yet been sufﬁciently tested, and there have been difﬁculties particularly in respect to ascertaining the authenticity of votes thus submitted. Moreover, Nemetschek AG already offers its shareholders the option of entrusting the exercising of their voting rights to a proxy appointed by the company. Shareholders therefore already have the possibility of submitting their votes also before the day of the Annual General Meeting. Securing the rights of shareholders by having the additional option of postal votes would not ultimately serve to facilitate the process further. The D & O insurance does not include excess insurance for members of the supervisory board (Code Item 3.2 Clause 2). Nemetschek AG does not believe that excess insurance would increase the motivation and sense of responsibility of the members of the supervisory board. The managing board of Nemetschek AG consists of only one person (Code Item 4.2.1). The managing board and supervisory board believe that neither the organizational structure of the Nemetschek Group nor the focus of Nemetschek AG on holding tasks and group control necessarily requires a managing board with several people. Moreover, an Executive Council has been established within the Nemetschek Group to provide support for the managing board. The Council is made up of the managing board and the managing directors of the most important product organizations. Its task is to deﬁne and implement the strategic ori- entation of the group. The employment contract of the managing board does not include a severance payment cap (Code Item 4.2.3 Clause 4). The new managing board contract, which came into effect at the beginning of 2010, is valid for three years. The supervisory board is of the view that the short contract period of three years in itself offers adequate protection against unreasonable severance payments, which is why a separate severance payment cap was not agreed on. Code Item 5.1.2 Clause 2 and Code Item 5.4.1 Clause 2 and Clause 3 are not complied with. An age limit for members of the managing board and the supervisory board has not been deﬁned explicitly and is not currently planned. Such age limit would generally restrict the company in its selection of suitable members of the managing board and the supervisory board. For the company, the composition of the supervisory board is determined primarily by the experience, capabilities and expertise of its individual members. On the other hand, the supervisory board considers diversity criteria to be lower-ranking, even though it expressly welcomes them and the associated quest for an appropriate female quota. The code recommendation on the formation of qualiﬁed committees is not followed (Code Item 5.3), as the supervisory board only has three members. The tasks for which the Code recommends the formation of such committees are all performed by the supervisory board of Nemetschek Aktiengesellschaft. Deviating from Code Item 5.4.3, the managing board of Nemetschek Aktiengesellschaft applied for the ofﬁ- cial appointment of a member of the supervisory board in February 2008 and requests that an unlimited ofﬁcial appointment be ﬁlled by the next AGM. The reason for this was that the supervisory board member concerned had already been elected by the AGM 2007 for a full term and merely left the supervisory board temporarily due to illness.

CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Corporate Governance Report of the Supervisory Board Supervisory Board Report on Nemetschek AG’s 2010 Fiscal Year Ladies and Gentlemen, dear shareholders, In the past ﬁscal year, the sales revenues of the Nemetschek Group returned to the 2008 level, and with an ope- rating margin of almost 25 percent, the company is more proﬁtable than ever. Thanks to a cash ﬂow from ope- rating activities that is as usual strong, the company was able to reduce its liabilities further and has been free of net debt since the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. This is a good basis for investing more in growth and consistently taking advantage of new market opportunities. ONGOING DIALOG BETWEEN SUPERVISORY BOARD AND MANAGING BOARD During the past ﬁscal year, Nemetschek AG’s supervisory board once again extensively fulﬁlled the tasks and duties it is legally mandated to perform. It advised the managing board on strategically directing the company and monitored the managing board’s activities. The supervisory board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance for the company. In a total of four meetings during the course of the year the supervi- sory board provided advice both on the company’s strategy and the development underway at the time. The members of the supervisory board also held regular discussions with the managing board outside of these mee- ting and acted in an advisory capacity. Nemetschek AG‘s managing board presented the supervisory board with comprehensive quarterly reports about the business situation, including sales, revenue and liquidity developments, as well as the company‘s overall situation. These reports were supplemented by monthly reporting on sales development and contributi- on margins for the group as a whole and for the individual subsidiaries. The managing board regularly informed the supervisory board about all issues relating to risks and risk management and the work of the compliance team. The detailed reports were available to every member of the supervisory board. They were regarded as very positive and were discussed in detail. On the basis of the managing board‘s reports, the supervisory board supported the managing board’s work and endorsed actions requiring approval. It did not form any committees. The full supervisory board and managing board attended all supervisory board meetings. BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS IN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD MEETINGS MEETING IN MARCH 2010 During this meeting, the supervisory board discussed in detail the annual ﬁnancial statement presented by the managing board, Nemetschek AG’s annual report, consolidated ﬁnancial statements and group management report, as well as the auditor’s reports and audit results. The appointed auditor also took part in this meeting. The supervisory board established the audited ﬁnancial statements for 2009 of Nemetschek AG, approved the consolidated statement for 2009, which had also been audited, and a decision was made on the appropriation of proﬁts. In addition, the proposed agenda for the Annual General Meeting, the supervisory board report and the Decla- ration of Conformity in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code were advised on, approved and decided on. The supervisory board also concerned itself with the business progress in the ﬁrst quarter and the forecast for 2010 as a whole. 23\n\n28. MEETING IN JULY 2010 This supervisory board meeting discussed the managing board‘s report on business development in the second quarter, the situation in the individual business units and business prospects. There were intensive discussions about the further internationalization of the group and initial thoughts about a future company strategy in the context of cloud computing. The managing board reported on the status of the implementation of a new ERP system and on the activities in the area of investor relations. MEETING IN OCTOBER 2010 This supervisory board meeting primarily dealt with the business results for the third quarter and the outlook for the end of the year. The managing board reported comprehensively on the introduction of new software ver- sions of Allplan, Graphisoft, Vectorworks and Maxon. In connection with this, there was an initial status report on the Web-readiness of individual products. Potential acquisitions were also the subject of discussions. In addition, the managing board and supervisory board discussed the risk management report. MEETING IN DECEMBER 2010 This supervisory board meeting focused on the managing board‘s report on the results of the ﬁrst 11 months of 2010 and the planning for the 2011 ﬁscal year. The managing board‘s report also contained details about the planned development of the individual business units. During this supervisory board meeting, the medium to long-term goals of the company were discussed in detail, and a decision was made in favor of a clear growth strategy for the company. The managing board was asked to take systematic advantage of the opportunities for further internationalization and the general trend towards cloud computing and then to invest in these accor- dingly. The risk report on key people in the group and the subject of compliance were also discussed and evaluated in detail. Another important topic in this supervisory board meeting was a proposal put forward by the managing board about the future dividend policy of the Nemetschek Group. According to this, future dividends would be based on the cash ﬂow from operating activities, in order to make them more predictable for investors. After extensive discussion, the supervisory board agreed to the proposal. FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT EXPLAINED IN DETAIL The annual ﬁnancial statement prepared by the managing board according to the German Commercial Code, taking into consideration the accounting principles and annual report of Nemetschek AG for the 2010 ﬁscal year, the consolidated ﬁnancial statement prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Stan- dards (IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and also according to §315a Paragraph 1 of the German Civil Code, and the consolidated annual report for the 2010 ﬁscal year have been audited and approved without qualiﬁcation by auditing ﬁrm KPMG AG Berlin, Munich branch. The supervisory board has persuaded itself as to the inde- pendence of the auditors. The ﬁnal documents and managing board’s proposal on the appropriation of proﬁts as well as the auditor’s audit reports were made available to the supervisory board in good time. The meeting of the supervisory board held on March 24, 2010 to discuss, on the basis of the auditor’s reports, Nemetschek AG’s annual ﬁnancial statements and management report as well as the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and consolidated ﬁnancial statements was attended by the auditors, who answered all questions thoroughly. Taking the auditor’s reports into consideration, the supervisory board has examined the annual ﬁnancial state- ments, the management report, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the group’s management report and is convinced of the correctness and completeness of the actual information. The supervisory board approved the result of the auditor’s examinations based on its own examinations. The supervisory board raised no objections. The supervisory board explicitly endorsed the ﬁnancial statement and consolidated statement 2010 of Nemetschek AG in the balance sheet meeting on March 24, 2010. The annual ﬁnancial statements of Nemetschek AG for ﬁscal year 2010 are thus ﬁnal.\n\n29. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG Report of the Supervisory Board During the meeting on March 24, 2011 the supervisory board also approved the new Declaration of Conformity in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code (Code as dated May 26, 2010. see page 22). DIVIDEND BASED ON CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES The supervisory board discussed the dividend policy with the managing board once again and agreed to the managing board‘s concrete proposal for the appropriation of proﬁts. In accordance with legal rulings and the company articles, it was decided to propose the following appropriation of proﬁts to the Annual General Mee- ting in May 2011: Of the balance sheet proﬁt amounting to 28,683,572.58 euros, 9,625,000.00 will be paid out to the sharehol- ders. This represents a dividend per share of 1.00 euro (previous year: 0.50 euro). Of the remaining balance sheet proﬁt of 19,058,572.58 euros, 9,500,000.00 euros will be transferred to revenue reserves and 9,558,572.58 euros will be carried to a new account. MANAGING BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD UNCHANGED There were no changes to the managing board of Nemetschek AG. The number of members and composition of the supervisory board also remained unchanged in 2010. The supervisory board would like to thank the managing board and all Nemetschek group employees for their dedication and excellent work during the past ﬁscal year.

Group Management Report for the Financial Year 2010 The Company Nemetschek in brief The Nemetschek Group is Europe’s leading vendor of software for architecture and construction. The compa- nies under the umbrella of Nemetschek Aktiengesellschaft provide end-to-end solutions for architects, structu- ral designers, civil and specialist engineers – ranging all the way to construction software for cost and schedule planning, tenders, awarding of contracts, invoicing and execution of building work. There are also solutions for technical facility management and commercial property management as well as visualization software for architecture, ﬁlm and advertising. From CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): the graphical, analytical and commercial solutions from the group cover a substantial portion of the entire value chain in the construction industry – from the planning and visualization of a building and the construction process itself, through to building management. With its ten product brands, the group offers a broad range of software solutions for a heterogeneous market. The software solutions, some of which are closely interlinked, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among those involved in the building process and thus make the process itself more efﬁcient. Nemetschek was founded in 1963 as engineering ofﬁce and today the group employs 1,076 people worldwide. In 2010, Nemetschek achieved revenues of EUR 149.7 million and an operating result (EBITDA) of EUR 37.1 million. Business segments Under the Nemetschek Group umbrella, the ten product companies operate largely independently. Each company is assigned to one of the four business segments: Design, Build, Manage and Multimedia. THE DESIGN BUSINESS SEGMENT The companies in this, the largest, segment of the group have a global presence and offer software solutions for architects, civil engineers, structural designers, design professionals and landscape designers. They therefore primarily offer programs for CAD and CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) – for planning in 2D or for 3D (3-dimensional) component-oriented design. The focus for users is on practical relevance, ease of use and modiﬁcation in line with regional building requirements. Simple data exchange with other disciplines is also becoming increasingly important. Users require interlinked solutions, of which there are good examples in the area of design, for example, the seamless interaction between CAD programs and structural calculations. DESIGN – FOCUS ON ARCHITECTURE The companies in the Design business segment include Nemetschek Allplan, the Hungarian company Graphi- soft with its core product Archicad, and Nemetschek Vectorworks. Nemetschek Allplan, which until now has had a strong presence primarily in Europe, represents the group’s platform product: Allplan offers comprehen- sive solutions for architects, civil engineers and facility managers and thus provides an instrument for largely integrated planning, from design through execution to subsequent building management. The integration of specialist design solutions and the seamless connection to the software of the Engineering components makes the product attractive, not least for general contractors and for projects in the area of public-private partnerships.\n\n33. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG The Company In mid-October 2010 Allplan introduced its newest software version, Allplan 2011, to the market. The most important new feature is the redesign of the graphic core which uses the high processing power of modern graphic cards. This enables the display time, especially for larger data quantities, of up to 50 times faster – no other CAD program for architecture and civil engineering is so fast. Additionally, an improved user interface and optimized workﬂows make the system particularly user friendly. From Spring 2011 services offered will be extended to include the new service portal, Allplan Connect, which connects customers worldwide via the Inter- net and offers access to current content and services (see section “Special“ for more). The Hungarian company Graphisoft, with its globally marketed CAD solution Archicad, primarily targets architects and covers the entire value chain of a design ofﬁce, from the initial draft through to the ﬁnal details of the working drawings. In 2010 Graphisoft was, among other things, able to expand its presence in Japan and attract important key customers in this area. In mid-2010 the newest version of Graphisoft‘s architect software came out on the market. With ArchiCAD 14 the Hungarians optimized cooperation between architects and engineers during model-based planning. Based on the IFC technology, the company developed a solution which further improves the data exchange and thus cooperation between Archicad users, structural engineers and service engineers. In 2010 Nemetschek North America was renamed Nemetschek Vectorworks – this was done to reﬂect the international presence of the company, which now extends into China. The core product of Vectorworks is a CAD solution for design and execution planning which offers a broad spectrum of speciﬁc industry solutions for architects, interior designers, landscape planners and stage and lighting designers. Vectorworks is the most-used CAD program on Apple Macintosh around the globe. The Vectorworks 2011 version marketed since September 2010 contains numerous improvements, including an Thanks to the optimized 2D/3D function with a simple switch between the two options. Additionally, in Vectorworks 2011 the cooperation with integrated visualization program Renderworks offers much better performance photographically – thanks to Maxon, the per- close cooperation with Maxon, the multimedia subsidiary of Nemetschek. The program is now based on a formance of the Cinema 4D render engine by Maxon, which enables, on the one hand, the fast and closely realistic display of visualization program pictures and animation, and on the other, the accurate photographic visualization of projects during the entire Vectorworks is planning process. much higher DESIGN – FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING The companies that focus on construction engineering include Nemetschek Allplan (with its product line for construction engineering), Nemetschek Scia, Nemetschek Engineering, Friedrich & Lochner and Glaser. These companies offer solutions for all areas of engineering – including CAD, structural analysis, logistics, and project management – from easily learnable starter products to high-end solutions. Together, the companies focusing on engineering have around 20,000 customers and are therefore the leaders for engineering software in Europe. For three years, the ﬁve providers in the Nemetschek Engineering Group have been working together to jointly address relevant topics and coordinate their marketing activities. For example, the group holds an international user competition every two years. For the current “user contest 2011“ 120 engineering building projects have been registered worldwide. The Belgian company Nemetschek Scia, after Allplan the largest company in the Engineering Group, offers solutions for high-end engineering. These are used by engineers in structural stress planning to analyze and measure general two-dimensional and three-dimensional steel and reinforced concrete structures with other materials. Scia works with the CAD products from Nemetschek on the basis of a digital building model and incorporates its speciﬁc engineering knowledge here. The core product, Scia Engineer, enables the modeling of large and complex structures such as bridges, towers, energy plants and tower blocks. Additionally, there is Scia Steel, software for integrated production management in steel construction manufacturing. With this product the Nemetschek subsidiary was able to acquire important contracts in Brazil. What is more, Scia‘s customers include several of the large Brazilian steel building companies. 29\n\n34. The Stuttgart company, Nemetschek Frilo, offers a comprehensive range of structural engineering programs that primarily support engineers’ day-to-day work. The Frilo software is particularly characterized by ease of use and fast results. Thanks to the comprehensive implementation of the uniform Eurocode, “Frilo Statics“ is also now useable in countries outside of Germany: in Belgium, the Czech Republic and in the Netherlands. THE BUILD BUSINESS SEGMENT The Build business segment comprises all products and solutions that deal with commercial and technical cost and work invoicing; cost and deadline planning; and calls for tenders, assignment and invoicing of construction work. They cover the actual construction process – from project cost planning and technical building site management through to commercial construction invoicing. The Build business segment, which has to date concentrated on German-speaking markets, includes Nemetschek Bausoftware GmbH, the Austrian company Auer – Die Bausoftware GmbH and the Allplan BCM product line of Nemetschek Allplan GmbH. They operate primarily in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Together, they have over 8,000 customers from the areas of design (architects and engineers) and construction management as well as construction companies, and support more than 50,000 user licenses. Auer – Die Bausoftware GmbH is the undisputed market leader in Austria. Nemetschek Bausoftware GmbH, with its primarily commercial solutions, has a strong position in Germany and, in its target group of larger medium- sized construction companies, is market leader in Switzerland. In 2012 a new con- In 2010 the Nemetschek Construction Group intensiﬁed its collaboration and reinforced its group presence in struction software is the market. Together, the group developed a new integrated generation of building software which is due on due on the market the market in 2012. The new software will combine the functionality of the new technical project management which integrates the and commercial management in one program. It will also enable the cloud application to be available for use technical project via the Internet. processing with the commercial view THE MANAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT The Manage business segment consists of Nemetschek Crem Solutions. Its product portfolio aims at commer- cial real estate and the housing industry for the management and settlement of real estate and property. The main product, iX-Haus 2010, is an integrated solution for the management of large assets with complex business requirements. The business segment also offers software for the management of real estate compa- nies and large property managers, as well as the management of commercial real estate. For the implementation of its solutions, the company follows an integrated approach from process analysis, through adaptation to customer requirements, as well as user training. Since the 2010 version iX-Haus has been supplied with a new module with which the demanding reporting requirements of foreign investors can also be presented without any problems. THE MULTIMEDIA BUSINESS SEGMENT The Multimedia business segment comprises the Maxon headquarters in Germany and its subsidiaries in the USA and United Kingdom as well as representatives in France and Japan. As a vendor of professional 3D soft- ware for visualization and animation, Maxon focuses on closeness to the customer and ease of product use. The software, which is available in 10 languages, is marketed in over 80 countries. Thanks to the numerous areas of application for the CINEMA 4D software and the heterogeneous customer structure – from architecture ofﬁces to ﬁlm studios – Maxon is comparatively independent from individual industries. In September 2010 Maxon introduced its newest update of Cinema 4D to the market. Thanks to many improvements in rendering, the current version has, above all, optimal picture quality. The product structure has been signiﬁcantly stream- lined. There are now only four different product packages which are tailored to the relevant demands of the different customer groups, such as architects, designers, motion graphics artists and professional 3D animators.\n\n35. CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NEMETSCHEK SPECIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NEMETSCHEK AG The Company Strategy and market position LEADING IN EUROPE Since the acquisition of its largest European competitor, Graphisoft, in 2007, Nemetschek has been Europe’s leading vendor of software for architects, engineers and the construction industry and wants to continue to generate proﬁtable growth. Worldwide, the group is number two behind US vendor Autodesk. The industry has undergone a process of consolidation in which Nemetschek was actively involved. Today, there are now just a few international players. In contrast, there are numerous small, local providers, which make up a good half of the market volume. This reﬂects the markedly heterogeneous nature of the market, which is characte- rized by the numerous disciplines involved in the building process, different philosophies and different regional rules and standards. CLOSENESS TO CUSTOMER‘S REQUIREMENTS Unlike its competitors, Nemetschek concentrates on the AEC market (Architecture, Engineering, Construction). The Group solutions This is where the company has its roots, and is where it sees its future as an industry specialist. The group’s cover a major part of solutions cover a large part of the construction value chain, from planning and visualization and the actual the value added chain construction process to management – and this is another area in which Nemetschek stands out. To meet the wide range of customer demands, the group offers a broad range of “best-in-class“ solutions that are tailored to particular working methods and local requirements. No other supplier is closer to the needs of its clientele – this is part of the company’s mission and philosophy. In order to satisfy the numerous customer demands, Nemetschek relies on its cooperation with partners from the sector who, themselves, offer “best-in-class“ solutions in specialist areas – for example, in the area of service engineering. Here, the group focuses on data exchange formats independent of manufacturers such as IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and is active in its implementation. AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPLETE LIFE CYLE OF A BUILDING A central topic in the building sector is so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM). This term, which is sometimes interpreted in various ways, means, as deﬁned by the industry organization buildingSmart, the “integrated process of designing, building and managing“, with the objective of increasing quality and efﬁciency of the whole process. Such an integrated philosophy has been associated with Nemetschek AG since it went public – and is clearly reﬂected in the business segments of Design, Build and Manage. One decisive basic prerequisite for BIM is the smooth exchange of data. This challenge has pre-occupied the building industry for a long time. However, the data exchange formats available, e.g., the IFC format, which is independent of manufactures and is supported by Nemetschek – do not include important communicative and collaborative functions, for example, those that allow the user to determine which project participants have received, read or potentially changed or approved which information, and when they have done so. It is exactly on these collaborative additional functions that Nemetschek is focusing within research and development on group level. These are going to be made available via a new cooperation platform in the internet which is closely linked to the data exchanged via IFC. In this area, new opportunities present them- selves within the trend for cloud computing, which the group is determined to use (see also the comments in the section on Research and Development and under Nemetschek Special). The data model which exists on the planned cooperation platform should enable the step-by-step integration of the services of all technical areas involved and cover the entire value added chain, from building to facility management. Thus, the focus is not only on the building process itself but also on the whole life cycle of a building – exactly true to the vision formulated in the 90‘s by the company‘s founder, Prof. Georg Nemetschek. This is also fundamentally important with regard to environmentally friendly building. After all, 80 % of all decisions relating to a building’s future energy requirements are made early on in the design phase. Around the world, 31\n\n36. requirements relating to the sustainability of buildings are increasing, which poses signiﬁcant challenges for designers and construction companies. The Nemetschek Group sees its central task as making it easier for its customers to overcome these challenges and providing them with the tools they need. Corporate responsibility For Nemetschek, corporate responsibility means providing its customers with the best possible support, ﬁnding future-oriented solutions, developing its employees within the company and in general meeting high ethical standards. In doing so, the company adds value for customers, employees, shareholders and society. Manage- ment is convinced that Nemetschek’s business is based on sustainability. Three aspects are at the forefront of this: the environment, employees and society. FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION With its software solutions, Nemetschek plays an important role in helping to make the building process more efﬁcient and sustainable. The solutions help architects and engineers to design energy-efﬁcient buildings and minimize material consumption. All CAD suppliers under Nemetschek‘s roof have integrated appropriate solutions in their programs. With its solutions, With Ecodesigner from Graphisoft, architects are, for example, already able to determine the likely energy Nemetschek plays an requirements of their buildings in the early design phase and compare different designs with each other. This important role in program has won several awards, for example, the British Construction Computing Magazine‘s “Environmental making the building Product of the Year“ 2009. On the other hand, Allplan follows a somewhat different approach. With this process more efﬁcient solution, architects and engineers can offer their clients a diverse spectrum of advice. The program consists and sustainable of applications for the initial analysis of the future energy requirement of buildings, as well as modules for the creation of energy certiﬁcates to comply with the standards of selected countries. There are also simulation programs for equipping a building with solar and photovoltaic systems and online access to funding databases. Even beyond its own products, the group is committed to the topic of sustainable building. Nemetschek is an active member of the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB), which developed the German Sustainable Building Certiﬁcate and awards it together with the German Federal Ministry of Trafﬁc, Building and Urban Affairs (BMVBS). Environmental protection is also taken seriously within the company. For example, almost all portfolio com- panies use video conferences in order to reduce the number of business trips to a minimum. They are also increasingly using innovative teaching methods such as e-learning and learning videos instead of printed manuals and operating instructions, which clearly minimizes the consumption of paper. Also the sending of DVD‘s is gradually being replaced by the availability of download possibilities from the Internet. Additionally, there are various individual initiatives in portfolio companies, e.g., an internal “eco drive“ competition at Nemetschek Scia for reducing petrol consumption. RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY The focus is on The companies in the group make every effort to provide their employees with the best possible working offering more ﬂexible conditions and the opportunity to achieve a good work/life balance. The focus here is on offering ﬂexible working times and a working times and a comprehensive continuing education program. The concrete conditions vary from country comprehensive to country. In the larger companies there are various additional special beneﬁts, such as, for example, subsidies continuing education for canteen meals. program For Nemetschek it is natural to treat employees of both sexes equally in terms of salary, and there are several examples of women in leading management positions. The Nemetschek Group places great importance on treating its employees correctly and on maintaining a good working relationship. The principles for this are laid down in the internal code of conduct and are made accessible to employees, together with other aspects, in special internal training courses.\n\n37.
