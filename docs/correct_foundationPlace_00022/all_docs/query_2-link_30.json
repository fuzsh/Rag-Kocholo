        "text": "ABOUT LLOYD ARCHITECTS\n\n‘Building From Here’\n\nThe award-winning Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm, Lloyd Architects follows a mantra of “building from here” – which for them means to focus intently on specific sites related to a community or a location. This mantra shifts as needed whether the firm is designing a mountain cabin, a residential property, or a redeveloped historic site.\n\nIn perhaps a fitting connection to that mantra and manner of working, Lloyd Architects recently played a major role in bringing new life into a property that for decades sat dormant. The location? A collection of buildings, the oldest dating to 1891, in the warehouse/railroad district of Salt Lake. The area is connected to two Union Pacific rail lines and was the base of operations for rail service a century ago.\n\nThe goal? Transform that 19th century warehouse into a 21st century destination, complete with retail offerings, activities, and recreation, as well as hospitality.\n\nThe life cycle of this project included that period we’ve all experienced when the Covid-19 pandemic slowed things down. At the time, the owners took that pause to reevaluate and come to an understanding about long term impacts to the retail market post-Covid. There were many unknowns facing all stakeholders. Their solution may surprise you.\n\n“One of the stories I like to share about this project is that after that Covid pause, the owners came back to us and said, ‘We’ve figured out how to make the project work – we need you to find us 18 more hotel rooms’ Simple enough, and good news that they’re adding more rooms, right? Not that simple, with a historic building, you can’t just rip off the roof and rebuild it to add those rooms.”\n\nWe’ve figured out how to make the project work – we need you to find us 18 more hotel rooms.\n\nLloyd says their solution was the “craziest idea” they’d come up with on this project. They tucked rooms in between the original trusses. It meant they needed a corridor to get over the bottom chord of the trusses. Evaluating this option in Archicad showed that it did not provide enough space."
