        "text": "Parul Dubey on November 23, 2022 - in News, Products, Technology\n\nThe Nemetschek Group brand Solibri today announced the launch of a service offering (c) Solibri\n\nMunich/Helsinki – The Nemetschek Group brand Solibri today announced the launch of a new cloud-based service offering: Solibri Inside. The SaaS (Software-as-a-service) based solution provides in-design model checking for users of Allplan, Graphisoft Archicad, and Vectorworks, further improving the quality of digital construction. Integrating this solution into the Nemetschek authoring tools is another step towards a more open, efficient and sustainable construction lifecycle.\n\nCreated as a solution for designers, Solibri Inside works as a native feature that can be used within the authoring tool and can run checks within a SaaS based environment whenever the designer wishes. With the tool, the designer does not need to export the model and open other software to perform model checking. The innovative solution comes inbuilt within Nemetschek authoring tools Allplan, Graphisoft Archicad and Vectorworks and can be easily accessed directly in the user interface of the authoring tool. The integrated quality checking significantly saves time for the designer, ensuring all details are correct, before submitting the BIM to the coordination workflow.\n\n“Solibri’s solution offering in BIM quality assurance has always been pivotal in developing and promoting OPEN BIM. Designers can focus on their core work, and yet trust that it is both buildable and ready for sharing. This is something that drives this industry in the right direction. Again, we see Nemetschek Group driving positive industry change”, says Viktor Várkonyi, Chief Division Officer for the Planning & Design Division and member of the Executive Board at the Nemetschek Group.\n\n“Solibri’s mission is to improve the quality of digital construction, it is fully dependent on quality and information content in the BIM. Today we are taking a leap forward in addressing the quality of model to make it better the first time around, reducing the iterations. This will save time and effort and give more time for designer to focus on the things they enjoy doing the most”, adds Ville Kyytsönen, CEO of Solibri.\n\nThe first release of Solibri Inside allows checking of Door & Window clearances and the supporting Level of Information (LOI). The service comes as a standard free package within Allplan, Graphisoft Archicad, and Vectorworks. The Premium paid package gives access to additional features.\n\nAbout the Nemetschek Group\n\nThe Nemetschek Group is a pioneer for digital transformation in the AEC/O and the media & entertainment industries.
