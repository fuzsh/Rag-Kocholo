But, I just want to make sure you realize that modules do NOT have to come from a separate file. Self-linking has always been possible and the easiest way to handle some situations. Further, self-linked modules never have issues with Attribute coordination, the biggest problem with external hotlinks.\n\nSome self-linking hotlinks can be handled without any special view settings. For example, a structure where certain floors/stories are clones of another story can simply hotlink the desired story onto the target story.\n\nOther module content that is placed randomly throughout the project but which should be identical in all places - can be placed on its own story. Many of us create these as negative stories - below the foundation, and then change the view settings for all sections / elevations / 3D to ignore these hidden stories. Then you can edit the module on that special sub-story and the hotlinks to it will update throughout the project. In choosing to use this approach, it makes sense that the module is reasonably unique to the current project. Modules that you would re-use across lots of projects probably are best placed in their own files.\n\nFinally, do not forget Publisher, which can publish MOD files from a project. Thus, you can have modules in sub-stories that are linked into the current project directly... but for which a Publisher set will also generate MOD files to be used in other projects...for as many modules as you create in the file.\n\nPlaced-module update is not automatic with self-linked hotlinks, so you still need to go to Hotlink Module Manager after changing your sub-story content and click Update to update all placed instances... or right-click a placed module and click Hotlink Module > Update Module and all related Hotlinks as seen in this screenshot:\n\nPS One more caveat besides manual update (or auto-update on re-opening the file): the self-hotlink does not come from the live/open file, but from the last version saved on disk (or published by TW). So, if you make changes to a self-linked module on negative story... you must save the PLN before doing the Update Module. üëç\n\nhttps://help.graphisoft.com/AC/26/INT/index.htm?rhcsh=1&rhnewwnd=0&rhmapid=#t=_AC26_Help%2F080_Colla...\n\nInstead of seperate stories, we use a 'workspace' to the side of floorplan. We put a polyline around each module and type the name below it, so it is easy to see which 'module' you are changing.\n\nWe have a saved view that zooms to the workspace and has all the relevant layers turned on.\n\nThen it is just a matter of using trace and reference to see the module in relation to the model and selecting the parts to save the module each time after you made changes.\n\nThis works well for single story modules. For multiple stories, you would have to use the marquee tool.\n\nTo exclude the elements from schedules, we 'pin' the elements to a custom renovation filter. You 'unpin' them when making changes and then 'pin' again.\n\nIs this better than editing in place? NO! but still, it might be better than your current workflow.\n\nStefan asked me in a PM to explain our method a bit more, rather than keep it in PM, I figured it might be interesting for more people.\n\nQuick screen shot of the 'workplace'. On the top left of the navigator, you can see our saved view (MOD Module Werkplaats). After opening that, you scroll / zoom to the module you want to change, in this case 'PLG_A' (shorthand for floorplan A). We select the elements and then 'unpin' them on the top right, so they are no longer linked to the custom renovation filter.\n\nNext, make your changes, you can use trace and reference to see the module in relation to the model. When you're done making changes, selec the elements again and then save (and overwrite) the module file. After that, 'pin' the elements back to the filter, update modules and you are done.\n\nPerks:\n\nno need to manage attributes across files\n\neasy to copy around elements between multiple modules\n\neasy to edit module in relation to the model"
