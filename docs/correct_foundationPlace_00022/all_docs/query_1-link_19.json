        "text": "Goerg Nemetschek Institute of Artificial Intelligence for the Built World\n\nConceiving, designing, and sustaining the built environment are among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The use of the latest modern computer technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning offer completely new possibilities for ecologically and economically sustainable solutions to this challenge. Thanks to a generous donation of the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation, TUM has founded the „TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute Artificial Intelligence for the Built World“ to conduct research on this future-oriented technological focus area."
