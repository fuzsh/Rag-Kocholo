        "text": "Abstract\n\nManipulating the polarization of light at the nanoscale is key to the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices. This is typically done via waveplates using optically anisotropic crystals, with thicknesses on the order of the wavelength. Here, using a novel ultrafast electron-beam-based technique sensitive to transient near fields at THz frequencies, we observe a giant anisotropy in the linear optical response in the semimetal WTe2 and demonstrate that one can tune the THz polarization using a 50 nm thick film, acting as a broadband wave plate with thickness 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength. The observed circular deflections of the electron beam are consistent with simulations tracking the trajectory of the electron beam in the near field of the THz pulse. This finding offers a promising approach to enable atomically thin THz polarization control using anisotropic semimetals and defines new approaches for characterizing THz near-field optical response at far-subwavelength length scales.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c00758\n\nView details for PubMedID 38717626\n\nAbstract\n\nThe formation of charge density waves is a long-standing open problem, particularly in dimensions higher than one. Various observations in the vanadium antimonides discovered recently further underpin this notion. Here, we study the Kagome metal CsV3Sb5 using polarized inelastic light scattering and density functional theory calculations. We observe a significant gap anisotropy with 2 Delta max / k B T CDW 20 , far beyond the prediction of mean-field theory. The analysis of the A1g and E2g phonons, including those emerging below TCDW, indicates strong phonon-phonon coupling, presumably mediated by a strong electron-phonon interaction. Similarly, the asymmetric Fano-type lineshape of the A1g amplitude mode suggests strong electron-phonon coupling below TCDW. The large electronic gap, the enhanced anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling, and the Fano shape of the amplitude mode combined are more supportive of a strong-coupling phonon-driven charge density wave transition than of a Fermi surface instability or an exotic mechanism in CsV3Sb5.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-024-45865-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 38429269\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have investigated the 3d orbital excitations in CaCuO_{2} (CCO), Nd_{2}CuO_{4} (NCO), and La_{2}CuO_{4} (LCO) using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. In LCO they behave as well-localized excitations, similarly to several other cuprates. On the contrary, in CCO and NCO the d_{xy} orbital clearly disperses, pointing to a collective character of this excitation (orbiton) in compounds without apical oxygen. We ascribe the origin of the dispersion as stemming from a substantial next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) orbital superexchange. Such an exchange leads to the liberation of the orbiton from its coupling to magnons, which is associated with the orbiton hopping between nearest neighbor copper sites. Finally, we show that the exceptionally large NNN orbital superexchange can be traced back to the absence of apical oxygens suppressing the charge transfer energy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.066004\n\nView details for PubMedID 38394564\n\nAbstract\n\nMany metallic quantum materials display anomalous transport phenomena that defy a Fermi liquid description. Here, we use numerical methods to calculate thermal and charge transport in the doped Hubbard model and observe a crossover separating high- and low-temperature behaviors. Distinct from the behavior at high temperatures, the Lorenz number [Formula: see text] becomes weakly doping dependent and less sensitive to parameters at low temperatures. At the lowest numerically accessible temperatures, [Formula: see text] roughly approaches the Wiedemann-Franz constant [Formula: see text], even in a doped Mott insulator that lacks well-defined quasiparticles. Decomposing the energy current operator indicates a compensation between kinetic and potential contributions, which may help to clarify the interpretation of transport experiments beyond Boltzmann theory in strongly correlated metals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.ade3232\n\nView details for PubMedID 38033050\n\nAbstract\n\nAs primarily an electronic observable, the room-temperature thermopower S in cuprates provides possibilities for a quantitative assessment of the Hubbard model. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we demonstrate agreement between Hubbard model calculations and experimentally measured room-temperature S across multiple cuprate families, both qualitatively in terms of the doping dependence and quantitatively in terms of magnitude. We observe an upturn in S with decreasing temperatures, which possesses a slope comparable to that observed experimentally in cuprates. From our calculations, the doping at which S changes sign occurs in close proximity to a vanishing temperature dependence of the chemical potential at fixed density. Our results emphasize the importance of interaction effects in the systematic assessment of the thermopower S in cuprates.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-42772-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 37923746\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10624669\n\nAbstract\n\nThe field of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism has been proliferating over the past few years, with ongoing interests in basic science and potential applications in spintronic technology. However, a high-resolution spectroscopic study of the 2D ferromagnet is still lacking due to the small size and air sensitivity of the exfoliated nanoflakes. Here, we report a thickness-dependent ferromagnetism in epitaxially grown Cr2Te3 thin films and investigate the evolution of the underlying electronic structure by synergistic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principle calculations. A conspicuous ferromagnetic transition from Stoner to Heisenberg-type is directly observed in the atomically thin limit, indicating that dimensionality is a powerful tuning knob to manipulate the novel properties of 2D magnetism. Monolayer Cr2Te3 retains robust ferromagnetism, but with a suppressed Curie temperature, due to the drastic drop in the density of states near the Fermi level. Our results establish atomically thin Cr2Te3 as an excellent platform to explore the dual nature of localized and itinerant ferromagnetism in 2D magnets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-40997-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 37660171\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10475109\n\nAbstract\n\nThe appearance of certain spectral features in one-dimensional (1D) cuprate materials has been attributed to a strong, extended attractive coupling between electrons. Here, using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group methods on a Hubbard-extended Holstein model, we show that extended electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling presents an obvious choice to produce such an attractive interaction that reproduces the observed spectral features and doping dependence seen in angle-resolved photoemission experiments: diminished 3kF spectral weight, prominent spectral intensity of a holon-folding branch, and the correct holon band width. While extended e-ph coupling does not qualitatively alter the ground state of the 1D system compared to the Hubbard model, it quantitatively enhances the long-range superconducting correlations and suppresses spin correlations. Such an extended e-ph interaction may be an important missing ingredient in describing the physics of the structurally similar two-dimensional high-temperature superconducting layered cuprates, which may tip the balance between intertwined orders in favor of uniform d-wave superconductivity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-38408-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 37253739\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10229634\n\nAbstract\n\nThe search for superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates was motivated by analogy to the cuprates, and this perspective has framed much of the initial consideration of this material. However, a growing number of studies have highlighted the involvement of rare-earth orbitals; in that context, the consequences of varying the rare-earth element in the superconducting nickelates have been much debated. Here, we show notable differences in the magnitude and anisotropy of the superconducting upper critical field across the La-, Pr-, and Nd-nickelates. These distinctions originate from the 4f electron characteristics of the rare-earth ions in the lattice: They are absent for La3+, nonmagnetic for the Pr3+ singlet ground state, and magnetic for the Nd3+ Kramer's doublet. The unique polar and azimuthal angle-dependent magnetoresistance found in the Nd-nickelates can be understood to arise from the magnetic contribution of the Nd3+ 4f moments. Such robust and tunable superconductivity suggests potential in future high-field applications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/sciadv.adf6655\n\nView details for PubMedID 37196089\n\nAbstract\n\nThe excitonic insulator (EI) is a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons bound by electron-hole interaction in a solid, which could support high-temperature BEC transition. The material realization of EI has been challenged by the difficulty of distinguishing it from a conventional charge density wave (CDW) state. In the BEC limit, the preformed exciton gas phase is a hallmark to distinguish EI from conventional CDW, yet direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here we report a distinct correlated phase beyond the 2×2 CDW ground state emerging in monolayer 1T-ZrTe2 and its investigation by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The results show novel band- and energy-dependent folding behavior in a two-step process, which is the signatures of an exciton gas phase prior to its condensation into the final CDW state. Our findings provide a versatile two-dimensional platform that allows tuning of the excitonic effect.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-36857-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36849499\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9971207\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Jahn-Teller effect, in which electronic configurations with energetically degenerate orbitals induce lattice distortions to lift this degeneracy, has a key role in many symmetry-lowering crystal deformations1. Lattices of Jahn-Teller ions can induce a cooperative distortion, as exemplified by LaMnO3 (refs. 2,3). Although many examples occur in octahedrally4 or tetrahedrally5 coordinated transition metal oxides due to their high orbital degeneracy, this effect has yet to be manifested for square-planar anion coordination, as found in infinite-layer copper6,7, nickel8,9, iron10,11 and manganese oxides12. Here we synthesize single-crystal CaCoO2 thin films by topotactic reduction of the brownmillerite CaCoO2.5 phase. We observe a markedly distorted infinite-layer structure, with angstrom-scale displacements of the cations from their high-symmetry positions. This can be understood to originate from the Jahn-Teller degeneracy of the dxz and dyz orbitals in the d7 electronic configuration along with substantial ligand-transition metal mixing. A complex pattern of distortions arises in a [Formula: see text] tetragonal supercell, reflecting the competition between an ordered Jahn-Teller effect on the CoO2 sublattice and the geometric frustration of the associated displacements of the Ca sublattice, which are strongly coupled in the absence of apical oxygen. As a result of this competition, the CaCoO2 structure forms an extended two-in-two-out type of Co distortion following 'ice rules'13.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-05681-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 36813969\n\nAbstract\n\nElectron-phonon interaction and related self-energy are fundamental to both the equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of solids. Although electron-phonon interaction has been suggested by various time-resolved measurements to be important for the relaxation dynamics of graphene, the lack of energy- and momentum-resolved self-energy dynamics prohibits direct identification of the role of specific phonon modes in the relaxation dynamics. Here, by performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Kekule-ordered graphene with folded Dirac cones at the Gamma point, we have succeeded in resolving the self-energy effect induced by the coupling of electrons to two phonons at Omega1 = 177 meV and Omega2 = 54 meV, and revealing its dynamical change in the time domain. Moreover, these strongly coupled phonons define energy thresholds, which separate the hierarchical relaxation dynamics from ultrafast, fast to slow, thereby providing direct experimental evidence for the dominant role of mode-specific phonons in the relaxation dynamics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/nsr/nwab175\n\nView details for PubMedID 35663240\n\nAbstract\n\nIn conventional superconductors, the phase transition into a zero-resistance and perfectly diamagnetic state is accompanied by a jump in the specific heat and the opening of a spectral gap1. In the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprates, although the transport, magnetic and thermodynamic signatures of Tc have been known since the 1980s2, the spectroscopic singularity associated with the transition remains unknown. Here we resolve this long-standing puzzle with a high-precision angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study on overdoped (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212). We first probe the momentum-resolved electronic specific heat via spectroscopy and reproduce the specific heat peak at Tc, completing the missing link for a holistic description of superconductivity. Then, by studying the full momentum, energy and temperature evolution of the spectra, we reveal that this thermodynamic anomaly arises from the singular growth of in-gap spectral intensity across Tc. Furthermore, we observe that the temperature evolution of in-gap intensity is highly anisotropic in the momentum space, and the gap itself obeys both the d-wave functional form and particle-hole symmetry. These findings support the scenario that the superconducting transition is driven by phase fluctuations. They also serve as an anchor point for understanding the Fermi arc and pseudogap phenomena in underdoped cuprates.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-021-04251-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 35082417\n\nAbstract\n\nEstablishing a minimal microscopic model for cuprates is a key step towards the elucidation of a high-T_{c} mechanism. By a quantitative comparison with a recent in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement in doped 1D cuprate chains, our simulation identifies a crucial contribution from long-range electron-phonon coupling beyond standard Hubbard models. Using reasonable ranges of coupling strengths and phonon energies, we obtain a strong attractive interaction between neighboring electrons, whose strength is comparable to experimental observations. Nonlocal couplings play a significant role in the mediation of neighboring interactions. Considering the structural and chemical similarity between 1D and 2D cuprate materials, this minimal model with long-range electron-phonon coupling will provide important new insights on cuprate high-T_{c} superconductivity and related quantum phases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.197003\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000717968300004\n\nView details for PubMedID 34797146\n\nAbstract\n\nThe enhanced superconductivity in monolayer FeSe on titanates opens a fascinating pathway toward the rational design of high-temperature superconductors.

With the dramatic increase of electron accumulation at the LaTiO3/SrTiO3 surface, providing a substantial surge of work function mismatch across the FeSe/oxide interface, the charge transfer and the superconducting gap in the monolayer FeSe are found to remain markedly robust.

We demonstrate the preservation of a black CsPbI3 perovskite structure to room temperature by subjecting the δ phase to pressures of 0.1 - 0.6 GPa followed by heating and rapid cooling. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy indicate that this perovskite phase is consistent with orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3. Once formed, γ-CsPbI3 could be then retained after releasing pressure to ambient conditions and shows substantial stability at 35% relative humidity. First-principles density functional theory calculations indicate that compression directs the out-of-phase and in-phase tilt between the [PbI6]4- octahedra which in turn tune the energy difference between δ- and γ-CsPbI3, leading to the preservation of γ-CsPbI3. Here, we present a high-pressure strategy for manipulating the (meta)stability of halide perovskites for the synthesis of desirable phases with enhanced materials functionality.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-020-20745-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 33469021\n\nAbstract\n\nStabilizing high-valent redox couples and exotic electronic states necessitate an understanding of the stabilization mechanism. In oxides, whether they are being considered for energy storage or computing, highly oxidized oxide-anion species rehybridize to form short covalent bonds and are related to significant local structural distortions. In intercalation oxide electrodes for batteries, while such reorganization partially stabilizes oxygen redox, it also gives rise to substantial hysteresis. In this work, we investigate oxygen redox in layered Na2-XMn3O7, a positive electrode material with ordered Mn vacancies. We prove that coulombic interactions between oxidized oxideanions and the interlayer Na vacancies can disfavor rehybridization and stabilize hole polarons on oxygen (O-) at 4.2 V vs. Na/Na+. These coulombic interactions provide thermodynamic energy saving as large as O-O covalent bonding and enable ~ 40 mV voltage hysteresis over multiple electrochemical cycles with negligible voltage fade. Our results establish a complete picture of redox energetics by highlighting the role of coulombic interactions across several atomic distances and suggest avenues to stabilize highly oxidized oxygen for applications in energy storage and beyond.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1ee01037a\n\nView details for PubMedID 37719447\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10502899\n\nAbstract\n\nTime-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is one of the developing techniques enabled by the advent of X-ray free electron laser (FEL). It is important to evaluate how the FEL jitter, which is inherent in the self-amplified spontaneous emission process, influences the RIXS measurement. Here, we use a microchannel plate (MCP) based Timepix softX-ray detector to conduct a time-resolved RIXS measurement at the Ti L3-edge on a charge-density-wave material TiSe2. The fast parallel Timepix readout and single photon sensitivity enable pulse-by-pulse data acquisition and analysis. Due to the FEL jitter, low detection efficiency of spectrometer, and low quantum yield of RIXS process, we find that less than 2% of the X-ray FEL pulses produce signals, preventing acquiring sufficient data statistics while maintaining temporal and energy resolution in this measurement. These limitations can be mitigated by using future X-ray FELs with high repetition rates, approaching MHz such as the European XFEL in Germany and LCLS-II in the USA, as well as by utilizing advanced detectors, such as the prototype used in this study.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-020-79210-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 33335197\n\nAbstract\n\nThe resistance of a conventional insulator diverges as temperature approaches zero. The peculiar low-temperature resistivity saturation in the 4f Kondo insulator (KI) SmB6 has spurred proposals of a correlation-driven topological Kondo insulator (TKI) with exotic ground states. However, the scarcity of model TKI material families leaves difficulties in disentangling key ingredients from irrelevant details. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study FeSb2, a correlated d-electron KI candidate that also exhibits a low-temperature resistivity saturation. On the (010) surface, we find a rich assemblage of metallic states with two-dimensional dispersion. Measurements of the bulk band structure reveal band renormalization, a large temperature-dependent band shift, and flat spectral features along certain high-symmetry directions, providing spectroscopic evidence for strong correlations.

Here, we report on the use of diamondoids (diamond-like, saturated hydrocarbons) as promising precursors for laser-induced high-pressure, high-temperature diamond synthesis. The lowest pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions that yielded diamond were 12 GPa (at ~2000 K) and 900 K (at ~20 GPa), respectively. This represents a substantially reduced transformation barrier compared with diamond synthesis from conventional (hydro)carbon allotropes, owing to the similarities in the structure and full sp3 hybridization of diamondoids and bulk diamond. At 20 GPa, diamondoid-to-diamond conversion occurs rapidly within <19 μs. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that once dehydrogenated, the remaining diamondoid carbon cages reconstruct themselves into diamond-like structures at high P-T. This study is the first successful mapping of the P-T conditions and onset timing of the diamondoid-to-diamond conversion and elucidates the physical and chemical factors that facilitate diamond synthesis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/sciadv.aay9405\n\nView details for PubMedID 32128417\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7034983\n\nAbstract\n\nRealizing a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state in a real material is a leading issue in condensed matter physics research. In this pursuit, it is crucial to fully characterize the structure and influence of defects, as these can significantly affect the fragile QSL physics. Here, we perform a variety of cutting-edge synchrotron X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, and we advance new methodologies for site-specific diffraction and L-edge Zn absorption spectroscopy. The experimental results along with our first-principles calculations address outstanding questions about the local and long-range structures of the two leading kagome QSL candidates, Zn-substituted barlowite (Cu3Zn x Cu1-x (OH)6FBr) and herbertsmithite (Cu3Zn(OH)6Cl2). On all length scales probed, there is no evidence that Zn substitutes onto the kagome layers, thereby preserving the QSL physics of the kagome lattice. Our calculations show that antisite disorder is not energetically favorable and is even less favorable in Zn-barlowite compared to herbertsmithite. Site-specific X-ray diffraction measurements of Zn-barlowite reveal that Cu2+ and Zn2+ selectively occupy distinct interlayer sites, in contrast to herbertsmithite. Using the first measured Zn L-edge inelastic X-ray absorption spectra combined with calculations, we discover a systematic correlation between the loss of inversion symmetry from pseudo-octahedral (herbertsmithite) to trigonal prismatic coordination (Zn-barlowite) with the emergence of a new peak. Overall, our measurements suggest that Zn-barlowite has structural advantages over herbertsmithite that make its magnetic properties closer to an ideal QSL candidate: its kagome layers are highly resistant to nonmagnetic defects while the interlayers can accommodate a higher amount of Zn substitution.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/physrevmaterials.4.124406\n\nView details for PubMedID 34095744\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8174140\n\nAbstract\n\nThe bilayer Hubbard model with electron-hole doping is an ideal platform to study excitonic orders due to suppressed recombination via spatial separation of electrons and holes. However, suffering from the sign problem, previous quantum Monte Carlo studies could not arrive at an unequivocal conclusion regarding the presence of phases with clear signatures of excitonic condensation in bilayer Hubbard models. Here, we develop a determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for the bilayer Hubbard model that is sign-problem-free for equal and opposite doping in the two layers and study excitonic order and charge and spin density modulations as a function of chemical potential difference between the two layers, on-site Coulomb repulsion, and interlayer interaction. In the intermediate coupling regime and in proximity to the SU(4)-symmetric point, we find a biexcitonic condensate phase at finite electron-hole doping, as well as a competing (π,π) charge density wave state.

Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A-O-A' local configuration in the pristine materials (where A= Na and A'= Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.).

In electron-doped cuprate Nd2-x Ce x CuO4 (NCCO), an unexpected FS reconstruction has been observed in optimal- and overdoped regime (x = 0.15-0.17) by quantum oscillation measurements (QOM). This is all the more puzzling because neutron scattering suggests that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order, which is believed to reconstruct the FS, vanishes before x = 0.14. To reconcile the conflict, a widely discussed external magnetic-field-induced AFM long-range order in QOM explains the FS reconstruction as an extrinsic property. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) evidence of FS reconstruction in optimal- and overdoped NCCO. The observed FSs are in quantitative agreement with QOM, suggesting an intrinsic FS reconstruction without field. This reconstructed FS, despite its importance as a basis to understand electron-doped cuprates, cannot be explained under the traditional scheme. Furthermore, the energy gap of the reconstruction decreases rapidly near x = 0.17 like an order parameter, echoing the quantum critical doping in transport. The totality of the data points to a mysterious order between x = 0.14 and 0.17, whose appearance favors the FS reconstruction and disappearance defines the quantum critical doping.

Manipulating the topological invariants in these materials would allow the development of topological switching applications analogous to switching of transistors6. Lattice strain provides the most natural means of tuning these topological invariants because it directly modifies the electron-ion interactions and potentially alters the underlying crystalline symmetry on which the topological properties depend7-9. However, conventional means of applying strain through heteroepitaxial lattice mismatch10 and dislocations11 are not extendable to controllable time-varying protocols, which are required in transistors. Integration into a functional device requires the ability to go beyond the robust, topologically protected properties of materials and to manipulate the topology at high speeds. Here we use crystallographic measurements by relativistic electron diffraction to demonstrate that terahertz light pulses can be used to induce terahertz-frequency interlayer shear strain with large strain amplitude in the Weyl semimetal WTe2, leading to a topologically distinct metastable phase. Separate nonlinear optical measurements indicate that this transition is associated with a symmetry change to a centrosymmetric, topologically trivial phase. We further show that such shear strain provides an ultrafast, energy-efficient way of inducing robust, well separated Weyl points or of annihilating all Weyl points of opposite chirality. This work demonstrates possibilities for ultrafast manipulation of the topological properties of solids and for the development of a topological switch operating at terahertz frequencies.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30602749\n\nAbstract\n\nIn normal metals, macroscopic properties are understood using the concept of quasiparticles. In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the metallic state above the highest transition temperature is anomalous and is known as the \"strange metal.\" We studied this state using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. With increasing doping across a temperature-independent critical value pc ~ 0.19, we observed that near the Brillouin zone boundary, the strange metal, characterized by an incoherent spectral function, abruptly reconstructs into a more conventional metal with quasiparticles. Above the temperature of superconducting fluctuations, we found that the pseudogap also discontinuously collapses at the very same value of pc These observations suggest that the incoherent strange metal is a distinct state and a prerequisite for the pseudogap; such findings are incompatible with existing pseudogap quantum critical point scenarios.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aaw8850\n\nView details for PubMedID 31780552\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the essential ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity. However, proving definitively that the model supports superconductivity is challenging. Here, we report a large-scale density matrix renormalization group study of the lightly doped Hubbard model on four-leg cylinders at hole doping concentration δ = 12.5%. We reveal a delicate interplay between superconductivity and charge density wave and spin density wave orders tunable via next-nearest neighbor hopping t'. For finite t', the ground state is consistent with a Luther-Emery liquid with power-law superconducting and charge density wave correlations associated with half-filled charge stripes. In contrast, for t' = 0, superconducting correlations fall off exponentially, whereas charge density and spin density modulations are dominant. Our results indicate that a route to robust long-range superconductivity involves destabilizing insulating charge stripes in the doped Hubbard model.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aal5304\n\nView details for PubMedID 31604270\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent debates on the oxygen redox behaviors in battery electrodes have triggered a pressing demand for the reliable detection and understanding of nondivalent oxygen states beyond conventional absorption spectroscopy. Here, enabled by high-efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) coupled with first-principles calculations, we report distinct mRIXS features of the oxygen states in Li2O, Li2CO3, and especially, Li2O2, which are successfully reproduced and interpreted theoretically. mRIXS signals are dominated by valence-band decays in Li2O and Li2CO3. However, the oxidized oxygen in Li2O2 leads to partially unoccupied O-2p states that yield a specific intraband excitonic feature in mRIXS. Such a feature displays a specific emission energy in mRIXS, which disentangles the oxidized oxygen states from the dominating transition-metal/oxygen hybridization features in absorption spectroscopy, thus providing critical hints for both detecting and understanding the oxygen redox reactions in transition-metal oxide based battery materials.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30354171\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding spin excitations and their connection to unconventional superconductivity have remained central issues since the discovery of cuprates. Direct measurement of the dynamical spin structure factor in the parent compounds can provide key information on important interactions relevant in the doped regime, and variations in the magnon dispersion have been linked closely to differences in crystal structure between families of cuprate compounds. Here, we elucidate the relationship between spin excitations and various controlling factors thought to be significant in high-T_{c} materials by systematically evaluating the dynamical spin structure factor for the three-orbital Hubbard model, revealing differences in the spin dispersion along the Brillouin zone axis and the diagonal. Generally, we find that the absolute energy scale and momentum dependence of the excitations primarily are sensitive to the effective charge-transfer energy, while changes in the on-site Coulomb interactions have little effect on the details of the dispersion. In particular, our result highlights the splitting between spin excitations along the axial and diagonal directions in the Brillouin zone. This splitting decreases with increasing charge-transfer energy and correlates with changes in the apical oxygen position, and general structural variations, for different cuprate families.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.246401\n\nView details for PubMedID 29956982\n\nAbstract\n\nThe nature of superconductivity in the dilute semiconductor SrTiO3 has remained an open question for more than 50 y. The extremely low carrier densities ([Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] cm-3) at which superconductivity occurs suggest an unconventional origin of superconductivity outside of the adiabatic limit on which the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theories are based. We take advantage of a newly developed method for engineering band alignments at oxide interfaces and access the electronic structure of Nb-doped SrTiO3, using high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy. We observe strong coupling to the highest-energy longitudinal optic (LO) phonon branch and estimate the doping evolution of the dimensionless electron-phonon interaction strength ([Formula: see text]). Upon cooling below the superconducting transition temperature ([Formula: see text]), we observe a single superconducting gap corresponding to the weak-coupling limit of BCS theory, indicating an order of magnitude smaller coupling ([Formula: see text]). These results suggest that despite the strong normal state interaction with electrons, the highest LO phonon does not provide a dominant contribution to pairing. They further demonstrate that SrTiO3 is an ideal system to probe superconductivity over a wide range of carrier density, adiabatic parameter, and electron-phonon coupling strength.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29382769\n\nAbstract\n\nvan der Waals heterostructures, vertical stacks of layered materials, offer new opportunities for novel quantum phenomena which are absent in their constituent components. Here we report the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at the interface of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures. Using nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe zone-corner replicas of h-BN valence band maxima, with energy spacing coincident with the highest phonon energy of the heterostructure, an indication of Fröhlich polaron formation due to forward-scattering electron-phonon coupling. Parabolic fitting of the h-BN bands yields an effective mass enhancement of ∼2.3, suggesting an intermediate coupling strength. Our theoretical simulations based on Migdal-Eliashberg theory corroborate the experimental results, allowing the extraction of microscopic physical parameters. Moreover, renormalization of graphene π-band is observed due to the hybridization with the h-BN band. Our work generalizes the polaron study from transition metal oxides to van der Waals heterostructures with higher material flexibility, highlighting interlayer coupling as an extra degree of freedom to explore emergent phenomena.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29302973\n\nAbstract\n\nUpon doping, Mott insulators often exhibit symmetry breaking where charge carriers and their spins organize into patterns known as stripes. For high-transition temperature cuprate superconductors, stripes are widely suspected to exist in a fluctuating form. We used numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the three-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of the copper-oxygen plane. Our results, which are robust to varying parameters, cluster size, and boundary conditions, support the interpretation of experimental observations such as the hourglass magnetic dispersion and the Yamada plot of incommensurability versus doping in terms of the physics of fluctuating stripes. These findings provide a different perspective on the intertwined orders emerging from the cuprates' normal state.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29191902\n\nAbstract\n\nThe search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated quantum magnets recently has enjoyed a surge of interest, with various candidate materials under intense scrutiny. However, an experimental confirmation of a gapped topological spin liquid remains an open question. Here, we show that circularly polarized light can provide a knob to drive frustrated Mott insulators into a chiral spin liquid, realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid with topological order. We find that the dynamics of a driven Kagome Mott insulator is well-captured by an effective Floquet spin model, with heating strongly suppressed, inducing a scalar spin chirality S i · (S j × S k ) term which dynamically breaks time-reversal while preserving SU(2) spin symmetry. We fingerprint the transient phase diagram and find a stable photo-induced chiral spin liquid near the equilibrium state.

It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a \"coherent lock-in\" measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28684521\n\nAbstract\n\nControlling inorganic structure and dimensionality through structure-directing agents is a versatile approach for new materials synthesis that has been used extensively for metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers. However, the lack of 'solid' inorganic cores requires charge transport through single-atom chains and/or organic groups, limiting their electronic properties. Here, we report that strongly interacting diamondoid structure-directing agents guide the growth of hybrid metal-organic chalcogenide nanowires with solid inorganic cores having three-atom cross-sections, representing the smallest possible nanowires. The strong van der Waals attraction between diamondoids overcomes steric repulsion leading to a cis configuration at the active growth front, enabling face-on addition of precursors for nanowire elongation. These nanowires have band-like electronic properties, low effective carrier masses and three orders-of-magnitude conductivity modulation by hole doping. This discovery highlights a previously unexplored regime of structure-directing agents compared with traditional surfactant, block copolymer or metal-organic framework linkers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nmat4823\n\nView details for PubMedID 28024157\n\nAbstract\n\nOver the past decade, the advances in grating-based soft X-ray spectrometers have revolutionized the soft X-ray spectroscopies in materials research. However, these novel spectrometers are mostly dedicated designs, which cannot be easily adopted for applications with diverging demands. Here we present a versatile spectrometer design concept based on the Hettrick-Underwood optical scheme that uses modular mechanical components. The spectrometer's optics chamber can be used with gratings operated in either inside or outside orders, and the detector assembly can be reconfigured accordingly. The spectrometer can be designed to have high spectral resolution, exceeding 10 000 resolving power when using small source (∼1μm) and detector pixels (∼5μm) with high line density gratings (∼3000 lines/mm), or high throughput at moderate resolution. We report two such spectrometers with slightly different design goals and optical parameters in this paper. We show that the spectrometer with high throughput and large energy window is particularly useful for studying the sustainable energy materials. We demonstrate that the extensive resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) map of battery cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 can be produced in few hours using such a spectrometer. Unlike analyzing only a handful of RIXS spectra taken at selected excitation photon energies across the elemental absorption edges to determine various spectral features like the localized dd excitations and non-resonant fluorescence emissions, these features can be easily identified in the RIXS maps. Studying such RIXS maps could reveal novel transition metal redox in battery compounds that are sometimes hard to be unambiguously identified in X-ray absorption and emission spectra. We propose that this modular spectrometer design can serve as the platform for further customization to meet specific scientific demands.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1063/1.4974356\n\nView details for PubMedID 28147697\n\nAbstract\n\nThe existence of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in cuprate superconductors has now been established. However, the nature of the CDW ground state has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of superconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to only a dozen unit cells or less. Here we explore the field-induced 3D CDW correlations in extremely pure detwinned crystals of YBa2Cu3O2 (YBCO) ortho-II and ortho-VIII at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical field ([Formula: see text]) where superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We observe that the 3D CDW is unidirectional and possesses a long in-plane correlation length as well as significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes. It is significant that we observe only a single sharply defined transition at a critical field proportional to [Formula: see text], given that the field range used in this investigation overlaps with other high-field experiments including quantum oscillation measurements. The correlation volume is at least two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume observed in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the high-field ground state of an \"ideal\" disorder-free cuprate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1612849113\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000390044900047\n\nView details for PubMedID 27930313\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5187671\n\nAbstract\n\nMonolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides are novel materials which at low energies constitute a condensed-matter realization of massive relativistic fermions in two dimensions.

In contrast to graphene and previously discussed toy models, the underlying mechanism relies on the intrinsic three-band nature of transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers near the band edges. Photo-induced band inversions scale linearly in applied pump field and exhibit transitions from one to two chiral edge modes on sweeping from red to blue detuning.

The Fermi surface topology and pairing symmetry are thus two pivotal characteristics of a superconductor. Superconductivity in one monolayer (1 ML) FeSe thin film has attracted great interest recently due to its intriguing interfacial properties and possibly high superconducting transition temperature over 65 K. Here, we report high-resolution measurements of the Fermi surface and superconducting gaps in 1 ML FeSe using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Two ellipselike electron pockets are clearly resolved overlapping with each other at the Brillouin zone corner. The superconducting gap is nodeless but moderately anisotropic, which puts strong constraint on determining the pairing symmetry. The gap maxima locate on the d_{xy} bands along the major axis of the ellipse and four gap minima are observed at the intersections of electron pockets. The gap maximum location combined with the Fermi surface geometry deviate from a single d-wave, extended s-wave or s_{±} gap function, suggesting an important role of the multiorbital nature of Fermi surface and orbital-dependent pairing in 1 ML FeSe. The gap minima location may be explained by a sign change on the electron pockets, or a competition between intra- and interorbital pairing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.117001\n\nView details for PubMedID 27661715\n\nAbstract\n\nSurfaces and interfaces offer new possibilities for tailoring the many-body interactions that dominate the electrical and thermal properties of transition metal oxides. Here, we use the prototypical two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) at the SrTiO3(001) surface to reveal a remarkably complex evolution of electron-phonon coupling with the tunable carrier density of this system. At low density, where superconductivity is found in the analogous 2DEL at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, our angle-resolved photoemission data show replica bands separated by 100 meV from the main bands. This is a hallmark of a coherent polaronic liquid and implies long-range coupling to a single longitudinal optical phonon branch. In the overdoped regime the preferential coupling to this branch decreases and the 2DEL undergoes a crossover to a more conventional metallic state with weaker short-range electron-phonon interaction. These results place constraints on the theoretical description of superconductivity and allow a unified understanding of the transport properties in SrTiO3-based 2DELs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/NMAT4623\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000380849200014\n\nView details for PubMedID 27064529\n\nAbstract\n\nCompetition between ordered phases, and their associated phase transitions, are significant in the study of strongly correlated systems.

Near a transition where spin and charge become strongly intertwined, we observe antiphase dynamics and a coupling-strength-dependent suppression or enhancement in the static structure factors. The renormalized bosonic excitations coupled to a particular photoexcited electron can be extracted, which provides an approach for characterizing the underlying bosonic modes. The results from this analysis for different electronic momenta show an uneven softening due to a stronger coupling near k_{F}.

Combining photon-energy and momentum dependent RIXS measurements with theoretical calculations using exact diagonalization provides conclusive evidence that the Raman-like RIXS excitations correspond to collective spin excitations, which are magnons in the undoped Mott insulators and evolve into paramagnons in doped superconducting compounds.

We performed systematic experimental and theoretical studies based on soft X-ray emission, absorption, and hard X-ray Raman spectroscopy of LixFePO4 nanoparticles and single crystals. The results clearly show a non-rigid electron-state reconfiguration of both the occupied and unoccupied Fe-3d and O-2p states during the (de)lithiation process. We focus on the energy configurations of the occupied states of LiFePO4 and the unoccupied states of FePO4, which are the critical states where electrons are removed and injected during the charge and discharge process, respectively. In LiFePO4, the soft X-ray emission spectroscopy shows that, due to the Coulomb repulsion effect, the occupied Fe-3d states with the minority spin sit close to the Fermi level. In FePO4, the soft X-ray absorption and hard X-ray Raman spectroscopy show that the unoccupied Fe-3d states again sit close to the Fermi level. These critical 3d electron state configurations are consistent with the calculations based on modified Becke and Johnson potentials GGA+U (MBJGGA+U) framework, which improves the overall lineshape prediction compared with the conventionally used GGA+U method.

The gap opening temperature usually sets the superconducting transition temperature Tc, as the gap signals the formation of Cooper pairs, the bound electron states responsible for superconductivity. To understand why Cooper pairs form at such high temperatures, we examine the role of the SrTiO3 substrate. Here we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results that reveal an unexpected characteristic of the single-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3 system: shake-off bands suggesting the presence of bosonic modes, most probably oxygen optical phonons in SrTiO3 (refs 5, 6, 7), which couple to the FeSe electrons with only a small momentum transfer. Such interfacial coupling assists superconductivity in most channels, including those mediated by spin fluctuations.

In the iron pnictides, these competing phases are marked by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition and a collinear spin-density wave (SDW) transition. There has been macroscopic evidence for competition between these phases and superconductivity as the magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment are suppressed in the superconducting state. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on detwinned underdoped Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe2As2, we observe a coexistence of both the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure. Furthermore, our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity, the SDW gap decreases in magnitude and shifts in a direction consistent with a reduction of the orbital anisotropy. This observation provides direct spectroscopic evidence for the dynamic competition between superconductivity and both SDW and electronic nematic orders in these materials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ncomms4711\n\nView details for PubMedID 24762657\n\nAbstract\n\nWe performed temperature dependent x-ray linear dichroism (XLD) experiments on an iron pnictide system, Ba(Fe(1-x)Co(x))2As2 with x=0.00, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.10 to experimentally verify the existence of orbital ordering (OO). Substantial XLD was observed in polarization dependent x-ray absorption spectra of Fe L edges. By exploiting the difference in the temperature dependent behaviors, OO, and structure contributions to XLD could be clearly separated. The observed OO signal indicates different occupation numbers for d(yz) and d(zx) orbitals and supports the existence of ferro-OO. The results are also consistent with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, we find substantial OO signal well above the structural and magnetic transition temperatures, which suggests the existence of strong OO fluctuations up to high temperatures.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.217001\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000327245600025\n\nView details for PubMedID 24313517\n\nAbstract\n\nWe examine electron-electron mediated relaxation following ultrafast electric field pump excitation of the fermionic degrees of freedom in the Falicov-Kimball model for correlated electrons. The results reveal a dichotomy in the temporal evolution of the system as one tunes through the Mott metal-to-insulator transition: in the metallic regime relaxation can be characterized by evolution toward a steady state well described by Fermi-Dirac statistics with an increased effective temperature; however, in the insulating regime this quasithermal paradigm breaks down with relaxation toward a nonthermal state with a complicated electronic distribution as a function of momentum. We characterize the behavior by studying changes in the energy, photoemission response, and electronic distribution as functions of time. This relaxation may be observable qualitatively on short enough time scales that the electrons behave like an isolated system not in contact with additional degrees of freedom which would act as a thermal bath, especially when using strong driving fields and studying materials whose physics may manifest the effects of correlations.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23992080\n\nAbstract\n\nWe investigate the order parameter dynamics of the stripe-ordered nickelate, La_{1.75}Sr_{0.25}NiO_{4}, using time-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction.

Deep in the antiferromagnetic state, the spectra exhibit a \"peak-dip-hump\" line shape associated with two clearly separate branches of dispersion, characteristics of polarons seen in manganites and lightly doped cuprates. As temperature increases towards the Néel temperature (T(N)), we observe a decreasing renormalization of the peak dispersion and a counterintuitive sharpening of the hump linewidth, suggestive of an intimate connection between the weakening electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and antiferromagnetism.

The ordering direction is widely believed to result from the Fermi surface topology. However, several recent studies indicate that this common view needs to be supplemented. Here, we show how an enhanced electron-lattice interaction can contribute to or even determine the selection of the ordering vector in the model charge density wave system ErTe(3). Our joint experimental and theoretical study allows us to establish a relation between the selection rules of the electronic light scattering spectra and the enhanced electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of band degeneracy points.

At half filling, we find a strong competition between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and charge-density-wave (CDW) order. We demonstrate that a simple picture of AFM-CDW competition that incorporates the phonon-mediated attraction into an effective-U Hubbard model requires significant refinement. Specifically, retardation effects slow the onset of charge order so that CDW order remains absent even when the effective U is negative. This delay opens a window where neither AFM nor CDW order is well established and where there are signatures of a possible metallic phase.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.246404\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000312068300027\n\nView details for PubMedID 23368352\n\nAbstract\n\nA detailed phenomenology of low energy excitations is a crucial starting point for microscopic understanding of complex materials, such as the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Because of its unique momentum-space discrimination, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is ideally suited for this task in the cuprates, where emergent phases, particularly superconductivity and the pseudogap, have anisotropic gap structure in momentum space. We present a comprehensive doping- and temperature-dependence ARPES study of spectral gaps in Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+δ), covering much of the superconducting portion of the phase diagram. In the ground state, abrupt changes in near-nodal gap phenomenology give spectroscopic evidence for two potential quantum critical points, p = 0.19 for the pseudogap phase and p = 0.076 for another competing phase. Temperature dependence reveals that the pseudogap is not static below T(c) and exists p > 0.19 at higher temperatures. Our data imply a revised phase diagram that reconciles conflicting reports about the endpoint of the pseudogap in the literature, incorporates phase competition between the superconducting gap and pseudogap, and highlights distinct physics at the edge of the superconducting dome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1209471109\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000311156700031\n\nView details for PubMedID 23093670\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3494935\n\nAbstract\n\nThe spectral response and physical features of the 2D Hubbard-Holstein model are calculated both in equilibrium at zero and low chemical dopings, and after an ultrashort powerful light pulse, in undoped systems. At equilibrium and at strong charge-lattice couplings, the optical conductivity reveals a three-peak structure in agreement with experimental observations. After an ultrashort pulse and at nonzero electron-phonon interaction, phonon and spin subsystems oscillate with the phonon period T(ph)≈80 fs. The decay time of the phonon oscillations is about 150-200 fs, similar to the relaxation time of the charge system. We propose a criterion for observing these oscillations in high T(c) compounds: the time span of the pump light pulse τ(pump) has to be shorter than the phonon oscillation period T(ph).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.176402\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000310200100023\n\nView details for PubMedID 23215207\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dynamics of an order parameter's amplitude and phase determines the collective behaviour of novel states emerging in complex materials. Time- and momentum-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, by virtue of measuring material properties at atomic and electronic time scales out of equilibrium, can decouple entangled degrees of freedom by visualizing their corresponding dynamics in the time domain. Here we combine time-resolved femotosecond optical and resonant X-ray diffraction measurements on charge ordered La(1.75)Sr(0.25)NiO(4) to reveal unforeseen photoinduced phase fluctuations of the charge order parameter. Such fluctuations preserve long-range order without creating topological defects, distinct from thermal phase fluctuations near the critical temperature in equilibrium. Importantly, relaxation of the phase fluctuations is found to be an order of magnitude slower than that of the order parameter's amplitude fluctuations, and thus limits charge order recovery. This new aspect of phase fluctuations provides a more holistic view of the phase's importance in ordering phenomena of quantum matter.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ncomms1837\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000304611400033\n\nView details for PubMedID 22588300\n\nAbstract\n\nThe prevalent view of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is that their essential low-energy physics is captured by local Coulomb interactions. However, this view been challenged recently by studies indicating the importance of longer-range components. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the importance of these components by examining the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction with acoustic phonons in connection with the recently discovered renormalization in the near-nodal low-energy (~8-15 meV) dispersion of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+δ). By studying its nontrivial momentum and doping dependence we conclude a predominance of forward scattering arising from the direct interplay between the e-ph and extended Coulomb interactions. Our results thus demonstrate how the low-energy renormalization can provide a pathway to new insights into how these interactions interplay with one another and influence pairing and dynamics in the cuprates.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.166404\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000303070600015\n\nView details for PubMedID 22680740\n\nAbstract\n\nKnowledge of the gap function is important to understand the pairing mechanism for high-temperature (T(c)) superconductivity. However, Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in the cuprates have reported contradictory gap functions, with FT-STS results deviating strongly from a canonical d(x2-y2) form. By applying an \"octet model\" analysis to autocorrelation ARPES, we reveal that a contradiction occurs because the octet model does not consider the effects of matrix elements and the pseudogap. This reaffirms the canonical d(x2-y2) superconducting gap around the node, which can be directly determined from ARPES. Further, our study suggests that the FT-STS reported fluctuating superconductivity around the node at far above T(c) is not necessary to explain the existence of the quasiparticle interference at low energy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.167003\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000290097500013\n\nView details for PubMedID 21599403\n\nAbstract\n\nThe improved resolution of laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) allows reliable access to fine structures in the spectrum.

In underdoped high-T(c) superconducting copper oxides, a pseudogap (whose relation to the superconducting gap remains a mystery) develops well above T(c) (refs 1, 2). Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above T(c) is one of the central questions in high-T(c) research. Although some experimental evidence suggests that the two gaps are distinct, this issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as function of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta in the momentum space region overlooked in previous measurements. Near the diagonal of Cu-O bond direction (nodal direction), we found a gap that opens at T(c) and has a canonical (BCS-like) temperature dependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov quasi-particles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp contrast to the pseudogap near the Cu-O bond direction (antinodal region) measured in earlier experiments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nature06219\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000250585800040\n\nView details for PubMedID 17972881\n\nAbstract\n\nWe used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy applied to deeply underdoped cuprate superconductors Bi2Sr2Ca(1-x)YxCu2O8 (Bi2212) to reveal the presence of two distinct energy gaps exhibiting different doping dependence.

Angle-resolved photoemission measurements in the superconducting state have revealed a quasiparticle spectrum with a d-wave gap structure that exhibits a maximum along the antinodal direction and vanishes along the nodal direction. Subsequent measurements have shown that, at low doping levels, this gap structure persists even in the high-temperature metallic state, although the nodal points of the superconducting state spread out in finite 'Fermi arcs'. This is the so-called pseudogap phase, and it has been assumed that it is closely linked to the superconducting state, either by assigning it to fluctuating superconductivity or by invoking orders which are natural competitors of d-wave superconductors. Here we report experimental evidence that a very similar pseudogap state with a nodal-antinodal dichotomous character exists in a system that is markedly different from a superconductor: the ferromagnetic metallic groundstate of the colossal magnetoresistive bilayer manganite La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7.
