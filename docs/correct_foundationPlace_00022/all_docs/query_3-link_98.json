Previous research has not included such a wide spectrum of BIM use in Poland. An analysis was conducted comparing Poland in a global context with other countries in BIM adoption.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nA common phenomenon in the collective consciousness regarding BIM is identifying it with a 3D model of a given building object. BIM is primarily metadata contained in the 2D, 3D, or even 4D to 7D model [1]. The quality and completeness of this metadata are crucial for the implementation of the project in this methodology [2]. In today’s times, in the era of dynamic technological development, digitization is one of the key factors influencing the development of the construction industry [3]. The application of BIM (building information modeling) methodology and the ISO 19650 standard [4,5,6,7,8], along with VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), VDC (virtual design and construction) technologies, and the CDE (common data environment), allows for increased work efficiency, improved design quality, and a reduction in costs and project implementation time [9,10,11].\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new phenomenon that can be successfully implemented for designing and managing the entire life cycle of an object [12]. This combination has enormous potential to change the way construction schedules, costs, quality, and cybersecurity are managed, which contributes to increasing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the projects being implemented. However, the integration of BIM and AI generates its own challenges, and understanding these difficulties is key to the effective implementation and development of this cooperation [13,14]. It should also be noted that the combination of BIM with ESG (environmental, social, governance) brings a number of benefits such as increased energy efficiency, improved quality of life, transparency, and responsibility [15]. It is worth noting that many significant academic universities in Poland conduct research and postgraduate studies in BIM, which reflects market demands and trends that are currently in the AEC industry [16]. The authors look at the above-mentioned aspects as providing opportunities and broad research horizons, and the issues of their implementation may constitute an interesting research gap. The least explored and described is the integration of BIM with AI, which the authors want to dedicate future research to.\n\nCurrently in Poland, there is no requirement to use BIM in public procurement, unlike in some countries, such as Norway or the United Kingdom [17,18]. Nevertheless, in our country, there is an ongoing debate in the industry environment about the appropriateness of introducing such regulations [19]. In March 2022, a working group for BIM was established in the Ministry of Development and Technology, which is responsible for developing a strategy for implementing BIM in Poland and supporting the Minister in related activities [20]. It is worth mentioning that in the previously mentioned countries, there are strictly defined requirements regarding BIM, such as the level of representation of design models (LOD), model size, native and non-native formats, and much more [21,22].\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nFor the purposes of this study, a survey was conducted to examine the degree of BIM usage among the Polish engineering staff. The survey consisted of 22 questions, which were carefully designed to obtain the broadest possible picture of the current state of BIM methodology usage in AEC industries. The survey questions covered various aspects related to BIM, such as the level of awareness about BIM, experience in its use, obstacles encountered during BIM implementation, and potential benefits resulting from its use. This study is part of a broader project aimed at understanding how digitization and 4.0 technologies influence AEC industries, and in particular how they are used to improve efficiency, quality, and sustainable development in these sectors [23]. The results of this survey will be analyzed and discussed in the further part of this article, and the conclusions drawn from them will help in understanding the current state of BIM usage in Poland and in indicating possible directions for its further development. The presented analysis used three research methods: Survey research, literature review, and the professional experience of the authors from design and implementation work, where the BIM methodology was used from level 0 to level 3 (Figure 1). The survey was attended by research workers from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences and employees of the largest construction companies in Central Europe, as well as representatives of small and medium-sized companies. Additionally, in order to eliminate statistical error, the questions were constructed in such a way as to check the reliability of the results. This resulted in the removal of 13 respondents from the study. The article uses the latest scientific literature on BIM and related technologies and is based on professional experience gained on contracts such as the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Plant in the UK, the expansion of the Kennedy Airport terminal in NY, USA, or the Central Communication Port (airport and railway network) in Poland and many more.\n\n2.1. What is BIM\n\nBIM is the process of generating and managing data about a building object throughout its entire life cycle—from the design phase to demolition [24] (Figure 2). It uses multidimensional, spatiotemporal, dynamic models of the aforementioned building objects, which are data-rich and are updated in real time. These models are created using specialized BIM software available on the market (among others: Autodesk Revit, Tekla Structures, Archicad, Nemetschek Allplan) and can be used by all project participants, from architects and engineers, to contractors and property managers [25].\n\nBIM methodology has many advantages that make it an extremely valuable tool in AEC industries. First, it allows for better communication and coordination between various teams working on the project. Second, it improves the accuracy and quality of the design, leading to fewer errors and delays. Third, it enables better resource and cost management, resulting in greater efficiency and savings [26].\n\nIn summary, BIM is a powerful resource of tools that revolutionize the way we manage information in construction. The ability to integrate large amounts of data into one easily accessible model makes it extremely valuable for all project participants. Therefore, understanding what BIM is and how to effectively use it is key to the future of the construction industry. At this point, it is worth noting that construction has constituted a significant percentage of Poland’s GDP over the years [27]. As can be observed, this is a significant element of our economy, and its modernization will influence the number of new investments through financial optimization of projects, especially those infrastructural. Therefore, it is of great importance to introduce BIM in public procurement by law [28].\n\n2.2. LOD Models Levels of Detail\n\nLevels of Development (LOD) are a key aspect of building information modeling. They indicate the degree of accuracy and completeness with which building objects are represented in the BIM model. There are several standards and definitions regarding LOD, but the most popular and commonly used are the definitions developed by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and BuildingSMART International [37]. The LOD level is shaped by different phases of the project and their specifics. The higher the degree of project advancement, the higher the LOD level (Figure 3). However, this is also influenced by the EIR (Exchange Information Requirements) document, which is increasingly attached to the tender documentation in Poland by the Ordering Party. In this document, we have detailed requirements for information exchange on the project, including LOD [38]. Based on this document, the contractor is obliged to create and present a BEP (BIM Execution Plan) document, in which he indicates how he intends to meet the investor’s BIM requirements.\n\nLOD = LOG + LOI\n\nLOG (level of geometry) refers to the external, visible aspect of the model, which expresses the level of detail of its geometric configuration. For example, EMCS 4.0 distinguishes 5 different levels, where LOG 1 means a schematic or symbolic representation of the product, and LOG 5 means a detailed, manufacturer-specific representation. LOI (Level of Information) is the invisible, non-geometric part of the BIM model, which expresses the information and technical data of the model. High-level LOI content includes, for example, object-specific information such as dimensions, materials, technical cards, etc. As the project progresses, both the level of geometric detail and the level of information usually increase. However, there can be large differences between LOI and LOG. A component can have a symbolic representation, while the information is fully specified, including manufacturer-specific properties. In the AIA definition, LOD is divided into six levels, marked from 100 to 500 [39]. Here is a detailed explanation of each level:\n\nLOD 100: This level represents conceptual and sketch models of the building. Objects are represented as a simple shape or symbol, not containing detailed geometric information or properties. Examples are rectangles symbolizing walls or circles symbolizing columns.\n\nLOD 200: At this level, models contain more detailed geometry, as well as basic information about the object, such as dimensions, location, spatial relationships, etc. LOD 200 models are used for spatial analysis, e.g., for determining room areas.\n\nLOD 300: Models contain complete information about the geometry of objects, including shape, size, orientation, construction, and other details. LOD 300 models are used to develop detailed architectural designs, such as room layouts, elevations, sections, etc.\n\nLOD 350: This level is similar to LOD 300, but also includes information about specific components and systems, such as electrical, ventilation, hydraulic installations, etc. LOD 350 models are used for system integration and collision analysis.\n\nLOD 400: Models contain detailed information about specific components, such as 3D models, specifications, parameters, equipment, etc. LOD 400 models are used for precise planning and coordination of individual building elements.\n\nLOD 500: This level represents an as-built model, which contains actual information about the building, such as the condition of existing elements, maintenance information, maintenance recommendations, etc. LOD 500 models are used for managing and maintaining the building after it has been put into use.\n\nThe above levels are guidelines and may vary depending on the project and industry specifics. It is important to precisely define the LOD level that will be appropriate for a specific application of the BIM model, to enable accurate and effective use of building information [40].\n\n2.3. Metadata and CDE, an Opportunity for Big Data and Data Science\n\nMetadata is structured information that describes an information container, i.e., an information resource [41]. They can provide details about the content, context, structure, and other aspects of the resource, making it easier to search, manage, and use. In conjunction with the common data environment (CDE), they are key elements in the BIM methodology. In the context of BIM, metadata can include information about the author of the model, the date of creation, the software used, as well as details about individual elements of the model, such as materials, dimensions, location, and many others. Metadata is essential for effective management and use of the information contained in the BIM model [42].\n\nThe common data environment (CDE) is a central database that allows for transparent and secure management of project resources [43]. CDE promotes clear and understandable communication between project members, which in turn affects transparency in the construction schedule and eliminates misunderstandings. CDE is essential for the effective management of information and data used in the BIM process. Two key aspects of using CDE focus on project collaboration and management, including:\n\nRecording a full audit trail of the built resource through a highly secure, immutable, and neutral environment—all project information is stored on one platform, but project participants have access only to the information they are authorized to—this is very well described by the ISO 19650 standard [44].\n\nFinding efficiency in the production of coordinated and current information, reducing both time and cost [45].\n\nTherefore, metadata and CDE are extremely important for the effective implementation of the BIM methodology. They help in managing information, improve communication and collaboration between project teams, and also enable better management of construction projects. It is worth noting that the CDE platform is required at the second level of BIM. Big data refers to large data sets that are too large or complex to be processed by traditional methods [46]. In the context of CDE, big data can include huge amounts of data generated by various aspects of a construction project, such as data from BIM models, project or building management systems, and many others. Data science is a discipline that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured [47]. Considering CDE, data science can be used to analyze and interpret large data sets to obtain valuable information that can help in decision making and improve project efficiency. For example, data science can be used to analyze data from BIM models to identify patterns that can help optimize the project, such as identifying frequently occurring problems that delay the project schedule, or identifying areas that can be optimized for cost. Therefore, big data and data science are not only possible but also crucial for the effective use of CDE in the BIM methodology on large contracts. In the future, with the increasing amount of data generated by construction projects and greater computing power available for analyzing this data, the possibilities of using big data and data science in CDE will likely increase [48].\n\n2.4. The Future of BIM and Integration with AI\n\nThe integration of AI and BIM (as well as big data and data science, mentioned in Section 2.3) brings many opportunities for the AEC industry. This integration shapes a future where sustainable development, efficiency, cost, and time management are redefined. Artificial intelligence can analyze and learn from BIM data, providing valuable insights and solutions for architects, engineers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders [49]. AI can also support the generative design process, creating many alternative proposals based on specific parameters and constraints. For manufacturers, the AI-BIM integration means the possibility of digitizing their product catalogs, predicting market needs and trends, optimizing production processes, and delivering personalized solutions for customers. To achieve this, manufacturers need to develop a digital strategy that will define how to implement AI, manage data, upgrade employee skills, and measure success. AI and BIM are not only technology but also a change in culture and mentality. Companies that will proactively and creatively use these tools will be market leaders in the coming years. AI and BIM are an opportunity to create a new era for the AEC industry, where people and machines collaborate to create a better and more sustainable construction environment [50].\n\nIn 2023, we could talk about the dynamic development and popularization of the use of generative AI, and 2024 will probably bring an improvement in the quality of its work and its implementation in new areas. We already see the use of AI in practice. Research is underway on the design of structures with full integration of BIM and AI using data fusion between domains, i.e., image data and condition data, generating construction drawings [51]. Another study presents that project management, quality, construction schedule, or safety management, optimization, and integration are possible thanks to the symbiosis of BIM with AI, as proven by Nitin Liladhar Rane from the University of Mumbai [12]. We can draw conclusions about the advantage that new technologies give us in the entire design process over engineers who use traditional methods. The first software solutions, such as “Bimify” or “Propagate”, from the company Bricsys are already appearing on the market. Thanks to these tools, we can automatically assign BIM classification to geometry, analyze the source model, and then implement the same technical or architectural solutions on another model. Additionally, there is the possibility to increase the LOD of the model by analyzing and comparing all elements with each other and applying the same graphic and non-graphic data. The manufacturer’s team is currently working on a tool that allows for semi-automatic generation of 3D models from point clouds [52].\n\n3. Results\n\nOriginal research was conducted involving a survey among 124 people working in the AEC sector. A Google form was created and shared on social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook. To achieve the research objective and verify the assumed working hypothesis, it was appropriately constructed. The survey consisted of 22 questions, many of them multiple choice, and was directed to people working in contracting companies, design offices, and design-build firms. The aim of the study was to check the knowledge and opinions of the respondents about the BIM methodology and the needs of digitization. The results are very disturbing, as they indicate large gaps in knowledge related to the need for digitization, the benefits associated with it, standardization, and a whole range of related things.\n\nIn design offices, 63 respondents (50.81%) work, 40 people (32.26%) in contracting companies, and 21 people (16.94%) in design-build firms (Figure 4).\n\nThe professions of the respondents are presented below. We can see that the vast majority of people are low- and mid-level employees. Therefore, the study results mainly focus on this group (Figure 5).\n\nOver 10% of respondents are research workers. This could have contributed to overestimating the survey results in the context of understanding what BIM is and what the benefits of its use are (Figure 6).\n\nEducation was also asked because it is very important information allowing for the interpretation of the study results. Over 95% of respondents have higher education, which translates into experience and level of knowledge in specific fields, including the AEC industry (Figure 7).\n\nMore than 70% of people do not have Polish construction licenses (Figure 8). This is the result of a declining trend over the years in Poland. Additionally, it is worth noting that some of the respondents work for foreign companies carrying out projects outside Poland, and in many countries, there are no construction licenses.\n\nThe specializations of the people participating in the study are as follows: We can see that the construction industry is the most popular, as much as over 48%. BIM is most often used in building construction, which is a global trend. Architectural and structural specializations are also the most popular in Poland (Figure 9).\n\nThe survey is dominated by employees of large and medium-sized companies (Figure 10). We can expect the use of BIM in these companies due to the awareness of the management staff and the costs associated with the implementation of new technologies. To a large extent, small companies cannot afford this.\n\nThe question was intended to illustrate the dispersion of Polish engineers among companies with different capital (Figure 11). This has a significant impact on the use of BIM on projects, due to the fact that conducting projects in this methodology is not required by Polish legal acts.\n\nNearly 59% of respondents participated in foreign projects. The use of BIM in Poland is rare; hence, projects performed by Polish engineers for foreign markets increase its use in the survey (Figure 12).\n\nThis is how the experience with BIM at work is shaped. Experience using BIM coincides with participation in foreign projects, which confirms the rarity of BIM use in Poland (Figure 13).\n\nBIM in projects, 84 votes in favor of the need to use this methodology. This is certainly a positive aspect, where respondents demonstrate awareness of the advantages that BIM brings (Figure 14).\n\nKnowledge of software, Autodesk Revit is by far the most popular. What is very telling and puzzling is the fact that no one has pointed out any CDE platform. In this example, we can see what was included in the introduction of the article. Namely, that BIM for most people is a 3D model, not data (Figure 15).\n\nThe main purpose for which BIM is used by Polish engineers is to create models, detect collisions, and generate reports (Figure 16).\n\nThe use of standards from the ISO 19650 series by companies in Poland is very rare (Figure 17).\n\nModern technologies coexisting with BIM are even less frequently used (Figure 18).\n\nOver 62% of people believe that the use of BIM brings benefits in the form of improving the quality of projects (Figure 19).\n\nBenefits in the form of time and cost savings in project implementation are indicated by over 46% of respondents (Figure 20).\n\nImplementing BIM in companies involves major challenges. The vast majority of respondents point to costs (48.39%), employee training, and lack of awareness of the need for computerization (50.81%) (Figure 21).\n\nOpinions on the readiness of companies to implement modern information technologies. Many Polish companies are technologically backward, which is noticed by the employees themselves (Figure 22).\n\nPolish companies definitely need training in the implementation of modern technologies. The results confirm the data presented above (Figure 23).\n\nThe penultimate question of the survey was: “Do you think that the AEC industry should invest in computerization and the development of modern technologies?” Over 77% of people support increasing investment in this sector (Figure 24).\n\nIn the last question, the respondents were asked to choose their level of knowledge and awareness related to the application of BIM methodology. We can see relatively high results. They are inconsistent with previous answers to questions that largely exposed a lack of knowledge of modern technologies in the AEC industries (Figure 25).\n\nThe survey results give serious thought to the state of BIM use, knowledge, and the need for digitization of the construction process in Poland. It can be stated with certainty that Polish engineers still have a lot to learn in this field. The study shows that over 34% of respondents do not use the BIM methodology at all, and the vast majority use BIM for creating models (54.84%) and generating reports (44.35%) or detecting collisions (47.58%). However, only 16 people (12.9%) indicated that they use the CDE platform, which de facto reflects the state of BIM in Poland, as its main idea is to use current and verified data. Also, over 29% of respondents do not see the benefits of computerization of the AEC industries. Opinions on BIM and the challenges associated with it are shaping up very similarly worldwide to those presented in the study below [53]. Understanding the essence of the need to introduce the requirement to use BIM in projects, problems with the implementation of new technologies by companies, analysis of models and data, and introduction and standardization of BIM standards are key to changing the digital landscape in the AEC industry not only in Poland but also worldwide [54]. All of this is crucial for the time and cost of investments conducted in this methodology [55]. BIM has a broad impact on construction stages, processes, data-based work culture, and sustainable environmental impact, which the authors proved in this article [56].\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe presented research results lead to reflection and discussion about expanding the knowledge and digital competencies of Polish engineers. It should be mentioned that it is only a matter of time before the legislator introduces the requirement to use BIM in public procurement. The previously mentioned United Kingdom and Norway are examples of how BIM is key to the effective design and implementation of large-scale construction investments, such as the Hinkley Point C [57] or Randselva Bridge [58]. We propose a strategy and framework that can help implement BIM in public procurement in Poland (Figure 26).\n\nEstablishing BIM standards: The first step is to establish BIM standards that will be used throughout the country. These standards should be consistent with international standards, such as ISO 19650, but should also take into account the specifics of the Polish construction market [59].\n\nTraining and education: It is important to provide appropriate training and education for all stakeholders, including designers, engineers, contractors, and property managers. This can include both formal courses and on-the-job training [60].\n\nTechnological support: Implementing BIM requires appropriate technological support, including BIM software and computer hardware. This may also include the development of tools and technologies specific to Poland [61].\n\nChanging regulations: Implementing BIM in public procurement may require changes to existing regulations and procedures. For example, public procurement regulations may need to be modified to enable the use of BIM [62].\n\nPilot and evaluation: It is recommended to conduct pilot projects to assess the effectiveness of BIM implementation and identify areas that require further development. The results of these pilot projects should then be used for continuous improvement of the implementation process [63].\n\nCollaboration and partnership: Implementing BIM is a complex and multi-faceted task that requires collaboration between various stakeholders. This may include partnerships between the public, private, and academic sectors [64].\n\nBIM implementation should be based on the comprehensive activities presented above, where education and piloting combined with continuous evaluation are of paramount importance. In addition to the mechanisms shown, greater affordability (currently very expensive in Poland in terms of earnings) of appropriate software is also important [65].\n\nThe AEC industries are some of the most dispersed and complex industries in the world [66]. Collaboration among various participants in the construction process is often hindered by a lack of common data and information. Building information modeling (BIM) is an approach to design and construction that gathers all data about an object in one digital model. BIM has the potential to streamline collaboration among participants in the construction process, improve project quality, and reduce costs. The article “Digitization of AEC industries based on BIM and 4.0 technologies” discusses the impact of BIM methodology on the construction industry in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0.\n\nThe BIM methodology is an essential part of this revolution, enabling the digitization of construction processes and the management of complex objects such as industrial facilities, office buildings, infrastructure, etc. BIM is becoming increasingly popular in Poland, and more and more investors, both public and private, are deciding to use it in planned and implemented construction investments. Great examples on the side of Polish state-owned companies are the Polish State Railways [67] or the Central Communication Port [68], and the largest non-state companies on the Central European market, Budimex [69], Strabag [70], or Porr [71], have been implementing BIM in their projects for years.\n\nThe limitations of this study are the relatively small number of respondents—124. However, the questions were constructed in such a way as to conduct the analysis of the collected responses as objectively as possible. This was successful, as the results coincide with the research of other scientists. In the next publication, the authors want to verify the implementation of the BIM methodology—the challenges and obstacles associated with it on the largest infrastructure project in Europe—Central Communication Port (CPK). It will be a very complex and interesting publication, and the source materials and information will come directly from the company where one of the authors of this article works—Karol Zawada, as a BIM specialist.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn this article, it is emphasized that BIM brings great benefits and is becoming a standard in global construction. This is the entry into the era of digital construction, which can be compared to deep changes in industrial companies related to their digitization in the concept of Industry 4.0. [72]. The study indicated that a kind of revolution is taking place related to the principles of designing technological elements in construction. The recommendations presented in the discussion refer directly to the demands related to the further development of BIM in Poland. In the context of these observations, the conclusions drawn from the article are as follows: BIM has the potential to transform the AEC industries, bringing benefits to both investors and contractors. However, to fully utilize them, further training and education in BIM are necessary, as well as the introduction of appropriate legal regulations and the implementation of BIM procedures in construction companies [73]. It is worth mentioning that to fully and correctly implement this methodology and benefit from it, one should strictly base it on the standards from the ISO 19650 series [74]. In the future, BIM may not only become a standard but also a requirement in Polish construction.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.D.; methodology, K.Z. and K.R.-N.; software, K.Z.; validation, A.S.; formal analysis, M.D. and K.R.-N.; investigation, K.Z.; resources, K.Z.; data curation, K.Z.; writing—original draft preparation, M.D. and K.R.-N.; writing—review and editing, M.D.; visualization, K.Z.; supervision, K.R.-N. and A.S.; project administration, A.S.; funding acquisition, K.R.-N.

It represents a new phase in the industrial revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0 technologies integrate physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better-connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management. This technological evolution has the potential to reshape industries and redefine how businesses operate, create products, and serve their customers.AECStands for architecture, engineering, and construction. It is an industry that focuses on the design, engineering, and construction of buildings, infrastructure, and other physical structures. The AEC industry covers a wide range of services dedicated to the planning and construction of both commercial, infrastructural, and residential initiatives.AIArtificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.ARAugmented reality is a technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing our perception of our surroundings. It creates an interactive experience by combining the real world with computer-generated content, which can include visual, auditory, haptic, and other sensory modalities.BEPStands for BIM execution plan. It is a document that outlines how the “Information Modeling” part of a project will be executed. The BEP is central to the BIM process and is prepared to streamline the management of information in a BIM project. It details the project deliverables estimated by the contract and the information exchange protocol and requirements. The BEP is developed in response to the EIR and is shared with all stakeholders involved in the project.Big DataIs a term that describes large volumes of data, both structured and unstructured. It is not the amount of data that is important, but what organizations do with it. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves. The primary goal of big data analytics is to help companies make more informed business decisions by enabling data scientists and other users to analyze huge volumes of data that may be left untapped by conventional business intelligence (BI) programs.BIMBuilding information modeling is a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a building or other physical asset. It is a process that involves generating and managing this digital information throughout the lifecycle of the building, from planning and design to construction and operations. BIM integrates structured, multi-disciplinary data to produce a comprehensive model of an asset. This technology is used in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to improve collaboration, increase efficiency, and enable better decision making. It is a key component of the digital transformation in the AEC industry.CDECommon data environment is a digital platform that serves as a single source of information used to collect, manage, and disseminate documentation, graphical models, and non-graphical data for an entire project team. It is a key component of BIM workflows, facilitating collaboration between project team members and helping to avoid files duplication and designing mistakes. The CDE can include a wide range of information, from project contracts and schedules to change orders. It is designed to improve the creation, sharing, and issuing of information that underpins the delivery of a project. By providing a central hub for project information, a CDE can enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and support better decision making.Data ScienceIs an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Data scientists use their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions, and analytical skills to uncover solutions to business challenges. It is a rapidly evolving field with applications in numerous industries, from healthcare to finance to marketing and beyond.EIRStands for exchange information requirements. It is a document drawn up by the client defining all the requirements related to the information exchanges of a BIM process. The EIR is a pre-tender document that defines standards, information, and requirements of a BIM process and constitutes the initial input of the tender process. It focuses on the methods to be performed for the sharing of data and the generation of documents, focusing on the management of information content among the various stakeholders. The EIR forms a text type document in which the reference regulatory aspects, priorities, objectives, and models to be implemented for each design phase with levels of information appropriate to the reference step are identified.ESGStands for environmental, social, and governance. It is a framework used by investors and other stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability and societal impact of an organization. The “Environmental” aspect considers how a company performs as a steward of the natural environment. The “Social” aspect examines how a company manages relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. The “Governance” aspect involves a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.ISO 19650Is an international standard for managing information throughout the lifecycle of a construction project using BIM. It encompasses the organization and digitization of information about buildings and civil engineering works. The standard includes the same high-level principles and requirements as BIM Level 2. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization’s Technical Committee ISO/TC 59, Buildings and civil engineering works, SC 13. The standard is based on the older British Standard PAS 1192, but introduces some new concepts.LODLevel of development is a framework used in the AEC industry to define and articulate the content and reliability of BIM at different stages of design and construction. It was first introduced by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 2008. The LOD specification helps professionals in the industry to communicate how an element’s geometry and associated information has evolved throughout the entire process. It signifies the degree to which different members of the team can rely on information associated with an element. Currently, there are six levels of development, from LOD 100 to LOD 500, each representing a different stage of element detail and information accuracy.LOGStands for level of geometry. It is a part of the LOD concept, which also includes LOI. The LOG in a BIM model expresses the geometric level of detail. For example, EMCS 4.0 distinguishes between 5 different levels, where LOG 1 stands for a schematic or symbolic representation of a product, and LOG 5 for a detailed, manufacturer-specific representation. It tells us something about the appearance (the geometry) of the element.LOIStands for level of information. It is a part of the LOD concept, which also includes LOG. The LOI in a BIM model represents the non-geometric, technical information of a model. For example, content with a high LOI contains manufacturer-specific information such as price, volume, and materials.Point cloudsRepresent a collection of data points in three-dimensional space. These points are captured using 3D laser scanners, and they record the precise geometry and spatial information of an area or object. The point cloud data can then be imported into BIM software, where it can be visualized and modeled. This process allows for an accurate as-built representation of a building or space. Point clouds are crucial in BIM as they provide a detailed and accurate foundation for creating comprehensive BIM models.VDCStands for virtual design and construction. It is the management of integrated multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects, including the product (facilities), work processes, and organization of the design-construction-operation team. The goal of VDC is to support explicit and public business objectives. It involves building the project once digitally to work out the big problems, then building it more efficiently in the physical world.VRVirtual reality is a technology that creates a simulated experience by employing 3D near-eye displays and pose tracking. It immerses the user in a computer-generated environment that simulates reality. VR applications range from entertainment, particularly video games, to education such as medical, safety or military training, and business such as virtual meetings. The user can interact with the virtual world using VR equipment, such as headsets or gloves, which provide visual, auditory, and sometimes haptic feedback. The term “virtual reality” was coined in 1987 by Jaron Lanier, who contributed significantly to the early development of VR technology.\n\nReferences\n\nAnger, A.; Łaguna, P.; Zamara, B.
