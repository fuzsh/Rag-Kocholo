Conceiving, designing and sustaining the built environment are among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The use of the latest modern computer technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning offer completely new possibilities for ecologically, and economically sustainable solutions to this challenge. Thanks to a generous donation of the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation, TUM has founded the "TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute Artificial Intelligence for the Built World" to conduct research on this future-oriented technological focus area.

The TUM GNI is closely associated with the Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI) and the Leonhard-Obermeyer-Center (LOC). A particular role in TUM GNI’s missions plays the execution of joint research projects between scientists from informatics and scientist from domains related to the built environment.
