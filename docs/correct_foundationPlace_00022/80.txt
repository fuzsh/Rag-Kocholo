Flick Gocke Schaumburg has advised the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation on the structuring and negotiation of an agreement to found and fund a new research institute at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

The TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute Artificial Intelligence for the Built World will be the first facility in the world to focus on the application of artificial intelligence in the construction industry.

The Nemetschek Innovation Foundation will provide around 50 million euros in funding for the new research institute over the next ten years. Established as a not-for-profit organization on May 20, 2020 by TUM graduate engineer Prof. Georg Nemetschek, the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation aims to promote research and teaching in the planning, construction, use, and management of buildings. The funding of the TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute is the Nemetschek Innovation Foundationâ€™s first project aimed at creating a leading role for Germany in artificial intelligence for the construction industry.
