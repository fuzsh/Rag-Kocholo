Construction software provider, Nemetschek Group is one of the strongest-growing mid-sized companies in Germany

Construction software supplier, Nemetschek Group took second place in the ‘TOP 100 Ranking of SMEs 2020’ carried out by the management consultants Munich Strategy for the Handelsblatt newspaper.

“Long before digitisation became a buzzword, Nemetschek, as an industry pioneer, was already involved in digital construction,” explains Dr Sebastian Theopold, founder of Munich Strategy and author of the study.

“In recent years, the company has built up a broad platform around the design, construction and management of buildings.

“With the media & entertainment business unit, Nemetschek has further diversified its portfolio and thus laid the foundation for future growth.”

Munich Strategy surveyed over 4,000 German companies from all industries with annual sales between 10 million and 1 billion euros. The top 100 companies were identified based on their long-term growth and profitability.

Innovative solutions for digital transformation

“We are very pleased to be among the top 3,” says Dr Axel Kaufmann, spokesman of the executive board and CFOO of the Nemetschek Group.

“The Nemetschek Group supports the construction industry with innovative solutions for digital transformation.

“We are well positioned and, thanks to our close customer relationships, the broad diversification in target industries and regions and the increasing share of recurring revenues, we have fortunately coped better with the current situation than initially expected.”
