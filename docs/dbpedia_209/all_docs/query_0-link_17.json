        "text": "Sex ratio and size–gender distribution of Coralliophila meyendorffii and Babelomurex cariniferus collected in the field was studied. While sex ratio did not depart from the expected Fisher 1:1 ratio for dioecious species, the size–frequency distributions showed clearly a sexual size dimorphism with males significantly smaller than females. Laboratory monitoring of penis reduction in both species, combined with an anatomical and histological study of the reproductive system of individuals reducing penis revealed the existence of transitional sexual stages, proving the existence of protandry. Penis monitoring also demonstrated a high plasticity in size at sex change, suggesting a socially controlled sex change. In C. meyendorffii, where penis monitoring followed an experimental design based on the assumption that protandry existed and that presence of females influenced sex change, results strongly supported a social control of sex change. Evidences for protandry in other coralliophilids are summarized and protandry as a widespread sexual strategy in Coralliophilidae is postulated.\n\nThe functional reproductive system of three Mediterranean species of Coralliophilidae (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia), Coralliophila brevis, Coralliophila meyendorffii and Babelomurex cariniferus, was compared with that of Coralliophila squamosa and three Leptoconchus species. Differences chiefly in the pallial section of the female reproductive tract separate the Indo-Pacific genus Leptoconchus from the Mediterranean species, and subdivide the latter into three different anatomical groups. Polyphyly of the genus Coralliophila is suggested. Comparison of the reproductive system of coralliophilids with that of the related Muricidae allows identifying characters of Coralliophila brevis, Coralliophila meyendorffii and Babelomurex cariniferus that are unknown in Muricidae. The comparison also reveals a closer similarity of Coralliophila squamosa with Ocenebrinae, suggesting that this species might represent a less derived evolutionary line within Coralliophilidae. The reproductive system of some individuals of Coralliophila meyendorffii and Babelomurex cariniferus undergoing penis reduction in the laboratory is also studied. It sheds some light in the ontogeny of the female pallial reproductive tract, and provides direct evidence for the existence of protandry in these species.\n\nEpitonium dendrophylliae Bouchet & Warén, 1986 is a rare, thin-shelled, eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean epitoniid usually found on the deep shelf or in the bathyal zone, associated with the scleractinian corals Dendrophyllia and Balanophyllia (Dendrophylliidae). It was originally recorded from Madeira, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of Morocco, and as far as Luanda (Angola). All known records of E. dendrophylliae are from depths exceeding 40 m, and most of them consist of empty shells. Although the species may reach 15.2 mm, the holotype measures only 5.6 mm. The species is here reported for the first time from shallow water, living on colonies of the scleractinian dendrophylliid Astroides calycularis (Pallas, 1766).\n\nA study of the intracapsular larval development of two Mediterranean gastropods, Coralliophila meyendorffii and Babelomurex cariniferus (Neogastropoda, Coralliophilidae), was undertaken using light microscopy and SEM. Special attention was paid to early organogenesis and larval nutrition. Like other coralliophilids, both species brood inside the pallial cavity loose, unattached egg capsules, from which planktotrophic veligers hatched. In C. meyendorffii, developmental time spanned ca. four weeks at 19ºC mean water temperature. In B. cariniferus, developmental time could not be determined, but the slight difference in the egg diameter among both species suggested a similar developmental period. Early organogenesis of both species followed a similar schedule differing only in the sequence of appearance of the larval sensory organs and in the grade of development of the digestive tract at hatching. The most striking feature was the development during the veliger stage of a large cephalic bladder, a pair of prominent adsorptive cells (\"larval kidneys\"), a rectal gland and a pair of sensory bristles at the centre of the cephalic region. Possible functions of the cephalic bladder, a transitory larval organ which is widely spread in gastropods that pass part of their development inside an egg capsule, and of the adsorptive cells, a synapomorphy of Caenogastropoda, are discussed. The homology of the pair of cephalic sensory bristles with certain components of the cephalic sensory organs (= CSO) of opisthobranch veligers is also discussed. Concerning the larval nutrition, certain evidences pointed to the fact that both species use intracapsular fluid and capsular wall material as nutritive resources during early larval development. Additionally, Coralliophila meyendorffii fed during the preveliger stage on nurse eggs. The influence of nurse eggs on shell size at hatching, however, was negligible. The role of the extraembryonic nutritive resources in the survival of planktotrophic veligers after hatching is discussed."
