The University dates from 1838, when Union Institute was founded in Randolph County by the Methodists and Friends. In 1851 the institution became Normal College, one of the first schools in America for the training of teachers. In 1859 the name was changed to Trinity College by which it was known for sixty-five years. Then on December 11, 1924, James Buchanan Duke executed the Indenture of Trust that provided for hospitalization, church work in rural communities, and education. The principal feature of the educational provision was the crea- tion of Duke University. Now, the University, with a student body totaling 8,000, occupies two cam- puses. The East Campus of 108 acres was formerly the campus of Trinity College. About a mile west are the newer units of the University, known as the West Cam- pus, totaling 467 acres. It was first occupied in September, 1930. Forestry at Duke University began early in 1931 when the Duke Forest was placed under intensive forest management and forestry research was initiated. An academic-forestry curriculum, designed for men and women intent upon pursuing forestry as a profession, was organized in Trinity College of Duke Uni- versity in 1932. This program was enlarged in 1952 and now includes more than sixty cooperating colleges and universities. (See pages 15-17). In 1938 the School of Forestry was organized at the graduate level and a cur- riculum was offered leading to the degree of Master of Forestry. Work leading to the degree of Doctor of Forestry has been offered since 1940. In 1969 the School began responding to demands for individuals with professional expertise in en- vironmental management by developing curricula in this growing field. Grad- uates of these programs have been awarded the Master of Environmental Man- agement degree since 1975. The School has been fully accredited since its origin. A degree in forestry or environmental studies at the undergraduate level is not offered at Duke University. Graduates of recognized colleges, universities, professional schools of fores- try, and other students who meet the entrance requirements of the School (see page 19) may enroll in forestry programs leading to the professional degrees of Master of Forestry, Master of Environmental Management, and Doctor of Fores- try. The Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the Graduate School also offers graduate work in certain aspects of forestry leading to the de- grees of Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy. This work is available to graduates of schools of forestry of recognized standing and to col- lege or university graduates holding a bachelor's degree. All applicants will be considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Program Information Fields of Study Basic scientific or professional programs of study are available in the follow- ing fields of forestry and related natural resources. Interdisciplinary programs between fields within the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and those in other departments of the University are strongly encouraged. Biological Science Forest Ecology Tree Physiology and Biochemistry Forest Pathology Forest Entomology Dendrology and Wood Anatomy Environmental Science Forest Soils Forest Meteorology and Biometeorology Wildland Hydrology Statistics and Operations Research Biometry and Statistics Mensuration Operations Research Economics and Management Natural Resources Economics and Policy With the exception of forest management, study in all of the above fields can be pursued in programs for a M.S., A.M., or Ph.D. degree in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies of the Graduate School, or in a professional program for a M.F., M.E.M., or D.F. degree from the School of Forestry and En- vironmental Studies. Students contemplating careers in teaching and research are strongly urged to follow courses of study in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the Graduate School. In addition, the following special management or business-oriented programs of study leading to the M.F. degree are available in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies: Post-Liberal Arts and Science Program, Business Man- agement Program, Forest Protection Program, Cooperative Forestry Program, and Natural Resource Ecology and Environmental Management Program for the M.E.M. degree. Detailed information on these special programs is given under the Master of Forestry Degree, Master of Environmental Management Degree, and the Co- operative Plan of Study section in this Bulletin. Master of Forestry Degree The requirements for the degree Master of Forestry (M.F.) are governed by the extent of the student's previous undergraduate education, both in profes- sional and related subjects, and by his specific career objectives. Usually, stu- dents who have earned the degree of Bachelor of Science in Forestry, or the equivalent, from an accredited school of forestry may complete the requirements for the M.F. degree in one academic year. Students with no prior preparation in forestry are required to begin their studies with a summer term of nine weeks. Thereafter, four semesters of study are required under this program for attain- ment of the M.F. degree. Graduate work of equivalent grade done in residence at other institutions may, with the approval of the faculty, be accepted as credit toward the degree, but a minimum of one year of residence at Duke University is required. A student who has not completed his thesis while in residence must submit an acceptable manuscript to the faculty within a period of two years following the termination of his residence. No student may take less than fourteen nor more than eighteen units of credit per semester without special permission of the faculty (see pages 23-25). Postliberal Arts and Science Program. Men and women who are college graduates but have had no prior professional forestry training may be admitted to programs of study leading to the degree of Master of Forestry. Depending on the program of study, sixty to seventy units of credit in residence are minimal re- quirements, including the summer session and core courses listed below. In the case of students with advanced preparation equivalent to these specific subjects, total unit credit requirements may be reduced. Such reductions will be approved on an individual basis and only on specific recommendation of the student's major program adviser and approval by the faculty. Summer Session Units Careers in Natural Resources (For. 200) 0 Tree Growth and Development (For. 205) 3 Dendrology (For. 241) 3 Forest Measurements (For. 256) 4 Interpretation of Aerial Photographs (For. 289) 2 Core Courses Soils and Forest Resources (For. 261) 3 Natural Resource Ecology (E.S. 243) 3 Resource Economics and Policy (For. 269) 3 During the latter part of the first year, each student will be requested to des- ignate the field (or fields) he wishes to pursue for a major. After the student has designated his field of interest, he will be assigned a faculty adviser who, in consultation with the student, will develop a program of study in a manner simi- lar to that described under the Postprofessional Program (see below). Any student who does not earn a grade of E or G in at least six units of work in the first academic year will not be permitted to enter into the work of the sec- ond year. Postprofessional Program. Students with satisfactory undergraduate pro- fessional training qualify for advanced study and research in the various dis- ciplines of forestry under this program. A specific study plan is developed for each student through consultation with a faculty advisor)' committee. For the student planning a managerial career in the general area of forest production (and where the Master of Forestry is planned as a terminal degree), his program of study usually consists of courses and seminars, with a major portion of the work concentrated in the area of the student's interests. For the student with interest in research, the study plan is oriented within a specific discipline in order to prepare him for a research career or for academic training beyond the master's level. A number of courses offered in other departments of the University are open to qualified students in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. One or more of these may be included in a student's study plan when considered ad- visable by his advisory committee. A minimum of thirty units, in which the student must earn a grade of E orG in at least six units, are required for the degree of Master of Forestry under this program. Usually, fifteen units of credit (including the thesis) must be earned in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Business Management Program. A specialized program is offered in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies in cooperation with the Depart- ment of Economics to prepare forestry graduates for managerial careers in the business aspects of industrial forest land management or forest products. The program requires two years of study and training leading to the degree of Mas- ter of Forestry. It is open to selected students who have earned a bachelor's de- gree (or the equivalent) in general forestry, forest management, forest utiliza- tion, or wood science and technology, with the proper prerequisites, and who also have potential leadership qualities indicative of administrative and execu- tive ability. The general requirements of the program are as follows: 1. At least ten courses (thirty units) in economics and business admin- istration or in closely allied fields. 2. Approximately five courses (fifteen units) in forestry which deal with principles of administration and decision-making. 3. Experience as paid managerial trainee with a cooperating firm for a period including the fall semester of the second year and the preceding summer. 4. A written analysis of some phase of the managerial operation ot the organization with which the training period is spent. A specific program of study, commensurate with each student's academic background and future goals, will be developed by the program advisory com- mittee in consultation with the student. A list of suggested courses that might be included in such a program of study is available upon request. Forest Protection Program. A combined program of specialization in en- tomology-pathology is available for students desiring career preparation in the applied aspects of forest insect and disease control. This program of study leads to the Master of Forestry degree. Students electing the program must hold either a bachelor's degree in general forestry or have equivalent preparation in the biological sciences. The general requirements of the program are as follows: 1. A minimum of twenty-eight units in forest entomology and forest pathology. With approval, credits in closely related disciplines may be sub- stituted. 2. At least twelve units of courses and seminars dealing with man- agerial and statistical aspects of forest protection. 3. One summer of employment experience with a forest protection agency. 4. Organization, conduct, and report of applied research on forest in- sects and/or disease problems (four units). Reasonable latitude will be permitted in selecting courses to accommodate specific needs and interests. Each program of study will be developed in con- sultation with the program directors. A list of recommended courses is available upon request. Applicants for this program must meet the requirements of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the approval of the program advisory committee. Master of Environmental Management Degree The requirements for the Master of Environmental Management degree are governed by the extent of the student's previous undergraduate education and by his specific career objectives. A student without prior education in environmental management will be required to complete the equivalent of four semesters of resident study (sixty units) beyond the baccalaureate degree level, including the core courses given below. Students accepted from the cooperative college program must complete five semesters of resident study (seventy units). Graduate work of equivalent grade done in residence at other institutions may, with approval of the faculty, be accepted as credit for the degree, but a minimum of one year of residence at Duke University is required. No student may take less than fourteen or more than eighteen units of credit without special permission of the faculty (see page 25). Core Courses* Units Natural Resource Ecology (E.S. 243) 3 Biometry (For. 250) 3 Computer Science in Natural Resources (For. 253) 3 Soils and Forest Resources (For. 261) 3 Resource Economics and Policy (For. 269) 3 Ecological Principles in Environmental Management (E.S. 341) 3 Environmental Management Seminar (E.S. 347-8) (1 unit per semester) 4 Natural Resource Law and Policy (Plan. 233— UNC) 3 Natural Resource Ecology and Environmental Management Program. A professional program is offered to students with career interests in the expanding fields of environmental management and protection. The basic objective of this program is to develop expertise in planning and administering the management of natural resources and the non-urban environment for maximum human bene- fits with minimum deterioration of ecosystem stability. Emphasis is placed on the ecosystem as the basic unit of natural resource management. This program of study leads to the Master of Environmental Management degree and is open to students with a bachelor's degree in biological or environ- mental science or with training in other fields and a strong motivation toward an ecological approach to natural resource problems. General requirements of the program are: 1. A minimum of twenty-four units in resource ecology and environ- mental science. 2. At least nine units in courses dealing with statistical or mathemati- cal analysis of natural resource problems. 3. A minimum of fifteen units in courses in resource use planning, business, and public administration. 4. Formulation, analysis, and report of research on an applied problem related to ecological or environmental aspects of natural resource manage- ment. Although all students are expected to have substantive knowledge of prin- ciples of resource ecology, environmental science, and quantitative analysis, reasonable latitude is permitted in electing courses to meet the interests and capabilities of individual students. Each program of study will be developed in consultation with the program directors. Program in Tropical Forestry Fellowships are available for travel and subsistence in field-oriented pro- grams in Central America. Refer to the section titled \"Organization for Tropical Studies\" in the Graduate School Bulletin in the chapter \"Special and Cooperative Programs.\" Master of Science Degree Prerequisites. The degree of Master of Science (M.S.) is offered through the Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the Graduate School. As a prerequisite to this degree a student must have earned a baccalaureate degree •Prerequisites: Introductory Biology and Introductory Economics must be completed before en- tering program or taken without credit after entering program. from an accredited college or university. There is no foreign language require- ment for this degree. Major and Minor Subjects. The work for the Master of Science degree is de- signed to provide a basic foundation in a fundamental area of forestry or in a field closely allied with forestry. A minimum of thirty units of credit is required for the degree; twenty-four units must be in formal courses although not more than six units can be earned for the thesis. Specific course requirements call for a minimum of twelve units in a major field of specialization and six units in a minor area of concentration. The major and minor fields are determined without regard to departmental divisions of the University if the interdisciplinary nature of the area of specialization makes such a program of study advisable. The speci- fic program of study is developed by the major professor (thesis supervisor), subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies in forestry and the Dean of the Graduate School. The Thesis. At least one month before presenting the thesis, that is on or be- fore February 1 for a May degree or on or before August 1 for a September degree, the student must file with the Dean of the Graduate School, on the official form, the title of the thesis and the declaration of intention to graduate. The title must have the approval of the thesis supervisor and the director of graduate studies in the major department. If the student has met the degree requirements before the above deadlines, he must file his intention to graduate one month before the thesis is presented. The basic requirements for preparing the dissertation, regu- lating such things as type of paper, form, and binding, are prescribed in the Guide for the Preparation of Theses and Dissertations which is available in the Graduate School Office, 127 Allen Building. Four typewritten copies of the thesis, bound in snap binders supplied by the Library, must be submitted through the Graduate School Office to the Dean of the Graduate School on or before April 15 for a May degree or on or before August 15 for a September degree, and at least one week before the scheduled date of the student's examination. The copies will then be distributed by the stu- dent to the several members of the examining committee. Three copies for the library will be bound by the Ruzicka Bindery for a fee of $5 a volume. The stu- dent may request that an additional number of copies be so bound. The Examining Committee and the Examination. The instructor who directs the student's program appoints an examining committee composed of himself and two other members of the graduate faculty, one of whom must be from a de- partment other than that of the major. If the student has been permitted to take related work within the major department, the third member may represent the minor field within the department. The names of the members of this committee are submitted for approval to the Dean of the Graduate School at least one week preceding the final examination. This committee administers the examination and certifies whether the stu- dent has passed or failed by signing the card provided for this purpose by the Graduate School Office. This card is used to indicate completion of all require- ments for the degree. After a thesis is approved the committee signs all copies of the thesis, and the candidate then returns the original, the first two carbon copies, and any other copies he wishes bound by Ruzicka to the Dean of the Graduate School who deposits them in the University Library. Master of Arts Degree The degree of Master of Arts (A.M.) is offered through the Department of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the Graduate School. As a prerequisite to admission for this program, a student must have earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. Students interested in working toward this degree should refer to the Bulletin of the Graduate School for specific require- ments. Doctor of Forestry Degree The degree of Doctor of Forestry (D.F.) is a professional and research de- gree conferred upon those students who have satisfactorily completed specified requirements of advanced study and research. Work toward the D.F. degree, consisting of advanced studies in a major and a minor field, is offered with majors in the several branches of forestry. A minor may be elected in forestry or in other areas of specialized study in the University approved by the faculty of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Prospective students should correspond with the Director of Admissions to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies on all matters pertaining to admis- sion to the School. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.) is conferred through the Graduate School of Duke University. Programs of study and research for men and women working for this degree are directed by faculty members of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies who also comprise the graduate faculty of the Depart- ment of Forestry and Environmental Studies in the Graduate School. Both major and minor programs of study are available in the following branches of forestry: forest biochemistry, forest biometry, forest meteorology, forest ecology, forest economics, forest entomology, forest hydrology, forest pathology, forest soils, forest-tree physiology, wood anatomy, and wood chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is essentially a research degree. Although course work is a necessary part of the student's program, the mere accumulation of course credits will not be sufficient for attaining this degree. The granting of the Ph.D. degree is based primarily upon the student's knowledge of a specialized field of study and upon the production of an acceptable dissertation embodying the results of original research. General Requirements for the D.F. and Ph.D. Degrees The formal requirements, discussed in detail below, for the doctoral degrees are as follows: (1) foreign language; (2) major and related courses; (3) supervisory committee for program of study; (4) residence; (5) preliminary examination; (6) dissertation; and (7) final examination. In order to be considered for candi- dacy for a doctoral degree, the student must have passed all of his course work in the first year of graduate study and have made a grade of G or better on at least nine units of that work. Foreign Language Requirements. A reading knowledge of at least one for- eign language is required for the D.F. and Ph.D. degrees. Languages usually taken are French, German, and Russian. Another language which has a definite relation to the degree program and for which an examination can be provided may be substituted for any of these with the approval of the supervisory commit- tee. A foreign student whose native language is not English may request that the director of graduate studies ask permission of the Dean of the Graduate School to offer English as the foreign language required in his program. 10 With the special approval of the Dean and of the Executive Committee of the Graduate Faculty, the foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. may be waived in individual cases provided the department submits satisfactory evidence that a foreign language has little bearing on the major program of the student con- cerned. The foreign language requirement(s) may be satisfied in the following ways: 1 . The student may take the Educational Testing Service examination at one of many national centers (including the Duke University Counseling Center). To avoid delays, prospective students are urged to take appropriate ETS Graduate School Foreign Language tests prior to registration. However, it should be noted that at the time of the final examination in a master's pro- gram or of the preliminary examination in a doctoral program, language certificates more than six calendar years old will not be accepted toward fulfilling the language requirement. 2. In a language for which ETS tests are not available, a reading ex- amination may be arranged by the Graduate School Office and administered by a qualified examiner. Special Reading Courses. Special courses designed to assist graduate stu- dents in acquiring a reading knowledge of French or German are offered for three hours a week. French is offered during the fall semester and occasionally in the spring, and German during the spring semester and the summer session. A stu- dent who registers for either course must reduce his normal load of graduate courses by three units, with no reduction in fees. No auditors are permitted in these courses at any time. Undergraduates may not enroll during the academic year but may register, with permission of the Dean of the Graduate School, in the summer session if total registration permits. Major and Related Work. The student's program of study necessarily de- mands substantial concentration on courses in his major department. It must, however, include a minimum of six units in related fields approved by his major department. Use of related fields within the major department requires the ap- proval of the Dean. Committee to Supervise the Program of Study. As early in a student's course of study as is practicable and not later than two months before the prelimi- nary examination, the director of graduate studies in the major department will nominate for the approval of the Dean a supervising committee of five, with one memberdesignated as chairman. This committee will include at least three mem- bers of the major department and one from the minor department, if a minor is involved. This committee will approve the program of study, as well as adminis- ter the preliminary examination and the final doctoral examination. Should all members of the committee be from the major department, at least one member of another department will be added or substituted for the final doctoral exami- nation. The final examination may be administered with a minimum of four members. When the preliminary examination is arranged, the committee and the direc- tor will submit to the Dean the student's program of study bearing a statement that the department's course and language requirements have been, or are being, completed. Residence. The minimum registration requirement is sixty units of graduate credit, not more than thirty units of which may be accepted by transfer. Since a full program is thirty units per academic year, the prospective doctoral candi- date who enters with an A.B. or B.S. degree must plan to spend in residence a minimum of two academic years; if he enters with an A.M., M.S., orM.F. degree, his minimum residence is one academic year. If there are undergraduate defici- encies in his program, he may, in addition to the minimum requirements, be required to take preliminary undergraduate courses for which he will not re- ceive graduate credit. Even if there are no such undergraduate deficiencies, the student's supervisory committee will determine what requirements, if any, above the minimum the student must meet. See pages 23-25 for further infor- mation on registration in residence and in absentia. When the preliminary examination is passed, any courses, language certifi- cations, or other credits for advanced standing which are more than six calendar years old will not be accepted toward fulfilling the minimum requirements of the doctoral degree. Usually the student should pass the preliminary examination by the end of his second year of graduate study. If he has not passed it by the middle of the third year, he must file with the Dean a statement explaining the delay and set- ting a date for the examination. Except under unusual circumstances, extension will not be granted beyond the end of the third year. The doctoral dissertation should be submitted and acccepted within two calendar years after the preliminary examination is passed. Should the disserta- tion not be submitted and accepted within four years after the examination, the candidate, with the approval of his committee, may petition the Dean for an ex- tension of one year. Should this extension be granted and the dissertation not be submitted and accepted within the year, the student must pass a second pre- liminary examination to remain a doctoral degree candidate. In such a case, the time limit for submitting the dissertation will be determined by the Dean and the candidate's committee. Preliminary Examination. A student is not accepted as a candidate for the doctoral degree until he has passed the preliminary examination. A transfer stu- dent who may have passed a preliminary examination elsewhere must, never- theless, take the examination at Duke. The examination ordinarily covers both the major and minor fields. 12 In the summer, a preliminary examination may be scheduled only between the opening and closing dates of the summer session. Should the student fail the preliminary examination, he may apply, with the consent of his supervisory committee and the Dean, for the privilege of a second examination to be taken no sooner than three months after the date of the first. Failure on the second examination will render the student ineligible to continue his program for the doctoral degree at Duke University. The Dissertation. The dissertation is expected to be a mature and competent piece of writing, embodying the results of significant and original research. Not later than February 1 (February 2, if February 1 falls on Sunday) preced- ing the May commencement at which the degree is expected to be conferred, the student must file with the dean of the appropriate school, on the official form to be obtained from the Graduate School Office, the title of the dissertation. This title must receive the written approval of both the director of graduate studies of the student's major department and the professor who directs the dissertation. The basic requirements for preparing the dissertation, regulating such things as type of paper, form, and binding, are prescribed in the Guide for the Prepara- tion of Theses and Dissertations which is available in the Graduate School Office, 127 Allen Building. The dissertation must be completed to the satisfaction of the instructor who directs it. Four typewritten copies bound in snap binders secured through the Graduate School Office must be deposited with the dean of the appropriate school on or before April 1 preceding the May commencement when the degree is to be conferred. The dissertation must be submitted at least seven days before the scheduled date of the student's examination. Doctoral dissertations usually will be published on microfilm through Uni- versity Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Authors may, if they wish, copyright them. An abstract will be published in Dissertation Abstracts. Before final typing is completed, the candidate should obtain, in the Graduate School Office, de- tailed instructions on the procedure, together with a microfilming agreement which is signed and returned when the dissertation is finally deposited in the Graduate School Office. In brief, all copies of the dissertation, with the original in clean type, will remain in spring binders until after the final examination. Three extra copies of the abstract, carefully written and not more than 600 words long, are submitted when the dissertation is first presented to the Graduate School Office. A nonre- turnable fee of $25 is charged for microfilming. If copyright is desired, an addi- tional fee of $15 is charged. The original and two copies will be bound by Ruzicka Bindery at a cost of $5 per volume. The student may request that more than three copies be so bound. Final Examination. The final oral examination shall be based primarily upon the dissertation. Questions may, however, be asked in the candidate's major field. Except in unusual circumstances, approved by the Dean, a final examina- tion will be scheduled only when school is in session. If a student fails his final examination, he may be allowed to take it for a sec- ond time, but not sooner than six months from the date of his first. Permission to take the second examination must be obtained from the instructor who directed the dissertation and from the Dean. Failure to pass the second examination ren- ders the student ineligible to continue work for the doctoral degree at Duke Uni- versity. 13 Cooperative Plan of Study Program with Selected Colleges and Universities Since its inception the Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies has had the cooperation of Trinity College (the undergraduate college of arts and sciences of Duke University) in preparing students for professional careers in forestry. Under the plan, a student devotes his first three years to a coordinated and carefully integrated program of study in the basic arts and sciences in Trinity College. The following semesters are spent in the School of Forestry and Environ- mental Studies, and upon successful completion of seventy units of credit in a professional program of study, a student will have earned a baccalaureate de- gree from Trinity College and the professional Master of Forestry or Master of Environmental Management degree from the Duke School of Forestry and En- vironmental Studies. In the case of students with advanced preparation relevant to their specific educational objectives, total unit credit requirements may be re- duced. Any such reductions will be approved on an individual basis and only with specific recommendation of the student's major program adviser and ap- proval by the faculty. Based upon the experience and success of this cooperative program with Trinity College, the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies in 1952 initi- ated similar programs of collaboration with a selected group of colleges and uni- versities located throughout the United States. These programs offer students the numerous advantages of a broad background in liberal arts and sciences as prep- aration for later professional training. A student intent upon following such a course of study should make application to one of the colleges listed on pages 16-17. Admission requirements and other information pertinent to matricula- tion may be obtained from each of these institutions. Not later than the end of the first semester of the third year in the college or university of his choice, the student may make formal application for admission to the Duke University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. To qualify for admission under these programs, a student must have followed a course of study arranged in con- sultation with his adviser, must have the official recommendation of his college, and must meet requirements for admission to the Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. 15 Institutions in the Cooperative Program Alabama Samford University, Birmingham 35209 Arkansas Little Rock University, Little Rock 72204 Colorado Colorado College, Colorado Springs 80902 Florida Florida Southern College, Lakeland 33802 Rollins College, Winter Park 32791 Stetson University, College of Liberal Arts, DeLand 32720 Georgia Mercer University, Macon 31207 Illinois Illinois Wesleyan University, College of Liberal Arts, Bloomington 61710 Indiana Butler University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Indianapolis 46208 Franklin College, Franklin 46131 Indiana Central College, Indianapolis 46227 Iowa Iowa Wesleyan College, Mount Pleasant 52641 Kansas Baker University, Baldwin 66006 Louisiana Centenary College of Louisiana, Shreveport 71104 Maryland Western Maryland College, Westminster 21158 Michigan Albion College, Albion 49224 Mississippi Millsaps College, Jackson 39210 Missouri William Jewell College, Liberty 64068 Nebraska Doane College, Crete 68333 New Jersey Drew University, College of Liberal Arts, Madison 07940 New York Hofstra University, Hempstead, Long Island 11550 North Carolina Catawba College, Salisbury 28114 Duke University, Trinity College, Durham 27706 Guilford College, Guilford College 27410 High Point College, High Point 27262 Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem 27106 Ohio Baldwin-Wallace College, Berea 44017 Denison University, Granville 43023 Heidelberg College, Tiffin 44883 Kent State University, College of Liberal Arts, Kent 44240 Marietta College, Mauetta 45750 Miami University, College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford 45056 Ohio University, Athens 45701 Otterbein College, Westerville 43081 Wittenberg University, Springfield 45501 Youngstown State University, Youngstown 44503 Oregon Reed College, Portland 97202 Williamette University, College of Liberal Arts, Salem 97301 Pennsylvania Albright College, Reading 19604 Allegheny College, Meadville 16335 Elizabethtown College, Elizabethtown 17022 Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster 17603 16 Gettysburg College, Gettysburg 17325 Juniata College, Huntington 16653 Lebanon Valley College, Annville 17003 Lvcoming College, Williamsport 17704 Moravian College, Bethlehem 18018 Muhlenberg College, Allentown 18104 Thiel College, Greenville 16125 South Carolina Furman University, Greenville 29613 Newberry College, Newberry 29108 Tennessee Carson-Newman College, Jefferson City 37760 Chattanooga, University of.

Each applicant must present a certified transcript of his academic record showing the courses he has taken, the number of credit hours earned, and the grades received. While few specific courses are required for admission (biology, economics, and mathematics), applicants must be aware that many fields within forestry require academic preparation of a specialized nature. Deficiencies, if any, may be satisfied in residence, possibly prolonging the time necessary to complete degree requirements. Students interested in specialized areas of fores- try should write the Dean for advice as to specific preparatory courses. An applicant who is a graduate of a professional school of forestry will pre- sent a certified transcript of his scholastic record. Before registering for the first semester of residence, students will be required to select the branch or branches of forestry in which they wish to concentrate the major part of their work and to prepare their proposed programs in conference with an appropriate faculty ad- visory committee. Applicants for all degree programs should plan to take the Graduate Record Examination in the fall preceding application for admission and notice of GRE scores should be sent to the School at time of application. The Admissions Committee of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies will evaluate and certify applicants to be admitted to all programs of the School. 19 Doctor of Forestry Degree Admission to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies for a pro- gram of study and research leading to the Doctor of Forestry degree is granted to a student who has received the Master of Forestry degree, or its equivalent. An applicant must file a formal application for admission together with transcripts of his undergraduate and graduate academic records. In his applica- tion he should clearly state the branch of forestry in which he desires to concen- trate and, if possible, his specific research interests. 20 Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy Degrees Applications for admission into A.M., M.S., and Ph.D. degree programs in Forestry should be submitted to the Director of Admissions, Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, for transmittal to the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. A student seeking admission to the Graduate School of Duke University must have received an A.B. orB.S. degree (or the equivalent in the case of foreign students) from an accredited institution. His undergraduate program should be well rounded and of such quality as to give positive evidence of the capacity for graduate study. Applicants for all degree programs of the School of Forestry and Environ- mental Studies will be considered for admission without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 21 Registration and Regulations Registration All students who enter course work or residence for credit, all students who have completed minimum requirements for an advanced degree but continue to use the facilities of the University in their research, all students with in absentia status, and all students who wish merely to audit a course or courses must regis- ter. After the applicant has received notification of his admission to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and has returned his statement of accept- ance of admission, he may present himself for registration. During the regis- tration periods, announced in this Bulletin, he first confers with an assigned faculty adviser who prepares and signs a course card which lists the course work to be taken during the semester. The student then presents this course card to registration officials who enroll him officially in his courses. After his first regis- tration period as a current student he will preregister at the stated times. Former students who intend to register to resume a degree program must give the Direc- tor of Admissions notice of this intention two months before registration. Late Registration. All students are expected to register or preregister at the times stated in this Bulletin. Those registering late, including those who are obliged to register in absentia, are subject to a late registration fee of $25. Change of Registration. During the academic year, within a period of four- teen days from the registration date, a student may change registration with the approval of his adviser if no reduction of fee is involved, or with the approval of the Dean if a reduction of fee is involved. During the first thirty days from the registration date, the only permissible change is dropping course-seminar reg- istration and adding equivalent units of research, with the approval of the stu- dent's adviser, the instructor of the course, and the Dean. A period of five weeks from the date of registration is provided for changes resulting from passing a preliminary examination. Normal Registration. A student is designated as fully registered when he registers for the credit his program requires. Required registration is set in con- sideration of the student's obligation to teach or assist in teaching and the stage he has reached in completion of degree requirements. In the academic year normal registration for the resident student who does not hold an appointment as part-time instructor or assistant or does not engage in part-time work is fifteen units a semester or thirty units an academic year. The normal registration for the student who holds such an appointment or undertakes such work is either twelve 23 units or a minimum of nine units, depending upon the number of hours a week he is required to devote to such duties. The resident student in a terminal A.M. or M.S. degree program which re- quires no thesis carries normal registration until he has met all degree require- ments. If a thesis is required and the student has met all requirements except for submitting his thesis, he registers for three units a semester while in residence or, if he elects to go out of residence, for one unit in absentia each semester until the thesis is accepted. The resident student engaged in a master's degree program which is not terminal but preparatory to a doctoral program registers as though he were a doctoral student. The resident student in a doctoral program carries normal registration through the semester in which he passes the preliminary examination. If he re- mains in residence, he continues to register for a minimum of three units a se- mester until the dissertation is accepted. If, before or after passing the prelimi- nary examination, he elects to go out of residence, he registers for one unit a se- mester in absentia in order to keep his program active. It is necessary to be a fully registered student according to the regulations listed above (except when registered in absentia) in order to establish eligibility for library carrel and laboratory space, for student housing, for University and some outside loans, and for the Student Health Service including voluntary insur- ance coverage. The registration of one unit a semester in absentia provides occasional con- sultation with the thesis or dissertation supervisor. It may be waived for mili- tary duty or serious problems of health. In the summer session six units a term is maximum registration. Students who are residents in the academic year and wish to continue study and the use of Uni- versity facilities including Student Health during the summer must register for one unit in the first summer session term. This registration provides use of these facilities for all terms. Academic Regulations Grades. Grades in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies are as follows: £ (exceptional); G (good);S (satisfactory); F (failing); and/ (incomplete). An I (incomplete) indicates that some portion of the student's work is lack- ing, for an acceptable reason, at the time grades are reported. The instructor who gives an / for a course specifies the date at which the student must make up the deficiency, in no case more than one calendar year from the date the course ended. If the course is not completed, the grade of F is entered upon the student's record unless his appeal to the Dean for the grade no credit is approved. A grade of F in any course may result in withdrawal from a degree program. Reciprocal Agreements with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina Central University. Under a plan of cooperation between the University of North Carolina and Duke University, students regularly enrolled in the Grad- uate Schools of the University of North Carolina during the regular academic year, and paying full fees to that institution, may be admitted to a maximum of two courses per semester in the Graduate School of Duke University upon pay- ment of a nominal registration fee of two dollars and of any other special fees regularly required of all students. Under the same arrangements, students in Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Graduate Schools of Duke Univer- sity may be admitted to course work at the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University. A similar arrangement exists with North Caro- lina Central University at Durham. 25 Resources for Study General and Research Facilities The School of Forestry and Environmental Studies is housed in the south wing of the Biological Sciences Building on the West Campus. General and re- search laboratories are provided for routine and original studies in all of the sub- ject matter fields. These laboratories are equipped with instruments and facilities for quantitative evaluation of biological materials and processes. Greenhouses and the phytotron adjoining the Biological Sciences Building and nearby Duke Forest offer excellent facilities for biological investigations in controlled and natural environments. An IBM system 370 Model 165 Digital Computer is avail- able for processing research data via terminal facilities at the School. Facilities of allied departments of the University are also available for advanced work in chemistry, economics, genetics, mathematics, plant anatomy, plant ecology, plant physiology, and many other fields. West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company has made available to Duke Uni- versity a field headquarters for work in the forests of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. This camp, located eighteen miles northwest of Summerville, South Caro- lina, is used as a base for field instruction in timber harvesting, wood utiliza- tion, soils, silviculture, and forest management. The School periodically sponsors conferences and symposia on industrial forest management and other technical and scientific subjects. These offer the current viewpoints of many outstanding individuals both in forestry and in allied fields. The University library, with 2,000,000 volumes and 4,000,000 manuscripts, provides exceptional resources and facilities for study and research by under- graduate and graduate students and by visiting scholars. About 80,000 volumes are added annually, and 164 foreign and domestic newspapers and 9,800 periodi- cals are received currently. Large collections of microfilms of rare books, news- papers, and periodicals are also available. The Biology-Forestry Library, Chemistry Library, and Physics-Mathematics Library are housed for convenience in the buildings of these departments. The libraries of the Schools of Divinity, Law, Medicine, and Engineering are also housed in the buildings of these schools, all on the West Campus. The library on East Campus includes another 171,000 volumes. The Duke Forest. The Duke Forest, of approximately 8,000 acres, is particu- larly well situated for field work. A five-minute walk from the campus will take one well into many parts of the area, and even the most distant portions can be reached by automobile in about twenty minutes. 27 At few other places in America are there provisions for extensive field study and research in forestry literally at the door of a large university. This natural out- door laboratory, so conveniently located and representative of the region, is a most valuable supplement to the instructional, laboratory, and library facilities of Duke University. The forest lies mainly in Durham and Orange Counties near the eastern edge of the Piedmont Plateau. A cross section of much of the woodlands in the upper Coastal Plain and lower Piedmont of the Southeast is represented in the forest with its variety of topography, soil, forest conditions, and patterns of past land use. Elevations range from 280 to 760 feet. The soils are derived from such diverse parent material as metamorphic rock of the Carolina slate formation, granite, Triassic sedimentary rock, and basic intrusives. Nearly one hundred tree species are represented. Some eighteen miles of improved woods roads make all parts of these woodlands accessible. Duke Forest serves as an outdoor laboratory for in- struction in forestry and allied fields, and as an experimental forest for research in problems of timber growing and in related sciences. It is also used to demon- strate methods of silviculture and forest management applicable to the region. Forestry Sciences Laboratory. The establishment of the Forestry Sciences Laboratory of the United States Forest Service's Southeastern Forest Experiment Station in the Research Triangle Park near Durham provides an unusual oppor- tunity for complementing the research programs of students in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Specialized research projects in forest ento- mology, pathology, and soils are currently under way at the laboratory. The re- search staff of the laboratory is available for consultation, participation in semi- nars, and service on graduate committees of students in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Arrangements may also be made for students to con- duct certain aspects of their research at the laboratory. 28 Phytotron. A controlled environment plant growth facility adjoins the Bio- logical Sciences Building. The Duke phytotron contains fifty separately con- trolled environmental areas. In the chambers and greenhouses it is possible to dissect any total environment in the world. Using this procedure, one can study the influence of many environmental factors on the growth processes of trees. The chambers accommodate trees up to six feet tall, the greenhouses even larger plants. The Duke phytotron is one of three such laboratories in the United States. Duke Environmental Center. The Duke Environmental Center is an inter- disciplinary University-wide organization for the encouragement and coordina- tion of research and training in environmental subjects. The Center provides students access to coursework, research, and expertise in all departments of the University and outside agencies involved in environmentally related activities. It also sponsors environmental courses and seminars and maintains an environ- mental reading and reference room. Students in the School of Forestry and En- vironmental Studies may become affiliated with the Environmental Center through working with one of several forestry faculty members who are involved in center activities. National Environmental Research Center. The Durham area has the greatest concentration of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offices and activities outside of Washington, D.C. The EPA National Environmental Research Center in the Research Triangle Park is the national center of air pollution research and regulation activities. This facility provides a unique opportunity for coopera- tive research and advanced training in air pollution and other environmental subjects. 29 Student Life Living Accommodations Housing. Duke University provides residence hall and apartment accom- modations for single graduate and professional men and women. Duke Univer- sity has a 500-unit housing facility known as Central Campus Apartments. The complex provides housing for married graduate and professional students, single undergraduate and graduate students, and single and married students in nondegree programs related to allied health. For single students the efficiencies and one, two, and three bedroom apart- ments are fully furnished. The apartments for married students include a few furnished efficiences and a number of one, two, and three bedroom units in which the kitchen, living room, and first bedroom are basically furnished and equipped. Eligible married students will find that the apartments provide eco- nomy and convenience yet allow them to introduce individual character by using their own furnishings and accessories. The monthly rental rates for each type of apartment are lower than those of- fered on the current local housing market. For further information on these apart- ments, married and single students should write: Manager of Apartments and Property, Duke University, 217 Anderson Street, Durham, North Carolina 27706. The University also will provide assistance to married graduate and pro- fessional students in locating suitable housing in Durham, where varied types of reasonably priced units are available. The Graduate Center, near the Medical Center, and Town House Apartments house men and women enrolled on a full-time basis in the graduate and profes- sional schools. Town House Apartments are located between East and West Campuses. The Graduate Center houses 148 male graduate students, 56 female grad- uate students, and 117 female undergraduate students. Commons facilities on the main floor are shared by men and women. Students are usually licensed to occupy graduate residential space for the academic year, but for no period less than a semester or specified term. Duke University operates Town House Apartments primarily for graduate and professional school students. Others are housed in individual apartments if the interests of the University are served. There are thirty-two two-bedroom units, each furnished for three occupants. Two students occupy the master bed- room with adjoining half-bath, and the third occupies a smaller bedroom. A liv- ing room, kitchen, and full bath complete the living arrangement. Additional features are air-conditioning and a swimming pool. The campus bus, serving all 31 parts of the University, is accessible to the Town House Apartments. Students must pay their own utilities for each apartment. The Department of Housing Management is prepared to assist the married graduate and professional school students in locating suitable housing in Dur- ham. There are many relatively new complexes and a few older apartments. Houses and duplex units are available in limited numbers from time to time. Detailed information about University housing facilities for single students and the housing assistance program for married students will be provided upon request by the Department of Housing Management, Duke University, Duke Station, Durham, North Carolina 27706. Rooms and residence halls and spaces in the Town House Apartments or other residential units may be reserved by applicants only if they have been ac- cepted by the graduate or professional schools and after the required $50 resi- dential deposit has been paid to the University. The initial residential deposit is required with the application and is held until the room or apartment is vacated. Application forms and detailed information on graduate housing will be mailed when the graduate or professional schools have notified the Department of Housing Management of official acceptance of the student. Single students may express a choice for the type of housing desired. Completed applications for rooms and apartments are to be returned with the required deposits to the De- partment of Housing Management. Assignment priority is established by the date completed applications and deposits are received in this office. Regulations governing occupancy of rooms and apartments will be provided by the Department of Housing Management at the time application forms are forwarded to accepted students. Occupants within each type of housing are ex- pected to comply with the appropriate regulations. For the cost of housing, see the section on Financial Information. Dining Service. The dining facilities on the West Campus include two cafe- terias with multiple-choice menus, a snack bar, and the Oak Room where full meals and a la carte items are served. In the Graduate Center there is a cafeteria with multiple-choice menus and a coffee lounge where sodas and sandwiches are served. Due to the large number served in the dining halls, it is not possible to ar- range special diets for individual students. 32 W.0 fv m ■ p 1 Services Available Medical Care. The aim of the University Health Service is to provide medi- cal care and health advice necessary to help the student enjoy being a part of the University community. To serve this purpose, both the University Health Services Clinic and the University Infirmary are available for student health care needs. The main components of the Health Service include the University Health Services Clinic, located in the Pickens Building on West Campus, and the Uni- versity Infirmary on the East Campus. Emergency transportation, if required, can be obtained from the Duke Campus Police. Residential staff personnel should be consulted whenever possible for assistance in obtaining emergency treatment. The facilities of the University Health Services Clinic are available during both regular and summer sessions to all currently enrolled full-time students. The facilities of the University Infirmary are available during the regular sessions only from the opening of the University in the fall until Graduation Day in the spring to all currently enrolled full-time students. To secure the benefits of the Student Health Program, a graduate student during the terms or semester in which the illness occurs, must (1) in the summer session term be registered for at least one unit of research or three units of course work, (2) be registered for at least nine units per semester if minimum residence requirements have not been met. Students are not covered during vacations, and their dependents and mem- bers of their family are not covered at any time. The resources of the Duke University Medical Center are available to all Duke students and their spouses and children. Charges for any and all services received from the Medical Center are the responsibility of the student as are the charges for services received from physicians and hospitals not associated with Duke University. 33 The Student Mental Health Service, under the direction of Dr. W. J. Kenneth Rockwell, is located in the Pickens Rehabilitation Building and provides evalu- ations and brief counseling and/or treatment for matters ranging from questions about normal growth and development to the most serious psychiatric disorders. The University has made arrangements for a Student Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan to cover all full-time students for a twelve-month period. For additional fees a student may obtain coverage for a spouse or spouse and child. Although participation in this program is voluntary, the University expects all graduate students to be financially responsible for medical expenses above those covered by the University Student Health Program through the University Acci- dent and Sickness Policy, a private policy, or personal financial resources. Stu- dents who have equivalent medical insurance or wish to accept the financial re- sponsibility for any medical expense may elect not to take the Duke Plan by sign- ing a statement to this effect. Each full-time student in residence must purchase this student health insurance or indicate the alternative arrangement. The Student Acci- dent and Sickness Insurance Policy provides protection twenty-four hours per day during the full twelve-month term of the policy for each student insured. Students are covered on and off the campus, at home, while traveling between home and school, and during interim vacation periods. Term of the policy is from opening day in the fall. Coverage and services are subject to change each year as deemed necessary by the University in terms of costs and usage. The Duke University Counseling Center. Through the counseling center, the University provides a professional counseling service designed to aid stu- dents in gaining a better understanding of themselves and the opportunities available to them. Counseling is available in the areas of career planning, edu- cational opportunities, and personal and social adjustment. The center maintains files of educational and vocational information related to career planning, graduate educational programs and fellowships, and study aids. National and University-wide testing programs are administered by the 34 center. A continuing program of research in the areas of counseling and testing is also carried on by the staff of the center. Office of Placement Services. Duke University maintains an Office of Place- ment Services which acts as a liaison between the University and potential em- ployers in business, education, and government. All services are offered without charge to Duke students and alumni. The staff is available to talk with students about their future professional plans. Students who wish to register with the office are offered an opportunity to assemble a complete dossier of academic records and recommendations to supplement applications for positions and to have a permanent file for future reference. Pertinent recommendations are far easier to accumulate during the time a student is enrolled at Duke. Interviews with representatives visiting Duke are scheduled throughout the year through the Placement Office for those students who have registered. Copies of academic records are released only with the permission of the individual. Student Activities Students new to Duke University are reminded that they are welcome to use such recreational facilities as swimming pools, tennis courts, golf course, and to affiliate with choral, instrumental, drama, and religious groups. Students are encouraged to maintain broad professional contacts by partici- pation in the activities of the Society of American Foresters, the Forest Products Research Society, the national honorary scientific society of Sigma Xi, and other societies appropriate to their major field of study. The social and business events of the Forestry club provide opportunities for many pleasant extracurricular activities. An active organization of the wives of forestry students, the Forestry Dames, offers a regular schedule for social oc- casions of interest to this group. Conduct of Students Duke University expects and will require of all its students continuing loyal cooperation in developing and maintaining high standards of scholarship and conduct. The University wishes to emphasize its policy that all students are subject to the rules and regulations of the University as are currently in effect or as are put into effect from time to time by the appropriate authorities of the University. Any student, in accepting admission, indicates his willingness to subscribe to and be governed by these rules and regulations and acknowledges the right of the University to take such disciplinary action, including suspension and/or ex- pulsion, as may be deemed appropriate, for failure to abide by such rules and regulations, or for conduct adjudged unsatisfactory or detrimental to the Uni- versity. Visiting Scholars The libraries and, to the extent practicable, other facilities of Duke Univer- sity will be made available to faculty members of colleges and universities who wish to spend a period of time on the campus in pursuit of their scholarly inter- ests. No fees will be charged such visitors unless they wish to participate in ac- tivities for which a special fee is assessed. Room and board may be arranged for at the regular rate in the dormitories and dining rooms. Dormitory space is usually available during the summer months. Inquiries concerning residence for visiting scholars should be directed to the Dean of the Graduate School. 35 Financial Information Tuition and Fees* The following table shows the charges collected from all students for the year 1975-1976. All charges for each semester are due and payable at the time specified by the University, and no student is admitted to classes until arrangements have been made with the Bursar of the University for the settlement of such charges. After the beginning of classes, no refund of tuition will be made except for in- voluntary withdrawal to enter the armed services or in accordance with estab- lished University policy.

Student Aid A number of fellowships, scholarships, and assistantships are allocated to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies for the encouragement and financial assistance of men and women who offer promise of becoming leaders in their fields. These are awarded to applicants of high character on the basis of scholastic ability as judged by previous educational performance, professional experience, personal references, and the Graduate Record Examination. Hold- ers of the awards will pay tuition and such additional fees as are regularly re- quired. Fellowships. Stipends range from $2,300 to $4,000 per academic year. Each recipient must have previously completed work equivalent to that required at Duke University for a master's degree with a major in forestry, environmental studies, or in a related basic discipline. Students receiving fellowships will de- vote their time to an approved program of study and research in any of the branches of forestry, and they are expected to become candidates for the Doctor of Forestry or Doctor of Philosophy degree. 39 Remission of Tuition. Children of ministers in the North Carolina and the Western North Carolina Annual Conferences of the United Methodist Church may be eligible to receive a remission of the tuition charge for a maximum of eight semesters of undergraduate study at Duke University. Eligibility is met by the parent being in a regular pastoral appointment; when the parent is in a spe- cial appointment, eligibility will be determined on an individual basis depend- ing upon the nature of the appointment. In all cases the decision of the University will be final. Scholarships. Stipends range from $600 to S3, 200 per academic year. Recipi- ents will usually devote their time to an approved program of study leading to the degree of Master of Forestry, Master of Environmental Management, or Master of Science with a major in forestry. Graduate Assistantships. Graduate assistantships have stipends ranging up to $4,000, depending upon available funds and upon whether granted for the academic year only, or the academic year plus summer. Recipients will devote half time to research or other work of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. They will be permitted to enroll for not more than twenty-four units in an academic vear in an approved program of studv, or program of study and re- search. Application for Awards. Anv student admitted to the School of Forestrv and Environmental Studies is eligible to apply for a fellowship, a scholarship, or an assistantship. Application for these awards may be made concurrentlv with the application for admission. The general procedures and requirements for applying for any financial award in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies are outlined below. Applicants should initiate the necessary action early to ensure that the required documents are filed with the Dean of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies on or before February 1 prior to enrollment. 1. File award application. Form will be supplied by the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies upon request. 2. Furnish supporting documents as follows: (a) official transcripts of record of all previous college or university credits earned and ( b) letters of reference from at least three persons familiar with the applicant's character, scholarship, and professional ability. (Documents offered in support of admission, if so desig- nated, may also serve in support of the application for financial award.) 3. Complete the Aptitude Test of the Graduate Record Examination. In- structions and application for admission to this locally administered examina- tion are available on most college campuses, from the Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, or by writing the Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey. Applicants should plan to take this examination in December or earlier. Notification of awards is made on March 15. In case vacancies occur, com- pleted applications received after February 1 will be considered at a later date. In every instance where a graduate assistantship, scholarship, or fellowship for the next academic year is offered to an actual or prospective graduate student and accepted before April 1, the recipient may resign his appointment without prejudice prior to that date by notification in writing to the Dean. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 1 obligates him not to accept another appointment without first obtaining formal release from the Dean of the School. Loans Students who are enrolled as full-time degree candidates and who have sat- isfactory academic and citizenship records are eligible to applv for student loans. 40 Champion Paper Foundation Fund. This fund was established in 1971 by a grant of the Champion Paper Foundation in support of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Students may apply for assistance from this fund through the Forestry Financial Aid Office. University Student Loans. The Duke University Federallv Insured Loan Pro- gram is one of four loan programs specifically designed to help Duke students to meet legitimate educational expenses. The other loan programs are the National Defense Student Loan program and the restricted University loan programs supported by privately donated funds. We recommend a review of each program to determine the one best suited to the individual student's needs and resources. Through Duke University and the federal government, students qualify for loans under the Federally Insured Student Loan Program. The federal govern- ment assumes risks for loans thus eliminating the collateral requirement. The University, however, must provide the loan funds for the program. The loan is cancelled in the case of the death or total and permanent disability of the bor- rower. The Duke University Federallv Insured Loan Program allows the student to borrow up to 52,500 per year at 7 percent interest. Repayment begins nine months after a student completes his education, and he will have up to ten years following graduation or withdrawal from the University to repay the loan. An interest subsidy is available from federal funds for all students who have demonstrated need through the Graduate and Professional School Financial Aid Service (GAPSFAS). In order to qualify for the interest subsidy from the govern- ment a GAPSFAS form must be submitted. Under the subsidy the federal gov- ernment will make the interest payments accruing during periods of full-time studv, military service, or service in Peace Corps or VISTA. Other Funds. In addition to local loan funds, Duke University participates in the student loan program established under the provisions of the National Defense Education Act of 1958. Repavment of these loan funds usually begins ten months after the student terminates full-time studv. Interest accrues at the rate of 3 percent per annum commencing nine months after termination of full-time study. Upon completion of the period of grace of nine consecutive months, the monthly repayment period begins, and simple interest on the loan at the rate of three percent starts to accrue. Special benefits to those teaching in certain public schools permit a portion of the loan to be cancelled, depending upon the length of teaching service. Applications and complete details regarding the student loan program may be obtained bv writing to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. In approving loan applications, the Student Loan Committee selects those students who, from the standpoint of financial need, are deserving of this consideration. All applications for loans should be made before July 1 preceding the academic year in which the student plans to matriculate. 41 Courses of Instruction General For. 152.
