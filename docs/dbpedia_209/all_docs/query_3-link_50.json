V & W\n\nDr. Jean Vacelet, 1935-, explored most of the reefs on earth and specialized in underwater caves, where he discovered many curious and novel sponge types. He published an article in Nature on the first carnivorous sponge ever to be found (in 1995) and after this article about Asbestopluma hypogea Norman, 1882, he has been involved if finding several more sponges (usually - as Asbestopluma - in the family Cladorhizidae), which catch and digest e.g. crustaceans. He is employed at the Station Marine d'Endoume at Marseille [Acanthella vaceleti Van Soest & Stentoft, 1988, Stelletta vaceleti Lévi & Lévi, 1983a, Vaceletia Picket, 1982, Vaceletida Reitner, 1992]. (Dr. Rob van Soest kindly provided this information).\n\nProf. Dr. Max(ime) Vachon, (4 Jan. - Dijon) 1908-1991 (3 Nov. - Paris), specialist of arachnids, particularly scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Director (1955-77) of the Laboratoire de Zoologie (Arthropodes) of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris. He is honoured in the amphipod name Elasmopus vachoni Mateus & Mateus, 1966 and in the diogenid hermit crab name Calcinus vachoni Forest, 1958. (Dr. Mark Judson, at the MNHN, Paris, kindly provided most of this information and Dr. Alain Crosnier from the same museum added the hermit crab name).\n\nSunniva Vader (neé Lønning), (27 Aug. - Fana) 1934-1985 (11 July - Tromsø), Norwegian zoophysiologist, is honoured in the amphipod name Bathyporeia sunnivae Bellan-Santini & Vader, 1988, the last author Prof. Dr. Wim (Willem Jan Marinus) Vader, 1937-, being her widower. He is curator of every kind of animals except insects at the Tromsø Museum and a generalist in fauna knowledge, but mainly a specialist on amphipods and has been the instigator and editor of the Amphipod Newsletter from 1970 on. He was born in the Netherlands, married, lived and worked in Bergen, Norway during the 1960s and early 1970s, but the family moved in 1973 to Tromsø, where he has stayed [Wimvadocus Krapp-Schickel & Jarrett, 2000, Epimeria vaderi Coleman, 1998, Metandania wimi Berge, 2001, also a terrestrial gastropod is named for him] (Prof. Vader himself kindly provided some informations).\n\nVagner : (see N.P.

He was an all round zoologist, but is most well-known as an ichthyologist [Valenciennea Bleeker, 1868, Valenciennellus Jordan & Evermann in Goode & Bean, 1896, Valenciennius Rousseau, in Démidoff, 1842, Valencinia de Quatrefages, 1846, Acropora valenciennesi (Milne Edwards & Haime, 1860), Ophiacantha valenciennesi Lyman, 1879, Glossodoris valenciennesi (Cantraine, 1835), Nemadactylus valenciennesi, Hypselodoris valenciennesi (Cantraine, 1841), Lithuaria valenciennesi d'Hondt, 1984, Montastrea valenciennesi (Milne Edwards & Haime 1848), Symphyllia valenciennesi Milne Edwards & Haime, 1849, Valenciennellus Jordan & Evermann in Goode & Bean, 1895, Pachyseris valenciennesi , Oculina valenciennesi Milne Edwards & Haime, 1850, Callionymus valenciennei Temminck & Schlegel, 1845].\n\nThe cowry name Leporicypraea valentia (Perry, 1811) is in honour of Lord Valentia, who aquired the first specimen. This person is likely identical with George Annesley, Earl of Mountnorris, Viscount Valentia, (2 Nov.) 1769-1844 (23 July), who published about his \"Voyages and travels to India, Ceylon, the Red Sea, Abyssinia, and Egypt : in the years 1802, 1803, 1804, 1805, and 1806\".\n\nValentich-Scott : (see Scott).\n\nLacking information about Valentin (or Valentini) in the fish name Canthigaster valentini (Bleeker, 1853). Possibly a tribute to the German physician and physiologist Prof. Dr. Gabriel Gustav Valentin, (8 July - Breslau) 1810-1883 (24 May - Bern, Switzerland), or perhaps more likely (due to the species' Indian Ocean distribution) honouring the Dutch priest, traveller and malacologist François Valentijn (Valentinyus), (17 Apr. - Dordrecht) 1666-1727 (6 Aug. - The Hague), from 1685 to -94 working in the Moluccas and from 1706 to 1714 in East Java?\n\nValentina : (see Chernysheva).\n\nClare A. Valentine, 1964-, at the British Museum (Nat.

Also Niphargus zorae G. Karaman, 1967 (described by her son) is in her honour.\n\nThe bivalve name Yoldiella valettei Lamy, 1906 is not honouring Adolf Johann Hubert, Freiherr von La Valette Saint George, (14 Nov. - Schloss Auel) 1831-1910 (29 Nov. - Bonn). Lamy mentions that a M. Valette, Buenos Aires, collected the species, so Luciano Honoratio Valette, (20 Aug. (or 2 Sep.?) - Montevideo) 1880-1957, an Uruguayan zoologist (mainly later working on fisheries), who at age 17 had arrived to Buenos Aires and in 1904 together with i.a. two other persons from Argentina took part in W.C.

Sars, 1877 and the amphipod name Chaetogammarus warpachowskyi (G.O. Sars, 1905) must likely be tributes to Nikolai Arkadievich (or Abramovich) Varpakhovskij, (11 Nov. - Kazan province) 1862-1909, who published on fish fauna.\n\nMarcus Terentius Varro, (Reate (today Rieti)) 116-27 B.C. (Rome), (with the additional name Reatinus after his birth place), the most learned person of the Roman golden age, belonging to an old Sabinean family. He had been an officer in Pompeius' troups and was a close friend of Pompeius. His last war duty was in France 49 B.C., when he had to give up for Gaius Iulius Caesar, (12 July) 100-44 (15 Mar.) B.C., who was well aware of Varro's intellectual capacity and put him on a duty to collect literature to a city library for Rome. Varro not only gathered literature, but also had an almost inbelievable capacity to publish himself on almost every kind of items and had evidently read most of the availavle books of his time. He produced ca 74 works in around 620 \"books\", most of them sorrily lost today. He was well respected among other intellectuals of his time, like Titus Pomponius Atticus, 110 (or 109?)-32 (31 Mar.) B.C., and Pomponius' close friend Marcus Tullius Cicero (3 Jan.) 106-43 (7 Dec.) B.C., and did himself dedicate the last 20 (of 25) books of his De lingua latina (with i.a. etymological explanations) to Cicero and Cicero answered by dedicating his Academica to Varro. They were friends, but not very close, although they shared many views and Varro is sometimes said to have been even more [conservatively] Roman than Cicero. Possibly they were in a way related, because Cicero's wife Terentia, 98 BC.-4 A.C. (sic!, thus around 103 years old when she died), was daughter of a member of the Terentii family and she may have belonged to the same branch of the family, Terentii Varrones, as M.T. Varro, because one of Cicero's cousins was a Varro, so she may have belonged to the same family. (She divorced from Cicero around 47 or 46 B.C., after Cicero's excile). After the murder of Caesar both Cicero and Varro ended up on the proscription lists of Caesars old officer and distant relative Marcus Antonius, 83-31 B.C., but unlike Cicero and most of his family, Varro was saved by friends and was later gaining protection from Octavianus (Augustus), although his books had been burned and his property partly destroyed by Antonius' troups, but Octavianus later restored his property and he could spend the rest of his life in studies and writing. His writing on natural history was a small part of his publishing (which to a great part seems to have been satirical and burlesque), but e.g. Res rusticae in 4 books (written at age 80 for his wife Fundania, who had just purchased an estate, a farm) has been saved and is mainly dealing with agriculture and in book 4 one can read about i.a. fish breeding and bee keeping and the bee parasite Varroa Oudemans, 1904 must be named for him. He warned his comtemporaries to avoid swamps and marshland, because he was convinced that in such areas lived minute organisms, too small to be seen, but unhealthy to breath in, so in a way he preceded modern microbiologists. He had studied under the philologist Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus, ca 154-74 B.C., (as also Cicero did) and later in Athens under the philosopher Antiochos of Ascalon, ca 125 (127-124)-ca 68 (69-67) B.C., (who also had Cicero as his disciple and Cicero admired him much). In his \"Nine books of Disciplines\" dealing with grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical theory, medicine and architecture, Varro preceded Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ≈490-583, who later in his influential book \"Institutiones\" (aimed for teaching of monks) dealt with seven \"artes liberales\", which he thought that schools should teach beside religion: grammatica, rhetorica, dialectica (i.e. logic), arithmetica, musica, geometria and astronomia, and the first three of these items (called trivia) should be teached to all (hence our word trivial - from these trivial studies) and the last four (called quadrivia) should be teached in advanced studies. Cassiodorus Senator thus omitted Varro's items medicine and architecture, which he likely thought was suited for special students. Varro also somtimes delivered practical advice like Varro's rule of banquets: the number of guests of a succesful feast should not be less than the number of graces (3) and fewer than the number of muses (9), likely something he had learned from own practical experiences. Although perhaps not a primary person in marine biology, he was influential through Gaius Plinius Secundus (q.v.), who often used information from Varro in his Naturalis Historia.\n\nThe hydroid name Crypthelia vascomarquesi Zibrowius & Cairns, 1992 must be a tribute to Vasco Monteiro Marques, 19??-, of Lisboa, who has published on octocorals together with Zibrowius and Grasshoff.\n\nLacking information about Vasina? in the isopod name Eurycope vasinae Malyutina & Kussakin, 1996.

In Genova he published a catalogue about the marine invertebrates of the area in 1846 and in 1851 he published on Mediterranean cephalopods. He published partly together with his disciple Vogt (see Fritz Müller), and was likely somewhat inspired by his forerunner and colleague Risso (q.v.).

For his educational and social activities on Aruba he was decorated both by the Pope and the Dutch Queen. From about 1962 until 1992 he collected and studied marine molluscs on Aruba. He was especially interested in micro-shells. He published a single, popular article on molluscs, but contributed as co-operator to a book by De Jong & Coomans (1988) on the 'Marine Gastropods from Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire'. Although he was never a member of the Dutch Malacological Society, he maintained close connections with some of its members, but even more with the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam (ZMA). Shortly after his return to the Netherlands he donated his collection to that Institute. Almost until his sudden death he visited regularly the ZMA in order to work on his collection. So far two marine gastropods from the Caribbean has been named after him: Crassispira verbernei De Jong & Coomans, 1988 and Triphora verbernei Moolenbeek & Faber, 1989 (now transferred to the genus Cheirodonta).

He also visited the Fiji Islands and Australia and dredged off New Foundland in 1876 and arrived to Stt John's again in the summer 1880 in order to study the Bank fishery and also the traditional shore and seal fisheries and their catching and curing methods, which he had been interested in after his first visit in 1876, when he came in order to dredge for mollusks and he evidently arrived also a third summer. He kept publishing at least until 1882 [Colus verkruezeni (Kobelt, 1876), Buccinum verkruzeni Kobelt, 1883, Turbonilla verkruezeni.

As all these children were born to to the same parents in St. George, Everton, the parents were very likely married to each other and living there, when their children grew up. (Dr. Anders Warén kindly mentioned that T.A. Verkrützen in the foreword of his work from 1872. \"Norwegen: seine Fjorde und Naturwunder: eine naturwissenschaftlice Reise unternommen im Sommer 1871\" is mentioning that he has lived abroad during 42 years and considering the age of his son, he must have been born before 1825 (perhaps likely around 1820) and that he he lived at least until 1884, but the compiler also having seen references to Verkrüzen 1887, but not later) Verkrüzen seems to have left Britain during the past part of his life and returned to Preussia, evidently living in Schwanheim am Main, just as his younger colleague Dr. Kobelt (q.v.), together with whom, he cooperated during his last active years, did, so Kobelt would have been a very likely person to have written an obituary, but a such thing does not seem to exist.\n\nThe red algal name Osmundea verlaquei G.

Another malacologically interested compatriot, ornithologist and namesake was Jean Baptiste Édouard Verreaux, 1810-1868 (14 Mar.), who was a brother of Jules and Alexis and at the time of his death, the most extensive dealer in specimens in the world. Their father's name (the founder of Maison Édouard Verreaux around 1803) was Jacques Philippe Verreaux and their Mother Josephine was sister of Delalande (see below). P.J. V. already at age between 11 and 12 arrived at Cape of Good Hope in company with his uncle Delalande (q.v. under La Lande), an expedition started in 1818, stayed there in 2 years, after which he returned to France, studying under Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In 1825 he returned to Cape of Good Hope, where he collected together with i.a. Sir A. Smith (q.v.) and later his brother Édouard arrived and helped him to handle specimens. In 1832 these brothers again were collecting together. In 1837 P.J. V. travelled collecting in Cochin-China and the Philippines.

However, those who are overwhelmed by his numerous and excellent works in this field are always surprised to hear that his REAL love and work is with hydroids. Dr. Vervoort has 18 species of copepods named after him, e.g. Macrochiron vervoorti Humes & De Maria, 1966, Patagoniaella vervoorti Pallares, 1968, Epicalymma vervoorti Heron, English & Damkaer, 1984 , Ectinosoma vervoorti Soyer, 1972, Esola vervoorti Huys & Lee, 2000, Collocheres vervoorti Humes, 1998, Enhydrosoma vervoorti Fiers, 1987, Mixtocalanus vervoorti (Park 1980), Nothobomolochus vervoorti Avdeev, 1986, Holobomolochus vervoorti R.

Travelling skilled bryozoologist. He is the youngest son of the painter artist Emanuel Vigeland, 1875-1948, brother of the very well known Gustav Vigeland, 1869-1943, creator of the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Oslo. Imm Vigeland very often spent years travelling the seas and exotic countries, collecting bryozoans and other animals with a small dredge in his luggage, which when not used as a dredge, was used as one of his luggage bags. He also learned to speak exotic languages, e.g. Malay, fluently and became involved in the cryptozoologial searchiing of \"Bigfoot\". Honouring his name is Ophiothrix vigelandi A.M. Clark, 1968, like e.g. at least one spider species.

(The last name is likely a courtesy recompense for the polychaete name Maupasia Viguier, 1886). He was likely a relative of Dr. Louis Guillaume Alexandre Viguier, 1790-1867, French physician, bookseller and and botanist of Montpellier, who is honoured in the the genus Viguiera, Humboldt, Bonpland & Knuth (a Compositeae). C. Viguier became a Docteur Es Sciences Naturelles in Paris in 1879.\n\nThe Myxozoan name Leptotheca vikrami Tripathi,1948 is likely not honouring a person's name, but the Vikram University, India.\n\nLacking information about Vilaevelebit (if over head a person's name and not e.g. having connectoin with the Velebit mountans in Croatia?) in the hydroid name Tiaropsidium vilaevelebiti (Hadzi, 1915).\n\nCurtis Nathaniel Vilas, 1894-1976, and his wife Naomi Agnes Rowe Vilas, 1907-1989, were Florida malacologists.\n\nLacking information about Vilela in the copepod name Eudactylina vilelai Nunes-Ruivo, 1954.\n\nWho is Vilhelmina in the Greenland isopod name Tole vilhelminae (Stephensen, 1913) collected by the Danish zoologist and geologist Dr. Valdemar Johan Heinrich Nordmann, 1872-1962, in 1909?

Mienis, Tel Aviv Univ., kindly provided all this information).\n\nAnna Petronella Cornelia de Vos, (14 Jan. - Amsterdam) 1893-1958 (21 Mar. - Loosdrecht), Dutch curator of invertebrates at the Zoological Museum, Amsterdam from 1938, interested in freshwater crustaceans, mainly ostracods. Before her curatorship at the museum, she had worked at Den Helder as assistant to Redeke (q.v.).\n\nKirill Alexandrovich Voskresensky (Moscow) 1913-1987, zoologist-hydrobiologist, disciple of L. A. Zenkevich (q.v.), one of founders of Belomorskaya biological station of Moscow Uniiversity, teacher of invertebrate zoology chair in Moscow University. The nematode name Daptonema voskresenskii Tchesunov, 1990, is in honour of him. (Prof. Albina Gaevskaya, Sevastopol, kindly provided this information).\n\nThe bivalve name Fulvia voskuili Healy & Lamprell, 1992 is honouring Ron Voskuil, 1963-, Delft, The Netherlands, interested in e.g. Cardiidae & Brachiopods.\n\nProf. Dr. Gualtherus Carel Jacob Vosmaer, (29 Aug.) 1854-1916 (23 Sep.), Dutch spongiologist, son of the poet and Rembrandt monographer Carel Vosmaer, (20 Mar.) 1826-1888 (12 June), and descendant of the naturalist Aernout Vosmaer, 1720-1799, the European introducer of the orang-outang, who was a fanatical collector and directed the menagerie and zoological cabinet of Prince William V of Holland. (Pennant (q.v.), who together with P.S. Pallas (q.v.) met A. Vosmaer there in 1765, described him as frenchified and extremely ignorant). Young Vosmaer - after having finished gymnasium school in The Hague - began university studies in Leiden 1873 (biology under C.C. Hoffman (q.v.)), went later to Graz, Austria, and worked under F.E. Schultze (q.v.). In 1880 he achieved his PhD in Leiden on a thesis on sponges. After spending two years as high school teacher in The Hague, he became Anton Dohrn's (q.v.) assistent at the Zoological Station in Naples between 1882-88 and began working on what would later become the famous Bay of Naples monograph (published 1935, many years after his death). He succeded Hoffman at the professorship in Leiden in 1904, but had spent the time before this as assistent and after that lecturer in the Zoology Department of Utrecht University. He published several articles and monographs on sponges from all over the world. He published several essential studies on Arctic sponges collected by the whaling ship \"Willem Barents\" and was asked to contribute to the influential monographic series \"Dr Bronn's Klassen und Ordnungen des Thierreichs\". After his sudden death his wife with the help of Maurice Burton (q.v.) posthumously published the two monumental Bay of Naples volumes with the plates&emdash;with many water colours of sponges in their natural state&emdash;as a separate volume. His collections are deposited in the Leiden Museum [Astrella vosmaeri Sollas, 1888, Mycale vosmaeri (Levinsen, 1886), Grantia vosmaeri Dendy, 1892, Oligoceras vosmaeri Lendenfeld, 1889, Psammoclema vosmaeri Poléjaeff, 1884, Synops vosmaeri Sollas, 1886,Vosmaeria Fristedt, 1885, Vosmaeria Lendenfeld, 1885, Vosmaeropsis Dendy, 1892, Asbestopluma vosmaeri (Levinsen, 1886), Pontobdella vosmaeri Apathy, 1888].

Two other U.S. cephalopod writers are related to the him: Nancy A. Voss, 1929-, published from 1962 on and still (2004) at RSMAS, is his widow [Vosseledone Palacio, 1978 is honouring both of them] and Dr. Robert S. Voss, 19??-, (PhD at Univ. of Michigan in 1983; now working on marsupials at AMNH) who co-authored two papers with N.A.Voss from 1962 & 1983, is their son.

Voss).\n\nThe zoologist and entomologist Prof. Dr. Julius Vosseler, 1861-1933 (Hamburg), Director of the Zoological Garden, Hagenbeck in Hamburg from 1909, published on copepods and amphipods (e.g. the Hyperiidea from the German Plankton expedition) [Scina vosseleri Tattersall, 1906]. A street in Hamburg is also named for him.\n\nVotadini in the nematode name Neotonchus votadinii (Warwick, 1971) is not a person's name, but the name of a tribe of Celts living in NE Scotland (today the area around Edinburgh) during the Roman time and older Medieval time. Their land was known as Manaw Goddodin during the older Medieval time and it was later conquered by the Northumbrians. (Tommy Tyrberg, Sweden, kindly informed about the Votadini tribe).\n\nLacking information about Voy in the Californian gastropod name Antiplanes voyi (Gabb, 1866). Of course the French zoologist André Voy, 1906-, is too young to be the honoured person in this name. C.D. Voy, 18??-1???, Oakland, active i.a. during the 1850s and 1860s, e.g. as a collector of minerals, shells and fossils in the California gold fields, selling his collections in the beginning of the 1870s, may likely be the honoured person in this name.\n\nIlya Gavrilovich Voznesenski, 1816-1871, preparator of the St Petersburg Zoological Museum, who in 1839-49 collected in Alaska, California and Siberia [Mopalia wosnessenskii A. T. Von Middendorff, 1847, Rhinolithodes wosnessenskii F. Brandt, Idotea wosnesenskii F. Brandt, 1851, Placentron wosnessenskii Schalfeew, 1892, Rhinolithodes wosnessenskii Brandt 1848]. (Don Cunningham kindly provided much of this information).\n\nThe cowry name Erronea vredenburgi Schilder, 1927 is a tribute to Ernest Watson Vredenburg, (17 Apr. - Boyonne, N.J.) 1870-1923 (12 Mar.), who in 1927 together with i.a. Cossman (q.v.) posthumously published on Indian fossil molluscs..\n\nMrs. Paula Vreeland, 19??-, collected the first specimens of Elysia vreelandae Marcus & Marcus, 1970 in Mexico.\n\nLacking information about Mr. G.J.

Vriese, 1904-1988, Dutch malacologist.\n\nDr. Tamara Vucetic, (Sep.) 1925-, Split, is working on zooplankton ecology.\n\nThe Jamaican tanaid name Calozodion wadei L.F. Gardiner, 1973, is not a tribute to the Irish palaeo-ichthyologist Robert Thompson Wade, (8 Oct.) 1884-1967 (23 Sep.), who published on fossils from Australia, but likely to Dr. Barry A. Wade, 19??-, educated in Jamaica and USA, who in 1972 published on a soft bottom community in Kingston Harbour, Jamaica, likely now (2010) retired..\n\nLacking information about Wadd in the Australian blind shark name Brachaelurus waddi (Bloch & Schneider, 1801).\n\nProf. Dr. Mats Waern, (28 May) 1912-1998 (2 Apr.), Swedish algae researcher. Pioneer of scientific diving in Sweden. He began diving before the SCUBA time and when collecting material for his PhD. His mother had to pump air via a hand pump down a tube to her diving son [Waerniella Kylin, 1947, Tabularia waernii Snoejis in Snoejis & Kuylenstierna, 1991].\n\nWagenaar Hummelinck : (See Hummelinck).\n\nProf. Dr. Guido Richard Wagener, (12 Feb. - Berlin) 1822-1896, (10 Feb. - Marburg), Marburg, German physician, anatomist and helminthologist, who also was a large collector of music manuscripts. [Echinophallus wageneri (Monticelli, 1890)].\n\nThe amphipod name Stegocephaloides wagini (Gurjanova, 1936) is likely a tribute to Prof. Vladimir L'vovich Vagin or Wagin, 1907-1984, Kazan State, Univ., (who himself - when using English - spelled his name with a W) who at least between 1937-1976 published on Ascothoracida. [Waginella Grygier, 1983].

After a few years of study in Göttingen of natural sciences, he traveled in the countries around the Black Sea, publishing about this in the end of the 1840s and beginning of the 1850s. Later he collected botany in North and Central America in 1853&endash;1854 and in Panama and Ecuador in 1857&endash;1860. In 1862 he became a honorary professor of geography and ethnography at the Univ. of München. He was a younger brother of Rudolf Wagner (see Leuckart).\n\nProf. Nicolaus (Nicolai Petrivitsch or Nicolai Petrovich) Wagner (or perhaps more correct Vagner), 1829-1907, Russian zoologist in St Petersburg, originally working in Kazan, who in 1885 published \"Die Wirbellosen des Weissen Meeres\" in Leipzig about invertebrates collected during summer months in the White Sea area between 1877-82. (See also Kessler). Wagner left the university in 1894 and began publishing several literary works, like \"The Fairy-tales of the Kitty Cat\" and was interested in spiritualism. His most well-known disciple was Mereschkowski (q.v.). [Wagnerella Mereschkowski, 1878].\n\nWagner, Rudolf : (see Leuckart).\n\nProf. Dr. Bruno Wahl, (12 Dec. Salzburg) 1876-1971 (19 Mar. - Salzburg), who in 1899 had published on entomology in Wien (Vienna), published on dalyellids and umagillids in Jena in 1910 [Wahlia Westblad, 1930 and Collastoma wahli Ponce de Leon & Mane-Garzon, 1980].\n\nParanaitis wahlbergi (Malmgren, 1865) is described from Spitsbergen, probably from Wahlbergöya, named for P.P. Wahlberg, possibly an error for the botanist Prof. Dr. Peter Fredrik Wahlberg, (19 June - Lackarebäck, outside Göteborg) 1800-1877 (22 May - Stockholm), (because a P.P. Wahlberg can not be found in connection with Svalbard or Scandinavia) or possibly (but less likely) the name of this worm is honouring the memory of P.F.:s brother, engineer Johan August Wahlberg, (9 Oct.) 1810-1856 (6 Mar. - Lake Ngami, Bechuanaland), collector for the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, who was killed by a wounded game during elephant hunting [Nucella wahlbergi C. F. Krauss, 1848, Comanthus wahlbergi (J. Müller), possibly Cryptophallus wahlbergi Bock, 1913]. J.A.W. is honoured in several bird and mammal names and in a tree name.\n\nDr. Ragnar Wahrberg, 1889-1930, Swedish specialist on isopods, upper secondary school teacher (läroverksadjunkt), connected with the bottom fauna surveys in the Kattegatt and the Skagerrak initiated by Jägerskiöld (q.v. - see also Oldevig and Alander) [Wahrbergia Verhoeff, 1926, Mugga wahrbergi Eliason, 1955].\n\nThe protoctist writer George Herbert Wailes, 1862-1945, F.L.S. (in 1911), honoured in the bacillariophycean name Coscinodiscus wailesii Gran & Angst, 1931, the polychaete name Eunereis wailesi Berkeley & Berkeley, 1954 and in the amoeba names Wailesella and Pseudocorythion wailesi Golemansky, 1971 published on Protozoa (e.g. Tintinnidae) from British Columbia in 1932, so possibly Canadian, but he had earlier published on British fresh water Rhizopoda and Heliozoa for the Ray Society, so more probably originally from the British Isles.\n\nThe asteroid name Acodontaster waitei (Koehler, 1920), is likely a tribute to the English-born ichthyologist Edgar Ravenswood Waite, (5 May - Leeds, Yorkshire) 1866-1928 (19 Jan. - Hobart, Tasmania), may be the honoured person. He worked from 1893 in Australia (curator of fishes in the Sydney Museum until 1906), the Canterbury Museum, New Zealand for eight years and later director of the South Australia Museum [likely the E Indian Ocean skate name Irolita waitii (McCulloch, 1911), Anchistylis waitei Hale, 1929].\n\nThe diatom name Dickieia wajdae Witkowski, Lange-Bertalot & Metzeltin, 2000 is dedicated \"to our colleague Mrs. Wieslawa Wajda,\" 19??-, \"marine geologist in Fairbanks, Alaska\".\n\nDr. Johann(es) Julius Walbaum, (30 June - Wolfenbüttel) 1724-1799 (21 Aug. - Lübeck), German physician and naturalist (owner of a cabinet of natural objects in Lübeck, where he worked; the cabinet was destroyed during WW II), describing several unknown species from remote parts of the globe (such as Sphyraena barracuda, etc.).\n\nHenrietta H.T. Walcott, 1825-1903, US Malacologist.\n\nLacking information about Waldeck in the amphipod name Waldeckia Chevreux, 1906.\n\nProf. Dr. Johann Gotthelf Friedrich Fischer de Waldheim, (13 Oct. - Waldheim, Saxony) 1771-1853 (18 Oct. - Moscow), paleontologist of German origin active in Moscow (where he achieved a professorship in natural history in 1804 after medical studies in Leipzig and then natural history studies in Wien and Paris, to which cilies he had traveled in company with his friend von Humboldt (q.v.)) and studied e.g. palaeontology for Cuvier (q.v.), invited to Russia from Mainz, where he worked as a techer in natural history and as a librarian), i.a. on Foraminifera and Brachiopoda [Waldheimia King, 1850, non Brullé, 1846].\n\nMr. Alfred Osten Walker, 1832-1925 (another year of decease - 1936 - given by the National Archives of U.K. for this \"meteorologist\" is likely an error), F.L.S., worked in the Liverpool area, collecting crustaceans (isopods, amphipods, etc.), inspired by i.a. Norman (q.v.), publishing at least between 1898-1916]. He lived in Chester, then Colwyn Bay (N Wales) before retiring to Maidstone (Kent) with his wife, but becoming a widower in Apr. 1917. He was an industrialist who had an amateur interest in marine natural history. He was responsible, with W.A.Herdman (q.v.) and others of the LMBC, for establishing the Marine Biological Laboratory at Port Erin in 1892 on the Isle of Man (subsequently taken over by the University of Liverpool, but closed down in 2006). There are several peracarids named after him, mostly amphipods [Oradarea walkeri Shoemaker, 1930, Syrrhoites walkeri Bonnier, 1896, Halicoides walkeri (Ledoyer, 1973), Antatelson walkeri (Chilton, 1912), Cheiriphotis walkeri Stebbing, 1918, Epimeriella walkeri K.H.Barnard, 1930,, Metopoides walkeri Chevreux, 1906, Paramoera walkeri (Stebbing, 1906), Podocerus walkeri Rabindranath, 1972.Also the cumacean Ekleptostylis walkeri (Calman, 1907) and an isopod Sphaeroma walkeri Stebbing, 1905 (Indo-Pacific, but one of the most ship transported isopods in the world) were named for him]. Mr. Walker, 18??-1???, of Exeter, often referred to by Bate & Westwood during the 1860s as a collector, is not identical with A.O. Walker. (Prof. Geoff Walker at the Millport Station, Isle of Cumbrae, is (2003) preparing a biography of A.O. Walker and kindly provided much of the information above).\n\nProf. Dr. Boyd Wallace Walker, (26 May - Manhattan, Kansas) 1917-2001 (19 Sep.), of the University of California, Los Angeles. PhD at Scripps in 1949, as a disciple of Carl Hubbs (q.v.). Retired in 1980 [Olivella walkeri Berry, 1958, Knefastia walkeri Berry, 1958, Epitonium walkerianum Hertlein & Strong, 1951].\n\nBryant Walker, (3 July - Detroit, Michigan) 1856-1936 (26 May - Detroit), US lawyer and Malacologist, specialized in terrestrial and limnic species.\n\nThe hagfish name Paramyxine walkeri (Charmion, McMillan & Wisner, 2004), was named for Dr. H.J. Walker Jr., 1950-, a senior museum scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrates Collection. (Peter Brueggeman, Director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography Library, kindly provided this information).\n\nThe Rev. Prof. Dr. John Walker, (Canongate, Edinburgh) 1731-1803, MD and DD (Doctor of Divinity) in 1765, professor of natural history at the University of Edinburgh and minister of the parish of Moffat, who in 1812 posthumously published \"Essays in Natural History\", Edinburgh [Walkeria Fleming, 1823, likely Erronea walkeri (Sowerby, 1832) , which was based on \"Mr. Walker's collection\"].\n\nLiotia walkeri Sowerby, 1908, Urosalpinx walkeri Sowerby, 1908 and Latirus walkeri Melvill, 1895 were named for Mr. J.J. Walker, who dredged specimens. This may likely have been Commander James John Walker, (16 May - Sheerness) 1851-1939 (12 Jan.), F.L.S., U.K. marine engineer, entomologist and malacologist, living in Summertown, Oxford after retirement and had collected much, especially entomology on land during his many cruises with the Royal Navy.\n\nRay Walker, 19??-, in the gastropod name Dermomurex raywalkeri R. Houart, 1986 is an Australian shell collector and dealer, owner of \"AMORA SHELLS\", 4 Jennifer Way, Rossmoyne 6155, Western Australia. He has collected all type specimens of this species off Pinneroe Point just north of Perth in 10 m depth of water under rock on limestone reef, Feb. 1984. (Dr. Hans Turner, Casa La Conchiglia, Rovia, Switzerland, kindly provided this information).\n\nLacking information about Walker in the Philippine gastropod name Lataxiena walkeri G. B. Sowerby III, 1908. Possibly this person may be the archaeologist and geologist Robert Bruce Napoleon Walker, 1832-1901, F.R.G.S., F.A.S., F.G.S., C.M.Z.S., West African trader, colonial servant, explorer and collector of zoological specimens, but more likely a tribute to J.J. Walker (above)?\n\nThe coral name Acropora wallacea Veron, 1990 must be a tribute to Dr. Carden C. Wallace, 194?-, Museum of Tropical Queensland, Townsville. She was one of the scleractinean workers, who in 1984 detected the unique mass annual (synchronized) spawning among the Great Barrier Reef coral species.\n\nThe South African gastropod name Nipponaphera wallacei Petit & Harasewych, 2000 is not a tribute to the well-known British collector, zoogeographer and evolutionist Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, (8 Jan. - Usk) 1823-1913 (7 Nov. - Broadstone), who travelled much in Brazil and the Malayan archipelago, but to Mr. Martin Wallace, 19??-, who collected the type specimens.\n\nThe South African Ichthyologist Dr. John H. Wallace, 19??-, after some years as ichthyologist at J.L.B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology, later director of Port Elizabeth Museum until retiremant, is honoured in the SE Atlantic & W Indian Ocean Yellow spotted skate name Leucoraja wallacei (Hulley, 1970).\n\nProf. Dr. Hans Thure Sigurd Wallengren, (24 Nov. - Trolle-Ljungby) 1864-1938, PhD (on ciliates) at the Univ. of Lund, Sweden in 1897 [Lagenophrys wallengreni Abonyi, 1928]. He had published in orhithology in 1893, likely inspired by his father Hans Daniel Johan Wallengren, (8 June - Lund) 1823-94 (25 Oct. - Farhulty, Höganäs), who had studied zoology under Sven Nilsson (q.v.) and published valuable works about birds and gastropods, but during his time as clergyman, the interest of Wallengren Sr. became focused on entomology and he published much in this field, especially regarding lepidoptera and neuroptera. Hans Wallengren, however, turned to the ciliates, probably inspired by his mentor, Prof. Quennerstedt (q.v.), but after having published 4 thick volumes (between 1894-1900) on these organisms, also he turned to i.a. entomology, but had a broad biological interest. He served as professor of Zoology in Lund between 1908-29, bot served alsa as a liberal politician. His cousin Sven Axel Olaus Wallengren, (26 Jan. - Lund) 1865-1896 (4 Dec. - Berlin), born Svensson, but used later his mother's family name, was during his young years very interested in botany, but became a well-known Swedish author, who used the pseudonym \"Falstaff, fakir\", technically reminding somewhat of the contemporary US author Samuel Langhorne Clemens, (30 Nov. - Florida, Missouri) 1835-1910 (21 Apr. - Stormfield), alias \"Mark Twain\", but with own characteristics, such as the uninhibited fantasy, the cynical stringens, the scepticism and the proud Bohemian superman attitude towards life.\n\nEdward Waller, 1803-1873 (14 Feb.), Irish land owner (and also owner of a yacht used for i.a. dredgings) of Lissenderry, near Aughnacloy, Co. Tyrone (his summer home), but working as a barrister and living in Finnoe House, Borrisokane, the county Tipperary and thus the eldest brother of John Francis Waller, (Limerick) 1810-1894 (19 Jan.), the Irish poet and. i.a. composer of \"The spinning wheel\", who were sons of Thomas Maunsell Waller, ca 1773-1843 (20 Nov.) and Margaret Vereker, ca 1782-18??, (who had married in 1802), of Finnoe House; dredging and shell collecting colleague of Jeffreys (q.v.) and Johnston (q.v.), also interested in foraminiferans and wrote some reports on them in 1867-68 [Aclis walleri Jeffreys, 1867]. A partial namesake was the friend of Dr. Livingstone, the Rev. Horace Waller, 1833-1896, who also visited Africa in 1861-64.\n\nLacking information about Waller in the Philippine gastropod name Siphonofusus walleri H.S. Ladd, 1976. An US malacologist, Thomas Richard Waller, 1937-, California Academy of Sciences, may however likely be the honoured person.\n\nProf. Dr. Boyd Wallace Walker, (26 May - Manhattan, Kansas) 1917-2001 (19 Sep.), US ichthyologist. A disciple of Hubbs (q.v.), working at UCLA.\n\nDr. George Charles Wallich, (Nov. - Calcutta) 1815-1899 (31 Mar. - Nottingham Place, Marylebone), MD at the Univ. of Edinburgh in 1836, British physician and biological oceanographer, born in Calcutta, where his father, the Danish physician and botanist Dr. Nathaniel Wallich (original name: N. Adam Wolff), (28 Jan. - København) 1786-1854 (28 Apr. - London), acted as superintendent of the Botanical Garden. He was educated in Aberdeen and Edinburgh (MD in 1836), but returned to India and served as a military surgeon until 1847, when he returned with his family to Britain. During this trip and during a visit to England 1850 G.C. Wallich had collected and made sketches of marine animals and was recommended by T.H. Huxley (q.v.) and the geologist Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, (22 Feb.) 1792-1871 (22 Oct.), as naturalist on board the cruise of H.M.S. Bulldog in 1860. Wallich's controversies with some of his compatriotic marine biologists, particularly Wyville Thomson (q.v.), W.B. Carpenter (q.v.) and John Murray (q.v.), regarding recognition of his findings of deep sea life were for a long time well-known. Wallich used the nicknames Fur and Weevil for Carpenter and Wyville Thomson, likely a play on the latin word for villan or thief in the first case and in the second case on the name Wyville [Alectona wallichii (Carter, 1874)].\n\nThe ophiuroid Ophiurolepis wallini Mortensen, 1925 and the hydroid Hydractinia vallini Jäderholm, 1926 were named for Dr. Sten Axel Vallin (or Wallin), (16 Jan. - Karlskrona) 1891-1977? (An \"in memory of Sten Vallin\" was published in 1977). Mortensen writes that this young Swedish zoologist during a whaling trip to the Antarctic Seas in February - April 1924 had the opportunity of making a few dredgings in the Ross Sea and at Stewart Island, securing i.a. some new echinoderms. Vallin later became a (fresh water) fisheries biologist, working on plankton, pollution , etc. The copepod name Ortopsyllys wallini Lang, 1934 is likely named for the same person.\n\nJohn Wallis, 1714-1793, British antiquary and natural historian (mainly malacologist). A namesake is Gustaf Wallis, 1830&endash;1878, professional botany collector (from Hannover) in Ecuador from 1865-68 and later during hist last year in life.\n\nThe Tuamotu hermit crab name Paragiopagurus wallisi (Lemaitre, 1994) is likely not directly honouríng a person's name, but perhaps the Wallis Island, The male ending of the species name makes it unlikely to honour e.g. Dr. Elycia Wallis, 19??-, Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nDr. Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth, (13 Mar. - Breitensten) 1792-1857 (22 Mar. - Nordhausen), German physician and botanist [Chara wallrothii].\n\nLacking information about Walsh in the gastropod name Crepidula walshi (A.N. Hermannsen in Reeve, 1859), but possibly a tribute to Benjamin Dann Walsh, (21 Sep. - Frome, Worcestershire) 1808-1869 (13 Nov. - Rock Island, Illinois), US entomologist, who had been a class-mate of C. Darwin in Cambridge and supported his ideas.\n\nThe sponge name Walteria F.E. von Schulze, 1886, the lucernarian name Lucernaria walteri (Antipa, 1891) and the actinian name Actinostola walteri Kwietniewski C.R., 1898 must be in honour of Dr. Alfred Walter, (26 June - Wolmar, Livland (German name f. Valmiera, Latvia)) 1860-1890 (14 Feb. - Jena, \"nach langer Krankheit\"), who together with W. Kükenthal (q.v.) took part in an expedition to E Spitsbergen (Der Bremer Expedition nach Ost-Spitzbergen Performed with the ship Berentine, which was crushed by ice 11 June 1889 after having run aground among the Kong Ludvigøyane, but the crew was saved four days later by the whale ship Cecilie Maline from Tromsø) in 1889, who collected the following species: Dermatobranchus walteri (Krause, 1892).
