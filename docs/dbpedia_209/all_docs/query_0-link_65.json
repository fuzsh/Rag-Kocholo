Conversely, we hope that the nomenclatural part has the potential to remain a reference source for a longer time, as it will become outdated mainly by newly established names. The present publication is the result of bibliographical work started in 1987 to compile a nomenclator of supraspecific names covering all molluscan taxa, Recent and fossil, other than Cephalopoda. All primary literature has been checked and copied from the original sources (Bouchet & Rocroi 1992). A total of 25,000 genus-group (believed to be 97% complete), 3,700 family-group names, and 1,150 names above the family-group (both believed to be more than 99% complete) have been captured. The result is a loose-leaf paper version and an electronic database. The present paper reports on our results on the supraspecific names that have been proposed for the Gastropoda, which alone account for 70% of the names in our nomenclator. The International Code on Zoological Nomenclature (4th edition) has set the conditions for the approval of a “List of Available Names” (Art. 79). Names entered in the List are deemed to have the date, availability, and other nomenclatural attributes given in the List. In addition, the List would be closed, that is names not entered in the List would be unavailable under the Code. The List would be approved in parts, and gastropod family-group names could constitute one such “Part of the List”. We encourage users of the present publication to notify us with any omission and error they would notice, so that the present nomenclator, after amendments and corrections, could be submitted to ICZN to become an official Part of the List of Available Names in Zoology.\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nMolluscan taxonomists routinely use a number of species- and genus-level nomenclators that either are shared with the rest of zoology (Sherborn 1902, 1922−1932; Neave 1939− 1950, continued by Edwards et al. 1966−1996) or are specific to the Mollusca (Ruhoff 1980). Regrettably, however, there is no universal nomenclator of molluscan family-group names, and as a consequence of the difficulty in establishing their authors and dates, taxonomists do not always cite them in classifications. Even when these are cited, a proper bibliographical reference is often lacking. This, in addition to an incomplete understanding or application of the rules of nomenclature above genus level, contributes to nomenclatural unstability. The purpose of the present paper is to provide accurate bibliographical and nomenclatural data for gastropod family-group names. The paper is organized in two parts: Part 1 is a nomenclator of 2,400 names that have been proposed for Recent and fossil gastropods at the rank of subtribe, tribe, subfamily, family and superfamily; Part 2 places these names in a classification. In the currently very active phase of reevaluation of the phylogeny of the gastropods, the classification is bound to become outdated. It will also elicit controversy, as different taxonomists have different approaches to classification. However, a mere alphabetical listing of gastropod family-group names would be insufficient to bring to the attention of systematists the names they need to consider when they are reassessing the classification of selected parts of the Gastropoda. Although Part 2 attempts to reflect the current state-of-the-art of gastropod classification, it should therefore essentially be viewed as a guide to nomenclaturally available names, as the purpose of this paper is\n\nPR OO F\n\nAbout 2,400 names at the rank of subtribe, tribe, subfamily, family and superfamily have been proposed for Recent and fossil gastropods. All names are listed in a nomenclator giving full bibliographical reference, date of publication, type genus, and their nomenclatural availability and validity under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Another 730 names, established for categories above the family-group, and not regulated by the Code, are listed separately. A working classification attempts to reconcile recent advances in the phylogeny of the Gastropoda, using unranked clades above superfamilies, and the more traditional approach, using hierarchical ranking below superfamily. Altogether, the classification recognizes as valid a total of 611 families, of which 202 are known exclusively as fossils and 409 occur in the Recent with or without a fossil record. The nomenclator and classification will be updated in forthcoming editions to be published electronically.\n\nNOMENCLATOR OF GASTROPOD FAMILIES\n\n5\n\nPart 1. NOMENCLATOR OF GASTROPOD FAMILY-GROUP NAMES\n\nThe International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) defines the family group as including the taxa “at the ranks of superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, and any other rank below superfamily and above genus that may be desired” (Art. 35.1). The Code does not regulate the names of taxa above the family group (sometimes termed the class group), but family-group names are fully subject to the provisions of the Code, which determine among others how the names shall be formed, their availability, and nomenclatural validity. Whereas some rules apply to all names in the species, genus and family groups, other rules apply specifically to family-group names. As these rules are sometimes little known or misunderstood, it may be appropriate to summarize how they affect family-group names.\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nAvailability of Names\n\n(2) “A family-group name when first published must [...] be clearly used as a scientific name to denote a suprageneric taxon and not merely as a plural noun or adjective referring to the members of a genus” [Art. 11.7.1.2]. Two cases need to be discussed here: da Costa’s family names and Troschel’s names established as plurals. Da Costa (1776) appears to have been the first author who used the word “family” in a classification of the molluscs, and these names require specific discussion. Da Costa subdivided the shelled molluscs into three divisions: Univalves, Bivalves and Multivalves. Each division was further subdivided into orders, sections (in one order of bivalves only), and families. Shelled molluscs (sensu da Costa) consisted of 32 families, of which 16 families are “Univalves” (i.e., gastropods, scaphopods and cephalopods). Some of the family names (Patella, Haliotis, Cylindri, Voluta, Cassides, Trochi, Buccina and Murex) are Latin names, apparently formed on a stem-genus, and it is necessary to discuss their availability under the Code. First, it should be noted that da Costa uses certain generic names with a meaning radically different from that of his contemporaries. For instance, da Costa uses “Voluta or Volute” for species of Conus, but the only species of Volutidae illustrated by him is identified as the “Melon Tun” of the family Globosa. Da Costa’s Strombus is a fasciolariid, whereas he illustrates a species of Strombus as “A Murex of the Alata genus”. Second, da Costa’s family names are most frequently formed by the first word of polynominal generic names. For instance, the family Cylindri contains two genera, Cylindri emarginati and Cylindri marginati. The family Buccina contains six genera: Buccina Canaliculata, Buccina Recurvirostra, Buccina Rostrata, Buccina Umbilicata, Buccina Columella dentata vel plicata, and Strombus [a fasciolariid, see above]. Other names, such as Turbinata involuta, Auris Cochlea, Globosa, Cochleae, and even Voluta, are plurals not based on a genus. In conclusion, even in the context of his time, da Costa’s usage of family and genus names is inconsistent with the principles of Articles 4.1 and 11.7.1.2 of the Code. It seems best to interpret Da Costa’s family names as plural\n\nPR OO F\n\nA Summary of the Rules of Nomenclature Applying to Family-Group Names\n\nArticles 10−20 determine the conditions of availability of scientific names. Of specific relevance to this nomenclator of family-group names are Arts. 11.7 and 13.2, which state that:\n\n(1) “A family-group name when first published [...] must be a noun in the nominative plural formed from the stem of an available generic name [...]; the generic name must be a name then used as valid in the new family-group taxon” [Art. 11.7.1.1]. Examples: Because Priobalea is not an available generic name, the name PRIOBALEINAE A. J. Wagner, 1922, is not an available name. The name GYMNOSOMATA Blainville, 1824, established as a family, is not available as a family-group name because it is not formed from a genus name. (This does not affect its availability by those who want to use it above superfamily, as such names are not regulated by the Code). Da Motta (1995) established the name TEXTILIINAE, based on “Cylindrus [sic! = Cylinder] Montfort, 1810 as the type genus” and treated Textilia Swainson, 1840, as a synonym and thus not as a valid name. Under Art. 11.7.1.1 of the Code, TEXTILIINAE is not an available name.\n\nBOUCHET & ROCROI of families” [translated from German by D. Kadolsky]. Such names could perhaps be considered to be “means of temporary reference” in the sense of Art. 1.3.5 (Kadolsky, pers. comm.), which would exclude them from the provisions of the Code. However, the names Bithyniidae (Opinions 475 and 1664) and Hydrobiidae (Opinion 2034) have been placed on the Official List with Troschel, 1857 as author. We see two alternatives on how to treat Troschel’s (1857) names: (a) either be inconsistent and treat Bithyniae and Hydrobiae as available and Lithoglyphi, Ancyloti, Thiarae and Pachychili as unavailable; (b) or be consistent and treat them all as available (contrary to Art. 11.7.1.2) or unavailable (contrary to Opinions 1664 and 2034). Because there are no negative nomenclatural consequences (no displacement of accepted valid names), and because nomenclature becomes impenetrable when its application requires reference to too many specific decisions, we have decided to be consistent and treat all of Troschel’s 1857 as unavailable. This has also the positive consequence of eliminating Ancyloti which, if considered an available name, would have to be treated as an incorrect original spelling of “Anculosinae”, based on Anculosa Say, 1821; “Anculosinae Troschel, 1857” would then be a senior synonym of Pleuroceridae P. Fischer, 1865 (1863).\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nnouns that do not qualify under Art. 11.7.1.2. Troschel (1857 [in 1856−1891]) used the names Bithyniae, Lithoglyphi, Hydrobiae, Ancyloti, Thiarae and Pachychili in headings that have usually been considered to denote family-group rank. However, Troschel’s (1857: 95−129) treatment of these names contrasts with the rest of his work (Troschel 1856−1863 [in 1856−1891]), in which he stated the ranks of the categories he used and formed the names with the endings -idea, -ina, or -acea. Troschel’s intentions with regard to the names formed as plurals are explained on pp. 94−95: “J. E. Gray, in the system summarized above [Gray, 1853], characterized each family, and grouped them according to the constitution of the operculum. I would have liked to follow his subdivision in our description of the dentition, if the resulting differentiations would have agreed with Gray’s families. In the Cyclostomacea in the older sense the constitution of the operculum provided an excellent guide to the differentiation of families, and the dentition confirmed this. Here clarification is not easy. I studied and drew a large number of opercula, usually of just the same species of which I studied the dentition. I did not gain a clear-cut correspondence from this, and therefore I cannot decide to assume families on the basis of opercular differences. Likewise I would not like to base families based on certain peculiarities of the dentition, because I cannot foresee the consequences despite my rather rich material, and because genera which hitherto were [considered to be] distant, would become closely related, and vice versa. Therefore, no other way is left for me but to discuss the genera in small groups, without wishing to assign to them the value\n\nPR OO F\n\n6\n\nTABLE 1.

Example: CYPRAEACITINAE Schilder, 1930, is not an available name because its type genus Cypraeacites Schlotheim, 1820, is not available under Art. 20.\n\n(4) “If a family-group name was published before 1900, [...] but not in latinized form, it is available with its original author and date only if it has been latinized by later authors and has been generally accepted as valid by authors interested in the group concerned and as dating from that first publication in vernacular form” [Art. 11.7.2]. Examples. “Styliolacées” (French vernacular) of Fol, 1875 [published before 1900 but never latinized], is not an available name.\n\nNOMENCLATOR OF GASTROPOD FAMILIES\n\nPR OO F\n\n2000, and also was not rejected by an author who, after 1960 and before 2000, expressly applied Article 13 of the current editions of the Code” [Art. 13.2.1]. To summarize: - before 1931: description or definition not necessary; - after 1930 and before 1961: description or definition necessary, with exceptions ruled by Art. 13.2.1; - after 1960: description or definition necessary, without exception. Examples: Knight (1956) introduced numerous family group names without a description and justified his action by the following sentence: “Since the full systematic treatment and full diagnoses of these taxa will appear within the year and since diagnoses are not requisite for validity of familial names, though recommended, they are omitted here”. Thus, it was not by oversight or deliberate ignorance of the rules of nomenclature that Knight decided not to give any description. The name EUPHEMITINAE Knight, 1956, established without a description or definition, is now in current use and attributed to Knight, 1956, and not to Knight, Batten & Yochelson, 1960, who first gave a diagnosis. EUPHEMITINAE Knight, 1956, is available under Art. 13.2.1. Because the name BERTHELINIINAE was established by Beets, 1949, without a description or definition, it was regarded as unavailable from this original publication by Le Renard et al. (1996) under Art. 13a of the 3rd edition of the Code then in force. BERTHELINIINAE Beets, 1949, is not an available name, but BERTHELINIINAE Keen & Smith, 1961, is available because these authors provided a diagnosis. The name MICRODISCULIDAE was established by Iredale & McMichael, 1962, without a description or definition, and a description or definition has not been published subsequently by any author. MICRODISCULIDAE is not an available name. Because the name DISTORSIONINAE was established by Kuroda, Habe & Oyama, 1971, without a description or definition, it is unavailable from that publication. DISTORSI ONINAE is available from Beu, 1981, who published a diagnosis.\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nThe author of SCURRIINI is Lindberg, 1988, and not Thiem, 1917, who established “Scurriiden” a German vernacular name published after 1900, and thus not an available name. The author of the name FACELININAE is not Vayssière, 1888, because when Bergh established it in the Latin form, he did not refer to the French vernacular “Facelinidés” of Vayssière, and the name is now universally attributed to Bergh, 1889. The name TITISCANIIDAE is universally attributed to Bergh, 1890, who established it as the German vernacular “Die Titiscanien, eine Familie der rhipidoglossen Gasteropoden”, although it was first latinized by Thiele, 1891. The major difficulty in the application of this paragraph concerns names introduced mostly by French authors between 1800 and 1830. For example, Lamarck, Férussac, and Latreille, created numerous names in vernacular form that were often latinized by their translators and/or followers, notably Menke, Children, and Bowdich. Although many of these names are now accepted as valid in current classifications, there is no “generally accepted” usage regarding their authorship. One of the reasons contributing to this lack of established consensus is that many treatises and textbooks of malacology deliberately omit authorship for family-group names. For that reason, different authors have interpreted Article 11.7.2 of the Code differently, a situation that perpetuated the lack of consensus.\n\n7\n\n(5) Description/Diagnosis. Since the 1960 edition of the Code, Art. 13.1 requires that: “To be available, every new name published after 1930 [...] must 13.1.1. be accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon, or 13.1.2. be accompanied by a bibliographic reference to such a published statement [...]”. Applicability of this rule to family-group names established after 1960 is unambiguous. Conversely, its application to names published after 1930 and before 1961 was, under the 1st, 2nd and 3rd editions of the Code, controversial (Bock, 1994). To leave some flexibility on this issue, the 4th edition of the Code now allows that: “A family-group name first published after 1930 and before 1961 which does not satisfy the provisions of Article 13.1 is available from its original publication only if it was used as valid before\n\n(6) Conditional proposal. “A new name or nomenclatural act proposed conditionally and published after 1960 is not thereby made available” [Art. 15.1].\n\nBOUCHET & ROCROI Example: When establishing the new genus Lapinura, Er. & Ev. Marcus (1970) wrote: “[Metaruncina setoensis Baba] is certainly different from [Ildica nana Bergh], so that the systematic position of the latter according to its external or internal shell can only be settled by new material of Ildica nana. If this species had an inner shell, Lapinura would be the only runcinacean with an outer shell, and the family would have to be called LAPINURIDAE”. Under Art. 15.1, LAPINURIDAE Er. & Ev. Marcus, 1970, is not available name.\n\nFormation of Names\n\nArticle 29 states that: “A family-group name is formed by adding to the stem of the name of the type genus [Art. 29.3], or to the entire name of the type genus [Art. 55.3], a suffix as specified in Article 29.2” [Art. 29.1]. The stem of the names of type genera is determined by Art. 29.3 in accordance with the rules of Latin grammar. The first, second and third editions of the Code ruled that a familygroup name with a wrongly formed stem was an incorrect original spelling that must be corrected. However, the 4th edition of the Code now rules that: “If a spelling of a family-group name was not formed in accordance with Article 9.3 but is in prevailing usage, that spelling is to be maintained, whether or not it is the original spelling and whether or not its derivation from the name of the type genus is in accordance with the grammatical procedures in Articles 29.3.1 and 29.3.2” [Art. 29.5].\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nArticles 25−34 determine the formation and treatment of names. Of specific relevance to family-group names are Articles 29 [Formation of family-group names] and 32 [Original spellings]. Article 32.5.3 states that: “A family-group name is an incorrect original spelling and must be corrected if it 32.5.3.1. has an incorrectly formed suffix [Art. 29.2], or 32.5.3.2. is formed from an unjustified emendation of a generic name (unless the unjustified emendation has become a replacement name), or 32.5.3.3. is formed from an incorrect subsequent spelling of a generic name [Art. 35.4.1]; or 32.5.3.4. is formed from one of two or more original spellings of a genus-group name not selected by the First Reviser [Art. 24.2.3]”. “An incorrect original spelling has no separate availability in the original form and cannot, in that form, enter into homonymy or be used as a replacement name” [Art. 32.4]. Examples: The tribe rank name GLABROCINGULIDES Gordon & Yochelson, 1987, has an incorrectly formed suffix and must be corrected to GLABROCINGULINI. HOMALAXINAE Cossmann, 1916, is formed from Homalaxis P. Fischer, 1885, an unjustified emendation of Omalaxis Deshayes, 1832. HOMALAXINAE is an incorrect original spelling that must be corrected to OMALAXINAE. Ferrussacia [note double r] is an incorrect subsequent spelling of Ferussacia Risso, 1826, [single r] (stem Ferussaci-) and FERRUSSACIDAE Bourguignat, 1883, is an incorrect original spelling that must be corrected to FERUSSACIIDAE.\n\nLAIOCOCHLIINAE Golikov & Starobogatov, 1987, is formed from Laiocochlis Dunker & Metzger, 1874, one of several original spellings. Opinion 1700 selected Laeocochlis as the correct original spelling and L A I O C O C H L I I N A E must be corrected to LAEOCOCHLIDINAE.\n\nPR OO F\n\n8\n\nThe purpose of Art. 29.5 is to avoid destabilizing family-group names in current use by requiring mandatory changes for purely grammatical reasons. In the discussion preceding the publication of the 4th edition of the Code, the issue of adherence to the rules of the Latin grammar has seen the scientific community split. Some scientists see this adherence as part of the scholarship of their profession, others see it as an outdated remnant of the epoch when zoologists had training in Latin and Greek. Although we have ourselves had that training, we do not want to impose our vision to the community of gastropod systematists, and we have followed the spirit of Art. 29. Ultimately, the question is whether we have stability in the spelling of gastropod family-group names, and whether following the “grammatical niceties” (Wheeler, 1990) in Article 29.3 would do more harm than good. It seems that the spelling of gastropod family-group names is an issue that has attracted little attention so far and, after conferring with a number of colleagues, we have concluded that for a vast majority of the names there is no such thing as a “prevailing usage” that should eventually\n\nNOMENCLATOR OF GASTROPOD FAMILIES\n\nPR OO F\n\nConversely, the rules of Latin and Greek grammar appear to have consistently been ignored in the formation of family-group names deriving from genera with the suffix -opsis and -ptyx (or -ptyxis). Although the rules would recommend family name endings in -OPSEIDAE and -PTYCHIDAE, respectively, the prevailing usage are endings in -OPSIDAE and -PTYXIDAE, and we have not attempted to correct this. A special difficulty was encountered with names ending in -on, or -ion, and that cannot always easily be attributed to a recognizable Greek or Latin root. The original spellings of the family-group names formed on, e.g., Bothriembryon, Cerion, Coelocion, Semperdon, and Sinumelon were B OTHRIEMBRYONTIDAE , CERIONIDAE, COELOCIONTIDAE, SEMPERDONINAE, and SINUMELONINAE, respectively. There are good, but disputable, grammatical reasons to argue that the correctly formed spellings under Art. 29.3.1 would be BOTHRIEMBRYIDAE, CERIIDAE (and this spelling was indeed used by H. B. Baker, 1957, and H. Nordsieck, 1986b), COELOCIIDAE (and this spelling was used by Nordsieck, 1986), SEMPERDONTINAE, and SINUMELINAE, but this would sometimes run against Art. 29.5, which rules to maintain current spellings in prevailing usage. CERIONIDAE is in prevailing usage with that spelling, but the other names have had only very limited usage, and we have chosen to maintain the original spellings.\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nbe maintained against the rules of Latin grammar. Many colleagues in fact suggested that the present nomenclator would probably become the standard reference for gastropod family-group names and that one of its consequences would be precisely to settle such nomenclatural issues. In this nomenclator, we have been guided principally by adherence to the rules of Latin grammar [Art. 29.3], except where such adherence would contravene with the spirit of Art. 29.5. We have also been guided by consistency. We believe that consistently deriving familygroup names formed on genera with similar endings offers advantages in memorizing the names. For instance, it is easier to memorize that the family-group names formed on Choanopoma and Rhytidopoma are CHOANOPOMATINI and R HYTIDOPOMATINAE , rather than CHOANOPOMATINI (correctly formed original spelling) and RHYTIDOPOMINAE (incorrectly formed original spelling). Similarly, A LCITHOINAE , NECTOPHYLLIRHOIDAE and PHYLLIROIDAE are grammatically correctly formed on Alcithoe, Nectophyllirhoe and Phylliroe. As a consequence, we have corrected LYSINOEINAE and OXYNOEIDAE, formed on Lysinoe and Oxynoe, to LYSINOINAE and OXYNOIDAE. We have tabulated the formation of family-group names derived from the most commonly encountered endings of a generic name (Table 2).\n\n9\n\nTABLE 2.

Taxonomical validity is not determined by the Code and is not considered in this nomenclator. Nomenclatural validity is a different issue that is determined objectively by the application of the Code. Validity is determined by Art. 23 [Principle of Priority] and 24 [Principle of the First Reviser], as well as parts of Arts. 35−41 [Family-Group Taxa and Names]. Of particular relevance to this nomenclator are the following Articles. (1) “The name of a family-group taxon is invalid if the name of its type genus is a junior homonym or has been suppressed by the Commission” [Art. 39]. Examples: The name POLYTROPIDAE Koken, 1925, is invalid because its type genus Polytropis de Koninck, 1881, is a junior homonym of Polytropis Sandberger, 1875. The name XEROPHILIDAE Mörch, 1864, is invalid because its type genus Xerophila Held, 1838, has been placed by Opinion 431 on the Official Index of Rejected and Invalid Generic Names in Zoology.\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nExamples: The stem of the genus Petropoma Gabb, 1877, is Petropomat- [Code, 3rd edition, Appendix D, Table 2], and PETROPOMINAE Cox, 1960, was, under the first, second and third editions of the Code, an incorrect original spelling that was to be corrected to PETROPOMATINAE . It was so corrected by Hickman & McLean, 1990, and this is here considered the correct spelling. SEMISINUSINAE P. Fischer & Crosse, 1891, is formed on Semisinus P. Fischer, 1885, an unjustified emendation [Art. 32.5.3] of Hemisinus Swainson, 1840. SEMISINUSINAE is an incorrect original spelling that was corrected to HEMISINUINAE by Thiele, 1928. However, the stem of Hemisinus is Hemisin-, not Hemisinu-, and under Art. 29.3 the familygroup name formed from Hemisinus is HEMISININAE. There are very few works that deal with the taxonomy of this group of gastropods, and there is no “prevailing usage” that would justify maintaining the spellings HEMISINUSINAE or HEMISINUINAE; we have thus considered HEMISININAE to be the correct spelling. The author of HEMISININAE is P. Fischer & Crosse, 1891. The stem of the genus Morum Röding, 1798, is Mor- and the derived family-group name should be MORINAE. However, as there was already a family MORIDAE Goode & Bean, 1896, based on the fish genus Mora Risso, 1826, Hughes & Emerson (1987) established MORUMINAE from Morum. This was the right approach under Art. 29.6, and MORUMINAE is a correct spelling under Art. 29.1. However, under Art. 55.3.1, changing the stem of an existing family-group name to avoid homonymy can be done only by the Commission. Schileyko (1998 [in 1998− 2003]) emended BULIMINIDAE Kobelt, 1880 (based on Buliminus Beck, 1837), to B ULIMINUIDAE to avoid homonymy with BULIMINIDAE Jones, 1875 (based on Bulimina d’Orbigny, 1826). This was not permissible under the Code, and the case had to be brought to the Commission for a ruling. Hausdorf (2001) petitioned the Commission to that effect, and Opinion 2018 ruled BULIMINUSIDAE to be the correct spelling.\n\nPR OO F\n\n10\n\nValidity The taxonomical validity of a nominal taxon is determined subjectively by the opinion of individual taxonomists.

Example: Hinoide & Habe (1978) placed Pedumicra Iredale & Laseron, 1957, in synonymy of Parastrophia de Folin, 1869, and replaced PEDUMICRINAE Iredale & Laseron, 1957, with the new name PARASTROPHIINAE. This replacement is unjustified under the Code and the nomenclaturally valid name of the familygroup taxon containing Pedumicra and Parastrophia is PEDUMICRINAE.\n\n(3) “If, however, a family-group name was replaced before 1961 because of the synonymy of the type genus, the replacement name is to be maintained if it is in prevailing usage. A name maintained by virtue of this Article retains its own author but takes the precedence of the replaced name of which it is deemed to be the senior synonym” [Art. 40.2].\n\nNOMENCLATOR OF GASTROPOD FAMILIES\n\nPR OO F\n\n1850, because of the synonymy of Conovulus Bowdich, 1822, nor did he mentioned the names CONOVULIDAE or Conovulus.

We have also treated this as a situation covered by Art. 40.2, and we have maintained MELAMPINAE Stimpson, 1851 (1850), as the valid name. Names that are invalid under Art. 39, or because they have been placed on the Official Index, are permanently invalid, and cannot be used as valid in any classification. Taxonomical synonyms are also invalid, but only within the frame of a classification, and these may be resurrected by another author who has a different opinion about classification.

PYRENIDAE is not a replacement name in the sense of Art. 40.2, and it does not take the precedence of COLUMBELLIDAE. Dall (1866) established POMPHOLIGINAE based on Pompholyx Lea, 1856. However, the type genus is a junior homonym of Pompholyx Gosse, 1851 [Rotifera]. Lindholm (1927b) replaced Pompholyx and POMPHOLIGINAE with the names Pompholycodea and POMPHOLYCODEINAE respectively. The replacement was not a consequence of synonymy of the type genus and Art. 40.2 does not apply. Examples where Art. 40.2 applies: Suter (1913) placed Dolium Lamarck, 1801, in synonymy of Tonna Brünnich, 1772, and replaced DOLIIDAE Latreille, 1825, with the new name TONNIDAE. TONNIDAE is in prevailing usage and is to be maintained, with the precedence of DOLIIDAE. It should be cited TONNIDAE Suter, 1913 (1825). Beyond such cases that fit literally to the wording of the Code, there is a broader array of cases in which the author establishing the younger family-group name did not explicitly state that he did so “because of the synonymy of the type genus”. For instance, when he established the name DISCINAE, Thiele (1931 [in 1929−1935]) did not state that he was replacing PATULINAE Tryon, 1866, because of the synonymy of Patula Held, 1837, nor did he even mention the name PATULINAE, but he cited Patula as a synonym of Discus Fitzinger, 1833. We have treated this as a situation covered by Art. 40.2. DISCIDAE is in prevailing usage and is to be maintained, with the precedence of PATULINAE. It should be cited DISCIDAE Thiele, 1931 (1866). Departing still a little further from the letter of Art. 40.2, there are cases in which the author establishing the younger family-group name not only did not explicitly stated that he was doing so “because of the synonymy of the type genus” but not even mentioned the synonymy of the genera involved. For instance, when he established MELAMPIDAE, Stimpson (1851) did not state he was replacing CONOVULIDAE W. Clark,\n\n11\n\nPrinciple of Coordination Article 36 states that: “A name established for a taxon at any rank in the family group is deemed to be simultaneously established with the same author and date for taxa based upon the same name-bearing type (type genus) at other ranks in the family group, with appropriate mandatory change of suffix”. Example: Ellis (1926) established the name MILACIDAE at family rank. He is deemed to have established that name at any other rank in the family group. The author and date of MILACINAE is Ellis, 1926, despite that it was declared a new subfamily by Germain (1931).\n\nBOUCHET & ROCROI\n\nStatus of Names in the Official List of FamilyGroup Names in Zoology\n\nNomenclator\n\nEpidemiology of Gastropod Family-Group Names\n\nCO RR EC TE D\n\nA number of family-group names have been placed on the Official List by the Commission of Nomenclature. The Code rules that: “The status of a name entered in an Official List is subject to the ruling(s) in any relevant Opinion(s) […]; all other aspects of its status derive from the normal application of the Code” (Art. 80.6.2) and also that: “A name may be placed in an Official List without any additional qualification” (Art. 80.6.3). We have found a number of instances in which the authorship and/or date of publication of a name entered on the Official List are erroneous, that is that name has been established earlier by the same or another author. For convenience, the corrections were published in the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2001), but they did not require any action from the Commission. Since then, we have discovered another such erroneous entry: Opinion 1470 placed the name EUOMPHALIDAE on the Official List and attributed it to de Koninck, 1881, when it was in fact first established by White, 1877.\n\nnumber of nomenclatural cases that cannot be solved without a decision of the Commission. The problems are simply discussed under the appropriate headings in the Nomenclator or in the Appendices. It was felt inappropriate to prepare applications for publication in the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature before publication of the present work: first, because it is precisely the purpose of the present work to highlight the problems, elicit discussion and seek a consensus among malacologists; second, because it is not possible to monopolize several issues of the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature just to deal with the many cases involved. A solution to all these problems will probably take several years. Ultimately, the present Nomenclator could, after amendments, become a Part of the List of Available Names in Zoology, as regulated by Article 79 of the Code.\n\nPR OO F\n\n12\n\nCases to be Submitted to the Commission\n\nInevitably, a review of family-group names such as the present one has made apparent a\n\nA total of 2,396 names at the rank of subtribe, tribe, subfamily, family, and superfamily have been proposed for Recent and fossil gastropods, or have, at one time or another, been used at these ranks.

The intervening years saw the publication of Paul Fischer’s Manuel de conchyliologie et de paléontologie conchyliologique (1880−1887); Cossmann’s Essais de paléoconchologie comparée (1895− 1924); and Pilsbry’s prolific writing, including the second series of the Manual of conchology (1892−1926). The second peak is the result of many more authors and publications, but particularly active in these years were H. B. Baker, Iredale, Odhner, Pilsbry, Thiele, and Wenz, with landmark works by Thiele, the Mollusca part of Kükenthal & Krumbach’s Handbuch der Zoologie (1925−1926), leading to the Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (1929−1931); and by Wenz, the land snail parts of Fossilium Catalogus (1923−1930) and the “Prosobranchia” part of Schindewolf’s Handbuch der Paläozoologie (1938−1944).

Of these, 113 are permanently invalid, mainly because the type genus is a junior homonym; when these are eliminated, there are 1,947 names that are potentially valid (Fig. 1). An analysis of the year of publication of the 2,060 available names shows (Fig. 2) that, on average, 12.3 names have been established yearly since 1850. Three periods are above average: a brief, low peak in the 1850’s; a second, much higher, sustained peak in the 1920’s−1930’s, when a record total of 377 names where established in just 20 years; and a third one, broader and regularly rising since the 1950’s, marks modern times. The first peak corresponds to Gray’s prolific writing, notably his Figures of molluscous animals (1850b), Catalogue of Phaneropneumona (in L.

To be singled out are the almost simultaneous works by Knight, Batten and Cox in preparation for the “archeogastropod” part of the Treatise on invertebrate paleontology (1960), Pchelintsev & Korobkov’s Osnovy paleontologii (1960), and Zilch’s pulmonate part of the Handbuch der Paläozoologie (1959−1960). In the last two decades, the two main sources of new names have been Russian zoologists (Golikov, Schileyko, Starobogatov) and the “Mitteleuropa” school of paleontologists (Bandel, Fryda, Gründel), which account respectively for 101 and 88 of the 451 new names published since 1980. The 2,060 available names involve a total of 491 authors or co-authors, and there are 2,373 author-name pairs (as a name can have more than one author). 51% of authors appear only once, 90% of the authors are responsible for 41% of the pairs, and 10% of the authors are responsible for 59% of the names (Fig. 3; Table 3).\n\nPR OO F\n\n14\n\nFIG. 3.

However, nearly one-fourth (24.6%) of all valid families occuring in the Recent are slugs, that do not leave a fossil record, and a still higher percentage of the modern diversity of Recent gastropods is not traceable in the fossil record when one considers the many families with featureless shells that can only be recognized anatomically (e.g., the hydrobioid families, numerous helicoid families, etc.). In the Pa-\n\nleozoic, there is a steady increase in the number of gastropod families from Cambrian to Carboniferous, then a crash in the Permian (Fig. 4). In the Mesozoic, there are more names with a Jurassic type species than for any other pre-Tertiary period. Altogether, the classification recognizes as valid a total of 611 families, that is 31% of all 1,947 potentially valid family-group names, are currently treated as taxonomically valid.

Precise dates of publication, to the month and day, have been searched in available published sources (often bio-bibliographies of authors) or obtained from the covers of journals. In the case of Soviet era materials, we have taken the “podpisano” as the earliest possible date of publication, and we have indicated this as “after [“podpisano”] date”. (The “podpisano” is the approval for printing by political authorities; it appears on the last printed page of a book, together with other information such as number of print copies). Russian colleagues (Y. Kantor, A. Sysoev, pers. comm.) indicate that publications were usually printed within weeks after the “podpisano” date.

There are few standard works that have covered all gastropod clades, Recent and fossil. With 611 families, the present classification has the highest number ever considered valid (Table 4): this is nearly 4 times as many as in Fischer’s Manuel de conchyliologie, 120 years ago. This is also still significantly more than in The fossil record; and the difference probably reflects a better coverage of slugs in the present classification, as well as progress in knowledge in the intervening years. Of the 611 valid families, 202 are known exclusively as fossil and 409 occur in the Recent with or without a fossil record. If we suppose that there are 80,000 valid Recent named gastropod species, this is on average 196 species per family (Table 5).

This is the concept of nomen translatum (abbreviated n.t.) that was consistently used in the Treatise on invertebrate paleontology. Under Art. 36, a change of rank in the family group does not affect the author and date of the name with modified suffix. The literature containing changes of rank is much larger than the primary literature containing new family-group names, and we have probably missed a good number of changes. We would like to stress, however, that this does not affect the nomenclature of taxa, but merely their subsequent taxonomical use. The rank of a family-group name is that attributed to it by an author in a classification or in a heading. However, when the author has used ranks in a meaning different from current usage, we have considered the rank that was intended rather than the rank nominally attributed by the author. A few specific cases need to be singled out: (a) Jousseaume (1894) has used “tribu” [= tribe] immediately below family rank and above genus, with the suffix -inae, and explained rather confusingly (1894: 268): “I here consider as tribes the divisions that malacologists have elevated to family rank; all names ending in -inae are thus for me only tribes”. We have considered such names as used at subfamily rank. Casey (1904) divided the family Pleurotomidae in eight tribes, with the suffix -ini, without any subfamily. We have considered Casey’s “tribes” to be subfamilies. Conversely, Odhner (1939) used the word “tribe” to denote categories above the family, his tribes containing several families. We have considered such names as the names of suborders. (b) Cossmann (1905, 1906) used the word “cénacle” in reaction to the usage of “superfamille”, which he disliked on vocabulary grounds (he ridiculed the word “superfamille” which he compared to “superprésident”!). We have naturally re-\n\ngarded Cossmann’s cénacles as equivalent to superfamilies. (c) Thiele (1925−1926) used the word “Sippe” and (1929−1935) the word “Stirps” for taxa at a rank above family and below order. Many of these, but not all, are formed on a genus name and have a suffix in -acea. Thiele’s Sippe and Stirps have generally (for example, Bieler & Mikkelsen, 1992) been regarded as equivalent to superfamilies and we have followed this interpretation here.\n\nPR OO F\n\n(4) The “Remarks” contains such information as: original spelling [if an incorrect original spelling under Art. 32] and history of the name [if originally published as a vernacular name]; nomenclatural availability and validity; references to changes of rank.\n\n17\n\nACANTHARIONINI Schileyko, 2002 [September] Reference: Treatise on Recent terrestrial pulmonate molluscs, Part 9: 1274 Type genus: Acantharion Binder & Tillier, 1985 ACANTHINULINAE Steenberg, 1917 [5 October] Reference: Videnskabelige Meddelelser fra Dansk Naturhistorisk Forening i Kjobenhavn, 69: 14 Type genus: Acanthinula Beck, 1847 Remarks: Placed on the Official List by Direction 27 (1955: 483), but credited in error to Pilsbry (1926 [in 1922−1926]: 186). -idae, Wenz (1938 [in 1938−1944]: 53−54).

However, Pilsbry (1908b: 83), designated Ampulla priamus [now in Volutidae] as type species of Ampulla; this fixation of type species was followed by Rehder (1970: 42) when he cited Ampullinae as a synonym of Haliinae [Volutidae]. Under Art. 41, the case should be referred to the Commission, but this would have strictly academic interest: Ampullidae has not “won general acceptance” over Achatinidae in the sense of Art. 40.2, and Haliinae is both in current use and a senior objective synonym.\n\nRemarks: Not available under Art. 16.1: name not explicitly indicated as intentionally new.\n\nPR OO F\n\nfamily-group name, but Deshayes & MilneEdwards (1838: 538), merely stated the necessity to place Ampullacera in a family of its own, without naming it.\n\nAMPULLININAE Cossmann, 1919 [15 March] Reference: [in Cossmann & Peyrot] Actes de la Société Linnéenne de Bordeaux, 70(3): 181 Type genus: †Ampullina Bowdich, 1822 Remarks: -idae, Korobkov (1955: 229); -oidea, Lozouet et al.
