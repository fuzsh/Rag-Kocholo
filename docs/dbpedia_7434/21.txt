Isabel Zarza, Chief Operating Officer Central & North Europe, Russia & Africa, is thrilled about the opening. “We offer our customers a great brand experience across more than 600 m2 with professional advice for all our core categories – from fashion and accessories, to perfumes, cosmetics and skin care products for her and him; to wines and spirits, on to food and confectionery as well as tobacco, jewelry, watches, sunglasses and travel bags. ANECDOTE is not just for travelers – we also want to attract local customers from the Greater Zurich Area, which is one of Europe’s economically strongest areas with around 3.8 million inhabitants.”

Zurich Airport takes a big step forward in transforming itself into a destination in itself by embracing new concepts ranging from a rooftop restaurant to a highly competent health center. ANECDOTE will make Dufry’s offer available to a broader audience – an idea that was born in 2016 and finally comes to life.”
