CLEVELAND, Ohio -- University Circle in 2025 will implement a special improvement district aimed at stabilizing funding for the University Circle Police Department and other public services.

Approved by City Council last week, creation of the district is expected to raise $3.9 million in the first year, increasing to $4.4 million by 2029 through special assessments on private property owners in the designated area, University Circle Inc. estimates.
