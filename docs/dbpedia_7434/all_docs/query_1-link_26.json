        "meta_description": "The health of Missouri's livestock is enviable among states. Our stringent animal health regulations and rigorous disease testing help keep Missouri free from costly and threatening livestock diseases. The Animal Health Division, under the direction of the state veterinarian, is responsible for controlling, eradicating and testing for livestock disease in Missouri. This is accomplished through testing, vaccinations and regulatory programs involving cattle, swine, horses, poultry, exotic animals, sheep, goats and small animals as provided under the Diseased Animal Law.",

        "text": "In Missouri, it is a felony to brand someone elseâs animals or to efface, deface or obliterate any livestock brand. It is also illegal to use any brand for branding horses, cattle, sheep, mules or asses unless the brand has been recorded with the Department of Agriculture. For identification within the herd, livestock can be branded with unregistered Arabic numbers if they are used in conjunction with recorded brands. Brands used for identification within the herd are not considered proof of ownership.\n\nOnce brands are recorded with the Department of Agriculture, they become the personal property of the owner. Registered brands may be transferred from one individual to another. When transferring a brand, the back of the certificate must be signed by both parties and notarized, then sent to the Department along with the required transfer fee and additional documentation, when required. A notarized document that proves a brand was sold, assigned or transferred will be accepted in lieu of the brand certificate.\n\nIn 1992, changes to the brand law made cryo-branding or freeze-branding legal and gives it the same status as hot-iron branding. Freeze branding shows up well on dark-colored livestock.\n\nLegislation passed in 1971 requires the Missouri Department of Agriculture to be responsible for the registering of livestock brands. Brands must be recorded as required by Missouriâs Marks and Brands of Animal Law to prove ownership, and to be considered legal evidence in a court of law.\n\nUnder the law, individuals can register new brands, or they can apply to use brands that have been released. The state will reject a brand if that particular design is already registered. The brand can be registered for use on the shoulder, rib or hip on either side of the animal. Placement (left or right side) is determined by standing behind the animal. Brands must be three (3) inches or larger in diameter and more than a single character. Brands that have sharp points on the lettering or sharp angles tend to create burn-out and may appear blotchy and hard to read. Freeze branding works best and is more visible on darker animals because the hair grows back in a light shade.\n\nA livestock brand is not intended to be a logo and does not need to be registered to be used as such. A livestock brand however must be registered with the Missouri Department of Agriculture Division of Animal Health before branding any animal.\n\nThe online application for Brand Registration can be found here: Application for Brand Registration."
