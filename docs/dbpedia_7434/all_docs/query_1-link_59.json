        "text": "Welcome to the 2nd Congressional District of Nebraska! Located in the eastern portion of the Great State of Nebraska, the district encompasses the core of the Omaha metropolitan area which includes all of Douglas County and the suburban areas of western Sarpy County. Nebraska’s largest and our nation’s 42nd largest city – Omaha can be found here. A list of cities and communities located in our District is below.\n\nWe are fortunate to be home to four fabulous Fortune 500 companies: Mutual of Omaha, Union Pacific, Kiewit, and Berkshire Hathaway – the hideout of the most successful investor of the 20th century Warren Buffett – all call the 2nd District home.\n\nAnother vital enterprise within our district borders is the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). With its eye on improving the future of health care in Nebraska, the UNMC is on the cutting edge in the fight against diseases like Ebola and to serving our state and its communities through award-winning outreach.\n\nThe 2nd District is the birthplace of our nation’s 38th President Gerald Ford, civil rights leader Malcolm X, and Astronaut Clayton Anderson.\n\nFor a relatively small (geographically speaking) area, we have a number of Hollywood notables that hail from #NE02, among them Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Alexander Payne, Jorge Garcia, Adam DeVine, Gabrielle Union, and Nicholas D'Agosto.\n\nThe district is also a sports hotbed – hosting the annual NCAA Men’s College World Series, championship ice skating, and a national swim trial competition – the Olympic Swim Trials.\n\nWe can grow grapes as well as we grow corn with an annual wine festival to prove it.\n\nFrom galleries to coffee shop displays across the 2nd District – we’re proud of our talented and vibrant arts scene that includes an amazing collection of fine art from Rembrandt’s to modern masters at the Joslyn Art Museum, a world-famous indie rock record label – Saddle Creek Records, and multiple museums, shows, and warehouses dedicated to supporting both old and new local art.\n\nThe welcoming atmosphere and gracious mid-western hospitality of our District that sits at an amazing intersection of urbanity and nature makes it one of the most diverse, dynamic, and distinguished districts in the country!\n\nCommunities within Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District:"
