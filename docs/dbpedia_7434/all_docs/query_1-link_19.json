        "text": "American political organization\n\nNo Labels is an American political organization whose stated mission is to support centrism and bipartisanship through what it calls the \"commonsense majority\".[2] No Labels was founded in 2010 as a 501(c)(4) by current president and CEO Nancy Jacobson.[3][4]\n\nOn April 4, 2024, the organization ended its effort to run a presidential ticket for the 2024 United States presidential election. The organization stated that it would remain true to its commitment to not run a candidate who did not have a likely path to victory that would not act as a \"spoiler\" for either party[5] following the death of its chairman Joe Lieberman on March 27.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nNo Labels was founded on December 13, 2010, with the slogan \"Not Left. Not Right. Forward\". Organizers said the aim was to organize American voters against partisanship in politics and encourage a \"common ground\" approach to problem solving. The group's early efforts were viewed by some skeptics as an attempt to support a potential third party presidential campaign for Michael Bloomberg in 2012, which he and No Labels denied. No Labels had relatively few Republicans at its first conference in 2010,[7] and criticism of the movement at the time came largely from the right.[8][relevant? – discuss]\n\nCongress\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2013, No Labels promoted an informal \"Problem Solvers\" caucus in Congress for members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The group initially began as 24 Democratic and Republican members of Congress who pledged to meet regularly.[9] Members would identify their affiliation by wearing lapel pins, particularly during events such as the 2013 and 2015 State of the Union addresses.[10][11]\n\nIn 2017, the group helped to formally start the Problem Solvers Caucus in the House of Representatives, a bipartisan group of approximately 60 congressional members.\n\nBefore the 2019–2020 House term, No Labels released a plan to enhance bipartisan cooperation in Congress called The Speaker Project. Several planks from this proposal were later included in an agreement that the Problem Solvers Caucus reached with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[12] that some praised as practical and necessary,[13] while others claimed it might give House Republicans[13] and/or corporate interests[14] more power for that term.[15]\n\nIn 2021, the Problem Solvers Caucus released a \"Building Bridges\" blueprint for a bipartisan infrastructure deal. It was the first deal to be endorsed by Republicans and Democrats during that budget cycle.[16][relevant? – discuss]\n\n2024 presidential ticket\n\n[edit]\n\nNo Labels intended to run a bipartisan \"unity ticket\" in the 2024 presidential election, as an \"insurance policy\" in the event that \"both major parties nominate presidential candidates that the vast majority of Americans don’t want\". In November 2023, No Labels' chief strategist, Ryan Clancy, stated that \"Based on the conditions as they are, we expect to be putting up a ticket early next year\".[17] By February 2024, The New York Times described the efforts as having \"foundered for months now\" with the group's most high-profile potential candidates ruling-out running on a No Labels ticket.[18]\n\nSenator Joe Manchin was among the most high-profile candidates sought by No Labels, but in mid-February he ruled out a 2024 presidential run, citing timing and to avoid being a spoiler.[19][18] Congressman Dean Phillips said he would consider running on the No Labels ticket if polling suggested that President Joe Biden would end up losing to Donald Trump,[20] but reversed his statement a day later.[21][22] Former Republican governors Larry Hogan,[23] Jon Huntsman[24] and Nikki Haley,[25] have all denied interest in a presidential run on the No Labels ticket.\n\nNo Labels and its supporters cited polling showing voters' disapproval of the presumptive 2024 Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. In August 2022, No Labels released a poll of voters in eight battleground states, finding 63% of voters open to a \"moderate independent\" presidential candidate,[26] though Intelligencer columnist Ed Kilgore argues that once a specific candidate is chosen, polling numbers will drop dramatically.[27] A poll from Monmouth University on July 20, 2023, concluded that if No Labels' chosen candidates were more popular with conservatives, it's not clear which major party would benefit more: \"The presence of a third party in the race would siphon votes from both major party nominees, but it is not apparent it would play the role of a spoiler.\"[28] FiveThirtyEight's review of polling on July 13, 2023, predicted at that time that a bi-partisan ticket would likely benefit Trump.[29]\n\nThe effort was criticized by some Democrats, centrists, and Republicans who feared it could give former president Trump a second term.[30][31][32][33][34][35] One report claimed that certain center-left members of No Labels' Problem Solvers Caucus were \"in open revolt\";[36][37] co-founder William Galston resigned in protest.[38][39] A bipartisan group of former lawmakers launched a super PAC called Citizens to Save Our Republic to focus on stopping No Labels' presidential ticket.[40][41] Nonprofits Third Way and MoveOn also organized a campaign to get Democrats to disavow No Labels.[42] Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has been critical of the organization, stating that No Labels does not \"know who they’re going to hurt\".[43][44] Despite his expressed misgivings, in March 2024, Christie briefly considered making a No Labels run[45] before ruling out the idea later that same month.[46] Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the effort \"perilous to our democracy\" citing how a moderately successful 2024 presidential run would throw the election state congressional delegations which Republicans control.[47] President Biden has stated that a No Labels candidacy would help his opponent. Biden's top aides have blessed efforts of allies to push financial and political support away from No Labels and other potential third party bids. Democrats have worked to spread negative information about potential third party candidates while lawyers have researched options to limit ballot access.[20][48] Clancy stated in November 2023 that \"We don’t think Trump should ever again be president\", and promised that No Labels would not act as a spoiler that benefits Trump.[17]\n\nMike Rawlings confirmed in March 2024 that the organization still intended to field a presidential candidate.[49] Chairman Joe Lieberman announced the candidate selection process, discussing the creation of the \"Country Over Party Committee\", a group of 12 individuals which would vet and select a presidential and vice presidential candidate. At that point, the decision would be voted on by delegates of the organization.[50] By then, No Labels had ballot access in 16 states:[18] Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii,[51] Kansas,[52] Maine,[51] Maryland,[53] Mississippi, Montana,[54] Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, and Utah.[51]\n\nOn April 4, 2024, the organization ended its effort to run a presidential ticket for the 2024 election.[55] The New York Times said that Lieberman's death on March 27 meant the organization had \"little political firepower to recruit potential candidates\".[6] Joe Cunningham, the national director for No Labels, said the group was \"looking for a hero and a hero never emerged.\"[56] In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times later that month, No Labels lawyer Dan K. Webb stated that Christie had agreed in March to be a presidential candidate for the organization, but a Democratic vice-presidential nominee could not be found.[57]\n\nLegal disputes\n\n[edit]\n\nArizona\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Democratic Party of Arizona sued unsuccessfully in 2023 to prevent No Labels from recognition as a political party, with the ability to place candidates on the state ballot.[58] Over 15,000 Arizona residents have chosen to register their party affiliation as No Labels, more than the margin of victory in the 2020 presidential election in Arizona.\n\nAfter No Labels attained recognition, perennial candidate Richard Grayson opted to run under the No Labels banner. No Labels then sued the Arizona Secretary of State, Democrat Adrian Fontes, to prevent candidates it did not approve from running under the No Labels banner on its ballot line.[60] U.S. District Court Judge John Tuchi ruled in No Labels' favor.[61] However, Grayson qualified to run as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Alaska's at-large congressional district with the \"No Labels\" ballot label.[62]\n\nDurst lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2024, real estate heirs Douglas Durst and his cousin, Jonathan, sued No Labels alleging a \"bait and switch\" scheme had been used to finance their third-party presidential campaign. The Durst family says it has donated to No Labels since 2016, when the group's messaging focused on bipartisan policy legislation, but contend that No Labels' presidential ambitions are a breach of their donor's trust. According to No Labels, the Dursts have not donated in several years.[63]\n\nMaine\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2023, the Secretary of State of Maine, Democrat Shenna Bellows, sent No Labels a cease and desist letter after accusing the organization of misleading voters into registering for the party. She claimed that No Labels misrepresented voter registrations as petitions, and informed each registrant how to change their party affiliation. No Labels argued that Bellows' actions could amount to voter suppression and responded by stating that their organizers were instructed to ask voters to join their party, and noted that the form signed by voters is titled \"Maine Voter Registration Application\". While 798 people who received letters from Bellows unenrolled from No Labels, the group still had enough registered voters to qualify for the Maine ballot.[64][65] In January 2024, the party was confirmed as a qualified political party giving them ballot access.[66] No Labels has rejected a state-run primary in Maine.[67]\n\nIntimidation complaint\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2024, No Labels filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice alleging a \"illegal conspiracy to use intimidation, harassment and fear against representatives of No Labels, its donors and as potential candidates.\" The complaint claimed members of Third Way and The Lincoln Project actively threatened No Labels and prospective candidates to cease their presidential ambitions. Both Third Way and the Lincoln Project have denied the allegations.[68]\n\nFunding\n\n[edit]\n\nNo Labels does not disclose its donors' identities, citing the potential for lobbying and pressure campaigns for major donors to stop backing the organization. IRS section 501(c) organizations are not legally required to disclose their donors.[69] This lack of transparency has been a major source of criticism for the organization[70] alongside critiques that the group prioritizes the wellbeing of wealthy donors instead of policies with broad appeal that could reduce partisanship.[71][72][73][14] The Intercept and Jacobin report examples of the group working to block tax increases on the wealthiest Americans and corporations.[74][75]\n\nEarly donors to No Labels include board member Andrew Tisch, co-chairman of Loews Corporation; Ron Shaich, founder of Panera Bread; Dave Morin, a former Facebook executive, and supporters of Michael Bloomberg.[76] A 2018 Chicago Sun-Times investigation found five super PACs that were affiliated with No Labels,[77][78][79] sparking an OpenSecrets investigation identifying two more.[80] All seven super PACs were closed in 2020.[81][82][83][84][85][86][87] The Daily Beast reported that in 2018 No Labels' super PACs received more than $11 million from 53 donors, most of whom worked in finance.[71] The New Republic reported in 2023 that No Labels received major funding from Harlan Crow, a leading donor to Republican and conservative causes.[88] No Labels has been described as a dark money organization.[89][90][72][91]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nNancy Jacobson has been the board president since the founding of the organization and as of 2022, CEO.[92] In December 2020, No Labels announced Maryland governor Larry Hogan, as a national co-chair (prominent spokesperson[93]) to serve alongside the No Labels founding co-chair Joe Lieberman.[94] In January 2023, former NAACP executive director Benjamin Chavis joined Hogan as national co-chair.[95] In June 2023, former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory joined as a national co-chair.[96] Hogan stepped down as co-chair in December 2023.[97]\n\nNancy Jacobson and Jerald S. Howe Jr. (board treasurer) have been on the board since the founding of the group in 2010. Andrew Tisch joined in 2012. Andrew M. Bursky joined in 2015. Dennis C. Blair and Charles R. Black Jr. joined in 2019.[98] Tish Bazil was added to the organization's website as a board member in 2023.[99] Previous board members include: Ted Buerger (2010), Joshua Bekenstein (2010), Mark Nunnelly (2010), Mark McKinnon (2010–2012), Nate Garvis (2010–2013), Holly Page (2010–2013), Lisa Borders (2014–2017),[98] Kenneth A. Gross (2012–2023) and Margie Fox (2009–2023).[100]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nBased on 14 interviews with former employees in December 2022, Politico described a \"cutthroat culture\" within No Labels which one former aide called \"toxic\".[101] In response to the criticism, several senior officials for the group described to Politico the complaints as coming from \"aggrieved ex-workers\" who could not \"adapt\" to a demanding office culture.[101] In August 2023, a Black former outreach manager of No Labels sued the political organization, claiming she was discriminated against because of her race and retaliated against for reporting the alleged discrimination.[102]\n\nPolitico reported that in addition to requiring non-disclosure agreements, Nancy Jacobson has been accused by former employees of asking staff members to obscure where they work on LinkedIn, allegedly, in order to make it more difficult for journalists to interview No Labels employees.[101]\n\nTwo smaller left-leaning outlets have criticized the organization for its pro-Israel stances including around cracking down on campus protests.[103][104]\n\nDamon Townsend ran as a No Labels Party candidate for Secretary of State of Washington State in the August 6, 2024 primary.[105] He finished fourth with 5.02% of the vote.[106]\n\nRichard Grayson ran as a No Labels Party candidate for U.S. Representative from Alaska in the August 20, 2024 primary and finished eleventh with 0.12% of the vote.[107]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nForward Party\n\nMark Penn, husband of Nancy Jacobson\n\nPolitical moderate\n\nReagan Democrat\n\nReform Party\n\nSpoiler candidate\n\nThird party\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
