        "text": "The City of Saugatuck has created a Social District that is open all year-round (as of April 11th, 2022).\n\nA Social District allows for participating bars and restaurants to sell alcohol in a MARKED CONTAINER​ to customers that can then leave that bar or restaurants and move about within the commons area in social district.\n\nThis does NOT allow for the public to “bring your own” into the Social District. Alcohol purchased from other than a participating merchant is NOT allowed in any streets or parks in the City of Saugatuck.\n\nA participating bar or restaurant must first apply and receive approval from the City of Saugatuck, then submit and receive approval from the MLCC.\n\nAny alcoholic liquor sold to customers for consumption in the commons area by a licensee with a Social District Permit must comply with all of the following:\n\nThe serving container must prominently display the name of the licensee’s business, or logo.\n\nThe serving container must prominently display the City of Saugatuck’s Social District Logo, with the current date written on the sticker.\n\nThe serving container cannot be made of glass\n\nThe serving container does not have a liquid capacity over 16 ounces.\n\nThe City of Saugatuck highly encourages that the serving container, and the required label, are made of a disposable, compostable material.\n\nA customer that purchases alcoholic liquor to be consumed in a commons area may not take that beverage into another bar or restaurant.\n\nA customer that purchases alcoholic liquor to be consumed in a commons area may not take that beverage outside of the social district.\n\nLook for the City of Saugatuck Social District decal on retail store windows to indicate which stores permit you to enter with your beverage. Please be respectful of stores that do not wish to have social district beverages brought into their business.\n\nEnjoy the social district responsibly."
