        "text": "Full Circle Recycling Case Settles for $10,000\n\nIn August 2011, Full Circle Recycling Company agreed to pay $10,000.00 in penalties for violating air quality regulations: $7,500.00 will go to the California Air Pollution Control Fund, which provides funding for projects and research to improve California's air quality; $2,500.00 will go to Peralta Community College District to fund emission education classes conducted by participating California community colleges, under the California Council for Diesel Education and Technology (CCDET) program. An investigation by the Air Resources Board (ARB) showed that Full circle Recycling Company failed to properly self-inspect their diesel trucks to assure the trucks met state smoke emission standards, and to properly affix emission control labels the engines of their fleet vehicles. ARB documented violations as they related to the Periodic Smoke Inspection Program (PSIP). To settle the case, Full Circle Recycling Company agreed to the $10,000.00 penalty and to comply with the Emission Control Label and Periodic Smoke Inspection programs, and other ARB programs."
