        "text": "No indication of the Fleet or Jubilee line, but has the Victoria line, so post 1967, and probably not that long into the 1970s. Others will be able to comment base on the diagram style; and the fact that it is District line with Circle line: this may indicate that it is ex Q/OP/R District Line stock (noting that at one stage the East London was worked by District Q stock), pre-dating the C stock; rather than a 'Met' oriented diagram, combining the Met's H&C service and Circle line. But I don't recall how the integration(s) and SSL operating balance changed (between Met Extension (to Finchley Road and beyond); Met/H&C/Circle; and District 'sections') changed in that period,\n\nI think be this must be from CO/CP or R or Q stock: C stock never reached Upminster, for example. One oddity is that Bromley-by-Bow is shown as Bromley , despite its renaming (1967?) occurring before the Victoria line reached Victoria.\n\nThe dots to indicate interchange with British Rail might allow a finer dating, but my guess would be the very late 1960s: subsequent maps showing these lines (as used on the CO/CP and R stocks in their final years) has less curved depictions of the lines, both in the centre and the East.\n\nEdit: no, the inclusion of Embankment, rather than Charing Cross, makes it later than that. And suggests the naming of \"Bromley\" is an error"
