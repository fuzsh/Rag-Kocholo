        "text": "October 7, 1999 In the sequence of events that has art imitating life and then life turning around to imitate art, we had Warren Beatty last week playing himself playing Bulworth.\n\nYou remember that role in which Beatty takes on the character of a befuddled senator who gets so disgusted by the hypocrisy of politics that he puts out a contract on his own life. Then he finally has the courage to speak the truth about how politicians sell out to big-money interests and how the rest of us pay the price.\n\nLast week, when Beatty spoke about how the Democratic Party, the traditional party of the people, had betrayed its constituents, he sounded a lot like Bulworth.\n\nNo one should have been surprised at what he said, but the setting seemed a bit odd. He wasn't speaking at a labor gathering or in front of a factory, but in Beverly Hills to a glittering array of film stars who mostly make millions.\n\nIt has always surprised me that that so many Hollywood stars - despite their wealth - have found an affinity with average folk. Maybe it's because many have stayed connected to their humble roots, despite multimillion-dollar homes and dazzling lifestyles.\n\nBeatty spoke at the Beverly Hilton as the recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for political activism from the Southern California chapter of Americans for Democratic Action.\n\nAccording to a San Francisco Chronicle report, Beatty said that the Democratic party is drifting. \"It's enslaved by big money it's lost its purpose.\"\n\nWe didn't need Beatty to tell us that average men and women have been abandoned in the heady whirl of mergers and big profits for an elite few.\n\nAlthough the wage gap between rich and poor widened substantially during the Reagan and Bush administrations, that wasn't surprising because they were Republicans. When Clinton came into office, there was hope he would change that. But those hopes have been dashed the gap has not narrowed despite prosperity.\n\nThere had been talk of Beatty running for president for a couple of weeks before this award event. Did he get the idea from \"Bulworth,\" which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in? The film was an accurate, if somewhat farcical, picture of the state of American political life in the '90s. So the cycle seems completed with art imitating life and then inspiring a real-life imitation of the fiction, which, unhappily is more factual than is desirable.\n\nIf Beatty is serious about this presidential run - and we know there is adequate precedent for it - we'd expect he wouldn't want to go too far in imitating the film.\n\nWe'd like him to take Bulworth's enlightened ideas and run with them - without the film's tragic ending. Beatty's wife Annette Bening is an added plus. Don't you remember she fit quite nicely in the White House in the film, \"The American President\"?\n\nIn this era when media plays such a powerful role in politics, and good looks seem to count so much (could one of our greatest presidents, homely Abe Lincoln, ever get elected now?), Beatty would make a good candidate. He has as much star appeal as Reagan (actually more - he's made better films), is better looking than Clinton, and seems to have his heart in the right place - which is more than we can say about our current president.\n\nEven if Beatty didn't win, he has the charisma to bring attention to the failure of the Democratic Party under a Democratic president. And he can shine one of those Hollywood spotlights on the people who need a better break than they've gotten in a high-flying economy that hasn't been able to stop long enough to give them a piece of the action.\n\nDebbie Forman is the Times' features editor.
