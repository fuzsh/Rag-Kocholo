        "text": "The bigger movie star? Both burst onto the scene in unforgettable ways—Beatty, burning for Natalie Wood in Splendor in the Grass; Pitt, an object of female desire in Thelma & Louise—and both went on to create an ambitious body of work. Indeed, Pitt has been in some of the most provocative movies of the last quarter century, including Se7en, Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club, the unfairly dismissed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Inglourious Basterds, The Tree of Life, and 12 Years a Slave (which he also co-produced)—not to mention enjoyable hooey like Ocean’s Eleven and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. That’s an impressive list.\n\nBut Beatty’s list is more impressive. This isn’t only because his best ones—Splendor in the Grass, Bonnie and Clyde, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Parallax View, Shampoo, Reds, the unfairly reviled Ishtar, and Bulworth—are a bit better than Pitt’s. He starred in most of them back when movies were central to American culture. Nothing Pitt has done can compare to the sensational impact of Bonnie and Clyde, whose success ushered in the era of easy riders and raging bulls, the freest period in Hollywood history. If you’re under 40, you can’t know just how big a movie star Beatty was at his peak. In Hollywood, he was a king.\n\nWinner: Beatty\n\nThe more famous celebrity? Different eras produce different modes of fame—the terms of reference change. Pitt is clearly better known around the world than Beatty ever was. Not that Beatty didn’t have what it takes to be a titan in our tabloid era. Next to him, John Mayer looks like Mike Pence. Biographer Peter Biskind suggests he slept with more than 12,700 women, and if you simply listed his famous lovers (Wood, Joan Collins, Julie Christie, Mary Tyler Moore, Diane Keaton, Isabelle Adjani, Madonna, et cetera, up to his wife Annette Bening), you’d have enough to keep TMZ’s flying monkeys flapping around forever.\n\nBy comparison, Pitt’s romantic life has been rather modest. (Whose hasn’t?) His famous liaisons are Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie, and (so the rumor went) a marriage-scuppering affair with Marion Cotillard while making Allied. Yet in this new era, when reality TV trumps art, movie stars’ lives matter at least as much as their work in movies. As one of the defining figures of this era, Pitt took off in a way that Beatty, who came along earlier, never could. As part of the two-headed beast known as Brangelina—from the “poor Jen” period through the adoptions to the recent marital split—he achieved a level of celebrity so grandiose that it has overshadowed his genuine achievements.\n\nWinner: Pitt\n\nThe better actor? A hard call. While both can be very good actors—and pretty lousy when given duff or formulaic material—they occupy different comfort zones.\n\nAlthough Pitt has the look of a classic leading man, something in him resists the role. He has the soul of a character actor, who puts himself forward by disappearing. That’s when he really has fun. He likes being scruffed up; he likes playing oddballs; he likes being part of an ensemble. He’s at his dullest when being asked to schlep his movie star charisma through mediocre material (Meet Joe Black, for instance, or World War Z) to enliven it with his aura. His most vivid performances come when he isn’t playing a glamorous hero but a nut job (Twelve Monkeys), a stoner (True Romance), a scary father (The Tree of Life), or an outlaw who beats children (The Assassination of Jesse James).\n\nIn contrast, Beatty—who clearly wanted to be a movie star far more than Pitt—has always had a sense of a star’s prerogatives and his own inviolate centrality. He’s at his best when dominating the action—as the high-powered yet impotent bank robber in Bonnie and Clyde, the doomed gambler in McCabe & Mrs. Miller, the client-bedding hairdresser in Shampoo, the hip-hop politician in Bulworth. Not for him the kind of supporting roles that Pitt knocks out of the park. He preferred to be a romantic lead in duds like Love Affair and Town & Country. In fact, Beatty reportedly turned down iconic supporting roles in two landmark movies by younger directors—the pornmeister played by Burt Reynolds in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights, and the perfidious Bill in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill—and it dated him. Cut off from younger viewers, Beatty lost his relevance.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nThe greater egomaniac?\n\nCarly Simon didn’t write “You’re So Vain” after having an affair with Brad Pitt.\n\nWinner: Beatty\n\nThe broader vision? It’s part of Pitt’s image that he’s a laid-back guy who doesn’t seek publicity or enjoy dolling up for fancy parties (which surely drove Paltrow crazy). One pictures him on the sofa, probably an expensive one, getting high on very good weed. This is, of course, to reduce the man to a cliché. In real life, Pitt collects cycads, produces movies (or at least has his people do it), and supports numerous charities. He’s not an aging slacker.\n\nBut he also doesn’t hum with the enterprising energy of Beatty, who, in between those alleged 12,700 or so women and starring roles in more than 30 movies, found time to direct five films (he won an Oscar for Reds), become a big player in Democratic politics (he stumped on the campaign trail for George McGovern in 1972), and develop a deep understanding of how power works in Hollywood. Perhaps no star has ever had such knowledge of the movie business. Beatty thinks about things from every angle, as you discover when you talk to him: He’s smart, thoughtful, careful, precise, profoundly attentive to what you’re saying. In fact, he sees so many aspects of things that at times this sense of complexity can tie him in knots. Just consider: Beatty and Clint Eastwood hit Hollywood around the same time, and Beatty became a star faster. But over the intervening half century, Eastwood went on to star in roughly 20 more movies, to direct nearly 40 (!) more movies, and, amazingly, win three more Oscars than Beatty. Beatty is not a man who puts his head down and keeps plowing. For good and ill, he always sees the big picture—and the small one, too.\n\nWinner: Beatty\n\nThe better movie out right now? Allied and Rules Don’t Apply have much in common. Both are period pieces. Both are romances whose lovers run afoul of powerful forces. And in their classic style, both are throwbacks to an earlier era of Hollywood. Yet they go in quite different directions. So do their lead actors: Even as Pitt takes on a conventional leading man role, Beatty makes like a scruffy character actor.\n\nOf the two, Allied seems the more promising. For starters, it was made by Robert Zemeckis, one of the Hollywood’s few remaining masters, and in Pitt and Cotillard, it boasts terrific stars whose appearance comes accompanied by the kind of gossip that always gives a movie extra juice.\n\nThe movie opens wonderfully. We’re looking at the world from somewhere up in the sky when, descending through the top of the screen, a man parachutes down past us. It’s Pitt, playing Max Vatan, a Canadian-born secret agent, who’s on his way to Nazi-run Casablanca (yes, as in Casablanca) to meet a beautiful, mysterious French colleague, Marianne Beauséjour—that’s Cotillard—who’ll pretend to be his wife as they fulfill a dangerous mission. Sounds good, no?\n\nBut things quickly start feeling off. While the production design and camerawork are immaculate, you feel like you’re caught in something deeply artificial—not reality, but a re-creation of old movies, lacking the urgent pulse of life. Especially Pitt. Where Cotillard endows Marianne with quicksilver emotions, he looks unhappily caught in the kind of heroic role he’s never enjoyed playing. Portraying a terse man of action supposedly filled with bottled-up emotion, he often appears to be sleepwalking. Don’t be fooled by talk about the stars’ “steamy” sex scenes. Although there’s a nifty-looking one inside their car in a sandstorm, the two don’t have much chemistry. What heat they do have comes from Cotillard.\n\nPitt perks up in the film’s second half, when the action switches to bombed-out London, becoming a romantic potboiler about whether Max can trust Marianne. As he grows more and more desperate, Pitt starts showing flashes of his depth as an actor. But there’s only so much he can do. Alas, he’s trapped with a script (by Steven Knight) whose dialogue is often clubfooted, whose plot twists are hokey, and whose tear-jerking sentimentality might’ve played better during WWII than it does today.\n\nThere’s also something deeply old-fashioned about Rules Don’t Apply, and not only because it begins in late-’50s Hollywood. Alden Ehrenreich plays Frank Forbes, an ambitious young driver for Howard Hughes (Beatty) who gets romantically involved with virginal young actress Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins), who has come to L.A. to potentially star in a movie for a company owned by the famed mogul-lothario. As they fall for each other, the two do all sorts of cute movie stuff, as when Frank teaches Marla to drive (she speeds, runs stop signs, et cetera), a comic scene I mention only because it was shot right outside my house in Pasadena, with Beatty literally standing on my front lawn to direct. But the course of love never runs smooth, as you may have heard. Hughes is an absolute control freak who forbids his employees to have romantic relationships, and if that weren’t enough, the great man quickly comes to see Frank as a kind of surrogate son and develops, however briefly, a different kind of interest in Marla.\n\nNow, this isn’t a bad setup for a movie that juggles comedy, romance, and drama, and it must be said that Rules Don’t Apply is filled with all manner of incidental pleasures, especially its nifty evocation of ’50s Hollywood (the old footage is fab), back in the days when Frank and Marla can sit together at her place in the Hills and listen to the music rise up from the Hollywood Bowl. But this never really pays off. You see, Beatty, who also wrote the script, doesn’t appear to have much interest in Frank and Marla—he can’t think of much for them to do.\n\nInstead, the movie gets taken over (big surprise!) by Hughes, with whom Beatty has been fascinated for decades. From the moment Hughes makes his spectral appearance 30-odd minutes into the film, the movie switches gears. It becomes obsessed with the minutiae of a man who isn’t just a world-class weirdo, but a world-class weirdo worth billions. Plunging into the role of Hughes with all the brio Pitt does not bring to Allied’s Max, Beatty gives us a brilliant tycoon whose life becomes defined by his eccentricities—repeating himself crazily, refusing to meet bankers who’ve flown across the country to see him, serving guests TV dinners and freaking out if there’s not enough Baskin-Robbins Banana Nut ice cream. To work for him is to be tormented.\n\nAs with Allied, Rules Don’t Apply feels like two separate movies that have been stitched together, not altogether successfully. But if you asked which one I enjoyed more, I’d choose Rules Don’t Apply. Not only is it lighter in spirit, it’s personal. You can tell that Beatty isn’t just dutifully making a movie in order to have a movie, which is how Allied too often feels. He’s authentically interested in Howard Hughes.\n\nWinner: Beatty\n\nAnd the grand winner is? Warren Beatty\n\nExcept . . .\n\nThe brighter future? . . . time’s handwriting is upon us all, even movie stars. At 52, Pitt is 27 years younger than Beatty, which gives him plenty of years to keep racking up good movies, maybe even to start directing them himself (Eastwood directed more than 20 movies after turning Pitt’s current age). I wouldn’t be surprised if, when we look back on this comparison in 2043 when Pitt is 79, these rankings may well have changed. A quarter century is a long, long time."
