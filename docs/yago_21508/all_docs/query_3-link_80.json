        "text": "Hollywood Shuffle is a series that celebrates our cultural icons in film and television whose performances have resonated with generations of viewers. From the pioneering actors and actresses who’ve helped break barriers and pave the way for those to follow, to the most promising and decorated thespians of today, their dedication to their craft is respected and appreciated.\n\nWowing audiences over the past 30 years and counting, actress Halle Berry touts a resume worthy of her stature as cinematic royalty. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Berry first gained notoriety as a model and beauty pageant contestant before deciding that her true passion lay in acting. In 1989, Berry moved to New York City, where she landed her first television role as Emily Franklin in the Who’s the Boss? spin-off, Living Dolls.\n\nFollowing the show’s cancellation, Berry moved to L.A. and scored her first movie credit in the 1991 Spike Lee drama Jungle Fever. Later that year, she nabbed a co-starring role in the romantic comedic film Strictly Business but would bolster her profile even further with her prominent role in the hit 1992 film Boomerang.\n\nFrom there, Berry secured a string of A-List roles, allowing her to showcase her wide range of talents onscreen. From movies like 1993’s The Program, 1996’s Executive Decision, and 1998’s Bulworth to the 1995 television film Solomon & Sheba, Berry strung together a succession of performances that made her a fan favorite among the public. By the end of the ’90s, Berry was considered one of the most bankable and decorated actresses in Hollywood.\n\nYet, her career would take an unprecedented leap following the turn of the century, as Berry garnered numerous awards. In addition to winning a Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Berry also took home the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2002 for her role in the hit film Monster’s Ball, becoming the first and only African-American woman to receive the honor to date.\n\nSince then, Berry’s career has featured additional highlights. Becoming an action hero in the blockbuster X-Men film series and recently pairing her acting and directing chops for the critically-acclaimed 2020 Netflix film Bruised, Berry continues to break ground while entertaining the crowd.\n\nIn this edition of Hollywood Shuffle, VIBE looks back on the 10 iconic roles that have defined Halle Berry’s career."
