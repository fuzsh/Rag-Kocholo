        "text": "“I think it’s valuable to take a look at the way things were,” says Warren Beatty, the director, writer, co-producer, and star of Rules Don’t Apply. His first feature directorial effort since 1998’s Bulworth, the film is a love letter from the actor to the Hollywood he first encountered, in the late 1950s, when he followed his older sister, actress Shirley MacLaine, from a Baptist upbringing in Virginia to Los Angeles. “I always thought it might be a good idea, that I would enjoy making a movie that reflects that period and that place,” Beatty says of the backdrop. “I don’t see movies like that much now, and I thought it might be fun. Retrospect is nothing to sneeze at.”\n\nLargely set and shot in L.A., Rules Don’t Apply centers on the budding romance of an independent young actress, Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins), and her earnestly ambitious driver, Frank Forbes (Alden Ehrenreich), both pious newcomers to Tinseltown whose love is forbidden by their omniscient employer, the famously eccentric Howard Hughes (Beatty). To achieve the film’s textured, unmistakably midcentury visual style, Beatty says he referenced a number of movies that were made in that era, yet he politely declines to name them. “You either feel it or don’t,” he says of the aesthetic. “It’s not as though you make a list of the things that you will do that will cause it to seem period.” Though seem period it certainly does.\n\nBeatty adds that he began working on the project with a few specific locations in mind, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Hughes is known to have kept a number of bungalows and suites. (“He was highly skilled at staying out of sight,” Beatty says of the reclusive genius.) For the meticulous design decisions involved, Beatty relied on a team of industry veterans, namely production designer Jeannine Oppewall, set decorator Nancy Haigh, and costume designer Albert Wolsky. Beatty credits visual effects supervisor John Scheele and archive supervisor Deborah Ricketts with finding exceptionally restored archival footage of exterior locations to ensure accuracy. Here, Beatty talks about his creative process and what went into the filming of Rules Don’t Apply.\n\nFollowing an evening that included her first encounter with Champagne, Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins) falls asleep on a sofa in her house, which is situated above and within earshot of the Hollywood Bowl and was provided to her by Howard Hughes (Warren Beatty). “I felt that house would be appropriate,” says Beatty of the modernist Hollywood Hills abode, built in 1951. “It’s not wildly expensive but certainly a nice house.” The director and his production team reportedly explored some 100 homes before Beatty was satisfied with the chosen lot."
