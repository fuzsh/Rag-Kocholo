We’ll uncover the transformative tales of 10 companies who’ve made the leap, and offer you a unique perspective, igniting the spark for your own digital transformation journey.\n\nIntroduction – the need for digital transformation in the Service Industry\n\nIf you’ve landed on this page, chances are you’re intrigued by the digital transformation wave sweeping across the service industry. You’re not alone. Today, more than ever, the digital landscape is evolving at lightning speed, and businesses across the globe are racing to keep up. This digital revolution is creating an exciting new era of possibilities with monetization of APIs, interoperability that creates new services, and more secure companies. It’s truly redefining the way companies operate.\n\nThe service industry, in particular, is in the throes of this digital metamorphosis, leveraging technology to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and create competitive advantage. From retail to banking, healthcare to hospitality, the impact is widespread and the change – to pick a fitting word -transformative.\n\nToday we’ll take you on a trip through the digital transformation journeys of ten companies in the service industry. These pioneers have embraced change, taking on the challenge of innovation to not only remain relevant but to push the envelope of the possible. May they inspire you and spark ideas that apply to your own company. And if you’re looking for a partner to guide you through, know that we at Yenlo are the ready for you.\n\nStay with us as we peek behind the curtain of great companies like Marriott International, Domino’s, ING Bank, Just Eat, BMW, Roche, ASOS, Bosch, Unilever, and Adidas. You’re about to discover how these industry titans have rewritten the rules of the game.\n\n1. Marriott International: Reimagining Hospitality with a Digital Key\n\nLet’s begin with a name synonymous with world-class hospitality – Marriott International. The hotel giant has always prided itself on offering guests a personalized, high-quality experience. With the arrival of digital transformation in the service industry, Marriott saw an opportunity to take this experience to an entirely new level.\n\nAt the heart of Marriott’s digital transformation lies a piece of technology as humble as it is revolutionary – their mobile app. But this isn’t just any app. It acts as a virtual concierge for Marriott guests, allowing guests to check-in and out, request additional items for their room, chat with hotel staff, and even unlock their room using their smartphone.\n\nBy harnessing the power of mobile technology, Marriott has effectively transformed the customer experience, offering convenience and personalization to its guests. The ability to check-in using the app, for instance, allows guests to bypass the front desk upon arrival, saving them precious time and waiting in line. Likewise, having the ability to unlock their room with their smartphone adds another layer of convenience, effectively making traditional room keys a thing of the past.\n\nMarriott’s digital transformation didn’t just stop at enhancing guest experiences. It also brought about significant improvements in operational efficiency. Digitizing processes traditionally carried out manually not only save time and resources but also reduce the scope for human error, leading to a more consistent delivery of service.\n\nBut what truly sets Marriott apart is its forward-thinking approach. The company is already experimenting with the Internet of Things (IoT) for their rooms, which would allow guests to personalize their room settings using the app – think of adjusting room temperature, lighting, and entertainment, all with a few taps on their own smartphone.\n\nMarriott International’s is a shining example of how digital technologies in the service industry can be leveraged to create a more seamless and personalized customer experience. As the hotel industry becomes increasingly competitive, Marriott’s commitment to innovation serves as an inspiring lesson for others.\n\nAnd Marriott was just the start of our list today! Let’s find out how a pizza company became a tech powerhouse.\n\n2. Domino’s Pizza: From Pizza Delivery to Tech Innovator\n\nOur next stop takes us to a company you might initially think of more in terms of pizza than technology. But make no mistake, Domino’s is a leading player for digital transformation in service industry, proving that innovation can come from the most unexpected places.\n\nAt first glance, it’s hard to imagine how much Domino’s, a pizza delivery company, could benefit from digital transformation. Yet, by daring to think outside the pizza box, Domino’s has fundamentally changed how it interacts with its customers.\n\nRemember the time when ordering a pizza meant making a phone call, going through the menu, and hoping that the person on the other end got your order right and had a good grasp of the city map so the pizza would be delivered on time?\n\nThose days are long gone, thanks to Domino’s innovative multi-channel ordering system. Now, whether you prefer to order via their website, mobile app, or even sending a simple pizza-emoji through social media platforms like Twitter, Domino’s gets it right. The beauty of this system lies in its simplicity and convenience, providing customers with multiple touchpoints to interact with the brand.\n\nBut the innovation doesn’t stop there. Domino’s has also incorporated Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their ordering system through a virtual assistant named “Dom.” Dom can process voice orders, answer queries, and even crack a joke or two.\n\nDomino’s pushed the envelope further by piloting drone and autonomous vehicle deliveries, showing their commitment to exploring new technologies to improve service. The company’s dynamic approach to digital transformation has not only streamlined their operations but also enhanced the customer experience by offering faster, more convenient delivery options.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, Domino’s success story shows how digital transformation in the service industry can go beyond the conventional boundaries of technology adoption. By fully embracing digital tools and capabilities, the company has reinvented itself as a tech company that happens to sell pizza, thereby setting a new standard in the industry.\n\nUp next, we’re delving into the world of finance with the Dutch ING Bank.\n\n3. ING Bank: Agile Banking in a Digital World\n\nThe digital transformation in the service industry takes us into the realm of finance, where ING Bank is setting new benchmarks. The Dutch banking giant has embraced a digital-first approach with open arms, revolutionizing the banking experience for millions of its customers.\n\nOne of the key strategies ING employed to achieve this is the introduction of agile working methods. Traditionally used in the tech industry, agile methods focus on flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. By implementing this methodology, ING has been able to adapt quickly to changing customer demands and market trends, creating a culture of innovation and continuous learning. This marked a significant shift from traditional banking models and allowed ING to offer standout services to its customers.\n\nBut like Marriott International and Domino’s, the heart of ING’s digital transformation lies in their highly-rated mobile banking app. Designed to deliver a seamless banking experience, the app enables customers to manage their accounts, make payments, and even apply for loans or insurances from the convenience of their smartphones. This is a significant advancement in an industry that was once characterized by lengthy paperwork and inconvenient branch visits and now leans into the world of Open Banking.\n\nOne of the most inspiring aspects of ING’s digital transformation is their commitment to financial inclusivity. Through initiatives like the ‘ING-DiBa’ in Germany, the bank has utilized digital platforms to offer banking services to customers who may have limited access to traditional banking infrastructure.\n\nING Bank’s innovative approach to digital transformation in the service industry serves as an inspiring example for other financial institutions. They’ve shown how banks can utilize technology to make banking more convenient and accessible, and in the process, become a customer-centric, agile, and digital-first organization.\n\nIf you’re hungry for more, stay tuned for our next innovator – Just Eat.\n\n4. Just Eat: Serving up Innovation in the Food Delivery Sector\n\nOur voyage now passes a company that’s adding a dash and sprinkle of innovation to our food ordering experiences. Meet Just Eat, an online food delivery company that’s pioneering digital transformation in the service industry.\n\nJust Eat has successfully turned the once cumbersome process of ordering food into a simple, convenient, and enjoyable experience. With a few taps on their mobile app or website, customers can browse through a wide array of restaurants, place an order, track its progress, and get it delivered straight to their doorstep. But the digital transformation at Just Eat goes beyond just an easy-to-use app.\n\nIn a bid to enhance customer service, Just Eat has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into their platform. For instance, they’ve used machine learning algorithms to recommend restaurants to customers based on their past orders, preferred cuisines, and even the time of day. This personalization feature enhances the customer experience by providing tailored suggestions, saving them time and effort.\n\nJust Eat has also been experimenting with innovative delivery methods. Remember the times when food delivery meant a person on a bike? Just Eat challenged this notion by – similar to Domino’s – testing drone deliveries in select locations, indicating their readiness to explore and adopt forward-thinking technologies to improve their services.\n\nWhat’s more, Just Eat’s digital transformation journey also offers valuable insights into how companies can scale up their operations in the digital age. Leveraging integration technology, Just Eat rapidly expanded its presence across the globe, serving millions of customers across numerous countries.\n\nTime to drive some more change with our next example: BMW.\n\n5. BMW: Shifting Gears with Digital Transformation\n\nCruising into the world of automotive, we encounter BMW – a brand synonymous with quality, innovation, and a drive (pun intended) for excellence. BMW is not just manufacturing cars; they’re crafting experiences. Their quest for delivering the ultimate driving experience has led them to embrace digital transformation in the service industry, creating a paradigm shift in how we perceive mobility.\n\nBMW’s digital transformation journey is characterized by their mission to design not just cars, but ‘Smart Cars.’ They’ve embarked on the path of autonomous, connected, and electric cars, utilizing advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These cars are equipped with connected drive services, providing drivers with intelligent assistance and digital services that enhance their driving experience. Imagine your car learning your daily routes, preferences, updating its software over the air, and even communicating with other cars on the road for better safety. BMW is turning these imaginations into reality.\n\nBMW is also using digital technology to streamline its customer journey. They’ve digitized several touchpoints in the customer journey, providing customers with the ability to customize their cars online, offering virtual tours of vehicles, and allowing for online vehicle booking.\n\nBeyond the product, BMW’s factories also adapt to digital transformation. Robotic process automation, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered quality control are some examples of how BMW is using digital transformation to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve quality in their manufacturing process.\n\nBMW’s digital transformation journey is a shining beacon in the automotive industry. It reflects how embracing digital transformation in the service industry can significantly enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and open up new roads for innovation.\n\nFrom open roads to Open Healthcare – let’s dive into our next example: Roche\n\n6. Roche: Pioneering Digital Transformation in Healthcare\n\nNavigating the world of healthcare, we discover a company that’s transforming how we perceive medical treatment and patient care. Enter Roche – a global pioneer in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Roche has been at the forefront of digital transformation in the service industry.\n\nRoche’s digital transformation journey is marked by their quest to turn “patients” into “health consumers”. To achieve this, Roche is using technological advancements to empower individuals to take control of their own health. Their online health platforms and mobile apps enable users to manage their health conditions, monitor vital statistics, and share their data with healthcare providers, all at the touch of a button.\n\nThey have invested heavily in data analytics and machine learning to create more personalized and effective treatments. By analyzing and integrating large volumes of patient data, Roche can identify patterns and correlations that help predict disease outcomes, tailor treatment plans, and monitor disease progression.\n\nRoche’s Navify Tumor Board solution is a perfect example of this. It’s a cloud-based software that pulls patient data from various sources, enabling healthcare teams to make more informed treatment decisions. It’s digital transformation in the service industry at its finest – bringing together data and technology to improve patient care.\n\nBeyond patient care, Roche also uses digital technologies to streamline its operations, improve productivity, and drive innovation. From automating laboratory processes to employing AI for drug discovery, Roche’s digital transformation is broad-based and comprehensive.\n\nOur journey exploring digital transformation in the service industry continues. The next stop is the innovative shopping experience of ASOS.\n\n7. ASOS: Tailoring the Future of Fashion\n\nOur exploration of the digital transformation in the service industry takes us to the world of fashion, where ASOS is weaving a tapestry of innovation. This UK-based online retailer is reshaping the way we shop for clothes, pushing the envelope of technology and creativity.\n\nASOS’s digital transformation story revolves around the customer. With their powerful mobile app and website, they’ve redefined the shopping experience, making it more interactive, personalized, and enjoyable. From product discovery to purchase and post-purchase interactions, each touchpoint on the customer journey has been digitally enhanced.\n\nAt the heart of ASOS’s digital transformation lies a fascinating application of artificial intelligence (AI) – visual search. This feature allows users to upload a picture of an item they like, and the system then returns a list of similar products available on ASOS. It’s like having a personal stylist at your fingertips!\n\nHowever, it’s not just customer-facing interfaces where ASOS has deployed digital transformation. They’ve also revolutionized their back-end operations. For instance, ASOS has adopted automation and robotics in their warehouses to streamline their order fulfillment process, ensuring quicker and more accurate deliveries to their customers worldwide. It’s a powerful showcase of integration technology in action.\n\nASOS’s commitment to innovation goes beyond their own operations. They’ve launched an accelerator program to support start-ups developing technology-based solutions in the fashion industry, boosting an ecosystem of digital innovation.\n\nASOS’s digital transformation journey is a shining example of how technology can be utilized to personalize the customer experience and streamline operations. Up next, we’ll explore Bosch, an industry veteran who is reinventing itself through digital transformation.\n\n8. Bosch: Interoperability across Industries\n\nLet’s look at an industry leader that’s been at the top of their game for over a century – Bosch. Known for its diverse portfolio spanning automotive parts, household appliances, industrial products, and more, Bosch is harnessing digital transformation to shape the future fo our households.\n\nAt the heart of Bosch’s digital transformation is its firm belief in the “IoT future.” Bosch foresees a world where everything that can be connected will be connected, creating smarter homes, factories, and cities. Bosch’s IoT Suite, a comprehensive toolbox in the cloud, facilitates this vision by offering developers a complete set of tools to build, implement, and operate IoT applications.\n\nIn the realm of mobility, Bosch is using digital transformation to create smarter, safer, and more efficient vehicles. From connected services for automated driving to electrification and software solutions, Bosch’s innovative technologies are really driving the future of mobility.\n\nNot limiting themselves to their own digital transformation, Bosch is also assisting other businesses in their digital approaches. Bosch Digital Services offers a broad portfolio of IT and software solutions to help companies optimize their processes, improve productivity, and accelerate their digital transformation.\n\nWhat’s inspiring about Bosch’s digital transformation is its ability to innovate across diverse industries. By intertwining technology and services, Bosch is shaping connected living, working, and mobility solutions. Our next example is a company that also operates across multiple boards: Unilever.\n\n9. Unilever: Stirring up Digital Transformation in Consumer Goods\n\nNext up, Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company. Known for its vast portfolio of popular brands, Unilever is stirring the pot of digital transformation, redefining how consumer goods companies operate and interact with consumers.\n\nUnilever’s digital transformation strategy hinges on data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). By integrating, connecting, and analyzing enormous amounts of consumer data, Unilever can gain valuable insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. This allows them to develop more personalized marketing campaigns, create products that resonate better with consumer needs, and make more informed business decisions.\n\nIn the supply chain, Unilever has turned to digital technologies to increase efficiency and reduce waste. Automated warehouses, real-time inventory management, and predictive analytics for demand forecasting are just a few examples of how Unilever is digitizing its operations.\n\nHowever, Unilever’s digital transformation isn’t just about technology; it’s also about people.

They’ve also created a digital hub where teams can collaborate, experiment with new technologies, and develop innovative solutions.\n\nUnilever has also turned to social media and e-commerce to reach and engage with consumers directly. By leveraging digital platforms, they’ve managed to break down barriers, interacting with consumers in a more personalized and immediate way.\n\nUnilever provides valuable lessons for other consumer goods companies seeking to undergo their own digital transformation in the service industry. Time to wrap up our journey with one last stop – a visit to German sporting giant, Adidas.\n\n10. Adidas: Running Towards a Digital Future\n\nAs we reach the final stretch of our journey through digital transformation in the service industry, we lace up our shoes with Adidas, a global sporting goods giant. Adidas has been sprinting towards a digital future, using technology to redefine the athletic industry.\n\nAdidas’s digital transformation strategy revolves around creating personalized experiences for its customers. By using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), Adidas is able to gain deep insights into consumer behavior and preferences.\n\nAn example of this is the Adidas Creator’s Club, a membership program that uses machine learning algorithms to provide a highly personalized experience.
