        "text": "What are Consumer Products?\n\nConsumer products, also referred to as final goods, are products that are bought by individuals or households for personal use. In other words, consumer products are goods that are bought for consumption by the average consumer. From a marketing perspective, there are four types of consumer products, each with different marketing considerations.\n\nTypes of Consumer Products\n\nConvenience products\n\nShopping products\n\nSpecialty products\n\nUnsought products\n\nConvenience Products\n\nConvenience products are bought the most frequently by consumers. They are bought immediately and without great comparison between other options. Convenience products are typically low-priced, not-differentiated among other products, and placed in locations where consumers can easily purchase them. The products are widely distributed, require mass promotion, and are placed in convenient locations.\n\nSugar, laundry detergent, pencils, pens, and paper are all examples of convenience products.\n\nCharacteristics of Convenience Products\n\nPurchased frequently\n\nAt a low price point\n\nEasily available\n\nNot commonly compared with other products\n\nShopping Products\n\nShopping products are bought less frequently by consumers. Consumers usually compare attributes of shopping products, such as quality, price, and style, between other products. Therefore, shopping products are more carefully compared, and consumers spend considerably more time, as opposed to convenience products, comparing alternatives. Shopping products require personal selling and advertising and are located in fewer outlets (compared to convenience products) and selectively distributed.\n\nAirline tickets, furniture, electronics, clothing, and phones are all examples of shopping products.\n\nCharacteristics of Shopping Products\n\nPurchased less frequently\n\nAt a medium price point\n\nCommonly compared among other products\n\nSpecialty Products\n\nSpecialty products are products with unique characteristics or brand identification. Consumers of such products are willing to exert special effort to purchase specialty products. Specialty products are typically high priced, and buyers do not use much time to compare them against other products. Rather, buyers typically spend more effort in buying specialty products compared to other types of products.\n\nTake, for example, a Ferrari (a specialty product). Purchasers of a Ferrari would need to spend considerable effort sourcing the car. Specialty products require targeted promotions with exclusive distribution; they are found in select places.\n\nSports cars, designer clothing, exotic perfumes, luxury watches, and famous paintings are all examples of specialty products.\n\nCharacteristics of Shopping Products\n\nWith unique characteristics or brand perception\n\nPurchased less frequently\n\nAt a high price point\n\nSeldom compared between other products\n\nOnly available at select/special places\n\nUnsought Products\n\nUnsought products are products that consumers do not normally buy or would not consider buying under normal circumstances. Consumers of unsought products typically do not think about these products until they need them. The price of unsought products varies. As unsought products are not conventionally thought of by consumers, they require aggressive advertising and personal selling.\n\nDiamond rings, pre-planned funeral services, and life insurance are all examples of unsought products.\n\nCharacteristics of Shopping Products\n\nNot top-of-mind of consumers\n\nRequires extensive advertising and marketing efforts\n\nImportance of Understanding the Types of Consumer Products\n\nUnderstanding whether products are convenience, shopping, specialty, or unsought is very important. As noted above, each type requires different marketing efforts.\n\nFor example, it would not make sense to expend considerable marketing efforts on sugar. There is little differentiation between different brands of sugars and spending money on advertising would not play a role in changing consumer perception.\n\nOn the other hand, unsought products would require considerable marketing efforts. As a consumer, purchasing life insurance is not top-of-mind; consumers do not normally think about it. Therefore, considerable marketing and advertising efforts are required to make unsought products known and to warrant a purchase by consumers.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThank you for reading CFIâ€™s guide on Consumer Products.
