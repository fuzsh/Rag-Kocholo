        "text": "The Marketing Department plays a vital role in promoting the business and mission of an organization. It serves as the face of your company, coordinating and producing all materials representing the business. It is the Marketing Department's job to reach out to prospects, customers, investors and/or the community, while creating an overarching image that represents your company in a positive light.\n\nDepending on your company, the duties of the Marketing Department may include one or more of the following:\n\nDefining and managing your brand. This involves defining who you are, what you stand for, what you say about yourself, what you do and how your company acts. This, in turn, defines the experience you want your customers and partners to have when they interact with you.\n\nConducting campaign management for marketing initiatives. Marketing proactively identifies the products and services to focus on over the course of your sales cycle, and then produces materials and communications that get the word out.\n\nProducing marketing and promotional materials. Your marketing department should create the materials that describe and promote your core products and/or services. They should be kept up-to-date as those products and services evolve.\n\nCreating content providing search engine optimization for your website. Your website is often the first (and possibly the only) place people go for information about you. Your marketing department will be responsible for keeping Web content current, while also working to ensure your site comes up quickly when someone searches for your type of business.\n\nMonitoring and managing social media. Marketing should contribute to, manage and maintain your social media pages. It should also manage accounts and carefully watch whatâ€™s being posted about you online.\n\nProducing internal communications. Your employees need to understand your company, its values, its goals and its priorities. Marketing is often responsible for employee communications through a newsletter and/or intranet.\n\nServing as media liaison. When your company is cited in the media, a member of the marketing department often acts as spokesperson for your company, or guides executives in how to respond to media queries.\n\nConducting customer and market research. Research helps you define target markets and opportunities and helps you understand how your products and services are perceived.\n\nOverseeing outside vendors and agencies. Marketing is typically responsible for selecting and managing the agencies and vendors who produce marketing materials and or/provide marketing support. These may include ad agencies, print vendors, PR agencies or specialists, Web providers, etc."
