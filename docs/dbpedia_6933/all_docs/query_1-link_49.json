        "text": "Learn about the four-step process your company or organization can follow to do business with FEMA, in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Act.\n\n1. Talk to your Local Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Center (APTAC)\n\nGovernment contracting can be complex, especially for small businesses getting involved for the first time. Fortunately, there are offices ready to help you: the Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs). There are PTAC counselors in over 300 locations who will work with you to understand the steps to getting a contract with the government.\n\nThe Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Center (APTAC) also provides business guidance and tips for registering with SAM.gov.\n\n2. Register in System for Award Management (SAM)\n\nOnce you have an understanding of the process from the PTAC counselor, you must register to do business with the federal government through the System for Award Management (SAM). Registration is free.\n\nYou will need a Unique Entity ID (UEI) and your Tax Identification Number (request by visiting www.irs.gov) if your principal business is located in the United States or U.S. territories. The Unique Entity ID is a 12-character alphanumeric ID assigned to an entity by SAM.gov. Please note that this replaces the Dun and Bradstreet \"DUNS\" Number that was previously used for SAM.gov new registrations.\n\nDuring the registration process, you must indicate you want to participate in the Disaster Response Registry. This allows contracting officers to locate your company through the Disaster Response Registry Search.\n\n3. Understand FEMA’s Mission and Goals\n\nFEMA’s mission is to help people before, during and after disasters. This is the top focus of everybody working for or with FEMA in the field. Once there is a presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, FEMA coordinates and collaborates with federal, state, local and tribal agencies to get assistance to survivors.\n\nIf your company has goods or services that are useful in the situations described below, then proceed to step two.\n\nEmergency Support Functions (ESFs) may be selectively activated for both Stafford Act and non-Stafford Act incidents. Resources coordinated though ESFs are assigned where needed within the response structure. Regardless of where ESFs may be assigned, they coordinate closely with one another to accomplish their missions.\n\nMission Assignments: Federal agencies may provide disaster assistance under their own authorities or through mission assignments from FEMA, authorized by the Stafford Act.\n\nFEMA issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster. Mission assignments allow for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources to support disaster needs.\n\nState Emergency Management Agencies: During emergencies, each state coordinates the activation and use of resources needed to support the local governments to respond and recover from emergency and disasters.\n\nNational Response Framework guides how the nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies.\n\nTop Commodities Procured for Disasters\n\nBefore starting the process to become a contractor with FEMA after a local disaster, review our list of most needed items to find areas where you can make the biggest impact. For more information, send an email with “CUSI Information Request” in the subject line to the FEMA Industry Liaison Program. A program representative will respond if there is a potential basis to do business.\n\n4. Monitor Contracting Opportunity Sites\n\nContract opportunities are available on sam.gov for people who make, receive and manage federal awards. This is where organizations within the federal government publish notices on proposed contract actions valued at more than $25,000. Direct all questions to the Federal Service Desk at 1-866-606-8220.\n\nFedBid is now Unison Marketplace, a fully managed online marketplace connecting sellers to federal and commercial opportunities. Direct all questions to (877-933-3243) or their customer support form.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Planning Forecast System is a portal for small business vendors to view anticipated contract actions above $250,000.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nSubmit Capabilities or Request a Meeting\n\nYou can inform FEMA of your company's capabilities, or request a meeting with a FEMA representative, by submitting a Vendor Profile Form. There is no cost associated with submitting a Vendor Profile Form.\n\nPlease Note\n\nThe form is used to assist in secondary market research and is voluntary. Information supplied should not be proprietary or sensitive in nature.\n\nSubmission of the vendor profile form does not:\n\nPlace you on a preferred list of vendors to be considered for procurements; FEMA does not maintain such a list.\n\nGuarantee contract award. Please continue to monitor contracting opportunity sites.\n\nGuarantee meeting with FEMA Representatives.\n\nContact"
