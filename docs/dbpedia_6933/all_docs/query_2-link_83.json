Get business insights on the latest tech innovations, market trends, and your competitors with data-driven research.\n\nAcross industries, digital transformation is democratizing data to enable greater transparency and better customer experiences. New technologies are opening up legacy systems to emerging startups and third parties and, in some cases, putting data directly in the hands of consumers.\n\nIn financial services, Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms have surfaced as a key component of open banking, in which firms provide more financial transparency options for account holders by opening their application programming interfaces (APIs) for third parties to develop new services.\n\nFintechs and digital banks have been encroaching on incumbent institutions in the banking game and disrupting traditional business models — but by moving into the BaaS space, tech-savvy legacy banks can turn this looming threat into an opportunity.\n\nWhat is banking-as-a-service?\n\nBaaS is an end-to-end model that allows digital banks and other third parties to connect with banks’ systems directly via APIs so they can build banking offerings on top of the providers’ regulated infrastructure, as well as unlock the open banking opportunity reshaping the global financial services landscape.\n\nTech-savvy legacy firms can fend off the encroaching threat of fintechs by moving into the BaaS space to share their data and infrastructure. In a matter of years, access to this level of information will become table stakes for digitally native customers — so banks that begin now will be ahead of the curve, and likely rewarded with high demand.\n\nHow does banking-as-a-service work?\n\nThe BaaS model begins with a fintech, digital bank, or other third-party provider (TPP) paying a fee to access the BaaS platform. The financial institution opens its APIs to the TPP, thereby granting access to the systems and information necessary to build new banking products or offer white label banking services.\n\nIn addition to getting ahead in open banking, legacy institutions that launch their own BaaS platforms are also opening up new revenue streams. The two main monetization strategies for BaaS include charging clients a monthly fee for access to the BaaS platform or charging a la carte for each service used.\n\nLike what you’re reading?
