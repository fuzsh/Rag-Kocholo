        "text": "What are the benefits of an SLA?\n\nSLAs offer numerous benefits, including:\n\nAccountability: An SLA establishes responsibilities and obligations for both parties in the relationship, thereby ensuring accountability.\n\nClarity of expectations: By spelling out agreed-on services, performance levels, and metrics for validating service levels, SLAs ensure customers can expect a specified level of service, or have remediation possibilities should the service fail to meet obligations, and provide clarity to vendors as to what is expected of them.\n\nConflict resolution: By providing a framework for remediating issues, SLAs provide predefined processes for addressing disruptions in ways that can help circumvent conflict between parties as issues arise.\n\nCustomer experience: SLA benchmarks help ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nLegal protection: The contractual nature of SLAs provides legal protection for both parties by outlining conditions, processes for mitigating disputes, and clear responsibilities and expectations for both parties.\n\nWhat are the different types of SLAs?\n\nThere are several types of SLAs that clients and vendors can choose from to base their relationship, including:\n\nCustomer-based SLA, in which the SLA is tailored to meet the needs of a specific customer, including metrics relevant to the customer’s requirements.\n\nService-based SLA, which focuses on a specific service provided to a range of customer, defining levels of service for that offering.\n\nOperational SLA, which defines performance related to daily service operations such as uptime and maintenance scheduling.\n\nMulti-level SLA, which includes a variety of layers to address a customer’s requirements, potentially blending customer-based aspects and service-based aspects.\n\nWhat are key components of an SLA?\n\nThe SLA should include components in two areas: services and management.\n\nWhat kind of metrics should be monitored?\n\nThe types of SLA metrics required will depend on the services being provided. Many items can be monitored as part of an SLA, but the scheme should be kept as simple as possible to avoid confusion and excessive cost on either side. In choosing metrics, examine your operation and decide what is most important. The more complex the monitoring (and associated remedy) scheme, the less likely it is to be effective, since no one will have time to properly analyze the data. When in doubt, opt for ease of collection of metric data; automated systems are best, since it is unlikely that costly manual collection of metrics will be reliable.\n\nDepending on the service, the types of metric to monitor may include:\n\nService availability: the amount of time the service is available for use. This may be measured by time slot, with, for example, 99.5 percent availability required between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and more or less availability specified during other times. E-commerce operations typically have extremely aggressive SLAs at all times; 99.999 percent uptime is a not uncommon requirement for a site that generates millions of dollars an hour.\n\nDefect rates: Counts or percentages of errors in major deliverables. Production failures such as incomplete backups and restores, coding errors/rework, and missed deadlines may be included in this category.\n\nTechnical quality: in outsourced application development, measurement of technical quality by commercial analysis tools that examine factors such as program size and coding defects.\n\nSecurity: In these hyper-regulated times, application and network security breaches can be costly. Measuring controllable security measures such as anti-virus updates and patching is key in proving all reasonable preventive measures were taken, in the event of an incident.\n\nBusiness results: Increasingly, IT customers would like to incorporate business process metrics into their SLAs. Using existing key performance indicators is typically the best approach as long as the vendor’s contribution to those KPIs can be calculated.\n\nWhat should I consider when selecting metrics for my SLA?\n\nThe goal should be an equitable incorporation of best practices and requirements that will maintain service performance and avoid additional costs.\n\nChoose measurements that motivate the right behavior. The first goal of any metric is to motivate the appropriate behavior on behalf of the client and the service provider. Each side of the relationship will attempt to optimize its actions to meet the performance objectives defined by the metrics. First, focus on the behavior that you want to motivate. Then, test your metrics by putting yourself in the place of the other side. How would you optimize your performance? Does that optimization support the originally desired results?\n\nEnsure that metrics reflect factors within the service provider’s control. To motivate the right behavior, SLA metrics should reflect factors within the outsourcer’s control. A typical mistake is to penalize the service provider for delays caused by the client’s lack of performance. For example, if the client provides change specifications for application code several weeks late, it is unfair and demotivating to hold the service provider to a pre-specified delivery date. Making the SLA two-sided by measuring the client’s performance on mutually dependent actions is a good way to focus on the intended results.\n\nChoose measurements that are easily collected. Balance the power of a desired metric against its ease of collection. Ideally, the SLA metrics will be captured automatically, in the background, with minimal overhead, but this objective may not be possible for all desired metrics. When in doubt, compromise in favor of easy collection; no one is going to invest the effort to collect metrics manually.\n\nLess is more. Despite the temptation to control as many factors as possible, avoid choosing an excessive number of metrics or metrics that produce a voluminous amount of data that no one will have time to analyze and create excessive overhead. While less likely, too few metrics are also a problem as missing any one may mean the provide has breached the contract.\n\nSet a proper baseline. Defining the right metrics is only half of the battle. To be useful, the metrics must be set to reasonable, attainable performance levels. Unless strong historical measurement data is available, be prepared to revisit and readjust the settings at a future date through a predefined process specified in the SLA.\n\nDefine with care. A provider may tweak SLA definitions to ensure they are met. For example, the Incident Response Time metric is supposed to ensure that the provider addresses an incident within a minimum number of minutes. However, some providers may meet the SLA 100 percent of the time by delivering an automated reply to an incident report. Customers should define SLAs clearly so that they represent the intention of the service level.\n\nIn addition to defining the services to be provided, the contract should also document how the services are to be monitored, including how the data will be captured and reported, how often it will be reviewed, and who is involved in the review.\n\nWhat common SLA mistakes do customers make?\n\nBeing diligent about service-level agreements (SLAs) has always been important for IT organizations working with IT service and cloud providers. But understanding how to negotiate, structure, manage, measure, and report on these metrics is more crucial than ever. Nonetheless, there remain some common — and potentially costly — SLA mistakes IT leaders can make, including:\n\nFailure to agree on and establish SLAs up front\n\nAn overabundance of SLAs\n\nNot understanding the provider’s point of view\n\nLack of clarity around SLA calculations\n\nViewing SLAs as a one-time exercise\n\nFor more on these mistakes and others, see “15 SLA mistakes IT leaders still make.”\n\nIs there room for negotiation on SLAs with cloud service providers?\n\nCloud vendors are more reticent about modifying their standard SLAs because their margins are predicated on providing commodity services to many buyers. However, in some cases, customers are able to negotiate terms with their cloud providers."
