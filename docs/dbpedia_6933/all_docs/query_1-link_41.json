        "text": "Your organization can integrate artificial intelligence capabilities to optimize business processes, improve customer experiences, and accelerate innovation.\n\nAutomate intelligently\n\nOrganizations have been automating digital processes for some time now. However, artificial intelligence introduces a new level of depth and problem-solving ability to the process. For example, an invoice processing system powered by AI technologies can automatically scan and record invoice data from any invoice template. It can also classify invoices based on various criteria, such as supplier, geography, department, and more. It can even check for errors and process payments with minimal oversight.\n\nBoost productivity\n\nKnowledge workers often perform tasks related to searching and discovering critical information. For example, healthcare workers look up patient records, hospital policies, and medicine databases, and airline workers look up flight information. Time spent finding and consolidating information from various sources distracts employees from their primary role. AI technologies can provide consolidated and summarized information in context and on time. Intelligent search and discovery functions powered by artificial intelligence can boost employee satisfaction and productivity in any industry. For example, Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, built an AI system to assist employees, enhancing productivity and satisfaction.\n\nSolve complex problems\n\nMany industries grapple with complex problems that require analyzing millions of past transactions and discovering hidden patterns—for example, fraud detection, machinery maintenance, and product innovation. AI systems can collect and analyze data at scale from various sources to support complex human decision-making. For example, answering when a particular mechanical component should be repaired requires analyzing machine data like temperature and speed alongside usage reports and past maintenance schedules. Artificial intelligence can take all this data, discover hidden connections, and suggest optimal maintenance schedules for significant cost savings. Similarly, it can support more complex fields like genomic research and drug discovery.\n\nCreate new customer experiences\n\nOrganizations use artificial intelligence to create customized customer experiences with greater security and speed. For example, AI systems can combine customer profile data, such as preferences and digital behavior, with other product or service data to create personalized reports, recommendations, and action plans. Customers can find real-time answers to questions or discover new products and services without waiting for live customer support. For example, Lonely Planet used artificial intelligence to generate curated travel itineraries for customers while cutting itinerary generation costs by 80%.\n\nFind more AI use cases and benefits »\n\nArtificial intelligence has a wide range of applications.

They reached an 8 percent increase in forecasting accuracy, leading to $533,000 in annual savings in their factories. They also use business analytics to reduce wasted labor and increase customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for different strategies and techniques for making machines more human-like. It includes everything from self-driving cars to robotic vacuum cleaners and smart assistants like Alexa. While machine learning and deep learning both fall under the AI umbrella, not all AI activities are machine learning and deep learning. For example, generative AI, which demonstrates human-like creative capabilities, is a very advanced form of deep learning.\n\nMachine learning\n\nWhile you may see the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning being used interchangeably in many places, machine learning is technically one among many other branches of artificial intelligence. It is the science of developing algorithms and statistical models to correlate data. Computer systems use machine learning algorithms to process large quantities of historical data and identify data patterns. In the current context, machine learning refers to a set of statistical techniques called machine learning models that you can use independently or to support other more complex AI techniques.\n\nRead about machine learning »\n\nRead about AI vs. machine learning »\n\nDeep learning\n\nDeep learning takes machine learning one step further. Deep learning models use neural networks that work together to learn and process information. They comprise millions of software components that perform micro mathematical operations on small data units to solve a larger problem. For example, they process individual pixels in an image to classify that image. Modern AI systems often combine multiple deep neural networks to perform complex tasks like writing poems or creating images from text prompts.\n\nRead about deep learning »\n\nArtificial intelligence technology has become increasingly popular due to generative AI tools gaining prominence in the public space. However, the technology has been around for several decades now and is continuously maturing. In his seminal paper from 1950, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" Alan Turing considered whether machines could think. In this paper, Turing first coined the term artificial intelligence and presented it as a theoretical and philosophical concept.\n\nThe past\n\nBetween 1957 and 1974, developments in computing allowed computers to store more data and process faster. During this period, scientists further developed machine learning (ML) algorithms. The progress in the field led agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to create a fund for AI research. At first, the main goal of this research was to discover whether computers could transcribe and translate spoken language.\n\nThrough the 1980s, the boosted funding available and the expanding algorithmic toolkit scientists used in AI streamlined development. David Rumelhart and John Hopfield published papers on deep learning techniques, which showed that computers could learn from experience.\n\nFrom 1990 to the early 2000s, scientists achieved many core goals of AI, like beating the reigning world chess champion.\n\nThe present\n\nPresent-day artificial intelligence primarily uses foundation models and large language models to perform complex digital tasks. Foundation models are deep learning models trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. Based on input prompts, they can perform a wide range of disparate tasks with a high degree of accuracy. Organizations typically take existing, pre-trained foundation models and customize them with internal data to add AI capabilities to existing applications or create new AI applications.\n\nIt is important to note that many organizations continue using machine learning models for many digital tasks. Machine learning models can outperform foundation models for many use cases. Artificial intelligence developers can flexibly pick and choose the best models for specific tasks.\n\nRead more about foundation models »\n\nThe future\n\nWith more computing data and processing power in the modern age than in previous decades, AI research is now more common and accessible. It's rapidly evolving into artificial general intelligence. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a field of theoretical AI research that attempts to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach. The aim is for the software to be able to perform tasks for which it is not necessarily trained or developed.\n\nCurrent artificial intelligence technologies all function within a set of pre-determined parameters. For example, AI models trained in image recognition and generation cannot build websites. AGI is a theoretical pursuit to develop AI systems with autonomous self-control, reasonable self-understanding, and the ability to learn new skills. It can solve complex problems in settings and contexts that were not taught to it at the time of its creation. AGI with human abilities remains a theoretical concept and research goal.\n\nRead more about artificial general intelligence »\n\nArtificial intelligence systems use a range of technologies to work. The specifics vary, but core principles remain the same: they convert all data types, such as text, images, videos, and audio, into numerical representations and mathematically identify patterns and relationships between them. Hence, artificial intelligence technologies require training - they are exposed to large volumes of existing datasets to \"learn\" — similar to humans learning from existing knowledge archives.\n\nSome of the technologies that make artificial intelligence work are given below.\n\nNeural networks\n\nArtificial neural networks form the core of artificial intelligence technologies. They mirror the processing that happens in the human brain. A brain contains millions of neurons that process and analyze information. An artificial neural network uses artificial neurons that process information together. Each artificial neuron, or node, uses mathematical calculations to process information and solve complex problems.\n\nRead about neural networks »\n\nNatural language processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) uses neural networks to interpret, understand, and gather meaning from text data. It uses various computing techniques that specialize in decoding and comprehending human language. These techniques allow machines to process words, grammar syntax, and word combinations to process human text and even generate new text. Natural language processing is critical in tasks like summarizing documents, chatbots, and conducting sentiment analysis.\n\nRead about NLP »\n\nComputer vision\n\nComputer vision uses deep learning techniques to extract information and insights from videos and images. Using computer vision, a computer can understand images just like a human would. You can use it to monitor online content for inappropriate images, recognize faces, and classify image details. It is critical in self-driving cars and trucks to monitor the environment and make split-second decisions.\n\nRead about computer vision »\n\nSpeech recognition\n\nSpeech recognition software uses deep learning models to interpret human speech, identify words, and detect meaning. The neural networks can transcribe speech to text and indicate vocal sentiment. You can use speech recognition in technologies like virtual assistants and call center software to identify meaning and perform related tasks.\n\nRead about speech-to-text»\n\nGenerative AI\n\nGenerative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content and artifacts such as images, videos, text, and audio from simple text prompts. Unlike past AI, which was limited to analyzing data, generative AI leverages deep learning and massive datasets to produce high-quality, human-like creative outputs. While enabling exciting creative applications, concerns around bias, harmful content, and intellectual property exist. Overall, generative AI represents a major evolution in AI capabilities to generate human language and new content and artifacts in a human-like manner.\n\nRead about generative AI »"
