        "text": "Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing: NAICS 335\n\nAbout the Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing subsector\n\nThe electrical equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing subsector is part of the manufacturing sector.\n\nIndustries in the Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing subsector manufacture products that generate, distribute and use electrical power. Electric Lighting Equipment Manufacturing establishments produce electric lamp bulbs, lighting fixtures, and parts. Household Appliance Manufacturing establishments make both small and major electrical appliances and parts. Electrical Equipment Manufacturing establishments make goods, such as electric motors, generators, transformers, and switchgear apparatus. Other Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing establishments make devices for storing electrical power (e.g., batteries), for transmitting electricity (e.g., insulated wire), and wiring devices (e.g., electrical outlets, fuse boxes, and light switches).\n\nNorth American Industry Classification System\n\nThe electrical equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing subsector consists of these industry groups:\n\nElectric Lighting Equipment Manufacturing: NAICS 3351\n\nHousehold Appliance Manufacturing: NAICS 3352\n\nElectrical Equipment Manufacturing: NAICS 3353\n\nOther Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing: NAICS 3359\n\nWorkforce Statistics\n\nThis section provides information relating to employment and unemployment in electrical equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing. While most data are obtained from employer or establishment surveys, information on industry unemployment comes from a national survey of households. The following tables present an overview of the industry including the number of jobs, the unemployment rate of those previously employed in the industry, data for occupations common to the industry, and projections of occupational employment change.\n\nEmployment and Unemployment\n\nData series Back\n\ndata Apr.\n\n2024 May\n\n2024 Jun.\n\n2024 Jul.\n\n2024\n\nEmployment (in thousands)\n\nEmployment, all employees (seasonally adjusted)\n\n412.2 410.2 408.0 407.7\n\nEmployment, production and nonsupervisory employees (seasonally adjusted)\n\n267.7 265.4 264.5 264.1\n\nUnemployment\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n1.8% 3.4% 7.4% 3.5%\n\n(Source: Current Employment Statistics, Current Population Survey\n\nEmployment by Occupation\n\nData series Employment,\n\n2023\n\nCoil winders, tapers, and finishers\n\n4,570\n\nCutting, punching, and press machine setters, operators, and tenders, metal and plastic\n\n3,510\n\nElectrical and electronic equipment assemblers\n\n67,380\n\nFirst-line supervisors/managers of production and operating workers\n\n14,360\n\nInspectors, testers, sorters, samplers, and weighers\n\n13,320\n\nTeam assemblers\n\n51,450\n\n(Source: Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics)\n\nProjections\n\nFor projected (future) employment estimates, see the National Employment Matrix, which includes employment estimates by industry and occupation for electrical equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing.\n\n(Source: Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections)\n\nEarnings and Hours\n\nThis section presents data on employee earnings and weekly hours.
