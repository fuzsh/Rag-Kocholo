        "text": "Companies From Across the Industry are Contributing Market-Proven Technologies and Best Practices\n\nMatter is built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), Matter will enable communication across smart home devices, mobile app, and cloud services, and define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.\n\nAn open-source approach\n\nMembers of the Alliance have taken an open-source approach to the development and implementation of this new, unified connectivity protocol. We use best-in-class contributions from market-tested smart home technologies, such as those from Amazon, Apple, Google, the Connectivity Standards Alliance, and others. By leveraging these technologies’ contributions, we are able to accelerate the development of the protocol and deliver benefits to manufacturers and consumers faster.\n\nIP-Based\n\nMatter makes it easier for device manufacturers to build devices that are compatible with smart home and voice services such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and others. The first specification release of the Matter protocol will run on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and will use Bluetooth Low Energy for commissioning."
