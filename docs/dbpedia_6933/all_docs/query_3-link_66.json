        "text": "Recently, a relevant wave of change has been fostered by the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR), or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 has been defined as ‘a new industrial maturity stage based on the connectivity provided by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the use of several digital technologies such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence’ (Benitez et al. 2020). As mentioned in this definition, this change is based on the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) concepts into manufacturing companies, leading to vertically and horizontally integrated production systems (Thoben et al. 2017). The alignment with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, characterised by ‘smartness’ and ‘networking’ (Kagermann et al. 2013), is a crucial topic for many companies that want to stay ahead in today’s volatile and competitive market.\n\nThe literature has underlined possible advantages related to the introduction of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and the shift to ‘intelligent manufacturing,’ including cheap and ubiquitous sensors with high computational speeds (Gershwin 2018). Although most of them have been predicted a priori and not observed ex-post (Hermann et al. 2015), the opportunities, as well as the challenges, associated with such a transition are many. It has been declared that Industry 4.0 has a relevant impact on the implementation of PSS business models (Thoben et al. 2017).\n\nSpecifically, the literature explored the role of different technologies in the PSS scenario. Digital technologies are described as a crucial factor in assisting companies in their journey towards a service-based business (Neu and Brown 2005; Geum et al. 2011a), facilitating vertical and horizontal information sharing across the service network (Auramo and Ala-risku 2005; Martinez et al. 2010). Cavalieri et al. (2017) highlight that the advent of the Internet of Things can also be considered a further enabler for manufacturers to develop new services since it changes the way hardware is ‘sold’ to the market thanks to the opportunities offered by connected products and assets.\n\nHartmann et al. (2016) and Ardolino et al. (2017) study the great potential that the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing (CC) and predictive analytics (PA) offer to enable novel product-service offerings based on the transformation of data into information and knowledge. They stress how the digitalisation of products and services, as well as the digital connectivity between components and the combination of data from certain domains, could play a significant role in achieving the utility and performance related to product usage, the fundamental concept of PSS.\n\nBochmann et al. (2015) and Thoben et al. (2017) focus their attention on additive manufacturing, highlighting the benefits that can be brought to the fore by the possibility of fulfilling individual customer requirements with product variants in a very small lot size, down to one-off items. This may have a high potential for supporting PSS customisation and adaptation. For example, additive manufacturing supports the production of highly customised products in single batches with low resource waste in terms of material and energy, allowing quick and easy prototyping of the proposed solutions that favour PSS customisation. Strozzi et al. (2017) describe the possibility of customising the PSS solution through the availability of real-time information and through the reconfigurability of production, which in the Era of Industry 4.0 can be achieved at the same cost-efficiency level as mass-production. For instance, cloud platforms and data sharing are crucial for supporting co-design and the increasing demand for customised product-service solutions as well (Marilungo et al. 2017). Mourtzis et al. (2018) also stress the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in developing highly customised PSSs and hence increasing the overall system complexity.\n\nOther researchers have deeply explored the advantages that new technologies can have in spurring horizontal integration among companies. Ben-Daya et al. (2017) highlight how the new technologies could support firms in integrating into a single supply chain to promptly respond to changes by enhancing effective internal operations and collaborations. Liu and Xu (2016) also see these technologies as the next stage of value chain organisation and management since Industry 4.0 will empower the monitoring and analysis of data across all stakeholders. For example, in-the-cloud data analytics favour the transition from a transactional to a relational approach to customers, since the interactions among stakeholders are more efficient. The supplier–customer relationship can also gain advantages in having direct supervision over the performance of the delivered product-service solutions, hence improving their offering based on the customers’ use, but the documentation available in the literature is scarce.\n\nFinally, some works report the role that technologies can play concerning the PSS infrastructure. The identification of proper technological infrastructure to embrace a specific evolutionary path towards ‘servitization’ is challenging (Ardolino et al. 2017; Grubic and Jennions 2017). As reported by Geum et al. (2011a, b), three different types of technologies can be adopted within PSS: (i) ‘enabler technologies’ allow the direct integration of product and services by embedding the technology into the product (e.g. sensors or actuators), (ii) ‘mediator technologies’ are already in a product or service and apply to servitization and (iii) ‘facilitator technologies’ ease the problem solving for additional servitization.\n\nThis overview of the literature highlights that a comprehensive set of research on the topic of PSS and Industry 4.0 is still lacking and that the transition from ‘well-being based on the product’ to ‘well-being based on the access to the product’ (Sakao et al. 2009) has not yet been explored and described. As a result, it can be stated that, apart from some specific work that explores certain topics of Industry 4.0 concerning the PSS concept, it is not yet clear how the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies would impact the overall PSS scenario. In other words, ‘How would the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies influence the PSS paradigm?’ ‘How would the PSS business model and value proposition change?’ ‘What would be the main benefits? And what are the main challenges to be faced into this new scenario?’ In line with this, ‘What would be the main research areas to be explored to deepen this topic?’ Hence, as a starting point to spur the discussion and develop a new PSS research stream, this paper relies on the expertise of international researchers to determine the main forces driving the future development of technology-driven PSS (Table 1).\n\nThis section includes a detailed description of the outcomes of the focus group. It includes the four main drivers, or ‘trajectories’, which, according to the experts’ opinions, would represent PSS evolution in light of the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies.\n\nThe aim is to point out the main trajectories of the PSS ecosystem in the context of new industry trends, such as the demand for customised products, the rise of servitization, rapid technological changes combined with a highly competitive market, digitalisation of the economy, and production automation. The four main PSS evolution dimensions, with their corresponding continuum, are (1) value offerings manifestations, (2) customer value experience, (3) value creation mechanism, and (4) value creation interactions. Figure 3 reports the four dimensions and the steps that characterise their continuum. As can be observed, for each continuum, four different steps have been identified. Three of them represent previous or current configurations, whereas the last one constitutes the future step that, according to the focus group experts, can be foreseen. This ‘future configuration’ is the contribution of the experts and represents the starting point for defining future research topics and agendas.\n\nAccording to the experts, the future configurations of the four dimensions represent the innovative concept towards which each company could evolve in the future. It represents the possible configuration enabled by the introduction of new technologies. However, all the focus group participants agreed on the fact that in a future configuration, each company can freely decide what step (or configuration) of each continuum to adopt. In other words, the best option for a company is not the selection of the four future configurations at the same time (i.e. ‘full-value solution’, ‘evolutionist’, ‘technology based on market standards’ and ‘symbiotic relationship’). For example, a company can decide to establish a symbiotic relationship with other partners inside the ecosystem but decide to sell a single product or service instead of a full-value solution.\n\n6.1 Dimension I: value offerings manifestations\n\nAs previously hinted, the group discussion of the focus group highlighted the relevance of new technologies in enabling new PSS offerings or solutions. The provision of bundles of products and services for customer satisfaction is generally referred to as the first distinguishing feature of a PSS, as reported in many definitions available in the literature (Goedkoop et al. 1999; Manzini and Vezzoli 2003; Mont 2002; Tan et al. 2009). This new solution pursues a new strategy while delivering ‘value-in-use’ (Baines and Lightfoot 2014) or a ‘required functionality’ since ‘…instead of the product itself, the activity, its utility and performance associated with the use of the product are considered to be of more value to the customer’ (Tan et al. 2009).\n\nIn such a context, a value offering or value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered, communicated and acknowledged by the customer, while the value of an offering or proposition is defined as the measure of the satisfaction and benefits received by a customer from acquiring or consuming (i.e. value-in-exchange) and experiencing (i.e. value-in-use) a product, a service or a bundle of both. Value-added creation is the process of creating a positive difference or gain for the customer between his or her current solution for a need and the new value proposition offered by a company, which better responds to such need.\n\nThe focus group shed light on the changes in the value-added creation systems and therefore identified the value-offerings manifestation continuum through which manufacturing companies would evolve: from (a) being pure manufacturers of product or services, to (b) offering complementary services for their products (i.e. after-sale services), to (c) offering product-service bundles (i.e. product-service systems), to (d) aiming to deliver full-value solutions. The role of technology in supporting this shift is of utmost relevance. The focus group agreed that digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing (CC), and predictive analytics (PA) offer great potential to enable novel product-service offerings based on the transformation of data into information and knowledge (Hartmann et al. 2016; Ardolino et al. 2017). Moreover, the digitalisation of products and services as the digital connectivity between components and the combination of data from certain domains plays a significant role in achieving the utility and performance related to product usage, the PSS fundamental concept. Table 4 reports the phases of the value-offering manifestation continuum and their descriptions.\n\n6.2 Dimension II: customer value experience\n\nConsistent with recent literature that has emphasised how the PSS value offering can be designed to allow an increased level of quality (Vezzoli et al. 2017; Song and Sakao 2017), personalisation of solutions is another relevant dimension of the PSS evolution identified by the focus group. In particular, discussion among focus group participants has underlined how much, as shown by Aurich et al. (2006), the little capital-intensive character of services offers high customisation potentials, supporting flexible adaptation according to individual product usage. The service component, being flexible, can deliver new functionality to suit customer needs (Baines et al. 2007). Moreover, the combination of products and services can be appropriately matched to satisfy specific necessities (Long et al. 2016), though this topic is still under debate, as a systematic approach to properly combine products and services remains missing (Song and Sakao 2017).\n\nAfter agreeing that from a value creation tailoring customer perspective, customer value experience can be seen as the degree to which a value offering has been particularised for a specific customer need(s), participants in the focus group converged towards the customer-value experience continuum reported in Table 5. It starts with ‘mass-production’, where goods and services are standardised commodities produced or offered through large-scale manufacturing or service systems. It then continues with mass-customised value propositions (i.e. modularisation), which represents the first advancement, since a limited number of variants are proposed to customers. The third step is constituted by personalised value propositions (i.e. individualisation). It represents the latest advancement in place and is currently available. It consists of a complete restructuring of the solution to make it completely aligned with the customer’s features and requirements.\n\nHere, Industry 4.0 technologies and concepts may have great potential in supporting PSS customisation and adaptation, fulfilling individual customer requirements with product variants in a very small lot size, down to one-off items (Bochmann et al. 2015; Thoben et al. 2017). For example, additive manufacturing supports the production of highly customised products in single batches with low resource waste in terms of material and energy, allowing quick and easy prototyping of the proposed solutions that favour PSS customisation. Moreover, the possibility for customising the PSS solution can be further enabled by the availability of real-time information and by the reconfigurability of production, which in the era of Industry 4.0 can be achieved at the same cost-efficiency level as mass-production (Strozzi et al. 2017). In line with this, many companies are offering co-design or participatory approaches that help them in developing flexible innovative solutions that could match multiple customer requirements. In particular, cloud platforms and data sharing are crucial for supporting co-design and the increasing demand for customised product-service solutions as well.\n\nAccording to the focus group experts, the introduction of the new technologies can further exacerbate the customer-value experience continuum. More than being completely tailored to customer requirements, new solutions (or PSS) could be designed to adapt during their use and to accommodate evolving customer needs. According to the experts’ opinions, products and services could become intelligent, proactive entities (Wuest et al. 2018) that monitor customers’ changing needs and usage and modify themselves to comply with them.\n\n6.3 Dimension III: technological capabilities for value creation\n\nRecent studies have stressed the relevance of technology in supporting the integration of products and services and guiding the evolution towards ‘system management’ (Park et al. 2012). By definition, PSS infrastructure is the area where technologies and digitalisation can have the most impact. Indeed, as underlined by some studies, the identification of proper technological infrastructure to embrace a specific evolutionary path towards servitization is challenging (Ardolino et al. 2017; Grubic and Jennions 2017). In particular, one key element that could influence how PSS evolves is the way new Industry 4.0 technologies can be appropriately incorporated into PSS infrastructure as a positive means to improve and differentiate a company’s offerings. However, how technology can support the integration of products and services into unique PSS business models is still under analysis (Bertoni and Larsson 2017), and the further potential enabled by Industry 4.0 needs to be studied.\n\nFrom this perspective, according to the focus group participants, to create and deliver value for the customer, manifested as products, services and product-service bundles, the value provider (e.g. the Original Equipment Manufacturer—OEM) should develop and implement new capabilities related to the adoption, use and management of key technologies in any stage of the lifecycle, as reported in Table 6. The first step analysed in this continuum is the ‘basic case’, in which every single actor is developing and using its own technological capabilities without sharing any kind of knowledge. A step further is the sharing of information between a few actors. In this case, one actor (usually the OEM) develops technological capabilities and invites selected and certified service providers to its value chain to use such capabilities.\n\nHere, the adoption of technology-based infrastructures such as those based on smart devices (i.e. RFID tags, sensors, actuators), human–computer interfaces and computational models can be of relevance in supporting the relationship between the tangible product and service delivery process. In this case, the sharing of information between the OEM and service provider is meant to enhance the potentiality of products for the customers (i.e. after-sale services), as smart infrastructures enable better exchange of knowledge among the actors of the network throughout the product-service lifecycle.\n\nFurther improvement of such a model includes the case in which the technology is owned and controlled by the OEM, but any actor, by using its capabilities based on OEM’s technology, can eventually develop and provide authorised services for the OEM’s products to the customers after the OEM’s approval (i.e. product-service bundles). The future frontier in this context is represented by the situation in which all the value chain actors can share information since they all adopt technologies based on market standards and interoperability protocols, and these develop their capabilities.\n\nUbiquitous and pervasive computing permits the interaction and coordination between things (objects) produced by different actors to reach computational modelling of previously disconnected systems, allowing the delivery of solutions based on an open contest of technology and interaction. Moreover, IoT enables real-time data acquisition from sensors and actuators in various manufacturing facilities and fields and subsequent analyses that facilitate the dynamic fulfilment of customer demands (Thoben et al. 2017).\n\nThe aim is to insert their new value offerings (i.e. single products or single services, or product-service bundles) into a more extensive open system (i.e. a meta-ecosystem of product-service systems) to offer the ultimate and full-value solution for a customer segment within the target market.\n\n6.4 Dimension IV: value creation interactions\n\nA differentiating feature of PSS stressed by many definitions refers to the concepts of a ‘network of players’ (Goedkoop et al. 1999) and ‘network’ (Mont 2002) required to pursue a ‘system’ integration. As companies shift from pure transactions to relational engagements, assuming operational responsibilities for customers’ processes, the interactions with the customers intensify along with their engagement in value co-creation processes (Nordin et al. 2011; Benedettini et al. 2015; Baines et al. 2017). Moreover, a single organisation is rarely able to solely provide a comprehensive PSS value offering (Sakao et al. 2009), so the engagement of several partners within the upstream and downstream value chain emerges as crucial (Bikfalvi et al. 2013; Sakao et al. 2013; Selviaridis and Norrman 2014). In turn, this potentially raises the likelihood of conflicts, disagreements and opportunistic behaviour with both customers (Richter et al. 2010; Kindström 2010) and collaborating partners, mainly because they are characterised by diverse organisational features, positions in the value chain and incentive models (Meier et al. 2011; Lockett et al. 2011). Parida et al. (2013) further show that as partnering organisations are often globally distributed, additional relational issues may arise, negatively influencing the likelihood of ‘win–win’ collaboration between PSS providers and their global value-chain delivery organisations.\n\nBased on these premises, value creation interaction can be defined as the collaborative form among the stakeholders of a product system, service system, product-service system or solution system. In other words, it represents their risk and revenue-sharing model in the context of a business model supporting determined value creation and delivery mechanisms. The experts from the focus group identified four collaborative forms that can evolve in a value creation interactions continuum. ‘Transactional relationships’ represent the basic type of relationship in which stakeholders (i.e. supplier → OEM → customer) share risks and revenues in individual transactions, as reported in Table 7. The ‘contractual relationships’ were also mentioned by the experts in the focus group. This kind of relationship is agreed upfront in order to provide boundaries for risk and revenue sharing between a defined hierarchy of stakeholders in a collaborative value chain, where transactions are conducted based on these agreements (i.e. contracts).\n\nWith respect to these requirements of collaboration and networking, the new technologies brought by Industry 4.0 can carry some advantages since they spur horizontal integration among the companies. They also enable firms into a single supply chain to respond promptly to changes by enhancing effective internal operations and collaborations (Ben-Daya et al. 2017; Schuh et al. 2014). The third case is the case of ‘shared relationships’ that takes place in non-hierarchical networks of stakeholders, where risks and revenues are eventually distributed among the stakeholders. Here, as the next stage of value chain organisation and management (Liu and Xu 2016), Industry 4.0 technologies empower the monitoring and analysis of data across all groups of stakeholders. For example, in-the-cloud data analytics favour the transition from a transactional to a relational approach to customers, since the interactions among stakeholders are eased. The suppliers can also gain advantages in having direct supervision over the performance of the delivered product-service solutions, hence improving their offering based on the customers’ use.\n\nRegarding this continuum, the ‘symbiotic relationships’ represents the innovative step. According to the experts, in this kind of relationship, stakeholders work in a networked value ecosystem, where all stakeholders can collaborate ‘on-the-fly’, through open platforms, to support the optimal configuration of the networked value ecosystem and to co-create full-value solutions.\n\nTo understand the validity of identified dimensions and related steps, possible combinations defining possible configurations have been investigated, and examples from the automotive sector have been reported. The objective is not to identify predefined configurations but to understand if the various dimensions were sufficient and clear in describing the peculiarities of past, present and future configurations. In particular, four configurations, reported in Fig. 4, have been investigated to explain the different combinations of drivers. The four configurations are not exhaustive and are not intended to give prescriptive indications with respect to the different configurations. They are only intended to exemplify the above dimensions and report how the dimensions can be used to describe companies’ positioning.\n\n7.1 PSS configuration I\n\nIn the first configuration, the OEM is creating and delivering a value proposition (i.e. a product or a service) individually to its customers. Usually, companies do not have planned collaboration agreements, but they have a transaction-based relationship characterised by a low level of integration. For instance, in the automotive industry, cars are sold on the market, and independent service providers would decide to enter the market and provide service along the product life cycle. The car manufacturer could interact with the service supplier in a transactional way by selling spare parts directly or through its authorised service network. No partnership and long-term collaborations are put in place. The technology developed and adopted by the various actors is not shared; any data collected are used by those who collected them (OEM or service provider) independently without any kind of sharing. Nowadays, this type of configuration does not represent the core business, but it persists in all sectors to cover the demand of niche markets.\n\n7.2 PSS configuration II\n\nThis second configuration is characterised by OEM inviting selected and certified service providers to its value chain to offer specific complementary services for its products for its customers (i.e. after-sale services). The main collaboration is focused on the exchange of relevant information along the product lifecycle to reactively support customer needs. This context is mainly characterised by an OEM (dominant partner), which drives decisions both in the area of product and service and from the strategic to the operational levels. Asymmetrical distribution of information and market position characterise such a configuration. This calls for matching customer demand and product and service supply more effectively by promising mutual benefit for all involved. Strategic partnerships between provider and supplier are often created in a one-to-one collaboration approach, and the OEM provides technological capabilities to the certified service network. In this configuration, the car is sold to the customer in a transactional way. Then, the car manufacturer establishes a network of certified service providers (official workshop network) to support customers along the car lifecycle by providing after-sale services. The workshops are in charge of providing the service as designed and certified by the manufacturer. The collaboration is based on a contract defining revenues stream and risk-sharing issues and on a predefined exchange of information, usually done through a Dealer Management System, contractually enforced by the OEM. The system is designed to manage and coordinate the activities of the car dealership network, including sales of new and used vehicles and service spare parts management. This is the most common configuration currently used in the car industry by all the brands.\n\n7.3 PSS configuration III\n\nThe third configuration can be represented by an ecosystem of actors formed and controlled by one specific OEM, which is generally the product provider. In this configuration, service providers are allowed to provide any service for the OEM’s products, and therefore customers, after the OEM approval. This kind of ecosystem is characterised by vanished borders between different organisations to improve transparency. The dominant company (i.e. the OEM) acts as a decision-maker concerning both product and services features that can be delivered to the final customer. In this perspective, the solution is orchestrated by the OEM since there is always control from one party’s perspective. In detail, the product acts as a platform, technologies are decided and developed by the OEM, and in the meantime, different service suppliers can develop services that are subject to the dominant company decision. This configuration is characterised by a ‘one-to-many’ relationship. A typical example is a car-sharing solution, where the car manufacturer designs a car and defines the mobility service for the customer. In this context, several actors develop and share technologies following the OEM standards to provide a personalised customer experience. Each service and technology implemented in the car (e.g. app reader) or for the use of the car (e.g. service repair network), or to enhance the customer experience within the car use (e.g. mobile apps for mobility), must be designed coherently with the car specifications and technology and must be approved by the car manufacturer. Examples of this type of configuration are Car2Go, the largest car-sharing worldwide service owned by Daimler, and the bike-sharing, provided by the famous Italian manufacturer Piaggio.\n\n7.4 PSS configuration IV\n\nAs long as companies in an ecosystem start collaborating with external companies and with competitors, interactions among multiple actors and interested parties increase. Such interaction pushes all involved actors to collaborate along with various value co-creation processes within a balanced customer-centricity. In this configuration, all the actors act as in a choreography in which all are willing to collaborate and no party has the overall control. This is a ‘many to many’ collaboration environment. This could represent the future where the car industry will operate, in which the car will be one of the players of a wider mobility system. Car manufacturers and service providers will collaborate with other mobility product providers and service suppliers to be able to improve passenger experience by making travel easier and more comfortable even across different modes of transportation. In this context, traditional and new players must cooperate to allow a constant evolution of mobility by incorporating new services and products. The adoption of common standards and protocols is essential to allow a comprehensive collaboration among all the actors interested. Deutsche Bahn Connect is the new integrated mobility service promoted by the German rail transport giant for individuals and companies."
