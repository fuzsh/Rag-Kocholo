        "text": "The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. It was developed to allow for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the three North American countries. NAICS is based on a production-oriented concept, meaning that it groups establishments into industries according to similarity in the processes used to produce goods or services.\n\nNAICS uses a hierarchical structure. A \"hierarchy\" is the relationship of one item to a particular category.\n\nThe organization of NAICS is as follows:\n\nSector: 2-digit code\n\nSubsector: 3-digit code\n\nIndustry Group: 4-digit code\n\nNAICS Industry: 5-digit code\n\nNational Industry: 6-digit code\n\nNote: Three sectors are represented by a range of 2-digit codes. These include Manufacturing (31-33), Retail Trade (44-45) and Transportation and Warehousing (48-49).\n\nExample\n\nLevel NAICS Code Title Sector 44-45 Retail Trade Subsector 441 Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealer Industry Group 4412 Other Motor Vehicle Dealers NAICS Industry 44122 Motorcycle, Boat, and Other Motor Vehicle Dealers National Industry 441222 Boat Dealers\n\nNote: Some Economic Census tables also display data at the 7- and 8-digit levels. Although these codes are NAICS-based codes, they are not included in the official classification system.\n\nThe economic census does not generally include government-owned establishments, even when their primary activity would be classified in industries covered by the economic census. Because of these exclusions, economic census data for industries in many sectors might appear to be incomplete.\n\nSector Illustrative Governmental Activities Excluded Utilities Public electric, gas, water and sewer utilities Construction Highway construction performed by government employees Retail Trade Post exchanges, ship stores and similar establishments operated on military posts by agencies of the federal government Transportation and Warehousing Publicly-operated buses and subway systems Information Public libraries Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services Municipal trash removal Health Care and Social Assistance Municipal ambulance services and County or city nursing care services Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation Public museums or zoos\n\nIn addition, certain industries dominated by government activity are excluded from the scope of the economic census.\n\nAt the same time, exceptions have been made to include certain governmental activities in the economic census:\n\nHospitals\n\nGovernment-owned liquor stores\n\nUniversity press publishers\n\nFederal Reserve Banks\n\nIn addition, the economic census does include the activities of private contractors that may be carrying out governmental functions on contract. For example:\n\nHighway construction contractors\n\nPrivately operated prisons\n\nPrivate firms contracting to provide services to government\n\nGovernment-owned/contractor-operated (GOCO) plants\n\nThere is a separate Census of Governments, which provides some data on revenue, expenditures, and employment for various governmental functions, such as streets and highways, solid waste management, sewerage, electric power, transit, and local libraries. At the same time, these data are not reported on an establishment basis and are not classified by NAICS."
