        "text": "Last Reviewed: February 2007\n\nVersión en español\n\nMore information on hepatitis\n\nWhat is hepatitis A?\n\nHepatitis A is a highly contagious disease that attacks the liver. It is the most common type of hepatitis reported in the United States.\n\nWho gets hepatitis A?\n\nAnyone can get hepatitis A, but certain persons are at increased risk of infection, including:\n\nChildren and adults living in areas with increased rates of hepatitis (i.e., certain Western states in the U.S.)\n\nPersons traveling to countries where hepatitis A is common (i.e., Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Western Pacific)\n\nMen who have sex with men\n\nInjecting and non-injecting drug users\n\nSexual contacts of infected persons\n\nHousehold contacts of infected persons\n\nHow is the virus spread?\n\nHepatitis A virus is usually spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth that has been contaminated with the stool of a person with hepatitis A. This type of transmission is called the \"fecal-oral\" route. For this reason, the virus is more easily spread in areas where there are poor sanitary conditions or where good personal hygiene is not observed.\n\nMost infections in the United States result from contact with a household member or sex partner who has hepatitis A.Hepatitis A virus may also be spread by consuming food or drink that has been handled by an infected person. Waterborne outbreaks are infrequent and are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. Casual contact, as in the office, factory or school setting, does not spread the virus.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis A?\n\nThe symptoms of hepatitis A may include an abrupt onset of fever, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain, dark-colored urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). The disease is rarely fatal and most people recover in a few weeks without any complications. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children. Infants and young children tend to have very mild symptoms and are less likely to develop jaundice than are older children and adults. Not everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms.\n\nHow soon do symptoms appear?\n\nThe symptoms commonly appear within 28 days of exposure, with a range of 15-50 days.\n\nFor how long is an infected person able to spread the virus?\n\nThe contagious period begins one to two weeks before symptoms appear, and is minimal about one week after the onset of jaundice. Food workers should be excluded from work for at least two weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms of hepatitis A. If jaundiced, food workers should not return to work for at least one week after onset of jaundice.\n\nDoes past infection with hepatitis A make a person immune?\n\nOnce an individual recovers from hepatitis A, he or she cannot be re-infected. He or she is immune for life and does not continue to carry the virus.\n\nWhat is the treatment for hepatitis A?\n\nThere are no special medicines or antibiotics that can be used to treat a person once the symptoms appear.\n\nHow can hepatitis A be prevented?\n\nTo prevent person-to-person spread, careful hand washing after using the bathroom, changing diapers and before preparing or eating food, is the single most important means of prevention.\n\nFoodborne hepatitis A outbreaks are relatively uncommon in the United States; however, when they occur, intensive public health efforts are required for their control. To prevent the spread of hepatitis A from an infected food worker to co-workers and/or restaurant patrons, food workers should never touch ready-to-eat foods with bare hands, and should carefully wash their hands after using the bathroom, even if the food worker does not feel sick. Food workers should never work while they are sick with stomach (gastrointestinal) illnesses.\n\nImmune globulin shots are effective in preventing the spread of hepatitis A if given within 14 days of exposure. Immune globulin may be recommended for co-workers of infected food workers. Under certain circumstances, particularly when recommended food safety procedures are not followed by food workers, public health officials may recommend that restaurant patrons receive immune globulin.\n\nFor long-term protection, hepatitis A vaccine is the best method of prevention.\n\nWho should obtain the hepatitis A vaccine?\n\nHepatitis A vaccine is recommended for the following persons:\n\nTravelers to areas with increased rates of hepatitis A\n\nMen who have sex with men\n\nInjecting and non-injecting drug users\n\nPersons with clotting-factor disorders (e.g., hemophilia)\n\nPersons with chronic liver disease (including persons with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C virus infection)\n\nAll children aged 12-23 months; children not fully vaccinated by age two\n\nThe hepatitis A vaccine may also be used in certain outbreak situations where ongoing transmission is occurring. Although studies of certain occupational groups (for example, food service workers, health care workers, child care workers, sewerage workers) have not shown an increased risk, such people may consider vaccination if they wish to further reduce their risk or are in communities where ongoing outbreaks are occurring.\n\nWhy isn't hepatitis A vaccine required for food service workers?\n\nWhile food service employers can offer hepatitis A vaccine to their employees if they wish, most public health authorities prefer not to make it mandatory for the following reasons:\n\nThere is no evidence that food service workers are at any greater risk of acquiring hepatitis A than are people in other occupations.\n\nOnly 2-3 percent of all hepatitis A cases are acquired through restaurant food.\n\nEmployee turnover in some segments of the food service industry is high, making it impractical to vaccinate staff.\n\nEmphasis on careful hand washing, use of disposable gloves and not working when ill are measures that can greatly minimize the risk of spreading hepatitis A and a number of other infections.\n\nHepatitis A vaccine would be strongly recommended for food service workers in a county or region where a community-wide outbreak has been recognized.\n\nWhat about the vaccine?\n\nCurrently, there are two hepatitis A vaccines on the market. Both vaccines are safe and highly effective. Two doses given at least six months apart, are recommended. Approximately 99-100 percent of persons vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine will develop long-lasting immunity.\n\nWhere can I obtain more information?\n\nPeople interested in receiving the vaccine should contact their health care provider or employer. For general information, please call your local health department."
