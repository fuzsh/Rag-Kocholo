        "text": "About USALLIANCE\n\nUSALLIANCE is a full-service not-for-profit financial institution federally insured by the NCUA, offering a full range of checking, savings, credit card, and loan products as well as various online banking services to over 150,000 members worldwide. Our members have access to 5,300 branch facilities and 30,000 surcharge-free ATMs across the country, in addition to USALLIANCEʼs industry leading mobile banking app.\n\nUSALLIANCE began in 1966, when a small group of IBM employees banded together to create a financial institution to serve the unique monetary needs of Tri-State Area IBM employees, which grew to become USALLIANCE Financial. Since those early days, we have expanded our reach and evolved into an evergrowing multi-faceted $3 billion cooperative serving over 150,000 members worldwide, including the employees of American Express, PepsiCo, and of course, IBM.\n\nDespite our constant growth to provide all the products and services typically associated with big banks, our focus remains on our members and providing them with the personalized service of a credit union.\n\nIf youʼre ready to become part of a team that will value and support you as we have our members and communities for over 50 years, then USALLIANCE is the place for you. We canʼt wait to welcome you into the USALLIANCE family!"
