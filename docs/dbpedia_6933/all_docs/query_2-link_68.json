        "text": "Work With Us\n\nIf you’re passionate about science, nature, plants and wildlife, water and air quality, and education, a career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service might be just what you’re looking for.\n\nA career with us also might be for you if you’re knowledgeable about public land management, information technology, facilities or heavy equipment maintenance, real estate, engineering, finance, communications, cartography, budgeting, refuge law enforcement or wildlife inspection and wildlife criminal investigation, public policy and more.\n\nOur dedicated employees perform a wide range of jobs at national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries and with public, tribal and private partners. The work is rewarding.\n\nWe hope you’ll join us in advancing our mission of working with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to recruiting and hiring a highly qualified, diverse and inclusive workforce to support our mission. Below and on associated pages you'll find information and links about U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service programs and opportunities for potential candidates. You'll also find information about our employees, our onboarding process and a diverse array of careers across the agency.\n\nFind a Job BECOME AN INTERN OR FELLOWVOLUNTEER\n\nDiscover the Youth Conservation Corps Meet Our People\n\nExplore Career Paths and Job Series\n\nNot sure where to start? Take a quiz to find your path.\n\nThere are more than 70 careers to choose from at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We value dedicated individuals with diverse education, experience and training backgrounds. Some professional jobs require a college degree. Several have specific academic credit requirements.\n\nWe offer competitive pay and generous leave, job security, a great medical and retirement benefits package, work-life flexibilities and work locations in every state and each U.S. territory.\n\nLearn more about the jobs and occupational series available with us and across the Department of the Interior.\n\nDemystify Coursework Requirements\n\nSome U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service careers require minimum education requirements and some of those require a specific number of semester or quarter hours in a particular discipline to qualify.\n\nFiguring out which courses satisfy which discipline can be confusing. We’re here to help!\n\nQuick tip:\n\nSometimes a course name does not provide enough information to tell Human Resources if a course satisfies a semester hours requirement for a particular discipline.\n\nIn cases like this, you can include a letter in your application from your professor or college dean explaining that the course contained particular content.\n\nFor example, the Fish Biology Series (0482) requires a degree with a major in biological science that includes:\n\nAt least 6 semester hours in aquatic subjects such as limnology, ichthyology, fishery biology, aquatic botany, aquatic fauna, oceanography, fish culture, or related courses in the field of fishery biology\n\nand\n\nAt least 12 semester hours in the animal sciences in such subjects as general zoology, vertebrate zoology, comparative anatomy, physiology, entomology, parasitology, ecology, cellular biology, genetics, or research in these fields. (Excess coursework in aquatic subjects may be used to meet this requirement when appropriate.)\n\nSuppose you mention in your application that you took a class in wetlands ecology.\n\nA Human Resources specialist who evaluates your application might categorize that class as coursework in aquatic subjects.\n\nBut that's not guaranteed, because wetlands ecology is not specifically listed above. (This listing matches the listing that would be in the USAJobs.gov vacancy announcement.)\n\nSo, you might want to include a letter indicating this wetlands ecology course would be classified as an aquatic subject for the purposes of this job series.\n\nFast-track Your Way to a Federal Career\n\nThe federal government offers pathways to help hire individuals who represent our diverse society. These hiring paths often can make the hiring process go more quickly. Explore different hiring paths and how they can be used to help secure a career with us.\n\nVETERANS\n\nFORMER FEDERAL LANDS INTERNS\n\nPEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES\n\nOTHER HIRING PATHS\n\nFWS posts noncompetitive vacancies for candidates who are qualified and eligible under the hiring paths linked above. Candidates must apply by the listed deadline for each position of interest. Refer to individual position flyers for duties, required documents, and application process for these vacancies.\n\nVACANCIES OPEN TO NONCOMPETITIVE CANDIDATES"
