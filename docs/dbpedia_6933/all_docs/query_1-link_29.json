An accurate and useful inventory can only be developed after careful attention to quality control issues and to the activity data required. Only then should emissions be estimated. Companies should consult GHG Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard for guidance on the entire inventory development process.\n\nBelow is a complete listing of all tools developed by GHG Protocol. Our tools enable companies to develop comprehensive and reliable inventories of their GHG emissions. Each tool reflects best-practice methods that have been extensively tested by industry experts. Many tools are accompanied by a PDF guidance document, which provides step-by-step guidance on the use of a tool and should be consulted first. Most companies will need to apply more than one tool to cover their emissions.\n\nThere are different resources for navigating GHG Protocol tools:"
