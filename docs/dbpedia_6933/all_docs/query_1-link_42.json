        "text": "Generally, when a foreign person engages in a trade or business in the United States, all income from sources within the United States connected with the conduct of that trade or business is considered to be Effectively Connected Income (ECI). This applies whether or not there is any connection between the income, and the trade or business being carried on in the United States, during the tax year.\n\nGenerally, you must be engaged in a trade or business during the tax year to be able to treat income received in that year as ECI. You usually are considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business when you perform personal services in the United States. Whether you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States depends on the nature of your activities. Deductions are allowed against ECI, and it is taxed at the graduated rates or lesser rate under a tax treaty. The discussions that follow will help you determine whether you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States.\n\nCertain kinds of Fixed, Determinable, Annual, or Periodical (FDAP) income are treated as ECI income because:\n\nCertain Internal Revenue Code Sections require the income to be treated as ECI,\n\nCertain Internal Revenue Code Sections allow elections to treat the income as ECI,\n\nCertain kinds of investment income are treated as ECI if they pass either of the two following tests:\n\nThe Asset-Use Test - The income must be associated with U.S. assets used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.\n\nBusiness Activities Test - The activities of that trade or business conducted in the United States are a material factor in the realization of the income.\n\nIn limited circumstances, some kinds of foreign source income may be treated as effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. Refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\n\nThe following categories of income are usually considered to be connected with a trade or business in the United States.\n\nYou are considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States if you are temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant on an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa. The taxable part of any U.S. source scholarship or fellowship grant received by a nonimmigrant in \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" status is treated as effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States.\n\nIf you are a member of a partnership that at any time during the tax year is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, you are considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States.\n\nYou usually are engaged in a U.S. trade or business when you perform personal services in the United States.\n\nIf you own and operate a business in the United States selling services, products, or merchandise, you are, with certain exceptions, engaged in a trade or business in the United States. For example, profit from the sale in the United States of inventory property purchased either in this country or in a foreign country is effectively connected trade or business income.\n\nGains and losses from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests (whether or not they are capital assets) are taxed as if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. You must treat the gain or loss as effectively connected with that trade or business.\n\nIncome from the rental of real property may be treated as ECI if the taxpayer elects to do so.\n\nNote: If your only U.S. business activity is trading in stocks, securities, or commodities (including hedging transactions) through a U.S. resident broker or other agent, you are NOT engaged in a trade or business in the United States.\n\nNote: Certain kinds of income, which are normally treated as ECI or FDAP for income tax purposes, may not be treated as ECI or FDAP for withholding tax purposes.\n\nApplicable Tax Rate\n\nIncome you receive during the tax year that is effectively connected with your trade or business in the United States is, after allowable deductions, taxed at the graduated rates that apply to U.S. citizens and resident aliens.\n\nTax Year\n\nGenerally, you can receive effectively connected income only if you are a nonresident alien engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year. However, income you receive in another tax year from the sale or exchange of property, the performance of services, or any other transaction is treated as effectively connected in that year, if it would have been effectively connected in the year the transaction took place or you performed the services.\n\nReferences/Related Topics"
