        "text": "Wouldn’t it be great if developing a new product came with all the rewards of being an innovator, and zero of the downsides? Unfortunately, there are always risks associated with manufacturing – and this is especially true for new products.\n\nIn this article, we’ll highlight six of the most common risks you may encounter during new product development. More importantly, we’ll explain how you can identify, minimize, and potentially even avoid some of these risks and get your product to market quickly.\n\nRisk management benefits of a new product introduction plan\n\nOne strategy for mitigating risks throughout the development process is implementing and following a new product introduction (NPI) plan. Comprised of six critical steps, the NPI plan details the process of designing and producing a new product. To be successful, NPI must be cross-functional to enable collaboration among the entire team, including product managers, engineers, purchasers, vendors, and more.\n\nOne of the benefits of a strategically sound and well-executed NPI plan is enhanced risk management. As you’ll see, the steps of NPI cover many of the common risks that can arise between ideation and full-scale production.\n\nRisks during new product development\n\nTechnology risks – When incorporating new technology in a product, there’s a chance your team may have blind spots or lack specific capabilities that could cause roadblocks during development.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: Bringing in outside experts, such as an advanced manufacturing partner, can fill in knowledge gaps and add capabilities to your project team.\n\nPerformance risks – The function and reliability of the product in real-world conditions are always unknown until it’s built and can be tested. However, any performance issue late in the game can be a major setback.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: During the Develop and Validate steps, functional prototyping and testing are conducted to confirm the product works as intended.\n\nMarket risks – Success of a new product can come down to several external factors, including customer sentiment, economic conditions, and unforeseen circumstances (a certain pandemic comes to mind). Often, timing is critical when introducing an innovative product into the market. Too early and customers may not fully understand or appreciate the technology; too late and your competitors will already be established as market leaders.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: Market research is critical to understand the customer’s needs and wants. The first step of NPI is to define the product requirements to align with the conclusions from the market research.\n\nOrganization risks – Internal conflict can stall or undermine any new product development initiative. Often, human resources are one of the biggest capability question marks on a project.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: The Define and Feasibility steps can identify any capacity issues and ensure everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n\nSupply chain risks – Sourcing materials or components from vendors can reduce costs and internal workloads, but it also makes your product vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. There’s always the possibility that a supplier can’t meet its contractual obligations.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: During material selection, you can vet suppliers for not just price but also reliability. Also, since the plan encourages cross-department communication, your entire team will stay updated on supply chain issues and make quicker decisions.\n\nFinancial risk – Certain stakeholders will be keeping an eye on the finances to make sure the project is a good investment. Restricted access to capital or arising issues that put the project over budget can prevent a new product from crossing the development finish line.\n\nWhere NPI comes in: The right plan can lower overall development costs, accelerate speed to market, and enhance manufacturability – all things that can benefit the bottom line.\n\nSet your NPI up for success with a manufacturing partner\n\nHaving an NPI and manufacturing partner won’t make risk magically disappear – but it puts you in a much better position to mitigate the risks outlined above.\n\nAs a highly experienced advanced manufacturing partner, Tapecon seamlessly integrates into your NPI plan and can serve as a design consultant and sounding board throughout the development process. From expert materials selection to functional prototyping to printing and custom converting, we can help bring your new product idea to life while keeping an eye on manufacturability of the final design.\n\nLet’s make something great"
