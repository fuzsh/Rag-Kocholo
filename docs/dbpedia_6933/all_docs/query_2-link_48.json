        "text": "Vendor Registration/Casino Service Industry Licensing\n\nThe Service Industry Licensing Bureau (SILB) assures the integrity of those persons and enterprises that provide goods or services to, or for the benefit of, the casino/hotel industry. Through its legal and investigative staff, members of the Service Industry Licensing Bureau register or investigate each person or enterprise that provides goods or services to a casino or applies for licensure as a casino service industry enterprise (CSIE) for compliance with the standards of honesty, good character and integrity required by the Casino Control Act (Act).\n\nPursuant to Section 92 of the Act, Enterprises must be either be licensed by the Division or vendor registered depending on the nature of business transacted with the casino industry. CSIE’s are categorized three ways under the Act: Section 92a(1) & (2) covers the gaming-related CSIE’s, Section 92a(3) Ancillary CSIE’s and Section 92c(1) vendor registrants.\n\nThe first category 92a(1)&(2) gaming CSIE’s are those entities which supply goods and services directly related to the operation of the casino such as gaming equipment, simulcast wagering equipment, or slot machine distributors. Providers of Internet Gaming to the casinos are also included in this category. The second category, 92a(3) Ancillary CSIE’s are those enterprises that provide goods or services ancillary to gaming activity. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to, junket enterprises and their junket representatives, licensors of authorized games, non-casino CHAB operators and lessors of casino property not required to hold a casino license. Finally, 92c(1) vendor registrants. This class covers all the other “non-gaming-related” and “non-ancillary-related” service industries that supply the other goods or services related to the operation of the hotels and casinos, but which do not impact game play, such as construction companies(and their sub-contractors), on-premise shopkeepers, trash haulers, limousine services or food purveyors. Finally, union registrants are required to register with the Division Bi-annually and are also investigated by SILB.\n\nGaming Related Casino Service Industries Enterprises\n\nWhat is the standard for licensure for a 92a(1) or (2) gaming-related CSIE?\n\nGaming related CSIE’s and their key personnel/qualifiers must demonstrate good character, honesty and integrity as well as financial stability, integrity and responsibility. Qualifiers must not have engaged in any conduct that is prohibited by Section 86 of the Casino Control Act.\n\nWhat is the fee for filing a 92a(1) or (2) gaming related CSIE application?\n\nThe initial filing fee is $5,000. A check or money order made payable to the “Casino Control Fund” or a Credit Card Authorization Form (available on the Division’s Web site) are accepted forms of payment.\n\nWhen is a 92a(1) or (2) gaming-related CSIE authorized to conduct business with the casino industry?\n\nGaming related CSIE’s must be licensed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 5:12-92a(1) or (2) and cannot conduct any business with the casino industry while their initial license is pending unless the Director issues a transactional waiver pursuant to N.J.A.C. 13:69J-1.2B authorizing them to do so.\n\nDo I have to renew my 92a(1) or (2) gaming-related CSIE license?\n\nOnce the license is granted, the license does not expire. Therefore, you are no longer required to file a renewal application. Once licensed, you will need to file a “re-submission” every five years from the date of licensure demonstrating that the enterprise and all associated qualifiers still meet the criteria for licensure.\n\nAncillary Casino Service Industries\n\nWhat type of license is required by a junket enterprise?\n\nJunket enterprises and their associated junket representatives are now considered Ancillary Casino Service Industries pursuant to N.J.S.A. 5:12-102c. The August 2012 amendment to the Casino Control Act now requires all junkets conducting business with the casino industry, regardless of their volume of business, to file an application for licensure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 5:12-92a(3).\n\nWhat is the standard for licensure for an Ancillary Casino Service Industry Enterprises (Ancillary CSIE)?\n\nThe ancillary enterprises and their key personnel/qualifiers must establish by clear and convincing evidence their good character, honesty and integrity and provide such financial information as may be required by the Division.\n\nWhat is the fee for filing as an Ancillary CSIE?\n\nThe initial filing fee is $2,000. Please see N.J.A.C. 13:69A-9.8A for further details.\n\nDo I have to renew my Ancillary CSIE license?\n\nPursuant to N.J.S.A. 5:12-94, once the license is granted the license does not expire. Therefore, you are no longer required to file a renewal application. However, you will need to file a “re-submission” every five years from the date of licensure showing that the enterprise and all qualifiers still meet the criteria for licensure.\n\nWhat is the re-submission fee for an Ancillary CSIE license?\n\nThe re-submission filing fee is $2,000. Please see N.J.A.C. 13:69A-9.8A for further details.\n\nVendor Registration\n\nWho needs to file a Vendor Registration?\n\nAll vendors offering goods and services to a casino pursuant to Section 92c(1) of the Act must file for Vendor Registration.\n\nHow are vendor registrations filed and processed?\n\nAll vendors offering goods and services to a casino pursuant to Section 92c(1) of the Act must file a Vendor Registration Form (VRF). The VRF is completed by the vendor and is filed with the Division by the casino licensee. At the same time that the casino gives the vendor the VRF to obtain the information needed for the casino to file a completed VRF with the Division, it will also provide the vendor with a Vendor Registration Supplemental Disclosure Form (VRSDF) which the vendor must fill out and file directly with the Division. The vendor must file this VRSDF directly with the Division within 30 days of the filing of a completed VRF. If the vendor does not file the VRSDF with the Division within that 30-day period, the vendor registration issued by the Division will be subject to revocation and the vendor prohibited from transacting any further business with the casino industry. The VRF must be obtained from and filed directly with the casino the vendor intends to initially do business. The VRSDF, which is sent directly to the Division, can be found on the Division’s Web site (Form 40).\n\nHow long does a Vendor Registration remain valid?\n\nA vendor registration is effective upon issuance, and will remain in effect unless revoked, suspended, limited or otherwise restricted by the Division. Notwithstanding this, if a vendor registrant has not conducted business with a casino hotel facility for a period of three years, the registration of that vendor registrant will lapse.\n\nWill vendor registration be delayed because of the requirement for filing of a VRSDF?\n\nNo. The Division will process a completed VRF filed by a casino upon receipt and at that time, a vendor registration number will be issued. A vendor registrant will then have 30 days to submit a completed VRSDF directly to the Division or risk automatic revocation of its vendor registration.\n\nIs there a fee for filing a Vendor Registration Form (VRF) and the Vendor Registration Supplemental Disclosure Form? (VRSDF)\n\nThere is no fee associated with the filing of a VRF or the VRSDF.\n\nHow can I find out if my Vendor registration is valid?\n\nThe Active Vendors List (AVL) identifies all approved vendors that have been registered to do business with the Atlantic City casinos. This list is updated on a daily basis.\n\nHow do I find out what my Vendor Registration number is?\n\nThe Active Vendors Lists (AVL) can be used to locate your Vendor Registration number.\n\nPDF | XLS\n\nUse the document below to interpret the status codes on the report:\n\nAdditional Information and Keys to Interpret Status Codes\n\nWho do I contact if my company does not appear on the Active Vendors List (AVL)?\n\nIf your company does not appear on the list, first contact the casino at which the form was originally filed. You may then call the Division office at 609-441-3555."
