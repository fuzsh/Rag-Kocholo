        "text": "The food service industry is a vital part of the community that contributes to the social, cultural, environmental, and economic aspects of a nation.\n\nFood service includes operations that involve preparing, handling, cooking, storing, and delivering foods to consumers away from their homes.\n\nFood service businesses include restaurants, cafes, bars, and institutional caterers.\n\nFoodDocs' smart Food Safety Management System covers all food safety regulations for food service businesses.\n\nThe food service industry is a vital part of a community as it offers diverse value. The industry houses establishments related to preparing, handling, distributing, and serving an array of products and services to consumers away from their homes. This industry is highly competitive and involves different aspects of customer service, food preparation, and business management. The food service industry significantly contributes to the economic growth of a country.\n\nEstablishments such as restaurants, cafes, cafeterias, and institutional catering companies fall under the food service industry. Each type has its unique nature of service and can provide distant dining experiences.\n\nIn this article, we dig deeper into the ins and outs of the food service industry. We also introduce how our smart Food Safety Management System can help every food service business comply with all food safety regulations.\n\nHere is a quick list of what is discussed in this blog post:\n\nWhat is food service definition?\n\nFood service refers to the preparation, handling, packaging, and distribution of food, beverage, and related services by an establishment. This industry mainly involves different types of industries, such as restaurants, cafes, bars, cafeterias, catering companies, and institutional food providers.\n\nFood service is otherwise known as catering. It is an essential sector of a community that makes up a significant percentage of a country's economy. This sector provides daily food products, services, niche requirements, and similar services to members of the community.\n\nFood safety agencies define food service as any facility that serves meals and snacks for immediate consumption or food away from home. Food retailers are also part of this sector.\n\nFood service providers aim to deliver quality food and services to the community while adhering to established laws and codes on food safety.\n\nCentralized food service definition\n\nCentralized food service, otherwise termed the commissary food system, is a type of food service system where food is prepared and distributed from a central location. Central facilities produce large batches of food to redistribute to smaller facilities.\n\nThe centralized food service system is often applied in institutions such as hospital cafeterias, schools, and care centers. This type of system provides efficiency in producing large quantities of food. It also provides assurance in maintaining quality and safety and makes management more efficient as there is only one location to monitor.\n\nFood service industry\n\nThe food service industry involves several different businesses with varying natures of services, but all serving food and beverage.\n\nThe food service industry generates a significant amount of revenue for a country and provides business opportunities and employment to its citizens. The industry provides leisure, convenience, and health requirements to all the members of a community.\n\nThe industry aims to provide consumers with high-quality food, beverage, and services that satisfy their personal and nutritional requirements. As such, the food service industry moves toward the direction of what consumers want while considering the environment, economic climate, and other critical factors.\n\nOverview of the food service industry\n\nThe contributions of the foodservice industry to the global economy cannot be more emphasized. In 2021, the industry was valued at $2,323.29 billion.\n\nThe industry provides countless employment opportunities to individuals. In the U.S., the foodservice industry employs approximately 15.6 million workforces. This estimation accounts for 10.5% of the total U.S. employment. The U.S. food industry is estimated to be well over $1.5 trillion, which is roughly 4% of the country's total GDP.\n\nIn the U.K., the food and drink service sector is valued to be approximately $73 billion. The sector employs approximately 4.2 million food service workers in the U.K.\n\nThe foodservice industry all over the world connects different sectors together. The supply chain keeps businesses, such as fresh food production, food retail sale, and food distribution programs, afloat and provides several opportunities for people.\n\nThe sector helps bridge the gap of food insecurity and ensures access to consumer demands and options. These contributions come with their commitment to serve only safe food and quality products and protect public health from food safety hazards.\n\nWe've compiled more foodservice industry statistics in this article.\n\nWhat government agencies regulate the restaurant and food service industry?\n\nNational, state, and local government food safety agencies regulate the restaurant and food service industry in every country. They are responsible for creating food laws and regulations that aim to create food standards for food preparation, provide nutritious food, and protect public health from foodborne illnesses. Food safety agencies emphasize how food regulations are important for protecting public health.\n\nThe scope and limitation of each agency's authority over the industry practices vary from one country to another. In one nation, there may be more than two food safety agencies, whereas there are countries that have one agency with the sole responsibility of regulating the food service sector.\n\nIn the U.S., the food service industry is mainly regulated by three government agencies:\n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA). This federal agency regulates approximately 78% of the U.S. food supply. The food and health agency establishes and monitors food safety regulations for handling, processing, labeling, packaging, and the delivery of foods in and out of the country. It also conducts food safety inspections to ensure food safety compliance. The FDA works with local health departments to implement food regulations.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Services (USDA FSIS). This federal agency is responsible for monitoring safety and establishing food safety laws regarding products such as meats, poultry, and egg products. The FSIS also conducts training and outreach programs to food businesses to help them comply with the necessary laws.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. This federal agency conducts research and programs that help the nation understand food safety practices more deeply to protect public health. They are also responsible for conducting investigations and monitoring cases of food safety outbreaks.\n\nIn the U.K., food safety agencies are not divided into different departments.\n\nFood Standards Agency (FSA). The food service industry is mainly governed by the Food Standards Agency FSA. The agency is responsible for implementing food safety laws and monitoring food hygiene within England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The agency works with local authorities to regulate food handling and production to ensure the safety of public health. It provides the necessary policies for food businesses to run as safely as possible.\n\nFood Standards Scotland. This agency is the public food agency for Scotland. It is responsible for ensuring food safety in the foods being produced and handled in Scotland. It also provides guidance for food businesses in Scotland on how to comply with food safety laws.\n\nIn both countries, federal agencies coordinate with local and state health departments to implement food safety laws. They are responsible for ensuring compliance among food businesses and reporting to federal agencies regarding food safety issues. Local health agencies also monitor health code violations.\n\nAll food safety and health agencies work toward protecting public health and helping food businesses work seamlessly.\n\nRead more about the roles and responsibilities of food and health agencies in different countries here.\n\nWhich organization makes recommendations for food safety regulations in the food service industry?\n\nIn the U.S., the FDA creates recommendations on food safety operations that are regularly compiled and updated under the Food Code. These recommendations are adapted throughout different states and are enforced as laws and regulations. They cover a wide range of food safety operations, including receiving, handling, storing, preparing, cooking, and cleaning in food businesses.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in the U.K., food safety laws are enforced by the Food Standards Agency. The agency enforces laws established in the Food Safety Act of 1990. In addition to this main law, the FSA makes suggestions for amendments and new regulations based on the extensive information that it gathers from local health departments.\n\nFood service industry trends\n\nEvery year, the food service industry is evolving. Whether it is in size, innovation, or complexity of operations, choices of food and services from food businesses grow wider each year. Customer demands, technological innovations, and the current state of health and safety often drive changes and trends.\n\nSome of the most recent trends in food service include the following:\n\nHealth and wellness products. With the rising number of health concerns, consumers are increasingly looking for healthy food options. More health-conscious consumers are demanding safe solutions. Food innovations that promote good health, such as the incorporation of probiotics and the use of functional foods, are now widely available in the market.\n\nSustainability. As the concerns regarding the environmental impacts of the food industry continuously grow, the industry is moving towards more sustainable operations. Trends include sourcing ingredients from local farms that use sustainable practices, reducing carbon footprints, and using more renewable energy.\n\nTechnology. The food service industry has become more accepting of the efficiencies that technology can offer. Food handling operations are now being aided by technological advancements such as robotics and other smart solutions. Two great catalysts of technology in this industry include the recent pandemic and the ongoing crisis of labor shortage. Technology has made food service more accessible to customers, such as in the case of food delivery automation.\n\nEnhanced customer experience. Partnered with the rise of technology, businesses are improving more on finding ways to serve their customers better. One great example of this innovation is the use of artificial intelligence in collecting customer behavior and preferences. Businesses use the gathered information to tailor their services to these factors.\n\nFood safety and transparency. With the increased awareness of foodborne illnesses and food safety concerns, food service establishments are prioritizing food safety and hygiene practices. Now, more than ever, customers want to become involved by gaining access to the process of how their foods are made.\n\nNew business models. As a result of the pandemic, newer business models are becoming more popular. You will see more food delivery options, ghost kitchen concepts, and food trucks more often than before. Now, food service businesses also focus on bringing a unique experience to customers in their comfort.\n\nThese are just some of the current trends in food industry. As consumer preferences and market dynamics continue to evolve, food service establishments need to stay agile and adapt to these trends to remain competitive and meet the changing demands of their customers.\n\nRead more about the latest trends in the food industry from our detailed article.\n\nWhat is the importance of food service in the food industry?\n\nThe food service industry is an indispensable part of any country's ecosystem. The industry provides services that contribute to the economic, social, environmental, and cultural aspects and lifestyle of a community.\n\nSpecifically, the food service industry provides every nation with the following benefits:\n\nAccess to prepared and nutritional food. Food service businesses, such as cafes, restaurants, and cafeterias, mainly provide convenience to consumers. They help consumers get access to meals that are prepared away from home, whether for leisure or just convenience. Food service businesses also make unique products accessible to a larger community, such as restaurants that specialize in a particular cuisine.\n\nJob opportunities and economic impact. We previously mentioned how significant is the contribution of the food service industry to a nation. The industry created job opportunities for millions of people. This helps them create a sustainable living for the members of society. In addition, the revenues generated from the industry help stimulate a country's economic growth.\n\nSupply chain and sourcing. In addition to job opportunities, the food service industry also creates opportunities for other members of the supply chain, such as local farms, producers, and logistics. The industry serves as a large connecting sector to many different industries.\n\nCulinary innovation. Food service businesses are also a sector where creative minds work best. Culinary professionals introduce new food meals, experiences, flavors, and food service specialties to consumers that can drive their preferences and set trends.\n\nFood technology innovation. The food service industry makes for a great testing ground for new technology. Innovators use the service industry to implement more efficient equipment, ordering system, digital platforms, and cooking techniques that will ultimately make things more convenient for businesses and consumers.\n\nFood safety. In addition to new experience and quality, the food service industry also ensures that the food supply received by the consumers are safe. The industry is heavily regulated by food laws that help prevent issues that can put the lives of consumers at risk.\n\nSocial and cultural importance. The food industry has always been connected with social and cultural significance. Several food establishments carry historical significance for a location. They help preserve traditions, local cuisines, and heritage.\n\nWhen properly regulated, the food service industry becomes an invaluable component of a nation's growth. Its contributions to the community help enhance the consumer's way of living, preserve traditions, and stimulate economic growth.\n\nCritical food service skills and equipment\n\nThe food service industry gathers people with different expertise related to food preparation and service. Food service professionals and business entrepreneurs all gather in this sector to create a working and efficient food service industry.\n\nYou can see in this industry a wide range of skills, innovative products, and equipment. Experts in food safety and hygiene, customer service, planning, accounting, innovation, presentation, and inventors collaborate to make the food service industry.\n\nWith these critical skills and restaurant equipment in place, the food service industry can thrive, delivering delicious meals, ensuring food safety, providing excellent customer service, and contributing to the overall success of food businesses.\n\nBelow, we discuss more on what critical food service skills and equipment are essential for a food service business.\n\nWhat are the essential food service skills?\n\nThe food service industry requires a specific set of skills and competencies for a business to survive. This industry is filled with tough competition, and only the most efficient and effective workers flourish.\n\nEmployees in the food service sector must have the following skills:\n\nCulinary skills. Personnel that requires this skill includes chefs, cooks, and kitchen aids. These skills comprise proper food handling, preparation techniques, cooking methods, and presentation.\n\nFood safety and food hygiene. This skill is a requirement for all food service personnel. It includes basic knowledge of how to prepare and handle food without introducing food safety hazards into the food system that can cause foodborne illness.\n\nCustomer service. As food service involves interactions with customers, employees are required to have people skills and good communication abilities for customer interactions. This skill can help resolve conflicts in cases of issues and promote customer satisfaction.\n\nTime management. This skill is essential for any level of food service employee. Time management is the key to an efficient operation and can help improve coordination among team members.\n\nMenu planning. Although a specific skill for specialized employees, menu planning is essential. This is often a skill that food service managers or supervisors must have. This skill is key to upselling a foodservice business to consumers and ensuring competitive yet reasonable prices.\n\nAccounting. Food service also has a business aspect. Managers must be able to properly analyze the food cost and revenues of a food business to gauge its performance.\n\nCritical thinking. Quick thinking and problem-solving skills are important in the food service industry to address unforeseen challenges, such as customer complaints, foodservice equipment malfunctions, or food safety issues.\n\nFood service skills can be categorized as entry-level, skilled, and supervisory. This categorization depends on the expertise of an employee or food service operator and can be further improved upon through training and experience.\n\nWhat are examples of common food service equipment?\n\nIn addition to a community of different experts as part of the food service workforce, the food service industry house several unique pieces of commercial equipment. These pieces of food processing equipment often come in industrial size and can produce more yield than the common household food prep tools.\n\nFood service equipment helps in making food handling tasks more efficient, precise, and accurate all the time in the restaurant industry. Some of the essential restaurant equipment list that every food service business must have includes the following:\n\nOvens, deep fryers, and grills\n\nGas ranges\n\nAir ventilation\n\nMeat slicers\n\nIndustrial mixers and food processors\n\nCounters and preparation tables,\n\nCutleries and chopping boards,\n\n3-compartment sinks\n\nCommercial ice machines\n\nStorage cabinets\n\nCommercial refrigeration equipment\n\nFood warmers and disposable food containers\n\nCounters and service tables\n\nSoftware programs\n\nThese common equipment and kitchen tools are all food service essentials. Some types of food service facilities may require more specialized versions of tools and restaurant supply products to emphasize particular attributes.\n\nCommercial restaurant appliances make the jobs of food service workers easier. They are also designed to make fewer mistakes and preserve the quality and safety of foods for consumers.\n\nMore advanced commercial kitchen equipment helps ensure a more efficient operation for the restaurant business. Take FoodDocs' smart Food Safety Management System, for example. This smart software uses cutting-edge technology to automatically produce digital monitoring logs and checklists that are essential for food safety. Our software system also provides smart solutions to help ensure food safety compliance all the time, with minimal effort.\n\nWhat are food service supplies and their role in the industry?\n\nFood service and kitchen supplies include a wide range of products and equipment used in this industry to help in the preparation, presentation, and delivery of food. Supplies make up the products served to consumers. They are the tools used to prepare the food and the ingredients that make up the food.\n\nFood service supplies come from different related businesses. Some supplies are staples for all types of food service businesses, whereas some are unique or even exclusive to some operations.\n\nThe following are considered food prep supplies:\n\nKitchen utensils, tools, and cookware sets\n\nTableware and commercial dinnerware sets\n\nDining room furniture (e.g., fixtures and chairs for restaurants)\n\nFood storage\n\nCleaning and sanitation supplies\n\nDisposables\n\nRaw ingredients\n\nA food service business cannot run without supplies. These tools and materials are required to operate smoothly and provide the customers with what they need.\n\nOther innovative restaurant supplies are essential to maintain food safety, contributing to the overall success and compliance of a food service business. High-quality restaurant supplies can help businesses achieve their goals faster.\n\nWho are the food service distributors?\n\nFood service distributors are third-party entities that supply or deliver food and non-food products to food service establishments. These restaurant food distributors act as a bridge between manufacturers and food service businesses. They help make various products and services accessible to other food service businesses, including restaurants, retail stores, convenience stores, and other independent companies in the food service industry.\n\nFood service distributors procure and purchase products and services from a wide range of growers, manufacturers, and other suppliers and then redistribute them to other businesses. The extensive product list and services redistributed by food service distributors range from perishable food items to outsourcing services, such as menu planning, culinary support, and training programs.\n\nThe contributions of food service distributors in the food service industry allow for a consistent supply of food products and services.\n\nWhat are the functions of distributors in the supply chain?\n\nIndependent food distributors can help businesses sustain their supply of ingredients, products, and services. Distributors ensure that there is no gap in the supply chain for continuous operation.\n\nIn particular, the main functions of food service distributors are the following:\n\nProcurement and sourcing. Distributors take out the tedious task of searching for food suppliers and industry resources from your preferred producers. They negotiate competitive prices and terms according to your needs, and you can choose from their list of partners for more cost-effective transactions.\n\nInventory management. Partnering with a food service distributor can help you manage your stocks efficiently. Distributors employ their own traceability and inventory management system to ensure that the products you need are always available.\n\nTransportation and logistics. Distributors act as third-party logistics partners and take care of coordinating the transportation and delivery schedule. Distributors make the delivery of products to restaurants less costly.\n\nCustomer service. Distributors of services can provide food service businesses with support in handling inquiries and complaints and resolving issues.\n\nWider market access. Perhaps one of the most valuable roles of specialty distributors is they allow access to a wider and international market and supply. In terms of supplies, a food distributor help businesses purchase ingredients from very far locations. On the other end of the process, distributors also help businesses reach more customers through order deliveries.\n\nValue-added services. Some distributors also provide services such as product information and education, training, marketing support, business solutions, and even customer handling.\n\nProduct promotion. By allowing distributors to handle your products and services, you can reach more customers. This can help you promote your brand and attract more potential customers.\n\nA food distribution company serves as a one-stop shop and intermediary between food manufacturers or producers and end customers, ensuring that products are efficiently delivered to their intended destinations. Their expertise in providing business food solutions and managing the complexity of the supply chain helps streamline operations, optimize inventory levels, and provide value-added services to customers.\n\nWhat are the two segments of the food service industry?\n\nThe food service industry consists of several different food businesses. Each food company may differ in the target market, the services offered, objectives, and applicable regulations. The food businesses in this industry are divided into two categories, namely:\n\nNon-commercial food service\n\nCommercial food service\n\nThe categorization of businesses in the food service industry help in understanding their unique characteristics. Both segments aim to provide food and beverage, but they have their own goals and dynamics.\n\nBelow, we discuss each segment in detail.\n\nNon-commercial food service definition\n\nNon-commercial food service refers to businesses that provide food and beverage in different institutions to support their main functions. This segment of the food service industry does not put profit-making as its primary goal. Instead, they provide food and services to fulfill social needs.\n\nThe non-commercial segment of the food service industry uses a not-for-profit model to serve its customer base, which includes students, patients, and employees inside a particular institution. That being said, common examples of non-commercial food services include the following:\n\nSchools\n\nHealthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals and nursing homes)\n\nGovernment institutions\n\nMilitary bases\n\nCorrectional facilities\n\nInstitutional catering\n\nIn terms of pricing, non-commercial food service businesses have less flexibility. They are commonly regulated by the institution they are operating under. This regulation may also include dietary requirements regarding the foods they serve. Non-commercial businesses undergo stricter guidelines regarding the food they serve, especially for health-related institutions. For example, food service cafeterias in schools are often bound under the approved school nutrition standards.\n\nCommercial food service definition\n\nCommercial food service businesses are typical food facilities. They primarily operate to make a profit by serving food and beverage to consumers. Commercial businesses are commonly privately owned and makeup 80% of the entire food service industry.\n\nCommon examples of commercial food service businesses include:\n\nCafes\n\nRestaurants\n\nHotels\n\nGhost or Cloud kitchens\n\nCommercial kitchens\n\nFood courts\n\nBars\n\nThe food and services offered by commercial food service businesses are greatly affected by food trends, consumer demand, and competition. In addition to the food they offer, they also use unique themes and dining experiences as selling points.\n\nCommercial businesses serve a significantly wider range of customers. They often focus on creating a pleasant dining experience, building customer loyalty, and attracting repeat business. This food service segment is subject to regulations, including licensing, labor, sanitation, food safety, services, and other industry regulations.\n\nBoth segments of the food service industry are mandated to follow food safety regulations. Whether the business is profit or non-profit oriented, the food business must ensure that all served products will not cause any food safety issues. It is part of the food service manager's responsibility to ensure that their team has a solid approach to food safety.\n\nFood service manager certification\n\nA food service manager is a critical part of a food business' organizational chart. They are responsible for overseeingand controlling food operations and ensuring safe food working conditions. A manager's job may go beyond just managing their team. It also includes financial planning, menu development, strategizing marketing plans, and ensuring food safety compliance.\n\nTo prove competence, a food service manager is expected to have Food Service Manager Certification. The certification process involves undergoing food safety training, education, and extensive evaluation to develop the necessary skills for managing a food service business. The topics involved in this process include understanding food safety, managing employees, and strategizing to grow your business.\n\nA manager certification is often a requirement or recommendation by local or federal food safety agencies. Having a certified officer each shift is a critical part of ensuring food safety compliance for any food service business.\n\nA manager certification is generally valid for most states in the U.S. for five years. Managers must undergo refresher courses or additional training to renew this certificate. The amount of time before the certification renewal is enough to collect new trends and advancements in managing food service businesses.\n\nRole of food service director\n\nA food service director, otherwise known as the food service manager, is responsible for ensuring that the entire food service operation is running as planned. The director is given the task of managing and connecting the different departments of a food service business and finding ways to grow the business.\n\nSome of the core roles of a food service director include the following:\n\nStrategic planning\n\nFinancial management\n\nOperational management\n\nMarketing\n\nStaff management\n\nFood safety compliance\n\nFood quality control\n\nCustomer service\n\nCoordination with suppliers\n\nEmergency preparedness\n\nThe food service director is not only expected to manage the business.

It is an essential aspect of a business needed to continue operating.\n\nThe following are general and basic, yet critical, food safety rules for compliance:\n\nTrain your employees on food safety. All employees must receive basic training on food safety and proper food service. Some countries require a food handler's license. This aims to help them understand the importance of food safety and how to prevent foodborne illnesses from occurring. Managers must provide food safety training and employee resources for consistent learning.\n\nImplement temperature control. This applies to the storage, cooking, and handling of foods. Controlling temperature is the most effective method to prevent the growth of bacteria, which can cause foodborne illness.\n\nAvoid cross - contamination. Foodservice establishments must implement controls to prevent cross-contamination. Controls may include providing separate food service tools and utensils for raw and cooked materials.\n\nKeep the facility clean and sanitized. As a prerequisite, all food contact surfaces in a food service establishment must be clean and sanitized properly. A food service facility must provide the necessary tools to perform these tasks.\n\nEmployees must maintain proper hygiene.

This includes how they present themselves and the following pointers:\n\nEmployees must follow the proper dress code for food service employees and food service hair rules.\n\nEmployees must know when to wash their hands.\n\nEmployees must follow effective food sanitation practices.\n\nPractice proper storage of food products and ingredients. Food service businesses must have the necessary storage areas and food storage equipment to help maintain the safety of their food products and minimize contamination and food spoilage. This tip also includes employing an inventory management system, including proper food stock rotation.\n\nChoose your supplier or distributor carefully. Restaurant suppliers and distributors play an important role in keeping food safe. The quality of the food ingredients that you receive can greatly determine the safety of your existing stocks. All ingredients must arrive fresh and in good condition.\n\nImplement a comprehensive food safety system with food hazard control plans. A comprehensive food safety management system will help your food service business cover all vulnerable areas and control potential food safety hazards. This plan includes proper controls and appropriate monitoring techniques to help ensure consistent compliance. The plan must include other specific management controls, such as the following:\n\nAllergen management\n\nPest management\n\nFood waste management\n\nRecord all food safety operations. To serve as proof for any inspection and record of tasks, your team must properly document all results related to food safety compliance. In case of a health inspection, these records will verify your foodservice operations' compliance with food safety regulations.\n\nPerform regular food safety audits. As a form of self-evaluation, your team must conduct regular food safety audits. This task will help you identify any areas that may be non-compliant and immediately address them.\n\nFood safety is a critical component of the food service industry, in addition to serving great-tasting food.
