        "text": "Work and school accounts have more advanced security and compliance tools to protect sensitive organization data.\n\nWork or school accounts are often associated with Microsoft 365 for business or Microsoft 365 Education products and are managed by an administrator responsible for assigning user accounts and Microsoft 365 licenses to people in their organization.\n\nWhen you first sign up for a Microsoft business product like Microsoft 365 for business, you get an email address that ends with .onmicrosoft.com. You can use that address or customize it by adding your own domain (you@FourthCoffee.com).\n\nWith Microsoft Entra, Microsoft provides the identity platform as a service, but you can modify some of the configuration and settings, such as adding your own custom domain name (@contoso.com) or requiring multi-factor authentication. Your Microsoft Entra instance is available via the Microsoft Entra admin center and other management tools like PowerShell, the Azure CLI and the REST API. You can also monitor and investigate advanced security events with tools like Microsoft Sentinel."
