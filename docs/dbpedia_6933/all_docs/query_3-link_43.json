        "text": "Products and services are two offerings that businesses can deliver for their customers to answer some type of pain point. While businesses that sell products and services want to engage with customers and create an outstanding customer experience in both situations, there are fundamental differences in how these organizations conduct business.\n\nAn effective product marketing campaign, for instance, isn’t necessarily going to follow the same strategy as a services marketing campaign. A product could be something for one-time use, such as a new supplement, whereas a service could offer a more intangible product, like a plumber offering water line repairs.\n\nUnderstanding these differentiations is important for your small business — particularly when outlining your business model and figuring out your price point. In this guide, we’ll identify the key differences between product- and service-related businesses so that you’re on the right track to success.\n\nWhat is the difference between a product and a service?\n\nThe main difference between selling a product versus selling a service lies in the tangibility of what you sell. A tangible product is something manufactured, advertised, and sold to the customer. In response, the customer will like the product or decide to return it if it doesn’t meet their needs.\n\nOn the other hand, a service is an intangible product — it can’t be touched. The service is something that the business does for their customer, using their expertise to help the customer in a particular way. Services have a greater opportunity for customization to ensure they meet the customer’s needs. However, while contracts can be canceled, the service can’t be returned in the same way as the product.\n\nSince the setup of these two types of businesses differs, there are benefits and drawbacks to each. Service-based businesses provide entrepreneurs with the ability to start providing services and making money almost immediately. For example, a copywriter can produce content for clients nearly as soon as they open their business. On the other hand, an entrepreneur who wants to sell a physical product must secure the funding to produce the product and promote it before making money.\n\nConversely, the service-based business will only bring in income so long as you actively work. However, selling a product online allows you to keep your business running 24/7 without having to actively man a physical location the entire time. You can make money while sleeping or on vacation and log in to run marketing campaigns and fill orders at the hours that work best for you.\n\nIn terms of securing funding, there’s no real benefit for either type of business. A bank or lender will require a strong business plan regardless of your offering to demonstrate that your product or service has a market and that you’ve done your market research to differentiate your business for prospective customers.\n\nService Businesses\n\nService-based businesses focus on using expertise to provide an important service for a customer. These businesses generally require significantly fewer startup costs, as you won’t have to invest in producing and manufacturing products to sell. Instead, you only need the materials that equip you to provide a service for your clients.\n\nFor service businesses, there are a few key points that entrepreneurs should remember:\n\nVariability in pricing: Pricing for service-based businesses often reflects your experience and expertise, which means pricing can increase as you become more experienced. Pricing also needs to take into account the time needed to complete the job.\n\nMore touch points with clients: Services often require more back-and-forth with clients, as they receive your service and work with you to learn how to get the most out of it.\n\nHigher need for trust: Service-based jobs generally include building yourself as an expert in the minds of potential clients, which means that the marketing strategy often focuses on creating trust.\n\nSome examples of service-based businesses might be:\n\nHome repair and maintenance: These include electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.\n\nCreative services: Think copywriters, website developers, graphic designers, etc.\n\nHealth care services: This includes physical therapists, nutritionists, and personal trainers.\n\nProfessional services: This can include anyone from marketers to accountants.\n\nPersonal care: These services meet a direct human need, like a life coach, manicurist, or massage therapist.\n\nCertain types of business may also combine elements of product- and service-based businesses. For example, a car dealership may also offer maintenance services. Other entrepreneurs might sell healthy, organic food and complement the sales by offering life coaching sessions.\n\nOffering this type of hybrid relationship can benefit businesses. Some find that maintaining their relationship with customers by providing a service helps to remain in touch with customer needs and more easily pivot when they change. Nurturing this relationship also helps build professional trust, which can position the business for more upsell or resell opportunities moving forward."
