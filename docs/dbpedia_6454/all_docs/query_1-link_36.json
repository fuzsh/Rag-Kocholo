        "text": "Analysis associated with each decade\n\n1960-1969: Franco's dictatorship\n\nGay men and lesbians are made invisible, being a taboo subject. In none of the advertisements viewed is there any allusion to the diversity of sexual orientations. The family model shown is univocal and traditional, with the exclusive representation of heterosexual couples. To a greater extent, young couples are shown, and depending on the product advertised, they are shown with or without children. Gender roles are usually shown in a differentiated way, which is congruent if we take into account the historical and cultural context: Francoism.\n\nAll the advertisements that were broadcast went through Franco's censorship, and no prejudices or stereotypes were broadcast through advertising. Therefore, in this decade there is a relationship between advertising treatment and the legislative and social treatment of gay men and lesbians, making them completely invisible.\n\n1970-1979: End of the dictatorship and early years of democracy in Spain\n\nAdvertisements continue to perpetuate a great difference between the gender roles of men and women, either through their content or by the way in which their storyline is delivered. For example, the mother continues to be assigned the responsibility of childcare, and the father the ownership of objects such as cars (as seen in the Nesquik ad, No. 6). In addition, it is emphasized that products such as alcohol are consumed exclusively by men (as in the case of González Byass's Soberano Cognac, with the slogan “It's a man's thing”, ads Nos. 9 and 10). Particularly striking is the second González Byass ad (No. 10), which even shows a scene normalizing gender violence.\n\nIn this context, an univocal and traditional family and couple model is shown. Even in advertisements that claim to be inclusive, such as Coca Cola's (No. 8), the diversity of sexual orientations is ignored. Therefore, there is still a relationship between advertising treatment and the legislative and social treatment of gay men and lesbians.\n\n1980-1989: Movements and social changes\n\nAdvertising in the 1980s experienced a process of modernization, in line with the rest of Spanish society.\n\nAs far as gender roles are concerned, there are ads in which a clear differentiation is evident (No. 11, by Monky; and No. 15, by Johnson), along with others in which they appear practically undifferentiated (No. 13, by Riera-Marsá; and No. 14, by Princesa). In the latter, a greater co-responsibility of men in domestic tasks can be observed compared to previous decades (No. 13). However, it is true that sometimes these men are still presented with a humorous and ridiculing tone, as if they are facing impossible tasks to perform (this is the case with No. 12, Scotch Brite).\n\nIn addition to all of the above, there is a greater normalization of sexuality and eroticism. For this purpose, puns and double meanings are used (advertisement No. 14, from Galletas Princesa). However, for the time being, the family model seems to remain unique and the couples represented are heterosexual and young.\n\nWe should remember that, in the 1980s, the process of protesting to demand rights and equality between heterosexuals and gay men and lesbians continued. The World Health Organization still considered gay men and lesbians “sick”; therefore, there was still no effective integration into society. In other words, there was still a relationship between the legal and sociocultural context and the reality reflected in advertisements.\n\n1990-1999: Social openness and the evolution of equality\n\nIt should be noted that, as far as sexuality is concerned, the path of openness started in the previous decade continues. Usually, double meanings are still used when referring to this type of topic (No. 16, from Starlux; and No. 19, from Rumba Total), and advertisers manage to connect these ambiguities with the promotion of the product (for example, a woman with her partner saying “this one does it the way I like it”, to promote the Starlux granulated broth).\n\nDuring this decade, equality between gender roles began to be reflected more effectively. Men appear more frequently as jointly responsible for household chores and childcare (advertisements Nos. 16 and 18).\n\nIn addition, announcements begin to be made that little by little highlight the uniqueness and independence of being women. Ad No. 20, from Woman magazine, is a good example. Although this modernization was rather lax, it opened the door for women to want to feel beautiful in themselves, not for their husbands (the attitude changes regarding submission, from advertisements such as No. 1) and, the most interesting thing in our field study, opened the door to women who do not like men.\n\nIn the same way, it is worth noting the clear contrast in children's social relations between the advertisements of the 1960s/1970s and those made in the 1990s: in the former, boys and girls are shown playing separately, in different groups and with different toys (spots No. 2 and No.7), while in the latter they are shown playing together and cooperating (adverts Nos. 3 and 17).\n\nThe evolution in the concept of family and love follows the same lines as the evolution in gender roles: a lax openness. A representative case is No. 18, in which the Renault Laguna automobile is promoted and a father appears as the sole caregiver for his son, without a partner; therefore, it could favour selective perception by the viewer to consider him as a gay man, heterosexual or bisexual. However, given the social context in which it is inserted, the advertiser's intention was probably simply to awaken the patriarchal protective instinct.\n\nFinally, the ad for the compilation album Rumba Total deserves a special mention. Although advertising about the transsexual collective is not the subject of this research, ad No. 19 is probably one of the first to allude to the LGBTIQ+ community in a clear way. In it, Cristina “La Veneno”, a popular transgender woman of the 1990s, is presented as the protagonist, and a play on words is made between the pack of songs offered and her genitalia, recreating the famous leg-crossing scene from the movie Basic Instinct.\n\nTaking into account the above and that during this decade the depathologization of gay men and lesbianism took place, we can conclude that during the decade there was also a relationship between social advances and advertising treatment.\n\n2000-2009: Normalization and acceptance at the social and legislative levels\n\nWith the arrival of the new millennium, the normalization of gender and sexual diversity in advertising is consolidated. For example, sexuality and nudity began to be shown more explicitly, without the need to use ambiguities as in previous decades. The approval of same-sex marriage coincided with a greater normalization, in advertising terms, of the imagery related to the collective.\n\nAs far as gender roles are concerned, the co-responsibility of household chores is fully achieved as far as their representation in advertising is concerned, going beyond the “aesthetic chores on camera” (cooking and taking care of the children, basically): one example, among others, is Bosch ad No. 22, which shows a man doing the ironing. In addition, equality is starting to move more in the direction of femvertising. Nevertheless, ads such as Heineken's (No. 24) continue to depict differences by gender: girls are interested in clothes and boys interested in beer.\n\nThese are turbulent times for reflecting family diversity in advertising. In a very clear way, there coexists an advertising that reflects the most traditional society and another “more transgressive” one that represents the social evolution regarding the gay men and lesbian collective. Thus, we find advertisements that, even though they are clearly endeavouring to reflect the variety of couples in love, as they see it, do not show gay and lesbian couples (advertisement No. 23, IKEA). Others directly sexualize relationships between women and objectify them (ad No. 21, Musicón del Verano). In the most extreme case, we find companies such as the communication group Intereconomia (No. 25) that punish the demands of the rights of the collective, using an advertising style that tries to instill “fear” ( ). That is to say, some advertisements are responsible for reflecting the discontent generated in part of the population by the approval of same-sex marriage.\n\nHowever, the majority do support an inclusive and diverse society. Therefore, in this instance, according to the spots in our sample there is not a complete relationship between advertising’s treatment of the gay men and lesbian community and the legislative framework.\n\n2010-2021: Current decade\n\nThe period 2010-2021 sees a notable increase in the number of appearances of gay men and lesbian couples and individuals in audiovisual advertising. However, although the growth is considerable compared to previous decades, the percentage with respect to the total number of advertisements (of a commercial nature) is still not very significant.\n\nBased on the content analysis, shows the congruence between historical contexts and advertising related to the gay men and lesbian community.\n\nFirst, it is worth noting the wide variety of products that include depictions of the gay men and lesbian collective. We find everything from dating apps to soft drinks and cleaning products; naturally, this diversity is reflected in the wide range of sectors present in the sample ( ). The sector that includes the most depictions of the gay men and lesbian community is beauty and hygiene (23.7%), followed by food and entertainment (18.42% each).\n\nThe research on slogans shows that reference is made to the gay men and lesbian collective depending on the tone of the advertisement. That is to say, if it has an educational or vindicatory function (as in the case of Burger King's ad No. 50 and La Sexta TV channel's ad No. 43), words that aim to empower the collective, such as “pride”, are usually included. The use of this type of slogan tends to have a seasonal character, being especially frequent during the LGBTIQ+ Pride celebration (end of June). However, there is another group of ads that simply integrate and normalize gay men and lesbian protagonists within the story told in the ad (for example, No. 28), so the slogan is usually related to the product ( ).\n\nRegarding the relationship between the representations of the gay men and lesbian community in the advertising spots and the fact that both were the target audience of the brands, we observed that gay men and lesbian couples and individuals are reflected in advertising regardless of whether or not they are the target. Specifically, only in 2 of the 38 cases that show situations or environments related to the collective, is sexuality a relevant segmentation criterion (spots Nos. 49 and 53). The rest are products aimed at the general public, of which gay men and lesbians are only a part.\n\nOn the other hand, the variable “explicitness of the message”, that is, the way in which the reference to the gay men and lesbian community is produced (whether directly or through ambiguities and double meanings) indicates that 71% of the ads in the sample do so explicitly. The words and expressions exchanged by the partners (dialogues showing mutual affection, use of romantic appellatives such as “sweetheart”, etc.) as well as the images (the way they look at each other, hug and kiss, for example) are the instrument for this. The remaining 29% of ads show the relationship between the protagonists in an ambiguous way. The main motivation to provoke this ambiguity is probably to favour a more selective perception, i.e. that the viewer is the one who assigns the label of “friends” or “couple” according to his or her reality. This issue leads us to evidence that the relationship between the characters is often ambiguous (No. 27, No. 48 and No. 54).\n\nAs for stereotypes, it is worth remembering that the three ways of expression are the storyline way (reproducing clichés about gay men and lesbians, such as promiscuity), the visual way (reproducing clichés about their clothing, appearance, gestures, etc) and the sound way (stereotypes about the way they speak and express themselves). The results show that we have gone from an almost total invisibilization in previous decades, to an inclusion of the collective made from respect, and with the absence of these clichés. Thus, the ads from this decade reflect a diverse family model. However, there is a discriminatory advertisement (spot No. 61), but it is an isolated and specific case ( ), therefore, the gay men and lesbian community as a sexual and amorous option ends up becoming visible and normalized.\n\nRegarding the types of couples represented, it is worth mentioning that we find a great diversity of ways of showing them: while in some spots only one typology is shown (for example, a gay couple), in others the range is wider and more diversity is shown (for example, gay men and lesbians and heterosexuals being co-protagonists). Specifically, in 47.37% of the ads, gay men and lesbian couples share space with heterosexual couples ( ).\n\nIn the same line, the distribution of percentages of the representation of traditional family models in the decades studied gives a concrete view on the evolution of openness to amorous diversity in the last targeted period (2010-2021). The traditional family and couple model is represented in 68% of ads while the diverse family and couple models appear only in 16% of ads in the years from 1960 to 2009. It should be emphasized that 16% of advertisements without a clear model are included. By contrast, the most contemporary era (2010-2021) evokes diverse family and couple models in 100% of cases.\n\nAnother noteworthy variable where there are contrasting data between decades is gender roles. First, the roles are well differentiated (totally or sufficiently) in earlier ads while in recent years, advertisers opt for portraying no differences in most of the cases ( ).\n\nIt can be determined that in the last decade analyzed, advertising is mostly related to social and legal changes in Spain in terms of affectionate relationships. Thus, a respectful inclusion of the gay men and lesbians collective is made, trying to reflect an increasingly common social reality, so that brands can address any type of consumer regardless of their sexual orientation."
