The fall has cost Millicent her memory, but at night she dreams of her former high society existence, while during the day she works for Gumpf as a pickpocket. Later, after becoming a match girl, her beauty attracts a cabaret manager, who makes her a singer and dancer in his disreputable establishment. A friend of the Hawthornes sees Millicent perform, recognizes her, and reports back to Mrs. Hawthorne, who has vowed to be a devoted mother should she ever find her daughter. Finally, after the Hawthornes rescue Millicent from Kraft, the lecherous cabaret manager, an operation restores her memory, and she delights in the love of her long-lost mother.",
