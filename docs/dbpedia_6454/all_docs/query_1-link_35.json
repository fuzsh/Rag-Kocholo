Working from a forgotten European play (as he so often did), Lubitsch establishes the parallels between two marriages—one beginning to fray (Viennese physician Monte Blue and his neglected wife Florence Vidor) and one in open rupture (professor Adolphe Menjou has hired a private detective to track his unfaithful wife, Marie Prevost, who has set her sights on Blue). Shifting his focus from the grand social canvases of his German films (Madame DuBarry, Carmen) to a handful of characters in drawing rooms brings out Lubitsch’s genius for synecdoche—the art of taking a part to express the whole. When sound came in, Lubitsch (in collaboration with George Cukor) remade The Marriage Circle as the musical One Hour with You in 1931. This new digital restoration of The Marriage Circle is based on a 35mm print in the Museum’s collection.\n\nPresented by Sid and Flo Banwart\n\nFeaturing LIVE piano accompaniment with Dr. Joshua Russell\n\nView Event →\n\nKeith Haring: Street Art Boy\n\nIn the 1980s Keith Haring blazed a trail through the galleries and nightclubs of downtown New York's art scene.

It tells the extraordinary story of an artist who lived and created with a boundless energy, throughout the social, cultural and political counter-revolution of the 1980s.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Cat and the Canary (1927)\n\nA Broadway hit that helped to launch the theatrical craze for “old dark house” thrillers, John Willard’s 1922 play was already starting to seem old hat by the time Universal acquired it in 1927. But Universal chief Carl Laemmle had the inspiration to send to Germany for Paul Leni, a promising young director who had blended the shadowy lighting and tortured perspectives of German Expressionism with more commercial material for his acclaimed Waxworks (1922). And so was born the look and feel of Universal’s classic horror films. Laura La Plante is the first-generation scream queen, a stylish young woman invited to a decaying mansion for the midnight reading of a will, along with half a dozen other scheming heirs and likely suspects.\n\nWhere previous restorations of The Cat and the Canary have been based on the B negative, composed of second-choice takes for release in Europe, this is the first to be based on the A negative used for the US release, and it makes a difference. Panels slide, curtains billow, hands clutch, and mysterious figures roam hidden corridors, all with renewed panache.\n\nPresented by Sid and Flo Banwart\n\nFeaturing LIVE piano accompaniment with Dr. Joshua Russell\n\nView Event →\n\nMartin Scorcese’s 1973 \"Mean Streets\"\n\n“Scorsese is exceptionally good at guiding his largely unknown cast to near-flawless recreations of types.

Negatives wear out from overuse, old prints are duped to create new ones, and image (and sound) quality are lost with every new analog generation. That’s long been the case with Charles Chaplin’s Mutual shorts, a series of 12 two-reel comedies that Chaplin made in 1916 and 1917. Considered by many to be Chaplin’s funniest, most formally accomplished work, the Mutual shorts have nearly been loved to death after over a century in constant circulation.\n\nMoMA’s new restoration of The Adventurer, the final and, for many, finest of the Mutuals, comes as a revelation. Assembled from seven different sources, almost all from the domestic A negative, often combining elements within a given shot, the MoMA restoration has a clarity and grain structure missing from the film for generations, and has been fitted with remade intertitles that match samples from original prints of other Mutual films. The film now looks—almost eerily—very much as it did when it first appeared on American screens.\n\nThe restoration was supervised by Peter Williamson, MoMA’s Film Conservation Manager, and Dave Kehr, Curator, Department of Film, and was carried out at Metropolis Post in New York City. We are especially grateful to Metropolis for their amazing work despite the COVID shutdowns.\n\nPresented by Sid and Flo Banwart\n\nFeaturing LIVE piano accompaniment with Dr. Joshua Russell\n\nView Event →\n\nSidney Lumet’s 1976 \"Network\"\n\n“This tale of a failing network that feeds on the mental breakdown of one of its anchors, cannibalising itself for ratings, feels as savagely relevant now as it did when it was released nearly 40 years ago.”\n\n-Times (UK)\n\nPart of a new cycle of Marc Eliot’s Art of Film, based on the American New Wave, Network is a mind-bending black comedy.

In a series of surreal, graceful, hilarious—and risky—gags unmatched in the history of cinema, rich and pampered nitwit Buster Keaton finds himself lost at sea with his would-be bride Kathryn McGuire, parrying with feisty swordfish, bloodthirsty cannibals, and the mother of all machine props: a vast deserted ocean liner.\n\nPresented by Sid and Flo Banwart\n\nFeaturing LIVE piano accompaniment with Dr. Joshua Russell\n\nView Event →\n\nIf\n\nFrom writer and director John Krasinski, IF is about a girl who discovers that she can see everyone's imaginary friends -- and what she does with that superpower -- as she embarks on a magical adventure to reconnect forgotten IFs with their kids.\n\nView Event →\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nAfter a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas).

In Daisy, all the Bardot magic and sex-kitten appeal are on full display. This little-seen-in-America film is a gem of ‘50s family-friendly French sex comedies The Los Angeles Times called it \"a most delightful, naughty and very funny comedy...Bardot strikes pure gold…it’s strictly a fun show that doesn't try to prove a thing.” See it and you will go home smiling, with an insatiable appetite for a glass of French champagne. Viva la cinema Français, et Viva La Bardot!\n\nView Event →\n\nAlexander Hall’s 1947 Down to Earth\n\nMarc Eliot’s Art of Film\n\nAlexander Hall’s 1947 Down to Earth\n\nThe sequel to Hall’s Here Comes Mr. Jordan, with several cast members from the original reappearing, including Edward Everett Horton and James Gleason. The film stars Rita Hayworth at her most glamorous and Larry Parks, best-known for his portrayal of Al Jolson in two biographical films that made Parks one of the biggest stars of the ‘40s. His career was cut short a few years later by the “blacklisting” hearings conducted by HUAC in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, one of the major tragedies of the studio era. Highly entertaining, this is a perfect Sunday brunch of a movie. Come see it!\n\nView Event →\n\nMichael Powell’s and Emeric Pressburger’s 1946 A Matter of Life and Death\n\nMarc Eliot’s Art of Film\n\nMichael Powell’s and Emeric Pressburger’s 1946 A Matter of Life and Death\n\nPowell and Pressburger’s ‘40s partnership (their best-known work is 1948’s classic The Red Shoes) represents the finest product of British Cinema produced in the immediate post-war years that preceded the arrival of that country's era of neo-realistic urban “kitchen sink” '50s films, spearheaded by the stage and screen work of John Osborne [no boldface anywhere in this email; something screwy in email-ed note]. Among the shamefully critical under-examination of London’s studio output of the ‘40s, A Matter of Life and Death stands out as one of the best films of its generation. A highly stylized, stiff-upper-lip treatment of a familiar Hollywood trope. The film stars David Niven, one of the so-called “Brit-Pack” of British ex-pats who found fame and fortune in American film, was also among of the few who returned to the homeland to enlist and serve in World War Two. He became a highly decorated English Army hero, a fan favorite and a future Academy Award winner for Best Actor (Delbert Mann’s 1958 Separate Tables). A Matter of Life and Death “borrows” heavily from both Victor Fleming’s 1939 The Wizard of Oz, and Hall’s 1941 Here Comes Mr. Jordan. If you’ve never seen it, this one is mandatory viewing (and incredibly entertaining). And if you have, see it again, if only for the escalator to heaven built at great expense for this production (the American release title was Stairway to Heaven, and served as the inspiration for the Led Zeppelin classic. There has simply never been a magical effect like it! Only marginally profitable, the film may have been too stylized for it’s time, but is, today, considered a classic of British Cinema.\n\nView Event →\n\nToy Story 2\n\nWoody (Tom Hanks) is stolen from his home by toy dealer Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight), leaving Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the gang to try to rescue him.

This is a great opportunity to compare the two versions. Beatty, at the height of his career, following his leap to superstardom after his appearance in Arthur Penn’s 1967 Bonnie and Clyde and in Hal Ashby’s 1975 Shampoo, produced, directed (with Buck Henry), wrote (with the legendary Elaine May), and cast his then-girlfriend, Julie Christie as his romantic interest in the role played by Evelyn Keyes in the original, the great character actor Jack Warden as “Max,” and Art of Film favorite James Mason as Mr. Jordan, played by Claude Rains in 1941. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, it won for Art Direction (Paul Sylbert, Edwin O’Donovan and George Gaines). From a $6 million budget, Heaven grossed a phenomenal $99 million in its initial release. A must-see chance to experience late ‘70s independent movie-making at its most expansive.\n\nView Event →\n\nAlexander Hall’s 1941 Here Comes Mr. Jordan\n\nMarc Eliot’s Art of Film\n\nAlexander Hall’s 1941 Here Comes Mr. Jordan\n\nOne of the most popular films of 1941, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of two, this clever satire won universal rave reviews, including from the New York Times: \"Columbia has assembled its brightest people for a delightful and totally disarming joke at heaven's expense…a gay, witty, tender and not a little wise. It is also one of the choicest comic fantasies of the year.”\n\nView Event →\n\nPortrait of Jason\n\nPaired with Diane Arbus’ A Box of 10 Photographs, participate in the dialogue between art and film and investigate topics like portraiture, personhood, and individuality.\n\nPortrait of Jason is a 1967 documentary film directed, produced and edited by Shirley Clarke and starring Jason Holliday (né Aaron Payne, 1924–1998).\n\nView Event →\n\nSilver Streak\n\nWhile on a cross-country train ride, overworked book editor George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) begins an unexpected romance with an enigmatic woman named Hilly Burns (Jill Clayburgh).
