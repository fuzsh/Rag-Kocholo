Transported back to 1999, the story follows Bo-ra navigating her friend’s crush on Baek Hyun-jin (Park Jung-woo), only to find herself unexpectedly drawn to Hyun-jin’s friend, Poong Woon-hoo (Byeon Woo-seok). As Bo-ra immerses herself in the whirlwind of teenage emotions, the film expertly balances humour with heartfelt sincerity, reflecting the naive yet earnest pursuit of young love.\n\nBo-ra’s character epitomizes the charming awkwardness and earnestness of adolescence, from her initial hesitation towards Woon-hoo’s aloof demeanour to the dizzying excitement of mutual affection blossoming under the cherry blossoms. The film’s brisk pacing mirrors the fleeting intensity of teenage emotions, capturing Bo-ra’s rapid shifts between elation and heartache as she navigates friendships, misunderstandings, and the rollercoaster of romantic entanglements.\n\nBeyond its narrative, ‘20th Century Girl’, immerses viewers in a rich ’90s tapestry, replete with VCRs, pagers, and cultural references that evoke a sense of era-specific nostalgia. The vibrant cinematography enhances this nostalgic ambience, vividly painting each scene with saturated hues and evocative visuals that mirror the vividness of adolescent memories.\n\nUltimately, ‘20th Century Girl’, transcends its period setting to offer a poignant reflection on the universal experience of first love. Through its endearing characters and resonant storytelling, the film invites audiences of all ages to reminisce about their youthful escapades and cherish the timeless allure of first love’s innocence and complexity.\n\n–Farheen Ali"
