        "text": "Vicky Kaushal powers through Bad Newz\n\nIt was the lure of Vicky Kaushal’s performance that drew me to the Regal Cinema in Atlanta to watch Bad Newz with my niece and nephew. I have liked Kaushal in every role he has essayed so far: the sensitive man in Manmarziyan, the thoughtful husband embroiled in intrigue in Raazi, or the lovelorn man in Dunki. I was eager to see him transform into the alpha male in Bad Newz, and I wasn’t disappointed. But the film fails to create the same buzz as its spiritual predecessor, Good Newwz.\n\nDirected by Anand Tiwari and produced by Amazon Prime, Dharma Productions, and Leo Media Collective, the 2024 Hindi-language comedy revolves around Akhil Chaddha (Vicky Kaushal), a quintessential Delhi guy who falls in love with Saloni (Triptii Dimri), a chef aspiring to culinary greatness. Their marital journey takes unexpected turns, leading to a divorce. Saloni eventually finds herself entangled with Gurbir (Ammy Virk), and soon after with her “repentant ex-husband”, resulting in a pregnancy where both Akhil and Gurbir are prospective fathers due to heteropaternal superfecundation, a rare biological phenomenon that occurs when a woman becomes pregnant with twins from different fathers. The narrative primarily focuses on the comedic chaos that ensues as they navigate this unconventional situation.\n\nVadda Punjabi puttar turns sensitive husband\n\nVicky Kaushal portrays a macho Punjabi puttar from Karol Bagh – “Akhil Chaddha sab se vadda” – a spoilt mama’s boy who flirts freely at a wedding to borrow a safety pin for his mother’s saree pallu. His transformation into a buff Greek God emerging from the blue waters of Dubrovnik, a dumbstruck mime upon losing his phone, a super-competitive beau, and finally a sensitive husband and good human being who accepts his wife’s decision to embrace twins, showcases his larger-than-life persona and effortless charm. And not to miss is his grand finale slick dance number Tauba Tauba, an internet sensation these days.\n\nAmmy Virk as Gurbir lacks Diljit Dosanjh’s effervescent energy in Good Newwz, but impresses with his reticent demeanor, shy smile, and endearing lines. Gurbir is certainly a yang to Akhil’s yin.\n\nBad Newz for Tripti Dimri’s Saloni\n\nTriptii Dimri’s character leans heavily on her physical appeal and fresh wide-eyed look rather than her aspirations to become a professional chef. Her husband Akhil’s indifference towards her career goal to attain a “Meraki” (Michelin) star leaves her tongue-tied in front of critical customers and culinary judges, portraying her as unnecessarily helpless. The comedy bit about the incompatibility of vegetarians versus chicken lovers may seem moronic, yet it rings true even in today’s age. Nostalgic and funny moments between Akhil and Gurbir, stuck together like Tom and Jerry in a shared room with Mere mehboob mere sanam score, add hilarity to their too-close-for-comfort parodic situation. However, not all jokes land like they did in Good Newwz, leaving me yearning for Akshay Kumar’s senseless mirth and Diljit Dosanjh’s unrestrained energy.\n\nFunny in parts\n\nBad Newz was engaging in the first half (although some boudoir scenes felt contrived); there were some genuinely funny moments. However, the film lost steam in the second half, becoming somewhat tedious before finding its emotional core towards the climax, where Akhil has to make a “grown-up” decision for the sake of everyone involved in this rare twin pregnancy.\n\nRegardless of the palpable sex appeal of Vicky Kaushal who propels the film through and through, the potential for a riotous comedy is not fully realized. Ananya Pande’s cameo does not add to the movie. The good news, however, is the portrayal of the socially emancipated modern Indian man – both fathers accept their “out-of-wedlock” babies with aplomb. The movie pays homage to Dharma Productions more than once, aiming to evoke nostalgia, a marketing gimmick done well. Bad Newz is worth watching once in theaters."
