        "text": "Nothing says swashbuckling quite like Errol Flynn swinging on a vine through Sherwood Forest. Growing up we had this movie on VHS—yes, that’s how old I am—and I would watch it on Saturday mornings and then manually rewind it and watch it again. Directed by Michael Curtiz, perhaps better known for a little film called Casablanca, and one in a series of delightful adventure romps featuring Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, this technicolor treat really hits all the bases.—Chloe Malle\n\nSinging in the Rain (1952)\n\nThere’s so much to love in this classic: the “Moses Supposes” song (teach your toddler to talk with that!), Gene Kelly and Debby Reynolds’s supreme tap dancing, and that’s before you get to Donald O’Connor’s wall-climbing adventures. And the hidden weapon: a song you can pull out to make accidentally getting stuck at the playground in a rainstorm into a happy adventure. I’ve tried to interest my kids in all kinds of musicals from the cannon—this is the one that has held their attention the best. And it’s given them a slice of Hollywood history to boot.—Chloe Schama\n\nSnoopy, Come Home (1972)\n\nOf all the movie-musicals that I watched and loved growing up—Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Oliver!—John Huston’s Annie deserves a special mention for three reasons. First, it has a little-girl protagonist and some wonderful dog acting. Second, its musical numbers are still very exciting. (“Hard-Knock Life”! “I Think I’m Gonna Like It Here”! “Let’s Go to the Movies”!!) Third, it introduced me to Ann Reinking, Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry, all at the same time. (If you’re like, What? Should kids today know who those people are? My answer to you is yes. No further questions!)—MM\n\nThe Secret of NIMH (1982)\n\nNo one made a better run at dislodging Disney’s animated-film hegemony in the 1980s than Don Bluth. (You probably don’t remember that this was the era of The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron.) In 1982 Bluth and his cadre of fellow Disney defectors made The Secret of NIMH, in which a society of genetically altered rats possessing human-level intelligence comes to the aid of a single-mother mouse whose family is threatened by civilization. Based on a 1971 children’s novel and rejected first by Disney (the company said they already had a mouse), it’s an entirely absorbing, emotionally authentic, and visually rich tale that doesn’t shy away from darker aspects, while very stealthily promulgating principles of mutual aid, community organizing, redistribution of wealth, and the wisdom of elders. Dom DeLuise provides the comic relief as a ditzy, lovelorn crow, paving the way for Robin Williams’s and Eddie Murphy’s star turns as loudmouth Disney-cartoon sidekicks. Four years later, Bluth teamed with Steven Spielberg to bring to life the story of another mouse with gumption—An American Tail, then the highest-grossing non-Disney animated movie ever—followed by 1988’s hit The Land Before Time. Disney felt threatened enough that it released The Little Mermaid the next year, kicking off the Disney Renaissance for the next decade.—Lisa Wong Macabasco\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nThis one almost speaks for itself: There is the cast, which includes Brandy, Whitney Houton, Victor Garber, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Alexander, and—once again—Bernadette Peters. There is the sweeping Rodgers and Hammerstein score, which is (controversial opinion?) so much better than the one in Disney’s 1950 version, lovely as that is. Also, the costumes and set pieces are completely ridiculous. It’s just wholesome, romantic (and racially diverse!) fun at its very finest.—MM\n\nEver After (1998)\n\nAs Danielle De Barbarac, Drew Barrymore breathes new life into the classic tale of Cinderella in this Renaissance-era French iteration. The evil stepmother is deliciously played by Anjelica Huston and her two daughters, by Melanie Lynskey and Megan Dodds as they scheme to win Prince Henry’s heart. With a postmodern feminist approach, a new story is born, and with it fantastical costumery. Who can forget the long-awaited ball scene where Danielle reveals herself to the court in all her winged splendor? Last year marked the movie’s 25th anniversary, and to celebrate, Barrymore invited the cast to reminisce on an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show. Old relics from the film were presented to the audience, including a certain pair of bejeweled slippers created by Salvatore Ferragamo.—LS\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nOverheard in the Vogue offices: “I legitimately thought that Lindsay Lohan was two actors when I saw this movie.” After the early aughts antics, the recent second act as rom-com star, and everything in between, you can be forgiven for forgetting that Lindsay Lohan was a supremely talented child actor. Case in point: The Parent Trap. When I recently watched this with my kids, I was prepared to interject a million comparisons to the original Hayley Mills vehicle, but this update holds its own. (Dare I say it, it might even be better.) The story of two identical twins who are separated soon after birth when their parents divorce and are then accidentally reunited at summer camp, the premise is not exactly believable. But Lohan sells it. The film is also sort of a lush set piece; with the dad’s northern California winery aesthetic juxtaposed against the prim formalism of the mom’s London sitting rooms. Both are meticulously designed and a feast for parental eyes.—CS\n\nSpirited Away (2001)\n\nWhat if the sky rained gumballs? In Bedtime Stories it does, and it’s just one of the many fantastical happenings that Uncle Skeeter speaks into existence in his stories while watching his sister’s kids. Played by the painfully goofy Adam Sandler, Skeeter is a hotel handyman and a funcle (fun uncle) of the highest order—he introduces his niece, nephew, and their guinea pig Bugsy to the wonder that is the hamburger. Everything Sandler says and does is over the top, but through the eyes of a child, this movie is pure comedy.—AJB\n\nCoraline (2009)\n\nWhen the world of kid-friendly scary movies beckons, Coraline is the perfect entry point. An adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novella, it’s about an 11-year-old girl transplanted by her parents to a rickety old house in Oregon with bizarre tenants, a rambunctious neighborhood boy, and a stray cat with wisdom to share. When Coraline is lured through a secret compartment she encounters a parallel universe that is as eerie and unsettling as it is gorgeously and dangerously seductive.—TA\n\nUp (2009)\n\nOkay, let’s get this out of the way: Up is not a great film. After the first 20 minutes, the premise of this Pixar movie is a bit weird: It’s about an elderly guy (Carl) who travels to South America (in a floating house, hence the “up”) with a Boy Scout-like figure, where they meet a bird being pursued by a wicked explorer. But within those first minutes, which condense Carl’s life, specifically his romance and marriage to his now deceased wife, into a speechless montage of poignant moments, is one of the most moving sequences in all of cinema—animated or not. The story may be a bit goofy, but the emotional resonance of those first scenes make the film one to watch and re-watch.—CS\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon (2010)\n\nThis is the first in a trilogy of fantasy adventures that offer brilliantly kinetic entertainment. I confess that I liked these movies even more than my kids did—but they were agreeably swept away. The aerial sequences are breathtaking and the story is genuinely affecting, encompassing themes of friendship, overcoming disability, and old-fashioned heroism.—TA\n\nPacific Rim (2013)\n\nAt some point you and your kid may get unduly interested in mecha, a category of manga and anime in which large armored machines piloted by humans do battle with devastating monsters, or Godzilla-like kaiju. The genre offers true riches (do not show your child Neon Genesis Evangelion; watch it yourself), and for my son and me, the classic text is the rock ’em sock ’em silliness that is Pacific Rim, a decade-old mecha–Hollywood crossover action film that has the color palate of Blade Runner and the IQ of Sharknado. There is pedigree here. The director is none other than Guillermo del Toro, in full goofy, lowbrow, genre-filmmaking mode. My son’s number-one movie of all time.—TA\n\nPaddington (2014) and Paddington 2 (2017)\n\nEvery once in a while a children’s movie wildly outperforms parents’ expectations—and the best example of this happy phenomenon may be the Paddington movies, from 2014 and 2017. Crisp, comedic, warm-hearted, and British to the hilt, these two wise-and-wonderful joyrides feature the lovable bear from “Darkest Peru,” and a perfectly cast West London family (imagine Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins as your parents!) that desperately needs him, and vice versa. Stealth weapons in both films are the villains: Nicole Kidman as the taxidermist Millicent Clyde and Hugh Grant (unbelievably good) as stage actor Phoenix Buchanan.—TA\n\nMinions (2015)\n\nI have to admit it: Whenever my kids fired up Minions, which used to be just about every other day, I was tempted to park myself beside them and watch. Minions is officially a prequel to the Despicable Me series (which is itself excellent), but for my money it’s the central text: smart and irresistible in its combination of cuteness and anarchic comedy. I could never keep Kevin, Stuart, or Bob straight in my head, but to my kids they were distinctly foolish mischief makers who speak in tongues and need a super villain to give their lives meaning. The whole thing is fun and lovable but the opening backstory depicting minions bumbling through history—from the dinosaurs to Napoleon—is nothing short of genius.—TA\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nPixar’s animated fantasy tells a story about Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) and his secret love for music despite his family’s mysterious objection. It’s impossible to pull your eyes away from the stunning technicolor scenery where Mexico’s lush culture sits center stage. We follow Miguel on his spiritual Día de los Muertos journey through the Land of the Dead to find his idol, the “greatest musician of all time,” Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). The award-winning film won the Oscars for best animated feature and best song (for “Un Poco Loco”). The film took six years to complete with 7 million lights in one scene alone. Let out your best grito and get ready for an adventure that’s a feast for the eyes and music to your ears.—LS\n\nMy Octopus Teacher (2020)\n\nAnother unlikely documentary that actually is a fantastic watch for the whole family. There’s something about the single-mindedness of this film, the way its subject doggedly pursues knowledge of and friendship with a creature from another species, that will speak to any child engaged—in his mind or otherwise—with creatures of the natural world. There’s a bittersweet ending, but an important lesson in the octopus’s eventual death. I found this to be a poetic and beautiful way to engage my children in the natural world.—CS\n\nSoul (2020)\n\nJazz pianist Joe Gardner, played by Jamie Foxx, finds himself tumbling into a wayward chasm of the afterlife named the “Great Beyond” following a spill down an open manhole in New York City. After trying to escape to earth, Gardner gets misdirected to the “Great Before,” where he’s assigned to a cynical soul named 22 (Tina Fey) to help find her “spark.” A series of mishaps brings them back to earth in the wrong bodies, and the two are set on a roundabout journey to discover what it means to truly live. The motion picture took home an Oscar for best animated feature at the 93rd Academy Awards. As the first feature-length movie to win without a theatrical release (due to the pandemic), it’s worth a stream on Disney+ if you haven’t yet seen it. Be forewarned, it’s a tearjerker.—LS\n\nLuca (2020)\n\nThis Pixar-animated coming-of-age fantasy about a brave little sea monster named Luca (Jacob Tremblay) and his budding friendships with land dwellers Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Giulia (Emma Berman) is pure Italian seaside eye candy. We meet an unlikely team enamored with the idea of winning the local town’s Portorosso Cup triathlon to get a shiny new Vespa. Inspired by director Enrico Casarosa’s summer adventures in Genoa, the film gives us a glimpse of what vintage 1950s Italy would look like if local folklore came to life. A true blue and scaly green reminder to “Silenzio, Bruno!” and take chances because you never know what you may find on the other side.—LS\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On (2021)\n\nThis is one of those rarities that will appeal to different ages on different levels. Yes, lots of Pixar films are full of jokes that are intended for the grown ups, but this one, from A24, works on everyone purely through its imaginative ingenuity. To some it’s a simple story of a shell with shoes; to me it’s a fable of fortitude and belonging. You get the idea: there’s a range. And then there’s just the hilarious premise of it all, a delightful excursion into Jenny Slate’s bizarrely brilliant mind. Don’t be dissuaded by the documentary-style framing; my kids honestly didn’t even register it, and loved it nonetheless.—CS\n\nEncanto (2021)\n\nSet in the emerald mountains of Colombia, Encanto introduces us to the enchanted Madrigal household via Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), a precocious teen who didn’t seem to inherit the same powers as the rest of her family. Their charmed lives start to wear off when their mythical casita starts to show its cracks. Sprinkled with original songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the film takes us on a captivating adventure through the jungle, uncovering family truths along the way. The film won an Oscar for best animated feature and best original score. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” still rings in our ears, having surpassed “Let It Go” as the highest-charting Disney song in 26 years. No doubt about it: This one deserves a spot on the best movies for kids list.—LS\n\nBetter Nate Than Ever (2022)\n\nHigh School Musical writer Tim Federle’s joyful directorial debut came with a buoyant message—one sure to appeal to kids who love theater, dance, and musicals, in particular. The action kicks off when Nate (Rueby Wood), an exuberant seventh-grade boy who lives in Pittsburgh and dreams of starring on Broadway, doesn’t get a part in the school play. Spurred on by his disappointment, he escapes with his one-and-only friend on an overnight bus to Manhattan to follow his dreams. Of course, hilarity and big lessons ensue, especially when the ever-amusing Lisa Kudrow, who plays Nate’s struggling-actress aunt, enters the scene. Heartwarming and inspiring, the family comedy offers a refreshing stance on what it means to be yourself. You’ll definitely find yourself doing jazz hands as Nate sings his way through Times Square, figuring it all out.—Christina Pérez\n\nElemental (2023)\n\nThe elements of earth, air, fire, and water are at the center of almost every ancient philosophical system—as well as this endearing Pixar rom-com. It’s a classic tale of two kids from different cultures who meet-cute and fall in love, but under the scrupulous direction of Peter Sohn, the age-old storyline manages to feel fresh: she’s a “fire,” he’s a “water,” and in their segregated hometown of Elemental City, never the two shall mix. Of course, they do—and what follows is a poignant romp that deftly navigates universal, timely issues: family dynamics, cultural bias, racial differences, emotional intelligence, mental health, inclusion, social status, and individual empowerment. The gags are fun, plentiful, and clever; the animation is trippy, colorful, and immersive; and the final takeaway is exactly as uplifting as you hope it will be—not to mention downright charming. —CP"
