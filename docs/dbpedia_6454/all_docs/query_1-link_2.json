While Dulcie pines for Harry, her grocery boy sweetheart back home in Virginia, Aunt Netta triumphantly arranges an engagement with a wealthy, much older suitor, who claims to be a count. On her wedding day, as she prepares to sacrifice herself for her family, Dulcie discovers that her fiancé's millions actually belong to other people when he is arrested at the altar for bank robbery. Meanwhile, Harry, who has come West to get Dulcie back, arrives at the wedding in time and volunteers to take the arrested fiancé's place. Dulcie instantly accepts his offer.",
