        "text": "Nancy Anne Allen was born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City, the youngest of three children. Her father, Eugene Allen, was a New York police lieutenant. At a young age, she trained for a dancing career at the High School of Performing Arts, and then attended Jose Quintano's School for Young Professionals. In dozens of television commercials from the age of 15, Nancy made her first film appearance in Das letzte Kommando (1973) with Jack Nicholson. Three years later, she furnished the standard for all future bitch-goddess teenagers as Chris Hargensen in Stephen King's Carrie: Des Satans jüngste Tochter (1976), taken to the big screen by director Brian De Palma. Nancy then married De Palma in 1979. She next appeared in Steven Spielberg's I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978); for the next few years, she appeared only in De Palma's films: Home Movies - Wie du mir, so ich dir (1979), Dressed to Kill (1980), and she starred with John Travolta in Blow Out - Der Tod löscht alle Spuren (1981).\n\nAfter her divorce from De Palma in 1984, Nancy's film opportunities were supposedly narrowed, but then she surprised the whole world when she performed as Officer Anne Lewis in the sci-fi cult film RoboCop (1987), along with Peter Weller. Here, she furnished another standard as a tough but at the same time feminine policewoman, whose sex would not interfere with her actions. After the success of Robocop (1987), she performed as Patricia Gardner in the second sequel Poltergeist III - Die dunkle Seite des Bösen (1988). She came back in RoboCop 2 (1990) and in order to get more involved with her character, Nancy learned martial arts and police training for real. She returned again in RoboCop 3 (1993), though her co-star Peter Weller did not this time. In 1993, Nancy joined several other veteran stars in Rosen sind tot (1993), and married co-star Craig Shoemaker, in the same year. A few years later, she divorced Craig and some time after she married again.\n\nShe later appeared in some diverse films: Dusting Cliff 7 (1997), Secret of the Andes (1998), Circuit (2001), and she had a guest appearance in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight (1998). Her last performance was for the television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), in the episode \"Escape\" aired on December 2, 2003. Allen has appeared in a number of documentaries about her most famous films, including Dressed to Kill (1980), Carrie (1976), Blow Out (1981), Poltergeist III (1988), and the RoboCop trilogy. She also hosted Andrew J. Kuehn's horror film documentary Terror im Parkett (1984), along with Donald Pleasence.\n\nInterested in projecting the image of a strong but at the same time feminine woman, she managed to get away from the victim roles she was always offered, she also was able to get away from the stereotype of the beautiful but dumb woman in most action films. She is an environmentalist that traded her Volvo car for an Hybrid car in order to furnish the example. She is also an activist against breast cancer along with her friend actress Wendie Jo Sperber, who created the foundation WeSpark. Her last appearance on television was on the Inside E! story of her co-star John Travolta and the A&E Biography of Travolta - both appearances in 2004. Nowadays, Allen lives a quiet life along with her family and friends somewhere in the United States.\n\nMulti-talented, multi-award-winning actress Kathleen (Doyle) Bates was born on June 28, 1948, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. She is the youngest of three girls born to Bertye Kathleen (Talbot), a homemaker, and Langdon Doyle Bates, a mechanical engineer. Her grandfather was author Finis L. Bates. Kathy has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry, and one of her ancestors, an Irish emigrant to New Orleans, once served as President Andrew Jackson's doctor.\n\nKathy discovered acting appearing in high school plays and studied drama at Southern Methodist University, graduating in 1969. With her mind firmly set, she moved to New York City in 1970 and paid her dues by working everything from a cash register to taking lunch orders. Things started moving quickly up the ladder after giving a tour-de-force performance alongside Christopher Walken at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in Lanford Wilson's world premiere of \"Lemon Sky\" in 1970, but she also had a foreshadowing of the heartbreak to come after the successful show relocated to New York's off-Broadway Playhouse Theatre without her and Walken wound up winning a Drama Desk award.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, Kathy was treading the boards frequently as a rising young actress of the New York and regional theater scene. She appeared in \"Casserole\" and \"A Quality of Mercy\" (both 1975) before earning exceptional reviews for her role of Joanne in \"Vanities\". She took her first Broadway curtain call in 1980's \"Goodbye Fidel,\" which lasted only six performances. She then went directly into replacement mode when she joined the cast of the already-established and highly successful \"Fifth of July\" in 1981.\n\nKathy made a false start in films with Taking Off (1971), in which she was billed as \"Bobo Bates\". She didn't film again until Stunde der Bewährung (1978), starring Dustin Hoffman, and that part was not substantial enough to cause a stir. Things turned hopeful, however, when Kathy and the rest of the female ensemble were given the chance to play their respective Broadway parts in the film version of Robert Altman's Komm' zurück, Jimmy Dean (1982). It was a juicy role for Kathy and film audiences finally started noticing the now 34-year-old.\n\nStill and all, it was the New York stage that continued to earn Kathy awards and acclaim. She was pure textbook to any actor studying how to disappear into a role. Her characters ranged from free and life-affirming to downright pitiable. Despite winning a Tony Award nomination and Outer Critic's Circle Award for her stark, touchingly sad portrait of a suicidal daughter in 1983's \"'night, Mother\" and the Obie and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for her powerhouse job as a romantic misfit in \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,\" Kathy had no box-office pull, however, and was never a strong consideration when the roles transferred to the screen. Her award-winning stage went to established film stars. First Sissy Spacek took over her potent role as the suicidal Jessie Cates in 'Nacht Mutter (1986), then Michelle Pfeiffer seized the moment to play her dumpy lover character in Frankie und Johnny (1991). It would take Oscar glory to finally rectify the injustice.\n\nIt was Kathy's fanatical turn as the drab, chunky, porcine-looking psychopath Annie Wilkes, who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) and subjects him to a series of horrific tortures, that finally turned the tide for her in Hollywood. With the 1990 shocker Misery (1990), based on the popular Stephen King novel, Bates and Caan were box office magic. Moreover, Kathy captured the \"Best Actress\" Oscar and Golden Globe award, a first in that genre (horror) for that category. To add to her happiness she married Tony Campisi, also an actor, in 1991.\n\nQuality film scripts now started coming her way and the 1990s proved to be a rich and rewarding time for her. First, she and another older \"overnight\" film star, fellow Oscar winner Jessica Tandy, starred together in the modern portion of the beautifully nuanced, flashback period piece Grüne Tomaten (1991). She then outdid herself as the detached and depressed housekeeper accused of murdering her abusive husband (David Strathairn) in Dolores (1995). Surprisingly, she was left out of the Oscar race for these two excellent performances. Not so, however, for her flashy political advisor Libby Holden in the movie Mit aller Macht (1998), receiving praise and a \"Best Supporting Actress\" nomination.\n\nKathy has continued to work prolifically on TV as a 14-time Emmy winner or nominee thus far. She has also taken to directing a couple of TV-movies on the sly. As most actors, she has been in hit and miss TV shows. On the hit side, she has earned a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Jay Leno's manager playing tough politics in The Late Shift - Spätvorstellung (1996) and played to the hilt the cruel-minded orphanage operator, Miss Hannigan, in Annie - Weihnachten einer Waise (1999) for which she also earned an Emmy nom. She has done some eye-catching, offbeat turns on regular series such as Six Feet Under - Gestorben wird immer (2001) (for which she also earned a DGA award for helming an episode), Das Büro (2005), Harry's Law (2011) and especially American Horror Story (2011) for which she won an Emmy as Ethel Darling. She also won an Emmy for a guest episode on the hit sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003).\n\nInteresting millennium filming have included a Catholic school's Mother Superior in the comic drama Bruno (2000); Jesse James' mother in American Outlaws (2001); a quirky, liberal mom in About Schmidt (2002) for which she earned another \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination; a brief but potent turn as Gertrude Stein in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011); Queen Victoria in the adventurous remake of In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004); wacky parent types in the comedies Zum Ausziehen verführt (2006) and Relative Strangers (2006); Mother Claus in the seasonal farce Die Gebrüder Weihnachtsmann (2007); an over-gushy foster mother in the dramedy Gilly Hopkins - Eine wie keine (2015); and a wrenching performance as the mother of a suspected terrorist in Der Fall Richard Jewell (2019) for which she earned her third \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination.\n\nDivorced from husband Campisi since 1997, Kathy has been the Executive Committee Chair of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors.\n\nThe native New Yorker was born Bonnie Bedelia Culkin on March 25, 1948, the daughter of Phillip Harley Culkin, a journalist, and Marian Ethel Wagner Culkin, a writer and editor. Trained in ballet, her parents guided all of the children at one time or another into acting (which included Kit Culkin, Terry Culkin and Candace Culkin). Bonnie herself attended Quintano School for Young Professionals in New York at one point and Bonnie and Kit went on to appear on the local stage and TV. Brother Kit would later be known more for siring a handful of talented child actors and/or stars (Macaulay Culkin, Kieran Culkin, and the rest).\n\nIt was Bonnie who was first spotted among the other acting siblings by a talent scout who happened to catch her in a school production of \"Tom Sawyer\", and encouraged her. She made her professional debut at age 9 in a 1957 North Jersey Playhouse production of \"Dr. Praetorius\" and then was handed a full scholarship to study at George Balanchine's New York City Ballet. But the acting bug had bitten and after dancing in only four productions (including playing the role of Clara in \"The Nutcracker\"), she decided to hang up her ballet slippers. She proceeded to study at both the HB Studio and Actors Studio in New York.\n\nBonnie nabbed a five-year role as young teen \"Sandy Porter\" in the New York-based daytime soap Love of Life (1951) starting in 1961. During that time, she took her first Broadway bow in \"Isle of Children\", a show that lasted but a week in March of 1962. She was also a replacement in the established hit comedy \"Enter Laughing\", a year later. After appearing in the stage play \"The Playroom\" in 1965, she earned strong reviews for her touching performance in \"My Sweet Charlie\", for which she won the 1967 Theatre World Award for \"promising new artist\". In it, she played a pregnant young Southern girl on the lam with a black lawyer. Patty Duke recreated the role a few years later on TV and captured an Emmy.\n\nFilms beckoned at this point and Bonnie made her debut lending topnotch support in Die den Hals riskieren (1969) which reunited Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953) stars Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. She earned even better marks in her next two films, one performance simply haunting and the other one hilarious. Once again playing pregnant and once again delivering a touching pathos, she played the dirt-poor marathon dancer who pitches songs for pennies and the almost-mother of Bruce Dern's child in the superb, award-winning, Depression-era drama Nur Pferden gibt man einen Gnadenschuß (1969). On the other end of the acting spectrum, she played the lovable bride-to-be in the side-splitting comedy classic Liebhaber und andere Fremde (1970).\n\nBy this time, Bonnie had started concentrating on family values. She married scriptwriter Ken Luber on April 24, 1969, and bore him a son, Yuri, the following year. The time off to focus on motherhood (she had second son, Jonah Luber, in 1976) proved detrimental to her rising star. The remaining decade was uneventful at best, despite some fine showings in a splattering of TV-movies. Her big comeback came again on the movie trail in the early 1980s when she absolutely nailed the role of race car driver Shirley Muldowney in ...und wenn der letzte Reifen platzt (1983). She was surprisingly overlooked at Oscar time, however, despite the praise she received. Despite respected work in subsequent movies such as Liebe ist nur eine Illusion (1986), Der Prinz von Pennsylvania (1988), Aus Mangel an Beweisen (1990) and a running role as Bruce Willis's put-upon wife in Stirb langsam (1988) and its sequel, she found better and more frequent parts on TV. She found her niche in TV-movies with social themes and tugged at more hearts in Babyswitch - Kind fremder Eltern (1991), Nimm die Hände von unserer Tochter (1992), Söhne (1997) and Ein zweites Leben (1998).\n\nIn a change of pace, Bonnie joined the ensemble cast of the low-budget cult comedy Sordid Lives (2000), as \"Latrelle\", a homophobic woman dealing with her mother's death, the imprisonment of her gay brother and her own son's \"coming out\". The movie evolved into the TV series Sordid Lives: The Series (2008) which reunited her with original cast members Leslie Jordan and Olivia Newton-John. She repeated her role again in still another film -- A Very Sordid Wedding (2017).\n\nMore recent independent movie credits include Berkeley (2005), Secret Links (2016), The Scent of Rain & Lightning (2017), A Stone in the Water (2019). She also managed a few regular TV series roles: Lady Cops - Knallhart weiblich (2001) as a police captain, and Parenthood (2010) as a family matriarch opposite Craig T. Nelson.\n\nDivorced from the father of her two children, she is presently married to third husband (or fourth, depending on your source of reference) actor Michael MacRae, whom she married in 1995.\n\nMany actors have attempted to crack both genres of drama and comedy. Few have succeeded, among them the genial Andre Braugher (pronounced 'Ahn-drey Braw-ger'). A two-time Emmy Award winner, he is especially remembered for two seminal roles: as the intense, often explosive Detective Frank Pembleton (signature character in the first six seasons of NBC's gritty drama Homicide (1993)), and, in stark contrast, as droll, deadpan father figure Captain Ray Holt in eight seasons of the hilarious spoof Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013). The latter got him nominated for another four Primetime Emmys as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. What made the Holt character special was Braugher's unerringly perfect comic timing, great punchlines and moments of endearing pathos.\n\nA Chicago native, Braugher was an alumnus of Stanford University and a 1988 Juillard graduate with a Master of Fine Arts degree. Originally a Shakespearean actor (noted for his portrayal of Henry V on the New York stage), he debuted on screen in the Civil War drama Glory (1989), as an erudite corporal, the first volunteer to enlist in one of the Union Army's African-American regiments. His inaugural portrayal of a police officer was as Kojak's sidekick, Detective Winston Blake, in a slew of made-for-TV movies. From there, Braugher became a popular casting choice for determined, no-nonsense authority types. To name but a few: Lt. Col. Benjamin O. Davis, commanding officer of Die Ehre zu fliegen - Tuskegee Airmen (1995); Detective Satch de Leon in Frequency (2000); General Hager, who falls victim to arch villain Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007); Army General George Mancheck in Andromeda: Tödlicher Staub aus dem All (2008), the miniseries; the Secretary of State in Salt (2010). Then there was, of course, his defining role in Homicide, as the compelling, intense interrogation expert Frank Pembleton.\n\nBraugher had a leading non-military role as an angel named Cassiel (no, not Castiel!) in the romantic fantasy Stadt der Engel (1998), starring Nicolas Cage. He then headlined as the title character in the medical drama Gideon's Crossing (2000), loosely based on the career of a real-life professor of medicine, Jerome Groopman. His performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination. Braugher next co-starred in Die Straßen von Philadelphia (2002), another crime drama, in which he played a Philadelphia cop who aids his former partner (David Morse), who, after having left the force under a cloud, has turned into a hero vigilante.\n\nFor once on the wrong side of the law, he starred as a master criminal in the acclaimed miniseries Thief - Der Millionenjob (2006) for which he won an Emmy for Outstanding Performance by a Lead Actor. His first major foray into comedy was with Men of a Certain Age (2009), the story of three friends, each experiencing their own mid-life crisis. Braugher's character (Owen) was an angst-ridden diabetic father who hated his job as a car dealer. This was yet another strong performance which resulted in two further Emmy nominations, perhaps because Braugher abandoned his stock-in-trade authoritarian persona by playing someone insecure and vulnerable. He explained in another interview on Today, that he needed new challenges in order to grow as an artist.\n\nIt also set the scene for his famous role as Raymond Holt on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Curiously, the actor remained oddly reticent and self-deprecating about his comedic prowess. He confessed to an interviewer that he considered himself merely \"a voyeur at the funny person's table\". Yet, some of the show's funniest moments arise from Holt's relationships: those with his team (an excellent ensemble cast led by Andy Samberg (the Halloween specials rock!), with his partner Kevin (played by the very funny Marc Evan Jackson, who also featured memorably in Michael Schur's other off-beat comedy hit, The Good Place (2016)) and with his corgi named Cheddar.\n\nAndre Braugher's unexpected death on December 11, 2023, at the age of 61, was a great loss to the entertainment industry.\n\nSteve Byers was born in Ontario Canada. He began acting while attending Unionville School for the Arts. He got his feet wet with parts in film and television in shows like La Femme Nikita and the feature Slapshot 2. He first became a star name in his home country, when he landed the lead role in the series, Falcon Beach, playing the character Jason Tanner for ABC. After three seasons, he then moved on to star in the short-lived drama, Wild Roses, and then a turn as the infamous nemesis to Superman, Desaad in the CW classic Smallville. Steve also worked on blockbuster features such as Immortals for Relativity and Total Recall starring Colin Farrell for Columbia Pictures. Byers was later handed a CSA Award nomination for his lead role in the Netflix hit Slasher where he played double duty as the tortured Cam Henry and The Executioner. Byers is known internationally for his portrayal of Lawrence Klemm in Man In The High Castle for Amazon Studios and as Andrew Underhill on the Freeform hit Shadowhunters. Steve has worked on many \"tentpole\" productions while also keeping involved with independent films such as Peter: The Redemption where he starred alongside John Rhys-Davies. In 2015, he starred opposite Danny Glover and Dominic Purcell in the action film, Gridlocked and in 2017, he reunited with Nina Dobrev in Columbia Pictures Flatliners. In 2019 Steve was cast in a \"bucket list\" role and convincingly portrayed the legendary hockey icon Gordie Howe in the film Goalie.\n\nIn 2019, he starred in the dramatic film Amish Abduction where he tackles the role of Jacob, a tortured soul seeking a life outside the confines of the Amish world. He has also become recognized for his performance capture work in the ever expanding video game world. His character Nick Rye in the Far Cry franchise being one of his most lauded and recognizable to date."
