        "text": "Embarking on the exhilarating journey into the realm of filmmaking, one often finds themselves enchanted by the irresistible allure of the director’s chair—the epicenter of creative power, emotion, and storytelling magic. But what exactly does it take to ascend to this lofty position?\n\nTo uncover the secrets of this captivating realm, we need to look no further than the dynamic and visionary director, David Michan. Renowned for his groundbreaking work not only in film but also in television, Michan stands as a beacon of inspiration for aspiring directors worldwide. As the lead film instructor at InFocus Film School, his insights are more than just guidance; they are a thrilling expedition through the intricate pathways of cinematic excellence. His upcoming film, “The Girl in the Polaroid,” was shot entirely with a crew of InFocus alumni, including co-director Ed Alexander. With Michan at the helm, the journey to becoming a director becomes an exhilarating adventure, full of twists, turns, and unforgettable moments of creative brilliance.\n\nWhat is a Director?\n\n“A director is an artist, a problem solver, and a visionary,” asserts Michan. In his view, the role transcends mere technical proficiency, encompassing a profound ability to create, innovate, and inspire. It’s about harnessing intuition and forging a unique perspective that sets one apart in a sea of storytellers. Michan’s definition underscores the multifaceted nature of directing—a delicate balance of creativity, pragmatism, and leadership.\n\nAccording to Michan, a director must possess a comprehensive understanding of various disciplines, ranging from history and cinema to photography and acting. “To have your own vision, you need to delve deep into diverse subjects,” he advises. This broad knowledge base serves as the bedrock upon which directors can craft narratives that resonate with authenticity and depth. It’s not merely about mastering technical skills but also about cultivating a rich tapestry of influences that shape one’s artistic sensibilities.\n\nDirectors Embrace Learning\n\nMichan’s philosophy emphasizes the importance of continuous learning—an ethos that he instills in his students. “As a director, you must always be learning something new,” he emphasizes. This commitment to growth ensures that directors remain adaptable in an ever-evolving industry, where trends and technologies are in constant flux.\n\n“Even seemingly unrelated subjects can offer valuable insights,” Michan observes. He encourages aspiring directors to explore diverse interests, drawing connections between disparate disciplines. Whether it’s delving into the history of cinema or studying the intricacies of graphic novels, every piece of knowledge contributes to a director’s creative arsenal. It’s about cultivating a curious mind—an insatiable hunger for knowledge that fuels innovation and ingenuity.\n\nDirectors Start Simple and Dream Big\n\nFor novice directors eager to make their mark, Michan offers pragmatic advice: start small. “Keep it simple, keep it realistic, keep it within your budget,” he advises. Beginning with modest projects allows filmmakers to hone their craft without succumbing to the pressures of grandiosity. It’s a gradual ascent—a series of small victories that build confidence and competence over time.\n\n“Too often, aspiring directors try to leap from crawling to running,” Michan observes. This impatience can lead to frustration and disillusionment when lofty ambitions collide with practical constraints. By embracing simplicity, directors can focus on mastering fundamental techniques before embarking on more ambitious endeavors.\n\nDirectors Must Be Expert Communicators\n\nCentral to the director’s toolkit is the ability to communicate effectively with actors. “Actors are not performers; they’re artists living the role,” Michan asserts. To elicit authentic performances, directors must provide clear, concise direction that resonates with the cast.\n\n“Clarity is key,” Michan emphasizes. Directors should eschew pretentiousness in favor of straightforwardness, ensuring that actors understand their motivations and objectives. This transparent approach fosters trust and collaboration on set, allowing performers to fully immerse themselves in their characters.\n\n“Directing is not about being snobby or cryptic,” Michan cautions. Instead, it’s about fostering an open dialogue that empowers actors to explore and inhabit their roles with confidence. By cultivating a supportive environment, directors can coax out nuanced performances that elevate the narrative.\n\nDirectors Must Have A Passion for Cinema\n\nAt the heart of Michan’s philosophy lies a profound love for cinema—a passion that fuels his creative endeavors. “Cinema is my motivation,” he confesses. For Michan, filmmaking is more than a profession; it’s a means of self-expression—a conduit for channeling emotions, ideas, and aspirations onto the silver screen.\n\n“Cinema has the power to entertain, to provoke, and to inspire,” Michan reflects. Whether through heart-pounding action sequences or poignant character studies, film has the ability to evoke a myriad of emotions and leave a lasting impact on audiences.\n\n“Think about something that makes you truly happy,” Michan urges. “That’s cinema.” For him, the joy of filmmaking lies in the ability to connect with audiences on a visceral level—to elicit laughter, tears, and everything in between. It’s a symbiotic relationship—a shared experience that transcends language and culture.\n\nNavigating the Director’s Journey\n\nIn the vast landscape of filmmaking, the path to becoming a director is as diverse as the stories they tell. Through the lens of David Michan’s insights, we glean a deeper understanding of the artistry, discipline, and passion that define this noble pursuit.\n\nFrom embracing lifelong learning to fostering clear communication with actors, Michan’s teachings offer a roadmap for aspiring directors to follow. It’s a journey fraught with challenges and triumphs, setbacks and breakthroughs. But through dedication, perseverance, and a steadfast commitment to their craft, aspiring directors can unlock the boundless potential within and bring their cinematic visions to life.\n\nAs we watch the summer fade into the background, back to school season has rushed in to take its place.

Keep on reading to hear our 8 reasons why AI won’t replace the humanity of real screenwriters in the film industry.\n\nThe essence of authentic storytelling is firmly rooted in the human experience. Stories that call to the complexities of human emotion and the impact of different relationships we form in our lives. While AI can certainly be used for analysis or identifying trends within groups of data, anything requiring emotional intelligence or connection would be a struggle to create for AI without any human intervention. The importance of human creativity, imagination and intuition is simply undeniable. Not to mention the sheer fluidity of the creative process!\n\n1. AI LACKS THE “HUMAN TOUCH”\n\nThe “human touch” in storytelling is the catalyst that elevates narratives from words on paper to unforgettable experiences. Screenwriters have the power to breathe life into the characters they create, infusing them with depth, complexities, and relatable human qualities. By immersing themselves in their characters emotions and experiences, screenwriters pave the way for authentic connections between the characters and the audience.\n\nWhen it comes to the script, crafting compelling dialogue is an art form full of subtle complexities of the human experience. It’s this experience that enables writers to evoke powerful emotions that resonate deeply with viewers – something that AI will struggle to replicate without human prompts. It’s this ability to empathize and understand the human condition that screenwriters foster such an emotional connection between the audience and their stories.\n\nWhile AI has made significant strides in generating content and examining text, it lacks the quality of human emotion – the most important part of the scriptwriting process! Algorithms may analyze data and create logical plotlines, but they cannot fathom the depth and nuance of human feelings. The empathy and the genuine connection that comes from shared experiences remain uniquely, exclusively human.\n\n2. THE CAPACITY TO IMAGINE\n\nImagination is the lifeforce of every screenwriter, propelling them to transcend the limits of reality and explore uncharted territories or uncommon themes. Human screenwriters rely on their imagination to craft unique yet relatable experiences and characters. The mind of a screenwriter has the power to roam freely, breaking boundaries and daring to ask questions like “what if?”\n\nArtificial intelligence, while unquestionably impressive in its data analysis and pattern recognition, lacks the imaginative capacity that defines human creativity. It cannot fathom the boundless scope of human thought or the audacity to dream BIG!\n\n3. THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN INTUITION\n\nIn the realm of storytelling, intuition is an invaluable compass that guides screenwriters in navigating the intricacies of human behavior and cultural nuances. Our ability to perceive the subtleties in how people behave enables us to craft complex characters that transcend the pages of the script.\n\nBy drawing from personal experiences and empathizing with others, screenwriters are able to fill their narratives with authenticity and relatability. As a result, the emotional journeys within these narratives become more palpable to audiences. Cultural contexts and the characteristics of different social groups further enriches the storytelling process, as we bring diverse perspectives and authenticity to the forefront. While AI excels at processing data, it remains forever stunted by its inability to understand the motivations behind human behaviour.\n\n4. THE CREATIVE PROCESS\n\nThe creative process for screenwriters is a mesmerizing dance of skills that combine strategic thinking, problem-solving, and non-linear reasoning. As screenwriters embark on the journey of developing a script, they dissect ideas, characters, and plotlines with analytical precision, allowing them to fine-tune the underlying structures that make a story compelling. Screenwriters become master problem-solvers in how they use their creativity to overcome narrative hurdles.\n\nOn top of this, the ability for screenwriters to think in non-linear terms is exactly how many scripts take flight! What we mean by this is, as humans, our imagination allows us to think without structure – which is a good thing! Screenwriters are able to create a variety of different outcomes from one event, and are able to determine the ideal outcome to help propel their story while keeping audiences engaged.\n\nIn comparison, AI is unable to create outside of a linear framework. A successful narrative springs from a well of emotions, empathy, and an understanding of the human condition that can only truly come from lived experiences. A good narrative is not merely a sequence of events; it is a mirror reflecting our lives as human beings. Screenwriters draw inspiration from their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others, crafting characters that breathe with life and stories that resonate on a visceral level.\n\n5. CONNECTING WITH THE AUDIENCE\n\nIn this part, we’ll emphasize how human screenwriters craft characters that feel like friends, mentors, or even adversaries to the audience. We’ll discuss the significance of humanizing struggles and triumphs, leading to emotional catharsis and memorable storytelling.\n\n6. REWRITES! REWRITES! REWRITES!\n\nRewrites take time, effort, collaboration and the ability to be adaptable! As scripts evolve during production, the need for revisions may arise. Some of the reasons for rewrites could be to accommodate things like budget constraints, actor availability, and creative input from directors and producers. Screenwriters must navigate this process strategically, thinking on their feet to craft solutions that maintain the integrity of the story while meeting the production’s demands. This requires a delicate balance between staying true to the original vision and being open to constructive feedback.\n\nHowever, when it comes to AI, it simply cannot replicate the brainpower of a screenwriter. The acute awareness and understanding needed to maintain the story’s integrity, combined with the level of collaboration necessary for rewrites is far too complex for artificial intelligence to navigate. The human touch in screenwriting infuses stories with depth, authenticity, and emotional resonance – all of which are crucial in the commercial success of a film. As such, the skills that screenwriters have as master storytellers are indispensable aspects of the craft that AI cannot recreate solely on their own.\n\n7. CREW COLLABORATION\n\nAs mentioned above, rewrites require crew collaboration. But this isn’t the only aspect of screenwriting that demands collaboration. From the initial stages of script development to the final moments on set, screenwriters engage in a dynamic exchange of ideas, working in unison with directors to shape the narrative. They collaborate with actors to breathe life into their characters, providing insights and nuances that enhance the authenticity of performances. Throughout the production process, screenwriters collaborate with various departments, such as production designers, costume designers, and cinematographers, to ensure that the visual elements align seamlessly with the story’s essence. AI, despite its remarkable capabilities, cannot replicate this level of collaboration. It lacks the intuitive understanding of human emotions and the intricate dance of ideas that underpin successful collaboration between different members of a production team. The value of human creativity, empathy, and adaptability in the collaborative process is irreplaceable. Aspiring screenwriters, screenwriting students, and professional storytellers should celebrate their unique role in fostering collaboration, understanding that their craft transcends algorithms and plays an integral part in bringing exceptional stories to life on the silver screen.\n\nIn this part, we’ll underline the significance of collaboration in the entertainment industry. We’ll explore how screenwriters collaborate with directors, actors, and other creatives to bring their visions to life, producing collaborative masterpieces.\n\n8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nStories can wield immense influence, no matter if its a book, a script, or a song. Because of this, screenwriters bear the responsibility of addressing delicate subjects and moral dilemmas with sensitivity and respect in their writing. By drawing upon their own moral compass and cultural awareness, screenwriters navigate through these themes with care, developing narratives that provoke thought and evoke empathy, while sparking meaningful discussions. This discernment is deeply rooted in understanding the potential impact of their words, ensuring that no one is marginalized or insulted as a result of poor writing.\n\nIn contrast, while AI can generate content based on data, it lacks the intricate understanding of societal nuances and cultural sensitivities that screenwriters have. AI’s algorithmic nature limits its ability to grasp the emotional and ethical dimensions of storytelling. It lacks the ability to truly comprehend the subtle undercurrents that shape human interactions and cultural dynamics. While it can churn out content based on patterns and previously-generated content, it simply cannot engage in the critical dialogue necessary to address complex moral dilemmas or sensitive subjects in ways that human screenwriters already do in the industry.\n\nTHE VERDICT: WILL AI REPLACE SCREENWRITERS?\n\nOnce again we land on the same burning question: will AI replace screenwriters? It seems to us that the skills and abilities of human screenwriters can’t be replaced by artificial intelligence. Writers who want to work in film can take solace in these 8 undeniable reasons why Hollywood needs human screenwriters. AI alone can’t replace the humanity and the soul of storytelling: the creativity, imagination, intuition, and complexities of the human mind. Hollywood needs passionate, professional screenwriters to continue weaving narratives that touch our hearts, inspire and entertain us, and spark larger, meaningful conversations.\n\nIn a world where AI may weave words, its humanity that breathes souls into characters and their stories. Screenwriters, embrace your purpose, your potential, and your power!! You are the vanguards of artistry, the keepers of empathy, and the sages of emotion, further cementing that human creativity shall forever remain the greatest and most irreplaceable story of them all!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWriting for Film + TV (Diploma) – InFocus Film School\n\nHow To Find A Screenwriting Job\n\n5 Screenwriting Contests That Can Help Launch Your Career\n\nPrompt Your Way To Better Screenwriting\n\nGrowing Opportunities As A Video Game Writer\n\nTALK TO A PROGRAM ADVISOR\n\n(Captcha) What is 4+2?\n\nBy submitting this form you are agreeing to be contacted by InFocus Film School.
