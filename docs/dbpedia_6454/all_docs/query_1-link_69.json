        "text": "Members of the LGBTQ+ community are, for the most part, just like straight people. They meet, they fall in love, there are complications and — if they’re lucky — they live happily ever after. Just like straight people.\n\nBut the truth is that gay romance isn’t exactly like straight romance. Teenagers generally aren’t bullied for being straight. They don’t have to hide who they are and how they feel to be accepted and safe.\n\nWhich is why the incredibly sweet, charming and funny boy-meets-boy Netflix series “Heartstopper” isn’t just like all the boy-meets-girl teen romances we’ve been watching for decades.\n\nAnd, while the upcoming Prime Video movie “Red, White and Royal Blue” has all the familiar elements you’d expect in a romantic comedy, the fact that it’s about the son of the U.S. president and the grandson of the queen of England falling love makes it different.\n\n‘Heartstopper’\n\nThis really is one of the sweetest things on TV — utterly endearing and wildly engaging. I would’ve watched all eight episodes of Season 1 in a single sitting — same with Season 2 — if I didn’t have to get up for work the next day.\n\n(If you haven’t watched Season 1, you definitely need to do so before watching Season 2. The eight Season 1 episodes are 27-to-33 minutes long; the first seven Season 2 episodes are 31-to-36 minutes, and the eighth is 40 minutes.)\n\nIn Season 1 of this import from the U.K., we meet Charlie (Joe Locke), the nicest teenager imaginable. Charlie has had a rough time of it at school, where he’s been outed and is mercilessly bullied for being gay.\n\nAnd Charlie’s friends are worried about him because he has a crush on Nick (Kit Connor), the seemingly straight star of the school rugby team.\n\nSeason 1 is about Charlie and Nick falling for each other. Turns out that Nick is bi, and he’s as taken with Charlie as viewers are.\n\nNot to give away too much, but Season 1 ends in happily-ever-after territory. Season 2 shows us the beginning of the ever-after, which is not altogether happy.\n\nSeason 2 avoids the tropes of teen romance tales, but Nick is struggling to come out and reveal his relationship with Charlie to his friends. And it turns out that, in addition to his wonderfully loving and supportive mother (played by Oscar winner Olivia Colman), Nick has an obnoxious older brother, David (Jack Barton), and an estranged and distant father (Thibault de Montalembert).\n\nTo be clear, “Heartstoppers” is about love, not sex. While TV shows and movies about straight teens often, ahem, go all the way, Charlie and Nick are all about making out. If they want to keep their romance a secret, constantly sneaking kisses in school doesn’t seem smart, but they’re not jumping into bed with each other.\n\n“Heartstopper” is based on the graphic novels by Alice Oseman. So, no, you’re not losing your mind when you see bits of illustration in various scenes — from floating leaves to electric sparks when Charlie and Nick hold hands.\n\nSeason 2 revolves around Nick’s struggle to come out (and his continually insistence that he’s bi, not gay) and a school trip to Paris, but it’s not all about Nick and Charlie. Several supporting characters get more screen time as their roles are expanded:\n\n• Charlie’s awkward best friend, Tao (William Gao) has feelings for their transgender friend, Elle (Yasmin Finney). And she has feelings for him. But they’re teenagers, so will they ever admit that to each other? It’s a completely charming, endearing storyline all by itself.\n\n• All is not well with the lesbian couple in Charlie’s friend group, Tara (Corinna Brown) and Darcy (Kizzy Edgell). Darcy won’t tell Tara what’s bothering her, but it’s serious.\n\n• Another member of the friend group, Isaac (Tobie Donovan), doesn’t know how to handle it when another person reveals feelings for him. This storyline doesn’t go where you at first think it will, and probably doesn’t get as much attention as it deserves.\n\nIf it seems like this random school has an awful lot of members of the LGBTQ+ community, you’re not paying enough attention. Of course this group of friends gravitates to one another because they’re the outliers in a school full of straight kids. And while these friends model supportive behavior, they’re each other’s bulwarks against a considerably less kind world.\n\nWhat’s amazing is that “Heartstopper” delivers its message without preaching, without hitting you over the head with it. It comes with the characters — and did I mention how sweet and charming this story of young romance is?\n\nAll eight Season 2 episodes begin streaming Thursday on Netflix. The streamer has ordered a third season.\n\n‘Red, White and Royal Blue’\n\nThis made-for-Prime Video movie follows that pattern set by, oh, about a million romantic comedies that have gone before. The two protagonists meet and it’s hate at first sight. They don’t get along, and they seemingly don’t like each other. But their mutual antipathy is cover for their mutual attraction. And, before long, they fall into each other’s arms.\n\nThe difference here is the two protagonists are Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the first woman president (Uma Thurman) of the United States; and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the grandson of the queen of England. And the major complications are how Alex’s bisexuality will affect his mother’s re-election campaign, and that Prince Henry can’t come out or be in a relationship with another man because he’s a member of the royal family.\n\nGiven how much trouble the real royal family has with Prince Harry’s biracial wife, Meghan Markle, that doesn’t seem far fetched.\n\nAmazon has embargoed reviews of “Red, White and Royal Blue” until Thursday, Aug. 9 (ugh) — it starts streaming Friday, Aug. 10 — but if you’ve read Casey McQuiston’s very entertaining novel of the same title on which this is based, you know where this is going.\n\nMaybe one day people will look back at “Heartstopper” and “Red, White and Royal Blue” and they’ll seem quaint and outdated, because being gay won’t be a big thing. But that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon."
