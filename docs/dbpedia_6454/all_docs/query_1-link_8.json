        "text": "Liberal Arts (*** 1/2 out of four; unrated; opens Friday in select cities) is an artful blend of tenderness and sharp, clear-eyed observations. Its characters talk like real people -- who also happen to be smart, appealing and thoughtful.\n\nWriter/director/star Josh Radnor has fashioned an involving and intelligent look at maturity (or lack thereof), literature, careers and relationships, with strands that intertwine in a way that is often unexpected and always engaging.\n\nRadnor plays Jesse Fisher, a New York City college admissions officer who goes back to his idyllic college in Ohio. Once there, he strikes up several unlikely friendships.\n\nThe film has elements of a coming-of-age story, a romantic comedy and a personal odyssey. Radnor deftly captures the subtle but palpable disappointment of well-educated, emotionally vulnerable, thirtysomething guys who left college filled with a sense of promise yet to be fulfilled.\n\nProfessor Judith Fairfield (Allison Janney), who taught Jesse about Romantic poets, offers a precise, if nasty, assessment: \"All these effete, over-articulate man-boys who never learned to toughen up. Don't be one of them. Go work with your hands. Build something. Punch someone in the face.\"\n\nThe dialogue is witty and the story charming, even when treading on serious ground. Radnor is responsible for that blend of cleverness and affability in both his writing and engaging performance. As Jesse, he's a guy with his head in a book, uninspired by his job and not terribly invested when his girlfriend breaks up with him.\n\nSo when his favorite professor, Peter Hoberg (Richard Jenkins), invites him back to his alma mater for his retirement party, he jumps at the chance. Hoberg introduces him to family friend Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen). She and Jesse share bright banter, despite their 16-year age difference.\n\nWhen they discuss their mutual attraction, he says: \"I can't figure out if it's because you're advanced or I'm stunted.\"\n\nBoth may be true.\n\nLiterature figures prominently into the story line. Jesse is appalled that Zibby likes Twilight, which he considers \"the worst book ever written in English.\" He nurtures a tenuous friendship with the troubled Dean (John Magaro) over David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest and makes an odd connection with the hippy-dippy Nat (Zac Efron), who offers offbeat wisdom.\n\nDirector Radnor gives actor Radnor a clever way to communicate his dilemma to the audience, avoiding the overused expository device of confiding to a pal.\n\nHe does eventually meet an age-appropriate love interest (Elizabeth Reaser) who shares his passion for books. And while this romance is endearing, his age-inappropriate connections with Zibby and the 50ish Fairfield, with whom he has an awkward dalliance, are more fun to watch.\n\nAfter a heated quickie, Fairfield literally kicks him out of her bed and verbally derides him. He observes, \"At least I appreciate the irony: I just had the least romantic night of my life with a Romantics professor.\""
