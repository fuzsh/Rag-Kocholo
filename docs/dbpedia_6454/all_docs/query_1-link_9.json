        "text": "“Morris From America,” Chad Hartigan’s charming new film, begins with a father-son discussion of hip-hop, an argument about beats, flows and hooks. It’s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute; 13-year-old Morris (Markees Christmas) is skeptical of his father’s old-school dogma, while his dad, Curtis (Craig Robinson), dismisses his son’s taste as too pop. The conversation also provides a clue about the movie’s own strategies. It’s a pop confection with a rough, honest texture, real but not raw and suffused with an infectious sweetness that lingers after the final shot.\n\nAs Curtis puts it, he and Morris are “the only brothers in Heidelberg,” an African-American family in the perplexing and sometimes unfriendly environment of a picturesque German town. Curtis, a former soccer player in the United States, is on the coaching staff of the local team, and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry. Like almost every other single dad you see in a movie, he is a widower, a shortcut to audience sympathy that Mr. Hartigan might have had the wit to avoid.\n\nBut the novelty of the setting and the familiarity of the premise — an adolescent boy navigating a bumpy stretch on the road from boyhood to maturity — combine to give “Morris From America” buoyancy and heart. Mr. Christmas is an unusually subtle actor for someone his age. (He was 15 when the film was made.) He resists the temptation to make Morris precocious or cute, or to win over the viewer’s sympathy, and instead takes us inside the young man’s confusion. Like other teenagers, Morris is both smart and clueless, equally capable of sharp insights and colossal errors of judgment.\n\nAdding to his befuddlement is Katrin (Lina Keller), a slightly older girl (with a significantly older boyfriend) whom Morris meets at the youth center. He’s been encouraged to go there by his German tutor, Inka (Carla Juri), who serves, somewhat awkwardly, as his quasi-therapist and surrogate big sister. Katrin, a cynical and capricious queen bee, is beautiful and more than a little cruel. She genuinely likes Morris, which means that she likes to humiliate and torment him.\n\nShe encourages him to rap at the center’s talent show, with disastrous results. “Morris From America” is blunt about German racism, which has a different texture from its American variety, partly because young, right-thinking Germans consider themselves entirely free of ancestral bigotry. A counselor at the youth center suspects that Morris is a drug dealer. The other kids blithely give voice to obnoxious assumptions about his basketball skills and his sexual prowess. He’s either a mascot or a scapegoat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
