A 1808 song about the power of enduring love.

words by Thomas Moore

the melody is a traditional Irish air

arranged by Sir John Andrew Stevenson

The melody is much older and would have been familiar to Irish poet Mr. Moore. A lady’s loss of charms may have been due to scars left by smallpox. First published in London in 1808, it was a song hit in the U.S. by 1810. This is a 1823 printing.

The sheet music:

Accompaniment track:

Lyrics

Believe me if all those endearing young charms

Which I gaze on so fondly today

Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms

Like fairy gifts fading away

Thou would’st still be adored as this moment thou art

Let thy loveliness fade as it will

And around the dear ruin, each wish of my heart

Would entwine itself verdantly still

It is not while beauty and youth are thine own

And thy cheek unprofaned by a tear

That the fervour and faith of a soul can be known

To which time will but make thee more dear

Oh! the heart that has truly loved never forgets

But as truly loves on to the close

As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets

The same look which she turned when he rose
