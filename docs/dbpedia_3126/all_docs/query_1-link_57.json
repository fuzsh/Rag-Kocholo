        "text": "The Moana Hotel opens in Waikīkī in March, ushering in an era of tourism, and with it emerges a crew of extremely talented and generally jovial group of men called, 'The Waikīkī Beachboys.' The Waikīkī Beachboys appear on the scene with a revival of traditional Hawaiian watersports, surfboard riding, and outrigger canoe riding. They are described as \"both a cause and byproduct of the booming Hawaiʻi tourist trade; they earn a living primarily by lifeguarding and giving surf lessons and canoe rides, and spend their free time surfing, swimming and playing music.\"\n\nTerritory of Hawaiʻi Act 201 officially establishes a \"Life-Saving Patrol\" for Waikīkī Beach, and has come to be celebrated as the birth of the Ocean Safety Division on Oʻahu. Act 201 called for assignment to Waikīkī Beach of two members not less than 18 and not older than 40 years of age, who were \"selected for their strength and ability as swimmers and boatmen, and shall be expert in the use of the methods of resuscitation, both with and without apparatus, apparently drowned persons.\" These first city lifeguards were paid $75 a month. The City & County of Honolulu officially celebrates this event as the birth of its lifeguarding service.\n\nRalph \"Buster\" Wallwork joins Ocean Safety as a new Lifeguard and would end up rising through the ranks to Captain, and then to Chief of Operations in 1982 until his retirement in 1994\n\nThe Honolulu Fire Department begins making shoreline patrols around the island of Oʻahu by pulling a Lifeguard from the Natatorium into the fire truck.\n\nMākaha Beach Park caretaker and legendary waterman Richard \"Buffalo\" Keaulana is appointed as the first lifeguard at Mākaha.\n\nThe first lifeguard tower on the North Shore is erected at Sunset Beach, and then another at Waimea Bay.\n\nEddie Aikau becomes the first city lifeguard to work the North Shore. He is tasked with covering all of the beaches and surf breaks between Haleʻiwa and Sunset, using an old city hearse converted to a city lifeguard vehicle complete with rescue board on the roof. He bases at Waimea Bay every day and drives into town to check in once a month at the Natatorium.\n\nWhile surfing Waimea Bay in the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational lifeguard Brian Keaulana wiped out for a two-set hold down. While tumbling underwater he began thinking, “God here I am, in the same position of the people I see when they drown.\" When he came up, the next wave was even bigger. There next to him in the impact zone was a friend Squiddy Sanchez on a stand up Jet Ski saying, \"Brian, you alright?\" and pulled him from the impact zone. This sparked a vision in Brian who immediately worked with fellow Lifeguards Terry Ahue and Mel Puʻu to retrofit personal watercraft for surf rescue.\n\nPersonal Watercraft (PWC) are incorporated in the lifeguard program as a rescue tool for the North and Leeward Coast Districts for high surf rescue.\n\nKeawaʻula Beach at Kaʻena Point State Park is located at the westernmost point on the island of Oʻahu. The beach is exposed to high surf; a strong shore break; and a strong, often severe, current. The remote, pristine site attracts many surfers, sunbathers, swimmers, and waders. The combination of dangerous physical features and heavy use by patrons increases the risk for water-related injury and death. From 1985 to 1991, two drownings and 40 near-drownings occurred at Keawaʻula Beach. Although the State of Hawaiʻi does not provide lifeguards, it elected to contract with the City and County of Honolulu to place lifeguards at Keawaʻula Beach beginning in January 1992.\n\nMoi Hole - An amazing surf rescue happened in 1993 when 26-year-old tourist Hugh Alexander was knocked off a 20-foot rock ledge near Yokohama Beach on the Waiʻanae coast and was trapped in a sea cave known as a “Moi Hole” for more than two hours as it was pounded by 10 to 15 foot waves. Legendary waterman and lifeguard Brian Keaulana, dodging the giant waves, attempted to drive a Jet Ski with lifeguard Craig Davidson on a rescue sled up to the cave to rescue the man. But the vehicle ran onto a rock which pierced the hull, disabling it. Davidson swam out through the waves and was picked up by a rescue helicopter. Keaulana swam to shore, raced to his house in Mākaha to get another Jet Ski. This time, with new partner Earl Bungo, they gunned the Jet Ski back into the boiling surf and managed to pluck Alexander from the mouth of the cave. But then a big wave knocked both Alexander and Bungo from the sled and against the rocks. Keaulana, putting his own life on the line again, charged back into the watery mêlée, putting the Jet Ski between the men and rocks. Once the two were back on board, Keaulana shot the Jet Ski seaward, just as a new set of large waves came rolling in. Keaulana got an award from the U.S. Lifesaving Association in San Diego for the rescue.\n\nThe Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services Division, in a City wide re-organization, is moved from the Department of Parks and Recreation to the newly created Emergency Services Department, along with the Emergency Medical Services Division.\n\nJan. 15, 1998 – The Queen of Mākaha Rell Sunn passed away after a long battle with cancer. One of the most popular and famous lifeguards in Ocean Safety history, she was a fixture at Tower 47 in Mākaha from 1977 through the late 1980s, and has inspired countless women to follow her footsteps in the ali‘i red shorts and gold shirt. She was the City’s first woman to lifeguard the Leeward Coast.\n\nOcean Safety announces that it will sponsor and manage its own Junior Lifeguard Program for the first time in more than a decade. In the intervening years (2013-2022), city lifeguards formed a non-profit in order to run the wildly successful program themselves.\n\nOcean Safety conducts one of the largest recruit class in its history (30 new Guards) in order to continue meeting an increasing demand signal for service.\n\nLt. Chelsea Kahalepauole-Bizik is promoted in December, becoming the service's first official female supervisor.\n\nLifeguard Luke Shepardson takes two hours of vacation time to surf two heats of the prestigious Eddie Aikau Invitational while assigned to Tower 29 at Waimea Bay, and wins in a storybook finish to a great day of surfing on Jan. 22, 2023.\n\nMayor Rick Blangiardi announces in an April \"State of the City Address,\" that his administration will study whether or not to make Ocean Safety a separate county department.\n\nThe second class of Ocean Safety EMTs -- the first since 2005 -- graduates 24 from the state's Emergency Medical Technician school at Kapiʻolani Community College.\n\nBeginning on the South Shore in July, and wrapping up on the North Shore by Labor Day, all towers move to a 10-hour day from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. -- marking arguably the biggest operational change in the service in decades.\n\nA new tower is installed in August at Kahe Point, marking the first time the county added a tower since the late 1990s.\n\nOcean Safety stages its first ever Fall Junior Lifeguard Program during the Department of Education's Oct. 9-13 break, conducting very popular 1-day clinics at five different beach parks, reaching more than 600 keiki.\n\nAn \"Ocean Safety Department Task Force\" is poised to deliver a recommendation in January to Mayor Blangiardi on whether or not the service should be a separate standalone public safety agency -- like Police, Fire, and EMS -- in the City & County of Honolulu.\n\nA special Mahalo to retired Ocean Safety Chief Ralph \"Buster\" Wallwork, and former Chief John Silberstein, for their work on this brief history."
