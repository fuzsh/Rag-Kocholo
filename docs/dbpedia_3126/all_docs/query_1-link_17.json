        "text": "Day 31 of putting myself out there to improve the quality of my LinkedIn profile! #softskillsaturday - Wow 31 days of posts, that's like a whole month! Let's talk about how important a #growthmindset is in all aspects of life! Until about 9 months ago I was terrified of anchoring, and now it's one of my favorite things to do! Why was I so terrified? It was the unknown. We had anchored once in the Puget Sound with our instructor on board, and I had spent all night awake watching the anchor alarm. So, after that first experience, we were reluctant to try it on our own. I thought of all the things that could go wrong dragging anchor, in the middle of the night, hitting another boat, and the list goes on. I never thought about the freedom it would afford us to not have to pull into a dock or find a mooring ball. So what changed? Nothing, I was still terrified of anchoring when we finally did it for the first time. However, we had gotten caught out in a bad storm that was predicted to get worse. We had thought with the wind in our favor that a 2 day window was long enough to get to our destination. We were wrong, the storm hit earlier than expected and we spent 3 days getting tossed around. Our only refuge from the storm that was about to get worse was an anchorage in a small bay. Instead of continuing to sail in the storm, we started heading toward the coastline. It was going to take us about 14 hours to make it to the bay from 80 miles offshore. During the night I had plenty of time to worry about dropping anchor for the first time. We made it to the bay just as the sun was coming up, and to my surprise, I remembered all the steps for dropping the hook! It caught hold on the first try, and I slept like a baby and didn't even look at the anchor alarm once. Now 9 months later I've had other boaters comment on our anchoring style, and commend me for anchoring in rough waters. I can't even remember what it was like to be so afraid of something that seems so simple now. I'm incredibly grateful for that storm because it was just the push I needed to take my sailing skills to the next level. #sailing #anchoring #newskills #softskills #storytime\n\nIt‚Äôs Squeaky bum time. What we call a moment that‚Äôs a little tense. We‚Äôre under way early this morning to coincide with high tide. Our boat draws 7.5ft, which means from the water line to the bottom of the keel is 7.5ft. The beautiful turquoise waters of the Bahamas are due to huge, shallow sandbanks- often A LOT shallower than 7ft. Wonderful for swimming with stingrays and collecting sand dollars, not ideal for getting our big girl from A to B So we have a new factor to consider- as well as the swell, wind speed, direction and depth, we‚Äôve added the tides to our critical factors to consider each day. The difference between gracefully sliding into a new channel and getting an aggressive microdermabrasion to our bottom can be a matter of where we are in the tide. And sometimes we just can‚Äôt fit at all. We watch our catamaran friends head serenely up the bank while we monohulls have to head through the cuts between cays out into the ocean, and then back in again. This brings a whole new load of challenges with tidal rages and standing waves if we hit them wrong. Squeaky bum indeed. But this morning, we‚Äôre going bank side. We‚Äôre heading downwind at 6 knots in 10 knots of wind on a flat sea- what we call Champagne sailing! And these conditions allow me to be at my computer and ponder the power of skill stacking (thank you for that term Lindsey Lerner) To be an expert in any one of the skills we need in sailing, would be wonderful, but not enough to be a competent sailor. We need ALL the skills. We need to know how they interact, where they overlap, how they impact each other. And we need to be constantly open to adding new skills to the stack, as well as improving the old ones. So today I'm celebrating the huge learning curve that comes with learning new things. To adding strings to your bow and stacking your skills. And to tide charts. What have you learnt recently to add to your skillset?\n\nEDUCATION SERIES: MAP AND COMPASS NAVIGATION üß≠ Becoming competent and confident when using a map and compass to find your way around the hills takes time. But aim to following these hints and tips, when looking to find your way: ‚úîÔ∏è Master the basics: Learn to read a map's key, symbols, and contour lines. Understand compass directions to navigate confidently. ‚úîÔ∏è Orientate yourself: Ensure your map aligns with the actual terrain by using your compass to match north on the map with north in the field. ‚úîÔ∏è Set your course: Use your compass to determine your desired direction, then align the map to your route for accurate navigation. ‚úîÔ∏è Pay attention to landmarks: Identify prominent features on the map and in the landscape to confirm your location and stay on course. ‚úîÔ∏è Measure distance: Use the map's scale and your compass to estimate distances and gauge how far you need to travel. ‚úîÔ∏è Stay updated: Periodically check your progress on the map to avoid straying off course, especially in challenging terrain. ‚úîÔ∏è Plan for contingencies: Familiarize yourself with escape routes, alternate paths, and nearby landmarks in case of unexpected obstacles. ‚úîÔ∏è Practice with pacing: Develop a consistent walking pace to estimate distances covered and enhance your navigation accuracy.
