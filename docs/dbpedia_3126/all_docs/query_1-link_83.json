Our courses reflect the latest techniques based on science and best practices to ensure that you are properly trained and prepared for emergencies in and around the water.\n\nCourses and Materials\n\nRed Cross training provides participants with flexible training options, improved tools and resources. Our in-person training has a strong focus on practicing the skills needed to prepare, respond and prevent emergencies. Course materials, including a complementary eBook, includes skill videos for lifeguards to review and refresh during and after training.\n\nA variety of Red Cross aquatic courses cover everything from Lifeguarding, Lifeguard Management, to swim lessons and water safety. The curriculum to become a certified lifeguard has been recently updated and developed under the guidance of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council, a group of nationally recognized experts that ensures all information provided offers the latest science and best practices.\n\nFlexible Training: Whether you prefer training in a classroom only in-person environment or the flexibility of blended learning (online courses followed by Instructor-led classes), the Red Cross Lifeguarding Certification is the trusted leader in lifeguard and aquatic training and accepted nationwide.\n\nCourses & Certification\n\nAll lifeguarding participants must complete the required swimming skills prerequisite prior to taking the course. The prerequisite skills assessments include a swim-tread-swim and a timed event sequence.\n\nThroughout the course, participants will learn and be evaluated on knowledge and skills related to lifeguarding, water rescues, extrications, CPR and AED and First Aid.\n\nIn addition, at the conclusion of the course, participants must successfully complete 3 final skills assessments:\n\nRotate in-conduct surveillance – rotate out\n\nTimed Single-rescuer CPR Scenario\n\nMultiple Rescuer Response Scenario\n\nParticipants are required to take one final written exam consisting of 50 questions and score a minimum of 80%.\n\nParticipants who successfully complete the Lifeguarding certification course will be issued one of the following certifications depending on the Lifeguarding course completed. For example, participants that successfully complete the Lifeguarding (including Deep Water) with CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and First Aid, will be issued a certification valid for 2 years."
