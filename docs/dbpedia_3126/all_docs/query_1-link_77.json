        "text": "For nine days, 144 athletes from 11 different countries competed in various events centred on the sport of lifesaving, which CISM defines as a combination of aquatic and land‑based events inspired by coastal and pool lifesaving challenges. The aim is to “rescue better and faster.”\n\nPO2 Palmer has enjoyed competing in the sport of lifesaving since 2010, and found it easy to take the opportunity to further challenge herself. One aspect that appealed to her the most was the diversity of events. In comparison to swimming, lifesaving involves more components and requires a larger variety of techniques, resulting in a sport that requires as much knowledge and skill as speed.\n\nEvents within lifesaving include the Board Race, Rescue Tube Rescue Relay, Surf Ski Race, Manikin Carry and Beach Sprint. As well, the events are further categorized into ocean events or pool events.\n\nPO2 Palmer explained having ocean and pool events is another distinguishing aspect of the sport, where the variability of the environment can factor into performance. For instance, she described the beach in France as having had warm and calm weather, which made the ocean feel more like a lake. Depending on what an individual is used to, flat waters rather than waves could be advantageous.\n\nOf the 24 events in the competition, PO2 Palmer participated in 14, ranking in the top five for many. When asked what she believes was the biggest contributing factor to her success, she said endurance is the most important quality you can possess. For instance, the Oceanwomen event involved four parts, requiring participants to swim, board, surf ski and run in succession. Not only do athletes require an impressive level of physical stamina, but they also need strong mental fortitude and a determined attitude. PO2 Palmer said she found that particularly true for this championship, as it was the greatest number of events she had ever done. As a result, she felt physical training and mental preparation were equally important leading up to the competition.\n\nThough PO2 Palmer has never needed to perform a water rescue in a real‑life scenario, she said the pressure you experience during competition, while not the same, could be comparable. It is essential to stay calm and perform certain actions while under pressure in both cases, and understanding what strategies are available is extremely helpful.\n\nIn addition, she stated the sport has allowed her to develop leadership skills through extensive teamwork and collaboration, which has greatly benefited her in her military career. She emphasized that as much as her athletic experiences have helped her career capabilities, it goes both ways: her position in the military has also significantly contributed to her growth as an athlete.\n\nPO2 Palmer also mentioned she likely would not have got into the sport of lifesaving in the first place had she not been introduced to it by her sister, who is a major with the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nWhile good sportsmanship is always valued in the sports scene, CISM specifically emphasizes the component of social connection, which is reflected in their motto: ‘Friendship through Sport.’ CISM’s goal is to “use sport for deconfliction and peacebuilding between countries,” and events like the World Military Lifesaving Championship provide a space for military members to meet their peers from other countries, cultures and trades.\n\nThis year there was a Fair Play Award, where each participating country nominated a team they felt was most deserving, and this was proudly received by the Canadian CISM Lifesaving team.\n\nAnother unique addition to this year’s championship was a cultural day for participants. Two people from every country had the opportunity to help introduce schoolkids and injured veterans to the sport of beach lifesaving. PO2 Palmer took part in this and said it was not only a first for her at a CISM event but found it was especially rewarding to make a positive impact. In addition to fostering camaraderie between participants, this made it a valuable and memorable experience.\n\nCurrently, lifesaving as a sport is building traction in Alberta but remains uncommon throughout most of Canada."
