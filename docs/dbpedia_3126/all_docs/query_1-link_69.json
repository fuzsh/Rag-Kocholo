        "text": "Recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as the International Federation for Para Surfing, also known as Adaptive Surfing, the ISA has taken an active role in the worldwide development, promotion and structure of the sport. This program is part of the ISA’s ongoing effort to create a global platform for universal access to the sport and enable Para Surfers to achieve sporting excellence and inspire others. While the competitive element of Para Surfing is a rapidly growing aspect of the sport, the Adaptive Surf Instructor Program focuses on broader inclusion and grassroots development.\n\nIn partnership with AmpSurf, Surfability UK, and members of the global Adaptive Surfing community and supported by the Foundation for Global Sports Development, the ISA has developed this International Adaptive Surf Instructor Certification Program. This program is complementary to the ISA Coaching and Instructing Program and accessible for surf instructors, surf schools, and Adaptive Surfing organizations worldwide.\n\nThe ISA Adaptive Surf Instructor Certification Course ensures those who are engaged in Adaptive Surf Instruction and Therapy are adequately trained and have the necessary knowledge and skillset to improve the skills of the Adaptive Surfers that they are instructing. This enables surf schools to employ certified adaptive surf instructors and offer surf lessons to surfers with physical, mental, cognitive, and behavioral health disabilities. This also provides organizations that run Adaptive Surfing programs and therapy the opportunity to train their staff and volunteers. Overall, this course contributes to a safer environment for Adaptive Surfing instruction and therapy worldwide.\n\nFIND A COURSE >>\n\nInterested in Organizing or Attending an ISA Adaptive Surf Instructor Course?
