        "text": "The First Clubs\n\nAustralia’s first volunteer Surf Life Saving clubs appeared on Sydney’s ocean beaches in 1907. By-laws which had previously banned bathing in daylight hours since the 1830s were gradually repealed between 1902 and 1905, in response to the increasing popularity of surf-bathing, and a growing conviction that public bathing in appropriate clothing as not an immoral act.\n\nThese changes had a dramatic impact on local beach culture as the number of beachgoers entering the surf suddenly increased. The surf and beach environment was new to most surf-bathers and many could not swim, so with the increasing popularity of surf bathing came more drownings and consequent attempts at rescue.\n\nBy the summer of 1906/7, the population of Sydney was obsessed with the question of surf safety. It was in this environment that surf lifesaving clubs first emerged, their regular patrols a welcome relief to local authorities and nervous bathers alike.\n\nOn October 18, 1907, representatives from these clubs, together with members of other interested groups, met to form the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales, the organisation which is now known as Surf Life Saving Australia.\n\nThe first South Australian club was established at Henley in 1925, and was initially affiliated with the Royal Life Saving Society. The emergence of more clubs along South Australian beaches, and South Australian members competing at interstate surf competitions, led to a push for a formation of a State Centre of the Surf Life Saving Association in South Australia. On October 10, 1952, representatives from five clubs (Brighton, Glenelg, Henley, Moana and Seacliff) met with representatives from Surf Life Saving Australia and Royal Life Saving Society. The outcome was the formation of what is now known as Surf Life Saving South Australia.\n\nIn 1980, to the great advantage of the movement, women were admitted as active lifesavers to patrol beaches and do rescue work. Now over 140,000 men, women and children belong to the movement, over 550,000 people have been rescued by Australian surf lifesavers since 1907, and over three hundred clubs patrol the coasts of all States of the Commonwealth.\n\nTo fulfill its charter of saving lives, Surf Life Saving Australia has adapted quickly to change. Advances in technology, rescue techniques has seen the advent of the Inflatable Rescue Boat, defibrillator, expired air resuscitation, helicopter rescue service and dedicated digital radio channels, to name a few.\n\nSouth Australian Surf Life Saving\n\nThe first South Australia club was Henley, founded in 1925. It was soon joined by Seacliff (1930), Glenelg (1931), Port Elliot (1933), and Moana (1938).\n\nIn that era, the Royal Life Saving Society prevailed over South Australian gulf waters, and despite South Australian clubs' burgeoning relationships with interstate and national surf life saving bodies (and Henley sending a team to compete interstate in 1938), in 1939 it was ruled that Gulf waters in South Australia were \"inland\", and any South Australian clubs would be part of the Royal Life Saving Society, rather than Surf Life Saving.\n\nTwo Henley members - Charles Fielder and Mervyn Butterfield - took it upon themselves to lobby for change, and for thirteen years they collected wind and tide graphs, and records of wave conditions, and were unrelenting in their efforts to demonstrate that Gulf waters were not \"inland\" but real \"surf beaches\". In light of expert evidence (from the State Weather Bureau and the Harbour Master), it was conceded that Gulf waters were surf lifesaving respibsibility. The first annual report of the State Centre records,\n\nINAUGURATION\n\n\"The SA State Centre of the S.L.S.A was formed on October 10th 1952 at a meeting organised by the S.A. Branch of the Royal Life Saving Society and representatives of Beach Clubs, following upon provisional affiliation being granted Moana, Glenelg and Henley Clubs direct with the National Council of the S.L.S.A.”\n\nPort Noarlunga in 1952 was first to join the original five clubs. Brighton and Semaphore followed in 1953, then Christies Beach (1954), Grange and West Beach (1955), Whyalla and Chiton Rocks (1957), South Port (1959), Somerton (1960), North Haven (1967), Aldinga Bay (1978), Normanville (1998) and Goolwa (2010).\n\nDue to the Royal Life Saving Society situation, it it was not until 1953 that South Australia was able to field another surf lifesaving team at a national championships. Since this year, however, participation of South Australian athletes and teams has increased across junior, senior and masters levels, and we have achieved great success not only nationally but internationally as well.\n\nFor over sixty years Surf Life Saving South Australia has patrolled the beaches of the state. Growth of membership and public participation has been exponential to address issues as they have arisen. There are now nineteen clubs and nine thousand members to keep those South Australian beaches safe."
