        "text": "Return to Beaches​\n\nPalm Beach County Ocean Rescue Lifeguards​\n\n​Palm Beach County Ocean Lifeguards are a team of well trained, highly skilled professionals. They specialize in preventative actions, ocean rescues, and emergency medical assistance to beachgoers. Palm Beach County employs 66 year-round lifeguards and 40 seasonal lifeguards for 14 parks. These men and women are entrusted with protecting and servicing an estimated 5.2 million beachgoers every year, averaging 200 rescues, 630 bathing assists, 16,000 first aids, 113,000 preventative actions, reuniting 30 lost children with their parents and 9,000 participants in their public education events.\n\nBut who exactly are these men and women who make up Palm Beach County’s Ocean Rescue?\n\nThe 106 guards range in age from the early 20s to the early 60s. A surprising number hold college degrees. Most are married and have children. Former teachers, accountants, firefighters, writers, stock brokers, air traffic controllers, real estate agents, business people, and lawyers have all worn the Palm Beach County lifeguard uniform. Most have worked for Palm Beach County for over 10 years; 17 over 20; and a dozen over 30.\n\nPalm Beach County Ocean Rescue is an agency certified by the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA). While all lifeguards hold certifications in lifeguarding, CPR/AED and Emergency Medical Response- first aid, most surpass this, a majority are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), several are certified paramedics, in SCUBA, and some have a boat captain license.\n\nRegardless of age and work experience, Palm Beach County Ocean Lifeguards are all exceedingly skilled and trained ocean athletes. All lifeguards train daily to hone their swimming, running, rowing, paddling, and rescue skills to ensure not only the public’s safety but also their own. Formal training drills, led by Training Officers, are conducted at least twice per month to keep skills sharp. To maintain their jobs, they must biannually pass a timed swimming and running test, which is a requirement of each USLA agency.\n\nAiding the effectiveness of the lifesaving operation is the use of a wide range of equipment. Most inlet parks have Rigid Hull Inflatable Rescue Boats or a Rescue Water Craft, and All Terrain Vehicles are in operation at most beaches. Each lifeguard tower is fully stocked with first aid supplies, a back board, oxygen, resuscitation equipment, an Automated External Defibrillator, and rescue tubes and paddle boards.\n\nThe skills and rigorous training of these dedicated professionals has yielded some notable awards:\n\n1996 – Beach Patrol of the Year by the Florida Beach Patrol Chief’s Association\n\n2003 – First place in the Bill Shearer International Basic Life Support Competition at CLINCON\n\n2004 – First place in the USLA National Surf Lifesaving Championships\n\n2016 – Beach Patrol of the Year by the Florida Beach Patrol Chief's Association\n\n2018 – First place in the Southeast Regional USLA Surf Lifesaving Championships\n\n​Seven Palm Beach County Ocean Lifeguards have been named Lifeguard of the Year in the state of Florida\n\n2020 – Beach Patrol of the Year by the Florida Beach Patrol Chief’s Association\n\n2021 – First place in th​e Southeast Regional USLA Surf Lifesaving Championships\n\n2022 –​ First place in the Southeast Regional USLA Surf Lifesaving Championships\n\nPalm Beach County Ocean Lifeguards are a diverse group of highly trained and dedicated individuals who offer an outstanding life saving service to all visitors of County beaches.\n\nLifeguard Tryouts\n\n​Ocean Rescue is conducting a seasonal Ocean Lifeguard test. The testing process is in two stages.\n\n1. A Run/Swim/Run continuously for approximately 20 – 25 minutes"
