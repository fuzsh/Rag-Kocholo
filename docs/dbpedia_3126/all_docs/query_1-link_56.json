        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. â Amidst a nationwide lifeguard shortage, the Volusia Surf Lifesaving Association is representing the county at the United States Lifesaving Associationâs 2023 National Lifeguard Championships.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nVolusia County is short more than 100 lifeguards this summer, but surf lifesaving helps retain staff\n\nSix Volusia County lifeguards are competing in the National Lifeguard Championships\n\nThe event runs from Aug. 9 to Aug. 12 in Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nLifeguards will have a chance to compete internationally if they place at the competition\n\nWhile Volusia County is short more than 100 lifeguards this summer, the sport of surf lifesaving helps to retain guards.\n\nApril OâGorman, vice president of the Volusia Surf Lifesaving Association, said the sport promotes team bonding, boosts morale and keeps lifeguards coming back each year.\n\nSurf lifesaving is a competitive surf sport that implements the rescue skills lifeguards use every day â like running, swimming, board paddling, surfing and more.\n\nOne of the sportâs missions is to educate the public about the water safety methods their local lifeguards use to keep beachgoers safe.\n\nDuring their final meet before the competition, OâGorman led her team in practicing board racing â where lifeguards run into the water with their rescue boards and paddle out to sea as fast as possible.\n\nThis skill emulates how lifeguards would quickly make their way to a victim.\n\nâItâs so important because itâs really training them for the skills that they use every day to save people,â OâGorman said. âIt makes it more fun because itâs a competition but itâs really pushing them in that way.â\n\nThe team will compete in events like surf skiing, team relays, board racing, beach flags and more.\n\nThe junior lifeguarding competition starts Aug. 9 and the lifeguard championships run Aug. 10 to Aug. 12. Both events take place in Virginia Beach, VA.\n\nIf the team members place in events during the competition, they will have the opportunity to represent the United States in the 2023 International Surf Rescue Challenge.\n\nThis will be OâGorman's eighth time competing in nationals.\n\nIn previous years, sheâs placed first in seven events, including as the 2018 Ironwoman Champion and 2018 and 2019 Rescue Race Champion.\n\nMost recently, OâGorman earned a bronze medal in Mixed Lifesaver Relay at the 2022 World Lifesaving Championships.\n\nA former competitive swimmer, lifeguard and international surf lifesaving champion, OâGorman said sheâs spent most of her life in the water.\n\nâI definitely spend more time on water than I do on land,â OâGorman said. âIâm in the water as much as I can.â\n\nGrowing up in Daytona Beach, Fla., all of her jobs have revolved around her love of the ocean and her coastal community. First, as a lifeguard and now as a sustainable design strategist.\n\nâI started out working on the beach and it was because I love the ocean and the environment,â OâGorman said. âNow, I work for PepsiCo Global because I want to help protect the ocean that I get to enjoy every single day.â\n\nAs vice president of the Volusia Surf Lifesaving Association, OâGorman competes in the sport, organizes races and practices, and helps train her team.\n\nAs she gets the team ready to leave for nationals, she is hopeful they will head home victorious.\n\nâWe have a young squad going to nationals this year,â OâGorman said. âIâm super excited for the future ahead of us.â"
