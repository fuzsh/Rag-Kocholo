        "text": "Don’t miss Australia’s Surf Life Saving on the Drone Radio Show! Oliver Heys and James Bassam discuss Surf Life Saving, the use of drones to monitor sharks and the evolution of Australia’s long range UAV coastal monitoring program with host Randy Goers.\n\nSurf Life Saving is Australia’s premier water safety, drowning prevention, and rescue organization. With 129 Surf Life Saving Clubs and over 77,000 members, it’s one of the largest not-for-profit volunteer movements in Australia, dedicated to saving lives on the beach. A standout feature within Surf Life Saving is the Australian Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle Service, operating the largest coastal UAV surveillance program in the Southern Hemisphere. The Australian UAV Services uses drones to monitor sharks off the coast of New South Wales, enhancing bather protection while minimizing harm to sharks and other marine life.\n\nOliver, Surf Life Savings Chief Remote Pilot & Capability Coordinator, oversees regulatory compliance and brings a wealth of experience since joining the organization in 2020. Oliver’s dedication to the UAV industry earned him a finalist spot for the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Professional of the Year at the Australian Aviation Safety Awards in 2023.\n\nJames is the Australian UAV Service Operations Manager for Safety and Compliance. With a background in crewed aviation and roles as a Commercial Pilot, Flight Instructor, and Head Teacher of Aviation, James leads the operational delivery team. He has spearheaded numerous projects to enhance the capabilities of the Australian UAV Service.\n\nIn 2023, Surf Life Saving introduced long-range drones to monitor the coastal waters of New South Wales. This cost-effective, non-invasive technology has been successful in ensuring the safety of swimmers and surfers while minimizing the impact on marine life. The public response has been overwhelmingly positive, with increased confidence in water safety where UAVs are deployed.\n\nMissed a recent episode?
