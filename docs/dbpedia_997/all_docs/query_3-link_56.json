Despite his promise not to interfere, Cantor makes changes in all the production numbers until Farnsworth, pretending to be a reporter, calls Cantor on the telephone and encourages him to tell his life's story. When Pat learns about the benefit, she suggests that Tommy crash the performance and sing in front of a professional audience. With Pat's help, Tommy sneaks backstage, but is once again kicked out by Cantor. Pat is not defeated, however, and proposes that Joe impersonate Cantor. A few members of the Gower Gulch gang kidnap Cantor, to the delight of Farnsworth and Schlenna. They are nonplussed when Joe appears, but as his only demand is that Tommy be allowed to sing, they continue with rehearsals before the man they think is Cantor changes his mind. After all the stars who have assembled for the show perform, Tommy sings and is such a hit that movie mogul Jack Warner offers to sign him to a contract. Before the end of the show, Cantor escapes from his captors and returns to the theater, but Joe continues his masquerade and joins the company for the grand finale.\n\nLess"
