        "text": "I've Seen Dinah Shore Blvd in Winchester -- BUT who is Dinah Shore?\n\nIn the American entertainment history, few names shine as brightly as that of Dinah Shore, the iconic singer, actress, and television personality who hailed from Winchester, TN. Her journey from the town of Winchester TN to the pinnacle of Hollywood fame is a testament to her talent, determination, and the enduring appeal of her artistry.\n\nBorn as Frances \"Fanny\" Rose Shore on February 29, 1916, in Winchester, TN, Dinah Shore's early life in Winchester laid the foundation for a career that would see her become one of America's most beloved entertainers. Shore was immersed in a world of Southern charm and musical richness, which undoubtedly influenced her later career. In fact, those early years helped form the foundation for who she became.\n\nIt appears that they rented a home on Ninth Avenue in Winchester TN while living in the area.\n\nUnfortunately, Fanny contracted polio when she was 18 months old and through the dedicated effort of her mother who regularly massaged her legs and had a rigorous exercise program, she was able to overcome much of the disability, eventually learning to swim, play tennis, and dance ballet.\n\nThe family left Winchester TN when she was 5 years old and she eventually graduated from Hume Fogg High School in Nashville in 1934 and was voted “the Best All-Around Girl in the Class\".

She outlined in a newspaper interview in 1940 why she changed her name which is somewhat humerous.\n\nIt didn't take long for Dinah to make a name for herself from a line item on a radio station in 1938 to a photo and highlight for a radio program (and picture in the newspaper) in 1940 (Just two years later)\n\nAnd just two months later, she was voted as the Outstanding New Star\n\nDuring the 1940s, Dinah Shore became a household name across America.
