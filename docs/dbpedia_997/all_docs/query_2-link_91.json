It is surely one of the finest TV performances of Bowie’s career.\n\n•\n\nThe performance was part of Bowie’s appearance on the popular Dinah! show, hosted by singer and actress Dinah Shore. He also performed Stay, and was interviewed extensively and chatted with the other guests.\n\nThe show was recorded at CBS Television City in Fairfax, Los Angeles, during the run of LA shows at The Forum. The show broadcast on 3rd of March 1976.\n\n•\n\nNews guy wept when he told us…\n\nThis video is part of an ongoing process of refining and re-uploading some of my oldies that Vimeo abruptly took down earlier this year. These days due to copyright restrictions and risk aversion, there aren’t many of the conventional options left for uploading some of my videos. Thus far thankfully, I’ve had no trouble with my channel on Russian host site ok.ru.\n\n•\n\nI wish we had a pristine version of the extraordinary Dinah! Performance of 5 years – of the entire show actually – but failing that, here’s the best I could come up with, cobbling together a variety of sources.\n\nHope you dig it!\n\n•\n\nCredits\n\nSource:\n\nDavid Bowie • Five Years • Recorded live on the Dinah! Show • CBS Television City • Fairfax, Los Angeles • 9th February 1976 • Broadcast 3rd of March 1976 • NBC / 20th Century Fox Television\n\nMusicians:\n\nDavid Bowie • Vocals\n\nCarlos Alomar • Guitar\n\nDennis Davis • Drums\n\nTony Kaye • Keyboards\n\nGeorge Murray • Bass\n\nStacey Heydon • Guitar\n\n•\n\nAlways more videos to follow, so please keep your electric eye on me babe!\n\nI don’t own the rights, and I’m not making any money out of this etc. Just a fan making videos for other fans.\n\nNachosVideos.com\n\nFacebook.com/TheNachoVideos\n\nYouTube.com/NachoVideo\n\nok.ru/nachovideo\n\nDailyMotion.com/NachosVideos\n\nInstagram.com/NachoVideo\n\nTwitter.com/NachosVideos\n\nTheNachoVideos@gmail.com\n\nI edit, therefore I am\n\nNacho, 2020.\n\n#DavidBowie #FiveYears #StationToStation #Dinah! #TheDAMTrio"
