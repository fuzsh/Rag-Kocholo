        "text": "So just who was Dinah Shore?\n\nWhen the LPGA and Kraft decided to take Shore’s name off the LPGA major championship she hosted after the 1999 event, one of the reasons given was that the tour would hate to have some player in 10 or 15 years ask, “Who is Dinah Shore?”\n\nIt’s been 25 years now since Shore died of ovarian cancer in February of 1994, and the LPGA is a vastly different place than it was when Shore was alive. Younger golfers, even in their mid-teens, have won tournaments, and there is a stronger influx of international players than ever before. In 2016, Lydia Ko became the first golfer to win the “Dinah,” now called the ANA Inspiration, who was born after Shore died.\n\nMore: Who is the Poppie behind Poppie's pond?\n\nYes, there is a statue of Shore at the foot of the bridge at the 18th hole of the Dinah Shore Tournament Course, a name that was given the course after Shore died. But Shore was more than just a statue or a name on a golf course.\n\nTwenty-five years later, here’s a reminder of just who Dinah Shore was and why she still means a lot to LPGA golfers from a generation or two ago:\n\nShe was a big band star without a big band job: As a singer, Shore is often credited with being one of the first successful performers to strike out on her own without being the featured singer for one of the era’s big bands. Her first charting hit was “The Breeze and I,” which hit No. 13 in 1940. She continued to hit the charts through 1960 and had 34 top-10 hits, including four records that reached No. 1. She recorded songs from 1939 to 1974.\n\nShe is a member of the Television Hall of Fame: Shore appeared in numerous movies, but it was in television where she found a second successful career. Shore was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1991 based on her work for two successful television shows. There was “The Dinah Shore Show,” a musical/variety show which starred Shore from 1951 to 1963 in various formats. The show gave Shore a chance to perform with the top stars of the day and is perhaps best remembered for a song she did for the sponsor of many of the shows, “See the U-S-A in Your Chev-ro-let.” In the 1970s, she started a run as host of a daytime talk show, called “Dinah’s Place” from 1970 to 1974 on NBC and then “Dinah!” in syndication from 1974 to 1980. The first talk show was hosted by Colgate-Palmolive, a fact that would change golf history. Shore and her shows won nine Emmys and even a Peabody Award.\n\nShe really did think she was being asked to host a tennis tournament: Colgate-Palmolive decided to start a women’s golf tournament in the Coachella Valley in 1972. David Foster, the head of Colgate-Palmolive, thought it would be a good idea to have Dinah Shore host the event, since Shore’s daytime talk show was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. Shore agreed, but was thinking it was a tennis tournament. That’s because Shore didn’t play golf, and who would ask someone who doesn’t play golf to host a golf tournament? But Shore started playing and took to the game immediately. She also loved the players and became a great champion for women golfers, becoming friends with many players and advocating for women’s golf whenever she could.\n\nShe was the third person to jump into Poppie’s Pond: It wasn’t called Poppie’s Pond yet, it didn’t have a cement bottom or filtered water when Amy Alcott and her caddie Bill Kurre first jumped into the lake next to the 18th green at Mission Hills Country Club after Alcott’s 1988 win in the Nabisco Dinah Shore. No one jumped in the lake in 1989 or 1990, but Shore had promised her friend Alcott she would jump in the lake with Alcott if Alcott won the tournament again. That happened in 1991, with Alcott winning by a massive eight shots. True to her word, Shore joined Alcott and Kurre in running into the lake.\n\nShore was inducted into the LPGA Hall of Fame one month after her death: Shore died in February of 1994, just one week before her 78th birthday. A month later, at the annual Dinner with Dinah before the tournament that year, LPGA Commissioner Charlie Mechem announced that Shore would become the first non-player to be inducted into the LPGA Hall, one of the toughest sports halls of fame to qualify for. But as Mechem said at the time, Shore was the winner of every Dinah Shore tournament, and that was 26 major championships right there.\n\nThat’s who Dinah Shore was. Today’s players born after Shore died or international stars who never had a chance to see any of Shore’s television shows or movies or never heard her recordings can be forgiven for not understand the magnitude of Shore as an entertainment icon. But every LPGA player needs to know who Shore was and why she was important to the LPGA.\n\nLarry Bohannan is The Desert Sun golf writer.
