        "text": "George Montgomery (born August 29, 1916, Brady, Montana, U.S.—died December 12, 2000, Rancho Mirage, California, U.S.) was an American actor who was admired for his rugged good looks in some 87 films and a number of television series during a six-decade career. Best known for his roles in westerns, he also appeared in romantic comedies and musicals.\n\nMontgomery grew up on a farm, and the skills he gained there, such as handling horses, later proved useful to his performing career. After a year at the University of Montana, where he studied interior design, he moved to Hollywood and soon became a stuntman and played small parts in westerns, The Singing Vagabond (1935) and Springtime in the Rockies (1937) among them. The 15-chapter serial The Lone Ranger (1938) gave him his first major role, and he went on to be featured in such films as The Cisco Kid and the Lady (1940), Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), Roxie Hart (1942), and Coney Island (1943).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter having romanced several prominent actresses, Montgomery married singer Dinah Shore in 1943. Following World War II service in the U.S. Army Air Forces, which he entered in 1943, Montgomery returned to movies in Three Little Girls in Blue (1946), and in 1947 he played detective Philip Marlowe in The Brasher Doubloon. Montgomery thereafter appeared mostly in low-budget westerns and war movies, and he starred for two years (1958–59) in the TV series Cimarron City. He also directed a few action films."
