        "text": "432 Hermosa\n\nBy Randy Garner\n\nNestled in the prestigious Old Las Palmas neighborhood, the Dinah Shore Palm Springs Estate is a luxurious oasis that captures the essence of desert living. Located at 432 Hermosa, this stunning vacation rental property boasts an impressive legacy, having been owned and cherished by the iconic singer and television personality Dinah Shore.\n\nThe Dinah Shore Estate is a masterpiece of midcentury architecture, designed by the renowned architect Donald Wexler in 1964. The estate features clean lines, elegant curves, and a sleek glass façade that seamlessly blends into the surrounding landscape. The property is set on an expansive 1.3 acre of lush gardens landscaped to provide a sense of privacy and tranquility to guests.\n\nA Little History\n\nDinah Shore was an American singer, actor, TV personality, and chart-topping female vocalist of the 1940’s. She was married to actor George Montgomery and they built their first desert home in 1952. It was located in the Movie Colony neighborhood. When she hired Donald Wexler to design the home she was married to George Montgomery, but the marriage ended before it was completed. For decades, Shore was the official hostess of the Colgate and later the Kraft Nabisco Women’s Golf Tournament. It was nicknamed “The Dinah” in her honor.\n\nTony and Grammy winning Broadway composer and lyricist Jerry Herman purchased the home in 1992. His shows include Hello, Dolly! and La Cage aux Folles. He sold it to a couple from San Francisco.\n\nDavid Lee purchase the property in 2002. David is a screenwriter who co-wrote and co-produced the TV shows Jeffersons for six years and Cheers for four years. He then co-created Wings and Frasier. Of the 18 Emmy Award nominations, he won nine times. The estate was sold in 2009.\n\nOwners Ben and Jude Lipps, who had purchased the home in 2011, then sold the home to an LLC in 2014 with ties to Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nInteriors\n\nThe large entryway gives a glimpse of the grand scale to follow.\n\nThere are 6 bedrooms and 7 ½ baths between the main house, the guest house overlooking the pool, and the casita adjacent to the private tennis court. This makes it ideal for large families or groups of friends who want to enjoy a luxurious vacation together.\n\nThe bedrooms are spacious and bright, with comfortable beds, soft linens, and ample closet space.\n\nThe bathrooms are equally impressive, featuring luxurious fixtures and finishes that create a spa-like atmosphere.\n\nInside the estate, guests are treated to a spacious and luxurious living experience. The home features almost 7,000 square feet of living space, with soaring ceilings, expansive windows, and an open floor plan that creates an airy and inviting atmosphere. The interiors are in a classic midcentury style, with clean lines, warm wood finishes, and colorful accent pieces that add character and charm to the space.\n\nThe Cocktail bar off the sunken living room.\n\nA view of the dining room, which looks out to the pool area.\n\nThe office, should you choose to do a little work.\n\nOutdoor Space\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the Dinah Shore Estate is its outdoor living spaces. The property features multiple patios and terraces, each with its own unique character and charm. Guests can relax by the pool or soak in the hot tub.\n\nThe property also features a pool house, which includes a kitchenette, dining area, and bathroom.\n\nEnjoy a game of tennis on the private court, complete with its own enclosed pavilion.\n\nDue to the expansive spaces, the estate can accommodate large events and destination weddings.\n\nAbout Donald Wexler\n\nDonald Wexler was an American architect known for his contributions to modernist architecture in the Palm Springs area of California. Wexler was born in 1926 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and studied architecture at the University of Minnesota before moving to Palm Springs in the 1950s. Wexler began his career working for the architectural firm of Richard Neutra and then formed his own firm, Wexler & Harrison, with partner Richard Harrison in the 1960s. Together, the two architects designed a number of notable buildings in Palm Springs, including the Canyon Country Club, the Dinah Shore residence, the Palm Springs International Airport Terminal, and the steel-framed homes.\n\nWexler’s work is characterized by his use of clean lines, geometric forms, and innovative materials, and he is known for his focus on designing buildings that are well-suited to the desert climate of Palm Springs. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects and received numerous awards and accolades for his work throughout his career. Wexler passed away in 2015, but his legacy as an architect lives on in the many buildings he designed in Palm Springs and beyond.\n\nOverall, the Dinah Shore Estate is a stunning property that captures the glamour and elegance of Palm Springs living. Whether you’re looking for a luxurious vacation home or a venue for a special event, this estate is sure to fulfill your every desire. With its impeccable design, luxurious amenities, and prime location, the Dinah Shore Estate is truly a one-of-a-kind property that will leave a lasting impression on all who visit.\n\nBOOK\n\nPhotos Credit: Dinah Shore Palm Springs Estate.\n\nYou May Also Like:\n\nCelebrity Guide\n\nPalm Springs Confidential: A Hollywood Pedigree"
