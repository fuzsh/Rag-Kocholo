        "text": "In 1951, Chevrolet signed a deal to sponsor The Dinah Shore Show on NBC, during the height of her career as one of America’s most popular singers and television personalities. At the end of each show, the charming, sultry-voiced Shore serenaded her audience with “See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet” from the driver’s seat of a sleek, brand new Chevy.\n\nFor audiences, it seemed like kismet. Shore’s easy, quintessentially American charm embodied the tone and spirit of the brand, turning the theme song—and the show—into a hit. It went on to become the brand’s official jingle and—became The Dinah Shore Chevy Show until it was replaced by Bonanza, another Chevy-sponsored variety hour. The show’s decade-long run made Shore a staple of classic American television."
