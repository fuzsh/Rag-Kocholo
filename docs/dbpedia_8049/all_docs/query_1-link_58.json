        "text": "The MOMENTUM biennale is pleased to announce the list of practitioners taking part in the exhibition of its eleventh edition, which is titled HOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nThe title refers to “commons,” “commonality,” and “commoning,” notions and processes that were elaborated and discussed by thinkers such as Elinor Ostrom. HOUSE OF COMMONS is curated by Théo-Mario Coppola and is set to take place from June 12 to October 10, 2021.\n\nThe practitioners and practitioner collectives will present projects at various venues and sites on the island of Jeløya, in the city of Moss and in the Oslo Fjord, Norway.\n\nEmancipation, resilience, reparation, and the formation and transmission of alternative narratives all inform the practitioners’ work. Their projects—a significant part of which will be newly-conceived or site-specific—will explore the intricate relations between aesthetic and social issues. They will also reverberate communities’ concerns, like the use of deliberative processes, the defence of ecosystems and the advancement of rights.\n\nExhibition list\n\nApparatus 22 (founded 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, based in Brussels, Belgium, Bucharest, Romania, and the SUPRAINFINIT utopian universe)*; Pia Arke (born 1958 in Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland, died 2007 in Copenhagen, Denmark); Federico Barbon (born 1990 in Treviso, Italy, based in Milan, Italy, and Lausanne, Switzerland)*; Augusto de Campos (born 1931 in São Paulo, Brazil, based in São Paulo, Brazil); Nina Canell (born 1979 in Växjö, Sweden, based in Berlin, Germany); Chto Delat (What Is to Be Done?, founded 2003 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, based in Saint Petersburg, Russia)*; Cian Dayrit (born 1989 in Quezon City, Philippines, based in Cainta, Philippines); Goutam Ghosh (born 1979 in Nabadwip, India, based in Bhuj and Kolkata, India)*; Camilo Godoy (born 1989 in Bogotá, Colombia, based in New York City, United States)*; Renée Green (born 1959 in Cleveland, United States, based in New York City and Somerville, United States); Núria Güell (born 1981 in Vidreres, Spain, based in Vidreres, Spain)*; Siri Hermansen (born 1969 in Geneva, Switzerland, based in Oslo, Norway)*; Délio Jasse (born 1980 in Luanda, Angola, based in Milan, Italy); Daisuke Kosugi (born 1984 in Tokyo, Japan, based in Oslo, Norway)*; Kollektivnye Deystviya (Collective Actions Group, founded 1976 in Moscow, USSR, based in Moscow, Russia); Maria Nordman (born 1943 in the joined cities of Görlitz and Zgorzelec, Germany, and with each new inhalation, based in Santa Monica and Joshua Tree, United States, and all the cities of her works’ processes)*; Maria Noujaim (born 1986 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)*; Uriel Orlow (born 1973 in Zurich, Switzerland, based in London, United Kingdom, and Lisbon, Portugal)*; Frida Orupabo (born 1986 in Sarpsborg, Norway, based in Oslo, Norway); Charlemagne Palestine (born 1947 in New York City, United States, based in Brussels and Ostend, Belgium); Paul B.
