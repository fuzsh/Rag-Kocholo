David Macey, An Encyclopedia of African American Literature, five volumes, for Greenwood Press.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: California native Hans Ostrom grew up surrounded by nature in his Sierra City home in the Sierra Nevada. \"Bears, deer, raccoons, and rattlesnakes were often in our neighborhood, or we were in theirs,\" Ostrom wrote in an autobiography on his Internet home page. In this remote location (his grade school was twelve miles away), Ostrom read widely in literature and genre fiction, \"reading novels by candlelight when winter storms knocked out electrical service,\" he wrote on his home page. From this background, Ostrom pursued poetry, fiction writing, and academics in the field of English. His scholarly interests include \"composition studies, creative writing pedagogy, rhetoric, and African American literature.\"\n\nIn keeping with his interests, Ostrom is the author of two books on African American author Langston Hughes. In Langston Hughes: A Study of the Short Fiction, Ostrom presents a chronological analysis of the development of Hughes's short fiction. Ostrom focuses primarily on themes and thematic issues in Hughes's short stories, \"but he remains alert to Hughes's relationship to literary and political movements\" such as literary modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, commented J. A. Miller in Choice. The book includes excerpts from Hughes's essays, speeches, and autobiographies, with an eye toward establishing a sense of what Hughes thought of his own work. Ostrom also offers detailed surveys of articles, reviews, and criticism of Hughes's short works.\n\nA Langston Hughes Encyclopedia is a \"fascinating and ambitious\" project featuring detailed descriptive entries, bibliographic citations, chronologies, and overviews of multiple aspects of Hughes's life and work, observed S. A. Vega Garcia in Choice. The book includes entries on Hughes's best-known poetry and fiction, but it also covers his more obscure and lesser-known works, including journalistic pieces, essays, dramatic works, children's literature, translations, songs, and even liner notes written for musical recordings by activist and folk artist Joan Baez. Ostrom also covers relevant themes and topics important to Hughes's work, and includes biographical entries on Hughes's key contemporaries. Reviewer Donna Akiba Sullivan Harper, writing in the African American Review, noted that \"Ostrom has undertaken a noble effort\" but remarked on a number of inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the encyclopedia, including bibliographical errors, omissions of information on important works and characters, and some factual mistakes. However, Harper noted, \"In a volume of nearly 500 pages, the nature and specifics of the inconsistencies, oversights, and errors documented here are certainly far outnumbered by the accurate entries, and the enormous scope of this venture represents an appreciable volume of work.\" Vega Garcia concluded that A Langston Hughes Encyclopedia is \"a carefully prepared, invaluable aid\" and \"thoroughly enjoyable reading.\"\n\nHans Ostrom told CA: \"I grew up in Sierra City, a town of two hundred people in California's High Sierra. At the University of California, Davis, I studied with Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Karl Shapiro. One of my interests is depicting the experience of rural, working-class Americans.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAfrican American Review, spring, 2003, Donna Akiba Sullivan Harper, review of A Langston Hughes Encyclopedia, pp. 162-165.\n\nChoice, December, 1993, review of Langston Hughes:A Study of the Short Fiction, p. 605; October, 2002, S.
