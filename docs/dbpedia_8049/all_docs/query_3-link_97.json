        "text": "This conference explored the thoughts of Vincent and Elinor Ostrom, including such ideas as polycentricity, voluntary association, federalism, and local control. We addressed whether the Ostroms were primarily pragmatic problem solvers or truly committed to the preservation of a free society."
