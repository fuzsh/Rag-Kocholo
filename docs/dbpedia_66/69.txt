Darlington Borough Council is the local authority for the town of Darlington and the surrounding villages in North East England. Darlington Borough has a population of 106,000 residents. It has a busy town hall center serving 350 customers per day for a range of public services supplied by different departments and other public sector organizations. Customers’ needs vary, for example approx. 100-150 customers per day require customer services, just under 100 customers per day require benefits services and customers also require appointments for services such as registrars, children’s financial services and external probation services.

The main challenge for Darlington Borough Council is managing a large range of services and customer needs in one town hall with a complex flexible workforce, including external organizations all using the center for different purposes and at different times. Central management of the customer journeys is required to ensure increased waiting times do not occur that can jeopardize health and safety for both the customers and staff. “Health and safety is paramount in the center. If customers are not informed of their waiting time and their journey is not managed it causes confusion, and dissatisfaction,” said David Alley, Customer Services Manager at Darlington Borough Council. “We need to be able to manage many different services in the one center with staff on the move constantly. We also need to ensure staff are trained in health and safety practices and are able to use the center.”
