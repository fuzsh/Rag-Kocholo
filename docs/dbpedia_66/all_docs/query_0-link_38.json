        "text": "Proposed by the Government Property agency, Brunswick Street will house a 104,000 sq ft five-storey civil service hub, following a planning committee verdict.\n\nThe new building will dramatically extend the scope of the Darlington Economic Campus, which as things stand is made up of Feetham House and Bishopsgate House, both situated in the town centre.\n\nKier Construction was picked in May to deliver the £118m project. ID Planning advised, along with AtkinsRealis as architect and advisor across a whole host of professional areas.\n\nWith works on site set to begin later this year and completion earmarked for 2027, the modern, energy-efficient office complex will be part of the wider DEC, and become home to 1,400 civil servants from across a number of government departments.\n\nThe campus incorporates HM Treasury, the Department for Business and Trade, for which Darlington will be the second headquarters, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Office for National Statistics, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nIt also includes the Department for Education, which has been based in Darlington since the 1960s.\n\nThe DEC forms part of the Government Hubs Programme supporting economic growth across the UK through the redevelopment of brownfield sites or repurposing existing buildings to create efficient, sustainable and productive workplaces.\n\nGeorgia Gould, parliamentary secretary for the Cabinet Office, said: “The new development will support Darlington’s economy and allow the Civil Service to draw on talent and skills across the region. This Government is committed to economic growth in every region of the UK and we will get behind cities and towns to deliver new jobs and opportunities for their communities.”\n\nMark Bourgeois, the GPA’s chief executive, said: “This is excellent news for our departmental clients and for the town of Darlington. We are delighted to achieve planning permission for this development which will help deliver on the Government’s mission in supporting economic growth in the region.\n\n“It also supports the transformation of the civil service through delivery of a modern, inspirational and energy-efficient office complex.”\n\nSecond permanent secretary to the Treasury Beth Russell said: “This is a great step forward in developing the Darlington Economic Campus.\n\n“With over 920 new civil service jobs already created in the town and 480 more to come, we are offering the opportunity for people in the north east to do government jobs that were traditionally only available in London, making government policy-making more reflective of the communities we serve.”\n\nThere has been extensive public consultation prior to the submission of the Darlington government hub application in March this year.\n\nDarlington Council approved the project on 7 August. The proposals can be viewed on full on the council’s planning portal with the reference 24/00294/FUL."
