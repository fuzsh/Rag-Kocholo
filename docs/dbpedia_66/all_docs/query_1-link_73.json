        "text": "The OP makes an interesting thread.\n\nI can't think of any examples other than those already listed, but I've noticed a lot more of these \"Welcome To Insert County Here - Home Of Historic Slogan\" kind of signs on roads over the past decade or so.\n\nCounties (and Unitary Authorities etc) make a huge effort to promote their boundaries to motorists, yet the majority of signs visible from railways seem to be at least a hundred years old.\n\nOkay, I appreciate that you'd struggle to read signs whilst travelling at 125mph (and InterCity services may well cross the boundaries of a number of counties that the service won't actually stop in), but there are lots of slower lines too.\n\nWhat'd be the point? Well, what's the point in a road sign telling me I'm in Lincolnshire (other than some local pride), yet there seem to be more and more such signs on our highways.\n\nFor example, I know that the Scottish Saltire is from East Lothian, because I've seen it on so many road signs welcoming me to the area that it's sunk in - I know that County Durham is the Land Of The Prince Bishops - I've seen so many of these signs that I associate different parts of the country with different things. Yet nobody advertises to railway passengers (even on lines where speeds are certainly slow enough to be able to read a simple sign).\n\n(going off topic, but when coming back from south west Wales towards Yorkshire up the A483, every time we crossed the border into Wales there'd be a huge colourful sign welcoming us to the principality, yet the only notification you got as you left Wales was a modest little monochrome sign simply saying \"Shropshire\" or \"Cheshire\" or whatever - some areas are obviously more welcoming than others!)\n\nI do wonder if TOCs perhaps miss a trick by not offering some kind of window gazers guide for kids on long journeys.\n\nI tend to invent games for the kids on a long trip. How many football teams will we pass, do you know the name of their grounds? Same for cricket or rugby Guess how many counties we go through. Which is the biggest town or city we stop at etc. Fills in the time no end.\n\nI know that County Durham is the Land Of The Prince Bishops -\n\nThe finest county in these United Kingdoms.\n\nIndeed the River Tees does mark the border between North Yorkshire and County Durham but its an odd border as if I remember correctly Stockton-on-Tees is in both counties where by Thornaby station is in North Yorkshire and Stockton station is in County Durham but they both fall under Stockton-on-Tees council.\n\nFrom the 1890's till the Local government re-organisation in 1968, Thornaby was a separate town from Stockton, with it's own town council, and was always in North Yorkshire. It was swallowed up by Stockton Borough Council in 1968. In much the same way Yarm was always in North Yorkshire, But is now with-in Stockton Borough Council.\n\nI believe when the Station was first built (further west than it's present location, but still south of the river in Yorkshire) it was called South Stockton. When the town was given it's Charter in the 1892, one of the first things the local town council did was to build a station befitting it's new status as a Town in it's own right.\n\nStockton and Thornaby have always had a \"difficult\" relationship going back to the mid 1800's, and it continues to this day. There have been many attempts since the 1980's to rename Thornaby Station as Stockton or South Stockton, all of which have been met with strong local protests.\n\nFrom the 1890's till the Local government re-organisation in 1968, Thornaby was a separate town from Stockton, with it's own town council, and was always in North Yorkshire.

North = County Durham. What will you take for Hartlepooh?\n\nSouth of the Tees = Yorkshire. North = County Durham. What will you take for Hartlepooh?\n\nThat's my understanding.\n\nOff topic but there was a lovely collection of knitted \"Yorkshire\" creatures/ people/ landscapes on Saltburn pier a few weeks ago - they know that they belong to Yorkshire!\n\nI do wonder if TOCs perhaps miss a trick by not offering some kind of window gazers guide for kids on long journeys\n\nVirgin did some when the Voyagers came to XC - quite diverting to gaze through one whilst listening to the on board entertainment with a pair of headphones... (it only feels like a couple of years ago, rather than fifteen!)\n\nThere are certainly a few lines where that'd be a great idea (both scenic and historic). Did you see the recent story about the Goole line?\n\nI don't agree that Darlington is in County Durham. Nor do the road signs, nor the fire service, nor do the hospital trust...\n\nLike i said earlier, administrative boundaries and counties are not the same thing. As for the fire service, it just uses the name of the two unitary authorities that it covers. (I notice that you didn't bring up the police service though )\n\nUnitil 1974 Darlington was a County Borough, but no-one would have suggested that it wasn't part of Co. Durham. A Unitary Authority is just modern name for a County Borough - although the older title is still used in Wales."
