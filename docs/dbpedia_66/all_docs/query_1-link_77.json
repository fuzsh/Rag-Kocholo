        "text": "2. Population of UK at mid-2022\n\nWe estimate the UK population at mid-2022 as 67.6 million (67,596,281). This is an aggregate of the estimates for the four constituent countries.\n\nAll four countries of the UK saw population increases in the period between mid-2011 and mid-2022. Table 1 shows the populations and summary statistics for each country of the UK. The highest percentage increase was in England where the population increased by 4.0 million, a rise of 7.5% between 2011 and 2022. Northern Ireland saw the next highest percentage increase of 5.3%, followed by Scotland at 2.8% and Wales at 2.2%.\n\nDownload this table Table 1: Population of the UK and its constituent countries, mid-2022 and mid-2011\n\n.xls .csv\n\nOverall, England had the highest population density of the four countries of the UK at mid-2022. However, this includes a wide variation within England, where the population density in London was 5,640 people per square kilometre (km), and for the South West it was 242 people per square km.\n\nThe median age of the population in the UK was 40.7 years in mid-2022, 1.1 years higher than in mid-2011. The increase in median age over this eleven-year period was highest in Northern Ireland, though at 40.0 years, this was still the lowest of the countries in the UK. Scotland had the highest median age at 43 years.\n\nAt mid-2022, there were 34,492,000 females and 33,105,000 males in the population of the UK. This is an increase of 7.2% in the number of females and 6.5% in the number of males since mid-2011.\n\nFor England, Wales, and Northern Ireland the population estimates are rolled forward from the 2021 censuses for these countries. For Scotland, these estimates are the first mid-year population estimates based on Scotlandâ€™s 2022 census, which took place on 20 March 2022, a year later than the rest of the UK because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nMid-year estimates for 2012 to 2020 have been revised for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to align with the results from the 2021 Censuses. Mid-2022 estimates for these countries are comparable with previous years.\n\nPopulation estimates for Scotland for previous years have yet to be revised to account for the 2022 Census, therefore mid-2022 estimates for both Scotland and the UK are not currently comparable with estimates for the period 2012 to 2021.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n3. Local area populations\n\nThe age composition of the population is determined by the patterns of births, deaths and migration that have taken place in previous years. The interactive population pyramid in Figure 1 shows how the age distribution within the population can change over time and varies between local areas, regions, and countries of the UK.\n\nFigure 1: Interactive population pyramid, mid-2011 and mid-2022\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\nFigure 1 shows that the age structure of different parts of the UK can vary considerably. For example, Northern Ireland had the highest proportion of children aged under 16 years of any country of the UK in mid-2022 (20.4%), whereas Scotland had the lowest proportion of people of this age group (16.4%). At a local authority level, there is even wider variation with an example being the proportion of those aged 65 years and over ranging from 33.8% of the population in North Norfolk to 5.6% in Tower Hamlets.\n\nFigure 2 is an interactive map that shows the proportion of the population in different age groups for each local authority in the UK.\n\nIn general, this shows higher proportions of younger people in more urban areas and higher proportions of older populations in more rural areas. In mid-2022:\n\nareas neighbouring London, Manchester and Birmingham in England, Cardiff in Wales, and Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland had a higher proportion of children aged under 16 years than the national average\n\nthe areas with the greatest proportions of people aged 65 years or over were predominantly located in the South West, around the south and east coasts of England, around the west coast of Scotland or in central and western areas of Wales\n\nFigure 2: Interactive map comparing local authority age structure in UK: mid-2022\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\nFigure 3 is an interactive map that shows the median age and population density of each area.\n\nFigure 3: Interactive map comparing local authority median age and population density in UK: mid-2022\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\nPopulation density gives the population per square kilometre. The interactive map in Figure 3 shows that areas in and around major cities, particularly London and Birmingham, are the most densely populated.\n\nLondon boroughs account for the 20 most densely populated areas in the UK. The highest population density in the UK, of 16,500 people per square kilometre, is found in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. This is followed by Islington with 14,800 people per square kilometre.\n\nMost local authorities in Scotland and Wales have lower population densities than is typical of the UK. Exceptions include cities such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Cardiff as well as their respective surrounding areas. Of the 15 local authorities in the UK with population densities of less than 50 people per square kilometre, 11 were in Scotland, 3 in Wales, and 1 in Northern Ireland.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n4. Upcoming population estimates\n\nMid-2023 population estimates\n\nWe plan to publish population estimates for England and Wales in Summer 2024. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) also plan to release mid-2023 population estimates for Northern Ireland in Summer 2024.\n\nMid-2023 population estimates for the UK will be released to coincide with the release of estimates for Scotland. The schedule for these is yet to be announced.\n\nRebased UK population estimates\n\nA full UK revised series will be published after Scotland has undertaken rebasing to revise its annual mid-year population estimates for 2012 to 2021 using the 2022 census.\n\nA revised back series of population estimates for the period 2012 to 2021 was released in November 2023 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These estimates were based on the 2021 censuses.\n\nFuture developments\n\nWe are continuously looking to improve the statistics on population and migration so that they reflect changes in society and technology and better meet user needs (for more information, see our Overview of statistics transformation web page). As we look to make greater use of administrative data we are:\n\nconsidering how to use new data sources and methods to support more timely, inclusive, and relevant estimates\n\nseeking to continuously improve the quality of our outputs in line with our Statistical Quality Improvement Strategy and our Data Strategy\n\nundertaking further work to help users understand statistical uncertainty associated with the estimates\n\nIn December, we published our latest admin-based population estimates (ABPEs) using our dynamic population model (DPM) (see our DPM, improvements to data sources methodology). This approach uses a range of data sources, such as administrative and survey data. These estimates are official statistics in development. The responses to our Consultation on the future of population and migration statistics in England and Wales will inform our longer-term transformation plans. Over the coming months, we will be reviewing the responses we have received and sharing more details on how this will shape the future of population and migration statistics.\n\nBack to table of contents"
