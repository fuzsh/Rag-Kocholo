        "text": "--\n\nI. Parties Involved:\n\nChild Involved:\n\nC, born January 6, 2019 (5 years old)\n\n--\n\nII. Facts:\n\n1. M has been involved in a tumultuous relationship with F, characterized by domestic violence and substance misuse.\n\n2. F has a significant criminal history, particularly concerning domestic violence against previous partners and children, dating back to 2012. He has mental health difficulties that adversely affect his parenting abilities.\n\n3. M initially relocated to Scotland to escape F but later returned to Darlington, failing to take adequate preventive measures to protect C from potential harm.\n\n4. M has had access to professional help but has not consistently engaged with drug and alcohol services. She admits to using cannabis multiple times a week but does not perceive herself as dependent.\n\n5. Following a domestic violence incident in January 2023, police intervention was required when F attempted suicide in M's home.\n\n6. C is at risk of both physical and emotional harm due to the ongoing domestic abuse between M and F, as well as the substance misuse issues of both parents.\n\n7. On August 16, 2023, the court issued an interim care order favoring the local authority after M was evicted from a refuge due to aggressive behavior and alcohol misuse.\n\n8. M has been inconsistent in sharing information with social services, particularly regarding F's breaches of a non-molestation order.\n\n9. C expressed to her guardian that F had visited her home and brought her a present during Christmas, contradicting M's previous statements.\n\n10. The local authority has expressed concerns regarding M's alcohol consumption and her failure to be forthcoming with information.\n\n--\n\nIII. Legal Issues:\n\n1. Whether C should remain in M's care or be removed to long-term foster care based on the risks posed by the parents' behaviors.\n\n2. Whether M's alcohol consumption and dishonesty regarding F's presence constitute sufficient grounds for intervention under section 31 of the Children Act 1989.\n\n3. The applicability of the welfare checklist under section 1(3) of the Children Act 1989 in determining C's best interests.\n\n--\n\nIV. Arguments:\n\nLocal Authority:\n\nThe risks associated with C remaining in M's care are too high, given the history of domestic violence, substance misuse, and M's lack of transparency regarding F's involvement.\n\nC cannot be safely cared for by M, and a plan for long-term foster care should be approved to ensure her safety and well-being.\n\nM:\n\nM asserts that her alcohol use does not negatively impact her ability to care for C, and there is no evidence to suggest that C is at risk in her care.\n\nM acknowledges her mistakes but emphasizes her commitment to C's welfare and the low likelihood of F being a future risk.\n\n--\n\nV. Court's Analysis:\n\n1. The court acknowledges the complex dynamics of the parental relationship and the potential risks posed to C. However, it also recognizes M's capacity to provide a high standard of care despite her alcohol issues.\n\n2. The court finds that M's past dishonesty regarding F's presence does not necessarily indicate a pattern of behavior that would justify the removal of C.\n\n3. The emotional harm caused to C by being instructed to keep secrets is recognized, but the court believes that this does not outweigh the overall positive care M provides.\n\n4. The court concludes that the risks associated with M's alcohol consumption are manageable and that C's welfare needs are best met in her mother's care, subject to a supervision order.\n\n--\n\nVI. Conclusion:\n\nThe court ultimately decides not to approve the local authority's plan for C to be removed from M's care under a care order. Instead, it opts for a supervision order, allowing M to retain parental responsibility while ensuring a structured support plan is in place to monitor and assist with C's welfare.\n\n--\n\nVII. Recommendations:\n\nThe local authority is invited to reassess its position in light of the court's findings and to consider the implementation of a supervision order supported by a comprehensive safety plan to ensure C's ongoing safety and well-being in her mother's care.\n\n--\n\nVIII.
