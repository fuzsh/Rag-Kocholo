        "text": "Darlington Borough Council (22 013 512)\n\nCategory : Adult care services > Charging\n\nDecision : Upheld\n\nDecision date : 01 Nov 2023\n\nThe Ombudsman's final decision:\n\nSummary: Mrs X complains about how the Council dealt with her adult child’s, Mr Y, financial assessment and its consideration of his disability related expenditure request. She also complains about the Council’s poor communication with her and how it dealt with her complaint. Mrs X says the Council’s failings caused injustice to her and Mr Y. There were faults by the Council which caused Mr Y and Mrs X injustice. The Council has agreed to take action to remedy the injustice caused.\n\nThe complaint\n\nMrs X complains on behalf of herself and her adult child, Mr Y. She has a court‑appointed deputyship.\n\nMrs X complains about how the Council dealt with Mr Y’s financial assessment. In particular the Council’s:\n\ndelay in dealing with and making a decision about Mr Y’s disability related expenditure which was requested in May 2022\n\nfailure to properly consider Mr Y’s disability related expenditure request\n\ndelay in responding to her complaint and other correspondence she sent to it about Mr Y’s disability related expenditure issue.\n\nAs a result, Mrs X says the Council’s failings caused ongoing financial strain and loss to Mr Y. Mr Y has to pay an additional £14 per week for the day care provision he attends on top of his assessed care cost contribution.\n\nMrs X also says the matter caused distress and uncertainty to her and Mr Y. She says the matter has caused her frustration and the time and trouble chasing the Council for updates and in complaining.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Ombudsman’s role and powers\n\nWe investigate complaints about ‘maladministration’ and ‘service failure’. In this statement, I have used the word fault to refer to these. We must also consider whether any fault has had an adverse impact on the person making the complaint. I refer to this as ‘injustice’. If there has been fault which has caused an injustice, we may suggest a remedy. (Local Government Act 1974, sections 26(1) and 26A(1), as amended)\n\nAn organisation should not adopt a blanket or uniform approach or policy that prevents it from considering the circumstances of a particular case. We may find fault in the actions of organisations that ‘fetter their discretion’ in this way.\n\nIf we are satisfied with an organisation’s actions or proposed actions, we can complete our investigation and issue a decision statement. (Local Government Act 1974, section 30(1B) and 34H(i), as amended)\n\nBack to top\n\nHow I considered this complaint\n\nI discussed the complaint with Mrs X and considered the information she provided. I considered the information the Council provided in response to my enquiries.\n\nI sent Mrs X and the Council a copy of my draft decision and considered all comments received before reaching a final decision.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat I found\n\nLegislation and Guidance\n\nThe Care Act 2014, the Care and Support Statutory Guidance and the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014 set out the Council’s duties towards adults who require care and support and its powers to charge.\n\nThe Council has a duty to assess adults who have a need for care and support. If the needs assessment identifies eligible needs, the Council will provide a support plan which outlines what services are required to meet the needs and a personal budget which sets out the costs to meet the needs.\n\nThe threshold for eligibility is based on identifying how a person’s needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how these impact on their wellbeing.\n\nCouncils must assess a person’s finances to decide what contribution he or she should make to a personal budget for care. Direct payments are a funding choice in personal budgets. They allow a person to purchase their own care and support services, with the aim of maximising the person’s involvement and control over how their needs are met.\n\nIn some circumstances, councils may choose to treat a person as if a financial assessment had been carried out. In order to do so, the council must be satisfied on the basis of evidence provided by the person that they can afford, and will continue to be able to afford, any charges due. This is known as a ‘light-touch’ financial assessment.\n\nPeople receiving local authority-arranged care and support other than in a care home need to keep a certain level of income to cover their living costs. Under the Care Act 2014, charges must not reduce people’s income below a certain amount, but local authorities can allow people to keep more of their income if they wish. This is a weekly amount and is known as the minimum income guarantee (MIG).\n\nCouncils can take disability related benefits into account when calculating how much someone should pay towards the cost of their care. When doing so, a council should make an assessment to allow the person to keep enough benefit to pay for necessary disability related expenditure (DRE) to meet any needs it is not meeting.\n\nDREs are expenses a person has to pay which are connected to their illness or disability. They are an allowance in a person’s financial assessment and reduce their weekly charge. Government guidance provides a list of examples of such expenditure. The guidance states there is no definitive list of DRE and any reasonable additional costs directly related to a person's disability should be included. What counts as DRE should not be limited to what is necessary for care and support.\n\nOne of the methods through which another person may manage the financial affairs of a person who lacks capacity is through deputyship. A deputy is appointed by the Court of Protection to manage a person’s affairs, in the event that they lack capacity and have not made a lasting power of attorney.\n\nThe Council’s DRE Policy and DRE Checklist\n\nAllowable DRE will be for expenditure deemed necessary as a result of disability or condition or for health and safety reasons. The Council may be required to assess the need for DRE.\n\nIn assessing DRE, the Council will take into account any reasonable additional costs directly related to a person’s disability. And it may be reasonable for the Council not to allow for items where a reasonable alternative is available at lesser cost.\n\nAll individuals whether in receipt of disability related benefits or not, will be asked if they have any DRE and the cost of this will be assessed and given as a disregard/allowance in line with Council policy. A checklist will be made available which will support individuals to identify DRE.\n\nExpenditure must be identified in consultation with the individual and by reference to the support plan and/or with advice from the relevant professional.\n\nDecisions in each case must be reasonable. It must take into account an individual’s assessed eligible needs and capacity and the actual expenditure, whether a cheaper alternative is reasonably available to the individual.\n\nHolidays – the Council will allow additional reasonable costs for disability related adaptations, plus the cost of accommodation for a service user’s Personal Assistant, if they have one.\n\nThe Council’s adult social care complaints procedure\n\nInvestigations into an adult social care complaints will be done within 30 working days and up to a maximum of 6 months.\n\nWhile the regulations allow a maximum of 6 months to investigate a complaint, the Council will try to respond to a complaint within 30 working days. If it is not going to be possible to investigate a complaint within 30 working days, the Investigating Officer will contact the complainant and explain the reason why.\n\nWhat happened\n\nThis chronology includes key events in this case and does not cover everything that happened.\n\nMr Y has severe learning difficulties and some other health conditions. Mr Y lives in supported living accommodation. He receives a care and support package from the Council to meet his needs via direct payment (DP). Mr Y attends a Day Care provision twice a week which is also paid for through his DP.\n\nIn May 2022, the Council completed a light-touch financial assessment for Mr Y. The Council issued Mr Y and Mrs X a notification letter of Mr Y’s assessed contribution. The Council in its notification letter advised Mrs X to contact it if the amount it used for Mr Y’s calculation was incorrect or if his disability related expenditure (DRE) differed from its assessment. There was no telephone number provided on the Council’s letter.\n\nMrs X immediately sent an email to the Council. She said Mr Y had some DRE to claim and she asked the Council to consider this.\n\nBetween May and August 2022, Mrs X chased the Council for updates on Mr Y’s DRE request. She called and sent emails to the Council on several occasions with no reply. Mrs X said the times when her calls were answered, she was passed from one department to the another with no resolution provided.\n\nIn mid-August 2022, the Council contacted Mrs X and asked her to provide it with the costs and further information about Mr Y’s requested DRE.\n\nMrs X sent the Council the breakdown of Mr Y’s DREs for the extra cost incurred for his Day Care provision and for the support staff hotel accommodation during Mr Y’s holidays. She said Mr Y paid these costs from his personal funds. Mrs X said the Day Care provision Mr Y attended charged £50 which was more than his DP of £42.98. She said as a result Mr Y was making an additional payment of £14.04 a week for his sessions at the Day Care provision. She said she could provide the Council with all the DRE invoices if required.\n\nIn October 2022, Mrs X made a formal complaint to the Council. She complained about the Council’s poor communication with her, the lack of the Council’s full contact details on its correspondence and its delays and failure to deal with Mr Y’s DRE request since May 2022.\n\nMrs X chased the Council for its response to her complaint and the DRE she requested for Mr Y. When Mrs X received no response, she made a complaint to the Ombudsman.\n\nIn February 2023, the Council completed a care and support needs reassessment for Mr Y. His support plan showed the Council agreed two DPs for Mr Y’s Day Care provision. Both DPs (£37.98 and £53.54) covered the period July 2015 to April 2023.\n\nAt the end of June 2023, the Council issued its response to Mrs X’s complaint. The Council accepted and apologised for its delays in dealing with Mr Y’s DRE request, its delays in responding to Mrs X’s complaint and its poor communication with her. The Council upheld Mrs X’s complaint. It said it would remind its financial assessment team about the importance of answering telephone calls and responding to emails in a timely manner. The Council also said it would complete Mr Y’s financial assessment within one week of its response letter and would pay £100 to Mrs X in recognition of the inconvenience caused to her.\n\nIn July 2023, the Council completed a new financial assessment for Mr Y. It considered but refused Mr Y’s DRE request. For the support staff holiday accommodation cost, the Council confirmed the staff had stayed in the same room with Mr Y during the holiday periods. It said there were no additional accommodation costs incurred and, on that basis, it refused the holiday DRE. The Council also refused the Day Care provision DRE top up. It said it was Mr Y’s choice to attend a provision which cost more than his allocated DP. The Council provided Mrs X with a list of some of its managed Day Care services, the costs of which were within Mr Y’s allocated DP.\n\nMrs X contacted the Council about its refusal of Mr Y’s DRE request. She explained that Mr Y and the other residents at his supported living accommodation went on the group holidays. She said the holiday costs were charged per person and not per room. Mrs X also explained that due to Mr Y’s severe learning difficulties, the support staff needed to stay in the same room with him during those holidays to keep him safe. With the Day Care provision, Mrs X said the list of the Council’s managed services which it sent to her were not suitable to meet Mr Y’s needs. She said Mr Y’s DP was also not enough to cover the cost of a suitable provision such as the one he was attending.\n\nIn October 2023, the Council issued its notification letter of Mr Y’s assessed contribution and DRE decision. The Council maintained its refusal of Mr Y’s DRE request based on its initial reasons.\n\nIn response to our enquiries, the Council said:\n\nits delays in dealing with Mr Y’s DRE requests and Mrs X’s complaint were due to staff workload\n\nit had completed all the recommendations it made in its response letter to Mrs X’s complaint. For example, it reminded staff of the importance of effective communication with service users, it completed a new financial assessment for Mr Y in July 2023 and paid a £100 financial remedy to Mrs X\n\nit refused Mr Y’s Day Care provision DRE because there are other Day Care services that charge within Mr Y’s agreed DP and that the list of these services was sent to Mrs X in July 2023\n\nMrs X provided it with details of Mr Y’s holiday as a group holiday (with his co‑tenants), but it was unable to consider Mr Y’s DRE request as a group holiday because DPs are paid to individuals. It also said each individual has their own assessed needs identified in their care and support plan. So, this aspect of Mr Y’s DRE request was refused\n\nfor DRE requests, it considers the following 3 questions:\n\nis the expense incurred because of the person’s disability?\n\nis the cost reasonably incurred, is there a cheaper or alternative way to meet the need?\n\nis there proof of the expense incurred?\n\nif Mr Y needs additional support whilst on holiday which is above his current assessed hours, a review would be required and if agreed, additional support hours would be added to his DP rather than as a DRE request\n\nit has agreed with Mrs X that Mr Y’s next financial reassessment will be completed face-to-face and not as a light-touch assessment.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMy findings are:\n\nThere were faults in how the Council dealt with Mr Y’s DRE request, Mrs X’s complaint and its communication with Mrs X.\n\nMrs X made a DRE request on behalf of Mr Y in May 2022. The Council considered the request in July 2023 and issued its decision letter in October 2023. It took the Council approximately 17 months to consider and decide Mr Y’s DRE request. This was a significant delay and was fault. This caused distress, worry and uncertainty to Mr Y and Mrs X. The delay also caused Mrs X frustration and the time and trouble chasing the Council.\n\nThe Council considered Mr Y’s DRE request in 2023 and refused it.\n\nIt is not the role of the Ombudsman to carry out a financial assessment or to say whether Mr Y’s DRE request should have been approved. Our role is to investigate whether the Council has properly considered Mr Y’s care and support needs, his finances and the relevant facts, legislation, guidance and policies in its decision making about his DRE request.\n\nAccording to the government guidance, DREs are expenses a person has to pay which are connected to their illness or disability. While the guidance provides a list of examples of DREs, it states there is no definitive list and that any reasonable additional costs directly related to a person's disability should be included.\n\nThe reasons the Council’s gave for its refusal of the DRE request indicate that it failed to properly consider the request in line with government guidance and the 3 questions detailed in paragraph 41 e.\n\nThere was no evidence the Council considered if Mr Y required the services of the support staff during the holidays due to his disabilities. This is a fundamental principle of DREs. Mrs X provided the Council with further explanation that the support staff needed to stay in the same room with Mr Y during those holidays to keep him safe due to his severe learning difficulties. This should have prompted the Council to consider if the support staff hotel accommodation cost was connected to Mr Y’s disabilities. There was no evidence this happened. This was fault.\n\nThe Council adopted a rigid approach to its decision making when it said it was unable to consider Mr Y’s DRE because it was a group holiday. It said no additional costs were incurred by Mr Y because the support staff stayed in the same room with him. Mrs X explained that Mr Y went on a group holiday with his co‑tenants. She provided a breakdown of the charges Mr Y incurred on those holidays. She also explained the holidays were charged per person and not per room, so the fact support staff shared Mr Y’s room overnight was irrelevant. Mrs X offered to provide Mr Y’s holiday invoices if required. The Council failed to request the invoices when it considered this aspect of Mr Y’s DRE. The invoices could have provided the Council with more information to help inform its decision making about the DRE request. This was fault.\n\nThe Council also refused the Day Care provision DRE top up because it said it was Mr Y’s choice to attend somewhere that cost more than his allocated DP. It said Mr Y could have chosen a provider from the list of the Council’s managed Day Care services whose costs were within his DP allocation. Even if Mr Y were to attend an alternative provision this may still have cost more than his allocated DP. In Mr Y’s support plan, the Council agreed two DPs for his Day Care provision. Both DPs (£37.98 and £53.54) covered the period of Mr Y’s DRE request. The DP information was unclear and this was fault. It caused confusion and uncertainty to Mrs X as to which of the two DPs applied to Mr Y’s Day Care provision.\n\nThe Council failed to properly consider whether its managed Day Care services were suitable to meet Mr Y’s individual care and support needs. The Council adopted a blanket policy in relation to the Day Care provision DRE request and it failed to consider the Mr Y’s specific circumstances. This contradicts the Council’s statement in its DRE decision letter to Mr Y and Mrs X which stated, “DPs allow flexibility when arranging day care services”. This was fault.\n\nThe Council’s failings in dealing with Mr Y’s DRE request caused distress and uncertainty to Mr Y and Mrs X.\n\nThe Council also failed to effectively communicate and respond to Mrs X’s correspondence to it. It failed to include full contact details on its letters to aid service users’ access to relevant departments when required. It caused distress and frustration to Mrs X. The Council had acknowledged and apologised to Mrs X for its poor communication with her. I also note recent Council correspondence now have its full contact details which is welcome.\n\nThere was significant delay in the Council’s complaint handling. Mrs X made a formal complaint to the Council in October 2022, and it issued its response in June 2023. The Council took approximately 9 months to deal with Mrs X’s complaint. This was fault. The Council failed to notify Mrs X when it was unable to issue its response letter within the maximum of 6 months in line with its policy. This caused distress and frustration to Mrs X.\n\nThe Council acknowledged some of these failings in its own complaint response. It apologised, paid £100 to Mrs X and completed a new financial assessment for Mr Y. However, I do not consider these remedies are sufficient to acknowledge the injustice caused to Mr Y and Mrs X.\n\nBack to top\n\nAgreed action\n\nTo remedy the injustice caused by the faults identified, the Council has agreed within one month of the final decision to:\n\napologise in writing to Mr Y and Mrs X in recognition of the injustice caused by the identified failings above. The apology should be in accordance with our guidance, Making an effective apology.\n\npay Mrs X an additional £100 to acknowledge the distress, frustration and uncertainty caused to her by the Council’s delay in dealing with and making a decision about Mr Y’s disability related expenditure request and the delay in dealing with her complaint.\n\npay Mr Y £150 to acknowledge the uncertainty caused to him by the Council’s delay and its failure to properly consider his DRE request.\n\nreview Mr Y’s DRE request for the cost of the support worker hotel accommodation and the top up cost for his Day Care provision or consider if these should be met by an increase to Mr Y’s direct payments. The assessment should include a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind any decision taken.\n\nreview and provide clear information about Mr Y’s direct payments in his support plan and clearly set out the agreed direct payment for his Day Care provision.\n\nby training or other means remind relevant staff of the importance of properly considering disability related expenditure requests in line with statutory guidance and legislation.\n\nremind staff of the importance of adhering to its Customer Standards when communicating with service users or those who support them.\n\nby training or other means remind staff of the importance of adhering to the Council’s complaints handling process.\n\nExplain to the Ombudsman how the Council will monitor its performance against its complaint response timescales.\n\nThe Council should provide us with evidence it has complied with the above actions.\n\nBack to top\n\nFinal decision\n\nI have found evidence of fault leading to injustice. The agreed actions will remedy the injustice caused.\n\nBack to top\n\nInvestigator's decision on behalf of the Ombudsman\n\nPrint this page"
