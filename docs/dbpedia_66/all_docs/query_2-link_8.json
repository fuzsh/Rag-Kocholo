        "text": "Darlington, town and unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Durham, northeastern England, bounded on the south by the River Tees.\n\nThe main population centre, old Darlington town, lies on the River Skerne near its confluence with the Tees. The town is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and its parish church of St. Cuthbert dates from the 12th century. In the 19th century textile industries were overshadowed by locomotive manufacture and railway repair work. The Stockton and Darlington Railway, the world’s first passenger line, opened in 1825, and Locomotion No. 1, the first steam engine to run on a public railway, is on exhibition in the town’s railway museum. Darlington remains a centre of manufacturing and heavy engineering, but telecommunications and services are increasingly important. Area unitary authority, 77 square miles (198 square km). Pop. (2001) town, 86,082; unitary authority, 97,838; (2011) town, 92,363; unitary authority, 105,564."
