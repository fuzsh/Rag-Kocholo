While the root causes are many, it is the undeniable, steady pace of climate chaos that is magnifying the dangers and creating sweeping changes to our land, with rising temperatures, perpetual drought, and invasive species and diseases all taking a toll on forests, rangelands, and urban trees. To combat the multifaceted problems created by the changing climate and the resulting incidence of high-intensity wildfire, this bill provides funding to reduce risk to communities, protect municipal watersheds, restore the landscape, promote responsible biomass use from hazardous fuels, and create associated jobs. This bill also provides funding for wildfire smoke preparedness, a competitive grant program to States, federally recognized Tribes, schools, and non-profits help prevent, abate, and research wildfire smoke hazards in community buildings. Federal Firefighter Workforce.--Firefighters are on the front line for responding to these wildfire events. It is clear that Federal firefighters need support to combat the real danger of injury and fatigue that is another consequence of higher incidence of catastrophic wildfires and year-round fire. This includes better pay, appropriate equipment, improved housing and facilities, health and wellness support, and transitioning seasonal jobs into more permanent positions. The President's budget submission included a package of firefighter pay-related legislative proposals and the Committee awaits authorization committee action to enact those proposals. The Committee is committed to providing the required resources to implement these compensation reforms once they are enacted. This bill provides funding to initiate health and wellness programs to address issues of physical and mental fatigue and continues funding for additional fire positions and firefighter housing and facilities. In addition to the funding provided through annual appropriations provided in this bill, the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service should leverage resources available through the Legacy Restoration Fund to meet identified housing and fire facility needs. It is the Committee's expectation that every Federal firefighter is adequately outfitted with individual personal protective equipment [PPE] and each firefighting unit has the appropriate equipment prior to being assigned to an incident. As normal wear and tear occurs, PPE should be replaced as soon as possible at an incident or at the home unit as needed. The Office of Wildland Fire and the Forest Service are directed to evaluate the provision of supplies during this fire season and report to the Committee on any issues related to cost trends, supply chain or other challenges to providing the appropriate materials. Plastic Waste on Public Lands.--The Committee applauds Secretarial Order 3407, which aims to reduce the procurement, sale, and distribution of single-use plastic products and packaging with a goal of a total phase out of single-use plastic products on all Department-managed lands by 2032. The Committee is optimistic that a phase-out can be complete well before the 10-year window and urges the Department to work quickly to achieve that end. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Committee directs the Department to provide a written plan to the Committee detailing specific steps the Department plans to take and a timeline as the Department moves to phase out single-use plastics. Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.--The Committee is concerned about the crisis of missing, trafficked, and murdered indigenous women that has plagued Native communities. Native American women face high rates of violence and the lack of data on the number of women and girls who go missing or murdered further complicates the Nation's ability to address this crisis. The Committee recommendation includes both funding and directives under the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service in order to improve the Federal response to this epidemic. Budgetary Treatment of Contract Support Costs and 105(l) Tribal Leases.--Due to findings in recent court decisions (see Salazar v. Ramah (132 S. Ct. 2181 (2012)) and Maniilaq Ass'n v. Burwell in both 2014 (72 F. Supp. 3d 227 (D.D.C. 2014)) and 2016 (70 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016))), payments for contract support costs and 105(l) leases appear to create a type of budgetary entitlement that is typically not funded through discretionary appropriations. For contract support costs, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [ISDEAA] of 1975 requires the government to enter into contracts and leases with any willing Tribe and requires that the government pay a Tribe's costs. Section 105(l) of the ISDEAA requires the Secretary, at the request of a Tribe, to enter into a lease with the Tribe for a building used to provide services under the ISDEAA. Reclassification of these costs from a discretionary appropriation to a mandatory appropriated entitlement has been under discussion since the Supreme Court issued its decision in 2012. Deferred Maintenance.--The Committee has made a concerted effort in recent years to address the backlog maintenance needs on our public lands. The National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund [Fund], discussed in more detail below, provides for $1,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2024 to invest in the maintenance backlogs on public lands and Tribal schools. In addition to the amounts allocated for the Fund, the Committee continues to provide discretionary funding for deferred maintenance in an effort to prevent future deferred maintenance backlogs. The Department of the Interior and the Forest Service are directed to maintain updated 5-year deferred maintenance plans that, to the extent practicable, include a list of all outstanding deferred maintenance needs, and to provide them to the Committee on a quarterly basis. Disaster Recovery Needs.--The Committee directs the Department of the Interior and the other agencies funded in this bill to establish quarterly reporting requirements for their component bureaus, regions, offices, and programs, as appropriate, to maintain up-to-date comprehensive information for funding needs related to disaster recovery, which shall be delivered to the Committee within 30 days of a quarter closing. Land Grants, Acequias and Community Ditches.--The Secretaries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture are urged to recognize the traditional use of State-recognized community land grants, acequias, and community ditches in the American Southwest during the land use planning process. The Department of the Interior and the Forest Service shall, in accordance with applicable law, consider and, as appropriate, provide for within land management plans the traditional-historic uses by an acequias or land grant merceds recognized by the State of New Mexico. Training, Hiring, and Public Lands Education in Alaska.-- The directive in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116-94 regarding conducting annual Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act training by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service is continued. The Committee also recognizes the importance of Alaska Public Land Information Centers as partners and tools to educate the public regarding Alaska's unique public lands and encourages the agencies to look for opportunities to strengthen these critical partnerships. Transparency of Information.--Federal agencies funded under this act shall clearly state within the text, audio, or video used for advertising or educational purposes, including emails or Internet postings, that the communication is printed, published, or produced and disseminated at U.S. taxpayer expense. The funds used by a Federal agency to carry out this requirement shall be derived from amounts made available to the agency for advertising or other communications regarding the programs and activities of the agency. Voting-Related Activities.--The Committee directs the Secretary or Administrator to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a briefing, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, regarding any strategic plans developed by the Department or Agency since January 20, 2021 outlining the ways that the Department has promoted voter registration, and voter participation. Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.--All reports, correspondence, and reprogramming requests from the agencies to the Committee shall be provided electronically, in addition to any that are required to be delivered in physical formats. Harassment-Free Workplace.--All agencies funded in this bill are directed to address harassment of employees, including plans to improve monitoring, training, and enforcement, and to implement policies that prevent retaliation. The Department of the Interior, Forest Service, and Environmental Protection Agency are directed to continue reporting annually on agency actions related to these efforts, and other agencies funded in this bill should follow their respective departmental or administrative protocols. The reports should include a detailed list of any actions taken or expected to be taken during fiscal years 2024 and 2025. In-Person Work.--The Committee notes the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-23-15 of April 2023, directing agencies to increase meaningful in-person work and prioritize agency performance when setting telework policy. The OMB memo requires agencies to create ``work environment plans,'' establish routines for assessing organizational health, and identify a set of related performance indicators for current and future work environments. The Committee directs the agencies funded in this bill to work with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and OMB, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, to examine how policies for in-person work, telework, and remote work impact agency productivity and performance as well as how effectively and efficiently agencies are able to carry out their missions and serve the public and to plan ahead for decreases in demand for office space and adjust leasing plans, particularly during lease renewals, to reflect any decreasing demand. The Committee directs the agencies funded in this bill to brief the Committee on these efforts within 180 days of enactment of this act. Everglades Restoration.--The Committee notes that critical progress towards restoring the Everglades ecosystem has been made with several projects to improve infrastructure for enhanced water deliveries nearing completion. The Committee continues to support this multiyear effort to preserve one of the great ecological treasures of the United States and urges the Department of the Interior and its relevant bureaus to ensure that restoration activities, research, and monitoring are not delayed. Beavers and Aquatic Habitat.--The Committee notes that beavers are an important native species across North America, and are a well-known ecosystem engineer with the ability to create new wetlands and improve habitats for a wide array of other species. In addition, the habitats they develop may help with regulating the effects of extreme weather events associated with a changing climate, including creating natural fire breaks, natural carbon capture, and water storage. Federal land managers are encouraged to work with state wildlife managers on beaver conservation, to make planning decisions that recognize beavers' environmental and ecological benefits, and to identify locations where restoration of their habitat may be most beneficial. Transparency of Information Regarding Grants, Agreements, Research, and Conferences Attendance.--Directives regarding Transparency of Information Regarding Grants, Agreements, Research, and Conferences Attendance in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116-260 are also continued. Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act.--The Committee continues to direct the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service to annually post on a centralized agency website the list of Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act [FLREA] (Public Law 108-447) projects and activities performed in each fiscal year, which should include a project or activity title, description, location, and amount obligated, beginning with fiscal year 2023 as practicable. The Committee awaits a report from each land management agency that is unable to complete this directive. Such report shall detail the specific steps the agency plans to take to secure the capabilities needed to provide proper transparency on the spending of FLREA funds. Workforce Housing on Public Lands.--The Committee notes that access to adequate housing facilities is a key component of attracting and retaining a qualified workforce at Federal land management agencies. The Department is directed to continue to prioritize expanding housing availability in future budget requests, including by considering proposals for projects that construct, improve, or maintain adequate housing for land management agency employees. Congressionally Directed Spending The Committee includes congressionally directed spending as defined in section 5(a) of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate. In the interest of providing full disclosure of funding provided in the bill, all projects are listed in a table accompanying this report. The vast majority of congressionally directed spending projects funded in the bill support the improvement of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States. The Committee has confirmed that each funded water infrastructure project is eligible for funding under the State Revolving Funds, the Indian Health Service sanitation deficiency system, or is otherwise certified as eligible. The bill also funds a number of historic preservation projects, each of which the Committee has confirmed is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.). The Committee notes that Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF] projects funded in the bill that were identified by the administration on supplemental lists but that were not a part of the President's fiscal year 2024 request have been identified as congressionally directed spending; LWCF projects requested by the President are not identified as congressionally directed spending. Other funded projects support on-the-ground conservation activities, capital improvement and maintenance within the National Forest System, and forest resiliency and wildfire risk reduction efforts which will further the missions of longstanding programs funded within the bill. National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund The National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund [Fund] was created by the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law 116-152) [GAOA] to address the maintenance backlogs of the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Indian Education. GAOA provides up to $1,900,000,000 in mandatory funding annually for fiscal years 2021-2025 for the Fund and provides the Committee authority to allocate individual projects within legislation providing full- year appropriations for agencies and programs under the jurisdiction of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (54 U.S.C. 200402). A table detailing the allocation of fiscal year 2024 funds by agency, station or unit name, project or activity, and State accompanies this report. The Committee appreciates the efforts by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service to provide detailed project descriptions and estimated costs to the Committee in a timely fashion and to keep the Committee updated on developments affecting funded projects and future projects under consideration. The Committee emphasizes that, pursuant to GAOA, the Committee's project allocations are final and must be adhered to. Land and Water Conservation Fund With enactment of GAOA, Congress provided a permanent appropriation of $900,000,000 per year from the Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF]. Along with other mandatory appropriations, LWCF programs are subject to a 5.7 percent sequestration, with those sequestered amounts becoming available in the subsequent fiscal year. GAOA also mandated that account allocations and detailed project information be proposed by the administration through the President's budget submission, and that such allocations, following review by the Committees on Appropriations, may be modified through an alternate allocation. The Reauthorization of LWCF in Section 3001 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act (Public Law 116-9) required that funding for Federal purchases and for the suite of grant programs providing financial assistance to States each constitute at least 40 percent of total funds available each fiscal year from all sources, annually. That total includes $900,000,000 in mandatory appropriations provided under GAOA, as well as deposits to LWCF under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (Public Law 109- 432) [GOMESA]. These GOMESA deposits amounted to $125,000,000 in fiscal year 2023 and are projected at $118,000,000 in fiscal year 2024. Accordingly, the Committee has taken the full amounts available for LWCF expenditures into account in determining its allocations and expects that future budget submissions will clearly delineate all revenues credited to LWCF and will adhere to statutory requirements in the proposed allocation to Federal and State programs. A detailed table accompanying this report shows the LWCF allocation for fiscal year 2024 by agency, account, activity, and project, including lists of specific Federal land acquisition projects and Forest Legacy Program projects. Based on new information from the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service about project viability and requirements, the Committee has modified the lists from those included in the budget submission. Appraisals.--In LWCF implementation and more broadly, appraisal services play a crucial role in maintaining Federal valuation standards, safeguarding public funds, and ensuring just compensation for landowners. However, the Committee has heard significant concerns about delays and other process issues related to the appraisal function. The Committee has previously admonished the Department and the Forest Service to improve the efficiency of the process across all regions so that projects, including those specifically directed by Congress, are completed in a timely manner. The Committee appreciates the responsiveness to date regarding the directives set forth in fiscal year 2023, and particularly the engagement of stakeholders, to address impediments to an efficient and transparent appraisal process. The Committee awaits the implementation of significant process and policy changes resulting from this work, including new policy for the release of appraisal reports to parties with an active legal interest in a project, and directs the Department and the Forest Service to finalize these changes without delay. The administration should remain on notice that further direction will be forthcoming in the absence of substantive reform. Fish and Wildlife Service.--The Service is expected to provide outreach to all units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, including Clarks, Edwards, Green River, Loxahatchee, McKinney, and Ottawa, to ensure these refuges are accessing all available funding tools, including recreational access and inholdings. The Service is strongly encouraged to begin due diligence work on the accumulating backlog of parcels available at Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. The Committee directs the Service to consider habitat conservation plan land acquisition applications that enhance efforts to establish State research forests through the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund program. Reprogramming Guidelines Reprogramming guidelines for the agencies funded in this bill were codified in Division D of Public Law 116-94 and further described in the accompanying explanatory statement. These guidelines are repeated here for emphasis and reference, and are continued in this bill as a Title IV general provision. The following are the procedures governing reprogramming actions for programs and activities funded in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The agencies funded by this act are reminded that no reprogramming shall be implemented without the advance approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in accordance with the procedures included in this act. The agencies funded in this act are reminded that these reprogramming guidelines are in effect, and must be complied with, until such time as the Committees modify them through bill or report language. Definitions.--``Reprogramming,'' as defined in these procedures, includes the reallocation of funds from one budget activity, budget line-item, or program area to another within any appropriation funded in this act. In cases where either the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations report displays an allocation of an appropriation below that level, the more detailed level shall be the basis for reprogramming. For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy accounts, a reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of funds, including unobligated balances, from one construction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project to another such project. A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant departure from the program described in the agency's budget justifications. This includes all proposed reorganizations or other workforce actions detailed below which affect a total of 10 staff members or 10 percent of the staffing of an affected program or office, whichever is less, even without a change in funding. Any change to the organization table presented in the budget justification shall also be subject to this requirement. Agencies are reminded that these longstanding General Guidelines for Reprogramming require agencies funded by this act to submit reorganization proposals for the Committees' review prior to their implementation. It is noted that such reprogramming guidelines apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce restructure, reshaping, transfer of functions, or bureau-wide downsizing and include closures, consolidations, and relocations of offices, facilities, and laboratories. In addition, no agency shall implement any part of a reorganization that modifies regional or State boundaries for agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of the date of enactment of this act unless approved consistent with the General Guidelines for Reprogramming procedures specified herein. Any such reprogramming request submitted to the Committees on Appropriations shall include a description of anticipated benefits, including anticipated efficiencies and cost-savings, as well as a description of anticipated personnel impacts and funding changes anticipated to implement the proposal. General Guidelines for Reprogramming.-- (a) A reprogramming should be made only when an unforeseen situation arises, and then only if postponement of the project or the activity until the next appropriation year would result in actual loss or damage. (b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred through reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means of further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be sought for the deferred project or activity through the regular appropriations process. (c) Except under the most urgent situations, reprogramming should not be employed to initiate new programs or increase allocations specifically denied or limited by Congress, or to decrease allocations specifically increased by the Congress. (d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval will be considered as expeditiously as possible, and the Committees remind the agencies that in order to process reprogramming requests, adequate and timely information must be provided. Criteria and Exceptions.--A reprogramming must be submitted to the Committees in writing prior to implementation if it exceeds $1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or decrease of more than 10 percent annually in affected programs or projects, whichever amount is less, with the following exceptions: (a) With regard to the Tribal priority allocations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and Bureau of Indian Education [BIE], there is no restriction on reprogrammings among these programs. However, the Bureaus shall report on all reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no later than 60 days after the end of the fiscal year. (b) With regard to the EPA, the Committees do not require reprogramming requests associated with the States and Tribes Partnership Grants or up to a cumulative total of $5,000,000 from carryover balances among the individual program areas delineated in the Environmental Programs and Management account, with no more than $1,000,000 coming from any individual program area. No funds, however, shall be reallocated from individual Geographic Programs. (c) With regard to the National Park Service, the Committees do not require reprogramming requests associated with the park base within the Park Management activity in the Operation of the National Park System Account. The Service is required to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on spending trends for the park base within 60 days of enactment of this act. Assessments.--``Assessment'' as defined in these procedures shall refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget activity or budget line item for costs associated with general agency administrative costs, overhead costs, working capital expenses, or contingencies. (a) No assessment shall be levied against any program, budget activity, subactivity, budget line item, or project funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act unless such assessment and the basis therefore are presented to the Committees in the budget justifications and are subsequently approved by the Committees. The explanation for any assessment in the budget justification shall show the amount of the assessment, the activities assessed, and the purpose of the funds. (b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such estimates were presented in annual budget justifications, shall be submitted through the reprogramming process and shall be subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as any other reprogramming. (c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes assessments shall submit an annual report to the Committees, which provides details on the use of all funds assessed from any other budget activity, line item, subactivity, or project. (d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be used to finance projects and activities disapproved or limited by Congress or to finance programs or activities that could be foreseen and included in the normal budget review process. (e) New programs requested in the budget should not be initiated before enactment of the bill without notification to, and the approval of, the Committees. This restriction applies to all such actions regardless of whether a formal reprogramming of funds is required to begin the program. Quarterly Reports.--All reprogrammings between budget activities, budget line-items, program areas, or the more detailed activity levels shown in this recommendation, including those below the monetary thresholds established above, shall be reported to the Committees within 60 days of the end of each quarter and shall include cumulative totals for each budget activity or budget line item, or construction, land acquisition, or forest legacy project. Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest Legacy.--Lands shall not be acquired for more than the approved appraised value, as addressed in section 301 (3) of Public Law 91-646, unless such acquisitions are submitted to the Committees on Appropriations for approval in compliance with these procedures. Land Exchanges.--Land exchanges, wherein the estimated value of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000, shall not be consummated until the Committees have had 30 days in which to examine the proposed exchange. In addition, the Committees shall be provided advance notification of exchanges valued between $500,000 and $1,000,000. Budget Structure.--The budget activity or line item structure for any agency appropriation account shall not be altered without advance approval of the Committees. TITLE I DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR LAND AND WATER RESOURCES Bureau of Land Management The Bureau of Land Management [Bureau or BLM] manages more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in 11 Western States and Alaska. The Bureau also has responsibility for 700 million acres of federally owned subsurface mineral estate. The Bureau is mandated to administer these lands for multiple uses, including recreation, wildlife habitat, mineral and energy production, timber harvesting, and rangeland grazing, while managing natural, cultural, and historical resources. MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES Appropriations, 2023.................................... $1,368,969,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 1,497,069,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,371,619,000 The bill provides $1,371,619,000 for Management of Lands and Resources, $3,650,000 above the enacted level and $125,450,000 below the request. The detailed allocation of funding by program and activity is included in the table accompanying this report. Program directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the following narrative. Wild Horse and Burro Management.--The bill provides $147,888,000 for wild horse and burro activities, including $11,000,000 to continue implementation of a robust and humane fertility control strategy of reversible immunocontraceptive vaccines. The Committee expects the Bureau to continue its efforts to reach appropriate management levels with specific attention on increasing the use of fertility control, including measurable objectives in reducing population growth with fertility controls, targeting removals from the most heavily ecologically impacted and populated areas, expanding long-term, off-range humane holding, and continuing adoptions while fully implementing and enforcing existing safeguards. The Bureau will follow the directives included in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 117-103. The Committee appreciates the Bureau's commitment to quarterly briefings on the state of the program and directs that these briefings continue in fiscal year 2024. Land Management Priorities.--The bill provides $150,000 for congressionally directed spending in this program. A detailed list of projects is included in the ``Congressionally Directed Spending'' table accompanying this report. Wildlife Habitat Management.--The bill provides no less than $35,000,000 for threatened and endangered species activities. Sage-Grouse.--The bill provides no less than $71,000,000 for sage-grouse conservation activities within Wildlife Habitat Management. Greater sage-grouse conservation funding is set apart because the Committee expects that these funds will result in increased capacity and expertise in ecological restoration, continued implementation of the National Seed Strategy, and reduction of invasive plants through monitoring, early detection, and targeted removal, specific to habitat improvements for sage-grouse. Increasing the success of restoring sagebrush plant communities, particularly after burned events, is critical to conserving the broader sagebrush ecosystem. The Bureau is expected to use the multiple existing and relevant strategies for sagebrush restoration to increase the success of projects that restore burned, degraded, or otherwise unhealthy habitat. Further, the Committee expects the Bureau to only use these funds for native, genetically- appropriate plant species in revegetation and restoration activities in sage-grouse habitat. Plant Conservation Activities.--The bill provides no less than $20,600,000 for plant conservation and restoration. The Bureau should use these resources to increase botanical and ecological restoration capacity, implement the Seed Strategy and National Academy of Sciences recommendations for addressing native seed supplies, and detect and remove invasive plants. The Committee expects the Bureau to accelerate the research agenda identified in the Seed Strategy, support the interagency Native Plant Materials Development program, the Seeds of Success program, the Plant Conservation Alliance, regional native plant materials development programs, and related activities. The Committee appreciates that the Plant Conservation and Restoration Program has been working with the InterTribal Nursery Council and supporting Tribal Nations to build capacity, mentor Tribal youth, and support seed infrastructure for native plant materials development and recommends at least $2,000,000 to support collaborative ecocultural restoration activities with Tribal Nations using Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science to advance climate resilient plant communities on public lands. Energy and Minerals.--The bill provides no less than $30,900,000 for legacy well remediation to maintain program capacity and continue progress toward cleanup of the next cluster of legacy wells in need of remediation. Alaska Conveyance.--The bill provides $31,654,000 for Alaska conveyance. The Committee recognizes the importance of the Bureau of Land Management Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Allotment Program and continues funding at the enacted level to ensure the Bureau has the resources to conduct the necessary field survey work to complete these allotments before the program's deadline of December 29, 2025. National Conservation Lands.--The bill provides $63,599,000 for National Conservation Lands, including $11,000,000 for National Scenic and Historic Trails. In order to meet national conservation goals, sustain increased visitation, enhance visitor experiences, and administer the system's expansion, the Bureau must complete land use plans for these special places. The Committee expects the Bureau to continue to prioritize planning associated with recently designated or expanded monuments, including Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. Additional Guidance.--The Committee provides the following additional guidance related to activities funded in this account. Western Oregon.--The Bureau is directed to develop a new agreement with the State of Oregon addressing financial oversight and accountability that maintains or enhances the current level of fire protection for western Oregon forestlands through the Western Oregon Operating Plan agreement. The Bureau is further directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels treatments and report annually on the amount spent, as well as the scope of hazardous fuels management required across BLM- managed lands, including Oregon and California Grant Lands. The Ambler Access Project.--The Bureau is directed to provide the Committee with monthly status reports on the progress of the Ambler Access Project Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. Mineral Resources.--The Committee recognizes the importance of domestic mineral production and directs the Bureau to provide quarterly updates on the Interagency Working Group on Mining Regulations efforts to encourage domestic mineral development. Metallurgical Coal.--The Bureau is directed to brief the Committee regarding barriers to finalizing pending lease applications for metallurgical coal within 60 days of enactment of this act. Potash.--The Bureau is directed to carry out safety studies required under Secretarial Order 3324 to determine if there is any additional risk from gas migration to underground potash miners in the Designated Potash Area in New Mexico resulting from new oil and gas drilling technologies. Energy Transmission Across Federal Lands.--The Committee encourages the Bureau to coordinate with the Department of Energy to ensure appropriate understanding of the impact of Bureau policy and regulation on the high voltage electric transmission system and to brief the Committee on the Bureau's efforts to incorporate energy transmission considerations into its rulemaking processes within 180 days of enactment of this act. Rio Puerco Watershed.--The Committee reiterates its support for the Rio Puerco Watershed Program and encourages the Bureau to continue its financial support. Tribal Contracting.--The Committee reminds the Bureau that contracts with Tribes issued pursuant to the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act should include payment for overhead to cover administrative and support costs for work conducted under the contract. Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands.--The Committee expects the Bureau to fully cooperate with the appraisal committee to determine whether the county payments are being made in accordance with the Coos Bay Wagon Road Act (Public Law 76-85). The Committee believes the land should be appraised in a manner that reflects the differences in how Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant lands are managed compared to private lands of similar character, including restrictions on timber activities. The Committee also expects that Sudden Oak Death treatments will continue at current levels. Range Management.--The Bureau is directed, to the greatest extent practicable, to make vacant grazing allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease when lands covered by the holder of the permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wildfire. Grazing Allotments.--The Bureau must prioritize management of active allotments that are not meeting land health standards or do not have current assessments and reduce the backlog of active grazing permits that require analysis and new management decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act. These actions should be taken in concert with a renewed focus on habitat conservation and reducing land degradation. Signage for Wilderness Areas.--The Committee directs the Bureau to ensure that the public is adequately informed regarding the lands protected as well as routes that are open or closed with properly posted and maintained signage for the areas protected by Public Law 116-9. Tribal Coordination on Energy.--The Bureau is directed to continue to fulfill its fiduciary trust responsibilities by coordinating with Fort Berthold Tribal authorities for activities that impact the Fort Berthold Reservation. Soda Ash.--In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act and the Non-Energy Leasing minerals rule, the Bureau set a ten- year, industry-wide royalty rate of 2 percent on January 1, 2021, for all existing and future Federal soda ash and sodium bicarbonate leases. Resource Management Planning.--The Committee understands the Bureau will presently finalize the resource management plan amendments currently underway for Greater sage-grouse conservation and strongly encourages using available conservation tools to provide the level of protection necessary to reverse population declines based on best available science. Strategic Workforce Planning.--The Bureau is directed to brief the Committee on its strategic workforce planning effort within 60 days of enactment of this act. OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS Appropriations, 2023.................................... $120,334,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 132,741,000 Committee recommendation................................ 121,334,000 The bill provides $121,334,000 for Oregon and California Grant Lands, an increase of $1,000,000 above the enacted level and $11,407,000 below the request. The detailed allocation of funding by activity is included in the table accompanying this report. The Bureau is directed to aggressively target hazardous fuels treatments and report annually on the amount spent, as well as the scope of hazardous fuels management required across Oregon and California Grant Lands; and to regularly report timber sale accomplishments for sales that have been sold and awarded rather than merely offered for sale. The Bureau is expected to report these activities in a manner consistent with the Forest Service and only count awarded volume. The Committee appreciates the Bureau's commitment to treating Sudden Oak Death syndrome and provides funding adequate to continue these activities. RANGE IMPROVEMENTS Appropriations, 2023.................................... $10,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 10,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 10,000,000 The bill provides $10,000,000 for range improvements, equal to the enacted level and the request. SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES Appropriations, 2023.................................... $30,000,000 Offsetting collections.............................. -30,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 30,000,000 Offsetting collections.............................. -30,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 30,000,000 Offsetting collections.............................. -30,000,000 The bill provides $30,000,000 for service charges, deposits, and forfeitures. The appropriation is fully offset by the collection of fees to pay for reasonable administrative and other costs. MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS Appropriations, 2023.................................... $26,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 26,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 26,000,000 The bill provides $26,000,000 for miscellaneous trust funds, equal to the enacted level and the request. FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [Service] is the principal Federal agency responsible for conserving, protecting, and enhancing fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats. The Service manages more than 150 million acres in the National Wildlife Refuge System, which encompasses 568 national wildlife refuges, thousands of small wetlands, and other special management areas and Marine National Monuments. It also operates 72 national fish hatcheries, 65 fish and wildlife management offices, and 80 ecological services field stations. The agency enforces Federal wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species Act [ESA] (Public Law 93- 205), manages migratory bird populations, restores nationally significant fisheries, conserves and restores wildlife habitat such as wetlands, and helps foreign governments with their conservation efforts. It also oversees the Federal Assistance program, which distributes hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes on fishing and hunting equipment to State fish and wildlife agencies. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $1,555,684,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 1,854,058,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,586,086,000 The bill provides $1,586,086,000 for Resource Management. This amount is $30,402,000 more than the enacted level and $267,972,000 less than the budget request. All programs and subactivities included are continued at enacted levels unless otherwise specified below. The detailed allocation of funding by program and activity is included in the table accompanying this report. Program directives and specific funding requirements are noted in the following narrative. Internal transfers are accounted for and articulated below. Ecological Services.--The bill provides $298,733,000 for Ecological Services activities. This amount is $2,700,000 above the enacted level $85,754,000. Within the Ecological Services program, funding is provided as follows: Listing.--The bill provides $23,398,000 for endangered species listing activities. The Service is directed to brief the Committee on its work plan for this funding as it relates to petition activities, listing of foreign species, and critical habitat designations. Traditional Knowledge.--The Service manages lands and natural resources of great importance to Indian Tribes, and the Committee appreciates the acknowledgment of the benefits of traditional ecological knowledge by the Service in past policy statements and guidance in managing these lands and resources. However, the Committee is concerned the Service has not fully incorporated traditional Tribal knowledge in its planning processes and its implementation of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], and would like to see added importance given to the application of this knowledge. When appropriate, the Committee expects the Service to make every effort to incorporate traditional knowledge in its planning decisions, including in ESA decisions. The Committee also expects the Service to engage in additional outreach to Tribal governments in circumstances where traditional knowledge may provide valuable information for species like the northern sea otter. Planning and Consultation.--The bill provides $122,358,000 for planning and consultation. Included is $4,000,000 for Gulf Coast Restoration activities to ensure that the Service has the resources necessary to avoid delays in projects related to the Deepwater Horizon incident and move forward with project reviews in a timely manner. The bill also provides $10,854,000 to support environmental review and permitting of energy projects on public lands, $500,000 above both the enacted level and the request, $2,772,000 for Environmental Response and Restoration, as requested, $3,500,000 for National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] permitting, and $2,859,000 for Bay Delta Ecosystem Restoration. As the Service works to develop or revise species range maps, the Committee advises, when possible, for the Service to create maps at the sub-county level. Endangered Species Act Consultations.--The Committee understands concerns exist regarding ongoing backlogs of Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation requests, such as in West Virginia, North Dakota, and elsewhere. While the Committee recognizes the Service is working to clear the backlog, additional work is needed to do so. Therefore, the Service is directed to report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on a review of the consultation process and ways to improve the process. Additionally, the Committee notes that a provision to provide transfer authority of unobligated Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) funding to the Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to expedite these reviews, has been included in the proposed Senate Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2024 (S. 2309) as requested. Native Watershed Forests.--Watershed forests provide the important ecological service of recharging aquifers and other underground water resources in addition to having carbon sequestration benefits, an important component to addressing climate change. Such forests may also provide critical habitat for endangered endemic species uniquely evolved for the ecosystems they create. In such cases, active management becomes a cost effective way to support multiple conservation goals. The Committee urges the Service to support State and local management of native watershed forests. Central Everglades Planning Project [CEPP].--The Committee urges the Service to continue all efforts to consult and coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the biological opinions for the CEPP South Phase and New Water Phase, including the Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir, to enable the initiation of construction of critical elements of the CEPP in fiscal year 2024. Conservation and Restoration.--The bill provides $37,653,000 for Conservation and Restoration. This amount is equal to the enacted level and maintains enacted levels of $500,000 for the Alaska Nannut Comanagement Council; and $250,000 for the Eskimo Walrus Commission. Oil Spill Response.--The Committee urges a report from the Service on the impacts of a potential spill in the Colorado River of waxy crude on the four species of fish listed under the Endangered Species Act in the Colorado River. Candidate Conservation.--The bill provides $14,538,000 for Candidate Conservation efforts to facilitate voluntary conservation efforts for at-risk species under consideration for listing under the ESA, specifically by developing landscape level partnerships with private landowners, States, Tribes, and agencies on Candidate Conservation Agreements to promote a collaborative approach for conservation planning. Collaboration between Federal Agencies and Private Forest Owners.--The Committee recognizes that many at-risk species inhabit private lands and that the Service must consider non- regulatory and voluntary collaborative conservation efforts with private landowners to accomplish its mission. The Service is directed to continue to utilize its grant and other programs to pursue collaborative species conservation to the maximum extent practicable, specifically for the Northern Long-Eared Bat and the Wood Turtle. Overall, these ongoing collaborative efforts with private landowners through programs such as the Wildlife Conservation Initiative will play a vital role in conserving at-risk and listed species, allow for cooperation, and ultimately help achieve important wildlife conservation outcomes. Private landowners interested in habitat conservation are important partners and their efforts should be encouraged by improving access to a fuller range of conservation resources that exist across the Federal Government and other entities. The Committee encourages the Service to support non-profit organizations with expertise and experience in working with private landowners to provide greater access to information and resources in their local area related to the conservation of wildlife habitat on private lands. State Research Forests.--The Committee directs the Service to support cooperative research, monitoring, and recovery efforts for the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species, such as the spotted owl and marbled murrelet, on state research forests and to report to the Committee within 180 days on progress and future plans for such forests including the Elliott State Research Forest. Jaguar Habitat Connectivity Research and Restoration.--The Committee encourages the Service to prioritize research and restoration of jaguar habitat and connectivity in the U.S.-- Mexico borderlands. Prioritization should include, but not be limited to, the following actions within the Borderlands Secondary Area: mapping of potential trans-border linkages and identification and mitigation of impediments in these corridors, assessing the level of protection in current and potential jaguar range, maintaining and increasing important corridors and administration of protected areas, developing methodologies for jaguar habitat restoration, and identifying prioritized lands for habitat restoration. Conservation Banking Report.--The Committee directs the Service to report back within 60 days of enactment of this act on the status of meeting the directive in section 329 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-283), related to issuing regulations for wildlife conservation banking programs. Recovery.--The bill provides $115,324,000 for activities in support of the recovery and delisting of threatened and endangered species which includes $5,250,000 for the State of the Birds to respond to the urgent needs of critically endangered birds that, due to climate change, now face imminent extinction from non-native mosquitoes that carry avian malaria and other pathogens lethal to these birds; $2,550,000 for the Prescott Grant program; and $1,000,000 for the wolf-livestock demonstration program. The agreement provides $10,800,000 for Recovery Challenge matching grants. Recovery Challenge grants are to be used to implement high priority recovery actions as prescribed in recovery plans to recover federally listed species. Actions should include, but are not limited to, genetically-sound breeding, rearing, and reintroduction programs. Project partners must provide contributions at least 50 percent of the project cost, with the remaining funding coming from Recovery Challenge funds. Partner contribution calculations may include in-kind services. Unless an affected State is a partner on the project, no funds may be awarded to a project until the project partners have consulted with such State. Biobanking.--The Committee is aware that the Service, through its regional offices, is exploring the use of biobanking, which is the preservation of genetic material, including tissues, living cell lines and gametes, as a tool to preserve the genetic diversity of species in order to enhance recovery efforts. The Committee encourages the Service to expand upon these efforts including incorporating sample collection for biobanking into the recovery planning process. Western Monarch Butterfly.--The Committee is particularly concerned over the rapid decline in western monarch butterfly populations and urges the Service to continue to act expeditiously to make a determination on ESA protections for the western monarch. Further, the Service is directed to utilize Service-managed lands to the maximum extent practicable to serve as habitat corridors for migrating monarchs, in particular the western monarch. The Committee recognizes the Service provides resources for monarchs and other pollinators across multiple accounts, and this agreement provides no less than $8,000,000 for the western monarch butterfly and other pollinators which includes increases of $500,000 within National Wildlife Refuge System, Inventory and Monitoring and $500,000 within Science Support. The Service is encouraged to work alongside Federal agencies, State, Tribal, and non- governmental organizations on a comprehensive strategy to increase habitat and monitoring of critical pollinator species. The Service is expected to continue to work with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation [NFWF] to expand and leverage monarch recovery efforts. Florida Grasshopper Sparrow.--The Committee directs the Service to continue to support the Florida Grasshopper Sparrow recovery efforts and provides $500,000 in funding, above the enacted level. Furthermore, the Committee is encouraged by the success of the Service's captive breeding program as managed by its conservation partners and notes that augmenting the wild population with captive bred releases as early as this year will mark an important new phase in the species' recovery. The Committee notes that the disease and health studies necessary to understand and combat captive bred sparrow mortality may have important benefits to the recovery of other endangered birds including the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow. Western Yellow Rail.--The Service is encouraged to contribute to regional cooperative efforts in the study, conservation, and management of the western Yellow Rail in the Pacific Northwest. Native Handicrafts.--The Committee reiterates that the Service's 2016 elephant ivory regulation does not apply to Alaska Native handicrafts made from walrus ivory and mammoth ivory. However, the Committee is concerned that the Federal prohibitions on the sale and trade of elephant ivory have negatively impacted the Alaska Native arts economy. The Committee appreciates the Service's efforts on this matter to date. The Committee expects the Service to continue its efforts to promote this distinction and directs the Service to develop a plan for greater outreach on this matter. Subsistence Activities.--The Committee believes marine mammal subsistence harvest management and enforcement decisions should be, to the extent practicable, led by Alaska Native Organizations at the local level, with Federal agencies working in partnership with Alaska Native Organizations. The Committee expects the Service to finalize a co-management agreement with the Alaska Nannut Co-Management Council [ANCC], and in the interim, to work closely with ANCC on enforcement actions that may arise in relation to subsistence uses of polar bears. The Service is directed to provide funding to Alaska Native Organizations with which it co-manages marine mammals at no less than fiscal year 2021 levels. The Service is reminded of the report due to the Committee on the Service's efforts to work collaboratively with other Federal agencies on activities related to marine mammal subsistence harvests. Within 1 year of enactment, the Committee directs the Service to work with the State of Alaska to develop a joint strategy with management recommendations on subsistence hunting and fishing that will help increase food security in rural areas in the State. This joint strategy should include public input from Alaska's rural residents, document and apply local and traditional knowledge, and identify any needed regulatory flexibilities to respond to the timing and changing distributions of fish and wildlife populations. Habitat Conservation.--The bill provides $79,739,000 for Habitat Conservation programs, an increase of $5,515,000 to the enacted level. The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program is funded at $65,282,000. Within the funds provided for Partners, $2,700,000 is for Nutria Eradication activities, $643,000 for Environmental Data Quality and Access, no less than $3,800,000 for Washington Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups, an increase of $2,515,000 above enacted, and $8,132,000 for Klamath Habitat Restoration, an increase of $3,000,000 above enacted. The bill provides $14,457,000 for the Coastal Program, which includes Ecosystem Restoration, Hood Canal Salmon Enhancement, and Long Live the Kings which is $500,000 above the enacted level. Klamath Restoration.--The Service is directed to consider additional activities that could be undertaken to recover endangered and threatened species, restore habitat, and improve the health of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges with the funds provided in fiscal year 2024 and during the fiscal year 2025 budget formulation. The Service is also encouraged to continue to coordinate with the Bureau of Reclamation where appropriate and consult with Tribes. National Wildlife Refuge System.--The Committee recommends $539,220,000 for the National Wildlife Refuge System. This amount is $500,000 above fiscal year 2023 enacted funding in program increases. Within the amount provided for the National Wildlife Refuge System, $258,194,000 is provided for wildlife and habitat management. Funding of $2,835,000 for the subsistence program is transferred to the Office of the Secretary and $16,925,000 is continued for invasive species with an emphasis on invasive species Strike Teams to focus on high priority invasive species problems before they cause irreparable harm to the environment. The bill maintains $500,000 to help improve water efficiency at the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge in order to maintain, improve, and replace and upgrade refuge infrastructure per the direction included in the accompanying statement in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260). The bill also provides $2,500,000 for the Marine National Monuments, and $2,500,000 for nutria eradication. Refuge Visitor Services are provided $80,359,000, $500,000 below the enacted level, as requested. The Urban Wildlife Conservation Program is provided $7,000,000, equal to the enacted level, as requested. Refuge maintenance is funded at $150,711,000, an increase of $500,000 to the enacted level. Staffing of the National Wildlife Refuge System.--Over the past decade, the Refuge System's full-time equivalent [FTE] staffing has decreased while the Refuge System has continued to grow. Within funds provided, the Service encourages to prioritize hiring and retention of FTEs particularly to fill longstanding vacancies in the refuge system such as at the Northern Maine Wildlife Refuge Complex and Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Subsistence Management.--The Committee supports a transfer of the Office of Subsistence Management from the Service to the Office of the Secretary. Arctic Youth Ambassadors Program.--The Committee directs the Service to provide no less than $500,000 for the Arctic Youth Ambassadors program within Refuge Visitor Services. Refuge Management Plans.--The bill provides $3,684,000 for Refuge Planning, equal to the enacted level. The Committee is concerned that a number of refuge management plans have not been updated for many years, and directs the Service to prioritize updating management plans to improve the management of the oldest Refuges in a manner consistent with the strategic vision of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Trapping in National Wildlife Refuges.--The Committee understands that the Service makes efforts to provide information to the public regarding acceptable trapping practices on refuge lands. The Service is directed to improve efforts to inform the public about acceptable trapping practices and collect data on trapping activities in refuges, and to share those efforts and outcomes with the Committee. European Green Crab.--The Committee recognizes invasive European green crab is becoming an increasing problem and provides $300,000 for European green crab eradication efforts at affected National Wildlife Refuges. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.--The Committee encourages the Service to contribute funding aligned with commitments established in the 2018 license agreement with the South Florida Water Management District towards the management of invasive plant infestations, including Old World Climbing Fern, which threaten the value of this resource, ongoing Everglades restoration efforts, the provision of critical wildlife habitat, and the enjoyment of the public. Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex.-- The Committee supports the Service's collaboration with non- Federal partners to develop and implement the Blackwater 2100 ``A Strategy for Salt Marsh Persistence in an Era of Climate Change.'' The plan seeks to restore and protect 800-1,000 acres of marsh, which is one-fifth of tidal marsh losses since the 1930's, using thin layer placement, living shorelines, invasive species control, research, and other management strategies to enhance climate change resiliency and protect communities. John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge.--The Committee supports the salt marsh restoration work in the John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge to enhance salt marsh resiliency with native plantings and through improved drainage and tidal flushing. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Service to prioritize these ongoing efforts. Polar Bear Tourism.--The Committee is aware of significant concerns among residents in Kaktovik, Alaska, related to the Service's program for polar bear viewing. While tourism has increased significantly in recent years, the Committee has received reports of bears becoming less fearful of humans as a result of tourism, leading to more human encounters with bears within the village. In addition, tourism has reportedly made it more difficult for local residents to travel to and from Kaktovik, given the limited availability of air service. The Committee instructs the Service to review its program for polar bear tourism, consult and incorporate the views of Kaktovik residents in its decisions related to the program, and explore cooperative management of the Beaufort polar bear population with Native peoples in the village. Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.--The Committee directs the Service to continue to follow the directive from previous fiscal years that prohibits a caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and efforts to remove cattle on Chirikof and Wosnesenski Islands in the State of Alaska. Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.--The Committee is aware that the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has identified 2,500 acres of forested habitat impacted by spruce bark beetles, currently ready for treatment, several acres of which are adjacent to existing roads, facilities, campgrounds, trails and other high use recreation sites. In an effort to protect the refuge and surrounding communities, the Committee encourages the Service to treat the 2,500 high priority acres ready for treatment within the funds provided. These treatments would meet multiple objectives by removing beetle-killed trees and reducing risk to the public, employees and infrastructure, while reducing accumulations of hazardous fuels. Good Neighbor Agreements.--The Committee notes that forest ecosystems in the National Wildlife Refuge System are susceptible to elevated wildfire risk, drought, and insect and disease infestation much like forestland under the administrative jurisdiction of other Federal land management agencies. The Committee recognizes that the environmental stewardship of national wildlife refuges and adjacent non- Federal lands would benefit if the Service offered cross- boundary fuels reduction projects to neighboring State, local, and Tribal governments similar to those issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the USDA Forest Service under Good Neighbor Agreements [GNA]. Thus, the bill provides the authority for this work in Section 443. Conservation & Enforcement.--The bill provides $174,038,000 for Conservation and Enforcement, an increase of $1,000,000 more than the enacted level. The recommendation maintains $3,500,000 for the Service's work with the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to combat trafficking of counterfeit arts and crafts, and to conduct criminal investigations of alleged violations of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (Public Law 101-644). ePermits Operations.--The Committee supports the creation of a new subactivity by transferring funding that was previously appropriated to the International Affairs program to ePermits Operations to better clarify the cross-programmatic nature of the system, as requested. Non-Commercial Wildlife Permits for Zoos and Aquariums.-- The Committee is increasingly concerned about the significant and increasing delays in the Service's review and processing of permit applications for the non-commercial research, rescue, and transportation of species under its jurisdiction, which can undermine both the welfare and conservation of these species. The Committee directs the Service to develop a plan to reduce the processing time and backlog of these permit applications. The plan shall be submitted to the Committee within 120 days. Big Cats Public Safety Act Enforcement.--The Committee is aware of the Service's additional responsibilities pursuant to the enactment of Public Law 117-243. The Committee would like to ensure that the Service has adequate resources to implement and enforce this act. The Committee encourages the Service to collaborate with United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice and directs the Service report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on staffing, implementation, and enforcement status and additional funding needs related to Public Law 117-243. Wildlife Trafficking.--The Service plays a critical role in the ongoing effort to combat the global crisis of wildlife poaching and trafficking, which escalates the risk of animal- to-human disease transmission and is driven by demand for high- value illegal wildlife products, facilitated by sophisticated criminal networks profiting from this multi-billion dollar black market industry. Poaching of rhinoceros, pangolin, loris, and elephants has reached unprecedented levels, and illegal trade is undermining the conservation of scores of other species. The Committee continues to support government-wide efforts to combat wildlife trafficking. The bill maintains resources that will support the Service in continuing to strengthen its forensic capabilities to disrupt smuggling networks; improve collaboration with other Federal, State, local, and foreign governments; and promote international wildlife conservation. The Committee remains concerned about the global health risk from wildlife to human disease transmission, particularly in light of recent national health emergencies. International Affairs.--The bill includes $20,579,000 for International Affairs, including accounting for the above mentioned ePermits transfer. Long-term success for conserving wildlife and wild places relies on building the capacity in countries for managing their own protected areas and species, including among Indigenous Peoples and communities. Within the amount provided, the Committee encourages the Service to support projects that foster partnerships with universities or other institutions that are educating the current and next generations of conservationists. Migratory Bird Management.--The bill provides $53,860,000 which includes $30,935,000 for Conservation and Monitoring, $16,821,000 for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan activities, and $591,000 for the Federal Duck Stamp Program. Incidental Take for Migratory Birds.--The Committee is concerned with the decline of North American bird species, including the 1,093 species of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act [MBTA] that are experiencing population decreases due to a variety of threats. The Committee supports the Service's work to establish an incidental take authorization program within the permitting program for the MBTA. Fish and Aquatic Conservation.--The bill provides $247,171,000 for Fish and Aquatic Conservation, $5,600,000 more than the enacted level. The Committee encourages the Service to include adequate support for mitigation activities at National Fish Hatcheries in future budget submissions. Additionally, funds are maintained for the improvements to aquatic habitat through the removal of locks and dams. The bill maintains $3,750,000 for Klamath Restoration and $9,750,000 for Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement activities, $500,000 above the enacted level. Further, $5,200,000 is continued for implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, $500,000 above the enacted level. The Service is directed to work in cooperation with State fish and game agencies. This includes funding for anadromous salmonids for implementation of the Yukon River Salmon Agreement. National Fish Hatchery System Operations.--The bill provides $76,456,000 for National Fish Hatchery System Operations. This is $100,000 above the enacted level, and accounts for a $6,000,000 transfer per the request. The Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership is funded at $800,000, equal to the request. Funding in the amount of $8,000,000, equal to the enacted level, is provided for the Warm Springs Fish Health Center [FHC] which provides disease diagnosis, biosecurity and disease management, disease treatment and prevention, fish health inspection services for Federal, State, and Tribal hatcheries responsible for production of salmonids and warm water species for recovery, restoration, and recreational fisheries, and inspections and certifications for the National Triploid Grass Carp Program. Additional funding is provided to develop environmental DNA tools to forecast and detect aquatic invasive species, aquatic nuisance species, aquatic pathogens, and rare species for Federal, State, and Tribal hatcheries. Lower Snake Ecosystem Restoration Infrastructure Improvements.--The salmon and steelhead hatcheries, adult fish traps, and juvenile release facilities along the lower Snake River and in the Columbia River Basin are facing immediate and significant infrastructure improvement needs due to aging critical infrastructure including pipelines, generators, and rearing units. This is not the responsibility of the Service alone, the Committee believes the water development agencies should be contributing more to protect threatened and endangered species. Multiple partners are necessary to fully address mitigation activities in the basin, therefore the Committee directs the Service to continue dialogue with the multiple partners involved to come to a viable solution in fiscal year 2024. In the meantime, the Committee directs the Service to assist States and Tribes with accelerating critical capital and maintenance projects to improve salmon and steelhead facilities on the lower Snake River and Columbia River basin, and the bill provides $6,000,000 for these efforts. Maintenance and Equipment.--The bill provides $26,314,000 for maintenance and equipment expenses related to the National Fish Hatchery System. This amount is equal to the enacted level. A portion of the funding provided for National Fish Hatchery Maintenance and Equipment should be allocated to hatcheries where partner agencies fund mitigation work. Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation.--The bill provides $144,401,000 for aquatic habitat and species conservation. This amount is $500,000 more than the enacted level, accounting for an internal transfer. Within aquatic habitat and species conservation, funding is provided as follows: --Habitat Assessment and Restoration.--The Committee recommends $54,826,000 for habitat assessment and restoration activities. Funding is provided in the amount of $11,500,000 for activities associated with the Delaware River Basin Conservation Act (Public Law 114-322). The Service is encouraged to support the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program's existing, successful practice of allowing cash or in-kind contributions of services or materials to be used for the non-Department of the Interior share of the cost of a project funded under the grant program. The bill also provides $18,598,000 for fish passage improvements, equal to the enacted level and the request. Within the provided funding, the Service is expected to comply with the instructions and requirements in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 117-328, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, regarding implementation of the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act [FRIMA] (Public Law 106-502). --Population Assessment and Cooperative Management.-- The Committee recommends $38,932,000 for population assessment and cooperative management activities, an increase of $-2,000,000 to the enacted level and an increase of $5,811,000 to the budget request, and accounts for the proposed internal transfer. Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Grants are provided $3,000,000, which is $2,110,000 more than the request. The program supports critical work to restore Great Lakes fisheries and inform management decisions through sound science. This includes the Great Lakes Mass Marking Program, which is essential to assessing hatchery production and supporting a robust fishery. Within funds provided, the Service is encouraged to support these important efforts. The recommendation maintains enacted funding for the Lake Champlain sea lamprey program at $818,000. The Committee is concerned by the decline of American shad in coastal rivers and encourages the Service to collaborate with academic research institutions to research, monitor, conserve, and restore other anadromous fish, in close collaboration with state, Tribal, and local governments. Further the Committee agrees with the proposed reduction for eradication activities, per the budget request. --Aquatic Invasive Species.--The Committee recommends $50,643,000 for aquatic invasive species activities, $500,000 above the enacted level. Within these funds, $5,038,000 has been maintained to implement section 5(d)(2) of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106-506). Funding for research on hydrilla, eel, and milfoil invasive grasses is maintained at $1,500,000. Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission.--The bill maintains $700,000 for the Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Compact, as authorized in Public Law 98-138, for research, monitoring, conservation, and habitat restoration work related to this high-priority watershed. The Committee directs that the Secretary undertake a special resource study of the National significance of, and the suitability and feasibility of carrying out a basin-scale, nonregulatory program of conservation, stewardship, and enhancement of habitat for fish and wildlife in Connecticut River basin. Non-Intrusive Zebra Mussel Elimination.--The Committee recommends $3,500,000 for zebra mussel eradication, equal to the enacted level and budget request. The Committee is aware of the environmental and economic threat posed by invasive quagga and zebra mussels. Invasive Carp.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the work conducted by the Service to combat the serious threat of invasive carp and recommends $31,500,000 for invasive carp activities, $500,000 above the enacted level across invasive carp and Contract Fishing subaccounts. Overall, this funding is aimed at protecting and enhancing activities in the Great Lakes to prevent invasive carp from entering and establishing in the Great Lakes. Funding provided should also be used to control invasive carp in the Mississippi River and its Sub-basins, including the Upper Mississippi River Sub-basin; Missouri River Sub-basin; Arkansas-Red-White River Sub-basin; Lower Mississippi River Sub-basin; Tennessee Cumberland Sub-basin; and Ohio River Sub-basin, including in Kentucky Lake, Lake Barkley, and the Ohio River. The Service should consider the utility of creating a dedicated funding source to increase the intensity and geographic scope of efforts to prevent entry into the Great Lakes and control in areas where invasive carp are currently located. The Service is directed to continue to work with those States with existing cooperative agreements, including non-profits, to develop and implement innovative solutions to reduce invasive carp populations. The Committee encourages the Service to focus on invasive species removal as it relates to the eradication efforts for invasive Carp. While the Committee recognizes the importance of studying and understanding invasive carp patterns, the Service is encouraged to take action on a strategy that increases the focus on biomass removal. Additionally, $4,400,000 is provided for implementation of State Aquatic Nuisance Species management plans to help control the spread of invasive carp. Invasive Species Competitive Grants.--The Committee is aware that work is ongoing in several regions to address the threats posed by aquatic invasive species and directs the Service to continue to make available competitive grant funding for projects to eliminate these destructive, non-native species. Prioritization of Combatting Invasive Plant and Animal Species.--Invasive plant and animal species are a pervasive problem affecting communities across the Nation. Invasives, such as the carp, European Green Crab, nutria, quagga and zebra mussels, emerald ash borer, Eurasian milfoil, elodea, and the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid threaten our natural resources and wreak havoc on the communities and industries that rely upon them. Preventing invasive species from gaining a foothold in our communities and suppressing established species is of utmost importance. The Committee makes several increases to programs designed to combat invasive species before and after they become a problem. The Committee encourages the Service to support research, monitoring, mitigation, and outreach efforts in all regions. Science Applications.--The bill provides $36,372,000 for Science Applications, $1,000,000 more than the enacted level, and $19,080,000 less than the request.
