For the political make-up of local authorities, see Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocal government in England broadly consists of three layers: civil parishes, local authorities, and regional authorities. Every part of England is governed by at least one local authority, but parish councils and regional authorities do not exist everywhere. In addition, there are 31 police and crime commissioners, four police, fire and crime commissioners, and ten national park authorities with local government responsibilities.[1][2] Local government is not standardised across the country, with the last comprehensive reform taking place in 1974.\n\n\"Joint-board\" redirects here. For the U.S. military's Joint Army and Navy Board, also known as the \"Joint Board\", see Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nCivil parishes are the lowest tier of local government, and primarily exist in rural and smaller urban areas. The responsibilities of parish councils are limited and generally consist of providing and maintaining public spaces and facilities.\n\nLocal authorities cover the entirety of England, and are responsible for services such as education, transport, planning applications, and waste collection and disposal. In two-tier areas a non-metropolitan county council and two or more non-metropolitan district councils share responsibility for these services. In single-tier areas a unitary authority, London borough, or metropolitan borough provides all services. The City of London and Isles of Scilly have unique local authorities."
