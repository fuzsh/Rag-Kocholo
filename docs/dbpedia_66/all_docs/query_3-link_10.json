He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul. He leads me in right paths for his name's sake.\"\n\nGood friends, let us pray: Truly, O gracious Lord, how very grateful we continue to be for the rich gift of Your nurture and love. Indeed, Your choosing through the ages to shepherd all who call themselves Your people is such a humbling reality. And having just experienced yet another President's Day, we are truly thankful for all of those leaders who nobly led and guided our Nation, sometimes through incredibly perilous times. Now we fervently ask, O God, that You will grant to each of these leaders serving here in the Senate of South Carolina the determination to trust in You as they in turn pledge to do what is truly best for all of the people of our State. Together may all of these modern-day shepherds carry out their roles nobly and wisely. In Your loving name we pray, O Lord.

I have been quite interested in the activities of the day in here, but before all that happened, I was quite interested in the activities in the calendar we get every day. I was looking through it and somebody said, \"Oh, we don't have that much that's objected to\" but yes, we do. We have fifty Bills total on the calendar. We have sixteen Republican Bills that are objected to by Republicans. We have fourteen Bills that are objected to by Democrats. We have four whatever those things were that we got a while ago that everybody got so upset about. So, that leaves us sixteen Bills that we could work on, but every time we get to one, somebody carries it over. So, we wonder why we can't get anything done in here and everything we need to get done has to go on special order.\n\nNow, I don't know what our problem is. I think we should look at everybody's Bills. If you've got a problem with it, you go talk to them. I don't have anything contested to, but maybe I should start using my five and start contesting to everybody's Bill whether I find anything wrong with it or not -- I wanted to get up here and say that, because as Republicans and Democrats, we ought to start working together. I can walk across here and talk to you all or you can walk over here and talk to us and then tell us what's wrong with our Bill before you just start slapping your name on it. Some of those names have been on the Bills for over a year. If you don't like it, tell us what you don't like about it. Don't just be obstinate and not do anything. There are a lot of Bills that come through here that I didn't like, but I stomached them. So just because you don't like it doesn't mean there's not forty other people in here that might.\n\nNow today, I have suddenly found out, and that's just been since I walked in this room today, that there are a lot more people in this room that care about children's issues. Where did y'all suddenly come from? I mean, I've been working on children's issues for the last twelve years, and I have fought tooth and nail by myself to get them done. Suddenly, everybody wants to stick their thumb in the pot and tell me what I'm doing wrong. Well, maybe y'all should look at the Bill and come tell me what's wrong with it before y'all start trying to correct them out here on the floor and getting mad and trying to make everybody look bad.\n\nSo, if you've got a problem with it, come tell me, but don't start trying to get up here like you're all excited about children. We know what time of year it is, so if you were excited about children before, that's alright, but don't suddenly get excited about them now.
