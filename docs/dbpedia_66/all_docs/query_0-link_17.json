        "text": "Data sources\n\nMuch of our data is crowdsourced by an army of volunteers filling in Google spreadsheets. This is then combined with some standard data to enable it to be matched up across sources.\n\nLinks to council climate action plans were crowdsourced in this spreadsheet. If you find a plan document that we’ve missed, read our guide on what we consider a climate action plan and how to add one to our spreadsheet.\n\nCouncil climate emergency declarations and net zero commitments were largely collated by Climate Emergency UK staff.\n\nLocal authority CO2 emissions estimates are collated by the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.\n\nWe make use of data from our Council Climate Plan Scorecards project, which was collected with the support of Mapolitical, who donated their UK Government Political Stakeholder data and Look-up API to help us communicate with local authority officers. Read more on the Council Climate Plan Scorecards site.\n\nDownload all plans\n\nDownload ZIP archive of all documents\n\nThis includes all the documents we’ve found including Climate Action Plans, Climate strategies, pre plans etc. As well as the PDFs, or HTML pages, of the plans, this includes a CSV file (plans.csv) with details and sources for all the included files, along with information like GSS codes to enable linking to other data. The CSV file is available separately, see below for details.\n\nAPI\n\nAccess our JSON API\n\nWe are working to expose an increasing quantity of our data through our JSON API. The API pages themselves include a full description of the data available.\n\nCSV/Excel files\n\nAll our public climate and local authority data is avaliable through our data portal.\n\nThe following files are avaliable as CSV and Excel files.\n\nIf you'd like help working with our data to include it in your service, please get in touch and we will help you do that.\n\nDownload council plan metadata\n\nDownload council net zero commitments\n\nDownload climate emergency declarations\n\nDownload emissions reduction projects\n\nDownload citizens' assembly dataset\n\nAll the above CSV files include the council GSS code, and a three letter council code you can use with the API, to enable matching data across files, and with other sources. The links contain full descriptions of all columns.\n\nThe CSV of emissions reduction projects is limited to Scottish local authorities (see reasoning below)\n\nFull explanations of the data can be found in the guidance on the Sustainable Scotland Network site.\n\nLicensing\n\nThe API data and CSV files are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The ZIP file is unlicensed as it contains work issued by local authorities under many licenses.\n\nSimilar councils\n\nWe have built on open datasets to provide comparisons between councils that are similar in a number of dimensions. You can read a detailed breakdown of how we calculated these dimensions on our blog, but here’s a high-level summary:\n\nDownload our nearest neighbour datasets.\n\nEmissions reduction projects\n\nWe are able to display emissions reduction projects reported by Scottish local authorities, thanks to the ‘Climate Change (Duties of Public Bodies; Reporting Requirements) (Scotland) Order 2015’ which requires them to submit reports on their climate actions to the Sustainable Scotland Network website each year.\n\nWe automatically collect these reports, extract information about the local authorities’ emissions reduction projects, and display them in a more accessible, interactive format, here.\n\nSadly local authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland have no corresponding reporting requirement, so data is unavailable for them.\n\nFeedback"
