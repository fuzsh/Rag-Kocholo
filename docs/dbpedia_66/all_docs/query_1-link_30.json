        "text": "CiLCA Sarah Harris\n\nCongratulations to Sarah Harris , Clerk at Bishop Auckland Town Council , who recently attained her Certificate in Local Council Administration (CiLCA) Qualification.\n\nThis is a significant achievement for any Town Clerk which will benefit both Sarah and the Town Council to realise their ambitions and vision for the future. Well done Sarah!\n\nSarah was formally presented with her certificate by Councillor David Bell, Chair of CDALC Executive Board and the CDALC Executive Officer , Audrey Christie on 16th January 2024 at the Town Council Meeting at Bishop Auckland Town Hall.\n\nForthcoming training events are listed on our training page.\n\nFor more information about any training events please email us at cdalc@durham.gov.uk\n\nSection 137 Limit for 2024/2025\n\nThe Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has released details of the appropriate sum for Section 137(4)(a) of the Local Government Act 1972 (the 1972 Act). For parish and town councils in England the 2024-25 Section 137 Limit is £10.81 per elector (£9.93 per elector in 2023-24).\n\nIf you are interested in getting involved with your local parish council please check with your local council clerk to see if there are any councillor vacancies.\n\nOrdinary elections take place every 4 years and the next are scheduled for May 2025. Any unfilled seats left over from the May 2021 elections can be filled by co-option and over time casual vacancies will also arise due to resignations, deaths etc. Depending on the circumstances casual vacancies may lead to an election but in many cases this is not necessary and the council can co-opt new members.\n\nIf you want to find out more about how you can become a councillor or clerk, or just want to find out more about parish councils in general then please see our Parish Councils and Get Involved pages to find all the information you need.\n\nPublic Participation at Meetings\n\nThe Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 gives members of the press and public the power to attend parish council meetings but it does not give them express rights to speak at meetings. Parish and Town councils do of course like to hear from their residents and welcome members of the public to attend and speak at their meetings.\n\nGood practice dictates that public participation should form part of every parish councils agenda. The length of time the public can speak is determined by each council.\n\nIf you wish to speak at your local parish council meeting please look out for the council agenda which should be posted in a conspicuous place within your parish or take a look at your councils website if they have one. If this is not available please contact your local council clerk. You can use the Locate a Parish link at the top of this page to find out details of your parish or town council."
