        "text": "Welcome to Darlington. A historical borough built on steam power and the determination to change the world. A population with coal, fire and steel in our blood. A creative and cultural community with an award-winning theatre, arts venues, and an unrivalled independent food scene. A retail hotspot where high street brands meet local sellers. A destination easily reached by road, rail and air. A location where a town meets the River Skerne and a countryside dotted with castles, scenic walks and villages. We’re so glad to have you here.\n\nBased on the cusp of the Tees Valley and nestled in the picturesque surroundings of County Durham, Darlington is the perfect base for a day, weekend or week’s stay. With a huge variety of events taking place throughout the year, tourist attractions and hidden gems to discover, there’s always something to do or see.\n\nFor a trip filled with culture and history, catch one of the touring or local shows at the Hippodrome or Majestic Theatre, or hear live music at the Forum Music Centre. Learn about our proud railway heritage at Hopetown, explore the Tees Cottage Pumping Station or see the Piercebridge Roman Bridge.\n\nTake a step into nature in one of our many parks, including Green Flag-awarded South Park and West Park, or meander the banks of the River Skerne with a walk at Broken Scar. And for the more metropolitan among us, the town centre is teeming with independent businesses just waiting for you to walk through the door. From the Shambles-style yards and wynds off High Row, to trendy Grange Road and Duke Street, to Bondgate and beyond, there’s a whole world of shopping and dining to enjoy.\n\nNo matter if you’re looking for an active trip or some time to relax, Enjoy Darlington is here to help. Whatever your interests, let us inspire you to make more of your visit."
