        "text": "Darlington Borough Council will hold a planning committee meeting on Wednesday to discuss and rubber-stamp planning applications.\n\nHere are all the applications that the council are set to discuss on Wednesday at 1.30pm where a decision will be made:\n\nBrunswick Street\n\nFirst on the agenda is a 5-storey office building on Brunswick Street, slated to house the new HM Treasury office and other departments.\n\nProvisions have been made for 14 car spaces and 98 cycle racks within the 9,639 sqm property.\n\nThere have been noted objections regarding aesthetics and the anticipated impact on local traffic, however, the council has received no objections from select consultative bodies.\n\nConiscliffe Road\n\nItem two is public realm improvements on Coniscliffe Road, with planned enhancements for pedestrian and cycling environments.\n\nProposals include a pocket park and wider pavements.\n\nFeedback from locals led to amendments such as the relocation of the pocket park and designated loading bays' addition.\n\nRoseberry View\n\nThird on the list is an appeal against refusal for planning permission for a detached garage and gym at Roseberry View, Sadberge.\n\nAlthough formerly dismissed due to concerns over visual impact, an inspector has now allowed the appeal, finding the proposed structure well-sized, proportionate, and well-designed.\n\nGreat Stainton\n\nHazelfield Cottage in Great Stainton is up for discussion for its proposed addition of three-holiday chalets and a kitchen area.\n\nThe plan was previously refused due to highway safety concerns about creating additional access points with inadequate visibility standards.\n\nThe inspector agreed with the council's analysis and the appeal was dismissed with cost application also refused.\n\nThe same property, Hazelfield Cottage, sees a second review of its appeal.\n\nThe development was again dismissed due to the unacceptable impact on highway safety, particularly concerning access visibility conflicts with regular traffic.\n\nLighting and CCTV measures proposed as safety mitigations were deemed insufficient.\n\nMost read\n\nTeen arrested after 'violent disorder' erupts in Darlington\n\n\"The locals are angry\": Consett parking petition signed by over 1,000\n\nWhy this County Durham high street is among UK's top 25\n\nUnlock unlimited local news for just £6 for 6 months today.
