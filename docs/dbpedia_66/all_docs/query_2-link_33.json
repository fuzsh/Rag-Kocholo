        "text": "Darlington is a beautiful, historic borough right in the heart of the North East.\n\nAs a shopping destination, Darlington is second to none. We have a thriving independent business scene, as recognised when the town centre was awarded with the title of one of top independent high streets in the UK in 2023. From luxury fashion to handmade homewares, and artisan bakeries to jewellery makers, we have it all! There's also a fantastic array of high street names and a department store to browse too.\n\nWhen the lights go down, catch a show at the wonderful Darlington Hippodrome or watch a gig at The Forum. See the latest film at Vue or the Odeon cinema and there’s also plenty of amazing restaurants, bars and clubs in the town centre. Try one of our award-winning cocktail or real ale bars in which you’ll find that great north eastern welcome.\n\nThere’s also plenty of accommodation to choose from which suit a range of tastes and budgets. From 5-star golf resorts and spas to cosy bed and breakfasts.\n\nThe area is justifiably proud of its world famous rail heritage, so no trip would be complete without a visit to the newly redeveloped railway museum, Hopetown. With support from National Lottery funding, the museum boasts new purpose-built and heritage buildings, new exhibitions, virtual 4D reality experiences and a playground.\n\nHere on Enjoy Darlington, you'll find plenty of inspiration to help you explore the borough, as well as info on all of the businesses you can find. We always have lots going on too, so if you'd like to attend one of our events, make sure you check out the what's on calendar or 2024 events guide.\n\nWe can't wait to see you!"
