        "text": "Project commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: A Collaborative Process: Working with Essex Police, Basildon aim to create a seamless digital customer journey. The objective is to create environment of shared learning that will generate efficiencies in both process, resources and a much improved customer experience\n\nPartners: Essex Police, other local authorities across Essex.\n\nMission: Fostering innovation through open-minded collaboration as members of the Essex Online Partnership, Basildon Borough Council and Essex Police have identified a number of opportunities to work together to improve our citizens' digital services experience, namely - creating seamless online services to best meet the needs of our citizens; driving quality services and sharing best practice whilst demonstrating our commitment to ensuring the improvement of cyber security. To date, this has resulted in Essex Police providing our staff with identified training, further resulting in improved employee engagement. This project therefore helps realise the ambition of the declaration and demonstrates our commitment to digital enablement.\n\nImpact: Identified opportunities leading to a targeted outcome, include:\n\n- Creating seamless customer experiences in regards to services provided to citizens by Basildon Borough Council in partnership with Essex Police, such as Anti-Social Behavior (ASB) and the process of licensing a public event.\n\n- Working in partnership to align the definition of what is classified as a vulnerable person and defining the processes to be adopted to ensure citizens consistently receive the required level of support to maintain their wellbeing. This will entail effective use of 3rd sector services to enhance the level of support provided to vulnerable citizens.\n\n- Reviewing digital content with a focus on accessibility in relation to essential information being updated, to include relevant contact details, ensuring plain English and consistency in terms of language used to detail available services and applying prompt fixes to identified or reported broken links. This aims to improve our citizens' online service provision when accessing our services delivered in partnership.\n\n- Creating learning opportunities by sharing knowledge of best practice including the outcomes of research of digital solutions to identify further opportunities to work in collaboration. Learning opportunities are also recognised as developing staff skillsets by providing free digital skills training in collaboration, utilising in-house expertise.\n\nIdentified training opportunities to date include cyber security, which provides understanding of the risk online activities pose; how to manage threats and valuable protection advice on how to protect yourself against cyber-crime.\n\nIt is the aim of the project is to share the overall outcomes with the Essex Online Partnership group to encourage collective collaboration with all other local authorities across Essex, and Essex police.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: App Solution\n\nPartners: Essex University\n\nMission: We are working in partnership with Essex University to develop an App to enable our citizens to access specific services, while providing features to personalise their experience according to their requirements.\n\nBasildon approached the University with a proposal complimenting the curriculum of final year students working towards qualifications in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.\n\nThis App will provide a completely personalised customer experience - an aim of our digital strategy, while also looking to inform, engage and educate our citizens using gamification.\n\nImpact: Basildon Council has ambition to offer a more personalised service for citizens accessing online services which negates a requirement to formally log in.\n\nAn app was recognised as the preferred solution. With a drive on value for money, research suggested creating an app to access all our services would not be the preferred solution. We identified a poor return on investment, with limited downloads for Council app’s based on authorities whom adopted this strategy.\n\nSo we decided our app will only provide features relating to one service.\n\nDemand and user preference analysis was collated utilising demographic and web analytic data to ensure the app’s features are designed around citizen’s digital interests, their behaviours and demands. By using this data it will ensure a product which best meets the needs of our citizens.\n\nThe app will provide specific customised services for each individual customer which aims to result in the formation of new digital habits. It will be used to test the appetite for further Council apps which will include products that aim to create greater levels of engagement and increased awareness of the Council's services (our policies). Implementation will result in a reduction in service failure and demand across more expensive contact channels while also improving levels of satisfaction through personalising the citizen’s individual experience.\n\nThrough working in collaboration with Essex University the project represents value for money and provides the Council an opportunity to promote the organisation to students seeking a career in IT following completion of their course. This approach seeks to promote the council as an employer of choice, for the recruitment of IT skilled staff, in what is a competitive market place. The Council would provide students at university or leaving university with the required experience to become more valued in the market place.\n\nThe project represents a digital experiment that will be used to establish the levels of demand for Council apps for individual specific services. If successful it will shape enterprise-wide initiatives, driving efficiency and delivering greater value for money.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Robotics Process Automation\n\nPartners: Robotics Process Automation software provider and implementation partner (not yet decided)\n\nMission: RPA provides organisations with an agile digital workforce and interacts with systems in the same way that existing users currently do. With the growing financial pressures faced by local authorities, a digital workforce will improve efficiency, productivity and quality, removing mundane, repetitive tasks and freeing up resources to focus on quality outcomes for customers.\n\nOur aim is to implement Robotics Process Automation and develop of a Centre of Excellence at Brent.\n\nImpact: Increase in staff capacity to enable them to deal with meaningful and complex interactions with customers; better use of talent and skills within our workforce. Automated transactions will be completed on time, eliminating risk of errors, improving quality resulting in Increased customer satisfaction.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Thriving Places – Building an evidence base using Mobile Network Data\n\nPartners: We are already running a pilot with Vodafone and CitiLogik. We have been sharing our learning with one of our Digital Shared Service partners, LB Southwark and are looking to work more closely with them in this area.\n\nMission: Local Authorities need the best possible understanding of how people use the places and services for which they are responsible. Mobile Network Data (MND), coupled with excellent analysis, can contribute to providing answers to some of the key questions we need to understand in order to work with communities to design solutions. We aim to:\n\n- gain an understanding of when MND can be drawn on to inform decision making and share this across different services\n\n- work with a provider to develop a model and methodology to form the basis of data gathering in Brent, and working in partnership, elsewhere\n\n- develop analytical capability around the use of MND so raw data gathered can be presented in a meaningful way to decision makers, including residents and others we work with to co-design solutions\n\nImpact: First and foremost, we hope MND will create a robust evidence base to help design solutions across services which deliver better outcomes from Brent’s residents and businesses. We are currently piloting use of MND in five priority town centre areas. The data gathered is helping us understand who uses the town centres and how they are used. This will help the team develop more targeted interventions to support the regeneration of those areas.\n\nIn running the pilot study, we are also looking at how the data can be analysed and presented. We think there are exciting opportunities to provide better information, in a clear and interactive way to those delivering services, but also to residents and partners involved in consultations and co-design.\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: UNDER REVIEW: A 'Digital Tool' for all Planning Functions\n\nPartners: Lead Authority: Southwark Council, Partners involved: Brent Council, Tower Hamlets Council, Lewisham Council, Ealing Council, Westminster City Council, Gateshead Council, Lambeth Council, Waltham Forest Council\n\nMission: The problem is that the planning service is provided by a number of out of date systems and processes that are not linked together. This provides a confusing, chaotic, opaque system that does not work for service providers and users. There is no tool for this and there is no roadmap or business case for procuring a online tool.\n\nThis discovery would look at how to provide a quick, easy to use online tool for the planning service that allows the end user to use and access a simple easy to navigate system that is responsive to different platforms with clear communication using mobile phones, tablets and desk top computers in order to speed up decisions on planning applications and to stimulate more development and house building.\n\nThis online tool is not just a website, it is a tool for the back and front end services within planning including searching policy documents without pdfs, data, planning applications, enforcement, maps etc. The concept is stand alone, however this will also explore whether this could be introduced for other councils and services particularly linked services such as environment, highways and land charges.\n\nThe discovery phase objectives are to explore what the online tool will look like to provide a comprehensive planning service where every activity can be carried out online, working with partners to ensure broad UX is undertaken and outcomes are considered so that they could be beneficial to all of the partners, the GLA and others.\n\nImpact: This project will benefit all users in a number of different ways. Our bid set out the following key benefits:\n\nThe digital online tool financial savings cannot be quantified however the benefits are considerable and the business case will be setting this out from the research. The business case will include user experience research on the following benefits:\n\n1. A more efficient, accessible planning system\n\n2. Clear, easy to find information\n\n3. The impact of incorrect information and data\n\n4. Cost savings for developers, residents, businesses, members in both time and money\n\n5. More development and more homes as this will encourage applying for planning permission, finding out where sites are for development\n\n6. Quicker systems as information is available, less checking, less replication, less costs\n\n7. Agile ways of working meeting user needs based on common and open application data standards, remove supplier lock in, ways of updating easily, stimulate and be a critical component of the future digital planning system\n\n8. Reusable and open planning data with minimal input will create new value propositions\n\n9. Improved communications of planning and development\n\n10. Lack of co-ordinated planning information, data and services with other authorities, services within Councils, strategic organisations etc\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Title: Web Programme for Camden Camden’s investment in LifeRay DXP, a horizontal platform technology that provides a Content Management System, an Account Portal (for residents and businesses) and eForm technology. The ambition is to provide a more seamless and personal customer experience for our users, across channels, thereby creating a single online customer footprint.\n\nPartners: PFIKS – LifeRay Technical Delivery Partner\n\nMission: To deliver a newly branded and structured Camden website, that uses ‘out the box’ personalisation components to provide more relevant and specific web content for our online users.\n\nImpact: The programme will benefit the website user, the account user, our residents and businesses, and those users who wish to transact with the Council through our online offering. They will begin to see content on the website that is more relevant to them, (based on their browsing history), so that key services and information that would be useful for them is easier to find.To create an experience that makes the user’s account part of the overall web journey.\n\nTo bring the multiple different flavours of legacy microsites currently in Camden, under the same LifeRay DXP infrastructure, whereby savings and efficiencies can start to be realised for the Council.\n\nTo have created a cloud-based infrastructure with scalability in mind, that is capable of supporting the online web channel and account experience for multiple authorities.\n\nThus creating a community of authorities who all use the same LifeRay DXP infrastructure, for CMS, Account Portal and simple eforms, which could result in wider efficiencies\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Wiring Estates, rolling out full fibre networks and driving social value\n\nPartners: Developing in conjunction with LB Hackney and partnering with fibre providers such as Community Fibre, Hyperoptic, Virgin Media, Openreach\n\nMission: Targetting our worst served estates to raise quality of internet service to next gen levels, a proposed social values programme which would encourage employment for the rollout from within the boroughs, engagement with our apprenticeship scheme, a tailored digital inclusion programme and a specific low cost tariff for social landlord tenants\n\nImpact: Expected benefits are initially for our social landlord tenants and will include improved internet services, delivery of social value projects and digital inclusion support, all of which are intended to improve skills, knowledge and capability\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: Helping LA Personal Finance teams to manage Universal Credit claimants\n\nPartners: Local Authorities - Hackney Council’s ASC Personal Finance Team have already reached out to their Camden colleagues and expressed an interest in what we are doing. We believe this is an issue for a number of councils , and could potentially generate a lot of interest from other local authorities\n\nMission: A requirement for claiming Universal Credit is that the claimant registers with the UC portal using a unique email address. Like many authorities Camden Council provides a chargeable Personal Finance Management service to some residents, some of whom are entitled to government benefits. In order to manage benefits on behalf of UC clients the PFM team need a process to set up a unique email address for each client and a way of forwarding all email to a central mailbox so the team can manage it all from one place. Other authorities are managing this using corporate or freemail addresses, but both of these solutions come with issues around cost, scale, complexity and security. Camden are investigating other solutions, including the possibility of standing up our own mailserver and domain and developing an open source front-end that will allow our PFM team to set up and close down email addresses to manage turnover of clients. The goal is a low-maintenance process for managing universal credit benefit claims which can be used for as long as necessary, with a simple migration path in the event that the DWP develop a centralised solution to the problem.\n\nImpact: ASC Personal Finance staff will be able to manage Universal Credit accounts from a single, central mailbox. They will have a straightforward process for turnover of email addresses that required a minimal amount of support and maintenance\n\nCommitment 4:\n\nTitle: Secure access to the SystmOne clinical system from Local Authority devices\n\nPartners: Local Authorities, NHS Health providers using SystmOne as their primary clinical system\n\nMission: Solving a longstanding issue with access to Clinical data in the SystmOne application. TPP’s SystmOne cannot provide feeds to shared integrated digital records in its standard configuration, and Camden have spent many years unsuccessfully trying to facilitate access to Clinical data through the CIDR platform. Speaking to Hammersmith and Fulham, we discovered that they have a solution that allows them to access CNWL’s SystmOne application directly from their Local Authority laptops, while Ealing have a similar solution for the SystmOne implementation in CLCH. We will attempt to replicate this in Camden, and are happy to share technical and design information, as well as general information about our experience. With SystmOne widely used nationally by Health bodies, we believe this information will help deliver better outcomes for integrated Health and Social Care teams across the UK.\n\nImpact: Family Support Workers and Social Care professionals who need to share data as part of the requirement for STP and integrated services will be able to see clinical information on residents in their care. Health Visitors and NHS staff working from Council locations will be able to use Local Authority IT equipment to view and update their clinical systems of record.\n\nCommitment 5:\n\nTitle: Online Self-Service Parking Online Suspensions Solution\n\nPartners: Jointly working with Westminster City Council – Parking Service, to develop this solution\n\nMission: To deliver a suspensions solution that serves the needs of Camden and Westminster parking services, and its residents/business users, which can also be used as a framework for other authorities\n\nImpact: The benefits of the project are to deliver a self-service online solution that enables residents, businesses and internal departments to select a parking bay/space they wish to suspend, make a payment and make amendments without the need to call the back-office. The solution will also produce the work list of Advance Warning Signs for the Parking officers to go out and place on street. The solution also enables those larger organisations that need to request regular parking suspensions, such as utility companies and Filming services, to manage multiple suspensions, including BACS payments and invoicing.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Digitising Planning Data\n\nPartners: The Local Digital Declaration provides a distinctive opportunity to reinforce our commitment to resident-centric services, explore the use of innovative technologies, challenge current practices, seek improvements to optimise value for money and, openly provide the information and data that residents need. This joint initiative by the UK Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities (DLUHC) and the Government Digital Service (GDS), aligns perfectly with our vision for a digitally empowered future and provides a small but strong starting point for change. We will Also be working with Essex County Council – Place Services to provide the technical expertise and knowledge to assist in driving this project forwards.\n\nMission: Currently the authority as a whole has a lot of paper-based information which is neither easily or readily accessible to residents and therefore when information is requested or required by residents, a significant amount of time is spent searching through the archived information to find what is required. Furthermore, the information that is already available digitally to residents is neither easy to find, navigate or use. This is not conducive to providing high quality services or open and transparent information to residents and is time consuming for both residents and the local authority. The modern, internet focused era offers the opportunity for unprecedented collaboration possibilities, efficiency gains and data insights. The Local Digital Declaration positions us to harness these advantages, delivering services seamlessly across the borough be learning from and contributing to best practice. Through this focus on collaboration, data driven decision-making, and efficiency, we consider that we will be able to reshape our public services for the benefit of the boroughs communities as a whole.\n\nImpact: Whilst we are signing the Local Digital Declaration following an application to the Digital Planning Improvement Fund to digitise and make accessible four datasets held by the Planning Service (Article 4 Directions, Listen Buildings, Conservation Areas and Tree Preservation Orders), this forms only a small part of what we are aiming to achieve and would be the beginning of a much wider project within the Planning Service. Digital Transformation is already occurring in other sectors of the authority with a successful start made in Revenues and Benefits through providing more information and services online, in a way that can be easily understood by residents. In the round we are aiming across the authority to drive a digitisation of all our services so that residents can quickly and easily find the right information, in the right format, when they need it through the use of technology. Where services that our residents require are not under our control, we are also targeting providing the information they need to correctly direct them to our relevant partner organisations or other authorities, Essex County Council being one such example. Castle Point Borough Council aspires to provide, based on its own initiative and learnings from best practice, local public services where technology acts as an enabler rather than a barrier. Embracing the principles of the Local Digital Declaration, we commit to redesigning services around resident needs, adopting modular open-sourced approaches, ensuring safe information sharing, demonstrating digital leadership and fostering an open culture that values digital ways of working. It is our aim to learn as much as possible about how we can improve our current offerings to residents and how we can implement this whilst contributing back to the Local Digital Declaration community our own findings, best practices and approaches to contribute to a circular feedback and development loop. By signing the Local Digital Declaration, Castle Point Borough Council strongly aligns itself with a national initiative which promotes innovation, efficiency, and resident-centric service delivery. This commitment already aligns with the Councils aims and objectives when it comes to digital and technological inclusive development and ensures that our community receives the best possible services and information possible in the internet age. We want to seize this opportunity to be part of the development of better technologies and practices where these can enhance rather than hinder the well-being of our residents. We are excited for the possibilities that digital transformation offers us as a local authority in providing resident-centric approaches which can significantly contribute to the well-being and satisfaction of the borough’s residents. This represents an ongoing effort to actively implement strategies that reflect our drive towards digital innovation and resident satisfaction.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Implementing a modern digitally-enabled platform and online account allowing citizens to customise their website experience and build an ongoing online dialogue and relationship with the Council.\n\nPartners: Ashton Court Group Ltd\n\nMission: Through the use of technology enable a customer-focused approach to deliver a customer experience that is seamless, consistent and personalised.\n\nImpact: A self-service portal allows customers to manage their account with the Council, and by doing so enables the Council to better manage customer expectations. By logging into their account, customers can perform a variety of tasks, such as:\n\n• Request service and schedule appointments 24/7\n\n• Track services and requests, as well as appointment details and status\n\n• Send messages directly to the council\n\n• Review their service and contact history\n\n• Find self-help tips and information\n\n• Learn about services and issues that may impact on services\n\n• View account information and manage payments\n\n• Get support for services and product questions\n\nA portal that allows customers to see their services can build trust in the Council through improved transparency, while real-time customer updates, e.g. email or mobile alerts show customers that we value their time.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: We will create a transaction-first website, primarily designed for mobile users and with a focus on improved customer journeys, while remaining accessible to the widest possible audience by making use of assistive technologies.\n\nPartners: Fat Media\n\nMission: The creation of well-designed web services that provide customers with personalised information and enable them to request services, report issues and undertake transactions online simply and quickly.\n\nEnsuring that the website can be used by people using assistive technologies to achieve the same results as users who do not need these technologies.\n\nImpact: To meet customer expectations of multi-device, personalised, 24/7 access to information and transactions.\n\nTo increase take-up of online services, thereby increasing customer choice, opportunity and service quality.\n\nProvision of clear, accurate, and timely information to the widest possible audience.\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: Implement in-cab technology into the refuse, trade waste, recycling and green waste vehicles to ensure delivery of a more efficient and cost effective waste collection service and easy access to risk assessment data for drivers.\n\nPartners: TBC\n\nMission: To install in-cab technology into refuse, trade waste, recycling and green waste vehicles to provide real time information to the back office service team, the Council’s contact centre (Dudley Council Plus) and customers.\n\nTo ensure risk assessment data is highlighted in vehicles e.g. narrow access, reverse only, overhead cables, schools, road works, violent customers etc., in accordance with HSE requirements.\n\nTo enable crews to report any issues and concerns live whilst on rounds from a menu of exceptions e.g. bin not out, contaminated bin, side waste etc and to record completion of rounds, providing a more efficient response to collection enquiries.\n\nTo provide real time data for waste collection services to improve performance management and route optimisation.\n\nImpact: • Provision of clear, accurate, and timely information on the collections to the back office service teams and the Council’s contact centre, therefore improving information and the service to customers.\n\n• Improved crew performance\n\n• Improved performance and route planning data, crews will have more up to date route information and risks (HSE recommendation)\n\n• Ability to automatically publish collection information to the website keeping customers up to date with developments linked to scheduled collections, e.g. weather conditions, vehicle breakdowns etc.\n\n• Operatives can accurately record whether a bin has been placed out at the correct time on the correct collection day, thereby reducing unwarranted resource time spent returning for erroneous missed collections with associated costs.\n\n• Enabling the Council to send automatically generated targeted correspondence to customers with regard to recycling contamination as an example, once live feedback has been received from the collection crew the automatic generation of information can be sent to a household explaining which material can and cannot be placed in the recycling bins.\n\nCommitment 4:\n\nTitle: Council Tax Arrears Collection\n\nPartners: Barnsley Metropolitan Borough CouncilBirmingham City CouncilBolton CouncilBradford Metropolitan District CouncilBrighton & Hove City CouncilCornwall CouncilEaling CouncilIslington CouncilEastbourne Borough CouncilKirklees CouncilLewes District CouncilManchester City CouncilMedway CouncilNewham London Borough CouncilNorth Hertfordshire District CouncilRotherham Metropolitan Borough CouncilSalford City CouncilSouthwark CouncilRoyal Borough of Kensington & ChelseaWakefield CouncilWealden District CouncilCarmarthenshire CouncilCity of WolverhamptonCoventry City CouncilDudley Metropolitan Borough CouncilSandwell Metropolitan Borough CouncilSolihull Metropolitan Borough CouncilWalsall Council\n\nMission: At 31 March 2018, the total amount of council tax outstanding in England amounted to £3 billion (cumulative from the introduction of council tax in 1993\n\nFor 2017/18, Local authorities in England collected £27.5 billion, with arrears of £818 million, approximately 3% uncollected.\n\nOur mission is to collect more council tax to maximise funding for local services, thus benefiting local residents. It will help ensure that those able to pay do not avoid their responsibility whilst identifying those who cant pay or are vulnerable and in need of assistance.\n\nImpact: Our business case supports an approach which we believe can increase collection rates for all councils across the country as well as reduce the amount of unpaid Council Tax outstanding from previous years. The increase in collection will help increase resources available to Councils and limit reductions in key service areas, where it matters most.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Optimising Data Usage to Improve Services to Our Communities\n\nPartners: Leicester City Council, Milton Keynes Council, Canterbury City Council\n\nMission: Councils across the UK hold an incredible wealth of data but have been slow to mirror the private sector in optimising this data as a strategic and operational tool to anticipate customer demands, target scarce resources to not so obvious areas in critical need, predict and prevent future adverse events and maximise opportunities as they emerge. Reviews of several high profile and tragic events across the UK including child fatalities have concluded that Councils together with other public sector partners had all along been in possession of the information needed to prevent or mitigate such events but were not aware of it or had not used it.\n\nThis project seeks to review the use of data within councils, using different service areas across five councils as case studies/proofs of concept. The objective is to develop a roadmap/toolkit for how data can be optimised, starting from the different multiple entry points into the organisation through to how it is validated and processed up to where it is stored and analysed to the point it could be used to predict customer trends, inform decision-making, service design and delivery and prevent or mitigate adverse events. Not only will it be of significant benefit to other local authorities, the principles can be applied to other public sector organisations.\n\nImpact: We intend to produce a business case highlighting the scale of the problem across local government in the UK. This will include documented issues, quantitative and qualitative costs and benefits, all within the context of customer expectations.\n\nThe user research report/section will highlight issues and challenges internal business areas and external customers (residents, businesses, partners etc.) face due to a lack of good, useable or analysed data.\n\nThe final report will detail the areas chosen, the difficulties and how they were overcome, the user research undertaken and the outcomes. Case studies will be included to illustrate methodologies alongside the risks and challenges encountered as well as the achievements. If the project leaves any questions unanswered or identifies new ones, these will be detailed in the report.\n\nWe believe that the intelligence arising from this project will serve to focus strategic thinking in different authorities regarding the use and benefits of data as a tool in customer-centric service design, delivery, appraisal and improvement.\n\nIt is clear to us that this project could potentially lead to several alpha projects covering how the data is subsequently used. It could be used to dynamically populate an open data platform leading to collaboration with private sector start-ups, larger organisations and charities. It could be used in predictive analysis and modelling to improve performance and resource allocation. Next phase projects could also be set up around the security, privacy and potential for implicit bias of machine learning/predictive modelling. These are all concerns within local authorities and the industry would benefit from further work along these lines.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Digital Planning Service\n\nPartners: Brent Council, Tower Hamlets Council, Lewisham Council, Ealing Council, Westminster City Council, Gateshead Council, Lambeth Council, Waltham Forest Council\n\nMission: To create an easy to use online tool for the planning service that allows the end user to access an easy to navigate system that is responsive to different platforms with clear communication using mobile phones, tablets and desk top computers in order to speed up decisions on planning applications and to stimulate more development and house building.\n\nImpact: The project aims to make the online planning information clear and easy to find, better navigation and accessibility, and easier to search and interrogate by council staff, Councillors, residents, businesses, developers and others.\n\nWill also seek to address the following\n\n1. potential applicants giving up,\n\n2. FOI’s,\n\n3. an opaque service,\n\n4. increasing emails,\n\n5. incorrect planning applications and data (both to increase submission of valid applications and to reduce subsequent refusals)\n\n6. lack of trust and understanding of planning policies.\n\n7. would make that information more intuitive and useful for the user\n\n8. that information can be pulled into digital services; so it comes to the user, instead of the user needing to find it\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Optimising data usage to improve services to our communities\n\nPartners: Milton Keynes CouncilCanterbury City CouncilLambeth London Borough Council\n\nMission: This project seeks to review the use of data within local authorities, using different service areas across four councils as case studies / proofs of concept.\n\nCouncils across the UK hold an incredible wealth of data but have been slow to mirror the private sector in optimising this data and reviews of several high profile and tragic events across the UK including child fatalities have concluded that councils together with other public sector partners had all along been in possession of the information needed to prevent or mitigate such events but were not aware of it or had not used it.\n\nStarting from the multiple points where data is captured by the organisation, the project will examine how data is validated, processed, stored, analysed and then how it could be used to inform decision making and service design and delivery, predict customer trends and prevent or mitigate adverse events.\n\nImpact: The objective is to develop a roadmap / toolkit for how data can be used as a strategic and operational tool to anticipate customer demands, target scarce resources to not so obvious areas in critical need, predict and prevent future adverse events and maximise opportunities as they emerge.\n\nThe project will illustrate the potential of data and enable councils to review how they use it as well as help them assess their own data infrastructure requirements. These are fundamental steps necessary to becoming a data driven organisation and the roadmap will play a key role in assisting local authorities to achieve this.\n\nNot only will it be of significant benefit to other local authorities, the principles can be applied to other public sector organisations.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Leicester City Council’s current digital landscape is expansive as we know to be commensurate in other authorities. The dependency on third party solutions has created many often-duplicate lines of business applications with multiple entry portals for citizens, all incurring on-going support and maintenance costs. The result is wasted investment in digital and large-scale inefficiencies across the organisation. The culture of Services buying parochially without a broader consideration of value has resulted in core and customer-facing systems being provided by proprietary vendors. This results in any implementation or replacement being a major undertaking. In addition, inherent vendor lock-in results in prohibitive costs for integration and/or additional functionality. Further opportunities to manage transactions across systems, share data and deliver a single shared view of a Customer are minimised. As a public body, the council is delivering services to the public, not to the council (in the vast majority of cases). Therefore, it follows that the user experience and services should be designed around the needs of the user, taking account of accessibility, literacy and digital maturity. However, in many cases, selection of technology has focussed largely on functionality for the council’s staff over the end user experience, leading to a fragmented user experience and an undesirable digital offering. The Council currently has little control over the current digital landscape. The aim is to strive towards a more flexible and scalable architecture and hence influence over shifting culturally and practically toward common platforms with user-centricity at the core of requirements, whilst also rationalising and consolidating multiple legacy applications. We are seeking to provide the Council with platforms that provide an opportunity to introduce user-centric products which give the Council greater freedom to pursue ‘build’ alongside ‘buy’. We have the in-house capability to develop products in-house ideally supported by “accelerators” from suppliers or other Authorities who have already started this journey using open low-code platforms.\n\nPartners: Leicester City Council are not yet aligned with any other Local Authorities although we would hope other organisations might be interested in collaborating if our project intentions are shared more widely. We are also fully in support ensuring that any development undertaken by any provider appointed to support was offered to others as a 2minimum viable product” or “accelerator” at a reasonable cost without development to take advantage of, or if delivered by our in house development team, that is was open for other authorities to use with detailed guidance on how to develop and implement the iterations of the solution in their own tenant/ environment.\n\nMission: Leicester City Council needs to move toward a new model of delivering products. Our mission is to:\n\n1. Culture\n\n• Shift the current culture mindset towards user centricity which will push the Council to rethink how technology is used to deliver superior experiences.\n\n• Redesigning services around the needs of the users by taking an experience-led architectural approach.\n\n• Establishing trust in the right functions to help move the council towards the right user experience and the right architecture\n\n2. Data\n\n• Redefining how data is used in defining and designing seamless user journeys, as well as leveraging data in the right way to enrich interactions.\n\n• Establishing an enterprise data model with data organised into the optimum structure for use in onsite interactions and reporting.\n\n• Organising and centralising data wherever possible to remove duplicate data sources and slowly consolidate the council’s digital landscape.\n\n3. Technology\n\n• Establishing technology as an enabler and not the director. The user experience is the starting point and technology should facilitate the service.\n\n• Moving the council away from rigid and inflexible systems and technologies to establish a decoupled architecture where systems work in unison.\n\n• Driving rationalisation and consolidation efforts by establishing commonalities and embedding the concept of shared services and technologies.\n\n4. Process and Business Model\n\n• Establishing functions and processes that put the user at the heart of decision-making, ensuring that investment is worthwhile and smart.\n\n• Establishing functions that can provide the necessary governance to move towards the future-state architecture.\n\n• Embedding functions and processes to actively, and continuously, improve the council’s digital landscape, without compromising on a superior experience. Practically, at this early stage this means we must break the model of services buying solutions in isolation. This continually introduces technical debt and “hairball architecture” as internal Development teams attempt to integrate multiple systems using bespoke methods. With the assistance of a third-party we have assembled a programme of work to deliver a number of technological improvements which would ultimately introduce the opportunity for cultural change across Council Services The overall programme includes the introduction of several major enabling technology platforms:\n\n• Product-development platforms that allow our internal teams to ‘Build’ rather than ‘Buy’.\n\n• A common orchestration/Enterprise Service Bus Layer and Presentation Layer to allow us to break into the silos of the proprietary systems.\n\n• Enhance and further develop our Data Warehouse toward data lakes that may be accessed by service areas using off-the-shelf reporting tools to provide insights. For the purpose of this fund our requirements are on the surface modest, but fundamentally transformational and set out the very building block needed to transition to this model. We are seeking funds to assist us in our first minimum viable product “MVP” build which is developing a Complaints and Enquiries Management system for use by the citizens of Leicester and various services across the Council, notably Customer Services The Product backlog would then include further iterations to deliver enhancements for Councillors, and on board Property Services and Housing to manage their complaints away from their main systems. Leicester City Council deals with a wide demographic, with each citizen engaging with the council for a variety of reasons. As it stands, there is currently no automated system to collect complaints or enquiries from members of the public. For the council , this not only significantly limits visibility of the types of complaints and enquiries being received, it also hinders any overview of if they are being dealt with by the relevant service provision and the member of the public being kept informed on progress or a resolve. Each service provision runs a different entry point, be that a form, portal, or simple email to a generic account and often officers are individually contacted. For our citizens it presents nothing but confusion, there is not a single entry point to how they should report complaints and make enquiries of any nature to us and as the user journey is so poor and fragmented, very often more than not, they get no response or updates by return. For many of these users, their emotional state is often negative triggered by a letter they have received, burdened by external pressures, etc. This emotional state influences their online behaviour and the negatives highlighted below deliver a sub-par experience that is exacerbated because of their emotional state. This does not facilitate real-time tracking and visibility by the complainant nor the service responsible. We intend using the Microsoft Dynamics Low-Code platform which is a technology we have knowledge of having used an accelerator made available to authorities as a Minimum viable product to undertake Track and Trace during COVID. We wish to build a foundational Complaints and Enquiries product that gathers all enquiries & complaints that automatically triages them to the relevant services, whilst holding a central view within Customer Services. This would enable the member of public to have , consistent messaging, real time updates, view the status and any replies against their case and timelines For the Council it would give them full transparency on what is being received, with full reporting on type, relative to which service, response times. It would also enable Customer Services to ensure other services are dealing with the ones triaged to them under a per agreed SLA. It would enable one overview of what’s being reported for the Council to identify if there is a consistent problem early on and make provisions to resolve early. For the Councillors It would enable the visibility to see what is being reported within their own ward to support the constituents. As our citizens have a wide mix of digital capability and maturity, we will ensure this is considered in the design of this case management iteration and associated presentation layer, and that we deliver the experience expected. As part of this project we would need to appoint external developers to assist in the design, however as part of this we would ensure that there was a knowledge transfer to our own internal teams and provide training to develop an internal centre of excellence on the product for any iteration moving forward, that could also support other authorities. Longer term, we will continue with reiterations of the same using the same methodology and under our four main mission statements whilst rationalising and consolidating the legacy applications currently in place. Functionality will be centralised (irrespective of department) and smaller, discreet applications will be introduced to meet specific needs.\n\nImpact: The initial Complaints Management Product will be of immediate benefit to various Service areas and the Citizens of Leicester. The new Complaints and Enquiries Management product would provide immediate feedback to those raising cases and direct the case to the correct team. Progress would be updated and available to Customers and Services. SLA’s would be implemented which could be reported upon. Data could be examined to provide insights into complaints and enquiries to allow a targeted response Customer & stakeholder journey will be improved vastly, with full visibility of enquiries and responses in a timely manner. Senior officer time will be saved by the one point of contact approach as they will only deal with enquiries that they should be. A fully automated approach will improve reporting to the Director/Head of Service to provide full visibility of type of enquiry which will allow for issues to be identified and remedied. This product would allow us to begin building a single view of our Customers and provide an embryonic Enterprise Data Model. Our view is this product would be of value to a number of other Councils who use the Dynamics low-code platform. The success would be measurable through KPIs.\n\nThese would include for example:\n\n• time to respond to complaints and enquiries.\n\n• time to resolve complaints and enquiries.\n\n• number of Service Level Target breaches.\n\n• number of service referrals.\n\n• number of repeat complaints.\n\nOnce the Dynamics platform and the Case management MVP is in place via the Complaints and Enquiries Product, we would then intend building a CRM Product based on key functions that would need to be implemented as part of the first-stage product. Establishing a new CRM is a fundamental objective to support our Customer Services Department and out Citizens. At present they are reliant upon eForms which do not have the appropriate CRM functionality nor integrations with other systems. As a result, there are disjointed user journeys.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Linking Registration Services to other Government Services though new data sharing opportunities presented by the Digital Economy Act 2017 & the Registration Services Act 1953\n\nPartners: Social FinanceWorcestershire County Council Registration servicesRedditch Borough CouncilBromsgrove District CouncilMalvern Hills District CouncilWychavon District CouncilWorcester City CouncilWyre Forest District Council Worcestershire NHS via Clinical Commissioning Groups, Acute Trust and Health & Care TrustWest Mercia PoliceHereford & Worcester Fire & Rescue ServiceSuffolk County CouncilHull City Council\n\nMission: Worcestershire County Council (via WODA with partners) will explore the benefits of securely sharing Registration Services data to support other local government activities such as planning provision of local services, removing barriers by verification services, safeguarding children, fraud, and improving statistics for planning and policy decisions.\n\nDiscovery will test, with users, potential use cases for Registration Services data sharing and identify opportunities for sharing this data between public sector partners.\n\nAccessing and sharing data could be achieved by creating common data models and standards, as well as API's to enable connection between agencies and associated services. This would enable the design of uniform data standards to create a structure that all local authorities can adopt and build upon.\n\nImpact: This project would potentially provide significant cost savings and efficiency benefits nationally, proportionate to volumes of births, marriages and deaths in England.\n\nExamples of this would be through needs led forecasting for health care and education, timely alerts to safeguard vulnerable children and/or adult with health & care needs and combating fraud such as housing tenancies and Blue Badge (Disability) to reclaim public funds.\n\nThe key success measure will be:\n\no Cost benefit analysis on sharing registration data for the benefit of other public services\n\nPossible long term benefits:\n\nDeliver a common standards approach to using registrations data to support the following roles and their associated activities:\n\no Market Research Officers and Local Planners: Plan provision of local services and improve statistics for planning and policy decisions\n\no Residents and Customer Service Agents: Remove barriers by automating verification services\n\no Social Workers: Safeguard children and adults\n\no Fraud Investigators: Prevent Fraud\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Digitalisation of the Duty of Care application system for trade waste customers.To improve the efficiency of the application process for the trade waste customer and the processing of that application for the Waste and Recycling service.\n\nPartners: Worcester City Council, Wychavon District Council\n\nMission: Within a year of signing the Digital Declaration we expect to have provided an online service for trade waste customers to complete their Duty of Care application. The customer will receive an instant response to their application providing their certificate in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The customer will receive renewal reminders prior to the expiry of their current certificate and receive a unique link to renew. This will be prepopulated with the information provided previously to ease the renewal process. The customer will be able to check, make any changes and submit, again immediately receiving their certificate by email.\n\nThe Waste and Recycling service will have access to a back office which will record the Duty of Care applications. They will have the ability to edit some details where it might be required and issue certificates. The service will also receive notification when a certificate has expired so that they know to cease the trade waste collection service.\n\nImpact: The service on a whole will see cost savings in printing, postage and time spent processing applications.\n\nThe Waste and Recycling Officer will benefit widely from this development. They will shift the majority of paper applications to online reducing the time spent process applications and issuing certificates. Direct contact with the customer will become focused on resolving more complex issues and not to complete general administration tasks. The trade waste collection officers will not need to return to the office to check a customer has their certificate in place. Instead they will be able to view the required information digitally on a mobile device.\n\nFor the customer the application process will become much simpler. The online application will be smart and only require the customer to complete the fields relevant to them. The customer will be able to submit their application at any time during the year, reducing the expanse of tasks to complete for the end of the financial year. The certificate will be produced immediately so the customer does not need to wait for a copy to arrive in the post to file away safely. They will be able to access their digital certificate at any time.\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: Digital transformation of officer working to enable more efficient shared services. To be achieved by:- Reduce Officer costs and time spent travelling between sites by encouraging digital communication methods i.e. conference calling- Encourage more mobile working for Officers integrating mobile applications with both customer front end and back office applications- Offer more flexible working for Officers for off site working/home working- GDPR, reducing the need to Officers to carry paper files- Encourage ‘easy’ digital collaboration between Officers to reduce meeting times\n\nPartners: Wychavon District Council, Worcester City Council\n\nMission: Within a year of signing the Digital Declaration we hope to have introduced Officers to more flexible mobile ways of working. We will have assessed equipment and workspaces to reflect our needs. We hope that Officers will see our digital drive as their ‘normal’ day to day practice.\n\nImpact: We hope to benefit our Officers and our Customers by leading our own Digital Revolution.\n\nEg. The Planning Officer will be able to check what site visits they need to do whilst sat eating their breakfast at home. They will be displayed on a map on their mobile device. The Planning Officer will go to their first site, they will look at the plans they need on their mobile device and complete a form which covers all aspects of their visit. The completed form will automatically update their planning application record. No need to take any paper folders with them or go back to the office. The public will immediately see that the officer has been out to the site on our website. And if the member of the public is following that planning application they will be notified that there is an update to view. Before the Planning Officer attends their next site visit an emergency meeting is called. It doesn’t matter that the Planning Officer is 40 miles away because they can video call with the rest of their team to attend from their car. The meeting concludes and the Planning Officer continues to their next visit.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Failure Demand\n\nPartners: Waste services, enforcement, Newlincs (Private sector waste partner) and the community\n\nMission: We aim to understand our failure demand with clear data analytics, engaging with our residents to identify the root causes and systemic failures.\n\nBy understanding our failure through discovery we are able to define clearly our ‘how might we’s’ to test hypotheses and prototype solutions to test with users.\n\nImpact: By driving out failure demand we will:\n\n• Reduce rework\n\n• Increase satisfaction\n\n• Reduce complaints\n\n• Release capacity in the service to focus on our priorities\n\n• Make significant savings across the wider organisation\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Blue Badges\n\nPartners: DfT, Business Support, Commissioned assessors and the community\n\nMission: To develop effective and efficient case management for the assessment and issue of all blue badges meeting the requirements of new guidance for hidden conditions and integrating with the new DfT service. Furthermore integrating the payment process with GovPay through a pilot\n\nImpact: This will ensure we:\n\n• Deliver an end-to-end, seamless user experience\n\n• Save money\n\n• Make sure we meet the guidelines\n\n• Handle all applications in a timely manner\n\n• Improve the percentage of online payments\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: Business Intelligence, Data and Performance Management\n\nPartners: North East Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group (NELCCG), Police, Fire NHS, Engie (Private sector infrastructure partner), Lincs Inspire (Leisure Trust)\n\nMission: To further develop our capability and prototypes to support strategic and operational management decision-making. To be become predictive and use our data to plan and design our services to meet the needs of users and the organisation most effectively.\n\nImpact: We aim to understand our demand, pressures and capacity gaps and to:\n\n• Improve how we visualise data and intelligence\n\n• Improve how we make planning decisions about how we focus our resources\n\n• Focus our resources where we can make the most difference\n\n• Improve how we share data and information\n\n• Develop real insight to inform how we design services\n\nCommitment 4:\n\nTitle: Domiciliary Care\n\nPartners: NELCCG, Focus, Adult services providers, service users\n\nMission: To improve the relationship between the carer and cared-for by bringing stability and sustainability to the care sector. This means the cared-for having visibility of who their carer is and moving from a time and task model to one that meet the needs of the users.\n\nImpact: We aim to empower the carers to have a more active role in the care system by enhancing their status across the collective professionals around users, specifically through:\n\n• Improved communication and handover from carers visible to other professionals across the system\n\n• Improved communication with the users to know who will visit them today\n\n• Empowering the carers to understand the medication they are giving and which are essential\n\n• Improving information-sharing across the system to reduce crisis events\n\n• Avoiding duplication of medication on discharge\n\nCommitment 5:\n\nTitle: Permit use at our recycling centre\n\nPartners: Newlincs (Private sector waste partner), enforcement and waste management\n\nMission: To improve the flow of demand at our recycling centre and to manage potentially illegal trade waste.\n\nImpact: Residents can more easily apply for a permit and we will be able to reduce backlog and queues at our recycling centre. This will improve the management of potentially illegal trade waste and provide intelligence to identify offenders and enhance our enforcement; specifically, we will be able to:\n\n• Enable users to apply for a permit online in advance of visiting the recycling centre\n\n• Identify key patterns of potential trade waste\n\n• Reduce queuing at the recycling site\n\n• Track users by name and registration number\n\n• Recognise and manage banned users\n\n• Meet GDPR compliance for data handling and storage\n\nCommitment 6:\n\nTitle: Moving Home as a service\n\nPartners: Revenues and benefits, electoral registrations, waste, customers services, libraries, schools admissions, transport and planning.\n\nMission: To design a moving home service where residents moving within or into North East Lincolnshire sign up to multiple services simultaneously, telling their story once. Moving is stressful enough and residents end up calling separate parts of the council multiple times i.e. ‘to get the right bins’, ‘to register to vote’, ‘to pay their council tax’ and many more.\n\nImpact: Residents will sign up to multiple services in one contact. We will ensure concise information, advice and guidance is available to meet their needs, easing their move into NELC. Specifically this will:\n\n• Ensure a personalised, seamless transaction for the user\n\n• Save time and money for the council\n\n• Reduce the delay in the user receiving the services they need\n\n• Signpost to other actions they may need or like to take\n\n• Improve timeliness of income collection and revenue for the council\n\n• Reduce the impact of the annual canvas on our elections team\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Provide responsive digital services that meet the expectations of all our customers and stakeholders\n\nPartners: Grancius, Netcall\n\nMission: Spelthorne’s mission is to ensure systems are secure & connected with high levels of integration. They will be scalable, future-proof and provide efficiencies. The data we hold will be accurate, appropriate, and relevant. Communication channels will be made responsive, simple and accessible – with no digital exclusion. Where possible, transactions and processes will be automated. Customers will be empowered to self-serve or find information via our web site & online portal – removing layers of staff interaction. A greater use of analytics and reporting will be introduced to measure performance and engagement – including customer satisfaction and feedback and to provide a better all in one service to our community.\n\nImpact: The benefits are:\n\nIncreased Efficiency : This mission will help Spelthorne streamline processes and automate tasks, reducing the administrative burden and freeing up staff to focus on higher value tasks. For example, the implementation of an online customer portal and the utilisation of digital workflows and e-forms. This leads to significant time savings and increases the efficiency of our operations.\n\nCost Savings: Our mission offers significant cost in a variety of ways. The adoption of digital systems will reduce paperwork and manual processes, which leads to lower administrative costs. Our goal to move to digital communication channels will improve the speed and accuracy of communication, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming in-person meetings. The use of data analytics helps identify areas where resources can be allocated more effectively, potentially leading to cost savings. Finally, automation and the use of artificial intelligence will help streamline processes and reduce the need for certain resources, further reducing costs.\n\nBetter Decision Making: Greater use of digital tools will provide us with real-time data and analytics, enabling better decision making and more targeted interventions. For example, we can use smart metering technology to collect real-time data on energy use in buildings and other infrastructure and use this data to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. By capturing and analysing data on our residents behaviour and service usage, we will identify areas for improvement and implement more effective interventions. We aim for this to lead to better outcomes for residents and demonstrate value for money.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration: Our digital transformation mission will promote collaboration between departments and with other local authorities, enabling more joined-up services and better outcomes for residents. For instance, the adoption of common standards and platforms to improve interoperability between different systems and reduce the duplication of effort. This will lead to more efficient and effective service delivery and enable us to work more closely with other organisations to address complex challenges.\n\nUpskilled Staff: We want to regularly provide training and development opportunities for staff to build their digital skills and capabilities, ensuring they are equipped to deliver high-quality services in a digital age. For example, MS Office training and better utilising our business applications such as SharePoint and Teams.\n\nEngaged with Citizens: This mission will facilitate the opportunity to regularly engage with residents in order to understand their needs and preferences and involve them in the co-design of new digital services and initiatives. By engaging with citizens, the council will ensure that its digital services are tailored to the needs of its users, and that residents are engaged and informed about the changes that are being made.\n\nContribution to Addressing Climate Change: This mission has emerged as a powerful tool in tackling climate change and promoting sustainability. Leveraging digital technologies, the council and its staff will improve their understanding of the impact of their activities on the environment and take steps to reduce their carbon footprint. For instance the use of digital tools such as sensors and analytics will help us to optimize its resource usage and minimize waste. Additionally digital technologies are also facilitating the shift towards more sustainable practices. For example, the rise of hybrid working has reduced the need for as many employees to commute to work daily, resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Increase digital engagement and skills for all our residents, to have everyone who possibly can be digital included.\n\nPartners: Agilisys Digital & Taskforce Partners\n\nMission: Encouraging people to develop digitally, enhancing creativity by making technology available. Encourage digital engagement and enhancing skills by offering courses at a higher level for our residents.\n\nRoll out the Duke of York iDea Silver Award across the community to adults, children and our workforce. We will aim to complete this by:\n\no Offering digital courses, such as get online and coding sessions by working in collaboration with our taskforce partners and volunteers\n\no Offering residents access to computers within our Libraries and Life Centres so that they can interact digitally with us, and enhance their skills. Updating our digital access points within our Libraries and Life Centres.\n\no Promoting the Duke of York iDea Silver Award by blending this with current/future digital sessions and events to show how this can support our residents and help with digitally enhancing their skills. Linking in with schools, colleges, residents and staff.\n\no Having a presence at local community days, college days, youth events to promote iDea\n\no Have our Digital Taskforce partners completing the Silver Award to enhance their digital skills and then for them to encourage residents to sign up/signpost iDea awards.\n\nOur Digital Taskforce who is a collective of individuals from the private, public and voluntary/community sectors, who live and/or work in Wigan Borough and are committed to working with people, groups, businesses and organisations across the borough to support the development of the area through ‘digital’.\n\nImpact: Aim to have everyone who possibly can be digitally included by 2020 to enhance their digital skills and building self-reliance. This will:\n\no Support vulnerable groups / older people to get online to reduce social isolation\n\no Build confidence and improve residents digital skills to help with job opportunities, and interacting with us digitally\n\no Encourage more people to get online by offering free PC access across Libraries and Life Centres using better equipment\n\no Broaden the understanding of digital and to gain both basic and advanced digital skills\n\no Building on existing digital skills to a more advanced level to upskill our residents.\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Develop an Integrated Care Organisation\n\nPartners: Wigan CCG & WWL\n\nMission: Developing the Healthier Wigan Partnership and specifically focusing on how we can integrate community health and care services in a way that will enable individuals to look after their own wellbeing, was developed as part of an agreement between Wigan Council and our NHS Partners across the borough. This agreement is called the Deal for Health and Wellness, and it’s a plan to ensure that the whole health and care system in the borough can be financially sustainable and support good outcomes for people.\n\nImpact: Our aim is to Initial scoping needs to be completed as part of the developing Healthy Wigan Partnership (HWP) which will help to form the clarity on work needed to integrate workflows and information flows between Health & Social Care, (Primary, Acute, Community and other care settings) as well as integrate staff and IT estates into a single operational form, with an outcome which provides a prioritised solution & delivery model. Which will provide:\n\n• Improved information sharing & Streamlined information flows\n\n• Aligned back office systems\n\n• Rationalisation of systems and processes and teams in line with IT Reform and Transformation.\n\n• Further rollout of existing system access to wider partners\n\n• Agile working & co-locating\n\n• Digital online citizen/patient records\n\n• Better connected communities\n\nCommitment 3:\n\nTitle: Develop an Integrated Care Organisation\n\nPartners: Wigan CCG & WWL\n\nMission: Develop a Mini Town to within an area of the borough, to demonstrate the impact of sensor tech and evaluate if this technology can provide wider offering to the council.\n\nImpact: To test a number of solutions which would help in realising efficiencies across the services which allow the authority to work smarter by reducing unnecessary travel, removing non essential ‘jobs’ from day-to-day work, focussing on what is needed.\n\no Winter Sensors for Gritting Trucks\n\no Pothole Sensors\n\no Waste Management\n\no Cemetery Management\n\no Drainage\n\nThis discovery piece would:\n\no Carry out data/technical analysis to identify a suitable geographical area\n\no Define key processes/workflows\n\no Define cost/benefits\n\no Develop sensor technology options & use cases for Alpha pilot\n\nCommitment 4:\n\nTitle: Single view of a child's record\n\nPartners: Schools, Police, GP\n\nMission: We want to on-board wider partners as part of multi agency working, including primary and secondary schools to directly access and input Early Help Referrals directly into the system. We want to provide a single system view for Children’s records to key agencies which will help to inform them to provide safer, more informed services wrapped around the need of a child.\n\nWe would like to deliver a supported and structured training path to over 200 schools and wider partners on the system.\n\nImpact: The model will concentrate on provision of introduction skills, specific initial training on the system and process with the schools and follow-up on-site support days, providing skills workshops and user group management for the schools to embrace the benefits of the new system.\n\nThis project will deliver:\n\no Single view of a child’s record across multiple systems to external partners\n\no Secure, accurate, real time access to a child’s record\n\no Improved information sharing\n\no Support Ofsted Social Care\n\no User confidence & supported deployment\n\no Reduced admin time\n\no Less duplicated data entry\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Linking Registration Services to other Government Services though new data sharing opportunities presented by the Digital Economy Act 2017 & the Registration Services Act 1953\n\nPartners: Social FinanceWorcestershire County Council Registration servicesRedditch Borough CouncilBromsgrove District CouncilMalvern Hills District CouncilWychavon District CouncilWorcester City CouncilWyre Forest District Council Worcestershire NHS via Clinical Commissioning Groups, Acute Trust and Health & Care TrustWest Mercia PoliceHereford & Worcester Fire & Rescue ServiceSuffolk County CouncilHull City Council\n\nMission: Worcestershire County Council (via WODA with partners) will explore the benefits of securely sharing Registration Services data to support other local government activities such as planning provision of local services, removing barriers by verification services, safeguarding children, fraud, and improving statistics for planning and policy decisions.\n\nDiscovery will test, with users, potential use cases for Registration Services data sharing and identify opportunities for sharing this data between public sector partners.\n\nAccessing and sharing data could be achieved by creating common data models and standards, as well as API's to enable connection between agencies and associated services.

The meeting concludes and the Planning Officer continues to their next visit.\n\nProject commitments:\n\nCommitment 1:\n\nTitle: Linking Registration Services to other Government Services though new data sharing opportunities presented by the Digital Economy Act 2017 & the Registration Services Act 1953\n\nPartners: Social FinanceWorcestershire County Council Registration servicesRedditch Borough CouncilBromsgrove District CouncilMalvern Hills District CouncilWychavon District CouncilWorcester City CouncilWyre Forest District Council Worcestershire NHS via Clinical Commissioning Groups, Acute Trust and Health & Care TrustWest Mercia PoliceHereford & Worcester Fire & Rescue ServiceSuffolk County CouncilHull City Council\n\nMission: Worcestershire County Council (via WODA with partners) will explore the benefits of securely sharing Registration Services data to support other local government activities such as planning provision of local services, removing barriers by verification services, safeguarding children, fraud, and improving statistics for planning and policy decisions.\n\nDiscovery will test, with users, potential use cases for Registration Services data sharing and identify opportunities for sharing this data between public sector partners.\n\nAccessing and sharing data could be achieved by creating common data models and standards, as well as API's to enable connection between agencies and associated services. This would enable the design of uniform data standards to create a structure that all local authorities can adopt and build upon.\n\nImpact: This project would potentially provide significant cost savings and efficiency benefits nationally, proportionate to volumes of births, marriages and deaths in England.\n\nExamples of this would be through needs led forecasting for health care and education, timely alerts to safeguard vulnerable children and/or adult with health & care needs and combating fraud such as housing tenancies and Blue Badge (Disability) to reclaim public funds.\n\nThe key success measure will be:\n\no Cost benefit analysis on sharing registration data for the benefit of other public services\n\nPossible long term benefits:\n\nDeliver a common standards approach to using registrations data to support the following roles and their associated activities:\n\no Market Research Officers and Local Planners: Plan provision of local services and improve statistics for planning and policy decisions\n\no Residents and Customer Service Agents: Remove barriers by automating verification services\n\no Social Workers: Safeguard children and adults\n\no Fraud Investigators: Prevent Fraud\n\nCommitment 2:\n\nTitle: Digital transformation of officer working to enable more efficient shared services. To be achieved by:- Reduced Officer costs and time spent travelling between sites by encouraging digital communication methods i.e. conference calling- Encourage more mobile working for Officers integrating mobile applications with both customer front end and back office applications- Offer more flexible working for Officers for off site working/home working- GDPR, reducing the need to Officers to carry paper files- Encourage ‘easy’ digital collaboration between Officers to reduce meeting times\n\nPartners: Malvern Hills District Council, Worcester City Council\n\nMission: Within a year of signing the Digital Declaration we hope to have introduced Officers to more flexible mobile ways of working. We will have assessed equipment and workspaces to reflect our needs. We hope that Officers will see our digital drive as their ‘normal’ day to day practice.\n\nImpact: We hope to benefit our Officers and our Customers by leading our own Digital Revolution.\n\ne.g. The Planning Officer will be able to check what site visits they need to do whilst sat eating their breakfast at home. They will be displayed on a map on their mobile device. The Planning Officer will go to their first site, they will look at the plans they need on their mobile device and complete a form which covers all aspects of their visit. The completed form will automatically update their planning application record. No need to take any paper folders with them or go back to the office. The public will immediately see that the officer has been out to the site on our website. And if the member of the public is following that planning application they will be notified that there is an update to view. Before the Planning Officer attends their next site visit an emergency meeting is called. It doesn’t matter that the Planning Officer is 40 miles away because they can video call with the rest of their team to attend from their car. The meeting concludes and the Planning Officer continues to their next visit."
