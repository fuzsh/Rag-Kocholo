In those days the majority of conveyancers and solicitors purchased their searches directly from the councils. This was a laborious, confusing and a time consuming task with over three hundred and fifty separate councils, all with differing systems and prices which is why our service was so popular. Many of the councils were reluctant to develop their online ordering and delivery systems so in the early 2000’s a new system was developed to centralise the ordering, delivery and payment for local authority searches to be known as NLIS.\n\nIn February of 2003 we decided that we could do better so NLIS Ltd was formed with the intention of providing a fully electronic system for both ordering and delivering a Local Authority Search for Darlington Borough Council with account facilities for payments. As the conveyancing professionals became hungry for more information, further searches and reports were made available such as; Drainage & Water Searches, Environmental Reports, Mining Reports and many more in addition to the Local Authority Search for Darlington Borough Council.\n\nMany conveyancers disliked the price some councils charged for their searches so we decided to give the option of our own regulated searches know as a Local Authority Search for Darlington Borough Council governed by the PCCB, the CoPSO code of practise and carrying indemnity insurance. The ability to choose the various reports from one site, pay after thirty days or instantly via card payment and receive all the reports electronically has proved very popular."
