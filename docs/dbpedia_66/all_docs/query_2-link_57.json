This means that we haven't found any breaches of the regulations for that area. For older reports, they are labeled as 'No action'. In both cases, our judgement means that we are not demanding change from the provider of the service for this area.\n\nIn our new approach, these show as 'Not all regulations met'. This means that we found at least one regulation had been breached in this area. For older reports, you will see a label of 'Improvements required'. In both cases, we expect the provider to make changes to the service.\n\nIn older reports, a red cross means we are taking enforcement action against the provider because of breaches of the regulations we have found. In our new approach, we show enforcement separately from the assessment judgement so you won't see a red cross displayed."
