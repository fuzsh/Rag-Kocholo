        "text": "Darlington Borough Council has set a Council Tax for 2024/25 of £2,147.26 as the equivalent Band D amount in the urban area.\n\nThis is made up of the tax for the:\n\nBorough Council’s services £1,866.02\n\nOffice of the Durham Police Crime and Victims’ Commissioner £255.24\n\nCounty Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority £118.12\n\nThe increase in Council Tax for each authority from 2023/24 is:\n\nDarlington Borough Council 4.99%\n\nOffice of the Durham Police Crime and Victims’ Commissioner 5.09%\n\nCounty Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority 2.99%\n\nThe remainder is converted to an additional Council Tax for parish households.\n\nThe figures appropriate to each parish and band are shown in the table below.\n\nYou can challenge your Council Tax band if you think the band is wrong.\n\nChallenge your Council Tax band [external link].\n\nAdult Social Care Precept\n\nThe Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has made an offer to adult social care authorities.\n\nAdult social care authorities are local authorities which have functions under Part 1 of the Care Act 2014, namely county councils in England, district councils for an area in England for which there is no county council, London borough councils, the Common Council of the City of London and the Council of the Isles of Scilly.\n\nThe offer is the option of an adult social care authority being able to charge an additional “precept” on its council tax for the financial year 2024/25 without holding a referendum, to assist the authority in meeting expenditure on adult social care.\n\nSubject to the annual approval of the House of Commons, the Secretary of State intends to offer the option of charging this “precept” at an appropriate level in the financial year 2024/25.\n\nThe Secretary of State has determined (and the House of Commons has approved) a referendum principle of 5% (comprising 2% for expenditure on adult social care and 3% for other expenditure), for adult social care authorities.\n\nThe referendum principles allow an authority to set Council Tax up to 5% in 2024 without holding a referendum.\n\nDarlington Borough Council has approved an additional adult social care “precept” of 2% in 2024/25.\n\nValuation bands\n\nEach dwelling is placed in a valuation band to enable the council to calculate the bill for each property. The value is based on what the property might have sold for on the open market at 1/4/1991- not the current value which is now likely to be considerably more.\n\nEven the values of properties built since 1991 are estimates of what they might have been worth at 1/4/1991 had they been completed.\n\nThe current range of property values within each valuation band is as follows:\n\nThe proportion of each band to band D means, for example, that a dwelling in band H will pay 3 times as much Council Tax as a dwelling in band A and twice as much as a dwelling in band D. A dwelling in band A will pay two thirds of the amount paid by dwelling in band D.\n\nEven if you make improvements to your property that significantly increase its value, the valuation banding cannot be increased until either there is a change of ownership or there is revaluation of all dwellings.\n\nDwellings are valued for Council Tax by the Valuation Office Agency (part of HM Revenue & Customs) and not by the council. Details of all properties are available on the Valuation Office Agency's website [external link].\n\nIf you think the valuation band placed on your property is too high, you can only appeal to the Valuation Office Agency in specific circumstances, including the following:\n\nLess than six months have elapsed since a change of ownership in the property\n\nThe property has been wholly or partly demolished\n\nThe surroundings of the property have changed\n\nImprovements have been made to the property and it has been sold\n\nCouncil Tax will always be payable on the existing valuation until any appeal is successful in reducing the valuation.\n\nPenalties\n\nYou should always tell us of any changes that may affect your Council Tax or respond to our written request for information.\n\nThe law allows us to charge a penalty of £70 if you fail to tell us about:\n\nA single person discount that should have ended\n\nAn exemption on a dwelling that should have ended\n\nAny other discount that should have ended\n\nA change of address\n\nAny change to the household that affects who should be the liable person\n\nInformation that was requested to establish liability\n\nPenalties will normally be added to your Council Tax account and a new bill will be sent to you.\n\nAdditional penalties\n\nIf you've had the first £70 penalty added to your Council Tax bill and we need to make further requests for the same information, we can add further penalties of £280 every time you fail to supply this information.\n\nIf you disagree with the penalty\n\nIf you disagree with a penalty, you should discuss it with us first so that you can explain why you disagree. Please contact us and we can advise you how to proceed.\n\nPayments during the appeal process\n\nIf you do appeal the decision of the penalty being applied, unlike appealing any other part of your Council Tax, you do not have to pay your penalty until your appeal has been decided. You should continue to pay your Council Tax until a decision is made.\n\nEmpty Property Premium\n\nAs part of the government’s measures to tackle the country’s housing shortage, The Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, contained a provision to amend the definition of long-term empty homes. This means that from 1st April 2024 onwards, unfurnished properties that have been empty for one year or more, are now liable to the Empty Property Premium.\n\nIf you own a property which has been empty and unfurnished for 1 year or more, you will have to pay an additional charge on your Council Tax.\n\nThis is known as an Empty Property Premium and will show as a separate entry on your Council Tax bill.\n\nIf you own a property which has been empty and unfurnished for 1 year or more you will have to pay an additional premium of 100% on top of your normal Council Tax charge\n\nIf you own a property which has been empty and unfurnished for 5 years or more you will have to pay an additional premium of 200% on top of your normal Council Tax charge\n\nIf you own a property which has been empty and unfurnished for 10 years or more you will have to pay an additional premium of 300% on top of your normal Council Tax charge\n\nIn some cases, an exemption to this charge can be applied. Visit our exemptions page for more information and how to apply.\n\nSecond Home Premium\n\nFrom 1 April 2025 a 100% Council Tax Premium is applied and is payable in addition to the standard Council Tax liability in respect of \"Second Home\" dwellings.\n\nThe introduction of a new Council Tax Premium for Dwellings Occupied Periodically (\"Second Homes\") was approved at a meeting of full Council on 7th November 2023, coming into effect from 1 April 2025.\n\nThis follows changes to legislation for Council Tax included in the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, which amends the Local Government Finance Act 1992.\n\nThe change means that a 100% Council Tax Premium will be applied and is payable in addition to the standard Council Tax liability, in respect of \"Second Home\" dwellings that meet the following conditions:\n\nthere is no resident of the dwelling (sole or main residence), and\n\nthe dwelling is substantially furnished.\n\nExceptions to the 100% Council Tax Premium can be considered if:\n\nDwellings are being marketed for sale - this exception is time-limited\n\nDwellings are being marketed for let - this exception is time-limited.\n\nVisit our exceptions page for more information and how to apply."
