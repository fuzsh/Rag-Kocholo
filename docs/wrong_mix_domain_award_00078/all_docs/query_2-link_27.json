        "text": "The Nobel Prizes (Swedish: Nobelpriset, Norwegian: Nobelprisen) are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institutet, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. An additional prize in memory of Alfred Nobel was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) for outstanding contributions to the field of economics. Each recipient, a Nobelist or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation.[2]\n\nPrize\n\nDifferent organisations are responsible for awarding the individual prizes; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics; the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature; the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.[2] In 1901, the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, equivalent to 10.8 million SEK in 2023. In 2017, the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9 million SEK.[4] The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\nIn years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize.[6] The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.[7]\n\nLaureates\n\nBetween 1901 and 2017, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 892 individuals (including 844 men, 48 women) and 24 organizations.[8] Six Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade four Germans, Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939) and Carl von Ossietzky (Peace, 1936) from accepting their Nobel Prizes. The Chinese government forbade Liu Xiaobo from accepting his Nobel Prize (Peace, 2010)[9] and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. Liu Xiaobo, Carl von Ossietzky and Aung San Suu Kyi were all awarded their Nobel Prize while in prison or detention.[10] Two Nobel laureates, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964) and Lê Ðức Thọ (Peace, 1973), declined the award; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors, and Thọ declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time.\n\nSeven laureates have received more than one prize; of the seven, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more than any other.[11] UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice, as was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless. Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field: Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry) and Linus Pauling (Chemistry and Peace). Among the 892 Nobel laureates, 48 have been women; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.[12] She was also the first person (male or female) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes, the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, given in 1911.[11]\n\nList of laureates\n\nlist of laureates Year Physics Chemistry Physiology\n\nor Medicine Literature Peace Economics\n\n(The Sveriges Riksbank Prize)[13][a] 1901 ;\n\n— 1902 ;\n\n;\n\n1903 ;\n\n;\n\n1904 ;\n\nInstitut de Droit International 1905 1906 ;\n\n1907 ;\n\n1908 ;\n\n;\n\n1909 ;\n\n;\n\nPaul Henri Balluet d'Estournelles de Constant 1910 International Peace Bureau 1911 ;\n\n1912 ;\n\n1913 1914 None None 1915 ;\n\nNone None 1916 None None None None 1917 None None ;\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross 1918 None None None 1919 None 1920 1921 None ;\n\n1922 ;\n\n1923 ;\n\nNone 1924 None None 1925 ;\n\nNone ;\n\n1926 ;\n\n1927 ;\n\n;\n\n1928 None 1929 ;\n\n;\n\n1930 1931 None ;\n\n;\n\n1932 ;\n\nNone 1933 ;\n\nNone 1934 None ;\n\n;\n\n1935 ;\n\nNone 1936 ;\n\n;\n\n1937 ;\n\n;\n\n1938 [b] Nansen International Office for Refugees 1939 ;[b]\n\n[b] None 1940 Cancelled due to World War II 1941 1942 1943 ;\n\nNone None 1944 ;\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross 1945 ;\n\n;\n\n1946 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1947 ;\n\n;\n\nFriends Service Council;\n\nAmerican Friends Service Committee 1948 None[c] 1949 ;\n\n1950 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1951 ;\n\n;\n\n1952 ;\n\n;\n\n1953 ;\n\n1954 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 1955 ;\n\nNone 1956 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nNone 1957 Yang Chen-Ning;\n\nThe Lord Todd 1958 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n[d] 1959 ;\n\n;\n\n1960 ;\n\n1961 ;\n\n1962 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1963 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross;\n\nLeague of Red Cross societies 1964 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n[e] 1965 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nUnited Nations International Children's Emergency Fund 1966 ;\n\n;\n\nNone 1967 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nNone 1968 ;\n\n;\n\n1969 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nInternational Labour Organization ;\n\n1970 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1971 1972 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nNone ;\n\n1973 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nLê Đức Thọ[f] 1974 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1975 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1976 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1977 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nAmnesty International ;\n\n1978 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1979 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1980 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1981 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 1982 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1983 ;\n\n1984 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1985 ;\n\n;\n\nInternational Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War 1986 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1987 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1988 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces 1989 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1990 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1991 ;\n\n1992 ;\n\n1993 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1994 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1995 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nPugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs 1996 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1997 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines;\n\n;\n\n1998 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1999 ;\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières 2000 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nGao Xingjian Kim Dae-jung ;\n\n2001 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nUnited Nations;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2002 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2003 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2004 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2005 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency;\n\n;\n\n2006 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nGrameen Bank 2007 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2008 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2009 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2010 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nLiu Xiaobo[g] ;\n\n;\n\n2011 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2012 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2013 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2014 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2015 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2016 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2017 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2018 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n[h] ;\n\n;\n\n2019 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2020 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nWorld Food Programme ;\n\n2021 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n2022 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nMemorial;\n\nCentre for Civil Liberties ;\n\n;\n\n2023 ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nYear Physics Chemistry Physiology\n\nor Medicine Literature Peace Economics\n\n50-year secrecy rule\n\nThe Committee neither informs the media nor the candidates themselves of the names of the nominees. Insofar as specific names frequently appear in the early predictions of who will receive the award in any given year, this is either pure speculation or inside information from the person or people who submitted the nomination. After fifty years, the database of nominations maintained by the Nobel Committee is made available to the public.[17] Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, states:\n\nA prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made.[18]\n\nSee also\n\nMain category: Lists of Nobel laureates\n\nList of Nobel laureates by country\n\nList of Nobel laureates by university affiliation\n\nList of female Nobel laureates\n\nList of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nList of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nList of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nList of female nominees for the Nobel Prize\n\nList of individuals nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nList of organizations nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSpecific\n\nGeneral"
