        "text": "This is a data analysis of supervisor-student relations throughout the history of science. I attempt to discover using data science who are the most important supervisors in history.\n\nBefore you go on, let me suggest you to write down a prediction of great scientists that you expect to find in this analysis. I bet most of you will be partly surprised with the results.\n\nData\n\nEvery project in data science consists of a problem to solve over some data. In this case our data set is fairly simple, so far it only contains relations between supervisors and students. For instance, we have a relation between Alfred Kleiner (supervisor) and Albert Einstein (student). In total, the data set has 7,070 unique people, with 6,517 students, 2,862 supervisors and 8,070 relations. Of course, many people are simultaneously supervisor and student.\n\nAll the data has been gathered from Wikipedia using simple scraping techniques. The data set contains all the people reachable from a pool of important people in science. The details are out of the scope of this post, and can be found on the github repository.\n\nI want to stress the fact that the data set has no personal information whatsoever about the individuals. These harmless relations will reveal very interesting information about the history of science. Stay tuned!\n\nBackground\n\nI will explain briefly a few concepts that we need to go on. If you don‚Äôt have any mathematical background ‚Äî baby don‚Äôt leave me ‚Äî I promise it will be simple. If you do have some previous background on the (ultra) basics of graph theory, I recommend you to skip this section. I will review the concepts that will be used later on.\n\nGraph theory is a field of mathematics that studies graphs (duh!). Graphs are clearly the structure that we are looking for in this case because graphs model relations. A graph is made of a set of nodes (people) connected by edges (supervisor-student relation).\n\nAs you might already be wondering, edges can connect nodes only in one direction (directed graphs) or in both directions (undirected graphs). For instance, supervising a student is represented by a unidirectional edge from the supervisor to the student. However, if we consider the supervisor-student relation to be connecting people that just know each other (e.g. social networks), then the edge connects the supervisor to the student and vice versa.\n\nWhy is this important at all? Well, a path between two nodes will be crucial for our analysis, and these two different structures allow completely different paths. Which one makes more sense for you to analyse our data?\n\nUndirected Graph\n\nFirst, we model the relations as an undirected graph. This decision has an important impact on the analysis, as it considers supervisors and students equally important.\n\nComponents\n\nA connected component in a graph is a subgraph where all the nodes are reachable from at least another node. Our graph has 84 connected components, but the largest component accounts for 95.81% of all the nodes. This is already quite impressive, since we gathered data from a pool of people from different fields (e.g. chemistry, computer science). This shows how all these fields have a common ancestor, which will prove to be the field of mathematics.\n\nDegree\n\nThe degree of a node ùë£ in an undirected graph is the number of edges that connect ùë£ with other nodes (i.e. the number of people connected to a particular person). This is the ranking of the first ten in terms of their degree:\n\n1 Arnold Sommerfeld: 44\n\n2 David Hilbert: 37\n\n3 Dimitris Bertsimas: 34\n\n4 Robert Solow: 30\n\n5 Max Born: 29\n\n6 Felix Klein: 28\n\n7 Alonzo Church: 27\n\n8 Franz Boas: 27\n\n9 Abdus Salam: 25\n\n10 J. J. Thomson: 24\n\nThis list is already interesting and probably you recognize some of them. Keep them in mind, as they will appear later. Besides the first ten, this is the degree distribution for all the nodes in the graph\n\nAs we can observe, most people are only connected to their supervisor and have a degree of one, while a few people have many connections. This is known as a power law distribution in statistics.\n\nBetweenness Centrality\n\nBetweenness centrality measures the centrality of a node ùë£, as the proportion of shortest paths from all pairs of nodes that pass through ùë£. In this case, we can use this measure of centrality to extract insights about the importance of people in the graph. If a node finds itself in the shortest path connecting other nodes then it is essential for that connection. The ranking:\n\n1 David Hilbert: 0.159\n\n2 Max Born: 0.152\n\n3 Hans Reichenbach: 0.121\n\n4 Arnold Sommerfeld: 0.120\n\n5 Hermann Helmholtz: 0.085\n\n6 E. H. Moore: 0.073\n\n7 J. J. Thomson: 0.071\n\n8 Solomon Lefschetz: 0.070\n\n9 John von Neumann: 0.058\n\n10 Ludwig Boltzmann: 0.055\n\nAll of them, except Hermann Helmholtz and John von Neumann, were born in the 19th century and died in the 20th century. Helmholtz almost made it alive to the 20th century, and von Neumann was born at the very beginning. They are so crucial in the graph (and in the history of science) because they are part of the generation that connects the greatest mathematicians from the 18th century with the greatest scientists of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThe award goes to David Hilbert!. Born in Germany, Hilbert was one of the most influential and universal mathematicians in history. Among Hilbert‚Äôs students we can find mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Haskell Curry.\n\nWe can also see Nobel laureate Max Born, German physicist and mathematician vital in the development of quantum mechanics. Among Born‚Äôs students we find the Nobel laureates Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Enrico Fermi and Max Delbr√ºck. Another of his students was Robert Oppenheimer, head of the Los Alamos Laboratory during the Manhattan Project, where the first atomic bomb was developed.\n\nGerman physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, pioneer in the field of quantum physics, is among the top two with the most students winners of a Nobel prize. We have already seen that Sommerfeld has the largest number of connections in our graph. Sommerfeld‚Äôs students include the Nobel laureates Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Hans Bethe, Peter Debye, Linus Pauling, Isidor Isaac Rabi and Max von Laue. In fact, Albert Einstein once told Sommerfeld that he admired how he pounded out of the soil such a large number of young talents. Sommerfeld is arguably the best supervisor in the history of science, famous for meeting with his students in his home or in cafes. Sommerfeld also owned a ski cabin where students were invited for discussions about physics. Something interesting is the fact that Sommerfeld never won a Nobel prize himself, even though he was nominated a record of 84 times.\n\nOn the other side, we also have British physicist and Nobel prize laureate J. J. Thomson, the only one who can compete with Sommerfeld in terms of students with a Nobel prize. Thomson, credited with the discovery of the electron, had among his students Nobel laureates Charles Glover Barkla, Niels Bohr, Max Born, William Henry Bragg, Owen Willans Richardson, Charles Thomson Rees Wilson, Francis William Aston and Ernest Rutherford. In fact, Thomson‚Äôs son (George Paget Thomson) won the 1937 Nobel Prize in physics, a feat only achieved as well by the Bragg‚Äôs, Bohr‚Äôs and Siegbahn‚Äôs.\n\nRussian mathematician Solomon Lefschetz, with fundamental work on algebraic topology and geometry, supervised John McCarthy, one of the founders of artificial intelligence, and John Tukey, an important figure in statistics.\n\nHermann von Helmholtz was a German physicist who made significant contributions in several fields such as human vision, electrodynamics and thermodynamics. Among his students we can find the Nobel laureates Albert Michelson, Wilhelm Wien, Max Planck and Gabriel Lippmann.\n\nFinally, on the list we can also find John von Neumann, Hungarian mathematician, physicist and computer scientist. Von Neumann is arguably one of the most intelligent people who have ever walked the Earth. He‚Äôs one of my favourite scientists of all time, so I can‚Äôt dare to describe his work briefly. I can only say, that if you don‚Äôt know him well, it is worth reading about him. Just for fun, open his Wikipedia page and find the section ‚ÄòKnown for‚Äô below his picture on the right.\n\nEigenvector Centrality\n\nEigenvector centrality is a different way of measuring centrality. In this case the importance of a node increases when it is related to another important node. This concept is similar to the one used by Google in its PageRank algorithm. Once again, the ranking:\n\n1 Arnold Sommerfeld: 0.578\n\n2 Max Born: 0.214\n\n3 Werner Heisenberg: 0.213\n\n4 Wolfgang Pauli: 0.162\n\n5 Hans Reichenbach: 0.158\n\n6 Rudolph E. Peierls: 0.154\n\n7 David Hilbert: 0.140\n\n8 Ferdinand von Lindemann: 0.119\n\n9 Gregor Wentzel: 0.110\n\n10 Linus Pauling: 0.109\n\nIf you happened to read the section on betweenness centrality, you are already familiar with most of the people on the list.\n\nIt is fascinating that with this measure of centrality we can find the importance of Arnold Sommerfeld without knowing anything about his students, just based on the nature of his descendants. Most of the people on the list are in fact directly related to Arnold Sommerfeld.\n\nThere are three scientists that we did not see in the previous measure of centrality. Rudolph Peierls, supervised by Werner Heisenberg; Ferdinand von Lindemann, supervisor of Arnold Sommerfeld and David Hilbert among others; and Gregor Wentzel, supervised by Arnold Sommerfeld.\n\nIt is surprising to see that J. J. Thomson, 13th on the list, is not among the top ten, since he supervised so many Nobel prize laureates.\n\nBridges\n\nA bridge is an edge whose deletion disconnects the graph. The number of bridge edges of a node gives us a good measure of how important the node is connecting different parts of the graph, which might be related to different fields. The ranking:\n\n1. Franz Boas: 25\n\n2. Robert Solow: 21\n\n3. Arnold Sommerfeld: 19\n\n4. Alonzo Church: 19\n\n5. David Hilbert: 18\n\n6. John Archibald Wheeler: 16\n\n7. Felix Klein: 15\n\n8. Salomon Bochner: 14\n\n9. Garrett Birkhoff: 13\n\n10. Richard Karp: 13\n\n11. John Tate: 13\n\n12. Elias Stein: 12\n\n13. Marvin Minsky: 12\n\n14. Noam Chomsky: 11\n\nOnce again, there are a lot of familiar faces, which is also a good indication that we are doing things right.\n\nFranz Boas is very interesting. He was a German anthropologist who supervised many students, becoming the backbone for that field. It might be surprising that an anthropologist is in the data set, however, we can trace Franz Boas back to Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner, a common ancestor for Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.\n\nAmerican economist and Nobel laureate Robert Solow is also an important node for the field of economics, with students such as the Nobel laureates George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz, Peter Diamond and William Nordhaus.\n\nOthers like Alonzo Church, Richard Karp or Marvin Minsky are crucial connections between the fields of mathematics and computer science, where the latest two have won the Turing Award.\n\nWe also find some other great mathematicians such as Salomon Bochner, Felix Klein, Garrett Birkhoff, John Tate and Elias Stein. Felix Klein is widely known for contributions in several different fields of mathematics. As an spoiler of what we will see at the end of this post, Felix Klein is part of a remarkable path of supervisor-students that starts with Lagrange and ends with John von Neumann.\n\nJohn Archibald Wheeler, an American physicist responsible for reviving interest in general relativity, was supervisor of Nobel laureates Richard Feynman and Kip Thorne.\n\nAt the very end of the list we come across Noam Chomsky, a pivotal connection between the fields of mathematics and linguistics. Chomsky is the only one together with Thorne that we have mentioned and are still alive today.\n\nDirected Graph\n\nNow, we change the model to an undirected graph, which attributes more importance to the supervisor than the student. Why are we doing this? Well, with this change we expect to find the founders of mathematics more relevant than the rest, simply because they are at the top of the genealogy tree.\n\nBetweenness Centrality\n\nWe are going to carry out the same analysis as we did with the undirected graph, so for a definition of this measure please refer to the previous section. The main difference with the previous analysis is that in this case paths are only valid in the direction from the supervisor to the student. The ranking (removing outliers):\n\n1 Joseph-Louis Lagrange: 0.002\n\n2 Leonhard Euler: 0.002\n\n3 Johann Bernoulli: 0.002\n\n4 Sim√©on Poisson: 0.001\n\n5 Felix Klein: 0.001\n\n6 Peter Dirichlet: 0.001\n\n9 Rudolf Lipschitz: 0.001\n\n10 Ferdinand von Lindemann: 0.001\n\n11 Carl Gauss: 0.001\n\nWhat a wonderful list, as satisfying as it gets. Indeed, we have found some of the founders of mathematics as we know it today. In this case, we have a mix of mathematicians born in the 18th and the 19th centuries.\n\nThese are some of the greatest mathematicians, and if you have any mathematical education, I‚Äôm sure you know most of their names. There are also many great early mathematicians missing and worth mentioning: Bernhard Riemann, Henri Poincar√©, Pierre de Fermat, Gottfried Leibniz, √âvariste Galois, Karl Weierstrass, Niels Abel, Carl Jacobi, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Joseph Fourier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to name a few.\n\nPaths\n\nIn graph theory, a path is a sequence of edges which connect a sequence of nodes. As promised in the sub-section ‚ÄòBridges‚Äô, there are some remarkable paths in this graph worth visualizing."
