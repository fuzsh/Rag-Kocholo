        "text": "Hailed as the winter equestrian capital of the world, Wellington is a bucolic paradise in Palm Beach County that grows exponentially in the winter monthsâor âseasonâ as it is known to the locals. All disciplines of equestrian sports compete here, from show jumping to polo, which makes this quiet little town a unique cultural melting pot where people from across the globe keep homes and show their beloved horses.Â\n\nDesigner Heather Weisz and her partner, Lisa Hynes, seized what they consider a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity when they were selected to transform part of a clientâs barn into a spectacular Bali-inspired retreat. To this day, the industrious duo behind HW Interiors continues to process the projectâs size, complexity, and amazing outcome. âWe consider ourselves so fortunate to have been involved in this endeavor,â says Weisz. âWe are beyond grateful for our amazing client who entrusted us with something this unusual and large in scope.â\n\nAn accomplished equestrian and wellness aficionado, their client was naturally drawn to this peaceful Wellington neighborhood. Its sprawling lots exceed five acres a piece, all with barns adjacent to their homes and plenty of wide-open space with trail access for riding. The main house boasts 4,500 square feet, but HWâs design focuses on the barn. Weisz and Hynes converted one third of it into 3,500 square feet of livable luxury play space while renovating the remaining two-thirds for the ownerâs horses, including two adorable Gypsy Vanners, Sugar Bear and Brown Sugar. âThe property itself has gorgeous mature landscaping,â says Hynes, âmaking it ideal for our client who values all aspects of health, wellness, and social connection.â\n\nThe homeownerâs primary goal was to make the space feel Balinese inspired, with a dedicated Zen yoga retreat, sauna, gym, lounge area, and outdoor cold plunge pool. Her intent was twofoldâan exercise space that overlooks the lush landscape, as well as a destination for friends and get-togethers. The design teamâs initial concept utilized this generous space to give their client the best possible layout to provide privacy for yoga and gym time, along with public areas to host large gatherings and take advantage of the lounge, kitchen, and pool table area. âWe applied an imported bamboo ceiling treatment along with earthy tones in the wood floors and quartzite island slabs and an organic live-edge shelving detail to transport visitors to a soothing luxury oasis upon stepping through the doors,â says Weisz.\n\nA long view into the yoga studio from the entrance reveals bespoke pecky cypress barn doors with custom brass inlaid handles and a stunning beaded chandelier from Africa. Two oversized living walls flank the opening, emulating the landscapeâs lavish growth and vivid natural colors. To keep the property in tune with its surroundings, the team installed oversized sliding glass doors to invite natural light and serene views inside from every vantage point. Working closely with Surfside Contracting, they brought the project to life, ensuring every detailâfrom the AC vents to the kerfed door jambs and baseboardsâfeels elevated and luxurious. âPersonally, Heather and I would have moved in if we could,â jokes Hynes. âThe place is a dream.â\n\nAs for the client, she is enjoying the space thoroughly, utilizing it for group yoga and meditation retreats and daily health and wellness. âWeâve also heard from her that those beautiful stone countertops are sturdy enough to hold several people dancing,â laughs Weisz, âso we know itâs getting plenty of use for entertaining.â\n\nStory Credits:\n\nInterior Design by Heather Weisz & Lisa Hynes, HW Interiors, Wellington, FL\n\nText by Jeanne de Lathouder Â\n\nPhotography by Jessica Glynn, Lantana, FL"
