        "text": "What is it?\n\nTeam Topologies is an approach to designing team-of-teams organizations for fast flow of value.\n\nThe approach is based on years of research across many organizations from different industries, different sizes and different technological backgrounds. It addresses the most dreaded challenges in technology:\n\nHow to maintain or even accelerate speed of value creation while scaling the organization?\n\nHow to evolve an architecture along with the evolution of the organization and avoid that one becomes a blocker for the other and a blocker for the growth of the business?\n\nThe approach provides a pattern language and a thinking model, which allows you to identify the team-of-teams design most appropriate for the target architecture and fast flow of value.\n\nWords of caution\n\nWe hear sometimes criticism that the approach doesn't explain how to map the whole organization and/or create a new organizational chart.\n\nTeam Topologies is an approach to thinking and identifying where business performance gets slowed down due to bad combination of processes, teams design and/or architecture. It helps you accelerate value creation.\n\nIf your focus is to design a new org chart, you should consider other methods.\n\nTeam Topologies will help you understand how real work happens and flows. Then the approach helps you use this knowledge to design the team-of-teams organization combining both business teams and technology teams.\n\nThere is no single part of the approach, which is more important than the others. If you only use one part, e.g. team types, you are unlikely to achieve much.\n\nFour fundamental topologies - with the flow of change\n\nThe flow of change is shown left-to-right. Stream-aligned teams own an entire slice of the business domain (or other flow) end-to-end. The Stream-aligned teams are “You Built It, You Run It” teams. There are no hand-offs to other teams for any purpose.\n\nThis diagram is a snapshot in time. The team relationships WILL change as new goals are set and the teams discover new things."
