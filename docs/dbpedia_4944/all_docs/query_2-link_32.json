        "text": "Most logos are distributed vector-based. There are several vector-based file formats, such as EPS, PDF, and SVG. Simple images such as logos will generally have a smaller file size than their rasterized JPG, PNG, or GIF equivalent. You can read more about Raster vs Vector on the vector-conversions.com.\n\nSVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-style markup-driven vector graphic rendering engine for the browser. Generally speaking, SVG offers a way to do full resolution graphical elements, no matter what size screen, what zoom level, or what resolution your user's device has.\n\nThere are several reasons why SVG is smart to store logo assets on your website or use it for print and paper collateral. Benefits including small file size, vector accuracy, W3C standards, and unlimited image scaling. Another benefit is compatibility — even if the facilities offered by SVG rendering engines may differ, the format is backward and forward compatible. SVG engines will render what they can and ignore the rest.\n\nHaving the Wellington Phoenix logo as an SVG document, you can drop it anywhere, scaling on the fly to whatever size it needs to be without incurring pixelation and loss of detail or taking up too much bandwidth.\n\nYou can download the Wellington Phoenix logotype in vector-based SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file format on this web page.\n\nAccording to wikipedia.org: \"A logo (an abbreviation of logotype, from Greek: λόγος, romanized: logos, lit. 'word' and Greek: τύπος, romanized: typos, lit. 'imprint') is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a wordmark.\"\n\nLogos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs are abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; Logotypes (or Wordmarks) depict the name or company's initials. Because logos are meant to represent companies brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to redesign logos frequently.\n\nA logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to an organization's communications. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation into a visual identity system is one of the most challenging and essential graphic design areas.\n\nAs a general rule, third parties may not use the Wellington Phoenix logo without permission given by the logo and (or) trademark owner A-League Men.
