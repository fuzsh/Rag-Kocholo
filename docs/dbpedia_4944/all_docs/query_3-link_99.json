        "text": "Ace\n\nAce is a colloquial abbreviation of asexual and/or aromantic. Often used as an umbrella term to cover the range of identities that fall under the ace spectrum, it is a term to refer to asexual people in a similar manner that ‘gay’ or ‘straight’ is used to refer to homosexual or heterosexual people. Ace also includes grey-asexual and demisexual people and recognises that asexuality is a spectrum.\n\nAgender\n\nSomeone who feels neutral towards their gender and rejects the influence of gender on their person. Sometimes the term non-gendered is used in a similar fashion.\n\nAromantic\n\nA person who experiences little to no romantic attraction but may experience sexual attraction towards others.\n\nAsexual\n\nA person who either does not, or does not often, experience sexual attraction but may experience romantic attraction towards others. This can also be used as an umbrella term, like ‘ace’, that encompasses a range of other ace spectrum identities.\n\nBisexual\n\nA person who is emotionally and sexually attracted to their own and other genders.\n\nCisgender\n\nPronounced as either ‘siz’ or ‘çiss’ — a person whose gender aligns with their sex assigned at birth.\n\nGay\n\nA person who is attracted to the same gender. This is more widely used by men than women and can be both a personal and community identity.\n\nGender\n\nGender is an individual’s internal sense of being a woman, a man, neither of these, both or somewhere along a spectrum. Gender is not fixed or unable to be changed.\n\nGender diverse\n\nA person who does not conform to their society or culture’s dominant gender roles.\n\nGender expression\n\nA person’s presentation of their gender through physical appearance (including dress, hairstyles, accessories, cosmetics), mannerisms, speech, behavioural patterns, names, and personal references. Gender expression may or may not conform to a person’s gender identity.\n\nGender identity\n\nGender identity is an individual’s sense of being a woman, a man, neither of these, both or somewhere along a spectrum.\n\nGenderfluid\n\nA non-binary gender that indicates shifting between different genders or presentations.\n\nHeterosexual\n\nA person who is sexually attracted to people of the other binary gender. Straight is an alternative term.\n\nHomosexual\n\nA person who is sexually attracted to people of the same gender. Alternative terms used are gay and lesbian.\n\nHijra\n\nA word used in the Indian subcontinent to describe intersex people, and transgender people. This community also use the words Kinnar or Kinner to describe themselves.\n\nIa\n\nIn te reo Māori, there is no gendered singular pronoun. Regardless of gender or sex, a person’s pronoun is ‘ia’.\n\nIntersex\n\nAn umbrella term used to describe people born with physical or biological sex characteristics (including sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, hormonal patterns and/or chromosomal patterns) that are more diverse than stereotypical definitions for male or female bodies. Like all people, intersex people may identify as male, female or non-binary and can have any sexual orientation.\n\nLGBTQIA+\n\nAn acronym which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer, Intersex, Asexual or Ace.

These concepts are more, or just as much, about familial, genealogical, social, and cultural selfhood. This is not an exhaustive list of Pacific peoples’ terms. These cultural and gender identities do not often have an equivalent in English language/terminology.\n\nPansexual\n\nA person who is attracted to people regardless of their gender.\n\nQueer\n\nHistorically used as a derogatory term for something/someone being different. This word has been reclaimed by some people as an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities who are not heterosexual or cisgender.

Heterosexual is an alternative term.\n\nTaahine\n\nTaahine is similar to mixed gender, sometimes non-binary, or transgender not-otherwise specified.
