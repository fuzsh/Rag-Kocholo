        "text": "In celebration of the 20th anniversary of Spring Drive, Grand Seiko presents a new design in its Sport Collection. The design draws its inspiration from the strength and power of the Grand Seiko lion, the mark that has long been the symbol of Grand Seiko. The lion mark was born together with the first Grand Seiko in 1960. It reflected the ambition of the Grand Seiko team to make a watch that was as precise, durable and beautiful as could be and revealed the intensity of their determination. They defined their goal as making the “king of watches”. So it was that the lion mark came to symbolize the inner strength of Grand Seiko and inspire its watchmakers to create the very best timepieces of which they were capable.\n\nThe case, which embodies the intense strength and dignity of lions, is angled inwards to ensure a soft fit on the wrist. The lug of the case looking like a lion's nail has a flat surface without distortion by Zaratsu polishing and hairline finish. The dial has a pattern representing the mane of the lion, which is the proof of the king of the beasts. A second hand with glide motion unique to the Spring Drive slides gracefully on the lion's mane.\n\nThis anniversary watch carry the lion symbol in the form of an 18k yellow gold insert in the oscillating weight, denoting the enhanced accuracy of the specially adjusted movement (+/-0.5 seconds a day).\n\nExterior\n\nCase Material : High-intensity titanium\n\nGlass Material : Dual-curved sapphire\n\nGlass Coating : Anti-reflective coating on inner surface\n\nLumi Brite : Lumibrite on hands, indexs and bezel\n\nCase size : Diameter 44.5mm × Thickness 16.8mm\n\nClasp type : Three-fold clasp with push button release\n\nMovement\n\nCaliber no. : 9R96 Instructions\n\nMovement Type : Spring Drive\n\nPower reserve : Approx. 72 hours(3 days)\n\nAccuracy : ±0.5 second per day (±10 seconds per month)\n\nFunctions"
