        "text": "Welcome!\n\nHi, and welcome to my website! Here you will find information about me, my skills, an annotated “portfolio” of sorts (keep scrolling!), and contact methods.\n\nI’m an experienced data & statistics professional who has found a niche in the football analysis world with high-quality analysis on almost every facet of the game—and from all corners of the world. I ensure that everything I make is tangible and tells a story. Football data only comes about from what happens on the pitch, so my visuals & analyses are all grounded and offer detailed insight into specific elements of a player, a team, or a match.\n\nIf you would like to contract any of my services, please reach out to me either through the contact form on this website or shoot me a DM on Twitter. Whether you work for a club, are an agent or a player, an online publication, or work elsewhere, get in touch; I’d love to chat with you!\n\nWho I’ve Worked With\n\nSample Analysis Capabilities\n\nBelow is a non-comprehensive look into what I can do (currently, as I’m always learning).\n\nPre- and Post-Match Analyses\n\nIndividual player analysis (single game or full season)\n\nTeam analysis (single game or full season)\n\nPlayer scouting\n\nMetric development (Passing Danger Index & Added Receiving Rate)\n\nAnd much more\n\nSelected Visuals & Descriptions\n\nPost-Match Analyses\n\nPre-Match Analyses\n\nIndividual Player Analysis\n\nTeam Analysis\n\nPlayer Scouting\n\nOne of the skills I’ve spent lots of time developing is using data and video to scout players: either to dive into a single player, or using data to scout for players. I have written my methods & examples up several times.\n\nExplanation of my method (LaLiga SmartBank as an example)\n\nUsing data to find 30+ young Serie C players\n\nScouting reports on Raimonds Krollis, Paul Tabinas, and Suphenat Mueanta\n\nFurther data analyses that are useful when scouting a player or scouting for players include scatter plots, moving average charts, similar player models, and much more. I use anything and everything at my disposal when researching players and particularly when analyzing a player’s strengths & areas to improve.\n\nI have also been developing a model to generate similar leagues and teams to one another, as well as finding a sample list of clubs in dynamic levels above/below a specific team. The method is explained in this article, with possible applications for a host of recruitment activities. The player performance dashboard below shows this in action in the 4 tables on the right.\n\nMetric Development\n\nI have a keen interest in finding new ways to analyze aspects of the sport, and play around with developing new metrics because of that. Two that I have created so far are a “Passing Danger Index” (PDI) and “Added Receiving Rate” (ARR).\n\n… And Much, Much More!\n\nI pride myself on being an expert at creating new ways to visualize data, and in particular ensure that I can merge tactics and data in unique but useful ways. I also make sure I know how to translate insights & findings from data into terms anybody can understand, regardless of what hat they wear in the sport.\n\nUseful data analyses are ones that are rooted in some tactical or other on-pitch concept. Without that real-world, actionable grounding, they are merely cute visualizations. I’m always playing with new ideas about how we can use data to increase our knowledge of the game, and then if used by a club, ensuring that work quickly and succinctly improves decision-making.\n\nAgain, if you would like to contract any of my services, please reach out to me either through the contact form on this website or shoot me a DM on Twitter.\n\nA few more examples of my work:"
