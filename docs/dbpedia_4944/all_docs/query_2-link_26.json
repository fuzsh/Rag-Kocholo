        "text": "Koru House\n\nWellington\n\nThe main colour scheme needed to be vibrant and engaging for children, but also work well in an office environment.\n\nThe Wellington District Child Protection Team is a multi agency unit that consists of staff from New Zealand Police, Child Youth and Family, Hutt Valley DHB, Relationship Services and agencies such as Barnados. The fit-out was designed to provide a unified workspace to better facilitate communication between agencies investigating child abuse, and supporting the families.\n\nIt was important that the look and feel of this facility didn't identify with any of the individual stakeholders to avoid any negative preconceptions the children and families may have. The main colour scheme needed to be vibrant and engaging for children, but also work well in an office environment.\n\nThe fit-out also provides the evidential child interview suites for the Wellington Region. Each suite consists of a family room, interview room and monitoring room located off separate corridors. To capture the imaginations of the children, and aid in way-finding, each suite was given a theme and an identifying colour scheme. For example, the toetoe suite had a beach theme, and has a blue feature wall, sand coloured feature carpet, and beach themed art created by a primary school aged child."
