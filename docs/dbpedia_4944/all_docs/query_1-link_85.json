        "text": "Background\n\nThe sine and cosine functions can be used to model fluctuations in temperature data throughout the year.\n\nAn equation that can be used to model these data is of the form: y = A cos B(x - C) + D, where A,B,C,D, are constants, y is the temperature in °C and x is the month (1–12).\n\nDirections\n\nYour task is to create a model of the data to predict the times during the year that a location would be pleasant to visit. This may be when the average monthly temperature is over 14°C.\n\nAbove is a table of average monthly temperatures at Wellington Airport from 1971-2000\n\nGraph this data.\n\nWrite a trigonometric equation using the cosine function that best models this situation.\n\nRewrite the equation using the sine function.\n\nFor which places would the sine function be a more obvious model for the temperature data?\n\nThe long-term average temperatures for Wellington were given above. Below is a table of mean monthly temperatures for Wellington Airport for the year 2000.\n\nGraph this data and write a trigonometric equation to model this data.\n\nExplain why this model does not fit as well as in the previous example.\n\nWhat features of the graph determine the values for A, B, C and D?\n\nInvestigate temperature data for other places.\n\nSolve the trigonometric equation derived above to find when the mean temperature will be over 14°C in Wellington.\n\nHow can the answer be checked on the graph?\n\nIs it sensible to convert the solution to months and days?\n\nInvestigate a model for rainfall data or relative humidity.\n\nHow do these models relate to the equation for temperature?\n\nTeacher Background\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo model a given situation, using trigonometry (including radian measure) to find and interpret measures in context, and evaluate findings. [M7.1] To find solutions, including the general solution, for trigonometric equations. [A8.15]\n\nNCEA: C3.3 Use Trigonometry to solve problems\n\nIn place of the Wellington data, local climate data can easily be substituted to make the activity more meaningful to students. Data can be obtained from: www.niwa.co.nz/edu/resources/climate/ (for New Zealand) www.worldclimate.com/climate/index.htm (for the world)\n\nLong-term averages: (top graph, below)\n\nThe model for the long-term averages is y = 4.2cos ((x - 1)π/6) + 13.7 Replace January to December with 1 to 12. Alternative form: y = 4.2sin((x + 1)π/6) + 13.7\n\nA = amplitude = (ymax - ymin)/2 B = 2π/12 C = units translated to the right D = ymin + amplitude = units translated up\n\nTo graph using Excel: x-values 1 - 12y-values for the cosine curve rounded to one decimal place use =ROUND(4.2*COS(((cell name-1)*PI())/6) + 13.7,1).\n\nWellington Temperatures 2000: (bottom graph, above)\n\nThe model for the Wellington 2000 Temperatures can be either: y = 3.75cos ((x - 2)π/6) + 14.05 or y = 3.75cos ((x - 1)π/6) + 14.05 Replace January to December with 1 to 12.\n\nThe long-term average reduces the impact of one-off, very extreme events.\n\nThe climate model does not fit this data as well because of random climate variability.\n\nTo find when the temperature will exceed 14°C, substitute 14 for y in the equation. 4.2cos ((x - 1)π/6) + 13.7 = 14 4.2cos ((x - 1)π/6) = 0.3 cos ((x - 1)π/6) = 0.07143 (x - 1)π/6 = 1.4993 x - 1 = 2.8635 x = 3.8635\n\nThe general solution is x = 2nπ ± 3.8635 giving 3.86 or 10.15 i.e. the temperature will be above 14°C from the end of April to early October. Draw the line y = 14 on the graph and read off points of intersection.\n\nResource prepared by Lesley Mackintosh RSNZ Teacher Fellow 2001, NIWA\n\nRelated links"
