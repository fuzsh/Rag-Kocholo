        "text": "“Wade is a world class coach and one of his biggest strengths is how he brings his breadth of experience / disciplines into the coaching environment. He builds a highly motivating coaching environment that is ambitious, supportive and fun. Helping me transition into my first Chief Executive role, Wade helped me get really clear on my foundational strengths, support and challenge me to tackle a different mindset where I needed to and always kept high performance at the heart of all our discussions. He could easily navigate coaching for me for my development while also seamlessly coaching me on team challenges and performance development. Experience in improv means what could have been quite tough sessions were actually a lot of fun and not all coaching environments can claim that balance between fun, ambition and support.”\n\n“The Jolt Challenge program has helped me become more self-aware. It helped at a time when I was overwhelmed and incredibly stressed out. With the help and guidance from Wade, I feel calm and capable of not letting myself get to that point again. It is a journey which never ends and Wade I know will be there if I ever need help in the future. That is something special and selfless that he provides as he truly believes in helping you be a better person. Thank you Wade!”\n\n\"Wade Jackson was my executive coach for almost 1.5 years. As a result of working with Wade I went from feeling like an imposter, worrying about what others thought, to feeling incredibly confident in my own skin. He has allowed the real me to emerge so that I’m now able to deliver and be all the things that I was always capable of, but hadn’t previously managed to tap into and access. He has helped me create an amazing toolbox that I can use at any time - to manage my energy, deal with the pressures at work and home, and communicate effectively to the board, my peers and my team. I know my strengths and play to them. The feedback I’ve received from colleagues and stakeholders tells me that’s what they always wanted. If you’re looking to be all that you can be, you can’t go past Wade Jackson.\"\n\n\"The 10-week Jolt Challenge program is an exceptional and accurately billed self-intelligence program. I gained so much from it and really appreciated Wade’s intelligence, how well he listens, and the kindness and humour he brings to the coaching relationship. Committing to the program brings the results as it’s a double whammy of well-researched theory harnessed to practical exercises and tools. I undertook the program at a time when I was feeling really stuck and stressed. As the course progressed, I re-connected with myself and have subsequently made big strides in challenging myself professionally, personally and creatively.”\n\n\"Wade Jackson was my coach for a period of 10-months. At the time, my business was growing in size but making less money, I had no work/life balance, wasn’t exercising, was drinking 6 to 8 beers a night before dinner and smoking marijuana to help me get to sleep at night as I was feeling very overwhelmed. After working with Wade I became a better person, a better leader and better dad to my two girls. He gave me the tools and understanding that changed everything. I started exercising regularly, cut my drinking right down and stopped smoking completely. I shrunk my business but it's back to being profitable and now I have quality family time. I am so stoked. Wade changed my life.\"\n\n\"I have worked with Wade for over two years within some challenging conditions both personally and professionally. In this time I have utilised Wade as a coach, completed his story telling training course (which is amazing) and even attempted to shine within his comedy improv corporate challenge. In this time Wade has continually challenged myself to get uncomfortable, continue to grow as a leader and simply as a better person, father and husband. Wade has helped myself create some long term change, disciplines that ensure I am more balanced in my approach at work and at home. Tools that create real change, space and balance. I would highly recommend working with Wade to anyone who is committed to continuous improvement, becoming a more effective leader and being uncomfortable.”"
