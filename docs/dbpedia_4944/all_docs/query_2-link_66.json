        "text": "Wellington Medical Centre – Your information, what you need to know\n\n(If you want to speak to us about your data, please see our ‘contact’ page)\n\nThis notice describes why we collect information about you, how your information will be used and your rights in respect of your data.\n\nWhy we collect information about you\n\nYour records are used to ensure you get the best possible care. Your information helps them to make the best decisions about your care and helps provide you with proactive advice and guidance. Important information is also collected to help us to remind you about specific treatment which you might need, such as health checks, immunisations for children and reminders for screening appointments. We work with other NHS services to co-ordinate these.\n\nInformation held about you may be used to help protect the health of the public and to help us to improve NHS services. Information may be used within the GP practice to monitor the quality of the service provided (known as ‘clinical audit’).\n\nWhat data do we collect and receive about you?\n\nRecords are stored electronically and on paper and include personal details about you such as your address, carers, legal representatives, emergency contact details, as well as:\n\nAny appointments, visits, emergency appointments\n\nNotes and reports about your health\n\nDetails about your diagnosis, treatment and care\n\nDetails about any medication you are taking\n\nResults of investigations such as laboratory tests, x-rays\n\nRelevant information from health and care professionals, relatives or carers\n\nWe also receive information from other organisations that are caring for you that we hold in your record. This will include letters and test results.\n\nHow we use your information: For providing your care\n\nPrescriptions\n\nWhere you have agreed we will send information on your prescriptions to pharmacies, either by electronic systems or by paper.\n\nTest requests and results\n\nWhere we undertake tests on you, such as blood tests, we will send the sample and details of the tests we are requesting to the most appropriate pathology laboratory. The data shared with the laboratory will include your NHS number, name, the type of test requested and any health information relevant to doing the test and producing the result or report. We will receive the test results back from the laboratory electronically and these will be stored in your patient record.\n\nExtended services and out of hours\n\nWe work closely with neighbouring practices and ‘out of hours’ providers including NHS 111 to ensure that if you need care from a doctor outside of normal hours that they have access to your records when needed to give you the best possible care. This may be delivered over the phone or via video consultation as appropriate. Services may be run by ‘GP Federations’ and ‘Primary Care Networks’.\n\nPatient referrals\n\nWith your agreement, your GP or Nurse may refer you to other services not provided by the practice, or they may work with other services to provide your care in the practice. Information will be shared by letters, emails and shared record systems.\n\nOnce you have been seen, the other care agency will tell us about the treatment they have provided for you and any support which your GP needs to provide. This information is then included in your record. Referrals can be to lots of different services, such as smoking cessation services, social prescribers, voluntary services and other health and care agencies, as appropriate, for your care.\n\nHospital, Community or Social Care Services\n\nSometimes the staff caring for you need to share some of your information with others who are also supporting you. This could include hospital or community based specialists, nurses, health visitors, therapists or social care services. Information will be shared to organisations where you receive care, whether that is local or further away, if you need specialist care or emergency care in another.\n\nShared computer systems\n\nHealth and Social care services are developing shared systems to share data efficiently and quickly. It is important for anyone treating you to be able to access your shared record so that they have all the information they need to care for you. This will be during your routine appointments and also in urgent situations such as going to A&E, calling 111 or going to an Out of hours appointment. It is also quicker for staff to access a shared record than to try to contact other staff by phone or email.\n\nOnly authorised staff can access the systems and the information they see is carefully checked so that it relates to their job. Systems do not share all your data, just data which services have agreed is necessary to include.\n\nFor more information about shared care records, please visit: The SIDeR Website\n\nClinical Digital Tools\n\nWe also use a range of digital tools to support improved patient care. These digital tools may relate to very specific conditions and use of them supports diagnosis, clinical decision making, prescribing and management of a condition. Often these digital tools are developed and managed by third parties who are contracted by the NHS for the provision of this very specific work to ensure best patient care. Your information may be shared with these organisations where it is relevant to your care.\n\nSafeguarding of children or vulnerable adults\n\nIf we have significant concerns or hear about an individual child or vulnerable adult being at risk of harm, we may share relevant information with other organisations, such as local authorities and the Police, involved in ensuring their safety.\n\nEnsuring medicines work well\n\nWe work with the local Medicines Management team of the Clinical Commissioning Group to help get the best out of medicines for patients and ensure they are effective in managing conditions. This generally uses anonymous data, but occasionally they will assist in reviews of medication for patients with complex needs. Doctors may also seek advice and guidance on prescribing queries.\n\nIdentifying health risks\n\nSystems known as ‘risk stratification tools’ are used to help determine a person’s risk of suffering particular conditions and enable us to focus on preventing ill health before it develops. Information in these systems comes from a number of sources, such as hospitals and the practice. This can help us identify and offer you additional services to improve your health.\n\nMulti-disciplinary team meetings\n\nFor some long term conditions, such as diabetes, the practice participates in meetings with staff from other agencies involved in providing care, to help plan the best way to provide care to patients with these conditions.\n\nNational Services (including screening programmes)\n\nThere are some national services like National Diabetes Audit and the National Cancer Screening Programmes that collect and keep information from across the NHS. This is how the NHS knows when to contact you about services like cervical, breast or bowel cancer screening.\n\nYou can find out more about how the NHS holds and shares your information for national programmes on the NHS Screening Website. Please visit: NHS Screening Website\n\nData may also be shared on anyone who contracts a ‘communicable disease’, such as Covid 19, in order to manage public health and safety.\n\nHow we use your information: beyond providing your care\n\nThe information collected about you when you use our services can also be used and provided to other organisations for purposes beyond your individual care, for instance to help with:\n\nimproving the quality and standards of care\n\nresearch into the development of new treatments\n\npreventing illness and diseases\n\nmonitoring safety\n\nplanning new services\n\npublic health screening\n\nassisting the Care Quality Commission with any investigations\n\ninvestigating fraud\n\nWherever possible data used for these purposes is anonymised so that you cannot be identified. If information cannot be completely anonymous, then this may only take place when the law allows the information to be used. All these uses help to provide better health and care for you, your family and future generations.\n\nStatutory disclosures\n\nSometimes we are duty bound by laws to disclose information to organisations such as the Care Quality Commission, the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency, the General Medical Council, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and Counter Fraud services. In these circumstances we will always try to inform you before we are required to disclose and we only disclose the minimum information that the law requires us to do so.\n\nObjecting to the of use of data for purposes beyond your care\n\nThe NHS Constitution states ‘You have a right to request that your personal and confidential information is not used beyond your own care and treatment and to have your objections considered’. For further information please visit: The NHS Constitution Website\n\nNational data opt-out\n\nThe national data opt-out enables patients to opt-out from the use of their personal confidential data for research or planning purposes. To find out more or to register to opt out, please visit: NHS Your Data Matters Website\n\nIf you have any concerns about use of your data not covered by the National Data Opt out, please contact the practice.\n\nHow long do we hold information for?\n\nRecords are kept for the lifetime of the patient. If you move to a new practice, your record will be transferred. If the practice you have left need to access your record, for example to deal with a historic complaint, they will let you know. When information has been identified for destruction or deletion it will be disposed of using approved confidential disposal procedures.\n\nYour rights:\n\nData Protection laws give you a number of rights, including access to your data, correction, erasure, objection and restriction of use of your data. Details on how to request access to your data are set out below. If you have any concerns about the accuracy and use of your records, please contact us.\n\nRight of Access to your information (Subject Access Request)\n\nYou have the right to have a copy of the information we hold about you.
