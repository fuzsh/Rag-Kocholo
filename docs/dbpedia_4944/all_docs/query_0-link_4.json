        "text": "AWARD-WINNING\n\nEquestrian Logo Design\n\nLive A Beautifully Branded Equestrian Lifestyle™\n\nTHE POWER OF CONNECTION\n\nRiders and horse enthusiasts come to us looking to express their connection to horses through custom illustration. Hundreds of connections have already happened by the time we hear from you.\n\nOne horse, two horse, three horses; ten. It's brilliant to know we can embody the legacy of all your equestrian connections into one custom image. That's why you are here and that's why we are here for you.\n\nCustom Equestrian Logo Design is the First Connection we will make together. After that, while you are of course free to take your files and use them wherever you choose, we encourage you to take advantage of our knowledge of your new equestrian brand. From farm signs, business cards, websites and rider wear; we will know you well enough to guide you through the wonderful world of SP RHODES and connect you to our other products and services..\n\nOur illustration team is North America based and professional. Graduate-level art education is a pre-requisite. Our designers study horse conformation and have access to a full team of equine experts to consult on both discipline- and breed-specific details. If you are breeding Arabian horses, we will understand the definition of jibbah. If you are selling hunters, we understand the value of square knees, an attractive head and a beautiful bascule.\n\nEquestrian logo design is unique in that logos need to be designed with end-use in mind. That means the illustration team you hire needs to be forward-thinking in how they approach basic design principles. Not all logo designs are suitable for embroidery. All equestrians need logos that suit their use.\n\nAn equestrian logo design is only as good as your ability to use it. Our specialty here at SP RHODES are logos built for utility.\n\nWe use a proprietary logo questionnaire to know you better. What you like, what you don’t like, your style and how you live your equestrian lifestyle. Our specialty is piecing together the information you provide and assembling it into intelligent illustrations. Our proprietary logo questionnaire purpose-built to gather the information we need for a successful result.\n\nAsking the right questions is a uniquely powerful tool for unlocking valuable information. The right questions spur learning and the exchange of ideas. They also build rapport and trust. A psychology-based approach to asking the right questions has been the magic formula to our development of beautiful and useful equestrian logos\n\nOnce you submit your logo questionnaire, you will be assigned a professional designer. You can call, email, text or contact your designer whenever you need to.\n\nTogether, you will collaborate and get to know one another. You will engage in a feedback process that results in a final logo version you love.\n\nNow that our team knows your design aesthetic well, you can consider working with your personal design assistant on a farm sign, rider wear or other branded products. No need to explain what you like, don’t like or your color scheme. Although there is no obligation to use your logo on our products or for additional services, we can assure you that living a beautifully branded equestrian lifestyle is much easier when working with a team who already understand your intentions.\n\nWe communicate frequently, are easily accessible and will always reply to your emails. If for some reason you can’t get in touch via email we have three different chat resources you can connect with – Facebook, our online chat and Skype. While we do our part to be full participants in your logo design process, we ask the same of you. Our logo design contract will be signed before we proceed and all expectations, timelines and costs will be outlined with transparency in an easy-to-read format.\n\nMany of our equestrian logo customers have other businesses outside of horses. Construction logos, real estate logos, apparel companies, veterinarians, medical practices and more. If you are looking for a business logo that will be unique and original, send us a message.\n\nHOW ARE WE QUALIFIED?\n\nWE ATTRACT TALENT - WE KNOW HORSES - WE ARE AWARD WINNING\n\nOur lead designers boast education from the Paris College of Art and OCAD University; two top tier art schools that have a legacy of producing quality talent. A respect for the arts and a love for all things equine is the perfect pairing. The result is always beautiful designs and accurate representations.\n\nOur graphic design and illustration team was recognized with a bronze award amongst a field of highly-skilled marketing agencies for our work in the companion animal and pharmaceutical space.\n\nLive A Beautifully Branded Equestrian Lifestyle™\n\nEquestrian logo design to suit any style preference. Hand-illustrated, entirely unique and a collaborative process that involves you in the creation of your new equestrian brand.\n\nLOGO PACKAGE OPTIONS\n\nTier 1: $990\n\n60% deposit due to start\n\nThis level of service is suitable if you have a small private farm or average size boarding facility.
