        "text": "Name: Phazmun\n\nRace: Azure Dragonborn\n\nPhysical Description: Phazmun stands well over 8 feet tall, maw to tail. His sturdy build is accustomed to life on the sea, and is beset by scales that the centuries may have dulled, but swirling throughout one can still see the deep blue patterns of his people. His white slitted eyes may seem intimidating considering his tendency to barely blink, but usually he is just thinking about food, the stars, or the latest tune - it takes a lot to get under someone's skin when they've looked an angry seagod in the eye, after all.\n\nGeneral Backstory: Phazmun is a skilled but gruff navigator. His most valued possessions ever since he was a little hatchling were maps and journals and compasses, a result of a lifetime of travel. First with his merchant parents, then in various sailing crews, and now, captured by pirates. Throughout it all, his heart was aimed stoically at the greatest prize of his people: the Azure Heart. The Azure Dragonborn are a people from the sunken island of Drokkaris. Once a magical volcano-island that freely travelled the seven seas, Drokkaris was powered by a collossal magical flame known as the Azure Heart. It gifted its people long and healthy lives, and the power to forge magical artifacts that were renowned the world over. But it was also a beacon, attracting terrible forces from the abyss. One fateful night a massive leviathan creature attacked, a vengeful seagod that doomed Drokkaris to the deep dark locker, and the Azure Heart was extinguished. What few Dragonborn survived have built up a new life in the centuries since, roaming the oceans and isles and harbors as artisans, guards, merchants, labor hands, and, occasionally, as pirates. A scattered and wistful people, but never aimless. For the whispers of their Azure Heart can yet be heard...\n\nSpecial Abilities: Heightened strength, amphibious, navigation, sparkly mist breath attack, knowledge of recent history.\n\nPersonal Goal: Phazmun wants to uncover the truth behind the Sinking of Drokkaris and the Azure Heart. He eagerly awaits the coming Remembrance Festival, held each century at the last remembered location of Drokkaris at sea.\n\nSpeech color: 7FFFD4\n\nTheme song: Echoes (Sunken Treasures DLC) | Anno 1800 (OST) | Steffen Brinkmann, Orchestra: HSSO (Ubisoft Music, YouTube)\n\nImage source/face claim: Mohamed Hamaki - Header font source: Creattion, on 1001Fonts\n\nHeight: 5' 9\" / 176cm - Weight: 180lbs / 82kg - Hair Colour: Dark Brown - Eye Colour: Brown\n\nName: Kais Zenix\n\nAlias: Al-Shihab (The Meteor), @ASZenix (media handle)\n\nTeam: Al-Saqr Racing - Arabic League\n\nGender: Male\n\nAge: 36\n\nPersonality: Kais is one of the most grating personalities in the AG racing sphere. His supersoldier genetics and paramilitary past has left him with a more than healthy sprinkling of assertiveness, an unhealthy sprinkling of wartime baggage, and a lack of tolerance for bullshit, specifically yours. Though he has a stoic exterior, he is quick to push back against people whom he feels behave with undeserved conceit and hostility, and dislikes a soft touch, preferring to attack problems directly and decisively. It is an open secret that his social media handle is handled by an assistant for damage control, as his guest appearances and fan interactions can sometimes end in interesting exchanges. That said, when you find yourself on his good side (which, disclaimer: isn't the easiest thing to do), he'll go through literal hellfire and back for you.\n\nHe himself is plagued by his past and attitude as much as others are, even though he’ll never admit it even to himself. Kais is a man lost in this world at peace, a world of excess, of profilicity and emblazoned vulnerability. It is likely he turned to racing for exactly this reason: to reconnect with those primal parts of him that drive for competence and strength, to find an outlet for those things he buries and hides behind an emotional shield-wall, and to dance with death once more, and this time, to win.\n\nBackstory: Kais Zenix (original serial name classified and unknown to the public) is one of the genetic test-tube supersoldiers bred by the Masdar al-Nuba, or the ‘Nubian Source’, a paramilitary group operating in Egypt against the Arabic League and its allies in its formative years. Framed as a conflict over water rights and influence in the region, not much is publicly known about them or their true motives to this day, and there wasn’t much post-war interest either, as their fate was the same of most fractured rebel factions in the region at the time: they were defeated and relegated to the ash heap of history, the region unified into the League, end of story. Until a short time ago, that is, when one of their former supersoldiers entered the League’s AG racing team of Al-Saqr.\n\nAfter his time in the paramilitary group and their defeat, he has been through a thorough rehabilitation and therapy regimen, which continues to this day through personal debriefings and psych evals. These included some of the experimental neural stimulation techniques that led to none other than the very ones AG pilots now use to train. These racing-themed stress-response simulations were actually his first forays into the world of AG racing, one he has since entered for real. That said, his training doesn't always take hold as much as his managers would like. Indeed, his nickname 'The Meteor' comes from one of his first races, in which he pushed his ship so far it burst into flames. But is burning out in a short blaze of glory all that is to him?\n\nRacing DNA\n\nOverview: Kais is a ruthless racer owing to his supersoldier heritage, and you’d easily assume he was bred with a borderline death wish (which may or may not actually be true). He pushes his ship to the absolute brink to compensate for Al-Saqr's comparatively subpar antigrav arrays, and seems to have made it his mission to find every way to skirt the rules. This might yield him a few milliseconds of an advantage, but has also more than once resulted in significant damage to both himself and his ship, alongside an angry pit crew, angry fellow racers, angry team members, angry fans, and angry management. He doesn't care. All's fair in love and war, after all.\n\nSkills: Kais is a fighter, in more ways than one. Sure, he is proficient in piloting, firearms, hand-to-hand, mindset control, but he also likes debating, and reads a lot to form an understanding of this strange new world he finds himself in. He enjoys learning new languages, especially of those countries he visits, and he volunteers at a cat shelter - originally a publicity stunt to show his 'soft side', he has started to enjoy it more than he admits.\n\nSpecial Trait: being bred as a supersoldier, he has above average complex reflex loops to get him out of a pinch, but that sometimes result in questionable aggressive racing behavior without much conscious input. He was born with about 1.5x of most critical organs and circulatory systems to serve as backup, allowing him to absorb more force and damage (and alcohol) without much issue or thought, but at the cost of having a borderline overconfidence, and a slow but sure accumulation of cellular damage.\n\nControversy: His mysterious and warlike past often spark questions, both from outside of the team and within, about his morality and the lengths to which he might go to attain victory, as well as the reason for management to have included him in the team to begin with, some of which speculations include blackmail, infiltration and conspiracy. Whatever might be the case, it is undeniable his appearances draw viewers and social media engagement for the team, though not always in the most positive light.\n\nMISC\n\nSpeech Color: f7941d\n\nTheme Song: Bayek of Siwa, Assassin's Creed Origins OST - Sarah Schachner\n\nLikes: learning languages, cats, cool new gadgets, worthy opponents, getting apologies.\n\nDislikes: corpo-speak, monotonicity, arrogance from those he thinks are undeserving.\n\nOther Information: he collects obscure old-world memorabilia including paintings, books and cassette tapes. His signature move has become known as the 'meteor strike'. He has tattooed his body's collection of scars with otherwise invisible UV-ink, including the dates, causes and significance of each, chronicling his supersoldier-to-racer journey."
