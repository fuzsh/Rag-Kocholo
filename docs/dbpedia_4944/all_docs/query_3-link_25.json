        "text": "The Center for Climate and Security (CCS), with support from the U.S. Mission to New Zealand, called upon young people across Aotearoa New Zealand, Niue, the Cook Islands, and the United States to share their perspectives on working towards a better future by building a climate-secure Pacific. We are proud to present a video showcasing the many unique climate security stories from our applicants. These videos highlight personal testimonies and recommendations for addressing challenges driven by climate change.\n\nYoung Leaders\n\nStaff\n\n(Now Closed) Video Submission Information:\n\nBackground\n\nClimate change increasingly risks Pacific security and sovereignty on land and sea due to sea level rise, a warming ocean, disaster, and displacement. These challenges are no longer the problems of the future– they are some of the largest risks of today. Addressing these challenges in the Pacific will require understanding and partnership between the leaders of today and the leaders of tomorrow. In building toward a better future, we are calling for perspectives from young people from Aotearoa New Zealand, Niue, the Cook Islands, and the United States on addressing interconnected climate and security challenges.\n\nThe Center for Climate and Security, with support from the U.S. Mission to New Zealand, is launching a call for video applications that answer the question: “What is your vision of a climate-secure Pacific?” Selected videos will be showcased as a part of a social media campaign and 6-8 winners will be invited on a fully-funded three-day trip to Wellington, New Zealand where they will have the chance to meet with policymakers, organizations, and community groups working on these issues and present their visions of a positive future. If you are selected, this program will help to build your public voice on climate risks and solutions and catalyze relationships between you and other like-minded young people around the world.\n\nHow to submit\n\nVideo submissions will be collected using this Google Form. To submit your video, you will need to first upload it to Google Drive. Instructions for uploading and sharing a video on Google Drive can be found here. Please ensure that the video can be accessed by anyone with the video link, or we may not be able to review your submission.\n\nVideo submission guidelines\n\nEnglish Language or Subtitles. You are welcome to speak in any language, but if the language you speak is not English, please be sure to include English subtitles.\n\nNo logos. Please ensure that no corporate or copyrighted logos or imagery are visible in your recording. We will be unable to use videos containing such content.\n\nDo a sound check. Limit as much unnecessary background noise as possible and hang a blanket up in rooms that tend to echo to cut back on feedback.\n\nNo music. Please ensure that no music is used in the video. Any submissions using licensed music will not be used.\n\nEnsure photo permissions. If you will be using photos in your video, ensure that they are your own photos or you have the appropriate permissions for use. When necessary, place any photo credits in the top right corner of the video.\n\nGraphs, Charts and Data. When using graphs or charts to illustrate data make sure the source is included in the image. If the source is not already included, please put the source in the top right corner of the video.\n\nVoice overlay. Any portion of the video consisting of a slideshow or gallery must be accompanied by a voice overlay that describes what’s being shown.\n\nCheck your file settings before you shoot. Make sure that in your phone, laptop, or camera settings you’re shooting in HD (1080p or higher) and in a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio.\n\nShoot horizontally. Shooting sideways will ensure your video fits in nicely with other submissions. See below for how you should set up your phone or camera while filming.\n\nUse natural lighting when possible. However, if you can’t, you can use the lights in your house to create a three-point lighting setup.\n\nDon’t let yourself be backlit. Use a window as a light source instead of a background. The subject of your video should always be brighter than what’s behind it.\n\nMake sure your camera is at or above eye level. This will provide a more flattering angle than if you’re looking down at your laptop or phone. Try to have your eyes level on the upper horizontal line using the rule of thirds to look like a pro.\n\nPay attention to the background. White walls are fine but a little boring. Shooting your video with some open space behind you can add nice depth to your shot while giving the audience a peek into your personality. Shooting outdoors is also encouraged, just be sure to check that your audio can be heard clearly.\n\nNatural scenery. ​​Please illustrate your climate security issue by capturing videos or images of your local environment.\n\nAdditional considerations\n\nA unique setting. How can you showcase your community or specific climate impacts through the video location? How will the location captivate the audience? Note: we’d love to see innovative settings, but please ensure your voice remains audible. If you’re not able to film on location, photos with a voice overlay may also be compelling.\n\nRelevance to the Pacific. How does your experience relate to climate security challenges in the Pacific and a possible approach to solutions?\n\nGlobal relationships. What elements of your story are shared with other parts of the world? What opportunities exist for cooperation across the Pacific?\n\nClarity. How can you communicate a strong message and compelling call to action in a short video message?\n\nCreativity. We want to hear your voice and experience showcased in a creative and compelling way.\n\nWatch examples. View videos from previous winners, Michelle Ramirez and Marieke Jacobs/ Ytze de Vriesto, to see examples of well-done, high-quality video submissions from other regions.\n\nDisclosure"
