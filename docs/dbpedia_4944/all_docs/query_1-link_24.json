        "text": "We will not be exchanging gifts of tin, aluminium, or diamond jewellery with Atlassian (the relationship is far from exclusive!) but that has not stopped TechTime team in recognising an important milestone this year - 10 years as a member of the Atlassian Partner Program.\n\nWhat are we celebrating?\n\nTechTime Initiative Group, founded in 2005, are experts in a growing sector of the IT industry aimed at collaboration and productivity software. In 2009, based on the strength and popularity of the TechTime's software products listed on Atlassian Marketplace, TechTime has been invited to join the Partner Program of Atlassian, an Australian enterprise software company that develops products for content management, help desk management, planning projects, and software development â€“ to better leverage the suite of Atlassian software products to deliver enterprise solutions, managed services, software development services and training to industry-leading companies around the world. By now, TechTime has achieved a Platinum Solution Partner status in the Solution Partner program and is the only company in New Zealand to deliver official Atlassian training (check out the courses available at www.techtime.co.nz/training ). To add to our achievements, TechTime is also recognised as a Top Vendor on the Atlassian Marketplace which is a testimony to the plethora of available for integration with Atlassian software. TechTime's long history with Atlassian, in combination with their commitment to development, propel their desire for continuous improvement and innovation.\n\nHow are we celebrating?\n\nThis milestone had to be marked with a t-shirt!\n\nAfter a barrage of ideas, many enthusiastic discussions, and tireless work from Irina Maksimova creating mockups we finally agreed on a design. The TechTime logo features on the front of the T-shirt with '1010' pattern representing the 10-year milestone (in binary) in one of our company colours. We kept the design on the back the same as our previous T-shirts, which was, of course, a deliberate decision and not at all influenced by the deadline for printing .\n\nThese limited-run T-shirts were available at Atlassian Summit conference in April 2019, in Las Vegas, USA and will be available at Atlassian Open in September 2019, in Vienna, Austria.\n\nBooth 302 at Atlassian Summit 2019\n\nThe team also enjoyed an afternoon of 10-pin bowling with some unexpected talent interspaced with dramatic displays and honest attempts. Team members threw gutter balls, spares, strikes, and one member managed to throw their\n\nOur third milestone marker is all about charity ... almost. Kitten Inn, a local cat and kitten rescue organisation has an innovative fundraising method. They bring kittens into workplaces for a cuddle and play fest. (Most of) our team thinks this is a great way to give back while getting some in-office stress relief. Keep an eye on our blog for photos.\n\nWhat makes TechTime worth celebrating?\n\nTechTime, initially set up by the experienced industry partnership of Irina Mosina and Ed Letifov, is a deliberately small and yet cutting-edge presence operating locally, nationally and globally. The 12-strong team, containing developers, instructors, sales administrators, and technical support, have Atlassian accreditation, certifications, and experience in all aspects of Atlassian products. With their support, training and know-how, they help organisations unleash the full potential of their Atlassian investment."
