        "text": "Hi Everyone, I thought I would share another recently completed PB4L project for a high school. This one was for Taupo-nui-a Tia College. It's based around a traditional Māori cloak (korowai). The name 'Taupō' is a shortened version of 'Taupō-nui-a-Tia' meaning the 'great cloak of Tia'. Tia was the Māori explorer who discovered the lake. According to the story (on the school website): \"Journeying on to present-day Lake Taupō, he was disappointed to find a large tribe, Ngāti Hotu, already living there. Tia continued around the eastern shores of the lake to Hamaria, where he noticed that the peculiar colouring and appearance of the cliff face resembled the rain cloak he was wearing. In response to this phenomenon, he named the cliffs Taupō-nui-a-Tia (the great cloak of Tia).\" The PB4L Leadership Team had some specific ideas around the type of image they wanted to see. I was careful during the conceptual stage to make sure that any creative decisions I made tied in with their vision. I'm sharing the concept sketches here to show how the final design was reached. One of the first applications is a pull up banner for their reception area and school assemblies :)\n\nSo, yesterday's post was about a logo design for a school up north. Tokoroa Central School. Today's is all about a logo for a school down south - St Clair School in Dunedin. It's all about the beach :) -------------------------------------------------- St Clair School is a warm and inviting environment for staff and students. The curriculum is play based and designed to be fun and exciting for students while learn about the world around them. Staff are exceptional, passionate, very dedicated and, as a consequence, the school has an excellent reputation in the community. St Clair School is situated in an unique location near St Clair Beach and its big waves. The logo design uses the beach to tell a story about the beliefs and values that are important to the school. And it does this in a modern stylised way. The wave created out of a koru shape represents learning. This learning is continuous and unique to each student - just like every wave is different that crashes on the beach. There are four waves in alternating colours of blue and white. These represent the four school values that support learning - Belonging, Manaaki, Pono and Resilience. There are three geographic features in the logo - the coastline, the waves and the horizon. These represent the three teams - Takutai (the coastline) shown in green and yellow, Ngaru (the wave) and Tahatu (the horizon) which is the curve and sky at the top of the logo symbol. The shape of the logo is inspired by the curves of the waves crashing on the beach as well as the unique circular window that appears on the main building. The earthy blue colours allude to the sea, the yellow to the sand on St Clair Beach and the green to the coastline south west of the beach. The typeface is friendly - like the school.\n\nHi Everyone, here's another recently completed school logo design. This one for Tokoroa Central School. You can read about its meaning below ------------------------------------------------- Tokoroa Central School opened in 1954, just six years after the town was settled in 1948. It is one of the youngest towns in New Zealand. The community loves their school. It is a warm, welcoming, friendly, inclusive family orientated place of learning. There is an amazing and passionate staff who put a lot of effort into tamariki under their care to ensure that they thrive. The new logo design is a combination of Māori and Pasifika symbols combined in a way to tell a story about the school, its culture and unique attributes. Two frangipani shapes symbolise the school's welcoming and loving nature. They also acknowledge the large number of Pasifika students and their contribution to school life. In the middle of the logo is a stylised tree. There are a large number of beautiful trees on the school grounds. Not only that, Tokoroa is known for its forestry, pulp and paper industry. The tree is split into two with four branches on each side. The red branches symbolise the four school values - Excellence / Kairangi, Compassion / Aroha, Integrity / Tapatahi and Courage / Mātātoa. The light blue branches represent the four unique attributes of the Tokoroa Central School Learner - Risk Taker / Whahariterite, Collaborator / Mahi Tahi, Thinker / Māharahara / Whakaaro, and Self Regulator / Manawa kai tūtae. The koru in each of the branches symbolise growth in both areas. Together they make the Tokoroa Central School what it is. The school is cared for by a very supportive community which is symbolised by the circle that connects at the base of the tree. The phrase ‘Ko Manawa o Tokoroa’ isn't currently used by the school but is significant in that it defines both the location of the school near the centre of town and the school as being ‘the heart of Tokoroa’ - a caring and nurturing place for learners. The logo design is clean and modern looking. The typeface is bold and has stylistic traits that work well with the shapes found in the logo symbol. The colours were chosen to help the logo stand out among the other schools in the township. ------------------------------------------------- I've got a few other projects on the go for Tokoroa Central which I hope to share at some stage in the future :)\n\nHi Everyone, This a logo that I recently completed for Karori Normal School in Wellington. Below is the meaning behind it. To all my principal and teacher friends - have a nice term break :) -------------------------------------------------------------------- Karori Normal School (KNS) is a caring and nurturing place of learning in the heart of Karori, Wellington - one of the largest suburbs in New Zealand. The school understands the importance of legacy, looking after the needs of its students, showing responsibility and embracing change in an ever changing world. Before being settled, Karori was a bush-clad hilly region that early Māori would enter to hunt for birds. The te reo word ‘Karori’ is derived from ‘Kaharore’ which means ‘the place of many bird snares’ or ‘the ridge for snaring birds’. The proposed logo shows two birds soaring high in the sky - free to explore their learning. If the name can be connected, in a positive and meaningful way, it could be that Karori Normal School ‘captures’ the hearts and minds of its students and then set them free to learn, explore and discover exciting new things in their world. The two birds are different sizes. This can symbolise the student/teacher relationship when it comes to care, nurture, guidance and leadership. It can also symbolise two students of different ages with the older student mentoring and leading the younger student in the right direction. The koru on the wings symbolise the support of learning along the way - helping students fly higher and higher so as to achieve the very best they can while at KNS. This is summed up by Manawanuitanga - the determination to be our best! There is a playfulness about the birds as they fly. Learning is fun at Karori Normal School. The earthy blue colour in the logotype alludes to the land, while the light blues allude to the ocean and the sky where birds soar high on the thermals of learning in the Wellington region.\n\nHi Everyone, Here are some photos from a recent project I completed for Fiordland College's PB4L programme. It's based on their 'RICE' Values: Respect, Integrity, Curiosity, and Effort. I came up with the concept of a 'moral compass,' and drew upon their stunning natural environment to symbolize each value. RESPECT - Their maunga is Mount Luxmore and the symbol of Fiordland College. The college’s grounds, buildings, staff, and students are all deserving of respect. INTEGRITY - Native plants like the mamaku (NZ black tree fern) and harakeke (NZ Flax) adapt and thrive in their environment. Similarly, Fiordland College students remain true to themselves, regardless of changing circumstances. CURIOSITY - Lake Te Anau is the largest lake in the South Island and considered an important resource by Ngāi Tahu. The lake symbolises opportunities for curious minds to explore the depths of their learning. EFFORT - The kea, considered the world’s smartest bird, exemplifies effort through its productivity and intelligence. Fiordland College students navigate their paths with a growth mindset, ready to tackle life's challenges. A fun project! :)\n\nHi Everyone, Stu Barclay, the Principal at Gisborne Central School - Te Kura o Waiteata, emailed me some photos of the school's new front signage. I worked on this for them last term along with some signs positioned at their other entrances. The sign company did a great job. On the front of the sign is their new logo and gifted whakatauākī. On the back is their pepeha and its translation. In terms of the process, the principal will send me photos of the spaces they require signage and I'll render up some concepts. Gisborne Central is at the end of a cul-de-sac so the sign needed to be eye catching from a distance. Once the concept is approved I email the artwork to the sign company. It's a stress free process for schools :)\n\nHi Everyone, Here's a recently completed logo design project for Gisborne Central School | Te Kura o Waiteata. Their logo story is all about connection and using the local waterways as a metaphor for the student learning journey. 'Waiteata' means 'gentle flowing water'. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Their Logo Story Waiteata begins as a small stream near our school (top koru) and moves slowly toward one of our main waterways/rivers in Tūranganui called the Waimata (2nd koru) which then feed to Wai-weherua (3rd koru) and then out into Tūranganui-a-Kiwa (Poverty Bay) the ocean (4th koru). The narrative connection to our school is seen as our tamariki beginning their life and learning journey like the Waiteata stream as small and gently finding their way into life, then as they develop the skills they begin to grow and become a part of a larger story in our region. Once equipped with the necessary skills and dispositions, they are led to the ocean to access the world. It's a story of our school developing the child locally to take on the world. Also linking to our new vision of ‘lifelong learners’ or ‘learner for life’ The four koru not only symbolise the various waterways important to our location but they also represent our four new school values which help support students on their journey. Whanaungatanga (Relationships & Belonging), Manaakitanga (Respect & Kindness), Māiatanga (Resilience & Perseverance) and Mōhiotanga (Learning & Knowledge). The koru also symbolizes the four school syndicates. The largest koru curves around as if to look back to the smallest koru. This represents a recognition of where we have come from and what has shaped us along our learning pathway. The colours are based on the school colours of red and blue. There are lighter versions of each in the logo symbol which help to create the feeling of flow, progression and movement."
