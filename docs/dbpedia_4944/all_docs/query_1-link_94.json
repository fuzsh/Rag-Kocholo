        "text": "Cultural milieu\n\nNew Zealand’s cultural influences are predominantly European and Māori. Immigrant groups have generally tended to assimilate into the European lifestyle, although traditional customs are still followed by many Tongans, Samoans, and other Pacific peoples. Māori culture suffered greatly in the years of colonization and into the 20th century, and many Māori were torn between the pressure to assimilate and the desire to preserve their own culture. However, since the 1950s there has been a cultural renaissance, with a determined effort to preserve and revive artistic and social traditions. The culture of the Pākehā (the Māori term for those of European descent) has come to incorporate many aspects of Māori culture. The biennial Te Matatini festival, first held in 1972, celebrates Māori culture, especially the traditional dance and song performances known as kapa haka. The festival is held over several days, each time in a different region of New Zealand, and culminates in the national kapa haka championship.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: Anthem of New Zealand (see article)\n\nMāori:\n\nAotearoa\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Christopher Luxon\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 5,378,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 1.698 New Zealand dollar\n\nHead Of State:\n\nBritish Monarch: King Charles III, represented by Governor-General: Dame Alcyion Cynthia (Cindy) Kiro\n\nThe state has moved progressively to assist and encourage the arts. Creative New Zealand, the national agency for arts funding, gives annual grants in support of theatre, music, modern dance and ballet, opera, and literature. In addition, New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish a fund to compensate writers for the loss of royalties on books borrowed from libraries rather than purchased. The national orchestra is supported by the government through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The government also provides taxation and other incentives for the motion-picture industry, and New Zealand-made films have received growing international recognition.\n\nDaily life and social customs\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 13, 2024, 7:55 PM ET (The Hindu)\n\nNew Zealand to loosen gene editing regulation, make commercialisation easier\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 3:12 AM ET (Janes)\n\nNew Zealand accepts first C-130J-30 Hercules\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 4:18 AM ET (AP)\n\nGunmen kill New Zealand helicopter pilot in another attack in Indonesia's restive Papua region\n\nJuly 30, 2024, 6:58 PM ET (AP)\n\nAir New Zealand scraps its 2030 carbon emissions target, saying solutions are costly and scarce\n\nThe Māori culture has seen a renaissance in wood carving and weaving and in the construction of carved and decorated meeting houses (whare whakairo). Māori waiata (songs) and dances have become increasingly popular, especially among the young. Māori meetings—whether hui (assemblies) or tangi (funeral gatherings)—are conducted in traditional fashion, with ancient greeting ceremonies strictly observed. Waves of migrants have also brought different cultures that are celebrated in a variety of ways—for example, in annual festivals such as the Chinese Lantern Festival and Lunar New Year and the Indian festival Diwali.\n\nNew Zealand cuisine has also been influenced by the foods of immigrants and the expectations of international tourists. It was originally a combination of traditional British dishes with local delicacies. Fresh seafood was popular along the coasts; mutton, venison, and meat pies were common. Pavlova, a sweet meringue dish, was and remains a popular dessert. Food, however, has become more imaginative and cosmopolitan, and there are many restaurants, bistros, and cafés in the major cities and towns that present a range of classic and ethnic menus. A traditional Māori feast of meat, seafood, and vegetables is steamed for hours in an earthen oven (hāngī).\n\nNew Zealand celebrates a number of national public holidays. Waitangi Day—February 6, the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840)—is considered the country’s national day. Commemorations are centred on Waitangi but are held throughout the country. Public celebrations include Māori ceremonies as well as sporting events, music, and parades. With the increasing attention paid to Māori history and culture, Waitangi Day has also become an occasion for reflection on the historical effects of European settlement on the indigenous people. Another, more sombre, public holiday is ANZAC Day—April 25, the day in 1915 when amphibious New Zealand and Australian (ANZAC) forces landed at the Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey) and began one of the iconic battles of World War I. The holiday honours those who have served in New Zealand’s military forces, especially those killed in war.\n\nThe arts\n\nThe arts in New Zealand have been strongly influenced by the desire to establish a national identity distinct from that of other cultures. Numerous writers were active in the late 19th century, the most successful of whom were historians, such as William Pember Reeves, and ethnologists, including S. Percy Smith and Elsdon Best. The work of the first genuinely original New Zealand writers, the short-story author Katherine Mansfield and the poet R.A.K. Mason, did not appear until the 1920s. In the 1930s, during the harsh years of the Great Depression, a group of poets appeared and established a national tradition of writing. Although influenced by contemporary English literature—T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden were greatly respected—they wrote about their New Zealand experience. The most-notable member of this group was Allen Curnow. A.R.D. Fairburn, Denis Glover, and Charles Brasch were other major poets. At the same time, Frank Sargeson began writing the superb stories in the New Zealand vernacular for which he became well known.\n\nThe work of those pioneering writers was followed by that of such widely published and acclaimed poets as James K. Baxter, Kendrick Smithyman, Ian Wedde, and Elizabeth Smither. A number of novelists have also earned international reputations, notably Janet Frame, Keri Hulme, Sylvia Ashton-Warner, Lloyd Jones, and mystery writer Ngaio Marsh. Authors Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace explored the intersection of Māori and Pākehā culture. Poet Hone Tuwhare has achieved an international reputation. Those and other New Zealand writers were greatly aided by the growth of the publishing industry in New Zealand.\n\nThe first painter to achieve international recognition, Frances Hodgkins, spent most of her life abroad. In the 1960s, however, an unprecedented art scene began to emerge, created initially by a group of artists, including Colin McCahon and Don Binney, who were helped by the rise of commercial galleries in most large towns and cities. Although New Zealand is often the subject of those paintings, they clearly reflect international influences. That group paved the way for what has become a small legion of artists. Since the late 20th century, Māori arts have experienced growing popularity, and works of visual art are prominently displayed in numerous galleries and museums.\n\nIn the 1970s and ’80s, professional theatre companies—including Downstage in Wellington and the Mercury in Auckland—rose to prominence in the major cities, and they have since been joined or succeeded by a number of small, more experimental companies. A national symphony orchestra tours within New Zealand and internationally, and most towns have musical groups or orchestras that play locally. New Zealand singers who garnered an international following include Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Inia Te Wiata, and Donald McIntyre. Popular music has a long history and was dominated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries by such artists as brothers Neil and Tim Finn and their bands Split Enz and Crowded House, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga, and the hip-hop rapper Scribe.\n\nNew Zealand has a well-developed film industry, and the country has been the setting for a number of films by international directors who took advantage of the local scenery, skilled production workers, and government tax concessions. The films of New Zealand directors Jane Campion and Peter Jackson had notable success around the world; Campion’s The Piano (1993) and Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) in particular received much acclaim. The work of actors Sam Neill, Anna Paquin, Lucy Lawless, and New Zealand-born Australian Russell Crowe has been recognized internationally."
