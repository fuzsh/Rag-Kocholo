Me neither, until I tackled the McCalls 7575. The pattern includes instructions for the no-guess method of tissue fitting. This method involves cutting or tracing pattern pieces according to your size and then pinning the paper pieces together along the seam lines. You then try on the paper outfit and look for areas of adjustment. And guess what? It works! When I saw myself wearing the paper pattern pieces I could immediately identify a common fitting issue for me, around my narrow upper chest. I pinched out the excess on the paper pattern piece for the front and cut my fabric accordingly."
