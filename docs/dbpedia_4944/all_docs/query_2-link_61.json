        "text": "The Wellington West Retirement Community at 1166 Wellington Street West includes 111 suites over nine storeys, above two and a half levels of underground parking. The residence provides 17 units of assisted living and 94 units of independent living within a vibrant, energizing decor.\n\nAmenities include independent and assisted living dining rooms and lounges, aquatic facilities, exercise and fitness room, movie theatre, hair salon and an outdoor terrace.\n\nThe lobbies and corridors at each floor are given a unique colour palette to offer a greater sense of ownership and individuality to the residents, while aiding those with memory impairments.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of identity of space, each of the common amenity areas are given a unique palette of colours, patterns and materials, while weaving a common thread of timeless detailing throughout the building.\n\nArchitecturally, the client desired a building with a sense of permanence while honouring history within a contemporary interpretation. The ground and second floors of the building are expressed in stone masonry, providing a sense of human scale to the streetscape. At the building corner facing the prominent Wellington West and Parkdale intersection, a vertical stone feature extends the full height of the building creating an iconic landmark feature. The division of window bays around the building strategically breaks up the mass while contributing to the commercial “main street” aesthetic of Wellington West. ◼"
