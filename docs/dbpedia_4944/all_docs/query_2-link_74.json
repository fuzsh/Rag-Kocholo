        "text": "What an outstanding job Wright Kitchens has done on our new kitchen! Everything is just perfect - from the functional design, the neat cabinetry, the standout benchtop and the wrap-around splashback, down to the finer details like cabinet trimmings. Our new kitchen now looks brighter, more spacious and modern. Hats off to your impeccable workmanship and attention to detail, we couldn't be any happier. Many thanks to Mel, Stu, Tony, Brady, Craig and the rest of the team!\n\nJerry & Joyce | June 2019\n\nWe are absolutely delighted with our new kitchen. Like others, we began the process by talking to kitchen design stores but they are not able to provide us with the design we wanted. One of our friends recommend us to Wright Kitchen since they have used them before and they are satisfied with the outcome of their kitchen. I contacted Mel and she replied immediately. We set an appointment to discuss our requirements and the most important thing to Mel is she listen to what we wanted and recommends what is best for our kitchen. Her overall design, layout, functionality and aesthetics are wonderful and we couldnâ€™t be happier. We are extremely pleased with the result and the workmanship is of a high standard. We would thoroughly recommend them for any kitchen project.\n\nElvis & Carol | August 2019\n\nFrom the first email to the last detail of the completed wardrobe i have had nothing but professional service. Mel and her Team have been fantastic, no job too big or too small - Mel always responded to my emails in a timely fashion and provided me all the information i requested. Her team were always on time and very professional. I am in love with the end result i am loving my new wardrobe especially the shoe draws they are magic. Would totally recommend Wright Kitchens and would definitely use them again in the future. Great service, Great workmanship. Thank you so much.\n\nDenise A | October 2019"
