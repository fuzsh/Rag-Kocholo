        "text": "The WellKiwis studies are members of the SHIVERS programme family. SHIVERS is a long series of research on influenza (virus and vaccine).\n\nThe first study, Southern Hemisphere Influenza, Vaccine Effectiveness, Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS), was conducted in Auckland during 2012-2017\n\nSHIVERS-II was an adult cohort study in Wellington during 2018-2022\n\nWellKiwis Infant (SHIVERS-III), is an infant cohort study in Wellington during 2019-2026\n\nWellKiwis Household (SHIVERS-IV), is a household cohort study in Wellington during 2021-2028\n\nWellKiwis Adult is a continuation of the SHIVERS-II cohort during 2023-2024\n\nWho is conducting the study?\n\nThis is a multi-agency collaboration led by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR). Other collaborating organisations include the Universities of Otago and Auckland, the Hutt Valley and Capital and Coast District Health Boards, Regional Public Health and other LMCs.\n\nInstitute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR)\n\nESR is New Zealandâ€™s Crown Research Institute specialising in science for communities. ESR use world-leading science to safeguard our health, keep our communities safe, protect our food-based economy, and manage the human impact on our water and natural environment. To learn more please visit the website(external link).\n\nWhy are we doing the WellKiwis study?\n\nInfluenza is challenging to study and there are many aspects of the flu we don't fully understand. WellKiwis is the piece of research that emerged from a global pandemic conference, and leading scientists from around the world believe this study could deliver the insights needed to put an end to pandemics and create the universal flu vaccine.\n\nThis is pioneering research and the WellKiwis Infant study is one of three sites globally. The WellKiwis study site located in Wellington, represents influenza transmission patterns in a Southern Hemisphere country with a temperate climate. The Los Angeles study site represents influenza transmission in a Northern Hemisphere country with a temperate climate. The Managua site in Nicaragua represents influenza transmission in a tropical climate.\n\nWhat is influenza?\n\nInfluenza or the flu is a virus that spreads quickly from person to person, it's a common viral infection that can cause severe illness and for some, even be fatal.\n\nThe flu attacks the lungs, nose and throat. Young children, older adults, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases or weak immune systems are at high risk."
