        "text": "STEM Connections (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)\n\nNEW! — LOOK AT THAT FLOWER!\n\nCalling all Scientists and Artists to join forces and Explore visual problem solving through botanical illustration!\n\n6 sessions, Grade 4\n\nMaking realistic drawings can seem like a scary task to the average 4th-grader, and many assume that it is a matter of elusive talent rather than a skill process that they can learn. In this residency, students will learn to closely observe plants and insects native to Northern New Mexico and beyond. They will apply a variety of drawing techniques to create realistic illustrations of their choices of flora and fauna. As they work to finish their final product, they will also reflect on their process and create a written artist’s statement explaining the scientific discoveries and artistic choices they made along the way. They may discover that Artists and Scientists are really very similar. Liberty Yablon guides students through this creative and reflective approach to understanding symbiotic relationships, photosynthesis and habitat protection through thoughtfully constructed botanical illustrations. Teaching Artist: Liberty Yablon\n\nShape-Shifting Geometry\n\n3 sessions, Grades 2-3\n\nThis experiential unit of study will explore and reinforce students’ understanding of two- dimensional (circle, square, triangle, rectangle) and three-dimensional shapes (sphere, cube, pyramid). They will be creating these shapes with their bodies. The students will be challenged in the first two sessions to create these different shapes working in small groups of two or three students. The third session will challenge the students to use shapes to create a short skit based on a poem by Shel Silverstein poem called “Shapes”. These three sessions can be scheduled over one or two weeks. Teaching Artist: Wendy Chapin\n\nMathematics Gets the Blues\n\n5 sessions over 2-3 weeks, Grades 1-2 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nStudents will work together to write a blues song using the established lyric and musical pattern of that form. Along the way they will create and discover patterns and repetitions in groupings of 4, laying the foundations for addition and multiplication. By practicing these musical patterns within the metric framework, students will connect with these basic mathematical concepts in an entirely new way, cementing a greater, longer lasting understanding. Teaching Artist: Beth Ratay\n\nVolcanoes: The Story of the Valles Caldera\n\n8 sessions, Grades 6-8 (recommended twice weekly for 4 weeks)\n\nWhen students transform earth science into the immediacy of movement, they experience a leap forward in comprehension while simultaneously building learning skills transferable to other subjects. In this residency students choreograph the powerful geologic forces behind one of the largest volcanic eruptions in this continent, the Valles Caldera. This is an integrated dance / literacy / science residency with a focus on understanding the processes that underlie the formation of volcanoes in general and the Valles Caldera in particular. Concepts including plate tectonics, convergence, divergence, subduction, translation and uplift are translated into dance. Teaching Artist: Randy Barron\n\nNew Mexico Desert: Story of Sand\n\n7 sessions, Grades 2-3 (recommended twice weekly for 3 weeks, plus celebration day)\n\nThis is a 6-day integrated dance/science literacy residency focused on sequencing and moving the rock cycle. Based loosely on the FOSS 2nd grade science unit entitled “Pebbles, Sand and Silt: The Story of Sand”, students improvise dance phrases, embodying the changes over time that break down rocks to sand, and the roles that water and wind play in that process. In the process we look at various New Mexico locations where that process is clearly visible. The dance content is based on these naturally occurring events. Veteran dance teaching artist Kathleen Kingsley guides students as they creatively and collaboratively translate the essence of the story of sand into a dance “text” through a creative group process. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nNew Mexico Erosion: Wind and Water\n\n7 sessions, Grades 4-5 (recommended twice weekly for 3 weeks, plus celebration day)\n\nIn this residency students choreograph living landscapes, embodying the powerful force that wind and water play in carving and shaping our planet and specifically our state. This is an integrated dance/ science literacy residency for 4th-5th grades focused on sequencing and visualizing the forces of wind and water and their geographic implications for New Mexico. Teaching artist Kathleen Kingsley guides students as they creatively and collaboratively translate the story of erosion in New Mexico into a dance “text” through the creative process of choreography. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nDry Bones Dancing\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-5 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIn this arts integration residency, students explore musculoskeletal anatomy through improvisational movement and choreography. Students gain an understanding of the human skeleton as they engage in a process of creating choreography, tuning into their own bodies. The residency culminates in small group presentations of choreography created and performed by students. Led by experienced dance educator Julianna Massa, students will discover how their bodies are ideal tools for learning and creativity. Teaching Artist: Julianna Massa\n\nNEW! — The Music of Math and the Science of Sound\n\n5 sessions over 2-3 weeks, Grades 3-5 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIn this residency, students will explore various ways that sound can be created, and how math and measurements work together to create multiple pitches on a single musical string (monochord). When students actively determine how sound and pitch work, they will make important scientific connections, while exercising their measurement, data collection and data organization skills. The exploration of the monochord also serves as an introduction to or review of fractional representation. After learning how a single string can be divided to create different pitches, students will create a short piece of music using the newly discovered properties of the monochord. Dr. Ratay, musician, composer and educator, leads students on this journey of discovery and creation. Teaching Artist: Beth Ratay\n\nNEW! — Acequias: El Agua es Vida (Science Focus)\n\n8 sessions, Grades 6-8 (Not available until Spring Semester, 2025)\n\nIn this residency, students take a deep dive into the science of watersheds, water flow, ecology of riparian areas, and the effects of global warming in New Mexico. As students gain fluency and confidence in movement, they choreograph completed dances that demonstrate their understanding of a history of place through the lens of water. An introduction of the dance elements, simple choreographic phrase structures, and practice with smaller scale challenges that build to larger ones result in complete choreographic works. Students work in groups with “expert packets” of information on specific physics or ecological topics (standards-based), which they mine for their choreography work. This residency requires that students have some familiarity with working effectively in groups as well as comprehension skills, especially reading for information, synthesizing and verbally sharing. This aspect will require extra time outside of the residency contact hours. Teacher involvement is key. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nMath on the Move\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-5\n\nStudents frequently feel frustrated when asked to master mathematical skills without fully understanding the ideas behind those skills, or the ways in which they apply in daily life. In this lively residency, students explore numeracy, symbols, geometry, and collaborative choreography that bring mathematical ideas to life. Students create individual and small-group movement studies based on simple but powerful truths behind everyday math skills, and they will evaluate, edit, and revise their work before recording it on video. No previous dance experience is necessary, and children of all abilities can fully participate. Teaching Artist: Randy Barron\n\nFinding the Math in Musical Patterns\n\n5 sessions, 25 minutes each for Pre-K; 3 sessions, 45 minutes each for K (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators) By identifying and creating musical patterns, students connect with basic mathematical concepts in an entirely new way, cementing a greater, longer lasting understanding of patterns and how they shape our world. Students will identify patterns in familiar songs, and create and share simple patterns using body percussion. Dr. Ratay guides students through this creative process, while demonstrating how mathematics and music intertwine to create patterns pleasing to the mind and the ear alike. Teaching Artist: Beth Ratay\n\nSign Up Form – COMING SOON!\n\nEnglish Language Arts Connections\n\nNEW! — Ink and Imagination\n\n5 sessions, differentiated for Grades 2-12 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIt’s often challenging for students to engage with classroom curriculum when they are struggling to truly know themselves and each other. They need Ink and Imagination! Sketched and Written ideas to be exact. In this residency, students will explore how both sketching and writing with ink on paper can be used as inventive and reflective tools to foster authentic curiosity and establish rapport and respect for the members of their classroom community. Art Making as “Research” is a powerful practice to engage youth in connecting to their own lives & curiosity and then extend that passion to learning overall. These strategies also encourage the development of student voice and choice while constructing skills that all learners can use throughout their education. In this residency, Teaching Artist Michelle Holdt, engages students in a series of art and writing explorations that support creative expression, risk-taking, communication, critical thinking, and demonstrate journaling as reflection. Join Michelle, a creative and compassionate teaching artist, as she engages students to dare, to draw, to write, and to share their imagination! Teaching Artist: Michelle Holdt\n\nBe Your Own Poet Laureate\n\n5 sessions, Grades K2-12\n\n2021-2023 Santa Fe Poet Laureate Darryl Lorenzo Wellington will help students strengthen their language skill and cultivate imaginative and creative abilities, facilitating a 5-session residency where students read poems, discuss poem, critique poems, and—most importantly — write their own. Students learn to ask “Why?” — what is a poem, why is a metaphor successful, and why does a line of poetry appeal to me? The residency plan can adapt for both elementary school students and higher grades, including high school students studying literature, or students in dance, music, gymnastics history, social studies, or science, who are interested in writing cross-disciplinary poetry. Teaching Artist: Darryl Lorenzo Wellington\n\nPoetry as Narrative Writing\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-12\n\nOften, constructing a written narrative seems challenging to students who may struggle to see the main ideas in a sequence of paragraphs. Applying the principles of narrative writing to poetic forms and conventions, students learn to tell evocative stories, both fictional and non-fictional, in their own words. Santa Fe Poet Laureate Darryl Lorenzo Wellington leads this creative approach to teaching narrative writing with joy, inquiry, and discovery. Teaching Artist: Darryl Lorenzo Wellington\n\nDancing New Mexico’s Stories: Poetry in Motion\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-6\n\nPoetry offers a compatible form or structure for choreography as well as a springboard into movement that can be concrete or abstract, simple or complex, depending on student age, comprehension level and experience. Students connect more deeply with poetry when they involve their bodies in expressing meaning. Throughout the residency students will explore moving to words, phrases and whole poems presented as a series of short “movement problems” which they must solve choreographically. Poems range from simple haikus, and poetry centered around the southwest for younger grades, to more linguistically complex works from poets of New Mexico. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nDancing New Mexico’s Stories: The Poetry of New Mexican Poets\n\n7 sessions, Grades 7-12\n\nThis is an integrated dance / ELA residency for middle and high school students with a focus on comprehension and expression; specifically strategies of questioning, making connections and inferring. Literacy encompasses many kinds of “text” including dance. Veteran dance teaching artist Kathleen Kingsley guides students as they probe for details, events, and emotional overtones to deepen the “story” behind the poems of Levi Romero, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Nora Naranjo Morse, Michelle Otero, and Penny Harter, turning images and feelings into meaningful choreography. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nBreathing Life into Literature\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-6\n\nLiterary text can be daunting to young readers, who may find the conventions of fiction difficult going. In this residency, students will use the theater strategies of tableau and dialogue to create, perform, and record a written script based on an appropriate literary work. Wendy Chapin, theater director and long-time ALTO teaching artist, leads this deep exploration of meaning and story. Teaching Artist: Wendy Chapin\n\nPoetry As The Means We Need\n\nSpoken-word and Performance Poetry Residency\n\n5 Sessions, Grades 6-12\n\nSeen as a “step-child” of academic poetry, spoken-word/performance poetry (or slam poetry) is a poetry form that is infinite and accessible to all students. This type of poetry, most importantly, opens the door for poets to use their whole body, and space, to make a poem come alive! In this workshop, through different writing exercises, students will write their own spoken-word poems and will be exposed to different performing styles and will learn memorizing techniques to recite their poem like a seasoned poetry slam poet. This workshop will ask students to explore the power of their own story as a means to create change, not be forgotten, and inspire others to do the same. This residency is suitable for all humanities classes. Teaching Artist: Alejandro Jimenez\n\nSign Up Form – COMING SOON!\n\nSocial Studies Connections\n\nNEW! — Acequias: El Agua es Vida (NM History Focus)\n\n8 sessions, Grades 6-8 (Not available until Spring Semester, 2025)\n\nIn this residency, students take a deep dive into ancient indigenous ways of collecting and distributing water, the Spanish introduction of the acequia system with its defined roles and hierarchy, and the different way of looking at water that the Americans brought to the Southwest. As students gain fluency and confidence in movement, they choreograph completed dances that demonstrate their understanding of a history of place through the lens of water. An introduction of the dance elements, simple choreographic phrase structures, and practice with smaller scale challenges that build to larger ones result in complete choreographic works. Students work in groups with “expert packets” of information on specific historical topics (standards-based), which they mine for their choreography work. This residency requires that students have some familiarity with working effectively in groups as well as comprehension skills, especially reading for information, synthesizing and verbally sharing. This aspect will require extra time outside of the residency contact hours. Teacher involvement is key. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nEmbodying Biography\n\n6-8 sessions\n\nGrades 3-4: Walking in Another Person’s Shoes\n\nGrades 5-6 Becoming A Person You Admire\n\nStudents often struggle with biographies of characters from very different times and places. In this residency, students will use the Actor’s Tools of body movement, voice, and imagination to become the characters they are studying and then write a monologue they will perform as the character. The students can also focus on one character like Georgia O’Keeffe and tell her story by writing scenes that span each of the chapters in their life. The final presentation or performance can be staged in a format similar to a living museum or it can be a play with scenes that represent a part of the person’s journey through their life. Wendy Chapin, well-known Santa Fe director and teaching artist, leads this literally moving residency to make learning about history an engaging experience. Teaching Artist: Wendy Chapin\n\nMaps in Motion\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-6\n\nMap reading is increasingly a lost art, yet maps can give us so much perspective in multiple ways. In this residency, students learn the tools of mapping to create written maps and then put them into creative movement choreography that gives a sense of place and belonging. Multi-disciplinary teaching artist Tamara Johnson guides students through the steps to create their own artistic maps in motion. Teaching Artist: Tamara Johnson\n\nMigration: Movement and Meaning\n\n5 sessions, Grades 3-6\n\nOnce students have a grasp of basic mapping skills, they can use maps to show their understanding of changes in their local community or region over time. Students in this residency focus on migration patterns of the various peoples who live and have lived in northern New Mexico, and then create original choreography to demonstrate their understanding of migration. Tamara Johnson leads this engaging and discovery-packed residency. Teaching Artist: Tamara Johnson\n\nExploring New Mexico History through Song\n\n5 sessions, Grades 5-12 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nWhen students create a piece of music about a historical subject, they greatly increase their comprehension of the subject, and gain important learning skills. In this residency, students will work together to create a corrido (ballad) about Rafael Chacón in the Battle of Valverde, or any important figure or event in New Mexican history. Dr. Beth Ratay, an experienced composer and scholar of world musics, leads this session, focusing on students’ ability to synthesize historical facts into a deeper understanding of how these events shape our collective and individual lives. Teaching Artist: Beth Ratay\n\nBreathing Life into New Mexico History\n\n5 sessions, Grades 2-6\n\nStudents often have difficulty finding personal meaning in doing the research on historical events. During this 5-session residency, students create tableaus or frozen moments sequencing a specific New Mexico historical event such as the Long March or the Battle of Glorieta. In the process, students will engage in language-based learning that comes to life and stays in long-term memory through drama. Students will collaborate in small groups to create a living picture timeline of the chosen event, write narration and share their tableau. Wendy Chapin, a celebrated Santa Fe theater teacher and director, facilitates. Teaching Artist: Wendy Chapin\n\nThe Passion Project, An Exploration of Who We Are\n\n5 sessions, Grades 9-12 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIn this residency, high school students will explore a self-selected topic connected to their personal identity using “arts-based research.” The residency begins with students building and constructing an “artful journal” with recycled materials and found paper ephemera. The journals then become a place to document their research on identity, as described in the New Mexico Social Studies Standards. Students develop their project through a handful of scaffolded creative practices, such as found word poetry, blind contour drawing, and practice interviews. The students will then research on their own using the internet, interviewing experts, having an experience, reading a book, watching a video and MORE! All of their key takeaways are creatively recorded in their journals and with each other in class. Teaching Artist: Michelle Holdt\n\nSocial and Emotional Learning\n\nCreative Movement Skill-Building\n\n6 (30-minute) sessions, pre-K (recommended once a week for 6 weeks)\n\n“Movement is the architect of the brain” says dance educator Anne Green Gilbert. Based on the dance elements of Body, Energy, Space and Time (BEST), and on Anne’s lesson plan format, this residency is an introduction to movement skill-building strategies for the district’s youngest students. Sessions include both somatic awareness techniques and creative dance activities. Kathleen will supply teachers with the lesson plan and teachers are encouraged to repeat parts of the lesson in between residency days. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nLearning with the Brain in Mind\n\n6 (50-minute) sessions, Grades K-1\n\nChildren love to move and learn through movement. But did you know that they also develop their brains by moving? Based on the dance elements of Body, Energy, Space and Time (BEST), BrainDance, and brain-compatible lessons plans, this 5-day residency serve as an introduction for K-3rd teachers and their classrooms to explore the possibilities within dance skill-building for classroom curriculum integration. Led by veteran teaching artist Kathleen Kingsley, sessions include both developmental movement techniques and creative dance activities that can easily be integrated into science, math, SEL, and language arts curriculum development and teaching. Teaching Artist: Kathleen Kingsley\n\nCircles! In Art, Drama, Classroom, and Community\n\n6 sessions, differentiated for Grades pre-K-12 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIn this residency, students will explore circles as a theme in both visual art, drama, and community circles. Students will participate in a handful of scaffolded creative practices such as found circle poems, spiral drawings, simple mandalas as well as playing drama games in a circle, and will host community conversations and circles. Students will creatively record all of their sketches and notes in their journals, and in closing share them with each other in class. Teaching Artist: Michelle Holdt\n\nIdentity Investigation, An Exploration of Self and Community\n\n6 sessions, differentiated for Grades 2-12 (on a limited basis, this residency is also available for APS educators)\n\nIn this residency begins students will explore self and community through drawing and writing in their “altered journals.” The journals become a place to document their research on identity. Teaching artist Michelle Holdt will lead the students through a handful of scaffolded creative practices such as blackout poetry, concept maps, collage, and creative timelines. Students creatively record all of their investigations in their journals, and in closing share them with each other in class. Teaching Artist: Michelle Holdt\n\nSign Up Form – COMING SOON!"
