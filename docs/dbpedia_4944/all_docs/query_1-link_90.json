He brings a wealth of knowledge to the team after leaving his job as a GP to continue his studies in Sports Medicine.\n\nHe works closely with Dr Jake Pearson as well as running his own clinic on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nTheo keeps himself extra busy outside of the office looking after sports teams including the Hurricanes.\n\nSports Medicine Registrar\n\nMBCHB, PGDipSEM\n\nJamie began his Sports Medicine training in 2024 leaving behind his time in General Practice and Urgent Care.\n\nHe is passionate about the care of injuries and medical conditions that impact exercise.\n\nHe is an avid supporter of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team and follows bodybuilding and rugby as well.

He has a particular interest in sports medicine and is always keen on extending his knowledge in the “hands on” approach to physiotherapy.\n\nPeter and his wife Keryn (another one of our physios) moved to Wellington in 2011 from his home town Auckland, mostly for a change of scenery but also to be closer to family and friends.\n\nWhile in Auckland Peter was a physio for a number of sports clubs and representative rugby teams including the North Harbour Sevens, Colts and Maori teams as well as the Northcote Premier and Senior 1st club rugby teams who he also played for a few years ago.

She gained her Diploma of Physiotherapy from Otago Polytechnic in 1988, and also has a Postgraduate Diploma in Manipulative Therapy and a Postgraduate Diploma in Rehabilitation – which included ultrasound imaging and breathing related studies – bad breathing patterns can really interfere with how your whole system works. She joined Capital Sports Medicine as a director in 1997.\n\nHelen is particularly interested in recurring injuries that stem from poor body mechanics. Like when your sore back is actually caused by your over tight hamstring, or how your previous injuries are inter-linked. She looks at how the body works as a whole, and whether weakness or tightness of some muscle groups is putting too much strain on others, and causing re-injury. From there she develops exercise programmes to address the problem area and soft tissue work or mobilisation as required.\n\nOutside of work, Helen keeps herself fit with a bit of yoga, swimming and trail running as well as mountain-biking, and doing crazy navigational stuff – she doesn’t always know where she is but always knows where home and a hot shower is! She also teaches kids to MTB with WORD (Wellington Off-road Riding Department) – sharing the love of riding, one ride at a time!\n\nBHSC, BPhed, BCA, COMT, MPNZ\n\nDirector Capital Sports Medicine\n\nKeryn became part of the Capital Sports Medicine team in 2012, when she moved back to Wellington from Auckland with her husband Peter, another Capital Sports physiotherapist.\n\nKeryn grew up on the Kapiti Coast and originally studied in Wellington.

He has participated in various events in the local and wider area such as Crazyman and The Goat all with varying degrees of failure\n\nHe has a broad base of skills but given the propensity of mountain biking carnage in Wellington and crazy ultra-running guys/girls around, he is often in demand for these areas.
