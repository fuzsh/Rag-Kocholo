New pupils to the College will be assigned to a House upon arrival.\n\nEach member of staff, including technical, office staff and support staff have also been allocated to a House.\n\nThe aims of the House System are:\n\nTo encourage and develop team spirit and House identity\n\nTo provide a system of rewards for pupils that sits outside the Code of Behaviour\n\nTo encourage pupils to become more involved in extra curricular activities\n\nTo give pupils the opportunities to develop leadership and team building skills in the organisation of House activities or competitions\n\nTo give pupils the opportunity to meet with others from their House from different Year groups\n\nThe Houses are each led by two House Captains who are part of the Senior Prefect team. They are responsible for maintaining the House noticeboard, for conducting the House assemblies and for organising and overseeing House activities/events.\n\nEach House is supported by two members of staff – a House Master and House Mistress – to assist the House Captains in the smooth running of the House, to assist with administration and to act as a link between pupils and staff in each House.\n\nHouse assemblies will be held on a monthly basis.\n\nPupils can earn individual points for their House for a range of successes including academic, sporting, drama, musical, representation at other extra curricular events, maintaining merits and attendance in addition to earning team points for their House through inter-House competitions."
