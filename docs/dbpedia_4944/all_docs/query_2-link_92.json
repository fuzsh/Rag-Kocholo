        "text": "Few things unite Britons, from farmers to the fashion set, like Wellington boots. Defined by their durability and the fact they can withstand the UK’s 1,200mm of average yearly rainfall, they’re the quintessential British shoe.\n\n“It’s more than practicality now – wellies are something of a status symbol,” says welly expert Fiona Coe of Coes, an independent chain of clothing and country attire shops in Suffolk and Norfolk. That’s why so much has been made of the fact that the Princess of Wales’s favourite brand is Le Chameau (whose sales rose 36 per cent once it was known.)\n\nAs country-dwellers and city workers, we’re interested in finding wellies that look good as well as feel goo, and which can hack a sludgy country field but wouldn’t look out of place on Hampstead Heath. That’s a tall order. Read on below for our full reviews, but if you’re in a hurry, here’s a quick look at our top five:\n\nWhich are the best wellington boots in 2024? At a glance\n\nBest overall — Hunter Balmoral\n\nBest for heavy wear — Muckboot Muckmaster\n\nBest for comfort — Fitflop Wonderwellies\n\nBest for wide calves — Joules Fieldmore\n\nBest for warmth — Holland Cooper Sherpa\n\nHow to choose the best wellington boots for you\n\n“The strict criteria we have for countrywear is that they are fit for purpose, durable and look good,” says Hillary Bacon of Cordings, the traditional country outfitters in Piccadilly, London. She likes royal-approved Chameau boots but notes they are a significant outlay and by no means the only option.\n\nCoe favours Barbour (“If you want a good pair at a reasonable price, that you know is going to last you, they’re the ones to go for”) and the new heritage country-wear brand Holland Cooper, whose sherpa-lined Wellingtons are a popular urban-country hybrid option.\n\nIf you’re looking for Wellingtons for occasional wear, or for kids, you may not want to spend upwards of £50 on a pair. But Bacon says: “I always apply a simple calculation – number of times worn divided by the price. A good pair of boots will last for years, so if you are intending to wear Wellingtons even once a month it’s worth it.”\n\nHow we tested the best Wellington boots\n\nHattie Garlick, the Telegraph’s countryside and parenting correspondent, lives in a watery part of Norfolk while Abi and Rebecca have family in the countryside. They stomped along footpaths and through muddy fields with the help of willing family members and canine friends to find the very best wellies for men, women and kids.\n\nWe rated them for grip, comfort, the quality of the waterproofing and whether they succeed in keeping feet warm. The results are below. If you spend a lot of time in muddy puddles, you might want to read our guide to the best waterproof jackets too...\n\nThe best Wellington boots\n\n1. Unisex Balmoral Classic Side Adjustable Wellington Boots\n\n£150, Hunter\n\nBest for walking, 10/10\n\nWe like: the grippy, durable sole\n\nWe don’t like: if we’re being critical, they’re a little stiff\n\n3mm neoprene lining\n\nAdjustable gusset and buckle\n\nMulti-directional tread for traction and mud release\n\nVersions for men and women\n\nRecommended by Abigail Buchanan\n\nMy top choice of welly brand has the royal seal of approval. Hunter, which was founded in 1856, holds two royal warrants of appointment to The Queen. The (slightly) cheaper Hunter Originals (£135, Hunter) are still enduringly popular, but my top choice are the technical Balmoral Wellingtons, which are unisex (UK 4-13).\n\nThey have the best sole in the business: a super-sturdy lugged Vibram design offers great grip and traction and even stood up to an eight mile walk on Boxing Day, which is far farther than I’ve managed in other wellies. I tested these on boggy fields and muddy footpaths, but I reckon they could take snow in their stride, too. They’re lined with 3mm neoprene, which you instantly notice in terms of how they feel on the inside (plush) and how warm they keep your feet (very). They even come with 3mm and 5mm neoprene insoles, so you can adjust the fit.\n\nThey have a slip-on design with an adjustable buckle on the calf and a handy heel spur to help you take them off, but you could opt for the version with a full-length zip if you need a pair that are even easier. Overall, the boots feel sturdy, warm and surefooted; you can tell they’re built to last.\n\nThe Hunter Originals, which I also tested, are worth considering. They’re unanimously voted the favourite of Glastonbury-goers, and manage to be hard-wearing, durable and comfortably flexible at the same time.\n\nRecommended by Hattie Garlick\n\n5mm neoprene lining\n\nNo gusset or buckle\n\nDurable lug outsole for grip\n\nUnisex\n\nMy 11-year-old son tested these boots and took the role seriously, clambering up to the top of a wet Welsh hill, wading through shallow streams, traversing bogs, conducting a mud fight, yet these held up to it all. They’re made to be a working boot and it shows.\n\nThe grip on the sole is tapered away from the boot, the idea being that mud and small stones don’t get stuck. To my surprise, it actually works. It also extends up the boot’s heel, giving you extra grip and thus confidence on hillsides and craggy landscapes while also acting as a kick-spur (making it easier to heave your boots off when you get home).\n\nRubber reaches almost up the whole length of the boot. The top band is stretchy neoprene that fits snugly to your leg and stops any chilly drafts or puddle splashes seeping in – it also allows you to pull the boots on easily. But the boots are actually fully-lined with 5mm of neoprene, making them thicker, warmer and more comfortable for long walks than standard wellies. A solid, reinforced toe-cap means you can kick balls, climb gates and more without fear. They’re unisex, available in sizes UK 4-13 and two lengths.\n\n3mm neoprene lining\n\nGusset and adjustable tightening strap\n\nShock absorbing dual-density grip\n\nVersions for men and women\n\nRecommended by Abigail Buchanan\n\nLe Chameau is a true heritage brand; it was founded in 1927, and both Prince Harry and the Princess of Wales have been pictured sporting a pair of their wellies. The Vierzonord Wellingtons come highly recommended by Hillary Bacon of Cordings, too. It’s no wonder they have the royal seal of approval; each pair of Le Chameau boots is handmade by an individual “maître bottier” (master bootmaker), and they’re understatedly stylish, with a flash of a bright blue lining, and of excellent quality. They’re made from natural rubber and come in sizes UK 2.5-14 and three colour options.\n\nThe soles feel firmer and slightly more inflexible than the models above, but I like that they feel sturdy enough to handle tricky terrain, and the 3mm neoprene lining keeps my feet and calves warm – to be frank, at this price, it had better. They’re also adjustable via waterproof gussets and buckles on the side of each boot.\n\nPolyamide lining\n\nNo gusset or buckle\n\nLugged sole in tri-density rubber\n\nVersions for men and women\n\nRecommended by Rebecca Astill\n\nThe selling point to these Aigle Parcours Two wellies is the brand new ‘anti-fatigue’ technology, meaning you can walk further without getting tired. This is thanks to the tri-density sole which has a cushioning rubber inset, a stabilising midsole, and a 360 degree gripping sole inspired by a chamois mountain goat hoof, no less. Essentially, they absorb impact better than other wellies, meaning you feel less strain on long walks.\n\nHaving tested these on a 10 mile walk around Cornwall in that soggy time between Christmas and New Year, I can confirm they really are comfortable. I actually look forward to wearing them, and then forget they’re on my feet for most of the walk. The wellington boots are completely waterproof too - the Cornish weather tested that for me, they dry off within minutes and are easy to clean thanks to the natural rubber.\n\nI’ve had mine for five years so far, so they stand the test of time. The Aigle boots are easy to pull on and off, and I keep mine stored in the Aigle Classic Boot Bag (£18.45 on Amazon). They’re definitely on the expensive side but worth it for their durability.\n\nFleece lining\n\nAdjustable buckle and zip\n\nFor women\n\nRecommended by Hattie Garlick\n\nThere are, obviously, bigger problems with which to concern oneself, but few have a more pressing impact on my day-to-day existence (juggling dog walks with work deadlines and the school run) than the search for the perfect, versatile wellington boot. A boot for all occasions.\n\nThese boots bring my quest to a happy end. They look like trendy biker boots – short in height, rubber masquerading as patent leather, and decorated with a chunky buckle.\n\nThey look great on city pavements, paired with thick tights and a dress or jeans. But they are also entirely waterproof and their soles have great grip, so they tested equally well on short dog walks down the country tracks and lanes around our village. Best of all, they are also fleece-lined and thus incredibly cosy in winter. You wouldn’t want to tackle truly boggy fields in these, but I can now head into town, grab a coffee, pick the kids up from school, then give the dog a quick sprint without changing. First-world problem, satisfyingly solved.\n\nVegan Shearling lining\n\nNo gusset or buckle\n\nFor women\n\nRecommended by Hattie Garlick\n\nFor those with mobility issues, stiffness or just general middle-age aches and pains, these boots are a godsend. The foot is coated in natural rubber while the length is fleece-lined neoprene, making them extremely flexible and exceptionally easy to climb in and out of. You can roll the neoprene down to make the job even easier and there’s a long, sturdy tag at the back to help.\n\nI’ve taken to leaving them by the back door, rolled down, so that I can step straight into them for garden jobs (putting the bins out or feeding the chickens). For dog walks, I roll them up and they reach mid-calf (better still, the generous diameter and fleece-lined top means they never chafe).\n\nOnce your feet are in, the flexibility and super-warm, super-soft lining (even the insole is fleece-covered) feel as if you are wearing slippers. Moisture is efficiently wicked away and the grip has proved more than a match for the mud-slicked fields I now tramp them through daily.\n\nPolyester lining\n\nAdjustable buckle\n\n‘Springboard’ ridged footing\n\nFor women\n\nRecommended by Abigail Buchanan\n\nThese wellies claim to be ‘the most comfortable in the world’. That may sound like a marketing spiel, but on testing I found them almost as comfortable as trainers, thanks to the springy ‘honeycomb’ mesh in the footbed and heel, plus the lightweight, flexible rubber of the boot. I didn’t take them for a run, but they are so comfortable and supportive that I swear I could have. Although they’re unlikely to be the top choice for fashionistas, they look decent, and come in three colours.\n\nAnd more importantly still, they’re very practical. The flexible rubber they’re constructed from means they’re incredibly easy to get on and off – the easiest of all the boots I trialled, in fact. The lightweight rubber is only lined with polyester, so these wouldn’t do for outdoor work or all-day-wear in cold weather, but they’ll see you through many a rainy afternoon.\n\nThermal sherpa lining\n\nTwo adjustable buckles\n\nTraction grip sole\n\nFor women\n\nRecommended by Abigail Buchanan\n\nThese are the kind of wellies that rural dwellers could be snobby about. But don’t let the gold buckles and plush thermal sherpa lining convince you they’re not hard-wearing – I found these urban-glam boots to be more than up to the job.\n\nThe deep lugged sole and durable vulcanised rubber mean they offer superior grip on slippy, muddy terrain, as well as cosy warmth and comfort that rivals my trusty UGG boots. They come in sizes UK 3-8, three colours, and have a waterproof gusset and buckle to adjust the calf size.\n\nDue to the thick lining, I would say these are slightly tricker to pull on and off than the other pairs I tested. But they fit the bill perfectly if your goal is to keep warm on a winter walk and look good whilst doing it (until you find a pub with a roaring fire for a pitstop).\n\nPolyester lining\n\nBuckle\n\nRubber outsole with Hunter Original tread pattern\n\nFor kids\n\nRecommended by Hattie Garlick\n\nFor children who live in the middle of the countryside, my two are bewilderingly reluctant to venture outside into it. Until, that is, these boots came along. My eight-year-old daughter did not care a hoot that they are handmade from natural vulcanised rubber and highly resistant to wear and abrasion (although thick socks are a must to avoid calf-rubbing).\n\nShe did not care (though I very much did) that Hunter’s tread patterns leave her unlikely to slip on our muddy walks, or that the back of the boots have prominent silver reflectors at the heel and rim. She did not care that the polyester lining has a space on which to write your name and a telephone number.\n\nAll she cares about is that they sparkle glamorously with multi-coloured glitter. Dog walks suddenly got cool (though these will also be fantastic for festivals, camping trips, and even look great with party dresses). They’re available in sizes UK 12-4 and three colour options.\n\nFleece lining\n\nLace tie for fastening\n\nGripped sole\n\nFor kids\n\nRecommended by Hattie Garlick\n\nWhen it comes to toddlers and small children, two complaints commonly plague walks. One: cold toes. Two: wet socks. Muddy Puddles, started by a mother from the kitchen table of a Devon farmhouse, have been my go-to solution ever since my children began to toddle around.\n\nFleece-lined throughout, they keep small feet and legs warm. But they also have a quilted upper that ties around the calf with a jauntily striped lace, so that children can jump in muddles without muddy splashes coming in over the top of their wellies. It even blocks draughts and snow.\n\nThe rest of the boots are made from thick, high-quality rubber with super-grippy soles. A silver reflective strip runs right the way up the back of the boot, for extra visibility on darker afternoons. Though perfect for toddlers, my eight-year-old loved how toasty she stayed in them – and I wish they came in my size too.\n\nWellington boots FAQ\n\nWhy are they called Wellington boots?\n\nWellington boots, nicknamed ‘wellies’ are named after the first Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley. He popularised the style of boot between the late 18th century after commissioning his shoemaker to create a waterproof boot. The result was a calf-high leather boot treated with wax.\n\nHow should Wellington boots fit?\n\n“You should always try on your boot with appropriate socks,” says Cordings’ Hilary Bacon. “The boot should allow slightly more movement than a walking boot, but you want to make sure your foot is properly supported and your ankle and calf are comfortable. If you intend to wear them in colder months, neoprene lined wellingtons will give you extra warmth.”\n\nShould Wellington boots be a size bigger?\n\nYou should buy your normal size in Wellington boots, ensuring that they fit snugly without being too tight. As with all shoes, wellies that are too large can cause blisters. Make sure you try on your wellies with the socks you’d usually wear for walking - if they’re thick socks you may need to size up.\n\nAre Wellington boots good for snow?\n\nWellington boots are great for snow because they’re waterproof and have good tread and grip. A knee-length pair will keep damp off your socks and legs, even in deep snow. It’s also important to make sure you choose a Wellington boot with good support to protect your ankle if you slip."
