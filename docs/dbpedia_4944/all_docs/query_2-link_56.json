There’s a removable, shock absorbing insole for extra comfort, and a moulded heel and arch, which holds feet in position. Fully waterproof, they have an elasticated back gusset with popper fastening so you can adjust for comfort and to tuck in trousers, and although they have a ridge rather than a kick spur, they’re easy to get on and off. A ridged sole and block heels means they offer plenty of grip in heavy mud, as well as on loose gravel on slopes. They’re also quick to clean as the ridges aren’t too deep, so the soles don’t clog with mud. Despite not having toecaps, they’re suitable for digging as the heel and sole are strong and sturdy. However, they’re not well insulated so need a thick pair of socks for warmth in cold weather. Scuff-resistant, they come with a one-year warranty and are available in a range of different colours and patterns.\n\nUK sizes: 3-9\n\nDigital market & commerce executive, Angelica Wilson says:\n\n‘I have high arches and struggle with very flat shoes, so I was really pleased these boots support my foot shape and feel comfortable.’\n\nLakeland tall wellington boots\n\nRRP: £59.95\n\nOur rating: 4.8 out of 5\n\nBuy now from Lakeland Footwear (£59.95), Ethical Superstore (£59.95), and Natural Collection (£59.95)\n\nPros:\n\nVegan friendly\n\nMade from 100% sustainably sourced natural rubber\n\nComfortable fit\n\nBreathable, cotton lining\n\nAvailable in 10 colours\n\nCons:\n\nNeed thick socks for warmth in cold weather\n\nAwarded a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for sustainability, these wellies are suitable for vegans, are made entirely with FSC certified natural rubber, sourced in Sri Lanka, and have an organic cotton lining. Light and flexible, they’ve an adjustable strap, making them very easy to get on and off and our tester wore the next size up, which allowed plenty of room for warm socks. They have a good arch support, which means they’re comfortable and don’t rub, even on long walks. Block heels make them good for digging, and the toe area is reinforced with extra rubber, offering additional structure and support for lighter gardening jobs. Gripping well in muddy woods and on icy roads, the sole doesn’t clog up with mud, which means they’re quick and easy to rinse clean too. Fully waterproof and scuff-resistant, even after walking through brambles, they come with a one-year warranty.\n\nUK sizes: 4-8\n\nSenior digital reviews writer, Cinead McTernan says:\n\n'These wellies are nice and light, so well suited to long walks with the dog, as well as pottering in the garden.'\n\nMerry People Bobbi wellington boot\n\nRRP: £84.95\n\nOur rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nBuy now from Merry People (£84.95)\n\nPros:\n\nVery comfortable\n\nMade with tough, vegan materials\n\nLight, easy to wear\n\nCons:\n\nDoes not have protection above the ankle\n\nTread not for very muddy conditions\n\nAwarded a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for everyday use, the Bobbi wellington boots are light, tough, and comfortable to wear. Easy to slip on and off, with two straps to help you get your feet in quickly, once slipped on, these boots are warm, thanks to a neoprene lining, and comfortable with good arch support. Made from natural vegan rubber they're tough, waterproof, and very easy to wipe clean. The Bobbi boot’s tread has good general grip, and there's a chunky heel to help keep you up and out of the mud but although these boots are great for everyday gardening, they don’t protect your legs from the mud so are not for wearing in very wet or muddy conditions.\n\nAvailable in a wide range of colours they come with a one-year warranty. We recommend buying your normal shoe size, but rounding down if you’re at a half size.\n\nUK sizes: 3-10\n\nLe Chameau Women’s Iris Jersey Lined Wellington Boots\n\nRRP: £110\n\nOur rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nBuy now from Country Attire and Le Chameau\n\nPros:\n\nComfortable fit\n\nJersey lined to wick away moisture\n\nSupportive sole and heel\n\nEasy to clean\n\nAvailable in seven colours\n\nCons:\n\nNeed thick socks for warmth\n\nNo toe cap reinforcement\n\nAwarded a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for summer months, Le Chameau’s Iris women’s wellington boots are made from 80% natural Chamolux rubber, sourced from a mature rubber plantation in Vietnam. The additional 20% is synthetic rubber to improve durability. Light and flexible, they’re a great fit, despite not having an adjustable strap, and offer plenty of support. They’re lined with jersey cotton, which prevents slipping or rubbing and wicks moisture away from feet, keeping them dry and making them ideal for hot weather. However, our tester needed to wear thick socks for warmth on colder days. They grip well in muddy conditions and the heel feels solid and balanced, although there isn’t reinforced toe protection. Available in seven colours, they’re 100% waterproof, scuff resistant and easy-to-clean. Amongst the more expensive pairs on test, they come with a two-year warranty.\n\nUK sizes: 3-8\n\nPicture editor, Sarah Edwards says:\n\n‘My feet never felt wet or moist thanks to a jersey lining.’\n\nAigle Chambord Pro Lady 2\n\nRRP: £90.00\n\nOur rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nBuy now from Country Attire and Aigle\n\nPros:\n\nSoft, supple and flexible\n\nExcellent grip\n\nGood support\n\nComfortable\n\nCons:\n\nBig for size\n\nThese rubber wellington boots are handmade and easy to get on and off. They feel soft and supple and have a handy quick dry lining. They were comfortable to wear with generous room around the calves and feet and have a firm grip underfoot. There is a two-year warranty included and we awarded them a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for wider leg shapes.\n\nSizes: UK 2-8\n\nReviews editor, Kay Maguire says:\n\n‘Really easy to get on and off and great for tucking in your jeans so they stay clean and dry too.’\n\nRead the full Aigle Chambord Pro Lady 2 review.\n\nBest Buy men’s wellington boots and unisex pairs\n\nHunter Original Tall Wellington Boots\n\nRRP: £135\n\nOur rating: 4.8 out of 5\n\nSQUIRREL_TEXT_461889\n\nPros:\n\nAdjustable calf\n\nFoot support\n\nGood for digging\n\nStrong and sturdy\n\nCons:\n\nBlock heel unpopular\n\nHunter’s original rubber wellington boots offer a comfortable and flexible fit and are easy to get on and off.

The cushioned insole makes them comfortable while the reinforced toe ensures sturdiness. There’s a good grip, so the boots are ideal for muddy conditions and warmer weather. A one-year warranty is included and we awarded them a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for men’s heavy duty wellington boots.\n\nSizes: UK 4-14\n\nDeputy editor, Kevin Smith says:\n\n‘They are wide around the calf (so good for those with bigger calves) but a little gappy around the ankle.’\n\nRead the full Skellerup Red Band Knee Length Farm Boot review.\n\nBuy the Skellerup Red Band Knee Length Farm Boot from Granite Workwear\n\nLe Chameau Vierzonord Neoprene Lined Wellingtons\n\nRRP: £200\n\nOur rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nExceptionally warm\n\nShoe like fit\n\nEasy calf adjustment\n\nGood support\n\nCons:\n\nCan be hard to get off\n\nMade from a combination of rubber and neoprene, these wellington boots by Le Chameau are very warm and have an adjustable calf for a better fit. Although easy to slip on, the pair can be harder to get off. They have a comfortable fit with a shoe like feel, although they may be snug for wider feet. There’s a wide range of sizes and colours and they are available for men and women. There’s a two-year warranty included and we awarded them a BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine Best Buy for cold weather.\n\nSizes: UK 2.5-15\n\nSenior reviews writer, Cinead McTernan says:\n\n‘Good fit and the lining of these boots keep feet warm and dry.’\n\nRead the full Le Chameau Vierzonord Neoprene Lined Wellingtons review.\n\nThe best of the rest\n\nAlthough some models didn’t quite achieve a BBC Gardeners’ Magazine Best Buy award, they still have great features that make them worth recommending. Browse our pick of the best of the rest on test.\n\nNiwaki Rubber boots - Unisex\n\nRRP: £119\n\nOur rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nBuy now from Niwaki (£119)\n\nPros:\n\nSteel toe cap, so useful for heavy duty jobs\n\nWashable inside and out\n\nCons:\n\nSnug fit\n\nNeed socks for warmth\n\nComparatively expensive\n\nComfy, supportive and stylish, these heavy-duty boots are rubber lined so don’t need thick socks to keep feet warm, which is just as well as they’re a snug fit. The chunky soles grip well in muddy conditions and stony slopes, and given the substantial heel, work well when using garden spades and forks. They also feature steel toe caps, which means they’re good for other practical gardening and DIY jobs, but are still light enough for walking. There’s a soft rubber hood at the top of the boot, which is designed to make them watertight, but had a tendency to flop down on test - though this could be to do with calf size rather than design. We also like that they’re easy to wash, both inside and out, but you must remove the insoles first. Amongst the more expensive pairs on test, they come with a two-year warranty.\n\nSizes: UK 5.5-10.5\n\nSenior digital reviews writer, Cinead McTernan says:\n\n‘I love the look of these boots, and they’re also a practical option if you want a sturdy pair that’s ideal for all sorts of gardening jobs.’\n\nBuy Niwaki Rubber Boots from Niwaki\n\nRHS Muckster II Boots\n\nRRP: £120\n\nOur rating: 4.3 out of 5\n\nSQUIRREL_TEXT_461471\n\nPros:\n\nEasy to get on/off - so perfect for a backdoor boot\n\nWaterproof but breathable\n\nSturdy toe protection\n\nLightweight so not tiring\n\nCons:\n\nSlightly wide in the foot\n\nSoles could be sturdier to enable extended digging\n\nThe pale colour, which may not age as well as a darker shade over time.\n\nThese half-height boots are easy to slip on and off, thanks to moulded heels and flexible neoprene boot cuffs at the top, which can be rolled down for ease of access but are high enough to tuck-in for trousers. Lined and warm, even in cold weather, they’re reasonably true to size, and good for wider feet, so if you’ve narrow feet, you may want thicker socks. Sturdy and lightweight, they have a padded insole with some arch support, which makes them comfortable for a long day in the garden. They also have a band of reinforcement over the tips of the toes, for protection during lighter jobs. However, they’re not cushioned enough for prolonged digging, or distance walking, where you’d also want firmer ankle support, and shallow treads means they lack good grip in muddy, wet conditions. Easy to clean - either sponging off or brushed clean where mud was left to dry, the uppers in a pale colour might stain in time, but after 2 months wear, they retain a near-new look despite wearing in winter mud. The rubber boots are waterproof, while the neoprene uppers repels water. Amongst the more expensive pairs on test, they come with a one-year warranty.\n\nSizes: UK 3-9\n\nFormer Editor, Lucy Hall says:\n\n‘They are a good second boot for me - as they’re easy to keep by the backdoor, to kick on and off in a hurry, but the lack of grippy sole means I’d always need a sturdier boot for extended digging, dog-walking or rambling over rougher terrain.'\n\nBuy Muck Boot RHS Muckster 11 boots from John Lewis\n\nLBC Explorer ultralight boots - unisex\n\nRRP: £59.99\n\nOur rating: 4.3 out of 5\n\nSQUIRREL_TEXT_462645\n\nPros:\n\nVery lightweight, but built to last\n\nRemovable lining\n\nKick spur, so easy to put on and take off\n\nCons:\n\nWide fit, no support for calves or arches\n\nNo toe cap reinforcement\n\nOnly available in green and black\n\nThese short-style wellington boots from Leon Boot Company are surprisingly light. A great option if practicality is at the top of your wish list, they feature deep, thick soles that grip well, even in muddy conditions, a kick spur on the back to help remove the boots, and a removable liner. Made from a solid piece of rubber, they’re also completely waterproof, durable and simple to wash as there’s nowhere for mud to collect. A loose-fit design, it’s easy to put them on and take off, however, this generous sizing means they don’t support the calf, and as the heel is relatively low and the sole flat, people with high arches might find them uncomfortable. They also don’t have toe protection and aren’t breathable, which means feet can get hot and sweaty. They come with a one-year warranty for the boot, but the internal sock has no warranty.\n\nSizes: UK 3-14\n\nSenior content creator, Miranda Janatka says:\n\n'They definitely deliver on their promise - surprisingly lightweight and yet still feel strong, solid, and flexible.'\n\nBuy Explorer ultralight boots from Amazon\n\nAriat Burford Waterproof Rubber Boot\n\nRRP: £140\n\nOur rating: 4.3 out of 5\n\nSQUIRREL_TEXT_462639\n\nVery light and bouncy\n\nBreathable\n\nToe protection\n\nCons:\n\nRub on back of heel\n\nAdjustable calf more for decoration\n\nThis pair of long wellington boots are light and springy to wear and ideal for walking. Made from a combination of rubber and leather, the pair offer good grip and support although they can rub on the back of the heel for some wearers. There’s a choice of three colours available and they are guaranteed for one year.\n\nSizes: UK 3-8\n\nBuy the Burford waterproof rubber boots from Ariat\n\nAriat Kelmarsh rubber boot\n\nRRP: £110\n\nOur rating: 4 out of 5\n\nSQUIRREL_TEXT_462904\n\nPros:\n\nVery bouncy and comfortable\n\nVery light\n\nEasy to get on and off\n\nGood grip\n\nCons:\n\nThe straps are hard to adjust and close\n\nThe fit is wide around the foot and the ankle\n\nColours won't be for everyone\n\nExpensive for lack of thermal lining\n\nThe new Kelmarsh rubber boot from Ariat come up a bit big and are quite wide in the foot and ankle, which, together with a slight but effective bump on heel, means they’re very easy to take on and off. There’s also an adjustable strap at the back, but it's quite awkward to use and needs both hands to close the clip fastening. Lightweight and bouncy - thanks to a cushioned, shock absorbing sole - these boots are comfortable for walking and prolonged use. Strong and sturdy, they also grip well, and the soles don’t clog up with dirt as they push mud out to the edges as you walk. Fully waterproof, scuff-resistant, and warm, thanks to a jersey lining, they don’t feature toe protection. Disappointingly, there’s a choice of just two colours - blue or grey - as well as a large logo on the back, which might not appeal to everyone. Amongst the more expensive pairs on test, they come with a one-year warranty.\n\nSizes: UK 3-8.5\n\nReviews editor, Kay Maguire says:\n\n‘These are bouncy and light and very comfortable even after a day in the garden, and are great for walking the dog too.’\n\nBuy the Kelmarsh Rubber Boot from Ariat\n\nHow to choose the best wellington boots\n\nMake sure they’re comfortable to wear and fit well. In our descriptions of each pair of wellingtons, we’ve noted if the sizing is particularly large or snug. We’ve also highlighted features that we found improved or impeded the comfort of each pair.\n\nThe material the boots are made from will also affect how they feel to wear. For instance, neoprene may make the boots more flexible, while fleece linings will improve comfort and warmth.\n\nEvery pair will have a slightly different grip and heel size and some may also have features such as reinforced toes, which are useful for heavy duty work. In any wellington boot, a good, strong grip is important to keep you steady on your feet in wet, stony, or muddy conditions.\n\nHow to look after your wellington boots\n\nAlways clean your boots regularly, preferably after every use, but especially when they’re very muddy. Wash them with cold soapy water, make sure they’re dry, then store them out of direct sunlight, somewhere cool and dry. Don’t leave them near a radiator or fire to dry, or store them outside in a cold shed or garage, as this can cause shrinking, splitting and cracking. With rubber boots, consider investing in a silicone spray or boot buffer, which will help to prevent the rubber degrading\n\nExcess heat or sunlight can cause blooming on rubber wellies – when a white powdery finish forms on the surface of the boots. It should come off by wiping a wet cloth downwards across the rubber, but if it\n\ndoesn’t shift, then try a rubber buffer spray.\n\nHow we tested wellies\n\nWe tested a range of women's and men's wellington boots for several months over the winter and into spring. They were assessed according to the following criteria with equal marks attributed to each:\n\nComfort. Looked at how easy they were to put on and take off, general size and fit, as well as suitability for a range of gardening jobs and walking.\n\nSole and materials. Focused on grip and how well they coped with mud. We also assessed the heels and soles for digging, as well as if they featured toe caps, were warm and finally, if they were easy to clean.\n\nDurability. Assessed if the boots were sturdy and built to last, as well as if there were waterproof and scuff resistant.\n\nValue for Money. Considered all of the above plus any special features, RRP and warranty.\n\nFor more information on our testing process see How we Review.\n\nThis review was last updated in February 2024.
