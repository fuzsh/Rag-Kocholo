And they lost he Praetor, but not before they raised him to the rank of Praetor, asking him to make Astraeus pay for what he did to the camp. To win whatever war this started and to protect those who made it out.\n\nPersonality\n\nKaden was sort of a social butterfly growing up, never had any problems making new friends at school, or on the playground when he and his mom would go there. Which helped when they ended up moving. While the intensity of his comfort taking to strangers has diminished he is still the one guy who will stick up for you regardless of his connection to you. You could be mean, horrible and nasty to him five minutes before, and he will be by your side if the tables were turned. If anything could be described as his fatal flaw, it would be that. But Kaden’s time at Camp Jupiter had shaped him into a harder person, while much of his personality remained the same he found a dark side in him that came out in extreme circumstances.\n\nPower/Abilities\n\nKaden inherited a number of powers from his father:\n\nPrecognition(Limited and Random), on very rare occasions Kaden has experienced very limited flashes of the future lasting almost as long as a blink, and nothing of importance.\n\nlimited control over sound waves and music, while this sounds like a cool power, Kaden hasn't quite figured out how it works. Not sure how you are supposed to control something you can't see. One of the things he has learned how to do is clap and cause a thunderous boom. Startling but relatively ineffective. He has learned to be able to render his step silent which has always been a plus, especially when sneaking around.\n\nLimited Photokinesis (ability to control light). The most he has ever been able to do is make a dim a light or make it brighter, nothing more.\n\nCan heal people by singing a hymn (Vitakinesis). Usually, his \"hymn\" is just a song he heard on the radio or a soft humming tune.\n\ncan cause rhyme based curses, a fun little trick that can render even the worst bully silent for a short time.\n\nKaden is an expert archer, a natural talent that presented itself the first time he picked up a bow.\n\nKaden has always been able to pick up an instrument and learn it relatively quick, the violin being his instrument of choice.\n\nMinerva Steel​\n\n“The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself\"\n\n[class=tabs] line-height: 1; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center; width: 100%; color: black; display: inline-block; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; [/class] [class=tab] box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline-block; padding: 10px 0; width: 45%; [/class] [class name=tab state=hover] background-color: grey; [/class] [script class=tab on=click] hide tabsContent set currentTab (getText) if (eq ${currentTab} Basics) (show tabsContentInformation) if (eq ${currentTab} Persona) (show tabsContentPersonality) if (eq ${currentTab} Powers) (show tabsContentAbout) if (eq ${currentTab} History) (show tabsContentOthers) [/script] [div class=tabs][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: auto\"]Basics\n\n[div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"]Persona[/div][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"\"]Powers[/div][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"]History[/div][/div]\n\n[div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentInformation\"]\n\nbasic information:\n\nName: Minerva Steel\n\nNickname: Minnie\n\nAge: Seventeen\n\nGender: Female\n\nBirthday: 24th June\n\nChild of: Poseidon\n\nSexuality: Bisexual\n\nHeight: 5'3\"\n\nlikes: Old movies, Swimming, Reading, Astronomy, Daisies, Candies shaped like stars, cocktails that taste like candy, working out, Gymnastics, Lakes.\n\ndislikes: Wet socks, Fully white rooms e.g. Hospitals, Sand, Cucumber, Rats, ”moist”, the idea of suffocating, frogs, Caramels, Sticky textures, The ocean.\n\nFears/Phobias: Claustrophobia, Suffocation\n\nQuotes:\n\n☆ \"Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You're gonna love it.\"\n\n☾ “Hey, Jr. If you’re looking for the pony rides they are back there”\n\n☆ \"But who wants an easy life? It's boring\"\n\n☾ \"If I could run across the beach into my own arms, I would.\"\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentPersonality\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\npersona:\n\npersonality:\n\nPlayful, Confident, Resourceful, Blunt, Flirtatious, Quick-tempered\n\nMinerva prides herself on her inventiveness and creativity as well as her unique perspective and vigorous intellect. She loves patterns and spotting discrepancies between statements could be described as one of her hobbies which makes it a bad idea to lie to her. This also makes it kind of ironic as her words should always be taken with a grain of salt. It's not that she is lying, only that she has a habit of sharing thoughts not fully developed. She is also unafraid to stand up and speak her mind whenever she feels like something needs to be said.\n\nStrengths\n\nFlexibility:\n\nThis stems from practising gymnastics all her life. She can bend into all sorts of positions which comes in handy for many things. It also reduces the risk of injury because her muscles are more pliable. It also improves her athletic performance because she isn't as restricted by her body.\n\nStamina:\n\nOne of her most useful strengths is her ability to last through prolonged physical or mental effort. She has gained this through gruelling training and lots of hard work on her part. But it has come easier to her than most due to her always having a very active lifestyle.\n\nQuick thinker:\n\nMinnie has always excelled in high-pressure situations. She doesn't get choked up instead she gives herself a quick moment before coming up with ideas that can get rid of the problem. Though it was mainly used to get her out of tough situations.\n\nCreative:\n\nThis is another part of her that stems directly from her grandmother and her time spent with her. Her grandmother is an amazingly talented painter whose works have been displayed in the most prestigious art galleries. When visiting her grandmother they would often sit down with some paints and mess around with a canvas.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nADHD:\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. For Minnie, hers was always quite intense growing up causing her to be diagnosed quite early in life. They tried all sorts of things to treat it but nothing ever worked. Specifically, she has the Predominantly Hyperactive subgroup of ADHD so she can be quite well... Hyperactive.\n\nDyslexia:\n\nMinerva has always had difficulty reading and often got frustrated with 'letters jumping around the page'. Luckily for her, this was also caught early on but no matter how hard she tried she never did well with reading.\n\nMost ranged weapons - Bows:\n\nshe tried archery once and it didn't go well. She shot the instructor when she was aiming in front of her and he was right beside her. Never again.\n\nCompetitive:\n\nMinnie loves competitions and gets very into them. Sometimes a bit too into them as if someone challenges her she will destroy them\n\nFear of Saltwater:\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentAbout\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\nAbilities:\n\nWater Manipulation:\n\nThe user can create, shape and manipulate water, inorganic compound with liquid, gas (steam, water vapour), and solid (ice) states, including changing them from one state to other.\n\nHealing Water: The user can heal themselves or others by using water by absorbing water molecules and transfer medicament into the body at a molecular level or having water molecules to repair and regenerate damaged cells and molecules.\n\nLimitations\n\nExperience: Minnie is limited to her own experience. She can't just go out and make a giant tidal wave without practising first. When used against certain beings (like other sea deities) who have a superior will over water and can wrest control from the weaker one.\n\nLocation:\n\nIf she is in an area where there is no water or the water is not abundant she cannot use her powers. She also cannot control Saltwater well, due to her fear of it.\n\nExhaustion: :\n\nMinerva can quickly become tired after controlling large bodies of water. This causes her to need to rest for a while shortly afterwards.\n\nTemperature:\n\nIf she has turned ice to water and the temperature is at freezing point it takes lots of energy and focus in order to keep it liquid.\n\nWeapon(s): Twin daggers made of half Celestial bronze and half Adamantine. When not in use they are disguised as two rings.\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentOthers\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\nHerstory: Minnie had an interesting childhood. Unlike most children of the gods, she was raised by two parents, David and Mary. Well, she was raised by a mother and a stepfather, who didn’t know he was a stepfather. Her mother had an affair while on holiday. She had met a strong fisherman who was Posideon in disguise and just couldn’t help herself.\n\nWhen she returned home to her husband she never thought of the fisherman That was until she fell pregnant with his baby. He came to her again and explained to her what he was and the danger that their child would be in. So they came up with a plan. Mary would pretend that the baby was her stepfathers. Then she and David would move to the beach where the strong smell of the sea would disguise Minnie’s true nature.\n\nEverything was fine for a long while. Minerva was born and she looked just like her mother. So her David had no reason to doubt her story. They lived happily in a little beach house. From the moment she could walk she was enrolled in things like gymnastics and swimming lessons. As she aged she went to a nearby school and had plenty of friends. Her childhood was the definition of normal.\n\nThen things took a turn for the worst. It happened a few months after her eighth birthday. Minnie had just got home from one of her gymnastic’s performance and had graduated to a more advanced class. So they decided to go down to the beach to celebrate. It was a hot day but there weren’t many people around. Her mother lay in the shallows soaking up some sun while she and David played in the waves. She looked back to her mum to yell something to her but she was gone. She found this strange but shrugged it off assuming she had gone inside to grab something.\n\nSo they continued to enjoy the water until she spotted something weird. There was someone floating on their stomach a little ways away from them. So they did what anyone would do and swam closer to check on them. As they got closer they noticed that the water around the person was red, too red. When her stepfather flipped the person over she felt a wave of nausea hit her. It was her mother but her eyes were wide open and lifeless. She threw up in the water when she saw her stomach which had been torn open.\n\nHer stepfather took a step towards her but then he was gone too. Something pulled him under the waves. Minnie dived under the waves in an attempt to see what was going on. When she spotted David there was a large shadow behind him. She couldn’t make out what it was with the salt water burning her eyes and blurring her vision. But she could see enough to tell the water was turning red as they thing shook her father around like a ragdoll.\n\nShe tried to swim towards him but a wave hit her hard. The water pulled her away from him almost like she was caught in a riptide. When she surfaced she was on a different beach. One with kids in orange camp shirts who approached her. They were obviously used to terrified kids stumbling into their camp. She appreciated the fact that they didn’t ask any questions and just took her to their infirmary. Where she proceeded to throw up all over a cute guy with dark hair. He didn’t seem to mind too much as he just wrapped her in a towel and asked her to wait there. She was relieved to have a moment to breathe. That was until she noticed two rings on her fingers that hadn't been their earlier. This filled her with more questions.\n\nThings did get better for Minerva. She found a new home at the camp which was called Camp Halfblood. They explained everything to her and why the event on the beach occurred. Although they couldn’t tell her what creature did it as she didn’t see it properly. She couldn’t bring herself to come to terms with her parent's death. Instead, she threw herself into training. She wanted to become a fierce warrior in order to prevent what happened to her from happening to others. She was claimed by her real father which made her feel a lot less alone in the world. She even started attending a nearby school while staying at the camp full time.\n\n[/div]\n\n[/div]\n\ncodedbycrucialstar | click boxes and hidden scrolls​\n\nEbner Finley — Age: 16\n\n— Gender: male\n\n— Birthday: august 22nd\n\n— Child Of: hades\n\n— Sexuality: pansexual\n\n— Quotes:\n\n\"You look like death.\"\n\n\"You have a bone to pick with me?\"\n\n— Height: 5'10\"\n\nScars/Tattoos: pale white scars down the length of his left forearm\n\n— Personality:\n\n➤Positive—playful, humorous, friendly, loyal, lighthearted\n\n➤Negative—stubborn, impulsive, carefree, insensitive\n\n— Likes: bad puns, knives, sushi\n\n— Dislikes: deep water, mornings, carrots\n\n— Strengths: close-range combat, durable, high stamina\n\n— Weaknesses: long-range combat, non-strategic, impulsive\n\n— History:\n\nEbner was born in Rochester, Minnesota. His mother, Adele Finley, was an archeologist. When she met Hades she was in Egypt, searching for tombs deep underground. During one of her breaks she met a fellow archeologist who called himself Howard and managed to charm him with her passion about her craft, and her knowledge of how different civilizations buried their dead. In only a few days Adele fell for him. What she failed to tell him, however, was that she was already married. The letters and postcards sent back to her husband in Minnesota never spoke of the affair. Adele spent all the time she could with Howard, and never had any intention of breaking off her romance with either of them.\n\nAt least until it all blew up in her face. Adele was already pregnant when she returned home. Her husband divorced her and left a week later. He refused any contact with her, and eventually, when she wouldn't leave him alone, filed a restraining order. Adele, the life she imagined crumbling all around her, sought out Howard. She planned her next expedition around the area they met and sent letters to his last known address, but he never answered. When she finally was able to return to Egypt, Ebner was two. By then, Adele's mental state was fragile. She ignored the advisement against bringing her son, ignored the catacombs she used to love, and instead she used her time to search for Howard, lugging Ebner along behind her. At one point, she turned off her phone. No matter where she looked and who she asked, Adele couldn't find a trace of Howard. And when she finally turned back on her phone, she found that she'd been fired.\n\nAdele spiraled. Eventually, she convinced herself that it would be better for both of them if they went to sleep. Permanently. She took Ebner to see the ocean, and then she tried to drown him in it. She held his arms so tight her nails left scars. It took several police men to wrangle her off him. Ebner was rushed to a hospital, and then released into the custody of the United States once they discovered his origin. He never found out what happened to his mother. Neither were the Egyptian officials ever able to explain the bones sticking through the ground in a ring around where Ebner was almost killed.\n\nOfficially, Ebner was handed off to foster care as soon as he stepped off the plane and was lost in the system. Unofficially, a satyr posing as his case worker escorted him to Camp Half-Blood. Fifteen hours after arriving, the symbol of Hades appeared over his head. Ebner has lived at camp year-round for eleven years.\n\n— Ability(s):\n\n●Necromancy\n\n—The power to raise and control the dead to fight for him. At the moment, he can only control three undead at a time. Any more and they won't obey him, follow his commands, or be convinced not to turn on him. He can't raise undead Romans (even their dead are stubborn), Egyptians (too tightly held by their death god), or those with Norse roots. Regular dead mortals with no faith though, are fair game.\n\n—The ability to sense the dead and when a living person is near death.\n\n—The power to curse a living soul, preventing them from leaving their body in death. Does not work on people or creatures with godly blood.\n\n●Osteokinesis\n\n—The power to telekinetically manipulate bones. When he's nervous/scared bones sprout out of the ground around him.\n\n●Umbrakinesis\n\n—The power to shadow travel. The more people he travels with, the shorter the distance he can travel. As shadow-traveling uses all of his stamina, he uses it very rarely, and would only break it out in an absolute emergency. If he doesn't pass out from the effort he would be useless in combat.\n\n—The power to absorb and redirect darkness. Works best at night or in low-lighting. He can redirect the darkness he absorbs to temporarily blind his opponent. Not effective on children of Ares, Apollo, and other light-dealing/dark-dealing demigods.\n\nWeapon(s):\n\nBonecutter—A celestial bronze, double-edge spear.\n\nCelestial bronze dagger he keeps strapped to his left ankle, hidden beneath his pant leg.\n\nFears/Phobias: Aquaphobia, he can't swim.\n\nOther: N/A​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n“Sunlight paints their skin, dips their fingers in gold. Apollo’s children are the warmth of a new day, their hands create exquisite worlds within their art, their lips enchanting with words; poetic, lyrical, melodic.”\n\n​\n\n[div class=container][div class=bgimg]\n\n[div class=open][div class=opentext] [/div][/div][/div]\n\n[div class=textbg][/div][div class=textbox]\n\nAlina Soleil\n\nNicknames: Li, Lina\n\nAge: 18\n\nGender: Female\n\nBirthday: February 21st\n\nChild Of: Apollo\n\nSexuality: Pansexual\n\nHeight: 5’7”\n\nWeight: 134lbs\n\nScars/Tattoos: None\n\n“Glowing skin is always in.”\n\nPersonality:\n\nAs clichiè as it sounds Alina can be described as a literal ray of sunshine. She is an outgoing young woman who always seems to have a smile on her face and bright eyes. Alina is a lover of the arts, from music, to painting, and theatre she loves them all. A little on the shy side it takes some time for Alina to warm up to others. Once she is used to you a different part of her comes to light. She’s affectionate and at times invades others personal space without realizing it. Alina is a loyal person who would do anything for those that she cares about. She’s someone who loves to laugh and entertain. Alina has a talent when it comes to cheering others up. Alina is someone who doesn’t take criticism well. She can be described as a perfectionist.\n\nLikes: Sunbathing, The arts, Writing, Dogs, Singing, Tea, Honeysuckle\n\nDislikes: Cold weather, Bitter foods, Cats, Rain, Doing nothing, Judgemental people\n\nStrengths:\n\nAthletic - Alina has a vast history in sports ranging from cheerleading to basketball. Because of this she has a great amount of muscle and stamina.\n\nRanged Weapons - As a daughter of Apollo Alina is an expert archer. She is also talented when handling other ranged weapons.\n\nObservant - Alina has a skill of noticing things that most people don’t. She’s excellent when it comes to reading people and situations.\n\nWekanesses: (3+)\n\nHand to hand combat - While she has been trained to fight Alina prefers to use her weapons. Because of this she is not that skilled in hand to hand fighting.\n\nSensitive - Alina is someone who doesn’t take criticism well. This usually leads to her doubting herself and making mistakes at the worst times.\n\nDarkness - Alina has a terrible fear of the dark. When surrounded by complete darkness she feels as if she’s suffocating and gets the chills.\n\n“Look at the bright side!”\n\nHistory:\n\nAlina was born in Marseille, France. A place known for its sunshine. She grew up in a single parent home with her mother, a well known poet and artist. Alina grew up in a loving and carefree house hold. Her mother being the laid back type, she was someone who loved spending time with her daughter and letting her express herself. The topic of her father was never that important to her, of course she’d asked and her mother had been completely honest.\n\nThe two of them had met in an art galary and had hit it off right away. It was not love that they had between them but they cared for one another or rather that’s what her mother thought before he up and left. Alina had no desire to meet the man that had abandoned them but little did she know that she’d have too.\n\nLike many demigod children when her powers emerged the monsters arrived. Alina’s mother ended up getting hurt trying to protect her, luckily a centaur who’d been disguised as a family friend helped them. From then on Alina was introduced to a whole new world. In the beginning in was difficult for her to adjust as she wanted nothing to do with her father and anything relating to him. Eventually Alina was able to open up and accept that part of herself, gaining friends and family along the way.\n\nAbility(s):\n\nVitakinesis - By singing a hymn to her father Alina is able to heal wounds. How fast the wounds heal depends on the type. For example, a small cute or stabs is easy for her to handle without any drawback. However, life-threatening wounds take more time and energy, it can be fatal as well.

If Nira aged she would be 39.\n\nBirthday: April 5th\n\nChild of: Apollo\n\nSexuality: Homosexual\n\nPersonality: Ever since Nira became a huntress she is down right rude to males until they prove their worth to her. When it comes to females though, even if they had never met before, she will be very friendly. In her huntress family she is a motherly figure and comes off as such. She will always take in those who need help (as long as they're female. It will take a lot for her to put a male under her care) and care for them like like they are her own children. Even though she is like a mother figure to her friends she has strong leadership skills and her people will look to her to lead when Artemis isn't there.\n\nLikes: Hunting, playing instruments, being in nature\n\nDislikes: Males, stubborn people, city life, those who look down on her and her people\n\nStrengths: Her archery skills, leadership because she is Apollos daughter she has excellent accuracy and is known for her healing remedies.\n\nWeaknesses: Doesn't like to take orders from men unless they have proven their worth. This can cause delays in collaborations. Closed spaces and hand to hand combat.\n\nFears/Phobias: Failing her fellow hunters, Claustrophobia\n\nHeight: 5'5\"\n\nHow she typically wears her hair.\n\nScars/Tattoos: crescent moon on the back of her neck. Nira got this soon after she joined the hunt.\n\nCherry Blossom tattoo on her right shoulder.\n\nCo\n\nNira was a camper at camp half-blood from 11 till she aged out. She returned back to the normal world to finish college and try and start a normal life. Unfortunately for demigods normal isn’t in their vocabulary. Nira finished college at 22. While there she met the love of her life and found a way to be involved with demigod affairs. By the time she got out of college her and her boyfriend were engaged. As for the demigod affairs, Nira would house demigods who needed a safe place while they were going to high school/college. Things were going great till they weren’t.\n\nOn her wedding day she was left at the altar. That day was when Nira joined the Huntresses of Artemis. Swearing off men wasn’t very hard for her after the love of her life left her like that. Being tired of the human world and the problems it would bring she joined the hunters at the age of 23. Even though some of the other hunters were technically older than her, due to her motherly instincts she became like a mother figure to the girls. With her father being Apollo and having training from camp half-blood Nira quickly moved up the ranks. She had great archery and leadership skill and with Artemis being her “Aunt” (After all her father was their Goddesses twin) others were accepting of it.\n\nWhen Astraeus starting causing havoc they could feel it affecting the forest. The animals were restless and the mythical creatures that Artemis would normally hunt were being hunted by titans. Artemis began to worry that her hunters would become targets as well. They were strong but not invincible. It was also Artemis’ duty to care for them. So even though Artemis didn’t like to get involved with olympian affairs she decided to send help to the camp. Since she didn’t want to risk sending too many hunter,Nira along with a few others were sent. . She had experience dealing with younger demigods and was also a strong hunter.\n\nExtreme Accuracy: Almost always hits her mark (Form being daughter of Apollo)\n\nHealing Hand: Can heal wound at the expense of her energy (I.e heal a minor wound will be tired, a large gash can make her pass out) (From being daughter of Apollo)\n\nCall of the Hunt: With the blow of a horn she can call her fellow huntresses to her side. Can be heard from any distance. (From being a Huntress of Artemis)\n\nNira is almost always carrying around her bow and quiver. Just in case she is caught in close combat she has a short sword.\n\nHas a pet fox that always follows her named Fèng (mean Phoenix)\n\nIf you don't chill out, you're going to pop a vein.\n\nDamian Westerian\n\nBasic\n\nName: Damian Westerian\n\nNicknames: N/A\n\nAge: 18\n\nGender: Male\n\nBirthday: July 24\n\nChild Of: Boreas\n\nSexuality: Asexual\n\nPhysiological/Psychological\n\nHeight: 5'10\n\nScars/Tattoos: He has a nasty gash from a werewolf's claws on his back\n\nPersonality: Straightforward, Blunt, Observant, Respectful, Quick-Witted, Lazy\n\nDamian is a straightforward person. What you see is what you get. He hides no secrets, and withholds no information. He is very honest, too honest, and comes off as a little insensitive. He doesn't seem to mind the opinion of others. People say he's a bad person? Then let them think that way. He finds it a waste of energy to even try to change their opinions. On that note, he seems to be a pretty lazy person, always claiming that he only wants to do things that aren't a waste of his energy since he claims that he has a low energy reservoir, though no one doubts this excuse since he rarely gets a good night's sleep. He respects authority but his tone when speaking to them is usually casual, if not his normal one. He has a habit of yawning every now and then, probably from the lack of sleep.\n\nAlthough he does not seem like it, he is a sharp kid, able to deduce a lie from the liar's face and tone of voice. Because of his condition and paranoia, he is often stressed. However, he had reached the point where he just seems relaxed when there's incoming room towards him.\n\nLikes: Winter, Cold Climates, The Truth, Heights, Windy Days, Rain\n\nDislikes: His Insomnia, Hot Climates, Lycanthropes, Liars, Betrayals, Nightmares\n\nStrengths:\n\nStrategic - In every situation, Damian is already drafting his plan of attack. He always takes his surroundings and needs to know what's to his advantage and what's to his disadvantage. He plans escape routes whenever he enters an unfamiliar area. He does all of this with the most passive look on his face. Even in normal situations, he is always planning but he rarely has to use any of his plans in conversations.\n\nPower Control - Damian has an excellent grasp on his powers and uses them to his full advantage. Because of his relative frequent use of them, he doesn't easily get tired from their usage and knows how to use them in combat well.\n\nReaction Speed - Damian has an excellent reaction speed despite looking so lazy all the time. This combined with being observant makes him a pretty damn good fighter.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nParanoid - Lack of sleep can sometimes do that to you. And when you sleep, you dream of nightmares. Plus you lost a guardian to strangers. Damian slowly became more and more paranoid, so much so that he became very suspicious of people. He trusts his campmates, he does, but he sometimes doubts them. He tries not to but it's hard to keep your head straight when your mind keeps telling you that you're in constant danger.\n\nSleepy - Damian is almost always in a constant state of sleepiness and alertness. It is very taxing on his body when it won't relax. That's why he seems to be tired all the time. In the rare times that he feels like he can relax, he often falls asleep at these times. One should be careful to keep him awake at all times if it's too dangerous and his body decides to crash.\n\nFollower - Damian was never the type to take the lead nor does he think he can. Most of his strategies center around himself and he can rarely make strategies for anyone else. He can give suggestions but will never willingly take the lead.\n\nBackstory\n\nBackstory:\n\nDamian's birth was completely accidental. It was one of the rare times when Boreas descended to the mortal plane to check on the humans of Quebec, enjoying what little free time he had for now. It was winter at that time and his daughter, Khione, was doing an excellent job in actually keeping the climate cool for the week. While he was strolling around, he had met Anne Westerian, a beautiful model who was, at that time, heavily intoxicated after a drink out with friends. Boreas decided to help the poor girl out and before he knew it, he was seduced and had a child with her. Anne was just as shocked as Boreas as she never planned for any of this to happen. She apologized profusely to the man, thinking that he was just that, a man. Boreas easily forgave her and admitted his own mistake, but also apologized for having to leave her despite the heavy burden he placed on her. Anne made a deal with Boreas - that she would take care of the child as repentance for her sin.\n\nAnd so Damian was born. While it was accidental, Anne loved him greatly. She was making enough money with her modelling job despite the fact that she has already given birth since she still had a beautiful figure even after that. When he was just a baby, Boreas appeared once more and had a serious talk with Anne and explained to her just exactly what he was. Anne surprisingly took it well as she claimed to have 'felt something odd' when she was with him. Then Boreas continued to explain that Damian had a high chance of inheriting some of his power, just like how Khione and the brothers had. After the talk, he had disappeared once more to tend to his daily duties.\n\nWhen Damian reached the age of nine, his mother was diagnosed with a rare terminal illness that would most likely kill her. He was very affected by this as he only had her as his family since he never knew who his father was. He started to help out around town to get pocket change in hopes that it would help his mother; little by little, he began to earn. As two years passed by, it became apparent that Anne would most likely die. And so Anne did what she thought was best, she told Damian everything - from how he was born to who his father was. Of course, he was originally baffled by this, thinking that it was the failed medicine taking a toll on her. But then Anne mentioned a camp where he would be taken care of and she made him promise to go there. Anne had died when he was 12 years of age.\n\nAnd so, before anyone could come for him, Damian made his way to get to this camp she was talking about. She had left him money to complete the trip there but, of course, he encountered many problems. Monsters were out for his blood but those, he had managed to avoid. Bursts of power had allowed him to at least be a bit more protected and he just had to run. Oh no, his problem was actually the humans that surround him. After all, this was a child who had money. Vulnerable. He could not count how many times people tried to con him but he was a smart kid.\n\nA satyr came to him halfway through his travel. Harv, he said his name was, and he was the guide to Camp Half-Blood. Damian was suspicious at first but relented when Harv seemed to he very knowledgeable about said camp. Harv told him that he was a pain to track but at least they were together now. Comforting. He hasn't had an ally in quite a while aside from the very few good samaritans. So they made their way to the camp with Harv taking care of protection.\n\nHarv didn't make it. Damian couldn't remember what happened, or rather he had suppressed his memories about it.\n\nNevertheless, he trekked on to the camp his mother was talking about. And then he entered Camp Half-Blood. It was a good thing he had a cabin to live in. Apparently it apparently relatively new and it wasn't as big as the others. But he highly enjoyed the camp and was pretty much ecstatic when he was properly claimed by Boreas and was given a Imperial Gold sabre. Ever since then, he's been training in Camp Half-Blood and learning more about demigods and his father.\n\nIn one of the quests he went in, he had a run-in with the lycanthropes. There were only two of them but neither Damian nor his two other companions had anything to harm them. They booked it out of there but the lycanthropes tracked them down every time they escaped. They had stumbled into one of the cooking shops where there were silverware which they then used to injure the lycanthropes. They retreated but they were badly injured. This caused Damian to always carry around a silver knife.\n\nCombat\n\nAbility:\n\nAerokinesis - He has some power over the wind, allowing him to use it to levitate/fly. However he's still practicing when it comes to using with fine tuning as he can only summon large bursts of wind.\n\nCryokinesis - His only offensive magic. He has control over snow and ice, just like his father, and is able to create mini-snowstorms in exchange for his energy. He can create ice objects by freezing the air around him and send waves of ice shards towards an enemy - though as stated, this would sap his energy. Though he has trouble freezing things that generate heat, considering that... well, they are generating heat. If he touches the object long enough, it will begin to freeze. Perhaps even give another human frostbite, but he isn't too sure about it as he never tried it.\n\nFrench Fluency - Because of his father being based in Quebec, he has also gained the ability to understand French without a problem. He is also able to speak it.\n\nLimitation:\n\nHeat - While his ice does not melt as easily as normal ice, it can still be melted with enough time. And if he tries to freeze something that generates heat, it would take a lot more energy.\n\nEnergy - While he has trained himself to keep up his stamina whenever he uses these, there will still be a time where he crashes and burns.\n\nCombat - His aerokinetic abilities aren't very combat oriented\n\nMoisture - He can't freeze water when water doesn't exist so if the area isn't humid, he would have a harder time generating any snow or ice.\n\nWeapon(s):\n\nImperial Gold Sabre: A gift from his father when he entered camp along with being claimed. It is made of Imperial Gold which greatly helps in his expeditions. In its dormant form, it is a necklace with a smaller version of it as its centerpiece. When he takes it off, it turns into the full-sized and deadlier version. When he loses it, it magically comes back around his neck. He still hasn't figured out how that happens.\n\nAfter a certain run-in with some lycanthropes, Damian began to carry around a silver dagger that is hidden on his back, underneath his jacket. He had asked the those in the Hephaestus cabin to make it for him, a special request so to speak.\n\nFears/Phobias:\n\nLosing those he cares about\n\nNot being able to fully control his powers and accidentally hurt someone\n\nNon-humid areas (his paranoia spikes up when he can't use his powers)\n\nExtra\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I've achieved the point of stress where I only feel calm and chill.\"\n\n\"When you enter an area, make sure you know every and all exits.\"\n\n\"Please, I haven't slept in two days. Let me sleep for five more minutes.\"\n\nExtra:\n\nDamian radiates an aura of coldness much like his other half-siblings. Being close to him would equate to standing in a freezer. People tend to keep their distance because of this.\n\nRelations:\n\n“A whisper as they pass, a mischievous laugh, the barely there echo of their winged feet, and the lightening of your pockets as they make use of their sticky fingers. Cunning, swift, and precise, these demigods share their father’s quick-wits and fast feet.”\n\n​\n\n[div class=container][div class=bgimg]\n\n[div class=open][div class=opentext] [/div][/div][/div]\n\n[div class=textbg][/div][div class=textbox]\n\nJavin Daniels\n\nNicknames: J, JD\n\nAge: 17\n\nGender: Male\n\nBirthday: January 23rd\n\nChild Of: Mercury\n\nRank: Legionnaire\n\nCohort: Fifth\n\nSexuality: Demisexual\n\nHeight: 5’11”\n\nWeight: 160lbs\n\nScars/Tattoos: Variery of scars from his childhood | SPQR with 6 lines | Tattoo of a Caduceus\n\n“Can’t help doing sneaky things.”\n\nPersonality: Mischievous and cunning by nature, Javin is someone who’s intentions are never really clear when dealing with others. There are times when people believe that they’ve finally come to know him only for him to reveal a whole new side of himself. Javin is someone who loves a good prank, whether it’s pulled on him or on someone else it doesn’t matter.\n\nJavin is a carefree person for the most part. He isn’t one who cares about how others think of him, in fact he’s great at letting things roll off his back. Being told what to do or forced to do something isn’t his style. In fact it makes him even more rebellious. He does however know when to follow the leader, even though me might complain along the way. Javin is a lover of money and making money. He has a really eye for that sort of thing. Luck seems to always been on his side when it comes to the dough.\n\nLikes: Traveling, Being active, Pranks, Coffee, Friendly competition\n\nDislikes: Boredom, Cats, Losing, Bossy people\n\nStrengths:\n\nPhysically Fit, Cunning, Stealthy\n\nWekanesses: (3+)\n\nRebellious, Stubborn, Impatient\n\nHistory:\n\nJavin grew up with a rather strict household, which is surprising given his penchant for pranks and his sticky fingers. Javin’s mother worked as a banker and her husband was a house husband. With a younger brother and sister Javin was always sort of looked over, not that he minded. It only meant that he wouldn’t be nagged for doing what he wanted. Javin was a rebellious child who would often get into trouble for things like pulling pranks and conning people. His mother tried to put a stop to it but failed many times. As he got older he got worse but was able to hide his deeds much better, his mother and Dave believed that he’d gotten better.\n\nThings changed when he turned eleven and his mother decided that it was time for him to learn about his father. Instead of telling him she brought him to a building where he was judged and thought to be worthy. After reaching the camp Javin was taken back, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Though after a while Javin threw himself in head first and under their guidance he thrived, becoming a strong warrior in the process.\n\nJavin found a new home and family, each year he returned to make new memories with his kin and friends that he’d gained. When the camp was attacked Javin was ready to defend his camp like all the rest and while he survived he lost friends and family. Javin isn't sure but he has yet to come across any of his half-siblings.\n\n“Let’s race.”\n\nAbility(s):\n\nEnhanced Theft Abilities - Javin can pick pocket and steal from the most observant individuals without being noticed.\n\nClauditiskinesis - Javin can sense the internal structure and mechanisms of any lock he touch, and is able to make it unlock, even telekinetically. He can identify is a lock is cursed and has traps in place.\n\nEnhanced Speed - Javin is extremely fast and at max speed he becomes a blur to the eyes.\n\nLimitation(s):\n\nCursed Locks - Javin cannot pick a lock if it is curse, he can only identify the type curse.\n\nMax Speed - When running at his top speed it’s hard for Javin to make sudden turns. His speed will decrease as a result.\n\nWeapon(s):\n\nGladius & Bipennis made from imperial gold\n\nShield made from imperial gold\n\nFears/Phobias:\n\nLoss of Autonomy - Javin has a fear of becoming permanently paralyzed.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n[/div]\n\n​\n\n[/div]\n\n⠀♡coded by uxie♡\n\n[class=container] height:400px; width:320px; margin:auto; position:relative; overflow:hidden; [/class] [class=textbg] height:400px; width:320px; background:url('https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/8b/fc/648bfc43c4758228fb66a458badef9ad.jpg'); background-size:130%; opacity:0.3; position:absolute; top:0px; left:-1px; [/class] [class=textbox] height:390px; width:310px; position:absolute; top:0px; left:0px; overflow-y:scroll; padding:5px; [/class] [class name=textbox] font-size:12px; text-align:justify; color:black; [/class] [class=bgimg] height:400px; width:320.5px; position:absolute; left:-0.5px; background:url('https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/af/70/e8af709e51ff8bc0bfbc9719faf4a052.jpg'); background-size:101%; z-index:6; [/class] [class=open] height:70px; width:70px; border:5px solid #clear; background-color:clear; border-radius:50%; margin:auto; position:relative; top:140px; opacity:0.95; cursor:pointer; z-index:6; [/class] [class=opentext] font-size:30px; color:#92dba5; text-align:center; position:relative; top:12.5px; z-index:6; [/class] [script class=open on=click] addClass slideUp1 bgimg addClass slideUp2 open [/script] [class=slideUp1] animation-name: {post_id}slideUp; animation-duration:1.7s; animation-fill-mode:forwards; [/class] [class=slideUp2] animation-name: {post_id}slideUp; animation-duration:5.7s; animation-fill-mode:forwards; [/class] [animation=slideUp] [keyframe=0] transform: translateY(0px); [/keyframe] [keyframe=100] transform: translateY(-450px); [/keyframe] [/animation]\n\nDesdemona Bloom​\n\n“If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.\"\n\n[class=tabs] line-height: 1; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center; width: 100%; color: black; display: inline-block; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; [/class] [class=tab] box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline-block; padding: 10px 0; width: 45%; [/class] [class name=tab state=hover] background-color: grey; [/class] [script class=tab on=click] hide tabsContent set currentTab (getText) if (eq ${currentTab} Basics) (show tabsContentInformation) if (eq ${currentTab} Persona) (show tabsContentPersonality) if (eq ${currentTab} Powers) (show tabsContentAbout) if (eq ${currentTab} History) (show tabsContentOthers) [/script] [div class=tabs][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: auto\"]Basics\n\n[div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"]Persona[/div][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"\"]Powers[/div][div class=tab style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: auto; margin-right: auto\"]History[/div][/div]\n\n[div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentInformation\"]\n\nbasic information:\n\nName: Desdemona Bloom\n\nNicknames: Mona, Clover\n\nAge: Sixteen\n\nGender: Female\n\nBirthday: September 26th\n\nChild Of: Fortuna\n\nRank: Senator and Centurion of the first cohort\n\nSexuality: Hetrosexual\n\nHeight: 5’7”\n\nScars/Tattoos: SPQR, Five lines, and Her mothers symbol the Cornucopia.\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentPersonality\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\npersona:\n\nStrong-willed, Cold, Loyal, Distrustful, Steadfast, Strict, Opinionated, Wise.\n\nLikes: Knife throwing, Routine, Bees, Clovers, Good listeners, Hot chocolate, Berries, Clouds, The Ocean, Combat.\n\nDislikes: Small talk, Milk, Emotions, Weak-willed people, Troublemakers, Tea, Crybabies, Peas, Honey, Spiders.\n\nStrengths:\n\nCombat, Stealth, Knife throwing, Brave, Teamwork, Inteligent.\n\nWeaknesses: Larger weapons, Cocky, Slow to trust, Stubborn.\n\nFears/Phobias:\n\nSurvivors Guilt/Being alone:\n\nThe idea of being the only one to survive a battle or the only hero to return from a quest alive terrifies her.\n\nArachnophobia - Spiders\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentAbout\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\nAbilities:\n\nLuck:\n\nThe ability to be lucky. Is notably luckier than other individuals, good things happen more often. Random chances often tilt to her favour.\n\nTychokinesis\n\nManipulates the probability of an event happening. Using this they can cause and prevent both good and bad luck, within other people.\n\nLimitations\n\nControl:\n\nShe has literally no control over her luck power, so what happens is just random. Because of this, there is always a possibility that it might not work. Or work in a way that isn't ideal.\n\nEmotions:\n\nIf she's too caught up in her emotions then it's unlikely for her to be able to focus enough energy to be able to use the power. It can also cause her to accidentally cast bad luck when trying to cast good.\n\nExperience:\n\nThe number of times this ability can be used within a short period of time depends on the users experience which in her case is not very much. The Romans were a lot more focused on honing natural abilities like swordplay rather than power based abilities. It also takes a lot of energy to effectively put in practice. The less likely an event is to happen the easier she tires out which means having to rest longer before doing it again.\n\nWeapon(s): A set of Imperial gold throwing knives that are kept strapped to her thigh.\n\n[/div] [div class=\"tabsContent tabsContentOthers\" style=\"display: none;\"]\n\nHerstory:\n\nDesdemona lived the life of a true Roman. Her father, Derek had attended camp before her as a legacy of Mars. He was brave but also appreciated the finer things in life. Her father never did tell her how he met her mother. Only that she was a lovely woman but it was just a one-off thing. Then a few months later she gifted him the light of his life, her.\n\nBecause he was a retired legionnaire she grew up in new Rome. Being surrounded by other demigods as she grew up was an amazing thing. She never felt out of place because everyone was like her. Since Derek was a well-known hero it was obvious from the start that she would follow in his footsteps. From the moment she could hold a pen she was being taught to fight. Preparing her for the world of horrors she was bound to face if she was to follow in his footsteps.\n\nDesdemona certainly made her dad proud. She was taken in by the first cohort, who only took in the best. Then she was only on probatio for a few days after joining as she quickly proved herself. During rebuilding, there was an accident and the roof started to cave in. They were told to evacuate but someone had gotten stuck. Unable to get them out of the crumbling building she shielded her fellow camper with her body. The luck powers kicking in and protecting the two of them.\n\nShe had been with the legion for five years and a Centurion for three. Now everything she knew was destroyed.

She’s a fast learner, and tends not to make mistakes a second time if she can avoid it. She’s skillful with her weapons and quick to make a remark. Other than that, she tends to resemble a daughter of Ares than Athena. She’s more hot headed and temperamental than her siblings, and can be quick to judge others. She can be brash and is very competitive. She’s more of a fighter, and while capable creating excellent strategies, she tends to forget them in the heat of the moment causing her to lose focus at times at what’s important.\n\nShe’s a capable fighter, having a natural affinity with weapons and sparring, and it's not unusual to see her training for the next opponent whether they be a demigod or monster. Because of this, she hopes to become a Hunter of Artemis in her future, but is held back by the permanence of their vow. She’s very loyal to those closest to her, and tends to be wary of outsiders, but is willing to give them a chance.\n\nBased on first impressions, she has a strong confidence in her fighting skills, potential and intelligence, even though she tends to get ahead of herself more often than not. She’s not quick to work with her peers and prefers to work by herself. Her self-reliance tends to land her in trouble and more often than not tends to work against her favor.\n\nDespite this, she’s naturally protective of others. While competitive and forceful, she’s generally open to others and at least willing to give them an opportunity. She has strong relationships with her friends and siblings, and would do anything to protect them.\n\nLikes:\n\n- Weapons training and maintenance\n\n- Learning about various self defense techniques\n\n- Taking the occasional walk around the lake\n\n- Trying out new foods\n\n- Pegasi classes\n\n- Capture the flag\n\n- Secretly, romance novels\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Having to sit still for long periods of time\n\n- Losing\n\n- Being bed bound\n\n- Having nothing to do\n\n- Water\n\nStrengths:\n\nFighting Skills: As stated earlier, she’s a promising fighter with an affinity towards short range weapons. She’s a up close and personal fighter whose quick to think of her feet and is useful as support. At times, she can be seen using guns, but these tend to be rare moments as she’s not the best at accuracy. She’s quick to pick up new skills, though she doesn’t spend much time focusing on perfecting them. But given a weapon, she can manage to defend herself capably. Armina is also trained in intermediate self defense, and enjoys learning about various styles of fighting as well as reading as much as she can about them.\n\nIntelligence: Armina is intelligent, but more often than not focuses on things that interest her personally. While she doesn’t have the patience for traditional school subjects, she’s quick to pick up on new skills and concepts. She’s a quick thinker and adaptable and generally is at ease with her surroundings. She may create strategies, but she’s capable of changing them at a moment’s notices preferring not to rely on them.\n\nProtective: Armina at times has a tendency to be protective of others, especially those younger or perceived weaker than her. She’s good with the younger children at camp and helps to push them into whatever they need to survive though she can get a bit overzealous. She has a very strong sense of family with those closest to her and will defend them at all costs.\n\nWekanesses:\n\nIndependant: Armina’s independence is a double edged sword. While she’s a capable opponent, she doesn’t like to rely on others. Because of this and her aspiration to become a Hunter of Artemis, she tends to but heads quickly. She’s not really a team player, often forming her own plans without voicing them leading her to either fail or using others as stepping stones.\n\nArrogance/Pride: She’s very prideful with her skills as a demigod. Because of this, she tends to get in over her head at times and is too often stubborn to admit a wrongdoing.\n\nOverconfidence: Armina knows she’s a strong fighter in the making and because of this she tends to overestimate her skills.\n\nHistory:\n\nNot much is to be said of her history, other than she’s spent most of her life at CHB. She doesn’t have a lot of interaction with the mortal world other than the trips they take to the city. A satyr brought her to camp shortly after 5th birthday after the sudden passing of her father on the request of her mother. Other than that, Armina hasn’t spoken or seen much of her mother after her father’s death.\n\nHer father died suddenly due an encounter with a monster, and with the injuries sustained from the attack, Armina lost her right arm. She doesn’t have any other family, except for her siblings as her father was more a scholar and prefered to isolate himself to his studies.\n\nWith an Hephaestus cabin made prosthetic for her left arm, she began her life as a year rounder at camp. Which allowed her to begin her training early.\n\nAbility(s):\n\n- Armina has an excellent memory. She’s capable of remembering entire conversations and chapters in books.\n\n- Multi-Focus - she’s able to consciously focus on multiple people as well as her environment at once. This allows her to be hyper aware of almost everything around her even when she’s fighting.\n\n- Enhanced Wisdom - While the use of this particular ability is rare to happen to her, it allows her to momentarily grant her the a deeper understanding or realization of the available knowledge to her and the people around her. This then allows her to make the best calculated and logical decisions at that time.\n\nLimitation(s):\n\nHer powers are activated on her ability to focus. Coupled with her personality and the lack of usual level-headedness often found in her siblings, she doesn’t use her powers as often as other demigods.\n\nHer concentration has to be that a single minded focus, similar to tunnel vision. Her concentration can be broken by loud, unexpected sounds or pain. Thus, causing her to lose whatever concentration she had and whatever power she was about to use.\n\nBeing a demigod, she isn’t a stranger to the occasional injury. The prosthetic on her left arm at times causes her to have fits of phantom pain at times. While not debilitating, it can be uncomfortable and at times leaves her unable to use her arm for a short while until it passes.\n\nWeapon(s):\n\n- A celestial bronze sword as her primary weapon.\n\n- A celestial bronze dagger\n\n*These are the weapons she carries around most of the time.\n\nFears/Phobias:\n\nArmina’s main fear is being unable to protect herself and her loved ones. Her father’s death is something that still terrifies her, and though she won’t admit it her push to train herself to be better is an effort to not let another person she loves die horrifically.\n\nShe’s also terrified of large bodies of water. She doesn’t enjoy swimming and while an adequate swimmer, she refuses to swim in places such as lakes or beaches as she tries to avoid any sea monsters that might attack her while vulnerable.\n\nOther:\n\nShe’s has a bionic prosthetic for her arm which is made from celestial gold. It’s often refitted by courtesy of the Hephaestus cabin. She has a deep understanding of the maintenance required for her arm, but goes regularly for a check up. Because of this, it isn’t uncommon to see her a member of Cabin 9.\n\n​\n\nI wasn't serious when I said I didn't want to die yet damn it.\n\nLeona Charter\n\nBasic\n\nName: Leona Hayley Charter\n\nNicknames: Leo\n\nAge: 19\n\nGender: Female\n\nBirthday: November 2\n\nChild Of: Jupiter\n\nRank: Ex-Praetor, now the living dead\n\nCohort: 5th Cohort\n\nSexuality: Pansexual\n\nPhysiological/Psychological\n\nHeight: 5'9\n\nScars/Tattoos: She has a gaping hole around an inch and a half in diameter where the metal pole had pierced her in. It is located on her abdomen area. Aside from that, she has a multitude of scars that were collected from various quests but nothing too absurd. She has an SPQR tattoo on her left wrist with ten lines.\n\nPersonality: Confident, Cynical, Fatalistic, Vengeful, Ambiverted\n\nLeona has been known to be rather foul-mouthed though she means no harms with her words. While she may insert an insulting joke or two matched with swear words, Leona does all of this in lighthearted fun because that's how she grew up. However, when the going gets tough, she knows how to be serious and polite. Due to the amount of time that she has accumulated in training, she is rather confident of herself and her abilities. While she is still relatively cheerful, Leona has become rather cynical. She's well aware of the circumstances of why she had survived despite the fact that she did not want it in the first place. This has resulted in her fatalistic tendencies where she simply doesn't care too much of her own well-being as she knows she would die as soon as Mors comes back.\n\nLikes: Warmth, Peace, Friends, War Games, Thunderstorms, Baking\n\nDislikes: Not being dead yet, Bland Food, Nightmares, Memories of the massacre\n\nStrengths:\n\nFighter - Leona has been well known for her fighting prowess and instinct in the battlefield. Utilizing both sword and lightning in a terrifying combination, Leona unleashed upon the battlefield is a force to be reckoned with. And she's the type to fight until her dying breath unless ordered otherwise.\n\nObservant - Part of being a fighter is predicting how your opponent will react. Leona has studied body movement to know what will happen and react accordingly. She has adapted this to non-combative situations so that she will be able to aid when someone is in distress. She's been known to take soldiers off the battlefield when she sees them getting too tired to be able to proceed even though they might not realize it.\n\nWeapon Expertise - Leona is a quick learner. When you give her a weapon and teach her the basics, you can expect her to train with it until she knows how to properly wield it for maximum efficiency.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nLack of Self-Preservation - Learning that she cannot die, not when Mors is incapacitated, Leona has become more reckless in her actions. Her fighting became more aggressive and less strategic. While she still does try to avoid getting hit or stabbed, Leona has absolutely no qualms when she has to risk getting stabbed to win the fight.\n\nSecretive - Leona doesn't tell anyone of her own problems or problems that she thinks she can solve herself so as to not burden anyone else. She will hide wounds if she thinks that she can handle it alone. With her tendency of simply not caring, Leona has come to the point where you would have to approach her to see if she's in need of any medication and assistance.\n\nPTSD - The war had adverse effects on Leona. Especially when you were the only survivor among so many dead, and the fact that she was left behind, Leona seemed to have garnered PTSD. Nightmares come more frequently to her. Reminders of it leads her to an agitated state or would make her draw into herself. This is her most vulnerable state and it can trigger any time considering that the war was still going on.\n\nBackstory\n\nBackstory: Leona had led a normal life at first. Never knowing her father, Leona clung to her mother for the entirety of their time together. They were close, very close. Her mother never talked about her father so Leona had brushed it off as nothing. She understood from a young age that even if she didn't have a father, they would be absolutely fine. Her mother worked tirelessly as the owner of a rather famous bakery. Her love for baking came from here. However, when she was nine, her mother met a terrible accident. Leona couldn't remember if it was a car accident or she was mugged inside the car but she did remember that child services were coming for her. They took her to a temporary home where they would return the next day for her.\n\nThey did not find Leona the next day.\n\nThe girl had escaped and found herself being guided by a group of wolves (she couldn't remember if it was just a figment of her imagination of Lupa's doing). She reached the Wolf House. Despite being young, Lupa trained her all the same. Her natural fighting instincts had impressed Lupa and after a few months of training and passing her test, she was ordered to go to Camp Jupiter. She had no problem in finding the Camp Jupiter where she spent a year as a probatio as per normal and placed in the Fifth Cohort. Leona was relentless as she worked her way up to the ranks - leadership quality present, she was assigned as the Centurion of the Fifth cohort by fourteen. But she had not stopped there as she once more rose through the ranks and became a praetor by sixteen.\n\nAstraeus had come knocking at their doorstep and everyone was unprepared for a titan. They had certainly tried their best to push the titan back but the sheer power that he contained simply could not be defeated. The issuance of a retreat was given. They can lose their land but not their people. Leona could not accurately tell you exactly what had happened but she can give you the gist of it. She had been hit and sent flying into rubble. A metal pole was jutting out of her abdomen, bleeding out. One of the centurions - Kaden - had attempted to help her but she knew she was doomed. Giving over her praetorship to him, she watched him leave with the remainder of the camp. As a last hoorah and to cover the tracks of her legion, she mustered all the energy she could and created a lightning storm sufficient enough to distract Astreaus before promptly passing out.\n\nDeath did not come for her.\n\nWaking up to pain and cold, Leona had found herself still very much alive. She pried herself out of the pole and collapsed onto the ground, pain coursing through her body. Leona knew she was supposed to be dead. No one could survive that. She knew no one could survive that. But here she was, breathing. In pain but alive. Leona began to stagger around the ruined camp. No one else was alive. She could only assume that whoever survived had already left and was halfway to Camp Half-Blood. She had considered just staying there and maybe death would come for her. But the mere thought of her legion still being out there drove her to stand.\n\nShe will get to Camp Half-Blood and aid them.\n\nCombat\n\nAbility:\n\nAerokinesis - Leona has the ability to control the winds. She had become powerful enough in this regard that she's been able to use them to push people back as well as lift herself and others in the process. The more weight she's trying to support, the harder it is so she tends to keep flying to only herself.\n\nAtmokinesis - Using enough energy, Leona has the ability to create a lightning storm. However, this is extremely draining and would, most likely, put her out of commission for a good few hours if used to an extent. She's tried it only twice before - once during a quest and the other during Astreaus's attack and both had left her drained and unable to fight any longer.\n\nElectrokinesis - She can generate static electricity and lightning bolts that she often uses in tandem with her fighting. Often seen blasting opponents that are too far to slash at or simply adding more effect to an attack by engraving lightning into her sword. She isn't foolish enough to use it continuously without break as it still takes her great energy to be able to control it but she could confidently say that she's, at the very least, adept in the usage of electrokinesis.\n\nLimitation:\n\nAtmokinesis - Leona has little experience with the usage of this particular power. So much so that she would avoid using it at all costs unless it's a last resort. This particular ability will leave her drained for hours, likely incapable of even doing basic functions aside from sleeping.\n\nAerokinesis - Carrying objects that are far heavier than herself puts a strain on her body and she prefers to fly alone. She has capped her limit to carrying two fully grown adults as well as herself. Any more and she would not be too capable of actually flying.\n\nEnergy - Despite her experience with it, continuous usage of her powers saps her energy. Strategic use for these is for the best.\n\nWeapon(s):\n\nImperial Gold Gladius - Standard weaponry for Roman Demigod Legionnaires. Strapped to her waist.\n\nImperial Gold Shield - Magically imbued so that it would not easily break. It turns into a stylish golden bracer when deactivated and she usually keeps it on her left arm. It glows in the dark when in shield form, making it a source of light though minimal.\n\nDouble Headed Spear - Half-Imperial Gold, Half-Adamantine, this spear was given to her after a successful yet risky quest that had propelled her to advance through the ranks. It collapses into a bracelet on her right wrist.\n\nSilver Hunting Knives - Two in total\n\nFears/Phobias:\n\nLoud noises\n\nNot dying even after Mors is released\n\nBeing left behind again\n\nExtra\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Death is the sweetest reprieve of them all. So can you fucking give me that sweet reprieve already!\"\n\n\"I'm gonna die anyway. Might as well go out with a blast.\"\n\n\"I've died and come back and I'm here to fuck shit up.\"\n\nRelations:\n\nAnd, like I said before, he wouldn't be punished directly by the praetors, but by his cohort's centurion.\n\nAppearance: (realistic, description, or realistic art)\n\nName: Stefan Hazelwood\n\nNicknames: Stef, Eros, Lover Boy\n\nAge: (15+) 19 years old\n\nGender: Male\n\nBirthday: November 14th\n\nRank: Probatio\n\nChild Of: Venus, the most beautiful woman in all the world\n\nSexuality:Bisexual\n\nQuotes: (optional)\n\n\"Perfect just comes easy for me. I'm bringing sexy back.\"\n\nHeight: Five foot six\n\nScars/Tattoos: A dove on his left shoulder blade, \"Perfect Isn't Easy\" on right shoulder blade.\n\nPersonality: (1 paragraph or bullet list)\n\n\"Oh, dear, must we really have this little chat? Well, if I must. Fellow campers would call me arrogant, but I think they're all just jealous of the blessings Mother has given me. But, if they actually take the time to get to know me, they'd see that I'm not such a bad guy, even though I'd go for anyone I'd deem worthy.\"\n\nLikes: (3+)\n\nFood, his own looks and the ladies as well and gentlemen, he also enjoys his modeling career, fashion shows, pageants (the only competition he enjoys)\n\nDislikes: (3+)\n\nGetting turned down, losing at anything, starting a conversation and getting dirty\n\nStrengths: (3+)\n\nhe's got a killer smile, He's a good friend to people that deserve it and he can get people out of a bind pretty easily...as long as he can control the Charmspeak\n\nHe's also an expert archer\n\nWeaknesses: (3+)\n\n1. Certain camp activities, specifically fighting. He's not a fighter\n\n2. It's hard to keep get and keep his attention if he's deadlocked on a romantic target\n\n3. He can't really control his Charmspeak yet. It's very sporadic.\n\nHistory: Stefan grew up in Detroit with his father who also acted as his manager after getting discovered as a young child when his father took him out to an audition. Truthfully, he only got in by accidentally using Charmspeak without even realizing it. That was the first time he saw Venus, then disguised as one of his judges. She's the one who actually said yes, literally the only one. After a few more years and hundreds of first place trophies, crowns and sashes later, Stefan was exhausted and quite frankly bored to tears. He needed some decent competition. One night, after a drawn out argument with his father, Stefan decided to do one more show. Not surprisingly, he won...again. But something was off about the woman placing the sash on him. This woman seemed...familiar, and not just because of the whole modeling thing. The second her lips touched his cheek, Stefan could hear a baby crying and a woman's distraught sobbing. Deciding to ignore it for now, the boy took his winnings to his hotel room, leaving his dad and the woman alone together. The very next day, Stefan was woken up by one of his disgruntled competitors and taken to Camp Jupiter, where he's had his ass kicked pretty much every day because he refused to fight back.\n\nAbility(s): Charmspeak - He's still working out the kinks, such as focusing his mind on using it and not just using it automatically. He's actually conned his way out of things from taking out the trpposed to allow him to control what a person says or does. He likes the fact that he's able to score a treat from someone else every now and then, but in some situations, he feels it's a curse. He saw it used on a friend once and the friend ended up killing himself later. Stefan cannot control multiple people at once and has to either keep eye contact with the one person he is controlling or has to be able to see them. Once he jumps from one person to the next, the first person is then free of Stefan's control. He has yet to get people to do major things like force them to use their own abilities, but Stefan has successfully avoided punishment by convincing his centurion that he was somewhere else. It's also extremely hard for Stefan to control those with a stronger will. His best bet in a battle out in the world (not against another camper, god, etc.) would be to not let his opponent realize that he's Charmspeaking.\n\nWeapon(s): The sash Venus gave him actually transforms into a bow.\n\nFears/Phobias: Lightning, the dark, being alone.\n\n[class=picture] position: relative; display: inline-block; [/class] [class=text] position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; opacity: 0; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2); color: white; z-index: 2; [/class] [class name=text state=hover] opacity: 1; [/class] [div class=picture] [div class=text]\n\n\"I don't think I'm better than you, I know I am.\"\n\n[/div]​\n\n» BASIC INFORMATION;\n\nName: Mikhail Petrov (Михаи́л Петро́в)\n\nNickname: Missha (Ми́ша), Shy.\n\nAge: 17\n\nBirthday: 7th May\n\nGender: Male\n\nSexuality: Bisexual\n\nPhobias: Ochlophobia (Fear of crowds)\n\nChild of: Hecate\n\nHeight: 5'10\"\n\nTattoos: A small pentagram by his inner wrist.\n\n»PERSONA;\n\nPersonality:\n\nPositive: Eccentric || Humorous || Genius || Logical || Caring.\n\nNegative: Blunt || Cynical || Eccentric || Apathetic.\n\nLikes: Coffee, Astronomy, Eating whipped cream straight from the can (this is a regular occurrence), Painting.\n\nDislikes: Sleeping, Loud People, Anyone who calls him \"shy\", Big crowds and busy places.\n\nStrengths:\n\nLogical: Missha has always been more of a tactician than someone who uses strength. He’s quick and he can come up with the most efficient/brilliant ideas in a matter of seconds. He can scan an area and locate all of its points of strength and weaknesses for any situation. It allows for him to have an advantage where other people may not.\n\nAffinity for Darkness: Where most people would be confused and even afraid, Missha excels in the dark – it’s where his abilities are at their highest peak, allowing him to take full control of the environment around him. It’s also where he feels most comfortable in general, not really caring so much for more brighter environments.\n\nCreativity: Aside from being logical, Missha is also extremely creative. He loves to paint, read and write. If you ask him about it, you'll probably a couple of curse words and a broken heart thrown your way but deep down he can't deny his love for colour and meaningful words on paper despite his dyslexia often making it a challenge for him to do so.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nApathetic: Missha’s apathetic nature comes as a weakness. His enthusiasm and interest is only peaked with selfish intentions. A lot of the time he finds it quite difficult to empathise with people given his rather closed-off childhood. If he tried his hardest he could but his apathetic nature even stops him from doing that as well.\n\nHand-to-Hand Combat: Missha’s strength lies in his abilities and none of those include hand-to-hand combat. When it comes to things like actual sporting and combat, it would be useless to have him there as his magic is much more his talent than anything else. He can, however, use logic to occasionally get him around this issue.\n\nArrogance/Prideful: Missha’s intelligence often brings out the worst in him. He can easily go from not knowing someone to calling them an imbecile in a matter of seconds. It’s one of his weaknesses that he’s been criticised for a lot and though he doesn’t care for others opinions on it, he tries not to let it show.\n\n»POWERS;\n\nAbilities:\n\nMystiokinesis:\n\nMystiokinesis/Reality Warping allows Missha to use and manipulate magic. The effectiveness and power of magic used depends on the strength of the magic user. Missha is an average user of magic – he hasn’t quite mastered the art of magic like his other siblings and can’t use some spells that other children of Hecate can. Using Mystiokinesis Missha can:\n\n- Summon objects such as weapons (mostly smaller weapons like daggers), low level creatures (satyrs, nymphs, etc.) and occasionally people (but this requires a lot of the energy and is usually used in times of desperation).\n\n- Transformation/Shape-shifting allows Missha to change the physical state of himself into another animal and when using the power of his staff, he can also transform others for a temporary time period (fifteen seconds to a minute).\n\nUmbrakinesis:\n\nUmbrakinesis allows Missha to mentally generate and manipulate darkness.\n\n- Darkness formation allows Missha to surround his enemies in pitch-black clouds of dark space allowing him to temporarily blind them however this ability is limited against light manipulation users.\n\n- Missha can create dark barriers. This creates a barrier between the user and the person who is attacking and is usually impenetrable unless the attacker is using high levels of energy/power to destroy the barrier.\n\nLimitations:\n\nMystiokinesis:\n\nMagic requires energy and takes it from everywhere, including Missha’s own energy. If he uses too much magic at once, it takes a toll on him causing him to become extremely tired and dizzy. If all of his energy is depleted, it leaves him unable to use his magic until it has recharged – leaving him vulnerable and defenceless to a lot of different attacks.\n\n- Summoning magic is limited by temporal and space limitations. If the area of the place isn’t large enough Missha cannot summon what he needs to. Also, aside from objects, summoning of creatures and the occasional person is temporary. If Missha doesn’t concentrate enough, his summoning can backfire, causing a creature to be summoned that doesn’t listen to him which puts himself and everyone else in danger.\n\n- Shapeshifting/Transformation is limited by technique and concentration. If Missha doesn’t put all of his concentration into shapeshifting/transformation magic then either he or the target will end up partially transformed and the time of this varies from a day to a couple of seconds. It is limited in its unpredictability.\n\nUmbrakinesis:\n\nManipulating darkness also requires a lot of energy usage to do so. Like magic, darkness is consuming and drains the user quickly of a lot of energy – causing the user to feel faint, tired or dizzy which in turn makes them vulnerable in combat.\n\n- Darkness formation is limited by light manipulation users. If a child of Apollo for example were to be nearby, then it would render darkness formation useless.\n\n- Dark barriers are limited by time. Dark barriers consume a lot of energy and this usually makes dark barriers last anywhere between a minute to two minutes before the user starts to feel faint or dizzy or even pass out from extensive energy usage.\n\nWeapon:\n\nA celestial bronze staff which helps him wield his magic and a spell book full of all of Missha’s spells.\n\n»HISTORY;\n\nMikhail's (Missha) history first began when Aleksandr and Katrina Petrov, two Russian immigrants, moved to London in the ’60s. They then shortly after had Missha’s father Vitaly in the ’70s. Both his grandparents and his father had quite humble lives – not having much to live off of when first moving the UK. Aleksandr and Katrina both worked at markets whilst Vitaly worked as a bus conductor. Missha was shortly born after Vitaly had a brief encounter with a woman he described as ‘magic’.\n\nMissha initially had a more difficult time than the rest of his classmates growing up – his dyslexia proving it difficult for him to read and comprehend the English language than his other peers. His father often joked about it saying that his brain was “hard-wired for Russian”. However, this all changed when Missha turned age seven. Around this time his teachers began noticing the way he excelled in logic and problem-related areas, like mathematics and the sciences, making him a prodigy at a young age. His father then made the big decision of moving Missha from London to Santa Clara, California when he turned ten. This was so that the boy could take part in the research conducted by the University of Stanford into geniuses such as Missha himself.\n\nAt first, the research was easy. Viewing things the boy could do like: what he could solve and what he couldn’t, what intrigued him and what was in his realm of possibilities. However, things began to take a turn when the research began to get tougher – yelling on the researches part and more fear on Missha’s part when he didn’t get things right (an action which ingrained into Missha that being intelligent and being right made a person better). Missha spent a lot of his days in his fear and a constant desire building within him to stop and be free however he lived in constant fear of disappointing his father.\n\nOne morning, after a year of living in Santa Clara, Missha’s father received a phone call. The voice on the other end telling him that it was the University and that they were going to be sending someone for Missha to carpool with as they knew how busy his father was in the morning with work. After accepting the offer, Missha got into the car and waved his father goodbye. From there Missha was told about his identity and what may happen should he agree. Wanting to leave behind the life of misery he was already facing, he was taken to camp half-blood. His biggest regret to today is the way he left without giving his father closure.\n\n[/div]\n\ncodedbycrucialstar | hidden scrolls, hover over photo​\n\n*Note*\n\nI haven't read the books since I was in high school (I'm about to graduate college) so all my info comes from the Percy Jackson wikia so let me know if anything is wrong lmao\n\n『 Pauline Dupont 』\n\n[import]9010974[/import] [class=values] --tabStyle: row wrap; --contentStyle: column nowrap; --tab-txt-align: center; --tab-txt-color: #FFFFFF; --bg-color: #616161; --fontFamily: 'Dancing Script'; --fontSize: 19px; --tab-hover-color: #000000; --tab-hover-bg: #B4B4B4; --tab-select-color: #FFFFFF; --tab-select-bg: #B4B4B4; [/class] [div class=\"tabContainer values\"] [div class=tabHolder] [div class=\"tab selected\"][div class=tabID]1Tab\n\nThe Basics\n\n[div class=tab][div class=tabID]2Tab[/div]Persona[/div] [div class=tab][div class=tabID]3Tab[/div]Other[/div] [/div]\n\n[div class=tabContentHolder]\n\n[div class=\"tabContent 1\"]\n\nname: pauline dupont\n\nnickname: none\n\nage: 18\n\nbirthday: september 21\n\nchild of: pluto\n\ngender: female\n\nsexual orientation: heterosexual\n\nrank/cohort: centurion of the third cohort\n\nheight: 5'8\n\nweight: 120lbs\n\ntattoos: pluto's symbol, SPQR with 6 lines\n\neye colour: brown\n\nhair colour: blonde\n\nfaceclaim: suki waterhouse\n\n[/div]\n\n[div class=\"tabContent 2\"]\n\npersonality:\n\nPauline is not what you would expect of a child of Pluto. She is cheery and warm. She is confident, outgoing, and self assured, however she does not like to admit when she is wrong. She speaks before thinking sometimes, which can get her into trouble. She has an issue with holding grudges; for example, it took her nearly two weeks to forgive her mom for not telling her the truth sooner (and her mom is her best friend). She listens intently and wants to actually get to know the people she talks to. She is fast paced and likes to get to the point. She trusts her friends, but finds it difficult to forgive when they break that trust. She puts effort into things she cares about, but struggles to do so when something does not interest her. She thinks the truth is important, so lying is something that she only does when it is inconsequential or absolutely necessary.\n\nlikes:\n\nthe night sky, vintage clothes, music (except country), the wind, crisp fall days, bats\n\ndislikes:\n\nsilence, isolation, bugs, being too hot/cold, mushrooms, being wrong\n\nstrengths:\n\n-Fighting: Pauline may not be the strongest, but she knows how to use what she has to her benefit. Depending on the fault, she will find a way to compensate for it or spend extra time training for it in order to become a better fighter\n\n-Commitment: When Pauline is dedicated to something, she puts in as much effort as she can. She always likes doing things to the best of her ability...well, as long as she is interested in that thing. Currently, she is working on strengthening and expanding her powers.\n\n-Mental Strength: Due to Pauline's connection with the dead and her abilities involving fear, she has definitely endured a lot. She knows how to regulate her emotions and overcome her fears when she has to.\n\nweaknesses:\n\n-Grudges: Pauline can hold a nasty grudge that she won't let go of, even if it makes things easier or benefits her in some way. She would rather suffer.\n\n-Fear of Weakness: She will refuse to ask for help, insisting she will figure it out or find a way around the problem. She takes failure and criticism especially hard and very personally. She is focused on the unattainable: perfection. This even translates into relationships. She is afraid to be vulnerable and tell someone how she is truly feeling.\n\n-Physical Strength: While demigods are all incredibly strong by mortal standards, Pauline is not the strongest by demigod standards. She has to adapt her fighting to compensate for this, however that is not always helpful. Some enemies are just too physically strong to fight without the help of her powers.\n\nabilities:\n\n-Necromancy\n\n~Sensitivity to death: can tell when someone is dying or when someone dies.\n\n~Summoning the souls of the dead: with the proper materials (a hole filled with food or animal blood), she can summon the souls of the dead after chanting in Ancient Greek\n\n~Power over ghosts: she can physically touch ghosts and manipulate them (such as making them silent)\n\n-Phobikinesis\n\n~She lets off an aura of fear and death when she is upset or nervous (this can cause plant life around her to wilt or even die)\n\n~Knows other's fears and can use it against them\n\n~Can use illusions to cause fear\n\n-Umbrakinesis\n\n~Like other children of Pluto, Pauline can Shadow Travel\n\n~She can manipulates shadows and darkness from turning them into solid, near impenetrable, shields or surrounding herself or someone in complete darkness\n\nlimitations:\n\n-Necromancy: Can only sense the death of someone if she is physically present with them. At the moment, she is unable to guarantee that the soul she is summoning will appear, she has gotten the intended soul's relatives accidentally before.\n\n-Phobikinesis: The illusions only last for short periods of time, they are often weak for demigods and mortals that can see through the mist. She cannot tell the fears of gods or monsters. Her aura of fear and death makes other living beings very uncomfortable when they are near her, but she cannot control it when she gets upset or nervous (it is vaguely there when she is content)\n\n-Umbrakinesis: Shadow Travel is incredibly taxing for Pauline, she cannot do it with other people and can only go short distances. While Hades shields can even withstand one of Zeus's thunderbolts, Pauline's can withstand weapons and some other attacks, she would not be able to block anything that was very powerful, especially if it came from something that produced light, but it may weaken its efficacy. These powers are weakened or ineffective on those that can produce light (ex: Apollo/Children of Apollo)\n\nweapons:\n\n-stygian iron sword\n\n-imperial gold knife\n\nfears/phobias:\n\n-Losing her mother\n\n-Being isolated\n\n-Any kind of bug (especially spiders and centipedes)\n\nhistory:\n\nPauline was born and raised in Manhattan, New York to a single mother, Giselle Dupont. Giselle was a professor of French Cinema. She was originally from France, but moved to New York when she was 12. Pauline was raised with the help of her grandparents, who would watch her while her mother taught. Because of this, she does speak French, but not to the level of someone who lived there. She would consider herself fluent, but she does not have a complex vocabulary. Like most demigods, she did not know her father growing up, but her mother was pretty open about it. She knew her mother met a man, who went by the name Peter, at a film festival. They immediately connected and had a whirlwind romance that resulted in Pauline. However, she did not know that when Giselle became pregnant, he told her the truth before he had to leave. He explained the danger that Pauline, and by association, she will face. Pluto had told her of Camp Jupiter and why it was important for Pauline to be sent there.\n\nShe did not know what she was until she was 12, when things began to get dangerous, so her mother sent her to camp. There were one too many close calls that forced her mother to make the painful decision to send her away. When Pauline learned the truth, things in her life began to make a lot more sense. She even knew her grandfather dying, despite seeming healthy to everyone else. She knew he died before they got the news. She has always had a connection with the dead, seeing ghosts and being able to communicate with them. She had always been pale and cold to the touch, not even tanning in the summer.\n\nWhen she was going to school before camp, she was considered strange by the other kids at school, who almost seemed afraid of her. Once she was upset that she had done poorly on a spelling test because of her dyslexia and the classmate who had sat next to her had to go home because her aura had been affecting him the strongest, due to his proximity to her. The potted flower on her teacher's desk shriveled and died when she touched it.\n\nOnce she arrived at Camp Jupiter, she had learned that there was more to her powers than talking to the dead and making people uncomfortable. She focused on honing and discovering her powers. She feels that she has the potential to be stronger than she is at the moment and is working towards becoming the best version of herself that she can be. She still struggled being away from her mom, although she tries to keep in contact the best that she can. She knew being at Camp Jupiter is the best thing for her, but she still worries about her mother and grandmother who still live in Manhattan.\n\nAfter everything was destroyed, Pauline started her trip to Camp Halfblood. She wants to find who else made it and to figure out what to do next.\n\n[/div]\n\n[div class=\"tabContent 3\"]\n\nquotes:\n\n\"What's there to be afraid of?\"\n\n\"I could just die\"\n\n\"You're dead to me\"\n\n\"Look on the bright side?
