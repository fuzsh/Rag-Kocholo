The Wellington team takes immense pride in managing the challenging terrain of their territory. After all, our owner grew up amongst it! A born and bred Wellingtonian, Kim Baldwin took on the Landmark Homes Wellington franchise in 2016.

With more than 30 years of architectural design and 22 years of project management under his beltâincluding running his own architectural business â Kim is something of an authority in home design. Unsurprisingly, heâs also our in-house designer. One of the best aspects of Landmark Wellington is that the team does nearly everything in-house, which helps improve the efficiency of every build while keeping quality high.
