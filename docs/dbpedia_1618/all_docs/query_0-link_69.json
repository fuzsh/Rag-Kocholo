        "text": "It is with deep sadness that we have to announce the passing of Colin Williamson who passed away in Forth Valley hospital on Wednesday, 13 December after recent illness.\n\nAn outstanding player at Jordanhill School who represented Glasgow and Scottish Schools, Colin played initially for the Jordanhill FPs before joining West shortly after the club’s Unofficial Championship success in 1970-71. He quickly impressed with his electrifying pace through the centre which was to become the trademark of his rugby career. During his playing career there was interest from the national selectors and whilst representing the Co-optimists Club in an end of season fixture sustained a serious knee injury. He recovered and returned to the West 1st XV, playing for much of the first ever National League season in 1973-74 and was asked to stand by as a reserve for the 1974 International v Netherlands. Back then it was an unofficial test but recently the players were recognised with the award of retrospective caps including West’s own Jack Shirley. Unfortunately, he suffered further knee damage and eventually retired from the game well ahead of his time.\n\nColin then became a most capable and shrewd Chairman of Selectors, ensuring a large number of West teams took the field every Saturday. For many years he was one of the keen regular Sunday morning runners and a pioneer of the ambitious West fundraising relays along the route of the West Highland Way.\n\nIn the early 2000s he served on the General Committee, using his engineering knowledge to the benefit of the Burnbrae estate, and latterly he lived in Muckhart and Glendevon. He remained a proud West man, however, and would often travel to organise lunch occasions for former team colleague, and particularly for the late Sandy Carmichael as his mobility declined.\n\nColin will be remembered very fondly by former teammates and by younger players who benefited from his guidance and encouragement. The attendees at Perth Crematorium on Wednesday 3 January heard very appropriate Eulogies by nephew, Stephen Green, and longstanding fellow Jordanhill School and West player, David Rankine.\n\nWe offer our sincere condolences to Colin’s partner Norma, sister Muriel, brother in law, Doug, niece Jennifer and nephews Stephen and Donald."
