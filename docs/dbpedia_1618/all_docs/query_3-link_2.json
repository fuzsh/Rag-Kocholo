Members of the SFA include clubs in Scotland, affiliated national associations as well as local associations. It was formed in 1873, making it the second oldest national football association in the world. It is not to be confused with the Scottish Football Union, which is the name that the SRU was known by until the 1920s.\n\nThe Scottish Football Association is a member of both UEFA and FIFA and holds a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is responsible for the Laws of the Game. It is based at Hampden Park in Glasgow.[1] In addition, the Scottish Football Museum is located there.\n\nThe Scottish Football Association is responsible for the operation of the Scotland national football team, the annual Scottish Cup and several other duties important to the functioning of the game in Scotland.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFormation\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\nQueen's Park, a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs – Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville – attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to join.\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that:\n\nThe clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.[3]\n\nFounding members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following eight football clubs founded the Scottish Football Association:\n\nManufacturer Location Queen's Park Glasgow Clydesdale Glasgow Vale of Leven Alexandria Dumbreck Glasgow Third Lanark Glasgow Eastern Glasgow Granville Glasgow Kilmarnock Kilmarnock\n\nChief Executive/Secretary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe chief executive of the Scottish Football Association oversees the development of football in Scotland and the administration of disciplinary matters, and is also responsible for the general organisation of the national side. One of the most prominent roles of the chief executive is to hire and dismiss Scotland national football team managers.[4]\n\nArchibald Rae (1873–1874)\n\nJ.C. Mackay (1874–1875)\n\nWilliam Dick (1875–1880)\n\nJames Fleming (1880–1882)\n\nRobert Livingstone (1882)\n\nJohn McDowall (1882–1928)\n\nSir George Graham (1928–1957)\n\nWillie Allan (1957–1977)\n\nErnie Walker CBE (1977–1990)\n\nJim Farry (1990–1999)\n\nDavid Taylor (1999–2007)\n\nGordon Smith (2007–2010)[5]\n\nStewart Regan (2010–2018)[6][7]\n\nIan Maxwell (2018–present)[8][9]\n\nAssociation overview\n\n[edit]\n\nNational teams\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scotland national football team\n\nAs well as the Scotland national football team, the Scottish Football Association is also currently responsible for organising the Scotland national football B team, as well as men's national teams at under-21, under-19, under-18 and under-17 levels. There was also a semi-professional team, but this was disbanded in 2008.[10] In women's football, there is the full Scotland women's national football team, under-19 and under-17 teams. In Futsal, there is a full national side.\n\nClub competitions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association organises the Scottish Cup and the Scottish Youth Cup. Although the SFA are not involved in the day-to-day operation of the Scottish Professional Football League or other league competitions, they do appoint referees to officiate the games in these leagues, as well as dealing with player registrations and disciplinary issues.[3]\n\nClub licensing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association encourages quality of governance in football clubs through a system of club licence awards. All SFA member clubs are assessed annually in four areas (ground, first team, youth team, and governance) and, if appropriate, awarded a licence at platinum, gold, silver, bronze or entry level. As of June 2023,[11] only Celtic and Rangers have been awarded a platinum-level licence, while two others (Hibernian and St Johnstone) hold gold-level licences. All clubs in the Scottish Professional Football League are required to be licensed at bronze level, Highland Football League, and Lowland Football League are required to be licensed at entry level or above.\n\nPerformance Schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association established a number of performance schools around Scotland in 2012 with the aim of developing footballing talent in young people and at grassroots level. The programme is for under-12 players, and will provide them with 800 hours of additional coaching.[12] As of June 2023 , seven performance schools exist:\n\nHazlehead Academy – Aberdeen (Head Coach: Stuart Glennie)[13]\n\nSt John's Roman Catholic High School – Dundee (Head Coach: Iain Jenkins)[14]\n\nBroughton High School – Edinburgh (Head Coach: Keith Wright)[15]\n\nGraeme High School – Falkirk (Head Coach: Ian Ross)[16]\n\nHolyrood Secondary School – Glasgow (Head Coach: Joe McBride)[17]\n\nGrange Academy – Kilmarnock (Head Coach: James Grady)[18]\n\nBraidhurst High School – Motherwell (Head Coach: Stephen Clarke)[19]\n\nMember clubs\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of June 2023, 124 clubs are full members of the Scottish Football Association, comprising:[11]\n\nAll 42 clubs in the Scottish Professional Football League\n\nAll 18 clubs in the Highland Football League\n\nAll 16 clubs in the Lowland Football League\n\n2 clubs in the Midlands Football League:\n\nLochee United and Tayport\n\n2 clubs in the North Caledonian League:\n\nFort William and Golspie Sutherland\n\n24 clubs in the East of Scotland Football League:\n\nBlackburn United, Broxburn Athletic, Burntisland Shipyard, Camelon Juniors, Coldstream, Dalkeith Thistle, Dunbar United, Dundonald Bluebell, Dunipace, Easthouses Lily Miners Welfare, Haddington Athletic, Hawick Royal Albert, Hill of Beath Hawthorn, Jeanfield Swifts, Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale, Musselburgh Athletic, Newtongrange Star, Penicuik Athletic, Preston Athletic, Sauchie Juniors, St Andrews United, Tynecastle, Vale of Leithen, and Whitehill Welfare\n\n5 clubs in the South of Scotland Football League:\n\nCreetown, Dalbeattie Star, Newton Stewart, St Cuthbert Wanderers, and Wigtown & Bladnoch\n\n15 clubs in the West of Scotland Football League:\n\nAuchinleck Talbot, Benburb, Bonnyton Thistle, Carluke Rovers, Clydebank, Cumnock Juniors, Darvel, Girvan, Glasgow University, Glenafton Athletic, Irvine Meadow XI, Kilwinning Rangers, Pollok, Rutherglen Glencairn, and Threave Rovers\n\nAffiliated associations\n\n[edit]\n\nNational associations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association has affiliated to it the following seven national associations:[20]\n\nScottish Amateur Football Association\n\nScottish Junior Football Association\n\nScottish Para Football Association\n\nScottish Schools Football Association\n\nScottish Welfare Football Association\n\nScottish Women's Football\n\nScottish Youth Football Association\n\nLocal associations\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 10 local associations affiliated and the competitions they manage are also listed below:[20]\n\nRecognised leagues\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following six leagues with their affiliated leagues and cups are recognised by The Scottish Football Association:[20]\n\nScottish Professional Football League\n\nScottish League Cup\n\nScottish Challenge Cup\n\nScottish Highland Football League\n\nHighland League Cup\n\nSHFL U17 League\n\nScottish Lowland Football League\n\nLowland League Cup\n\nLowlands Development League\n\nLowlands Development League Cup\n\nLowlands Development Challenge Cup\n\nLowlands Development Knock Out Cup\n\nEast of Scotland Football League\n\nEast of Scotland Football League Cup\n\nWest of Scotland Football League\n\nWest of Scotland Football League Cup\n\nStrathclyde Cup\n\nSouth of Scotland Football League\n\nSouth of Scotland Football League Cup\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
