        "text": "Victories for the men’s, women’s and U18 sides made it the perfect weekend for West of Scotland. The men defeated Greenock Wanderers 22-8 in their National League Division 3 clash at Burnbrae (report here). West Ladies secured another try bonus point win, scoring seven tries in defeating Howe Harlequins 39-29 in a fine match at Duffus Park, Cupar (report here).\n\nArguably, the most satisfying win was that of the U18s who travelled to face Livingston in the U18 Boy’s National Youth Cup quarter-final and returned with a 43-14 victory.\n\nAn excellent display by the very promising U18 squad saw them take their place in the semi-final of the National Youth Cup. West scored three first half tries to lead by 19 points to 7 at the interval but with the game still to be won. They stepped it up in the second half to score four further tries and run out comfortable winners against opponents who fought to the end. West tries were scored by Finn Carden who got three and Pat Spence who scored twice with Sebastien Sing and Harris Mitchell getting one apiece. Lewis Howick kicked four conversions. Head of Rugby Development Millan Browne was delighted with some good team tries in an overall fine performance in the side’s first game of 2022. West will now play Hawick in the semi-final."
