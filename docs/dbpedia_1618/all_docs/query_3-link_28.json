To get an overview of multiple bathing water locations, or to download data extracts, see the data page .\n\nWater quality at designated bathing water sites in England is assessed by the Environment Agency. From May to September, weekly assessments measure current water quality, and at a number of sites daily pollution risk forecasts are issued. Annual ratings classify each site as excellent, good, sufficient or poor based on measurements taken over a period of up to four years. Information about bathing water quality in other countries in the UK can be found here: Scotland (SEPA), Wales (NRW), or Northern Ireland (DAERA)"
