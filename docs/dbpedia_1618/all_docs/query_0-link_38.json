        "text": "Perthshire 22 – 22 Strathmore\n\nTense draw secures Eagles’ place in National League 3 for another season.\n\nFollowing last week’s bonus point win over Greenock, Perthshire knew a single point would guarantee safety and avoid the possibility of relegation. However, in this local derby league considerations went to the back of the mind, as victory was the aim for both teams. The large crowd gathered on the Inch were not disappointed by the contest played out over the next 80 minutes.\n\nIt was a cool but fair day and Strathmore kicked off with Perthshire taking the ball well. After a few initial exchanges of possession, Strathmore opened the scoring with a successful penalty with 5 minutes played.\n\nSoon Perthshire were into the Strathmore half and awarded a scrum in a good position. Tempers frayed between the backrowers as Perthshire’s pack heaved the visitors backwards. Matt Jenns and his opposite number given short shrift from the referee and sent to the sin bin for 10 minutes to cool down.\n\nFrom the ensuing penalty, Perthshire kicked to the corner and won the lineout cleanly off the top. Sent out to the right, Lewis Murrie at scrumhalf heeded the call from Kieran Ramsay and switched it back left where Ramsay scored in the corner. Jonny Armitt missed the difficult conversion so Perthshire took the lead 5-3.\n\nMoments later ‘Shire again found themselves back in the Strathmore 22. Andrew Sanderson at the end of a fine attack but just bundled into touch. With the 10 minutes sin bin over, the teams returned to 15 men. From this lineout Dan Rae took an excellent steal and immediately Perthshire were on the front foot. The forwards did the heavy lifting, bulldozing up to the line then Kieran Ramsay got his second for the day as he picked & scored from the base of the ruck; conversion missed the hosts had a 10-3 lead.\n\nHaving been starved of any quality possession Strathmore begun to get their players working together. A clever kick isolated Perthshire who conceded a penalty allowing Strathmore to kick for touch, but overly ambitious the ball went dead. Perthshire should have taken advantage but tried to run out their own half and were subsequently forced into touch, then compounded this by giving penalty in the next play. Strathmore made touch then won a controversial penalty at the following lineout which was taken quickly before the Eagles’ defence could reorganise. The quick hands found space in the backline with a looping pass opening up the defence for Strathmore to take a converted try and level the score.\n\nPerthshire immediately went on the offensive, the defence forcing Strathmore into a knock-on. The play stayed in the visitors’ half as both teams forced mistakes from the other, Strathmore couldn’t exit, Simon McGarry key in winning midfield turnovers, but neither could ‘Shire break through despite opportunities created by Mat Rae and Aidan Watson.\n\nThroughout the match Perthshire had the better in the set piece. The lineout maul was on devastating. With about 6 minutes to go and still in Strathmore territory the maul set and rumbled forward only to be denied as they were taken down illegally. Confident in his pack James Mair called it to himself again and from 5m the pressure was too much to defend. Kieran Ramsay secured his hattrick with another try in the corner as he peeled off the maul. Again the angle was not favourable and the conversion missed.\n\nThere was time for one more attack before the half ended. Perthshire has the option to go for 3 points but instead backed their maul. It wasn’t to be as the referee controversially judged the ball knocked on when Angus Walker went to ground it. So it remained 15-10 at the break.\n\nWith 3 tries to 1, Perthshire knew they had the ability to see the game out in the second half. All they needed to do was maintain composure and continue to exert pressure through the scrum & lineout.\n\nThe second half started at 100mph. It was a close, with the breakdown a particularly ferocious, contest both James Mair and Calum Chalmers excelling on the floor. The solid front row of Kyle MacKinnon, Angus Walker and Ewen MacDonald continued to provide a platform from the scrum.\n\nEdging closer to their 4th try, tempers frayed and the referee sent ‘Shire back for a double penalty after an infringement on the clearing kicker. Perthshire were then lucky not to concede as moments later Strathmore broke through the midfield but the final, would be scoring, pass was knocked on.\n\nIndiscipline was hurting ‘Shire now preventing any attacking rhythm and gifting Strathmore possession and position to attack. A couple of soft tackles in the midfield and the visitors were in behind. Hauled down just short of the line Strathmore reorganised quickly and after a few short picks took their try in the corner. Conversion missed the match was level 15-15.\n\nImmediately after the restart Strathmore seized the lead. Receiving the ball on the left flank they attacked then sent a cross field kick to the right. Running down the wing as Perthshire scrambled the ball was grubber kicked infield where it was collected and scored under the posts. Within 2 minutes, Perthshire has gone from leading to a 7 point deficit.\n\nThe final 20 minutes saw mistakes and indiscipline hamper both teams. This suited Strathmore who were happy to run down the clock. After a promising few phases camped on the line James Mair crossed the line but the referee judged a knock on in the grounding.\n\nStill applying the pressure the men in Black & White returned to the lineout maul but they were just held out. Changing tactic ‘Shire took a scrum 5m out. Forwards held in, Lewis Murrie sent the ball to the backs to no avail as an intentional knock on saw Strathmore reduced to 14 for the remainder of the match.\n\nConstantly Perthshire pushed for the score, but scums and short penalties were defended. Eventually, in the final play and right on the line Will Campbell burst through the middle of the ruck to cover the necessary centimetres and cross the whitewash. Bonus point try secured, it was up to Jonny Armitt to see if he could add the extras to draw the match. If he was nervous he didn’t show, as he slotted it and the referee blew for full-time, 22-22.\n\nRelief and elation in equal measure was expressed by the now sizeable crowd that had watched this entertaining match. Head Coach Alan Clark was pleased to see the resilience of the squad he has built to stick with it to the end and get more than the minimum from the match. The 3 league points secured sends Perthshire up to 7th in the table and above Strathmore.\n\nThe 2XV were also playing on the North Inch and also gave the squad a boost posting 45-12 win against Grangemouth 2XV. You can read the full match report, The Perth Men Come Up Trumps On The Inch, here: www.perthshire-rfc.co.uk/teams/2nd-xv\n\nNext week is the final match for the 1XV as they host Berwick on the Inch, kick-off again 3pm. The visitors will be looking to extract as many points from the match as they seek promotion. Perthshire know they will have a handful to deal with but can go out and play with no fear and enjoy the chance to cause an upset. Meanwhile the 2XV travel to Bannockburn and look to build on the positive performance from this Saturday.\n\nPhotos taken by Peter Wilkinson.\n\nPerthshire 60 – 10 Greenock Wanderers\n\nLarge home support boosts Perthshire to strong win.\n\nOnly 3 weeks ago Perthshire travelled to Greenock and were beaten 32-16. Today was a chance to exact revenge and for the squad to show coaches Alan Clark & Kenny Christie they have learnt and are up for the fight to stay in National League rugby. With a large crowd rallied to support the boys in this key fixture they did not disappoint.\n\nThe sunshine brought out running rugby and Perthshire brought a discipline and focus not seen for years in a team wearing Black & White. The enthralling first half saw tries from Kyle MacKinnon, Jonny Armitt, Aidan Watson, Angus Walker and Dan Rae; 3 converted by Calum Bruce. Greenock getting one in response.\n\nIt was more of the same in the second half with Kieran Ramsay x2, Calum Chalmers x2 and Mat Rae all crossing the whitewash, with 2 conversions added from the boot of Aidan Watson. Greenock pulled one back and continued in the fight but it was Perthshire’s day. The pack dominance really asserted itself and the bounce of the ball went the Eagle’s way.\n\nIt has been a long time coming, the hard dark winter training maybe now bearing fruit. Next week sees a derby with Strathmore visiting the North Inch. Perthshire need to back this performance up with another against the Forfar men to show they mean business and it was not a once off. All welcome to join the support for what promises to be an enthralling encounter. Kick-off is 3pm.\n\nWorking up the Learning Curve\n\nPerthshire 2XV 19 – 44 Waid Academy FP\n\nTeam improves as the match progresses\n\nBy Thursday night Dave Lewis had a squad named with a full bench for the match on Saturday. A different sort of selection headache for “Big Dave” as he had to decide which players were left out such was the availability across the Senior Squad.\n\nThe 22 players that took to field had a range of experience, there were 5 players making their Perthshire debut, for some their first rugby match ever, and others who have played for regularly for the 1XV, even just last week. Waid only had 14 players and elected to use Game On rules so the sides were matched at 14 each and the game reduced to 60 minutes played over 3x 20 minute periods. As it was a hot day regular water breaks would be necessary.\n\nPerthshire started brightly kicking off and some aggressive defence put Waid back. However, after a couple of phases the line speed dropped off and Waid’s big carriers in the midfield started taking generous chunks of territory before getting stopped. This momentum told soon after as they crashed over for the opening score.\n\nThe same pattern followed with Waid making easy yards following weak tackling, ‘Shire guilty of going too high and getting bounced. Scott Tarrant chased back to put in a magnificent cover tackle after a clean break, getting his man down, the support was there and the offload made the try. Unfortunately having put his all into the tackle Scott’s arm took the full force and suffered a nasty fracture. Everyone wishes him well for a quick recovery.\n\nPerthshire hadn’t really had the ball and when they did often the support was a bit too slow and the speed went out of the play or Waid effected the turnover. The benefits of training together began to show as the men in Black & White hit back after some good phase play. Awarded a scrum the pack surged forward and scrumhalf Jack Mcintosh, a live wire all day, spotted the opportunity to take from the base, dummy and back himself to the line for a try converted by Rab Pittendreigh.\n\nThere was time for Waid to score once more before the opening 20 minute period was over. The hard ground claiming it’s second victim as debutant Lewis Moffat was forced off with a knee injury from the cover tackle. Dave Lewis asked his players to stay connected in attack and defence and keep low in the tackle. Then they were ready and rehydrated for the second period.\n\nWith some rejigging in the squad ‘Shire were caught a bit off guard and Waid ran in 2 quick tries, again the first up tackling letting down the home team. However, Perthshire’s set piece dominance really started to show through. In the scrums Cameron McGougan and Stevie Wilkie were solid providing more quality ball for Jack Mcintosh. Meanwhile Kieran Maclean and Ewan MacKessack-Leitch were in complete control of the lineout, winning all their own ball and making life difficult for the Waid pack.\n\nAround half way through this period Simon McGarry made another break and was supported by Callum Coutts, as they formed formidable centre partnership. Waid infringed and this gave ‘Shire a chance for a lineout close to the line. It was secured and Jack Mcintosh found his men in the back line. However, the home team couldn’t find the breakthrough. Waid were offside and penalised for this. Mcintosh took the tap quickly sending the forwards on a foray between the posts but just short, then he spun it out to the backs. The after a series of interlinking passes and offloads Callum Coutts crossed the line to pull one back for Perthshire.\n\nPerthshire attacked again but were thwarted by some good Waid defence and counter-rucking. On the turnover, Waid found the space to go the length of the pitch, despite the cover tackles of David Hutchison and Rabson Chipakupaku who both sprinted at least half the pitch to bring down their opposite man before the quick ruck and offloads took Waid over the line.\n\nGoing into the final period Perthshire knew that 2 more tries would earn the bonus point and then possibly the chance to win it. Debutants Mika Gratzke, Ryan Beaton and David Donovan were on the pitch and made their presence known, tackling and barging through Waid in close quarters. As they did all match Arran Sheach, Simon McGarry and Calum Coutts were winning numerous ruck penalties as Waid went onto the backfoot. Converting this pressure into points was difficult. Lineouts were won, rolling mauls set, solid scrum platforms and incisive backs runs all came but the final pass or support was not there.\n\nThen following more devastating runs in the centres the ball went out to Colin Smith who turned on the pace. After 40m the cover brought him down. Waid earned a scrum but couldn’t clear far and ‘Shire had the opportunity to attack again. Multiple ruck & offside penalties built up as Perthshire reached the 5m line. Club Captain, Ewan MacKessack-Leitch took it quickly and squeezed under the defender to score with about 7 minutes remaining. Rab Pittendreigh made the conversion.\n\nOne more try would have earnt the bonus point but despite good efforts, especially powerful runs by David Donovan, it never came. Waid instead managed a score in the closing stages.\n\nDave Lewis and Campbell Watson were proud of the performance from each player. Everyone stuck in and worked hard for their teammates. The team gelled more as the match progressed and if availability stays this good there are much better days to come, such is the potential waiting to be unleashed. Grangemouth 2XV are the challenge next week, also on the North Inch with kick-off 3pm.\n\nPhotos taken by Peter Wilkinson.\n\nWest of Scotland 38 – 9 Perthshire\n\nWest overpower in a decisive second half.\n\nThis was a game of two halves. It was a dry day but recent rain made for a heavy pitch at Burnbrae and with Storm Malik blowing through a forwards game was on the cards.\n\nThe initial exchanges were fairly even, both teams playing a simple gameplan and defending it well. West were well drilled in the scrum and put pressure on Perthshire, something the Black & White pack have not really experienced this season. A scrum penalty followed by later indiscipline at the breakdown saw Perthshire retreating backwards. On the 8th minute West capitalised to score their opening converted try.\n\nThe next 25 minutes followed a similar pattern. Slowly but surely the Perthshire forwards made the hard yards entering in to the West half; carries from Ewen MacDonald, Calum Chalmers and Dan Rae making significant inroads. The backs saw some ball too, Mat Rae and Jonny Armitt making valuable metres when the space was there. Some errors would see ‘Shire go back, but return they would with relentless determination. When the assault got too intense West would concede a penalty. Up stepped Calum Bruce to duly slot them, 3 from 3 even in the wind. With 35 minutes on clock Perthshire took the lead 7-9.\n\nA failure to clear the restart gave West valuable possession in the ‘Shire half for only the second time in the match. Rucks were keenly contested but after catching the eye of the referee one too many times Matt Jenns was shown a yellow card with 2 left minutes in the half. West used their numbers advantage in the scrum to hold the forwards in, creating space outside to run in a try, unconverted the half time whistle blew. West of Scotland 12 – 9 Perthshire.\n\n‘Shire started the half with 14 men and battled well to hold off West, some strong tackles by Kieran Ramsay, Dan Rae and James Mair keeping West honest. Just as Matt Jenns was ready to return West claimed their third try.\n\nThe next score was crucial, down 19-9 Perthshire could recover if it went their way. Alas it did not, guilty of conceding penalties at the rucks and the scrum creaking ‘Shire were soon on the backfoot. West scored two more tries reasonably quickly to secure the result. Injuries to Ewen MacDonald and Shaun Barton did not help matters, a considerable reshuffling of the back line was needed seeing Man-of-the-Match Kieran Ramsay move out to the centre.\n\nIndividuals continued to battle hard but there was no luck for ‘Shire. Scrums held a bit better but gaps were opening up and getting tired Perthshire were guilty of going too high in tackles giving West some easy metres. When in possession support was too slow to make effective attacks and momentum lost. Eventually on the 80th minute West scored their 6th try to finish the match 38-9 winners.\n\nThis was a sobering experience for the Perthshire team who had trained well and came in with some confidence after the improved performance against Hillhead the week before. Plenty for coaches Alan Clark & Kenny Christie to work on before the challenge of Berwick on the North Inch in 2 weeks’ time.\n\nIt was a similar story for the 2s who worked hard but for little reward throughout their match. In it until the 2nd half eventually losing 7-34 against Dunfermline 2XV. See the full match report here: www.perthshire-rfc.co.uk/teams/2nd-xv\n\nMeanwhile the Women’s team shared their opposition with the 1s travelling to Milngavie to take on the West of Scotland 2XV. This match marked a huge achievement as it was the first time they had a full 1XV thanks to players from Aberfeldy RFC joining the squad. They achieved a 45-15 win and more can be seen on their page: www.perthshire-rfc.co.uk/teams/women\n\nNext week it’s the Calcutta Cup so no 1XV match but, the 2XV will be in action hosting Crieff under the North Inch floodlights on Friday night with a 7pm kick-off. Come down to support the players in Black & White! All are welcome to the Perth Bowling Club on Saturday to watch the 6 Nations matches, including the action from Murrayfield.\n\nPhotos can be seen here: www.westofscotlandfc.co.uk/galleries/west-v-perthshire-29_01_22\n\nPerthshire 0 – 10 Hillhead Jordanhill\n\nAfter a long battle on the North Inch, Shire just lose in the end.\n\nConsidering this was Perthshire’s first competitive game since the defeat to Howe on 27th November this was an enthralling game and both teams went at each other hammer and tongs for the full 80 minutes, or 95 minutes, depending on whose watch you were looking at.\n\nHillhead had the majority of possession in the 1st half but seldom has a Perthshire team exhibited so much passion and skill in defence as time after time they repelled everything Hillhead could throw at them. Shire suffered an early injury blow when James Armstrong, who was making his comeback after injury, was carted off in the first 5 minutes resulting in a reshuffle of the backs. Jonny Armitt, celebrating his birthday with a confident and excellent all round display, made an early bone crunching tackle to save a certain try and this set the tone for the rest of the game. Shire’s forwards stepped up to the plate and with the front 5 doing all the unheralded work to contain Hillhead, the back row of Chalmers, Mair and man of the match Matt Jenns ensured that every ball was contested and they gave no ground to the strong Hillhead pack.\n\nIt was all desperate backs to the wall stuff and the referee seemed to be penalising Shire every time they went near the ball and if Hillhead had opted for kicks at goal instead of trying to score tries all the time they could well have been out of sight at half time. With a half time score of 0 – 0 people could have been excused if they were thinking this was a dull boring game but it was anything but.\n\nKieran Ramsay brought fresh impetus to the forwards when he came on and the return of Armstrong who had shaken off his earlier injury went on to the wing and brought a new attacking threat to Shire. As a result, Perthshire had a much more attacking presence as the game went on and tested the Hillhead defence with their strong running.\n\nMat Rae was proving a handful and young Andrew Sanderson like all good scrum halves was scrapping away with his opposite number at every opportunity and providing good ball for the backs. Ross Goodison was full of elusive running and James Armstrong was causing all sorts of damage on the wing. Unfortunately, he was yellow carded on 50 minutes for an innocuous offence and Shire had to dig even deeper. It was good to see a Perthshire team exhibiting such a fighting resolve and there was no way they were going to lie down to the pressure coming from Hillhead.\n\nPerthshire scored what would have been a monumental try and every player on the park along with the spectators were certain that the try was good but the one man who mattered, the referee, didn’t award it although the photographic evidence certainly looked to support Shire’s view.\n\nShire’s forwards grew stronger as the game progressed and a yellow card for Hillhead’s French hooker added to the impetus although they then reverted to uncontested scrums which nullified Shire’s advantage somewhat. Just as it looked as though a draw was inevitable Hillhead at last broke the Shire defence to score. The clock then seemed to tick on well past the 80 minutes and a further devastating blow to Shire’s players was another late try to rob them of the losing bonus point.\n\nTo come away from this encounter with nothing to show for it was a huge disappointment but everyone in the squad can take credit for a fighting display and if this form can be repeated away from home, then there should be a strong finish to the season for the mighty Shire.\n\nThe 2XV were also in action for the first time in 2022 away at Grangemouth 2XV. The team started well and were unlucky to go down 5-0 after about 10 minutes. The Eagles then conceded a second try before a quick tap, followed by forward carries in midfield, allowed space to release Rabson Chipakupaku out to score. The final 10 minutes of the half were dominated by Perthshire but they couldn’t turn the pressure into points and were down 10-5 at the break.\n\nIn the second half, the 2s lost structure and confidence shipping some easy tries before a late rally when a lineout maul surged forward allowing Arran Sheach to crash over and score Perthshire’s second try. The match ended 27 – 10 in Grangemouth 2XV’s favour.\n\nNext weekend Perthshire travel to West of Scotland for the first double header shared with the Women’s team, supporters welcome on the teams’ bus. The 2s host Dunfermline 2XV at the North Inch with a 2pm kick-off, all welcome to come and cheer on the 2s!\n\nPhotos taken by Peter Wilkinson.\n\nPerthshire 26 – 26 Murrayfield Wanderers\n\nPerthshire regroup and fight back to secure draw.\n\nBoth teams arrived at the North Inch eager to play rugby; and as has been consistent this season the supporters down on the North Inch were treated to an exciting, enthralling game of rugby in which the momentum swung back and forth between two evenly matched teams.\n\nFollowing the kick-off neither team could make the breakthrough. Defence was resolute and Murrayfield were able to repel surging runs from Kyle MacKinnon and darting snipes from Aidan Watson. In defence James Mair and Shaun Barton were shutting down anything Murrayfield tried.\n\nWith about 10 minutes on the clock ‘Shire had a lineout 30m out. Quickly delivered off the top, Andrew Sanderson passed to Aidan Watson who ran a sweet loop around the centres creating an extra man to give Jonny Armitt the ball and a 2 on 1. Armitt ran on enough to interest the defender then sent a long pass out to Jay Pettie who took his chance brilliantly sprinting the remaining 20m to score in the corner. Despite the circling wind Calum Bruce made the tricky conversion to lead 7-0.\n\nPerthshire’s receipt off the restart has given coaches Alan Clark & Kenny Christie nightmares all season and so it proved again. Knocked on, Murrayfield were awarded a scrum and an immediate chance to strike back. From this platform Wanderers were patient, slowly building the phases in the forwards until a gap opened in midfield which was exploited to give them their first converted try of the match.\n\nNow it became very one-sided. Murrayfield were in the ascendancy and Perthshire went AWOL. Only some desperate defending by Angus Walker and Ross Goodison relieved the intense pressure. Perthshire missed touch with a clearance kick presenting an open backfield into which the Wanderers’ wing chipped & chased into. He hacked on again, just pipping the retreating ‘Shire defence to score under the posts and take the lead 7-14.\n\nIt went from bad to worse, for the team in Black & White. The bounce of the ball was going Murrayfield’s way and Shire were making life very difficult for themselves. Kicks failed to find touch or the chase was poor, tackles were missed and possession rapidly squandered. Twice denied after resolute defence of lineout mauls, Murrayfield took their third try after building patiently from a scrum within the 22. Unconverted and with 25 minutes on the clock they had a 7-19 point lead. Worse for the Eagles, early try scorer Jay Pettie was forced off the field with a knee injury.\n\nThis team has changed under Mat Rae’s leadership and the work of Alan Clark & Kenny Christie. In seasons gone by the rot would have continued and ‘Shire would have softened up allowing more scores in. Instead a switch seems to have gone on and ‘Shire took the game to Wanderers.\n\nWinning a scrum in the midfield the forwards set a solid platform. Aidan Watson noticed the defence was flat and collected his own chip over the top to get in behind. Multiple phases followed, the forwards putting in hard carries; with a penalty advantage Aidan Watson sent a high ball into the in-goal area. It bounced off the outstretched hands of the Murrayfield fullback into the arms of Ross Goodison to touch down for an unconverted try on the stroke of half-time; 12-19.\n\nContinuing in this vein Perthshire flew out of the blocks in the second half. Stuart Magill & Dan Rae were like demons tackling to bring down the heavy runners, meanwhile the back row of Calum Chalmers, James Mair and Shaun Barton were contesting every ruck turning many and giving Murrayfield no platform to attack.\n\nThe pressure was relentless. Scott Alcorn found the space in behind his opposite number on the wing with a precise kick through. Given the chance of trying to out manoeuvre Alcorn or head into touch, the wing took the latter. From the attacking lineout the Eagles turned the screw. Barrelling carries from Ewen MacDonald and Kyle MacKinnon forced a penalty. Opting for the scrum Perthshire were dominant, the ball was released and sent quickly through the hands to reach Mat Rae who used his strength & speed to better his opposite man and score. Calum Bruce brought it level to 19-19 with the conversion.\n\nThe game was tense, but ‘Shire were still on the front foot. Angus Walker was playing out of his skin to keep the ball moving forward, Dan Rae continued to put in the big hits and Aidan Watson was controlling things with Andrew Sanderson at the back of rucks. Penalties started mounting against Murrayfield, Calum Bruce just pulled wide in an effort to go ahead. Then moments later with Wanderers marched back for ill-discipline ‘Shire spurned the chance of an easier 3 points to go for the scrum. This time, the scrum buckled and Murrayfield countered. It was a quick attack and they made it right into the Perthshire 22 until they were stopped.\n\nThe match then descended in to a real end-to-end affair. Ross Goodison with only one boot danced and battered his way 60m up the touchline before stopped by a high tackle. Breaks were made by Mat Rae, Scott Alcorn, Calum Bruce and Claude Millée too, but each time something conspired to stop progress and Murrayfield attacked right back down the pitch.\n\nAfter one such Perthshire foray, Murrayfield had a defending scrum inside their 22. Somehow from first phase they found an opening in the centre and managed to run through getting the ball in behind the Black & White defensive line. Spun out to the wing the cover defence was beaten and, against the run of play with 15 minutes left, Murrayfield were ahead 19-26.\n\nA response was needed and Shaun Barton delivered with a stunning catch of the restart to put Perthshire into a strong attacking position. It was slow progress, maybe guilty of kicking possession away too readily rather than building up field the Eagles could not find the edge needed to draw level. The penalty count against Murrayfield crept ever higher, eventually the referee sent the openside flanker to the sin bin for the remainder of the match.\n\nStill the pressure built and the penalties came their way but Perthshire could not cross the line. Finally, the forwards took it upon themselves and slowly but surely crawled up the hard metres until just enough space opened for, Man of the Match, Aidan Watson to show & go then score the bonus point try in the last minute.\n\nWith no time left on the clock at 24-26, Calum Bruce stepped up to take the conversion. The 2 points would earn the draw. Coolly he slotted it over and there was great relief all around that Perthshire had the points to reflect the performance on the pitch.\n\nThis was the second meeting of these teams this season. At the away fixture Murrayfield Wanderers introduced the Adam Pattinson Memorial Cup which is to be contested each time these two teams play. Ads was a big man in Scottish Rugby who inspired many and it was great to see some of the family down to watch and Claire Pattinson present the trophy jointly to both captains in recognition of the draw.\n\nDue to the Autumn Internationals there was no 2XV fixture. Next week the 1XV travel to Hillhead to play in the rescheduled match with an 11am kick-off. Supporters welcome on the bus but beware, it is an early 7:30am departure.\n\nPhotos taken by Peter Wilkinson and Heather Kirkman.\n\nPerthshire 32 – 38 West of Scotland\n\nLast minute defeat for ‘Shire in an 11 try match\n\nAlways a close encounter, Perthshire welcomed West of Scotland to the North Inch. Conditions were near perfect for rugby, no wind, no rain and mild temperature. A reasonable crowd gathered and were not to be disappointed with the excitement played out over 80 minutes in front of them.\n\nPerthshire received the kick-off and immediately struck up field. Simple plays tested the West defence who were up to the task. Then West got a bit too enthusiastic at ruck time conceding a penalty. Without hesitation Aidan Watson played with the advantage to chip a cross-field kick left which was beautifully gathered by Jay Pettie who used his pace to beat the cover defence over 30m and dotted down the opening try which Calum Bruce duly converted.\n\nNext up Perthshire managed to clear their lines but West were undeterred. After a few phases in the forwards they managed to find some space in midfield and slick offloads allowed them to respond with an unconverted score.\n\nThis galvanised Perthshire who dominated in the forwards. Club Captain Macka, back in the 1s for the first time, was stealing lineout ball and the solid front 3 of Kyle MacKinnon, Ryan Moon and Ewen MacDonald were bossing the scrums all over the park. West had no reply and were pushed back into their half, a penalty kick went to the corner. The following lineout maul was clean and steamrollered over with Kyle MacKinnon at the back taking the try, Calum Bruce again adding the extras.\n\nThe remainder of the first half continued to see Perthshire dominate upfront. James Mair, Angus Walker and Calum Chalmers putting in fine performances securing rucks and winning turnovers. In the backline, centres Mat Rae & Calum Bruce would punch deep holes in the West defence and Aidan Watson was alive to any half chance. It was somewhat against the run of play that West, exploiting a mismatch on the wing, pulled an uncovered try back to give a half time score of 14-10.\n\nWest came out firing in the second half. Desperate defence and last gasp turnovers, especially from Angus Walker, saved Perthshire a good few times. One such turnover around halfway saw the ball passed back to the right where Ross Goodison, now playing centre, spotted a small gap and burst through. In the try of the match he proceeded to smash though 3 further tacklers over a 60m run to score – what a try, the crowd cheered that immensely!\n\nThis was a short reprieve as the penalty count mounted against the men in Black & White. Given ample opportunities West found spaces when ‘Shire were guilty of concentration lapses, squeezing in tight to the scrum in a fine set piece attack for a try under the posts.\n\nWorse was to follow, ‘Shire play a fast defence and Jonny Armitt was unlucky not to get an intercept knocking on; unfortunately moments later Jay Pettie was equally unlucky but this time the referee judged it a deliberate knock-on and dished out a yellow card.\n\nDown to 14 men, the Eagles tried to keep it tight and wear down the clock. It was hard going, Ewen MacDonald and James Mair making more than their fair share of carries. All of a sudden a gap opened up and Aidan Watson used his sharp mind and sharp pace to scream up the pitch. He covered 70m but was denied just short. The ‘Shire support got there quickly and the ball was worked to Angus Walker who surged over for the unconverted try.\n\nWest kicked the restart deep and Perthshire were stuck in their 22, escape was made difficult by the speed of West’s defence. Multiple forward phases made little ground and the ball then went out to the backs, under enormous pressure the kick went awry allowing West cheap possession in the 22 and with an in-built overlap they exploited within 2 phases to score and bring it level 24-24.\n\nPerthshire hit back into the West half and won a penalty about 40m out. Calum Bruce elected to kick and struck it well to regain the lead. Jay Pettie, having had time to reflect on what he’d done, returned as the team were restored to 15.\n\nIt was not too long before Jay made amends. On the counter attack Shaun Barton on the right wing ran up the touchline into the 22m and looked certain to emulate Ross Goodison’s earlier try until the cover defence bundled him out. West took the lineout quickly but it was read by the ‘Shire back row who immediately pounced on the hapless recipient who dropped the ball. Seized quickly the pack surged on and nearly made the line. Assessing the field, scrumhalf Andrew Sanderson sent the ball to Calum Chalmers who then passed long to the left wing where Jay Pettie was ready to dive over and give Perthshire an 8 point lead with 8 minutes left on the clock.\n\nThese remaining minutes were frantic. Both teams had expended their energy and there were tired bodies all round. West were mostly held for the next 4 minutes but made a break attacking into the Perthshire half. The scramble was good and ‘Shire looked to have won the turnover only for the referee to decide a supporting player came in the side and awarded West a penalty. With the wind in their sails West took a short penalty and going nowhere in the tight carries threw the ball wide finding the space to score and taking an excellent conversion made it a 1 point game, 32-31.\n\nOnly 2½ minutes left for Perthshire to hold the win. The restart was sent deep, West were going to have to win the match from their own 22. Tackle after tackle, ruck after ruck they made no distance. Into the final minute and they got their break. A flowing and offloading attack took them all the way across the line. The conversion was made and the final whistle blew. Elation for West and devastation for Perthshire.\n\nThis is the third time on the North Inch that West scored in the final play to seal the match. The bounce when it mattered didn’t go the Eagles’ way, but this was an improved performance. West now sit 2nd in the league table and Perthshire were ahead for 79 minutes. The next 2 matches against Strathmore (away on 23rd October) and Greenock (home on 30th October) will be critical for Perthshire to climb up the table. Supporters today made a difference and will do so again to lift the players in Black & White at these upcoming matches.\n\nUnfortunately, with 31 players in the Senior squad unavailable this weekend, there were insufficient numbers and the 2XV match was called off.\n\nPhotos taken by Peter Wilkinson."
