        "text": "As of 3 July, there have been a further 13 cases associated with the recent outbreak of STEC O145 since the last update on 27 June. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 288 in the UK. All currently confirmed cases had symptom onset dates before 10 June. Although case reporting rates are continuing to decline, we expect to see an additional small number of cases linked to this outbreak as further samples are referred to us from NHS laboratories and whole genome sequencing is conducted.\n\nConfirmed case totals:\n\n191 in England\n\n62 in Scotland\n\n31 in Wales\n\n4 in Northern Ireland (evidence suggests that they acquired their infection in England)\n\nBased on information from 263 cases to date, 49% were admitted to hospital.\n\nAmy Douglas, Incident Director at UKHSA, said:\n\nIt’s encouraging that reported cases are continuing to decline, however we still expect to see a few more cases linked to this outbreak as further samples are referred to us for testing.\n\nSymptoms of infections with STEC include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. While diarrhoea and vomiting can have a range of causes, there are simple steps you can take to reduce your risk and the risk of infecting others.\n\nWashing your hands with soap and warm water and using disinfectants to clean surfaces will help stop any further spread of infection. If you are unwell, you should not prepare food for others while unwell and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped. If you are concerned about your symptoms, follow NHS.UK guidance on when to seek help and the steps you can take to avoid further spread to family and friends.\n\nDarren Whitby, Head of Incidents at the Food Standards Agency, said:\n\nThe food chain investigation into this outbreak will continue to take account of any new information as it becomes available. We will continue to work with the relevant businesses, local authorities and agencies involved to ensure the necessary steps are in place to protect consumers.\n\nAs cases linked to this outbreak are now low and continue to decline, this week’s update (5 July) will be the final weekly report on case numbers unless there is a significant change.\n\nAs of 25 June, there have been a further 19 cases associated with the recent outbreak of STEC O145 since the last update a week ago, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 275 in the UK. All currently confirmed cases had symptom onset dates before 4 June. Although case reporting rates are declining, we expect to see more cases linked to this outbreak as further samples are referred to us from NHS laboratories and whole genome sequencing is conducted.\n\nConfirmed case totals:\n\n182 in England\n\n58 in Scotland\n\n31 in Wales\n\n4 in Northern Ireland (evidence suggests that they acquired their infection in England)\n\nBased on information from 249 cases to date, 49% were admitted to hospital.\n\nThrough surveillance, UKHSA has identified 2 individuals in England who died within 28 days of infection with the STEC outbreak strain. Based on the information available from health service clinicians one of these deaths is likely linked to their STEC infection. Both individuals had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred in May.\n\nAmy Douglas, Incident Director at UKHSA, said:\n\nWe’re pleased that fewer cases have been reported, however we still expect to see a few more cases linked to this outbreak as further samples are referred to us for testing.\n\nSymptoms of infections with STEC include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. While diarrhoea and vomiting can have a range of causes, there are simple steps you can take to reduce your risk and the risk of infecting others.\n\nWashing your hands with soap and warm water and using disinfectants to clean surfaces will help stop any further spread of infection. If you are unwell, you should not prepare food for others while unwell and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped. If you are concerned about your symptoms, follow NHS.UK guidance on when to seek help and the steps you can take to avoid further spread to family and friends.\n\nDarren Whitby, Head of Incidents at the FSA said:\n\nEarlier this month, we confirmed that several sandwich manufacturers had taken precautionary action to withdraw and recall various sandwiches, wraps, subs and rolls after food chain and epidemiological links enabled us to narrow down a wide range of foods to a type of lettuce used in sandwich products as the likely cause of the outbreak.\n\nThis remains a complex investigation and we continue to work with the relevant businesses and the local authorities to ensure necessary steps are being taken to protect consumers. Although we are confident in the likely source of the outbreak being linked to lettuce, work continues to confirm this and identify the root cause of the outbreak with the growers, suppliers and manufacturers so that actions can be taken to prevent a re-occurrence.\n\nFor more information, see the interim summary report from the multi-agency investigation into outbreak STEC O145 identified in May 2024.\n\nAs of 18 June, there have been a further 45 cases associated with the recent outbreak of STEC O145 since the last update (14 June), bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 256 in the UK. All currently confirmed cases had symptom onset dates before 31 May. Although the rate of cases has now slowed, we expect the figure to rise as NHS laboratories refer specimens to UKHSA for genomic sequencing which can link cases to this outbreak strain.\n\nConfirmed case totals:\n\n168 in England\n\n56 in Scotland\n\n29 in Wales\n\n3 in Northern Ireland (evidence suggests that they acquired their infection in England)\n\nBased on information from 227 cases to date, 38% were admitted to hospital.\n\nInvestigations have highlighted pre-packaged sandwich products containing lettuce as the likely source of the outbreak.\n\nBased on evidence to date, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) have published precautionary product recall notices covering a range of products that are potentially contaminated with E. coli. Working closely with the FSA, FSS and the devolved public health agencies, epidemiological investigations, whole genome sequence analysis and food chain investigations are still ongoing to confirm the cause of this outbreak.\n\nDr Colin Brown, Incident Director at UKHSA, said:\n\nSymptoms of infections with STEC include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. While diarrhoea and vomiting can have a range of causes, there are simple steps you can take to reduce your risk and risk of infecting others.\n\nWashing your hands with soap and warm water and using disinfectants to clean surfaces will help stop any further spread of infection. If you are unwell, you should not prepare food for others while unwell and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped. If you are concerned about your symptoms, follow NHS.UK guidance on when to seek help and the steps you can take to avoid further spread to family and friends.\n\nDarren Whitby, Head of Incidents at the FSA said:\n\nSeveral sandwich manufacturers have now taken precautionary action to withdraw and recall various sandwiches, wraps, subs and rolls, as food chain and epidemiological links have enabled us to narrow down a wide range of foods consumed to a small number of salad leaves that have been used in these in these products.\n\nThis follows extensive investigations into the cause of an ongoing outbreak caused by shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) which is being carried out by the FSA, FSS and UKHSA, working closely with the relevant enforcing authorities across Local Authorities). A full list of products implicated in the product recalls can be found in the product recall notices (PRINs).\n\nThis remains a complex investigation and we continue to work at pace with the relevant businesses and local authorities to ensure necessary steps are being taken to protect consumers.\n\nAlthough we are confident in the source of the outbreak being linked to a small number of salad leaves, which we identified early on through extensive food chain analysis, work continues to identify the root cause of the outbreak with the growers, suppliers and manufacturers so that actions can be taken to prevent a re-occurrence. We will remain vigilant until the root cause of the outbreak is confirmed and we are keeping an open mind about possible causes of the outbreak. Information is being gathered at pace and is under constant review to ensure we minimise any further risk to consumers.\n\nAs of 11 June, there have been a further 98 cases associated with this outbreak of STEC O145 in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 211. All cases had sample dates before 31 May, but we expect this figure to rise as whole genome sequencing is ongoing to find any further cases which may be linked to the outbreak.\n\n147 in England\n\n27 in Wales\n\n35 in Scotland\n\n2 in Northern Ireland (for these cases, evidence suggests that they acquired their infection while visiting England)\n\nBased on information from 160 cases to date, 42% were admitted to hospital.\n\nUKHSA has worked closely with the FSA, FSS and the devolved public health agencies to investigate the incident, carrying out epidemiological investigations and whole genome sequence analysis to help identify foods commonly consumed by the cases.\n\nAs a result of evidence gathered to date, product recall information notices have been published by FSA as a precaution.\n\nTrish Mannes, Incident Director at UKHSA, said:\n\nWe would like to thank all the cases who have provided information that has enabled us, through epidemiological analysis of questionnaire data and food tracing investigations, to narrow down the likely food product linked to this outbreak.\n\nSymptoms of infections with STEC include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you are unwell, have eaten salad leaves recently and are concerned about any symptoms, follow NHS.uk guidance on when to seek help and the steps you can take to avoid further spread to family and friends.\n\nWhile diarrhoea and vomiting can have a range of causes, there are simple steps you can take to reduce your risk and risk of infecting others. Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using disinfectants to clean surfaces will help stop any further spread of infection. If you are unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting, you should not prepare food for others while unwell and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.\n\nDarren Whitby, Head of Incidents at the FSA, said:\n\nSandwich manufacturers are taking a precautionary measure to recall various sandwiches, wraps, subs and rolls in response to findings from investigations by the FSA, FSS and UKHSA who are working to identify the cause of an ongoing outbreak caused by shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC). The full list of products can be found in the product recall information notice (PRIN).\n\nThis is a complex investigation, and we have worked swiftly with the relevant businesses and the local authorities concerned to narrow down the wide range of foods consumed to a small number of salad leaf products that have been used in sandwiches, wraps, subs and rolls. Following thorough food chain analysis, these products are being recalled as a precaution.\n\nInfections caused by STEC bacteria can cause severe bloody diarrhoea and, in some cases, more serious complications. We therefore advise any consumers who have any of these products not to eat them.\n\nThe FSA is here to ensure that food is safe. If there are products on the market that are not, we won’t hesitate to take action to remove them.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), together with public health agencies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, are investigating an increase in the number of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) cases in the UK in recent weeks.\n\nInfections caused by STEC bacteria can cause severe bloody diarrhoea and, in some cases, more serious complications. It is often transmitted by eating contaminated food but can also be spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal or its environment.\n\nWhole genome sequencing of samples in the current investigation indicates that most cases are part of a single outbreak. Based on the wide geographic spread of cases, it is most likely that this outbreak is linked to a nationally distributed food item or multiple food items. The source of this outbreak is not yet confirmed but there is currently no evidence linking the outbreak to open farms, drinking water or swimming in contaminated seawater, lakes or rivers. The public health agencies are working with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland to investigate further.\n\nAs of 4 June, there have been 113 confirmed cases associated with this outbreak of STEC O145 in the UK, all reported since 25 May 2024:\n\n81 in England\n\n18 in Wales\n\n13 in Scotland\n\n1 in Northern Ireland (for this case, evidence suggests that they acquired their infection while visiting England)\n\nTypically, we see around 1,500 cases of STEC over a full year. Numbers of confirmed cases associated with this outbreak are expected to rise as further samples undergo whole genome sequencing.\n\nCases range in age from 2 years old to 79 years old, with the majority of cases in young adults. Of the 81 cases identified to date in England, 61 have provided information to UKHSA related to food, travel and potential exposures and of these we know that 61% have been hospitalised.\n\nWhile the source of this outbreak is currently unknown, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of gastrointestinal infections, as well as limiting the spread to others:\n\nregularly wash your hands with warm water and soap — alcohol gels do not kill all bugs that cause diarrhoeal illness\n\nfollow food hygiene measures such as washing fruit and vegetables and cooking food properly\n\nif you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you should not prepare food for others and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection\n\nyou should not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped\n\nTrish Mannes, Incident Director at UKHSA, said:\n\nSymptoms of infections with STEC include severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends. NHS.UK has information on what to do if you have symptoms and when to seek medical advice.\n\nWashing your hands with soap and warm water and using disinfectants to clean surfaces will help stop infections from spreading. If you are unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting, you should not prepare food for others and avoid visiting people in hospitals or care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.\n\nDarren Whitby, Head of Incidents and Resilience at the FSA, said:\n\nThe FSA is working with UKHSA and relevant Public Health bodies to identify the source of the illness, which is likely to be linked to one or more food items.\n\nWe always advise consumers and those looking after vulnerable people to ensure good hygiene practices are followed when handling and preparing food, regularly washing hands with soap and warm water and ensuring equipment, utensils and surfaces foods come into contact with are cleaned thoroughly to prevent cross contamination.\n\nYou should not prepare food for others if you have had symptoms, or for 48 hours after symptoms stop. You can find more information about good hygiene practises – 4c’s, and E. coli on our website.\n\nJim McMenamin, Head of Health Protection (infection Services), Public Health Scotland, said:\n\nTo help stop infections like E. coli from spreading, we advise regular hand washing using soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. People should also use disinfectants to clean surfaces that may be contaminated. Anyone experiencing severe and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever should call their GP or 111 to seek advice. Anyone with diarrhoea or vomiting should avoid attending places such as schools, workplaces or social gatherings until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have ceased.\n\nWendi Shepherd, Consultant in Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said:\n\nPublic Health Wales is working with partners in the UK and across the Welsh NHS to investigate this incident. There are currently 18 cases identified in Wales and healthcare providers have been advised of the increase in cases. We would advise anyone who has experienced bloody diarrhoea or severe stomach cramps to seek medical attention.\n\nCall NHS 111 or contact your GP surgery if:\n\nyou’re worried about a baby under 12 months\n\nyour child stops breast or bottle feeding while they’re ill\n\na child under 5 years has signs of dehydration, such as fewer wet nappies\n\nyou or your child (over 5 years) still have signs of dehydration after using oral rehydration sachets\n\nyou or your child keep being sick and cannot keep fluid down\n\nyou or your child have bloody diarrhoea or bleeding from the bottom\n\nyou or your child have diarrhoea for more than 7 days or vomiting for more than 2 days\n\n111 will give you advice. They can arrange a phone call from a nurse or doctor if you need one.\n\nFurther information and advice will be published as the investigation continues. Not all outbreak investigations identify a source, particularly for products that quickly leave the supply chain.\n\nHealthcare workers have been informed of the increase in cases and reminded of clinical management guidance.\n\nBackground\n\nSTEC can be carried by cattle, sheep and other animals. Spread to humans occurs through:\n\nconsumption of contaminated food or water\n\ncontact with animals or their faeces\n\ncontact with a contaminated environment\n\nperson-to-person spread, often resulting in multiple people in one household becoming infected\n\nNHS.UK webpage: Diarrhoea and vomiting\n\nFor Scotland: NHS Inform advice on diarrhoea or gastroenteritis"
