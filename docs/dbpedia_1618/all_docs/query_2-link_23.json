        "text": "Association football club in Glasgow, Scotland\n\nThis article is about the men's football club. For the women's team, see Rangers W.F.C.\n\nFootball club\n\nRangers Football Club is a professional football club in Glasgow, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of Scottish football. The club is often referred to as Glasgow Rangers, though this has never been its official name.[3] The fourth-oldest football club in Scotland, Rangers was founded by four teenage boys as they walked through West End Park (now Kelvingrove Park) in March 1872 where they discussed the idea of forming a football club, and played its first match against the now defunct Callander at the Fleshers' Haugh area of Glasgow Green in May of the same year. Rangers' home ground, Ibrox Stadium, designed by stadium architect Archibald Leitch and opened in 1929, is a Category B listed building and the third-largest football stadium in Scotland. The club has always played in royal blue shirts.[4]\n\nRangers have won the Scottish League title a record 55 times, the Scottish Cup 34 times, the Scottish League Cup a record 28 times and the domestic treble on seven occasions. Rangers won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 after being losing finalists twice, in 1961 (the first British club to reach a UEFA tournament final) and 1967. The club has lost a further two European finals; they reached the UEFA Cup Final in 2008 and a fourth runners-up finish in European competition came in the UEFA Europa League Final in 2022.\n\nRangers has a long-standing rivalry with Celtic, the two Glasgow clubs being collectively known as the Old Firm, which is considered one of the world's biggest football derbies.[5][6] With more than 600 Rangers supporters' clubs in 35 countries worldwide, Rangers has one of the largest fanbases in world football.[7] The club holds the record for the largest travelling support in football history, when an estimated 200,000 Rangers fans arrived in the city of Manchester for the 2008 UEFA Cup final.[8][9] Rangers also took the largest ever travelling support abroad when an estimated 100,000 fans arrived in Seville for the 2022 UEFA Europa League Final.[10]\n\nOne of the 11 original members of the Scottish Football League,[11] Rangers remained in the top division continuously until a financial crisis during the 2011–12 season saw the club enter administration[12] and the original company liquidated[13][14] with the assets moved to a new company structure.[15] The club was accepted as an associate member of the Scottish Football League and placed in the fourth tier of the Scottish football league system in time for the start of the following season. Rangers then won three promotions in four years, returning to the Premiership for the start of the 2016–17 season. While in the Scottish lower divisions, Rangers became the only club in Scotland to have won every domestic trophy. In 2020–21, Rangers won the Scottish Premiership, their first Scottish championship in ten years, a then world record fifty-fifth league win. It also stopped rivals Celtic in their quest to break the domestic record by winning ten titles in a row.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation, early years and William Wilton\n\nRangers were formed by four founders – brothers Moses McNeil and Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath – who met at West End Park (now known as Kelvingrove Park) in March 1872. Rangers' first match, in May that year, was a goalless friendly draw with Callander on Glasgow Green. David Hill was also a founder member.[16] In 1873, the club held its first annual meeting and staff were elected.[17][18] By 1876, Rangers had its first international player, with Moses McNeil representing Scotland in a match against Wales.[19] In 1877, Rangers reached the Scottish Cup final; after drawing the first game, Rangers refused to turn up for the replay and the cup was awarded to Vale of Leven. Rangers won the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup the following year against Vale of Leven 2–1, their first major cup.[20][21] The first-ever match against Celtic took place in 1888, the year after the East End club's establishment. Rangers lost 5–2 in a friendly to an opposition composed largely of guest players from Hibernian.[22][23][24]\n\nThe 1890–91 season saw the inception of the Scottish Football League, and Rangers, by then playing at the first Ibrox Stadium, were one of ten original members. The club's first-ever league match, on 16 August 1890, resulted in a 5–2 victory over Heart of Midlothian. After finishing joint-top with Dumbarton, a play-off held at Cathkin Park finished 2–2 and the title was shared for the only time in its history. Rangers' first-ever Scottish Cup win came in 1894 after a 3–1 final victory over rivals Celtic. By the start of the 20th century, Rangers had won two league titles and three Scottish Cups.[18][20][25][26] During William Wilton's time as match secretary and then team manager, Rangers won ten league titles.\n\nBill Struth and Scot Symon\n\nTaking over as manager after William Wilton's death in 1920, Bill Struth was Rangers' most successful manager, guiding the club to 14 league titles before the onset of the Second World War. On 2 January 1939, a British league attendance record was broken as 118,567 fans turned out to watch Rangers beat Celtic in the traditional New Year's Day Old Firm match.[27] Leading the club for 34 years until 1954, Struth won more trophies than any manager in Scottish Football history, amassing 18 league championships, 10 Scottish Cups, two League Cups, seven war-time championships, 19 Glasgow Cups, 17 Glasgow Merchant Charity Cups and other war-time honours.[17][28] During the wartime regional league setup (in which the team won all seven seasons, along with official championships either side of the conflict in 1938–39 and 1946–47), Rangers achieved their highest score against Celtic with an 8–1 win in the Southern Football League.[29][30][31]\n\nScot Symon continued Struth's success, winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups, becoming the second manager to win the domestic treble in 1963–64 season, the era of 'Slim' Jim Baxter, one of the club's greatest players.[32][33] Rangers also lost by their biggest Old Firm margin of 7–1.[29]\n\nRangers reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960, losing to German club Eintracht Frankfurt by a record aggregate 12–4 for a Scottish team.[34] In 1961 Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the Cup Winners' Cup final against Italian side Fiorentina, only to lose 4–1 on aggregate.[35] Rangers lost again in the final of the same competition in 1967, by a single goal, after extra time, to Bayern Munich.[26]\n\nIbrox disaster, European success and Jock Wallace\n\nThe Ibrox disaster occurred on 2 January 1971 when large-scale crushing on a stairway exit at the culmination of an Old Firm game claimed 66 lives. An enquiry concluded that the crush was likely to have happened ten minutes after the final whistle and to have been triggered by someone falling on the stairs.[36] A benefit match to raise funds for the victims' families took place after the disaster, a joint Rangers and Celtic team playing a Scotland XI at Hampden, watched by 81,405 fans.[37]\n\nIn 1972, Rangers emerged from the tragedy of the previous year to finally achieve success on the European stage. A Colin Stein goal and a Willie Johnston double helped secure a 3–2 victory over Dynamo Moscow at the Nou Camp, Barcelona, to lift the European Cup Winners' Cup. Captain John Greig received the trophy in a small room within the Nou Camp following pitch invasions by Rangers fans reacting to the heavy handed tactics of the Spanish police, the majority of whom had been brought in from outwith Catalonia.[38] Rangers were banned from Europe for two years for the behaviour of their fans, later reduced on appeal to one year.[39]\n\nThe following season saw the club compete in the first ever European Super Cup, although the European ban saw it officially recognised as Rangers centenary anniversary match. The side played the European Cup holders Ajax, who had first proposed the idea, in January 1973. The Dutch side proved too strong and recorded a 6–3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1–3 at Ibrox and 3–2 in Amsterdam.[40]\n\nEmerging from the shadows of Jock Stein's Celtic side, Rangers regained ascendancy with notable domestic success under the stewardship of manager Jock Wallace. In his first season in charge – the club's centenary – Rangers won the Scottish Cup at Hampden in front of 122,714 supporters.[41] In 1974–75, Wallace led Rangers to their first League championship triumph in 11 years, before winning the treble the following season, repeating the historic feat in 1977–78.[42]\n\nJohn Greig served as manager for five years but was unable to achieve the success as a manager that he had as a player. Unable to win the league during his reign, he was replaced by Wallace returning in 1983. Wallace was unable to repeat the success of his first period in charge with a win ratio of less than 50%, and was himself replaced by Graeme Souness in 1986.\n\nGraeme Souness, Walter Smith and 9-in-a-row\n\nEvery year from the 1988–89 season until the 1996–97 season, Rangers won the league title. This nine-in-a-row achievement equalled Celtic's record, set prior to the forming of the Scottish Football League Premier Division, subsequent to which competing teams met four times a season. The first three of these seasons the club was managed by Graeme Souness; the latter six under the stewardship of Walter Smith.[43]\n\nNotable seasons included 1990–91, which culminated in a last-day finale, Rangers securing a 2–0 victory at Ibrox over Aberdeen, who needed only a draw to secure the championship. Season 1992–93 was notable for a domestic treble of trophies, as well an extended run in the inaugural UEFA Champions League, the club at one stage only one goal from securing a place in the final.[44]\n\nRangers' ninth consecutive championship title was secured at Tannadice Park on 7 May 1997, with a single-goal victory over Dundee United.[45]\n\nDick Advocaat, Alex McLeish and Paul Le Guen\n\nIn 1998, Dutchman Dick Advocaat became the club's first foreign manager.[46] Nine-in-a-row era stalwarts having moved on, Advocaat invested heavily in the team with immediate results, leading the club to their sixth domestic treble. The league championship was won with a 3–0 victory at Celtic Park on 2 May 1999.[47] A second-consecutive league title was won by a record 21-point margin,[48] the club securing a domestic double with a 4–0 Scottish Cup final victory over Aberdeen. Rangers' campaign in the Champions League saw them defeat UEFA Cup winners Parma en route.[49][50]\n\nAdvocaat's third season saw Rangers fail to compete domestically against Celtic under new manager Martin O'Neill. Despite investment in the team, including Tore Andre Flo for a club-record £12 million,[51] European success beyond the Champions League group stages again proved elusive.[52] After a slow start to the following season, Advocaat resigned from his post in December 2001 and was replaced by Alex McLeish.[53]\n\nIn his first full campaign, the 2002–03 season saw McLeish become the sixth Rangers manager to deliver a domestic treble.[54] The championship was won on goal difference during a dramatic final day 6–1 triumph over Dunfermline Athletic at Ibrox,[55] securing Rangers' 50th league title, the first club in the world to achieve the feat.[56] Major expenditure sanctioned by chairman David Murray had burdened Rangers with considerable debts in the region of £52m.[57] The club's worsening financial state saw many of the team's top players leave in the summer of 2003, the following season failing to deliver any trophies, only the second such occasion since 1985–86.[58]\n\nThe 2004–05 season restored success to Rangers, who were boosted by signings such as Jean-Alain Boumsong,[59] Dado Pršo[60] and Nacho Novo,[61] along with the return of former captain Barry Ferguson after a spell in England with Blackburn Rovers.[62] The club's league championship triumph culminated in a dramatic final-day finish. The destination of the trophy changed unexpectedly, with Celtic conceding late goals to Motherwell at Fir Park whilst Rangers led against Hibernian, requiring the helicopter carrying the SPL trophy to change direction and deliver the prize to the Easter Road ground in Leith.[63][64]\n\nDespite beginning as favourites to retain the championship, Rangers suffered an unprecedented run of poor results between September and November, a club-record run of ten games without a win. Included within this period, a 1–1 draw with Inter Milan took Rangers into the last 16 of the Champions League, the first Scottish team to achieve the feat since 1993,[65] the club eventually exiting on the away goals rule to Villarreal.[66] On 9 February 2006, it was announced by David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season.[67]\n\nFrenchman Paul Le Guen replaced Alex McLeish as manager after season 2005–06.[68] The season started with an early exit from the League Cup[69] whilst Celtic built a commanding lead at the top of the table.[70] In the UEFA Cup, Rangers became the first Scottish side to qualify for the last 32 of the competition, since the introduction of the group phase, after finishing their group unbeaten.[71] However, amid claims of disharmony between the manager and captain Barry Ferguson,[72] it was announced on 4 January 2007 that Le Guen had left Rangers by mutual consent.[73]\n\nWalter Smith's return and Ally McCoist\n\nOn 10 January 2007, former boss Walter Smith resigned from his post as Scotland manager to return to the Ibrox helm, with Ally McCoist as assistant manager.[74]\n\nThe following season Rangers contested the UEFA Cup after dropping into the competition from the Champions League.[75] The club reached the final, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way.[76] The final in Manchester against Zenit Saint Petersburg, who were managed by former Rangers manager Dick Advocaat,[77] ended in a 2–0 defeat.[78] An estimated 200,000 supporters travelled to Manchester for the event,[79] and the 2008 UEFA Cup final riots occurred.\n\nThe 2008–09 season saw Rangers recover from an early exit from the UEFA Champions League to FBK Kaunas of Lithuania.[80] The club secured its 52nd league championship on the last day of the season with a 3–0 victory at Dundee United.[81] Rangers also successfully defended the Scottish Cup, defeating Falkirk 1–0 in the final.[82]\n\nThe 2009–10 season saw Rangers reach their fifth consecutive domestic final: against St Mirren in the Scottish League Cup, the club overcame a two-men deficit from red cards, a late deciding goal from Kenny Miller securing the victory.[83] The league championship title was retained, with three matches remaining, at Easter Road, defeating Hibernian 1–0 with a Kyle Lafferty goal. The 2010–11 season, Smith's final season in charge, saw Rangers retain the League Cup, defeating Celtic at Hampden with a Nikica Jelavić goal in extra time.[84] A third consecutive title was won by beating Kilmarnock 5–1 on the last day of the season, Smith's final match in charge of the club.[85]\n\nAlly McCoist took over from Walter Smith in June 2011 but season 2011–12 started with Rangers eliminated from two European competitions before the end of August: losing to Swedish side Malmö in the Champions League third round qualifying match,[86] and to Slovenian side Maribor in a Europa League qualifying match.[87] While good league form saw Rangers in top spot after being unbeaten for the first 15 games, they were knocked out of the League Cup by Falkirk[88] and the Scottish Cup by Dundee United at Ibrox.[89] Rangers were placed into administration on 14 February 2012 resulting in the club being deducted 10 points as per SPL rules.[90] Though Rangers avoided having Celtic win the championship at Ibrox on 25 March by winning the game 3–2, Rangers ultimately finished 20 points behind Celtic in second place.[91]\n\nInsolvency and the lower leagues\n\nOn 1 June 2012, after four months in administration, a failure to reach a CVA agreement with creditors led to The Rangers Football Club plc (since renamed RFC 2012 plc)[92] entering the process of liquidation.[93] The administrators completed a sale of the business and assets to a new company, Sevco Scotland Ltd (which later renamed itself The Rangers Football Club Ltd), though most first-team players refused to transfer across.[94][95] The new company failed to secure the transfer of Rangers' previous place in the Scottish Premier League,[96] but were later accepted into the Scottish Football League. Rangers were awarded associate membership and placed in the lowest division, the Third, rather than the First Division as the SPL and SFA had sought.[97] The transfer of Rangers' SFA membership was agreed by the SFA upon acceptance of a number of conditions, including a one-year transfer ban, in time for the club to begin the 2012–13 season.[98]\n\nWith most key Rangers players having refused to transfer to the new company, a very different Rangers team lined up for the first league match in the Third Division though it secured a comfortable 5–1 victory over East Stirlingshire in front of a crowd of 49,118, a world record for a football match in a fourth tier league.[99][n 1] Away from home, Rangers started their league campaign with three successive draws before losing 1–0 to Stirling Albion, at the time the bottom club in the country.[101] Rangers were defeated in the third round of the Scottish Challenge Cup by Queen of the South at Ibrox,[102] in the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle[103] and in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup by Dundee United.[104] Rangers beat their own new record against Queens Park with an attendance of 49,463[105] and again against Stirling Albion with an attendance of 49,913.[106] Rangers clinched the Third Division title on 30 March after a goalless draw at Montrose.\n\nApart from being defeated 2–1 by Forfar Athletic in the first round of the League Cup on 3 August, season 2013–14 got off to an excellent start with Rangers winning maximum league points in their first 15 games in League One, before being held to a draw at home by Stranraer on Boxing Day 2013. Rangers secured the League One title and promotion to Scottish football's second tier on 12 March 2014 and went on to end the season unbeaten in league football.[107] Rangers also reached the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup, in which they lost to Raith Rovers[108] and the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, in which they lost 3–1 at Ibrox to Dundee United.\n\nPlaying in the Scottish Championship in season 2014–15 provided Rangers with a more difficult challenge, with the club losing home and away to both Hibernian[109][110] and Hearts[111][112] and also losing away to Queen of the South[113] in the first half of the season. Rangers also failed to beat Alloa either home or away in the league before losing 3–2 to Alloa in the semi-final of the Scottish Challenge Cup.[114] Amid mounting criticism,[115] McCoist submitted his resignation intending to honour his 12 months notice period but was placed on gardening leave and replaced by Kenny McDowall on a caretaker basis.[116] McDowall remained in charge for just three months before resigning in March 2015. During his time in charge, Rangers won just three matches. Rangers then named former player Stuart McCall as their third manager of the season for the remaining fixtures.[117] Under McCall, Rangers finished third in the league and then reached the Premiership play-off final, which they lost 6–1 on aggregate to Motherwell.[118]\n\nWarburton, Premiership return, Caixinha and Murty\n\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Mark Warburton had been appointed as manager on a three-year deal.[119] Rangers went on to win the 2015–16 Scottish Championship and automatic promotion to the Scottish Premiership, ending their four-year stint in the lower divisions. The club also reached the 2016 Scottish Cup Final, beating Old Firm rivals Celtic in the semi-final at Hampden,[120] before losing to Hibernian in the final.[121] After a poor first half of the 2016–17 season, Mark Warburton and David Weir left Rangers on 10 February 2017, and Graeme Murty was placed in caretaker control of the Rangers first team.[122][123] Pedro Caixinha eventually took over as permanent manager.\n\nCaixinha's first full season started with Rangers suffering one of the worst results in their history. After winning 1–0 at Ibrox, Rangers lost 2–0 to Luxembourg minnows Progrès Niederkorn, resulting in Rangers being knocked out 2–1 on aggregate in the first qualifying round of the 2017–18 Europa League. Progrès had never before won a tie and had only ever scored once before in European competition.[124] After that disappointing start to the season the form did not improve, with notable results including a 2–0 reverse to Celtic at home in the league[125] and defeat to Motherwell in the Scottish League Cup semi-final by the same scoreline.[126] On 26 October, a day after a 95th-minute equaliser at Ibrox by last-placed Kilmarnock saw Rangers draw 1–1, Caixinha was sacked and Graeme Murty took over as caretaker manager again. The Portuguese manager's reign was described as \"a desperate mess from start to finish\".[127]\n\nIn late December, after a search for a more experienced manager proved unsuccessful, including a failed attempt to appoint Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes, Murty (who had won back-to-back games over Aberdeen[128][129] and also defeated Hibernian away from home[130] during his interim spell) was appointed to the role until the end of the season.[131] On 1 May 2018, Murty's second spell in charge ended prematurely when he was sacked as manager following a 5–0 defeat to Celtic which resulted in Celtic winning their 7th consecutive league title.[132] Rangers again ended the season in 3rd place, behind Celtic and Aberdeen for the second year in a row.[133]\n\nThe Gerrard era\n\nOn 4 May 2018, former Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard was confirmed as the new manager of Rangers on a four-year contract.[134] Gerrard's era started successfully with Rangers remaining unbeaten in their first 12 games, clinching a place in the UEFA Europa League group stage in the process.[135] However, Rangers were then defeated by Celtic in the first Old Firm match of the season,[136] and the following month were eliminated from the League Cup by Aberdeen.[137] On 29 December, Rangers defeated Celtic at Ibrox to inflict Brendan Rodgers' first defeat in 13 Old Firm games; Rangers first win over Celtic since a Scottish Cup victory in April 2016 and their first league win over Celtic since March 2012.[138] Aberdeen knocked Rangers out of a cup for the second time in the season after securing a 2–0 victory in the Scottish Cup at Ibrox on 12 March 2019.[139]\n\nThe 2019–20 season began with Rangers again qualifying for the UEFA Europa League group stage before losing 2–0 to Celtic at Ibrox in the first Old Firm match of the season on 1 September. The following day, the club signed Ryan Kent from Liverpool for £7 million. Rangers reached the final of the League Cup, but despite a dominant performance, were beaten 1–0 by Celtic.[140] On 12 December, Rangers progressed to the UEFA Europa League Round of 32 as group runners-up after a 1–1 draw with Young Boys which secured European football beyond Christmas for the first time since the 2010–11 season.[141] On 29 December, Rangers beat Celtic 2–1 at Celtic Park, their first win at their arch rival's stadium since October 2010.[142] However, a slump in form thereafter, including losing to Hearts in the Scottish Cup and Hamilton in the league within five days, left Rangers 13 points adrift of Celtic a week into March.[143] However, all professional football in Scotland was suspended later that month due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.[144][145] On 18 May 2020, the SPFL officially ended the season, and Celtic were awarded the league title which was determined by points per game.[146]\n\nOn 7 March 2021, Rangers won the league title for the first time in ten years,[147] going on to end the league campaign undefeated, with a club record 102 points.[148]\n\nGiovanni van Bronckhorst, Europa League Final and Michael Beale return\n\nMidway through the 2021–22 season, Steven Gerrard left Rangers for Aston Villa, and was replaced by former Rangers midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst on 11 November 2021. He led Rangers to their first European final in fourteen years, beating Borussia Dortmund, Red Star Belgrade, Braga and RB Leipzig on the way to facing Eintracht Frankfurt in the 2022 UEFA Europa League Final. He also took the club to their first Scottish Cup final in six years, in which they beat Hearts.[149]\n\nIn the 2022–23 season, Rangers qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time since the 2010–11 season. They went on to lose all six group matches against Napoli, Liverpool, and Ajax with only two goals scored and a −20 goal difference overall, setting the worst performance in a Champions League group stage, surpassing Dinamo Zagreb's −19 goal difference in the 2011–12 season.[150] Giovanni van Bronckhorst was sacked on 21 November 2022, after also falling nine points behind Celtic in the Scottish Premiership.[151] Michael Beale, a coach under previous manager Steven Gerrard, succeeded van Bronckhorst on 28 November 2022.[152] After a winning start, Beale had turned around results quickly; however, they lost out in both cup competitions against Celtic and finished the 2022–23 season seven points behind their rivals. After a summer rebuild, Rangers lost on the opening day of the 2023–24 season to Kilmarnock; their hopes of qualifying for that seasons Champions League was also crushed after losing to PSV Eindhoven. Beale was sacked as manager on 1 October 2023, the defeat to Aberdeen at Ibrox the culmination of a very poor run of results.\n\nCrest and colours\n\nCrest\n\nUnusually for a football club, Rangers have two different official crests. Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the lion rampant club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters RFC overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881–82 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto Ready, which was shortened from Aye Ready (meaning Always Ready in Scots), all surrounded by the team name, Rangers Football Club. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s and then once more in 2020 to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978–79 season.[153][154]\n\nThe current lion rampant club crest. Never appeared on the shirt.\n\nThe way the scroll crest has appeared on the club shirt has varied slightly through the years. Between 1990 and 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto appeared above and below the Crest respectively. Between 1997 and 1999 the scroll crest featured within a shield. After a successful end to the season in 2003, which delivered Rangers a Domestic Treble and their 50th league title; five stars were added to the top of the scroll crest, one for every ten titles won by the club. The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872–2012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.[155][156]\n\nKit crest history\n\nScroll crest, appeared on the chest of the Rangers shirt since 1968\n\nScroll crest version with banner and 'Ready' motto, worn on shirts between 1990 and 1995\n\nScroll crest with five stars, worn on the Rangers shirt since 2003\n\nColours\n\nThe club colours of Rangers F.C. are royal blue, white and red. However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.[156]\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue six pointed star on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a third kit. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.[157] Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993–94,[157] worn once in 2002–03[158] and reintroduced in 2018–19[158] and 2022–23,[159] have caused controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the Orange Order.[158]\n\nSelection of Rangers kits through history[156]\n\nSince 1978 when Rangers signed a deal with Umbro they have had a specific kit manufacturer and since 1984 have had a kit sponsor. The following tables detail Rangers' shirt sponsors and kit suppliers by year:\n\nKit suppliers[156] Period Supplier 1978–1990 Umbro 1990–1992 Admiral 1992–1997 Adidas 1997–2002 Nike 2002–2005 Diadora[160] 2005–2013 Umbro[161] 2013–2018 Puma[162][163] 2018–2020 Hummel[164] 2020–present Castore[165]\n\nFront of shirt sponsors[156] Period Sponsor 1984–1987 CR Smith[166][167] 1987–1999 McEwan's Lager[166][167] 1999–2003 NTL[168][166] 2003–2010 Carling[169] 2010–2013 Tennent's[170][171] 2013–2014 Blackthorn[172] 2014–2023 32Red[173][174] 2023–present Unibet[175][176]\n\nBack of shirt sponsors[156] Period Sponsor Position 2017–2020 Utilita[177] Top 2020–2021 The Energy Check[178] Bottom 2020–present SEKO Logistics[179] Top 2021–2022 Sportemon Go[180] Bottom 2022–2023 Socomec[181] Bottom\n\nSleeve sponsors[156] Period Sponsor 2020–2022 Tomket Tires[182] 2022–present BOXT[183]\n\nShorts sponsors[156] Period Sponsor 2023–present AIM Building & Maintenance Services[184]\n\nWhen Rangers played French sides in 1996–97 and 1997–98, they wore the logo of Center Parcs instead of McEwan's Lager, due to a French ban on alcohol advertising.[185] Later matches in France (when the club was sponsored by Carling) saw the club play with no shirt sponsor, in 2006[186] and 2007.[187]\n\nDuring 32Red's sponsorship, Rangers faced NK Osijek in 2018–19 wearing unsponsored training gear due to Croatia's ban on gambling advertising.[158] Team Talk, an arm of the Rangers Charity Foundation, appeared on the shirts on two occasions in 2021–22: away in Leipzig, as Unibet hold no licence for Germany; and in the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League final against Eintracht Frankfurt, as gambling advertisements are banned in Spain.[188]\n\nMascot\n\nBroxi Bear is the official mascot of Rangers. Its name is derived from Rangers' home stadium, Broxi being an anagram of Ibrox. Broxi is a brown bear with blue inner ears and nose, wearing a Rangers strip.[189] He made his first appearance in a 2–2 draw against Raith Rovers on 13 November 1993.[190] Broxi was later accompanied by his \"wife\" Roxi and their \"son\" Boris[189] although from 2001 Roxi and Boris no longer made any on-field appearances at Ibrox.[191] Roxi and Boris did continue to appear on some club merchandise.[189] On 9 September 2017, Roxi and Boris were re-introduced before a 4–1 win against Dundee.\n\nStadium and training facility\n\nMain articles: Ibrox Stadium and Rangers Training Centre\n\nThe club used a variety of grounds in Glasgow as a venue for home matches in the years between 1872 and 1899. The first was Fleshers' Haugh, situated on Glasgow Green, followed by Burnbank Park in the Kelvinbridge area of the city, and then Kinning Park for ten years from the mid-1870s to the mid-1880s. From February of the 1886–87 season, Cathkin Park was used until the first Ibrox Park, in the Ibrox area of south-west Glasgow, was inaugurated for the following season. Ibrox Stadium in its current incarnation was originally designed by the architect Archibald Leitch, a Rangers fan who also played a part in the design of, among others, Old Trafford in Manchester and Highbury in London. The stadium was inaugurated on 30 December 1899, and Rangers defeated Hearts 3–1 in the first match held there.[192][193]\n\nRangers' training facility is located in the Auchenhowie area of Milngavie, Glasgow; it was initially named Murray Park after former chairman and owner Sir David Murray, but has since been renamed. It was proposed by then-manager Dick Advocaat upon his arrival at the club in 1998.[46] It was completed in 2001 at a cost of £14 million. The training centre was the first purpose-built facility of its kind in Scotland, and incorporates features including nine football pitches, a gym, a hydrotherapy pool, and a video-editing suite. Rangers' youth teams are also accommodated at the centre, with around 140 players between under-10 and under-19 age groups using the facilities. International club teams playing in Scotland, as well as national sides, have previously used the centre for training, and Advocaat's South Korea team used it for training prior to the 2006 World Cup.[194][195]\n\nSupporters and rivalries\n\nMain article: Rangers F.C. supporters\n\nRangers are one of the best supported clubs in Europe, the figure for the 2017–18 season being in the 20 largest home league attendances in Europe.[196] A study of stadium attendance figures from 2013 to 2018 by the CIES Football Observatory ranked Rangers at 18th in the world during that period, with Rangers' accounting for 27.4% of total Scottish attendance, placing them 8th overall for national attendance share.[197]\n\nThe Rangers Worldwide Alliance is a network of supporters clubs that was set up for the benefit of the club and the fans. There are more than 600 registered supporters clubs with over 30,000 registered members and these continue to grow, in keeping with the vision the club initially had. There are also many unregistered supporters clubs currently active. The official club website lists over 100 supporters' clubs in Great Britain and Northern Ireland,[198] with over 100 further clubs spread across over 35 countries around the world.[199] It includes representatives from all over the globe – including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia – as well as closer to home in the United Kingdom. Beyond Europe, there are supporters clubs registered in far-flung locations such as Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Qatar, Bahrain, China, India, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, United States of America, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica. One of Hong Kong's most popular football clubs Hong Kong Rangers FC was set up by an expatriate fan.\n\nRangers fans have contributed to several records for high attendances,[200] including the highest home attendance for a league fixture, 118,567 on 2 January 1939.[27] Rangers record highest attendance was against Hibernian on 27 March 1948 in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park. Rangers beat Hibernian 1–0 in front of a packed 143,570 crowd.\n\nIn 2008, up to 200,000 Rangers supporters, many without match tickets, travelled to Manchester for the UEFA Cup Final.[201][202] Despite most supporters behaving \"impeccably\",[203] Rangers fans were involved in serious trouble and rioting. A minority of fans rioted in the city centre, clashing violently with police and damaging property, resulting in 42 being arrested for a variety of offences.[204][205][206]\n\nIn 2022, Rangers also took the largest ever travelling support abroad when an estimated 100,000 fans arrived in Seville for the UEFA Europa League Final.[10] No arrests were made in Seville as Rangers supporters impressed the Spanish police with their good behaviour.[207]\n\nSupporters group Club 1872 are the ninth-largest shareholder of the club.\n\nRivalries\n\nThe club's most distinct rivalry is with Glasgow neighbours Celtic F.C.; the two clubs are collectively known as the Old Firm. Rangers' traditional support is largely drawn from the Protestant Unionist community, whilst Celtic's traditional support is largely drawn from the Catholic community. The first Old Firm match was won by Celtic and there have been over four hundred matches played to date. The Old Firm rivalry has fuelled many assaults, sometimes leading to deaths, on Old Firm derby days; an activist group that monitors sectarian activity in Glasgow has reported that on Old Firm weekends, admissions to hospital emergency rooms have increased over normal levels and journalist Franklin Foer noted that in the period from 1996 to 2003, eight deaths in Glasgow were directly linked to Old Firm matches, as well as hundreds of assaults.[208][209]\n\nThe bitter rivalry with Aberdeen developed following an incident in the 1979 League Cup final when Rangers' Derek Johnstone provoked the fury of the Dons support with what they believed was a blatant dive but which resulted in the dismissal of Aberdeen's Doug Rougvie and a Rangers victory.[210] Then, the following season, Aberdeen's John McMaster had to be given the kiss of life at Ibrox after a stamp on his throat by Willie Johnston.[210] Relations between fans were further soured during a league match on 8 October 1988, when Aberdeen player Neil Simpson's tackle on Rangers' Ian Durrant resulted in Durrant being injured for two years.[211] Resentment continued and in 1998 an article in a Rangers match programme branded Aberdeen fans \"scum\", although Rangers later issued a \"full and unreserved apology\" to Aberdeen and their supporters, which was accepted by Aberdeen.[212][213]\n\nRangers' relaunch in the Third Division in the 2012–13 season led to the club's original rivalry with Queen's Park being renewed for the first time since 1958 in the league. Rangers and Queen's Park first played each other in March 1879, some nine years before the start of the Old Firm rivalry.[214][215] Matches with Queen's Park were advertised as the \"Original Glasgow derby\" by Rangers and the Scottish media; and as the \"Oldest Derby in the World\" by Queen's Park.[216]\n\nSectarianism\n\nMain article: Sectarianism in Glasgow\n\nJohn Ure Primrose, chairman of Rangers from 1912 to 1923, has been described as sharpening Rangers' Protestant Unionist identity and anti-Catholic identity, contributing to the absence of openly Catholic players from the team.[217] From the early 20th century onwards, Rangers had a policy of not signing Catholic players, or employing Catholics in other prominent roles.[218][219][220][221]\n\nIn 1989, Rangers signed Mo Johnston, \"their first major Roman Catholic signing\".[222] Johnston was the first high-profile Catholic to sign for the club since the World War I era, though other Catholics had signed for Rangers before.[218][223] Since Johnston's signing, an influx of overseas footballers has contributed to Catholic players becoming commonplace at Rangers.[224] In 1999, Lorenzo Amoruso became the first Catholic captain of the club.[225]\n\nRangers partnered with Celtic to form the Old Firm Alliance, an initiative aimed at educating children from across Glasgow about issues like healthy eating and fitness, as well as awareness of anti-social behaviour, sectarianism and racism. The club's Follow With Pride campaign was launched in 2007 to improve the club's image and build on previous anti-sectarian and anti-racist campaigns.[226][n 2] William Gaillard, UEFA's Director of Communications, commended the SFA and Scottish clubs, including Rangers, for their actions in fighting discrimination.[228] In September 2007, UEFA praised Rangers for the measures the club has taken against sectarianism.[229][230]\n\nHowever, sectarian chanting by supporters has continued to incur criticism and sanctions upon the club as well as convictions against individuals identified.[231][232] In 1999, the vice-chairman of The Rangers Football Club Ltd, Donald Findlay, resigned after being filmed singing sectarian songs during a supporters club event.[233][234][235] UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body has punished Rangers for incidents during European ties, most notably Villarreal in 2006,[236] Osasuna in 2007,[237] PSV Eindhoven in 2011,[238][239] and at Ibrox in 2019.[240] In February 2015, following sectarian singing from Rangers fans at a match at Raith Rovers, the SPFL came in for criticism for their failure or inability to deal with the issue.[241] However, there have been cases of the police and courts taking action, with Rangers fans having been charged, convicted and jailed for sectarian behaviour.[242]\n\nRangers' use of orange and blue change strips, first worn in 1993–94,[157] once in 2002–03[158] and reintroduced in 2018–19[158] and 2022–23,[159] has caused controversy because the colours are seen as referencing the Orange Order.[158]\n\nFriendships\n\nSupporters of Rangers have a fan friendship with the Northern Irish club Linfield F.C., dating back to 1920. Two of the founders of the club Moses and Peter McNeil have a Northern Irish connection through the County Down birth of their mother Jean Bain, who after moving to Scotland for work in the mid-19th century married a Scotsman, John McNeil. From Rangers formation to the present day, the club have had 32 players who were born in either Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and previously Ireland (from 1882 to 1950). A number were former Linfield players, and they have contributed much to the success of Rangers Football Club. Three former Northern Irish players have captained Rangers – Bert Manderson, John McClelland and Steven Davis; six from a Northern Irish connection have been elevated to the Rangers 'Hall of Fame' and one – Jimmy Nicholl – was the club's assistant manager in 2018.[243]\n\nThe fans of Rangers also have a fan-friendship with the German club Hamburger SV, dating from the 1970s when Scots moved to the German port in search of work and reinforced by their shared affection for the midfielder Jörg Albertz.[244] This link was formalised in February 2021 with the formation of an official club partnership between the two sides.[245] Conversely, Celtic fans have a long-standing friendship with Hamburger SV's city rivals, FC St. Pauli. The friendship exists due to both the Rangers-HSV affinity and the shared left-wing politics of Celtic and St. Pauli fans.[246][247][248]\n\nOwnership and finances\n\nFrom incorporation to liquidation\n\nOn 27 May 1899, Rangers Football Club incorporated, forming The Rangers Football Club Ltd.[92] No single shareholding exceeded 50% until 1985 when the Lawrence Group increased its shareholding in Rangers to a 52% majority, following a deal with then club vice-chairman Jack Gillespie. In November 1988, head of the Lawrence Group Lawrence Marlborough sold out to David Murray for £6 million. In 2000, David Murray decided to list the company on the stock exchange (making it a public limited company), with the name of the company being changed to The Rangers Football Club plc.[249]\n\nOn 6 May 2011, Craig Whyte bought David Murray's shares for £1.[250] On 13 February 2012, Whyte filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of his intention to appoint administrators.[251] The next day, The Rangers Football Club plc – which was subsequently renamed RFC 2012 plc – entered administration over non-payment of £9 million in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs.[252][253] In April the administrators estimated that the club's total debts could top £134m which was largely dependent on the outcome of a First Tier Tax Tribunal concerning a disputed tax bill in relation to an Employee Benefit Trust (\"EBT\") scheme employed by the club since 2001.[254] However, on 20 November 2012, the Tribunal ruled in favour of Rangers. Had that decision been upheld the tax bill could have been significantly reduced from an estimated £74m to under £2m.[255][256] An Upper Tribunal upheld the decision in 2014.[257] HMRC then appealed to the Court of Session, which ruled in November 2015 that Rangers should have paid tax and national insurance on the EBT payments.[258]\n\nOn 25 June 2012, the Crown Office asked Strathclyde Police to investigate the purchase of Rangers and the club's subsequent financial management during Whyte's tenure.[259]\n\nCharles Green agreed a deal with the administrators of The Rangers Football Club plc to purchase the company for £8.5 million if a proposed CVA was agreed or to purchase its business and assets for a £5.5million if the proposed CVA were to be rejected. On 14 June 2012, the formal rejection of the proposed CVA[260] meant that the company would enter the liquidation process.[261][262][263] The accountancy firm BDO was appointed to investigate the years of financial mismanagement at the club.[264][265]\n\nCurrent corporate identity\n\nOn 14 June 2012, hours after the CVA's rejection, Sevco Scotland Ltd, a new company formed by Charles Green's consortium for this eventuality,[266] completed the purchase of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club Plc[267][268] and then, on 18 June 2012, formally applied to acquire the SPL share of The Rangers Football Club plc. On 4 July, SPL clubs voted by 10–1 to reject the application with Kilmarnock abstaining and the old Rangers company voting in favour.[96] Thereafter, an application to the Scottish Football League was successful with Rangers securing associate membership on 13 July 2012 at an SFL meeting by a vote of 29–1. The SFL member clubs voted that Rangers should enter the fourth tier of Scottish Football, Scottish Third Division for the 2012–13 season, rather than the Scottish First Division.[269][270]\n\nAn application was made for a transfer of SFA membership on 29 June 2012, with the new company applying for the transfer of the membership of The Rangers Football Club plc.[272] Agreement was reached on the transfer with the new company accepting a number of conditions relating to the old company.[98]\n\nAt the end of 2012, Rangers International Football Club plc became the holding company for the group, having acquired The Rangers Football Club Ltd on the basis of a one for one share exchange.[273] In 2013, after its first 13 months, the company reported operating losses of £14.4m.[274] Thereafter it continued to post annual operating losses, variously £9.8m in 2014 and £9.9m in 2015,[275] £2.5m in 2016,[276] £6.3m in 2017[277] and £13.2m in 2018,[278] until returning to profit in 2022.[279]\n\nMajor shareholders\n\nAs of July 2024[280]\n\nStakeholder No of Ordinary Shares held % of issued share capital New Oasis Asset Limited[281] 63,172,893 14.12% Douglas Park 52,550,000 11.74% George Alexander Taylor 44,074,998 9.85% Stuart Gibson 44,000,000 9.84% Borita Investments Limited 27,611,955 6.17% John Bennett 24,647,059 5.51% Perron Investments LLC 24,250,000 5.42% George Letham 22,274,516 4.98% Club 1872 Shares CIC 22,202,838 4.96% Tifosy Investment Nominees Limited 17,610,000 3.94%\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nSupport for charities\n\nMain article: Rangers Charity Foundation\n\nThe Rangers Charity Foundation was created in 2002 and participates in a wide range of charitable work, regularly involving Rangers staff and star players. The foundation also has partnerships with UNICEF, The Prostate Cancer Charity and Erskine, and is responsible for over £2.3 million in donations. As well as fundraising, the Rangers Charity Foundation regularly bring sick, disabled and disadvantaged children to attend matches and tours at Ibrox, with the chance to meet the players.[282][283]\n\nThrough its support of the Rangers Charity Foundation, the club has helped a number of charities with support and financial donations. In 2008, the club became the first Scottish side to be selected as a partner club of UNICEF.[284] The club's Charity Foundation has backed initiatives in Togo and India[284] as well as funding one million vaccinations for a children's vaccination programme.[285] The club has been a firm supporter of Erskine, a charity which provides long-term medical care for veterans of the British Armed Forces, and in 2012, donated £25,000 to fund projects within their care homes.[286] In January 2015, Rangers hosted a charity match for the benefit of former player Fernando Ricksen who had been diagnosed with Motor neurone disease; this raised £320,000 for him and MND Scotland.[287]\n\nWork in the community\n\nAlongside its work with numerous charities, the club and its Charity Foundation operate various initiatives within the community including courses to help Armed Forces veterans overcome addictions,[288] to raise awareness of social issues and help unemployed people back into work. In October 2015, the club launched its Ready2Succeed programme which was a ten-week course designed to develop participants confidence and employability skills by engaging with football and fitness.[289] Rangers first-team players also visit the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow every year during the festive period where they hand out presents to the children and donate money to the hospital activity fund.[290]\n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 2002, former Rangers striker Ally McCoist starred in Robert Duvall's film A Shot at Glory as Jackie McQuillan where he would play against Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final for \"Kilnockie F.C.\", a fictional side.\n\nIn 2003, a Scottish television documentary series filmed by BBC Scotland, Blue Heaven, followed aspiring young footballers at Rangers as they tried to forge a career in football.[291] The series was originally broadcast in the winter of 2003 with a follow-up episode in 2011.[292]\n\nIn 2008, celebrity chef and former Rangers youth player Gordon Ramsay returned to the club to teach them how to cook in Series 4, Episode 12 of The F Word.[293]\n\nOwing to the notoriety of the \"Rangers Inter City Firm\", a football firm associated with the club, Rangers have also featured in television documentaries and books about football hooliganism, including Series 1, Episode 5 of The Real Football Factories presented by English actor Danny Dyer on Bravo in 2006, during which he visits his first Old Firm match and meets football casuals from Rangers, Celtic, Aberdeen, Hibernian, Dundee United and Dundee.[294]\n\nThe club featured on BBC Scotland comedy Scotch and Wry in 1979 in a scene where Manager (Rikki Fulton) and Chief Scout (Gregor Fisher) unknowingly sign a young Catholic footballer (Gerard Kelly) but then try to void his contract to avoid publicly breaking the club's \"No Catholic\" signing policy after finding out.[295][296]\n\nRangers have appeared in theatre a number of times in shows such as Follow Follow: The Rangers Story at the King's Theatre in 1994 starring Scottish actors Barbara Rafferty, Alexander Morton, Jonathan Watson, Iain Robertson, Ronnie Letham and Stuart Bowman; Singin' I'm No A Billy He's A Tim at the Pavilion Theatre in 2009;[297][298] Divided City at the Citizens Theatre in 2011; and, more recently, Billy and Tim and the Wee Glesga Ghost in 2015, and Rally Roon the Rangers in 2019 and 2022, both at the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.[299]\n\nWilliam Orcutt Cushing's hymn \"Follow On\", also known as \"Down in the Valley with My Saviour I Would Go\" or \"I Will Follow Jesus\", has been adopted as the anthem of Rangers in their club song \"Follow Follow\". The club has also played the Tina Turner song \"The Best\" when the teams exit the tunnel before kick off.[300]\n\nIn October 2023, K-pop girl group STAYC went viral when during a concert in Dallas, Texas, USA, they wore cropped 1996–97 season Rangers shirts instead of uniforms from the local Major League Baseball team, the Texas Rangers.[301][302] A club spokesman said that the moment had \"triggered nostalgia for the Light Blues\". When the group traveled to the UK the following month for the Korea On Stage show at Wembley, the club welcomed them to Ibrox Stadium and their adjoining event facility, Edmiston House.[303][304][305]\n\nRecords\n\nClub\n\nPlayer\n\nPlayers\n\nFirst-team squad\n\nAs of 25 August 2024[320]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
