To all others present, it was lost in quite distinct seas of joy and despair. It was probably fitting the Boroughmuir flanker got the winning score. He had been outstanding throughout, a deserved recipient of the Man of the Match accolade. It was a match, though, neither side deserved to lose but both deserved to win. West of Scotland had matched the heavy favourites. Full report here."
