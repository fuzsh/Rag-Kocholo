The only criteria considered prior to selection is to be over 35 years of age but still hold the belief that you've still got it. Specialising in the entertainment of touring sides and touring themselves, the fixture card is more sporadic than congested. Port, cigars and other necessary tinctures play a big part in any Bulls fixture.\n\nSocial touch rugby sessions are held on the 4G pitch at Burnbrae on a Thursday night from 8.30pm. All are welcome."
