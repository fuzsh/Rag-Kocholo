        "text": "This article is about the city in Scotland. For other uses, see Glasgow (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Port Glasgow.\n\nGlasgow ( GLA(H)Z-goh, GLA(H)SS-)[lower-alpha 1] is the most populous city in Scotland, located on the banks of the River Clyde in west central Scotland.[9] The city is the third-most populous city in the United Kingdom[10] and the 27th-most populous city in Europe.[11] In 2022, it had an estimated population as a defined locality of 632,350 and anchored an urban settlement of 1,028,220. The economy of Glasgow is the largest of any city or region in Scotland's economy,[12][13] and the city's economic strength is reflected in its membership of the Core Cities Group.\n\nQuick Facts Glaschu (Scottish Gaelic) Glesga (Scots), Sovereign state ...\n\nClose\n\nGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement close to Glasgow Cathedral and descending to the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and episcopal burgh (subsequently royal burgh), and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of oceanic trade with North America and the West Indies; soon followed by the Orient, India, and China. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.[14][15][16][17]\n\nGlasgow became a county in 1893, the city having previously been in the historic county of Lanarkshire, and later growing to also include settlements that were once part of Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire. It now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is administered by Glasgow City Council. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 (with a higher density and within a smaller territory than in subsequent decades).[18] The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. Over 1,000,000 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[5] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2."
