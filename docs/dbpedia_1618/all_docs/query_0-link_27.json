The fact that the numbers have grown every year is testament to the fun they have on a Sunday morning.\n\nThe 'coaching' is focused on fun games that introduce the kids to basic ball handling and movement in an enjoyable and active environment. Open to boys and girls from pre-school age (we suggest 3 years and upwards)."
