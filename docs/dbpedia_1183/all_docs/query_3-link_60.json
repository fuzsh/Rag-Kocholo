        "text": "Description\n\nThis course is an introduction to ordinary differential equations. The course introduces the basic techniques for solving and/or analyzing first and second order differential equations, both linear and nonlinear, and systems of differential equations. Emphasis is placed on qualitative and numerical methods, as well as on formula solutions. The use of mathematical software system is an integral and substantial part of the course. Beginning Spring 2003, all sections of the course will use the software system MATLAB. Credit will be granted for only one of the following: MATH 246 or MATH 341.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nRequired: a C- or better in MATH 141. Recommended: MATH240 or ENES102 or PHYS161 or PHYS171.\n\nTopics\n\nIntroduction to and Classification of Differential Equations\n\nFirst Order Equations\n\nLinear, separable and exact equations\n\nIntroduction to symbolic solutions using a MSS\n\nExistence and uniqueness of solutions\n\nProperties of nonlinear vs. linear equations\n\nQualitative methods for autonomous equations\n\nPlotting direction fields using a MSS\n\nModels and applications\n\nNumerical Methods\n\nIntroduction to a numerical solver in a MSS\n\nElementary numerical methods: Euler, Improved Euler, Runge-Kutta\n\nLocal and global error, reliability of numerical methods\n\nSecond Order Equations\n\nTheory of linear equations\n\nHomogeneous linear equations with constant coefficients\n\nReduction of order\n\nMethods of undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters for non-homogeneous equations\n\nSymbolic and numerical solutions using a MSS\n\nMechanical and electrical vibrations\n\nLaplace Transforms\n\nDefinition and calculation of transforms\n\nApplications to differential equations with discontinuous forcing functions\n\nSystems of First Order Linear Equations\n\nGeneral theory\n\nEigenvalue-eigenvector method for systems with constant coefficients\n\nFinding eigenpairs and solving linear systems with a MSS\n\nThe phase plane and parametric plotting with a MSS\n\nNonlinear Systems and Stability"
