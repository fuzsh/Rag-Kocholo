        "text": "\"Destruction of the Straw Hat Pirates? The Terror of the Model Leopard!\" is the 246th episode of the One Piece anime.\n\nShort Summary[]\n\nLucci's transformation is a result of a Devil Fruit, a Zoan type: the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard. He quickly disposes of the crew, and CP9 tie up Paulie and Iceburg, leaving them alone as the building slowly burns down around them. In Franky's underground hideout, Usopp tells him his story and Franky is finally touched. In return, Franky tells him a little about Tom's contributions to Water 7.\n\nLong Summary[]\n\nLucci reveals himself to be a user of the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a Zoan-type Devil fruit that turns him into a leopard. Meanwhile, the first floor of Iceburg Mansion is set on fire, so the members of Galley-La run upstairs to check on Iceburg. Lucci keeps them at bay using the Rankyaku move, essentially cutting the entire mansion in half.\n\nLucci defeats both Luffy and Zoro, sending them both flying into the sea. Nami is also knocked out and thrown out the window. Paulie and Iceburg are left tied up near the fire. The members of CP9 then leave to get the blueprints from Franky.\n\nLucci confronts members of the Franky Family, who refuses to give answers as to where Franky was staying. Meanwhile, in Franky's warehouse, Franky is talking to Usopp, who is attempting to repair the ship. Franky explains that he took the ship to protect it from the Aqua Laguna, and that Water 7 was sinking.\n\nBack on the streets, Lucci finishes off the Franky Family members. Now having Franky's location, CP9 heads for Franky's warehouse under the bridge.\n\nCharacters in Order of Appearance[]\n\nAnime Notes[]\n\nThis is the first episode to use Dear Friends as the ending.\n\nSanji's and Usopp's second eyecatchers debut in this episode.\n\nFranky makes up the song \"Severed Friendship, North Wind Chop\" after being touched by Usopp's story about cutting his ties with the Straw Hats.\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\n← Previous Episode\n\nNext Episode →"
