        "text": "Just had two weeks off the bike on sunny Isla Mujeres, Mexico, so was excited to ride tonight. This is my latest playlist, a melange of some of the songs I’m enjoying at the moment. All have appeared on the blog before.\n\nWithout You (feat. Usher) – David Guetta and Usher (3:28): Warmup.\n\nBrand New Chick – Anjulie (3:32): 8 count jumps for the verses and 4 count for the choruses; medium tension (5/10).\n\nWe Found Love (feat. Calvin Harris) – Rihanna (3:36): Rolling hills, out of the saddle. Start with tension at about 50% of your max (5/10) and do two or three small increases every 15-30 seconds, then ramp it down the same way. There should be time for two small hills.\n\nNiton (The Reason) (Radio Edit) – Eric Prydz (2:45): Five minutes (two songs) of tempo ride, no break between them.\n\nFind Yourself (Radio Edit) – John O’ Callaghan (2:32): Second half of the tempo drill.\n\nU and Ur Hand – P!nk (3:34): Let’s veer into rock and do some sprints: 30/30/60 seconds, at the choruses.\n\nWhat a Night (DJ Kontrol Journey Mash) (feat. Claude Kelly) – Kontrol & L’il Jon (3:34): One of my favourite mashups from Dirty Mexican Lemonade. Let’s do some jumps: 8/4/2 counts, one minute each.\n\nSummer Rain (Alex K Klubbed Up Mix) – Slinkee Minx (6:08): A combo climb: seated, aggressive, regular, standing jog (30 seconds of each). You’ll have time for three sets.\n\nBarbra Streisand (Original Mix) – Duck Sauce (4:57): Recover for the first minute, then move into some high tension (7/10) jumps: 8 counts (90 seconds), 4 counts (90 seconds), 2 counts (to the end of the song)\n\nCobrastyle (feat. Mad Cobra) – Teddybears (3:00): A seated climb, adding tension at 0:35, 1:15, and 2:00.\n\nAre You Gonna Be My Girl? – Jet (3:37): Grueling seated sprints, 30 seconds on, 15 off. Did I mention it’s the beginning of a three-song sprint fiesta?\n\nProfessional Killer – KMFDM (4:34): More sprints: 15/15/30/30. They’re at 1:04 – 1:20, 1:52 – 2:08, 2:40 – 3:12, 4:00 – 4:30.\n\nThis is How a Heart Breaks – Rob Thomas (3:51): We’re almost done. Three more sprint intervals 15/20/1:15 at 0:44 – 1:00, 1:32 – 1:52, and 2:20 – 3:35. One of my favourite go-to sprinting songs, this one never fails to get me going.\n\nHard Sun – Eddy Vedder (5:22): Cool down. I could listen to this song every day and never tire of it.\n\nIf I Were a Boy – Beyonce (4:09): Additional cool down and goodbye music. Another favourite."
