Its first participation was at the second contest, in 1957, and it has entered every year since 1959. The British participant broadcaster in the contest is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The country has won the contest five times: in 1967, with \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw; in 1969 (a four-way tie), with \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" by Lulu ; in 1976, with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by Brotherhood of Man; in 1981, with \"Making Your Mind Up\" by Bucks Fizz; and in 1997, with \"Love Shine a Light\" by Katrina and the Waves. The UK has also achieved a record sixteen second-place finishes, the first in 1959 and the most recent in 2022.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of the \"Big Five\" countries, alongside France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, which have an automatic place in the final of the contest each year, due to their participant broadcasters being the largest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The BBC has allowed the public to choose the British entry in the contest through a national selection process on many occasions. The BBC has hosted the contest a record nine times. London was the host city in 1960, 1963, 1968, and 1977, Edinburgh in 1972, Brighton in 1974, Harrogate in 1982, Birmingham in 1998, and Liverpool in 2023.\n\nThe United Kingdom had a strong record in the contest before 2000, finishing within the top ten every year except 1978, 1987, and 1999. The country's record has been considerably poorer since 2000, as it has only reached the top ten three times and finished in last place in 2003, 2008, 2010, 2019, and 2021. Its top ten positions in this period are third in 2002 with \"Come Back\" by Jessica Garlick, fifth in 2009 with \"It's My Time\" by Jade Ewen, and second in 2022 with \"Space Man\" by Sam Ryder.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a full member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. It has participated in the contest representing the United Kingdom since its second edition in 1957.\n\n1950s to 1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was alleged that the United Kingdom was expected to take part in the first contest in 1956, and that it missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part. This was later revealed by the EBU in January 2017 to be a myth created by fans of the contest.[1] The EBU further went on to explain that the Festival of British Popular Songs, a contest created by the BBC for the United Kingdom, was the inspiration that brought in format changes to the contest elements from 1957 onwards.[1] However, it's also believed that the United Kingdom had selected Shirley Abicair to perform \"Little Ship\" at the contest, but withdrew due to her nationality being Australian.[2] Patricia Bredin was the first performer to represent the UK at Eurovision, finishing seventh in 1957. The UK was the first choice to stage the third contest in 1958, however following a failure to reach an agreement from various artistic unions, the BBC withdrew its bid in the summer of 1957 and the UK did not enter for the second and last time to date.[3]\n\nAt their second attempt in the contest in 1959, the UK achieved the first of its record sixteen runner-up positions, when Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson sang \"Sing Little Birdie\". The UK would go on to achieve four more second-place finishes with Bryan Johnson in 1960, The Allisons in 1961, Matt Monro in 1964 and Kathy Kirby in 1965, before eventually winning for the first time in 1967. Sandie Shaw was already a successful performer, having twice topped the UK Singles Chart, and she comfortably won in Vienna with \"Puppet on a String\", which became her third UK number one and topped the charts all around Europe. In 1968, another successful performer was selected to represent the UK with the song \"Congratulations\". In London, Cliff Richard gave the UK its sixth second-place finish, losing to Spain's Massiel. \"Congratulations\" remains one of only two non-winning UK Eurovision entries to top the UK charts. The UK's second victory was provided by the Scottish singer Lulu, who won with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" in 1969, in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands. Another established performer, she had previously topped the US Billboard Hot 100 with \"To Sir with Love\" in 1967.\n\nHaving finished second on three further occasions in the 1970s – with Mary Hopkin in 1970, The New Seekers in 1972 and The Shadows in 1975 – the UK achieved its third win in 1976 with Brotherhood of Man and \"Save Your Kisses for Me\", who won with 164 points, which would remain the highest points total for ten years. In 1977, the UK finished second for the tenth time, represented by singer-songwriters Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran.\n\n1980s and 1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK's fourth victory came in 1981, with Bucks Fizz and \"Making Your Mind Up\". The group was created especially for the UK televised selection contest, A Song for Europe (a programme which in later years would be renamed to Making Your Mind Up). At Eurovision in Dublin, they defeated Germany's Lena Valaitis by four points. The group went on to continued success, with 13 UK top 40 hits over the next five years. This would be the last UK win for 16 years, although the country continued to be competitive at the contest with four more second-place results during this time. In 1988, Scott Fitzgerald lost to Celine Dion, who was representing Switzerland, by just one point. In 1989, Live Report lost out to Yugoslavia by seven points. Michael Ball in 1992, also finished second, behind Linda Martin of Ireland. The 1993 entry, Sonia, had already had ten UK top 30 hits, including a 1989 number one with \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\", when she was selected to represent the UK in Millstreet. She finished second to Ireland's Niamh Kavanagh, who won by 23 points. Despite only finishing eighth in the 1996 contest, Gina G went on to huge success with her entry \"Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit\", which became only the second non-winning UK entry to top the UK Singles Chart. It also reached the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100 and received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. The UK's fifth victory came in 1997, when Katrina and the Waves, famous for their 1980s hit \"Walking on Sunshine\", comfortably won the contest with the song \"Love Shine a Light\". They scored 227 points, which would remain the highest points total of the pre-semi-final era. At the 1998 contest in Birmingham, Imaani achieved the UK's 15th second-place finish and 20th top two result, with the song \"Where Are You?\", losing to Israel's Dana International. The UK would not finish in the top two again for 24 years.\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK has fared less well in the contest in the 21st century.[4] After girl-group Precious finished 12th in 1999, the UK regularly placed in the bottom half of the scoreboard, with a few exceptions. In the 2000s, those exceptions were Jessica Garlick in 2002, who finished joint third with the song \"Come Back\", and Jade Ewen in 2009, who was praised for ending the country's poor run of results for much of the decade, by finishing fifth with the song \"It's My Time\". In 2003, the UK finished last in the final for the first time with the duo Jemini, who received the infamous nul points. The country then finished last on two further occasions over the next seven years, with Andy Abraham, who received 14 points in 2008, and Josh Dubovie, who received 10 points in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the BBC announced that it would forgo the national selection and instead internally select the next representative, eventually selecting the boy band Blue to represent the UK. They finished 11th with 100 points. In 2012, the UK were facing calls to quit the contest when the UK entry, Engelbert Humperdinck, finished 25th (out of 26) with only 12 points.[5] However, the UK confirmed its participation in the 2013 contest, with the Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler, best known for her 1983 US and UK number one hit \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", representing the country with her song \"Believe in Me\".[6] In Malmö, she finished 19th with 23 points.[7]\n\nIn 2014, the BBC internally selected unknown singer Molly Smitten-Downes, through BBC Introducing, which supports new and unsigned acts. She represented the UK in Copenhagen under her mononym Molly. In the final, she performed the song \"Children of the Universe\", which she co-wrote with Anders Hansson and finished in 17th place with 40 points, having been regarded as one of the favourites to win the contest.[8] In October 2014, Guy Freeman stated that the BBC were still engaging with record companies and the BBC Introducing platform in order to find an entry for the 2015 contest via the internal selection process, but announced that in addition, for the first time since 2008, it would be giving the general public the option to submit an entry for consideration.[9][10] Ultimately, the entry for 2015 came through open submission, with the song \"Still in Love with You\" performed by the duo Electro Velvet finishing in 24th place with five points.[11]\n\nOn 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the national selection show would return in 2016.[12] Six acts competed in the national final on 26 February and the winner was selected entirely through a public vote, consisting of televoting and online voting. \"You're Not Alone\" performed by Joe and Jake won the national final broadcast live on BBC Four.[13] In the final, they came 24th with 62 points in total.[14] Of these only 8 were from the public vote, the second lowest public score, following 0 to the Czech Republic. In spite of the disappointing result, the BBC announced the national final format would be retained for 2017.[15] Six acts again participated in the final, which was held on 27 January 2017. It was broadcast on BBC Two as opposed to BBC Four the previous year, and the winner was determined by a combination of scores from a professional jury and televoting (including votes cast online). Former X Factor contestant Lucie Jones won the show and earned the right to represent the UK at the 2017 contest in Kyiv, with the song \"Never Give Up on You\", becoming the 60th UK Eurovision entry.[16][17] The song was praised for its impressive staging, and finished 15th in the final with a combined score of 111 points, finishing 10th in the jury vote with 99 points and 20th in the televote with 12 points.[18] In 2018, \"Storm\" by SuRie was selected by the public to represent the UK.[19] Her performance during the final was marred by an invader who ran onstage halfway through the song and grabbed her microphone, interrupting her performance; however, she was able to complete her performance. She finished in 24th with a combined score of 48.[20] Michael Rice's song \"Bigger than Us\" was selected by the public to represent the UK in 2019.[21] It finished in 26th place in the final after amassing 11 points, marking the fourth time since the turn of the century that the UK had finished last.[22]\n\nAhead of the 2020 contest, the BBC stated that it would return to internally selecting its representative, in collaboration with record label BMG. James Newman was chosen as the entrant with his song \"My Last Breath\";[23] however, the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBC subsequently announced that BBC Studios would produce Eurovision: Come Together, a replacement show for BBC One featuring classic Eurovision performances, interviews and a look at the entries that would have taken part in 2020. The show was part of the BBC's plan to \"entertain the nation in time of need\".[24] The contest returned in 2021, with Newman being selected again with a new song, \"Embers\". However, the song finished in last place and became the second UK entry to receive nul points (also the first full nul points since the 2016 voting system was first implemented).[25]\n\nFor the 2022 contest, the BBC retained the internal selection format, this time working in partnership with TaP Music. Sam Ryder and his song \"Space Man\" were selected for the contest and went on to place second with 466 points, the best result achieved by the UK since 1998, earning the most points in the jury vote, and the most points ever received for a UK entry.[26] Ryder also won the Marcel Bezençon Award in the Press category, becoming the first ever UK act to receive the award since its inception in 2002.[27] He was praised by the media for his positive attitude and desire to change the UK public and press' perception of the contest.[4]\n\nThe BBC continued its partnership with TaP Music for the 2023 contest, after the success of 2022.[28] However, they were unable to replicate the previous year's success, with Mae Muller and her entry \"I Wrote a Song\" finishing in 25th place on home soil in Liverpool, with 24 points in total.[29] Later that year, TaP Music announced that it would end its partnership with the BBC.[30] Former Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander and his song \"Dizzy\" represented the UK in 2024 and finished 18th, receiving 46 points, all from the juries.[31]\n\nThe UK's participation in the 2025 contest was confirmed on 25 July 2024.[32]\n\nUnited Kingdom and the \"Big Five\"\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, a rule change allowed the United Kingdom, along with France, Germany, and Spain, to automatically qualify for the final (irrespective of their recent scores and without entering a semi-final), due to their participant broadcasters being the largest financial contributors to the EBU.[33] Due to their untouchable status in the contest, these countries became known as the \"Big Four\" (which became the \"Big Five\" in 2011 following the return of Italy to the contest).[34]\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that the \"Big Four\" could lose their status and be forced to compete in the semi-finals;[35] however, this never materialised, and the rule remained in place.[36] In the same year, the BBC defended using money from TV licence fee payers for the contest when Liberal Democrat MP Richard Younger-Ross had tabled a Commons motion which called on the corporation to withdraw its £173,000 funding for the annual contest. Former Eurovision commentator Sir Terry Wogan, that same year, also claimed that the show is \"no longer a music contest\" after the final of that year's edition ended.[37]\n\nSince the introduction of the Big Four/Five, the United Kingdom has finished last in the contest five times, with Germany finishing last four times. The United Kingdom also has the fewest top ten results of the Big Five in the 21st century, but has achieved more top five results than Spain, having reached the top five in 2002, 2009 and 2022.\n\nSelection process\n\n[edit]\n\nAs well as broadcasting the contest each year, the BBC also organises the selection process for the entry, often with a televised national final (historically titled A Song for Europe). The process has varied between selecting both performer and song, or just the song, with the artist being selected internally.\n\nFor most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected. From 2011 to 2015, there was no televised selection, and both the artist and song were selected internally by the BBC. This resulted in the national selection process being suspended; however, this returned in 2016, re-titled Eurovision: You Decide, with viewers once again choosing which song to enter into the contest. Since 2017, the votes from a professional jury panel have been combined with the public vote to select the winner. The televised selection process was suspended again in September 2019, with the BBC returning to internally selecting its entry (in partnership with BMG in 2020 and 2021, and with TaP Music in 2022 and 2023).[38][39][40][41]\n\nParticipation overview\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow is a list of all songs and their respective performers that have represented the United Kingdom in the contest:[42]\n\nTable key 1 First place 2 Second place 3 Third place ◁ Last place X Entry selected but did not compete † Upcoming event\n\nYear Artist Song Language Final Points Semi Points 1957 Patricia Bredin \"All\" English 7 6 No semi-finals 1959 Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson \"Sing Little Birdie\" English 2 16 1960 Bryan Johnson \"Looking High, High, High\" English 2 25 1961 The Allisons \"Are You Sure?\" English 2 24 1962 Ronnie Carroll \"Ring-A-Ding Girl\" English 4 10 1963 Ronnie Carroll \"Say Wonderful Things\" English 4 28 1964 Matt Monro \"I Love the Little Things\" English 2 17 1965 Kathy Kirby \"I Belong\" English 2 26 1966 Kenneth McKellar \"A Man Without Love\" English 9 8 1967 Sandie Shaw \"Puppet on a String\" English 1 47 1968 Cliff Richard \"Congratulations\" English 2 28 1969 Lulu \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" English 1 18 1970 Mary Hopkin \"Knock, Knock (Who's There?)\" English 2 26 1971 Clodagh Rodgers \"Jack in the Box\" English 4 98 1972 The New Seekers \"Beg, Steal or Borrow\" English 2 114 1973 Cliff Richard \"Power to All Our Friends\" English 3 123 1974 Olivia Newton-John \"Long Live Love\" English 4 14 1975 The Shadows \"Let Me Be the One\" English 2 138 1976 Brotherhood of Man \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" English 1 164 1977 Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran \"Rock Bottom\" English 2 121 1978 Co-Co \"The Bad Old Days\" English 11 61 1979 Black Lace \"Mary Ann\" English 7 73 1980 Prima Donna \"Love Enough for Two\" English 3 106 1981 Bucks Fizz \"Making Your Mind Up\" English 1 136 1982 Bardo \"One Step Further\" English 7 76 1983 Sweet Dreams \"I'm Never Giving Up\" English 6 79 1984 Belle and the Devotions \"Love Games\" English 7 63 1985 Vikki \"Love Is\" English 4 100 1986 Ryder \"Runner in the Night\" English 7 72 1987 Rikki \"Only the Light\" English 13 47 1988 Scott Fitzgerald \"Go\" English 2 136 1989 Live Report \"Why Do I Always Get It Wrong\" English 2 130 1990 Emma \"Give a Little Love Back to the World\" English 6 87 1991 Samantha Janus \"A Message to Your Heart\" English 10 47 1992 Michael Ball \"One Step Out of Time\" English 2 139 1993 Sonia \"Better the Devil You Know\" English 2 164 Kvalifikacija za Millstreet 1994 Frances Ruffelle \"We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony)\" English 10 63 No semi-finals 1995 Love City Groove \"Love City Groove\" English 10 76 1996 Gina G \"Ooh Aah...

The show was broadcast just before the EBU's main replacement show Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light. An expert panel selected the 19 competing entries, four of which were UK entries.\n\nHostings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United Kingdom has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest a record nine times. The BBC stepped in and hosted the contest for the Netherlands in 1960, France in 1963, Monaco in 1972 and Luxembourg in 1974 due to the winning countries' financial and capacity issues, and for Ukraine in 2023 due to the Russian invasion of the country.[44] On four occasions (1968, 1977, 1982, and 1998) the UK was given the right to host as a result of a victory. The BBC offered to joint host the 1995 contest in Belfast, Northern Ireland with Irish broadcaster RTÉ, but ultimately RTÉ decided to stage the event solo.[45]\n\nYear Location Venue Executive producer Director Musical director Presenter(s) Ref. 1960 London Royal Festival Hall Harry Carlisle Innes Lloyd Eric Robinson Katie Boyle [46] 1963 BBC Television Centre Yvonne Littlewood [47] 1968 Royal Albert Hall Tom Sloan Stewart Morris Norrie Paramor [48] 1972 Edinburgh Usher Hall Bill Cotton Terry Hughes Malcolm Lockyer Moira Shearer [49] 1974 Brighton Brighton Dome Michael Hurll Ronnie Hazlehurst Katie Boyle [50] 1977 London Wembley Conference Centre Stewart Morris Angela Rippon [51] 1982 Harrogate Harrogate International Centre Michael Hurll Jan Leeming [52] 1998 Birmingham National Indoor Arena Kevin Bishop Geoff Posner Martin Koch Terry Wogan and Ulrika Jonsson [53] 2023 Liverpool Liverpool Arena Andrew Cartmell Nikki Parsons, Richard Valentine and Ollie Bartlett — Alesha Dixon, Hannah Waddingham, Julia Sanina (all shows) and Graham Norton (final) [54]\n\nEurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, London hosted Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits, an event to commemorate the 60th anniversary, which was recorded for television on 31 March 2015 and was shown in 26 countries, starting with the UK and Ireland on 3 April 2015.[55] The show was watched by 1.89 million viewers in the United Kingdom with a market share of 9.5%.[56]\n\nYear Location Venue Executive producer Director Presenters Ref. 2015 London Eventim Apollo Guy Freeman Geoff Posner Graham Norton and Petra Mede [57]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nAP Awards\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category Song Performer(s) Place Points Host city 2004 Composer Award \"Hold Onto Our Love\" James Fox 16 29 Istanbul\n\nMarcel Bezençon Awards\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Marcel Bezençon Awards\n\nYear Category Song Composer(s)\n\nlyrics (l) / music (m) Performer Final Points Host city Ref. 2022 Press Award \"Space Man\" Sam Ryder, Amy Wadge, Max Wolfgang (m&l) Sam Ryder 2 466 Turin [58]\n\nRelated involvement\n\n[edit]\n\nConductors\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Conductor[b] Musical Director Notes Ref. 1957 Eric Robinson N/A [59] 1959 1960 Eric Robinson [c] 1961 Harry Robinson NA 1962 Angela Morley [d] 1963 Eric Robinson [e] 1964 Harry Rabinowitz — 1965 Eric Robinson 1966 Harry Rabinowitz 1967 Kenny Woodman 1968 Norrie Paramor 1969 Johnny Harris N/A 1970 Johnny Arthey [60] 1971 [f] 1972 David Mackay Malcolm Lockyer 1973 N/A 1974 Nick Ingman Ronnie Hazlehurst 1975 Alyn Ainsworth N/A 1976 1977 Ronnie Hazlehurst [g] 1978 Alyn Ainsworth N/A 1979 Ken Jones [h] 1980 John Coleman [61] 1981 1982 Ronnie Hazlehurst 1983 John Coleman N/A 1984 1985 1986 N/A [i] 1987 Ronnie Hazlehurst N/A 1988 1989 1990 Alyn Ainsworth 1991 Ronnie Hazlehurst 1992 1993 Nigel Wright 1994 Michael Reed 1995 Mike Dixon 1996 Ernie Dunstall 1997 Don Airey 1998 James McMillan Martin Koch [j]\n\nAdditionally, several British conductors have conducted for other countries (not counting instances where a British musical director had to step in for another country that didn't bring their own conductor), including:\n\nConductor Country Year(s) Notes Alberto Semprini Italy 1958 Half-Italian Richard Hill Portugal 1972 Charles Blackwell Luxembourg 1974 Les Humphries Germany 1976 Leader of the Les Humphries Singers Alyn Ainsworth Belgium 1977 Johnny Arthey Luxembourg Del Newman Italy 1980 Martyn Ford Cyprus 1982, 1986 Mike Sergeant Portugal 1983, 1998 Colin Frechter 1986 Nigel Wright Iceland 1992\n\nHeads of delegation\n\n[edit]\n\nEach participating broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the performers, songwriters, composers, and backing vocalists, among others.[62]\n\nYear Head of delegation Ref. 1976 Bill Cotton 1988–1993 Jim Moir 1994–2007 Kevin Bishop 2008–2010 Dominic Smith 2011 Helen Tumbridge 2012–2013 Andrew Cartmell 2014–2017 Guy Freeman 2018 Helen Riddell 2019–2022 Andrew Cartmell 2023 Adam Wydrzynski 2024 Lee Smithurst\n\nCostume designers\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Costume designers Ref. 1990 Benetton 1991–1992 Linda Martin 1993 Verity Lewis 1994 Helen Storey 1996 Paco Rabanne 2009 Amanda Wakeley 2022 Luke Day\n\nOver the years, the BBC's commentary at the contest has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including Tom Fleming, David Vine, David Jacobs, Dave Lee Travis, Pete Murray, John Dunn, and Michael Aspel. Terry Wogan provided BBC TV commentary from 1980 to 2008,[71][72] after which he was replaced by Graham Norton from 2009.[73]\n\nThe final of the contest has been broadcast by BBC One (previously BBC Television Service and BBC TV) since the first contest in 1956, the first live colour transmission of the contest in the United Kingdom was the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 (though the 1968 contest had been repeated in colour on BBC Two the day after the live telecast on BBC One), and the first high definition broadcast of the contest began in 2007 when the contest was simulcast on BBC HD for the first time (this continued until the channel's closure). Outside the UK, the final was broadcast by BBC Prime from its launch in 1995 and continued to 2006. The final is also broadcast on radio, initially on BBC Light Programme until the 1967 contest. From 1968 it was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (simulcast on Radio 2), moving to BBC Radio 2 from the 1971 contest where it has remained ever since (except from 1983 to 1985, the first year of which due to a scheduling clash with the St. George's Day Concert). Between 1963 and 1976, in 1980 and again from 1983 until 1985, the contest was also broadcast on BFBS Radio, and in television in the years 1993, and 1997–1998. A simulcast of the 2002 contest was broadcast on BBC Choice with alternative commentary by Jenny Eclair. This was the first time the BBC had provided three different commentary options, the second was in 2023.[74] For the 2023 contest, additional coverage of all three shows was broadcast on BBC iPlayer with British Sign Language interpretation;[75] in 2024, this coverage moved to BBC Red Button.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015, and again in 2022, both semi-finals were broadcast on BBC Three. During BBC Three's tenure as an online only channel, semi-final coverage was broadcast on BBC Four.[76] In 2023, the semi-finals and final were broadcast on BBC One, BBC Radio 2, and BBC Radio Merseyside, with the latter providing alternative Liverpudlian commentary by Claire Sweeney and Paul Quinn (chosen as part of the station's \"The Voice of Eurovision\" talent search campaign) for the final.[75] In August 2023, it was confirmed that the semi-finals would remain on BBC One for the 2024 contest;[77] and later also on BBC Radio 2. In 2014, Ana Matronic provided commentary for the second semi-final of the 2014 contest on BBC Radio 2 Eurovision, a temporary station which was broadcast on DAB radio over four days, as well as the BBC Radio 2 website. She continued this role in 2015.[78]\n\nIn the 1998 contest, hosted in Birmingham, Terry Wogan acted as both commentator and on-stage presenter (together with Ulrika Jonsson). Graham Norton performed a similar role in the final of the 2023 contest, hosted in Liverpool, with Mel Giedroyc serving as co-commentator. In the 1980 contest, each song was introduced by a presenter from its country, with the UK entry being introduced by Noel Edmonds.\n\nYear Television commentator(s) Radio commentator(s) Alternative broadcast commentator(s) Spokesperson Ref.

This therefore means that spokespersons in contests from 2022 onwards would announce the points of the British national jury live from Dock10 in Salford.[290]\n\nSeparate entrants\n\n[edit]\n\nFor several years, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has campaigned for a place in the Eurovision Song Contest for Scotland but had been rejected numerous times, as Scotland is represented as a part of the British entry and is represented by the BBC.[291]\n\nOn 11 February 2008, the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom.[291] It was announced in late May 2008 that the UK would be participating in the 2009 contest and, therefore, Scotland was not represented in 2009 as a separate entrant.[292]\n\nScotland could be represented by STV, ITV Border or BBC Scotland. MEP Alyn Smith has said in the European Parliament: \"Other small countries have done it [entered the competition] and I will be happy to help any of the broadcasting companies through the progress.\"[293][294][295][296]\n\nIn 2011, the EBU stated that there was nothing to prevent Scotland from submitting its own entry, although STV stated that there were no current plans for a separate entry.[296]\n\nIf Scotland were to participate, it is unknown whether or not England, Wales and Northern Ireland would show any interest in entering the Eurovision Song Contest independently as well, although S4C (the Welsh language media channel) has expressed an interest and, in addition, already holds a yearly national song contest called Cân i Gymru (Song for Wales).[297] S4C also considered a bid for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008 but decided not to go ahead.[298] Wales eventually made its Junior Eurovision debut in 2018.[299] In 2009, MEP for Wales Jillian Evans stated her interest in securing Wales a place in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. Wales could be represented by either BBC Cymru Wales, ITV Wales & West or S4C. There is a small campaign in Northern Ireland for a separate entrant and it could be represented by UTV or BBC Northern Ireland.[300] There are no current plans for England to enter separately.\n\nHowever, to date, these proposed changes have not occurred, and the United Kingdom still participates in the Eurovision Song Contest as a single entrant. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, it was unknown what would happen if Scotland were to become an independent country. On 25 November 2013, the Scottish government released a referendum blueprint, which detailed plans for the transfer of BBC Scotland into a Scottish Broadcasting Service (SBS) and EBU membership, as well as participation in competitions, including Scottish entries in the Eurovision Song Contest.[301][302] However, the referendum result on 18 September 2014 was to remain part of the UK, and the aforementioned BBC retains exclusive rights to represent the UK, including Scotland.[303]\n\nSince 2006, Gibraltar has been attempting to gain EBU membership through broadcaster Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) and thus participate independently in the Eurovision Song Contest. However, GBC cannot obtain EBU membership due to the British Overseas Territories not being independent from the UK.[304] Gibraltar broadcast the final of the contest from 2006 to 2008.[304][305]\n\nPhoto gallery\n\n[edit]\n\nRonnie Carroll in Luxembourg (1962)\n\nKathy Kirby in Naples (1965)\n\nBrotherhood of Man in The Hague (1976)\n\nScooch in Helsinki (2007)\n\nAndy Abraham in Belgrade (2008)\n\nJade Ewen in Moscow (2009)\n\nJosh Dubovie in Oslo (2010)\n\nBlue in Düsseldorf (2011)\n\nBonnie Tyler in Malmö (2013)\n\nMolly in Copenhagen (2014)\n\nElectro Velvet in Vienna (2015)\n\nJoe and Jake in Stockholm (2016)\n\nLucie Jones in Kyiv (2017)\n\nSuRie in Lisbon (2018)\n\nMichael Rice in Tel Aviv (2019)\n\nMae Muller in Liverpool (2023)\n\nOlly Alexander in Malmö (2024)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nUK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nUnited Kingdom in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest – Junior version of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nUnited Kingdom in the Eurovision Dance Contest – Dance version of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nUnited Kingdom in the Eurovision Young Dancers – A competition organised by the EBU for younger dancers aged between 16 and 21.\n\nUnited Kingdom in the Eurovision Young Musicians – A competition organised by the EBU for musicians aged 18 years and younger.\n\nScotland in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nWales in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nGibraltar in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nNotes and references\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
