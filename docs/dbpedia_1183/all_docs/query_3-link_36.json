Fuel margin for all gallons sold was 11.8 cents per gallon for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 11.9 cents per gallon in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) for the Pipeline Systems segment in the second quarter of 2024 was $53 million.

The distribution will be paid on August 19, 2024, to common unitholders of record on August 9, 2024.\n\nLiquidity, Leverage and Credit\n\nAt June 30, 2024, SUN had long-term debt of approximately $7.3 billion and approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity remaining on its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. SUN's leverage ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA(1), calculated in accordance with its credit facility, was 4.1 times at the end of the second quarter.\n\nCapital Spending\n\nSUN's total capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 were $78 million, which included $52 million of growth capital and $26 million of maintenance capital.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn July 16, 2024, SUN announced the formation of a joint venture with Energy Transfer LP combining their respective crude oil and produced water gathering assets in the Permian Basin. The formation of the joint venture has an effective date of July 1, 2024.\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the Partnership entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a liquid fuels terminal in Portland, Maine.\n\nFull Year 2024 Business Outlook\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Partnership expects:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)(3) of $1.46 billion to $1.52 billion, excluding synergies and transaction-related expenses(2).\n\nApproximately $50 million in synergies related to the acquisition of NuStar.\n\nApproximately $100 million in transaction-related expenses.\n\nGrowth capital expenditures to be greater than $300 million and maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million.\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are non-GAAP financial measures of performance that have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income. Please refer to the discussion and tables under \"Supplemental Information\" later in this news release for a discussion of our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, and a reconciliation to net income.\n\n(2) Transaction-related expenses include certain one-time expenses incurred with acquisitions and divestitures. The Partnership's definition of Adjusted EBITDA includes transaction-related expenses, and the Partnership has not previously reported Adjusted EBITDA excluding transaction-related expenses. However, given the magnitude of the acquisition and divestiture transactions during the current period, as well as the expenses related to those transactions, the Partnership is reporting Adjusted EBITDA excluding these expenses in order to portray the Partnership's performance for the period without the impact of these one-time items.\n\n(3) A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors, including the unpredictability of commodity price movements and future charges or reversals outside the normal course of business which may be significant.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nSunoco LP management will hold a conference call on Wednesday, August 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss results and recent developments. To participate, dial 877-407-6184 (toll free) or 201-389-0877 approximately 10 minutes before the scheduled start time and ask for the Sunoco LP conference call.

Segment profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment profit is similar to the GAAP measure of gross profit, except that segment profit excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment profit is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment profit to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment profit is presented.\n\nFuel Distribution\n\nVolumes. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, volumes increased primarily due to growth from investments and profit optimization strategies.\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our Fuel Distribution segment increased due to the net impact of the following:\n\nan increase of $11 million related to a 5% increase in gallons sold, partially offset by a decrease in profit per gallon primarily as a result of the West Texas Sale; and\n\na decrease of $15 million in expenses primarily due to the West Texas Sale in April 2024 and lower allocated overhead; partially offset by\n\na decrease of $7 million in lease profit due to the West Texas Sale in April 2024.\n\nPipeline Systems\n\nVolumes. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, volumes increased due to recently acquired assets.\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our Pipeline Systems segment increased due to the acquisition of NuStar.\n\nTerminals\n\nVolumes.
