        "text": "1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. 4.1 minutes is equal to 246 seconds. Velocity would equal 1000 meters divided by 246 seconds. So the answer is 4.065 meters per second West.\n\nWhat is velocity of a car that travels 120 km in 2h?\n\nThe velocity of the car can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, 120 km รท 2h = 60 km/h. Therefore, the velocity of the car is 60 kilometers per hour.\n\nWhat is the velocity of light in air and water?\n\nThe velocity of light in air is about 299,792 kilometers per second, while in water it is about 225,000 kilometers per second. This difference is due to the differing refractive indexes of air and water, which affects the speed at which light travels through these mediums.\n\nIf an object travels for 15 minutes at a constant velocity of 12 miles per hour west what is its acceleration?\n\nThe acceleration is zero since the object is moving at a constant velocity. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and in this case, the velocity is not changing.\n\nWhat measures speed and direction an object travels?\n\nVelocity measures both speed and direction that an object travels. The magnitude of velocity represents the speed of the object, while the direction of velocity indicates the direction in which the object is moving."
