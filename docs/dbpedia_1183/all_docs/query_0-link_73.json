        "meta_description": "There is an increased incidence and prevalence of arthropathy in children with Down syndrome. However, it is rarely reported or recognised at onset, and remains under-diagnosed. Children with arthropathy of Down syndrome (A-DS) are presenting with significant joint damage and disability at diagnosis.\n\nObjective To identify undiagnosed cases of A-DS and document time to diagnosis. Also to describe clinical, laboratory and radiological features of A-DS at diagnosis.\n\nMethodology Children with Down syndrome (DS) (0–21 years) were invited to attend a musculoskeletal screening clinic. A second physician at a further clinic confirmed suspected cases of A-DS. Investigations and treatment were instigated as per normal clinical practice for Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Data on a convenience sample of 21 newly diagnosed children with JIA was collected to create a comparison group.\n\nResults Over an 18-month period, 503 children with DS were screened for arthritis and 18 new cases diagnosed. In total, 33 children were identified with A-DS (combining cases attending pre-dating commencement of the study and those referred to our centre during the study period). This suggests prevalence of A-DS is 20/1000. A significant delay in diagnosis of A-DS was observed. The majority of children presented with polyarticular-rheumatoid factor-negative arthritis, with predominance in the small joints of the hands and wrists. Erosive changes were reported on X-ray in a significantly greater proportion (42%) of children with A-DS than JIA (14%). MRI was used to confirm diagnosis in four cases.\n\nConclusion Children with DS are at increased risk of arthritis. Future research to accurately define disease pathogenesis and identify a biomarker of disease would be of benefit.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nPrior to commencement of this research, studies of arthritis associated with DS have been limited.26 29–32 In this report, we describe a cohort of 33 children with A-DS. Comparable to previous reports, our results confirm an increased risk of arthritis in children with DS. However, we suggest that prevalence is at least 2–3 times greater than previously reported. We also observed a significant delay in diagnosis of A-DS, the reasons for this being multifactorial.\n\nFigure 5 highlights the number of challenges that may be encountered when caring for children with DS that may impede correct and timely diagnosis of A-DS. The first is the lack of awareness about the increased risk of arthritis in children with DS among both the general public and healthcare professionals. This is illustrated by the fact that the majority of parents whose child received a diagnosis of A-DS following attendance at a screening clinic were unaware that their child was displaying signs of arthritis. In fact, the delay in time to diagnosis we report for our cohort of A-DS may be an underestimation as 45% (n=15) were unable to estimate time of symptom onset. These 15 cases were detected through the screening clinics. Lack of awareness can also contribute to misdiagnoses, a finding observed and reported by Cruikshank et al. (2008).38 In this study, the authors found that despite presenting on numerous occasions with clinical findings consistent with a diagnosis of arthritis, misdiagnoses such as soft tissue injury, multiple epiphysial dysplasia and development delay were made. Frequently delay in motor development is falsely attributed to intellectual disability, and changes in activities of daily living attributed to behavioural problems associated with DS, rather than a possible diagnosis of arthritis.31 Hypermobility, a feature of DS may make musculoskeletal examination more challenging, as it may be difficult to appreciate loss of range of movement secondary to an inflammatory arthritis. If there is gradual functional loss over time rather than an acute presentation, this may go undetected by the child’s parent/guardian thus contributing to a delay in diagnosis. Many children may be uncooperative when it comes to examination. This combined with poor verbal skills can make eliciting a clear history and thorough musculoskeletal examination challenging. Interestingly, the majority of children with A-DS detected through the screening clinics (89%) had poor language skills or were non-verbal, and 28% were on the autistic spectrum. This may explain why these children had not previously presented to their GP or paediatrician with joint concerns, as they may have been unable to articulate symptoms to their caregivers.\n\nApparent differences in pain expression have also been reported in children with DS. Studies have shown that fewer responses to painful stimuli have been observed in laboratory mice with DS, individuals with DS express pain or discomfort more slowly and less precisely than the general population, and parents of children with DS report more difficulty identifying pain, or the source of their child’s pain.39–41 Defrin et al (2004)42 suggest that individuals with DS are in fact more sensitive to pain than normal, but that slower reaction time gives the impression that pain threshold is higher than it actually is. With this understanding in mind, it is easy to see how differences in pain expression between children with and without DS may contribute to failure to report arthritis symptoms by children with A-DS. We identified that children with DS often adapt to pain with observations such as slowing mobility, reluctance to hold a parental hand or behavioural change reported by care givers. Therefore, a detailed history is required to identify potential clues that may aide diagnosis in suspected cases of A-DS.\n\nThe majority of children with A-DS presented with polyarticular-RF-negative arthritis, predominantly affecting the small joints of the hands and wrists. A high proportion had erosive changes at diagnosis, greater than observed in the JIA comparison group. This highlights that children with A-DS present with a greater degree of irreversible joint damage and disability at diagnosis. This may be as a consequence of the delay in diagnosis observed; however, our clinical impression is that A-DS appears to be a more aggressive, erosive disease than JIA such that children with A-DS are developing erosions earlier in their disease course than would typically be expected in a child with JIA.\n\nAlthough JIA is defined as onset of arthritis before 16 years, the highest frequency occurs in children aged 1–3 years.2 Disease onset before 1 year is distinctly unusual in any category of JIA, and no cases less than 1 year were identified in our JIA cohort. Age at diagnosis in our JIA cohort was biphasic, occurring in the 0–5 and 6–12 year age groups (figure 2C). The ILAR subtype, polyarticular-RF-negative JIA has two peaks in age of onset; the first in infancy (1–4 years) and the second at 6–12 years.43 Applying the ILAR criteria to our cohort of children with A-DS, most children would be classified as having polyarticular-RF-negative arthritis. However, in children with A-DS, the age at diagnosis was significantly older compared with our JIA cohort, and did not demonstrate a biphasic peak in age of onset as would be expected for a typical cohort of children with a polyarticular-RF-negative pattern of arthritis. Furthermore, in contrast to the apparent older age of onset of arthritis in children with A-DS, two children with DS developed arthritis before age 1, in fact both less than 6 months of age. It is likely that the older peak observed for age of diagnosis in the cohort of children with A-DS reflects delay to diagnosis. In fact, children with A-DS may develop arthritis at a younger age than would be expected for a child with JIA.\n\nClinical and laboratory features observed in A-DS appear to have some distinct differences to JIA. Eighty-one per cent of children with A-DS presented with polyarticular-RF-negative arthritis; this proportion being significantly greater than observed in the JIA cohort (figure 3B). Similar to our JIA cohort, in a global population of children with JIA, the ILAR subtype polyarticular JIA accounts for approximately 20%, about 15% of whom would be RF positive.2 44 No children with A-DS were RF positive. Oligoarticular JIA (50%–80%) is the most common form of childhood arthritis.2 This subtype was observed in only 3% of the A-DS cohort. The most commonly affected joint in JIA is a knee, whereas in A-DS the PIP joints of the hands (79%) predominate (figure 3C). In some instances (30%), children with A-DS presented with small joint and wrist involvement only. No children with A-DS were ANA positive or had developed uveitis at the time of publication. In a cohort of children with polyarticular-RF-negative arthritis, 40% would be expected to be ANA positive, and 10% to develop uveitis.2 45\n\nResults of APRs (CRP and ESR) were raised significantly less frequently in A-DS when compared to children with JIA, although ESR does appear to be more useful in aiding diagnosis of both conditions compared with CRP (figure 4B). This highlights the importance of a thorough history and examination when caring for children with suspected A-DS. Clinical signs can be extremely subtle and may include slight asymmetry or loss of end range of movement of the affected joint. This subtlety of clinical findings is often confounded by failure of children with DS to report pain on history or examination. Blood tests can be falsely reassuring and so a low threshold to refer for MRI with gadolinium contrast is advised in any suspected cases of A-DS. Our experience is that there was greater than expected MRI confirmation of active synovitis if correlating to clinical signs. In two of the four cases imaged with MRI although the history was suggestive of a possible previous inflammatory episode, there were no clinical signs to support the same on examination. MRI (with gadolinium contrast) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of active synovitis.43 It is very helpful in detecting synovial abnormalities within the joint, and is more sensitive than clinical and radiographic examination for detection of inflammatory soft tissue and early bone changes.43 However, high cost, limited availability and the frequent need for sedation can limit the use of MRI.\n\nWe describe a cohort of children with arthritis and DS that most frequently present with a polyarticular-RF-negative arthritis, predominantly affecting the small joints of the hands and wrists. The arthritis is erosive in nature; a finding we do not believe is solely related to the observed delay in diagnosis of A-DS. We also report a lack of ANA positivity and often-minimal acute phase markers on review of blood results. It may be reasonable to suggest that A-DS is a distinct disease to JIA. Children with DS have different genetics and immunology than children without DS, and are at increased risk of a number of autoimmune conditions, further supporting this theory.12-22 Future studies to explore the immune, histological and genetic basis of A-DS are required to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of A-DS.\n\nModern treatment of JIA involves rapid induction of disease control. At present, treatment for children with A-DS follows guidelines developed and implemented to treat JIA. However, this may not be best practice given the fact that we have identified a number of differences between the features of both arthritis cohorts. A detailed review of treatment instigated in our A-DS cohort and long-term disease outcome would be important to identify if this cohort respond to treatment as expected for children with JIA. This, combined with exploration of the immuno-histopathology of A-DS would enable identification of more targeted treatments for this cohort of children, providing a more personalised model of care, and in turn better clinical outcomes.\n\nThis study highlights the importance of raising awareness about the increased risk of arthritis in children with DS to aid better recognition and more timely diagnosis of A-DS. The addition of an annual musculoskeletal examination to the well-recognised health surveillance guidelines developed by the Down syndrome Medical interest group for all children with DS would be an initiative of great benefit to this cohort of children. As already stated, more work is required to better understand disease pathogenesis of A-DS and in turn identify best practice in terms of treatment guidelines for A-DS.\n\nFinally, we propose a more appropriate clinical term that better reflects the inflammatory, erosive nature of the disease would be DS-associated arthritis (DA). In order to facilitate more cohesive clinical practice and future collaborative research, we would hope that this could become a universally accepted term among healthcare professionals and the general public."
