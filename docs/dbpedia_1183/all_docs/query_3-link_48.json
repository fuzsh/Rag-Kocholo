        "text": "OVERVIEW[1]\n\nThis Section of the Compliance Manual focuses on religious discrimination under Title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). Title VII protects workers from employment discrimination based on their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and transgender status),[2] national origin, or protected activity. Under Title VII, an employer is prohibited from discriminating because of religion in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, or other “terms, conditions or privileges” of employment, and also cannot “limit, segregate, or classify” applicants or employees based on religion “in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.”[3] The statute defines “religion” as including “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that [it] is unable to reasonably accommodate . . . without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.”[4] “Undue hardship” under Title VII is not defined in the statute but has been defined by the Supreme Court as “more than a de minimis cost”[5] – a lower standard for employers to satisfy than the “undue hardship” defense under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is defined by statute as “significant difficulty or expense.”[6]\n\nThese protections apply whether the religious beliefs or practices in question are common or non-traditional, and regardless of whether they are recognized by any organized religion.[7] The test under Title VII’s definition of religion is whether the beliefs are, in the individual’s “own scheme of things, religious. ”[8] Belief in God or gods is not necessary; nontheistic beliefs can also be religious for purposes of the Title VII exemption as long as they “‘occupy in the life of that individual “a place parallel to that filled by . . . God” in traditionally religious persons.’”[9] The non-discrimination provisions of the statute also protect employees who do not possess religious beliefs or engage in religious practices.[10] EEOC, as a federal government enforcement agency, and its staff, like all governmental entities, carries out its mission neutrally and without any hostility to any religion or related observances, practices, and beliefs, or lack thereof.[11]\n\nThe number of religious discrimination charges filed with EEOC has increased significantly from fiscal years 1997 to 2019, although the total number of such charges remains relatively small compared to charges filed on other bases.[12] Many employers seek legal guidance in managing equal employment opportunity (“EEO”) issues that arise from religious diversity as well as the demands of the modern American workplace. This document is designed to be a practical resource for employers, employees, practitioners, and EEOC enforcement staff on Title VII’s prohibition against religious discrimination. It explains the variety of issues considered in workplace-related religious discrimination claims, discusses typical scenarios that may arise, and provides guidance to employers on how to balance the rights of individuals in an environment that includes people of varying religious faiths, or no faith.[13] However, this document does not have the force and effect of law and is not meant to bind the public in any way. It is intended to provide clarity to the public on existing requirements under the law and how the Commission will analyze these matters in performing its duties.\n\nFor ease of reference this document is organized by the following topics:\n\nI – Coverage issues, including the types of cases that arise, the definition of “religion” and “sincerely held,” the religious organization exemption, and the ministerial exception.\n\nII – Employment decisions based on religion, including recruitment, hiring, segregation, promotion, discipline, and compensation, as well as differential treatment with respect to religious expression; customer preference; security requirements; and bona fide occupational qualifications.\n\nIII – Harassment, including harassment based on religious belief or practice as a condition of employment or advancement, hostile work environment, and employer liability issues.\n\nIV – Reasonable accommodation, including notice of the conflict between religion and work where applicable, scope of the accommodation requirement and “undue hardship” defense, and common methods of accommodation.\n\nV – Related forms of discrimination, such as discrimination based on national origin, race, or color, as well as retaliation.\n\n12-I COVERAGE\n\nTypes of Cases\n\nTitle VII prohibits covered employers, employment agencies, and unions[14] from engaging in disparate treatment and from maintaining policies or practices that result in unjustified disparate impact based on religion. Historically, courts and the Commission characterized denial of accommodation as a separate cause of action.[15] In EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., the Supreme Court stated that there are only two causes of action under Title VII: “disparate treatment” (or “intentional discrimination”) and “disparate impact.”[16] It treated a claim based on a failure to accommodate a religious belief, observance, or practice (absent undue hardship) as a form of disparate treatment.[17] The Commission recognizes that harassment and denial of religious accommodation are typically forms of disparate treatment in the terms and conditions of employment. Different types of fact patterns may arise in relation to Title VII religious discrimination, including:\n\ntreating applicants or employees differently (disparate treatment) by taking an adverse action based on their religious beliefs, observances, or practices (or lack of religious beliefs, observances or practices) in any aspect of employment, including recruitment, hiring, assignments, discipline, promotion, discharge, and benefits;\n\ntaking adverse action motivated by a desire to avoid accommodating a religious belief, observance, or practice that the employer knew or suspected may be needed and would not pose an undue hardship;\n\ndenying a needed reasonable accommodation sought for an applicant’s or employee’s sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, or practices if an accommodation will not impose an undue hardship on the conduct of the business;\n\nintentionally limiting, segregating or classifying employees based on the presence or absence of religious beliefs, observances, or practices (also a form of disparate treatment), or enforcing a neutral rule that has the effect of limiting, segregating, or classifying an applicant or employee based on religious beliefs, observances, or practices and that cannot be justified by business necessity (disparate impact);\n\nsubjecting employees to harassment because of their religious beliefs, observances, or practices (or lack of religious beliefs, observances or practices) or because of a belief that someone of the employee’s religion should not associate with someone else (e.g., discrimination because of an employee’s religious inter-marriage, etc.);\n\nretaliating against an applicant or employee who has opposed discrimination on the basis of religion, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing regarding discrimination on the basis of religion, including by filing an equal employment opportunity (EEO) charge or testifying as a witness in someone else’s EEO matter, or complaining to a human resources department about alleged religious discrimination.\n\nAlthough more than one of these issues may be raised in a particular case, they are discussed in separate parts of this manual for ease of use.\n\n· NOTE TO EEOC INVESTIGATORS ·\n\nCharges involving religion, like charges filed on other bases, may give rise to more than one theory of discrimination (e.g., termination, harassment, denial of reasonable accommodation, or other forms of disparate treatment, as well as retaliation). Therefore, these charges could be investigated and analyzed under all theories of liability to the extent applicable.\n\nA. Definitions\n\nOverview: Religion is very broadly defined for purposes of Title VII. The presence of a deity or deities is not necessary for a religion to receive protection under Title VII. Religious beliefs can include unique beliefs held by a few or even one individual; however, mere personal preferences are not religious beliefs. Individuals who do not practice any religion are also protected from discrimination on the basis of religion or lack thereof. Title VII requires employers to accommodate religious beliefs, practices and observances if the beliefs are “sincerely held” and the reasonable accommodation poses no undue hardship on the employer.\n\n1. Religion\n\nTitle VII defines “religion” to include “all aspects of religious observance and practice as well as belief,” not just practices that are mandated or prohibited by a tenet of the individual’s faith.[18] Religion includes not only traditional, organized religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, but also religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or that seem illogical or unreasonable to others.[19] Further, a person’s religious beliefs “need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion.”[20] A belief is “religious” for Title VII purposes if it is “religious” in the person’s “own scheme of things,” i.e., it is a “sincere and meaningful” belief that “occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by . . . God.”[21] The Supreme Court has made it clear that it is not a court’s role to determine the reasonableness of an individual’s religious beliefs, and that “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.”[22] An employee’s belief, observance, or practice can be “religious” under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual’s belief, observance, or practice, or if few – or no – other people adhere to it.[23]\n\nReligious beliefs include theistic beliefs as well as non-theistic “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.”[24] Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious,[25] beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns “ultimate ideas” about “life, purpose, and death.”[26]\n\nCourts have looked for certain features to determine if an individual’s beliefs can be considered religious. As one court explained: “‘First, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.’”[27]\n\nSocial, political, or economic philosophies, as well as mere personal preferences, are not religious beliefs protected by Title VII.[28] However, overlap between a religious and political view does not place it outside the scope of Title VII’s religion protections, as long as that view is part of a comprehensive religious belief system and is not simply an “isolated teaching.”[29] Religious observances or practices include, for example, attending worship services, praying, wearing religious garb or symbols, displaying religious objects, adhering to certain dietary rules, proselytizing or other forms of religious expression, and refraining from certain activities. Determining whether a practice is religious turns not on the nature of the activity, but on the employee’s motivation. The same practice might be engaged in by one person for religious reasons and by another person for purely secular reasons.[30] Whether the practice is religious is therefore a situational, case-by-case inquiry, focusing not on what the activity is but on whether the employee’s participation in the activity is pursuant to a religious belief.[31] For example, one employee might observe certain dietary restrictions for religious reasons while another employee adheres to the very same dietary restrictions but for secular (e.g., health or environmental) reasons.[32] In that instance, the same practice in one case might be subject to reasonable accommodation under Title VII because an employee engages in the practice for religious reasons, and in another case might not be subject to reasonable accommodation because the practice is engaged in for secular reasons.[33] However, EEOC and courts must exercise a “light touch” in making this determination.[34]\n\nThe following examples illustrate these concepts:\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\nEmployment Decisions Based on “Religion”\n\nAn otherwise qualified applicant is not hired because he is a self-described evangelical Christian. A qualified non-Jewish employee is denied promotion because the supervisor wishes to give a preference based on religion to a fellow Jewish employee. An employer terminates an employee based on his disclosure to the employer that he has recently converted to the Baha’i Faith. Each of these is an example of an employment decision based on the religious belief or practice of the applicant or employee, and therefore is discrimination based on “religion” within the meaning of Title VII.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\nReligious Practice versus Secular Practice\n\nA Seventh-day Adventist employee follows a vegetarian diet because she believes it is religiously prescribed by scripture. Her vegetarianism is a religious practice, even though not all Seventh-day Adventists share this belief or follow this practice, and even though many individuals adhere to a vegetarian diet for purely secular reasons.\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\nTypes of Religious Practice or Observance\n\nA Catholic employee requests a schedule change so that he can attend a church service on Good Friday. A Muslim employee requests an exception to the company’s dress and grooming code allowing her to wear her headscarf, or a Hindu employee requests an exception allowing her to wear her bindi (religious forehead marking). An employee asks to be excused from the religious invocation offered at the beginning of staff meetings because he objects on religious grounds or does not ascribe to the religious sentiments expressed. An adherent to Native American spiritual beliefs seeks unpaid leave to attend a ritual ceremony. An employee who identifies as Christian but is not affiliated with a particular sect or denomination requests accommodation of his religious belief that working on his Sabbath is prohibited. Each of these requests relates to a “religious” belief, observance, or practice within the meaning of Title VII. The question of whether the employer is required to grant these requests is discussed in the section below addressing religious accommodation.\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\nSupervisor Considers Belief Illogical\n\nMorgan asks for time off on October 31 to attend the “Samhain Sabbat,” the New Year observance of Wicca, her religion. Her supervisor refuses, saying that Wicca is not a “real” religion but an “illogical conglomeration” of “various aspects of the occult, such as faith healing, self‑hypnosis, tarot card reading, and spell casting, which are not religious practices.” The supervisor’s refusal to accommodate her on the ground that he believes her religion is illogical or not a “real religion” violates Title VII unless the employer can show her request would impose an undue hardship. The law applies to religious beliefs even though others may find them “incorrect” or “incomprehensible.”[35]\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\nUnique Belief Can Be Religious\n\nEdward practices the Kemetic religion, based on ancient Egyptian faith, and affiliates himself with a tribe numbering fewer than ten members. He states that he believes in various deities, and follows the faith’s concept of Ma’at, a guiding principle regarding truth and order that represents physical and moral balance in the universe. During a religious ceremony he received small tattoos encircling his wrist, written in the Coptic language, which express his servitude to Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun. When his employer asks him to cover the tattoos, he explains that it is a sin to cover them intentionally because doing so would signify a rejection of Ra. These can be religious beliefs and practices even if no one else or few other people subscribe to them.[36]\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\nPersonal Preference That Is Not a Religious Belief\n\nSylvia’s job has instituted a policy that employees cannot have visible tattoos while working. Sylvia refuses to cover a tattoo on her arm that is the logo of her favorite band. When her manager asks her to cover the tattoo, she states that she cannot and that she feels so passionately about the importance of the band to her life that it is essentially her religion. However, the evidence demonstrates that her tattoos and her feelings do not relate to any “ultimate concerns” such as life, purpose, death, humanity’s place in the universe, or right and wrong, and they are not part of a moral or ethical belief system. Simply feeling passionately about something is not enough to give it the status of a religion in someone’s life. Therefore, her belief is a personal preference that is not religious in nature.[37]\n\n2. Sincerely Held\n\nTitle VII requires employers to accommodate those religious beliefs that are “sincerely held.”[38] Whether or not a religious belief is sincerely held by an applicant or employee is rarely at issue in many types of Title VII religious claims.[39] For example, with respect to an allegation of discriminatory discharge or harassment, it is the motivation of the discriminating official, not the actual beliefs of the individual alleging discrimination, that is relevant in determining if the discrimination that occurred was because of religion. A detailed discussion of reasonable accommodation of sincerely held religious beliefs appears in § 12-IV, but the meaning of “sincerely held” is addressed here.\n\nLike the religious nature of a belief, observance, or practice, the sincerity of an employee’s stated religious belief is usually not in dispute and is “generally presumed or easily established.”[40] Further, the Commission and courts “are not and should not be in the business of deciding whether a person holds religious beliefs for the ‘proper’ reasons. We thus restrict our inquiry to whether or not the religious belief system is sincerely held; we do not review the motives or reasons for holding the belief in the first place.”[41] The individual’s sincerity in espousing a religious observance or practice is “largely a matter of individual credibility.”[42] Moreover, “a sincere religious believer doesn’t forfeit his religious rights merely because he is not scrupulous in his observance,”[43] although “[e]vidence tending to show that an employee acted in a manner inconsistent with his professed religious belief is, of course, relevant to the factfinder’s evaluation of sincerity.”[44] Factors that – either alone or in combination – might undermine an employee’s credibility include: whether the employee has behaved in a manner markedly inconsistent with the professed belief;[45] whether the accommodation sought is a particularly desirable benefit that is likely to be sought for secular reasons;[46] whether the timing of the request renders it suspect (e.g., it follows an earlier request by the employee for the same benefit for secular reasons);[47] and whether the employer otherwise has reason to believe the accommodation is not sought for religious reasons.\n\nHowever, none of these factors is dispositive. For example, although prior inconsistent conduct is relevant to the question of sincerity, an individual’s beliefs – or degree of adherence – may change over time, and therefore an employee’s newly adopted or inconsistently observed religious practice may nevertheless be sincerely held.[48] Similarly, an individual’s belief may be to adhere to a religious custom only at certain times, even though others may always adhere,[49] or, fearful of discrimination, he or she may have forgone his or her sincerely held religious practice during the application process and not revealed it to the employer until after he or she was hired or later in employment.[50] An employer also should not assume that an employee is insincere simply because some of his or her practices deviate from the commonly followed tenets of his or her religion, or because the employee adheres to some common practices but not others.[51] As noted, courts have held that “Title VII protects more than . . . practices specifically mandated by an employee’s religion.”[52]\n\n3. Employer Inquiries into Religious Nature or Sincerity of Belief\n\nBecause the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs, observances, and practices with which the employer may be unfamiliar, the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee’s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief. If, however, an employee requests religious accommodation, and an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, observance, or practice, the employer would be justified in seeking additional supporting information. See infra § 12‑IV‑A‑2.\n\n· NOTE TO EEOC INVESTIGATORS ·\n\nIf the Respondent (R) disputes that the Charging Party’s (“CP’s”) belief is “religious,” consider the following:\n\n⇒ Begin with the CP’s statements. What religious belief, observance, or practice does the CP claim to have that conflicts with an employment requirement? In most cases, the CP’s credible testimony regarding his belief, observance, or practice will be sufficient to demonstrate that it is religious. In other cases, however, the investigator may need to ask follow-up questions about the nature and tenets of the asserted religious beliefs, and/or any associated practices, rituals, clergy, observances, etc., in order to identify a specific religious belief, observance, or practice or determine if one is at issue, which conflicts with an employment requirement.\n\n⇒ Since religious beliefs can be unique to an individual, evidence from others is not always necessary. However, if the CP believes such evidence will support his or her claim, the investigator could seek evidence such as oral statements, affidavits, or other documents from CP’s religious leader(s) if applicable, or others whom CP identifies as knowledgeable regarding the religious belief, observance, or practice in question that conflicts with an employment requirement.\n\n⇒ Remember, where an alleged religious observance, practice, or belief is at issue, a case-by-case analysis is required. Investigators should not make assumptions about the nature of an observance, practice, or belief. In determining whether CP’s asserted observance, practice, or belief is “religious” as defined under Title VII, the investigator’s general knowledge will often be sufficient; if additional objective information has to be obtained, the investigator should nevertheless recognize the intensely personal characteristics of adherence to a religious belief.\n\n⇒ If the Respondent disputes that CP’s belief is “sincerely held,” the following evidence may be relevant:\n\n⇒ Oral statements, an affidavit, or other documents from CP describing his or her beliefs and practices, including information regarding when CP embraced the belief, observance, or practice, as well as when, where, and how CP has adhered to the belief, observance, or practice; and/or,\n\n⇒ Oral statements, affidavits, or other documents from potential witnesses identified by CP or R as having knowledge of whether CP adheres or does not adhere to the belief, observance, or practice at issue (e.g., CP’s religious leader (if applicable), fellow adherents (if applicable), family, friends, neighbors, managers, or coworkers who may have observed his past adherence or lack thereof, or discussed it with him).\n\nB. Covered Entities\n\nOverview: Title VII coverage rules apply to all religious discrimination claims under the statute. However, specially defined “religious organizations” and “religious educational institutions” are exempt from certain religious discrimination provisions, and the ministerial exception bars EEO claims by employees of religious institutions who perform vital religious duties at the core of the mission of the religious institution.\n\nTitle VII’s prohibitions apply to employers, employment agencies, and unions,[53] subject to the statute’s coverage.[54] Those covered entities must carry out their activities in a nondiscriminatory manner and provide reasonable accommodation unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.[55] Unions also can be liable if they knowingly acquiesce in employment discrimination against their members, join or tolerate employers’ discriminatory practices, or discriminatorily refuse to represent employees’ interests, and employment agencies can be liable for participating in the client-employer’s discrimination.[56]\n\nC. Exceptions\n\n1. Religious Organizations\n\nWhat Entities are “Religious Organizations”? Under sections 702(a) and 703(e)(2) of Title VII, “a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society,” including a religious “school, college, university, or educational institution or institution of learning,” is permitted to hire and employ individuals “of a particular religion . . . .”[57] This “religious organization” exemption applies only to those organizations whose “purpose and character are primarily religious,” but to determine whether this statutory exemption applies, courts have looked at “all the facts,” considering and weighing “the religious and secular characteristics” of the entity.[58] Courts have articulated different factors to determine whether an entity is a religious organization, including (1) whether the entity operates for a profit; (2) whether it produces a secular product; (3) whether the entity’s articles of incorporation or other pertinent documents state a religious purpose; (4) whether it is owned, affiliated with or financially supported by a formally religious entity such as a church or synagogue; (5) whether a formally religious entity participates in the management, for instance by having representatives on the board of trustees; (6) whether the entity holds itself out to the public as secular or sectarian; (7) whether the entity regularly includes prayer or other forms of worship in its activities; (8) whether it includes religious instruction in its curriculum, to the extent it is an educational institution; and (9) whether its membership is made up of coreligionists.[59] Depending on the facts, courts have found that Title VII’s religious organization exemption applies not only to churches and other houses of worship, but also to religious schools, hospitals, and charities.[60]\n\nCourts have expressly recognized that engaging in secular activities does not disqualify an employer from being a “religious organization” within the meaning of the Title VII statutory exemption. “[R]eligious organizations may engage in secular activities without forfeiting protection” under the Title VII statutory exemption.[61] The Title VII statutory exemption provisions do not mention nonprofit and for-profit status.[62] Title VII case law has not definitively addressed whether a for-profit corporation that satisfies the other factors can constitute a religious corporation under Title VII.[63]\n\nWhere the religious organization exemption is asserted by a respondent employer, the Commission will consider the facts on a case-by-case basis; no one factor is dispositive in determining if a covered entity is a religious organization under Title VII’s exemption.\n\nScope of Religious Organization Exemption. Section 702(a) states, “[t]his subchapter shall not apply to … a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society . . . with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on . . . of its activities.”[64] Religious organizations are subject to the Title VII prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin (as well as the anti-discrimination provisions of the other EEO laws such as the ADEA, ADA, and GINA), and may not engage in related retaliation.[65] However, sections 702(a) and 703(e)(2)[66] allow a qualifying religious organization to assert as a defense to a Title VII claim of discrimination or retaliation that it made the challenged employment decision on the basis of religion.[67] The definition of “religion” found in section 701(j) is applicable to the use of the term in sections 702(a) and 703(e)(2), although the provision of the definition regarding reasonable accommodations is not relevant.[68]\n\nCourts have held that the religious organization’s assertion that the challenged employment decision was made on the basis of religion is subject to a pretext inquiry where the employee has the burden to prove pretext.[69] Courts also have held that any inquiry into the pretext of a religious organization’s rationale for its decision must be limited to “sincerity” and cannot be used to challenge the validity or plausibility of the underlying religious doctrine.[70] For example, one court has held that a religious organization could not justify denying insurance benefits only to married women by asserting a religiously based view that only men could be the head of a household when evidence of practice inconsistent with such a belief established “conclusive[ly]” that the employer’s religious justification was “pretext” for sex discrimination.[71]\n\nIn EEOC v. Mississippi College, the court held that if a religious institution presents “convincing evidence” that the challenged employment practice resulted from discrimination on the basis of religion, section 702 “deprives the EEOC of jurisdiction to investigate further to determine whether the religious discrimination was a pretext for some other form of discrimination.”[72] Despite the court’s use of “jurisdiction” here, it has been held in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., that Title VII’s religious organization exemptions are not jurisdictional.[73]\n\nThe religious organization exemption is not limited to jobs involved in the specifically religious activities of the organization.[74] Rather, “the explicit exemptions to Title VII . . . enable religious organizations to create and maintain communities composed solely of individuals faithful to their doctrinal practices, whether or not every individual plays a direct role in the organization’s ‘religious activities.’”[75] In addition, the exemption allows religious organizations to prefer to employ individuals who share their religion, defined not by the self-identified religious affiliation of the employee, but broadly by the employer’s religious observances, practices, and beliefs.[76] Consistent with applicable EEO laws, the prerogative of a religious organization to employ individuals “‘of a particular religion’ . . . has been interpreted to include the decision to terminate an employee whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent with those of its employer.”[77] Some courts have held that the religious organization exemption can still be established notwithstanding actions such as holding oneself out as an equal employment opportunity employer or hiring someone of a different religion for a position.[78]\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\nReligious Organization Exemption Applies\n\nJustina taught mathematics at a small Catholic college, which requires all employees to agree to adhere to Catholic doctrine. After she signed a pro-choice advertisement in the local newspaper, the college terminated her employment because of her public support of a position in violation of Church doctrine. Justina claimed sex discrimination, alleging that male professors were treated less harshly for other conduct that violated Church doctrine. Because the exemption to Title VII preserves the religious school’s ability to maintain a community composed of individuals faithful to its doctrinal practices, and because evaluating Justina’s discipline compared to the male professors, who engaged in different behavior, would require the court to compare the relative severity of violations of religious doctrines, Title VII’s religious organization exemption bars adjudication of the sex discrimination claim.[79] The analysis would be different if a male professor at the school signed the same advertisement and was not terminated, because “[r]equiring a religious employer to explain why it has treated two employees who have committed essentially the same offense differently poses no threat to the employer's ability to create and maintain communities of the faithful.”[80]\n\n2. Ministerial Exception\n\nIn Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC,[81] the Supreme Court “unanimously recognized that the Religion Clauses [of the First Amendment] foreclose certain employment-discrimination claims brought against religious organizations.”[82] The Court held that the First Amendment safeguards the right of a religious organization, free from interference from civil authorities, to select those who will “personify its beliefs,” “shape its own faith and mission,” or “minister to the faithful.”[83] This rule is known as the “ministerial exception,” apparently because “the individuals involved in pioneering cases were described as ‘ministers,’”[84] but as discussed below, the exception is not limited to “ministers” or members of the clergy. The rule provides “an affirmative defense to an otherwise cognizable claim, not a jurisdictional bar.”[85]\n\nThe exception applies to discrimination claims involving selection, supervision, and removal against a religious institution by employees who “play certain key roles.” [86] “The constitutional foundation” of the Court’s holding in Hosanna-Tabor was “the general principle of church autonomy.”[87] “Among other things, the Religion Clauses protect the right of churches and other religious institutions to decide matters ‘of faith and doctrine’ without government intrusion.”[88] The First Amendment “outlaws” such intrusion because “[s]tate interference in that sphere would obviously violate the free exercise of religion, and any attempt by government to dictate or even to influence such matters would constitute one of the central attributes of an establishment of religion.”[89] “This does not mean that religious institutions enjoy a general immunity from secular laws, but it does protect their autonomy with respect to internal management decisions that are essential to the institution’s central mission.”[90]\n\nA “religious institution” for purposes of the ministerial exception is one whose “mission is marked by clear or obvious religious characteristics.”[91] Like Title VII’s religious organization exemption, courts have applied the ministerial exception to religious employers beyond churches and other houses of worship.[92] But unlike the statutory religious organization exemption, the ministerial exception applies regardless of whether the challenged employment decision was for “religious” reasons.[93]\n\nAs the Supreme Court stated in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, the ministerial exception applies to employees who perform “vital religious duties” at the core of the mission of the religious institution.[94] The Supreme Court in Hosanna-Tabor declined to adopt a “rigid formula”[95] for deciding when the ministerial exception applies. Instead, in deciding whether a Lutheran school teacher’s retaliation claim was barred by the ministerial exception, the Supreme Court looked to “all the circumstances of her employment,” recognizing four “considerations” or “circumstances that [it] found relevant in that case”: (1) the employee’s formal title; (2) education or training; (3) the employee’s own use of the title; and (4) the “important religious functions” the employee performed.[96] The Court further explained that, while relevant, “a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage,”[97] and that the title “minister” is not “a necessary requirement,” cautioning against “attaching too much significance to titles.”[98] Relatedly, while academic requirements are relevant, “insisting in every case on rigid academic requirements could have a distorting effect” and “judges have no warrant to second-guess [a religious institution’s qualification] judgment or to impose their own credentialing requirements.”[99] The Court rejected the view that the ministerial exception “should be limited to those employees who perform exclusively religious functions” and cautioned against placing too much emphasis on the performance of secular duties or the time spent on those duties.[100]\n\nIn Our Lady of Guadalupe School, the Court reiterated that the four “considerations” relevant in Hosanna-Tabor are not intended to constitute a four-factor test because “a variety of factors may be important.”[101] The Court explained that Hosanna-Tabor directs “courts to take all relevant circumstances into account and to determine whether each particular position implicated the fundamental purpose of the exception.”[102] The circumstances that were instructive in Hosanna-Tabor are not “inflexible requirements” and may have “far less significance in some cases” because “[w]hat matters, at bottom, is what an employee does.”[103]\n\nThe religious institution’s “definition and explanation” of an employee’s role “in the life of the religion in question is important.”[104] The ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a religious congregation, leaders, ministers, or members of the clergy, and can apply to “lay” employees and even non-“co-religionists” or those not “practicing” the faith.[105] Courts have applied the ministerial exception in cases involving parochial school teachers,[106] church musicians,[107] and other employees who perform religious functions.[108]\n\nIn Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Court explained that for a private religious school, “educating and forming students in the faith,” “inculcating its teachings, and training [students] to live their faith are responsibilities that lie at the very core of the mission” and “the selection and supervision of the teachers” who do this work are necessarily core elements of achieving the mission.[109] The Court declined to “draw a critical distinction between a person who “simply relay[s] religious tenets” and one who relays such tenets while also “minister[ing] to the faithful,” but noted that a teacher of “world religions,” “who merely provides a description of the beliefs and practices of a religion without making any effort to inculcate those beliefs could not qualify for the exception.”[110]\n\nIn holding that the ministerial exception barred employment discrimination claims by two elementary school teachers in Roman Catholic schools in Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Court found abundant evidence that the teachers “performed vital religious duties,” including: their employment contracts required them to carry out the schools’ religious mission and specified “that their work would be evaluated to ensure that they were fulfilling that responsibility”; their job duties required them to teach all subjects, including religion; they prepared their students for participation in religious activities, prayed with them, and attended Mass with them; and, they were the staff members “entrusted most directly with the responsibility of educating their students in the faith,” which included teaching them about the Catholic faith and guiding them “by word and deed, toward the goal of living their lives in accordance with the faith.”[111] Therefore, even though the teachers each lacked a religious title and the religious training possessed by the teacher in Hosanna-Tabor, their core responsibilities as teachers of religion were essentially the same as hers, and “their schools expressly saw them as playing a vital role in carrying out the mission of the church.”[112]\n\nThe ministerial exception is not just a legal defense that can be raised by religious institutions, but a constitutionally-based guarantee that obligates the government and the courts to refrain from interfering or entangling themselves with religion.[113] As such, it should be resolved at the earliest possible stage before reaching the underlying discrimination claim.[114] Some courts have held that the ministerial exception is not waivable.[115]\n\n3. Additional Interaction of Title VII with the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)\n\nAs noted above, the ministerial exception is based on the interaction between the workplace and the First Amendment. The applicability and scope of other defenses based on Title VII’s interaction with the First Amendment or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is an evolving area of the law. [116] It is not within the scope of this document to define the parameters of the First Amendment or RFRA. However, these provisions are referenced throughout this document to illustrate how they arise in Title VII cases and how courts have analyzed them. For example:\n\na private sector employer or a religious organization might argue that its rights under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise or Free Speech Clauses, or under RFRA, would be violated if it is compelled by Title VII to grant a particular accommodation or otherwise refrain from enforcing an employment policy;[117]\n\na government employer might argue that granting a requested religious accommodation would pose an undue hardship because it would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment;[118]\n\nsome government employees might argue that their religious expression is protected by the First Amendment, RFRA, and/or Title VII;[119] and,\n\nsome government employees raise claims under the First Amendment or RFRA parallel to their Title VII accommodation claims;[120] to date, appellate courts have uniformly held that Title VII preempts federal employees from bringing RFRA claims against their agency employer.[121]\n\nCourts addressing the overlap between EEO laws and rights under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause have stressed the importance of a nuanced balancing of potential burdens on religious expression, the governmental interests at issue, and how narrowly tailored the challenged government requirements are.[122]\n\nNOTE: EEOC investigators must take great care in situations involving both (a) the statutory rights of employees to be free from discrimination at work, and (b) the rights of employers under the First Amendment and RFRA. Although a resolution satisfactory to all may come from good faith on the part of the employer and employee through mutual efforts to reach a reasonable accommodation, on occasion the religious interests of the employer and employee may be in conflict. EEOC personnel should seek the advice of the EEOC Legal Counsel in such a situation, and on occasion the Legal Counsel may consult as needed with the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n12-II EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS\n\nA. General\n\nTitle VII’s prohibition against discrimination based on religion generally functions like its prohibition against discrimination based on race, color, sex, or national origin. Absent a defense, disparate treatment violates the statute whether motivated by bias against or preference toward an applicant or employee due to his religious beliefs, practices, or observances – or lack thereof. Thus, for example, except to the extent an exemption, exception, or defense applies, an employer may not refuse to recruit, hire or promote individuals of a certain religion, may not impose stricter promotion requirements for persons of a certain religion, and may not impose more or different work requirements on an employee because of that employee’s religious beliefs or practices.[123] The following subsections address work scenarios that may lead to claims of religious discrimination.\n\n1. Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotion\n\nEmployers that are not religious organizations may neither recruit indicating a preference for individuals of a particular religion nor adopt recruitment practices, such as word-of-mouth recruitment, that have the purpose or effect of discriminating based on religion.[124] Title VII permits employers that are not religious organizations to recruit, hire and employ employees on the basis of religion only if religion is “a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.”[125]\n\nFor example, other than as discussed above with respect to the religious organization and ministerial exceptions discussed above, an employer may not refuse to hire an applicant simply because the applicant does not share the employer’s religious beliefs, and conversely may not select one applicant over another based on a preference for employees of a particular religion.[126] Similarly, employment agencies may not comply with requests from employers to engage in discriminatory recruitment or referral practices, for example by screening out applicants who have names often associated with a particular religion (e.g., Mohammed).[127] Moreover, an employer may not exclude an applicant from hire merely because the applicant may need a reasonable accommodation for his or her religious beliefs, observances, or practices that could be provided absent undue hardship.[128]\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\nRecruitment\n\nCharles, the president of a company that owns several gas stations, needs managers for the new convenience stores he has decided to add to the stations. He posts a job announcement at the Hindu Temple he attends expressing a preference for Hindu employees. In doing so, Charles is engaging in unlawful discrimination.[129]\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\nHiring\n\nA. Mary is a human resources officer who is filling a vacant administrative position at her company. During the application process, she performs an Internet search on the candidates and learns that one applicant, Jonathan, has written an article in which he describes himself as an Evangelical Christian and discusses how important his Christian faith is to all aspects of his life. Although Mary believes he is the most qualified candidate, she does not hire him because she knows that the company prefers to have a “secular” work environment and she thinks that most of the company’s employees will find working with someone so religious “weird.” Therefore, Mary decides that it is best not to hire Jonathan. By not hiring Jonathan because of his religion, the company violated Title VII.\n\nB. Aatma, an applicant for a rental car sales position who is an observant Sikh, wears a dastaar (religious headscarf) to her job interview. The interviewer does not advise her that there is a dress code prohibiting head coverings, and Aatma does not ask whether she would be permitted to wear the headscarf if she were hired. The manager knew or suspected the headscarf was a religious garment, presumed it would be worn at work, and refused to hire her because the company requires sales agents to wear a uniform with no additions or exceptions. Unless the employer can demonstrate that no reasonable accommodation was possible absent undue hardship, this refusal to hire violates Title VII, even though Aatma did not make a request for accommodation at the interview, because the employer believed her practice was religious and that she would need accommodation, and did not hire her for that reason.[130]\n\nC. A company’s policy bars any employees from working in customer contact positions if they have a beard or wear a headcovering, and requests for religious accommodations are always denied. As a result of this policy and practice, individuals who wear beards or headcoverings pursuant to a religious belief work in lower-paying positions or positions with less opportunity for advancement. This would constitute limiting, segregating, or classifying based on religion in violation of Title VII, and may also have an unlawful disparate impact based on religion if it is not job-related and consistent with business necessity.[131]\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\nPromotion\n\nDarpak, who practices Buddhism, holds a Ph.D. degree in engineering and applied for a managerial position at the research firm where he has worked for ten years. He was rejected in favor of a non-Buddhist candidate who was less qualified. The company vice president who made the promotion decision advised Darpak that he was not selected because “we decided to go in a different direction.” However, the vice president confided to coworkers at a social function that he did not select Darpak because he thought a Christian manager could make better personal connections with the firm’s clients, many of whom are Christian. The vice president’s statement, combined with the lack of any legitimate non-discriminatory reason for selecting the less qualified candidate, as well as the evidence that Darpak was the best qualified candidate for the position, suggests that the proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination against Darpak because of his religion.[132]\n\n2. Discipline and Discharge\n\nTitle VII also prohibits employers from disciplining or discharging employees because of their religion.[133]\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\nDiscipline\n\nJoanne, a retail store clerk, is frequently 10-15 minutes late for her shift on several days per week when she attends Mass at a Catholic church across town. Her manager, Donald, has never disciplined her for this tardiness, and instead filled in for her at the cash register until she arrived, stating that he understood her situation. On the other hand, Yusef, a newly hired clerk who is Muslim, is disciplined by Donald for arriving 10 minutes late for his shift even though Donald knows it is due to his attendance at services at the local mosque. While Donald can require all similarly situated employees to be punctual, he is engaging in disparate treatment based on religion by disciplining only Yusef and not Joanne absent a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for treating them differently.\n\nA charge alleging the above facts might involve denial of reasonable accommodation if the employee had requested a schedule adjustment. While the employer may require employees to be punctual and request approval of schedule changes in advance,[134] it may have to accommodate an employee who seeks leave or a schedule change to resolve the conflict between religious services and a work schedule, unless the accommodation would pose an undue hardship.\n\n3. Compensation and Other Terms, Conditions, or Privileges of Employment\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination on a protected basis “with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,” for example, setting or adjusting wages, granting benefits, and/or providing leave in a discriminatory fashion.[135]\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\nWages and Benefits\n\nJanet, who practices Native American spirituality, is a newly hired social worker for an agency. As a benefit to its employees, the agency provides tuition reimbursement for professional continuing education courses offered by selected providers. Janet applied for tuition reimbursement for an approved course that was within the permitted cost limit. Janet’s supervisor denied her request for tuition reimbursement, stating that since Janet believes in “voodoo” she “won’t make a very good caseworker.” By refusing, because of Janet’s religious beliefs, to provide the tuition reimbursement to which Janet was otherwise entitled as a benefit of her employment, Janet’s supervisor has discriminated against Janet on the basis of religion in violation of Title VII.\n\nTitle VII’s prohibition on disparate treatment based on religious beliefs also can apply to disparate treatment of religious expression in the workplace.[136]\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\nReligious Expression\n\nEve is a secretary who displays a Bible on her desk at work. Xavier, a secretary in the same workplace, begins displaying a Quran on his desk at work. Their supervisor allows Eve to retain the Bible but directs Xavier to put the Quran out of view because, he states, coworkers “will think you are making a political statement, and with everything going on in the world right now we don’t need that around here.” This differential treatment of similarly situated employees with respect to the display of a religious item at work constitutes religious discrimination.[137]\n\nCharges involving religious expression may involve not only allegations of differential treatment but also of harassment and/or denial of reasonable accommodation. Investigation of allegations of harassment and denial of reasonable accommodation are addressed respectively in §§ 12-III and 12-IV of this document. As discussed in greater detail in those sections, Title VII requires employers to accommodate expression that is based on a sincerely held religious practice or belief, unless it threatens to constitute harassment[138] or poses an “undue hardship” on the conduct of the business.[139] An employer can thus restrict religious expression when it would disrupt customer service or the workplace, including when customers or coworkers would reasonably perceive it to express the employer’s own message.[140] For further discussion of how to analyze when accommodation of religious expression would pose an undue hardship, refer to the sections on Harassment at § 12-III-C and Accommodation at § 12-IV-C-6.\n\nB. Customer Preference\n\nAn employer’s action based on the discriminatory preferences of others, including coworkers or customers, is unlawful.[141]\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\nEmployment Decision Based on Customer Preference\n\nHarinder, who wears a turban as part of his Sikh religion, is hired to work at the counter in a coffee shop. A few weeks after Harinder begins working, the manager notices that the work crew from the construction site near the shop no longer comes in for coffee in the mornings. When he inquires, the crew complains that Harinder, whom they mistakenly believe is Muslim, makes them uncomfortable in light of the September 11th attacks. The manager tells Harinder that he has to let him go because the customers’ discomfort is understandable. The manager has subjected Harinder to unlawful religious discrimination by taking an adverse action based on customers’ preference not to have a cashier of Harinder’s perceived religion. Harinder’s termination based on customer preference would violate Title VII regardless of whether he was – or was misperceived to be -- Muslim, Sikh, or any other religion.\n\nC. Security Requirements\n\nIn general, an employer may adopt security requirements for its employees or applicants, provided they are adopted for nondiscriminatory reasons and are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. For example, an employer may not require Muslim applicants to undergo a background investigation or more extensive security procedures because of their religion without imposing the same requirements on similarly situated applicants who are non-Muslim.[142]\n\nD. Bona Fide Occupational Qualification\n\nTitle VII permits employers to hire and employ employees on the basis of religion if religion is “a bona fide occupational qualification [“BFOQ”] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.”[143] Religious organizations do not typically need to rely on this BFOQ defense because the “religious organization” exemption in Title VII permits them to prefer employees of a particular religion. See supra § 12-I-C-1. But for employers that are not religious organizations and seek to rely on the BFOQ defense to justify a religious preference, the defense is a narrow one and rarely successfully invoked.[144]\n\n· Employer Best Practices ·\n\nEmployers can reduce the risk of discriminatory employment decisions by establishing written objective criteria for evaluating candidates for hire or promotion and applying those criteria consistently to all candidates.\n\nIn conducting job interviews, employers can ensure nondiscriminatory treatment by asking the same questions of all applicants for a particular job or category of job and inquiring about matters directly related to the position in question.\n\nEmployers can reduce the risk of religious discrimination claims by carefully and timely recording the accurate business reasons for disciplinary or performance‑related actions and sharing these reasons with the affected employees.\n\nWhen management decisions require the exercise of subjective judgment, employers can reduce the risk of discriminatory decisions by providing training to inexperienced managers and encouraging them to consult with more experienced managers or human resources personnel when addressing difficult issues.\n\nIf an employer is confronted with customer biases, e.g., an adverse reaction to being served by an employee due to religious garb, the employer should consider engaging with and educating the customers regarding any misperceptions they may have and/or the equal employment opportunity laws.\n\n12-III HARASSMENT\n\nOverview: Religious harassment is analyzed and proved in the same manner as harassment based on other traits protected by Title VII—race, color, sex, and national origin. However, the facts of religious harassment cases may present unique considerations, especially where the alleged harassment is based on another employee’s religious practices. Such a situation may require an employer to reconcile its dual obligations to take prompt remedial action in response to alleged harassment and to accommodate certain employee religious expression.\n\nA. Prohibited Conduct\n\nAs stated, Title VII makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”[145] “[A]lthough [Title VII] mentions specific employment decisions with immediate consequences, the scope of the prohibition is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination” and “covers more than terms and conditions in the narrow contractual sense.”[146] Title VII covers “environmental claims” as well,[147] including “harassment leading to noneconomic injury,”[148] but the conduct must be “sufficiently severe or pervasive ‘to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.’”[149]\n\nB. Types of Harassment Claims\n\nThe same Title VII principle applies whether the harassment is based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.[150] Like harassment based on other protected characteristics, religious harassment can take the form of (1) outright coercion, or an economic “quid pro quo,” in which the employee is pressured or coerced to abandon, alter, or adopt a religious practice as a condition of employment;[151] or of (2) a hostile work environment, in which the employee is subjected to unwelcome, religiously based statements or conduct so severe or pervasive that the employee objectively and subjectively finds the work environment to be hostile or abusive.[152] Employer liability for harassment is discussed below in § 12-III-B.\n\n1. Religious Coercion\n\nTitle VII is violated when an employer or supervisor explicitly or implicitly coerces an employee to abandon, alter, or adopt a religious practice as a condition of receiving a job benefit or privilege or avoiding an adverse employment action.[153]\n\nEXAMPLE 15\n\nReligious Conformance Required for Promotion\n\nWamiq was raised as a Muslim but no longer practices Islam. His supervisor, Arif, is a very devout Muslim who tries to persuade Wamiq not to abandon Islam and advises him to follow the teachings of the Quran. Arif also says that if Wamiq expects to advance in the company, he should join Arif and other Muslims for weekly prayer sessions in Arif’s office. Notwithstanding this pressure to conform his religious practices in order to be promoted, Wamiq refuses to attend the weekly prayer sessions, and is subsequently denied the promotion for which he applied even though he is the most qualified. Arif’s conduct indicates that the promotion would have been granted if Wamiq had participated in the prayer sessions and had become an observant Muslim. Absent contrary evidence, the employer will be liable for harassment for conditioning Wamiq’s promotion on his adherence to Arif’s views of appropriate religious practice.[154]\n\nNot promoting Wamiq would also be actionable as disparate treatment based on religion, unless the employer could demonstrate a non-religiously based, non-pretextual reason for denying Wamiq the promotion. In addition, if Arif had made the prayer sessions mandatory and Wamiq had asked to be excused on religious grounds, Arif would have been required to excuse Wamiq from the prayer sessions as a reasonable accommodation.\n\nA claim of harassment based on coerced religious participation or non-participation, however, only arises where it was intended to make the employee conform to or abandon a religious belief or practice. By contrast, an employer would not violate Title VII if it required an employee to participate in a workplace activity that conflicts with the employee’s sincerely held religious belief if the employee does not request to be excused or if the employer demonstrates that accommodating the employee’s request to be excused would pose an undue hardship.[155] The same fact pattern may give rise to allegations of disparate treatment, harassment, and/or denial of accommodation. For example, terminating rather than accommodating an employee may give rise to allegations of both denial of accommodation and discriminatory discharge.[156] For discussion of the accommodation issue, see § 12-IV.\n\n2. Hostile Work Environment\n\nTitle VII’s prohibition against religious discrimination includes prohibiting a hostile work environment because of religion. An unlawful hostile environment based on religion can take the form of physical or verbal harassment, which would include the unwelcome imposition of beliefs or practices contrary to the employee’s religion or lack thereof. A hostile work environment is created “[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.”[157] To establish a case of religious hostile work environment harassment, an employee must show: (1) that the harassment was based on his religion; (2) that the harassment was unwelcome; (3) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment by creating an objectively and subjectively hostile or abusive work environment; and (4) that there is a basis for employer liability.[158]\n\na. Based on Religion\n\nTo support a religious harassment claim, the adverse treatment must be based on the employee’s religion.[159] While verbally harassing conduct clearly is based on religion if it has religious content, harassment can also be based on religion even if religion is not explicitly mentioned.[160]\n\nEXAMPLE 16\n\nHarassing Conduct Based on Religion – Religion Mentioned\n\nMohammed is an Indian-born Muslim employed at a car dealership. Because he takes scheduled prayer breaks during the workday and observes Muslim dietary restrictions, his coworkers are aware of his religious beliefs. Upset by the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, his coworkers and managers began making mocking comments about his religious dietary restrictions and need to pray during the workday. They repeatedly referred to him as “Taliban” or “Arab” and asked him “why don’t you just go back where you came from since you believe what you believe?” When Mohammed questioned why it was mandatory for all employees to attend a United Way meeting, his supervisor said: “This is America. That’s the way things work over here. This is not the Islamic country where you come from.” After this confrontation, the supervisor issued Mohammed a written warning stating that he “was acting like a Muslim extremist” and that the supervisor could not work with him because of his “militant stance.” This harassment is based on religion and national origin.[161]\n\nEXAMPLE 17\n\nHarassing Conduct Based on Religion – Religion Not Mentioned\n\nShoshanna is a Seventh-day Adventist whose work schedule was adjusted to accommodate her Sabbath observance, which begins at sundown each Friday. When Nicholas, the new head of Shoshanna’s department, was informed that he must accommodate her, he told a colleague that “anybody who cannot work regular hours should work elsewhere.” Nicholas then moved the regular Monday morning staff meetings to late Friday afternoon, repeatedly scheduled staff and client meetings on Friday afternoons, and often marked Shoshanna AWOL when she was not scheduled to work. In addition, Nicholas treated her differently than her colleagues by, for example, denying her training opportunities and loudly berating her with little or no provocation. Although Nicholas did not mention Shoshanna’s religion, the evidence shows that his conduct was because of Shoshanna’s need for religious accommodation, and therefore was based on religion.[162]\n\nb. Unwelcome\n\nConduct is “unwelcome” when “it is uninvited and offensive or unwanted from the standpoint of the employee.”[163] It is not necessary in every case for the harassed employee to explicitly voice objection to the conduct (e.g., to confront the alleged harasser contemporaneously) for the conduct to be deemed unwelcome. In addition, since 1993 when the Supreme Court decided Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., and added “subjective hostility” to the hostile work environment analysis, some courts have found that the analysis of “unwelcomeness” and “subjective hostility” overlap.[164] For example, where an employee is visibly upset by repeated mocking use of derogatory terms or comments about his religious beliefs or observance by a colleague, it may be evident that the conduct is unwelcome and also subjectively hostile.[165] This would stand in contrast to a situation where the same two employees were engaged in a consensual conversation that involves a spirited debate of religious views, but neither employee indicates to the other, or to the employer, that he or she is upset by it. For a discussion on reporting to the employer, see infra § 12-III‑B.\n\nThe distinction between welcome and unwelcome conduct is especially important in the religious context in situations involving proselytizing to employees who have not invited such conduct. Where a religious employee attempts to persuade another employee of the correctness of his or her belief, the conduct may or may not be welcome. When an employee expressly objects to particular religious expression, unwelcomeness is evident.[166]\n\nEXAMPLE 18\n\nUnwelcome Conduct\n\nBeth’s colleague, Bill, repeatedly talked to her at work about her prospects for salvation. For several months, she did not object and discussed the matter with him. When he persisted even after she told him that he had “crossed the line” and should stop having non-work-related conversations with her, the conduct was clearly unwelcome.[167]\n\nc. Severe or Pervasive\n\nHarassment is actionable if, as a whole, the conduct is “sufficiently severe or pervasive ‘to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.’” As the Supreme Court explained with respect to Title VII in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. at 21:\n\nConduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII violation.\n\nThus, harassing conduct based on the employee’s religion is actionable when it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively and subjectively hostile work environment. A hostile work environment claim may encompass any hostile conduct that affects the complainant’s work environment, including employer conduct that may be independently actionable. Whether a reasonable person would perceive the conduct as abusive turns on common sense and context, looking at the totality of the circumstances.[168] All of the alleged incidents must be “considered cumulatively in order to obtain a realistic view of the work environment.”[169] Relevant factors “may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.”[170] But “no single factor is required.”[171]\n\nEXAMPLE 19\n\nReasonable Person Perceives Conduct to Be Hostile\n\nThe president of Printing Corp. regularly mocked and berated an employee who asked for Sundays off to attend Mass. Although he granted the time off, the president teased the employee for refusing to look at a Playboy magazine, called him a “religious freak,” and used vulgar sexual language when speaking to or about the employee. He mocked him for “following the Pope around” and made sexual comments about the Virgin Mary. A reasonable person could perceive this to be a religiously hostile work environment.[172]\n\nTo “alter the conditions of employment,” conduct need not cause economic or psychological harm.[173] It also need not impair work performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or impede their advancement.[174] The presence of one or more of these factors would buttress the claim, but is not required. [175]\n\nHowever, Title VII is not a “‘general civility code,’” and does not render all insensitive or offensive comments, petty slights, and annoyances illegal.[176] Isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality.[177]\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\nInsensitive Comments Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment\n\nMarvin is an Orthodox Jew who was hired as a radio show host. When he started work, a coworker, Stacy, pointed to his yarmulke and asked, “Will your headset fit over that?” On a few occasions, Stacy made other remarks about the yarmulke, such as: “Nice hat. Is that a beanie?” and “Do they come in different colors?” Although the coworker’s comments about his yarmulke were insensitive, they were not, standing alone, sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment for Marvin.[178]\n\nEXAMPLE 21\n\nIsolated Comments Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment\n\nBob, a supervisor, occasionally allowed spontaneous and voluntary prayers by employees during office meetings. During one meeting, he referenced Bible passages related to “slothfulness” and “work ethics.” Amy complained that Bob’s comments and the few instances of allowing voluntary prayers during office meetings created a hostile environment. The comments did not create an actionable harassment claim. They were not severe, and because they occurred infrequently, they were not sufficiently pervasive to state a claim.[179]\n\nSeverity and pervasiveness need not both be present, and they operate inversely. The more severe the harassment, the less frequently the incidents need to recur. At the same time, incidents that may not, individually, be severe may become unlawful if they occur frequently or in proximity.[180]\n\nAlthough a single incident will seldom create an unlawfully hostile environment, it may do so if it is unusually severe, such as where it involves a physical threat.[181]\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\nOne Instance of Physically Threatening Conduct Sufficiently Severe\n\nIhsaan is a Muslim. Shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Ihsaan came to work and found the words “I’m tired of you Muslims. You’re all terrorists! We will avenge the victims!! Your life is next!” scrawled in red marker on his office door. Because of the timing of the statement and the direct physical threat, this incident, alone, is sufficiently severe to create an objectively hostile and/or abusive work environment.[182]\n\nEXAMPLE 23\n\nIsolated Practices Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment\n\nTran owns a restaurant serving Asian-fusion cuisine. The restaurant is decorated with Vietnamese art depicting scenes from traditional religious stories. Tran keeps a shrine of Buddha in the corner by the cash register and likes to play traditional Vietnamese music and chants. Linda has worked as a waitress in the restaurant for a few months and complains that she feels harassed by the religious symbols and music. As long as Tran does not discriminate on the basis of religion in his hiring or supervision of employees, the religious expression would likely not amount to practices that are severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment based on religion.\n\nEXAMPLE 24\n\nPersistent Offensive Remarks Constitute Hostile Environment\n\nBetty is a Mormon. During a disagreement regarding a joint project, a coworker, Julian, tells Betty that she doesn’t know what she is talking about and that she should “go back to Salt Lake City.” When Betty subsequently proposes a different approach to the project, Julian tells her that her suggestions are as “flaky” as he would expect from “her kind.” When Betty tries to resolve the conflict, Julian tells her that if she is uncomfortable working with him, she can either ask to be transferred, or she can “just pray about it.” Over the next six months, Julian regularly makes similar negative references to Betty’s religion. His persistent offensive remarks create a hostile environment.\n\nReligious expression that is directed at an employee can become severe or pervasive, whether or not the content is intended to be insulting or abusive. Thus, for example, persistently reiterating atheist views to a religious employee who has asked that it stop can create a hostile environment, just as persistently proselytizing to an atheist employee or an employee with different religious beliefs who has asked that it stop can create a hostile work environment. The extent to which the expression is directed at the employee bringing the Title VII claim can be relevant to determining whether or when a reasonable employee would have perceived it to be hostile.[183] That said, even conduct that is not directed at an employee can transform a work environment into a hostile or abusive one.[184]\n\nA coworker having a difference of opinion with an employee’s religious views does not establish a hostile work environment when there is no other evidence of harassment. This would include when a coworker disagrees with the religious views that an employee expresses outside of the workplace, for example on social media, when there is no evidence it is linked to the workplace.[185]\n\nEXAMPLE 25\n\nNo Hostile Environment from Comments That Are Not Abusive and Not Directed at Complaining Employee\n\nWhile eating lunch in the company cafeteria, Clarence often overhears conversations between his coworkers Dharma and Khema. Dharma, a Buddhist, is discussing meditation techniques with Khema, who is interested in Buddhism. Clarence strongly believes that meditation is an occult practice that offends him, and he complains to their supervisor that Dharma and Khema are creating a hostile environment for him. Such conversations taking place in the cafeteria do not constitute severe or pervasive religious harassment of Clarence, particularly given that they do not insult other religions and they were not directed at him.\n\nC. Employer Liability\n\nOverview: An employer is always liable for a supervisor’s harassment if it results in a tangible employment action. If the supervisor’s harassment does not result in tangible employment action, the employer may be able to avoid liability or limit damages by establishing an affirmative defense that includes two necessary elements: (a) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (b) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. An employer is liable for a coworker’s or non-employee’s harassment in two circumstances: (a) if it unreasonably failed to prevent the harassment, or (b) if it knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.\n\nAn employer will be liable for a hostile work environment that an employee endures if vicarious liability under common law agency principles is found to apply.[186] As explained more fully below, whether vicarious liability applies depends on the employment status of the harasser (i.e., a manager or coworker), whether a tangible employment action was the result of the harassment, the employer’s policies, whether the employer was aware or should have been aware of the harassment, and what action, if any, the employer took when it learned of the harassment.\n\n1. Harassment by Alter-Ego\n\nUnder agency-law principles, an employer is automatically liable for religious harassment by an agent, even if it does not result in a tangible employment action, if “the agent’s high rank in the company makes him or her the employer’s alter ego.”[187] If the harasser is of a sufficiently high rank to fall “within that class of an employer organization’s officials who may be treated as the organization’s proxy,” which would include officials such as a company president, owner, partner, or corporate officer, the harassment is automatically imputed to the employer and the employer cannot assert the affirmative defense.[188]\n\n2. Harassment by Supervisors or Managers\n\nEmployers are automatically liable for religious harassment by a supervisor with authority over a plaintiff when the harassment results in a tangible employment action such as a denial of promotion, demotion, discharge, or undesirable reassignment.[189] If the harassment by such a supervisor does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer can attempt to prove, as an affirmative defense to liability, that: (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassing behavior, and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm.[190]\n\nEXAMPLE 26\n\nSupervisory Harassment with Tangible Employment Action\n\nGeorge, a manager in an accounting firm, is an atheist who has frequently been heard to say that he thinks anyone who is deeply religious is a zealot with his own agenda and cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of the clients. George particularly ridicules Debra, a devoutly observant Jehovah’s Witness, and consistently withholds the most desirable assignments from her. He denies her request for a promotion to a more prestigious job in another division, saying that he can’t let her “spread that religious poppycock any further.” Debra files a religious harassment charge. The firm asserts in its position statement that it is not liable because Debra never made a complaint under its internal anti-harassment policy and complaint procedures. Because the harassment was by a supervisor of Debra’s and culminated in a tangible employment action (failure to promote), the employer is liable for the harassment even if it has an effective anti-harassment policy, and even if Debra never complained. If George is a “proxy” of the firm, then the firm is also liable for the harassment even in the absence of a tangible employment action. Additionally, the denial of promotion would be actionable as disparate treatment based on religion.\n\nEXAMPLE 27\n\nSupervisory Harassment Without Tangible Employment Action\n\nJennifer’s employer, XYZ, had an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure that covered religious harassment. All employees were aware of it because XYZ widely and regularly publicized it. Despite his knowledge of the policy, Jennifer’s supervisor frequently mocked her religious beliefs. When Jennifer told him that his comments bothered her, he told her that he was just kidding and she should not take everything so seriously. Jennifer never reported the supervisor’s conduct. When one of Jennifer’s coworkers eventually reported the supervisor’s harassing conduct under the employer’s antiharassment procedure, the employer promptly investigated and acted effectively to stop the supervisor’s conduct. Jennifer then filed a religious harassment charge. Because the harassment of Jennifer did not culminate in a tangible employment action, XYZ will not be liable for the harassment if it can show both that Jennifer’s failure to utilize XYZ’s available complaint mechanisms was unreasonable, and that XYZ exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the harassment. The employer should be able to make the “promptly correct” showing, because it took prompt and reasonable corrective measures once it did learn of the harassment.[191]\n\n3. Harassment by Coworkers\n\nAn employer is liable for harassment by coworkers where the employer: (1) unreasonably failed to prevent the harassment;[192] or (2) knew or should have known about the harassment, and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.[193]\n\nEXAMPLE 28\n\nHarassment by Coworkers\n\nJohn, who is a Christian Scientist, shares an office with Rick, a Mormon. Rick repeatedly tells John that he is practicing a false religion, and that he should study Mormon literature. Despite John’s protestations that he is very happy with his religion and has no desire to convert, Rick regularly leaves religious pamphlets on John’s desk and tries to talk to him about religion. After asking Rick to stop the behavior to no avail, John complains to their immediate supervisor, who dismisses John’s complaint on the ground that Rick is a nice person who believes that he is just being helpful. If the harassment continues, the employer is liable because it knew, through the supervisor, about Rick’s harassing conduct but failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.[194]\n\n4. Harassment by Non-Employees\n\nAn employer is liable for harassment by non-employees where the employer: (1) unreasonably failed to prevent the harassment; or (2) knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.[195]\n\nEXAMPLE 29\n\nHarassment by a Contractor\n\nTristan works for XYZ, a contractor that manages Crossroads Corporation’s mail room. When Tristan delivers the mail to Julia, the Crossroads receptionist, he gives her religious tracts, attempts to convert her to his religion, tells her that her current religious beliefs will lead her to Hell, and persists even after she tells him to stop. Julia reports Tristan’s conduct to her supervisor, who tells her that he cannot do anything because Tristan does not work for Crossroads. If the harassment continues, the supervisor’s failure to act is likely to subject Crossroads to liability because Tristan’s conduct is severe or pervasive and based on religion, and Crossroads failed to take corrective action within its control after Julia reported the harassment. Options available to Julia’s supervisor or the appropriate individual in the supervisor’s chain of command might include initiating a meeting with Tristan and XYZ management regarding the harassment and demanding that it cease, that appropriate disciplinary action be taken if it continues, and/or that a different mail carrier be assigned to Julia’s route.\n\nD. Special Considerations for Employers When Balancing Anti-Harassment and Accommodation Obligations With Respect to Religious Expression\n\nWhile some employees believe that religion is intensely personal and private, others are open about sharing or outwardly expressing their religion. In addition, there are employees who may believe that they have a religious obligation to share their views and to try to persuade coworkers of the truth of their religious beliefs, i.e., to proselytize. Certain private employers, too, whether or not they are religious organizations, may wish to express their religious views and share their religion with their employees.[196] As noted above, however, some employees may perceive proselytizing or other religious expression as unwelcome based on their own religious beliefs and observances, or lack thereof. In an increasingly pluralistic society, the mix of divergent beliefs and practices can give rise to conflicts requiring employers to balance the rights of employers and employees who wish to express their religious beliefs with the rights of other employees to be free from religious harassment under the foregoing Title VII harassment standards.\n\nAs discussed in more detail in § IV-C-6 of this document, an employer never has to accommodate expression of a religious belief in the workplace where such an accommodation could potentially constitute harassment of coworkers, because that would pose an undue hardship for the employer.[197] Nor does Title VII require an employer to accommodate an employee’s desire to impose his religious beliefs upon his coworkers.[198] Therefore, while Title VII requires employers to accommodate an employee’s sincerely held religious belief in engaging in religious expression (e.g. proselytizing) in the workplace, an employer does not have to allow such expression if it imposes an undue hardship on the operation of the business. For example, it would be an undue hardship for an employer to accommodate proselytizing by an employee if the proselytizing had adverse effects on employee morale or workplace productivity.\n\nBecause employers are responsible for maintaining a nondiscriminatory work environment, they can be held liable for perpetrating or tolerating religious harassment of their employees. An employer can reduce the chance that employees will engage in conduct that rises to the level of unlawful harassment by implementing an anti-harassment policy and an effective procedure for reporting, investigating, and correcting harassing conduct.[199] Even if the policy does not prevent all such conduct, it could limit the employer’s liability where the employee does not report conduct rising to the level of illegal harassment.\n\nHowever, “[d]iscussion of religion in the workplace is not illegal.”[200] In fact, Title VII violations may result if an employer tries to avoid potential coworker objections to employee religious expression by preemptively banning all religious communications in the workplace or discriminating against unpopular religious views, since Title VII requires that employers not discriminate based on religion and that they reasonably accommodate employees’ sincerely held religious observances, practices, and beliefs as long as accommodation poses no undue hardship.[201]\n\n· Employer Best Practices ·\n\nEmployers should have a well-publicized and consistently applied anti-harassment policy that: (1) covers religious harassment; (2) clearly explains what is prohibited; (3) describes procedures for bringing harassment to management’s attention; and (4) contains an assurance that complainants will be protected against retaliation. The procedures should include a complaint mechanism that includes multiple avenues for complaint; prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations; and prompt and appropriate corrective action.\n\nEmployers should encourage managers to intervene proactively and discuss whether particular religious expression is welcome if the manager believes the expression is likely to be construed as unwelcome to a reasonable person.\n\nEmployers should allow religious expression among employees at least to the same extent that they allow other types of personal expression that are not harassing or disruptive to the operation of the business.[202]\n\nOnce an employer is on notice that religious expression by an employee is unwelcome to another employee, the employer should investigate and, if appropriate, take steps to ensure that the expression in question does not become sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.\n\nIf harassment is perpetrated by a non-employee assigned by a contractor, vendor, or client, the supervisor or other appropriate individual in the impacted employee’s chain of command should initiate a meeting with the contractor, vendor, or client regarding the harassment and require that it cease, that appropriate disciplinary action be taken if it continues, and/or that a different individual be assigned.\n\nTo prevent conflicts from escalating to the level of a Title VII violation, employers should immediately intervene when they become aware of objectively abusive or insulting conduct, even absent a complaint.\n\nWhile supervisors are permitted to engage in certain religious expression, they should avoid expression that might – due to their supervisory authority – reasonably be perceived by subordinates as coercive, even when not so intended.\n\n· Employee Best Practices ·\n\nWhere they feel comfortable doing so, employees who find harassing workplace religious conduct directed at them unwelcome should inform the individual engaging in the conduct that they wish it to stop. If the conduct does not stop, employees should report it to their supervisor or other appropriate company official in accordance with the procedures established in the company’s anti-harassment policy.\n\nEmployees who do not wish personally to confront an individual who is engaging in unwelcome religious or anti-religious conduct should report the conduct to their supervisor or other appropriate company official in accordance with the company’s anti-harassment policy.\n\n12-IV REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION\n\nOverview: Title VII requires an employer, once on notice, to reasonably accommodate an employee whose sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance conflicts with a work requirement, unless providing the accommodation would create an undue hardship.[203] The Title VII “undue hardship” defense is defined differently than the “undue hardship” defense for disability accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Title VII’s undue hardship defense to providing religious accommodation has been defined by the Supreme Court as requiring a showing that the proposed accommodation in a particular case poses “more than a de minimis” cost or burden. This is a lower standard for an employer to meet than undue hardship under the ADA, which is defined in that statute as “an action requiring significant difficulty or expense.”[204]\n\n“Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.”[205] An individual alleging the denial of a religious accommodation is generally seeking an adjustment to a neutral work rule that infringes on the employee’s ability to practice his religion.[206] “The accommodation requirement is ‘plainly intended to relieve individuals of the burden of choosing between their jobs and their religious convictions, where such relief will not unduly burden others.’”[207]\n\nA. Religious Accommodation\n\nA religious accommodation is an adjustment to the work environment that will allow the employee to comply with his or her religious beliefs. An employer need not provide a reasonable accommodation if doing so would cause undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business, which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean an accommodation that would require the employer to bear more than a de minimis cost or burden.[208] The employer’s duty to accommodate will usually entail making a special exception from, or adjustment to, the particular requirement that creates a conflict so that the employee or applicant will be able to observe or practice his or her religion. Accommodation requests often relate to work schedules, dress and grooming, or religious expression or practice while at work.[209] The Commission’s position is that the denial of reasonable religious accommodation absent undue hardship is actionable even if the employee has not separately suffered an independent adverse employment action, such as being disciplined, demoted, or discharged as a consequence of being denied accommodation.[210] This is because requiring him to work without religious accommodation where a work rule conflicts with his religious beliefs necessarily alters the terms and conditions of his employment for the worse.[211] However, the courts are split on this question.[212]\n\n1. Notice of the Conflict Between Religion and Work\n\nEmployers need not provide an accommodation unless they are on notice that one is needed for religious purposes.[213] Typically, the employer will advise the applicant or employee of its policies or a particular work requirement, and in response the applicant or employee will indicate that an accommodation is needed for religious reasons. In some instances, even absent an applicant’s or employee’s request, the employer will be on notice that the observance or practice is religious and conflicts with a work policy, and therefore that accommodation is or could be needed.[214] In such circumstances, it would violate Title VII for an employer to fail to provide a reasonable accommodation unless it proves that doing so would pose an undue hardship.[215]\n\nIn addition, even in the absence of any notice that a religious accommodation is needed, an employer violates Title VII if it takes an adverse action against an applicant or employee (such as failing to hire) based on its belief that the applicant or employee might need a reasonable religious accommodation, unless the employer proves that such an accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship.[216]\n\nWhen requesting accommodation, the applicant or employee need not use any “magic words,” such as “religious accommodation” or “Title VII.” The employer must have enough information to make the employer aware that there exists a conflict between the applicant’s or employee’s religious observance, practice, or belief and a requirement for applying for or performing the job.[217] If the employer reasonably needs more information, the employer and the applicant or employee should discuss the request. The applicant or employee may need to explain the religious nature of the belief, observance, or practice at issue, and cannot assume that the employer will already know or understand it.[218] Similarly, the employer should not assume that a request is invalid simply because it is based on religious beliefs or practices with which the employer is unfamiliar, but should ask the applicant or employee to explain the religious nature of the practice and the way in which it conflicts with a work requirement. In determining if a conflict exists, it is irrelevant that the employer does not view the work requirement as implicating a religious belief, or that most people of the applicant’s or employee’s faith would not; it is the applicant’s or employee’s own religious beliefs that are relevant.[219]\n\nEXAMPLE 30\n\nFailure to Advise Employer That Request Is Due to Religious Practice or Belief\n\nJim agreed to take his employer’s drug test but was terminated because he refused to sign the accompanying consent form. After his termination, Jim filed a charge alleging that the employer failed to accommodate his religious objection to swearing an oath. Until it received notice of the charge, the employer did not know that Jim’s refusal to sign the form was based on his religious beliefs. Because the employer was not notified of the conflict at the time Jim refused to sign the form, or at any time prior to Jim’s termination, it did not have an opportunity to offer to accommodate him. The employer has not violated Title VII.[220]\n\n2. Discussion of Request\n\nAlthough an employer is not required by Title VII to conduct a discussion with an employee before making a determination on an accommodation request, as a practical matter it can be important to do so. Both the employer and the employee have roles to play in resolving an accommodation request. In addition to placing the employer on notice of the need for accommodation, the employee should cooperate with the employer’s efforts to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be granted. Once the employer becomes aware of the employee’s religious conflict, the employer should obtain promptly whatever additional information is needed to determine whether a reasonable accommodation is available without posing an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.[221] This typically involves the employer and employee mutually sharing information necessary to process the accommodation request. Employer‑employee cooperation and flexibility are key to the search for a reasonable accommodation. If the accommodation solution is not immediately apparent, the employer should discuss the request with the employee to determine what accommodations might be effective. If the employer requests additional information reasonably needed to evaluate the request, the employee should provide it.\n\nFailure to confer with the employee is not an independent violation of Title VII. But as a practical matter, such failure can have adverse legal consequences. For example, in some cases where an employer has made no effort to act on an accommodation request, courts have found that the employer lacked the evidence needed to meet its burden of proof to establish that the plaintiff’s proposed accommodation would actually have posed an undue hardship.[222]\n\nLikewise, employees should cooperate with an employer’s requests for reasonable information. For example, if an employee requested a schedule change to accommodate daily prayers, the employer might need to ask for information about the religious observance, such as the time and duration of the daily prayers, in order to determine if accommodation can be granted without posing an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business. Moreover, even if the employer does not grant the employee’s preferred accommodation but instead provides a reasonable alternative accommodation, the employee must cooperate by attempting to meet his religious needs through the employer’s proposed accommodation if possible.[223]\n\nWhere the accommodation request itself does not provide enough information to enable the employer to make a determination, and the employer has a bona fide doubt as to the basis for the accommodation request, it is entitled to make a limited inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the employee’s claim that the belief or practice at issue is religious and sincerely held, and that the belief or practice gives rise to the need for the accommodation.[224] Whether an employer has a reasonable basis for seeking to verify the employee’s stated beliefs will depend on the facts of a particular case.\n\nEXAMPLE 31\n\nSincerity of Religious Belief Questioned\n\nBob, who had been a dues-paying member of the CDF union for fourteen years, had a work-related dispute with a union official and one week later asserted that union activities were contrary to his religio"
