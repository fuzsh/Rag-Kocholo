For years, he questioned his life and struggled with depression and addiction in his hometown of Philadelphia until he found a deep connection and purpose with music. Creating music became his therapy and healthy outlet to express himself. Able hopes his music can now inspire and help others.\n\nAble won the show SONGLAND on NBC and worked with Ryan Tedder and Ester Dean to create the Jonas Brothers’ hit song \"GREENLIGHT\" which was #1 on the billboard charts.\n\nAble's single Whisper went viral trending #2 on Canada, Norway, South Africa and Ukraine \"Spotify Top 50 Viral\" and TikTok with over 100,000,000 plays and over 100,000 user created videos and 4 million views on YouTube.

In his decade-long career, he has released five albums and played over 1000 shows. Citing main influences such as Randy Newman and Janet Jackson, his songs often combine catchy melodies with dark and satirical lyrics. Combining catchy melodies with dark and satirical lyrics, one has to be careful not to slip while dancing in a puddle of their own tears.\n\nThere was a time when Caleb hated being mistaken for his mother when answering the land-line, but it worked out for him in the end, setting him apart with his high, androgynous vocals. He forms authentic connections with an air of openness, soulful singalongs and untethered guitar work drawing comparisons from Prince to Robin Williams.\n\nHe has 5 full length albums out to date, most which were written & produced in his 5x10 storage-unit-turned-studio, where he works alongside a black market DVD burning entrepreneur named Fred.\n\n--\n\n4:15 How are you able to balance a two and three year old with your music career?\n\n7:30 What would you describe your current fan base?\n\n12:00 Collaborations\n\n17:45 'Preshow Music' release\n\n28:00 Preview 'Someone who makes you happy'\n\n29:00 Running Ads for Music Promotion\n\n38:00 What do you want to be known for?\n\n--\n\nConnect with Caleb\n\nhttps://www.calebhawley.com/\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoy the podcast, would you please consider leaving a 5 star review on Apple Podcasts/iTunes?
