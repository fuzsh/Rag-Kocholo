(2024). Screening Accuracy of BMI for Adiposity Among 8- to 19-Year-Olds. Pediatrics. 154. 10.1542/peds.2024-065960. Published: March 2024\n\nReviewer: Wilma de Guzman-Bato, MD, DPPS, DPCMNP; Pediatrician; Adult and Pediatric Medical Nutrition Specialist; Medical Officer IV – Department of Pediatrics, Batangas Medical Center\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Overweight and obesity are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health”. They are part of the triple burden of malnutrition affecting children around the Philippines. Obesity puts children and adolescents at risk for serious short- and long-term adverse health outcomes later in life, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nThe Expanded National Nutrition Survey conducted by the Department of Science and Technology – Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) in 2019 reported that nearly one in 10 children, aged 5 to 10 years old and 10 to 19 years old respectively, are overweight. Its prevalence among Filipino adolescents significantly increased from 11.6 percent (%) in 2018 to 13 percent (%) in 2021.\n\nMeasuring Body Mass Index (BMI) and assessing weight classification is a screening step that allows the pediatrician or other healthcare workers to initiate obesity evaluation. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has acknowledged criticisms that BMI cannot distinguish between fat and lean mass. This study reinforces the use of BMI as the most appropriate clinical tool to screen for excess adiposity and make the clinical diagnosis of overweight or obesity.\n\nSummary: BMI is based only on weight and height, which can be a poor indicator of adiposity among those with normal or relatively low adiposity. The limitations of BMI, such as its inability (1) to distinguish between fat and lean mass, and (2) to characterize body fat distribution, have been recognized. The study evaluated the relationship between BMI and adiposity within a contemporary cohort of 6928 8- to 19-year-olds in the United States using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. A key finding is that the combination of age and BMI predicts the vast majority (90%–94%) of the variability in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) -measured fat mass and lean mass indexed to height within each sex.\n\nAlthough BMI ≥95th percentile is associated with both increased adiposity and increased lean mass, the likelihood of increased adiposity was about twice as high as the likelihood of increased lean mass. Participants with a BMI ≥ CDC 95th percentile were 29 times more likely to have a high FMI than participants with lower BMIs. It was noted that the association between elevated BMI and increased adiposity is very strong for youth with BMI ≥95th percentile, but is not for youth with lower BMIs, including in the overweight range (BMI 90th percentile). Sex differences in the pattern of lean versus adipose tissue accretion over puberty are also redemonstrated in their analysis, where a steady increase in the fat mass index is seen only in girls across the entire age range studied, whereas a near-linear increase in lean mass index over this age range is seen only in boys.\n\nDXA scans which is considered as a gold standard for body composition were acquired – this is one of the strengths of the study including the evaluation across the full BMI/adiposity spectrum, and inclusion of practical screening characteristics to describe associations between BMI ≥95th percentile and body composition. Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional study design, exclusion of children <8 years of age, and lack of data on regional distribution of adiposity. Several alternatives have been proposed, and many focus on waist circumference (WC). However, WC has its limitations too – it is challenging to standardize WC measurement across health care providers, it is difficult to measure WC among individuals with high BMIs, and the optimal cut points for a high waist are uncertain. Despite its limitations, a high BMI is a very good screening tool for identifying children and adolescents with elevated adiposity.1\n\nCommentary: Obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disorder among children and adolescents throughout the world.2 Among Filipino children aged 5 to 10, overweight rates increased significantly from 10.4% in 2019 to 14% in 2022, and among adolescents aged 10 to 19, it increased from 10.7% in 2019 to 13% in 2022.3 Being underweight, overweight, or obese during childhood and adolescence is associated with adverse health consequences throughout the life-course. In particular, overweight and obesity are global health problems contributing to an increasing noncommunicable disease burden. Obesity, in addition to having disease-specific effects, may accelerate the rate of aging affecting all aspects of physiology and thus shortening life and health span.4\n\nWithin this context, as a Pediatrician and a Medical Nutrition Physician, I do think that there is really a need to track obesity across the lifespan which underscores the importance of primary and secondary prevention and treatment efforts early in life. These efforts include evaluating for obesity using BMI; identifying children and adolescents at high risk; providing or referring to evidence-based obesity treatments for children, youth, and their families.5 In our country, especially in a government setting, DXA is not available, expensive and difficult to implement. In clinical practice, BMI is frequently used as both a screening and diagnostic tool for detecting excess body fat because of its ease of use and low cost. BMI is a validated proxy measure of underlying adiposity that is replicable and can track weight status in children and adolescents.5 This study reminds us that a standardized use of BMI to identify patients with obesity is a first step. Additional risk stratification for how a specific BMI affects an individual’s health should be patient-centered and include additional data from the history and diagnostic testing. Further, treatment goals should be focused on health and quality-of-life outcomes, as opposed to a number or percentile on a growth chart.\n\nReferences:\n\nJaime M. Moore, Stephen R.

Comparison of Answers between ChatGPT and Human Dieticians to Common Nutrition Questions. Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism. 2023;2023:e5548684. doi:10.1155/2023/5548684\n\nReviewer: Bradley R. Salonen, MD, Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: The landscape of medicine is increasingly influenced by technological advancements, among which the emergence of ChatGPT, a versatile chatbot developed by OpenAI, stands out.1 Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT rapidly gained prominence due to its ability to perform a wide range of tasks, both personal and professional, thanks to its large language model (LLM) foundation. Its user-friendly interface, coupled with the availability of a free plan, led ChatGPT to become the most rapidly adopted consumer software application in history.2\n\nThis paper is important in its investigation of ChatGPT's proficiency in responding to nutrition-related inquiries, benchmarking its performance against that of human dieticians. With an ever-growing dependency on the internet as a source of nutritional advice, assessing the dependability and accuracy of information provided by AI becomes increasingly vital. The outcomes of this study bear significant implications for the manner in which individuals seek out nutritional knowledge and for the prospective contribution of AI in enhancing public health and nutritional education initiatives.\n\nSummary: Conducted in the Netherlands from February to June 2023, this study leveraged ChatGPT (version 3.0) to compare its efficacy in answering nutrition questions against that of human dieticians. The research involved soliciting common nutrition-related queries from registered dieticians across the Netherlands, resulting in a total of 20 questions submitted by 7 dieticians. The participating dieticians, all of whom were female with a median age of 31 and an age range of 29 to 65, practiced in various settings including private practices and medical centers.\n\nThe study focused on eight selected questions, with the remaining 12 excluded due to their specificity to medical conditions. These questions covered a spectrum of themes such as weight loss, taste, carbohydrates, general healthy nutrition, and supplementation.\n\nThe responses provided by both ChatGPT and the human dieticians were assessed by a panel of other dieticians and experts in field of the questions. The grading was based on three key criteria: scientific correctness, comprehensibility, and actionability. Each response was graded both as a whole and across these individual components. To determine statistical significance and detect any group differences in the responses, a permutation test was employed.\n\nChatGPT outperformed human dieticians in several aspects, scoring significantly higher in 5 out of the 8 questions overall. In terms of scientific correctness and comprehensibility, ChatGPT also scored higher in 5 out of the 8 questions. For actionability, it scored higher in 4 out of the 8 questions. Notably, human dieticians did not achieve higher overall scores for any question, nor did they lead in any of the individual grading components.\n\nIn summary, this study highlights the potential of AI tools like ChatGPT in providing accurate and understandable nutrition information, challenging the traditional boundaries of dietary consultation and suggesting new frontiers for AI application in the field of nutrition and dietetics.\n\nCommentary: This study represents an evaluation of the evolving capabilities of AI tools in the realm of nutritional advice. With the introduction of ChatGPT and the advancement with GPT-4 LLM, we witness a significant enhancement in the ability of these AI models to handle a variety of medical-related tasks. A remarkable aspect of these modern LLM chatbots is their extensive breadth of knowledge, attributed to training on vast datasets. There is potential for even greater advancements through domain-specific fine-tuning of these models, tailoring them more closely to specialized fields like nutrition.\n\nHowever, amidst the surge of enthusiasm surrounding AI, we must maintain a balanced perspective.3 Like humans, the outputs of generative models are not infallible. These systems are prone to errors and can produce 'hallucinations,' or inaccuracies, in their responses. This inherent imperfection underscores the continuing necessity for human oversight and intervention in AI applications, especially in areas like healthcare and medicine.4\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond the technical achievements of AI. It prompts a broader conversation about the role of AI in supplementing human expertise, particularly in providing accessible and accurate health information to the public. While AI tools like ChatGPT demonstrate promising potential in enhancing public health education, their limitations highlight the indispensable value of human professionals in ensuring the quality and reliability of health-related advice. As AI continues to evolve, the synergy between human knowledge and artificial intelligence will be pivotal in harnessing the full benefits of technological advancements in healthcare.\n\nReferences:\n\nLi R, Kumar A, Chen JH.

Evaluation and Management of Iron Deficiency in Children Undergoing Intestinal Rehabilitation-A Position Paper From the NASPGHAN Intestinal Rehabilitation Special Interest Group . J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2023 May 1;76(5):672-683. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003736. Epub 2023 Feb 16. PMID: 36800275.\n\nReviewer: Jaclyn Strauss, MD, PhD, FRCPC. University of Calgary and Alberta Children’s Hospital. Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutrient deficiency in children with intestinal failure (IF) and short bowel syndrome (SBS) undergoing intestinal rehabilitation (IR), with an estimated prevalence of 20% to 87%. As a result of advances in care, children with IF are now surviving through childhood and given that ID has been demonstrated to have considerable negative long-term consequences on growth, immune function, and neurocognitive development (1-3), the ability to effectively identify and treat ID in children with IF is increasingly important.\n\nDue to the coexistence of systemic inflammation along with other nutritional deficiencies and the low specificity for detecting ID by routinely available laboratory tests, diagnosis of ID is difficult in this population. Additionally, treatment is challenging due to the lack of poor oral tolerance and/or absorption of oral iron supplementation and the role of newer parenteral iron formulations in this patient population is unclear. Thus, there is a need for an improved understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ID in children with IF.\n\nSummary: This is a position paper from the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Intestinal Rehabilitation Special Interest Group. This group is composed of gastroenterologists, surgeons and dietitians who specialize in the care of children with IF. The aim of this paper is to provide recommendations for surveillance, diagnosis, and management of ID in children with IF undergoing IR. The authors reviewed all relevant literature through December 31, 2021. The literature and expert opinions were discussed and consensus for specific recommendations required 75% agreement among the authors.\n\nChildren with IF are uniquely at risk for ID due to prematurity, inadequate iron intake and absorption, and increased blood loss. The presence of pediatric feeding disorder, which may be characterized by limited intake and/or tolerance of iron rich foods, as well as the routine absence of iron supplementation in parental nutrition (PN), may contribute to inadequate iron intake. Absorption of enteral iron may be limited by competitive inhibition at mucosal enterocyte transporters by concomitant supplementation of copper, zinc or calcium, as well as high levels of hepcidin as a result of an inflammatory state secondary to intestinal or systemic inflammation and/or infection, or chronic kidney disease. Altered intestinal motility, jejunal tube feeding past the duodenum and the use of acid suppressing medications can also contribute to inadequate iron absorption. Finally, blood loss due to frank or occult bleeding from anastomotic ulcers, bowel inflammation, gastric ulcers, varices and erosions at staple lines from serial transverse enteroplasty also puts these children at risk for ID. Multiple etiologies may and often do coexist in these children, further complicating diagnosis.\n\nChildren undergoing IR should be screened for ID every 3-6 months based on CBC, serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, serum iron and total iron binding capacity. A CRP is also recommended given that SF is an acute phase reactant. The authors provide an algorithm based on these widely available lab tests to classify iron status and recommends classifying children into 3 categories: 1) children without ID; 2) children with ID without anemia; and 3) children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Screening for vitamin B12, copper and zinc status as well as thalassemia and referral to hematology should be considered for those based on anatomic risk and poor response to therapy. Similarly, endoscopy should be reserved for children with poor response to enteral iron or concerns of GI bleeding or inflammation.\n\nEnteral or IV iron supplementation is recommended for children undergoing IR without ID who have minimal enteral intake, with monitoring of iron status (deficiency vs overload) every 3-6 months. Enteral supplementation is also recommended in children with ID without anemia while reserving IV iron supplementation for those children with poor enteral tolerance or poor response to enteral iron. Treatment response should be assessed every 3-6 months. Finally, in children with IDA, parenteral iron is recommended to correct the iron deficit followed by enteral or parenteral iron maintenance, assessing response every 1-3 months. There is insufficient evidence to support dietary enrichment alone for treatment of ID.\n\nForms of enteral iron supplementation may include ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate or ferrous fumarate at 3 mg/Kg/day for prevention of ID and 4-6 mg/Kg/day for treatment of ID. Higher dosing of 4-6 mg/Kg/day for prevention and 10 mg/Kg/day for treatment, may be required. Administering enteral iron every other day may improve tolerance and absorption. Parenteral iron formulations and comparison of cost is discussed. There are currently 4 IV iron formulations approved for use in children in the U.S: iron sucrose (IS), low molecular weight dextran (LMWID), ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and sodium ferric gluconate complex (FG). FCM and LMWID are released more slowly and allow for larger doses in a single infusion. Packed red blood cells should be reserved for those with symptomatic anemia and intentionally limited in those with risk for organ transplantation due to concerns of sensitization.\n\nThe authors highlight that the addition of iron to PN is not routinely practiced in North America and while the most recent American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition PN micronutrient consensus statement warns clinicians to be aware of possible stability issues and complications with iron supplementation in PN, this varies from recent ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN guidelines (4,5). European guidelines do suggest iron may be added to PN in many circumstances and tested for stability.\n\nCommentary: This is the first position paper to specifically address iron deficiency in children with intestinal failure undergoing intestinal rehabilitation. It provides an improved understanding of the risks and pathophysiology of ID specific to this patient population. It also highlights the diagnostic challenges and makes recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, classification, and treatment of iron deficiency with or without anemia in this medically complex and nutritionally vulnerable population. The IR Special Interest Group outlines and compares the available enteral and parenteral iron supplementation options, including dose and cost considerations. It also highlights variation in practices and recommendations between North America and Europe regarding the addition of iron to PN.\n\nThe recommendations made in this position paper will permit alignment of practices across pediatric IR centers. This will enable a more cohesive evaluation of outcomes on a larger scale, which may drive improvement in management of ID and ultimately result in improved long-term outcomes in these medically vulnerable children.\n\nReferences:\n\nSoliman AT, De Sanctis V, Kalra S.

Although parenteral nutrition (PN) is considered to be the first line of treatment, enteral nutrition (EN) plays a vital role in intestinal adaptation, cholestasis prevention, and maintenance of a healthy microbiota. However, SBS can lead to complications independent of the mode of nutrient administration, owing to the nature of the involved intestinal functional loss in the background of increasing nutritional demands.\n\nThere are limited randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of different modalities for SBS management in childhood. Their heterogenous results, together with differing expert opinions, make it difficult for clinicians to come up with best practices. There is a need to review current available evidence on SBS in order to guide clinical management, while preventing the associated complications, as well as improve physiological intestinal adaptation, eventually wean from PN, and support adequate growth.\n\nSummary: This is a position paper by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) on nutrition and intestinal rehabilitation of children with SBS based on a systematic literature review. It aims to provide evidence based recommendations and practice points for pediatric patients with small intestinal resection who are at risk of developing SBS-IF requiring PN and eventual home parenteral nutrition (HPN) support. 205 articles were included for final selection and references were reviewed individually, with recommendations decided upon by voting in which a consensus of at least 90% was required. These were then rephrased until all authors agree with the final version for publication.\n\nAfter surgery, patients undergo major metabolic stress and the expected response differs depending on the postoperative phases. These can be differentiated into early acute (first 24–48 hours), late acute or intermediate postoperative (first week after surgery), and recovery or late postoperative (from first week until discharge from intensive care). During the early acute phase, fluid management and resuscitation are essential, with the need to calculate fluid and electrolyte requirements considering residual intestinal anatomy, presence of stoma, and levels of intestinal losses, while monitoring weight and urinary sodium sediment. PN should supply energy in the form of glucose under tight glycemic control, with the goal of exclusively maintaining physiologic state. In the intermediate postoperative phase, lipid as energy source should be supplied as part of PN, with composite intravenous lipid emulsions containing fish oil in patients for prolonged PN. Energy provision should be gradually increased considering enteral intake and intestinal malabsorption. Urine sodium levels should be monitored daily, maintaining the level at >20 mmol/L, while exceeding urinary potassium (NaU/KU >1) in patients who are not in diuretics. In the late postoperative phase, cycling PN should be initiated in all stable patients over 4 kg. Energy intake should be adjusted, taking into account cumulative deficits, tissue repair, and catch-up growth, while screening for micronutrient deficiency.\n\nFeeding through the enteral route also plays a vital role and should be initiated as soon as possible, with oral feeding being the preferred route of administration. In cases where oral route is not possible, enteral tube feeding can be done, although there is a lack of evidence as to which is better between continuous and intermittent tube feeding. Human milk is the first line option and polymeric formula can be used in its absence. If both are not tolerated, extensively hydrolyzed formulas (EHF) are recommended as they are well tolerated and provide short peptides. The amount of feed to be given should be based on stoma output per day and surveillance of feeding tolerance should be assessed using multifactorial clinical evaluation of abdominal distension, vomiting, and stool output. Increasing the enteral feeds at 10–20 mL/kg/day may be attempted if stool output is <20–50 mL/kg/day or 6–10 stool/day.\n\nSince SBS and IF are chronic conditions, HPN should be considered in patients expected to require PN for more than 12 weeks as it has been demonstrated to be associated with less IF-related complications and better quality of life. Parents and/or caregivers should be trained on how to manage central venous catheters (CVC) and PN within a structured HPN program, including the use of antiseptic locks. Prior to discharge, it is essential that those who would undergo HPN should have a secure CVC, stable fluid and electrolyte needs, and should tolerate PN infusion breaks.\n\nCommentary: This is the latest position paper summarizing key practice points and recommendations for the nutritional management of SBS based on current available evidence and expert opinion. The recommendations on PN are mainly divided into different phases in relation to expected physiologic changes. This is in conjunction with the division of treatment phases from time of surgery in critically ill neonates in which nutritional support is recommended to be adjusted based on the level of metabolic stress response and hepatic transition to anabolic protein metabolism when growth reoccurs, while avoiding overfeeding during the early catabolic phase of illness and underfeeding during recovery2. EN is likewise emphasized with immediate establishment of enteral feeding similar to ASPEN recommendations in pediatric SBS with some differences including the feed of choice3. ESPGHAN suggests polymeric formula as the second choice instead of EHF, noting that the former has higher concentration and higher long chain triglyceride content which improves intestinal adaptation. HPN was also noted as an integral part of management as it was shown to improve outcomes in those requiring prolonged PN support4. Although successful weaning from HPN is possible, the paper emphasizes caution to prevent HPN related complications such as central-catheter-related complications, IF-associated liver disease, and mortality5.\n\nAlthough this position paper establishes clear guidelines on the nutrition support in pediatric SBS, the quality of evidence is difficult to assess due to the differences in types of studies involved, most of which were retrospective cohort studies. There is need for more studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, to ascertain the quality of recommendations. Newer studies with longer follow-ups, including those involved in HPN, are necessary to determine the long term effects of these recommendations, as SBS and IF are considered to be chronic diseases which are at risk for more complications over time.\n\nReferences:\n\nMerritt RJ, Cohran V, Raphael BP, Sentongo T, Volpert D, Warner, BW, Goday, PS, & Nutrition Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.

Division of Gastroenterology, Cleveland, Ohio\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Plant-based dietary trends are escalating, encompassing various forms: 1) vegan diets, excluding all animal products; 2) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, eliminating meats while allowing eggs and dairy; 3) pescatarian diets, primarily vegetarian but permitting seafood; 4) whole-foods, plant-based diets (WFPB), akin to veganism but emphasizing health, abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low fat; and 5) flexitarian diets, primarily vegetarian but occasionally incorporating meat, dairy, and seafood1. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses affirm the plant-based diet's potential benefits, including mitigating type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature deaths2.\n\nHowever, deficiencies in certain micronutrients like calcium and vitamin D, primarily sourced from animal products, heighten bone resorption in plant-based diets. Our aging society faces rising osteoporosis and related fractures, leading to heavier economic burdens. Therefore, essential aspects of a plant-based diet involve fortified foods, appropriate choices, and/or supplements, particularly calcium and vitamin D, to reduce osteoporosis risks. Notably, the research's strength lies in its substantial sample size from population-based random cluster selection, enabling broader representation and application to the population.\n\nSummary: This cross-sectional study utilized U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data spanning a decade across five 2-year cycles (2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2013–2014, and 2017–2018). Its aim was to assess the potential relationship between plant-based dietary indexes and osteopenia/osteoporosis within the U.S. adult population. Dietary intake data were collected via two NHANES 24-hour recall interviews and converted to food equivalents in the food-pattern-equivalence database.\n\nThe study categorized plant-based dietary patterns into three indexes: the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI). These were determined based on the intake of 15 food groups, encompassing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, tea/coffee, fruit juices, refined grains, potatoes, sugar, animal fat, dairy, eggs, seafood, and meat. Each index comprised 15 domains with scores assigned based on positive or reverse diet types.\n\nThe primary outcome assessed the association between bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) loss, measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry densitometry, and the three plant-based diet indexes. A multinomial logistic regression model estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\nAmong the 16,085 patients analyzed, 11,454 (71.2%) were aged 20–65, and 8,238 (51.22%) were female. The majority (71.9%) had a body mass index of at least 25. Patients were categorized into three groups: normal BMD, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. These groups differed in characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, smoking history, physical activity, co-morbidities, and types of plant-based diet indexes.\n\nRegarding the primary outcome, the Spearman correlation coefficients indicated a weak negative correlation between hPDI and BMD T scores (r = −0.17; p < 0.001), while PDI (r = −0.09) and uPDI (r = 0.03) showed negligible correlations with BMD T scores. A comparative analysis revealed a notably stronger correlation between hPDI and BMD T scores compared to the other two associations.\n\nMultinomial logistic regression demonstrated that higher quintiles for both hPDI and PDI were positively associated with osteopenia compared to participants in the lowest quintile (ORQ5 vs. Q1 = 1.50, ORQ5 vs. Q1 = 1.48, respectively). Additionally, the highest uPDI was positively linked to osteoporosis. The study highlighted a detrimental association between PDI and hPDI with osteopenia, and a harmful association between uPDI and osteoporosis.\n\nSensitivity analysis underscored robust associations between plant-based dietary indexes and osteopenia/osteoporosis across most subgroups.\n\nMoreover, the study examined the independent associations of 15 individual food items with different BMD statuses. Among these items, nuts were associated with increased odds of osteopenia, while vegetables, refined grains, animal fat, eggs, and meat were identified as protective factors for bone health status.\n\nCommentary: This study corroborates previous meta-analyses, highlighting plant-based diets' adverse impact on bone density3,4. The EPIC-Oxford cohort, comprising 65,000 vegetarians and vegans, exhibited a higher fracture risk than meat-eaters5. The mechanism involves low calcium and vitamin D in plants, directly affecting bone health. Additionally, higher uPDI correlated with reduced osteocalcin levels, impacting bone formation and remodeling. Inadequate protein intake in plant-based diets is crucial for bone matrix formation and maintenance.\n\nFood choices must consider benefits and mitigate negative health outcomes, addressing micronutrient deficiencies in plant-based diets or opting for fortified foods. Caution against unhealthy plant-based diets—especially highly processed options—is essential to reduce cardiovascular and cancer risks. These findings inform guidelines for preventing osteoporosis through balanced, nutrient-rich diets. Balanced and healthy diets are important, ensuring adequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake while averting potential adverse effects of certain dietary patterns.\n\nFuture research should explore the negative impacts of plant-based diets through randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies.\n\nReferences:\n\nClem J, Barthel B.

Director of Surgical Nutrition, Division of Trauma and Critical Care Surgery, Rhode Island Hospital\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Providing nutritional support during the acute phase of critical illness remains an ongoing area of research. The questions of how to provide support are challenging but crucial issues to study in a complex patient population with numerous barriers to feeding combined with severe inflammatory processes. These patients face high risks of morbidity, long term impairment or functional loss, and mortality.\n\nWhile it is clear the stakes are high, the ideal amounts and timing of nutrition are not. There is increasing recognition that higher calorie1 and protein goals2 may not improve outcomes, perhaps even causing harm. On the whole, however, the data are contradictory and heterogeneous. For these reasons, ASPEN’s 2021 guidelines3 shifted down the suggested target caloric goal to 12 – 25 kcal/kg. This remained a weak recommendation, highlighting the need for more trials.\n\nSummary: The authors set out under the hypothesis that low-calorie, low-protein feeding in critically ill patients would decrease their 60-day mortality or time to readiness for ICU discharge. NUTRIREA-3 is a pragmatic, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open label, superiority trial. Adult patients admitted to 61 ICUs across France were eligible if they were expected to require ongoing mechanical ventilation combined with vasoactive therapy. Among other common criteria, patients with specific nutritional needs, such as prior home enteral or parenteral nutrition, were excluded.\n\nIn the intervention arm, patients were assigned targets of 6 kcal/kg/day and 0.2-0.4 g/kg/day of protein, compared to 25 kcal/kg/day and 1.0-1.3 g/kg/day protein under usual care. These were calculated based on actual body weight up to a maximum that would result in a BMI of 30 kg/m2. Nutritional support was started immediately following randomization with the route determined daily by the bedside team. This continued until the 8th day, when all patients increased to 30 kcal/kg/day and 1.2-2.0 g/kg/day of protein. There was an adjustment due to the pandemic, where 90-day mortality was swapped in as a primary outcome.\n\nAnalysis of the 3044 patients demonstrated great separation of calories and protein between groups. There was not a reduction in 90-day mortality, with a rate of 41.3% in the low group and 42.8% in the usual group (95% CI -5.0-2.0, p=0.41). Time to readiness for ICU discharge was reduced to 8.0 days from 9.0 days (95% CI 1.02-1.22, p=0.015). In the secondary outcomes, days to wean from mechanical ventilation were also reduced with a trend toward a similar reduction in the wean from vasopressor support. There were also reductions in complications related to enteral feeding, such as vomiting (20.2% vs 25.5% p<0.001), diarrhea (28.9% vs 33.3%, p=0.004), bowel ischemia (0.9% vs 1.8%, p=0.030), and liver dysfunction (61.7% vs 65.8%, p = 0.032) in the low vs standard groups. There was no difference in patients who received dialysis, nor in rates of various infections.\n\nCommentary: The NUTRIREA-3 study was well executed and seeks to address an important question. Protocol adherence was high, with excellent separation of caloric and protein intake between the two groups and patients impressively close to their assigned goals. This may have been aided by these patients predominantly having medical diagnoses on admission, which would affect the generalizability. The lack of a difference in mortality underscores a common problem in ICU research in general. Mortality benefits seem increasingly hard to prove and do not address the significant muscle loss and the long recovery that survivors of critical illness face. Conversely, long term follow-up of a functional outcome in 3,000 patients would be an immense undertaking.\n\nWhile not definitive, this paper reinforces that early, full nutritional support in the acute phase of critical illness at least does not improve outcomes. A reduction in caloric and protein goals here showed a modest improvement in ICU recovery and continues to the trend of suggested benefits in secondary outcomes. It will increase the quality of the literature available and certainly is worth reading for those caring for these patients.\n\nReferences:\n\nBraunschweig CA, Sheean PM, Peterson SJ, et al.

Randomized clinical trial: Long-term Staphylococcus aureus decolonization in patients on home parenteral nutrition. Clinical Nutrition, 42(5), 706–716. PMID: 36965196\n\nReviewer: Trevor Tabone, MD, MRCP (UK), ESEGH. Higher Specialist Trainee in Gastroenterology, Mater Dei Hospital, Malta\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Intestinal failure (IF) patients can now benefit from home parenteral nutrition (HPN), which can be regarded as a life-sustaining treatment. As a result, these patients become dependent on a long-term central venous access device (CVAD) for HPN to be delivered. Unfortunately, this increases the risk of serious complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).\n\nStaphylococcus aureus related CRBSI is a much-dreaded complication due to its association with metastatic infections, often requiring CVAD removal and intravenous antibiotic treatment1. This may compromise long-term central vascular access and therefore highlights the importance of preventative measures to reduce the risk of CRBSI.\n\nPathogen-specific preventative strategies such as S. aureus decolonization should be considered as standard of care in addition to general infection prevention strategies. However, given the paucity of well-designed clinical trials, the level of evidence is considered low. S. aureus carriage in a patient with a CVAD should be defined as complicated and is thought to be increasingly common than previously believed.\n\nSummary: This was an international multicentre, open-label, superiority, randomized controlled trial carried out at three IF expertise centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two whole-body long-term decolonization strategies. 63 patients who had been on HPN/fluid supplementation for >3 months met eligibility criteria for confirmed nasal and/or extra-nasal S. aureus colonization, age >18 years with a life expectancy of >1 year. Patients with either active S. aureus infection or those who had received decolonization treatment in the previous 2 months were excluded from the trial.\n\nThese patients were randomized into either a ‘continuous suppression’ (CS) strategy or a ‘search and destroy’ (SD) strategy. The former strategy consisted of repeated topical treatment without the use of systemic antibiotics for 5 consecutive days every month (12 months in total) irrespective of S. aureus carriage results. The topical treatments consisted of thrice daily 2% nasal mupirocin in each nostril, once daily chlorhexidine body wash and twice daily chlorhexidine oropharyngeal rinse. The latter strategy involved a short-term systemic antibiotic treatment for seven days as combination therapy targeting both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus. This was coupled with a seven-day course of the previously mentioned topical treatments.\n\nFollow-up assessments were carried out at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-enrollment. S. aureus cultures were obtained from the nose, throat, rectum, and exit-site catheter. Standardized and validated questionnaires were used to evaluate treatment compliance and quality of life.\n\nAs a primary outcome of this study, intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that S. aureus was completely eradicated during the 1-year follow-up period with a mean percentage of 61% in the CS group as opposed to 39% in the SD group with an odds ratio of 2.38 (95% CI 0.92-6.11; p = 0.07).\n\nSecondary outcomes from this study revealed an equal incidence of S. aureus infections between both treatment strategies: 6 participants (SD 3; CS 3). Eradication attempts had failed in all of them. 5 infections were CVAD-related (3 CRBSI; 2 exit-site infections). Moreover, adverse effects occurred more frequently in the SD group compared to the CS group (44 vs 21; p = 0.01). The authors also concluded that the SD strategy was not cost-effective when considering incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Patients in the CS group were significantly more likely than the SD group to be uncompliant with topical medication. A significantly higher risk of eradication failure was present in patients with a gastroenterostomy and in those who had a S. aureus carrier caregiver.\n\nCommentary: This study addresses an important clinical scenario encountered in the care of HPN patients. A low incidence rate of CRBSI per catheter days is key to a successful HPN program. This reduces morbidity and mortality whilst preserving long-term central vascular access by avoiding repeated CVAD insertions2. S. aureus CRBSI is a major concern for CVAD-dependent patients. Decolonization can diminish the risk of S. aureus infections in carriers with CVAD3.\n\nIn summary, the findings from the presented study suggest that a CS strategy leads to a higher rate of successful S. aureus decolonization in HPN patients. Given that it is a well-tolerated and a less expensive strategy, its implementation should therefore be considered by HPN caregivers. However, patient compliance could be challenging, whilst other factors such as the presence of a gastroenterostomy and S. aureus carriage among caregivers need to be considered.\n\nReferences:\n\nGahlot R, Nigam C, Kumar V, Yadav G, Anupurba S.

Despite the rising prevalence of IBD across the world2, the nutritional management of patients at specialized IBD centers remains heterogeneous and understudied. This national study scrutinized the organization and delivery of nutrition care in Italy in both the outpatient and hospital settings. Information on clinicians’ perceptions of nutritional care was also collected. The paper is helpful for increasing clinician awareness of the status of nutrition care in a major European country and may serve to inspire similar investigative efforts elsewhere.¬\n\nSummary: A 22-question survey was created by the Italian Society of Artificial Nutrition and Metabolism (SINPE) and the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD). Among the 120 IBD centers the researchers formally invited to participate via e-mail, 76 completed the questionnaire on a dedicated website. Seventeen centers were located at private hospitals, 26 at public academic hospitals, while the majority (51%) were at nonacademic/public community hospitals. All IBD centers offered care to adult patients, but a handful offered pediatric care. The most frequently occurring case load was <500 cases per center.\n\nJust over one-third of participating centers had nutritionists specifically for IBD patients. Though more than half of respondents had a multidisciplinary IBD team at their center, only 22 centers had nutritionists. However, 67.1% of centers replied that they could obtain nutritional evaluations for their IBD patients with ease. Less than one-third of centers (30.3%) conducted a systematic or daily assessment of malnutrition risk in the outpatient setting, while all other centers reported that they at least conducted as-needed assessments. Interestingly, the malnutrition risk assessment was predominantly done by gastroenterologists as compared to nutritionists, dieticians, or nurses. Greater than 50% of centers used anthropometry and biochemistry as parameters of malnutrition risk, and a higher percentage employed these parameters over bioelectrical impedance and evaluation tools to assess nutritional status. The choice to provide oral nutrition support in the outpatient setting was made jointly by a nutritionist and a gastroenterologist at 35.5% of centers, versus by a gastroenterologist alone at the same percentage of centers. At 50% of outpatient IBD centers, the choice to initiate enteral or parenteral nutrition was handled jointly by a nutritionist and a gastroenterologist. Upon hospital admission, patients at 38 centers underwent a malnutrition risk assessment and a nutritional status assessment at 40 centers. The choice to begin enteral or parenteral nutrition was made by a nutritionist with a gastroenterologist at 46% of centers. On a 100 mm visual analogue scale, the relevance of nutritional care scored a mean of 86.5. The necessity to incorporate nutritional care via “an integrated care pathway” scored higher at 87.3.\n\nOverall, findings illuminate that two-thirds of Italian IBD centers do not have nutritionists and only assess nutritional status in active disease, complicated cases, or when there is apparent or suspected malnutrition. Resource limitations are thought to underlie the selective screening for and assessment of malnutrition, which carry implications for potential undertreatment.\n\nCommentary: The paper underscores a need to integrate more nutritionists into the multidisciplinary teams at IBD centers in Italy to ultimately improve management, an effort that arguably must be undertaken in other countries as well due to the global disease burden. Study limitations include the inherent biases of survey-based methodology and its observational nature. More research is needed to establish the specific benefits of increasing the recruitment of nutritionists at centers for IBD. Nonetheless, this article highlights an opportunity for nutritionists (and others with formal nutrition training) to be consulted beyond the neediest cases with the goal of optimizing outcomes in IBD. At a number of institutions where gastroenterologists initiate enteral or parenteral nutrition at IBD centers, unaided by nutritionists, integrating formal nutrition training into gastroenterology fellowships is one possible way to bridge the gap. The authors have successfully contributed to the body of literature on the nutritional care of the IBD patient and exposed an important disparity between clinician perceptions and the practical implementation of health care.\n\nReferences:\n\nNguyen GC, Munsell M, Harris ML.

Orthorexia Nervosa Practices in Rheumatoid Arthritis: The DORA Study. Nutrients. 2023; 15(3):713. doi: 10.3390/nu15030713\n\nReviewer: Chameera Hettige, MBBS, IOC Dip.(Sports Nutrition), MSc (Human Nutrition), MD (Clinical Nutrition), Senior Registrar in Clinical Nutrition, Post Graduate Institute of Medicine, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) is a feeding and eating disorder that is characterized by an obsession with healthy, “pure” eating. These patients are pathologically fixated on the caliber and nutritional value and perceived health-promoting aspects of food. To regulate their diet, they apply rigid, self-imposed rules. This leads to restrictive diets, resulting in inadequate intake, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal disturbances, and a negative impact on psychosocial and personal functioning. Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence of ON in chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,1 coeliac disease,2 and cancer.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic disorder with inflammatory arthritis with or without extra-articular manifestations. Despite pharmacological advances in the treatment of RA, some patients are unable to attain sustained remission. Therefore, medical nutrition therapy (MNT), lifestyle modification, and physiotherapy play an important role in disease management. RA patients receive MNT where healthy eating takes center stage as part of a long-term approach to disease management.\n\nSummary: This DORA (Diet and Orthorexia in Rheumatoid Arthritis) study aimed to assess ON tendencies in adult patients with RA in Greece. It was conducted as a cross-sectional study on 133 adult patients with RA during May-August 2022. A structured online questionnaire was utilized to assess demographic data and disease characteristics. The participant’s body weight and height were self-reported while body mass index (BMI) was calculated. World Health Organization BMI cut-offs were used for classification into weight categories. ON tendencies were evaluated using a translated, culturally adapted ORTO-15 questionnaire (screening tool), which assessed the frequency of ON tendency occurrences. It has 15 questions, each with 4 possible answers that express the frequency of occurrence on a Likert scale (never, sometimes, often, and always) with a score ranging from 1 to 4. The total score was calculated for all 15 questions. Most participants were women (126 out of 133), and the median BMI was 25.83 kg/m2. The majority of patients were overweight and obese (53.4%). The median duration of RA was 5 years with 54.9% of participants reportedly in remission. The median ORTO-15 score was 36 (IQR 33-39).\n\nNone of the examined associations of the study variables were significant. Following univariable linear regression analyses, advancing age (β coeff: 0.07, 95%BCaCI: 0.001 to 0.14; p = 0.037) and BMI (β coeff: 0.13, 95% BCaCI: 0.02 to 0.25; p = 0.020) both increased the ORTO-15 score, whereas in females (β coeff: 2.50, 95% BCaCI: 4.17 to 0.88; p = 0.002) the score was lower. Other factors, such as the duration of RA, the number of years of smoking, and single divorced status, were non-significantly associated with higher ORTO-15 scores. The authors concluded that this study revealed patients with RA have high ON tendencies. There were greater tendencies of ON associated with females and lowered tendencies with advancing age and BMI.\n\nLimitations of this study include small sample size, online recruitment of those able to communicate in the Greek language, lack of a control group, disease status reported by the patient, and self-reported anthropometric measurements. In addition, any other comorbidities that could have contributed to dietary changes were not assessed. The authors further acknowledged the use of the much-criticized ORTO-15 questionnaire as a screening tool for this study where the interpretation of the score in its Greek version was controversial.\n\nCommentary: There is an unmet need for more research to gain a better understanding of the occurrence of ON in chronic diseases as this study indicates. The combination of several tools might be more pertinent than the use of a single tool when dealing with ON. However, following the consensus for the definition and diagnostic criteria of ON,4 all the pre-existing tools for screening need revision, re-evaluation for suitability, and validation.\n\nAs ON is a recently discovered entity, it is crucial to be aware of this disorder to take preventative measures when treating susceptible individuals with chronic diseases. Medical nutrition therapy should be delivered by professionals, with parallel evaluation and close routine monitoring of a person's dietary changes.\n\nReferences:\n\nGrammatikopoulou MG, Gkiouras K, Polychronidou G, Kaparounaki C, Gkouskou KK, Magkos F, Donini LM, Eliopoulos AG, Goulis DG.

Intravenous Vitamin C in Adults with Sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit. N Engl J Med. 2022 Jun 23;386(25):2387-2398. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2200644.\n\nReviewers: Prof. Dr. Christian Stoppe, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Department of Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency and Pain Medicine, Wuerzburg, Germany; Dr. Ellen Dresen, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Department of Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency and Pain Medicine, Wuerzburg, Germany; Prof. Dr. Gunnar Elke, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Kiel, Germany\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: During critical illness, vitamin C concentrations rapidly decrease due for example to increased metabolic needs for anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory processes, increased loss resulting from the necessity of specific medical treatments, dilution, and impaired redistribution. In general, low vitamin C levels are associated with oxidative stress, higher degrees of inflammation, organ dysfunctions, which subsequently influences short and long-term outcomes. Given the pleiotropic functions of vitamin C and the significantly depleted vitamin C levels observed during critical illness, it has been hypothesized that higher dosages than recommended for healthy adults might be needed to counteract the often overwhelming inflammatory response and disease-related vitamin C depletion. It further was speculated that this in turn may ultimately translate into clinically meaningful outcomes of specific cohorts of critically ill patients with high inflammatory status such as septic patients.\n\nSummary: In this international, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, IV vitamin C or matched placebo were given at the same dose of 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for up to 96 hours to patients with sepsis (n=872) within 24 hours of ICU admission. The incidence of the primary outcome, a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (need for vasopressor, invasive mechanical ventilation, or renal-replacement therapy) on day 28 was significantly higher in the vitamin C than in the control group (44.5 % vs. 38. 5%; p=0.01). Although the incidence of the components of the primary outcome was not statistically different between groups, the vitamin C group consistently demonstrated a higher incidence of these outcomes. There were no differences between the two groups regarding further outcomes (organ-dysfunction scores, biomarkers, 6-month survival, health-related quality of life, stage 3 acute kidney injury, hypoglycemic episodes).1\n\nCommentary: Recent systematic reviews/meta‐analyses (SRMAs)2–5 evaluating high-dose vitamin C with or without thiamin and/or corticosteroids in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and those with sepsis and septic shock have been published. All these SRMAs found no significant effect of vitamin C on 28‐day to 1‐year mortality. Subgroup analyses of stand-alone higher vs lower dose of vitamin C demonstrated lower mortality rates4,5, less organ injury, and shorter duration of vasopressor use in patients receiving high-dose of vitamin C.2,3 There was no significant effect of vitamin C on the development of acute kidney injury, ventilator‐free days, and ICU or hospital length of stay. The most recent SRMA6 as well included the results of the LOVIT trial and showed that high-dose vitamin C monotherapy is still associated with significant reduction in overall mortality, especially in patients with increased mortality risk.\n\nPotential explanations for the LOVIT findings may have been imbalances in the baseline characteristics (e.g., undifferentiated sepsis/metabolic phenotypes, vitamin C status), the rather short treatment period (96 hours), and the timing of initiating the intervention (within 24 hours after ICU admission, previous ICU LOS not considered). Further, it has been criticized that the sample size was calculated assuming a too optimistic absolute risk difference, which leads to low power. Therefore, we should be skeptical that vitamin C causes harm in septic patients, despite the significant result.7\n\nYet, based on current evidence, high-dose vitamin C supplementation in patients with sepsis, however, cannot be recommended. Further research for this potentially life-saving therapy is urgently warranted to determine the optimal timing, dosage, duration, and especially target population among critically ill patients who may benefit most from high‐dose vitamin C supplementation. Hence, treatment of proven vitamin C deficiencies is mandatory in clinical practice and should be performed according to current guideline recommendations.8\n\nReferences:\n\nLamontagne F, Masse M-H, Menard J, et al.

Association of CT-based diagnosis of sarcopenia with prognosis and treatment response in patients at risk of malnutrition - A secondary analysis of the Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT) trial.

Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Ottawa; Medical Director of Home Parenteral Nutrition Program and Medical Lead for Inpatient Nutrition at The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Sarcopenia is an emerging risk factor for negative clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients, but much remains to be learned about how body composition assessments can be used in clinical practice. Muscle mass and quality can be ascertained from computed tomography (CT) scans, which are often performed routinely on inpatients. CT scans are thus a potential source of complementary information about a patient’s body composition and nutritional risk, which could be used to help guide nutrition therapy. This paper explores the utility of CT based sarcopenia diagnosis in predicting clinical outcomes as well as response to nutrition therapy.\n\nSummary: This study is a secondary analysis of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) EFFORT (Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial) (1). Briefly, EFFORT was a pragmatic, unblinded, multi-center RCT in Switzerland where 2028 non-critically ill, non-surgical hospitalized patients at nutrition risk as defined by Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) >3 were randomized within 48 hours of hospital admission to individualized nutrition support to reach protein and caloric goals as defined by a registered dietitian, versus standard hospital food. The present study was restricted to a subgroup of 573 patients who underwent abdominal CT scan as part of routine care. Patients were classified as sarcopenic based on skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra using sex and body mass index (BMI) specific cut-offs. Muscle quality was also assessed using attenuation parameters. The goal of the study was to investigate the association of CT-based sarcopenia with nutritional and clinical outcomes as well as response to nutritional intervention.\n\nThe cohort included 573 patients with mean age of 70, 58% males, mean BMI of 25 with majority having mild to moderate illness. Of these, 68.4% were assessed as sarcopenic, with 8.4% sarcopenic obese. Sarcopenic patients were significantly older with lower BMI and higher NRS and exhibited lower handgrip strength. Sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes within 30 days (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.06-2.38), with increased risk of readmission (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.47) but no effect on mortality. Low muscle attenuation was similarly significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes and readmission, but also 180-day mortality (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.29-3.11). In the original EFFORT trial, nutrition therapy reduced risk of adverse clinical outcomes including mortality. In this study, nutrition therapy was protective against 30-day mortality only in the non-sarcopenic patients (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.85) with no effect in those with sarcopenia (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.50-1.38). There was no difference in response to nutrition therapy between sarcopenic and non sarcopenic patients with respect to the primary composite endpoint of adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nCommentary: CT-based sarcopenia measurement can identify patients who are at risk of negative clinical outcomes, and who may not respond to conventional nutrition therapy. Abdominal CT scans offer a direct window into a patient’s body composition, which can be difficult to assess clinically, especially in the setting of obesity or generalized edema. When routinely performed in the inpatient setting, an abdominal CT scan is more accessible than other forms of measuring body composition. While it does not replace the nutrition focused physical examination, the CT scan can be used as an extension of the physical exam. One does not need to have expertise in radiology to use CT scans in this manner, as registered dietitians can be trained to precisely assess skeletal muscle index using CT (2). CT-derived sarcopenia measurements are not generally part of clinical practice but have been heavily used in research. Perhaps it is time to increase the use of this technology in the clinical setting. Certainly, additional studies are needed to validate the use of this technology as both a predictive factor and a tool guiding nutrition therapy, especially in the setting of sarcopenic obesity, which is highly prevalent in North America but made up less than 10% of this study’s population.\n\nReferences:\n\nSchuetz P, Fehr R, Baechli V, Geiser M, Deiss M, Gomes F, et al.

Flavor enhancement as a strategy to improve food liking in cancer patients with taste and smell alterations. Clinical Nutrition Open Science. 2023 Feb 1;47:53-63.\n\nReviewer: Manoji Gamage, MBBS, Msc (Human Nutrition), MD (Clinical Nutrition), Consultant Nutrition Physician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, Colombo, Sri Lanka\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: Worldwide the prevalence of cancer is rising and the number of people undergoing active treatment, in conservative management and living with cancer is increasing. There are enough studies reporting the benefit of good nutrition in the entire paradigm of cancer care. However feeding patients with cancer is always a challenge. In spite of energy deficit in most of the patients, altered taste and smell sensation prevents patients from following the diet prescription. Although pharmacological intervention for appetite stimulation are present a food based approach to increase food acceptability will be the most suitable and favorable approach for patient who are already on many drugs.\n\nSummary: The objective of the study had been to examine the effect of flavor enhancement on food liking in a group of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and with varying self-reported taste/smell abilities. The liking of four eggplant creams enhanced with either salt, lemon, garlic, or cumin was evaluated in comparison to a reference eggplant cream in a group of 154 cancer patients. This eggplant-based food was selected particularly because of its low intensity taste so it could facilitate the flavor modification by the enhancement. Further, the creamy texture of the chosen recipe would not pose a constraint to patients with mouth dryness and mouth sores, which are common side effects of chemotherapy. The taste and acceptability had been tested using a healthy control group. Patients had been stratified in to two subgroups according to their self-reported taste and smell perception abilities during chemotherapy (unaltered sensation/altered sensation).\n\nResults:\n\nPhase 1. Hedonic characterization by the control group\n\nThe control group was composed of 36 women with a mean age of 57.7 ± 7.7, mainly non-smokers (80%). Cumin cream was significantly more appreciated than the Reference cream but not the salt, lemon and garlic creams.\n\nPhrase 2. Hedonic Characterization by all cancer patients\n\nA hierarchical clustering method based on the self-reported rating of taste and smell abilities resulted in a classification of patients into two groups . The first group was composed of 102 patients (66.2%) and attributed a high rating to their taste and smell abilities. This group had been labelled “unaltered”. The second group had included 52 patients (33.8%) who poorly rated their taste perception ability and attributed an average rating to their sense of smell. This second group was labelled “altered”. The taste and smell ratings of patients with “unaltered” abilities were similar to healthy controls' ratings (P >0.05), whereas the altered group ratings were lower.\n\nLevel of hunger and liking of the reference eggplant cream:\n\nPatients in the “unaltered” group had a significantly higher level of hunger before the tasting session (5.71 ± 2.72) compared to the “altered” (3.75 ± 2.62; t (151) ¼ -4.285, P<0.001) group.\n\nLiking ratings of the enhanced recipes compared to the reference by all cancer patient:\n\nAdding salt and garlic significantly increased patients' liking of the eggplant cream (P<0.001 in both cases) but not in controls (P>0.05), while adding lemon reduced liking compared to the reference (P<0.001). Enhancing food flavor is likely to be a promising way to increase food liking in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Future studies should include measurements of food intake during a full meal and over a defined period to examine whether increasing flavor can help in increasing the quantity, thus the total calorie intake.\n\nCommentary: Loss of appetite and disordered taste sensation is one of the major challenges in nutritionally optimizing cancer patients. This often leads to use of assisted tube feeding, further increasing the discomfort in patients with cancers. Therefore exploring flavor enhancement in natural food is a very useful, profitable approach in oncology. However the food liking is a very personal feeling and could be diverse in the population. Therefore different recipes should be tried depending on the cultural influences. If food based approach, rather than commercial supplementation is possible this will also reduce the financial burden for the families caring for cancer patients.\n\nNOVEMBER 2022\n\nPublication: Black, A.K.; Pantalone, J.; Marrone, A-C.; Morell, E.; Telles, R.; DeBrunner, M. Identifying Food Insecurity in Cardiology Clinic and Connecting Families to Resources. Pediatrics. 2022;149(5):e2020011718. Published: May 2022\n\nReviewer: Melissa T.

This factor presents profound challenges for physicians, children, and families. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends Hunger Vital Sign (HVS) as FI screening at scheduled health maintenance visits or sooner as indicated, especially those children with chronic medical conditions. Children with congenital heart diseases (CHD) are in high risk of FI due to high cost of health services, continually increasing medical costs in hospitalizations and prescription medication. The HSV screening can benefit the physicians to engage in efforts of mitigating FI by familiarizing themselves with community resources. It can also benefit CHD families, who are more likely to delay medical care due to cost, by addressing FI in CHD by HVS to improve their nutrition status and gain access to good nutrition and timely care.\n\nSummary: Hunger Vital Sign is a validated two-item screening tool designed by Hager et al which uses a subset of two questions from the Household Food Security Scale (HFSS): (1) “within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more” and (2) “within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn’t last and we didn’t have money to get more.” This screening tool is more practical and feasible to incorporate in the clinic workflow and it can identify food insecurity by any affirmative answers to either of the 2 questions with 97% sensitivity and 83% specificity as compared to the 18 item HFSS. The impact of CHD severity on FI is expected to be high (n=106, odds ratio [OR] 1.67 [1.21-2.29], P=.002) but based on the report, FI is even more frequent in those with moderate CHD. This paper also describes the implementation of FI screening using HSV in a busy pediatric cardiology clinic. The limitation of this study is that it heavily relied on human screeners although their FI screening rates improved using HSV from 0% to >85%. There was also an overwhelming support from their clinical physicians. Majority of their physicians (70%) agreed that FI screening is a great benefit to all patients while 30% agreed it can only benefit some patients. All (100%) of the respondents felt that implementation of FI screening does not cause negative impact, never a workflow barrier and does not impose additional time. The primary outcome of this study was to connect all FI families to resources and it revealed that FI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Collaboration with social work (SW) and community partners via face-to-face meetings near the time of screening was important in connecting the FI families of CHD patients with appropriate resources and in reducing the loss to follow-up rates. There is a need to have an established FI team and SW or community partners in the clinic so that an individualized and targeted FI intervention will take place.\n\nCommentary: There are numerous studies on the impact of food insecurity to health and illness. This is an ongoing concern of pediatricians like me that are involved in the care of children with CHD. Currently, I am handling malnourished CHD patients who need to gain specific weight in order to undergo elective surgeries, and I am also managing the nutrition, growth, and development recovery of post-surgery CHD patients. I can sympathize with the struggles the families are facing to provide for their medical needs and to survive on a daily basis. “Nutrition care is a human right” is our worldwide campaign to raise awareness of patient’s rights to nutrition care. But the burden is the finance costs, especially in the Philippines, where health insurance companies do not cover for any artificial nutrition, such as oral nutrition supplements, enteral feeding formulas and parenteral nutrition products. In one of the hospitals where I practiced, providing F75 and F100 formula for all severe acute malnourished admitted less than 5 years old patient is the only free nutrition resources we can provide. The AAP’s 2015 policy statement is about promoting food security for all children, which is also in line with one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Zero Hunger by 2030. I realized, in working with these goals, that there is a need of food insecurity awareness to all physicians, health care workers and medical students. I also learned that by identifying food insecurity in families using a defined protocol and then connecting them to sustainable resources will move us to a step forward in reaching our goal, that is to achieve food security. The biggest challenge that I need to face now is to establish a team of screeners and community partners.\n\nReferences:\n\nGattu, R.K., Paik, G., Wang, Y., Ray, P., Lichenstein, R., & Black, M.M.

The beneficial effects of intradialytic parenteral nutrition in haemodialysis patients with protein-energy wasting: a prospective randomized control trial. Scientific reports 2022, 12, 4529.\n\nReviewer: Hashan Amarathunga, MBBS, MSc, IOC Dip, MD in Clinical Nutrition trainee, Registrar in Clinical Nutrition, National Hospital Colombo, Sri Lanka\n\nWhy is This Paper Important: End-stage chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis are routinely facing multiple metabolic and nutritional problems. It is a challenge for most of these patients to even meet their daily energy and protein requirements, Intradialytic Parenteral Nutrition (IDPN) is a good way to supply additional energy and nutrients when required energy targets are not met. It will help to reduce the risk of developing protein-energy wasting. However, IDPN is not routinely used in most settings, which can provide beneficial results to selected patients. This review is to highlight the importance of IDPN in hemodialysis patients.\n\nSummary: This study was an open-label randomized control study conducted in 2020 at Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. They screened all the hemodialysis patients in the setting and identified patients who were suitable for IDPN. If the patient's spontaneous dietary intake was > 20 kilocalories (kcal)/kilogram (kg)/day and protein intake ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day, they were not able to tolerate oral nutrition supplements (ONS) due to gastrointestinal side effects, had presence of protein energy wasting (PEW) and were over 18 years of age along with at least two of the following: serum albumin ≤ 3.5 g/dL, serum prealbumin ≤ 30 mg/dL, category B in subjective global assessment (SGA) or ≥ 5 in malnutrition inflammation score (MIS) they were considered as meeting the inclusion criteria. Patients who had a persistent fasting plasma glucose of > 300 mg/dL, elevated triglyceride > 300 mg/dL, active heart failure, chronic infections, malignancy, pregnancy or lactation and allergy to any components of parenteral nutrition were excluded from the study. They randomly assigned patients to IDPN and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. (IDPN group 18 and control group 20 patients). IDPN was continued for three months with a concentrated 3-in-1 parenteral nutrition formula consisting of glucose, essential and non-essential amino acids, and fish oil-based lipid emulsion with omega-3 fatty acids along with monthly nutrition counselling. The control group received intensive dietary counselling once weekly for three months. Then both groups were followed for additional three months after the intervention. IDPN group patients receive around 3000 kcal per week via 3 in 1 parenteral nutrition solution.\n\nAt the end of the intervention period (three months), the IDPN group showed statistically significant improvement in body weight (p = 0.006) and serum albumin level (p = 0.01) compared to the control group. But there was no significant difference between the two groups' metabolic profile, body composition, muscle power, inflammatory markers, and serum ghrelin. Plasma leptin levels showed a significant increase from the baseline in the control group but no change in the IDPN group.\n\nAt the end of the intervention-free three months, which is six months from the start, the IDPN group had maintained the high serum albumin level and their average spontaneous oral energy and protein intake were persistently high compared to the beginning of the intervention. There was no significant difference in any of the other parameters at the end of six months in the two groups. Adverse effects between the two groups had no statistical significance. Improvement of spontaneous oral intake might be explained in part by the changes in appetite-related biomarkers.\n\nCommentary: This study shows that IDPN improves serum albumin, body weight, and spontaneous oral intake in protein-energy wasted hemodialysis patients. Improvement of serum albumin level is found to have reduced mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis (1)(2)(3). As they improve their spontaneous oral intake, further nutrition support requirements are minimal and helps to improve the overall quality of life. According to the study, three months of IDPN in protein-energy wasted hemodialysis patients will be beneficial compared to intensive dietary counselling alone. However, this study was a small-scale study with short-term follow-up. Large-scale, long-term studies will be further needed to establish the benefits of the IDPN in hemodialysis patients.\n\nReferences:\n\nIkizler TA, Burrowes JD, Byham-Gray LD, Campbell KL, Carrero JJ, Chan W, et al.

In order to conduct relevant nutrition research, traditional dietary assessment methods, dietary compliance and nutrient intake analysis methods should be utilized. However, these may be time-consuming and challenging to accomplish accurately, especially in the clinical setting. Nowadays, anyone can have access "
