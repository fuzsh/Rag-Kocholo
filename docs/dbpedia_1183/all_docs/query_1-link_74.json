        "text": "Hit songs are getting shorter to fit the attention span of the TikTok generation, with Harry Styles mastering the art of the sub three-minute chart-topper.\n\nHis number one “As It Was”, which clocks in at a brisk 2 minutes 47 seconds, was the best-selling song of 2022, racking up 180m streams, BPI figures show.\n\nThe song, which topped the charts for 10 consecutive weeks last year, was beaten for brevity by the year’s eighth best-seller, “Where Are You Now” by Lost Frequencies & Calum Scott, which quits after 2:28.\n\nAn all-British top 10 of the year’s most popular songs includes “Afraid To Feel” by electronic duo LF System, which makes its point in 2 minutes 57 seconds.\n\nStyles himself is becoming a master of concision, having shaved seven seconds off his 2021 Brit award-winning song of the year, “Watermelon Sugar”.\n\nHit songs are reverting to the short and simple mode common in the 50s and early 60s – when Elvis Presley’s All Shook Up (1957) was done and dusted in one minute 57 seconds.\n\nArtistic ambition encouraged expansive songs in the late 60s and in the 70s, when the Eagles’ “Hotel California” (6:30) and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” (5:55) dominated turntables, is over.\n\nBut in the late 70s punk revived the short, sharp single – with The Clash’s “White Riot” clocking in at 1:58.\n\nIn the 80s the success of the 12in single encouraged a host of long-playing songs, and the advent of house, trance and techno encouraged production of some interminable tracks.\n\nNow, in the age of short mobile videos, the quick hit of pop appears to be back.\n\nAnalysis of the 1,404 releases to reach number one in the history of the UK Singles Chart, compiled for the run-down’s 70th anniversary last year, found that number-one singles were an average of three minutes in length in 1967 and increased to more than four minutes in 1984. But the figure in 2022 was close to three minutes again and falling fast.\n\nToday’s hit songs are increasingly spread via TikTok memes where short and snappy works best – the 16 million-selling country-rap hit Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, which went viral on the video platform, clocks in at one minute and 57 seconds.\n\nThe dominance of streaming platform Spotify and its algorithms for discovering songs has also transformed the way tracks are produced. If listeners aren’t instantly hooked by an “earworm” they will simply click on to the next song.\n\nLengthy introductions and instrumental breaks are out of fashion with artists following the maxim: “Don’t bore us, get to the chorus.”\n\nWith 30 seconds of listening counting as a “play” for payment, there is less incentive for musicians to entertain listeners with elongated songs.\n\nMiddle eights, bridges, and chorus-repeating fade outs, once beloved by blathering DJs, are disappearing – with “As It Was” among hits coming to a hard stop at 2:47.\n\nSpeed thrills: How track lengths have changed\n\n1957 Elvis Presley – All Shook Up (one minute, 57 seconds)\n\n1968 Beatles – Hey Jude (7:11)\n\n1975 Queen – Bohemian Rhapsody (5:55)\n\n1977 Eagles – Hotel California (6:30)\n\n1978 The Clash – White Riot (1:58)\n\n1984 Duran Duran – Is There Something I Should Know (4:11)\n\n1998 Madonna – Frozen (6:12)\n\n2018 Lil Nas X – Old Town Road (1:53)\n\n2022 Harry Styles – As It Was (2:47)\n\nDr Adrian York, who started his career as a pop star in 80s band Roman Holliday and is now a University of Westminster academic, said: “Artists are having to edit their songs down by cutting out introduction sections and simplifying choruses to maximise their playlisting and streaming potential.”\n\nBut he believes the one outlier in the 2022 top 10 – Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill”, the 1985 song revived by Netflix’s Stranger Things, which runs to just under five minutes – suggests listeners still have the attention span for “more nutritious fare.”\n\nStyles was also behind 2022’s top album with his Grammy and Mercury-prize shortlisted Harry’s House.\n\nHe is the first artist to have the year’s top single and album since Lewis Capaldi in 2019 with “Someone You Loved” and Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.\n\nBut the age of the “blockbuster” multi-million selling album is receding. Harry’s House has yet to pass the 500,000 sales marker. In 2017, Ed Sheeran’s Divide was the year’s most popular album with 2.1m copies.\n\nAlthough streaming individual songs has returned the music business to profitability, the continuing decline in CD sales – down 19 per cent to 11.6m – means big-name artists are selling in fewer numbers. Adele’s 30 album and Stormzy’s new release This Is What I Mean failed to make the 2022 top 10.\n\nThe vinyl revival continued with 5.5m copies sold, the highest figure for 30 years. Taylor Swift’s Midnights was the year’s best-selling vinyl disc, shifting 80,000 copies. With new releases costing up to £30, vinyl revenues overtook CDs for the first time since 1986.\n\nSales of cassettes, whilst still a very small part of the market overall, continued to grow in 2022, up 5.2 per cent year-on-year to 195,000 units.\n\nLeon Neville, BPI’s director of research and insight, said: “At a time when streaming has created unprecedented competition coming from every corner of the globe, it is astonishing that in 2022 British artists were involved in all of the top 10 calendar year’s biggest hits in the UK.”\n\n“With streaming having led the market to an eighth consecutive annual rise in UK music consumption, this platform is creating new and increased opportunities for labels to connect many thousands of artists with expanding fanbases, while enabling even more of them to succeed.”\n\nCulture Secretary Michelle Donelan said: “This clean sweep of the UK singles chart by British artists demonstrates the depth of creative talent we have. Everyone on the list has the ability to capture people’s imagination and I would like to congratulate each of them on the achievement.”\n\n“It is amazing to see the breadth of talent from young artists like Ed Sheeran to music legend Kate Bush, showcasing the very best of British.”"
