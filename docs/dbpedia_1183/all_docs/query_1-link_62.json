        "text": "We’re still a good two months away from Stone Temple Pilots‘ forthcoming self-titled, reunion LP, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get excited. Rock fans waiting for some real Scott Weiland action will be pleased to know a new single is right around the corner. How soon? Well, within a week or two most likely, as Spin unveiled a 30-second clip of the first radio digestible, “Between the Lines”, this morning.\n\nWith crunchy guitars that get stuck in your teeth and that Jim Morrison-esque fuzz that sounds like Purple-era Weiland, “…Lines” just might be the single every STP fan needs. Of course, it’s only 30 seconds, but we’ll stay optimistic — especially since Robert DeLeo insists it’s going to be a great STP record.\n\nUntil live cuts leak this weekend from Austin, TX, enjoy the 30 seconds here.\n\nStone Temple Pilots 2010 Tour Dates:\n\n03/18  Austin, TX @ Austin Music Hall (SXSW)\n\n03/19  Bossier City, LA @ Horseshoe Tavern\n\n03/20  Thackerville, OK @ WinStar Casino\n\n03/22  Kansas City, MO @ Midland Theatre\n\n03/24  Sioux City, IA @ Tyson Events Centre\n\n03/26  Milwaukee, WI @ Eagles Ballroom\n\n03/27  Chicago, IL @ Riviera Threatre\n\n03/30  Louisville, KY @ Palace Theater\n\n03/31  Detroit, MI @ The Fillmore"
