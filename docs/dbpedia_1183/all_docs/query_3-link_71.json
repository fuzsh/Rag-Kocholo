(Fox Business, 2021)\n\nRansomware projections\n\nRansomware is an ever-growing issue in the cybersecurity space and continues to shape the world today. Looking ahead, here are some statistics that cover the projections and future trends of ransomware.\n\nIn 2022, there will be more cooperation between countries to find, extradite and ultimately prosecute ransomware groups. (Forbes, 2022)\n\nRansomware will become the top tactic used in software supply chain attacks and third-party data breaches in 2022. (SC Media, 2022)\n\n30 percent of organizations will adopt Zero-Trustnetwork access (ZTNA) models by 2024. (Gartner, 2022)\n\n60 percent of organizations, along with investors and venture capitalists, will use cybersecurity risk as a key factor in assessing new business opportunities by 2025. (Gartner, 2022)\n\nRansomware attack trends\n\n2023 has already seen a steady rise in the number of cyberattacks and ransoms demanded by hackers. Below are some of the most visible trends in ransomware that have recently affected the cyber landscape.\n\nExploitation of IT outsourcing services\n\nRansomware groups have been shifting their focus to managed service providers (MSPs), a platform that serves many clients at once. This means that if a hacker gains access to one MSP, it could also reach the clients it’s serving as well. Most of the time, MSPs are hacked due to remote access tools that are poorly secured.\n\nAttention shifting to vulnerable industries\n\nDue to the ongoing economic, logistical, and financial implications of the pandemic, cyberattackers have been taking advantage of industries that have been hit the hardest, such as healthcare, municipalities, and educational facilities. Hackers also continue to see the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of employees who are now working remotely on their personal devices.\n\nEvolving ransomware strains (and defenses)\n\nIn 2023, ransomware and the tactics that hackers use to carry out attacks is evolving — but luckily, so are the defenses. In recent years, new ransomware strains have been discovered, including:\n\nRedAlert/N13V: The ransomware, which focused on non-Windows platforms, supported the halting of VMs in an ESXi environment, clearly indicating what the attackers were after.\n\nA new ransomware gang known asBlack Basta catapulted into operation in April of 2022, breaching at least 12 companies in just a few weeks.\n\nSource: SecureList\n\nBecause newer strains of ransomware behave differently today, there is now a need for alternate methods of detection. Defenses have recently begun to harden, including improved heuristics or behavioral analysis, and the use of canary or bait files for earlier detection.\n\nGreater spread to mobile devices\n\nHackers have been taking advantage of mobile device features such as emergency alerts and relaxed permissions to spread malware. The majority of mobile ransomware variants have the ability to cover every browser window or app with a ransom note, rendering the mobile device unusable.\n\nPrevalence of ransomware-as-a-service\n\nRansomware-as-a-service, or RaaS, is a subscription that allows affiliates to use ransomware tools that are already developed to carry out ransomware attacks and extend their reach. The decentralized nature of the attacks makes it difficult for authorities to shut down.\n\nThe creators of these tools take a percentage of each successful ransom payment; the average ransomware payout has increased dramatically, year to year – from $812,380 in 2022 to $1,542,333 in 2023.\n\nRansomware attack prevention\n\nEnsure you take the necessary steps to prevent an attack and data loss within your organization. Here are a few effective ways to prevent ransomware from affecting your company.\n\nEducate your employees\n\nUse security training within your company to help your employees gain a better understanding of cybersecurity and its importance. Implementing this training will help ensure a working culture that is even more resilient.\n\nAvoid clicking on suspicious links\n\nBe wary of opening or clicking on attachments or links that come from spam or unsolicited emails. According to Astra, phishing email statistics suggest that nearly 1.2 percent of all emails sent are malicious, meaning for every 4,200 emails sent, one would certainly be a phishing scam email. To avoid this, it’s beneficial to know how to spot a phishing scam.\n\nUse email and endpoint protection\n\nBe sure to scan all emails, filter malicious attachments and links, and keep firewalls and endpoint detection software up to date with the latest malware signatures. You should also notify users of out-of-network emails and provide VPNs for employees to use outside of the network.\n\nImplement a stronger password system\n\nPassword security is crucial when protecting the assets of a company. Use two-factor authentication within your organization to prevent password sharing and overuse of the same password. It may also be beneficial to use an SSO system for additional security.\n\nKeep immutable, offsite backups\n\nMake sure you have backups of any important or sensitive data and systems. Practice your restore motion in the event of a ransomware strike. Limit access to backups, as ransomware gangs often target backup files to cripple your ability to restore.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that backups cannot help in cases where the ransomware actor has also exfiltrated the data to their own servers and threatened to release that data publicly unless the ransom is paid. To combat exfiltration, consider data loss prevention software.\n\nMitigating the impact of ransomware\n\nReduce your blast radius\n\nYour blast radius is the amount of damage that can be caused by compromising a single random user or device. Reduce your blast radius by limiting access to critical data so that only those who require access have it.\n\nImplement a Zero-Trust security model\n\nAssume your perimeter defenses will fail and make sure everything within is still safe and secure. The Zero-Trust security model requires you to authenticate all users and devices that connect to your network every time they connect, not just once. You must also monitor activity in your environment and ensure users only have access to what they need and nothing else.\n\nUse UEBA for threat detection and response\n\nYou should continually monitor for and alert to telltale signs of ransomware activity on your data. Use user and entity behavior analysis tools to detect and alert when users or devices behave abnormally and implement automatic responses to stop threats in their tracks.\n\nRansomware statistics FAQ\n\nBelow are a few of the most frequently asked ransomware questions, with answers supported by additional ransomware statistics and facts.\n\nQ: What is the average length of impact after a ransomware attack?\n\nA: As of the second quarter of 2022, the average length of interruption after ransomware attacks at businesses and organizations in the United States was 24 days. (Statista, 2023)\n\nQ: How many industries are hit by ransomware attacks?\n\nA: As of 2022, around 70 percent of businesses worldwide were affected by ransomware attacks. This represented an increase from the previous five years and was the highest figure reported. (Statista, 2023)\n\nQ: What is the average payout for ransomware?\n\nA: Ransomware payments have nearly doubled to $1.5 million over the past year, with the highest-earning organizations the most likely to pay attackers. (The Guardian, 2023)\n\nQ: What is the average payout for small businesses?\n\nA: Smaller businesses are impacted less than bigger companies. However, the average payout for a small business is around $5,900. (Datto)\n\nQ: Do I have to pay for a ransomware attack?\n\nA: The FBI does not support paying a ransom because it does not guarantee that you or your company will have the data returned to you. Paying ransoms can also encourage the attacker to go after additional victims.\n\nRansomware is not going away any time soon — as an organization, it’s important to stay ahead of cyber criminals and take the steps to become more cyber aware.\n\nLearn how to protect your business and gauge your readiness for a potential ransomware attack with a free ransomware preparedness assessment.\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nBelow are three ways you can continue your journey to reduce data risk at your company:\n\n1\n\nSchedule a demo with us to see Varonis in action.
