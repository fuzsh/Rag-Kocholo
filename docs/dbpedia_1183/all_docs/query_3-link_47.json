        "text": "August 7, 2024 –\n\nThe next in a series for the Big Five athletic teams looking back at the bright, shining stars of the 2023-24 season.\n\nWe will name a team of the year and student athlete of the year for each school. In addition, we will list an honor roll of teams and student athletes. Team recognition will be noted by a championship, postseason advancement, and / or a significant achievement. To be named as a player one should have a national award or honor, a league accolade, significant achievement, or a team record.\n\nLet’s take a look back at the past season at Franklin Field, The Palestra, from Penn Park to Meiklejohn, from Weightman Gymnasium to the Tse Center, the Hecht Tennis Center, Sheerr Pool, and the Squash Center for the University of Pennsylvania. And give these teams and athletes a “Hurrah for the Red and Blue!”\n\nTeam of the Year\n\nWomen’s Track and Cross Country\n\nThe runners on the women’s teams had a banner year with league championships and personal records set. And one runner going to Paris as part of the United States Olympic Track and Field team.\n\nThe cross country year culminated with the Red and Blue taking third place in the NCAA Mid-Atlantic Regional with Olivia Morganti leading the way for her team. She placed 5th with a time of 19:50.2. Maeve Stiles was 8th covering the distance in 19:57.1. It was the first sub-20-minute time in the 6k race, and the top in program history. Lily Murphy was in 20th place.\n\nIn the outdoor season there was success in the Penn Relays and the Heptagonal Outdoor Track & Field Championships. Coach Steve Dolan was awarded with the Ivy Women’s Coach of the Year.\n\nMorganti got things started on a positive note winning the 3000m Steeplechase at the Penn Relays in a program record time of 9:57.94 to be the first individual titlist for the Quakers since 2019. The Sprint Medley Relay team beat the school record by more than 10 seconds running a 3:42.32 in getting third place.\n\nThe team won the Ivy League championship at the Heptagonal meet. In record times Penn won the 4×400 gold in a meet record time of 8:36.97. Monaya Kassim, Jocelyn Niemiec, Amelia Kristen, and Aliya Garozzo ran in Red and Blue stripes. Penn placed first and second in the 100m dash as Fore Abinusawa (11.38) won the event, then a personal record,and Christiana Nwachuku (11.55) placed second her best ever time. Abinusawa set her collegiate mark of 11.28 at the NCAA East Region First Round. Personal records at the Heps fell as the Quakers swept the podium in the 200m, as the top two had their personal best times. Whittaker ran a 23.18, Abinusawa 23.24, while Nwachuku turned in a 23.85 effort. The 400m record was rewritten as 51.38 is the then standard in a gold medal performance by Isabella Whittaker. She would set her new record at the NCAA Championships at :50.17. Garozzo set a personal best of 13.52 in the 100m Hurdles preliminaries, then won the event in 13.59. Morganti won the 300m Steeplechase, Bronwyn Patterson the 800m, and the 4×100 team (Daniella Oyenuga, Whittaker, Abinusawa, and Caia Gelli), stood atop the podium, but did not set a new personal best.\n\nWhittaker’s finish in the 400m put 4 points on the team scoreboard for the Red and Blue.\n\nAt the United States Olympic Track and Field Trials, Whittaker and Garozzo ran in the finals in their events. Neither athlete qualified by their finish, but Whittaker was named to the team as a pool relay runner in Paris.\n\nStudent Athletes of the Year\n\nIsabella Whittaker, Women’s Track & Field, 400m Other Sprints and Relays\n\nThe record book for Penn and Isabella Whittaker was rewritten in the 2024 indoor and outdoor season as the senior set or took part in setting program records for the Red and Blue. Although she did not win individual titles, Whittaker performed impressively and was named to the United States Olympic Track and Field team as a pool runner for relays at the Games in Paris. There are 8 program records that Whittaker has her name attached to in the school record book from the 2024 season. She owns the record in the Indoor 500 (1:10.12, an Ivy League record), Outdoor 200 (23.18). Her time of :50.17 in the Outdoor 400 was set at the NCAA Championship final where she finished behind 4 Arkansas runners in a super sweep, saving her best for last in Red and Blue stripes. She put 4 points on the team scoreboard for the Quakers. In the Outdoor 200 Whittaker is at the top of the list running a 23.18. As part of a relay team Whittaker was on a record setting team in the Outdoor 4×100 (:43.74), Indoor 4×400 (3:29.86), and the Outdoor4x400 (3:29.29). All three relays time broke the Ivy League record. She was also on the Outdoor Sprint Medley Reay team that ran the fastest Penn time of 3:42.32). An impressive season with maybe more records to be set by the runner form Laurel, Maryland.\n\nMatthew Fallon, Men’s Swimming, Breaststroke\n\nAn outstanding year for Fallon is earned a spot on the United States Olympic team in the 200 Breaststroke where he is a medal considered swimmer. During the season Fallon placed second in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:48.48 which set an Ivy and school record at that time. He won the 200-meter event at the TYR Pro Swim Series to ready himself for the Olympic Trials. Fallon became the first Penn swimmer to break the American 200m Breast record with an event winning time 2:06.54. This is the fastest time in the world to this point and won the race by over two seconds. Fallon swam a time of 2:07.39 in the event semifinals. He competed in Paris against the best in the world.\n\nTeam Honor Roll\n\nBaseball\n\nThe team made the Ivy League Championships, but a second game loss forced Penn to the elimination bracket. One more loss and the season would come to an end. The #4 Quakers fought back and won the Ivy League. Following a win over top seeded Columbia in the opening round, the Red and Blue lost to Cornell. In an elimination game the Quakers would defeat archrival Princeton later that day. The Quakers moved on, the Tigers did not. To get the title the Red and Blue would need to defeat the Big Red two more times. They did by scores of 11 – 9 and 12 – 6 on the same day. Penn won the title for the second consecutive year, the only team accomplishing that feat in the Ivy League. Wyatt Henseler was named the Most Outstanding Player posting a .375 tournament batting average (9 –for-24) with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs. Infielder Connor Chavez, who batted .429 hitting a home run, 3 doubles, 6 RBIs, and scored 8 times and was on the All-Tournament team along with outfielder Ryan Taylor (.412, 8 RBIs, and 3 extra base hits), and pitcher Cole Zaffiro (Game 6 winning pitcher). Marty Coyne was the winning pitcher in the championship game. The team headed to Charlottesville to play in the NCAA Tournament Regional. Penn lost to Virginia and St. John’s to end the season with a 24 – 25 record.\n\nFive Quakers would hit over .300 this season; Henseler (the offensive star with a .360 average), Carson Ozmer (.328), Davis Baker (.319), Nick Spaventa (.318), and Taylor (.308). Zaffiro posted a 5 – 5 record on the mound while Eli Trop had an ERA of 3.33 in 21 appearances.\n\nMen’s Soccer\n\nThe team would go undefeated over their last 7 regular season games to earn their second consecutive league championship and the number one seed in the Ivy League Tournament. Coach Brain Gill was named the Ivy League Coach of the Year. Over the campaign defenseman Leo Burney, goalie Nick Christoffersen, and midfielder Michael Hewes all made the Ivy League first team. The Quakers were solid on defense this season allowing 12 goals over 16 games for .75 goals against average, tops in the conference.\n\nBurney is on the USC All-Northeast First Team. He led the team in minutes with 1,440 by doing so many things that do not show on the stat sheet. Penn surrendered 168 total shots, 62 that required a save. He is a Soccer Six All-Star, CSC All-District, USC All-Northeast Regions first team, and all-ECAC second team honoree. Burney scored one goal this season, a bicycle kick in the Ivy League Semifinal.\n\nHewes scored 8 goals and assisted twice. He scored a hat trick against #14 Penn State. Two of his goals were game winners. Hewes made the Philadelphia Soccer Six All-Star team, USC All-Northeast Region team, CSC All-District, and All-ECAC second teams. His season was highlighted by a hat trick in the 3 – 0 win at the ranked #14 Penn State.\n\nLeading the Quakers offense with 20 points (6 goals and a team-leading 8 assists) is forward Stas Korzeniowski. The offensive points ranked second in the league. He is also a Soccer Six All-Star and is an All-Northeast Second teamer.\n\nThe season ended in the Ivy League semifinal where the Red and Blue lost to Brown on a game decided by Penalty Kicks. The closing record stood at 7 – 3 – 6 overall and 4 – 1 – 2 in the Ancient Eight.\n\nMen’s Squash\n\nNational Champions as the team brought home the Potter Cup for the first time in school history. Second ranked Penn defeated Trinity 7 – 1 in the CSA National Collegiate Team Championship match. The Quakers lost to the Bantoms earlier in the season but won the big stage match. Salman Khalil, Omar Hafez, Nathan Kueh, Abdelrahman Dweek, Varun Chitturi, Dana Santry defeated their opponent. Roger Baddour and Rehan Luthra (whose win was not counted in the team total score) won by default. Garnering All-Ivy honors were Hafez and Nick Spizzirri while Khalil earned the league Rookie of the Year honor. Each of three team members are All-Americans. Overall, the team went 15 – 2 and 5 – 1 in the Ivy League. The team shared the league title with Princeton.\n\nWomen’s Gymnastics\n\nThe Quakers are three-time champions! Penn won the Gymnastics East Conference Championships for the third consecutive year under Coach Kirsten Becker, and seventh time overall. The Red and Blue, led by Skyelar Kerico, scored a season-high 196.275 points, saving their best at the biggest time. Penn scored 49 points or higher on three rotations.\n\nPenn earned the ‘treble’ winning the Ivy Classic, GEC Regular Season, and the GEC Championship title.\n\nStudent Athletes Honor Roll\n\nWyatt Henseler – Baseball Third Baseman\n\nThe third baseman ended his Penn career with a flourish being named the Ivy League Player\n\nUnanimously and the league tournament Most Outstanding Player. Henseler batted a team-leading .360 batting average overall and added team-bests with 22 home runs (a single-season league record), 64 runs, 72 hits, 56 RBIs, and 151 total bases.

This season Hosley ran for 723 yards on 121 carries, second in the league, and scored 7 touchdowns, third in the Ancient Eight. With 246 receiving yards, he totaled 969 all-purpose yards. Hosley made a statement in the game against Cornell when he gained 261 yards, third place in total rushing yards in a single game in program history.
