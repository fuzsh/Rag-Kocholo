        "text": "Jersey City is home to its own charismatic power pop king in Jonny Couch. His songs and persona are synonymous with fun, and he definitely brings a certain vital spirit to his music. If you’ve had the opportunity to catch him performing live at any number of local establishments, then I think you know what I mean. In 2022, he released a duo of catchy singles, “Found Out You’re A Zombie” and “Long Lost Daze of Romance,” but he’s been keeping fans on their toes as far as new music goes. Until now.\n\nCouch’s latest single, “Sweet Charlene,” has all the fixings needed for a sweet, bubble-gummy power pop tune. The lyrics, which focus on the elusive Charlene and a young man’s unfailing devotion to her, are coupled with the punchy guitar stylings of Jody Porter of Fountains of Wayne. It fits nicely alongside other notable love-themed pop songs in the Couch catalog, including “Upside Down,” “Irrational Hearts,” and “Vertigo.”\n\nThe video for “Sweet Charlene” was shot at several locations in Jersey City, including Barcade and Decarlos. It stars two local artists, Vince Defazio and Kelly Sullivan. Check it out below!"
