        "text": "There has been a lot of chatter about whether pop songs are getting shorter lately. Music fans, musicians and publications all seem to be talking about the increasingly popular format, with Swedish pop star Tove Styrke recently complaining she’s “sick of everything being the exact same formula” because “everything is 2:30”.\n\nFrom established acts such as Harry Styles to breakthrough artists such as R&B singer Chloe Bailey, artists do seem to be keeping their songs lean and mean as we hurtle into the summer of 2022. But why? With the cultural dominance of music streaming and short-form social media such as TikTok, are we all forgetting how to concentrate for more than three minutes at a time?\n\nResearch conducted by Microsoft has found that our attention span has indeed reduced from 12 seconds in 2000 to eight seconds in 2015. While that may be true, it doesn’t entirely explain this dramatic shift in the length of pop hits. But to understand the reasons behind song formats changing so much over the years, we first have to look back through history.\n\nData scientists from UCLA have tracked the reduction in song lengths back to 1990 – average duration four minutes and 19 seconds – using information taken from a 160K Spotify tracks dataset. They report that from 1930 to 1990 “there was a steady increase in mean song duration (3 minutes 15 seconds to 4 minutes 19 seconds),” and that in 2020, lengths of new releases on Spotify came in at 3 minutes and 17 seconds. A study by Manchester-based digital label Ostereo found that the average duration of number one songs in the UK in 1998 was 4 minutes 16 seconds. In 2019, that average was down to 3 minutes and 3 seconds with 2018 being the year when the biggest drop occurred despite the lack of physical constraints on duration for digital releases. And pop song analysts Hit Songs Deconstructed have also shown that in the first three quarters of 2021, 37 per cent of all USA Hot 100 Top 10 hits came in at less than 3 minutes.\n\nThe clue as to why is that radio programmers and streaming services are both interested in “market share” and are looking to hang onto their audiences by discouraging them from switching channels, or track-skipping in the case of streaming services. One way they’re trying to achieve this is by playlisting songs that have the “boring” bits taken out. In other words, artists are having to edit their songs down by cutting out introduction sections and simplifying choruses to maximise their playlisting and streaming potential.\n\nAs pop music started to emerge in the late 1940s, there was a correlation between the length of a song and the technical storage capacity of the media that housed it. In 1949, record company RCA Victor launched the seven-inch 45 revolutions per minute (rpm) single. This vinyl innovation allowed for song durations of roughly five minutes and by the 1960s with the rise of The Beatles, song durations of somewhere between two and a half and three and a half minutes were considered to be the norm.\n\nAs record mastering and cutting technologies improved through the decade and then into the 1970s, longer song lengths became more common. Columbia Records released the full six-minute version of Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone”, opening the doors for other tracks such as Queen’s iconic mini-rock opera “Bohemian Rhapsody” (5 minutes 55 seconds), The Beatles’ epic “Hey Jude” (7 minutes 11 seconds) and Richard Harris’ “MacArthur Park” (7 minutes 20 seconds). In the last 20 years, the number one hit with the longest duration was Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well” (Taylor’s Version) from 2021 (10 minutes and 8 seconds).\n\nBut it wasn’t just long songs that were successful in the halcyon pre-streaming pop decades. Adam Faith’s 1959 number one hit “What Do You Want?” is the shortest number one in UK Singles Chart history clocking in at a measly 1 minute 55 seconds. Influential minimalist post-punk band Wire’s debut studio album Pink Flag from 1977 had a generous 21 songs with the shortest, “Field Day for the Sundays” being only 28 seconds long and 13 other songs being of one minute 25 seconds-length or shorter.\n\nPop songwriting has changed fundamentally since the rise of streaming with the focus now being on songs being constructed from an endless succession of “hooks”, simple “ear-worms” that through repetition give the listener an easy route to song and artist brand recognition. According to Hit Songs Deconstructed, most hit songs are written by teams of five or more writers with “topliners” being drafted in to write those killer “hooks”. This modular approach to songwriting is very different to the methods used in the classic pop era of the 1960s and 70s when a song would take you on a melodic, harmonic and lyrical journey that would culminate at the chorus section in a joyous release of tension.\n\nThe recent success of Kate Bush’s hit from 1985 “Running Up That Hill” (4 minutes 59 seconds) seems to buck this trend towards shorter durations. The song has reached Number One on the UK and USA singles chart following its appearance in the latest season of Stranger Things, giving the reclusive artist her biggest ever global hit. Has its success been driven by nostalgia for a past that seemed simpler and better or are we simply getting bored with being bored and looking for a more enriching experience from our pop songs than many recent hits provide? With Harry Styles’ “As It Was” (2 minutes 47 seconds) also topping the charts at the moment, it seems that audiences want to have their cake and eat it, creating a pop diet that can contain both the fast food of Styles and Bad Bunny alongside Bush’s more nutritious fare."
