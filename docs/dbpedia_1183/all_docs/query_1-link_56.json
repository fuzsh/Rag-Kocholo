Home to eternally anxious masses, the surprising things also found in public spaces:\n\nPrivacy\n\nPersonal space\n\nReprieve from the heat of everything that makes you forget that you, and everyone else, are flesh and blood.\n\nWalking by night, breath and step in alternating time, and struggle to hold the disintegrating memory of what is outside this perfect architecture together."
