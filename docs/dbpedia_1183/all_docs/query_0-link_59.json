Quinn\n\nPart 1: Background\n\nAlthough mortality for cardiovascular disease (CVD) has declined for several decades, heart disease and stroke continue to be the leading causes of death, disability and high healthcare costs. Unhealthy behaviors related to CVD risk (e.g., smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating habits) remain highly prevalent. The high rates of overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the persistent presence of uncontrolled hypertension, lipid levels not at target, and approximately 18% of adults who continue to smoke cigarettes pose a formidable challenge for achieving improved cardiovascular health.1,2 It is apparent that the performance of healthful behaviors related to the management of CVD risk factors has become an increasingly important facet of the prevention and management of CVD.3\n\nIn 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) made a transformative shift in their strategic plan and added the concept of cardiovascular (CV) health.2 To operationalize this concept, the Association targeted four health behaviors in the 2020 Strategic Impact Goals, reduction in smoking and weight, healthful eating, and promoting regular physical activity. Three health indicators also were included: glucose, blood pressure (BP), and cholesterol. Based on the AHA Life’s Simple 7 metrics for improved CV health, less than one percent of adults in the US follow a healthful eating plan, only 32% have a normal body mass index (BMI) and over 30% have not reached the target levels for lipids or BP. NHANES data revealed that persons who met six or more of the CV health metrics had a significantly better risk profile (hazard ratio of 0.49 for all-cause mortality), compared to individuals who had achieved only one metric or less.2 The studies reviewed in this statement targeted these behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity, healthful eating, and maintaining a healthful weight) and CV health indicators (e.g., blood glucose, lipids, BP, BMI) as the primary outcomes in the clinical trials testing mobile health (mHealth) interventions.\n\neHealth, or digital health, is the use of emerging communication and information technologies, especially the use of the internet to improve health and health care.4 mHealth, a subsegment of eHealth, is the use of mobile computing and communication technologies (e.g., mobile phones, wearable sensors) for health services and information.4,5 mHealth technology uses techniques and advanced concepts from an array of disciplines, e.g., computer science, electrical and biomedical engineering, and medicine and health-related sciences.6 Mobile devices that permit collection of data in real time are increasingly ubiquitous, enabling researchers to assess multiple behaviors in various contexts and thus inform the development of interventions to prompt behavior change. Technology-supported behavioral health interventions are designed to engage individuals in health behaviors that prevent or manage illness, and they have led to fundamental changes in health practices.7 In addition to permitting more frequent and convenient community-based assessment of health parameters, these technology-mediated tools support exchange of health information among consumers and between consumers and health providers, enable health decision-making, and encourage positive health behaviors including self-management and health promotion.8,9 Consequently, mobile health technologies are becoming more prevalent, and their use will continue to grow,10 consistent with the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) call to increase the design and testing of health technologies.11\n\nThe ubiquity of mobile devices presents the opportunity to improve health outcomes through the delivery of state-of-the-art medical and health services with information and communication technologies.12 Due to their diverse capabilities and advanced computing features, smartphones are often considered pocket computers.6 In addition to these devices that can inform and communicate, there are wearable sensors, which can be worn for short or extended periods and monitor activity or physiological changes (e.g., exercise, heart rate, sleep). These sensors can provide data in real time or save the data to a device for later uploading and review.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a public health responsibility to oversee the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. However, these apply only to applications (apps) that are accessory to regulated medical devices (e.g., ones that diagnose a condition). Many mobile apps are not medical devices, meaning they do not meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)), and FDA does not regulate them. Some mobile apps may meet the definition of a medical device but because they pose a lower risk to the public, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion over these devices. Most of the mHealth apps on the market at this time fit into these two categories.13,14\n\nNumerous innovations in health information technology are empowering individuals to assume a more active role in monitoring and managing their chronic conditions and therapeutic regimens as well as their health and wellness.15 These advances are increasingly accepted by the public.16 Unlike the initial digital divide that placed computer use and internet access beyond the reach of many older, disabled, and low-income individuals, mobile devices have been widely adopted across demographic and ethnic groups especially those most in need of health behavior interventions.17,18 This trend is confirmed in the 2014 statistics from the Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life Project that showed that 81% of households with an income above $75,000/year owned a smartphone and nearly half (47%) of those with an annual household income less than $30,000 owned a smartphone.19 The highest smartphone ownership was among Hispanic and African Americans, at 61% and 59%, respectively. Of those with phones who use the internet, 34% mostly use their phones, rather than a desktop or laptop, to access online programs.20\n\nMobile devices offer great promise for improving the health of the populous. Most smartphones include basic functionalities, e.g., video streaming, email, internet access and high quality imaging. These developments in wireless technology and the shift to mobile devices are demanding a re-examination of technology as it currently exists within the healthcare infrastructure.6 However, the pace of science in evaluating these apps is incongruent with the business and industry sectors and the consumer demands. There are concerns that health-promoting smartphone apps being developed fail to incorporate evidence-based content and that rigorous testing to provide efficacy data is trailing behind their adoption.21–24 However, a systematic review of the literature suggests a positive impact of consumer health informatics tools on select health conditions, e.g., there were intermediate outcomes such as knowledge, adherence, self-management and change in behaviors related to healthful eating, exercise and physical activity, but not obesity.25 Another review suggests that smartphone apps are useful tools at the point of care and in mobile clinical communication as well as in remote patient monitoring and self-management of disease.26\n\nRecent papers have reviewed the latest technological advances in digital social networks related to health27 and wireless devices for cardiac monitoring.28 What is missing in the scientific literature is a report on the health-related mobile technologies specifically focused on CVD prevention. In particular, it is important to investigate the degree to which these CVD focused technologies include best content and have been evaluated for their effectiveness. In the absence of such data, clinicians may be hesitant to recommend or endorse any program to their patients and thereby potentially miss an opportunity to improve their engagement in healthful behaviors.\n\nThe aims of this scientific statement are to: 1) review the literature on mHealth tools available to the consumer in the prevention of CVD (e.g., dietary self-monitoring apps, physical activity and BP monitors), 2) provide the current evidence on the use of the vast array of mobile devices such as use of mobile phones for communication and feedback, smartphone apps, wearable sensors or physiologic monitors that are readily available and promoted to the public for monitoring their health, and 3) provide recommendations for future research directions. The goal is to provide the clinician and researcher a review of the current evidence on using mHealth tools and devices when targeting behavior change and CV risk reduction as well as improved CV health. The paper is divided into sections by the behaviors or health indicators included in the AHA’s Simple 7 program, e.g. achieving a healthful weight, improving physical activity, quitting smoking, achieving blood glucose control, managing BP and also lipids to achieve target levels. Within each section, the recent evidence for studies using mHealth approaches are reviewed, the gaps identified and directions for future research are provided.\n\nWhile the majority of studies reported on the use of mobile devices, e.g., basic mobile phones that support the use of text messaging (SMS) or smartphones that provide internet access, several reported on interventions delivered via the internet, e.g., studies reporting on increased physical activity or blood pressure management. The writing group made the decision to include these studies as there is an increasingly greater proportion of people accessing the internet via mobile devices, as noted in a Pew report in February 2014, 68% of adults access the internet with mobile devices.29 This figure has likely increased in the past year. Moreover, in some of the designated areas of cardiovascular risk, there were few studies reporting on the use of mHealth supported interventions.\n\nPart 2: Review of the scientific literature on mHealth tools related to CVD prevention\n\nSearch strategy.\n\nWe conducted a literature search that included the following terms: mHealth; mobile health; mobile phone; mobile device; mobile technology; mobile communication; mobile computer; mobile PC; cell phone; cellular phone; cellular telephone; handheld computer; handheld device; handheld technology; handheld PC; hand held computer; hand held device; hand held technology; hand held PC; tablet device; tablet computer; tablet technology; tablet PC; smartphone; smart phone; iPad; Kindle; Galaxy; iPhone; Blackberry; iPod; Bluetooth; short message service; SMS; pocket PC; pocketPC; PDA; personal digital assistant; Palm Pilot; Palmpilot; smartbook; mobile telephone; messaging service; MP3 player; portable media player; podcast; email; e-mail; electronic mail; electronic message. Search terms used within the technology or clinical topic (e.g., diabetes) groups were divided with OR, while the search terms between the technology and clinical topic were connected with AND. Within each subsection the key terms used in the search for a given clinical topic are identified. The search was limited to the last 10 years (2004 – 2014) and studies reported in the English language. We limited our review to studies enrolling adults, except for smoking cessation where we included adolescents. We included studies conducted in the U.S. and in developed countries. We also briefly discuss key systematic reviews or meta-analyses in each topic area, except in management of dyslipidemia.\n\nUse of mHealth to Improve Weight Management\n\nObesity causes or contributes to a myriad of physical and mental health conditions, such as CVD, T2DM and depression, which either individually or collectively, represent the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US.30–32 Over 35% of US adults ages ≥20 years are obese33 and more than 1 in 4 Americans have multimorbidity,34,35 which is associated with high healthcare use and costs, functional impairment, poor quality of life, psychological distress, and premature death.36–40 Sustained weight loss of 3–5% can delay or possibly prevent T2DM41,42 and significantly improve CVD risk factors (e.g., abnormal glucose, elevated blood pressure).43–46 However, effective treatments for obesity that are accessible to consumers, affordable for diverse socioeconomic groups, and scalable at a population level are lacking.\n\nThe 2013 obesity treatment guideline by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and Obesity Society recommended that clinicians advise overweight and obese individuals who would benefit from weight loss to participate for ≥6 months in a comprehensive lifestyle program characterized by a combination of a reduced-calorie intake, increased physical activity, and behavioral strategies.47 The guideline panelists found evidence of moderate strength supporting the efficacy of electronically-delivered, comprehensive lifestyle programs that include personalized feedback from a trained interventionist, defined as programs delivered to participants by internet, email, mobile texting, or similar electronic means. Therefore, it was recommended that electronically-delivered interventions are an acceptable alternative to in-person interventions, although it was recognized that the former may result in smaller weight loss than the latter.\n\nUse of mHealth in Weight Management Interventions.\n\nThis review is limited to technology-supported lifestyle behavioral interventions for weight loss. Readers are referred to numerous systematic reviews of more traditional internet-, email-, and telephone-based lifestyle interventions for weight loss.48–53 Overall, weight management interventions have employed a range of mobile technologies,50,54–58 including short message service (SMS), smartphone applications, handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs), and interactive voice response (IVR) systems.56,59,60 Numerous network-connected devices have also been used,50,54 including e-scales and wireless physical activity monitoring devices61. Use of mobile devices and their functionality (e.g., SMS and multimedia messaging service [MMS], mobile internet, and software apps in weight loss interventions have increased exponentially in recent years. In this section, we focus on the latest evidence on mobile technology interventions for weight loss.\n\nWith few exceptions,62 most interventions have used a single, pre-determined technology channel and did not give participants the option of either choosing between channels or using multiple channels simultaneously (which has become commonplace for commercial applications). Most technologies have been created in research settings, although at least one published study used a commercially available app.61 The majority of these trials were primarily focused on efficacy testing and it was unclear whether these interventions used strategies designed to promote user engagement (e.g., employing established design principles, conducting usability testing, and/or undergoing iterative development and testing). Additionally, a key translational challenge is that many commercial apps have not been tested empirically, and many apps with empirical data are not commercially available.\n\nReview of evidence for efficacy of mHealth-based weight loss interventions.\n\nWe conducted an electronic literature search using Medline (PubMed), CINAHL, and PsychInfo in June 2014 and extended back to 2004. Search terms for this topic included: Overweight; obese; obesity; body mass; adiposity; adipose; weight loss; weight gain. Only original studies with human subjects with a primary outcome of weight loss and published in English were included. Of 184 references identified, 169 were excluded based on the review of title (n=19), abstract (n=121), and full text (n=29). Fourteen references were eligible for this review, including 10 studies conducted among US adults, and 2 among adults outside of the US.\n\nincludes the studies reviewed and provides details regarding study design, intervention, sample characteristics and primary outcomes. Five of the 8 US RCTs63–67 reported significantly more weight loss in the intervention group than in the control or comparison group. The testing and use of mobile technologies varied a great deal and combinations of mHealth components and tools were often very specific to a particular study. Five investigators used text messaging63,66,68–70 in studies that ranged from 8 weeks to one year in duration. Patrick permitted the participant to set the frequency of the SMS (25 times/day) and found a significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at four months while Napolitano observed better weight loss in the Facebook + SMS than the Facebook alone group at 8weeks.66 Only one study68, which used SMS and MMS 4 times/day in a 12-month study, did not observe a significant difference in weight loss. Two of the SMS studies were conducted outside of the US. Carter observed better weight loss at 6 months in the group receiving SMS and Haapala demonstrated similar results at 12 months. While none of the US studies using SMS reported positive findings beyond nine months, the Finnish study69 showed that a SMS intervention could result in significantly greater weight loss than no intervention for up to 12 months.\n\nTable 1\n\nStudy Cited, Design, Outcome, Setting, Quality RatingSample Characteristics, Group Size, Baseline BMI, Study RetentionStudy Groups & ComponentsTechnology usedIntervention Duration, # of\n\nIntervention Contacts, Intervention\n\nAdherence, InterventionistPrimary Outcome: Mean Weight Loss (kg, kg/m2, or % change)Haapala et al, 200969\n\nDesign: 2-group RCT\n\nOutcome: wt.Δ and waist circumference Δ\n\nSetting: Community\n\nCountry: FinlandN = 125\n\nInt1: n = 62\n\nInt2: n = 63\n\nWomen: 77.4%\n\nMean age (SD):\n\nInt1: 38.1 (4.7) yrs.\n\nInt2: 38.0 (4.7) yrs.\n\nBMI:\n\nInt1: 30.6 (2.7) kg/m2\n\nInt2: 30.4 (2.8) kg/m2\n\nRetention:\n\nInt1: 73%\n\nInt2: 65%Int1: SMS (for personalized feedback) and study website (for tracking and information)\n\nDiet: cut down on unnecessary food intake and alcohol\n\nPA: increase daily physical activity Behavior: self-mon and reporting of wt. via SMS or study website\n\nInt2: Wait list control\n\nNo InterventionMobile phone, SMS, study websiteDuration: 1year Contacts:\n\nInt1: Real-time when participants reported wt. via text messaging\n\nInt2: No intervention contact\n\nIntervention Adherence:\n\nMean number (SD) of wt. reporting via SMS or study website per week 3 mos.\n\nInt1: 8.2 (4.0) 6 mos.\n\nInt1: 5.7 (4.6) 9 mos.\n\nInt1: 3.7 (3.5) 12 mos.\n\nInt1: 3.1 (3.5)\n\nInterventionist:\n\nInt1: Automated\n\nInt2: NAITT (LOCF) 12 mos.\n\nwt.Δ, kg, M (SD)\n\nInt1: −3.1 (4.9) Int2: −0.7 (4.7) p = .008\n\nWaist Circumference Δ, cm, M (SD)\n\nInt1: −4.5 (5.3)\n\nInt2: −1.6 (4.5)\n\np = .002Patrick et al., 200963\n\nDesign: 2-group RCT\n\nOutcome: wt.

Only the armband plus group intervention achieved significantly greater weight loss than the self-directed control group at 9 months. Two investigators71 used PDAs for self-monitoring. Burke delivered daily, tailored feedback messages via the PDA to one of the groups and found no difference in weight loss at 2 years while Spring delivered personalized feedback by phone and observed significantly different weight loss at 6 months but the effect was not sustained at 12 months.\n\nTurner-McGrievy et al.64 reported that a theory-based podcast delivered via MP3 players or computers led to significantly greater weight loss than a non-theory-based weight loss podcast at 12 weeks. Building on this study, the investigators72,73 conducted a follow-up study to compare the incremental effect of adding to the theory-based podcast mobile apps for self-monitoring and communication with a health coach and group members. However, the addition did not result in significantly greater weight loss than the podcast alone at 6 months.72,73\n\nTwo adult RCTs were conducted outside of the US (see ). The 6-month UK study70 compared a self-directed smartphone app for goal setting and self-monitoring plus automated tailored feedback via text messaging with a website control and a paper diary control. Compared to the two other groups, the smartphone group achieved significantly greater mean weight loss at 6 months. The 1-year Finish study69 was the only mobile technology intervention reviewed in the 2013 AHA/ACC obesity treatment guideline. It tested a weight loss intervention via text messaging for instructions, self-monitoring, and automated personalized feedback vs. a no-intervention control group among overweight or obese adults. While none of the US adult studies reported positive findings beyond 9 months, the Finish study showed that a text messaging intervention could result in significantly greater weight loss than no intervention up to 12 months (i.e., intermediate term).\n\nAlso include in is the only meta-analysis56 to date that focused on text messaging interventions for weight loss and showed that the pooled mean weight change was significantly better in intervention participants than in the control conditions. However, both intervention and control subgroups were heterogeneous and the funnel plot suggested a possible publication bias.\n\nKhaylis and colleagues identified 5 key components to efficacious technology-based weight loss interventions: use of a structured program, self-monitoring, feedback and communication, social support, and individual tailoring.59 These components were found in the mobile technology interventions shown to produce greater weight loss than a randomized control group, although the extent and nature of the implementation of each component varied across studies. Additionally, all of the effective mobile interventions focused on calorie-reduced healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavior change, which is consistent with the 2013 AHA/ACC guideline recommendation for comprehensive behavioral weight loss interventions.47 Evidence from the reviewed RCTs suggests that these technologies may be effective when used alone or in conjunction with traditional weight loss intervention delivery modalities (e.g., telephonic coach feedback or in-person group sessions or websites) to achieve modest weight loss of clinical significance in the short term.\n\nRecommendations for consumers and healthcare practitioners.\n\nDuring the past decade, the mHealth field has made great strides developing efficacious mobile weight loss approaches. Indeed, mobile interventions can produce weight loss in motivated populations, albeit at a lower magnitude relative to traditional treatment approaches. The characteristics of successful mobile interventions are quite comparable to their offline counterparts: the largest weight losses are produced by comprehensive, multicomponent interventions that are personally tailored, promote regular self-monitoring, and involve a qualified interventionist.59 The accumulated evidence, while limited, supports intervention delivery through a range of technology channels (including web, SMS, e-mail, telephone, and IVR), with limited variability in the magnitude of weight loss outcomes.\n\nStandard behavioral weight loss treatment is delivered by a trained healthcare professional to promote calorie-controlled healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavior change in in-person group or individual sessions of a prescribed frequency and duration. It is encouraging that sufficient evidence derived mainly from studies of internet-, email-, and telephone-based interventions has accrued to buttress the 2013 AHA/ACC obesity treatment guideline recommending electronically-delivered comprehensive weight loss programs encompassing personalized coach feedback as an acceptable, albeit possibly less effective, alternative to standard in-person treatment.\n\nOur review finds that self-monitoring and automated personalized feedback are common features in the contemporary mobile weight loss interventions. Based on consistent findings from multiple RCTs of fair and good quality, the evidence is strong for short-term weight loss benefits in adults from text messaging interventions for self-monitoring and feedback when supported by other methods (e.g., coach phone calls, websites, or private peer groups via social media)63,66 or incorporated into an existing comprehensive lifestyle program,65 with some evidence suggesting sustained intervention effectiveness through 12 months.47 Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that SMSs as a stand-alone intervention are effective. One RCT in the UK showed the effectiveness of a self-directed smartphone app as a standalone intervention in overweight and obese adults,70 although the translatability of the results to US adults is unclear due to a lack of research.\n\nUntil more evidence emerges, health practitioners looking to implement or recommend mHealth interventions to their overweight and obese patients should ensure that programs and tools they recommend include established evidence-based content and components of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention (i.e., calorie-controlled healthy eating and increased physical activity with specified goals, and behavioral strategies) and facilitate adoption of evidence-based weight loss behaviors (e.g., self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and social support from coaches or peers). In the context of these programs, mobile technologies, in particular SMS/MMS messaging and smartphone apps, may be the primary intervention modality while supported by other methods (e.g., websites or phone calls). At present, no recommendations can be made for US consumers regarding the effectiveness of text messaging as a stand-alone intervention for weight loss or the effectiveness of any particular smartphone app.\n\nGaps and Recommendations for Future Research.\n\nThere is great need for studies that explore mobile interventions in diverse contexts, particularly general consumer samples and in clinical practice settings. While great strides have been made, we do not have answers to the questions that consumers are most likely to ask: whether commercial mobile weight loss apps are efficacious. We know little about the efficacy of the more than 1000 apps that purport to help consumers lose weight. Moreover, few, if any, research-tested apps have been widely disseminated or commercialized. Academic-industry partnerships are needed from the intervention development stage through formative evaluation to confirmatory research and then dissemination and implementation.\n\nThe research literature investigating mobile weight loss interventions remains in its infancy, with many important questions yet to be answered. Indeed, we know little about how to best integrate mobile interventions into the primary care setting, where they might serve as adjuncts to weight loss counseling delivered by primary care or other providers such as dietitians or nurses. There are potentially significant opportunities to explore the integration of mobile technologies, given health system changes associated with the Affordable Care Act and the 2011 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services decision to reimburse qualified providers for delivering intensive behavioral treatment for obesity. We need to also expand the range of populations that have been studied. Thus far, we know the least about those populations with the highest obesity rates, and who bear the greatest burden of obesity associated disease -- racial/ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.76 This fails to deliver on the promise of digital health approaches, which have potential for extending the reach of intervention approaches. Despite their higher levels of mobile phone ownership and utilization,77,78 early evidence suggests that high risk populations experience suboptimal weight losses,76 as is often observed with traditional treatment approaches.\n\nMore work is necessary to assess and improve the magnitude of weight loss outcomes produced by mobile interventions as well as long term maintenance of weight loss. A particular priority is identifying strategies to promote sustained user engagement. Indeed, across a large number of studies weight loss outcomes have been shown to be largely dependent on the level of participant engagement.53,62 Unfortunately declining engagement and attrition (often as high as 40–50%) are characteristic of digital health interventions.79 Mobile interventions developed in research settings might benefit from leveraging the iterative design and testing conventions that are commonly used in the commercial market to promote user engagement. Further, the most successful trials have combined interventionist support with a mobile intervention. We know much less about the efficacy of standalone mobile interventions, those that have the greatest potential for broad dissemination.\n\nAt present, there is considerable variability in the technologies, intervention components, design, and delivery schedules of mobile interventions. We know little about which technologies or intervention components, or combinations thereof, are best equipped to produce clinically meaningful weight loss. There does not appear to be substantial variability in the magnitude of weight loss outcomes in the mHealth approaches we reviewed. We have identified the following gaps and directions for future research:\n\nThe applications of mobile technology for weight loss have been limited in conceptualization and narrow in implementation. Future mobile technology weight loss interventions should build on the best evidence of the efficacious core components of comprehensive lifestyle programs.\n\nText messaging has been the primary delivery format researched to date; however, it is only one of a growing number of mobile delivery formats (e.g., smartphone apps, wearable sensors that synchronize data with smartphones). We need to address the many pitfalls in the current mHealth approaches, e.g., absence of theoretical basis, limited application of the best practices in technology design, low usage of empirically-supported behavioral strategies, and limited scientific rigor, by engaging in transdisciplinary collaboration and inclusion of the end-users, the clinicians and patients in all phases, from the intervention development to implementation.\n\nUse mixed methods research to elucidate the frequency, timing and duration of various mobile delivery formats which can enhance the usability and acceptability of technology.\n\nFuture work needs to focus on comparative effectiveness research using alternative designs, for example, equivalence and noninferiority trials. Also, we need to use more flexible study designs that are able to provide answers within a shorter time frame than the conventional 5-year clinical trial when testing a delivery mode that will become obsolete before the end of the trial.80\n\nFinally, we need to capitalize on the currently available technologies that permit collection and transmission of data in real time to better learn about the behaviors and moods of individuals in their natural setting, referred to as ecological momentary assessment, which can inform the development of interventions that can be delivered in real time and thus provide support when individuals are in need of it.81,82\n\nUse of mHealth Interventions to Increase Physical Activity\n\nRegular physical activity is important in improving cardiovascular health. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and the American Heart Association recommend that adults participate in 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week. 83According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans84, adults should avoid inactivity or extended periods of sedentary activity, do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly, and do muscle-strengthening activities on at least 2 days per week.85 Sustained physical activity has many health benefits, such as decreasing the risk for premature death, T2DM, stroke, some forms of cancer, osteoporosis, and depression.86 There is sufficient evidence that physical activity can help reduce CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure.86\n\nPhysical activity in the US has significantly declined over the past two decades. Since the late 1980s, the proportion of adult women who report no leisure-time activity has increased from 19.1% to 51.7% and the proportion of adult men reporting no leisure-time activity rose from 11.4% to 43.5%.87 The participation in leisure-time activity is lowest in African Americans, with over 55% not meeting the guidelines, followed by those identifying as Hispanic or Latino, with over 54% not meeting guidelines.88 Over 66% of those who have not completed high school do not meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.88\n\nReview of evidence for efficacy of mobile technology-based interventions to promote physical activity.\n\nWe searched PubMed using the terms physical activity; physically active; walk; aerobic; sport; lifestyle; sedentary. The literature search yielded 1490 studies. 1415 were excluded based on the review of title (n=797), abstract (n=528), or full text (n=122). Of the 122 that did not qualify based on full text review, articles were excluded for the following reasons: 44 were focused on diabetes, 39 on weight loss and 41 for not meeting RCT criteria. Therefore, 41 articles were eligible for the current review, 12 were literature reviews of physical activity for CVD prevention, 15 were studies validating technology, and 14 were RCTs that are detailed in . The literature search yielded studies reporting on numerous types of technology that can be used for increasing physical activity; texting or SMS messaging on mobile phone (n=3), pedometer (n=1), email (n=1), and internet (n=9). Several studies included a combination of technologies.\n\nNine of the 14 studies reported significant increases in physical activity in the intervention group when compared to the control condition.89–97 Overall, the technology that was used most often to increase physical activity was the internet through websites, online tutorials, or networking opportunities. Many of the programs that used the internet also used other forms of technology, including pedometers and feedback messages via email. Of the 9 studies that used the internet as the main intervention component, 5 reported significant differences between groups in increasing physical activity.89–91,93,94 The outcomes differed in each study and included step counts, increases in moderately vigorous physical activity (MVPA), increases in moderate physical activity, and minutes/week of physical activity. Two of the 14 studies examined the use of SMS,96,97 and both reported significant differences between the intervention and control or comparative conditions.96,97 Two additional studies reported testing the use of messages, either through a PDA or email and found significantly greater increases in physical activity in the intervention group compared to the control or non-intervention group.92,95\n\nA systematic review of 26 studies published in 2014 by Bort-Roig et al. examined the use of smartphones to influence physical activity.98 Only five studies in the review assessed interventions for physical activity and four reported an increase in steps/day. However, the studies were limited by small samples with only one study having a sample size greater than 50. A systematic review of 11 studies by Buchholz et al. in 2013 reported that fewer than 10 RCTs using SMS to target physical activity had been conducted across 7 countries and found that a small number of studies had examined the use of SMS for promotion of physical activity.99 The median effect size for differences in change scores between intervention and control groups for the studies was 0.50, but ranged from 0.20 to greater than 1.00. There was no evidence to suggest why there were such vast differences in the effect size.\n\nOne area that is growing in acceptance among consumers is active video gaming or exergaming. The studies using this technology had some methodological limitations and thus were not included in this review, however a systematic review by Peng et al., reported that laboratory studies have demonstrated that this technology is capable of providing light-to-moderate physical activity.100 However, only three studies in that review supported gaming as an effective tool to significantly increase physical activity or exercise attendance.\n\nMost mobile technology interventions that have been reported in the published literature allow users to self-monitor physical activity by manually entering exercise bouts or total accumulated activity. However, more technologically sophisticated approaches for physical activity monitoring are rapidly becoming widely available. Physical activity tracking devices, also referred to as “wearables”, have become highly prevalent among consumers for self-monitoring daily activity. Most of these devices include accelerometers that capture users’ duration and intensity of physical activity.101 Some devices also include GPS functionality that can capture the location of exercise sessions. Originally designed to be worn on the hip, wearables can now be placed comfortably in a range of locations (e.g., wrist, ankle, arm, shoe). The majority of modern smartphones similarly include accelerometers and gyroscopes, allowing them to provide functionality similar to wearable devices. A host of third-party software applications have emerged to leverage this technology and some mobile operating systems include physical activity tracking as a default functionality. There is emerging evidence that combining physical activity tracking devices with group behavioral treatments will produce larger weight loss outcomes than either the device, or group treatment alone.67\n\nGaps and Recommendations for Future Research.\n\nA large number of smartphone applications exist that are designed to monitor, track, and promote physical activity, as well as wearable devices (FitBit, JawBone) but none of these apps have been compared to the established methods of objectively measuring physical activity, such as accelerometers and thus have no empirical basis. Over 20% of US adults are tracking their health with some form of technology and 1 in 5 adults with a smartphone have at least one health application. The most popular health applications (38% of downloads) are those related to exercise, pedometer use, and heart rate monitoring.107 However, none of the studies identified in this review tested these wearable monitors. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies include the use of these commercially available devices in RCTs to determine their efficacy in improving physical activity. Since there is an absence of established accuracy and efficacy data for these consumer wearable devices, no guidelines exist on the use of these physical activity trackers. One study examining the accuracy and precision of these devices reported that most wearable devices yielded reasonably accurate reporting of energy expenditure, within about 10–15% error, when compared to a portable metabolic analyzer.108 Thus, rigorous RCTs with diverse populations are needed to establish an empirical basis for the use of the apps and mobile devices for improving physical activity or reducing sedentary activity.\n\nThe realm where there seems to have been a prolific explosion of wearable devices and trackers is physical activity; however, compared to some of the other health related areas, the research conducted to date is limited. The following list outlines the gaps and recommendations for future research in the area of mHealth interventions for promoting physical activity.\n\nLittle is known about the use of wearable consumer devices, although many adults are using this technology. Therefore, large scale randomized trials of diverse populations need to be conducted to test the effectiveness of this technology in increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behavior.\n\nHealth related apps are amongst the most popular downloads, yet are not being rigorously tested. Therefore, commercially available apps that are downloaded by the public need to be validated and examined for efficacy and acceptability, as well as sustainability of engagement. Only then can we provide the consumer with evidence for their use.\n\nSimilarly, additional testing is recommended on the use of exergaming to increase PA levels in both children and adults\n\nUse of the internet was the platform tested most often for the delivery of technology targeting increased physical activity. Thus, use of other platforms need to be tested for promoting physical activity, e.g., SMS or more recently developed approaches that can be delivered on a smartphone or tablet.\n\nUse of mHealth for Smoking Cessation\n\nTobacco use remains the most significant preventable risk factor for CVD. The AHA Task Force on Risk Reduction noted that approximately a third of CVD deaths are attributable to smoking and that a substantial and rapid decrease in risk results from smoking cessation.109 Although there are a number of effective pharmacologic and behavioral interventions for smoking cessation, the delivery of these interventions has been inconsistent. Practice guidelines for smoking cessation incorporate the five A’s: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange.110 Although most healthcare providers report asking about smoking and advising their patients to quit, they are much less likely to assess willingness to quit, assist with cessation, or arrange follow-up.111 Given the limitations of smoking cessation delivered by health professionals, technologies have been leveraged to facilitate the delivery of smoking cessation interventions. Early approaches utilized the internet to deliver these interventions112 and current and reputable internet interventions such as smokefree.gov are available.113 The advent of mobile technologies provides potential delivery advantages over internet interventions via desktop or laptop computers.\n\nSmoking urges occur frequently throughout the day in response to various triggers, and indoor smoking bans have moved smoking behavior outside, away from computers used at work and home. Mobile devices, therefore, are more likely to be available when smokers experience the urge to smoke and can deliver interventions at these times. These mobile devices also offer the promise of “Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions” (JITAI) that adapt interventions based on context and potentially preempt smoking behavior by anticipating when urges are likely to occur.114\n\nUnfortunately, current commercially available mobile apps for smoking cessation have generally failed to deliver empirically-supported interventions or to make optimal use of the capabilities of mobile phones. A series of studies by Abroms and colleagues115,116 have shown that most commercially available smoking cessation apps do not adhere to practice guidelines for smoking cessation. Some of these practice guidelines, developed for delivery by healthcare professionals, may not be appropriate criteria for mobile interventions. For instance, should a smoking cessation mobile app ask about smoking or is it reasonable to assume that if a user has downloaded a quit smoking app that he/she is a smoker? Additionally, some empirically-supported approaches that are amenable to a computerized intervention such as scheduled gradual reduction of smoking117 may not have been included in the practice guidelines due to the difficulty of delivery by healthcare professionals. Even with these caveats, commercially available mobile apps for smoking cessation are generally incomplete and lack empirical basis. Abroms and colleagues have documented that although some smoking cessation apps are downloaded more than a million times per month, smartphone apps adhere, on average, to only about a third of the practice guidelines for smoking cessation interventions.\n\nAlthough most commercially available smoking cessation apps are incomplete or lack empirical support, there has been considerable research on the efficacy of mobile interventions for smoking cessation that we review below. Unfortunately, until quite recently these empirically-tested interventions developed by smoking cessation researchers were not commercially available. Much of the initial research on SMS for smoking cessation occurred outside of the U.S. and the programs, if available, are available only in those countries. Additionally, researchers developing these mobile smoking cessation programs often did not partner with commercial entities capable of marketing the program once evaluated; however, there are recent examples of commercially available programs developed by researchers.118,119\n\nReview of evidence for efficacy of mobile technology-based interventions to promote smoking cessation.\n\nWe searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014, using the terms quit smoke; stop smoke; stopped smoke; ceased smoke; smoking cessation; cigarette smoke; smokeless tobacco; smoker; tobacco cessation; tobacco use; nicotine replacement; nicotine gum; nicotine lozenge; nicotine nasal; nicotine patch; nicotine inhalant. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 286 identified articles. Of these, most (211) were not relevant to mobile technologies for smoking cessation. These were predominately internet-based interventions or studies that used mobile technologies for recruitment or measurement purposes, but not for intervention. Of the remaining 85 publications, 14 were RCTs of mobile technologies for smoking cessation, and these trials are described in . The remaining reports of mobile technologies for smoking cessation included a range of studies including descriptions of design and development; reports of feasibility, acceptability, and usability data, uncontrolled trials; and various systematic reviews. For completeness, two Cochrane meta-analyses of this area120,121 are included in the table\n\nSMS for Smoking Cessation.\n\nMost of the research on mobile smoking cessation interventions has focused on text messaging as the delivery medium. Why SMS when there are so many other delivery mediums on today’s smartphone? First, many of the early studies using mobile phones for smoking cessation122,134 predate the advent of the smartphone; hence SMS was one of the few functions available on feature phones for the delivery of interventions. Second, SMS is a relatively inexpensive development environment that will run on any cell phone whereas a smartphone app needs to be developed for each operating system (e.g. Android, iOS) and updated with each operating system update. Third, although smartphone use is increasing dramatically and is now above 50 percent in the U.S.19, smartphone use was reported as lowest by adults in lower socioeconomic groups.135 Smoking rates are disproportionately higher in lower socioeconomic groups136 that remain predominately feature phone users. Recent PEW statistics, however, show that Hispanics and African Americans have higher rates of smartphone use than Whites, indicating the demographic shift in mobile phone use that could make smartphone apps a viable medium for cessation interventions targeting minorities.20\n\nCochrane Meta-analysis.\n\nControlled studies of mobile phone programs for smoking cessation have been summarized in a Cochrane meta-analysis 120 and updated. 121 The details of studies reviewed in these two meta-analyses are listed in . For both reviews, the primary outcome was smoking abstinence of six months or longer and included both sustained and point prevalence abstinence and both self-reported and biochemically validated smoking status. However, the number of studies reviewed was four and five, respectively, and there was considerable effect heterogeneity across studies.\n\nThe initial Cochrane review 120 identified nine articles relevant to smoking cessation via mobile phones in which the mobile intervention was a core component, not just an adjunct to an internet or in-person program. Of these, four were small, non-randomized feasibility trials, and two had insufficient follow-up for inclusion. Of the four studies included in the meta-analysis, two assessed the same text messaging program delivered in two different countries122,125 and the remaining two trials 123,124 evaluated a combined internet and mobile phone intervention. The four studies lacked long-term follow-up or biochemical validation in more than a small subsample of participants, but all four studies showed significantly greater abstinence at six months compared to controls (see for details),.\n\nIn the 2102 update of the Cochrane review, the two Norwegian studies were subsequently excluded due to the considerable non-mobile aspects of the intervention, but three trials published since the initial review were added: a video messaging mobile phone intervention 121; a web-based quit coach and text messaging intervention130 and a large scale evaluation of an SMS or text messaging intervention 126. Pooled across these five total studies, the RR was 1.71. Among the studies reviewed in the Cochrane update, the large and well-controlled United Kingdom study by Free and colleagues126 accounted for over half (50.45%) of subjects in the meta-analysis. In this single blind trial, 5800 smokers willing to quit were randomly assigned to either a mobile phone text program (txt2stop) that included behavior change support and motivational messages or to a control group that received SMSs unrelated to quitting smoking. Based on biochemically verified continuous abstinence at six months, quit rates were significantly greater in the txt2stop (10.7%) than the control group (4.9%), and the abstinence rates were similar when those lost to follow-up were treated as smokers. Since the Cochrane update in 2012, there have been a number of RCTs of smoking cessation programs delivered via mobile phone technologies, and these are listed in .\n\nSpecial Populations.\n\nThere are limited intervention options for pregnant smokers. In a preliminary trial comparing smoking cessation programs in pregnant smokers128, there were no significant differences in self-reported smoking abstinence between groups who received educational materials and tailored SMS. Further research is needed to identify minimal risk interventions that are effective for pregnant smokers.\n\nLikewise, low-education young adults are a particularly vulnerable population for smoking that warrant additional research on both prevention and cessation interventions. Two recent studies132, 133 compared the effectiveness of technology-based smoking cessation interventions to educational pamphlets in adolescent vocational students. Neither study reported significant differences in self-reported abstinence after intervention between groups receiving text-messaging interventions or paper-based educational materials, however the sample sizes in these two studies may have been inadequate to detect differences.\n\nRecent Studies in U.S.\n\nYbarra and colleagues first studied an SMS program delivered in Turkey 129 and more recently studied the effects of their SMS intervention in a study of young adult smokers in the U.S. 118 Although the intervention produced significantly higher abstinence rates at four weeks, these differences were not sustained at 3 months.\n\nAbroms and colleagues recently published a controlled trial of Text2Quit, an automated, tailored, and interactive text messaging program for smoking cessation.119 In contrast to many previous programs which primarily push out texts, the Text2Quit program is interactive and prompts users to track smoking and report cravings. Via keyword texts, users have the ability to reset quit dates, request help with a craving, get program and data summaries, and indicate if they have slipped and smoked. Mailed saliva cotinine verified point prevalence abstinence at 6 months, showed an 11% abstinence rate for intervention vs. 5% for controls. In contrast to the studies and programs in the earlier Cochrane reviews, this study was conducted in the U.S. and evaluated a program that is commercially available to smokers in the U.S.\n\nGaps and Recommendations for Future Research.\n\nThere is substantial evidence that mobile phone apps for smoking cessation, particularly SMS programs, are effective for smoking cessation. The effects found for mobile phone smoking cessation interventions are comparable to the effects found from other smoking cessation interventions, including nicotine replacement therapies.137 The considerable heterogeneity of this evidence, however, suggests that not all text messaging programs are created equal, and that there is considerable individual variability in response to these programs. Therefore, although these text messaging programs have sufficient empirical support to be recommended to patients interested in quitting smoking, the selection of text messaging intervention may matter. Unfortunately, many of these empirically-supported text messaging programs were developed and evaluated outside of the U.S. and are not available, commercially or otherwise, to U.S. smokers. This lack of U.S. access to proven text messaging programs is beginning to change. Abroms and colleagues recently published evidence for their Txt to Quit program which is commercially available.119\n\nAlthough there are hundreds of smartphone applications for smoking cessation commercially available, there is considerable evidence that these applications have a limited empirical basis115,116 and we could find no published study testing the efficacy of any of these commercially available smartphone apps. In the one study that compared smartphone apps to text messaging131, text messaging produced better quit rates. While it is clearly premature to recommend any smartphone application for smoking cessation at this time, smartphone applications hold potential future promise as smoking cessation interventions. Smartphones provide a range of potential features and functions not available via text messaging modalities that have not been adequately leveraged to date for smoking cessation. For example, movement and location sensors in smartphones could be used to learn the contexts in which users smoke and deliver interventions preemptively before the urge to smoke occurs114. Sensors connected to smartphones, such as carbon monoxide monitors 138, provide objective measures of smoking status. Another promising approach that builds on the use of smartphones is ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), an approach to the delivery of interventions to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world).139 This approach is gaining increasing attention as a potential approach across multiple behavioral domains and was tested in an earlier study for smoking cessation with significantly higher quit rates in the intervention group than the control group at 6 and 12 weeks but was not sustained at 26 weeks.122,139 Ongoing studies are testing this approach with the currently available smartphone technology.\n\nOne critical but inadequately researched area is how to engage smokers to initiate the use of these mobile phone SMS programs. The well-controlled, population-based, multi-arm trial of Borland and colleagues 130 had less than half of the intervention participants engage with the intervention on even a minimal basis. The follow-up study by Riley and colleagues in which participants were assisted with program initialization 140 was due to the findings of an earlier trial in which 37% of the participants who completed baseline measures but failed to initialize the SMS program on their own.134 Bock and colleagues conducted focus groups on preferences for a SMS-based smoking cessation program from potential users. Participants recommended including social networking components, greater control of program output via online profile, and more interactive text messaging features. In parallel with research on the efficacy of these mobile phone programs for those who engage with them, research on how to engage smokers and keep them engaged in these programs also needs to occur.\n\nSummary and recommendations.\n\nSmoking cessation via mobile phone intervention is a relatively young area of research with only 10 years of published literature. Within this short period, however, a number of large and well-controlled studies have shown that SMS programs produce approximately double the abstinence rates of minimal intervention control conditions. Despite this success, the failure rate from these programs is still unacceptably high (approximately 90% fail to quit at six months) and the heterogeneity of effect across studies suggests that certain varieties of SMS interventions may work better than others, and in certain populations differentially from others. Until more is known on optimal intervention components of SMS for smoking cessation, and on which smokers are more likely to benefit from these approaches, the current literature is only able to support that SMS interventions should be considered along with other efficacious smoking cessation interventions for smokers trying to quit.\n\nUse of mHealth for Self-Management of Diabetes\n\nDiabetes occurs in 9.3% of the US population (29.1 million persons). Of increasing concern is the number of US adults with undiagnosed diabetes (8.1 million) or pre-diabetes (86 million).141 CVD and stroke are serious complications of diabetes. The majority of US adults 18 years and older with diabetes have CVD risk factors, including high blood pressure (71%), high cholesterol (65%)141, and obesity (70%).142 Although death rates for heart attack and stroke have decreased, adults with diabetes are twice as likely to be hospitalized and die from these diseases as people who do not have diabetes. Because people with diabetes are living longer, the prevalence of obesity is not abating, and the rate of diagnosed new cases is increasing (7.8–12.0 per 1000 in 2012 depending on age), scientists expect that the number of people with diabetes and CVD to continue to rise. However, since the rates of survival after heart attack and stroke continue to improve, more persons with diabetes will continue to live into older age with comorbidities of CVD and diabetes. According to the joint statement of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), glycemic control in diabetes management for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is important in risk reduction for CVD events. A1c is the clinical measure of glycemic control and the self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is done by the consumer (patient). A general population target of A1C <7% is recommended for clinician consideration and health plan targets, but an individualized approach to glycemic control at the patient level is suggested. It is important to note that the consumer (patient) role in glycemic control requires problem-solving and daily decisionmaking about multiple behaviors (eating, activity, monitoring, and medication taking) and the healthcare provider role is collaborating with the patient to prescribe the appropriate diabetes medication(s) and monitoring the impact.143\n\nConsumer/patient perspective.\n\nThere are thousands of mobile applications for supporting diabetes self-management, primarily serving as tracking and reference apps. Few have been evaluated and even fewer have demonstrated outcomes.131 However, less than one percent of mobile applications have been evaluated through research. It can be hoped that increased federal and private foundation investments in mHealth, and behavioral, clinical, and health system interventions in combination with new regulatory requirements, will provide consumers and providers with evidence of effectiveness or what works.\n\nA number of pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions for diabetes management have been confirmed by multiple RCT’s, however only 48.7% of patients meet the A1c, blood pressure, and lipid goals for diabetes care and only 14.3% meet these 3 measures and also the goals for tobacco use.131 The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education/Support, jointly published by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) incorporate the AADE7 self-care behaviors (physical activity, healthy eating, taking medication, monitoring, self-management problem-solving, reducing risks, and healthy coping) as essential behaviors for improving diabetes self-management. 144–146\n\nMobile technologies for diabetes self-management can be categorized in the following way: SMS apps via mobile phone, diabetes medical devices (e.g., blood glucose meters, insulin pumps) with connectivity to smartphone apps, and bi-directional data sharing between patients and providers using smartphones. This classification did not exist when most of the reviewed articles were published. Interventions delivered via mobile technologies and directed at consumers may be supported by behavior change theories or principles, e.g., self-efficacy theory. However, most studies have limited theoretical foundations or lack an empirical basis. Moreover, health care providers lack knowledge about what apps are available or how to evaluate them and thus are hesitant to recommend them.13\n\nAlthough large, primary care, RCTs of mobile diabetes management are limited, smaller studies addressing feasibility, usability and acceptability have generally identified the following components as essential to successful diabetes management: personalized engagement, provision of actionable feedback for consumers, and connection with providers and/or health care systems. Additional contributors to usability include mobile technologies to support community health workers and peer supported self-care behaviors.147\n\nReview of evidence for efficacy of mobile technology-based interventions to promote self-management of diabetes.\n\nWe searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014, using the terms type 2 diabetes; NIDDM; maturity onset diabetes; adult onset diabetes; non-insulin dependent; noninsulin dependent; slow onset diabetes; stable diabetes; hyperinsulinemia; hyperinsulinism; insulin resistance; hyperglycemia; glucose intolerance; metabolic syndrome; metabolic X syndrome; dysmetabolic syndrome; metabolic cardiovascular syndrome. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 242 identified articles. Of these, 83 were not relevant to the use of mobile technology with diabetes, 159 were reviewed further. Of these 159 references were identified, 142 were excluded based on review of title, abstract, and full text. Similar to other sections of this review, mobile technologies may target multiple behaviors singly or in combination to improve numerous clinical and behavioral outcomes. Therefore, for this review we focused on studies with change in the clinical metric of HbA1c as the primary outcome, considered the gold standard in diabetes improvement. Seventeen articles were eligible for this review and ten of these were international studies.\n\nThe types of mobile technologies used for diabetes self-management research interventions include mobile platforms, with diabetes specific software apps or SMS. provides the detail of the RCTs using these mobile tools that we reviewed.\n\nWhen evaluating interventions, we considered a HbA1c reduction of at least 0.3% as a clinically meaningful treatment effect148 and 1% decrease in HbA1c as a clinically meaningful indicator of reduced risk of diabetes complications based on the DCCT and UKPDS clinical trials.149,150 One US study151 reported a significantly greater HbA1c decrease in the intervention group than in the control group. Quinn evaluated a mobile phone software application with a patient and provider web portal.151 The average HbA1c decline over the one-year intervention was 1.9% for the intervention group versus 0.7% for the control group, a difference of 1.2% (p<0.001). Among four studies152–155 using SMS alone and SMS with web-tracking, three studies reported significant change in HbA1c.153–155 Six studies used a mixture of technologies for the intervention, including mobile phones, Internet, web portals, SMS, and/or glucose meters that provided messaging156–160\n\nWe also include in a systematic review by Liang161 and a Cochrane Review.162 The systematic review included 22 trials. The meta-analysis of 1657 participants showed that mobile phone interventions for diabetes self-management reduced HbA1c values by a mean of 0.5% over a median of 6 months follow-up. A subgroup analysis of 11 studies of T2DM patients reported significantly greater reduction in HbA1c compared to studies of those with type 1 diabetes [0.8 (9 mmol/mol) vs. 0.3% (3 mmol/mol); P = 0.02]. The authors reported that the effect of the mobile phone intervention did not significantly differ by other participant characteristics or intervention strategies. The Cochrane Review reported on computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with T2DM in 4 studies. The interventions addressed in this review included those using computer-based software applications that were based on user input (touch screen or other clinic support), desktop computer-based and mobile phone-based interventions. The Cochrane review also included other outcomes besides HbA1c, e.g., health related quality of life, death from any cause, depression, adverse effects, and economic data.162 A review of eleven studies by Pal provided data for a meta-analysis from which the authors reported pooled results indicating a small, statistically significant difference in outcomes between the intervention and comparison groups, mean difference −0.21 (95% CI −0.4 to −0.1.162 However, for 8 of the reviewed studies, they reported a significant mean difference in the HbA1c change for mHealth interventions compared to control condition ranged from 0.01 to −0.8 (−1.45, 0.15).\n\nAn early review of evidence on barriers and drivers to the use of interactive consumer health information technology (IT) by the elderly, persons with chronic conditions or disabilities, and the underserved concluded that questions remain as to the 1) optimal frequency of use of systems by patients, providers and 2) whether the success of interventions depends on repeated modification of the patient’s treatment regimen or ongoing assistance with applying a static treatment plan.171 A recent review focused on the effect of mobile phone interventions for glucose control in diabetes.161 This meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1657 participants showed that mobile phone interventions significantly reduced HbA1c by a mean of 6mmol/mol or 0.5% over a median follow-up of six months. Among the studies that we reviewed ( ), duration of interventions in the studies varied from 3 to 18 months. However, it should be noted that most clinical trials we reviewed examined change in HbA1c during a three-month intervention and very little was reported about the engagement and persistence of use with the technology. Participants randomized to the intervention arms of the trials received enhanced clinical attention and may also have received diabetes management supplies. Therefore, it may be inaccurate to assume that an intervention group’s significant change in HbA1c at three months is attributable to technology versus other nonspecific benefits of participation, especially considering a report from a 2011 survey showed that 26% of downloaded health apps are used only once and 74% are abandoned by the 10th use.172\n\nThe use of heterogeneous interventions (mobile phones, SMS and/or internet based) makes it more difficult to determine the effect of any single technology component on HbA1c. As suggested in other reviews162,173 of studies with different technology-based approaches (e.g., automatic SMS messages versus personalized feedback) a single component of technology may impact different behaviors in ways not clearly distinguishable when intervention components are combined. Authors of two systematic reviews concluded that interventions were more likely to be successful if they selected and combined theory-based behavior change strategies162,174, including interactive components that involve tracking, personalized feedback and peer support.\n\nGaps and Recommendations for future directions.\n\nFew studies focus on high risk, underserved or minority populations. Most studies do not report on changes in anti-hyperglycemic medications during the intervention which may impact change in HbA1c. Without that information, it is difficult to determine if changes in lifestyle behavior or changes in medications contributed to the effectiveness of the mobile intervention It is possible that reports of the follow-up secondary analyses of such studies has not been published, or that our search missed them. The reviewed studies did not report intervention dose or receipt, i.e. number of SMS messages or push notifications sent and opened by participants. Only one study151 reported differences in HbA1c change as a function of different baseline A1c levels which may be important for understanding who will most benefit when targeting specific populations, including older adults. Similar to other sections in this paper, we recommend that future studies address the need to identify specific behaviors that may impact glucose management singly or in combination.\n\nWe recommend:\n\nthat technology development and/or intervention development be considered to meet the needs of specific population groups: a) older adults with age-related changes such as vision or touch, b) minorities needing culturally sensitive intervention content or materials and approaches-, and c) low-income adults who may have inconsistent access to mobile technologies and supplies to support diabetes management.\n\nthat studies evaluate technology-supported glucose management for periods longer than 3 months to determine sustainability of engagement and the long-term effects of mHealth interventions in maintaining behavior changes.\n\nThat studies include clinical, technical, and behavioral factors that may influence initial engagement and ongoing use of mHealth and its associated impact on outcomes.\n\nThat studies examine other outcomes related to improved diabetes management such as quality of life and acceptability of mHealth devices.\n\nFinally, we recommend that future studies examine the relationships among use of mHealth interventions, HbA1c change, and health care utilization and costs, including consumer and provider costs. As more public and private insurers reimburse for the cost of mHealth interventions, evaluation of claims data from these populations may add to our understanding of cost effectiveness.\n\nUsing mHealth to Improve Hypertension Care\n\nHypertension is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition that is a major risk factor in CVD. The risk for CVD events such as stroke or myocardial infarction doubles for every 20 mm Hg increase in systolic and 10 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure.175 Best practices for treatment of hypertension include a combination of pharmacotherapy with preventive lifestyle counseling for exercise, healthful eating and smoke-free living. 175 Despite widespread initiatives to treat hypertension and availability of antihypertensive medications, less than 50% of people in the US have controlled blood pressure.142 This is thought to be due largely to sub-optimal adherence to self-care.176\n\nStrategies to improve self-care and adherence have been explored. Face-to-face counseling has been shown to be associated with reductions of 3–8 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) among patients with hypertension.176 Team-based hypertension care, with partnership between a primary care physician and other professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers has been shown to increase the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure by 12%.177 Still, costs of such care models prevent dissemination and sustainability.\n\nThe rapid growth of the internet and mobile telecommunication offers unprecedented opportunity to improve patient access to and engagement with hypertension care.178,179 In general, they follow the premise that patients might spend only a few hours a year with a physician or nurse, but they spend 5000 waking hours each year engaged in choices that affect their health.180 These eHealth programs can be delivered by the Internet, email, SMS, or similar electronic means to engage patients in remote blood pressure, medication and behavior monitoring as well as provide patients relevant education, counseling and motivational support.\n\nOne example of an mHealth intervention that has become accepted as beneficial to the management of hypertension is self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommend SMBP monitoring as an adjunct method in the management of hypertension.175 The AHA recommends SMBP for evaluation of most patients with known or suspected hypertension to assess response to treatment and possibly improve adherence.181 Still, much remains unknown about what other mHealth interventions are effective in improving hypertension care.\n\nReview of evidence for efficacy of mobile technology-based interventions to promote blood pressure control.\n\nOur review focuses on mHealth intervention effects on SBP specifically given its association with cardiovascular outcomes. We searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014, using the following terms, hypertension; hypertensive; antihypertensive; anti-hypertensive; pre-hypertensive; high blood pressure; elevated blood pressure; increased blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 316 identified articles and 125 were reviewed further but were not relevant to mobile technologies. The studies we selected for a detailed review (see ) were published between 2008 and 2014 and permitted patients some form of electronic platform to assist with self-monitoring and/or support for hypertension. We focused on interventions that offered some additional feature beyond simply SMBP monitoring, and also included internet-based studies since an increasing number of people access the internet on mobile devices.16 We divided the review to describe individual studies organized by the primary form of mHealth used to deliver the intervention followed by existing systematic reviews. Here we provide details on the salient studies and what was learned from the review.\n\nSMS:\n\nThere were 3 RCTs that utilized text messaging as the primary intervention modality.184–186 The details of these studies are provided in . The three studies had methodological limitations including poor retention. Two of the studies185,186 reported significant differences in blood pressure reduction between the treatment conditions; however, all studies reported results using the completers’ analysis approach rather than ITT.\n\nThere were 3 RCTs that used email as the primary intervention modality.111,183,187 These studies ranged from 4 to 6 months and all had high retention. The frequency of the email contact was not specified in Nolan’s study and was frequent in the other studies. Madsen183 augmented the email information exchange with messages sent via a PDA. Ciccolini111 and Nolan187, using a completers’ analysis, reported a significant difference between groups in blood pressure changes while Madsen, using ITT analysis, did not find a difference in blood pressure between groups but observed that a significantly higher proportion of the intervention group achieved the target blood pressure.\n\nA single study was found that used IVR as the primary intervention modality and was conducted in Honduras and Mexico.188 Participants received weekly information on medication adherence and salt intake tailored to their BP through the IVR. There was only a trend for a significant difference in BP reduction from the control group, which may be due to only 67% completion of the IVR calls.\n\nThere were 2 RCTs that used a website as the primary intervention modality.189,193 Watson et al. enrolled 500 adults from primary care practice offices in central Pennsylvania. The web-based intervention provided feedback on reported blood pressure and advice; however, only 35% of intervention participants used the website at least once monthly.193 Watson et al. enrolled 404 adults with HBP from 6 worksites for a 6-month study that included a website that displayed SMBP readings, provided education and custom messages based on BP reports.189 Adherence to SMBP was low overall, with only 17% of intervention participants reporting SMBP in month 1 and 7% at month 6. Neither of these studies demonstrated significant reductions in BP and no differences between intervention and control conditions. It was not stated but it is possible that the adherence was so low because participants might not have had the capability to access the website via a mobile device.\n\nMixed use of mHealth strategies:\n\nThere were 3 RCTs that used a mixture of mHealth modalities to deliver the intervention. Green et al.182 used web-access, including secure email, medical record, health library and links to resources vs. web+ pharmacist or a control (usual care) condition. Only the web+ pharmacists group reduced SBP significantly better than the other conditions at 12 months. It also resulted in increases in secure messaging between patient and provider/pharmacist and more antihypertensive medication classes being added. McKinistry et al. compared 6 months of SMBP with access to a website with graphical displays of SMBP data, and optional automated SMS or emails with feedback on their blood pressure control to a control condition.191 Adherence to uploading BP data was high but the number of participants opting for SMS and/or emails was not reported. The mean reduction in SBP in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group. Also, there were more outpatient care visits and antihypertensive medications prescribed in the intervention group. Magid et al. recruited patients from primary care clinics and randomized them to a control condition or an intervention using the Heart360 web site to upload their SMBP, IVR reminders if patient did not enter blood pressure data, and phone calls and emails from a pharmacist recommending antihypertensive pharmacotherapy changes.190 While Magid used some components of mHealth in this intervention, it does not appear that the phone component was based on mobile devices. Adherence to uploading BP data was high and there were higher rates of emails and phone calls with pharmacists in the intervention group. Results revealed a significant mean reduction in SBP in the intervention group at the end of the 6-month study. All three of these studies provided some combination of patient educational resources, timely delivery of BP data to providers, and personalized messages to patients. The positive results of the three trials may suggest that a combination of such strategies or modes of intervention delivery may be needed to engage patients. Whether these multimodal technology-based approaches can provide the same or better results than team-based in-person care for a lower cost remains unclear; the data at this time suggest that further investigations are warranted. What is clear from this review of studies targeting improved BP control as well as in other sections that addressed interventions targeting behavior, is that mHealth or digital health has no defined taxonomy or classification of interventions delivered by the existing technology. Thus it is difficult to summarize the study outcomes by such a classification of interventions. The current state of science suggests they all have an important place in targeting improved CV health.\n\nIn summary, 8 of the 12 studies detailed in were conducted outside of the US and two of those were conducted in Canada so results may not be generalizable to all healthcare systems. Most, but not all of the studies, used self-monitoring of BP and used those data for reporting and receiving feedback. Eight of the studies reported a significant difference between the treatment conditions, but only three of the 12 studies used an ITT approach in analyzing the results. Instead, most studies reported results only in experimental subjects who were compliant with the mHealth technology used. This approach not only inflates the results and compromises randomization but also raises questions about the generalizability to a broad hypertensive population, particularly elderly or disabled patients, such as those with stroke, who may have difficulty using the technology.\n\nSystematic Reviews:\n\nWe identified two systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining studies testing mHealth interventions for BP control.195,196 Using the same quality assessment tool for systematic reviews and meta-analyses as in the AHA/ACC guideline, both systematic review studies were rated good quality (indicating a study with the least level of bias and results deemed valid). Both reviews focused on a slightly different topic, but shared common features. Uhlig et al.195 focused on SMBP monitoring with or without additional support and Liu focused on internet-based interventions for blood pressure control.196 Both reviews suffered from heterogeneity across studies in SMBP equipment used, intervention modality and components, participants, and blood pressure endpoints, precluding direct comparisons across studies. Neither of the systematic reviews exclusively included RCTs. Both reviews focused on intervention comparison with usual care or no intervention, whereas only Uhlig examined comparison with an active control (SMBP self-monitoring), and only Liu attempted to determine which of the intervention characteristics were associated with better outcomes.\n\nUhlig et al.195 reviewed 25 studies that compared SMBP plus support to usual care. Among the 5 quality A studies that compared SMBP + support to usual care, there was a net reduction in SBP of−2.1 to −8.3 mm Hg. The type of support offered varied greatly across studies, and included only one that used an mHealth support intervention.182 Uhlig et al. also examined 13 trials comparing SMBP versus SMBP plus support and found no evidence to support the benefit of SMBP + support on top of SMBP alone. Liu et al. examined 13 studies, which compared internet-based counseling interventions on blood pressure control in pre-hypertensive and hypertensive patients, 11 of which were RCTs. They found that e-counseling interventions significantly reduced daytime SBP by 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI −5.63 to −2.06). The authors found th"
