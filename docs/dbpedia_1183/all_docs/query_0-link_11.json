        "text": "Introduction\n\nThere is an urgent worldwide need to develop a safe and effective vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of COVID-19, is a novel coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and four months later was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Vaccine efforts began shortly after the first sequence of the virus was made available in January 2020 (Lurie et al., 2020). Presently, at least 30 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in clinical trials (https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker). Because of the urgency and time required to develop a vaccine, most COVID-19 vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on an early index strain of the virus. These vaccines focus on the viral spike protein with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies (Jackson et al., 2020; Mulligan et al., 2020).\n\nThe trimeric spike protein mediates virus attachment and entry into host cells (Yuan et al., 2020). Each monomer is comprised of an S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and an S2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion (Wrapp et al., 2020). The RBD is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, although the N-terminal domain and other regions of spike are also known to possess neutralization epitopes (Brouwer et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020).\n\nEarly in the pandemic, the virus acquired a D614G mutation in the spike protein that rapidly increased in frequency and is now the dominant form of the virus globally (Biswas and Majumder, 2020; Gong et al., 2020; Isabel et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020a; Koyama et al., 2020a; Koyama et al., 2020b; Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020). The pattern of spread, combined with increased infectivity in vitro, suggests the mutation gave the virus a fitness advantage for transmission (Korber et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020), despite the fact that this mutation is outside of the RBD in the S1 subunit of spike. The mutation is also associated with higher virus loads in respiratory secretions, but it does not appear to increase disease severity (Korber et al., 2020a). A critical question is whether this mutation also mediates neutralization escape that could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines in general and especially ones based on the D614 version of the spike immunogen.\n\nHere, we addressed this question by using sera from spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates (NHPs), and humans. Neutralization was measured in 293T/ACE2 cells by using lentivirus particles pseudotyped with full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike containing either D614 or G614. Because this was the only difference between the pseudoviruses, any change in phenotype can be directly attributed to D614G.\n\nResults\n\nMice, rhesus macaques, and humans were immunized with the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform (Alameh et al., 2020; Pardi et al., 2018a). Four different variants of the spike protein were used as mRNA-encoded immunogens (Table S1, related to ): (1) monomeric secreted RBD protein (Laczkó et al., 2020) in macaques; (2) trimeric RBD protein made by adding a T4 fibritin-derived “foldon” trimerization domain to increase immunogenicity (Güthe et al., 2004) in humans; (3) prefusion diProline stabilized, first developed with the MERS spike immunogen (Pallesen et al., 2017), full-length cell-associated spike protein (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Wrapp et al., 2020) in mice; and (4) Wuhan index strain (Lurie et al., 2020) with a mutated furin cleavage-site cell-associated trimeric spike (Laczkó et al., 2020) in macaques. The furin mutant potentially stabilizes the full-length spike and maintains the association of the S1 and S2 subunits (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). Pseudoviral neutralization titers were calculated as 50% and 80% inhibitory doses (ID50 and ID80, respectively). Assays were performed with nearly equivalent amounts of input virus doses for both forms of the virus, i.e., relative light units (RLU) in virus control wells were 501–840× background in all assays.\n\nA total of 40 mice were immunized twice at a four-week interval with nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the diProline stabilized cell surface D614 spike (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020) in four equal-sized groups, with varying dose and route of vaccine administration. This is the immunogen being employed in the Moderna vaccine in phase 3 clinical trials (mRNA-1273, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04470427\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04470427\"}}NCT04470427) (Jackson et al., 2020). Immunizations were performed by the intradermal (i.d.) and intramuscular (i.m.) routes with 10- and 30-μg doses. Preimmune and serum four weeks after the second immunization were analyzed for neutralization of pseudoviruses with the D614 and G614 sequences. Preimmune sera from all mice scored negative. At four weeks after the second immunization, a relative increase in neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer for G614 over D614 was observed for each animal ( and S1A related to ; Tables S2A and S2B, related to ); analyses were done both as a single group and separately by dose and route. Across all routes and doses (N = 40), the geometric mean for the G614:D614 ratio was 5.2-fold (95% confidence interval [CI) 4.5–6.0) for ID50 and 4.4 (95% CI 4.0–4.9) for ID80. Similar patterns were seen across the 10-μg and 30-μg doses and for both i.m. and i.d. routes. shows the geometric mean for the ratio of G614:D614 nAb titers across route and doses, which ranged from 3.9 to 6.6 ID50 and 4.3 to 4.6 ID80. We found no exception to the increased sensitivity of G614 spike to vaccine sera, even though the D614 form was used for immunization, with p < 0.001 for all comparisons. The maximum percent inhibition was 100% for all animals against both viral strains.\n\nEleven rhesus macaques were immunized with the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform using two different immunogens by the i.m. route (50 μg). The first encoded the Wuhan index strain sequence (Lurie et al., 2020) cell surface spike protein with a mutated furin cleavage site (furin mut). The second encoded the RBD domain as a secreted monomer. Sera obtained at baseline and four weeks after the second immunization were assessed for neutralization of the D614 and G614 variants ( S1B, and S1C, related to ; Table S2C, related to ). Baseline (preimmune) sera were all negative. nAb titers in all postimmunization sera were higher against the G614 variant virus than the D614 (Wuhan index strain) virus for both immunogens. For the furin mut spike immunogen (N = 5), the geometric mean for the G614:D614 ID50 nAb titer ratio was 5.4-fold (95% CI, 3.0–9.8) and for ID80 was 2.9-fold (95% CI 2.5–3.3) ( ). For the soluble RBD (N = 6), the G614:D614 ID50 nAb titer ratio had a geometric mean of 6.45-fold (p < 0.001) and for ID80 was 3.22-fold (p < 0.001) ( ). Similar to the data in immunized mice, all postimmune NHP sera neutralized both the D614 and G614 viruses to 100%. The observation that the G variant was more sensitive to antibodies induced by both a D614-containing cell surface spike trimer and an RBD-secreted monomer suggests that the G614 mutation increases RBD-mediated neutralization despite the fact that D614G lies in S1 outside the RBD.\n\nPreliminary results from a phase 1/2 clinical trial using the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform that delivered a secreted RBD trimer were recently published and demonstrated potent ELISA binding and neutralization in all subjects at all tested doses: 10, 30, and 50 μg (Mulligan et al., 2020). Virus neutralizing titers after the second immunization of 10 and 30 μg were 1.8-fold and 2.8-fold greater, respectively, than were convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (Mulligan et al., 2020), although the nAb titers in convalescent patients exhibited a wide range, and the patients were older than vaccinated subjects.\n\nSera obtained preimmunization and seven days after the second immunization with 50 μg (N = 3), 30 μg (N = 1), and 10 μg (N = 1) of human subjects from a phase 1 trial performed in Germany using the same vaccine were analyzed for neutralization of the D614 and G614 spike variant pseudoviruses. Similar to the data in murine and NHP immunizations ( , A, and S1A–S1C, related to and A; Tables S2A–S2C, related to and A), the G614 pseudovirus was more potently neutralized than the D614 pseudovirus by the same serum samples ( B and S1D related to B; Table S2D, related to B). The geometric mean of the G614:D614 ID50 nAb titer ratio was 4.22-fold (p = 0.014) and for ID80 was 3.1-fold (p = 0.017). No neutralizing activity was detected in the corresponding preimmune sera. As with the vaccinated mice and NHP, all human vaccine sera achieved complete neutralization of the virus (100% maximum percent inhibition [MPI]).\n\nWe also compared the neutralization susceptibility of D614 and G614 pseudoviruses by using convalescent serum samples from people known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 variant of the virus. As shown in A and Table S2E, related to A, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more sensitive to neutralization by sera from people infected with either variant; this difference was remarkably consistent across the 70 sera tested and was highly statistically significant for ID50, ID80, and MPI. Additional clinical data were available for these sera, enabling us to explore the possibility that the infecting strain (D614 verses G614), viral load, or declining antibody levels over time in convalescent sera (Ibarrondo et al., 2020) might impact the level of the antibody responses. We used a mixed-effect model to predict log ID50. We modeled the different levels of responses in sera from different individuals (N = 70) as a random effect and used fixed effects to model the contribution the number of days between diagnosis and sera sampling, the real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, the pseudovirus tested, and the D- and G-infecting strain. Although the relationship between the pseudovirus tested and the ID50 was highly significant (Figure S2, related to A), consistent with the paired statistic in A, we found that none of the other factors, including interactions between the D- or G-infecting virus and pseudovirus assayed, were statistically significant predictors.\n\nAdditional comparisons of the neutralization susceptibility of D614 and G614 pseudoviruses were made with RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from SARS-CoV-1- and SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Antibody CR3022, a weak RBD binder that is reported to be non-neutralizing (ter Meulen et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2020), was negative against both pseudoviruses ( B). Antibody B38 was weakly neutralizing against both viruses but 2-fold more potent against G614. Antibodies H4, P2B-2F6, and S309 were 3–142 times more potent against G614. These results are further evidence that G614 is more sensitive to neutralization by RBD-directed antibodies.\n\nSera from macaques and humans immunized with RBD-only immunogens more potently neutralized G614 pseudovirus even though the D614G mutation was not in the RBD, and this observation suggested that the mutation induced a structural change in the expressed spike that increased the exposure of neutralizing epitopes on the RBD. To evaluate this possibility, we used negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) and single-particle reconstruction coupled with 3D classification to determine the structure and variability of the two variants in furin-deficient spike ectodomain constructs. The D614 variant showed two classes of structures called “3-down” or “1-up” in reference to their RBD positions ( A). The D614 variant demonstrated a roughly equal proportion of the 3-down to 1-up states (54% versus 46%), consistent with cryo-EM data reported by others (Walls et al., 2020). The G614 variant also demonstrated 3-down and 1-up structures ( B); however, the 1-up state was more heavily populated, 82%. Similar shifts in spike population, with the G614 variant showing a higher propensity for “up” RBD states, have also been reported in other studies in different spike constructs ((Gobeil et al., 2020); Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). This shift toward the 1-up state demonstrates an allosteric effect of the D614G mutation on RBD dynamics and suggests a mechanism for the enhanced neutralization susceptibility of the G614 variant.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSoon after the G614 mutation in spike appeared early in the pandemic, it rapidly replaced the D614 variant in many countries (Korber et al., 2020a). This mutation is associated with increased infectivity (Korber et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020) when tested in in vitro model systems. Over 100 vaccines using various platforms and immunogens are being developed to combat COVID-19 and end the devastating financial, societal, and health burdens. Currently, over 30 vaccines are in clinical testing, some of which have entered phase 3 trials. Most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were originally designed by using the D614 variant of the spike protein, which was present in the first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan (Lurie et al., 2020). The most critical finding that will ease the concern for most current vaccines in clinical trials is our data showing that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the G614 mutation does not escape neutralization but rather is neutralized at a higher level by serum from vaccinated mice, NHPs, and humans that used immunogens derived from the D614 variant of the virus. Consistent with this finding, our data also show that the G614 variant of the virus was more sensitive to neutralization by RBD-specific mAbs and serum samples from people known to be infected with either variant.\n\nD614 is on the surface of the spike protomer and has the potential to influence the conformation and flexibility of the spike protein. The recently published cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrates that the D614 sidechain can form a hydrogen bond with the neighboring protomer T859 amino acid (Wrapp et al., 2020). This interaction could be critical, because it could bridge residues from the S1 region of one protomer to the S2 region of an adjacent protomer. This interaction would bracket the furin and S2 cleavage sites (Gobeil et al., 2020). Potentially, it could reduce shedding of S1 from viral-membrane-bound S2, and the introduction of G614 could increase S1 release. Our structural data demonstrate that, although the D614G mutation is located in the SD2 subdomain and distal from the RBD region, in the context of a soluble ectodomain construct, this mutation leads to an increased proportion of the 1-RBD-up conformation ( ). A recent publication demonstrated a similar effect of the G614 mutation to increase the number of RBDs in the up position (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). By using an alternative structural analysis method, extensive microsecond timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that in the G form the interprotomer interactions in the spike trimer become more symmetric than do the D form. This equalization of interprotomer energetics results in a higher population of 1-up spike conformations, leading to increased encounter between RBD and ACE2 receptor and greater exposure of RBD domain for neutralization (Mansbach et al., 2020).\n\nOur results in immunized mice, NHPs, and human subjects immunized with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines with various spike immunogens; humans known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 variant of the virus; and with RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies conclusively demonstrate a modest but highly consistent increase in neutralization-susceptibility of the G614 variant. A clinical trial (Sahin et al., 2020) and a preclinical analysis (Corbett et al., 2020) also using nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines have been published after submission of this manuscript. They both analyzed neutralization of D614 and G614 viruses with assays that utilized pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus. Both observed no statistical reduction in neutralization of the G614 variant in comparison with D614 but did not directly compare neutralization of each virus by serum from individual subjects or animals. Therefore, we reanalyzed the published data from sera from the 24 mice vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation (Corbett et al., 2020) with a paired t test statistic; the greater sensitivity of the G614 form to sera from the vaccinated mice was supported by this test (p = 0.025). Assays performed in Erica Ollmann-Saphire’s laboratory demonstrate equivalent or better neutralization of G614-bearing pseudovirus in comparison with D614-bearing pseudovirus using convalescent sera from six COVID-19 subjects, but it was not known whether the individuals were infected with the D614 or G614 variant (Korber et al., 2020b). More recently, the D614G mutation was shown to render live SARS-CoV-2 virus more susceptible to neutralization by sera from D614 spike-immunized mice (Hou et al., 2020).\n\nA conclusion from our data is that the virus became modestly more susceptible to neutralization by host antibody responses as a consequence of acquiring a mutation that provides a fitness advantage for transmission. Previous work has shown that the G614 virus variant is more infectious in vitro (Korber et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020), and recent evidence from studies in animal models supports a transmission fitness advantage (Hou et al., 2020). The fact that the mutation is outside of the RBD and fusion machinery and affects both infectivity and neutralization is common for viral fusion proteins. Thus, coronavirus spike proteins are prefusion stabilized by similar types of mutations (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). Also, a variety of mutations distinct from neutralization epitopes in HIV envelope is known to alter antigenicity (Medina-Ramírez et al., 2017).\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate here that vaccinated mice, NHPs, and humans using the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform encoding four different SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogens generate antibody responses that not only recognize the G614 mutation that has taken over the pandemic (Korber et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020) but also have stronger titers of neutralization to this virus variant. The mechanism appears to be that the mutation increases the up formation of the RBD in the spike trimer, increasing the exposure of neutralization epitopes. Over 30 vaccines are currently in clinical trial testing. Most of the immunogens in these trials were either derived from the initial D614 virus or contain D614G in the spike. Although the G614 variant has replaced the original D614 sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 spike throughout much of the world, our finding that this is not an escape mutation and, in fact, is better neutralized by sera from mice, NHPs, and humans immunized with vaccines derived from the D614 viral spike alleviates a major concern regarding the current efforts to develop an effective SARS CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nLimitations of Study\n\nPotential drawbacks to our studies include the following: (1) although we studied four different variations of the spike immunogen, we only used a single type of vaccine platform, nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP platform (reviewed in Alameh et al., [2020] and Pardi et al. [2018b]). This platform is recognized as an outstanding new approach that has entered phase 3 clinical trials by two separate pharmaceutical/biotech companies, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. The results of phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated that all immunized subjects safely developed neutralizing responses (Jackson et al., 2020; Mulligan et al., 2020). (2) We performed pseudovirus neutralization assays. Although these assays are considered excellent methods to measure neutralization and are used for the development of many viral vaccines, live virus neutralization or animal challenges would offer additional methods to measure effective vaccine response to the G614 variant. A new study directly compared two different pseudovirus neutralization assays, including lentiviral used in this study, with live virus neutralization (Schmidt et al., 2020). Highly significant correlations were observed between the assays demonstrating no significant differences in the use of live virus versus pseudovirus neutralization assays for both convalescent plasma and human mAbs, which is perhaps not surprising given that neutralization in both assays is based on entry inhibition. As with the pseudovirus assay, assays with live SARS-CoV-2 are typically performed with viruses that are produced and assayed in cell lines; neutralization assays that use natural target cells of the respiratory system are technically challenging, low throughput, and difficult to standardize. (3) Our structural studies were performed in the context of a furin cleavage-deficient spike ectodomain. Although this soluble ectodomain has been shown to be a good mimic of the native spike, and the shift in the proportion of RBD “up” conformation between the D614 and G614 variants suggest an allosteric effect of the D614G mutation on the RBD conformations, the structures of the native spike could have some differences from what we observe in the context of the ectodomain. (4) Our experiments do not rule out possible differences in spike incorporation as another mechanism for the increased neutralization-susceptibility of the D614G spike pseudovirus."
