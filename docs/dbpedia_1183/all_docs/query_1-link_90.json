        "text": "On Thursday, May 23rd, KFAI will have it’s 6th Annual Tribute to Earl Root with the 24 Hours of the Metal Meltdown, featuring special programming from your favorite KFAI Metal hosts, including live music performances from Domidium at 6pm, and Worn Mantle at 9pm.\n\nMore details to come soon. Your regular, and favorite Thursday programming will return on May 30th.\n\nGeneral Board meetings\n\nThe KFAI Board of Directors typically meets on the fourth Monday of each month. For safety, meetings are held online via Zoom at 7:00 p.m. unless otherwise announced. Members of the public are encouraged to attend. Standard across all KFAI virtual meetings, a registered Zoom account, and advanced registration are required. Here is a helpful resource regarding Zoom account registration and other excellent guidance to assist in troubleshooting challenges.\n\nMeeting minutes and other public resources are always available at https://kfai.org/board.\n\nFY24 Board of Directors Modified & Updated Meeting Dates + Links\n\nDue to the holiday long weekend on Monday, May 27, and to accommodate the CPA presentation of the FY23 audit and a presentation from our new accounting firm, we adjusted the meeting schedule. Unfortunately, there was no more elegant way to do this, so May, June, and July each have their unique meeting link, and August-December has one link because it returns to recurring.\n\nMay Board Meeting: Monday, June 3, starting at 7pm\n\n1. https://us02web.zoom.us/ meeting/register/tZAvc- 2gqT4uE9XiJSBmZRX1-XFwR0C8uJwa\n\nJune Board Meeting: Monday, July 1, starting at 7pm\n\nJune 3, 2024 (May Board Meeting)\n\nJuly 1, 2024 (June Board Meeting)\n\nJuly 29, 2024 (July Board Meeting)\n\nAugust 26, 2024\n\nSeptember 23, 2024\n\nOctober 28, 2024\n\nNovember 25, 2024\n\nDecember 23, 2024\n\nThank you for your patience and flexibility. Please email [email protected] for questions and assistance.\n\nIn a world of fast fashion and same-day delivery, it is often cheaper to buy a new coat than to fix a zipper. Or easier to toss out an old blender rather than swap out a blown fuse. But for those who would like to give their items some more life – either for environmental or sentimental reasons –there’s the Fix-It Clinic.\n\nThe Hennepin County Fix-It Clinic is a monthly gathering where volunteer ‘fixers’ work hand-in-hand with people to revive their broken items. Reporter Matthew Schneeman attended one of Hennepin County’s clinics for KFAI to see how they work.\n\nAnyone who has fallen off the conveyer belt of mainstream health care and into the shadowy corners of illness knows what a dark place it is to land. Where is the infrastructure, the information, the guidance? What should you do next? In Rebel Health, Susannah Fox draws on twenty years of tracking the expert networks of patients, survivors, and caregivers who have come of age between the cracks of the health care system to offer a way forward. Covering everything from diabetes to ALS to Moebius Syndrome to chronic disease management, Fox taps into the wisdom of these individuals, learns their ways, and fuels the rebel alliance that is building up our collective capacity for better health.\n\nRebel Health shows how the next wave of health innovation will come from the front lines of this patient-led revolution. Fox identifies and describes four archetypes of this revolution: seekers, networkers, solvers, and champions. This important conversation includes tips, such as picking a proxy to help you navigate the relevant online communities, or learning how to pitch new ideas to investors and partners or new treatments to the FDA. On a personal level, anyone who wants to navigate the health care maze faster will want to become a health rebel or recruit some to their team. On a systemic level, it is a competitive advantage for businesses, governments, and organizations to understand and leverage the power of connection among patients, survivors, and caregivers.\n\nProactive, optimistic, and innovative, Rebel Health is a guiding light for anyone who wishes to join the health rebel alliance and become the hero of their own story."
