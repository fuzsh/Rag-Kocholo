        "text": "- GAAP LOSS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $(0.21) -\n\n- DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $0.07 -\n\n- DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BEFORE REALIZED LOSSES OF $0.19 -\n\n- DISTRIBUTABLE RETURN ON AVERAGE STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY OF 2.6% -\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ready Capital Corporation (“Ready Capital” or the “Company”) (NYSE: RC), a multi-strategy real estate finance company that originates, acquires, finances, and services lower-to-middle-market (“LMM”) investor and owner occupied commercial real estate loans, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“The second quarter results are reflective of our cumulative efforts to cycle out of underperforming assets and into market yielding investments,” said Thomas Capasse, Ready Capital’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “These efforts, along with improving credit metrics across the loan portfolio and record growth in our Small Business Lending business, position the Company to improve earnings moving into year end.”\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nTotal investments of $474 million, including $257 million of LMM originations and a record $217 million of U.S. Small Business Administration 7(a) loans\n\nDeclared and paid dividend of $0.30 per share in cash\n\nNet book value of $12.97 per share of common stock as of June 30, 2024\n\nAcquired approximately 2.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an average price of $8.61 per share as part of stock repurchase program\n\nSold $4.7 billion of residential mortgage servicing rights for net proceeds of $61.8 million as part of the Company’s disposition of its residential mortgage banking segment\n\nCompleted sale process of $462 million of under-performing loans with expected settlement in the third quarter\n\nCompleted the acquisition of Madison One, a leading originator and servicer of USDA and SBA guaranteed loan products\n\nSubsequent Events\n\nThe Company acquired Funding Circle USA, Inc., an online lending platform that originates and services small business loans\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release includes distributable earnings, formerly referred to as core earnings, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company defines distributable earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized gains and losses related to certain mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) not retained by us as part of our loan origination business, realized gains and losses on sales of certain MBS, unrealized gains and losses related to residential mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) from discontinued operations, unrealized changes in our current expected credit loss reserve, unrealized gains or losses on de-designated cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange hedges, unrealized gains or losses on certain unconsolidated joint ventures, non-cash compensation expense related to our stock-based incentive plan, and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, or merger related expenses.\n\nThe Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because distributable earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of distributable earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\n\nIn calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size.\n\nIn addition, in calculating distributable earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains or losses on residential MSRs, held at fair value from discontinued operations. Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860, Transfer and Servicing. In calculating distributable earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on commercial MSRs, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years.\n\nThe table below reconciles Net Income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Distributable Earnings.\n\n(in thousands)Three Months Ended\n\nJune 30, 2024Net Loss$(34,201)Reconciling items:Unrealized loss on MSR - discontinued operations7,219Unrealized gain on joint ventures(626)Decrease in CECL reserve(24,574)Increase in valuation allowance80,987Non-recurring REO impairment8,474Non-cash compensation1,891Merger transaction costs and other non-recurring expenses4,852Loss on bargain purchase18,306Realized losses on sale of investments22,355Total reconciling items$118,884Income tax adjustments(47,799)Distributable earnings before realized losses$36,884Realized losses on sale of investments, net of tax(20,253)Distributable earnings16,631Less: Distributable earnings attributable to non-controlling interests2,206Less: Income attributable to participating shares2,301Distributable earnings attributable to common stockholders$12,124Distributable earnings before realized losses on investments, net of tax per common share - basic and diluted$0.19Distributable earnings per common share – basic and diluted$0.07\n\nU.S. GAAP return on equity is based on U.S. GAAP net income, while distributable return on equity is based on distributable earnings, which adjusts U.S. GAAP net income for the items in the distributable earnings reconciliation above.\n\nWebcast and Earnings Conference Call\n\nManagement will host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 8:30am ET to provide a general business update and discuss the financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company encourages use of the webcast due to potential extended wait times to access the conference call via dial-in.
