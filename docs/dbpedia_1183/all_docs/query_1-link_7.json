        "text": "Long before \"I've never been to Me\" became a hit, I heard this song from that same album on the radio a few times. It is a tribute to the then-recently departed Freddie Prinze. At the time I had no idea who sang it and I didn't hear it for almost 30 years until Chris C found the song on YouTube and pointed it out to me. For which I'm grateful because it drove me nuts trying to track it down.\n\nI found the album last year in a local store. It's not too good but I'm glad to have the song, a hazy childhood memory (I was 8 when it came out)\n\nWOW, Mike ..., Glad that I could bring back a childhood memory for you!\n\nWhile I'm at it (depending on your age), you might remember the following music from your childhood, as the theme of the old local TV show \"Barnaby\" ...\n\nA La Claire Fontaine, arr. and conducted by Robert Farnon\n\nAre you kidding? I'd rather listen to MMMBop on a one hour loop than listen to this song even once all the way through. I only managed a few seconds of this song via one of the posted youtube clips before needing to shut it off. I didnt actually want to listen but its like driving past a really bad traffic accident - you don't really want to look but you just can't stop yourself. This song is just as vomitous to me as it was when I was a little kid when it was originally a hit in what - 1981-82? I always tried to avoid it whenever I could back then - always switching the radio station when it was played semi-constantly as a current hit back in the day. Unfortunately it was still forced on me when I got an otherwise quite good (as far as the song selection was concerned) K-Tel comp with the song on it. However at least they had the good sense to make it the very last song on the record so it could be more easily skipped/ignored.\n\nThen you were mercifully saved the misery of her 1982 single \"Used To Be\" - a duet with Stevie Wonder.\n\nHere are the first three lines:\n\n\"Superman was killed in Dallas\n\nThere's no love left in the palace\n\nSomeone took The Beatles lead guitar\"\n\nI was going to ask if there is a version that deletes the spoken word, the rest of the lyrics plus the music. You are being too kind. What an absolutely dreadful song! Apologies to the op...plenty of dreck that I like that some would probably think is worse, but I just couldn't resist!"
