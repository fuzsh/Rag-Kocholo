Who’d have thunk that this New York born, Motown-loving, transplanted Californian would be moved by the rockabilly twang, the slow easy ballads, the humor, the honesty that is now the country music phenomenon.\n\nThe truth is my venture into writing began about the same time I found country music on the radio. Tired of the oldies, unable to relate to the new hip-hop sounds blasting the stations nationwide and feeling a little lost — musically and professionally, I knew I needed more of something in my life. I recall hearing Faith Hill on a pop music station . But it wasn’t just Faith who intrigued me, but the man singing the duet with her, her new husband, Tim McGraw. I knew little of both of them, but thought to investigate this “country music” thing.\n\nI bought a Tim McGraw CD, watched him perform on Jay Leno one night, and as they say, I was a goner. Being a western romance writer, I fell in love with country music from that day on. Tim’s tight jeans, black hat and amazing smile, helped just a little. 🙂 (Met him once and never miss his concerts)\n\nSeriously, the music called to me, beckoning with tunes of lost loves, of heroes found, of sweet smiles and first crushes. The songs tell a complete story in three minutes, painting vivid pictures with impressions that stick in your head, long after the tunes are gone.\n\nI found the music inspiring, the lyrics fresh and honest, the images real. Sometimes humorous and fun, sometimes heart-breakingly sad, sometimes soulful and deep. Those heart-tugging emotions evoked a longing for something else in my life. They inspired me. They moved me. They made me feel.\n\nI can’t say that music solely played a role to help me find my lifelong passion of writing, but those short musical bursts of true life told beautifuly through rhythm and lyrics, with fiddles and drums and guitars and keyboards surely inspired me at a time when I truly needed inspiration.\n\nThe same holds true today. Often I’m asked the timeless question writers are asked- where do I get my ideas? My silent answer : From Tim and Faith and Toby and Kenny. From Martina and Brad and Shania. From Rascal Flatts and Brooks and Dunn, to name a few of my favorites.\n\nLYRICS THAT PAINT IMAGES:\n\nShould Have Been A Cowboy…Toby Keith\n\nI bet you’ve never heard ol’ Marshall Dillion say, Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away\n\nSettling down would you marry me?\n\nIf I asked you twice and begged you pretty please. She’d have said yes in a New York minute\n\nThey never tied the knot\n\nHis heart wasn’t in it\n\nHe just stole a kiss as he rode away\n\nHe never hung his hat up at Kitty’s place\n\nI should’ve been a cowboy\n\nI should’ve learned to rope and ride\n\nWearing my six-shooter riding my pony on a cattle drive\n\nStealing the young girl’s hearts\n\nJust like Gene and Roy\n\nSinging those campfire songs\n\nOh I should’ve been a cowboy\n\nI might of had a sidekick with a funny name\n\nRunning wild through the hills chasing Jesse James\n\nEnding up on the brink of danger\n\nRiding shotgun for the Texas Rangers\n\nGo west young man, haven’t you been told\n\nCalifornia’s full of whiskey, women and gold\n\nSleeping out all night beneath the desert stars\n\nWith a dream in my eye and a prayer…\n\nIn my heart\n\nLYRICS THAT INSPIRE\n\nAnyway … Martina McBride\n\nYou can spend your whole life buildin’\n\nSomethin’ from nothin’\n\nOne storm can come and blow it all away\n\nBuild it anyway\n\nYou can chase a dream\n\nThat seems so out of reach\n\nAnd you know it might not ever come your way\n\nDream it anyway\n\nGod is great, but sometimes life ain’t good\n\nWhen I pray it doesn’t always turn out like I think it should\n\nBut I do it anyway\n\nI do it anyway\n\nThis world’s gone crazy and it’s hard to believe\n\nThat tomorrow will be better than today\n\nBelieve it anyway\n\nYou can love someone with all your heart\n\nFor all the right reasons\n\nAnd in a moment they can choose to walk away\n\nLove ’em anyway\n\nLYRICS THAT REACH INTO YOUR SOUL:\n\nLive Like You Were Dying …Tim McGraw (10 weeks at #1)\n\nHe said I was in my early forties, with a lot of life before me\n\nAnd one moment came that stopped me on a dime\n\nI spent most of the next days, looking at the x-rays\n\nTalking bout’ the options and talking bout’ sweet times.\n\nI asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real end\n\nHow’s it hit ‘cha when you get that kind of news?\n\nMan what did ya do?\n\nHe said\n\nI went skydiving\n\nI went rocky mountain climbing\n\nI went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu\n\nAnd I loved deeper\n\nAnd I spoke sweeter\n\nAnd I gave forgiveness I’d been denyin’\n\nAnd he said some day I hope you get the chance\n\nTo live like you were dyin’\n\nHe said I was finally the husband, that most the time I wasn’t\n\nAnd I became a friend, a friend would like to have\n\nAnd all of a sudden goin’ fishin, wasn’t such an imposition\n\nAnd I went three times that year I lost my dad\n\nWell I finally read the good book, and I took a good long hard look\n\nAt what I’d do if I could do it all again\n\nAnd then\n\nI went skydiving\n\nI went rocky mountain climbing\n\nI went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Shu\n\nAnd I loved deeper\n\nAnd I spoke sweeter\n\nAnd I gave forgiveness I’d been denyin’\n\nAnd he said some day I hope you get the chance\n\nTo live like you were dyin’\n\nMy Top 10 Favorite Country Artists\n\nTim McGraw\n\nFaith Hill\n\nMartina McBride\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nReba\n\nBrooks and Dunn\n\nJosh Turner\n\nToby Keith\n\nGeorge Strait\n\nSo Much More\n\nI could go on and on about country songs that inspire me. The ones that make me laugh out loud. (Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off) The ones that are almost too heartbreaking to listen to (Concrete Angel). The ones that pull at your parental heartstrings(There Goes My Life) and the ones that speak about love and romance. (I Need You)\n\nThe stories they tell and rich emotions they evoke all help me develop my characters, create my plots and put those words on the page.\n\nThere are too many songs to name and too many artists I enjoy to post here. But I’d love to know if you’re a fan of country music? Are there songs that help inspire you whatever your profession? Who are your favorites?\n\nPost a comment and be entered into a drawing for Harlequin Coupons and a book from my backlist of available titles!\n\nHappy Trails !\n\nUP TOMORROW – GUEST BLOGGER KIM LOUISE !"
