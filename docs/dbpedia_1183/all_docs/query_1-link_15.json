        "text": "2001 single by the Calling\n\n\"Wherever You Will Go\" is the debut single of American band the Calling. The song was released on May 22, 2001, as the first single from their debut studio album, Camino Palmero (2001). It remains their most successful hit, peaking at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Adult Top 40 for 23 weeks, the second-longest-running number one in the chart's history. Outside the United States, the song topped the music charts of Italy, New Zealand, and Poland, reached number three in the United Kingdom, peaked at number five in Australia, and became a top-10 hit in several European countries.\n\nBackground and writing\n\n[edit]\n\nSongwriter Aaron Kamin talked about the song in a radio interview. He said: \"At the time my grandmother's best friend had passed away and she left behind a husband of 50 or more years and I was at the funeral and afterwards I just started thinking of what it would be like to be him and have your whole life change so dramatically and not for the best in a matter of moments. Somebody that you live and grow with and are one with, just to be gone, is crazy and I figured all he ever thinks about probably is finding a way to get back to her or be with her or make sure she's alright or something like that. That was the sentiment behind that.\"[2]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo videos were shot for this song. The first was set in Mexico. The other version, which is more popular, was directed by Gregory Dark, and has the band performing in the concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, while a teenage soap opera plays in the foreground. A teenage girl gets her boyfriend's name tattooed on her shoulder, but when she finds him cheating with another girl, she flies into a rage, destroying most of his belongings. At the end of the video, she is seen with a new boyfriend (male model and then-fledgling actor Drew Fuller) with a flower tattoo covering the name, as her jealous ex watches her from his car. The group's lead singer, Alex Band, can also be seen in some scenes singing in the foreground of some of the storyline, such as when the girl is seen destroying the belongings.\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits and personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits are adapted from the UK CD single liner notes.[4]\n\nStudios\n\nRecorded at Cherokee Studios (Hollywood, California)\n\nMixed at Image Recording (Hollywood, California)\n\nPersonnel\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales for \"Wherever You Will Go\"\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease dates and formats for \"Wherever You Will Go\" Region Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
