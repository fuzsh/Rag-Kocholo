        "text": "Goal\n\nCreate a clock that uses the signal that triggers a tick of the second hand to trigger a musical note, resulting in the playback of a song one second at time.\n\nHow It Works\n\nWires connected to the quartz clock movement are connected to an Arduino Leonardo board. The 1hz AC signal from the integrated circuit in the quartz clock movement is used as input into the Arduino board. The Arduino board is running a program that plays a note from an array of notes each clock tick. The sound is played through a piezo speaker connected to the Arduino board.\n\nBackground\n\nAs a life-long musician starting to get involved in the maker movement, I was excited when the theme “music” was revealed for my monthly maker meetup. I had actually already planned to make a normal “music” clock by decoupaging music notes onto a clock face and installing a quartz clock movement and clock hands. Why not finally do the clock but with some tech added to make it truly a musical clock?\n\nProcess\n\nResearch and Planning\n\nI searched online for Arduino projects involving clocks, and they were all about using the Arduino to drive the clock. For example, this video by Robert Massaioli explains how to make a clock run faster than normal. I wanted the clock to still be a clock, but use the pulse as an input to something else. I did finally find a couple posts about taking out the board from inside a quartz movement and coupling it with some other components to be able to use that as a module for other projects. But I didn’t want to take the clock apart and use it for parts, I wanted it to stay a clock!\n\nI learned a lot about quartz clock movements through watching videos online. By watching another video by Robert Massaioli I learned that the clock movement is basically a lavet-type stepping motor that works by running current through a solenoid in one direction and then the opposite direction. The current comes from an integrated circuit board inside that works in conjunction with a quartz crystal to send the current each second. Through this system a magnetic pulse is created every second. That pulse is directed at a small gear with a magnet, which causes the gear to turn 180 degrees. This turn then triggers a series of other gears to turn to rotate the second, minute and hour hands. Super cool!\n\nOnce I understood how the movement worked I was confident I could “sniff” the pulse signal as output and use it as an input to an Arduino.\n\nOpening Up and Disassembling the Quartz Clock Movement\n\nI had watched a bunch of videos, but now it was time to open up the movement and do some hands-on learning. I used a Flathead screwdriver to pry it open and take a look at how it worked.\n\nIn order to solder on the wires to the board inside, I had to disassemble the movement to remove the board and the attached coil."
