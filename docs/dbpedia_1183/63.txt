Seemes like forever `till this day. Wheew! A long and heavy burden finally fell and the spiritual sessions may start. It was worth the wait, and our Charlene girl put it in work strong. The first ear touch on this and like she never skipped a day in music... It`s so easy on the ears, yet so passionate, so Tweet, a one thousand roses fallin` out of the sky picture feel. Or butterflies... :)

Soulbird singer gave us fifthteen tracks on this album and most of the mood is typical signature of dear Charlene, a classic, acoustically-like jams, smooth shakers and country-like guitars over the sweet vocal melody the songstress beautifully arranged. Slide guitars dancing alongside her unique singing riffs, old school drums calling for that maturity and wide range of experience, extracting the real taste of original R`n`B/Neo Soul fruits from this well suited artista.

Even though it is a slow tempo, the energy will attract you and suck you in so quickly, you won`t even notice when your tracklist made a second turn around in a preview window... The songs that got my most attention besides the known ones "Won`t Hurt Me" and "Somebody Else Will" ft. her fellow girl Missy Elliott, are "Got Whatcha Want", "Magic" and "I Was Created For This"...
