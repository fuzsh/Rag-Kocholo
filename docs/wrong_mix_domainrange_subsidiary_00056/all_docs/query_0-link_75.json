        "text": "There are many software programmes to design printed circuits, whether free of charge or not, from the prototyping phase through to industrialisation. How to choose between freeware for DIY fans and complex software suites costing tens of thousands of dollars ?\n\nBased on Proto-Electronics client preferences, we have drawn up the top 10 best electronics CAD software programmes.\n\n1. Eagle\n\nEAGLE is a PCB design software developed by the German CadSoft Computer GmbH created by Rudolf Hofer and Klaus-Peter Schmidiger in 1988. The company was acquired by Farnell in 2009 and by Autodesk in 2016, a world class software heavyweight with over 2 billion euros of turnover. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor.\n\nAutodesk EAGLE:\n\nThe software is available in 3 versions:\n\nEAGLE Free: the limited trial version for DIY fans\n\nEAGLE standard: 99 diagram sheets, 4 signal layers and a 160 cm² printed circuit area\n\nEAGLE Premium: the professional version with 999 diagram sheets, 16 signal layers and an unlimited printed circuit area\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nDiagram editor (connected to the library, electric rules, generation of an interconnection list)\n\nAnnotation of changes between the diagram and the PCB\n\nDiagram hierarchy\n\nLayout diagram with advanced features\n\nEAGLE has the advantage of being one of the PCB design software heavyweights. At a reasonable cost of $500/year, it has a significant community that puts tutorials online. It also has an extensive component library and runs in a Mac OS X or Linux environment.\n\nHowever, John Teel, the electronics design expert on the PredictableDesigns.com blog finds the EAGLE graphic interface both complex and not user-friendly.\n\n2. Altium\n\nFounded in 1985 as Protel Systems in Australia, the company changed its name to Altium in 2001. Currently American, it is a PCB modelling creation software leader. The firm has 6000 new users every year and is aiming for a 200 million dollar turnover in 2020.\n\nAltium Designer\n\nOn the Altium website you can download a full free trial version for 15 days, including virtual workshops.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nDesign environment with diagrams, layout-routing, documentation and simulation\n\nDesign for Manufacturing (DFM) to guarantee that your PCB designs are functional, reliable and easy to produce\n\nEasy data migration using powerful conversion tools\n\n3D flex-rigid design\n\nPrinted circuit design\n\nDiagram design\n\nProduction file output\n\nWith a licence starting price at $7000, the Altium software suite is especially suited for electronics engineers working for major industrial groups or in the Internet of Things. It is also extensively used by universities and leading schools. On the down side, it requires a long learning phase that will discourage DIY PCB fans.\n\nAltium Design only runs on Windows according to the specifications available on their website.\n\n3.Proteus\n\nThe Proteus electronic CAD solution, was developed by Labcenter Electronics Ltd., a company founded by John Jameson in 1988 in the United Kingdom. Widespreaded, Proteus is marketed in over 50 countries\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nThis suite has two main software programmes:\n\nProteus ISI: diagram creation and electric simulation\n\nProteus ARES: printed circuit routing solution with automatic component positioning\n\nOther available Proteus modules\n\nProteus VSM\n\nFull built-in workflow\n\nDiagram design\n\nSimulation\n\nMeasurement and analysis\n\nBug correction\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nProteus PCB design software\n\nPCB design with up to 16 layers of copper\n\n14 million components in the library\n\nInteractive manual routing\n\nProteus Visual Designer\n\nCombined with Proteus VSM, it provides a complete solution to edit flow diagrams and a hardware gallery for a built-in Arduino and Raspberry Pi development environment.\n\n4.KiCad\n\nKiCad is an open source, free printed circuit design software suite. It was developed by Jean-Pierre Charras from the Grenoble IUT in France in 1992. This design software includes diagram management, PCB routing and 3D modelling possibilities for electronics engineers.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nKicad: project manager\n\nEeschema: electric diagram editor\n\nPcbnew: printed circuit editor\n\nCvpcb: utility to select the physical imprints of components used on the diagram\n\nGerbview: Gerber file viewer\n\nPcbcalculator: design aid tool to calculate resistance values, track widths, etc.\n\nCreate your free account on Proto-Electronics.com\n\nand get your PCBA quote within the next 10 minutes!\n\n5.Cadence OrCAD PCB Designer\n\nBorn in 1988 of the merger of SDA Systems and ECAD, Cadence Design Systems is currently a leader on the electronics CAD software market. Based in San José in California, it is a NASDAQ listed company with a turnover of about 2 billion dollars.\n\nCadence publishes Allegro PCB Designer and OrCAD.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nDiagrams, layout and routing\n\nInteractive, real time routing with built-in constraints\n\nAutomatic shape creation and update\n\nAutomatic BGA assistance\n\nPSpice simulation and analysis\n\nPerformance and reliability improvement while optimising costs\n\nAutomatic circuit validation\n\nElectronic circuit mechanical and electric simulation\n\nOrCAD diagrams\n\nSymbol editor\n\nBuilt-in electronic component search\n\nBuilt-in design constraints\n\n6.DesignSpark\n\nDesignSpark is an electronic CAD software programme born of the collaboration between the world leading component distributor RS Components and the Number One Systems software developer.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nDiagram entry\n\nRouting and automatic component positioning\n\nProject interface to organise design files\n\n3D viewer\n\nGerber and Excellon drilling file generation\n\n7. Protel\n\nSome people still use Protel, the former version of Altium Designer. The reasons vary from one user to the other and, as seen above, software assessments can be very subjective:\n\nLatest version too expensive?\n\nNot enough new features to justify the upgrade?\n\nNot user-friendly and not easy enough to use?\n\nDifficulties encountered by some users to adapt to the new graphic interface?\n\n8.Cadstar\n\nCadstar is another design tool for the simplest to the most complex multi-layer PCBs. Originally developed by Rascal-Redac, this software entered the Zuken portfolio, a Japanese multinational that pioneered electronics CAD software, founded in 1976 in Yokohama.\n\nCadstar is a full printed circuit board design environment, from initial design to product manufacturing.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nPrinted circuit topology and routing\n\nDiagram capture\n\nMechanical integration for data transmission using STEP or ACIS\n\nAnalysis, measurement and checks (reliability, signal integrity)\n\nLibrary management\n\nDesign review for project managers\n\n9.Sprint-Layout\n\nSprint-Layout is an electronic prototype design software published by Abacom. Using good ergonomics and capacities worthy of professional software, combined with a very competitive price, Sprint-Layout has become unavoidable for electronics engineers.\n\nFeatures and specifications\n\nAutomatic PCB routing on two sides\n\nExtensive traditional and CMS component library\n\nNew component creation\n\nGerber and Excellon file generation\n\nAnti-aliasing\n\nDesign-Rule-Check\n\n10. PADS PCB\n\nPADS is another drawing software programme developed by CADLOG, the European leader in industrial electronics software. Based in Italy, the chairman is Filippo d’Agata and the French headquarters is in Cannes.\n\nFeatures and specifications"
