        "text": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Course Descriptions\n\nOn this page:\n\nCore ECE Classes\n\nEngineering Clinics\n\nECE Electives\n\nPopular General Engineering Classes Available as ECE Electives\n\nThe ECE Curriculum consists of basic math and science classes, core ECE classes, Engineering Clinic sequence classes and ECE electives. The descriptions of all core ECE courses as well as Engineering Clinic courses are described below. For course descriptions of classes offered by other departments, such as Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics, please see the Rowan Undergraduate Catalog.\n\nCORE ECE CLASSES\n\nECE 09101 - Electrical and Computer Engineering: Solving Tomorrow's Problems (2.s.h.)\n\nElectrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is the field of engineering that has a broad reach, many real-world applications and a great impact on our lives, yet few know the impact of ECE in solving humanity’s problems. This course will introduce students to the field of ECE and provide a broad overview of its subfields and its applications through a series of hands-on project experiences based on current design trends. This course will also stimulate students’ interests in this field by demonstrating the extensive reach of ECE in solving a very wide range of current and emerging problems that most people do not even realize that are solved by advancements in ECE. Finally, this course will also provide a preview of the ECE program of study, introducing some of the most critical concepts taught throughout the curriculum, including instrumentation, microprocessor programming, embedded systems, circuit analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. This course will be taught from a hands-on and project based approach, focused on integrating many of the topics covered in the course.\n\nECE 09241: Introduction to Digital Systems (2 s.h.)\n\nDigital Systems dominate the globe, from a simple stopwatch to a cell phone to the international space station, each of these is dependent on Digital Systems. Digital systems, at the most elementary level, are composed of 0's and 1's and rudimentary logic functions. This core course takes a hands-on approach, starting with how to physically build basic logic functions (AND, OR, NOT) from transistors all the way to how to combine these functions to make complex digital systems. During this class, students will learn how numbers and information are stored and manipulated in a digital system, and how these basic principals can be expanded to create a computer processor. The focus of the course will be on alternative number systems (Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal), Boolean algebra, minimization, combinational circuit design, and sequential circuit design. Both synchronous and asynchronous network design and state machines will be covered. Students will get hands-on experience using modern development tools to design, test, and implement digital systems. Taken during the Fall semester of the first year, this is the first class in the ECE major curriculum and provides an opportunity to jump right into the modern world of electrical and computer engineering on day 1.\n\nECE 09203: Principles of Electric Circuit Analysis (4 s.h.)\n\nThe fundamental principles of circuit and network theory constitute the very foundation on which the field of electrical engineering stands. From a simple household item such as a toaster or flashlight to the most advanced devices, large-scale electric power distribution and transmission systems, including such emerging topics as smart grid, photovoltaic energy generation to electric vehicle technology, all operate based on the basic concepts of circuit and network theory. This core course, which constitutes the primary prerequisite of most other ECE courses, is designed to provide the students not only with a comprehensive foundation of circuit and network theory, but also the basic skills of circuit analysis, design, and testing. Starting with Ohm's Law, this course first discusses resistive and DC circuits and introduces Kirchhoff's Laws, Thevenin and Norton equivalents of networks, mesh and nodal analysis, followed by independent and dependent sources, and operational amplifiers. The second half of the course focuses on AC circuits and memristors. Laplace transforms will be introduced for transient and steady state response of networks, followed by various applications of AC circuits, such as filters. Computer-aided analysis and simulation tools are also presented as contemporary methods of network analysis and design.\n\nECE 09243: Computer Architecture (3 s.h.)\n\nAs computer and embedded systems proliferate into every area of life it is critical to understand the underlying technology empowering the digital age.

All modern-day electronic devices consist largely of these nonlinear devices including diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. The electronics may consist of discrete and/or integrated devices. This course begins with the design and analysis of electronic circuits using “real” (non-ideal) op amps. It then provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals of circuits involving diodes, bipolar-junction transistors and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. The emphasis of this class is on designing practical circuits and includes multistage amplifiers, differential amplifiers, circuits combining op amps with discrete elements, audio amplifiers, integrated circuits, and analog and digital techniques. Analysis and design are accomplished first through analytical design, followed by computer simulation (SPICE) and finally real-world implementation through hands-on laboratory experiments.\n\nECE 09321: Systems And Control I (3 s.h.)\n\nThe first course in control systems introduces the fundamental concepts of linearity, time-invariance, stability and the transfer function. Mathematical and circuit equivalence of different systems (electrical, mechanical, fluidic, and thermal) are established.
