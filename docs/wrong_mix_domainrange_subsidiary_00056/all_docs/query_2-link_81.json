        "text": "Farhad Mafie, SoC Conference Chairman, Savant Company Inc., President & CEO, IEEE OC SSCS & OCEN Chairs.\n\n\"Welcome and Opening Remarks, Technology/Market Trends.\"\n\nFarhad Mafie is President and CEO of Savant Company Inc., a technology marketing company in Irvine, CA.

X-FAB.\n\nSOI technologies at X-FAB and their application space.\n\nAbstract: X-FAB has a long history in providing SIO technologies. The earliest SOI technologies have 1µm minimum feature size. They are, however, quite different in process feature and voltage range. As examples may serve the XD10, enabling a voltage range up to about 700V, which isolation is achieved through deep trenches. The etching technology for these trenches has enhanced over the years and nowadays provides a significant contribution to the MEMS technologies of X-FAB. Trench isolation is also used by the XT06 with 0.6µm minimum feature size, bearing medium voltage (60V) devices, and the XT018 with 0.18µm minimum feature size, providing up to 200V and low voltage devices at around 20V. Of course both all technologies have digital devices with the standard voltages of their size class (XD10, XT06: 5V and XT018: 1.8V). All SOI technologies have in common that the potentials of the devices can be freely chosen as they are isolated against the handle wafer. Additionally the high leakage currents to substrate at high temperature, as in diode isolated technologies, are of no concern due to the dielectric isolation. This is the main distinguishing factor to common bulk technologies and enables a very high temperature range. The freedom of potential enables a wide application range, where isolation between different system parts is necessary. Possible applications are driver circuits for IGBT modules, full bridge rectifiers and multi voltage domain systems. For an IGBT driver, with the XD10 process all three high side driver and the threefold low side driver can be located on one chip. The XT06 is widely used in applications serving two or more voltage levels, even below the ground level of the board. The XT018 is serving applications, where large switch arrays are used. Most of these applications are very difficult to achieve with pure CMOS technologies. The presentation will guide listeners through some examples in more detail and explain why an SOI solution is chosen for this particular SoC.\n\nPaul Poenisch is an electrical engineer working in the applications group within the marketing department of X-Fab. His research work focused on modeling of photolithograph processes. He has been in the semiconductor industry for over 32 years working on process and device development for about 25 of those years then switching to the process application area. In that role he works with customers to optimize the application of X-Fab processes to their products.

This is the beginning of a new era in the IC industry using 3D transistors. At this scale, traditional 2D MOSFETs suffer from a host of problems including variability and power dissipation. One of first demonstration of FinFETs and UTB-SOI transistors on silicon was from the Device Group at UC Berkeley. Multi-gate transistor structures and novel devices will continue to evolve and find place in mainstream technologies post 22nm node. Several advanced device structures are attractive and each has a different performance-cost profile. It is likely that more than one multiple gate structure will be brought to production. Compact models for these advanced devices are needed for technology/circuit development. Furthermore, it is more accurate to compare the device/circuit performances of various device structures using a single compact model sharing as many common modules as possible. We have developed BSIM-MG, a versatile production-ready SPICE model that can capture the behavior of FinFETs, Trigate, UTB-SOI, UTBB-SOI, Gate-all-around (vertical and horizontal) transistors in a unified framework. The model is comprehensive in terms of capturing the various physical effects observed in the multi-gate MOSFETs. One cannot measure device characteristics for all geometries (length, fin height and thickness). The model consists of analytical expressions for currents and capacitances derived from a physical formulation of the device which facilitates accurate extrapolation of device characteristics using parameters tuned to a limited sample set. An analytical description as opposed to time consuming numerical simulations leads to rapid circuit prototyping. The model anticipates effects of advanced technology such as edge effects of multi-fin structures which helps avoiding expensive re-design cycles and leads to faster concept-to-market time. The model not only aims to aid producing digital applications in these advanced technologies, but also foresees analog and RF-CMOS applications by capturing higher order non-linearity through accurate description of self-heating, non-quasi-static effects, and noise etc. BSIM-MG is currently undergoing standardization at the Compact Model Council and is already being deployed in various stages at industries.\n\nBio: Sriramkumar received his B.Tech in Electrical Engg. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India in 2008 and M.S in Electrical Engg. from University of California, Berkeley in 2009. He is currently a Graduate Student Researcher with the BSIM Group working under the guidance of industry-renowned Prof. Chenming Hu (TSMC Distinguished Professor in Graduate School) at UC Berkeley. He has been involved in the research and development of turn-key SPICE Compact Models for FinFETs, TriGate, Gate-All-Around transistors (BSIM-CMG), UTB-SOI, UTBB-SOI and Independent Multi Gate transistors (BSIM-IMG) and more recently BSIM6 (an RF design relevant update to BSIM4). His interests are in semiconductor device physics and technology-design interaction. He worked as research intern at Texas Instruments (2011), IMEC (2007) and California Institute of Technology, Pasadena (2006). He was a recipient of number of awards including Frank and Lucas Margaret Fellowship (2008-09) and Caltech-Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (2006).\n\nProfessor Jiro Ida, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Japan.\n\nStatus of Fully Depleted (FD) SOI Technology and Prospect of New Super Steep Cut Off FETs for Ultra Low Power and Harsh Applications.\n\nAbstract: Present status of SOI device, including ET (extreme thin)-SOI, 3D-FIN, are reviewed. And, FD-SOI technology which already has been in mass production in Japan is shown and discussed from view point of device and circuit interaction on Ultra Low Power Digital, Analog, and RF applications. The capability of FD-SOI is indicated for expanding Ultra Low power Application. The rad-hard related projects of JAXAs (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) space application and KEKs (High Energy Accelerator Organization in Japan) SOI pixel detector are also introduced. Finally, the recent topics of the super steep cut off transistors which S-value is over the theoretical limit, aiming for the future usage on the ultra low voltage power supply, are reviewed. And, some data of the steep S-value obtained by floating body effect in SOI transistor, which is one of the impact ionization MOS (I-MOS), are introduced.\n\nBio: Dr. Ida had leaded Logic process integrations and FD-SOI Technology at OKI Electric Industry Co., Ltd. in Japan. He also had served as a program committee member of Symposium on VLSI Technology, IEEE international SOI Conf. and SOI Subcommittee of CMC (Compact Model Council) , and was a leader, is now an advisory member of Japan PIDS (Process Integration and Device Structure) Group of ITRS(International Technology Roadmap of Semiconductor). He moved to Kanazawa Institute of Technology as a professor in 2009. He has continued R&D on SOI with many partners in Japan and is interested in device and circuit interaction for ultra low power applications.\n\nZvi Or-Bach, President & CEO, MonolithIC 3D Inc.\n\nPanelist.\n\nBio: Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of MonolithIC 3D Inc., a Finalist of the Best of Semicon West 2011 for its monolithic 3D-IC breakthrough.

Johns Hopkins University.\n\nKeynote: Designing SoC That Speak The Same Language as the Nervous System.\"\n\nAbstract: Key barriers to permanent adoption and continuous use of prosthetic devices are their limited functionality and incompatibility with natural human actions. E.g., standard upper limb prosthetics require retraining of remaining muscles, or abnormal contortion of remaining parts of the limb to open/close non-anthropomorphic manipulators. In 2005 a program was initiated by the US Government to develop an upper limb prosthetic device that would be neurally integrated to the body. That is, the prosthetic limb would decode the intent of the user via motor cortex neural recordings, and feedback sensation by somatosenory cortex stimulation. The lofty goal was to develop prosthetic arms that were indistinguishable from native ones. As can be expected, despite the quantum leaps of innovation resulting from the program, the ultimate goal of the project remains to be achieved. There are many reasons for the elusiveness of the goal, among them is the need to develop electronics that interface seamlessly with the nervous system, and communicate with it in the same spike-based and neural encoding language.

It is then of general importance for our lives to sustain the traffic growth for future. On the other hand, the current network technologies are facing many fundamental limits from physical to transport layer: the so-called nonlinear Shannon limit; fiber Rayleigh scattering loss limit; quantum limit of optical amplifiers; electronic devices linewidth limits; thermal noise limit; TCP bottleneck etc.. And recently, the energy bottleneck of IP routers is looming due to the rapid penetration of the broadband access to the Internet. This talk will point out that optical technologies are the key for sustainable growth of traffic overcoming the fundamental bottlenecks, while the challenges have yet to be addressed. The 'dynamic optical path network' technologies, recently promoted by authors' group, are expected to enable the capacity of the network to ever scale without an energy crunch, circumventing the fundamental limits mentioned above. As we look at the ingredients of the traffic, the video related contents are the main driver of the traffic growth, which would be better served through path provisioning rather than packet processing. Then, the appropriateness of the optical path switching in conjunction with space-division multiplexing is discussed in this context. Discussions will follow to clarify the key enabling technologies for the proposed dynamic optical path network, and with these technologies given, we will argue that the total energy consumption could be so low as to avoid the energy crunch despite allowing sustainable traffic growth.\n\nBio: Shu Namiki (M03) received M.

These applications require significant processing power, which ultimately translates to more power consumption, a challenge that has plagued processor design for over a decade. To date, most processor engineers have had to choose between power and performance when it comes to designing their products. One way to address this core issue is by using a self-timed asynchronous architecture. The general characteristics of asynchronous circuits are extremely appealing and hold the potential to address many of the key issues (power consumption, process variation, EMI, etc.) facing processor designers in ever smaller geometries. While much research has been done over the years in the area of asynchronous circuits, and many attempts have been made to apply them to various processors, the results to date have been commercially disappointing. In general those attempts have suffered from one or more of the following drawbacks:\n\n the realized performance was equal or less than that of state-of-the-art synchronous design,\n\n the silicon cost was significantly higher than the realized gains justify,\n\n the circuits needed unique and new silicon elements requiring characterization for reliability at every new process node, and\n\n the realized processor required new software skills and tools to fully exploit the advantages.\n\nA new asynchronous architecture has emerged that may hold the key to the next generation of processor design and manufacturing by meeting and even exceeding needs in the areas of power and performance. The key to this new architecture is using proven design techniques in new ways. These techniques include source-synchronous clocking and innovative static timing tools. Using this new asynchronous design methodology, processor designers can achieve a 3:1 improvement in power efficiency over current technologies, while maintaining the current software programming paradigm. Octasic has applied this asynchronous technology to a homegrown DSP core, labeled Opus. Opus 1, the first generation was commercialized in 2008, and serves in the telecommunications infrastructure market. This year, Opus 2, the 2nd generation DSP core, is being released to market. This device covers application spaces including video transcoding and LTE picocells. This presentation will describe the OCT2224 system on chip. It is composed of 24 Opus2 DSP cores as well as an application processor and associated peripherals. Video and wireless baseband processing benchmarks will be presented that show how this DSP Core delivers 3:1 the performance per watt of any competing DSP core in the same process node. Following this, the presentation will demonstrate how this asynchronous technology can be applied to almost any general-purpose CPU and deliver the same 3:1 improvement in power efficiency. The example given will be based on an ARM A8 implementation. This technology can therefore be applied to a broad range of processors and applications, ranging from network infrastructure equipment to application processors for mobile devices.\n\nBio: Michel Laurence, Executive Chairman, Founder and CEO.

This uprising of interest in 3D technology presents a unique opportunity to SoC designers to develop all-inclusive 3D SoC designs that incorporate both 3D visual processing solutions and 3D audio IP that can then be integrated by OEMs to deliver the full 3D experience on their products. For this technical session, I would like to discuss the surround sound paradigm shift, 3D audio and how it works, why 3D picture only delivers half of the 3D experience, possible alterations to the SoC architecture to support true multi-dimensional audio, a few of SRS DSP Core partnerships and how through the incorporation of SRS 3D audio rendering solutions, SoC platform developers can add value to their design and sell through to more OEMs.\n\nBio: Alan Kraemer has over 25 years experience in sales and engineering.

At the SoC level , multi-core designs are now the driver in increasing the performance in systems from mobile processors to high performance servers. With the shrinking technology nodes, interconnect delay is a key performance limiter and also results in increased power dissipation from the excessive repeaters that need to be added to minimize the impact of the delay. Compounded with the interconnect effect, IOs have not scaled in accordance and grow at a much lower rate resulting in interfaces that are inefficient. 3D-Integration has been an area of active research to address these limitations and also offers the capability to increase system integration through stacking of heterogeneous technologies such as memory stacking on multi-core SoCs. We present the impact of multi-channel 3D-stacked DRAM on system performance and efficiency (performance/watt) in such stacked systems when compared to planar (2D) systems.\n\nBio: Sachin Idgunji is a Principal Engineer in the Research and Development Group at ARM.

DRAM performance is largely limited by the need to address and access data from the memory location furthest from the external pins. Marching memory uses DRAM based memory cell technology but reorganizes the column and row structure. Marching memory is organized to synchronize memory columns in minimizing the wire length between memory cells and the operational units. A side benefit is lower energy consumption in a smaller packaging format. Marching memory removes the memory bottleneck by designing a memory so that its access time corresponds to the cycle time of the executing processor. The basic idea is to create a memory structure wherein the data is scheduled to arrive at a fixed physical memory port for immediate use by the processors functional units. Essentially the data comes to the processor rather than the processor searching randomly for the data.\n\nIn its most basic form the Simple Marching memory corresponds to a vector processor whose data is shifted to the processing pins one column after another. The Extended Marching memory introduces modes to enable columns to shift right, left or stay in place. The Complex Marching memory partitions the entire memory array into units of Extended Marching memory whose outputs are bussed to the external chip pins. Through this mechanism the Complex Marching memory achieves a restricted random access.\n\n(based on joint work with Michael Flynn)\n\nBio: Tadao Nakamura received his PhD from Tohoku University in 1972.

Breuer, USC.\n\nThe Three Rs: Reliability, Redundancy and Reconfiguration.\n\nAbstract: Due to trends in CMOS scaling and the imminent emergence of new computational fabrics, issues related to process variations, defects and noise have resulted in large variations in yield, performance and capability/capacity associated with the mass production of a given design. In the past, test engineers addressed many of these issues. But now it appears that the problems are so great, and solutions proposed by test engineers so costly, that new paradigms are needed. I will suggest three such approaches in this talk, namely (1) that design engineers focus on yield with the same intensity that they have given to logic minimization, high performance and low power; (2) that redundancy can be effectively used for logic and not be restricted to memories; and (3) adopt the premise that all complex chips are defective, and high yield is obtained via identification via diagnosis of circuitry that is functional, and then reconfigure the circuitry so that a marketable product is realized.\n\nBio: Melvin A.

Unlike prior work in the 2D plane, the extra dimension makes it possible to share resources at a fine granularity between vertically stacked cores. As a result, each core can grow\n\nor shrink resources, as needed by the code running on the core. This architecture, therefore, enables run-time customization of cores at a fine granularity, enables efficient execution at both high and low levels of thread level parallelism, enables fine-grain thermal management, and enables fine-grain reconfiguration around faults. With this architecture, we achieve performance gains from 9-41%, depending on the number of executing threads, and gain significant advantage in energy-efficiency.\n\nBio: Houman Homayoun received the PhD degree from the department of computer science at the University of California Irvine in 2010.
