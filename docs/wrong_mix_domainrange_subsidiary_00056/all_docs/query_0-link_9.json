        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS), a leader in global electronic design innovation, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Forte Design Systems, a provider of SystemC-based high-level synthesis (HLS) and arithmetic IP.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140102/SF39436LOGO)\n\nThe completion of this transaction enhances Cadence's HLS offering and will enable Cadence to further drive a SystemC standard flow for design and multi-language verification. Growth in this sector is fueled by design teams migrating from hand-coded RTL design to SystemC-based design and verification to address increasing IP complexity and the need for rapid retargeting of IP to derivative architectures.\n\nThe Forte team, including its full executive team, will join the System & Verification Group led by senior vice president Charlie Huang.\n\nAbout Cadence\n\nCadence (NASDAQ: CDNS) enables global electronic design innovation and plays an essential role in the creation of today's integrated circuits and electronics.
