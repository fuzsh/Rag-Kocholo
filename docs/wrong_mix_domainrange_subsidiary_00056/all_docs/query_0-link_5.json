        "text": "Cadence Design Systems, Inc. has completed its previously announced acquisition of BETA CAE Systems International AG, a provider of multi-domain, engineering simulation solutions. BETA CAE accelerates Cadence’s Intelligent System Design strategy by expanding its multiphysics system analysis suite with complementary products, enabling Cadence to offer a more comprehensive portfolio to its customers. BETA CAE has a footprint in the automotive vertical sector and at companies in the aerospace, industrial and healthcare industries.\n\nBETA CAE has annual revenue of about $90 million, and Cadence continues to expect BETA CAE to contribute about $40 million to its 2024 revenue. Cadence still expects the transaction to be approximately 12 cents dilutive to its 2024 earnings per share and become accretive in 2025, both on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nSources: Press materials received from the company and additional information gleaned from the company’s website."
