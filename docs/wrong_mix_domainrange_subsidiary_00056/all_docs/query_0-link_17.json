        "text": "Brief Description\n\nCommandCAD, Inc. offers software solutions that enable foundries and design teams to achieve strategically critical efficiencies in the development of next generation chips and technologies. The integrated circuits layout technology is designed for architectural, construction, and woodworking designs. The company's integrated circuits layout optimization technology enhances physical verification and yield optimization by linking design data to metrology, and hotspot analysis, and improving optical proximity correction for design.\n\nCommandCad's core technology was born out of Frank Gennari's work on the identification of layout patterns that cause yield problems while he was a PhD student in the lab of UC Berkeley Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Andrew Neureuther. Gennari (Berkeley EECS PhD, 2004) co-founded CommandCAD with fellow UC Berkeley students Matt Moskewicz (Berkeley EE PhD, 2017) and Ya-Chieh Lai (Berkeley MBA, 2004), along with Martin Lefebvre, former CEO of Cadabra Design Automation, who was at UC Berkeley as part of an Executive in Residence program. UC Berkeley Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Kurt Keutzer served as CommandCAD's technical advisor.\n\nCommandCAD, Inc. was acquired by Cadence Design Systems, Inc. in 2007.\n\nTimeline\n\n2004. Company founded.\n\n2007. Cadence Design Systems Inc. (NAS: CDNS) acquires CommandCAD, Inc.\n\nInventors\n\nKonstantinos Adam, Frank Gennari, Andrew Neureuther, Garth Robins"
