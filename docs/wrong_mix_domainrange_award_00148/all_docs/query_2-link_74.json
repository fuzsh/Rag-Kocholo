This document provides biographical information about Wilhelm Röntgen and Hendrik Lorentz, two physicists who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in the early 20th century. It details Röntgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895 and his experiments investigating their properties, for which he received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. It also discusses Lorentz's theoretical work on electromagnetism and relativity that contributed to Einstein's theory of special relativity, earning him a share of the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman.",
