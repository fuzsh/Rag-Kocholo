The first medal was awarded to Max Planck. Among the 23 laureates are 11 Nobel Prize winners. The prize consists of a medal engraved with the image of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and a symposium honouring the laureate's research.\n\nWho may submit a nomination?\n\nThe following parties may nominate candidates for the Prize:\n\nBoards of management and deans of universities in the Netherlands or elsewhere;\n\nDirectors of scientific research institutes in the Netherlands or elsewhere;\n\nIndividual researchers at universities or scientific institutions in the Netherlands or elsewhere;\n\nScience academies and other scientific institutions in the Netherlands or elsewhere"
