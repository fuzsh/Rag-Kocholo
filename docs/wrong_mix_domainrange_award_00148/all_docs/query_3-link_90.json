Sanders Auctions (http://www.NateDSanders.com).\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz Autograph\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz was a Dutch physicist who won one half of the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman. The work of Lorentz and Zeeman assisted Albert Einstein with his special theory of relativity. Lorentz also received many other awards including the Rumford Medal and Copley Medal from the Fellows of the Royal Society.\n\nNate D. Sanders Auctions sold a Hendrik Antoon Lorentz autograph for $1,063. Please see below for lot details:\n\nNobel Prize Winning Physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz Writes a Letter of Recommendation for Fellow Physicist Paul Epstein — ”He has especially contributed to the development of the quantum theory”\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz autograph letter signed, dated 15 August 1921 from Haarlem, Netherlands where he taught at the University of Leiden. The Nobel Prize winning physicist writes a letter of recommendation for fellow physicist Paul Sophus Epstein, reading in part, ”Dr. Paul S. Epstein’s scientific work has given me the impression that he is one of the very best of young physicists. He combines great mathematical skill with a keen understanding of physical problems and has obtained results that will undoubtedly be of lasting value. / He has especially contributed to the development of the quantum theory…Indeed, whereas the older theories of light and electricity were unable to account for the effect discovered by Stark, the splitting of spectral lines by the action of electric force, Epstein succeeded in giving a full and highly satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon…following the principles underlying Bohr’s theory of spectra, he deduced not only the great number of components observed with many spectral lines, but also the absolute values of their mutual distances…I have come to appreciate very much his vast knowledge of the facts and theories of modern physics…H.A. Lorentz”. Later in 1921, Epstein was recruited to teach at Caltech, where he remained the rest of his career. Two page letter on bifolium stationery measures 8.5” x 10.75”. Folds and a few chips to edges, else near fine condition. Sold for $1,063.\n\nWe also sold the following items:\n\nScarce Richard Feynman Signed First Edition, First Printing of His Memoir, ”Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”\n\nVery scarce Richard P.

Wilson in 1975\n\nThe 1975 (inaugural year) Boltzmann Medal awarded to theoretical physicist Kenneth G. Wilson. Wilson would later win the Nobel Prize in 1982 for his work on phase transitions, providing profound insight into the field of statistical physics and quantum mechanics. The Boltzmann Medal is the most esteemed prize awarded to physicists working in the field of statistical mechanics. Named after physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, only 24 medals have been awarded as winners are selected once every 3 years. This 10kt gold medal features the relief portrait of Ludwig Boltzmann to front, with his name and the years of his birth and death. Verso features raised lettering which reads, ”I.U. P.A.P. / COMMISSION ON THERMODYNAMICS AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS”, in addition to cursive etching in center: ”Kenneth G. Wilson / 1975”. Rim includes stamp: ”BIRKS 10K”. Medal weighs 104 grams or just over 3.6 oz. and measures 2.5” in diameter. Some tarnishing to both sides, overall very good condition. With an LOA from Kenneth Wilson’s widow. Sold for $7,499.\n\nAuction your Hendrik Antoon Lorentz autograph at Nate D. Sanders Auctions.
