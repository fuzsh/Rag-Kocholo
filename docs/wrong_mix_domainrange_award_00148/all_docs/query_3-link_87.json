        "text": "Distinguished science\n\nHubert Pellikaan is a firm believer in science. He likes to talk a lot about that, but he also practices what he preaches. He approaches all of his creations with the same scientific precision.\n\nThis design is inspired by the scientific ideas of Hendrik Lorenz, who gained fame as the scientific father of Albert Einstein. The relatively wide strap and lugs are also inspired by watches from the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1902, Lorenz received the Nobel Prize in Physics (Hubert really loves to explain you why). But what you really should know: the local time theory by Mr. Lorenz is the main inspiration for this design.\n\nThese local times are also seen on the schales of the dial, which are different for every hand. Now that’s something to study carefully!\n\nThis ‘speed of light’ edition has a beautiful black dial with white hands."
