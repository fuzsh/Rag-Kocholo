        "meta_description": "The Quantum Theory. Present Day Problems and Outstanding Questions of the Quantum Theory. Notes accompanying lectures delivered by Professor H. A. Lorentz at Cornell University, Fall Term 1926. [Ithaca: 1927.] 8vo. 79 ff, mimeographed on rectos only. Original plain paper wrappers stapled at spine, title in manuscript to front wrapper. Wrappers worn with damp-stain at spine (text not affected), corner of back wrapper torn away at spine, some occasional light marginal spotting to text, a couple of leaves dog-eared, still a very good copy of a rare and fragile item. Provenance : Physicist Harvey Elliot White, with his manuscript note to fly-leaf: \" During my second year of graduate study at Cornell University I was assigned the honor of working with H.A. Lorentz in compiling these notes for six lectures he gave in the Physics Department. Lorentz died later that year in Holland. \" QUANTUM THEORY TAUGHT BY A NOBEL PRIZE WINNING PHYSICIST: FIRST PRINTING OF THE NOTES FOR LORENTZ'S LECTURES AT CORNELL. Lorentz is known for laying the foundation for Einstein's later work in special relativity, including deriving the transformation equations that Einstein used to describe space and time; in fact the theory of relativity was originally called the Lorentz-Einstein theory. Given in the Fall of 1926, Lorentz provided attendees with the most up to date information in the field. The series of 6 lectures begins with Bohr's theory of the atom and a classical explanation of spectral lines, and moves through to the Schrödinger wave equation that is generally considered to be the founding principle of the modern quantum theory. Lorentz was indeed the person best suited to deliver lectures such as these, as his own work and career spanned the shift from classical interpretation to the new theory. Lorentz was the first to recognize Max Planck's breakthrough with his discovery of energy quanta and embrace the new physics, he chaired the historic 1911 Solvay Conference on physics and chemistry, and was the first person to explain, interpret and add to the Maxwell field equations. He shared the 1902 Nobel prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman for their discovery and explanation of the Zeeman effect.",
