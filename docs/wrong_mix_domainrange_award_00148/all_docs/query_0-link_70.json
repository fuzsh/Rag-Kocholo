        "text": "Harald became the first of the Bohr brothers to earn a master’s degree. Niels earned his 9 months later. The students in his class had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr’s supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he gave them was the electron theory of metals. Bohr then elaborated his master’s thesis in to his much larger theory “Doctor of Philosophy” thesis. He questioned the literature on the subject ,settling on a model assumed by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz ,which stated in which the electrons on a meta; are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr enlarged Lorentz model, but still unable to account for singularities like the Hall Effect, and decided that the electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The theory was directed in April of 1911, and Bohr conducted his defense in May of 1911. Bohr’s thesis was groundbreaking, but didn’t attracted much attention outside of Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921 the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen independently derived a theorem from Bohr’s theory and today that is known as the Bohr−van Leeuwen Theorem. In 1911 Bohr traveled to England, which was where most of theoretical work in the structures of atoms were being done. He met with J.J. Thomson of Cavendish Laboratory and Trinity College, Cambridge. He attended lectures on electromagnetism given by James jean and Joseph Larmor and decided to do some research on cathode rays, but failed to impress Thomson. He had more success with younger physicists like Australian William Lawrence Bragg, and New Zealand’s Ernest Rutherford, whose 1911 Rutherford method of the atom had challenged...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...ns Cemetery in the Norrebro section of Copenhagen, along with the rest of his family that had passed before. October 7, 1965, the institute was officially renamed it to what it unofficially had been called: the Niels Bohr Institute.\n\nAlthough Bohr Died his legacy didn’t . In 1912 He and Margrethe got married and soon after the wedding they had children ,they had 6 sons. The oldest son Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934 and another Harald died from childhood meningitis. Aage Bohr became a very successful physicist, and in 1975 he was also awarded a Nobel Prize in physics like his father. Hans Henrik becam a physician; Erik became a chemical engineer and Ernest became a lawyer. Each of the men followed In the Bohr men footsteps ,Like uncle Harald, Ernest Bohr became an Olympic Athlete , he played field hockey for Denmark in the summer of 1948 in London."
