That Dutch man is our \"scientist of the day\" today. \n\nIt's death anniversar of #HendrikAntoonLorentz, the man who set the stage for Albert Einstein - -\n\n(Scientist of the Day - 04 February) \n\nDuring the 19th century important connections between #electricity, #magnetism and #light were clarified by Hendrik Lorentz. In 1892 he presented his #electron theory, which posited that in matter there are charged particles, electrons, that conduct electric current and whose oscillations give rise to light. Hendrik Lorentz's electron theory could explain Pieter Zeeman's discovery in 1896 that the spectral lines corresponding to different wavelengths split up into several lines under the influence of a magnetic field.\n\nAbout Lorentz transformations:- Look the equations, shown in image. The so-called  Lorentz transformations (1904) was based on the fact that #electromagnetic forces between #charges are subject to slight #alterations due to their #motion, resulting in a minute #contraction in the size of moving bodies. It not only adequately explains the apparent absence of the relative motion of the #Earth with respect to the #ether, as indicated by the experiments of #Michelson and #Morley, but also paved the way for Einsteinâ€™s special theory of relativity.\n\nHe also worked to improve dams by developing equations for the movement of water, work that made practical use of his theoretical knowledge.\n\nAccording to the biography published by the Nobel Foundation, \"It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical physicists as the world's leading spirit, who completed what was left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the #quantum theory.\"\n\nHe received many other honours and distinctions, including a term as chairman of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (the forerunner of UNESCO) between 1925 and 1928.\".",
