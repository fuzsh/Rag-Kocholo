Reference must be made to this article for a complete account of his scientific work and its significance in the progress of physics. It will suffice to state here that Lorentz was born at Arnheim, Holland, on July 18, 1853, and received his early training at the University of Leyden, where he became professor of theoretical physics in 1878. In 1902 he received the Nobel Prize for Physics; in 1905 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society; three years later he received its Rumford Medal, and in 1918 the Copley Medal. Such was his record; his personal qualities are described in the following brief messages with which we have been favoured.",
