Once every four years the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences awards the Lorentz Medal to a scientist in recognition of their groundbreaking contributions to theoretical physics.

The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences calls on the theoretical physics community to nominate candidates that should be considered for this prestigious honour.

The Lorentz Medal award was established in 1925 to honour Nobel laureate Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853-1928). The first medal was awarded to Max Planck. Among the 23 laureates are 11 Nobel Prize winners. The prize consists of a medal engraved with the image of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and a symposium honouring the laureate's research.

Who may submit a nomination?

The following parties may nominate candidates for the Prize:

Boards of management and deans of universities in the Netherlands or elsewhere;

Directors of scientific research institutes in the Netherlands or elsewhere;

Individual researchers at universities or scientific institutions in the Netherlands or elsewhere;

Science academies and other scientific institutions in the Netherlands or elsewhere
