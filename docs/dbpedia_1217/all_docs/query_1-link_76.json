        "text": "The Origin of the Mures\n\nClan Muir has to be one of the most fascinating, unique, powerful, wealthiest and influential clans in Scotland. There are two main questions that has to be answer; the first question is What origins did the Mure family/ clan came from? And what's their history about? The reason these questions are so popular, is that clan Muir's history seem to have disappear over time. Well, after many years of research that I have done; I can say for certain that I can answer those two questions. According to some people that we originate in the Strathclyde Kingdom, others say that we came from the Picts of Scotland and Ireland and there are few other legends and myths about our origins. The fact is that all the variant spellings of Muir, Mur, Mure, Mor, More, Moore, ect... throughout the world, are all linked to one tribe and one point of origin.\n\nYou might ask what Tribe did the Muirs came from, and that tribe is called \" The Milesian Tribe\", in which the Celt race came from. The Milesians point of origin is located in Scythia. These Scythians were among the earliest people to master mounted warfare. These Scythians eventually became one of the ten lost tribes of Israel, The Milesian, then became the Celtic race, then became the Galicians, Irish and then the Scottish people. These Milesians became excellent warriors as well as wanders, and prosperous in construction, agriculture, and many other things. According to legend of the Milesians; that one of their ancestors had been married to the daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt and is possibly connected with the presence of \" Chalybes\" ( or Calybes) descendants of Caleb from the tribe of Judah amongst them. The Symbol of the Milesians appears to have been a lion. The lion is also the symbols of the Tribe of Judah and the Irish O'Moores.\n\nThe Milesian Tribe\n\nIn the Lebor Gabala Erenn, a medieval Irish Christian pseudo-history, the Milesians are the final race to settle in Ireland. They represent the Irish people. The Milesians are Gaels who sail to Ireland from Hispania after spending hundreds of years travelling the earth. When they land in Ireland they contend with the Tuath De Danann, who represent the pagan gods. The two groups agree to divide Ireland between them: the Milesians take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below. They are named after the character Mil Espaine, which is the Irish form of the Latin Miles Hispaniae (\"Soldier of Hispania\"). Scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Christian writers.\n\nThe Lebor Gabala, which was probably first written in the 11th century AD by Christian monks, purports to be a history of Ireland and the Irish (the Gaels). It tells us that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah, and that a man named Fenius Farsaid ( descendant of Noah's son Japheth) is the forebear of the Gaels. Fénius, a prince of Scythia, is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel ( Read Genesis 11:1-9 of the holy bible). Goídel crafts the Goidelic ( Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. It was said that in his youth, Gaodhal, son of Niul, was bitten in the neck by a snake. He was brought to Moses, who laid his rod upon him and cured him instantly.\n\nThe snake bite left a green scar, so Gaodhal became Gaodhal Glas, because Glas means green. Gaodhal Glas also received another blessing, which was that no poisonous snake could live anywhere his posterity lived. At this time, Gaodhal Glas and his descendants painted beasts, birds, etc., on their shields in imitation of the Israelites. Asruth was a son of Gaodhal Glas. He lived in Egypt and governed his colony in peace. Sruth was a son of Asruth. Asruth frequently supported the Israelites against the Egyptians, so shortly after Asruth’s death, the Egyptians attacked Sruth and his followers.\n\nOther ancient sources say that the Egyptians attacked Sruth after the pharaoh was drowned in the Red Sea in pursuit of the Israelites. Other accounts states that while in Egypt; Fennius the Scythian met Moses and helped the Israelites when they were free to leave Egypt after the plagues that has struck Egypt. There were some Israelites who attached themselves to Fennius and travelled with the Milesians. Versions of these legends also claim that they have kept the laws of Moses in Ancient times, and this means that they were Hebrews but also keeping a separate \" Scythian\" identity were also able to claim descent from Magog, son of\n\nJaphet. It's also claim that one of the Milesian married into the tribe of Judah and settled into the areas of the ten tribes settlement.\n\nRemember the Milesians symbol has been a lion; the same as the Judah tribe. It is also claim that the Milesian tribe wander with the Israelites and Moses for 400 years in the wilderness. The word Celt is the Anglicized form of the Greek word \" Keltoi\" which means \" The people who are different.\" The Celts are part of the Ten tribes and the Milesians are part of Judah ( which the O'Mordha/ Muir clans are descendants from) and Zarahites. What is interesting is that the Irish Celtic law was based on the Torah and is further confirmation that the Celts are indeed Israelites. If you reject your birth-right as Israelites, then you are insulting God, who gave your birth right to you, along with the Covenant.\n\nBrit ( Berit) means Covenant in Hebrew\n\nWelsh means Man or People of in Hebrew\n\nBritish means The people of the Covenant in Hebrew\n\nHebernia ( Ireland) means Hebrew's new land\n\nHeberia- Iberia ( Spain) means Hebrew's land\n\nBelow is a Chart in which it claims that our Ancestors came from Zarah's line, in which her father's name is Judah; in which the \" Tribe of Judah\" was establish. After the chart below, I will give you the exact genealogy that connect it all. The Irish O'Mordhas ( O'Moores), the Scottish Clan Muir and other Moores/ More/ Mor/ Mure/Muir that are found worldwide in India, Mainland Europe are all connected thru the House of Ir.\n\nThe Milesian Genealogy\n\nThe following genealogy of the Milesian Tribe in which the O'Mordha clan of Ireland came from. Also to mention that the Mores in India and throughout the European Nations such as Austria, Germany, Gaul ( France) Spain, Galicia, England and other nations are from the same Milesian tribe that founded the Irish O'Mordhas, and the Scottish Muirs/ Mures. God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who was from all eternity, did, in the beginning of Time, of nothing, create Red Earth; and of Red Earth framed Adam; and of a Rib out of the side of Adam fashioned Eve. After which Creation, Plasmation, and Formation, succeeded Generations, as follows.\"--Four Masters. The Scottish Clan Muir hail from Conmael line, brother of Ebric of the line of Ir. The line continues to Ugaine Mor, and all the way to Conaire Mor the founder of the Dal Riata Kingdom in Ireland.\n\n1. Adam & Eve\n\n2. Seth\n\n3. Enos\n\n4. Cainan\n\n5. Mahalaleel\n\n6. Jared\n\n7. Enoch\n\n8. Methuselah\n\n9. Lamech\n\n10. Noah divided the world amongst his three sons, begotten of his wife Titea: viz., to Shem he gave Asia, within the Euphrates, to the Indian Ocean; to Ham he gave Syria, Arabia, and Africa; and to Japhet, the rest of Asia beyond the Euphrates, together with Europe to Gades (or Cadiz).\n\n11. Japhet was the eldest son of Noah. He had fifteen sons, amongst whom he divided Europe and the part of Asia which his father had allotted to him.\n\n12. Magog: From whom descended the Parthians, Bactrians, Amazons, etc.; Partholan, the first planter of Ireland, about three hundred years after the Flood; and also the rest of the colonies that planted there, viz., the Nemedians, who planted Ireland, Anno Mundi three thousand and forty-six, or three hundred and eighteen years after the birth of Abraham, and two thousand one hundred and fifty-three years before Christ. The Nemedians continued in Ireland for two hundred and seventeen years; within which time a colony of theirs went into the northern parts of Scotland, under the conduct of their leader Briottan Maol, from whom Britain takes its name, and not from \"Brutus,\" as some persons believed. From Magog were also descended the Belgarian, Belgian, Firbolgian or Firvolgian colony that succeeded the Nemedians, Anno Mundi, three thousand two hundred and sixty-six, and who first erected Ireland into a Monarchy. [According to some writers, the Fomorians invaded Ireland next after the Nemedians.]\n\nThis Belgarian or Firvolgian colony continued in Ireland for thirty-six years, under nine of their Kings; when they were supplanted by the Tuatha-de-Danans (which means, according to some authorities, \"the people of the god Dan,\" whom they adored), who possessed Ireland for one hundred and ninety-seven years, during the reigns of nine of their kings; and who were then conquered by the Gaelic, Milesian, or Scotia Nation (the three names by which the Irish people were known), Anno Mundi three thousand five hundred. This Milesian or Scotia Irish Nation possessed and enjoyed the Kingdom of Ireland for two thousand eight hundred and eighty-five years, under one hundred and eighty-three Monarchs; until their submission to King Henry the Second of England, Anno Domini one thousand one hundred and eighty-six.\n\n13. Baoth, one of the sons of Magog; to whom Scythia came as his lot, upon the division of the Earth by Noah amongst his sons, and by Japhet of his part thereof amongst his sons.\n\n14. Phoeniusa Farsaidh (or Fenius Farsa) was King of Scythia, at the time that Ninus ruled the Assyrian Empire; and, being a wise man and desirous to learn the languages that not long before confounded the builders of the Tower of Babel, employed able and learned men to go among the dispersed multitude to learn their several languages; who sometime after returning well skilled in what they went for, Phoeniusa Farsaidh erected a school in the valley of Senaar, near the city of Æothena, in the forty-second year of the reign of Ninus; whereupon, having continued there with his younger son Niul for twenty years, he returned home to his kingdom, which, at his death, he left to his eldest son Nenuall: leaving to Niul no other patrimony than his learning and the benefit of the said school.\n\n15. Niul, after his father returned to Scythia, continued some time at Æothena, teaching the languages and other laudable sciences, until upon report of his great learning he was invited into Egypt by Pharaoh, the King; who gave him the land of Campus Cyrunt, near the Red Sea to inhabit, and his daughter Scotia in marriage: from whom their posterity are ever since called Scots; but, according to some annalists, the name \"Scots\" is derived from the word Scythia.\n\nIt was this Niul that employed Gaodhal [Gael], son of Ethor, a learned and skillful man, to compose or rather refine and adorn the language, called Bearla Tobbai, which was common to all Niul's posterity, and afterwards called Gaodhilg (or Gaelic), from the said Gaodhal who composed or refined it; and for his sake also Niul called his own eldest son \"Gaodhal.\" [The following is a translation of an extract from the derivation of this proper name, as given in Halliday's Vol. of Keating's Irish History, page 230:\n\n\"Antiquaries assert that the name of Gaodhal is from the compound word formed of 'gaoith' and 'dil,' which means a lover of learning; for, 'gaoith' is the same as wisdom or learning, and 'dil' is the same as loving or fond.\"]\n\n16. Gaodhal (or Gathelus), the son of Niul, was the ancestor of the Clan-na-Gael, that is, \"the children or descendants of Gaodhal.\" In his youth this Gaodhal was stung in the neck by a serpent, and was immediately brought to Moses, who, laying his rod upon the wounded place, instantly cured him: whence followed the word \"Glas\" to be added to his name, as Gaodhal Glas (glas: Irish, green; Lat. glaucus; Gr. glaukos), on account of the green scar which the word signifies, and which, during his life, remained on his neck after the wound was healed. And Gaodhal obtained a further blessing, namely--that no venemous beast can live any time where his posterity should inhabit; which is verified in Creta or Candia, Gothia or Getulia, Ireland, etc.\n\nThe Irish chroniclers affirm that from this time Gaodhal and his posterity did paint the figures of Beasts, Birds, etc., on their banners and shields, to distinguish their tribes and septs, in imitation of the Israelites; and that a \"Thunderbolt\" was the cognizance in their chief standard for many generations after this Gaodhal.\n\n17. Asruth, after his father's death, continued in Egypt, and governed his colony in peace during his life.\n\n18. Sruth, soon after his father's death, was set upon by the Egyptians, on account of their former animosities towards their predecessors for having taken part with the Israelites against them; which animosities until then lay raked up in the embers, and now broke out in a flame to that degree, that after many battles and conflicts, wherein most of his colony lost their lives, Sruth was forced with the few remaining to depart the country; and, after many traverses at sea, arrived at the Island of Creta (now called Candia), where he paid his last tribute to nature.\n\n19. Heber Scut (scut: Irish, a Scot), after his father's death and a year's stay in Creta, departed thence, leaving some of his people to inhabit the Island, where some of their posterity likely still remain; \"because the Island breeds no venemous serpent ever since.\" He and his people soon after arrived in Scythia; where his cousins, the posterity of Nenuall (eldest son of Fenius Farsa, above mentioned), refusing to allot a place of habitation for him and his colony, they fought many battles wherein Heber (with the assistance of some of the natives who were ill-affected towards their king), being always victor, he at length forced the sovereignty from the other, and settled himself and his colony in Scythia, who continued there for four generations. (Hence the epithet Scut, \"a Scot\" or \"a Scythian,\" was applied to this Heber, who is accordingly called Heber Scot.) Heber Scot was afterwards slain in battle by Noemus the former king's son.\n\n20. Beouman;\n\n21. Ogaman;\n\n22. Tait, were each kings of Scythia, but in constant war with the natives; so that after Tait's death his son,\n\n23. Agnon and his followers betook themselves to sea, wandering and coasting upon the Caspian Sea for\n\nseveral (some say seven) years in which time he died.\n\n24. Lamhfionn and his fleet remained at sea for some time after his father's death, resting and refreshing themselves upon such islands as they met with. It was then that Cachear, their magician or Druid, foretold that there would be no end of their peregrinations and travel until they should arrive at the Western Island of Europe, now called Ireland, which was the place destined for their future and lasting abode and settlement; and that not they but their posterity after three hundred years should arrive there. After many traverses of fortune at sea, this little fleet with their leader arrived at last and landed at Gothia or Getulia--more recently called Lybia, where Carthage was afterwards built; and, soon after, Lamhfionn died there.\n\n25. Heber Glunfionn was born in Getulia, where he died. His posterity continued there to the eighth generation; and were kings or chief rulers there for one hundred and fifty years--some say three hundred years.\n\n26. Agnan Fionn; 27. Febric Glas; 28. Nenuall; 29. Nuadhad; 30. Alladh; 31. Arcadh; and 32. Deag: of these nothing remarkable is mentioned, but that they lived and died kings in Gothia or Getulia.\n\n33. Brath was born in Gothia. Remembering the Druid's prediction, and his people having considerably multiplied during their abode in Getulia, he departed thence with a numerous fleet to seek out the country destined for their final settlement, by the prophecy of Cachear, the Druid above mentioned; and, after some time, he landed upon the coast of Spain, and by strong hand settled himself and his colony in Galicia, in the north of that country.\n\n34. Breoghan (or Brigus) was king of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal--all which he conquered. He built Breoghan's Tower or Brigantia in Galicia, and the city of Brigansa or Braganza in Portugal--called after him; and the kingdom of Castile was then also called after him Brigia. It is considered that \"Castile\" itself was so called from the figure of a castle which Brigus bore for his Arms on his banner. Brigus sent a colony into Britain, who settled in that territory now known as the counties of York, Lancaster, Durham, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, and, after him, were called Brigantes; whose posterity gave formidable opposition to the Romans, at the time of the Roman invasion of Britain.\n\n35. Bilé was king of those countries after his father's death; and his son Galamh [galav] or Milesius succeeded him. This Bilé had a brother named Ithe.\n\n36. Milesius, in his youth and during his father's life-time, went into Scythia, where he was kindly received by the king of that country, who gave him his daughter in marriage, and appointed him General of his forces. In this capacity Milesius defeated the king's enemies, gained much fame, and the love of all the king's subjects. His growing greatness and popularity excited against him the jealousy of the king; who, fearing the worst, resolved on privately despatching Milesius out of the way, for, openly, he dare not attempt it. Admonished of the king's intentions in his regard, Milesius slew him; and thereupon quitted Scythia and retired into Egypt with a fleet of sixty sail. Pharaoh Nectonibus, then king of Egypt, being informed of his arrival and of his great valor, wisdom, and conduct in arms, made him General of all his forces against the king of Ethiopia then invading his country.\n\nHere, as in Scythia, Milesius was victorious; he forced the enemy to submit to the conqueror's own terms of peace. By these exploits Milesius found great favor with Pharaoh, who gave him, being then a widower, his daughter Scotia in marriage; and kept him eight years afterwards in Egypt.\n\nDuring the sojourn of Milesius in Egypt, he employed the most ingenious and able persons among his people to be instructed in the several trades, arts, and sciences used in Egypt; in order to have them taught to the rest of his people on his return to Spain.\n\n[The original name of Milesius of Spain was, as already mentioned, \"Galamh\" (gall: Irish, a stranger; amh, a negative affix), which means, no stranger: meaning that he was no stranger in Egypt, where he was called \"Milethea Spaine,\" which was afterwards contracted to \" Milé Spaine\" (meaning the Spanish Hero), and finally to \"Milesius\" (mileadh: Irish, a hero; Lat. miles, a soldier).] At length Milesius took leave of his father-in-law, and steered towards Spain; where he arrived to the great joy and comfort of his people, who were much harasssed by the rebellion of the natives and by the intrusion of other foreign nations that forced in after his father's death, and during his own long absence from Spain. With these and those he often met; and, in fifty-four battles, victoriously fought, he routed, destroyed, and totally extirpated them out of the country, which he settled in peace and quietness.\n\nIn his reign a great dearth and famine occurred in Spain, of twenty-six years' continuance, occasioned, as well by reason of the former troubles which hindered the people from cultivating and managing the ground, as for want of rain to moisten the earth; but Milesius superstitiously believed the famine to have fallen upon him and his people as a judgment and punishment from their gods, for their negligence in seeking out the country destined for their final abode, so long before foretold by Cachear their Druid or magician, as already mentioned--the time limited by the prophecy for the accomplishment thereof being now nearly, if not fully, expired.\n\nTo expiate his fault and to comply with the will of his gods, Milesius, with the general approbation of his people, sent his uncle Ithe, with his son Lughaidh [Luy], and one hundred and fifty stout men to bring them an account of those western islands; who, accordingly, arriving at the island since then called Ireland, and landing in that part of it now called Munster, left his son with fifty of his men to guard the ship, and with the rest travelled about the island. Informed, among other things, that the three sons of Cearmad, called Mac-Cuill, MacCeacht, and MacGreine, did then and for thirty years before rule and govern the island, each for one year, in his turn; and that the country was called after the names of their three queens--Eire, Fodhla, and Banbha, respectively: one year called \"Eire,\" the next \"Fodhla,\" and the next \"Banbha,\" as their husbands reigned in their regular turns; by which names the island is ever since indifferently called, but most commonly \"Eire,\"because that MacCuill, the husband of Eire, ruled and governed the country in his turn the year that the Clan-na-Milé (or the sons of Milesius) arrived in and conquered Ireland. And being further informed that the three brothers were then at their palace at Aileach Neid, in the north part of the country, engaged in the settlement of some disputes concerning their family jewels, Ithe directed his course thither; sending orders to his son to sail about with his ship and the rest of his men, and meet him there.\n\nWhen Ithe arrived where the (Danan) brothers were, he was honourably received and entertained by them; and, finding him to be a man of great wisdom and knowledge, they referred their disputes to him for decision. That decision having met their entire satisfaction, Ithe exhorted them to mutual love, peace, and forbearance; adding much in praise of their delightful, pleasant, and fruitful country; and then took his leave, to return to his ship, and go back to Spain.\n\nNo sooner was he gone than the brothers began to reflect on the high commendations which Ithe gave of the Island; and, suspecting his design of bringing others to invade it, resolved to prevent them, and therefore pursued him with a strong party, overtook him, fought and routed his men and wounded himself to death (before his son or the rest of his men left on ship-board could come to his rescue) at a place called, from that fight and his name, Magh Ithe or \"The plain of Ithe\" (an extensive plain in the barony of Raphoe, county Donegal); whence his son, having found him in that condition, brought his dead and mangled body back into Spain, and there exposed it to public view, thereby to excite his friends and relations to avenge his murder.\n\nAnd here I think it not amiss to notify what the Irish chroniclers, observe upon this matter, viz.--that all the invaders and planters of Ireland, namely, Partholan, Neimhedh, the Firbolgs, Tuatha-de-Danans, and Clan-na-Milé, where originally Scythians, of the line of Japhet, who had the language called Bearla-Tobbai or Gaoidhilg [Gaelic] common amongst them all; and consequently not to be wondered at, that Ithe and the Tuatha-de-Danans understood one another without an Interpreter--both speaking the same language, though perhaps with some difference in the accent.\n\nThe exposing of the dead body of Ithe had the desired effect; for, thereupon, Milesius made great preparations in order to invade Ireland--as well to avenge his uncle's death, as also in obedience to the will of his gods, signified by the prophecy of Cachear, aforesaid. But, before he could effect that object, he died, leaving the care and charge of that expedition upon his eight legitimate sons by his two wives before mentioned.\n\nMilesius was a very valiant champion, a great warrior, and fortunate and prosperous in all his undertakings: witness his name of \"Milesius,\" given him from the many battles (some say a thousand, which the word \"Milé\" signifies in Irish as well as in Latin) which he victoriously fought and won, as well in Spain, as in all the other countries and kingdoms he traversed in his younger days.\n\nThe eight brothers were neither forgetful nor negligent in the execution of their father's command; but, soon after his death, with a numerous fleet well manned and equipped, set forth from Breoghan's Tower or Brigantia (now Corunna) in Galicia, in Spain, and sailed prosperously to the coasts of Ireland or Inis-Fail, where they met many difficulties and various chances before they could land: occasioned by the diabolical arts, sorceries, and enchantments used by the Tuatha-de-Danans, to obstruct their landing; for, by their magic art, they enchanted the island so as to appear to the Milesians or Clan-na-Milé in the form of a Hog, and no way to come at it (whence the island, among the many other names it had before, was called Muc-Inis or \"The Hog Island\"); and withal raised so great a storm, that the Milesian fleet was thereby totally dispersed and many of them cast away, wherein five of the eight brothers, sons of Milesius, lost their lives.\n\nThat part of the fleet commanded by Heber, Heremon, and Amergin (the three surviving brothers), and Heber Donn, son of Ir (one of the brothers lost in the storm), overcame all opposition, landed safe, fought and routed the three Tuatha-de Danan Kings at Slieve-Mis, and thence pursued and overtook them at Tailten, where another bloody battle was fought; wherein the three (Tuatha-de-Danan) Kings and their Queens were slain, and their army utterly routed and destroyed: so that they could never after give any opposition to the Clan-na-Milé in their new conquest; who, having thus sufficiently avenged the death of their great uncle Ithe, gained the possession of the country foretold them by Cachear, some ages past, as already mentioned.\n\nHeber and Heremon, the chief leading men remaining of the eight brothers, sons of Milesius aforesaid, divided the kingdom between them (allotting a proportion of land to their brother Amergin, who was their Arch-priest, Druid, or magician; and to their nephew Heber Donn, and to the rest of their chief commanders), and became jointly the first of one hundred and eighty-three Kings or sole Monarchs of the Gaelic, Milesian, or Scottish Race, that ruled and governed Ireland, successively, for two thousand eight hundred and eighty-five years from the first year of their reign, Anno Mundi three thousand five hundred, to their submission to the Crown of England in the person of King Henry the Second; who, being also of the Milesian Race by Maude, his mother, was lineally descended from Fergus Mor MacEarca, first King of Scotland, who was descended from the said Heremon--so that the succession may be truly said to continue in the Milesian Blood from before Christ one thousand six hundred and ninety-nine years down to the present time.\n\nHeber and Heremon reigned jointly one year only, when, upon a difference between their ambitious wives, they quarreled and fought a battle at Ardcath or Geshill (Geashill, near Tullamore in the King's County), where Heber was slain by Heremon; and, soon after, Amergin, who claimed an equal share in the government, was, in another battle fought between them, likewise slain by Heremon. Thus, Heremon became sole Monarch, and made a new division of the land amongst his comrades and friends, viz.: the south part, now called Munster, he gave to his brother Heber's four sons, Er, Orba, Feron, and Fergna; the north part, now Ulster, he gave to Ir's only son Heber Donn; the east part or Coigeadh Galian, now called Leinster, he gave to Criomthann-sciath-bheil, one of his commanders; and the west part, now called Connaught, Heremon gave to Un-Mac-Oigge, another of his commanders; allotting a part of Munster to Lughaidh (the son of Ithe, the first Milesian discoverer of Ireland), amongst his brother Heber's sons.\n\nFrom these three brothers, Heber, Ir, and Heremon (Amergin dying without issue), are descended all the Milesian Irish of Ireland and Scotland, viz.: from Heber, the eldest brother, the provincial Kings of Munster (of whom thirty-eight were sole Monarchs of Ireland), and most of the nobility and gentry of Munster, and many noble families in Scotland, are descended. From Ir, the second brother, all the provincial Kings of Ulster (of whom twenty-six were sole Monarchs of Ireland), and all the ancient nobility and gentry of Ulster, and many noble families in Leinster, Munster, and Connaught, derive their pedigrees; and, in Scotland, the Clan-na-Rory--the descendants of an eminent man, named Ruadhri or Roderick, who was Monarch of Ireland for seventy years (viz., from Before Christ 288 to 218).\n\nFrom Heremon, the youngest of the three brothers, were descended one hundred and fourteen sole Monarchs of Ireland: the provincial Kings and Hermonian nobility and gentry of Leinster, Connaught, Meath, Orgiall, Tirowen, Tirconnell, and Clan-na-boy; the Kings of Dalriada; all the Kings of Scotland from Fergus. Mor MacEarca down to the Stuarts; and the Kings and Queens of England from Henry the Second down to the present time.\n\nThe issue of Ithe is not accounted among the Milesian Irish or Clan-na-Milé, as not being descended from Milesius, but from his uncle Ithe; of whose posterity there were also some Monarchs of Ireland (see Roll of the Irish Monarchs, infra), and many provincial or half provincial Kings of Munster: that country upon its first division being allocated to the sons of Heber and to Lughaidh, son of Ithe, whose posterity continued there accordingly.\n\nThis invasion, conquest, or plantation of Ireland by the Milesian or Scottish Nation took place in the Year of the World three thousand five hundred, or the next year after Solomon began the foundation of the Temple of Jerusalem, and one thousand six hundred and ninety-nine years before the Nativity of our Savior Jesus Christ; which, according to the Irish computation of Time, occurred Anno Mundi five thousand one hundred and ninety-nine: therein agreeing with the Septuagint, Roman Martyrologies, Eusebius, Orosius, and other ancient authors; which computation the ancient Irish chroniclers exactly observed in their Books of the Reigns of the Monarchs of Ireland, and other Antiquities of that Kingdom; out of which the Roll of the Monarchs of Ireland, from the beginning of the Milesian Monarchy to their submission to King Henry the Second of England, a Prince of their own Blood, is exactly collected.\n\n[As the Milesian invasion of Ireland took place the next year after the laying of the foundation of the Temple of Jerusalem by Solomon, King of Israel, we may infer that Solomon was contemporary with Milesius of Spain; and that the Pharaoh King of Egypt, who (1 Kings iii. 1,) gave his daughter in marriage to Solomon, was the Pharaoh who conferred on Milesius of Spain the hand of another daughter Scotia.]\n\nMilesius of Spain bore three Lions in his shield and standard, for the following reasons; namely, that, in his travels in his younger clays into foreign countries, passing through Africa, he, by his cunning and valor, killed in one morning three Lions; and that, in memory of so noble and valiant an exploit, he always after bore three Lions on his shield, which his two surviving sons Heber and Heremon, and his grandson Heber Donn, son of Ir, after their conquest of Ireland, divided amongst them, as well as they did the country: each of them bearing a Lion in his shield and banner, but of different colors; which the Chiefs of their posterity continue to this day: some with additions and differences; others plain and entire as they had it from their ancestors.\n\n37. Ir: his son. This Prince was one of the chief leaders of the expedition undertaken for the conquest of Erinn, but was doomed never to set foot on the \"Sacred Isle;\" a violent storm scattered the fleet as it was coasting round the island in search of a landing place, the vessel commanded by him was separated from the rest of the fleet and driven upon the island since called Scellig-Mhicheal, off the Kerry coast, where it split on a rock and sank with all on board, B.C. 1700.\n\n38. Heber Donn: his son; born in Spain; was granted by Heber and Heremon the possession of the northern part of Ireland, now called Ulster.\n\n39. Hebric: his son; was killed in a domestic quarrel.\n\n40. Artra: his youngest son; succeeded in the government of Uladh or Ulster; his elder brothers, Cearmna and Sobhrach, put forth their claims to sovereign authority, gave battle to the Monarch Eochaidh, whom they slew and then mounted his throne; they were at length slain: Sobhrach at Dun Sobhrach, or \"Dunseverick,\" in the county of Antrim, by Eochaidh Meann; and Cearmna (in a sanguinary battle fought near Dun Cearmna, now called the Old Head at Kinsale, in the county of Cork, where he had his residence), by his successor Eochaidh Faobhar-glas, grandson of Heber Fionn, B.C. 1492.\n\n41. Artrach: son of Artra.\n\n42. Sedna: his son; slew Rotheacta, son of Maoin, of the race of Heremon, Monarch of Ireland, and, mounting his throne, became the 23rd Monarch. It was during his reign that the Dubhloingeas or \"pirates of the black fleet\" came to plunder the royal palace of Cruachan in Roscommon, and the King was slain, in an encounter with those plunderers, by his own son and successor, who mistook his father for a pirate chief whom he had slain and whose helmet he wore.\n\n43. Fiacha Fionn Scothach, the 24th Monarch: son of Sedna; so called from the abundance of white flowers with which every plain in Erinn abounded during his reign; was born in the palace of Rath-Cruachan, B.C. 1402; and slain, B.C. 1332, in the 20th year of his reign, by Munmoin, of the Line of Heber.\n\n44. Eochaidh (2): his son; better known as Ollamh Fodhla, i.e., \"Ollamh, or chief poet of Fodhla\" (or Ireland); began his reign, A.M. 3882, B.C. 1317 (according to the received computation of the Sep-tuagint, making A.D. 1 agree with A.M. 5199). This Eochaidh was the 27th Monarch of Ireland, and reigned 40 years. It was this Monarch who first instituted the Feis Teamhrach (or \"Parliament of Tara\"), which met about the time called \"Samhuin\" (or 1st of November) for making laws, reforming general abuses, revising antiquities, genealogies, and chronicles, and purging them from all corruption and falsehood that might have been foisted into them since the last meeting. This Triennial Convention was the first Parliament of which we have any record on the face of the globe; and was strictly observed from its first institution to A.D. 1172; and, even as late as A.D. 1258, we read in our native Annals of an Irish Parliament, at or near Newry. (See \"O'Neill\" Stem, No. 113.) It was this Monarch who built Mur Ollamhan at Teamhair (which means \"Ollamh's fort at Tara\"); he also appointed a chieftain over every cantred and a brughaidh over every townland.\n\nAccording to some chroniclers, \"Ulster\" was first called Uladh, from Ollamh Fodhla. His posterity maintained themselves in the Monarchy of Ireland for 250 years, without any of the two other septs of Heber and Heremon intercepting them. He died at an advanced age, A.M. 3922, at his own Mur (or house) at Tara, leaving five sons, viz.: 1. Slanoll; 2. Finachta Fionnsneachta (or Elim); 3. Gead Ollghothach, and 4. Fiacha, who were successively Monarchs of Ireland; and 5. Cairbre.\n\n45. Cairbre: son of Ollamh Fodhla; King of Uladh; d. in the 22nd year of the reign of his brother Fiacha.\n\n46. Labhradh: his son; governed Ulster during the long reign of his cousin Oiliol, son of Slanoll.\n\n47. Bratha: his son; was slain by Breasrigh, a prince of the Heberian race, in the 12th year of the reign of Nuadhas Fionn-Fail.\n\n48. Fionn: his son; fought against the Monarch Eochaidh Apach at Tara, defeated him, and became the 42nd Monarch; but after a reign of 22 years was slain by Seidnae Innaraidh, his successor.\n\n49. Siorlamh: his son; so called from the extraordinary length of his hands (Lat. \"longimanus,\" or long-handed); slew the Monarch Lugbaidh Iardhonn, and assumed the sovereignty of the kingdom, which he held for 16 years, at the expiration of which, in B.C. 855, he was slain by Eochaidh Uarceas, son of the former King.\n\n50. Argeadmar (or Argethamar): his son; ascended the Throne of Ireland, B.C. 777, and was the 58th Monarch; after a reign of 30 years, was slain by Duach Ladhrach. He left four sons: 1. Fiontan, whose son, Ciombaoth, was the 63rd Monarch; 2. Diomain, whose son, Dithorba, became the 62nd Monarch; 3. Badhum, who was father of Aodh Ruadh, the 61st Monarch, who was drowned at Eas Ruadh (or Assaroe), now Ballyshannon, in the county of Donegal, and grandfather of Macha Mongruadh, or \"Macha of the Golden Tresses,\" the 64th Monarch, and the only queen Ireland ever has had, who laid the foundation of the Royal Palace of Emania, in the county of Armagh, where her consort Cimbath, died of the plague; the fourth son of Argeadmar was Fomhar.\n\n51. Fomhar: son of Argeadmar; died during the reign of Cimbath.\n\n52. Dubh: his son; was King of Ulster.\n\n53. Eos: his son.\n\n54. Srubh: his son.\n\n55. Indereach: his son.\n\n56. Glas: his son.\n\n57. Carbre (or Cathair): his son.\n\n58. Feabhardhile: his son.\n\n59. Fomhar (2): his son.\n\n60. Dubh (2): his son.\n\n61. Sithrich: his son.\n\n62. Ruadhri (or Rory) Mór: his son; was the 86th Monarch; died B.C. 218. From him the \"Clan-na-Rory\" were so called. He left, amongst other children 1. Bresal Bodhiobha, and 2. Congall Clareineach, who were respectively the 88th and the 90th Monarchs; 3. Conragh, the father of the 105th Monarch Eiliomh; 4. Fachna Fathach, the 92nd Monarch, who, by his wife Neasa was father of Conor; 5. Ros Ruadh, who by his wife Roigh, the father of the celebrated Fergus Mór; and 6. Cionga, the ancestor of the heroic Conal Cearnach,from whom are descended O'Moore, MacGuinness, M'Gowan, and several other powerful families in Ulster and Conacht.\n\n63. Ros Ruadh: son of Rory Mór; m. Roigh, dau. of an Ulster Prince – Brother to 63. Cionga: son of Rory Mór. ( Cionog (or Cionga), brother of Ros who is No. 63 on the \"Line of Ir,\" was the ancestor of MacAonghuis [oneesh]; anglicised MacGuinness, Maginnis, Magennis, Magenis, MacInnes, Guinness, Angus, Ennis, Innis, etc.)\n\n64. Capa (or Cathbharr): his son.\n\n65. Fachna Fathach: his son; the 92nd Monarch of Ireland.\n\n66.

He and his little fleet remained at sea for some time, resting and refreshing themselves on various islands. At that time Cachear their Druid, or priest, predicted that they would continue to wander until they reached the Western Island of Europe, now called Ireland. They would not reach Ireland themselves, but their descendants would after 300 years. Eventually Lamhfionn and his fleet reached Libya, at the point where Carthage was later built. Soon after, Lamhfionn died in Libya. Heber Glunfionn, son of Lamhfionn, was born and died in Libya. He was the father of Agnan Fionn. Heber Glunfionn and his posterity were kings and rulers there for over 150 years. Some sources say it was up to 300 years. Agnan Fionn was the father of Febric Glas. Febric Glas was the father of Nenuall. Nenuall was the father of Nuadhad. Nuadhad was the father of Alladh. Alladh was the father of Arcadh.\n\nArcadh was the father of Deag. Deag was the father of Brath, who was born in Libya (called Gothia or Getulia). Remembering Cachear’s prediction, Brath departed Libya with a large fleet to seek the Western Island of Europe, Ireland. After some time, Brath landed in Spain, and established a colony in Galicia in northern Spain. Breoghan (or Brigus) was a son of Deag. Breoghan's descendant was the legendary Connal Cearnach ; which eventually Conal or Connal became the founder of Clan Mordha/ O'Mordha (Moore/ O'Moore). He conquered Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal. He built Breoghan’s Tower in Galicia. He also sent a colony into Britain, and their descendants gave formidable opposition to the Romans as they invaded Britain.\n\nBile was a son of Breoghan, and he became king of all the countries his father had conquered. Bile had a brother named Ithe, of whom more will be said later. The Great Warrior of Milesius was a son of Breoghan. In his youth, Milesius traveled to Scythia. The King of Scythia gave him the hand of his daughter in marriage and appointed him General of his army. Milesius defeated the king’s enemies and became very popular with the people, so much so that the King became jealous and resolved to kill Milesius. Milesius discovered the King’s plot and killed the King instead. Then Milesius left Scythia with a fleet of sixty ships, and upon his arrival in Egypt, Pharoah Nectonibus made him General of all his forces against the King of Ethiopia.\n\nMilesius was victorious. Milesius was a widower by this time, so in gratitude, Nectonibus gave Milesius the hand of his daughter Scotia in marriage. Milesius remained in Egypt for eight years, during which time he had his most able people instructed in the arts and sciences of Egypt, so that they might teach others when they returned to Spain.Eventually, Milesius returned to Spain. There, he found that the country had been overrun by \"foreigners\". By a series of fifty-four battles, Milesius drove the foreigners from Spain, and then settled down to rule in peace and quiet. However, a famine of twenty-six years duration fell upon Spain. The reasons for the famine were the lack of rainfall and the fact that the people had failed to use enough manure on their fields, but Milesius was superstitious and believed that his failure to seek the Western Island (Ireland) of Europe was the cause of the famine.\n\nKnowing that the 300 years predicted by Cachear the Druid was about to expire, Milesius sent his uncle Ithe and Ithe’s son Lughaidh and 150 others to bring back an account of the Western Island. When he landed in the Western Island, or Ireland, Ithe left Lughaidh and 50 men to guard the ship while Ithe and the other 100 men explored. Ithe learned that the three rulers of Ireland were at their palace at Aileach Neid. Ithe travelled overland to Aileach Neid, sending word to Lughaidh to bring the ship around with the rest of the men. When Ithe arrived at Aileach Neid, he was honorably received and entertained, and then Ithe started back to his ship to return to Spain.\n\nHowever, the three rulers suspected that Ithe would bring others from Spain to invade Ireland, so they attacked and killed Ithe before he reached the ship. This happened at Magh Ithe, or the Plain of Ithe. Lughaidh recovered his father’s body and returned it to Spain, where it was put on public display to excite the people to avenge Ithe’s death. Some sources say that Ithe was only wounded ashore, but died during the voyage back to Spain. Both in obedience to the God as signified by Cachear, and to avenge his uncle’s death, Milesius made preparations to invade Ireland. He died before the expedition got underway, leaving the invasion of Ireland to his eight sons by his two wives.\n\nThe Migration of the Milesian Tribe\n\nAround 1550 BC, the king of Scythia was Phoeniusa Farsaidh [1]*, an enlightened despot whose interest in ruling his people paled in comparison to his thirst for knowledge. His dream was to study and master all of the languages of the people in that part of the world. With this objective in mind, he surrendered his throne to his oldest son, Nenuall, and moved south to the City of Aeothena, in the Valley of Senaar. (Shinar, the plain in the Tigris and Euphrates basin.) He brought with him a younger son, Niul [2], who remained with his father in exile for twenty years. This move was the Third Adamic Migration\n\nSoon after Asruth passed away, local politics changed and the Scythians were perceived by the Pharaoh as being subversive. A series of battles and bitter conflicts ensued during which a great number of the Scythians were killed. Outnumbered and out armed, Sruth was forced to abandon Capacyront with his small band of survivors. They escaped Egypt by boat and eventually landed on the island of Crete. Sruth died soon after their arrival. This exodus of the tribe of Gaodhal (Gael) resulted in the First Gaelic Migration.\n\nHeber Scut [6]*, oldest son of Sruth, stayed on Crete for about one year where he served as king of his people. He held a council and announced his intentions of returning to Scythia. Some of his people opted to stay on Crete and it is likely that a branch of Gaodhal’s bloodline still remains there since \"the island breeds no venomous serpent ever since.\"Internecine battles continued between the two royal houses and in one engagement Heber was slain by Noemus, the former king’s son. Beouman [7]*, Ogaman [8]*, and Tait [9]*, were all, in turn, the oldest sons of the line of Heber and all served as kings of Scythia. After Tait’s death, however, Prince Agnon [10] was unable to retain the throne and he was forced to abandon Scythia and roam the Caspian Sea for several years as a dispossessed brigand. Agnon would never settle back on land again and he died at sea. His oldest son, Lamhfionn [11], became chief of this marauding band of pirates. This exile of the Gaels from Scythia was the Third Gaelic Migration.\n\nOne day, Caicher, the druid of the clan, approached his chief and shared with him a vision that he had seen. He told Lamhfionn of a distant western island that was green and fertile. It was the ‘promised land’ for their people and he predicted that they would have no peace until they arrived on its shores. After much deliberation and prayer, Lamhfionn announced that they were abandoning the pirate’s life on the Caspian Sea and they were headed west in search of Caicher’s prophesied island.\n\nThey traversed the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. At last they arrived at Gothia (or Getulia) which is now known as Libya. They settled along the Gulf of Tunis where Carthage would later be built and began subjugating the natives. Lamhfionn’s oldest son, Heber Glunfionn [12]*, was born in Gothia. After his father’s death he assumed command of the Scythians and continued winning battles over the indigenous Gothians. He was the first of his line to be crowned king of Gothia. This invasion of northern Africa by the Gaels comprised the Fourth Gaelic Migration.\n\nHe was reminded of the divine mission to bring his people to the ‘promised land’ on the mythical distant western island. The small band of Scythian nomads had grown into a strong and populous tribe while ruling over Gothia. Though Gothia had proven to be a fortuitous stop-over, it was not the final destination for the clan. A large fleet was built and the entire tribe left Africa and sailed to the coast of Spain. Brath was successful in establishing a fortified colony in Galicia, in the northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula. This transplantation of the Gaels to Spain was the Fifth Gaelic Migration.\n\nBile’s oldest son, Milesius Galamh [23]*, grew up hearing Ithe’s tales and, being the adventurous type, yearned to visit the ancestral lands of Scythia. When he was old enough to travel he assembled a small fleet and with his father’s blessings sailed off to the east. He received a warm welcome from the king of Scythia and married one of his daughters with whom he sired several sons.\n\nHis military abilities soon impressed the king and he appointed Milesius to be General of his armies. After many victories Milesius was a favorite among the Scythian people and this raised the jealousy and suspicion of the king. The king tried to have Milesius assassinated but the plan back-fired and Milesius in turn killed his father-in-law. He was forced to leave the country and with a fleet of sixty ships he sailed to Egypt.At the time of his arrival, Egypt was under attack by the Ethiopian army. Milesius’ reputation for valor, strategy, and wisdom preceded him and the Pharaoh offered him the position of General of the Egyptian defense forces.\n\nMilesius accepted and soundly routed the Ethiopians. Milesius thus won great favor in the Pharaoh’s court and married Princess Scota, one of the Pharaoh’s daughters. Between his first Scythian wife and Princess Scota, Milesius fathered eight sons.\n\nOne day, while hunting, Milesius encountered three lions all of which he slew alone. To commemorate this feat he added three lions to his personal cognizance already emblazoned with the thunderbolt and serpent of Gaodhal . For eight years Milesius remained in Egypt, being instructed in the sciences, arts, and trades of the time. At length a messenger from Spain arrived with instructions from the king to return home. Milesius bid farewell to the Pharaoh and set sail for Galicia.\n\nThe next morning Milesius was shocked to hear his uncle Ithe describe a vision that he had in which he saw the fertile shores of the western island in the distance from the heights of Breoghan’s tower. It was a sign from Go Lear, their god, to abandon Spain and to pursue their destiny. (To this day there is a belief in Galicia, Spain, that one can see Ireland from the top of an old Roman lighthouse if the weather is clear.)\n\nIthe was instructed to assemble a fleet and to leave the kingdom at once to find Caicher’s island. Ithe, with his son, Lughaidh and one hundred and fifty hearty men, then sailed north to the Kenmare River, Kerry, Ireland.\n\nThe exact date of the arrival of the Gaelic Celts in Ireland is unknown; however, all credible sources maintain that it occurred before the age of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC). The dates cited in the ancient history of the clan are estimates based on the best available evidence. The Gaelic Celts dominated Ireland from the time of their arrival until the dawning of the thirteenth century. The Milesians were master equestrians, superior metal workers, and fierce warriors, traits that were common to all of the Magi tribes.\n\nThey were also gifted military strategists. True to their Scythian roots, they were tall, muscular, fair skinned, and light haired. The Gaelic Celts were distantly related to the continental Celts that sacked Rome in 387 BC, raided Delphi in 279 BC, and established the kingdom of Galatia in Asia Minor. They called themselves \"Gaels\", the word \"Celt\" being coined by latter day scholars to describe the loose confederation of Magi tribes that emanated from Scythia to conquer the indigenous peoples of Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe Gaels originally divided Ireland into four provinces, Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connaught. Meath was not considered a province until a much later time. Although an Ard Ri, or high king, was recognized, his powers were very limited. The freedom loving Gaels forcefully resisted the establishment of a strong central government and preferred to retain most of the civil authority within their relatively small and semi-autonomous tribes.\n\nMilesius, with the general approbation of his people, sent his uncle Ith, with his son Lughaidh, and one hundred and fifty stout men to bring them an account of the western Isles; who accordingly, arriving at the island called Ireland. The leader of this small expedition force, order his men to guard the ships, and the rest to traveled about the island. The natives called Dananns welcome Ith to Ireland, but the Dananns became suspicious about Ith's motives for coming to Ireland. Thru misunderstanding of Ith's motive; the Danann's king murder Ith and two of his brothers. The rest of Ith's men escape back to the ships with Ith and his brothers bodies, and sailed back to Galicia.\n\n“ Do you ask why the beacon and banner of War. On the mountains of Ulster are seen from afar is the signal our rights to regain and secure. Through God and our Lady and Rory O'Moore.”\n\nWhen the fleet reached Galicia; they brought the fallen to their families, and the sons of Mil sought revenge for his uncle death. They embarked with their warriors and also their families to Ireland with sixty five ships. A bard named Amairgin, who was the son of Mil, led the warriors to invade Ireland against the Dananns. The Dananns decided to avoid confrontations with the Milesians force by using their magic to hide Ireland in a fog. The Danann had also cast another spell of straying on the Milesian's fleet. However Amergin used his own magic to dispel their magic. Another son of Mil, named Ebaer Donn, wanted to exterminate the entire Danann race. The Danann then send a magical storm against the Milesian's fleet, where Eber was thrown overboard and drowned in the raging sea.\n\nThe Skirmish of Tailtiu\n\nThe Skirmish of Tailtiu may have been more of a skirmish between the Milesians and Dananns. There is not a whole lot of information about this battle between the two forces. One thing we do know, is that all three kings and queens of the Danann forces were killed in this battle, and were forced to retreat. After the skirmish or battle at Tailtiu; the Milesians has finally secure a landing in Ireland. Three days later when the Milesians began to move inland; they were again met by the Danann's forces at the battle of Sliabh Mis. This battle, by research is claimed to be the very first major battle to be fought by the two tribes. This battle will ended up in a bloody battle for both sides.\n\nThe Battle of Sliabh Mis\n\nThis is an account of the following battle. Three days after the skirmish at Tailiu; the Milesians, which is now refer to as the Gaels by the Dananns were attacked. The Dananns were led by Eriu, wife of Mac Greine son of the sun, and she having a good amount of soldiers that accompany her. They fought a hard battle, and many were killed on both sides. This was the first major battle between the sons of the Gaels and the forces of Dananns for the kingship of Ireland. It was in this battle, that, Fais, wife of Un, was killed in a valley at the foot of the mountain, and it was named after her \" The valley of Fais.\" Scotia, wife of Milesius, was also killed in this battle, and she was buried in a valley on the north side of the mountain near the sea.\n\nThe sons of the Gaels had lost no more than three hundred of it's forces, while comparing to the Danann's forces; they have lost a thousands of it's men. Eriu was defeated and driven back to Tailltin, and as many of her soldiers, who can hold together. When she came to Tailltin; there she told the people on how she was defeated in battle against the Gaels, and lost her best men in pitch battle. The Gaels has stopped their advance after the battle was won; collected their dead from the battlefield and gave them a proper burial to honor their fallen. They gave a great burial to two of their Druids, Aer and Eithis; that were killed in the battle.\n\nAfter the Gaels have rested for awhile, they went on to Inver Colpa in the county of Leinster, and Heremon and his men joined them. Then the Gaels send a messenger to the three kings of Ireland of the tribe of Danann. The three king's sons were Cermait, Honey and Mouth and bade them to come out and fight a final battle to determine the ownership of Ireland once and for all. This upcoming battle will decide the fate of Ireland on who will have complete control and kingship over Ireland. This will be the last and final bloody battle between these two tribes for kingship of Ireland.\n\nThe Battle of Tailltin\n\nSo, the Danann's forces came out to meet the Gaels, and fight a finally pitch battle for Ireland. The best fighters on both sides has gather on the field of Tailltin, and they began to attack one another. The sons of the Gaels remembered the death of Ith, and there was a great anger towards the Dananns, and they furiously attacked the Danann's lines to avenge Ith, and there was a fierce battle fought. For a while, neither side got the advantage of the other, but at last the Gaels have finally broken thru the lines of the Danann's army and routed their army from the fields with such a great slaughter, and drove them from the battlefield. Their kings were killed in the rout, and also the three queens of Ireland, which their names of the queens were Eriu, Fodhla and Banba.\n\nWhen the Danann saw their leaders were dead; they began to fall back in great disorder, and the sons of Gaels followed after them. Following the Danann's force; the Gaels have lost two of their best leaders named Cuailgne, son of Breagan at Slieve Cuailgne, and Fuad, his brother, at Slieve Fuad. They were in no way daunted by the lost of their two leaders, but they continue to pursue the fleeing Danann's force, so hotly that they were never able to bring their army together again, but had to admit to themselves that they were defeated by the Gaels. The Dananns had no choice, but to hand over Ireland to the Gaels. The leaders, and the sons of Mileius had divided up the provinces of Ireland between them. The first son, Heber took the provinces of Munster, and he share Amergin with his other brother. The second son, Heremon got Leinster and Connacht for his share, and the third son, Eimhir, son of Ir, son of Miled and some of their chief men of the county of Ulster.\n\nIt was one of the sons of Eimhir, that were called the children of Rudraighe, and that he lived in Emain Macha for nine hundred years, and some of the best men of Ireland came from there, which includes the following: 1. Fergus, son of Rogh 2. Conall Cearnach of the Red Branch of Ulster Now, the O' Mordha/ O' Mores were descendants of Conall Cearnach. From the son of Ith, the first Gael to get his death in Ireland. There came in was Fathadh Canaan that got the sway over the whole world from the rising and to the setting sun, and that took hostages of the streams, the birds, and the language.\n\nIt is what the poets of Ireland used to be saying \" That every brave man, good at fighting, and every man that could do great deeds and not be making much talking about them, was of the sons of the Gaels, and that every skilled man that had music and that did enchantments secertly, was of the Tuatha de Danann. But they put a bad name on the Firbolgs and the men of Domnand and the Gaileoin, for lies and for big talk and injustice. But for all that, they were good fighters among them, and Ferdiad, that made so good a stand against Cuchulain in the war of the Bull of Cuailgne, was one of them. The Gaileoin fought well in the same war; but the men of Ireland had no great liking for them, and their Druids drove them out of the country afterward.\n\nThe Birth of Clan O'Mordha\n\nIt all begins with the legendary hero and found of Clan O'Mordha of Ireland. His name is Conall Cernach in which his descendants of Clan Muir. From the time of the Milesians, to the Red Branch of Ulster, to the formation of Clan O'Mordha/ O'More, and all the way to modern day Ireland. The Clan O'Mordha fought in many of Ireland's war, feuds, and against invaders. The bravery, curageous and heroism of clan O'Mordha has play an important role in Ireland history and even stories of tragedy. This is their story of the bitter fighting for freedom between the Native tribes, Clan feuds, The English army, and over sea fighting in Irish battalions and regiments. The Blood and sacrifice that the O'Mores had shed to bring freedom, and defending the clan in Ireland's turbulence history.\n\nThe Legendary Founder\n\nConall is descendants from the Milesians tribe and also of royal blood of the Galician Kings and queens of Galicia, Spain. Conall Cernach is the founder of Clan O'Mordha/ O'Mores, and was part of the most elite knights of the Red Branch. His journey from Ulster, Ireland all the way into Jerusalem. Conall is also known as Conall the Victorious. He became a legendary figure during his services in the Red Branch of Ulster. He has served the Kings of Ulster with much bravery and courage against the king's enemies. The Red branch Knights had a passion for building great forts in Ulster to defend the county from invaders. The red branch of Ulster is consider to be a band of elite warriors to defend Ulster from it's enemies.\n\nThis is his story of courage, bravery and loyalty. His father was Amairgin mac Echit and his mother was Findchoem. His parents' marriage was barren, until Findchoem visited a druid and was advised to drink from a certain well. She took a drink from the well, swallowing a worm with it, and became pregnant. Findchoem's brother Cet mac Magach a Connachtman, protected his sister until she gave birth to a son, Conall. Druids came to initiate the child into their religion, and prophesied that he would kill more than half of the men of Connacht, and that he would always have a Connachtman's head on his belt. Cet took the child, put him under his heel and tried to break his neck, but only damaged it, leaving Conall with a crooked neck.\n\nBattle of Howth\n\nConall Cernach fought at the Battle of Howth. He fought Mes Gedra, king of Leinster, in single combat following a battle provoked by the Ulster poet Athirne. Mes Gedra had lost a hand in an earlier fight, so Conall fought him with one hand tucked into his belt. He won, taking his opponent's head as a trophy. When he put Mes Gedra's head on his shoulder, it straightened his neck. Conall's charioteer couldn't carry the head, so he cut out the brain and preserved it by mixing it with lime. The calcified brain was later stolen by Cet and used to kill Conchobar mac Nessa.\n\nBattle of Da Derga's Hostel\n\nConall was also a supporter the King named Conaire Mór (Conaire Mor) was the greatest high king during the period. He was one of the warriors defending Conaire Mor, during the Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel. Ingcel and his bandits arrived at the hostel, and they were determined to attack the hostel. He went and spied on those inside the hostel. When Ingcel returned, Conaire's foster-brothers realised that their king was there. The story went into great details, with the foster-brother identified each of the champion in Conaire's retinue, including , Conall of the Victorious son Cromar, and Mac Cecht, the son of Snade Teched. Ingcel ordered his men to attack the hostel. They were repulsed with heavy causalities from Conaire and his followers. Ingcel ordered to burn the hostel to the ground. The warriors inside, put out the fire with all water and wine that can be found in the hostel. After hours of fighting, only less than handful of warriors were left inside the hostel.\n\nConaire Mór, dying with thirst, ordered Mac Cécht to procure him with drink. Mac Cécht was reluctant to leave his king, but managed to break free from Ingcel's bandits. Outside, Mac Cécht went in search for water, but the Dananns hid all the water sources from the hero, with magic. Lakes and rivers seemed to dry up when Mac Cécht appeared. After hours of searching, Mac Cecht managed to fill the cup with water, and began his trek back to the hostel.\n\nBy the time Mac Cécht returned, the other champions were either dead or had fled. Mac Cécht saw two men severed his king's head. Mac Cécht attacked the two men beheading his enemies with his sword. Taking up Conaire's head, Mac Cécht poured water into mouth. Conaire Mór spoke, praising Mac Cécht for his duties to his king, of fetching water for the king. Conall was forced to withdraw from the fighting, when he was severely wounded, leaving his dying king.\n\nMac Da Thó's Pig\n\nCet is exulting in his victory over the full warrior contingent of Ulster present, the Ulster hero Conall enters the hostel, and leaps into the middle of the hall to roars of welcome from the Ulaid. Cet and Conall acknowledge each other in an exchange of archaic rhetorical verses, and Cet concedes that Conall is a better warrior than he. Cet adds that his brother Anlúan would best Conall in a contest: \"'It is our misfortune that he is not in the house.' 'Oh but he is,' said Conall, and taking Anlúan's head from his wallet he threw it at Cet's breast so that a mouthful of blood spattered over the lips.\" Conall would have a fierce rivalry with Cet for the rest of his life.\n\nHe shamed Cet at a feast at the house of Mac Dá Thó, a hospitaller of Leinster, when the warriors of Connacht and Ulster competed for the champion's portion by boasting of their deeds. Cet reminded all comers how he had bested them in combat, including emasculating Celtchar with his spear. However, just as Cet was about to carve, Conall arrived, and his boasts topped even Cet's. Cet admitted defeat, but claimed that if his brother Anlúan were present, his feats would top even Conall's. Conall responded by tossing him Anlúan's freshly severed head.\n\nThe Bricriu's Feast\n\nHe also competed for the champion's portion at a feast held by the troublemaker Bricriu, albeit with less success. Bricriu went in turn to Conall, Loegaire Budadach and , and promised each of them the champion's portion. When the feast started each of the three warriors' charioteers stood up and claimed the champion's portion for his master. A fight broke out between Conall, Láegare and Cúchulainn, until King Conchobar, Fergus, and Sencha, intervened to separate them. Meanwhile, Bricriu went to each of the three heroes' wives - Conall's wife Lendabair, Lóegaire's wife Fedelm, and Cúchulainn's wife Emer - and promised them precedence at the feast, and when the women approached, Conall, Lóegaire and Cúchulainn were almost set to violence again.\n\nEmer was the first to enter, as Cúchulainn lifted the side of the house up to let her in, tipping Bricriu into a ditch. The Ulstermen asked first Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, then Rio Cu , king of Munster, to adjudicate the dispute. In every test set, Cúchulainn came out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire would accept the result.\n\nFinally, a hideous, giant churl, carrying a huge axe, appeared at Emain Macha . He challenged each of the three heroes to cut off his head, and then allow him to return the next day to cut off the hero's head. Lóegaire accepted the challenge and cut off the churl's head, and the churl picked up his head and left. He returned the next day, but Lóegaire was nowhere to be seen. Conall was the next to take up the challenge, but he too did not fulfil his side of the bargain. Finally Cúchulainn cut off the churl's head, and submitted himself to the churl's axe the following day as promised. The churl spared him, revealed himself as Cú Roí, and declared that Cúchulainn should have the champion's portion undisputed at any feast held by the Ulstermen.\n\nThe death of Cúchulainn\n\nConall and Cúchulainn had sworn to each other that whoever was killed first, the other would avenge him before nightfall. When Lugaid mac Con Roi and Erc mac Cairpri killed Cúchulainn, Conall pursued them. Lugaid had also lost a hand, and Conall again fought one-handed, but this time he only won after his horse took a bite out of Lugaid's side. He took both their heads, and when he took Erc's head back to Tara his sister, Achall, died of grief.\n\nFinal Showdown with Cet\n\nConall pursued Cet after he had made a raid on Ulster, killing twenty-seven men and taking their heads. It had snowed, so he was able to follow his trail. He caught up with him, but was reluctant to face him until his charioteer chided him for cowardice. They met at a ford, and Conall killed Cet in a ferocious combat that left Conall near to death himself. He was found by Belchu of Breifne , a Connachtman, who took him home, tended to his wounds, and planned to fight him when he was fit. But Bélchú soon regretted his honourable behaviour and asked his three sons to kill Conall as he lay in his sickbed. Conall overheard and forced Bélchú to take his place in the bed, and when his sons arrived they killed him instead. Conall then killed the three of them and took all four heads home.\n\nFráech's Cattle Raid\n\nHe told of how his friend Cúchulainn had made him a copy of his own Gáe Bolg, the magical\n\nspear of death, made by the warrior princess Scáthach from the bones of great Coinchenn the sea monster. He told of how he and Fráech has followed the pirates to Scotland where Fráech’s family had been sold to slavers from the south. Down through Britain and into Gaul they raced, eventually finding the family sold to a rich merchant that lived on the southern slopes of the Alps. Great were the cheers in the hall when he recounted how Fráech slew 100 guards and he 200, their battle hardened skills with sword, spear and shield were no match for the men the merchant had hired.\n\nTo allow Fráech and his family to escape, Conall had taken a stand in a narrow ravine leading north into the mountains. Conall stood alone and met all challenges with sword and spear. Eventually a Roman general was summoned and asked Conall for a parley. The Roman general amazed by the prowess of this tall red haired warrior from the north offered him terms. Where he to give the Roman army 5 years of his time and expertise no action would be taken against him, Fráech or his family who would be allowed free passage back to Ireland. Conall a man known for his foresight and wisdom accepted the offer and was duly enrolled in the General’s army as a foot soldier and took the name Longinus.\n\nRoman Army Stationed in Jerusalem\n\nAs time passed Conall’s skill at arms meant he soon was promoted and in a remarkably short time was made a centurion and was sent by order of Emperor Tiberius into the cities of the east to put down revolt and sedition. Which is how Conall found himself arriving in Jerusalem, the city of the Jews, on a hot and sultry Friday. It was shortly before noon when they reached Jerusalem, the city of the Jews. It was a strange day, the sun hung a ball of raw fire in the heavens. Like all the cities he had seen the air was filled with the noise of shouting men, wailing of women and screaming children, as always it hurt the ears of chieftain of Dunservick and he was ill at ease when he reported to his cohort commander. “No time for rest” the commander told him, “Take your men up the hill to the east to a place these local heathens call Golgotha. We use it for executions, it is easy to find, just follow the crowds and your nose.\n\nThe Prefect Pilate is playing politics with the Jewish Sanhedrin, tomorrow is one of their 100’s of holy days and these criminals MUST be executed band off their crosses before sundown of there will be hell to pay. So off you go and break their legs, that will speed up the dying and then we can all relax. Oh .. one of the men is a special Jew … some business with calling himself King of the Jews, he has followers … they may cause problems, make sure they do not!” Conall nodded and left. This was not a duty he liked . He was a warrior of the Red Branch, duty bound to be honorable and fair in all things and the way the Romans dealt with problems was not to his taste.\n\nWhen there was a dispute or a crime it was best solved by single combat, winner takes all that was the Red Branch Way. The torturous deaths these Romans had thought up had no honor and it sickened the Irish warrior’s heart when he rode down avenues lined with small forests of crosses hung with the corpses of offenders. Up past the bare brown synagogues and closely packed houses Conall and his troops marched following the hurrying crowds. Here and there groups of women talked in whispers, pausing at sight of the Romans and the tall red haired chieftain of Ulster.\n\nConall Cearnach wore his wide-spreading scarlet cloak, fastened with a large brooch of Irish gold in the shape of a deer across his breast, and his red hair fell down in many plaits to his broad shoulders, each plait being tied at the end by a red string and tiny ball of gold. His short trimmed beard was red as his hair, his cheeks were like an apple when the sun had kissed it, and his blue bright eyes, keen-glancing, drew the eyes of all to look at him. On the way up the hill Conall noted the splashes of bright red blood and the score marks made by the heavy crosses as they were pulled by those being executed. This was the final straw and into the soul of Conall a hot anger came a-rushing as he broke away from his troops and sped like a blast of wind towards the place where the people were thickest. One thought filled his mind, “I will not let this happen. If this special man needs a champion then his champion I will be! It was not to be, pushing his way through the crowd it was a bleeding and dying man that hung on the center cross below a sign that read “Jesus Of Nazareth, King of the Jews”.\n\nAnother two men hung on similar crosses, one on the left the other on the right. The chieftain of Dunservick’s eyes clouded in anger at the sight. As Conall drew close to the center cross the man’s dry and bloodied lips opened and in a hoarse whisper he said “I am thirsty. Conall took a sponge from his pack and dipped it in a jar of rough sour wine mixed with numbing herb wormwood, placed it on the butt end of his spear and held it to the man’s lips. The man weakly sucked it for a minute and looking down directly into the eyes of Conall he whispered “It is finished” and he died. It was as if in that last flash of life something had passed between the two men. Something strange yet wonderful had filled Conall’s heart.\n\nConall’s soldiers arrived and used a hammer to break the legs of the man crucified on the left. The man screamed once and died. The soldiers moved to Conall and looked at him for permission to carry out their orders. “Hold” said Conall, “He is gone” and to prove it he took his spear, the very one given him by Cúchulainn and thrust it deep into the man’s side, blood flowed weakly but did not pulse as it would with a beating heart, the man was indeed dead. The soldiers moved to the third man and dispatched him with the hammer as they had the first. The skies darkened with boiling clouds until the sun itself disappeared and it was as if night had fallen. The sky was rent with a furious chachophny of thunder, the ground shook as if a giant stamped his feet and all around Golgotha long dead corpses rose from their graves and walked amongst the living. Conall took the arm of a woman weeping near the foot of the cross.\n\nIt was the man’s mother, he told her sadly and slowly “It was wrong your son died this cruel and untimely death. I share your grief little mother and were my brothers of the Red Branch not so far away, there would be a reckoning both fierce and swift.” The woman’s eyes met Conall’s and he knew in his heart that revenge was not proper here and his anger had no place in the grief of this mother. He knelt beside her and said “I know little of your religion and I did not know your son or if his crimes deserved this punishment but it seems to me in my heart, he was the true son of God” He helped her to her feet and onto the arm of one of her friends silently weeping behind her.\n\nConall felt a sharp tug on his cloak, behind him stood a well dressed man, “Centurion” he asked “although I can see by your looks you are not Roman can I ask you a favor citizen to citizen?”. Conall nodded and the man continued “I am Joseph from Arimathea a Jew like this man Jesus, I have asked Pilate if I may take his body to my tomb not far from here and bury him before the day is done and he has agreed … but I cannot do this by myself and I fear that we may be delayed by his enemies” The red haired warrior considered this and without a word set to assisting Joseph in moving the body to a tomb in a cave some half a mile away. Once the body of the man had been laid in the tomb the women cleaned and dressed the body as was set in their customs. When they finished the body was left alone in the tomb.\n\nA large stone had been cut for the purpose of sealing the tomb but was so large that no normal man could move it. Conall took the butt of his spear and jammed it under the stone and flexing his broad shoulders he levered the stone inch by inch until it sealed the tomb tight. As the stone fell into place the unbreakable shaft of the spear made by Cúchulainn shattered into two pieces. Joseph was a rich man and he offered to have the spear head re-shafted, but Conall refused saying “This spear has done all it’s work and I swear on my honor it will never be used in anger again. I will keep the head as it is now stained with this innocent blood as a remembrance of the evil done this day”.\n\nJoseph in return passed him scrolls on which he had written the story of Jesus from his birth to the last supper he had with his 12 friends. With that Conall returned to the barracks resigned his commission and started his long journey home. As Conall finished his tale, silence fell in the great hall for they all could see in the eyes of their chieftain the pain he carried in his heart from being even a minor a part of this evil deed. This was a pain that he would carry for the rest of his days. All eyes were downcast as the chieftain reached into his bag and took the broken spear head. He wrapped it in the fine linen napkin from the table and strode from the hall into the storm and out through the great castle gates and up onto the cliff path. He returned the following morning empty handed.\n\nNo one followed him and he never spoke of where he hid the spear that pierced the side of Jesus. That secret he took to his grave. In pagan Ireland news of strange Gods from far off countries were soon forgotten by all but Conall himself. He tried his best to follow the teachings of the rabbi from far away Nazareth written on the scrolls. And so it was nearly 400 years later after Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland and the new religion slowly replaced the old that the story of the hidden spear surfaced again when Saint Gobhain was lead by a mysterious holy flame to build his church on the edge of a cliff above a cave half way between Dunseverick castle and White Park Bay a church that still stands to this day.\n\nConall, the founder of clan O'Mordha and eventually Muir. He has became a great legendary hero who fought for the Knights of the Red Branch with much victories and ending his career in the Roman Army, which eventually made him become Christianity after seeing Jesus dying on the cross. Something inside of Conall has change forever.\n\n“As we record our history we move into the future. We the Irish O'Mores have not a reason to hide our past for we fought the good battle.” by The Clan O'More Website\n\nThe ancient Irish family of the name descends from O'Mordha (meaning majestic). The ancestor from whence they sprung was Conal Cearnach one of the Red Branch knights of Irish history. Under various spellings of the name in Ireland, the More, O'More or O'Moore family can be traced to Ireland and Moore can be traced to English and French origins. 'Moore' is an English spelling for which the Irish O'Mores were forced to take. It can well be said that the name Moore was given to English families to confuse the Clan O'More in Ireland.\n\nThe Chieftians of Clan O'Mordha:\n\nthe Chieftians of Leix: (Note:mac means son of..)

English families with the name Moore began to settle in the province of Munster in the 12th century. Their name is said to stem from the word 'moor', meaning \"strong mountain\". The O'Mores were the leading tribe of the \"7 Septs of Leix\". They fought hard to keep Ireland free from invaders and many died. In 1609 the English transplanted the remnant of the clan to Co. Kerry, around Tarbert in hopes they would die. Still many returned to their ole grounds in Co' Leix. Keatings History says that St.Fintan is our patron saint.

Maol Mórdha’s life was spared and he was allowed to remain king of Leinster. To cow any potential challengers, Brian built fortresses, strengthened the fortifications of Cashel, took hostages, and sent Murchadh on punitive raids. Although Cashel was his capital, Brian preferred to rule from his boyhood home, Kincora. He was fortunate that his sons proved loyal and did not turn on each other—or on him. In the subjugated Norse towns, trade with Europe flourished in slaves, wine, walrus tusks, spices, furs, and silks. From Brian’s vassal kingdoms, a ceaseless tribute of cows, hogs, cloaks, iron, and wine flowed into Munster.\n\nDecades of raids by Vikings, by Irish lords, and even by Irish abbots had caused much damage to the land. Brian used his growing wealth to improve roads, build bridges, restore old churches and monasteries, and build new ones alongside schools. For nearly a decade, minor feuds aside, Ireland enjoyed untypical peace and a cultural renaissance. Trouble brewed when Brian became estranged from Gormfhlaith, who left Kincora to return to Dublin. Consumed by hatred for Brian, she egged on her son, Sigtrygg, and King Maol Mórdha to rise against Brian. Brian responded with a severe new tribute that sent Leinster into near-starvation and summoned Maol Mórdha to Kincora for a show of obedience. Coaxed into an argument by Murchadh, Maol Mórdha stormed out of the castle before consulting with Brian.\n\nA messenger sent after him by Brian was later found with his skull smashed in. Whether the threat was real or imagined, Maol Mórdha reformed his alliance with Sigtrygg. Maol-Seachlainn, however, stayed loyal to Brian. He even sent his army against Dublin, but suffered a crippling defeat. In 1013, Brian and Murchadh arrived to plunder Osraighe and southern Leinster before heading on to Dublin. Early in September, Sigtrygg watched as Brian and Murchadh’s army set up camp outside the city’s landward walls. This time, however, Sigtrygg wisely did not sally forth. The fortifications of the Viking strongholds were more formidable than those of the Irish forts and, when resolutely defended, were beyond Brian’s or any other Irish king’s power to overcome. After more than three months of blockade, Brian’s forces stirred with mutiny because supplies were running low and the foul winter weather was on the way.\n\nSigtrygg jeered as Brian’s humbled army broke camp, but he knew that Brian would return. In search of allies, Sigtrygg set off to the hall of Sigurd Hlodvirsson the Stout, the Norse earl of the Orkneys. In return for bringing a few hundred half-heathen, half-Christian men as reinforcements, Sigurd demanded Gormfhlaith’s hand in marriage and an Irish kingdom to rule. Gormfhlaith was pleased with her son, but counseled Sigtrygg to gather an even greater force. He found more help in the pirates of the pagan Dane, Brodar of the Isle of Man. The cunning Sigtrygg promised Brodar the same reward he had promised Sigurd. Brodar and Sigtrygg reckoned that, at the comparatively advanced age of 54, Sigurd could well die in battle. In the coming conflict, Brian depended on his loyal Munster warriors, as well as the Danish stewards of Waterford and Limerick.\n\nOnly a few reinforcements strode forth from Connacht, and none came from Ulster. Fortunately for Brian, Maol-Seachlainn promised to help, and a new ally was found in Brian’s son-in-law, King Malcolm II of Scotland, who sent a small force commanded by Domhnall, the great steward of Mar. It was also heartening to hear that southern Leinster had refused to aid Sigtrygg and Maol Mórdha. With his 5,000 warriors, Brian still held numerical superiority over Maol Mórdha and Sigtrygg, who barely commanded more than 3,000 Vikings and Irishmen between them. Nevertheless, Brian had to act quickly to wipe out Dublin’s and Leinster’s newfound independence before the neutral Irish kings could turn against him.\n\nBrian’s youngest son, Donnach, took a few hundred men to keep an eye on southern Leinster. Brian set up his own camp north of Dublin on a hillock in the Wood of Tomar. From there he could see the city to the south, its harbor thick with Norse longboats, and between Brian’s camp and the city, the sprawling tents and campfires of his enemies. Maol Mórdha, Sigurd, Brodar, and Dubhgall, Sigtrygg’s brother, had set up their camps near the little fishing weir of Clontarf. Sigtrygg remained in Dublin with a reserve force. On Thursday, April 22, 1014, Brian sat down to take council with his lords. Tempers flared, and as a result Maol-Seachlainn withdrew his forces to Meath. The hot-headed Murchad might well have been to blame. Brian now no longer held the numerical advantage. He immediately sent word for Donnach to hurry back, but there was little chance his son would arrive in time.\n\nBrian’s hair was now silver, and he was73 years old. Too old to personally lead his warriors in battle, Brian would have to depend on Murchadh, who was unquestionably brave but also reckless. That night, Brian’s mind was haunted by worries. According to legend, a banshee visited Brian and warned him that he would fall in battle, and that “this plain shall be red tomorrow with your proud blood.” On the Viking side, Brodar, who was widely believed to be a sorcerer, prophesied that should they fight on Good Friday, Brian would die, but his army would be victorious. Whatever the truth behind such tales, Maol Mórdha, Sigtrygg, Sigurd, and Brodar all knew that they had to strike before Donnach returned. Brian had lost none of his regal bearing as he reviewed his army at dawn of Good Friday.\n\nHe looked to his brave Dalcassians, who Murchadh would use to spearhead the attack. Ready to fight beside Murchadh was his 15-year-old son, the crown prince Tordhelbach, and Murchadh’s brothers, Conchobhar and Flann. Behind them fluttered the banner of Brian’s nephew, Conaing, king of Desmond. Also present that day were the Eoganacht lords Cian and Domhnall, Domhnall, the great steward of Mar, King Tadhg of Connacht, and an array of lesser kings and princes. On his wings, Brian stationed his 10 Danish stewards and their troops Brian’s army followed Murchadh’s blue banner to meet the oncoming Dublin-Leinster coalition at Clontarf. The latter advanced with Sigurd and Brodar’s Vikings in the lead, followed by the Danes from Dublin and, behind them, Maol Mórdha and his Leinster men. Murchadh recklessly initiated the attack by bolting ahead of the main army.\n\nAlarmed, Brian called for him to fall back into line. Murchadh replied that he would not retreat one step backward. Inspired by Murchadh’s valor, the rest of Brian’s army surged forward. Meanwhile, Brian knelt down before his pavilion to pray for victory. Below him the two armies collided in a deafening crescendo of clashing arms and battle cries. From behind their large round shields, protected by leather and ring-mail byrnies, the Danes slashed and thrust their axes, spears, and swords. Their Irish foes lacked armor but not spirit, and fought back with unbridled fury. There were few lulls in the fighting. Engulfed in a semicircle, the Dublin and Leinster men slowly gave way to Brian’s battle-crazed Irish and Danish troops. Although their army fled around them, Sigurd and his guard stood like an unbroken bastion, the legend-shrouded Raven banner of the Orkneys fluttering at Sigurd’s side.\n\nOne Viking warrior after another took up the banner, only to be cut down again by Murchadh’s relentless assault. The last hands to grasp the fateful Raven banner were those of its lord. Sigurd wrapped the banner around himself before he was decapitated by Murchadh with two powerful blows to the neck. Scarcely had Murchadh caught his breath from slaying Sigurd than there appeared the fierce Norse champion, Amrud, who had carved a bloody path through the Dalcassians. Murchadh grappled Amrud to the ground and tore away his sword. Murchadh leaned the pommel of the sword against his own breast and drove it three times into Amrud, piercing the earth beneath him. Gurgling blood, Amrud plunged his own blade into Murchadh, killing him simultaneously. Panicked Norsemen and Leinstermen threw themselves into the ocean, hoping to reach their longboats. Heedless of their own safety and hungry for blood, their pursuers followed them into the waves.\n\nThe high tide carried both to their doom. His hands locked upon the hair of a Dane, Murchadh’s son Tordhelbach was washed upon the Weir of Clontarf. A stake shot through his body, and he drowned. The number of men killed on both sides was great. Conchobhar and Flann, King Tadhag of Connacht and Domhnall of the Eoganacht were among the 30 Irish chiefs and kings who died that day. Except for Sigtrygg and Brodar, all the Norse-Leinster leaders were slain among their annihilated army. Maol Mórdha and Conaing, king of Desmond, fell by each other’s hand.\n\nFrom Dublin’s ramparts, the Danish women anxiously watched the battle. Brian’s proud daughter stood there too, and at sight of the Norsemen rout she mocked her husband Sigtrygg. “It appears that the foreigners have gained their their natural inheritance—the sea,” she scoffed. In anger, Sigtrygg hit her in the face, knocking out one of her teeth. Sigtrygg rode forth too late to rally his men and was lucky to flee back into Dublin alive.\n\nThe Norman Invasion\n\nIn 1152, we learn that Diarmuid Mac Morrough, Diarmuid na Ngall, brought Devorgille, wife of O’Rourke of Breifne, to his castle of Dunamase. (This information is still preserved in the traditions of the locality).Diarmuid had to fly the country on account of his many crimes, for all Ireland was leagued against him. He sought the help of Henry II of England to reinstate him to his kingdom. This led to the Norman Invasion. When Diramuid died, he left his kingdom of Leinster to Strong bow, who had married his daughter, Eva. They had one daughter Isabel who married William Marshall.\n\nThey had five sons and five daughters. Marshall was murdered by his fellow-Normans envious of his vast possessions. His sons died and his daughters married English Earls among whom the land was divided, with Eva as the youngest daughter, getting Dunamase. They lived on the Rock, which they erected into a manor, a feudal court, where their tenants came to render aid and service.Their daughter Maud, married Robert Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore. Thus, Dunamase passed from the hands of the O’Mores into those of an English Earl. Some of you may be interested to learn that from this marriage sprang the imperial house of Austria and the royal families of England, France, Prussia, Denmark, Holland, and Sardinia.\n\nMortimer fortified Dunamase, but as he preferred to live in England, he employed the Chief of the O’Mores to look after his possessions in Ireland. There are many references in the State papers of this period to Dunamase, but as they relate to Anglonorman succession only, they have not great interest in us. In the war between the Geraldines and the Red Earl of Ulster, great havoc was wrought throughout the country. In the reprisals which followed, Maurice Fitzgerald, son of the more famous Maurice, took John de Cogan and Theobald Butler from the sanctuary of Castle Dermot Church and imprisoned them in the dungeons of Dunamase. From this it would appear that Dunamase was then in the hands of the Geraldines in 1264.\n\nThe Bruce Invasion\n\nDunamase must have played no small part in the Bruce Invasion, for Sir Roger Mortimer, its then lord and master, acted as Deputy for the English King. In the large army, which he gathered to oppose the Bruce, there must have been many nobles of the O’More family. As a result of the Bruce invasion, many Irish families, among them the O’Mores and the O’Connors, threw off their allegiance to the English Crown and harassed the Pale. In 1325, Laoiseach O’More, who acted for the absent Mortimer as his captain of war in Laoighis, seized the castle of Dunamase and recovered for his family all the lands held by his ancestors, viz., all that extent of country lying between the Barrow and the Nore, and extending westwards towards the Slieve Bloom mountains, and portions of the present Counties of Kildare and Kilkenny.\n\nLaoiseach was a powerful and wealthy prince, and he was a man held in much esteem by his own people. At 1342 he was killed by one of his own retainers. O’Mores were attacked from all sides by the indignant Normans, but despite a protracted and exhausting war, they maintained their independence for the next two centuries. After Laoiseach’s death, Mortiner recovered procession of Dunamase. He fortified it strongly and made it his chief residence. The more firmly to secure it, he build other castles in the vicinity to replace those destroyed by Laoiseach. From now on, Dunamase was for many years the seat of the English civil and military jurisdiction.\n\nThough Dunamase had passed from their hands for the time being, the O’Mores were not inactive. They harassed the Pale on all occasions, so much so that in 1358, according to the annuals of Ulster, a large force marched from Dublin to invade and lay waste Laoighis. It was defeated by the then chief, and many English fell on the field of battle. In conjunction with Art MacMurrough Kavanagh, the O’Mores ravaged and laid waste the town and county of Carlow. In 1404, Gillapatrick O’More, Lord of Laoighis, defeated the English at Ath Dubh-now Blackford-a few miles from Stradbally, and took great spoil in horses, clothing and arms. In 1421, they defeated the Earl of Ormond at Old AbbyleixOn this occasion, the defeated enemy sought sanctuary in the Cistercian monastery.\n\nTo avenge this defeat, the Lord Lieutenant invaded Laoighis, and defeated the O’Mores at Red Bog of Athy, and laid waste their territory. The O’Mores had to sue for peace. About 1444, the O’Mores adopted the English system of primogeniture"
