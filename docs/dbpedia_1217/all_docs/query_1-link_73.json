        "text": "Since the middle of the nineteenth century Malvern has been well known as a centre of education, and it is amazing just how many schools there have been in the town over the years.\n\nOur story about past and present schools in Malvern, Worcestershire, England, started when we investigated the history of two small plaques in St Mary's Church, Guarlford, dedicated to the memory of former pupils of Southlea School, a small preparatory school for boys which closed in the 1930s.\n\nAfter considerable work we were relating our findings to an acquaintance who said 'Oh I went there'. And so it is that this page has continued to evolve as we delve into Trade Directories and people tell us about their school days in Malvern. You may find some entries rather long, as we have included interesting information about staff and pupils of those particular schools.\n\nYou can use the list of schools below to jump to any school that has special interest for you, by clinking on the link. The contents list is in the order we have written about the schools, not alphabetic; so you may find searching for your school easier using the Find on page feature of your web browser.\n\nKelly's Trade Directories of Worcestershire and others such as Littleburys (copies of which are held in the Reference section of Great Malvern Library) provide a unique insight into bygone Malvern, which is how we discovered the many schools there have been in Malvern, most small, a few relatively large. Even though we have researched a large number, still more appear and not all are mentioned here, but it is hoped you find this glimpse into the past interesting. If you are new to Malvern and looking for a school, we hope you find the list at the end helpful.\n\nWe still have information to add, but please do get in touch if you have photos or stories which could be added to this page.\n\nContents\n\nBackground\n\nClosed Independent schools\n\n> Southlea School\n\n>> Origins of Southlea\n\n>> More about Southlea and past pupils\n\n> Fairfield\n\n> St Cuthbert's\n\n> Holly Mount\n\n> The Link School\n\n> Lawnside\n\n> The Mount\n\n> Ivydene\n\n> Montpellier\n\n> Hatley St George\n\n> Croftdown\n\n> The Priory\n\n> Cherbourg\n\n> Gratton House\n\n> Fonthill College\n\n> Abbotshill\n\n> Wellington House\n\n> Elmsdale and Malvernbury\n\n> Ellerslie\n\n> The Abbey\n\n> Thorn Bank\n\n> Seaford Court\n\n> Hillside, Malvern Link\n\n> Hillside, West Malvern\n\n> Hillstone\n\n> The Hill\n\n> Langland House\n\n> Douglas House\n\n> Evendine Court\n\n> Fairseat\n\n> Hazel Bank and Amestrey\n\n> Mowbray\n\n> Felthorpe\n\n> The Birches\n\n> The Hollies\n\n> Thomas Essex's academy in Malvern Wells\n\n> Wells House\n\n> Cambridge House\n\n> The Manse\n\n> Stuart Lodge\n\n> St Hugh's\n\n> Cleeve Court\n\n> Queen Anne's\n\n> St Richard's\n\n> Lindfield\n\n> Clarendon\n\n> St Nicholas\n\n> Wychcrest\n\n> Malvernhurst\n\n> Connellan College\n\n> Other schools\n\nClosed Church and State schools\n\n> Lansdowne\n\n> Newland\n\n> The Lyttelton\n\n> Guarlford\n\n> North Malvern\n\n> Poolbrook\n\nSchools still open in 2012\n\n> Church schools\n\n> State schools\n\n> Independent schools\n\nPhotographs\n\nReferences\n\nBackground\n\nPrivate schools and tutors have provided an education for the gentry for hundreds of years. It seems that in the early days of the nineteenth century you needed no formal qualifications to set up a small private day school, just sufficient financial backing to lease a large house and buy some desks.\n\nAdditionally if you were setting up a school for boarders you would have required further accommodation, beds, kitchen staff and one or more matrons.\n\nFrom a prep school, pupils might go on to a senior school, and for boys possibly to a university.\n\nEnglish Universities prior to about 1870 were mostly restricted to rich men, who had to be members of the Church of England. These universities mainly taught religion and the arts, and it was not until about 1900 that new universities started to come into being, offering tuition in science and engineering modelled on German lines.\n\nIn Victorian times private boarding schools expanded to meet the needs of merchants, engineers and military officers serving abroad in the British Empire, who either wanted or needed their children (mostly boys) to be educated at home in Britain.\n\nIn those days, education of girls was not of high priority, so poor girls were destined to a life of servitude and hard work, whether married or not, whilst rich girls hoped to marry someone who would look after them and keep them in the manner to which they had been accustomed. Schools for young ladies taught them the skills they would need in married life.\n\nWWI changed that when women were required to take on the jobs of men away at the front, and afterwards there was a shortage of young men to marry, so thousands of young women of all classes suddenly found it necessary to pursue careers.\n\nThe contraction of the British Empire after WWII together with the inability of many British parents to afford the fees has led to pressure on schools in the private sector, despite overseas students being sought to fill the gaps. The reduction in the number of parents willing and able to afford private school fees was particularly apparent in the late 1980s when many schools were forced to either amalgamate or close.\n\nCompare this with the situation of Church and state schools:-\n\nThe Industrial Revolution resulted in more skills being needed in the workplace, requiring for example the ability to read and write, add up, and for some a basic understanding of engineering and chemical processes.\n\nThe passing of the Elementary Education Act in 1870 required the compulsory universal education of all children between 5 and 10 years.\n\nNational Schools were founded in the 1800s by the 'National Society for Promoting Religious Education'. These schools provided elementary education, in accordance with the teaching of the Church of England, to the children of the poor (ref 1).\n\nChurch and state schools grew and adapted to meet the needs of an expanding population, immigration, movement in centres of population and the changing skills needed in the workforce.\n\nThe discussion about what should be taught and how continues even now to be a subject of fierce debate as, for example, with the Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition government of 2010 positioning to take state schools outside Local Education Authority control in order to give schools and governing bodies that seek it greater independence and hopefully increasing the quality of education.\n\nA very early Malvern school for the poor was called 'The School of Ancient Industry' for spinning wool, flax, hemp etc. This was in Longridge Road for some 30 females of the poorer classes of the parish. The school, which taught spinning and needlework, was established by Lady Apphia Lyttelton about 1815 and closed in the 1840s after her death (ref 2). It was funded by charity.\n\nLady Lyttelton first lived at a black and white cottage named Peckham Grove in Poolbrook Road (later occupied by Polly Cartland, the mother of novelist Barbara Cartland). The house was renamed Littlewood House which is now largely hidden behind a fence and shrubbery, across the road from the 'Three Horseshoes' (see photo below).\n\nPeckham Grove now Littlewood House\n\nCirca 1821 Lady Lyttelton had a new house built on the east side of Poolbrook Road which she named Peachfield House. Peachfield House still stands and has been divided into two houses which can be found in Hayes Bank Road, just south of St Andrew's church (see white house in photo below).\n\nPeachfield House\n\nEducation for poorer families in Malvern, up until the end of the Second World War, would have been mainly provided by Church Schools.\n\nFrom 1870 the school leaving age was 10, being raised to 12 by 1899. In 1918 the school leaving age went up to 14; and in 1947 it was raised again to 15 years. So during this period Church Schools would have had pupils mostly in the age range 5 to 14 years, with only a very few who were bright enough, and whose parents could afford it, going on to Grammar School, for example at Hanley Castle.\n\nAbout 1902 Local Education Authorities (LEA) had been tasked with organising and funding state education. The first Council funded schools in Malvern were Somers Park in 1909 and Great Malvern, on the edge of Barnards Green, in 1916, augmenting the Church Schools, which by now were largely funded by the state.\n\nIt was not until 1953 that 'The Chase', the first Council School providing Secondary Education in Malvern, was opened, followed in 1958 by 'Dyson Perrins'. Before then the majority of pupils would have left school by age 15 to take up employment.\n\nThe Labour Government pursued the introduction of the 'Comprehensive' system of education in the 1970s, when the school leaving age went up to 16, whilst more recently the Conservative Party has been encouraging publicly funded schools to become Academy Trusts outside LEA control, and teenagers to remain in some sort of education until age 18, as jobs become more skilled.\n\nOn the examination front, in the 1970s, there had been a move towards modules and continuous assessment which some say enabled a larger percentage of students to achieve high grades. The pendulum now seems to be swinging the other way, with the Conservative Government of 2015 seeking 'A' levels to be examined at the end of the course, no doubt hoping for a better spread of marks that might better distinguish between different levels of academic ability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic swept the world in 2020 and the population of the UK isolated in order to protect the NHS and the elderly while vaccines were developed. Schools were closed for many months, exams cancelled and grades awarded by teachers.\n\nSo it is that the educational system continues to evolve pragmatically!\n\nBack to top\n\nClosed Independent schools\n\nSouthlea School\n\nSouthlea School, Albert Road 1917 - source: Peter Gibbs\n\nTwo small plaques in St Mary's Church, Guarlford, are dedicated to the memory of former pupils of Southlea school.\n\nOne inscription reads,\n\nAMDG In memory of James Hamilton Symonds who fell asleep 16 October 1918 from Southlea fellows and friends.\n\n(AMDG is an abbreviation for the Latin - Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam which translated means 'To the greater glory of God')\n\nJames Hamilton Symonds (died age 12 years) was the son of Dr George Henry Hamilton Symonds. James' elder brother Rowland Charles Symonds of Hereford went on to become a Brigadier in the Royal Artillery and married into the Peerage.\n\nThe second inscription reads,\n\nIn memory of Philip Nicholls who fell asleep St Matthias Day 1918 from Southlea School fellows and friends.\n\nThe plaque relates to a pupil of the school who died at a nursing home in Priory Road on 18th February 1918 aged only 11 years and is buried at Wolverley parish church. He was the son of Francis Welcome Nicholls and Hannah Street. Francis was a fruit merchant and farmer of Brookfield, Wolverley near Kidderminster, who had died in 1913. (Sadly Hannah died shortly after Philip thus leaving her seven other children orphans. Philip's elder brother Francis had to be the executor of his little brother's estate; he went on to develop a large and successful wholesale fruit and vegetable business).\n\nSouthlea, which was a private preparatory school in Albert Road, Great Malvern, in Worcestershire, had strong links with Guarlford Church, as the Rector, Reverend Frederick Newson, taught there for many years and was held in great esteem by staff and pupils, some of whom regularly attended Guarlford Church.\n\nNo physical trace of the school remains except for the car park opposite the Splash Leisure Centre, built on the school playing fields, being named Southlea car park. The playing fields at the rear of Southlea extended in an L shape across the back of two other houses all the way to Clarence road.\n\nThe main entrance to Southlea car park is in Priory Road, but map M113 of Great Malvern dated 1904 (stored in Malvern Library) shows that the house itself fronted on to Albert Road, which is now named Albert Road South. It must have been quite an important building as few of the other houses on the map were named.\n\nThe building, Southlea, stood where the Automatic Malvern Telephone Exchange was built, next to an old house which used to be called 'The Lynches' (see photo below); a strange name but possibly of Anglo Saxon origin, 'Linc' referring to a ridge or sloping ground.\n\nThe Lynches\n\nThe Lynches had typically been owned by retired doctors and surgeons.\n\nGreat Malvern was then a town for retired gentry with members of other classes mostly living in North Malvern and Malvern Link.\n\nRevd John Francis Cooksey born 1851 and ordained 1874 was the son of J A Cooksey MRCP of The Lynches. A later owner was Francis William Romney, a cricketer and solicitor, born 1873 who was educated at Malvern College and St Mary Hall Oxford. He was a partner in Romney, Fraser and Odly of the Abbey Gate House, Malvern.\n\nDuring WWII The Lynches, like Southlea, was probably taken over as a hostel for radar boffins as there was a patent application of 1943 about 'Improvements in or relating to Pulse Signal Selecting and Indicating Systems', by Frederick Calland Williams, of 1, The Lynches, Albert Road South, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, and others including Doreen Blumlein, who was representing her late husband, the scientist Alan Dower Blumlein.\n\nAlan Blumlein was the lead engineer on the wartime H2S Radar Project and was sadly killed when his Halifax trials aircraft crashed near Goodrich Castle.\n\nThe Lynches is now a care home for those with sensory impairments.\n\nLiving next door but one to Southlea school, at Stoberry, in 1901 was Lawrence Sidney Milward, a mathematics teacher at Malvern College and editor of the Malvern Register. His youngest son David Henry Milward (1907 - 1944) was a civil engineer; during WWII he was Corporal 13006110 Royal Engineers and his death 27th April 1944 is recorded on his parents' headstone in Guarlford churchyard. David's elder brother Frederick Alexander Milward served in the machine gun corps and tank corps towards the end of WWI (and survived).\n\nBack to top\n\nOrigins of Southlea School\n\nSouthlea school was started by Edward Roger Cooper Hays, the son of a solicitor, about 1861 and it probably closed in the late 1930s. At the time of closure the school had about 26 pupils and the headmaster was a Mr Girling. During WWII we think the buildings were used to provide accommodation for radar boffins from TRE. Later in the 1950s or 1960s the former school buildings were demolished to make way for Southlea car park and the Automatic Telephone Exchange, which replaced the manual exchange in Church Street.\n\nAn advertisement for the school appeared in Stevens' Directory and Gazetteer of 1901.\n\nAdvertisement for Southlea in 1901\n\nThe text of the advertisement reads:\n\nSouthlea, Great Malvern\n\nThe Rev HN Fowler, MA, late Scholar of New College, Oxford, and for 17 years Assistant Master at Malvern College, prepares boys for Scholarships and Entrance Examinations at the Public Schools, and for the Navy.\n\nSouthlea stands in a fine and healthy situation. Its grounds include an excellent levelled Cricket Field, Gymnasium, 2 Fives Courts, Carpenters' Shop etc. The boys learn swimming at the Imperial Baths, which are quite near.\n\nIn the bottom left corner of the drawing of the school is the signature 'Ed J Burrow'. This is followed by the initials 'del' which simply means he was the person who drew the picture. We think it quite likely this was Edward John Burrow, who ran a publishing enterprise in Cheltenham and was the nephew of the proprietor of the Malvern Advertiser newspaper, from 1867 to 1900, John Sloggett Jenkins.\n\nThe Southlea Charity\n\nOn 6th July 1883 Edward Roger Cooper Hays, who founded the school, by deed gave £160 Midland Railway 2½ per cent. stock, the annual dividends, amounting to £4, to be applied towards the education at the Lyttelton Grammar School of a boy chosen from Mill Lane (now called Malvern Parish in Manby Road), Wyche or St Ann's National schools, under the title of the Southlea Charity - ref: 'Parishes: Great Malvern with Newland', A History of the County of Worcester: volume 4 (1924). These were all church schools.\n\nDespite Lyttelton Grammar School closing about 1946, the Southlea Charity remained in existence until 1981 when a letter from the Charity Commission to the County Education Officer, dated 11th March 1981, confirmed that The Southlea Charity would be merged with the Blanchard Scholarship (created 25th July 1891) to form the Southlea and Blanchard Charity, under the trustee-ship of Dyson Perrins Church of England School.\n\nAim - to promote the education, including social and physical training, of boys attending the said school and in need of financial assistance.\n\n(We have not been able to identify St Ann's school - do you know where it was?)\n\nBack to top\n\nMore about Southlea and past pupils\n\nWe are very fortunate to have been sent some photos of Southlea by Peter Gibbs whose father Jeffrey was at Southlea school circa 1917 - 1919 (ref 22).\n\nJeffrey's Aunt Mildred Mary nee Gibbs was the wife of the headmaster, and his Aunt Florence Beatrice Gibbs was the matron and music teacher.\n\nMildred Mary Gibbs had married schoolmaster Hugh Edmund Wood, the son of a clergyman at Newport in 1908. It was her second marriage, her first husband Percival St Clair Williams having died of Tuberculosis only two years after their wedding. The census records Mildred and Hugh at Southlea in 1911 and trade directories put them at the school until 1928.\n\nThe photo below shows the headmaster Hugh Edmund Wood (centre) with staff and pupils.\n\nSouthlea staff and pupils circa 1917 - source: Peter Gibbs\n\nThe photo opposite shows Mildred, the wife of the headmaster, with two pupils.\n\nMildred looks very happy in the photograph but sadly her brother Private Horace Boddington Gibbs of the Canadian infantry had been killed in action on or about the 27th September 1916 aged 32 years. You can read more about Horace on the Malvern Remembers website.\n\nJeffrey Gibbs (1907 - 1971) was in the Southlea cricket team pictured below (left, front row)\n\nSouthlea cricket team circa 1917 - source: Peter Gibbs\n\nJeffrey had been awarded a certificate for the 100yds on school sports day instead of a cup.\n\nThe certificate reads:\n\nSOUTHLEA\n\nMalvern\n\nSince it has been decided to give up all prizes from Jan 1917, for the remainder of the War, and the give the value thereof to War Charities,\n\nThis certificate is awarded\n\nto J R Gibbs\n\nin place of the usual prize\n\nfor 100 yds under 9 1/2 1st Prize\n\nDate May 9th 1917\n\nOther group photos relating to Jeffrey Gibbs' time at Southlea are shown below.

He was educated Southlea, under Rev Samuel Latham, Haileybury and Cambridge and became an army officer. The London Gazette recorded him in 1919 as Major, 96th Berar Infantry, Indian Army; later to be Lieutenant Colonel, OBE.\n\nThe famous WWI General Henry Sinclair Horne born 1861 attended Southlea prep school before going on to Harrow. He was sketched circa 1922 by the American painter John Singer Sargent who had also made a charcoal drawing of Lady Beauchamp of Madresfield Court in 1911.\n\nAir Commodore George Philip Chamberlain OBE (1905 - 1995) also attended Southlea School, before going on to Denstone College and the RAF College at Cranwell. During WWII Philip, then a Wing Commander, was given the job of forming the Fighter Interception Unit at RAF Tangmere, where trials were conducted of night fighters equipped with airborne interception radar developed by TRE Malvern. He wrote this touching letter to Mildred Wood on the death of her husband Hugh, former headmaster of Southlea:\n\nTel Andover 2770\n\n25 The Avenue, Andover, Hants\n\n21st March 1954\n\nDear Mrs Wood,\n\nI have heard with great regret that 'the boss' is no longer with us; that is very sad for you, but it is also sad news for the many nasty little boys he turned in to reasonably sensible ones - certainly well mannered and well-informed ones - and started on their respective ways as useful citizens.\n\nI do hope you will be comforted just a little by the many letters you will get. Please do not acknowledge this one.\n\nI have often described H E Wood as the best schoolmaster I have ever known. It would be an impertinence to list to you the qualities that are required to comply with what I have described. He had them all, and I am still very grateful to him and I shall always admire the support you gave him. My father died a year ago, but my mother and Pat are still going strong.\n\nYours sincerely, Philip Chamberlain.\n\nHugh Wood in earlier times with staff and pupils (Gibbs family album)\n\nAnother letter written to Mildred Wood was from Edgar Lawday, who we think was a painter and decorator who probably did work for the school (ref 22). Part of the letter reads:\n\nMalvern has not altered much since you resided here, but your lovely old cricket pitch at 'Southlea' is a disgrace, being let to the TRE people, full of rubbish and old fowl pens. As you know how nice it always kept, it was one of Mr Woods 'Pride and Joy'.\n\nI often see Mr and Mrs Keble, I also do work for them. I am sure that they took a pattern from Mr Wood and yourself as they both worked hard at 'Little Malvern' and left the school (St Richard's) with a very good name. Perhaps when you have a few minutes to spare I would very much like to hear from you again and I will not be so long in replying.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nYours sincerely, Edgar Lawday\n\nOne of the last pupils at Southlea School was local resident Toby Bruce Morgan, who served as a Councillor for many years.\n\nClick here for more information about Edward Hays, founder of Southlea school, a headmaster Rev Arthur Sewell, and snapshots of the school roll.\n\nRear of Southlea circa 1917 - source: Peter Gibbs\n\nAfter being used to provide accommodation for TRE scientists during WWII, Southlea was demolished in the 1960s to build the Malvern automatic telephone exchange, and Priory Road car park was built on the playing fields.\n\nThe telephone exchange buildings which replaced Southlea\n\nBack to top\n\nFairfield\n\nFairfield boys' school was established by the Rev John Duncan Clement Wallace between 1884 and 1888 in premises allegedly specially built for the school on the Worcester Road in Malvern Link. Rev Wallace was born in India about 1851, the son of an Indian Army officer, and educated at Worcester College Oxford. He did not last long and was followed by two further headmasters before being succeeded by Edward Capel Smith who is listed at Fairfield in the 1902 National Telephone Company directory.\n\nJim Appleton sent us a postcard mentioning the school dated 1911.\n\nPostcard of Graham Road looking towards Fairfield and the Worcester Road\n\ncredit: Jim Appleton\n\nThe postcard dated 16th September 1911 was written by Wilfrid Ord to his sister Evelyn in Bristol and reads:\n\nI met my charges at Stapleton Road all right and arrived here about 25 minutes late. We have only 29 boys this term and so no-one has come to succeed Miss Gardiner. Next term the whole establishment is to be moved to Hillside in West Malvern. 1000 ft above sea level. This card shows Fairfield on the left. Love Wilfrid.\n\nThe 1911 census reveals Wilfrid Ord born Heidelberg was a Tutor at Fairfield; his father was a lecturer at Bristol University.\n\nThe postcard suggests that possibly Fairfield school was either to close or merge with Hillside in West Malvern with effect from January 1912.\n\nFurther investigation reveals that Hillside was put up for sale in 1910 and by 1911 its headmaster William Salter had left West Malvern. Edward Capel Smith is then listed in Trade Directories as the principal of Hillside school West Malvern from 1912 to 1921.\n\nIt would appear Edward Capel Smith continued to live at Fairfield where he died in 1923 aged 66 years. During his tenure, during WWI, Fairfield became a Red Cross Auxiliary Hospital offering 61 beds.\n\nIn 1938 Fairfield was sold to the Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund and renamed the Hugh Sumner convalescent home for children from Birmingham hospitals. In 1965 it became a home for the deaf.\n\nLocal historian Paul Ferris sent us photos of Fairfield as it was then, and is now.\n\nFairfield, credit Paul Ferris\n\nFairfield as it is today, credit Paul Ferris\n\nThe charming photo below shows the approach from Graham Road to the Worcester Road taken from the same spot as the 1911 postcard shown above. Fairfield is now obscured by trees, but the bench on the right still appears to be in the same spot one hundred and ten years later!\n\nGraham road, Malvern Link, today, © Jim Appleton\n\nSt Cuthbert's\n\nKelly's Trade Directory of 1940 lists St Cuthbert's prep school for boys, (Christopher Watson BA and Rev BT Vaughan Johnson principals); the school was in a large three storey villa on the Worcester Road in Malvern Link. By the end of WWII the school must have closed as roughly between 1947 and 1959 St Cuthbert's became a convalescent home annexed to Birmingham Childrens' Hospital.\n\nEarlier in 1901 the property was named Barassie House; once the home of Rev Frederick Peel, Vicar of Cowleigh and Little Malvern.\n\nCirca 1961 St Cuthbert's was acquired by Hillside prep school; perhaps Hillside got into financial difficulty as subsequently the property was demolished by McCarthy and Stone in order to build sheltered housing known as Morgan Court comprising about 60 one and two bedroom leasehold flats, which opened in 1988.\n\nThis event marked the demise of many prep schools and a swing to businesses building homes, and caring for, the increasing elderly population.\n\nSt Cuthbert's, replaced in 1988 by Morgan Court\n\nIn 1873 St Cuthbert's had been a school for ladies run by Miss L Finigan (ref 28). The boys' school is said to have been started by John Healey about 1904 (ref 30). At some point he acquired Hazel Bank next door which still stands at 179 Worcester Road.\n\nAmong former pupils were said to be Stuart Dyson Perrins, Admiral of the fleet Sir John Cunningham (1885 - 1962), General Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham (1887 - 1983) and Flag Captain Charles Henry Lawrence Woodhouse who was Captain of HMS Ajax at the Battle of the River Plate.\n\nArnold Capel Batho (1891 - 1916) was an assistant schoolmaster at St Cuthberts School. He is said to have been deeply interested in the Scouting movement and threw himself into the roll of Scoutmaster of the 3rd (St Cuthbert's) Malvern Link Troop while also on return to the family home in Twickenham, during holidays, assisted with the local troop.\n\nSadly schoolmaster 2nd Lt Arnold Capel Batho, The Middlesex Regiment, was killed in action at Leuze Wood on 15th September 1916, aged only 25 years. His name is recorded on the Roll of the Fallen at Holy Trinity, North Malvern, and on the Malvern Remembers web site.\n\nHolly Mount\n\nCaroline Cooper moved her 'school for young ladies' from Elmsdale in Abbey Road to Holly Mount Mansion above the Worcester Road in the 1860s. The Mansion had been put up for sale in 1863 following the death of its owner, widow Harriet Woodyatt.\n\nBy 1871, Holly Mount had changed hands again and Trade directories of 1872 and 1873 record Henry Wilson BA (classics) St Catherine's Cambridge running a boarding school for young gentlemen. According to Daphne Drake (ref 5) he had taken over the coaching business of WHK Kingston, author of 'Peter the Whaler', moving to Holly Mount in 1868.\n\nThe 1871 census recorded Henry Wilson BA born 1831 Crowthorne, Yorkshire living at Holly Mount with his wife Sarah, son Henry Inchcape; an assistant master Robert H Dockray, a nurse, cook, two house-maids, kitchen-maid and a page; plus seventeen pupils aged between 9 and 16 years.\n\nHenry Wilson was the eldest son of Thomas Wilson BA Catherine Hall Cambridge who in 1851 was auditor and comptroller of the Aire and Calder Navigation Company. In 1863 at Finchley Henry had married Sarah Susannah Mary Bullivant Custard whose parents had run a school near Yeovil. They had two children Henry Inchbald Wilson (1865 - 1932) and Edith Vaux Wilson.\n\nBy 1881 Henry Wilson had moved from Holly Mount to the larger Link School (see below).\n\nAbout 1904 Henry Wilson edited a publication - The parish registers of Farnborough in the county of Kent, from 1338 to 1812. His death not many years after was reported in the Times on 12th Jan 1907:\n\nWilson - on the 8th January 1907, suddenly, the result of an accident, Henry Wilson MA FSA of Farnborough Lodge, Farnborough, Kent in his 76th year. Funeral at (St Giles) Farnborough today, at 3.\n\nHenry's son solicitor Harold Inchbald Wilson (1865 - 1932) CBE, OBE, worked for the Ministry of Munitions during WWI.\n\nVery sadly Henry's only grandson Neville Inchbald Wilson (1892 - 1918) educated at Malvern College, Lieutenant 3rd Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers, MC, was killed in action on 6th April aged only 25 years.\n\nThe London Gazette reported the award of his Military Cross on 22nd April 1918:\n\nLt Neville Inchbald Wilson, Royal Welsh Fusiliers Special Reserve. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Thanks to his dauntless courage, splendid leadership and perseverance, a position captured by another battalion was successfully consolidated by the company under his command, despite intense machine-gun and rifle fire. His contempt of danger, splendid personal example, and devotion to duty inspired his men with the greatest confidence, and enabled them to fulfill their task under the most trying and adverse conditions.\n\nThe 1881 census recorded Henry Wilson at Malvern Link School. According to Daphne Drake (ref 5) Henry Wilson had purchased the grandiose Station Hotel in Malvern Link in 1873 and converted it into a boys' preparatory school, often referred to as 'The School' or 'Link School'.\n\nNo trace exists now of the school which closed in 1965 and was demolished in 1968 to build the flats known as Aspen Court.\n\nIn 1881 living at the school were Henry Wilson, Schoolmaster, MA Cambridge, his wife Sarah, and daughter Edith aged 9 years; William W Hickins, assistant master; Thomas J Ogden, assistant master BA Canterbury; 14 pupils aged between 12 and 16 years; a cook and 3 house-maids.\n\nBy 1891 the school's complement was much increased and unmarried schoolmaster William Douglas had taken over. The census records:\n\nThe School, Somers Road Malvern Link. In residence, William Douglas schoolmaster; Ellen, sister; three schoolmasters, Thomas James Ogden, Edward A Makin, and Gilbert Heaton; 55 pupils; boot-boy, matron under-matron, cook, 4 house-maids and a kitchen-maid.\n\nIn 1911 William Douglas was still at the school and had married. The census listed in residence:\n\nWilliam Douglas, schoolmaster, his wife Martha and three daughters; his brother Edward, a schoolmaster and three other masters, Cecil Spencer, Richard Fenn, and Duncan Felton; 36 pupils; a matron, nurse, cook, kitchen-maid, house parlour maid, 4 house-maids, and boot and garden boy.\n\nA former pupil of note was soldier Field Marshall John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort VC (1886 - 1946).\n\nBrian Iles relates that the school was badly damaged by a fire in 1925 and was bombed by the Luftwaffe during WWII.\n\nWilliam Douglas was still at the Link school in 1924 in partnership with Harold Paulley MA the son of surgeon Job Nathaniel Legg Paulley (1856 - 1943).\n\nIn 1915, Harold Paulley had married William's niece Margaret Elspeth Douglas. Their son Harold Noel Paulley born in 1924 was to serve as an officer in the Royal Navy and married a Malvern girl at Singapore in 1949.\n\nBy 1932, Harold Paulley senior seems to have taken over the Link school. Kelly's Trade Directory of 1940 listed the headmaster as H Paulley MA, The School, Osborne Road, and Somers Road, Malvern Link. Headmaster Harold Paulley died in Wales in 1973 aged 83 years.\n\nIn 1946 Eric Hunt, who specialised in turning round ailing schools, became the next headmaster. He was there 5 years. Finally came Ormond Oliver Postgate who sold the school to a developer.\n\nWorld War II Memorial\n\nSurviving in Malvern Museum can be found the Link School's 2nd World War Roll of Honour (see photo opposite, courtesy of Malvern Museum).\n\nThe transcription reads:\n\n2nd World War\n\nRoll of Honour\n\nCapt B A Warburton-Lee VC\n\nLieut-Commander AWR Keene\n\nGJB Kendall\n\nL/A/C RD Burt\n\nCapt WPC Williams MC\n\nLieut JDL de Wend Fenton\n\nPilot/Officer GH Seeley\n\nSergt-Pilot A N Brown\n\nSergt KWY Fison\n\nSub-Lieut GR Price\n\nLieut PV Anthony\n\n2nd Lieut BB Atherton\n\nDJ Wickett\n\nLieut HC Lea-Wilson\n\nLieut CJA Paulley\n\nCapt CW Barneby\n\nLieut AIB Cumming\n\nDH Milward\n\nSub-Lieut ACW Porter\n\nF/Officer WC Allies\n\nCapt CP Douglas\n\nField Marshal the Viscount Lord Gort, VC, GCB, CBE, DSO, MVO, MC\n\n2nd Lieut GBC Harrison\n\nProbably all these men were casualties except Viscount Gort who died of cancer of the liver in 1946.

He is buried in Minturno War Cemetery.\n\nDavid Henry Milward's name is remembered on the memorial to his father Lawrence Sidney Milward, a mathematics teacher of Malvern College who is buried in Guarlford churchyard. David Henry Milward, born Malvern 1907, Corporal 13006110 Royal Engineers, formerly a civil engineer, died on 28th April 1944 and is also remembered on the war memorial in Great Malvern Priory and at the library.\n\nWWI Memorial\n\nIn 2020 local historian Cora Weaver was able to acquire the Link School roll of those that had won honours in the Great War. The board was being auctioned at Tewkesbury and when the vendor heard that Malvern Museum already had the WWI board he very kindly agreed to gift it to the Museum.\n\nClick to view - The Great War, Distinctions Won\n\nPhoto credit: Cora Weaver\n\nMemories of former pupils\n\nSkip to read Everett Jones memories of the Link School on another page\n\nOne source told us that in its final years it was not a particularly friendly school. The account of a former pupil recollecting his time at the school in the late 1950s seems to confirm this (ref 19). He recollects:\n\nThe School motto was: *Vis Unita Fortior* (united strength is stronger).\n\nThe headmaster was then Ormond Oliver Postgate MA, (1905 - 1989) who was the son of John P Postgate. This J P Postgate, a Professor of Latin, had six children, one of whom was our headmaster, Ormond Oliver, and another, Raymond was author of the Good Food Guide and father of Oliver Postgate well known author of the childrens' books 'Ivor the Engine' and 'Noggin the Nog'.\n\nOrmond Oliver Postgate, in Cairo in 1939, had married, in Jerusalem during the Second World War, Patricia the daughter of Thomas Eric Peet (1882 - 1934) who had been Professor of Egyptology at Leeds University and is listed in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The couple were both teachers.\n\nOrmond and Patricia's son Nicholas (born 1945) was also at the Link School and became Professor of Assyriology at Cambridge University and Fellow of the British Academy. I remember him at school and also met him by chance in Baghdad in 1975, when he was vice-director of the British school of Archaeology there, and I was on a British Council tour as lecturer at the University of Basrah.\n\nThe Link School was an extremely academic school, and woe-betide any poor boy who couldn't learn his irregular Latin and French verbs; they were treated by Mrs Postgate, the teacher of those subjects from Form 3 (age 10), with derision and she generally terrified everyone who was not vaguely academic. She was highly academic herself, and was (with hindsight) probably totally frustrated at teaching little boys, most of whom were local farmers' children who had no interest in Latin and French.\n\nHer treatment of the boys was out of keeping with the times, even then! Standing in the corner, making a boy remove his shorts because he kept putting his hands back in his pockets, throwing non-swimmers into the deep end of the pool if they didn't dare get into the dirty water, or forcing boys to eat up all their food and forbidding dessert until the main course had been consumed. One poor boy, who I think still resides in Malvern, couldn't eat rice pudding, and so he stayed behind in the dining room when all had gone and emptied it behind the heating pipes (or so the story went).\n\nWith me it was the terrible pig liver on Tuesdays, so I also had to sit there until everyone had gone and put it in my pocket, to be disposed of later. The headmaster's wife was a terror, and this may have partly led to the demise of the school, as so many boys were withdrawn, including the two hydrophobic boys, whom I witnessed repeatedly being thrown into the water. One weekend, in about 1960, about 15 day-boys were withdrawn from the school after a meeting of local parents; they turned up at the Downs in Colwall or Seaford Court up the road the following Monday. Academic boys survived; in fact there were 4 of us in the Upper Sixth in 1962; all four of us went on eventually to Oxford, via Malvern College. Apart from Nicholas Postgate the only other recent alumnus that I know of really worth mentioning is the Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid. He went on to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, also via Malvern College, and has since become a world-famous journalist in all media (Daily Telegraph correspondent, CNN etc) and is a world expert on the problems of Central Asia.\n\nPerhaps the real reason the school closed, I suppose, apart from declining numbers, was that Mr Postgate got an excellent price for the plot of land on which the school was situated and the several-acre playing fields down in Malvern Link somewhere near the end of Pickersleigh Road, if I remember rightly. They would have fetched a good price.\n\nIn the 1950s the Link School was not the only one where pupils were told to eat everything on their plate, fat, grisle and all. Perhaps bullying, but maybe a lingering response to food rationing during WWII. Times are different now we hope!\n\nJeremy Palmer living in Barbados sent us this communication:\n\nGreetings from Barbados! My brother Jonathan, myself and our cousin John Barnard all went to The Link although we hailed from the island of St Vincent in the West Indies. When the school closed we went to Cobham House which was the Junior School for Bromsgrove where our cousin John had gone. There were several of us from 'The Link' there and one Clive Haffner still has school Sports photos of that era. My cousin John took 10 wickets and scored 50+ runs against Malvern St Richard's. The school itself, as one of your contributors notes and I confirm, was pretty barbaric even for the times. I later ran into Postgate and his wife at a hotel called the Wessex in Winchester where I was working and he was teaching or tutoring. That would have been about 1973 or 74. He remembered my brother and I as our father had sent barrels of limes to make lime juice for the school and on another occasion mangoes for the school.\n\nThe late Peter Morgan of the Morgan Motor Company also went to the Link; when he heard that someone was visiting the factory had been at The Link he came and introduced himself to my wife and I. He was there in the 50's and I was there from '61 until the school closed.\n\nOutside the Abbey hotel - source: Jeremy Palmer\n\nThe photo above shows former pupils of the Link School relaxing on a bench outside the Abbey Hotel, half term circa 1966/67. Jeremy Palmer (left), Michael Barnard (middle) and Jonathan Palmer (right). Mike the younger brother of John Barnard was bright and went to Malvern College.\n\nAdrian Leopard was another former pupil. He recalls (ref 39):\n\nI and my two brothers all went to this school and there was a Leopard there for every year that the Postgates were there except the last one; I left in 1964. Just for a period of only a few terms were we all there at the same time and I became Leopard 3. They were extremely intelligent people and there is no doubt that Mrs Postgate was not suited to teaching little boys who did not care about Latin verbs! She was an absolute terror. Not only did she throw boys into the swimming but if you turned up and had forgotten your swimming trunks, you just got on with it anyway, in the nude! And there was invariably someone who did not have them. The swimming pool was filled with 'railway water' as this was free, but it took a week. Only if there was a crisis was the mains water tap turned on to fill it up.\n\nThe school building was an interesting one. When I was a day boy I used to get the train from Worcester and we could go direct from the platform into the school garden. The grounds were fun for the kids and the games field was not down Pickersleigh Road but at the bottom of Regency Road. It was not all bad - there was a fabulous piano teacher called Mrs Rudhall. She taught me and I went on to become a church organist amongst other things. Years later I became organist and choirmaster at St James' Church, West Malvern amongst other places. I remember Mrs Rudhall to this day. In fact I can mentally walk around the school more or less by perfect memory today and it was quite a shock to see the honours board on your site!\n\nIan Simpson a former pupil now living in Canada, who attended the school with his brother Peter, shared with us two photos dating from about 1964. One is of the entire school, which was taken on the tennis court which was located on the premises. Click photo to enlarge.\n\nThe Link School about 1964\n\nThe other photo is of the school cricket team.\n\nLink School Cricket Team, about 1964\n\nThe cricket photograph was taken at the back door of the school. Peter Simpson is sitting front row left next to Jeremy Palmer. Ian Simpson is located in the back row, second from right. Do you recognise any other pupils?\n\nWe have not found either an obituary or biography of Ormond Oliver Postgate (1905 - 1989) but he seems to have returned to the UK from teaching in the Middle East about 1945 and lived for some years in Newbury. He is first recorded at The Link School in the 1957 phone book, suggesting that he came to the school circa 1956.\n\nOn 8th April 1958 The Times published a letter from Ormond Postgate about education in the Middle East in which he put the need for more British schools for Arab schoolboys to counter 'present problems'. Perhaps like TE Lawrence and Gertrude Bell he had a good understanding of the region and foresaw growing problems which perhaps the politicians at home did not fully understand.\n\nBack to top\n\nLawnside (see photo below)\n\nEarly history of the school\n\nLawnside, on the junction of Avenue Road with Albert Road South, opened about 1885, and its first headmistress was Janet Leighton, the daughter of a Scottish Land Agent and Surveyor. She had bought the Ladies School at Malvernbury in Abbey Road circa 1873 following the death of its Principal Caroline Cooper, and moved her school first to a house named Oak Hill at the junction of Albert Road South with Clarence Road (see photo below) and then in 1885 to Lawnside. In 1871 she had been Principal of a Ladies School in Bedford.\n\nIf you count the 'baton being passed' by Caroline Cooper it was probably the first boarding school founded for older girls in Great Malvern.\n\nThe photo below shows the side of the present house on the site of 'Oak Hill' which was occupied by Janet Leighton's school in 1881, three years before the school moved to Lawnside. The house is larger than it looks in this picture and has a brick extension on the east side.\n\nWhile at Lawnside, Janet Leighton went into partnership with Florence Kate Firth until 1898 when The London Gazette of July 8th recorded:\n\nNotice is hereby given that the partnership heretofore subsisting between us the undersigned Janet Leighton and Florence Kate Firth carrying on business as boarding school Principals at Lawnside Malvern under the style or firm Leighton and Firth is dissolved by mutual consent as and from the 1st day of May 1898. All debts due to and owing by the said firm will be received and paid by the said Janet Leighton. Dated this 30th day of May 1898.\n\nJanet Leighton\n\nFrances Kate Firth\n\nJanet Leighton died in London in 1915.\n\nFlorence Kate Firth continued as headmistress at Lawnside until 1908 when she retired and the business was jointly taken over by Madame Laura Robinet who retired in 1918 and Miss Gertrude Harman who retired in 1925.\n\nLawnside school closed in 1994, due to dwindling numbers, when the school merged with St James and The Abbey School (ref 6).\n\nSome of the Lawnside teachers were obviously inspirational as can be seen by various stories told by Angela Huth who was a boarder at Lawnside in the 1950s. The Headmistress was then a Miss Barrows whose father had bought the school for her. Miss Barrows was a friend of Sir Edward Elgar and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nThe School buildings have now been developed into residential apartments.\n\nAbout Edward Chance\n\nIn 1881 Lawnside was owned by Edward Chance who was recorded as a master silesia and alkali manufacturer. Earlier in the 1871 Census he was recorded as a glass manufacturer.\n\nHe was a son of William Chance who went into the glass manufacturing business with his brother Robert Lucas Chance forming the renowned Midlands glassworks firm Chance Brothers and Company.\n\nThe lychgate at Powick church was built 1912 in memory of his cousin Arent de Peyster Chance died 1906, whose mother was the daughter of Arent de Peyster, a soldier who fought for the British during the American War of Independence.\n\nEdward's elder brother James Timmins Chance, 1814 - 1902, became head of Chance Brothers and Company and was created a Baronet in 1900.\n\nEdward Chance, 1824 - 1881, is buried in Great Malvern Cemetery and there is also a touching memorial to him in Great Malvern Priory in the form of a brass plaque.\n\nChance Glass Ltd an offshoot of the original company is based in Malvern near the Morgan factory.\n\nThe American poet Longfellow visited Lawnside about 1868 and met boys from Southlea School, opposite, where Edward Chance's son Frederick had been a pupil. Sir Frederick William Chance 1852 - 1932 later became MP for Carlisle. Edward Chance seems to have been held in high regard and St Andrew's church at Poolbrook was erected in his memory. St Andrew's was built in 1885 and was dedicated as the Chance Memorial Chapel, as well as a chapel of ease and daughter church of Christchurch.\n\nMore about the house and school - The Grove\n\nLawnside school was closely associated with the 'arts' and the school doctor, Medical practitioner Charles Harry Hanger East, who lived in Priory Road, was a nephew of the Victorian landscape painter Sir Alfred East, who became President of the Royal Society of British Artists. Madame Laura Robinet, who was a principal of the school in 1911, was the wife of French painter Paul Robinet.\n\nThe Grove, a Gothic revival house just yards away across the road, became part of Lawnside School for sixty plus years (see photos below).\n\nThe Grove was designed and built by Edmund Wallace Elmslie, a London architect, for himself in 1867; he was also the architect for Great Malvern railway station, the Avenue Road bridge over the railway, and the Imperial Hotel built in 1862 which was bought by Malvern Girls College in 1919.\n\nA map of Malvern dated 1881 shows that the Grove used to be named St Munghos. Elmslie sold the Grove (St Munghos) to Dr. Archibald Weir who is also mentioned on our page about Elmslie. His son, soldier General Sir George Alexander Weir KCB born 1876, may have attended Southlea preparatory school next door. His elder son Archibald Munday Weir became a medical practitioner in Malvern Link.\n\nDr Weir added a billiards room to the Grove. The house was sold about 1921 to become part of the Lawnside Girls' School, and the billiards room became a concert hall where Sir Edward Elgar and Sir George Bernard Shaw were regular visitors.\n\nThe photo below shows the Grove in 2015 after renovation. It is now named Elmslie House.\n\nThe plaque at the entrance to Lawnside records that the poet Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) visited the school. Possibly it was no coincidence that his first cousin, once removed, Edmund Charles Tennyson D'Eyncourt married Charlotte Ruth Godson daughter of Barrister, Freemason and MP for Kidderminster Sir Augustus Frederick Godson, who lived at a mansion named Ashfield, near the junction of College Road with Abbey Road, Great Malvern.\n\nLawnside school closed about 1994 and the property lay empty for a long while before being converted into residential apartments.\n\nThe Mount\n\nNot far from Lawnside in Albert Road North was another school for girls at 'The Mount' run by Rosa Campbell Burley who was born Dartford about 1865. It was the school chosen by the composer Edward Elgar for his daughter Clarice Irene Elgar.\n\nPevsner described the house as Italianate with raised pedimented centre (ref 18).\n\nIvydene\n\nIsabel Greenslade, the daughter of a draper, born at Bristol in 1862, founded the school which would become Malvern Girls' College, now Malvern St James, with her business partner Miss Lily Poulton.\n\nThe first lessons were held about 1893 at Ivydene a 'brick built' house in College Road opposite Malvern Boys' College occupied by architect William Ford Poulton, his wife (a retired teacher) and their daughter Lily.\n\nIvydene, College Road, built 1886\n\nAbout 1899 Greenslade and Poulton bought Mrs Norton's school at 'Montpellier' in Albert Road North, opposite The Mount, and the house was renamed 'Ivydene Hall'.\n\nAn extra story was built to accommodate the growing number of pupils, and a large hall added at the side providing a gymnasium and studio (demolished in 2014).\n\nAbout 1907 'The Mount' across the road was added to the school's property portfolio.\n\nBy 1911 the expanded establishment was called 'The College for Girls' and the joint Principals were Isabel Greenslade, Lily Poulton and Blanche Eleanor Mitchell.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1913 the school also rented a large house named Stoberry in Albert Road South at the junction with Clarence Road (see photo opposite).\n\nFurther properties were acquired over time. Kelly's Trade Directory of 1916 listed four Principals, the Misses Greenslade, Poulton, Mitchell and Dawson; Malvern Girls' College; with properties in Albert Road, Avenue Road, and Tibberton Road.\n\nIn 1919 the school took the giant leap of moving to the Imperial Hotel opposite Great Malvern railway station, now the home of the well known private school Malvern St James.\n\nBy 2015, Ivydene in Albert Road, where the college started, had fallen into a poor state of repair and was being renovated by Court Property Developers Ltd with the intention to convert the building into 14 apartments and build a 2 storey home at the rear (see photo below).\n\nPevsner mentions in a footnote that Malvern Girls' College colonised the roughcast Ivydene, giving it half timbered gables 1903 (ref 18).\n\nNext door to Ivydene on the corner of Albert Road North and Church Street is a house named Summerside which was acquired about 1903 and connected to Ivydene by a covered gallery; Summerside was also known as School House.\n\nPevsner described Summerside (pictured above, awaiting renovation) as by A C Baker 1884 with a pyramid roofed tower with triangular oriel.\n\nThe house may have been built earlier or perhaps there was another house named Summerside as there are references to a 'Summerside' in the London Gazette of 1865 and Census of 1871:\n\nIn 1865 the London Gazette recorded the bankruptcy of John Jones a lodging house keeper and retailer of beer and wine of Summerside House, Bedford House and Refreshment Rooms, Great Malvern.\n\nWhile the 1871 census recorded Isaac Hollis living at Summerside (lodging house) with his much younger second wife Catherine. The business Isaac Hollis and Sons was a Birmingham based gun manufacturer, and Isaac died at Malvern in 1875.\n\nMiss Greenslade who founded Ivydene which became the Girls' College retired to live at Abbotsmead in Avenue Road and died in 1940.\n\nPicture above: line drawing of Abbotsmead\n\nFor a much fuller account of the school you are referred to Pamela Hurle's excellent book Malvern Girls' College, a Centenary History (ref 3).\n\nMontpellier\n\nMontpellier was a Ladies' School in Albert Road, acquired by Isabel Greenslade in 1899, as mentioned above.\n\nThe school seems only to be listed in Kelly's Trade Directory of 1896, the Principal being a Mrs Rosa Norton. However reference 3 refers to an earlier advertisement for the school in an illustrated survey of Malvern in 1894; to quote extracts:\n\na school for the daughters of gentlemen... an aristocratic establishment... Mrs Norton while possessing a large amount of the necessary governing power, is at the same time kindly to a degree which must react favourably on the people under her charge.\n\nRosa Norton does not appears in the 1891 and 1901 census of Great Malvern and so we think it likely her school was only in existence from about 1894 to 1899. That also makes it very difficult to identify her family and how she came to acquire the school. However we think it possible she was the Rosa Mary Norton, born London in 1849, who had married in 1876 George Joseph Frederick Norton (1839 - 1914) the son of sugar planter Joseph Norton (1801 - 1881) of British Guiana in South America. In 1881 that Rosa is Principal of Uplands School in London and her husband is a traveller in the wine and spirits trade. In 1891 the family is living at Langley near Eton and her husband is oddly described as a mushroom grower. Rosa died at London in 1900 and so, if she was the lady who started the school at Montpellier, possibly it was ill health that forced her to pass the school on to Isabel Greenslade.\n\nRosa was the daughter of draper and silk broker William and Mary Ann Bemand. When her mother died in 1858 her maternal grandfather silversmith James Killick was appointed her guardian. Rosa first married in 1869 Robert Thackery Reilly but in 1870 her husband died in Dublin and their son was stillborn.\n\nRosa and George Norton had three children. Daisy the eldest born in 1877 married bank clerk George Herbert Wheeler and they also had three children. Rosa's son Cuthbert Hugh Norton born 1879 became a civil servant and travelled widely overseas. He became District Commissioner to British Guiana, where his grandfather had been a sugar planter, and was awarded the OBE in 1938. Youngest daughter Gladys Amy born 1888 did not marry. She was baptised at Christ Church, Erith in Kent; the family was then living at Ellicombe, in Bexley Road, Erith where her father was recorded as a wine merchant. We get the impression for one reason or another the family did not stay in one place long.\n\nHatley St George\n\nThe 1927 Ordnance Survey map of Great Malvern (East) shows a large house and grounds in Albert Road midway between Malvern College and the railway line. In 1911 this was the home of Colonel Thomas Heywood JP. After his death in 1915 Hatley St George became a Junior House of Malvern Girls' College and in 1918 Miss Dawson may have been the Head.\n\nMiss Kate Dawson was the fourth joint Principal of Malvern Girls' College, in its formative years, from 1912 to 1928. She was educated at York High School, the University College of North Wales Bangor, and Royal Holloway College at Egham in Surrey. She received her BA in 1894, possibly being amongst the first group of women in the country to be awarded a degree.\n\nIn the mid 1800s the mansion had been known as Oak Hall, not to be confused with Oak Lodge further down Albert Road. Circa 1890 Oak Hall was renamed Hatley St George after an ancestor of Thomas Heywood's second wife, Sophie Grace St George.\n\nHatley St George, south front, courtesy of Malvern St James\n\nThe next photo, showing one of the classrooms, suggests there may have been up to 20 pupils in a class.\n\nHatley St George, a classroom, courtesy of Malvern St James\n\nThe dining hall, see below, was probably very similar to that of many other private schools before the Second World War.\n\nHatley St George dining hall, courtesy of Malvern St James\n\nHatley St George Assembly Hall, courtesy of Malvern St James\n\nThe assembly hall was in a separate prefabricated building and looks very similar to the one that was installed at Ellerslie.\n\nRuby Helena Margetts, the daughter of a butcher, taught music at the school and possibly also at Abbotshill and The Priory. She was born at Chipping Norton in 1883 and died at Malvern in 1961. In 1901, aged 17 years, she had been at the Beethoven House Music School in Northampton.\n\nHatley St George was greatly extended by Malvern Girls' College, and a new wing created now named Hatley Court.\n\nWhen the property became surplus to requirements, Malvern Girl's College sold Hatley St George which, like many other larger properties in Great Malvern, was converted into apartments. After changing hands again, Hatley St George was further being renovated by Developer Steve Hickman in 2017.\n\nClick to read more about the history of Hatley St George\n\nCroftdown\n\nCroftdown preparatory school in Abbey Road was founded in 1940 and flourished for many years until its decline in the early 1990s, when it was taken over by Malvern Girls' College, finally being closed in August 1997, because of falling rolls. The house and grounds have now been developed, with the original school being converted into six luxury apartments plus five new buildings, combining apartments and town houses.\n\nKelly's Trade Directory of 1950 listed Croftdown, boarding and day school, telephone 183, Principal Miss M Wortley.\n\nA former pupil recalls:\n\nAfter Miss Wortley, who I remember very well, I think Mrs Bott from Colwall became the head. I can't remember her Christian name, but her husband, Ian, worked at RRE.\n\nThere was a nursery department across the road at Prior's Lea. The Red Door was the entrance to the upper class in the Nursery department. The fire escape doubled as an exit for classrooms on the front upstairs. The 'Tinies' were at the back of the house with safe entry onto the garden at the rear. In the 1970s the school was run by a Board of Governors with Mrs Portway-Fletcher as Headmistress.\n\nPrior's Lea, nursery department of Croftdown\n\nThe Priory\n\nThe building of Priory Park Mansion, the present Council House (see photo below) began in 1874 for merchant Alfred Miles Speer. Following his death in 1894 the property was let to Ebenezer Lloyd-Jones (1836 - 1922) who in the 1901 census is recorded as having a school at The Priory. In 1911 Ebenezer was granted a 14 year lease for a school for the sons of gentlemen. His son Edward Harold Lloyd-Jones took over as headmaster but died soon after at London in 1912. In 1913 the tenancy passed to Claude Harold Giles BA, and he continued to run the school with Arthur Clement Allen MA, who in 1911 had been the Principal of Cherbourg preparatory school on the Wells Road.\n\nIn 1925 when the lease expired, the school left Malvern and moved to Wood Norton Hall near Evesham. The school then became known as the Wood Norton Preparatory School for Boys, telephone Evesham 230. It continued to be run by Claude Harold Giles and Arthur Clement Allen until about 1936.\n\nWood Norton Hall was occupied by the BBC during WWII and is now a hotel.\n\nEbenezer Lloyd-Jones of Abbotshill in Abbey Road died in 1922 and is buried in Great Malvern cemetery, where there is also a memorial to his son, a doctor, who was killed in WWI.\n\nCherbourg\n\nCherbourg (see illustration of east face below taken from Priory Road) is a large house below the Wells Road opposite the turning to the Wyche cutting, possibly built about 1850. It was last used as a boarding house by Ellerslie School for girls, but much earlier there had been a preparatory school for boys. We don't know exactly when the first boys' school moved to Cherbourg but possibly it was as early as 1881. The modern flat roofed building below is Hardwick House on Abbey Road built in the 1960s.\n\nThe London Gazette of January 30th 1891 records:\n\nNotice is hereby given that the Partnership heretofore subsisting between us the undersigned Frederick William Young and Arthur Vernon Vines, heretofore carrying out the business of Schoolmasters at Cherbourg House, the Leasowes and Norfolk Villas, Great Malvern, in the county of Worcestershire under the style or firm of Young and Vines, was dissolved by mutual consent as and from the 1st day of December 1890. The said business as from that date be carried on by the said Arthur Vernon Vines alone, who will receive and pay all the debts and liabilities due to and owing by the late firm. Dated this 23rd day of January 1891.\n\nFrederick William Young was a clergyman and the son of a land surveyor. He was born Dorking, Surrey in 1830 and died at Sussex in 1919. He first married Eliza Rumsey in 1855 by whom he had three children. In 1861, Frederick was staying with his brother in law, Henry W Rumsey, a schoolmaster and his father-in-law a retired school master. At that time Frederick was curate of Great Missenden so perhaps it was the influence of his wife's family that caused him to become a schoolmaster. Eliza died in 1864 and Frederick married second, in 1867, Jane Catherine Young by whom he had several children. The 1871 census records Frederick as a clergyman and head of an establishment named Etonhurst, in Upper Chase Road, Barnards Green, Malvern; there are two assistant masters, one of whom is Arthur Vernon Vines aged 25 years, and 17 pupils aged between 9 and 18 years. In recent times, Etonhurst must have been demolished as there is a modern block of flats of that name there now.\n\nBy 1881 Frederick is a schoolmaster on the Wells Road, possibly at Cherbourg; there are 3 tutors and 37 pupils. North Leasowes, mentioned above, is a lodging house next door.\n\nAnother website records that Ernest Wright Alexander VC (1870 - 1934) had been educated at Cherbourg House, Harrow and Sandhurst; his father Robert was a prominent Liverpool based ship-broker and had been a director of the Suez Canal Company.\n\nIn 1891, Rev Frederick William Young and his wife retired to live next door to a girls' school in Eastbourne, where perhaps he became a chaplain; Cherbourg school was then run by Arthur Vernon Vines.\n\nArthur Vernon Vines, the son of a solicitor, was born at Reading in 1846. In 1861 he had been a pupil at Christ's Hospital, and in 1871 was an assistant master working in Malvern for Rev Frederick William Young.\n\nWe don't know where Arthur was in 1881, but on 25th August 1885 at St Lukes, Cheltenham he married Mary Adelaide Green who was born Bengal, India on 9th May 1864. She was the daughter of Major-General Sir George Wade Guy Green KCB, formerly of the Bengal Staff Corps, and Ellen Facey Carter daughter of William Carter of Troy, Jamaica (ref 20). Her grandfather Revd George Wade Green (1785 - 1868) had been vicar of Tytherington in Gloucestershire, between 1817 and 1830 and you can read more about him on the Tytherington Roots website.\n\nIn 1891 Arthur Vernon Vines was living at Cherbourg, but there were no pupils or staff; perhaps it was not term time or had something to do with the previous headmaster leaving.\n\nThe 1901 census records Arthur as 'Principal of a School' living at the Chestnuts with 7 pupils aged 15 - 18 years and another master. A few doors away at Cherbourg, his brother-in-law Thomas Coates is a married preparatory schoolmaster, with 2 assistant masters, 27 boarders and other staff; possibly Arthur Vernon Vine and younger Thomas Coates became joint Principals at the school.\n\nThomas Coates, born 27 Sep 1872 in Yorkshire had married on 22nd April 1887 at Christ Church, Cheltenham, Georgina Lilian Green who was born at Bedford on the 19th of April 1870; she was the younger sister of Arthur Vernon Vine's wife Mary. Thomas Coates went on to be a Classics teacher at Bedford School (1907 - 1931). In the 1911 census Thomas is described as an assistant schoolmaster at a secondary school, living at 11 Rothsay Road, Bedford with his wife Georgina, sons Ronald Gordon and Donald Ivor who were born in Malvern, a cook and a housemaid.\n\nRonald Gordon Coates was born at Malvern on the 16th of April 1888. He was educated at Bedford School, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Devonshire Regiment, with which he served in the war 1914-1918, being wounded twice severely.\n\nDonald Ivor Coates was born at Malvern on the 24th of March 1900. He was educated at Bedford School, and at Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1922 he passed into the Sudan Political Service.\n\nBy 1911 Arthur Vernon Vines had also left Malvern and was described in the census as a 'retired army coach' living by the sea at Margate. We wondered whether at some time he had specialised in educating boys hoping to gain entrance to the military academies at Sandhurst and Woolwich. He died on 16th October 1915 at Cheltenham leaving no children.\n\nThe 1911 census lists the new Principal at Cherbourg as Arthur Clement Allen; Kelly's Trade Directory lists him still at the school in 1917, but by then he was also probably involved with the new Priory School in Priory Park (see above). Arthur Clement Allen born Shropshire 1868 was the third son of William Allen, vicar of Eccleshall. He was educated Oxford obtaining his BA in 1891; he died at Fleet, Hampshire in 1957.\n\nIn 1920 and 1923, Kelly's Trade Directories list Miss Lloyd-Jones, the daughter of Ebenezer Lloyd-Jones (first headmaster of the Priory School), having educational establishments at Cherbourg and Abbotshill (see below).\n\nCherbourg House later became part of Ellerslie School for Girls.\n\nThe building still exists but in 2015 was empty awaiting restoration.\n\nGratton House\n\nThe 1891 census records a school for teenage girls at Gratton House, in Orchard Road, which had earlier been the home of water cure doctor James Wilson.\n\nCatherine Marian Horry head of the household is recorded as a school mistress; there are three English teachers (her sisters), a French teacher, a German teacher and 18 boarders aged between 14 and 17 years.\n\nCatherine was the eldest daughter of William Smith Horry a ship-broker of Romford, Essex. We have not found Catherine in the British records after the 1891 census, nor her brother William Smith Horry (junior) who was born 1861 Edmonton, Middlesex. We wondered if he was the William Smith Horry of some note who became chief engineer of the Peoples' Gas Light and Coke Company of Chicago and registered several patents for the production of Calcium Carbide. His work was instrumental in the forming of the Union Carbide Corporation of the USA. On 4th October 1892 at Manhattan NY, William Smith Horry married British born Kate Ellis Williams; we assume the couple mostly lived in the USA.\n\nTrade Directories of 1900 and 1904 record Miss Julia Britten having a Girls' School at Gratton House.\n\nSome time later Gratton House reverted to a private dwelling until it was given to the Malvern UDC about 1937 when the buildings on the site were demolished to create a new Bowling Green on the edge of Priory Park (ref 7); see photo below.\n\nFonthill College\n\nFonthill College located in Abbey Road was a small boarding school for young ladies aged between about 11 and 17 years; it was in existence from about 1880 to 1912. The property, now named Salisbury, is shown in the photo opposite.\n\nKelly's Trade Directory of 1876 recorded Fonthill, north of Chatsworth House in Abbey Road as a lodging house run by Ann Grace. Soon after, possibly because of a decline in the water cure, Fonthill became a college for some 20 young ladies. In 1881 the co-proprietors were Miss Ellen Mary Aldis born 1841 Long Melford, Suffolk and Emily Billiter born Clapham about 1847. Ellen Aldis was the daughter of chemist Henry Aldis and Emily was the daughter of corn merchant's clerk Richard Billiter.\n\nOne of the governesses at Fonthill College in 1881 was Selinda Geater. Earlier, in 1871 she had been governess to Herrick Augustus and Dorothy Palmer and their four small children. They lived in Cardiff and he was then Captain and Adjutant of the Glamorgan Militia.\n\nIn 1889 Rev William James Povey acquired the land on the south side of Fonthill College for the purpose of building the present Baptist Church.\n\nThe book 'The Church at the Hay Well', how Baptists came to Malvern, by EKH Jordan, mentions that Fonthill, the property now known as Salisbury in Abbey Road, was considered to be a more eligible site for the new Church, but the committee eventually accepted the recommendation of Malvern Baptist Church to build on the Hay Well Bath site, because no agreement could be reached regarding the Fonthill site - where the girl's school was located.\n\nThe census records that by 1891 Ellen Mary Aldis had moved to become a teacher at Mont Cambrai, Jersey, in the Channel Islands while Emily Billiter had moved to join her sisters as School Principals in Clapham. By 1889, Miss Selinda Ellen Geater seems to have stepped up to become the Principal at Fonthill College assisted by her sisters Susan and Lucy.\n\nThe Geater sisters, born in Leiston, Suffolk, were the daughters of successful tailor Charles Geater and Fanny Munnings Gooch. We were told their story by a family historian (ref 13) who mentioned that the Berrows Worcester Journal of 3rd August 1889 contained an announcement that Fonthill was to be offered for sale. To quote:\n\nThe detached freehold residence known as Fonthill in Great Malvern is for sale by auction on 8 Aug 1889 and is currently in the occupation of the Misses Geater at £120 per annum. It has extensive frontage on to the Abbey Road, Great Malvern. It contains 3 reception rooms, 8 bedrooms, Bath, Box and storerooms, spacious cellarage and excellent Domestic Offices also large Garden, Ornamental Pond, Cottage, Greenhouse and 2-stall Stable. Harness-room and Coach-house.\n\nIt would seem that the property was either not sold or it was bought by the Geater sisters for they were still there in 1891, but by 1901 Fonthill College had moved to St Chad's in Orchard Road where Selinda Geater was still Principal.\n\nPossibly the move to St Chad's had something to do with the noise and upheaval associated with the construction of the Baptist church next door. Apparently establishing a firm foundation for the church proved to be very difficult and costly because of the springs.\n\nChadsmore (shown) appears the twin of St Chads, next door\n\nSt Chad's had been advertised unfurnished 'To Let' in 1888. It had three large reception rooms and nine bedrooms (The Times, 18 Jan 1888).\n\nKelly's Trade Directory recorded auctioneer John Chippendale Gibbs in residence in 1888, while the 1891 census recorded Wheatley Robertson and his family in residence; Colonel Wheatley Robertson, retired Madras Staff Corps, was born in India about 1834 and died in Hampshire in 1910. He had been commissioned Ensign, the 5th Madras Native Infantry, in 1852.\n\nThe National Probate Calendar records that sadly Selinda's sister Lucy Louisa Geater died at Fonthill College on 10th March 1904 aged only 50 years. Her executor was manufacturer's agent Alfred Geater who we think was her married elder brother, a commercial traveller.\n\nSelinda retired not many years after, about 1906, and moved to live with her sister Susan at a house named 'The Willows' in Blofield which lies between Norwich and Great Yarmouth.\n\nDavid Green relates:\n\nThe 1911 census recorded Selinda Geater aged 58, retired principal of a school, living at the seaside town of Lowestoft with her sister Susan, where they were probably on holiday at Willingdon Cottage, Pakefield built about 1907; this was a very small bungalow, on a cliff-top close to the sea. On the census form, Susan had written the bungalow had five rooms, perhaps kitchen, sitting-room and three bedrooms - they must all have been very small! It was said to have been built by the owner of an adjacent large house for the benefit of his guests (ref 42).\n\nSusan died in 1926 and Selinda the next year in 1927; the sisters are buried in Blofield churchyard. The simple inscription on their memorial reads (ref 13),\n\nIn loving memory of\n\nSusan Geater\n\nBorn April 16th 1850\n\nDied July 24th 1926\n\nSelinda Ellen Geater\n\nBorn October 19th 1857\n\nDied December 1st 1927\n\nIn 1911 the Principal at Fonthill College (formerly St Chad's) in Orchard Road was Miss Ada Russell born Ireland about 1873. Kelly's Trade Directories list her as the Principal of Fonthill between 1908 and 1912. Possibly then the lease ran out and the school had to close.\n\nAbbotshill\n\nKelly's Trade Directory of 1924 records Miss Lloyd-Jones at Abbotshill and a Miss Sayle at Cherbourg.\n\nAbbotshill is not shown on the 1884 map of Great Malvern so may have been a later addition at 26 Abbey Road. It was latterly the home of Leontine Elise Lloyd-Jones and her father Ebenezer, retired headmaster of The Priory School, who had died in 1922. Possibly she set up a small school there and employed the younger Miss Sayle at Cherbourg, but we don't know for sure.\n\nSadly her brother Edward Harold Lloyd-Jones, also briefly headmaster at the Priory School, Great Malvern, had died in London in 1912, leaving a widow and two small children.\n\nHer youngest brother Major Percy Arnold Lloyd-Jones had a distinguished military career in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Sadly he died of wounds on 22nd December 1916 in France. He is remembered on the Great Malvern Priory War Memorial, Malvern Remembers website, and at Great Malvern cemetery.\n\nMiss Lloyd-Jones' eldest brother, Ernest, became a medical practitioner in Cambridge, where she herself died in 1955.\n\nPerhaps having no family to pass her school on to, it is possible Miss Lloyd Jones sold her establishment to the younger Miss Sayle who founded Ellerslie.\n\nWellington House\n\nThe 1871 and 1881 census record that Wellington House, number 43 Abbey Road, was for a time a school for young ladies run by Elizabeth Jay and her business partner Joyce Chapman.\n\nPrior to this, in 1861, Elizabeth Jay and Joyce Chapman were running Oakfields Academy for girls at Droitwich Road, Claines, not far from Malvern Link.\n\nJoyce Chapman was born Croydon about 1823\n\nElmsdale and Malvernbury\n\nElmsdale, erected about 1853, and Hardwicke House, which stood next door, were built for Dr James Loftus Marsden to accommodate water cure patients.\n\nCaroline Cooper\n\nJames Loftus Marsden seems to have been away abroad a lot, and we are beginning to wonder how successful his water cure business was, for as early as 1857 Elmsdale was occupied by Miss Caroline Cooper who ran a Ladies' School in Abbey Road, where she is recorded in the 1861 census.\n\nTowards the end of the 1860s Trade Directories suggest the school briefly moved to Holly Mount mansion above the Worcester Road, before moving to another large house named Malvernbury, two doors along from Elmsdale in Abbey Road.\n\nHolly Mount, which had bowed windows providing fine views over the Severn plain, had earlier been rented to the Duchess of Kent and Princes Victoria for 6 weeks when they visited Great Malvern in 1830.\n\nThe 1871 census records Caroline Cooper's school at 'The Bury' or 'Malvernbury' as it was later known. The head teacher in charge on census day was Julia Marten Duplock who in 1861 had been a governess at the school, along with her two sisters Matilda Marten Duplock and Eliza Marten Duplock. On census day Caroline Cooper herself, born Reading about 1822, was a visitor in Somerset, describing herself as Principal of a 1st class school. Also at Malvernbury was Caroline's niece Sarah aged 21 years described as a governess.\n\nLittlebury's Trade Directory of 1873 records Miss Cooper as Principal of a Ladies School at Malvernbury in Abbey Road, where she died on 15th January 1873 (ref 17). The school continued for a short while under the management of the niece Sarah HP Cooper and Julia Duplock until it was bought by Janet Leighton who moved the school to Lawnside. Julia Duplock, formerly of Malvern, died at Petersfield in 1875 aged only 42 years. Sarah Cooper left the school and became a teacher, living to a good age.\n\nPhoto above: 'Elmsdale' in Abbey Road\n\nUnfortunately we do not have a photograph of Malvernbury as it was rebuilt and the present house is now screened by trees and houses.\n\nRachel Rose Gilbert\n\nWe don't know why Caroline Cooper left Elmsdale in the late 1860s, but the 1871 census and Littlebury's Directory and Gazetteer of 1873 record that the house then became another school known as 'The Ladies College' run by Mrs Rachel Rose Gilbert. This school was also listed in the publication 'Schools for Girls and Colleges for Women. A Handbook of Female Education, Chiefly Designed for the Use of Persons of the Upper Middle Class' published by Charles Eyre Pascoe in 1879. The Victorians were obviously very class conscious!\n\nRose the daughter of a teacher and methodist minister had married her brother-in-law schoolmaster George Mowbray Gilbert after her sister Sarah died. In 1851 George Mowbray Gilbert had been running the Goodenough House School (42 boys) at Ealing which had been started by Rev Samuel Goodenough (1743 - 1827) later Bishop of Carlisle. Former pupils of Goodenough House included the prime minister Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth (1757-1844), the diplomat and collector Thomas Bruce, earl of Elgin (1766-1841), the antiquary Barré Charles Roberts (1789-1810) and the soldier Sir Robert Walpole (1808-76)\n\nIn 1861 George and Rose were in Worcester, and in 1871 at Elmsdale in Great Malvern, when she is described as a schoolmistress and he as a fund holder. George died at Elmsdale in 1877, and Rose died there on 5th April 1879, so it would seem the latter school was in existence for no more than ten years. At the time of the 1881 census Elmsdale was uninhabited and presumably advertised to let.\n\nRose's son Walter Raleigh Gilbert was a gifted cricketer and cousin of the cricketer WG Grace. To avoid a scandal involving petty theft, Walter had to emigrate to Canada. Sadly his youngest son 2nd Lt Archibald Holmes Gilbert, 22 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, was a casualty of the Great War and died in Belgium on 21st September 1917. He had transferred to the RFC from the Canadian Infantry.\n\nFanny Elizabeth Ridley\n\nTrade directories indicate that Elmsdale House continued to be used as a private school until at least 1908. In 1888 Fanny E Ridley was the Principal of the school, but it had changed from being a ladies' school to being a preparatory boarding school for young boys.\n\nFanny Ridley was born in Bridgenorth in 1848 the eldest of seven children of whom three died in childhood. Her parents were seed merchant Edward William Ridley and Elizabeth (Lizette) Lander.\n\nIn 1871 Fanny was a governess at a school in Kidderminster run by her Aunt Elizabeth Frances Ridley. Also governesses were Elizabeth's cousins Catherine E Bennett and Dora Townley.\n\nBy 1880, following her father's death, Fanny became Principal of a private boarding school for boys at Needwood House in Kidderminster. Needwood House was purchased for Kidderminster Hospital in the 1930s and converted into a nursing home. In 1881 Fanny's Aunt Elizabeth was still the Principal of Broomfield Hall school for girls in Franche Road, Kidderminster. Broomfield Hall, an imposing mansion, was demolished in the 1960s; a small photo can be found on the Kidderminster Civic Society web site.\n\nAn 1888 Trade Directory and the 1891 and 1901 census record Fanny as the Principal of a private boarding school for boys at Elmsdale House in Great Malvern. She is last listed in a Trade Directory of 1908 when perhaps she decided to retire on reaching the age of 60 years. The 1911 census records her as a retired boarding house keeper staying at Queensborough Terrace in Paddington; she died at Salisbury in 1926.\n\nWe don't know who took over the school from Fanny Ridley, but Pauline Connolly in her book The Water Doctor's Daughters relates an advertisement of 1908:\n\nA Home School for little Boys. Preparatory for the Public Schools and Navy.\n\nEllerslie\n\nEllerslie, at the south end of Abbey Road, became a well known Public School for girls but exists in name only now as a boarding house at Malvern College.\n\nThe school was founded as a private boarding school for girls in 1922, or thereabouts, and remained in existence for 70 years before merging with Malvern College in 1992.\n\nThe photo below taken in March 2015 shows the empty Victorian building as the adjoining science block (left, out of picture) was being demolished in preparation for building a retirement village on the site. The roof of the lodge adjacent to the entrance can just be seen above the shrubbery.\n\nEllerslie House, after the school closed\n\nOn the wall of the lodge was a green plaque placed by Malvern Civic Society in 1992.\n\nIt records that before the school was founded:\n\nEllerslie was the water cure establishment of Doctors Edward and Walter Johnson.\n\nHere Thomas Attwood the Birmingham political reformer died in 1856\n\nThe meaning of the name Ellerslie or Elderslie is obscure, but possibly it refers to 'field of the elder trees'.\n\nFounding of the school\n\nIn 1914 men of Great Britain had been called to arms and soldiers were dying in large numbers. There was little demand for large country houses then and between 1914 and 1917 Ellerslie, which had been advertised to let, lay empty.\n\nAccording to Kelly's Trade Directory of 1917, the first school to be located at Ellerslie was 'North Foreland Ladies School' whose principal, Miss Wolseley Lewis, had started her school in 1909 at North Foreland, a chalky outcrop near Broadstairs. Presumably the school had been evacuated because of the First World War, as afterwards North Foreland Ladies School returned to Kent.\n\nIn 1924 Kelly's Trade Directory recorded another private boarding school for girls at Ellerslie, telephone 201; Ellerslie Lodge was then the school sanatorium. The Principal was Miss Gladys Mabel Pearson Sayle, daughter of an export merchant, born London about 1889. Miss Sayle, who founded the school about 1922, remained Principal until 1957.\n\nA directory of 1964 records that Miss MD Prior, BA Oxon Hons, Geography, was the next headmistress.\n\nThe school had a Christian ethos. Kelly's Trade Directory of 1950 recorded that Revd Canon William Norman Willson was a chaplain to the school. He lived nearby at Beverston on the Wells Road and died in 1956; born 1872, he was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was made a Canon of Salisbury in 1930. A former pupil told us that the chaplain occupied Ellerslie Lodge in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1970s a new science block with study bedrooms above was built on the south side of Ellerslie, which was opened by the education minister, Margaret Thatcher MP, later to become Prime Minister. A stone plaque marked the event. That may have been on 19th March 1971 when Margaret Thatcher gave a short address on the occasion of Ellerslie School's Golden Jubilee, which was reported the next day in the Worcester Evening News.\n\nPreviously pupils had attended science lessons at Malvern College, and in earlier days there had been a chemistry laboratory in the grounds.\n\nThe diagram below, based on the recollections of a former pupil, shows the relative position of the buildings on the main Ellerslie site. In the 1960s the art studio was in an adjacent house named Cherbourg.\n\nPlan of the Ellerslie site\n\nThe photo below shows a line drawing of the north face of Ellerslie made in 2015 when the house was empty awaiting redevelopment.\n\nEllerslie from the Wells Road\n\nBelow the boundary wall there was an assembly hall/chapel which was demolished after the site was sold.\n\nWe have not, as yet, found a history published of the school but this advertisement circa 1955 described it thus:\n\nEllerslie, Great Malvern\n\nRecognised as efficient by the Ministry of Education\n\nBoarding school for girls from 13 years of age with preparatory school for girls from 7 to 13 years of age\n\nPrincipal Miss Sayle\n\nThe school is situated 535 feet above sea level, on the slope of the Malvern Hills.\n\nThe school buildings consist of four houses standing in adjoining grounds of 12 acres in which there are 5 tennis courts, a school chapel, a swimming bath, school hall, a fitted gymnasium, reference library and laboratory. The school has central heating and every modern convenience.\n\nThe high tone in the school is of first consideration. There is a splendid health record and every home comfort is given.\n\nA course of domestic science may be taken in all its branches under a highly qualified mistress; special prospectus available.\n\nGirls may be prepared for the Cambridge General Certificate of Education; London University matriculation and Inter. BA BSc; RAM and RCM school and local centre music examinations; Secretarial Diplomas; Royal Life Saving Society examinations.\n\nThere is a fully qualified staff of 16 highly qualified mistresses including, English, French, Science, Mathematics, Music, Art, Gymnastic, Dancing, Secretarial, and Froebel mistresses and 6 well trained and experienced matrons.\n\nDelicate girls receive special care and are not pressed with their work. All forms of cramming are avoided.\n\nIn the 1960s the school occupied four Victorian houses: Ellerslie, Cherbourg, Southlands, and Hampton House across the road.\n\nThe illustration below shows the rear of the houses known as Cherbourg and Southlands.\n\nCherbourg and Southlands\n\nSouthlands on the Wells Rd, which is next to Emmanuel Chapel on the turning to the Wyche, provided accommodation for the Upper 4th (13 year olds) and Cherbourg (left of image), accommodation for the Lower 5th (14 year olds).\n\nThe two houses were joined together by the school dining room with the music block underneath and overlooking tennis courts below. The views from the dining room windows were said to be 'absolutely spectacular and many wonderful sunsets were seen in the evenings; on bad weather days the houses were often above the clouds'.\n\nEarlier the dining room had been in the basement of Cherbourg.\n\nPrep department\n\nFrom about 1925, Hampton House, on the east side of Abbey Road, was the prep department for younger girls, and provided accommodation for domestic staff in the 1960s.\n\nKelly's Trade Directory of 1958 confirmed Hampton as the preparatory school for Ellerslie.\n\nSee photos of Hampton House below, which were kindly provided by a former pupil of Ellerslie. Note the many chimney's, for coal fires, which have since been removed.\n\nHampton House circa 1965\n\nOn the south side of Hampton House there was an open air swimming pool, with changing rooms on the slope above, see photo below.\n\nThe pool is said to have been filled with soil, after Ellerslie closed.\n\nEllerslie swimming pool next to Hampton House, circa 1965\n\nThere were also tennis courts below Hampton House and a gymnasium built in the grounds named Margaret Prior Hall, after a former headmistress.\n\nA former Ellerslie pupil recalls:\n\nBefore Miss Prior, who was head of Ellerslie when I was there in the 1960s, the school was run by a Miss Sayle and a Miss Scale. They only retired about a year before I went there. My Aunt, Vivian Cooke, taught Art there during WWII before she moved to the Abbey School. She remembered them well; apparently both characters! Ellerslie Lodge was used as a house for our school Chaplain.\n\nDue to dwindling numbers, Ellerslie, which had been elevated to the status of a Girls' Public School, and Hillstone Prep School, from Como Road, merged with Malvern College in 1992 and the Ellerslie 'complex' became a co-educational prep department for Malvern College. Ellerslie eventually moved to new buildings in College Road and in 2009 the prep department moved to the Downs School at Colwall which was started by the Cadbury family, who were Quakers.\n\nThe land and buildings were then sold to Audley Court Ltd who applied for planning permission to develop the site for a large retirement village, which in 2016 was under construction on the site of Ellerslie, Cherbourg and Southlands. These homes appear to be well built but possibly too expensive for many local people to afford.\n\nHampton House was sold on to another developer who has converted Hampton into six apartments, renamed Magnolia House, and is building terraced homes and coach houses in the grounds - the development has been named Bellmere Gardens approached by a new access from College Road.\n\nThe Bellmere Gardens development at Hampton House\n\nIt is believed that, after the sale, a photographic record of the Ellerslie site was made by Malvern Civic Society while the buildings were empty. There were said to have been some fine fireplaces in Ellerslie and Cherbourg which were stolen while the properties were unoccupied. Other photographs dating from 1926 are held by Malvern College and we hope to add some of those to the website shortly.\n\nClick to read our biography of Gladys Sayle, founder of Ellerslie school.\n\nThe Abbey\n\nThe Abbey School for girls (now the site of Abbey College) occupied a large Malvern stone mansion with a prominent clock tower in Malvern Wells and other premises. Recently we were able to discover a lot more about the school after Diana Moores told us her mother was a pupil there in the 1930s.\n\nClick to read The Story of the Abbey School Malvern Wells\n\nBriefly, the school was founded in Blockley, then in Worcestershire, by Mrs Margaret Judson in 1881. Her daughter Florence Judson moved the school to Hazel Bank on the Worcester Road in Malvern Link, and then to The Abbey in Malvern Wells in 1908. The Abbey 'closed' in 1979 after amalgamating with St James in West Malvern. Then St James and the Abbey 'closed' after amalgamating with Malvern Girls College forming Malvern St James, which occupies the site of the old Imperial Hotel in Avenue Road. The site of St James and the Abbey in West Malvern has become the Elim (Pentecostal) International Centre, an evangelical church movement.\n\nIn 1940, Kelly's listed the headmistress as Miss Alice Judson (Florence's younger sister), and in 1950, Miss A F Evershed. We have been told the uniform was grey coats and boaters or grey felt hats; the hat bands were possibly red and white.\n\nThe school magazine was appropriately known as the Hazel Nut.\n\nThorn Bank\n\nKelly's directory of 1940 lists Thorn Bank School for Girls in Malvern Wells, Miss H M Rogers, head mistress. The school is again listed in 1950, but it is believed to have closed soon after due to financial difficulties. Thorn Bank is a large white house on the eastern slope of the Malvern Hills which still exists today.\n\nDaphne who attended the school in 1947 said that she shared a room with two princesses called Alum and Frikata from Ethiopia. 'We wore purple coats, grey tweed tunics, grey stockings and black hats'.\n\nIf you can tell us more about the school, please get in touch.\n\nSeaford Court\n\nSeaford Court prep school for boys was founded in 1901 in the seaside town of Littlehampton, by Mr AC Clarke. The 1939 Register records the school was then in Berry Lane and the headmaster was Eric SR Milton.\n\nEric Sidney Ryland Milton was born in Cape Colony, South Africa, in 1886 and was educated at Brasenose College Oxford. In 1916 he married Doris M L Lowth. The couple had two children Geoffrey and Pamela.\n\nIn 1940 Seaford Court School was evacuated from the coast to Malvern Link and occupied Fern Lodge, 185 Worcester Road, once the home of HFS Morgan, the founder of the Morgan Motor Company. Eric Milton died in 1958 and his son Geoffrey Dennis Leslie Milton, born in 1926, became the next headmaster.\n\nGeoffrey was only 13 years at the start of WWII, but he may have seen some service as on 1st February 1946 aged 20 years Geoffrey was appointed a 2nd Lt in the Lincolnshire Regiment. In 1955 Geoffrey had married Cheri JD Moriarty at Dublin.\n\nAbout 1977 Seaford Court merged with 'The Elms' in Colwall and circa 1980 the site was bought by the NHS with the intent to build a local hospital. However throughout the period when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister there was no money and Seaford Court was left to rot and it became a blot on the landscape.\n\nOn 10th December 2008, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, the derelict building was demolished by Interserve, a Facilities Management business, following which the new Malvern Community Hospital was built and opened in 2011.\n\nInterserve collapsed into administration in March 2019 and was bought by creditors including Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. Ordinary shareholders lost their money. Click to read Guardian report on Interserve.\n\nClick to watch video about the school and the demolition of Seaford Court\n\nGeoffrey Milton, still a relatively young man, then became a farmer and died only recently in 2010.\n\nA former pupil recalls that the masters used to live in Broom Lodge, next to Seaford Court, and that he found the school the best he had been to!\n\nHillside, Malvern Link\n\nHillside was founded by Francis William Quibell Smith and his wife Dorothy F James in the 1950s (ref 5). Latterly including properties next door to Seaford Court on the Worcester Road, it became a very large prep school for day pupils.\n\nAt its peak it was rumoured to have had about 400 pupils.\n\nFW Quibell Smith born 1907 was the son of Reverend Francis Archie Smith, latterly Rector of Brierley Hill, and Mary Louisa Quibell. The 1939 census records him as a Music Master living with his wife and a child in Bromsgrove.\n\nThe Musical Times records he had been Choirmaster and Organist at St Edmunds Dudley, and Music Master at Lichfield Grammar school. He may also have played at Great Malvern priory.\n\nThe first Hillside School was a mixed school taking boys and girls at 171/173 Worcester Road, probably the properties earlier named Inchbrook and Hilton, with Mr and Mrs F W Quibell Smith in charge.\n\nIn about 1961 the Boys School was established lower down at 179 Worcester Road; the property had been earlier named Hazel Bank, a girls' school run by Florence Judson, and later Amestrey boys' prep.\n\nSee Hazel Bank and Amestrey\n\nHillside also incorporated St Cuthbert's next door which had previously been a prep school for boys but, between 1947 and 1959, was a convalescent home annexed to Birmingham Childrens Hospital.\n\nWhen Francis Quibell Smith died on 16th January 1983 his son John took over as headmaster.\n\nHillside closed in 1991 but shortly before that St Cuthbert's was demolished by McCarthy and Stone in order to build Morgan Court which provides sheltered accommodation for the elderly overlooking Malvern Link Common. Perhaps payment of death duties had something to do with that?\n\nHillside, West Malvern\n\nLittlebury's Trade directory of 1873 refers to a much earlier boarding school named Hillside in West Malvern. This Hillside was founded in about 1870 by farmer's son Rev Edward Ford MA, a graduate of St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nHe is first recorded at Hillside in the 1871 census, with his wife Marianne and 9 children aged between 12 years and 6 months.\n\nThe 1881 census recorded in residence, Rev Edward Ford aged 55 years, his wife Marianne and their children; 24 pupils aged between 9 and 14 years; a nurse, cook and 3 housemaids. Next door at Beaulieu were two schoolmasters, two pupils and a page boy/groom. Three of Rev Ford's sons, Edward Wilton, Charles Whitemore, and Ernest Henry were described as schoolmasters so by the 1880s it must truly have become a family business.\n\nOne of the pupils was Herbert Graham Ford, the son of Rev Ford's brother Henry Edmund Ford who in the 1881 census is recorded as Organist at Carlisle Cathedral.\n\nAn advertisement of about that time reads:\n\nHillside school, West Malvern\n\nThe Rev Edward Ford MA, of St John's College Cambridge, assisted by his two Sons and by able Masters, receives BOYS to prepare for the Public Schools, Professions, Universities etc.\n\nHillside School which is most beautifully situated on the western slope of the Malvern Hills, has been established for some years, and has been specially adapted for Pupils, with Large, Well-Ventilated Schoolrooms, Dining-hall, and Dormitories, also with Bathrooms, Large Swimming Bath, Large covered in Playroom and Gymnasium, Large Fives'-court, Carpenters'-room etc. There are also good Cricket and Football Fields.\n\nFRENCH and GERMAN Taught by a Resident French Master, BA of the University of Paris.\n\nOne wonders how Rev Ford found the money to develop these facilities given the school only supported a limited number of pupils.\n\nAbout 1887 Rev Ford became Rector of Exhall with Wixford, possibly leaving one or more of his sons in charge at Hillside, but we speculate the school may have encountered financial problems as by 1891 the headmaster was Walter Churchill Perry aged 42, while only one son, Ernest Henry Ford, is still a schoolmaster.\n\nA Norwich Union fire insurance document suggests by 1896 the following people might be joint owners of the school:\n\nWalter Churchill Perry (the new headmaster)\n\nRev Hildebrand Thomas Giles Alington\n\nWilliam Salter (1863-1948) son of William Charles Salter, last Principal of St Alban Hall Oxford (who would become headmaster)\n\nCharlotte Sophia Isaac, the daughter of a banker in Worcester\n\nBy 1901 William Salter had become headmaster of Hillside; he had been educated at Malvern College in Great Malvern, and Merton College, Oxford.\n\nHis advertisement reads:\n\nHillside, West Malvern\n\nPreparatory for the Public School and Royal Navy\n\nHeadmaster W Salter Esq MA Merton College, Oxford\n\nAssisted by Residential Masters\n\nThe School is beautifully situated on the western slopes of the Malvern Hills 1,000 feet above sea level and commanding extensive views of almost 46 miles. It is sheltered from the east by the range of hills. It is conveniently situated for both Great Malvern and Colwall railway stations.\n\nThe School Buildings include Chapel, Covered Swimming Bath, Gymnasium and Playroom, Covered Fives Court, Carpenters' Shops, Laundry etc. Excellent Cricket and Football Field.\n\nThe regular school course includes Divinity, English subjects viz - History and Geography, Latin, Greek, French, Mathematics etc. Class Singing in the winter.\n\nComplete prospectus will be forwarded on application to the Headmaster\n\nWilliam Salter is not listed at Hillside in Trade Directories after 1908 and by 1911 he is joint headmaster of Eastman's Royal Naval Academy near Winchester.\n\nThe Times records that in 1910 Hillside was put up for sale but there was no buyer.\n\nWe cannot find Hillside in the 1911 census so assume the school may have been empty at the time.\n\nTrade directories record Edward Capel Smith as the next Principal from 1912 to 1921, who had earlier had a school at Fairfield.\n\nEdward Capel Smith (1857 - 1923) born Thruxton Herefordshire was the eldest son of Reverend Edward Br"
