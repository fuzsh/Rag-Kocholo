        "text": "The History of Beckenham\n\nthis page will be regularly updated: latest update July 1st 2020 with some additions and corrections. Missing illustrations are being added. Adapted from the Beckenham Place Park timeline it will become more generalized about Beckenham as it is edited.\n\nSearch; your browser will have a Find function which can be used to search this page for keywords.\n\nWork in progress ©Malvin Mitchell and Keith Baldwin\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction\n\nHistorians and Sources\n\nLandmarks in Beckenham's History\n\nA Fuller History Timeline\n\nContext\n\nPre-History and Medieval Period\n\nThe Estates\n\nThe Manor of Beckenham\n\nThe Manor of Foxgrove\n\nLangley Park and Farm\n\nKelsey\n\nKent House\n\nBeckenham Place Park\n\nBeckenham Rectory\n\nShortlands, Clay Hill, Clayherst (pdf)\n\nJames Scott, Scott's Lane (pdf)\n\nOther Properties\n\nExpanded Timeline: Earliest Records to Present Day\n\n1066 to 1600 Beckenham and some surrounding areas\n\n1601 to 1800\n\n1900 to 2000 Beckenham Place unless otherwise stated\n\nA Brief Timeline\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeckenham has been written about by almost countless historians but this account may reveal hitherto undiscovered aspects and change or challenge parts of some previous accounts. Building on our work related to Beckenham Place we found the impact of events concerning the other parts of Beckenham and nearby parts of Bromley and Lewisham were of particular interest.\n\nFor the earliest events we still rely to varying extents on the work Thomas Philipot, Villare Cantianum 1659. Edward Hasted's History and Topography of Kent 1778 and 1797. And Daniel Lysons Environs of London which certainly provided information, clues and leads. While reciting the work of these writers we also are correcting some of that material and adding information. Some writers have found misconceptions in all of these and we try to clarify any differences with substantiating evidence from various archives. Most writers have taken the main estates and written about them separately but as the evolution of one estate was often affected by overlaps with another I have attempted to merge the accounts into a timeline which enables relating transfers of property from one owner to another and relationships with other events.\n\nI have only recently discovered that it was Thomas Philipot's father, John, who wrote the survey of Kent and that Thomas had it published. They both lived in Eltham and there are charitable almshouses named after Thomas.\n\nPhilipot took the Manor of Beckenham, the Manor of Foxgrove, Langley Park, and finally Kelsey or Kelseys. Hasted repeated the format adding Kent House. Lysons followed this format as well. Later writers such as Roberty Borrowman (1910) and Rob Copeland (1967) added more recent information which Inman, Tonkin, Manning and others continued. Len Hevey filled a gap of early history up to the 14th Century, citing Robert Borrowman as a post 14th C. writer but we question some of Borrowman's material obviously drawn on Hasted etc. Len Hevey focussed on the early history upto the 14th Century, Pat Manning on the Cator family as well as other publications, Copeland Inman Tonkin and others generally worked from Hasted and Lysons with added local records and reminiscences.\n\nThe timeline from the Beckenham Place Park history will form the foundation of this account but more emphasis will be put on other areas until a more comprehensive picture emerges, hopefully. Some caution has to be exercised as Beckenham had several spelling variations and which may apply to other places or people with that or similar name. Another Beckingham is in Yorkshire sometimes spelt Beckyngham. Other names are prone to spelling variations and alliases such as Brun/Brune/Bruyn and Rochelle/Rokele/Rokeley.\n\nResearch into the various people mentioned does reveal some interesting stories of intrigue which would be too lengthy to fully repeat here. A note on inernet searching, we find that 'googling' doesn't always return a result and you have to go to various archive catalogues. Although several archives have been searched this is not exhaustive as each person or place name would have to be searched in every archive.\n\nThe Historians and Sources\n\nThe previous writers include:\n\nJohn Philipot author, published by Thomas Philipot 1659 History of Kent Villare Cantianum.\n\nEdward Hasted 1778 1st edition Topography and History of Kent and 2nd edition in 1797/99,\n\nDaniel Lysons 1796 Environs of London,\n\nW.H.Ireland 1828 A New and Complete History of Kent,\n\nRobert Borrowmans 1910 Beckenham Past and Present,\n\nRob Copeland 1967 Manors of Beckenham and other publications,\n\nNancy Tonkin and Eric Inmans Beckenham circa 1990,\n\nLen Hevey 1994 \"The Early History of Beckenham\" (from the Iron Age to 14th C.). Also, A History of Shortlands and History of Elmers End.\n\nEric Inmans 1995 series of articles on the History of Beckenham Place Park written for the Friends of Beckenham Place Park, and \"Beckenham\" co-written with Nancy Tonkin\n\nPat Manning 2000 Cators of Beckenham and Woodbastwick and other publications on Rivers, Churchyard memorials, etc.,\n\nSome if not all of these writers drew, as we do, on the works of their predecessors and contemporaries. Hasted refers to Philipott, Lysons to Hasted, etc. Sometimes fiction is written as fact such as we believe some assumptions referred to later in this account. But I also indulge in a few speculative scenarios based on available evidence. However, some discoveries and corrections by one writer did not get picked up in other contemporary or later publications.\n\nSome material in Bromley Historic Collections and county archives was at some time derived from other archives such as the British Library. Our rediscovery of some of this material has contributed toward our reassessments of the various aspects of Beckenham's History. Although some of the above writers knew of this material they may not have been so focussed on specific areas or timeslots in order to analyse the content. The archive catalogues searched include: The British Library, The National Archive, National Library of Scotland (maps), Bromley Historic Collections, Surrey Archive, West Sussex Archive. Some archives do not have an online catalogue i.e. Lewisham, Lincolnshire, etc. where we know some records are stored.\n\nRecently (May,2020) we have acquired a copy of Len Hevey's Early History of Beckenham which confirms some of our findings from independant research and also contains additional material which will incorporate into the timeline\n\nThe Internet has also revealed sources as books become available in e-book form and various archives become electronically indexed. Google books and other versions include: Philipotts, Hasteds, Lysons, and Irelands histories, Collinsons letters, Memorial of Humphrey Marshall and John Bartram, Life of Dr. Johnson, Hester Thrale, Lady DArblay, Memoirs of George IV and Memoirs of William IV, etc. Beckenham History and Bromley Borough Local History Society websites contain material. Some of this we would question but for the most part it contributes valuable information and personal recollections.\n\nWe aim to represent as accurately as possible the evolution of the town of Beckenham and its environs. Dated estate plans in the British Library, Kent Archive and Bromley Historic Collections have enabled the analysis of landholdings by landlords at specific dates. This has allowed for discovering detail which is not in the earlier written records. I doubt we will be able to relate everything in a fully comprehendable manner as the chain of events and occupation is not complete. Just as today it would be difficult to relate all transfers of property it is even more difficult from old archives. The small windows we have on the past add some colour to events.\n\nI certainly started by accepting the previous accounts of others, but where prior information is proved to be wrong or doubtful we draw attention to it here.

Here we focus first on the places and then the people who passed through. The deeper we delve into detail then the more complex it becomes so some generalisations will be inevitable. Previous writers have tended to write about the main estates: Manor of Beckenham, Manor of Foxgrove, Langley estate and Kelsey estate. Then some histories consist of personal reminiscencies. Not much is known of events the further back we go but some individuals had connections with national events. If these are relevant I will include them. We have delved into various archives via online catalogues but only scratched the surface in many respects. But this has added some substance to the account. Various errors and potential errors have been found in most accounts and If any are noticed in this please bring it to our attention.\n\nContext\n\nThis account may focus largely on the early history of Beckenham which is more of a mystery. The later and recent history has probably been adequately covered in various publications, not least those of Rob Copeland, Patricia Manning, Eric Inman et al.\n\nMaybe Beckenham has always been a bit of a backwater as it isn't on a major road to anywhere and this might have retarded its urbanization for longer than nearby places on major roads.\n\nThe A21 and A22 byepass it and radial routes such as the South Circular and A232 pass north and south of it. A Roman road which is said to have passed through the area has not survived as a noticeable local road.\n\nHowever some notable personages resided in and around Beckenham from Lords Mayor of London, Aldermen, Large Landowners and Knights or Peers of the Realm.\n\nThere were a few large landowners with tenant farmers and workers, also, some smallholdings and private houses, some of which were described as mansions or great houses. With a small population recorded as 1,000 in 1801 which rose to 26,000 in 1901 development was slow. The large landowners were either long term family inheritors or people who had purchased estates as a means of banking their wealth. However, the estates did change hands fairly regularly and the landowners names are also associated with estates elsewhere so Beckenham was not by any means a sole family seat for many or even any. The long term landowners included the Leighs of Addington who inherited Foxgrove Manor, the St. Johns/Lords Bolingbrokes of Beckenham Manor whos main base was in Battersea, the Brograves of Kelsey and the Styles of Langley. The Burrells arrived in the late 17th Century and the Raymonds in 1732. Wealth accumulated from business was often invested in land purchase which in turn generated rents and other income. The Cators made their presence felt from the mid 18th C and other names of note were Lethieullier, Brett, Motley, Austin, Hoare, Eden. Some family lines died out or merged with other families via female heirs and widows. In the medieval period widows could not hold property and they were 'married off' tosuitors often chosen by the monarch. This may have been the case with Alice le Brun who was matched with Robert de Marny. Heirs who had not reached their majority would be placed under guardianship as with Ingram or Ingelram Brun.\n\nOften the absence of an heir led to sale of estates as with the Styles of Langley whose female heiress married into the Elwills who then sold to Hugh Raymond, or heirs favoured other places and sold their Beckenham property as with Frederick St. John/Lord Bolingbroke in 1773 and the Burrells in 1820 after the death of Peter Burrell/Baron Gwydir, and the Cators gradually from about 1808. More than one landlord needed to sell estates to pay off debts as with the heirs of Francis Leigh of Hawley who owned Foxgrove at his death. The histories written by Thomas Philipot (1659) and Edward Hasted (1778 and 1797) relate the chain of exchange of ownership but these also miss some fine detail. Other significant landowners were the Tolsons, Motleys, Austins, Pughs, Willis, Humphrey and Lethieulliers. Maps and land deeds discovered show the patchwork of fields and estates with ownership almost jumbled in some cases. Large estates were divided into farms with for example Langley being divided into 4 or 5 farms with all but one being leased to tenants. In 1737 Thayers Farm and Elmers End Old and New Farms were owned by Thomas Motley who also owned a fine house and grounds in Beckenham village. Around this time the Lethieulliers owned Kent House Farm and the site of Clockhouse. A few generations later and the land was either left or sold to others.\n\nWe find common links with the South Sea Company or East India Company, sometimes both. These were sources of income and wielded significant power. Often the landowners were members of parliament not necessarily for Beckenham but for other areas ie the Burrells for Haslemere and Boston and Cator for Wallingford and Stockbridge. Being a member of parliament and a member of the South Sea or East India Company enabled them to influence decisions in favour of their interests. Some smaller land or property owners had businesses such as Dying and Tanning in London or Southwark, just as the Cators would start with a timber business. It is surprising how many landowners were in the legal profession and held administrative posts from Sherrif to Justice of the Peace. In the medieval period several knights were close to the crown from whom they derived their property and power.\n\nEach century had its periods of turmoil both domestically and internationally which often impacted local affairs from the Wars of the Roses, The English Civil War, the Great Plague, the Restoration of the Monarchy, wars between Britain and France, such as the War of the Spanish Succession, The 7 Years War, The war of American Independence and the later Napoleonic Wars. The social conditions bordered on the barbaric both domestically and internationally. Felons could be transported to the Americas up to the time of the American Revolution and to Australia thereafter or hung for quite minor offences. The working class, poor and slaves were all treated harshly. Felons could be transported into slavery and apprentices were indentured for 7 or more years into a situation of ownership by their masters. The two World Wars affected the population with the loss of life among soldiers in the First World War, and both soldiers and civilians in the Second World War. In WW1 several buildings were used by the military and in WWII bomb damage was significant in the Borough and at least 2 POW camps were established which themselves narrowly missed being hit by bombs.\n\nReligion has not left any visible signs of turmoil although the parish church would have been Catholic prior to Henry VIII's split from Rome. Though some claims have been made that dissenters such as the Cators as Quakers suffered persecution, that persecution often was only in the form of fines for not attending the recognized Church of England or for not paying tythes or taxes and it seems that the nonconformists could in most cases afford the fines levied upon them.\n\nThe Law played its part in various land processes as the Court of Chancery commonly has records of disputes and settlements regarding Beckenham properties. Some comparisons brought up by this account show that Bolingbroke entered into a subterfuge with Cator amounting to thousands of pounds with no penalty whereas someone stealing a couple of window frames was transported for 7 years and others sentenced to death for theft of low value goods. Earlier in 1720 several notable persons committed large frauds and embezzlements under the South Sea Bubble affair and in most cases quite minor financial penalties were applied.\n\nBeckenham was one of many places easily in reach of London but away from the pollution and dirt of the City and hence a place to have a country house. Admiral Sir Piercy Brett moved into Clockhouse in the mid 18th Century and John Cators brother Joseph moved in after Bretts death in 1882. The village had large houses such as The Mead, The Ridge, Beckenham Lodge, The Manor House and a substantial Rectory. The mid to late 19th century saw the building of large villas with coach houses and stables.\n\nFrederick St. John (Lord Bolingbroke) had married Diana Spencer but his debts and subsequent broken marriage led him to dispose of estates in Battersea and Beckenham.\n\nInvesting money in a landed estate which brought in rents from tenant farmers and house rents was akin to buy to let as it is carried on today. Even the middle class and aristocracy often rented property as opposed to buying it. Many documents relate to leases of property although in isolation they may be seen as transfers one release of property is later reversed by a return of the property to the original holder. For example the Bruyns Beckenham Manor fell under the influence of Robert de Marny as he married the widowed Alice Bruyn, then it was transferred to the local rector or clergyman, Martham, only to be returned to the Bruyns under Ingram Bruyn. The reasons for these transfers is mostly unknown but basically financial.\n\nFor some background I would recommend London Life in the Eighteenth Century by M.Dorothy George, which is probably out of print, as being well researched and probably used since as source material by other authors.\n\nPre-history to the Medieval Period\n\nEvidence in the landscape shows that geologically the area was under a shallow sea 54 million years ago in the Eocene period as in some areas the Blackheath Beds or Harwich Formation of shingle emerge through the London Clay. In one area of Beckenham Place Park there is an exposed conglomerate (concretion) of the Blackheath Beds which is shingle cemented together with lime and sand. In other areas the London Clay is on the surface covered with a thin layer of topsoil being leaf mould, loam or silt deposits. Some valleys have accumulations of silts forming meads and meadows. The geology would affect the later use of the land and economy. Clay soil has always been difficult to work for crops so often left for grazing or woodland. Valley silts and loams were probably favoured for arable farming. Locally there have been brick fields utilising clay and sand, gravel pits and lime kilns all using the natural resources laid down geologically. The nature of the ground would affect the economy as some land was poor for agriculture such as Penge Common. Clay areas and woodland were a major source of fuel and building material. There are a few references to lime kilns which would need both chalk and woodland fuel for the improvement of soil. At least one lease agreement requires the lessee to manure and lime the land regularly. One landowner is recorded as providing timber for naval dockyards circa 1680. The Chalk is mostly several metres below the surface but the existence of lime kiln fields indicates that some chalk was available, maybe coming from the Chislehurst Caves or similar places where chalk is nearer the surface.\n\nDuring the Mesolithic, Bronze and Iron ages there was probably occupation as although not much by way of definite remains but some have been found. There are hill forts and earthworks within walking distance at Keston, Halsted and Westerham, also some mention of flint tools found near West Wickham. An overview of this period can be drawn from Len Hevey's \"Early History of Beckenham\".\n\nDuring the Roman occupation of Britain a road passed through the Beckenham area en route from Lewes in Sussex to Londinium. Though no hard evidence has been found in the park or close by it is projected by some experts that the road cut across the corner of Beckenham Place Park near the Foxgrove Road Lodge at the junction of Foxgrove Road and Southend Road. Different projections for the route of the road exist and as Beckenham has been redeveloped several times I would have thought more evidence would have surfaced, literally. Also, althought the road deviated to cross the north downs it is projected to have gone straight up Spring Park at West Wickham which would have been a challenge for loaded horse drawn carts of Roman goods. The suggested area is now outside the public park and under an area of private housing. Roman remains exist not far away at Keston, Titsey and Orpington. In the area where the roman road is projected to have crossed the park before the park was established there was a quarry or gravel pit and a lane called Limekiln Lane maybe indicating that there were lime rich deposits or chalk here. Whether these were part of the Blackheath Bed conglomerate or underlying Chalk near the surface we cannot say. Im told the chalk would be about 100 feet/30metres below the surface. As much of Beckenham has been redeveloped more than once it is curious that no historic remains have been found. The Roman road structure was said to have been mainly gravel and as the area is largely of gravel composition then over time the road may have fallen into disrepair, the course became obscured and diversions created around areas which may have become impassable. Also we have to consider the local waterways, although not considerable, would have required crossing with bridges or fords and this may have caused the road to deviate from the accepted Roman practice of building straight roads wherever practical. One source suggests the road crossed what is now Langley Park Golf course and may have gone through Kelsey Park. Some local roads though not straight do approximately follow these lines. Various landlords had roads diverted around their estates and the various stages of settlement and farming could have erased or buried many features. The course of the road is plain to see through Edenbridge and several other places but does not seem to have survived in any form through Beckenham.\n\nUnfortunately, very little survives locally of any Ango-Saxon, Medieval, Tudor etc. One of the oldest structures is the lych gate of the church and thats a bit like Triggers broom, 3 new heads and 2 new handles! It is said that parts of the Old Manor house survive in the facade and interior of the building there opposite the church which is now a restaurant. Even the church was rebuilt in the Victorian period after fire damaged the previous medieval incarnation but some old memorials remain. The Alms houses next to the church and the George Inn are dated to the 17th century. The Anglo-Saxon administration survives in the old maps as the Park is in the Hundred of Bromley and Beckenham which is in the bailiwick or Lathe of Sutton at Hone. We do have recourse to documentary evidence about Beckenham and surrounding areas in various archives certainly from the Domesday entry and documents related to land transfers and taxation. These will be inserted into the timeline where available or discovered. Thanks to Keith Baldwin for diligent research here.The Black Death introduced the bubonic plague here in the 14th Century and fairly regular outbreaks occurred which impacted the population. Other diseases such as smallpox, diptheria, measles etc were also serious and these kept the population in check regardless of wealth.\n\nThe works of Thomas Philipot and Edward Hasted revealed an ever changing web of ownership, intermarriage, selling and transfer of properties all over Kent. In some cases estates were handed out by the Crown only to be seized again when some misdemeanour took place e.g. The Boleyns having Hever confiscated by Henry VIII after Anne Boleyns alleged adultery. And later, The St. Johns had a chequered history, with one being excluded from Parliament on the Restoration of Charles II, Another being convicted of murder but a pardon purchased from the Crown, Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke may or may not have been a landlord of Beckenham Manor, but he was attained for treason for supporting the Jacobites, exiled in France for some time and subsequently had his properties and titles restored to him which some might say was lucky for him. He however died without issue. Frederick St. John who sold the Manor of Beckenham lands to John Cator had a failed marriage with Diana Spencer and seems to have dissipated the St.John estates almost single handedly. The manors and estates around Beckenham had complex histories which is explained in the following timeline.\n\nThe Reverend William Rose had a Georgian rectory built to an Adam Brother's design but that gave way to a town hall and now a branch of Marks and Spencer and its car park which cover the site. He also had designed if not built a sumptuous stables as he appears to have been a keen horseman at a time when horses were the equivalent of fast cars.\n\nPerhaps the George public house in the high street is the oldest most complete structure locally and that passed through the hands of the Cator Estate and is listed in the 1825 Act properties along with the Crooked Billet in Penge.\n\nThose are some of the unknowns which await discovery of firm evidence.\n\nThe Estates\n\nEarly writers recorded Beckenham by referring to its major landowners and estates divided into Beckenham Manor, Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley. Kent House Farm was recorded by at least one writer. If one takes the names of the landlords and searches for instance Philipot or Hasted's accounts we find that most landlords held divers properties often in several counties. Also, Philipot and Hasted as well as contemporaries and later writers were almost producing directories of landlords, their estates, lineages and locations. Along with the maps of Rocque and Andrews, Drury, Herbert these formed a who's who of Kent. I'll quote Philipot's and Hasted's passages but then I'll divide them into their relevant timeslots on the timeline. Hopefully this will put things into context and demonstrate which events were contemporary with one another. It will also correct or dispute some of their statements based on rediscovered evidence and the substantiated accounts by others. Along the way we see several Court of Chancery cases dealing with property issues which arose through inheritance, sales and the contesting of wills. We have added whatever documents we can find acknowledging the work of divers people who have transcribed documents, produced indexes and directories over the years and the subsequent transferring of data onto the internet. Some documents confuse matters as they imply land was transferred permanently but is subsequently returned to or reclaimed by the original owner rendering the document as a lease rather than a freehold transfer. As all property was held by grant from the crown then in some cases reclamation by the crown deprived the landlord of ownership.\n\nApart from these major estates the other properties varied in size sometimes being swallowed up by the larger landlords. It bears repeating that the landholdings were interwoven by complex ownership of sometimes individual fields quite distant from the landlords base. Apart from a few insights we can't fully trace the occupancy of land as many landlords had tenants to manage farms. A map of Langley circa 1740-50 records some tenants and surrounding landowners and an estate book of 1809 of the Burrell etates shows leased occupancy. Material exists for the Cator estate circa 1860 through maps and records. Probably the full picture would hold so much munitiae as to be uninteresting but we will try to show a more comprehensive picture than hitherto published.\n\nDickens probably got his Jarndice versus Jarndice idea from some of these events in the same way that Jane Austen used her experiences of her extended family for her novels.\n\nSeveral references have been dated by translating the Regnal Year ie '18 Edward II' is 1324. Edward II reigned from 1307-1327, 1307 is year 1.\n\nThe Manor of Beckenham\n\nThis Manor has a complicated history because of its transfers of ownership and division into two moieties or parts under the two Bruyn daughters and a subsequent rejoining by purchases of the St.Johns circa1635-1650. Philipot even indicates that one moiety was divided further between Henry Parke and Ralph Warren but that is assumed by Lysons to be related to loans or morgages. A comparison of Philipot, Hasted and Lysons reveals several differences and some modern day sources also bring some of their details into question ie Isolde (Rokele) is now thought to be of unknown family and Maude de Rokele is the probable heiress who brought the Beckenham Manor into the Bruyn/Brun family. The Manor lands were also spread and divided geographically from near Beckenham Parish Church St. George's up to Rockhills which is now Crystal Palace Parade with other isolated fields and messuages. As Kelsey is thought to emerge as land acquired from the Bruyns it is certainly possible that Kelsey was once part of Beckenham Manor as it lies between the two parts or moieties and other dismembered parts of Beckenham Manor. The Manor does not appear to be a primary residence of any of its landlords, probably being leased or let for much of its existence. The Bruyn's apparently favoured Essex, The St.Johns based in Battersea, maybe members of the extended families resided at Beckenham? Certainly most of the landlords had other residences.We are also dependant upon the translations from Latin of early documents. Research is revealing that the descent of the manor via the Bruyns was complex and involved with several other manors in Essex, Hampshire and elsewhere. Although Beckenham Manor may not have featured very highly in state affairs it was connected with several events through its owners. Various disputes about ownership drew in several families. de Marny more or less seized ownership from the Bruyns after marrying the widow on one Maurice Bruyn and later William Brandon did the same after marrying Elizabeth, one of the daughters of Henry Bruyn. Some of these protagonists were close to the crown and held hight positions. Sometimes falling foul of the crown and being attained for treason as with William Brandon under Richard III and Walter St.John under William and Mary.\n\nPhilipott says: (dates inserted might be a year difference)\n\nBekenham near Bromley helps to give Name to the Hundred wherein it is placed, and of old time was held by Gentlemen, called in Latine Records de Rupella, in French de la Rochel, and in English Rokeley, and were in their original Etymologie extracted from Rochel in France, Richard de Rokeley died seised of this Mannor, in the fifth year of Edward the first,(1276) and was succeeded in the Possession by Philip de la Rokeley, and he held it likewise at his Death, which hapened in the 23 year of Edw. the first,(1295) and left it to his Sole Daughter and Heir Isolda de la Rokeley matched to William Bruin, by whom She had Issue Sir Maurice Bruin, Chamberlaine to K. Edw. the third, honoured with the Summons to Parliament as Baron amongst the Peers of this Realm, who by a Right derived to him from his Mother, was possest of this at his Death, in the twenty ninth of Edward the third,(1356) and transmitted a wide and spreading Revenue to his Posterity here, at Southokenden in Essex, and at Roumere in Hantshire, which last was given in Appendage to a younger Son, from whom the Bruins of Athelhampton in the County of Dorset, are lineally de∣scended. But when after a fair continuance this Family had flourished at this Place, the Distaffe prevailed against the Speare, and Sir Henry Bruins two Daughters and Coheirs about the Beginning of Edward the fourth (1461), divided his Inheritance, each of them having a first and second Husband: Alice the eldest was first married to Robert Harleston of Essex Esquire, and after to Sir Thomas Heveningham; and Elizabeth second Daughter was wedded first to Thomas Tirrell of Heron in Essex Esquire, and after his Decease to Sir William Brandon Knight, who was Standard-bearer to Henry the seventh at Bosworth Field,(1485) where he was slain in asserting his Cause and Quarrel against Richard the third, and he had Issue by her Sir Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk (1484), the Flower and perfection of English Chivalrie in his Time, who sometimes kept his Residence at this place, (not as Proprietarie, but onely as Lessee, for the Sole Inheritance upon the Division of Bruin's Estate accrued to Tirrell;) and here entertained Henry the eighth, with all the Cunning Pompe of Magnificence, as he went to bestow a Visit at Hever, on his discarded, and repudiated wife Ann of Cleve (1540-45). But to go on, this Mannor as I said before, being annexed to the patrimony of Thomas Tirrell, Humphrey Tirrell his Grandchild to whom it descended, passed away one Moietie of it in the thirty fifth year of Henry the eighth (1543) to Ralph Warren, and the other to Henry Parke; Warren alienated his Proportion not long after to Bradbury, from which Family about the latter End of Q. Eliz.(1603) it came over by Sale to Serjeant Gent, who gave it in Dower with his Daughter to Sir George Dalston of Cumberland,(married 11 Feb. 1605, Catherine (bur. 22 July 1614), da. of John Tamworth of Halsted, Leics.) (History of Parliament online) who in our Memory conveyed it to Sir Patrick Curwin of the same County, and he some few years since sold his Interest in it to Sir Oliver St. John of Batricksey in Surrey,(abt 1635) who upon his Decease (1639) gave it to his Son then Mr. Walter, but now upon the Death of his Nephew (1657), Sir Walter St. John Baronet, the other Moitie by Joan sole Heir of the abovesaid Henry Parke, came to be the Inheritance of Mr. Robert Leigh descended out of Cheshire, whose Successor about the latter End of King James (1625) alienated it to Sir Henry Snelgrave, from whom it descended to his Grandchild Mr. Henry Snelgrave, who not long since passed it away (1648 to the Evelyn brothers then in 1651) to Mr. Walter, now Sir Walter St. John Baronet, who lately hath exchanged the whole Mannor, for other Land with his Brother Mr. Henry St. John.\n\nWhat can we add?\n\nHasted's account differs in several aspects maybe extending and correcting Philipot? It can be found at https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol1/pp527-550\n\nThe situation surrounding the division of the manor requires some explanation not least in which parts were the manor divided. One record describes the widow of Bruyn holding one third of the manor which may then have been divided between the two daughters. Philipot describes the two Bruyn daughters as having two husbands each while Hasted describes three each. Other writers put the husbands in different orders. Philipot describes Dalston marrying a daughter of Sergeant Gent whereas Hasted and History of Parliarment state he married a daughter or sister of Thomas Tyrrel/Tirrel. In 1639 Henry Snellgrave died in Beckenham and is buried in St. George's. His will mentions several properties\n\nIn 1648 and 1651 There are records in Surrey Archive for transfers of money and property between Henry Snellgrave (Grandson of Sir Henry) and Richard, George and John Evelyn the famous diarist. The Evelyns subsequently sold this part in 1750to two St. John brothers Walter and Henry. Sir Oliver St. John's part was left to his son, John who died young and it became the property of Walter St. John his uncle who also aquired the baronet title. It descended to Frederick St. John who exchanged the manor house and Court Downs for Woolseys Farm with Peter Burrell in 1757 and sold the rest to John Cator in 1773, but that is a simplification of events which will be explained in the timeline. The map of 1623 copied in 1768 is the best illustration we have of the complexity of the Beckenham Manor properties.\n\nThere is certainly more to discover or explain.\n\nAnd Lysons writes \"\n\nThe manor of Beckenham was held of King Edward the Consessor, by Anschil. When the survey of Doomsday was taken, Ansgot, of Rochester, held it under Odo, Bishop of Baieux. Richard de la Rokele died seised of it in 1276. His son Philip left a daughter and sole heir, Isolda, married to Sir William Bruyn; from whom this manor descended to Sir Henry Bruyn, who died in 1461, leaving two daughters, coheirs (fn. 5). Alice the eldest had, by her first husband John Berners, Esq. a son, who died without issue; upon which, a moiety of this manor was inherited by John Harlefton, son of her second husband. Clement Harleston sold it, in 1530, to Robert Legh, Esq. (fn. 7), whose descendant of the same name, in 1610, aliened it to Henry Snelgar, or Snelgrave, Esq. (fn. 8) (afterwards knighted). About the year 1650, it was sold, by his grandson Henry Snelgrave, Esq. to Walter St. John, Esq. (fn. 9), in whose family the manor became again united.Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Henry Bruyn, married, to her first husband (fn. 10), Thomas Tyrrell, Esq. whose descendants inherited the other moiety of this manor; one of them, whose name also was Thomas, left a daughter and sole heir, married to Sir John Dalston, by whom she had two daughters. Catherine, one of these coheirs, married Sir Henry Curwen (fn. 11). About the year 1650, Sir Patrick Curwen, his son, sold a moiety of the manor of Beckenham to Oliver St. John, Esq. (fn. 12); from whom it came to Sir Walter St. John, Bart. already possessed of the other moiety. The manor, thus united, continued in the St. John family till the year 1773, when Frederick, the late Viscount Bolingbroke, sold it to John Cator, Esq. (fn. 13), the present proprietor, who resides in an elegant mansion, which he built soon after his purchase of the estate, and called Beckenham-place. It stands on an eminence, and commands a beautiful, though not a very extensive prospect.\"\n\nBut the jury remains 'out' on these early assessments as the 'de la Rokeles', Rokell or Rokeleys are thought to have descended via Maud de la Rokeley/Rokele married to Sir Maurice le Brun/le Brune/Bruyn. Isolde was married to Maurice's father William le Brun and no one knows her family name but she is described as of the 'House of Queen Eleanor' as a Maid of Honour (source: Sir John Maclean 1876). Another name attributed to Philip de la Rokele is Philip de Rupellis. As well as the manor of Beckenham, Matilda carried the manor of Okendon in Essex to the Brun family. The biography of Maurice le Brune would indicate very little direct contact with Beckenham except as landlord so leases and tenants would be of more interest. Manors with alternative names such as Wokyndon Rokell or South Wokyndon are mentioned and Hasted connects Rokele with several Kent manors.\n\nLater we find that Maurice le Bruyn married to Alice le Lacer assigned his property to Robert de Marney, de Marney later married Alice when she was widowed and de Marney had a reputation for riding rough shod over anyone connected with him. See History of Parliament for his entry which describes his ruthless nature. But Beckenham Manor and other land return to Ingram Bruyn and his heirs circa 1400.\n\nWe take issue with several details of both Philipot and Hasted such as the omission of the manor passing through the hands of the Evelyns although briefly and detail about Cator's aquisition is wrong in several respects.\n\nLysons in his Environs of London in a very brief summary states:\n\nThe manor of Beckenham was held of King Edward the Confessor, by Anschil. When the survey of Doomsday was taken (fn. 1), Ansgot, of Rochester, held it under Odo, Bishop of Baieux. Richard de la Rokele died seised of it in 1276 (fn. 2). His son Philip left a daughter and sole heir, Isolda (fn. 3), married to Sir William Bruyn; from whom this manor descended (fn. 4) to Sir Henry Bruyn, who died in 1461, leaving two daughters, coheirs (fn. 5). Alice the eldest had, by her first husband John Berners, Esq. a son, who died without issue; upon which, a moiety of this manor was inherited by John Harlefton, son of her second husband (fn. 6). Clement Harleston sold it, in 1530, to Robert Legh, Esq. (fn. 7), whose descendant of the same name, in 1610, aliened it to Henry Snelgar, or Snelgrave, Esq. (fn. 8) (afterwards knighted). About the year 1650, it was sold, by his grandson Henry Snelgrave, Esq. to Walter St. John, Esq. (fn. 9), in whose family the manor became again united.Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Henry Bruyn, married, to her first husband (fn. 10), Thomas Tyrrell, Esq. whose descendants inherited the other moiety of this manor; one of them, whose name also was Thomas, left a daughter and sole heir, married to Sir John Dalston, by whom she had two daughters. Catherine, one of these coheirs, married Sir Henry Curwen (fn. 11). About the year 1650, Sir Patrick Curwen, his son, sold a moiety of the manor of Beckenham to Oliver St. John, Esq. (fn. 12); from whom it came to Sir Walter St. John, Bart. already possessed of the other moiety. The manor, thus united, continued in the St. John family till the year 1773, when Frederick, the late Viscount Bolingbroke, sold it to John Cator, Esq. (fn. 13), the present proprietor, who resides in an elegant mansion, which he built soon after his purchase of the estate, and called Beckenham-place. It stands on an eminence, and commands a beautiful, though not a very extensive prospect.\n\nAnd from this we can find Robert Leigh the elder dying in 1567 and buried at St.George's Beckenham and trace his descendants through Nicholas Leigh to the next Robert Leigh. Some dates by Lyson are estimates. some information incorrect from other sources and we have found more accurate and supplementary information in the timeline.\n\nThe Manor of Foxgrove\n\nHere follows Philipotts account with original spellings (f for s etc.). He starts with a reference to John de Foxgrove about 1347. The Lay Subsidy Roll of land taxation for 1334 shows a John Foxsegrove under the Lathe of Eyllesford (Aylesford) but not the Hundred of Beckenham. Whether even at that time Foxgrove was under absentee landlords has not as yet been established but we find an earlier reference to Foxgrove in the Kent Roll for 1274 and a jury witness also named John of Foxgrove who may have been the father of the 1347 'John de Foxgrove' given the time between the two? I have inserted dates in the following based on Philipotts timeline references to monarchs. Like all the manors and estates of Beckenham Foxgrove was widely spread and divided, centred upon Foxgrove Manor farmhouse but reaching beyond Kelsey and Langley to West Wickham, almost to Southend, Lewisham with parts at Plaistow, Bromley. The reference to Burghersh we find says 'held of Thomas Bardolf' implying that Bardolf was the higher possessor and leased the property to Burghersh? I have not been able to confirm the connection to Vaux, sometimes spelt Vaus.\n\nFoxgrove is the last place of Account in this Parish, it had in elder times Proprietaries of this Sirname; for I find John de Foxgrove paid respective Aid for it in the twentieth year of Edward the third (1347), at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family succeeded Bartholomew Lord Burwash, and he held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty ninth year of Edward the third (1356). and from him it descended to his Son Bartholomew Lord Burwash, who in the forty third year of the abovesaid Prince (1370), passed it away to Sir Walter de Paveley, and in his Family it remained untill the latter End of Richard the second, (1399) and then it was conveyed to Vaux of the County of North-Hampton, and there made its abode untill the latter End of Henry the sixth (1461), and then it was alienated to John Grene Esquire, and he died possest of it in fourth year of Edward the fourth (1465); and in this Family did the Title reside, untill the Beginning of Henry the eighth (1509), and then it was demised to Beversea, and Humphrey Beversea, I find held it in the eighteenth year of Henry the eighth (1527), and his Descendant passed it away to Luke Hollingworth, and he about the Beginning of K. Edward the sixth (1547), sold his Interest in it to Alderman Sir Jo. Oliff of London, and he dying (1577) without Issue Male, Joan(his daughter) matched (1563)to John Leigh of Addington Esquire, was his sole Heir (1577), and in Right of this Alliance, did it come down to Sir Francis Leigh (d.1644) late of East-Wickham; whose Widow Dowager the Lady Christian Leigh, is now in Possession of it.(1659 she died in 1660) .end of quote.\n\nSubsequent to this, as Hasted recounts, Francis Leigh 1651-1711 directed that Foxgrove and other land at Plaistow be sold by his Will. Hence, John Tolson bought the land, and it descended by complicated means to his nephew, Lancelot Tolson Tilly. But we find Hasted's account to be either inaccurate or too brief. The will of Francis Leigh and subsequent events arrive at a different conclusion.\n\nWhat further detail can we add? Foxgrove probably existed before John de Foxegrave and whether it derived its name from a person or John derived his name from the manor is debatable. The references that exist mentioning John de Foxegrave start in 1274 before Philipot's reference as a witness in the Kent Rolls and the name is also mentioned connected with Aylesford in the Hundred of Ruxley in the Lay Subsidy Roll. In 1346 The Book of Aid mentions John de Foxgrove and John or Joan de Rokesle being taxed in the Beckenham and associated with Foxgrove whether by assumption or actual connection. John de Rokesle (Ruxley) was lord of the manor of Lullingstone. The time gap probably indicates two successive 'Johns of Foxgrave/Foxgrove. We have Henry de Clyf associated with the manor some time earlier. He is also mentioned in the Although Foxgrove has been described as a 'Manor' it is belived to have been separated from the Manor of Beckenham and I have not found any evidence of a charter establishing a 'Manor'. Also the land of the manor covers some parts of Beckenham, Bromley and Lewisham parishes In several instances Foxgrove is described as 'held of' other parties implying leases so apparent changes of ownership are often followed by the property returning to a prior landlord. The Burghersh/Burwash family held wide ranging properties. Similar to Beckenham Manor the owners may not have been locally resident. Where documents are discovered they are recorded in the timeline. John Grene appears as a local lawyer/sheriff/escheator. We can trace the family tree of Sir John Oliff through his daughter Joan and down through the Leigh family. Francis Leigh's will of 1711 did not specifically say to sell the estate but the executors he named did not deal with the probate and his wife Frances Leigh was awarded probate. Francis directed that his bequests and debts be settled and any remaining property be passed to his son also named Frances. A Court of Chancery case of 1716 directed that Foxgrove be sold to pay his creditors and this raises a question as to whether Foxgrove passed to John Tolson in 1712/13 or later to his brother Lancelot Tolson of Plaistow(Bromley). John Tolson died in 1713 perhaps before Foxgrove was sold. Lancelot Tolson left Foxgrove to his nephew, Lancelot Tolson Tilly who dying young, left it to his parents who in turn left it in parts to Lancelot Tolson Tillys widow Elizabeth who in her turn left her part to Joseph Grove her uncle. Another part was left to Deborah Brydges (married to Reverend Edward Timewell) and eitheer a third part to John and Edward Brydges or they would inherit if Deborah Brydges died without issue. The timeline will explain more fully. For those interested in genealogy its a complex story and this branch of the Leigh family is connected but different to the branch at Addington. The wills and bequests of the Tillys certainly confuse me and I am discussing the processes with another researcher. It remains the case that some land acquisitions of John Cator cannot be dated other than by his assets listed in the 1825 Private Act of Parliament. Cators creation of Beckenham Place Park probably included some small areas outside of Foxgrove Manor being nearer Southend Village. As Foxgrove under the Cators became leased from the early to mid 19th C. then it was divided between tenants of Beckenham Place and the farmers of Foxgrove Farm while certain parts were long leased to builders and property speculators.\n\nToday the Manor of Foxgrove is covered by Beckenham Place Park perhapse accounting for about 150 acres and the remainder in built development and Foxgrove Cricket and Tennis club.\n\nLangley Place or Park and Farm\n\nLangley lies astride the parish boundary between Beckenham and West Wickham. West Wickham in early times was just called Wickham but to differentiate more definitely from East Wickham near Bexley the 'West' seems to have been added. Perhaps because one local family, the Leighs, were of East Wickham as well.\n\nPhilipot said of Langley: Langley in this Parish is a second Seat of eminent Account, which was in elder Times the Possession of John de Malmains, who obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands in Bekenham, in the twelfth year of Edward the second,(1319) which was renewed to Henry de Cliffe, to whom they accrued by Purchase from Malmains, in the third year of Edward the third;(1330) but stayed not long in the Tenure of this Fa∣mily, for before the going out of Edward the third,(1377) I find the Propriety invested by Sale in Langley, to which Family the Foundation of that House owes in part its Original, on which they ingraffed their own Name, which hath flourished under that Title ever since, though the Family be withered away and gone, the last of which Name at this place was Ralph Langley, who with Roger Twisden, Stephen Monins, Edward Monins, John Edingham or Engham, Richard Edingham, John Berton of Cotman∣ton in Shouldon, John Berham, John Betenham of Shurland in Pluckley, and others, Gentlemen of prime Rank in this County, were summoned to appear before Robert Poynings and John Perry, in the twelfth year of Henry the sixth,(1434) to disclaim the Title of the House of York, and this Ralph died in the year 1451, and ordered Langley and other demeasns at Bekenham to be sold for the discharging his Debts, the purport and Effects of which Will were accordingly performed, and his Estate at Bekenham and Langley, passed away by Sale to John Violett, whose Successors enjoyed it until the Be∣ginning of Hen. the eighth,(1509) and then it was conveyed to John Stiles Esq; who much inlarged the House with a supply of Buildings, and from him is it by Descent devolved to be the instant Possession of his Successor Sir Humphrey Stiles Knight and Baronet.(d1552)\n\nHasted said a bit more about Langley but it can be confused with Langley near Maidstone but we find that the Domesday entry which Hasted quotes with the mention of a fishery relates to Seal near Sevenoaks and the fishery must be on the river Darenth or consisting of fish ponds.\n\nHasted's entry: LANGLEY-PARK is a seat of eminent account in this parish, which was formerly accounted a manor, and in the reign of the Conqueror was part of the vast estate of Odo, bishop of Baieux, and earl of Kent; and is thus, if I mistake not, described in the general survey of Domesday, taken in that reign: (regretably Hasted did mistake it)\n\nGoisfridus de Ros holds of the bishop (of Baieux) Lasela. It was taxed at 7 shillings. The arable land is . . . . . . . In demesne there are 3 carucates, and 31 villeins, with 14 borderers having 16 carucates. There are 10 servants, and one fishery producing fourscore and 10 eels; wood for the pannage of 55 hogs. The whole manor was worth, in the time of king Edward the Confessor, 30 pounds, when he received it 16 pounds, and now 24 pounds, what Goisfridus held; what Richard of Tonbridge held in his lowy was rated at 6 pounds; what the king held of this manor, 22 shillings. Brixi Cilt held it of king Edward.\n\nThis place afterwards came into the possession of the family of Malmaines, who were settled at Waldershare in this county, in the time of the Conqueror. John de Malmaines obtained a charter of free warren for his lands in Begenham, in the 12th year of king Edward II. which was renewed to Henry Malmaines, of Cliffe, in the 3d year of king Edward III.\n\nIt appears by the Book of Aid, in the 20th year of king Edward III. that Nicholas Malmains held half a knight's fee of the king in Begenham. He died, in the 23d year of that reign, possessed of much land in this county; before the end of which, the property of this manor was transferred by sale to Langley, a name most probably taken from this place, though the family itself has been long since extinct. These Langleys of Beckingham were, most probably, adistinct family from those of Knowlton in this county, who were originally descended from a family of that name in the county of Warwick.\n\nThe last of this name here was Ralph Langley, who died in the 30th year of king Henry VI. and by his will directed Langley, with the rest of his demesnes in Beckenham, to be sold for discharging his debts; in pursuance of which it was passed away by sale to John Violett, who bore for his arms, Gules, three coronets, or, whose descendants enjoyed it until the beginning of the reign of king Henry VIII. when it was conveyed to John Stile, alderman of London.\n\nHe was the son of William Style of Ipswich, was afterwards knighted, and of the Drapers company, and dying in 1500, was buried in Allhallows Barking church, London. He married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Guy Wolston of London, by whom he had Sir Humphrey Style, of Langley, who was one of the esquires of the body to king Henry VIII. and sheriff of this county in the 35th year of the same reign. He died in 1557, and was buried in Beckenham church. He procured a grant from Sir Thomas Wriothesley, garter principal king at arms, reciting, that not being willing to bear arms in prejudice to the other branches of his family, he had petitioned for a coat, with a proper difference, which the said king at arms, in 1529, granted, under his hand and seal, viz. Sable, a fess engrailed between three fleurs de lis, within a bordure or, the fess fretted of the field.\n\nHe procured, with others, an act of parliament in the 2d and 3d years of king Edward VI. for the disgavelling of his lands in this county.\n\nBy his first wife, Bridget, daughter of Sir Thomas Baldrey, he had three sons; Edmund, born at Langley, in 1538; Oliver, who was sheriff of London, and ancestor of the Styles, of Watringbury, barts. and Nicholas, who was knighted.\n\nFrom Edmund Style of Langley, esq. before-mentioned, eldest son of Sir Humphrey, descended Sir Humphry Style of Langley, eldest son of William, who was gentleman of the privy-chamber to king James, and cupbearer to king Charles I. and was created a baronet, by privy-seal, on the 20th of May, 1627. (fn. 26) But though this branch was the elder to those of Watringbury, yet these last were the senior baronets, being created April 21, 1627, anno 3 Charles I. He died in 1650, and was buried in the vault at Beckenham church, and leaving no issue, his title became extinct, and he was succeeded in this estate at Langley by his half-brother, William, the eldest son of William Style by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Clarke, one of the barons of the exchequer.\n\nThis William Style of Langley, esq. was bred a barrister at law, and was of the society of the Inner Temple. He married Elizabeth, sole daughter and heir of William Duleing, by whom he had two sons, and two daughters, and dying in 1679, was buried in this church.\n\nOf the sons, the second, but only surviving son Humphry, succeeded his father at Langley, in whose time there were several coats of arms, as well of this family as of those they had intermarried with, painted in the windows of this house, but dying without issue male, his only daughter and heir, Elizabeth, carried it in marriage to Sir John Elwill, bart. who died in 1727, without issue by her. This family of Elwill was of Exeter in Devonshire, who bore for their arms, Ermine on a chevron engrailed, between three eagles displayed gules, three annulets or, and were advanced to the dignity of a baronet, in the person of Sir John Elwill, in the 8th year of queen Anne's reign. He was twice married, but left issue only, by his second wife, the daughter and heir of  Leigh of Egham, in Surry, by whom he had two sons, Sir John above-mentioned, and Edmund, who succeeded his brother in title and in this estate of Langley, and in 1732 transferred his property in it, together with the house, called Langley-house, the park, and also the north and south isles of the parish church of Beckenham, to Hugh Raymond of Great Saling, in Essex, esq. who settled them on his only son, Jones Raymond, esq. in tail general; remainder to his eldest daughter, Amy, who married Peter Burrell, esq. and her issue male. On his death his son, Jones Raymond, esq succeeded to this estate, and kept his shrievalty for this county at Langley in 1738, in which year he died, and was succeeded by his son, of the same name, who died unmarried in 1768, on which it descended, by the intail before-mentioned, to his sister, Amy, before mentioned, whose husband, Peter Burrell, esq. in her right, became possessed of it. He died in 1756, having had by her, who survived him, four sons and two daughters. Mrs. Burrell, his widow, afterwards resided here, and died in 1794, on which this seat descended, together with her other estates in this parish, to her grandson, sir Peter Burrell, bart. since created lord Gwydir, of whom a full account has already been given, and he is the present possessor of this seat, with the park and grounds belonging to it.\n\nKelsey or Kelseys and Kelsey Park\n\nSome question exists about the origins of Kelsey as the connection with the de Kelseys is challenged. Later writers have said that the Brograves leased some land from the Bruyns which became Kelsey.\n\nPhilipot wrote of Kelsey: Kelseys lies likewise in this Parish, and may justly exact our Notice; by Deeds written in a Character that hath an Aspect upon the Reign of Henry the third, John de Kelsey, William de Kelsey, and others of that Sirname are represented to have an Interest in this Seat, and from hence it is probable the Kelseys of Surrey did derive their first Extraction, however by the Injuries of Time they have been in succeeding Generations cast under the umbrage of an obscurer Fortune: But I return, After this Family had deserted the Possession of this place, which was before the latter End of Richard the the second, I find the Brograves stepped in, and by purchase became Lords of the Fee, a Family which in very old Deeds writ themselves Burgrave, and sometimes Boroughgrave, though now a more easie Pronunciation hath melted it into Brograve, which represents the Etymologie of the Name, to have been in its Origi∣nal perfectly Saxon. In the year 1479, there was a License granted (as appears by the Records of Rochester) to William Brograve by the then Bishop of that Diocess, to erect an Oratory or Chapple at his Mannor-house of Kelseys, the Vestigia or Reliques of which are yet obvious to an inquisitive Eye, and from this William did the Title and possession in an even Current come down to Mr. Thomas Brograve, who being not many years since deceased, his Widow Mrs. Martha Brograve now in respect of Join∣ture, enjoys the present Possession of it.\n\nBut having about 130 years more information Hasted says;\n\nKELSEYS is a seat of note in this parish, which as early as the reign of king Henry III. had owners of that name, as appears by deeds written in a character seemingly of that time, wherein John de Kelsey, William de Kelsey, and others of that surname, are described as having an interest in this seat. After this family had deserted the possession of this place, which was in the reign of king Richard II. the Brograves (sometimes written Boroughgrave) were by purchase become owners, and resided at it.\n\nAn ancestor of this family was Sir Roger Brograve, who lived in the reign of Edward I. and was of Warwickshire, who bore for his arms, Argent three lions passant guardant gules; from whom descended William Borgrave of Beckenham, to whom, in 1479, licence was granted by the bishop of Rochester (as appears by the records of that church) to erect an oratory, or chapel, at his manor house of Kelseys, the ruins of which are not now even to be traced out. (fn. 20)\n\nAt length, a descendant of this name and family, John Brograve, some small time before the year 1688, conveyed this estate by sale to Peter Burrell, esq. who was the ninth son of Walter Burrell, esq. of Holmstead-house, in Cuckfield, in Sussex, whose ancestors are said to have been originally seated in Northumberland as early as the reign of king Edward I. but Randulphus Burrell, son and heir of Randulphus, having married Sermonda, daughter and coheir of Sir Walter Woodland of Devonshire, anno 19 king Edward II. became in her right possessed of a great estate in that county. His direct descendant, John Burrell, was a man of eminence in the reign of king Henry V. and left several sons, of whom Walter, the eldest, succeeded him in his estates; and Gerardus, the youngest, settled at Cuckfield, in Sussex, anno 1446, being vicar of that church, and archdeacon and residentiary of Chichester. He died in 1508, leaving his estate to his nephew, Ralph, who settled at Cuckfield. Thomas, his son, by Dorothy Weston, his wife, had Ninian Burrell, esq. of Cuckfield, who married Jane, daughter of Henry Smith of Surry, afterwards remarried to Peter Courthope, esq. of Danny, in Sussex, and died in 1614, leaving several sons and daughters.\n\nOf the sons, Walter, the eldest, married Frances, daughter of John Hooper of Stockbury, esq. in this county, by whom he had nine sons and three daughters. (fn. 21) Of the former, Peter Burrell, esq. the ninth son, purchased the manor of Kelseys, some few years before the Revolution, as mentioned above. He afterwards settled here, and married Isabella, the second daughter of John Merrick, esq. of Essex, by whom he had six sons and four daughters. He died in 1718, and was buried in this church, leaving only two of his sons, Peter and Merrick, and three daughters, surviving; of whom, Frances married Richard Wyatt, esq. of Egham, in Surry; Isabella married Thomas Dalyson, esq. of Hampton, in this county; and Anne married Richard, brother to Sir Hugh Ackland, bart. of Devonshire.\n\nMerrick Burrell, the youngest son, was of West Grinsted-park, in Sussex, and was created a baronet in the 6th year of George III. to him and his heirs male, and in default of such, to his nephew, Peter Burrell, esq. of Beckenham, since deceased, and his heirs male. On Sir Merrick Burrell's death, s. p. the title of baronet descended to his great nephew, Sir Peter Burrell, the present baronet, since created Lord Gwydir, as will be farther mentioned below. Peter Burrell, esq. the eldest son, succeeded his father in this estate, and resided at Beckenham. He served the office of high-sheriff of this county in 1722, and died in 1756. He married Amy, eldest daughter of Jones Raymond of Langley, esq. (should read Hugh Raymond of Langley) in this parish, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. Of the former, Peter Burrell, esq, the eldest son, succeeded him in this estate, and was of Beckenham; Raymond, the second son, died young; and William; the third, was bred to the civil law, commenced Doctor of Laws, and was chancellor to the bishops of Worcester and Rochester. He married Sophia, daughter of Charles Raymond of Valentine-house, in Essex, who was created a baronet in 1774, with remainder, in default of issue male, to William Burrell above mentioned, and his heirs male by Sophia his wife, which title, on his death, descended to Sir William Burrell, bart. above mentioned, who died in 1796, leaving his widow surviving, and by her two sons and one daughter. Of the two daughters, Amelia married Tobias Frere, esq. and Isabella died young. Peter Burrell, esq. married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of John Lewis, esq. of Hackney, by whom he had one son, Peter, and four daughters, of whom Elizabeth-Emelia married Richard Henry Alexander Bennett, esq. of Cambridgeshire; Susanna married lord Algernon Percy, second son of the late duke of Northumberland, now lord Lovaine; Frances Juliana married Hugh earl Percy, now duke of Northumberland; and Elizabeth, the fourth daughter, married Douglas duke of Hamilton. He died possessed of Kelseys, in 1775 (ownership held or shared in dower by Amy Burrell nee Raymond), being succeeded in it by his only son and heir, Peter Burrell, esq. of Beckenham, who was afterwards knighted; and at length, on the death of Sir Merrick Burrell, bart. succeeded to that title by the limitation of the patent. He married in 1779, the lady Elizabeth Priscilla Bertie, eldest sister of Robert late duke of Ancaster. on whose death, s. p. she succeeded to the title of Baroness Willoughby of Eresby, and in her own right and person to the office of Lord Great Chamberlain of England, the office being executed by her husband Sir Peter Burrell, knt. and bart. who was, in May 1796, created Lord Gwydir of Gwydir, in Carnarvonshire. By her he has a son, Peter Robert, born in 1782, and other children, and is the present possessor of this estate. He bears for his arms, Vert three plain shields argent, each having a bordure ingrailed or. (end of Hasted's)\n\nThe error regarding Amy Raymond's father, being daughter of Hugh Raymond and not Jones Raymond who was her brother is perhaps connected with Hasted's error regarding Langley and Foxgrove whereby he believes there were two Jones Raymonds when in fact there was only one. Although Hasted's background information is interesting it does not cover the complex land acquisitions and exchanges whereby Kelsey, Langley and parts of Foxgrove and Beckenham Manor came into Burell ownership from Hugh Raymond of Langley and the Tolsons of Foxgrove including the involvement of John Cator who was moving into the area from circa 1757. The timeline attempts to clarify these transactions. From the time that Kelsey was seperated from the Manor of Beckenham by the Brograves, it then passed to Burrell from whom it descended to the fourth Peter Burrell/Baron Gwydir on whose death in 1820 it was sold. Subject to clarification to Edward Grose Smith then to the Hoare family of banking renown. Having become rejoined with parts of Beckenham Manor, Langley and Foxgrove under the Burrells the sale of the 'Gwydir' estates divided the ownership of Langley, Langley Farm and Kelsey. The 1838 Tithe map and returns allows a snapshot of the division but leaves some questions. Not least that the 18th Century saw several bequests, sales and exchanges described in the timeline.\n\nKent House\n\nPhilipot does not mention Kent House but Hasted writes:\n\n\"KENT-HOUSE is situated on the very edge of this county, towards Surry, and seems to be so called either from its having been once the outer bounds of this county, or from having been formerly the first house on the entrance into this parish within this county, from that of Surry. It was for some generations in the possession of the family of Lethieullier; the first of whom was Sir John Le Thieullier a Hamburgh merchant, who had raised himself by his industry in trade, and settled in this parish. He devised it at his death to his son, William Lethieullier, of this parish, esq. who by his will gave it, with his mansion and other estates in Beckenham, to his second son, Manning Lethieullier, esq. whose son, John Greene Lethieullier, esq. alienated it, in 1776, to Thomas Lucas, of Lee, in this county, esq. who died possessed of it in 1784, leaving his widow surviving, who re-marrying John Julius Angerstein, of Charlton, esq. he is, in her right, at this time possessed of it.\"\n\nA few early records can be found relating to Kenthous (sic) at the National Archive etc. and these may lead to more research. Len Hevey believes it was originally part of Beckenham Manor like Foxgrove and Langley and over time these parts became separated from the Manor. A record from 1503 indicates a family called Fabyan held Kenthouse with land in Beckenham, Lewisham and Battersey. Certainly the Style family are associated with Kent House in 1501 and 1624 seemingly acquiring it from an unpaid debt. Before that, in 1346 Henry de Clyf and in 1384 John Leeg is mentioned as the manor of Kent House. The Lethieulliers acquired Kenthouse and are said to have built Clock House circa 1716/30. Some writers have said Kent House was the first house outside the boundaries of London but its proximity to the Kent/Surrey border is the more likely reason for its name and it has been compared to Kent Hatch and New Cross which were other places on the county border. In earlier times London did not extend south of the Thames until the metropolis grew into Greater London by encompassing villages which became its suburbs. Kent House will be found referred to in the timeline.\n\nOther Properties:\n\nThayer's Farm\n\nAlternatively spelt Thayre's on a 1736 map of Thomas Motley's properties, the name implies someone called Thayer once owned the farm but he has eluded being definitively traced so far but these records in St. George's burials probably hold clues:\n\n9 Feb 1642 THAIRES Giles(the elder) 6 Aug 1654 THARE Judy d of Giles 15 Apr 1688 THARES Giles s of Giles 9 Jun 1786 THARES John s of Giles 14 Oct 1687 THARES Mary d of Giles 11 Dec 1696 THARES Samuel s of Giles 18 Dec 1696 THARES Valentine s of Giles\n\n6 Sep 1653 THAYER Giles 8 Jun 1648 THAYER Katharine d of Giles 24 May 1644 THEIRE Marie d of Giles 12 Jun 1715 THEYES\n\nGyles 20 May 1737 THEYR John 10 Sep 1740 THEYR Margaret 1 Oct 1734 THEYR Martha\n\nGiles d.1653 left a will which is being searched for. He was predeceased by two daughters. Presumably Gyles was his son and John maybe a grandson. By 1736 the farm belonged to Thomas Motley and maybe John sold it to Motley near the time of his death. That may have enabled him to provide for Margaret who could have been his wife or daughter. The story needs confirmation and of course there's a possibility that the Thayers were tenant farmers but the will of Giles of 1653 may contain significant information. Thomas Motley is the earliest confirmed owner we have traced and his map shows the tenant farmers of his land who do not include any Thayres in 1736. Thomas Motley's property descended via his daughter married to Francis Austin and their son Francis Motley Austin. It was later purchased into the Cator estates.\n\nElmers End Farms\n\nSimilar to Thayers Farm, Thomas Motley's map illustrates these and how they were related to neighbouring landlords, the St.Johns, Burrells, St.John Humphrey. The name Elmer was in earlier times often spelt Aylmer, a family that appear in early tax rolls in 1328 and 1345 as well as some archive documents.\n\nEden Farm or Place was built on part of the Burrells Kelsey/Langley lands and leased to the Eden family. Although said to be part of Langley it would appear that the land was part of Kelsey which was owned by the Burrells along with Langley when the land was leased to the Eden family.\n\nMonks Orchard formed part of the Addington estates of the Leigh family until that was sold to Barlow Trecothick. His heir, a nephew sold Monks Orchard to the Burrells\n\nClockhouse built for the Lethieulliers had a few fields around it and came into the hands of Joseph Cator in 1782 after Sir Piercy Brett, a former owner, had died. Then it was absorbed into the Cator estates on Joseph Cator's death in 1818 being leased until its demolition. There is some possibility a pre-existing building was on the site indicated by the 1623 Beckenham Manor map, possibly an earlier farmstead but this is one of the many unknown details outstanding.\n\nWoolseys Farm was on and around Clay Hill, the site of what is now Bishop Challoner's School in Bromley Road. The first pictorial descriptions of it are on the 1723 and 1735 Burrell estate maps held in the British Library and at that time it was under the land holdings of the Burrells of Kelseys although leased to someone believed to be Buxton although the map is faded and the writing difficult to read. Clay Hill was a crossroads on Bromley Road with what is now Scotts Lane and Court Downs Bridge Road. From 1735 the site changed landlords a few times becoming part of Raymond estates after the Raymond and Burrell families intermarried. Then part of an exchange between the Burrells and John Cator, then John Barwell Cator sold it in the early 19th Century. From a farm it became upgraded to a large house with associated farm. Was an hotel for a time before becoming the school.\n\nThe Village\n\nThe early village would have been dominated by the Parish Church and Manor House opposite. We might imagine a house with its estate establishing a family chapel and the evolution of a settlement. An estate with farms obviously requires labour so some accommodation for people and livestock would be involved. Some documentary evidence could even imply that the Rector of the Church did occupy the manor house for some time but needs conclusive evidence. The mix of estates and the number of farms would require a good number of people and the early population of Beckenham has been stated as about 1000. Church records would be the most comprehensive record via births, deaths and marriages. Various property documents reveal names of small property owners, leaseholders and tenants. As well as the estate landlords some names cropping up are Willis, Pugh, Grote, Batt etc. The available maps from 1623 onwards illustrate some buildings but maybe only more dominant houses were shown. The maps had more to do with recording property ownership than accurate representation of landmark details. Some land ownership documents refer to 'Closes' which could be groups of workers cottages or hovels. It seems the term 'hovel' was a bonafide description of a lowly residence. Although the village was small there was a correspondingly small 'workhouse' at Clay Hill and the almshouses next to the church for the impoverished. The Parish system provided some poor relief but if anyone falling on hard times was from a different parish then measures were in place to remove them to their home parish which had responsibility for them. The village had several large houses called Grete(Great) Houses or mansions as well as the old manor house. The Mead was owned by Thomas Motley near Thornton's Corner. Another large house was on the site of the Greyhound Public House or now closed public conveniences. Village Place was also on the High Street nearly opposite the Village Way junction. Beckenham Lodge once owned by the Banyer family was near the War memorial/Barclays Bank site with its own grounds.\n\nThe estate maps of the Burrells dated 1809 and the Cators dated 1868 show a lot of detail of the village and surroundings before large scale development took place. The writings of Borrowman, Copeland, Inman, Tonkin and Manning are the best sources of information about the 19th century village. As one works backwards the details becomes harder to define.\n\nBeckenham Rectory\n\nIn the late 18th Century William Rose the Rector had a Rectory built to the designs of the Adam Brothers. His 'living' from the parishes of Beckenham and Carshalton plus family wealth must have been considerable as he also had designs for a substantial stables. Our thanks go to David Love for this article about the Rectory. Robert Adam came up with a very elaborate paladian design but two later versions of the plans played down the design to something much plainer. It appears that the design for a stables was not acted upon. The Rectory had considerable gardens and glebe land (see https://maps.nls.uk/view/102343453). Whether Rose's fortunes affected the project or other circumstances we cannot say. The clergy that followed Rose did not choose to live in the Rectory and it was eventually demolished to make way for a new Town Hall for Beckenham which in turn was demolished to make way for the current Marks & Spencer and car park.\n\nRobert and James Adam office drawings © Sir John Soanes Museum, London - As built circa 1880\n\nPenge.\n\nMore associated with Battersea in ancient times the area became more connected with Beckenham over a period of time. Some connections came about through the St.John family who had acquired Battersea (Batricksey) Manor before they purchased Beckenham Manor and part of Beckenham Manor is near Rockhills\n\nA History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 1912.\n\nThe 'hamlet' of Penge was part of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Battersea. The curious anomalies of its local government led to its formation as a separate urban district and its transfer to the county of Kent in 1900.(fn. 49) Penge was a wooded district, over which the tenants of Battersea Manor had common of pasture.(fn. 50) The boundaries of the hamlet on the north in February 16045 were the common of Rockhills (evidently Rockhills in Upper Sydenham, immediately north of the Crystal Palace) and the 'Shire Ditch' leading past the house called 'Abbetts' to the north corner of 'Lord Riden's Wood.' The Shire Ditch also bounded the hamlet on the east and was crossed by 'Willmoores Bridge,' half in Kent and half in Surrey. On the south it was bounded by the waste or common of Croydon, the green way from Croydon to Lewisham. On the west was a wood 'of Mr. Colton's' in Camberwell parish, which stretched from Vicker's Oak to the Low Cross near Rockhills.(fn. 51) There seem to have been several tenants of the manor at Penge in 1596,(fn. 52) but in 1725 the vicar of Battersea returned to Bishop Willis that there were only thirteen houses and sixty inhabitants in Penge, who went to Beckenham Church, and for whose care he paid a trifling consideration to the incumbent of Beckenham.(fn. 53) The whole common was inclosed under an Act of 1827.(fn. 54) There were then 320 acres already inclosed and several houses standing there. In 1853 Mr. Schuster sold his park on the summit of Penge Hill to the Crystal Palace Company for the re-erection of the gigantic building made by Sir Joseph Paxton for the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851.(fn. 55) The Palace was opened by Queen Victoria in 1854.(fn. 56) In 1877, owing to financial difficulties and to the 'Greenwich fair characteristics,' which had replaced the former educational objects of the Palace, the company was reconstituted.(fn. 57) The Palace, as originally planned, was the exhibition building of glass and iron which had served for the Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park, re-erected on this site, with the addition of high water towers to supply the fountains in the grounds. Inside courts were erected to illustrate the arts and architecture of different periods, from the Egyptian monarchy to the Italian Renaissance, and there was a great collection of plaster casts of famous statues.(fn. 58) A School of Art and Music was established, and later a School of Forestry and Engineering, which has continued to flourish. The Palace became the chief seat of the highest class of music near London, and the Handel Festivals, under the direction of Sir Michael Costa and Sir August Manns, obtained the greatest reputation, as did the Saturday Concerts so closely associated with the names of Sir August Manns and Sir George Grove. But the public taste did not rise to this level, and the theatre and music-hall exhibitions gradually eclipsed the educational features. The grounds, of great extent, including a cricket field, football ground and a lake, continue to furnish unrivalled scope for exhibitions, excursions, games and firework or aeronautical displays. The land surrounding the Palace was sold shortly before 1875 for building purposes, and the whole site is now for sale.\n\nBetween 1821 and 1841 the population of Penge increased very slightly. In 1841 it was 270. In 1851, owing to the establishment of the Surrey School of Industry, the Queen Dowager's Almshouses and the Watermen's Almshouses, it had increased to 1,169. In 1901 it was 22,465. One great cause of this increase was the advent of the London, Brighton and South Coast, and London, Chatham and Dover railways, which constituted Penge a suburb of both London and Croydon. The former has stations at the Crystal Palace, Anerley and Penge; Penge station, on the latter, is within the boundary of Beckenham. A town hall was built in the Anerley Road in 1879. Anerley, Penge and Upper Norwood are the three wards of the Penge Urban District. The ecclesiastical districts of St. John the Evangelist, St. Paul, Holy Trinity and Christ Church were formed in 1851, 1869, 1873 and 1886 respectively.\n\nBeckenham Place Park\n\nIn Hasted's History of Kent he briefly describes Beckenham Place as the seat John Cator and that it was built in 1773 on the purchase of Beckenham Manor from Frederick St. John. We have found this to be inaccurate in several respects. Cator had acquired land which was part of Foxgrove Manor from the late 1750's and his exchanges of various plots with Jones Raymond and Amy Burrell brought him into posession of the site of the current Beckenham Place mansion on Stumpshill by 1759/60. Cator's father in law Peter Collinson writes of visiting his daughter and Cator in June 1763 at their newly built house at Stumpshill and he admires the grounds and planting around the house. At that time Cator did not own all of the subsequent parkland and the remaining park contains little if any of the Beckenham Manor land acquired from Frederick St. John. Complex purchases and exchanges are described in the timeline along with several questions and facts regarding the Cators and the other landlord families.\n\nDetails of the features within Beckenham Place mansion can be found in Cultivated Leisure by David Love.\n\nThe separate timeline on this site concentrates on Beckenham Place and was the foundation for this timeline.\n\nShortlands, Clay Hill, Scott' Lane\n\nShortlands is a relatively recent development which covers the area of the earlier Clay Hill which itself was an evolution from Cleyhurst. The properties of Lodge Farm and Woolseys Farm have been swallowed up by it and it has taken its name from Shortlands Green which goes back beyond the 17th Century. Shortlands House, now Bishop Challoner's School, is on the site of Woolseys Farm. Scott's Lane takes its name from James Scott, a surgeon of Bromley who took up residence there. These articles by Linda and Keith Baldwin trace its history and some interesting personalities who lived there. Follow Shortlands and Scott for the articles in pdf format.\n\nTimeline (note; The Early History of Beckenham by Len Hevey is a recommended read alongside this for pre-history until the 14th Century)\n\n1042-1066 King EDWARD THE CONFESSOR (The reigns of monarchs will be inserted to add perspective along with some events)\n\nFollowing the death of Harthacanute, Edward restored the rule of the House of Wessex to the English throne. A deeply pious and religious man, he presided over the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey, leaving much of the running of the country to Earl Godwin and his son Harold. Edward died childless, eight days after the building work on Westminster Abbey had finished. With no natural successor, England was faced with a power struggle for control of the throne.\n\nWe do not have any evidence of Beckenham from this time apart from the Domesday Book entry but as Domesday refers back to the time of Edward the Confessor his period of reign may be relevant.\n\n1066 - HAROLD II, you should have learnt this at school...The Battle of Stamford Bridge, Battle of Hastings and all that. According to Domesday, Anschil or Eskil was the Lord in 1066 and before, paying tax to King Edward. Spellings differed according to old english or french versions.\n\n1066 - 1086 King William I (the Conqueror)\n\n1066-1086 was a period of turmoil which has been well researched by others but culminated in the Great Survey or Domesday in which William wanted to determine what taxes had been owed during the reign of King Edward the Confessor thereby allowing William to reassert the rights of the Crown and assess where power lay after a wholesale redistribution of land following the Conquest.\n\nThe Domesday survey was carried out by commissioners holding sworn inquests in local courts, where they asked fixed questions of local men. For each property, each question was asked three times, to cover changes over time. The commissioners asked how land had been held:\n\nas it had been on the last day of the reign of Edward the Confessor (5 January 1066)  this is abbreviated in Domesday as TRE\n\nas it had been when it was granted by King William\n\nas it was in 1086 (when the survey was taken)\n\nThe questions included: (replies inserted from data)\n\nWhat is the manor called? Beckenham\n\nWho held it in the time of King Edward? Anschil / Eskil of Beckenham\n\nWho holds it now? Ansgot of Rochester\n\nHow many hides (a land measurement)?\n\nHow much has been added or taken away from the manor?\n\nHow much has or had each freeman and each sokeman?\n\nHow many plough teams?\n\nHow many freemen, sokemen, villans, cottars and slaves? 22 villagers, 8 smallholders and 4 slaves\n\nHow much wood, meadow and pasture?\n\nHow many mills and fisheries? 1 mill no fisheries\n\nHow much was the whole worth in 1066, and how much now (1086)? £9, £9, £13\n\nIn the beginning of the Domesday survey, Anschillus de Bacheham (Anschil/Eskil of Beckenham) is said to have had the liberties of sac and soc (jurisdiction) within his lands, in the Lathe of Sutton at the time of Edward the Confessor but by 1086 Ansgot of Rochester is subtenant under Odo Biship of Bayieux. Ansgot holds various other manors in Kent and an Ansgot is described as Chamberlain to William Rufus who succeeded William the Conqueror.\n\nIs it beyond any possibility that Anskil could have been restyled as Ansgot. Some debate has surmised that Ango-Saxon names were translated into Norman/French versions.\n\nBeckenham is recorded as having 34 households, 22 villagers, 8 smallholders and 4 slaves. Domesday excluded land held by the crown or church.\n\nIn 1066 Anschil (Eskil) was landholder to the lord King Edward but Odo is still recorded as tenant in chief in 1086 with Ansgot of Rochester subtenant despite Odo's apparent fall from grace. It is interesting to note Danish names appearing (Bigga & Eskil) in an area not noted for Viking invasion but this implies a mixed population.\n\nBishop Odo was a maternal half-brother of William the Conqueror who was a trusted royal minister, even acting regent in Williams absences, but in 1067 he was found to be defrauding both the crown and diocese of Canterbury and a number of properties were sequestered. In 1082 he was imprisoned for planning a military expedition to Italy and all of his lands were taken back by the King. He remained in prison for 5 years only released by King William on his deathbed but never regained any power. He is reputed to have later taken part in a rebellion to replace William Rufus (William II) but was allowed to leave Kent for Normandy and his land in England was forfeit to the crown. Hevey states that Beckenham remained in the king's hands until the reign of King John.\n\n1086 - Domesday Book entry for Beckenham, Hasted had transcribed: In Brunlei hundred Ansgotus de Rochester holds of the bishop (of Baieux/Odo) Bacheham. It was taxed at 2 sulings. The arable land is eight carucates. In demesne there are 2 carucates, and 22 villeins, with 8 borderers, having 8 carucates and a half. There are 12 acres of meadow, and 4 servants, and 1 mill, and wood for the pannage of 60 hogs. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, and afterwards, it was worth 9 pounds, now 3 pounds. Anschil held it of king Edward.\n\n8 Carucates or Ploughlands are estimated to be 120 acres each, ie 960 acres. A plough team is said to be 8 oxen.\n\nThe much later Foxgrove map of 1766 copied from 1720 records that \"20 great beasts of Foxgrove\" were grazed on land alongside the Ravensbourne. The Manor of Beckenham map of 1623 shows land of 936 acres but excludes Foxgrove, Langley and Kelsey etc but does include woodlands on the manor. So Domesday's coverage requires clarification. An ideal position for a mill would have been on the Beck in Kelseys where the river descends through the two lakes though other positions on the Beck may have been utilized for mill ponds. A windmill once stood on Bromley Hill but nothing definite can be identified for Domesdays description. But a mill at Glassmill Lane nearer or in Bromley has always been there and another mill nearby called Monks Mill can be found on some old maps.\n\nA more modern translation of Domesday describes Land of Bishop Odo of Bayeux\n\nHouseholds: 22 villagers. 8 smallholders. 4 slaves.\n\nPloughland: 8 ploughlands. 2 lord's plough teams. 8.5 men's plough teams.\n\nOther resources: Meadow 12 acres. Woodland 60 swine render. 1 mill.\n\nAnnual value to lord: 13 pounds in 1086; 9 pounds when acquired by the 1086 owner; 9 pounds in 1066.\n\nOwners:\n\nTenant-in-chief in 1086: Bishop Odo of Bayeux.\n\nLord in 1086: Ansgot of Rochester.\n\nOverlord in 1066: King Edward.\n\nLord in 1066: Eskil.\n\n1086 - Langley/West Wickham: The Beckenham, West Wickham and Hayes parish boundaries meet within Langley Park estate. If we take it that Langley was not identified in the Domesday survey, being confused with Hasted's 'Lasela' which turns out to be Seal near Sevenoaks, then some of Langley may have been part of West Wickham in Domesday with the following entry. Maps indicate the parish boundaries having Langley Place estates partially in Wickham, the 1750's Raymond map of Langley and the OS 1860/70's Kent sheet XV illustrate boundaries..\n\n[West] Wickham was a settlement in Domesday Book, in the hundred ofHelmestrei (later renamed Ruxley) and the county ofKent.\n\nHouseholds: 24 villagers. 13 slaves. Land and resources Ploughland: 2 lord's plough teams. 4 men's plough teams. Other resources: Woodland 10 swine render. 1 mill, value 1 shilling and 7 pence. 1 church.Valuation Annual value to lord: 13 pounds in 1086; 6 pounds when acquired by the 1086 owner; 8 pounds in 1066.\n\nOwners\n\nTenant-in-chief in 1086: Bishop Odo of Bayeux.\n\nLord in 1086: Adam son of Hubert.\n\nOverlord in 1066: King Edward.\n\nLord in 1066: Godric son of Karli.\n\nWhatever the outcome of Domesday, then locally only Beckenham, Bromley and West Wickham were recorded. Lewisham to the north could be of interest as a bordering neighbour. But several factors may limit the detail provided by Domesday. The Sulings or areas able to be ploughed were not fixed in size and the area of ploughable land was influenced by soil types. There was presumably more woodland as a resource for building material and fuel. The population of Britain has been estimated at 1.25 to 2 million or less than 1/30th of todays. A website related to Domesday quotes:\n\nThe total population of England in 1086 cannot be calculated accurately from Domesday for several reasons: only the heads of households are listed; major cities like London and Winchester were omitted completely; there are no records of nuns, monks, or people in castles. The population of England at the time of Domesday has been tentatively estimated at between 1¼ and 2 million. However, these figures are much lower than the 4 million people there are estimated to have been in Roman times.\n\nLincolnshire, East Anglia and East Kent were the most densely populated areas with more than 10 people per square mile, while northern England, Dartmoor and the Welsh Marches had less than three people per square mile. This is because many villages had been razed by the conquest armies.\n\nsee; https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/world-of-domesday/landscape.htm\n\nLen Hevey compares the estimates of Domesday with the Tithe map of 1838 and finds that the total area is within 150 acres by comparison of 3300 acres (Domesday) and 3439 acres (1838 Tithe). This would also indicate that all the land was under 'Beckenham Manor' before Foxgrove, Langley, Kelsey and other properties were carved off.\n\n1086 - Peverel of London; Two manors in Kent which in 1086 belonged to Ansgot de Rovecestre did not pass to his descendants. Instead they became merged with the package of lands, mostly in Essex, which in 1086 belonged to Rannulf Pevrel. It is not known how this happened. One guess might be that Ansgot married his daughter to Rannulfs son, giving her these two manors as her marriage portion; but there are other imaginable explanations. At all events, the entire holding lapsed to the king on the death of Rannulfs son Willelm. It came to be known as the honour of Peverel of London. The manors in question are Beckenham and Stoke (i.e. the portion of Stoke which did not belong to the church of Rochester). Half of Beckenham (the northern half) seems to have been held in domain until being granted out by Henric II: the first recorded owner is Willelm fiz Erneis (occ. 1168). The other half of Beckenham (the half which came to be called Langley Park), together with Stoke, became the property of a family whose name, in its earliest appearance, is Malesmæins (R1, fo. 186r); I take that to mean males meains, pain in the wounds. (But thirteenth-century scribes spell the name in various ways, not seeming to know or care about its etymology.) That surname attached itself to the manor in Stoke.\n\nhttp://www.durobrivis.net/survey/db-ke/09-baronies.pdf\n\nsubstantiating evidence is perhaps needed.\n\n1087-1100 King William II (Rufus)\n\n1086-1096 Ansgot of Rochester, who held the Manor of Beckenham and several other manors in Kent is thought to have died during this time.
