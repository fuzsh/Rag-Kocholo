Less than a year later, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his bedroom. The attached report of the inquest into his death is from \"The Morning Chronicle\" of 10 June 1842:- 'An inquest, which did not terminate until four o'clock yesterday afternoon, was held before Mr. Wakley, the Coroner, and a jury consisting chiefly of county magistrates, upon the remains of Henry Brooke Parnell, Baron Congleton, at his lordship's residence, No. 43, Cadogan-place, Chelsea. 'The Coroner, having taken evidence of the deceased nobleman being found suspended to the bed-post in his sleeping chamber, at half-past nine o'clock on Wednesday night, by his valet, Manning, and of prompt medical assistance having been called in, proceeded to examine the Honourable John Parnell, his lordship's eldest son, as to the state of the deceased nobleman's mind. The witness stated that in the early part of the month of April last, his father had a severe attack of fever, which brought on delirium, and from that period his lordship had been attended by Mr. Bolton, a surgeon, and occasionally by Dr. Chambers. Witness arrived from the country, and found that is was necessary that a watch should be kept over his father, and Mr. Bolton desired that every instrument with which he might injure himself should be removed from the room. This arrangement was entered into between Mr. Bolton and witness's brother before he reached town, and after a few days he found that his father had got much better and left his room. This was in accordance with his father's expressed wish; but Mr. Bolton, upon learning that he had done so, said he could not allow the deceased to be left unattended. Up to that period, witness did not know the exact circumstances of the case, but imagined that the reason his father was watched was in consequence of his having had a fit. Mr. Bolton gave directions that the deceased nobleman's razors should be removed, which was done. After that he appeared to have got quite over his attack, but not having recovered his sleep, the medical gentleman continued to attend him. His father had desired that the instruments of self destruction should be removed from his reach; but about a week or ten days after his attack, he inquired the reason he was being watched, and told his medical attendants that he had ceased to have those impulses to self destruction, and he wished to regain his former habits as soon as he could. The witness added, that his father was very unreserved to him in the statements of his bodily health and mental feelings; and he knew as a fact, that the deceased had been, out of the last 36 days, 19 days in a low and desponding state. 'By the Coroner: About a week since one of the bell ropes had fallen down, and his father seemed very desirous to know what it was lying there for, and of what use it could be, and begged that it might be taken away, and put into its place. On Tuesday last he appeared to be in a low state, and witness offered to sit with him in the room, but he declined the offer, and said that he would rather remain alone. The windows of his room were never fastened down, nor did he (witness) believe that the scissors even were removed - such articles it was not thought necessary to remove unless he himself suggested it, and expressed his alarm. About three weeks ago he gave witness a large packing-needle, and told him to remove it. Mr. Bolton did not suggest that a person who had had experience in the care of insane persons should be employed to attend upon Lord Congleton. Latterly, he used to find that his faculties were in some respects gone. He endeavoured to read the newspapers, the Edinburgh Review, and Blackwood's Magazine, but could not. He did not request that anybody should read to him, but preferred being alone. He usually occupied his time by taking walking exercise. He never recovered his sleep, and was constantly growing more debilitated and weak. He never complained to witness of any ailment of the head. On one occasion he was at Richmond, and he swooned away. He thought that was a fit, and described that the feeling came on at the heart and ran up to his head. He sometimes complained of giddiness in the head, and a rolling sensation from ear to ear. Latterly he had had the whole management of the house and servants, witness having some time since made up his accounts, and delivered everything up to his father. 'The Coroner asked the jury if he should adjourn the inquest for the attendance of Mr. Bolton, or if they would like to have the second son of the deceased nobleman examined; but as they made no reply, he briefly summed up, and observed that it was their duty to inquire, in all cases where a person was found hanging, whether it was the act of himself or not, and after some further observations, the jury returned a verdict of \"Temporary insanity.\" ' The special remainder to the Barony of Conyngham created in 1781 From the \"London Gazette\" of 19 December 1780 (issue 12146, page 2):- 'The King has been pleased to order Letters Patent to be passed under the Great Seal of the Kingdom of Ireland, containing His Majesty's Grant of the Dignities of Baron and Earl of the said Kingdom unto Henry Lord Viscount Conyngham, and his Heirs Male, by the Name, Stile and Title of Baron and Earl Conyngham, of Mount Charles, in the County of Donegall, with Remainder of the Barony to his Nephew Francis Pierpont Burton, Esq., and his Heirs Male.' Mary Monckton (21 May 1746-30 May 1840), second wife of Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork and 7th Earl of Orrery Mary was the daughter of John Monckton, 1st Viscount Galway. On 17 June 1786 she married, as his second wife, Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork and 7th Earl of Orrery. From childhood, Mary took a keen interest in literature and in later life her house became a regular meeting place for some of the most important political and literary figures of the day. Among her frequent visitors were Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, Horace Walpole, George Canning, Viscount Castlereagh, Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Robert Peel, and Sydney Smith. Her closest female friend was the actress Sarah Siddons. However, Mary was also a rampant kleptomaniac. Many anecdotes exist of her passion for acquiring \"souvenirs\" wherever she went, until it reached the stage that whenever a visit from her was anticipated, her hosts would hide the best silver and replace it with cheap pewter, which she scooped up and concealed in her muff. When she went shopping, the shop keepers would never allow their goods to be taken outside to her carriage for approval, although this was the normal practice for valued customers. If she wandered around a shop, it was usual to appoint one of the shop keeper's staff to accompany her. When she returned from a visit to a friend or a shop, her servants would gather any items that they didn't recognise as belonging to her, and would return them to their rightful owners with a note of apology. On one occasion, when leaving breakfast party, she coolly took a friend's carriage without permission, and kept it out the whole afternoon. On meeting the owner Lady Cork merely complained that the high steps of the carriage did not suit her short legs. She once made off with a live hedgehog in her handbag. Piers de Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall (creation of 1307) Gaveston was the favourite of King Edward II, but his rise to a position of nearly absolute power excited the jealousy of the nobility, who eventually revenged themselves upon him. It has never been established whether Gaveston and King Edward were lovers - different authors have argued for and against the homosexuality of both men. Although it is obviously no guide one way or the other, Edward was married to Isabella of France and had four legitimate children - King Edward III, John of Eltham (created Earl of Cornwall in 1330), Eleanor of Woodstock (who married the Count of Guelders) and Joan (who married King David II of Scotland), and one illegitimate son, Adam FitzRoy. The following account of Gaveston is taken from the November 1971 issue of the Australian monthly magazine \"Parade\":- 'Dusk was falling on June 19, 1312, as a grim little procession ascended the lonely, windswept slope of Blacklow Hill, not far from the great castle of the Earl of Warwick. In front rode Warwick himself followed by a troop of barons and their retainers. Amid them, lashed to his horse's saddle, was their prisoner - the most hated man in England. Once Piers Gaveston had jeeringly called the Earl of Warwick The Black Dog. And the Earl had sworn savagely in reply: \"Ere long you shall feel The Black Dog's teeth!\" 'Now the hour had come when the English barons would avenge the insults heaped upon them by the King's insolent swaggering foreign favourite. On the crest of the hill the cavalcade halted. A tree stump formed the block. One of Warwick's mail-clad soldiers was the executioner. The last rays of the sun glinted on the falling battle axe. Then the head of Piers Gaveston, with its scented locks and ruddy handsome face rolled down the slope into a thorn bush. 'The ill-starred story of Piers Gaveston and his infatuated royal master, Edward II, is one of the strangest in English medieval history. It began about the year 1300 when a penniless Gascon knight, Arnauld de Gaveston, arrived from France to seek his fortune at the court of King Edward I. With him came his son Piers, a robust and high-spirited youth whom the King decided would make an excellent companion for his own heir, the young Prince Edward. 'The king soon had cause to regret his decision, for Brother Perrot, as the prince called his comrade, quickly achieved a domination over Edward that nothing could shake. Frivolous, extravagant, devoted to peacock clothing, feasts and tournaments, the prince and his crony cared nothing for the wars in which the King was endlessly involved. 'The barons regarded the pair with brutal contempt. Gaveston replied by branding the proudest of them with nicknames that stung them to even greater fury. The surly Earl of Warwick was The Black Dog, the swarthy Earl of Pembroke was The Jew, the fat Earl of Lincoln was M'Sieu Burst Belly. Even the Earl of Lancaster, the King's nephew and richest and most powerful of the barons, did not escape. He was The Actor, The Fiddler or The Hog. 'Twice Prince Edward, terrified by the rages of his grim old father, had to agree to Gaveston being exiled. Then in 1307 he found himself free at last. In July, Edward I died during his final campaign against the Scots. Abandoning the war forthwith his son hurried back to London to be hailed as King Edward II. His first act as monarch was to recall his idolised Brother Perrot from his Flanders exile and defy the barons by loading him with titles, riches and honours. Gaveston was created Earl of Cornwall and became virtual chief of the royal council. He was granted huge estates and wed to Margaret de Claire, daughter of the King's kinsman, the Earl of Gloucester. 'Gaveston had been despised before. Now, with his spendthrift arrogance shielded by the King, he was \"more hated unto death than any man within the English realms.\" During Edward's coronation procession in February 1308, some of the wilder barons had to be restrained from dragging Gaveston from Westminster Abbey and hacking him to pieces with their swords. Shortly afterwards, at his manor of Wallingford, the favourite staged one of the costliest and most magnificent tournaments ever seen in medieval England. But the most warlike barons and knights were bitterly disappointed in their hopes of humiliating Gaveston before the eyes of King Edward and the lords and ladies of the court. A superb rider and athlete, Brother Perrot unhorsed one rival after another with his lance, usually flinging some mocking insult after them as they bit the dust. 'For the next year the barons raged in vain as they watched Gaveston cement his hold over the doting king. Men whispered that his mother had been burned as a witch in France and that he used black magic to make King Edward the helpless prisoner of his spells. He was reputed to be hand-in-glove with the great Italian moneylenders of Lombard Street, to whom the King owed such vast amounts that the country was virtually bankrupt. He was accused of filling the court with his greedy Gascon friends, as well as effeminate \"grooms, jugglers, jesters and singers\" to divert Edward from affairs of state. The King's wife, Queen Isabella, lamented that she was \"the most wretched of women\" because of Edward's slavish devotion to his swaggering favourite. 'Eventually it was the king's desperate need for money that forced him to yield to the barons' demand and get rid of Gaveston by appointing him viceroy in Ireland. Tearfully Edward rode to Bristol to bid farewell to his favourite as he sailed for Dublin, but secretly the King was determined to end the exile as soon as possible. His first move was to spread dissension among the barons and separate his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, from Warwick and the rest of Gaveston's more ruthless foes. Then, after making concessions to a meeting of Parliament at Stamford, Edward took the risk of recalling Gaveston from Ireland and openly restoring him to all his honours. 'The enforced sojourn in Dublin had taught Brother Perrot nothing. In July 1309 he returned to London more impudent, extravagant and bitter-tongued than ever. Ruled by Gaveston and his infatuated master the court became a sink of ceaseless junketings and scandals, while the exchequer, bled white by the royal debts, drifted rapidly towards disaster. Early in 1310, driven to desperation, the great nobles - led by Lancaster, Warwick, Lincoln, Pembroke and Arundel - met in council in the Painted Chamber of the Palace of Westminster. 'On Piers Gaveston they poured their pent-up rage. He had \"estranged the king's heart from his people,\" wasted the royal revenues and filled the court with his own creatures. The barons concluded by appointing 21 Lords Ordainers, headed by Lancaster and the Archbishop of Canterbury, to supervise the King's finances and purge his frivolous and vicious retinue. Furiously swearing that he would accept no \"bondage,\" Edward, taking Gaveston and his cronies with him, fled northward to York to set up his court remote from rebellious London. 'Both sides began gathering their forces. Then, with England on the brink of civil war, the despised and bankrupt monarch suddenly yielded. Leaving Gaveston for safety in Barnborough Castle, Edward gloomily retraced his steps to London to make the best bargain he could with the Lords Ordainers. It was a bitter pill he had to swallow. Parliament was to be summoned every year. The Ordainers were to fill every great State office and the King was reduced to a mere puppet of his kinsmen and nobility. Far more terrible to the weeping Edward was the edict condemning Piers Gaveston to perpetual banishment, with death as an outlaw if he ever trod English soil again. 'It was October 1311 before the King's resistance finally appeared to crumble. On All Saints' Day Gaveston took ship at Dover and sailed ostensibly for Flanders. Then, only two months later, the barons were staggered to learn that Edward had appeared during the Christmas revels at Windsor Castle with the jewel bedecked favourite once more on his arm. How he had returned to England no one knew, although it was rumoured that he had slipped ashore in Cornwall or Devon and ridden secretly straight back to Windsor. 'In any case war was now inevitable between the King and his barons, and the prize at stake was the perfumed head of Piers Gaveston. On January 7, 1312, Edward, Queen Isabella, Gaveston and a handful of loyal followers left Windsor and made for the north of England where the King hoped to muster his strength. A few weeks later Lancaster swooped over the Pennine Hills and almost trapped the King's little force before it could take to boats on the River Tyne. Abandoning Queen Isabella and the treasure chests, Edward and Gaveston sailed down the coast to Scarborough, where the towering cliff was crowned by one of England's mightiest fortresses. 'Scarborough was impregnable to attack and, since Gaveston was ill with fever, Edward decided to leave him there while he made a final effort to raise a royalist army. Everywhere he met only hostility and contempt. At last, exhausted and hopeless, Edward went to York to make a pitiful appeal to his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster. If the barons would solemnly swear to leave Gaveston unharmed the King would order him into exile forever. Glad to avoid a bloody civil war, Lancaster promptly agreed. 'On May 19, haunted by dread of his inveterate enemies, Gaveston yielded up Scarborough Castle and surrendered to the Earl of Pembroke, who was to escort him to London. By mid-June they had only advanced as far as Deddington in Oxfordshire, where Pembroke left his captive under guard in the village while he visited a nearby castle. And there nemesis, in the shape of the harsh and vengeful Black Dog, the Earl of Warwick, caught up with the ruined Piers Gaveston. 'One day Warwick and his retainers swept into Deddington, snatched Gaveston from his guards and carried him off to the earl's castle 30 miles away. After a grim mockery of a trial the man who had once ruled England was beheaded by a common soldier in the sunset on Blacklow Hill. The news plunged King Edward into such a frenzy of grief, for a time it seemed that his reason was threatened. However, he survived to continue a miserable reign dogged by scandals and disasters until his own macabre murder between the walls of Berkeley Castle 15 years later.' Charles Cornwallis, 3rd Baron Cornwallis Lord Cornwallis was tried before some of his fellow peers in 1678 [although the \"Complete Peerage\" says 1676] for the murder of a young man. The following account of his subsequent acquittal appears in \"A critical review of the state trials\" [London 1735]:- 'The Trial of Charles Lord Cornwallis, for Murder, before the Lord High Steward, and a certain Number of Peers commissioned to try him, in Westminster-Hall, 1678. 30 Car II. 'An Indictment was found by the Grand Jury of Middlesex, setting forth, That Charles Lord Cornwallis (together with Charles Gerrard and Edward Bourne) on the 18th of May [1678], then last past, did feloniously, and of his Malice afore-thought, make an Assault on the Person of Robert Clerk, in his Majesty's Palace of Whitehall, within the said County; and that the said Gerrard took up the said Clerk in his Arms, flung him down and broke his Neck, of which the said Clerk instantly died: And that the said Lord Cornwallis was present, aiding and abetting the said Charles Gerrard to commit the said Murder, and so was a Principal in it. 'A Soldier, who stood Centinel at the Bottom of the Stairs that led from the Gallery in Whitehall into the Park, that Night the Fact was committed, deposed, That on the 18th of May, between one and two in the Morning, the Lord Cornwallis and Mr. Gerrard, with three Footmen behind them, came from the said Gallery down the stairs into the Park, and demanding of him the Hour, he told them: but they being disordered in Drink, with many Oaths replied, he lyed, went by him into the Park, and swore they would kill somebody before they went away: That about an Hour after they returned to the Stairs, and he (the Centinel) demanding, Who comes there? They answered him in a very obscene rude Language, threatning to kill him, but he kept them off: Then one of them gave away his Sword, and swore he would kiss him, which he (the Centinel) refusing, they threatned him again, and seemed to contend which of them should run him through: At length, going up the Stairs, there came two young Lads to the Centinel, and one of them desired him (the Deponent) to call him early the next Morning, which my Lord Cornwallis and Gerrard hearing as they stood on the Top of the Stairs, they bid the Deponent shoot the Boy, and they would bear him out; and, on his refusing, one of them swore he would kick the Boy's Arse to Hell: To which the Boy made some Reply, wherein the word Arse was repeated: Whereupon one of the Gentlemen in a Rage run down the Stairs; and the Boy who spoke the Words getting away, the Gentleman took the other Boy up in his Arms, he crying out all the while, O my Lord it was not I! Indeed my Lord it was not I! and either by throwing him down on the Ground, or by a Blow, killed the Boy out-right. 'The Boy who spoke the Words, confirmed the Centinel's Evidence; but deposed, That he only said, Why kick my Arse to Hell? However the Gentlemen mistook his words. 'Two of Lord Cornwallis's Footmen, who had been indicted for the same Murder and acquitted by the Court of King's-Bench, were admitted to give Evidence in this Case, and deposed, That it was Mr. Gerrard that committed the Fact; and that my Lord Cornwallis remained at the Top of the Stairs, and ran away as soon as the Fact was done, for Fear of being knocked on the Head by the Soldiers. 'Mr. Solicitor General observed upon the Evidence, That it appeared, both my Lord and Mr. Gerrard had a murderous Intention, both of them swearing they would kill the Centinel: And as to the Murder that was actually committed, his Lordship was present at it, and had not given any Evidence that he disapproved of it, or endeavoured to prevent it; all which amounted to as much in Law, as if he had struck the Blow. 'Mr. Serjeant Maynard also observed, That his Lordship's being at some Distance would not excuse him, if he was engaged with Gerrard in an unlawful Design; and cited the Lord Dacre's Case [qv], who went into a Park with other Company to steal Deer; and though my Lord and some of them fled on the Keeper's Coming, yet the Keeper being killed afterwards, when his Lordship was without the Pales, and a Mile distant from the Place, yet he was adjudged guilty of Murder. 'The Lord Cornwallis said in his Defence, that he was indeed in Company with Mr. Gerrard that Night the Fact was committed, but that he had no ill Intention; and observed, that there was but one Witness who deposed, that both of them said they would kill the Centinel: That he was not conscious that he had any Hand in this Murder, and therefore he had not withdrawn himself; but trusting to his Innocence, surrendered to the Coroner the next Day, and now submitted to the Judgment of his Peers. 'The Prisoner being taken from the Bar, and the Lords withdrawn to consider of their Evidence, the Lords, about two Hours after, returned to their Seats, and desired to propose a Point of Law to the Judges: To which the Lord Steward answered, That the later and better opinion was, That such Questions ought to be put in the Presence of the Prisoner, that he might know whether the Case was justly stated: Whereupon the Prisoner was brought to the Bar again, and the following Question proposed to the Judges, (viz.) Whether those who were present, and contributed to any Disorders, whereupon a Manslaughter ensues, are as guilty of Manslaughter as he who is actually the Manslayer; as it is in Murder; where all, who are guilty of the Trespass which occasions it, are deemed equally guilty with him who commits the Fact? 'The Judges answered, The Case was the same in Manslaughter, as in Murder. 'The Lords withdrawing again, and returning into the Court after a short Recess, and the Lord High Steward demanding of them, in their Order, beginning with the youngest Baron, Whether the Lord Cornwallis was Guilty? Six of them declared him guilty of manslaughter; but a great Majority acquitted him; whereupon his Lordship was discharged: And the Lord High Steward breaking his Staff, the Court was dissolved. [The author then comments..] 'The Lords, no doubt, gave their Verdict according to their Judgment: They believed, I presume, that the Deceased was killed by Accident; but had this Noble Peer been tried by a Jury of Commoners, possibly he had not come off so well: For here were two Gentlemen declaring they would kill the Centinel, or some Body, and actually attacked the Soldier, who deposed, that it was with Difficulty he kept them off: Then, without any Provocation, one of them takes up an innocent Boy in his Arms, and throws him down with that Force that he killed him upon the Spot. What Denomination must we give this Fact? And whether it was my Lord or Gerrard that did it, only appears by the Evidence of his Lordship's Footmen, who were indicted as Accessories to the same Murder: and their Evidence was so well received, that it seems to have turned the Scale. 'Upon the whole, as the Case stands, a Commoner must be mad who does not avoid all Occasions of contending with a Noble Peer, since the least ill Language is held a sufficient Provocation to take away his Life.' The Countess of Cottenham, wife of the 4th Earl of Cottenham (7 Dec 1866-2 May 1913) The Countess was killed in a gun accident on 2 May 1913. She had been born Lady Rose Nevill, daughter of the 1st Marquess of Abergavenny and had married, as her second husband, the 4th Earl of Cottenham in 1899. The Earl, who was more than 7 years younger than his wife, was her first cousin, once removed. The following account of her death and the subsequent inquest appeared in 'The Scotsman' on 5 May 1913:- 'Lady Rose, daughter of the first Marquis of Abergavenny, and wife of Lord Cottenham, died under particularly tragic circumstances at Elvendon, South Oxfordshire, on Friday. The sad story of her death was not known outside the family until Saturday morning, and was narrated at the inquest held in the afternoon by Mr. Cooper, the Coroner for the district. 'On Friday afternoon the dead body of the Countess was found by her husband, the Earl of Cottenham, in a wood above Elvendon Priory, the family seat, near Goring-on-Thames. The chest had been pierced by a bullet, and a double-barrelled sporting gun lay a few feet away from the body. 'The scene of the tragedy is a pretty corner of South Oxfordshire, sprinkled with low-lying and well-wooded hills. Elvendon Priory, the charming country mansion, lies in a peaceful, sheltered spot, on either side of which rise the woods. Here, in this secluded countryside, and a few hundred yards from her charmingly picturesque home, the Countess met her death. 'On Friday morning the Countess's three boys were with their mother, but the school vacation had drawn to an end, and they left the Priory for Reigate School. After lunch on Friday Lord Cottenham saw his boys off, and accompanied them as far as Reading. It was at this time, and about two o'clock in the afternoon, that the Countess, so far as can be ascertained, took her sporting gun, and proceeded to the woods above the house, apparently with the intention of spending the time before her husband's return in shooting. She was a good shot with the gun and the rifle, and frequently found such recreation in the preserves of the Priory. 'What happened subsequently remains unknown. In the course of the afternoon, when Lord Cottenham returned, he was surprised to find his wife absent. In the meantime, accompanied by his gardener, his Lordship proceeded towards the woods for the purpose of inspecting a new path. It was while making his way there that Lord Cottenham made the terrible discovery, finding the dead body of his wife lying in a clearing of the woods against the stump of a tree. Her gun lay a few feet off. There was no indication of a struggle, and not the faintest clue to suggest how the Countess came by her fatal injuries. The ground at this part is rough and hilly, and a spot where care in walking is necessary. 'Lady Cottenham, who was 46 years of age, was married when 21 to Mr. John Blundell Leigh. She was divorced in 1899, but in the same year married the fourth Earl of Cottenham. Of this marriage there were three sons. The Countess and her husband took up residence at Elverdon Priory some five years ago, but they lived in retirement more or less during that time, seldom taking part in any of the social functions in the county. [This is probably a polite way of saying that, after the scandal of Lady Cottenham's divorce from her first husband, she was ostracized by Society]. 'The Coroner for the district was only apprised of the sad occurrence on Saturday morning, but at one o'clock in the afternoon the jury had been called and the inquest opened in the old- fashioned but artistic dining-room of the Priory. 'The Earl of Cottenham was the first witness called into the dining-room, already closely crowded with the jurymen, a number of pressmen, and county police. 'His Lordship said he had identified the body as that of his wife, whom he had last seen at 1.25 p.m. on Friday. \"At that time,\" he said, \"I went as far as Reading to see my boys off to school at Reigate. I returned here at 3.15. I did not see Lady Cottenham about, and went to look for her. Afterwards I went to the wood to look at a path which the workmen had been improving, and before I got fifty yards I found the body lying on the left side. There was a gun pointing away, and lying five or six yards away from her.\" 'The Coroner - Before you went out, was Lady Cottenham in her usual spirits, and quite cheerful? - Yes. 'What was she doing in the morning before lunch? - Oh, running about with the boys, as it was their last day at home. She was doing some gardening. We laughed a great deal at luncheon, wishing to make it as cheerful as possible for the boys on their last day. 'The Coroner then read a number of letters which had been written by deceased on Friday. He read them over, and said they only contained what would be written in the ordinary personal and friendly manner. They dealt for the most part with future engagements. \"I give you these details,\" he said, \"to show that yesterday at this time Lady Cottenham was in her normal state of health.\" 'Lord Cottenham,proceeding, said - \"The first thing I did on finding the body was to send for the police and a doctor.\" Lady Cottenham, he added, had been accustomed to shooting for thirteen years. 'William Tappin, the gardener in the employ of Lord Cottenham, who was the next witness, said he was with Lady Cottenham in the garden in the morning prior to the tragedy. He last saw her ladyship at 12.15 p.m. She gave him instructions in the ordinary way, and there was nothing unusual in either her appearance or her manner. Witness went out with Lord Cottenham in the afternoon after his master had returned from Reading. They went into the woods together to see what the workmen had done. On entering the wood his Lordship was the first to see the Countess. They at once proceeded to where she was lying. Her body was out straight and was on its left side. The gun was about six feet from her, and the muzzle was turned towards the top of the hill. 'To a juror witness replied, \"I could see the Countess was dead when I went to her.\" 'Sergeant H.T. Couling, stationed at Goring, said he received information of the tragedy at five o'clock on Friday. Witness proceeded to the wood, where he found the last witness standing beside the body. He examined the gun, and found that the right barrel was empty, while the left barrel contained a live cartridge. Their were two other cartridges in her Ladyship's pocket. The gun was a 20-bore ejector. After Dr. Evans had examined the body it was brought down to the house. 'Dr. Herbert Evans, of Goring, said he examined the body and observed that the charge had entered under the left breast and emerged in the left back. It was apparent that the gun was discharged at close quarters. The wound alone caused death, although the bullet did not quite touch the heart. So far as witness could make out, the body must have lain for over an hour before the discovery was made. The left fifth rib had been pierced. 'The Coroner pointed out to the witness that the jury had viewed the spot, and he suggested from their observations that the deceased was able to move a little away from the spot at which she was shot and propped herself against a tree. To this suggestion witness agreed. 'In reply to a juror, Dr. Evans said the wound was so small that the gun must have been quite close to the body. 'Lord Henry Nevill, a brother of the deceased, who was then called, said he had come down to Elvendon on being told of the tragedy. He was at Elvendon a week ago, and on that occasion he found Lady Cottenham in a cheerful state. She was looking forward to visiting witness at his home at Eridge Castle, Suffolk, and was also anticipating a visit to her father's place at Abergavenny. Lady Cottenham was very fond of shooting, added witness, and was a good shot with both the gun and the rifle. She was in the habit of going into the wood to shoot. Lord Henry observed that ladies did not generally carry or handle a gun in the same way a man would. 'Sergeant Couling, recalled, said Lady Cottenham wore a gold watch set with stones when her body was found. She carried a purse, but it did not contain any money. There was not the slightest appearance of anything having been stolen from her Ladyship. 'The Coroner then proceeded to sum up, and addressing the jury said the evidence was very simple indeed. It was quite obvious that in the morning Lady Cottenham wrote ordinary friendly and business letters. \"There is not the faintest evidence in the world,\" he said, \"that she was in anything but a perfectly happy state at the time.\" It was clear from the evidence that what must have happened was that her Ladyship slipped, and was carrying her gun in an insecure position. The gun must have fired accidentally and shot her in the left breast. \"She had just enough strength to move a little and go to the tree\", added the Coroner, \"and I do not suppose that she lived more than a few minutes afterwards. I think you will all agree with me that there is no evidence to suggest anything in the world except death by the unfortunate accident of the gun going off.\" 'The jury, without retiring, returned a verdict of \"Death by misadventure, caused through the firing of the gun which Lady Cottenham carried.\" James Richard Neville Stopford, 7th Earl of Courtown The 7th Earl died following a fall from a train, as reported in \"The Irish Times\" of 26 January 1957:- The 79-year-old seventh Earl of Courtown died in hospital yesterday after falling from a train on Thursday night near Great Missenden Station, Buckinghamshire. The Earl, who lived at Redberry House, Bierton, Aylesbury, was travelling home, and just after the train left Great Missenden the fireman noticed a compartment door open. The train was stopped and the door closed. At Aylesbury the compartment searched and Lord Courtown's umbrella and briefcase were found. A search of the track was made and Lord Courtown was found by the stationmaster and two platelayers. 'James Richard Neville Stopford succeeded his father, who once owned over 23,000 acres in Ireland, in 1933. He had held a number of company directorships. He was decorated as a monthly magazine \"Parade\":- 'King George II once gallantly asked the celebrated Irish beauty Maria Gunning, Countess of Coventry, whether she was satisfied with all the sights she had seen since coming to London. \"I like them very well, sir,\" said Maria with a simper. \"But they have so far lacked what I should enjoy most exceedingly - a coronation.\" The attendant courtiers held their breaths. His Majesty's pale blue eyes bulged apoplectically. Then he stamped one gouty foot and burst into a roar of laughter that nearly choked him. Like the rest of her admirers King George found it quite impossible to be angry with the bewitching Maria, even in her most outrageously tactless moments. Hailed by contemporaries as \"beyond compare the loveliest woman in England,\" the Countess of Coventry certainly had strong claims to be also the vainest and most scatter- brained beauty of her day. 'Both the Gunning sisters, daughters of a disreputable and impoverished Irish squire, blazed like meteors across the fashionable London world of the 1750s. Elizabeth wed two dukes in succession. Maria had to be content with snaring a solitary earl, though in her brief, glittering heyday she counted her lovers by the score. Then at 27 Maria, Countess of Coventry was dead - leaving a legend in which romance, pathos and the darkening shadows of scandal were strangely mixed. Officially it was consumption that killed her. But incorrigible vanity hastened her end, the vanity that plastered her face with poisons in fruitless efforts to preserve her withering beauty. 'Maria Gunning was born in 1733 and her sister, Elizabeth, one year later in the small manor house of Hemingford Grey, near Huntingdon. Their father, John Gunning of Castle Coote in County Roscommon, was an amiable, drunken spendthrift who had been forced to pledge his Irish estates to his creditors and seek refuge in England. However, the sisters were taken back to Dublin as children and reared by their mother in genteel poverty, assisted by some of their wealthier relatives. Mrs. Gunning had one aim - to marry the dowerless girls off as quickly and advantageously as possible. And as they grew up, nature proved a powerful ally. In their early teens Maria and Elizabeth were already the talk of Dublin society as a pair of precocious beauties around whom admirers swarmed \"like bees around the earliest flowers of spring.\" Unfortunately, few of the amorous bees buzzed with honourable intentions, and on one occasion and on one occasion the assault on the sisters' virtue ended in a sensational riot outside the Dublin theatre. Maria and Elizabeth had indiscreetly accepted a supper invitation from some stage-door rakes who drugged their wine, then bundled them into a coach to drive to a retreat in the suburbs. The girls were rescued in the street by a party of actors from the play-house, but the incident gravely increased Mrs. Gunning's doubts about ever seeing them suitably wed. 'Meanwhile, the 16-year-old Maria decided to exploit her budding charms on the stage, especially when the famous Irish actress Peg Woffington arrived from London for a season at the Dublin theatre. The plan came to nothing, though the star's friendship proved of practical value when, in October 1749, Mrs. Gunning determined that her daughters must appear at the viceroy's annual ball to celebrate the birthday of King George. Too poor to buy new dresses fit for the grand ballroom in Dublin Castle, the girls appealed to the sympathetic Peg Woffington to help them from her enormous wardrobe. The result was stunning. Guests clambered on chairs and gamblers deserted the card tables to see the beautiful Misses Gunning make their entrance decked in costumes of \"unexampled richness.\" Only a few cynical theatregoers remarked that Maria bore a strong resemblance to Lady Macbeth and Elizabeth an equally striking likeness to Juliet in the current playhouse repertoire. 'Her confidence restored, Mrs. Gunning now decided to quit provincial Dublin and launch her daughters on the English matrimonial market, where the prizes in riches and titles were incomparably greater. By the middle of 1750, Squire Gunning's tattered fortunes having taken a slight turn for the better, the family was installed in London and the campaign had begun. Its success exceeded even Mrs. Gunning's wildest hopes. Never before had London society lost its head so completely as over the two \"Irish beauties.\" Everywhere the sisters went - to the opera, St. James Park, the pleasure gardens of Vauxhall and Ranelagh - they were followed by swarms of gallants vying for a single glance. Newspapers printed rapturous poems about them. Shops sold thousands of ballads and engravings. Cheering mobs trooped behind their coach in the streets. 'In December 1750 the sisters were presented to King George II at St. James's Palace, and a few months an invitation to the Duchess of Bedford's ball in Bloomsbury Square set the seal on their social triumph. Connoisseurs generally regarded Maria as the lovelier of the pair and she was certainly more celebrated for her vanity and shameless coquettishness than her slightly more sedate sister. 'Around Maria gathered some of the most notorious libertines of the day, led by the \"universal rake\" Tom Medlicott, who was reputed to have a mistress in every London parish \"and a few for his friends besides.\" Medlicott wagered his coffee house cronies that he would take only a month to add Maria Gunning to his list of conquests. But he was disappointed. Maria had her eye on more important game. Among her most ardent pursuers were Viscount Bolingbroke and the youthful Earl of Coventry, either of whom had much more to offer. However, though both Bolingbroke and Coventry were eager to acquire the luscious Miss Gunning as a mistress, neither was anxious to acquire the penniless young woman as a wife. For months the comedy went on, Maria brazenly encouraging one aristocratic lover after another and stubbornly repulsing every proposal short of matrimony. 'Ironically, her more demure sister, Elizabeth, was the first to reach the goal, with a brilliant and romantic capture exceeding even the girls' dreams. At a masked ball at the Opera House in January 1752 Elizabeth found herself haunted by a haggard, dissipated-looking young man to whom everyone seemed to pay great deference. He was, it transpired, the Duke of Hamilton, the proudest and wealthiest peer in Scotland, who had recently been jilted by the notorious wanton Elizabeth Chudleigh. The duke, who for months had been trying to forget his humiliation in a frantic round of drink and debauchery, saw Elizabeth Gunning and was instantly infatuated. One month later London society was staggered to learn that the pair had secretly slipped away from a ball at Chesterfield House and been married at midnight by an obliging Mayfair parson. 'With her sister a duchess, Maria could afford to take an even haughtier tone with her suitors and it took Lord Coventry only three weeks to surrender to her terms. On March 3, 1752, Maria Gunning became Countess of Coventry, little knowing how short-lived her triumph was to prove. For the moment, however, she was mistress of the magnificent estate of Croome Park in Worcestershire, a great London mansion, and a husband who, after a few jealous outbursts, resignedly let her seek her amorous pleasures where she would. Safely married, she could now be kinder to the gallants who escorted her around the London scene. How many lovers she had nobody could discover, though gossip linked her with some of the most famous noblemen of the court of King George. 'At the same time stories of her incredible vanity, frivolity and tactlessness were a source of endless entertainment in salons and coffee houses. The countess was reputed to spend £2500 a year on cosmetics, including powders, paints, perfumes and strange plasters compounded of white lead, arsenic and other unsavoury ingredients. Her vanity reached its grotesque peak after an incident when she was walking with her escort one summer's evening in St. James's Park. As usual. a gaping mob was trailing along behind her when someone suddenly shouted, \"Kitty Fisher!\" the name of a notorious and expensive prostitute of the day [and whose name is immortalised in the nursery rhyme Lucy Locket - \"Lucy Locket lost her pocket, Kitty Fisher found it...\"]. A scuffle broke out in the crowd. Maria's escorts drew their swords and plunged into the fray and for a moment bloodshed threatened until the mob dispersed and fled. When King George heard of the event he growled, half angry and half amused: \"I cannot have my prettiest subject insulted thus. Next time she walks in the park let her have a guard of soldiers.\" Taking the order with intense seriousness Maria insisted on being provided with her retinue of redcoats before she took another evening airing in the park a week later. To the cheers and derision of the crowd she and her party appeared with two sergeants marching in front of them and a dozen sheepish soldiers armed with muskets bringing up the rear. 'Meanwhile, aided by her own indiscreet tongue, darker scandals gathered round the head of the Countess of Coventry until her reputation was described as \"somewhat tainted.\" Her sister, Elizabeth, widowed by the premature death of the Duke of Hamilton, had hoped to wed the Duke of Bridgewater, but the match was broken off because Bridgewater objected to the ill name of his future sister-in-law. However, Elizabeth was not cheated of a second duke, for she shortly afterwards married the less fussy Lord Lorne, who was eventually to succeed to the dukedom of Argyll. 'Before that happened, Maria was in her grave, struck down by consumption whose first dread signs appeared in 1759 when she had barely reached her 26th birthday. In the next year she grew steadily worse, pathetically trying to conceal her ravaged face behind layers of plaster laced with arsenic and other poisons. In June 1760 she retired to Croome Park, lying in a permanently darkened room so that the gaunt mockery of her once dazzling beauty was concealed. Sometimes she peered sadly for hours at her dimly visible reflection in a hand mirror. She was holding the mirror in one bony hand when she died on 30 September 1760.' George William Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst, son of the 9th Earl of Coventry (15 Nov 1865 - 8 Aug 1927) Note that Burke's Peerage states that Viscount Deerhurst died on 8 August 1928 - this is incorrect - he died 8 August 1927. As a young man, Deerhurst was appointed aide-de-camp to the Governor of Victoria (Sir Henry Loch, later 1st Baron Loch). During his time in that post he found himself in court as a result of an altercation with a bookmaker to whom he allegedly owed money. The following report is taken from 'The South Australian Advertiser' of 11 March 1887:- 'There was a very numerous assemblage in the [Melbourne] District Court to-day, when the charge of assault, preferred by Robert Sutton, the bookmaker, against Lord Deerhurst, aide- de-camp to Sir Henry Loch, and a counter-charge by Lord Deerhurst against Mr. Sutton, came on for hearing. Both were represented by leading counsel. From the statements made it appeared that the parties met at the Hurlingham pigeon shooting ground, and the result of the betting was that Lord Deerhurst owed Mr. Sutton £281 at the end of the day. Some time elapsed, and the money not being forthcoming, negotiations were entered into for an arrange- ment, but there was a disagreement. Mr. Sutton brought the matter under the notice of the Victorian Club, informing Viscount Deerhurst of the fact, upon which the latter wrote to the former that he could \"post him and be damned.\" As to this Mr. Sutton wrote that he would wait upon Lord Deerhurst personally, and then the money was paid into the club and handed over to Mr. Sutton. Subsequently the pair met in the National Hotel, Bourke-street, where an altercation took place about the letter, Sutton telling Lord Deerhurst he would \"not be damned by anybody,\" and that he must apologise or leave the hotel. The lord replied that he would do neither, and that as a captain in her Majesty's police force he would arrest Mr. Sutton, at the same time taking hold of the latter by the shoulder. Mr. Sutton then drew his hand across Lord Deerhurst's mouth. The matter then came before the Victorian Club, when Mr. Sutton was expelled. While in the box the bookmaker admitted his real name was Robert Stanley Sevior, acknowledged that he had been divorced from his wife for adultery and cruelty, but denied that he seduced and took away a Tasmanian young lady. At the conclusion of the evidence the court dismissed the case against Deerhurst, but convicted Mr. Sutton of assault, and being of opinion that a fine would be no punishment ordered him to be imprisoned for 14 days. Upon Sutton being called upon he failed to appear, and an appeal has been entered against the decision.' Richard Francis Wellesley, 6th Earl Cowley The 6th Earl died in December 1975 while playing a game of squash. At the time of his death, his widow was expecting their second child. Since their first child was a daughter, who could not inherit the title, the peerage technically became dormant during the period between the death of the 6th Earl and the birth of the second child. If this second child had been a male, he would have inherited the title from birth, in the same manner as the 9th Earl of Chichester. In the event, however, a girl was born, and the peerage passed to the 6th Earl's uncle."
