Already in 1977, while he was in London for a Commonwealth conference, he was deposed in a coup, being described by the coup leaders as a \"dictator\" who had \"adopted a style of life which involves lavish spending\" and had not spent more than three consecutive weeks in his country since independence. Mancham said that much of his extensive foreign travel had been spent in aid negotiations. Prime Minister France-Albert René, who denied complicity in the plot but was probably its mastermind, then became president. Not allowed to return to Seychelles, Mancham engaged in private business but again turned to politics in 1990 as founder of the Crusade for the Restoration of Democracy in Seychelles. (Having been awarded an honorary knighthood in 1976, he became entitled to use the \"Sir\" after adopting British nationality in 1984.) Returning from British exile in 1992, he became leader of the revived SDP (1992-2005) and leader of the opposition (1993-98). He was a presidential candidate in 1993 and 1998 but was defeated by René.\n\nManchego Muñoz, Celestino (b.

With Oliver Tambo, he founded the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League in 1944. He soon became one of the ANC's leaders. He was given a nine-month sentence for his political activities in 1952, and eventually went on trial for treason in 1956 (acquitted 1961). After police opened fire on unarmed Africans in Sharpeville in 1960, and the ANC was banned, Mandela began advocating controlled violence. He clandestinely went abroad in 1962 to seek support elsewhere in Africa and in Britain. On his return home he was arrested. He was sentenced first to five years' imprisonment in November 1962, and was given a life sentence on June 12, 1964. Incarcerated at Robben Island Prison until 1982 and then at the maximum-security Pollsmoor Prison until 1988, he came to symbolize the struggle against apartheid. The South African government under Pres. F.W. de Klerk finally released Mandela on Feb. 11, 1990. On March 2 he was chosen deputy president of the relegalized ANC, and he replaced Tambo as president in July 1991. In 1993 Mandela and de Klerk were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end apartheid and bring about a peaceful transition to nonracial democracy in South Africa. In April 1994 Mandela was elected president of South Africa in the country's first all-race elections. He introduced a redevelopment and construction program designed to improve the living standards of the country's majority black population; the program emphasized housing and education. He stepped down as ANC leader in December 1997 and retired from active politics after the end of his presidential term. His second wife (1958-96) Winnie Madikizela-Mandela herself became a political figure; after divorcing her, he married Graça Machel, widow of former president of Mozambique Samora Machel, in 1998.\n\nMandela, Winnie: see Madikizela-Mandela, Winnie.\n\nMandela, Zindzi(swa) (b.

Manley\n\nManley, John (Paul) (b. Jan. 5, 1950, Ottawa, Ont.), Canadian politician. He first ran for parliament in 1988 when the Liberals were in opposition and was critic for the portfolios of science, finance, and transportation. He represented the electoral district of Ottawa South. He was appointed industry minister in 1993 and foreign minister in 2000. Aides credited Manley with making the work of the industry ministry much more focused and on insisting on the need to pay more attention to the booming high-technology industry. Manley's willingness to put himself on the line for the party was shown best in January 2000, when he was forced to make a humiliating about-turn over whether Ottawa would bail out the country's six top-level professional ice hockey teams. Although sports had nothing to do with his portfolio Manley agreed to look into the viability of the clubs and then announced that the government would give them a total of C$20 million (U.S.$13 million) a year. But the decision unleashed howls of protest and just three days later a chastened Manley announced the plan was dead. His rowback prompted many to write off his chances of ever replacing Prime Minister Jean Chrétien but he soon bounced back and within weeks was even making fun of himself over the controversy. Manley's only other real brush with controversy came in September 1997 when he suggested Canada should ditch the monarchy; protests from cabinet colleagues quickly forced him to drop the idea. The low-profile Manley had shown no obvious interest in foreign affairs although he had won respect for his considered, if stolid, approach. Manley, who sat firmly on the right wing of the Liberal Party, was much more of a cabinet team player than his high-profile predecessor Lloyd Axworthy. In 2002 he was first promoted to deputy prime minister and then took the additional post of finance minister. He retired in 2003.\n\nM. Manley\n\nManley, Michael (Norman) (b. Dec. 10, 1924, St. Andrew, Jamaica - d. March 6, 1997, Kingston, Jamaica), prime minister of Jamaica (1972-80, 1989-92); son of Norman Manley. In the 1950s he became involved in the trade-union movement, gaining recognition as a skilled negotiator. He was given an appointed senator's seat in 1962 and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1967. He succeeded his father as president of the People's National Party in 1969. He defeated the Labour Party to become prime minister in 1972 and was reelected in 1976. From 1972 to 1975 he was also foreign minister. In his first two terms as prime minister, the popular Manley was a firebrand socialist and champion of the nonaligned movement. A powerful orator, he was often called \"Joshua,\" after the Old Testament prophet. He forged close ties with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, railed against capitalist domination, and discouraged foreign investment. In 1973 he was one of the founders of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom). By the end of 1980, Jamaica was nearly bankrupt and Manley was defeated by conservative Edward Seaga, who became the Reagan administration's closest ally in the Caribbean. In 1989, a new Manley emerged. Though he still claimed to be a socialist, the anti-imperialist rhetoric was gone, along with his trademark bush jacket. He espoused private investment and good relations with the United States. Helped by a worsening economy, he trounced Seaga in national elections. He then pursued free-market policies and privatized many state-owned enterprises. Manley said he had learned from his mistakes. But he never toned down his tendency to speak out when he felt it was necessary. Citing health reasons, he quit as prime minister in 1992.\n\nN. Manley\n\nManley, Norman (Washington) (b. July 4, 1893, Roxborough, Manchester parish, Jamaica - d. Sept. 2, 1969, St. Andrew, Jamaica), chief minister (1955-59) and prime minister (1959-62) of Jamaica; cousin of Sir Alexander Bustamante. He began his political career after the Jamaican labour riots of 1938 by founding the People's National Party (September 1938). In 1944 he ran unsuccessfully for the legislative assembly, but five years later he won. He took the post of chief minister after his party's first electoral victory in 1955 and became the first premier of Jamaica in 1959. His administration was credited with stimulating industrial growth, attracting much foreign capital, and achieving significant gains in agrarian reform and education. He was also a pioneer in the movement to establish a West Indies federation and developed the West Indies Federal Labour Party. The federation came into being in 1958, but a strong anti-federalist movement began in Jamaica, based on fears that Jamaica would have to support the rest of the federation; a referendum was held in 1961 and a majority decided against continued membership, a result Manley accepted with regret. His government was defeated in elections in 1962, and he became leader of the opposition. He campaigned again in Jamaica's first post-independence election, in 1967, but was unsuccessful. He retired from politics early in 1969.\n\nManly, Charles (b. May 13, 1795, Chatham county, N.C. - d. May 1, 1871, Raleigh, N.C.), governor of North Carolina (1849-51).\n\nB. Mann\n\nE.

July 27, 1951), governor of Skaraborg (1935-51).\n\nMannerheim, Carl Erik greve (b. Dec. 14, 1759, Säter socken, Kopparberg [now Dalarna], Sweden - d. Jan. 15, 1837, Åbo [Turku], Finland), governor of Åbo och Björneborg (1816-22) and chief minister of Finland (1822-26); son-in-law of Ernst Gustaf friherre von Willebrand. He was made a count (greve/kreivi) in the Finnish nobility in 1824.\n\nMannerheim\n\nMannerheim, Carl Gustaf (Emil friherre) (friherre in Finnish vapaaherra) (b. June 4, 1867, Villnäs [Askainen; now part of Masku municipality], Finland - d. Jan. 27, 1951, Lausanne, Switzerland), president of Finland (1944-46); grandson of Carl Gustaf greve Mannerheim. He entered the Russian army in 1889 as a lieutenant in the cavalry and rose to the rank of lieutenant general and corps commander. After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in November 1917 he returned to Finland, which declared its independence from Russia. He assumed command of the \"White\" (anti-Bolshevik) forces in January 1918 during the Finnish Civil War and, with the aid of German forces, defeated the Finnish Bolsheviks and expelled Russian forces in a bloody four-month campaign. He became regent of Finland in December 1918, holding this post for seven months (during which he signed his name Kustaa Mannerheim) until a republic was declared in 1919. Defeated in the first presidential election in July 1919, he mostly retired from public life until he became chairman of the national defense council (1931-39); during his tenure Finland constructed the Mannerheim Line of fortifications across the Karelian Isthmus facing Leningrad. In 1933 he was given the rank of field marshal. When Soviet forces attacked Finland in December 1939, he served as commander in chief, and his brilliant leadership won considerable successes against vast numerical superiority, but the end result was defeat, resulting in a relatively harsh peace settlement in 1940. Hoping to win back some territory, Finland successfully joined Nazi Germany in its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. He was named the only Marshal of Finland in June 1942. But as Russian strength grew and Germany weakened, his troops were forced to retreat. He was named president in August 1944 and signed an armistice with the Soviets in September, which ultimately led to a peace treaty by which Finland was forced to make concessions more extensive than those made in 1940. He remained president until ill health forced his retirement in 1946.\n\nMannerheim, Carl Gustaf greve (b. Aug. 10, 1797, Villnäs [Askainen; now part of Masku municipality], Finland - d. Oct. 9, 1854, Stockholm, Sweden), governor of Vasa (1832-34) and Viborg (1834-39); son of Carl Erik greve Mannerheim. He was also known as an entomologist.\n\nManning, Daniel (b. May 16, 1831, Albany, N.Y. - d. Dec. 24, 1887, Albany), U.S. treasury secretary (1885-87).\n\nE.C. Manning\n\nManning, Ernest C(harles) (b. Sept. 20, 1908, Carnduff, Sask. - d. Feb. 19, 1996, Calgary, Alta.), premier of Alberta (1943-68). As a young man he studied under the charismatic evangelist William Aberhart, the founder of the populist Social Credit political movement. After Aberhart's Social Credit Party captured 56 of 63 seats in the 1935 election, Aberhart became premier and Manning joined the cabinet as provincial secretary. When Aberhart died in 1943, Manning was elected party leader and premier. Reelected seven consecutive times, he served for 25 years while concurrently enjoying a career as an evangelist on radio, where he was heard weekly on the North American broadcast of \"Back to the Bible Hour.\" He was credited with guiding the province through the Great Depression and shaping it into a model of economic prosperity, in part owing to the discovery of a major oil field at Leduc in 1947 and his innovative rules concerning the proper management of petroleum reserves. That allowed him to expand social services while maintaining the lowest taxes in Canada. He was a Canadian senator from 1970 to 1983.\n\nPatrick Manning\n\nManning, Patrick (Augustus Mervyn) (b. Aug. 17, 1946, San Fernando, Trinidad - d. July 2, 2016, San Fernando), prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago (1991-95, 2001-10). He was also minister of information and Tobago affairs (1980-81), industry, commerce, and consumer affairs (1981), and energy and natural resources (1981-86). He was leader of the People's National Movement from 1987 to 2010.\n\nPreston Manning\n\nManning, (Ernest) Preston (b. June 10, 1942, Edmonton, Alta.), Canadian politician; son of Ernest C. Manning. He followed in his father's footsteps as a populist and an evangelical Christian fundamentalist and gave sermons on the elder's radio program. He ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Social Credit Party in the 1965 federal election. He returned to the political arena in 1987. In May, delegates of the Reform Association of Canada voted to create a new federal political party. The Reform Party of Canada was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in October, and Manning, a key organizer of the association, was elected leader of the party. The Reform Party grew out of the feeling of alienation prevalent in Canada's western provinces, and its aim was to advance the interests of western Canada by sending members of parliament to Ottawa. The slogan was \"The West Wants In,\" and the purpose was to pursue economic and political equality for the West within Canada. In 1991, however, the party changed its focus to that of a national party that would organize across Canada. The slogan became \"Building a New Canada,\" and the party aimed to place all provinces on an equal footing within the nation. In 1993 he was voted into parliament for the riding of Calgary Southwest. In the 1997 general election, the Reform Party received 19% of the popular vote and won 60 seats in the House of Commons. Thus, barely 10 years after its founding, it had risen from a western fringe party to become the official opposition, with Manning becoming leader of the opposition. Although the party was disappointed that no party candidates were elected outside the western provinces, it expected that the strong showing of the party would give the Canadian West a greater voice in the federal government. In 2000 the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance and he lost a leadership vote to Stockwell Day. He resigned from parliament in 2002.\n\nManning, John L(aurence) (b.

He built a solid reputation in the House of Representatives for a decade (1943-53) before moving to the Senate, where he became assistant Democratic leader under the tutelage of majority leader Lyndon B. Johnson in 1957. Four years later, Mansfield became Senate majority leader when Johnson became vice president under Pres. John F. Kennedy in 1961. He held the post for 16 years - longer than anyone in Senate history. While a close associate of Johnson, Mansfield was one of the most vocal critics of America's role in the Vietnam War. He was also instrumental in establishing a Senate committee that investigated the Watergate scandal that proved Richard Nixon's downfall. Mansfield's career in the Senate included membership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was a strong advocate for national health insurance and played a leading role in lowering the voting age to 18 and in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Nov. 15, 1889, Lisbon, Portugal - d. July 2, 1932, Twickenham, London, England), king of Portugal (1908-10). He was the younger son of King Carlos and Queen Maria Amalia. On Feb. 1, 1908, Carlos and his elder son, Luís Filipe, were assassinated by anarchists in the streets of Lisbon; Manuel (then known as the Duque de Beja), who was in the same carriage and was wounded in the arm by one of the bullets, unexpectedly found himself king at the age of 18. The dictatorial prime minister João Franco resigned, and Manuel asked Adm. Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral to head a government composed of equal numbers of the two main parties, the Regenerators and the Progressists, with one or two others. Amaral proceeded with elections in Lisbon, which the republicans won. They intensified preparations for a revolution, while the monarchist parties formed ineffective coalitions, alternately advising the young king and blaming him for taking their advice. In the summer of 1910 Manuel went to Buçaco, but on his return a revolution, supported by the fleet on the Tagus River, broke out. His palace was shelled, and Manuel fled into exile. The republic was proclaimed, and Manuel settled near London, at Richmond and later at Twickenham. Although he never abdicated officially, he took no action to regain his throne.

In 1925 he became aware of the revolutionary potential inherent in the peasantry, and in 1927 he embarked on a new type of revolutionary warfare in the countryside in which the Red Army would play the central role. He became chairman of the Chinese Soviet Republic founded in Kiangsi (Jiangxi) province in 1931, but it was unable to stand up against Chiang Kai-shek's elite units, and in 1934 the Red Army set out for the northwest of China, on what is known as the Long March, during which Mao was chosen leader of the party (Jan. 8, 1935); he formally became chairman in March 1943.

However, his reputation was tainted by coups that tore the country apart in 1987 and again in 2000. His tenure ended abruptly during the 2000 coup, when he was forced to resign.

March 15, 1942, Pirne village, near Burgas, Bulgaria), Bulgarian politician. He entered politics as deputy culture minister in the first post-Communist caretaker government in 1991. He later became culture minister. As Bulgarian Socialist Party candidate he trailed a humiliating 17 points behind Petur Stoyanov after the first round of presidential elections in 1996. A little-known scholar of Thracian mythology, Marazov had been drawn into the presidential race on a joint ticket with Foreign Minister Georgi Pirinski, whose candidacy was rejected because he was born in the United States. He modeled himself on other East European intellectuals who became heads of state after the fall of Communism in 1989. He prefered open-necked shirts and sweaters to the formal wear of party functionaries, but diligently attended party rallies commemorating dates in Communist history and spoke nostalgically of the low prices in pre-1989 Bulgaria and lost Russian markets for Bulgaria's lacklustre industrial goods. His \"Together for Bulgaria\" campaign had the difficult task of appealing equally to the Socialists' two main constituencies - private entrepreneurs and older voters nostalgic for the security of the former one-party regime.\n\nMarback, Guilherme Carneiro da Rocha (b.

He was also interim minister of worship (1879).\n\nMarchais\n\nMarchais, Georges (René Louis) (b. June 7, 1920, La Hoguette, Calvados, France - d. Nov. 16, 1997, Paris, France), French politician. He joined the Communist Party in 1947, became a member of the central committee in 1956 and of the Politburo in 1959 and organizational secretary in 1961. He effectively took over as party leader in 1970 when General Secretary Waldeck Rochet fell ill, and was formally named to the top post on Rochet's death two years later. In 1972, with Socialist leader François Mitterrand and Left Radical leader Robert Fabre, he developed a joint electoral platform between the leftist parties in France. He won a seat in the National Assembly from the Val-de-Marne département outside Paris in March 1973 and was continually reelected thereafter. He supported Mitterrand's unsuccessful candidacy in the 1974 presidential elections. After the breakup of the Communist-Socialist alliance in 1977, he adopted a more pro-Soviet, hardline policy (he had refused to support the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, but backed the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and Poland's crackdown on the Solidarity movement in 1981). But his orthodox and dogmatic stance alienated many sympathizers and failed to restore the Communists to their former dominance of the left. In the first round of the 1981 presidential election, he ran against Mitterrand but polled only 15.3% of the vote, the worst showing for a Communist presidential candidate since 1935. The Communists entered the Socialist-led government as a minority partner, holding four cabinet seats until Marchais pulled them out three years later in protest at the Socialists' switch to austerity policies. Support for the Communist Party declined further; in parliamentary elections in 1986 and 1993 the party received less than 10% of the vote. Only in June 1993 did he agree to give up the Leninist principle of \"democratic centralism.\" He retired as party leader in January 1994.\n\nMarchaisse, Jean Ernest (b.

Marcos\n\nMarcos, Bongbong, byname of Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos, or Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. (b. Sept. 13, 1957, Manila, Philippines), president of the Philippines (2022- ); son of Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda Marcos; brother of Imee Marcos. He was also governor of Ilocos Norte (1983-86, 1998-2007) and a vice presidential candidate (2016).\n\nF.E. Marcos\n\nMarcos, Ferdinand (Emmanuel) E(dralin) (b. Sept. 11, 1917, Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, Philippines - d. Sept. 28, 1989, Honolulu, Hawaii), president (1965-86) and prime minister (1978-81) of the Philippines. He was a member of the House of Representatives (1949-59) and of the Senate (1959-65) and served as Senate president (1963-65). He was a prominent member of the Liberal Party, but broke with it in 1964 after failing to get its nomination for president. He then ran as the Nationalist Party candidate against the Liberal incumbent, Diosdado Macapagal. The campaign was expensive and bitter, but Marcos won and he was reelected in 1969, the first Philippine president to serve a second term. He was also acting defense secretary (1965-67, 1971-72). On Sept. 21, 1972, he imposed martial law, citing the presence of Communist and subversive forces. He jailed opposition politicians, dissolved Congress, and tripled the size of the armed forces. He announced the end of martial law in January 1981 but continued to rule in an authoritarian fashion. He won election as president against token opposition in June 1981. After a dubious victory in the Feb. 7, 1986, presidential election over opposition candidate Corazon Aquino, Marcos held fast to his presidency as the military split between supporters of his and of Aquino's legitimate right to the presidency. The standoff ended only when Marcos fled the country on February 25, at U.S. urging, and went into exile in Hawaii. Evidence emerged that during his years in power, Marcos, his family, and close associates had looted the Philippine economy of billions of dollars through embezzlements and other corrupt practices. In October 1988 Marcos was indicted by the U.S. government on racketeering charges, but in April 1989 he was declared too ill to stand trial.\n\nMarcos, Imee, byname of Maria Imelda Josefa Romualdez Marcos (b. Nov. 12, 1955, Mandaluyong [now part of Metropolitan Manila], Philippines), Philippine politician; daughter of Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda Marcos. She was governor of Ilocos Norte (2010-19).\n\nI. Marcos\n\nMarcos, Imelda (Remedios Visitacion Trinidad Romualdez) (b. July 2, 1929, Tolosa, Leyte, Philippines), Philippine politician; widow of Ferdinand E. Marcos; cousin of Daniel Romualdez and Eduardo Romualdez. She made headlines first as Miss Manila of 1953, and again when she married Marcos in 1954. After moving into the presidential palace as first lady in 1966, she quickly took advantage of her new position. There was much talk about her growing wealth and the appointments of relatives to highly-paid governmental and industrial positions. In 1975 her husband appointed her governor of metropolitan Manila. She spent $500 million in 1977 for the construction of 14 hotels and only some $13 million for badly needed public housing. In June 1978 she joined the cabinet to head the newly created Department of Ecology and Human Settlements, with responsibility for planning and developing 1,500 cities and towns. Because she had been warmly received during state visits to China, Cuba, and Libya, she was stunned by the welcome accorded her in August 1978, when she traveled to Washington, D.C.: 15 of the 114 congressmen who signed a letter protesting the alleged rigging of the Philippine elections in April asked pointed and serious questions about her personal wealth and alleged torture. She continued to hold the posts of governor of Manila and minister of human settlements until 1986, when she and her husband fled to Hawaii. They were subsequently indicted by the U.S. government for stealing $103 million from the Philippines to buy art and real estate in Manhattan. Ferdinand died in 1989, and in 1990 Imelda was acquitted of all charges by a federal court. She was allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991; in 1993 a Philippine court found her guilty of corruption, but in 1998 she was again acquitted. She lost a bid for the presidency in 1992, but in 1995 won a seat in the House of Representatives, serving until 1998; she cancelled a planned second presidential candidacy in 1998. In 2018 she was again found guilty of graft and sentenced to at least 42 years in prison.\n\nSubcomandante\n\nMarcos\n\nMarcos, Subcomandante, Mexican guerrilla leader. He was the leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which launched a rebellion in Chiapas state on New Year's Day 1994 to demand indigenous rights and greater democracy, liberty, and justice. On Feb. 9, 1995, Mexico's Pres. Ernesto Zedillo broke a ceasefire and ordered thousands of troops into the area of Chiapas held by the EZLN. The stated purpose of the crackdown was to prevent further violence by capturing Zapatista leaders, in particular Subcomandante Marcos, their eloquent but elusive spokesperson. As part of the offensive, Zedillo unmasked Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente (b. July 10, 1957, Tampico, Tamaulipas), a middle-class \"maverick philosopher and university professor,\" in an attempt to discredit him as the voice of the peasant-led EZLN and to strip him of the charismatic guerrilla mystique that had captured the imagination of many. One of the EZLN's few non-Indian fighters, Marcos had become internationally known for his literate communiqués, issued in the name of the Revolutionary Indigenous Clandestine Committee of the General Command (CCRI-CG) of the EZLN. These letters to the Mexican people often combined humour, poetry, and storytelling with sharp political critiques. More than 100,000 demonstrators in Mexico City and elsewhere answered Zedillo by proclaiming, \"We are all Marcos.\" The government move to isolate the rebels politically thus met with limited success. The military push and reported abuse of civilians galvanized the support of students, union leaders, human rights advocates, and leftists outside Chiapas. While Zedillo proclaimed Marcos a terrorist, the National Autonomous University awarded him Mexico's highest honour - an honorary degree. In 2006 he embarked on a political tour through all of Mexico's 31 states and said he wanted to be known as Delegado Zero rather than Subcomandante.\n\nMarcos-Keon, Elizabeth (Edralin) (b. 1921? - d.

May 1, 1763, Dijon, France - d. May 13, 1839, Paris, France), French statesman. The interest aroused by the debates of the first National Assembly suggested to him the idea of publishing them in the Bulletin de l'Assemblée, and he was persuaded to merge this in a larger paper, the Moniteur universel, which gained a wide repute for correctness and impartiality. He entered the diplomatic service in 1792 and went on two missions to Great Britain before becoming ambassador to Naples. He was arrested by the Austrian government and held for 32 months (1793-95). After the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (Nov. 9, 1799), Napoléon appointed him secretary of state to the consuls. The Moniteur, which became the official journal of the state in 1800, was placed under his control. He grew in Napoléon's esteem and acted as his confidential adviser. He was created a count in 1807 (confirmed in May 1809) and duke of Bassano in August 1809. In 1811-13 he served as minister of foreign affairs; he concluded the treaties with Prussia (February 1812) and with Austria (March 1812) that preceded the French invasion of Russia. In 1813 he reverted to the post of secretary of state, until the first Bourbon restoration in 1814. In 1815 he helped arrange Napoléon's return from Elba and again resumed his functions as secretary of state. Exiled during the second Bourbon restoration, Maret returned to France in 1"
