Had been Superintendent of the Line since 1910. McDermot History of the Great Western Railway rev. Clinker.\n\nAllen, Sir Peter Christopher\n\nBorn at Mawmead, Ashtead, Surrey, on 8 September 1905, the son of Sir Ernest King Allen (18641937), barrister and later assistant public trustee, and his wife, Florence Mary, née Gellatly. After Harrow School (191924) he studied natural sciences at Trinity College, Oxford (19258), then joined Brunner Mond, part of newly formed Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a chemist. His first book on his lifelong obsession, Railways of the Isle of Wight came out the same year. After retirement he wrote Rails in the Isle of Wight with A.B. Macleod. On 27 June 1931 he married Violet Sylvester Wingate-Saul (1908/91951); they had two daughters.\n\nAllen opted for management and was soon in ICI's Alkali Division at Winnington, a thrusting and cosmopolitan outfit whose outstanding research unit discovered polythene, a foundation of modern plastics, in 1933. A large self-confident man who radiated enthusiasm, Allen relished the atmosphere. \"We were good and we knew it rather brash and not very popular; we didn't care\". Allen's work was crucial in the commercial development of polyethylene. He insisted, against opposition, on doubling its original production capacity, expressing frustration when it became a key component of wartime radar sets and ICI was unable to supply demand. \"It maddens me that night fighter equipment should wait on our incompetence\", Allen wrote in his diary on 29 August 1941. As managing director of the new plastics division from 1942 and chairman from 1948, he oversaw the development of ICI's discoveries for wartime use and the domestic revolution they brought. \"Chemically, it is a good and exciting time to be alive\", he wrote in 1943.\n\n1951 brought inevitable promotion to the ICI board but personal tragedy with the death of his wife after twenty years of marriage. A year later came remarriageon 21 October 1952; his second wife was Consuelo Maria Linares Rivas (1924/51991)and a growing fascination with Spain, culminating in his chairmanship of the Anglo-Spanish Society from 1973 to 1980. Allen's responsibilities on ICI's board included growth sectorspaint, plastics, and the new Terylene fibre. As the company's involvement in synthetic fibres mushroomed, he became a director of British Nylon Spinners. But he increasingly fretted over the lack of hands-on engagement of board members and jumped at the chance to become president (1959) and chairman (1962) of Canadian Industries Ltd, ICI's subsidiary in Canada. It was a turning point, fostering a driving interest in improving productivity and a belief in the importance of ICI's involvement in North America that flowered when Allen became chairman. It also fed his passion for golf and, with wide connections with American business, he was elected as the first British member at Augusta.\n\nReturning to oversee ICI's European operation in 1962, he became deputy chairman in 1963 at a time of controversy. There was growing economic pressure on British industry. ICI was shaken by its high-profile failure to take over Courtaulds. Allen was heavily involved in export promotion and was knighted in 1967. But when a disillusioned ICI board forced the retirement of Sir Paul Chambers in 1968, he was planning retirement. His colleagues thought differently. Disliking the front runner, Richard Beeching, who had made few friends after returning from rationalizing the railways, and feeling that two younger candidates were not ready, they turned to Allen, to his surprise. He was chairman from 1968 to 1971. Allen's successor, Jack Callard, encapsulated his contemporaries' view of Allen's 'rock-like stature, his warm and jovial manner, his openness to other people's views, his interest in everyone and all things, his decisiveness, his love of games, particularly golf' (The Independent, 2 Feb 1993). Others marked the rapidity with which he could crystallize a lengthy document or discussion, his efforts to improve productivity, and his criticism of ICI offices for 'collecting useless statistics and disseminating useless knowledge' (Daily Telegraph, 1 Feb 1993). Others noted impatience; when he visited a site he always seemed eager to get to the next engagement, often something to do with railways. And the books flowedfour on railways and one each on golf and Spain before he became chairman and more afterwards. Allen's period in office was difficult but set markers for the future. He steadied the board. He presided over, but was not much involved in, complex and ultimately disastrous moves to extend ICI's profitable fibres operation downstream by buying textile companies like Viyella. His productivity drive was prescient but not initially successful: ICI profits, to his chagrin, shrank. His crucial legacy was to encourage, against considerable opposition from heavy chemical traditionalists, a strategic move to establish ICI in the USA with a major acquisition. By the end of the century, when 40 per cent of ICI's business and even more of Zeneca's, its successful offspring, came from the USA, the significance of Allen's strategy was obvious. But in 1971 the board wobbled. The key decision came only days after he retired. In an unprecedented move, he was asked back for a pre-board discussion at which his weight helped sway the decision. As a result Britain's biggest manufacturer became a genuine multinational. Allen's incisive thinking was missed as the company was slow to reshape itself in the seventies.\n\nOn retirement, surrounded by railway memorabilia which included a full-size Spanish shunting engine, there were more books and more travel, but Allen's golf was hampered by a failed hip replacement. He became a director of British Insulated Callender's Cables. The British Transport Trust recognized his work by naming a building at the York Railway Museum after him. Allen's second wife died in 1991. He died on 24 January 1993 at his home, Telham Hill House, Telham Lane, Battle, Sussex. ODNB s lightly modified.\n\nAllen, William Philip [Bill]\n\nWho Was Who notes that he was born on 11 November 1888 and died on 4 May 1958. Bonavia's British Rail: the first 25 years records that staff matters, perhaps inevitably, were entrusted to an ex-trade-unionist. W.P. ('Bill') Allen, former General Secretary of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, who was short and cheerful, with a fine old-fashioned waxed moustache. His approach was friendly and down-to-earth, and he made the move from one side of the negotiating table to the other appear quite effortless. He was not in the least inclined to try to payoff old scores, and showed a warmer personality than his counterpart in the British Transport Commission, John Benstead from the NUR, even though he may have lacked Benstead's intellectual powers. His real success was shown by the fact that he had no enemies on either side of the negotiating table. A faintly malicious yet quite affectionate story was told about Bill Allen, derived from his dislike of formality and his insistence upon using Christian names. When he was momentarily unable to remember the name of someone whom he might be clapping on the shoulder, he always fell back on 'Arthur', so that a number of pseudo-Arthurs were always around in the dusty corridors of No 222.\n\nMcKillop's The lighted flame includes a wealth of information on Bill Allen: \"He is the born trade union leader. His is an unfailing humour and understanding of humanity, and he is quite unaware of his natural qualities. It was inevitable that he should gravitate to the ranks of the Associated. His father, a prominent member of the Society, which he joined in 1886, was not enthusiastic when young Bill Allen decided to join the railway service. I expect Allen senior had visions of young Bill becoming' something better' than an engine driver. Our future General Secretary joined the G.N.R. at Homsey as a cleaner. A1 No. 60114 was named W.P. Allen.\n\nAllport, Sir James Joseph\n\nBorn in Birmingham on 27 February 1811 and died in the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras on 25 April 1892 (ODNB). (Marshall gives incorrect date of death). Ellis' Midland Railway noted that the Midland's great general manager, James Allport, steered the company through the troubled seas of nineteenth-century boom and slump, and had brought it to its renaissance. He was a characteristic eminent Victorian of the best type, astute and forceful, yet genial and kind, not unaware of his merit, but regarding it with the same sort of satisfaction as he would have done in considering others.\n\nBy 28 he was chief clerk to the Birmingham and Derby Junction, and shortly after became general manager. He was made redundant on formation of the Midland Railway, but George Hudson placed him in command of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction, which he saw expand under his management into the York, Newcastle and Berwick. In 1850 he went as general manager to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and thence, in the same office, to the Midland in October, 1853. In the spring of 1854, he joined the Midland Board, but in 1857 he returned to office as general manager. From this he retired at the beginning of 1880, returning to the Board to fill the vacancy left by Edward Shipley Ellis, who had been chairman since 1873. A diplomatic move of 1877, which did not bear fruit, was for the joint acquisition by the Midland and the Great Northern of Allport's sometime command, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.\n\nOn retirement he was presented £10,000 by vote of the Midland proprietors. In 1884 he was knighted for his services to cheap travellers. He lived to see the fiftieth anniversary of the Railway Clearing House, of which he was the father, and died, full of years, within sound of the Midland engine whistles.\n\nTowards the close of his long and active career, Sir James Allport said: \"If there is one part of my public life on which I look back with more satisfaction than on anything else, it is with reference to the boon we conferred on third-class travellers. I have felt saddened to see third-class passengers shunted on to a siding in cold and bitter weather-a train containing amongst others many lightly-clad women and children-for the convenience of allowing the more comfortable and warmly-clad passengers to pass them. I have even known third-class trains to be shunted into a siding to allow express goods to pass. When the rich man travels, or if he lies in bed all day, his capital remains undiminished, and perhaps his income flows in all the same. But when the poor man travels, he has not only to pay his fare, but to sink his capital, for his time is his capital; and if he now consumes only five hours instead of ten in making a journey, he has saved five hours of time for useful labour-useful to himself, his family, and to society. And I think with even more pleasure of the comfort in travelling we have been able to confer on women and children. But it took twenty-five years to get it done.\"\n\nEllis British railway history (page 331) noted that he was known as \"the Bismark of Railway Politics\" .\n\nODNB biography by William Carr revised by Robert Brown.

Educated Eton (presumably reasons for name selected to start Schools class) and Sandhurst. Military career. Director National Provincial Bank. Chairman Southern Railway from 1924 until his death on 7 May 1932. Bonavia History of the Southern Railway record that he was a General, the Hon. Everard Baring of the famous merchant banking family. He had been Military Secretary to the Viceroy of India and was a director of several banks and insurance companies; his interest in railways had started in 1913 with the Rhodesia & Mashonaland Railways, where he was involved in reorganisation. On the Southern he was well able to deal with questions of external relations and public policy, especially over the negotiations about the proposed removal of Charing Cross Station to make way for a road bridge. He was described after his death as 'one of the kindest and bravest of men', and a friend wrote that 'no eyes could express so much amusement'; the nickname of 'The Imp' given him in boyhood stayed with him, so far as intimate friends were concerned, to the end. This would make him an excellent foil to the quiet and serious Walker. He was barely sixty when he became Chairman and his seven and three-quarter years at Waterloo covered the period of the Southern's major progress, especially electrification. His death on 7 May 1932 must have saddened Walker a great deal. Elliot shows how Baring was instrumental in the Southern Railway acquiring a public relations officer.\n\nBarrie, Derek Stiven Maxwelton\n\nBorn 8 August 1907 in Newport (Mon.); died 24 June 1989.

I did not particularly like him. I thought he was supercilious and pompous but he became more friendly in later years when he was appointed PRO to the British Transport Commis- sion but I always felt he was slightly hostile. He certainly tried to put me in my place in print once or twice when I had kicked over the traces probably spurred on by John Elliot, the Chairman of the BTC, who himself once wrote me a stern letter threatening the withdrawal of all 'facilities' if I made any more public criticisms of BTC affairs. But no-one can deny that Barry was a wonderful story-teller and his after dinner tales of exploits on railways in the Welsh valleys were apocryphal. He ultimately became GM of the Eastern Region at York which was rather surprising as he was always so much an LM man: a queer quirk too that he outran Dow, essentially an LNER man who only made it to Divisional Manager in the LM Region before retiring.\"Books: Modern locomotives of the L.M.S.

Bonavia's British Rail: the first 25 years notes that railway operating on the Railway Executive was placed under V.M. Barrington-Ward, former Divisional General Manager (Southern Area) of the LNER. B-W, as he was universally known, was tall, with very blue eyes and a rather austere, clean-shaven face (Hughes LNER contains a portrait). He was a member of a distinguished family, his brothers including an editor of The Times and a famous surgeon. His early training had been on the Midland Railway under that wayward genius (Sir) Cecil Paget who, as General Superintendent, had, with J.H. Follows, introduced the pioneer system of train control, later extended to the whole LMS. B-W had transferred to the LNER where his fondness for Midland practices led him into a prolonged tussle with C.M. Jenkin Jones, the supreme exponent of the alternative North Eastern Railway control principles. B-W was famous for his taciturnity. He seldom gave reasons for his decisions, but always commanded respect even from those who disagreed with him. And if a decision was taken over his head with which he disagreed, he would still loyally carry it out. His loyalty to the Midland Railway was legendary; Jenkin Jones once wrote of B-W 'putting on his Derby hat and, facing the North West, saying his morning prayers to the gods of the Midland Pantheon. Rly Mag., 1927. 61, 414-15 (includes portrait) notes that he was educated at Westminster School and Edinburgh University where he obtained an engineering degree. During WW1 he became a Lieut Colonel in the Railway Operating Division and received a DSO The Times obituary (31 July 1972) notes that he died on 28 July 1972 and was born on 17 July 1887 at Duloe.

Author of several books including official World War II history\n\nBird, Charles K.\n\nDied in 1958. Chief Regional Officer of the Eastern Region of British Railways. He was a former LNER man whose intellectual qualities (he had been a Wrangler at Cambridge) were outstanding. He had a quick wit and on occasion a biting tongue: see also his mordant observations on Sir Brian Robertson. The impression he gave was that the ordinary office tasks of a manager scarcely extended his brain sufficiently and could bore him. Sadly, the signs of poor health which were to lead to his death in 1958, at the age of barely 60, were already beginning to appear. Bonavia British Rail: the first 25 years. Terry Jenkins Sir Ernest Lemon includes a couple of pictures which feature Bird and observes that he served on the Railway Chairmen's Commission during WW2.\n\nBlee, David\n\nBorn 7 August 1899; died 26 September 1979 (had retired 1961). Served World War I from 191719, France, Belgium, Germany. Last Chief Goods Manager (from 1946) of the Great Western Railway: initial member of the Railway Executive where Terry Gourvish in British Railways, 1948-73: a business history. (1986) noted that an intensive publicity drive was organised by David Blee with the aim of cutting wagon turnround time and freeing idle stock. A wagon discharge campaign, which started in November, cut the average daily 'leave-over' of loaded wagons by a third, releasing about 35,000 wagons by the end of the year; and average terminal-user time for all vehicles, loaded and empty, was reduced from 2.13 days at the beginning of the campaign to 1.96 days only four weeks later. These examples, by showing what could be done with more determined management, suggest that the companies had failed to seize earlier opportunities for lessening the effects of austerity restrictions. He was General Manager of the unwieldy London Midland Region between 1956 and 1961. Bonavia's British Rail: the first 25 years noted that Blee was slim and clean-shaven, and that his rise had been rapid on `the Great Western. \"He was a man of great sincerity and inner kindliness, but his ambition and a certain lack of humour made it difficult for him to relax. He saw himself as a super-salesman of railways and liked to relate how, when in his younger days, he had been Goods Agent at Slough, he had been accustomed after office hours to walk down to the Great West Road to watch the lorries passing and to consider each one an insult and a personal challenge. [He} lacked the downright approach of some of his colleagues, and was not an intellectual like C.K. Bird or Jenkin Jones of the LNER or Wood of the LMS. It was perhaps not surprising that David Blee built up his supporting team very largely from his old company. Great Western influence in commercial matters was looked at with some doubts by those from other companies, however, because that railway had adhered to the old-fashioned system of leaving passenger commercial matters under a Superintendent of the Line primarily concerned with operating.

Webb claimed that most Locomotive Engineers were in favour of the vacuum brake pure and simple, but all the Chairmen at the meeting were of the opinion that it would be impossible to prevent the principle being made automatic.

His sojourn on the NBR was far from happy as he was forced to resign through Board manoeuvres worthy of Macbeth, where one of the main players was Wemyss who actually built a railway to serve his coal mines in competition with that of which he was supposedly Chairman. Other great railway managers, such as Sir Henry Oakley were shocked at the mistreatment of Conacher and some returned their free passes to him for his personal use to show their distaste for the corrupt NBR Board.

Family tradition indicates that a bitter quarrel with his father led to Richard leaving for London when aged sixteen.. He apprenticed himself to a Thames Street ironware merchant named Bicklewith. Crawshay's career was an exercise in self-improvement in the classic Smilesian mould, being the subject of an encomium in Samuel Smiles's Lives of the Engineers (18612). By 1763 Crawshay was in sole possession of Bicklewith's business. wharfs and warehouses, before settling at George Yard, Upper Thames Street, which was to be the London base of the Crawshay family firm until 1864. By the 1780s Crawshay was probably London's leading iron merchant. However, his pre-eminence in the capital was not enough. He was attracted to becoming an ironmaster in his own right: in 1786 Anthony Bacon, master of the Cyfarthfa ironworks at Merthyr Tudful, died. Crawshay had been in partnership with him as a supplier of guns to the Board of Ordnance during the American War of Independence. The guns had been cast at Cyfarthfa and he leased Cyfarthfa from Bacon's estate and devoted an increasing amount of his time to the development of the works. By 1793 Crawshay claimed to have laid out £50,000 on new plant at Cyfarthfa. He did so with effect. A survey of pig iron production in 1796 identified Cyfarthfa as by far the largest ironworks in Britain, casting 7204 tons when average output per works was a mere 1562 tons. The expansion of smelting was more than matched by a massive growth in forge capacity at Cyfarthfa. Indeed, it was in the field of iron refining that Crawshay made his most signal contribution to the British iron trade. He was the sponsor of the &lsquo;iron puddling&rsquo; technique of Henry Cort, pioneered as a commercially viable process at his works in the late 1780s and which revolutionized the production of malleable bar iron in Britain. Cyfarthfa attracted industrialists and technologists from across the world. Crawshay died on 27 June 1810 and was buried at Llandaff Cathedral, attended by vast crowds from Merthyr.

Little known of Crawshay's early life and education, only that he joined his father's business as a young man. It was the beginning of a tempestuous career. Like his father, William Crawshay was a masterful character and he found it difficult to work under his father and this led to repeated estrangements. Increasingly, William Crawshay was entrusted with running the firm's merchant house in London, while his father remained at Cyfarthfa. A fresh quarrel in 1809 led to the old man's revising his will. William Crawshay was replaced as his father's executor and residuary legatee by Benjamin Hall. and would have been left without a share in the ironworks, but for a belated reconciliation through which he acquired a three-eighths share in the Cyfarthfa works. For much of the next decade Crawshay strove to reverse this humiliation and make himself the undisputed master of Cyfarthfa. The Cyfarthfa ironworks was the largest in Britain, producing 24,200 tons of pig iron from eight blast furnaces in 1823, yet the functioning of the Crawshay firm was far from smooth. He tested the Gurney engine adapted for travel on a tramway and was very impressed by its watertube boiler.

(Who Was Who).Hamilton Ellis (The Midland Railway) noted that \"Centralised traffic control became the monument of J.H. Follows. For a long time there was on the Midland and on the LMS a lesser and rather quaint monument, the saloon carriage in which he made his travelling headquarters when out on the road, converted, as previously stated, from one of the Heysham rail motors. Follows was of rather an ascetic type, immaculate and perhaps a puritan. His saloon contained a grim white enamelled bath, served by a severely solitary cold tap. Nearly all the windows, right along the carriage, were of obscured glass. Whether this was to help him to concentrate, or to prevent lesser persons from being too awed by the daunting sight of the great man at work, has never been explained. Control not only made for smooth working and punctuality under normal conditions, it saved many difficult situations when things went wrong.\".

He became Secretary of the Railway Companies' Association in 1900 and Assistant to the General Manager of the MR in 1905 and its General Manager in 1906. His interests included traffic control and industrial relations (he was secretary to the Employers' Committee during the general railway strike of 1907. He was a member of the Railway Executive Committee during WW1. Grant Culllen. NBRSG Journal, 2020 (141), 25. He joined the Board of the Midland Railway in 1918 and became its Chairman in 1922. He died at his home, Burleigh Court in Gloucestershire on 11 October 1943..\n\n\"That wily old lawyer Sir William Guy Granet, sometime Dictator of the Midland\" (in the words of the late Hamilton Ellis) would have outmanoeuvred Machiavelli himself. Nock wrote \"Step by step, inexorably he virtually dictated the terms of the amalgamation and, although he did not become either chairman or deputy chairman of the new company, he dominated the proceedings of the board... The result was that the Midland precepts of management were adopted... Seventeen years earlier Granet had completely overthrown the traditional form of railway organisation which had prevailed on the Midland as firmly as on all the other large railways of Great Britain and now it was the turn of the other constituents of the LMS to experience what the Midland had passed through from 1906 onward.\"\n\nRutherford notes that Granet was undoubtedly one of those who wished to reduce the status, power (and salaries) of the idiosyncratic Victorian locomotive superintendents. He may well have arrived at that view (or received it from others and promulgated it further) whilst he was Secretary of the Railway Companies' Association early in the new century. Certainly once he [Granet] became General Manager of the Midland Railway, R.M. Deeley's attempts to introduce appropriate modern locomotive powereight-coupled engines for freight and four-cylinder de Glehn compound 4-6-0s for 'crack' expresses got nowhere and Deeley left in 1909. He was replaced by Henry Fowler, a man of wide interests but not the design of locomotives, although he was interested in details such as the application of superheating or the metallurgy of boiler stays. The concept of 'the dead hand of Derby' in locomotive matters can be traced back to these events.\n\nGranet was once asked what type of man made the ideal leader and he replied \"The benevolent despot\". He got his man in the person of Lord Stamp (a director of ICI) who took up the post of President in January 1926.\n\nH. G.

He entered the LNWR in 1864 when aged 20 as a clerk at Shrewsbury under Sir George Findlay who took him to Euston when he became General Goods Manager later in the same year. For three years he was in Liverpool as Assistant District Superintendent, followed by one year at Chester in a similar capacity, and was Assistant Superintendent of the Line and Chief Goods Manager at Euston before becoming General Manager.\n\nHartley, Sir Harold Brewer\n\nHartley deserves better than being listed as the instrument used to draw Stanier away from the Great Western to the LMS. Sir Harold was a scientist of considerable stature and his recruitment onto the LMS may be seen as one of Stamp's great positive decisions; obviously, the recruitment of Stanier was another. Basic information obtained from [long] biography by E.J. Bowen (revised by K.D. Watson) in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: born 3 September 1878; died 9 September 1972. Educated Balliol: physical chemist. Biographer notes that \"As a judge of character Hartley was quick to distinguish the efficient from the inefficient\". Author of Studies in the history of chemistry (1971). It is noteworthy that Hartley was the original biographer of Ernest Lemon in the ODNB. He was also the original ODNB biographer of several other people, notably Guy Granet, several scientists and a musician killed during WW1.\n\nBond noted \"an Oxford Don from Balliol and a Fellow of the Royal Society who, as a Brigadier-General, had been Director of Chemical Warfare during the Great War. Sir Harold, who in later years I came to know well, was a man of abounding energy, whose wisdom, experience, and an indomitable spirit which refused to be daunted by a crippling physical disability, enabled him to exert a powerful influence over affairs of national importance in science and the engineering profession right up to the time of his death at the advanced age of 94 years.\".

He tended to become involved in business interests with his younger brothers Henry (Harry) and Brodie. When 17 he entered the City firm of Deloittes who were Accountants to the GWR. He moved to the stockbroker firmm of Eyton, Greenwood & Eyton and became a member of the Stock Exchange when 22. In 1874 he married Jane Davis who bore him 7 children, including 6 sons. He, and his brothers developed business interests in Latin America, especially successful of which were those in the Buenos Aires & Great Southern Railway where the Government guaranteed a 7% dividend.\n\nIn 1888 he became a director of the Manchester Ship Canal, and subsequently helped to bail out Barings Bank. Thus he came to the attention of the MSLR Board which he was invited to join. He formed a syndicate with £4m capital to underwrite the London extension. Amongst his achievements with the GCR was the brilliant acquisition of Sam Fay from the LSWR, probably Robinson as Locomotive Superintendent, and Dixon Davies as Solicitor. He entered politics as Liberal-Unionist MP for West Staffordshire (between 1906 and 1913, and then briefly as MP for St George's Hanover Square until raised to the peerage, as Lord Faringdon, in 1916  he had been knighted in 1902. He was involved in acquiring the LD&ECR and in developing Immingham Docks. He was involved in merger proposals with the GNR, and later GER, but these were thrown out by Parliament. He resisted negotiating with the trade unions. At the grouping the GCR Board presented him with a portrait by Sir William Orpen which is kept at Buscot. He died in 1934 whilst still Deputy Chairman of the LNER. Significantly, he was given special responsibility for financial matters by the LNER's Board.\n\nWhen 40 he purchased Buscot, Faringdon, for £80,000 where he maintained his collections of fine books and paintings, especially those by the pre-Raphaelites: Burcot is now a National Trust property.\n\nSee Backtrack, 2001, 15, 707.\n\nBacktrack, 2002, 16, 174. letter by Bloxsom\n\nBacktrack, 1996, 10, 266\n\nHe is not listed in the Oxford Companion, nor is he given adequate coverage in the gloss about the Great Central by Andrew Dow, but Martin Daunton in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography does it make it very clear that the Great Central Railway was only a minor element in his vast financial interests, many of which were in South America.\n\nSurnames beginning Ho\n\nHodgson, Richard\n\nRichard Hodgson (1812-1877) of Carham Hall, Coldstream, was Chairman of the North British Railway from 1855 until 1866. He was responsible for introducing ruthless business methods in association with the General Manager, Thomas Rowbotham, and the possibly unfortunate William Hurst, Locomotive Superintendent. This led to a major financial scandal whereby the Scottish Wagon Company provided the NBR with rolling stock on a deferred payment basis (unfortunately, Hodgson and his associates had substantial holdings in the Wagon Co.). There is a suggestion that Hodgson may have also used a policy of railway promotion and acquistion to provide the NBR with financial momentum of the Hudson sort. The quest for lines in Northumberland, notably the Border Counties Railway led to the NBR acquiring its own access to Newcastle, but at the cost of permitting the NER running its trains into Edinburgh.

Bulleid called him \"genial\" and argued that he was eager to update the Southern's steam locomotives and passenger rolling stock. He died in 1944. Portrait (in extraordinary company which included Stanier and Willie Wood) on plate 43 of Bulleid on Bulleid. Sean Day-Lewis Bulleid: last giant of steam (pp. 129-30) called him gentle and much-loved.

He was one of the LNER's 'bright young men', his last post there being Assistant General Manager (Traffic and Statistics). The creation of a North Eastern Region had hung in the balance, the original idea being that all of the LNER in England would form one Region. The LNER Magazine noted that Hopkins hads been confirmed in the position of assistant general manager (Traffic and Statistics). Hopkins won a Traffic Apprenticeship, having gained the distinction in 1921, of being placed first in the first examination arranged by the N.E.R. Developing a flair for traffic problems, he made a speciality of wagon movement and control, but broadened his experience by a spell of service at Liverpool Street with the Continental Traffic Manager, and later as assistant to the superintendent (Eastern Section). He returned to York to grapple with rolling-stock matters in 1941 and joined the chief general manager's staff a year ater. Hopkins had charge of the Central Traffic Office at Marylebone, and represented the LNER on the Operating Committee of the R.E.C. Became General Manager of the Southern Region between 1955 and 1962 Gourvish\n\nHorne, Robert Stevenson\n\nBorn at Slamannan, Stirlingshire, on 28 February 1871; died 3 September 1940. Educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and the University of Glasgow, where he studied Law. Horne then spent a year teaching philosophy at the University College of North Wales, before being elected to the Faculty of Advocates (Scottish Bar) in 1896. He became a successful advocate, specialising in commercial and shipping cases and became a King's Counsel in 1910. During WW1, Horne became Director of Railways on the Western Front with the honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Engineers. In 1917 he joined the Admiralty as Assistant Inspector-General of Transportation, becoming Director of Materials and Priority in 1918, and Director of Labour and Third Civil Lord later the same year. Horne was elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead in 1918. He served under David Lloyd George as Minister of Labour between 1919 and 1920, as President of the Board of Trade between 1920 and 1921 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1921 and 1922. In 1937 he was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan. Director and Chairman of Great Western Railway. Also on board of Suez Canal Co.

The 'Euston Confederacy' a series of traffic agreements aimed at securing traffic from competitors, was very much his creation, and a startling answer to the difficulties facing the established lines as a result of Parliament's sanction of duplicate projects.\"\n\nPaper\n\nRailway accidents.

Died in Horsham on 7 August 1973?. Educated at Oxford University and career civil servant. Director General of Ministry of War Transport and made Chairman of British Transport Commission. His relationship with the Railway Executive was fraught with problems as related by Bonavia: The nationalisation of British transport. Entry in Oxford Companion by TG presumably Terry Gourvish Max Nicholson contributed an ODNB biography, from which the following has been extracted (it should be noted that Nicholson regards Hurcomb's involvement with the BTC as a glitch in an otherwise brilliant career.\n\nHurcomb's pallid complexion and worn appearance belied his toughness and stamina, just as his austere mien disguised his receptiveness as a listener and his great consideration for others. These, combined with his clarity of mind and tenacity of purpose, made him an outstanding negotiator. His manner was never ingratiating, but his arguments were fair and persuasive, winning respect if not always affection. Without being an expert on any subject he learned enough of a number to be taken seriously by experts, and to complement their expertise with his own wisdom\n\nThe letter which I [Bonavia] had drafted from Hurcomb to Missenden dated 13 April 1948 contained the following sentences:\n\nIt seems to me that the question of the future form of traction ; whether it is to be steam, electricity, Diesel-electric, Diesel-mechanical, or gas turbine  is probably the most important long-term problem facing the railways to-day, and it is of course closely linked with the future price ratios and availability of the different fuels. . . .\n\nA large main line electrification scheme [ex-LNER Manchester-Sheffield-Wath] is in progress. The Executive also have in hand proposals for prolonged technical trials of both Diesel-mechanical and gas turbine main line locomotives. But as regards Diesel-electric traction, there seems to be a disparity. We are still experimenting as though there were no large fund of technical knowledge and experience upon which to draw, and as though our engineers had not been studying the characteristics (as I assume they have been doing) of this form of traction for the past twenty years. Whilst American practice admittedly requires to be interpreted in the light of the smaller loads, shorter average length of haul, and more restricted loading gauge in this country, there should be no major technical questions which are quite unfamiliar.\n\nWhere our experience is lacking, is in the true level of maintenance and operating costs under British conditions, and the effects upon operating methods of turning over a complete group of services to diesel-electric traction. And only a large-scale experiment can give us the answer to these questions.\n\nFor this reason I was disappointed to read in Slim's letter of 23rd March that so limited an experiment as that now in hand in the London Midland Region is all that the Executive apparently contemplate at the moment.\n\nYou will remember that in the summer of 1947 the L.N.E.R. announced that they had prepared a scheme for the dieselisation of the Anglo-Scottish East Coast services, involving the construction of 25 single units in replacement of 32 \"Pacific\" type express passenger engines. Maintenance facilities were to be provided at London and Edinburgh, entirely separate from the steam locomotive facilities.\n\nThe Commission would, I think, like to know whether it is the fact that this scheme has now been shelved and whether the Executive have come to conclusions which differ radically from those which were formed by the L.N E.R. Board last year. I cannot help feeling, however, that until a major scheme of the kind has been put into operation, we shall not have sufficient actual experience of the capabilities and costs of Diesel-electric traction in relation to steam and other forms of traction.\n\nWhen eventually the Executive replied, in the following December, it was merely to inform the Commission that a Committee on Types of Motive Power had been set up.\n\nMullay (Backtrack, 2017, 31, 537) completely alters this entry by recording that Hurcomb had been the civil servant architect of the 1923 Grouping. Mullay is critical of Hurcomb's lack of technical skill considering cab signalling and track circuits as rival safety systems. KPJ: In retrospect it is obvious that neither Hurcomb nor Missenden were capable of ttransferring the management skills inherited from four major companies into th"
