She was educated at private schools in Chicago and in Washington, D.C. she was married (1907) to a wealthy sportsman, James Hopkins Smith, to whom she bore two sons, and from whom she was divorced prior to WW I. During the war she worked with the French ambulance corps and then established an interior decorating business. She remarried (1916) to a finance executive, Charles H. Sabin.

She was married (100 AD) to Trajanâs successor, Hadrian (76 â 138 AD), possibly at the instigation of the Empress Plotina. They remained childless. Surviving portrait busts portray Sabina as a distinguished and attractive woman but the Imperial couple lived in estrangement. They appeared together on state occasions and Sabina accompanied Hadrian on many of his journeys, but was only accorded the Imperial title a decade after Hadrian became emperor (128 AD). It was said that Hadrian would have divorced Sabina because of her bad temper if he had not been emperor. Despite this Hadrian treated her with every courtesy, and his praetorian prefect Septicius Clarus and his secretary, the historian Suetonius were dismissed from Imperial office (121 - 122 AD) because of their indiscreet and disrespectful behaviour towards the empress. Empress Sabina founded the senaculum (senate of women) over which she presided and which dealt with questions of feminine dress, jewellery, precedence and etiquette.\n\nEmpress Sabina was living (Dec, 137 AD) but died several motnhs afterwards, narrowly predeceasing her husband who died (July, 138 AD). Rumours that Hadrian ordered her to be poisoned or forced her to commit suicide are almost certainly fictitious. Hadrian caused Sabina to be deified, and a relief found at Ephesus in Greece, and preserved within the Kunsthisteriches Museum in Vienna, portrays the Imperial couple and their heirs. A statue of Sabina as the goddess Ceres (Demeter) (c130 AD) is preserved within the Ostia Museum. The empress is portrayed on a gold aureus issued in Rome (134 AD). The obverse bears the inscription SABINA AVGVSTA with a bust of the empress, whilst on the reverse Sabina is portrayed as the goddess Juno, holding a patera, with a peacock at her feet and the legend IVNONI REGINAE. A surviving sestercius (133 AD) had Sabina again as Ceres, but the reverse portrayed the goddess Vesta enthroned and holding palladium and sceptre with the legend VESTA.\n\nSabina of Ansbach â (1529 â 1575)\n\nElectress consort of Brandenburg (1571 â 1575)\n\nPrincess Sabina was born (May 12, 1529) the second daughter of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1484 â 1543) and his second wife Hedwig, the daughter of Karl I, Duke of Munsterburg-Oels (1476 â 1536). Sabina was married (1548) to Johann George (1525 â 1598), the electoral prince of Brandenburg as his second wife. Her husband later succeeded his father the Elector Johann George (1571) and she became consort. The electress died (Nov 2, 1575) aged forty-six. Sabina had borne eleven children of whom only three daughters survived infancy,\n\nPrincess Erdmuthe of Brandenburg (1561 â 1623). She was married to Johann Friedrich (1542 â 1600), Duke of Pomerania-Stettin.\n\nPrincess Anna Maria of Brandenburg (1567 â 1618). She was married to Barnim X (1549 â 1603), Duke of Pomerania-Stettin.\n\nPrincess Sophia of Brandenburg (1568 â 1622). She was married to Christian I (1560 â 1594), Elector of Saxony.\n\nSabina of Bavaria â (1492 â 1564)\n\nGerman duchess consort of Wurttemburg (1511 â 1550)\n\nPrincess Sabina was born (April 23, 1492) in Munich, the daughter of Albert V der Weise (the Wise), Duke of Bavaria (1469 â 1508) and his wife Archduchess Kunigunde, sister to the Emperor Maximilian I. Sabina was married at Stuttgart (1511) to Duke Ulrich of Wurttemburg (1487 â 1550), to whom she bore two children. The marriage was miserable, and the duchess was cruelly mistreated by her husband, both publically and privately. They later seperated, and by the time of Ulrichâs death, the duchess had resided at her brotherâs court in Munich for some years. Her son Christopher (1515 â 1568) succeeded his father as Duke of Wurttemburg (1550 â 1568) whilst her daughter Anna (1513 â 1530) died unmarried aged seventeen. Sabina was then Dowager Duchess of Wurttemburg (1550 â 1564). Duchess Sabina died at Nuertingen (Aug 30, 1564), aged seventy-two, being interred within the abbey of St George, Tubingen.\n\nSabina of Mercia â (d. c819)\n\nAnglo-Saxon Christian martyr\n\nSabina was the daughter of Coenwulf, king of Mercia. She refused to marry a local nobleman and went on a religious pilgrimage with her two sisters Alfrida and Eadgyth, intending to visit Rome. All three sisters were murdered by hired assassins at Kassel, where they were buried and venerated as saints (Dec 8) for several centuries in the Chapelle des Trois Vierges (Chapel of the Three Virgins).\n\nSabina of Simmern â (1528 â 1578)\n\nBavarian princess and political victim\n\nCountess Sabina of Simmern was born (June 13, 1528) the daughter of Johann II, Count Palatine of Simmern and his wife Beatrix of Baden. Her marriage at Speyer (1544) to Count Lamoral van Egmond (1522 â 1568) was attended by the emperor Charles V. Sabina bore Lamoral thirteen children, and the couple remained devoted to each other all their married life. With the deteriorating political conditions between her husband and the Spanish government in the Netherlands headed by Margaret of Parma, and her husbandâs own particular enemy Cardinal Granvelle, Sabina became involved in quarrels with Anna od Saxony, the wife of William of Orange, over matters of court precedence. Her husband was finally taken prisoner (Sept 9, 1567) with the connivance of the Duke of Alva. Though allowed to provide Lamoral with his meals during his impisonment, Sabina was not permitted to visit her husband, and bitterly complained about this to Philip II, but her entreaties fell on deaf ears.\n\nEgmond was publicly beheaded with Count van Hoorne in Brussels (June 5, 1568). His last letter to Sabina has survived and remains a testament to their marital affection. Fearing reprisals from the Duke of Alva, Sabina and her children, accompanied by a few servants, fled to the convent of Cambre for refuge, where several of her relatives were nuns, and who persuaded the reluctant mother superior to grant them all refuge. Her homes were ransacked by Spanish troops, Sabinaâs famous tapestries being looted for the benefit of the Escorial Palace in Madrid. Despite interventions on her behalf by the emperor Maximilian II, Albert III of Bavaria, and her own brother Wolfgang of Simmern, Philip of Spain remained unmoved by the plight of Sabina and her children. The duke of Alva even went so far as to advise the king that Sabinaâs sons should be forcibly taken to Spain to be educated, and her daughters all forced to become nuns. However, Philip ignored this harsh advice, and granted her a small annuity, though she remained harassed by the demands of her creditors. Alva himself seems to have finally relented and eventually granted Sabina the castle of Gaesbeck, formerly the property of her late husband. Eventually, after long, protracted and painful negotioations, which included intervention by Pope Gregory XIII himself, Count van Egmondâs property and possessions were restored to Sabinaâs children. She lived to witness this. Sabina and Lamoralâs numerous children included, Count Philipvan Egmond (1558 â 1590) who served as governor of Artois, and Charles van Egmond, Prince de Gavre, Governor of Namur (c1564 â 1620). Countess Sabina died (June 19, 1578) at Antwerp, aged fifty. She was interred with Lamoral at Sotteghem.\n\nSabina Katharina of Ostfriesland â (1582 â 1618)\n\nFriesian heiress and sovereign ruler\n\nCountess Sabina Katharina was the eldest daughter and eventual heiress of Enno III (1563 - 1625), Count of Ostriesland (East Friesland) (1599 - 1625), of the Cirksena family, and his first wife Countess Walpurga of Rietberg (1556 - 1586), the daughter and heiress of Johann II, Count of Rietberg and Countess Agnes of Bentheim-Steinfurt. Sabina Katharina became the wife (1601) of her kinsman Johann III, Count of Ostfriesland (c1565 â 1625) to whom she bore children, and who ruled Ostfriesland in her right. Sabina Katharina died (May 31, 1618).\n\nSabina Lampadia â (fl. c370 â 377 AD)Â\n\nRoman poet\n\nSabina Lampadia was the daughter of C. Ceionius Rufius Volusianus Lampadius, prefect of Rome (365 AD), and his wife Caecilia Lolliana. She is most probably to be indentified as the wife of the senator and writer Julius Naucellius, who owned property in Spoletium, and which she later gave to their son Sabinus, who was probably also a senator.Â Sabina Lampadia is attested by a surviving inscription which records that she paid for the erection of an altar to Attis and Rhea in the Phrygianum.\n\nSabine of Wurttemburg â (1549 â 1581)\n\nGerman landgravine consort of Hesse-Kassel (1567 â 1581)\n\nPrincess Sophia Sabine was born (July 2, 1549) at Mompelgard in Wurttemburg, the third daughter of Christopher, Duke of Wurttemburg-Stuttgart (1550 â 1568), and his wife Anna Maria (1526 â 1589), the daughter of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1484 â 1543). Sabine became the wife (1566) of William V the Wise (1532 â 1592), Landgrave of Kassel (1567 â 1592), and bore him a large family of eleven children. They were an especially devoted married couple, famous for their conjugal felicity. Landgravine Sabine died (Aug 17, 1581) aged thirty-two, at Rotenburg. Her husband never remarried.

Martha performed valuable hospital work during the Russo-Turkish War (1876 â 1878) and then retired from the world to become a nun with the Tsarist Sisters of the Annunciation. Martha von Sabinin died in the Crimea as an abbess.\n\nSabla Wangel (1) â (c1490 â 1568)\n\nEthiopian empress consort (1508 â 1540)\n\nSabla Wangel came from an important family in the Ganz region and was married to the Emperor Lebna Dengel at the time of his accession (1508) or several years earlier. When the kingdom was invaded by the Muslims led by Ahmad ibn Ibrahim of Adal (1526) she shared the tribulations of the dynasty and the country over several decades. Her eldest son Fiqtor was killed in battle (1539) and her son Minas was captured by the invaders. With the death of the emperor (1540) Sabla Wangel remained with the court in Tigre whilst her second son the Emperor Galawdewos rallied the people. The Dowager Empress joined the contingent of troops at Dabarwa near Asmara which were sent to assist the Ethiopians by Joao III of Portugal (1541) and her prescence there did much to raise the hopes of the people and the spirits of the army. The people provided provisions for the Portugese troops, and the empress herself assisted the nursing of the wounded and dying. Eventually Galawdewos succeeded in killing Ahmad and her son Minas was returned to her (1543). Galawdewos was later killed during a revolt of the Galla nomads (1559) and Sabla Wangel assisted her grandson Sartsa Dengel (1563 â 1597) to assert his claim to the Imperial throne against that of various pretenders.\n\nSabla Wangel (2) â (c1630 â 1689)\n\nEthiopian empress consort (1667 â 1682)\n\nSabla Wangel was the daughter of Gabra Maskal and became the wife of the Emperor Johannes I, whom she survived as Empress Dowager (1682 â 1689).

She bore him an only child, Beatrice of Vienne (1205 â after 1248) who became the wife of Amaury VI de Montfort, Comte de Evreux, and left issue.

Later resident at the Neapolitan court, they enrolled as members of the Third Order of St Francis (1317), and took formal vows of celibacy.\n\nDelphine was a close friend and confidante of Queen Sanchia, the wife of Robert, King of Naples. Widowed in 1323, the canonisation of her husband was eventually accomplished by his godson, Pope Urban V. The countess retired to the palace of Cassasano, near Quisisona, between Naples and Castellmare, where she lived as a religious recluse until her death. She slowly renounced all her property, and, distributing it amongst her friends and servants, the countess even begged in the streets, so that she would not be guilty of pride. Becoming increasingly afflicted with dropsy, in 1343 she returned to Naples, and with Queen Sanchia, entered the Franciscan convent of the Holy Cross. With the queenâs death (1345), Delphine removed to Apt and resided at her own hermitage at Cabrieres as an absolute recluse. Delphine de Sabran died at Apt (Nov 26, 1360). Urban V took the initial steps for beginning her caninization (1363) but died before this could be completed. She was credited with miracles and telepathic abilities.\n\nSabran, Eleonore de Jean de Manville, Comtesse de â (1749 â 1827)\n\nFrench salonniere and letter writer\n\nBorn Francoise Eleonore de Jean de Manville (March 3, 1749) in Paris, she was the daughter of M. de Jean de Manville, from an ancient family in the Languedoc region, and his first wife Madamoiselle de Montigny.

The two became intimate, and this attachment remained firm until his death. They never married before the Revolution, because of their difference in rank. Her pre-Revolutionary salon attracted those interested in moderate reform. She fled France with her son to Switzerland (1789), but returned to Paris in 1790. The situation worsened, and the comtesse fled to Prussia, marrying the chevalier during their exile. They returned to Paris in 1800, and were received at the court of Napoleon Bonaparte, where the comtesse was admired as a reminder of the previous court. Madame de Sabran died (Feb 27, 1827) aged seventy-seven, in Paris.\n\nSabran, Madeleine Louise Charlotte de Foix-Rabat, Comtesse de â (1693 â 1768)\n\nFrench society figure and courtier\n\nMarie Madeline Charlotte de Foix-Rabat was the daughter of Francois Gaston de Foix, Comte de Rabat and his wife Dorothee Theodore de Poudens de Villepinte.

A famous Regency period beauty Madame de Sabran was considered to be one of the most clever and fascinating Frenchwomen of her generation. Her liaison with Orleans lasted virtually until his death. According to the Memoires of the Duc de Saint-Simon âshe seemed quite unconscious of her lovely face and beautiful tall figure, and her modest looks would never have deceived anybody.â However possessing little wealth and much ambition she made the mistake of interfering in business. When Orleans later attempted to dismiss her Madame de Sabran refused to leave his entourage at the Palais-Royal. His last mistress (1720) the Duchesse de Falaris was Madame de Sabranâs cousin. She later attended the salon of Madame Du Deffand in Paris.\n\nSabuco, Olivia â (1562 â 1625)Â Â\n\nSpanish scholar\n\nOlivia Sabuco was the daughter of Miguel Sabuco.

Both were tried and convicted on circumstantial evidence (1921). Because it was believed that they were victims of political prejudice because of their association with anarchy, several international protests were made on their behalf. However, all appeals were refused, and despite the confession of a third party, they were sentenced to death by electrocution. Posthumous pardons were granted them five decades later (1977). Modern research has revealed that Sacco was most probably guilty, but that Vanzetti was innocent of the charges.\n\nSach, Amelia â (1873 â 1903)\n\nBritish murderess\n\nTogether with an accomplice, Annie Walters, Amelia Sach ran a nursing home in East Finchley, London, where she advertised locally that she provided amenities and nursing for unmarried mothers, and agreed to find homes for the illegitimate children for a reasonable fee. Actually Annie Walters then killed the infants with chlorodyne, and disposed of the bodies wherever she thought convenient. The pair was then caught when Walters began taking infants home with her âfor company.â Their subsequent deaths aroused suspicion, and she was apprehended by the police, which led to the arrest of Amelia Sach.
