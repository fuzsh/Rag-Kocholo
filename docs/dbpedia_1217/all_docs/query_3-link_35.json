        "text": "Silwood’s specimen trees\n\nIn addition to many outstanding veteran oak trees, Silwood Park is home to a unique collection of bundle-planted specimen trees. Bundle planting is an ancient practice in which several young saplings were tied together into a bundle and planted in the same hole after their inward-facing roots had been pruned to create a single, composite root ball. With time, the trunks grow together; if they were genetically compatible they fused, otherwise they simply compressed one another. The idea behind bundle planting was that nut-producing trees like Beech gave greater yields of mast for pig-fodder than did conventional canopies. The most magnificent of the bundle-planted trees at Silwood is the 6-stemmed Beech tree adjacent to the Conservatory on the south side of the Manor House (see Plate 10). The biggest bundle-planted specimen is the 6-stemmed giant Sweet Chestnut in Drive Lodge, which has a girth of more than 11.5m. There is a rare bundle-planted Silver Birch by the Nuclear Reactor carpark. When it comes to spotting bundle-planting, the trick is to be able to distinguish it from multiple-stemmed regrowth from ancient coppiced stools. One pointer is that coppice regrowth tends to produce a ring of similar-sized stems indicating the location of the circumference of the ancient stump, but lacking a strong central trunk.\n\nAnother speciality of Silwood Park is “close-group planting”, sometimes using the same species, but more frequently using different species with contrasting phenologies. The idea behind close-group planting is to produce a single, massive canopy, taking advantage of the fact that trees do not produce branches on the inner-facing sides of their trunks (buds produce branches on the side of a trunk facing white light, but not on the side facing green light, because green light indicates the close proximity of neighbouring plants, and investment in new branches on that side of the canopy would be wasted). There is a fine example of the kind of canopy produced by multi-species close-group planting on the ridge of Nash’s Field, visible in glorious silhouette from the Manor House, in which Norway Maple is planted along with Lime and Sycamore. There was an outstanding example of close-group single-species planting in the lawn just below the Ha Ha at the Manor House where three Quercus robur were planted in a ring of about 4m diameter. What made the group so attractive was that the three individuals came into leaf on widely differing dates, and turned golden in autumn at different times. Viewed from the Manor House, the left-most tree was the first to be lost (see Plate 12), but the biggest individual was felled by the Great Storm of October 15-16 1987. Its trunk has been left as a memorial to the storm and as a tribute to how fortunate we were to lose so few of our outstanding specimen trees (most of the casualties on that terrible night were over-mature Beech).\n\nThe Imperial College connection\n\nBiology at Imperial College London started with Edward Forbes, who was appointed in 1851 as “Lecturer in Natural History as applied to Geology and the Arts” at the Government School of Mines and of Science Applied to the Arts in Jermyn Street. He was succeeded by the great Thomas Henry Huxley FRS, who dominated biological teaching and research in Britain until his retirement in 1885. It was Huxley who oversaw the move to South Kensington in 1872 and employed such well known botanists as W.T. Thistelton-Dyer (long-time editor of Flora of Tropical Africa and Director of Kew Gardens 1885-1905), S.H. Vines, D.H. Scott (plant anatomist and physiologist, honorary keeper at Kew from 1892) and F.O. Bower. After that, there was a lull in the fortunes of biology around the turn of the century, until J.B. (later Sir John) Farmer took the chair in Botany in 1905, and Adam Sedgwick took up the chair of Zoology in the Royal College of Science in 1907. Both men recognised the scope for training young scientists who could fill the overseas advisory and research positions that would become available as agriculture and medical services expanded in the tropical parts of The Empire.\n\nHarold Maxwell Lefroy was the man who spearheaded the development of applied entomology and pest control at Imperial College that was eventually to lead to the purchase of Silwood Park. He did much of the entomology teaching in his large garden at Heston, and he was passionate about the importance of field study. He died in 1925 and was replaced by Frank Balfour-Browne, who had been teaching entomology at Cambridge (he was author of the definitive three-volume British Water Beetles). He was not an applied entomologist but he was responsible for the inspired appointment of James Watson Munro in 1926, and this man certainly was an applied entomologist. Munro did not retire until 1953, by which time he had secured Silwood Park for Imperial College, and had established Imperial College as a world centre for the study of the control of insect pests. The timing was excellent, because this was a topic of great strategic significance with the looming prospect of war. Munro needed a field station at which to rear insects and to carry out research on fumigation and other insecticidal procedures. To this end, in 1928 he sought out and arranged the purchase of a substantial house called Hurworth set in 4.5ha gardens on the London Road, a mile east of Slough. Much of the funding came from the Empire Marketing Board, the Australian Dried Fruits Board and the Imperial Tobacco Company, through their shared interest in minimising product losses in storage. Munro was very well connected and was clearly adept at smooth-talking and fund-raising. For instance, when the Empire Marketing Board ceased to exist 8 years later, Munro persuaded Sir Henry Tizard, then Rector of Imperial, that the Field Station should be funded centrally by the University Grants Committee and he impressed Lord Rutherford and Sir F.G. Hopkins of the value of the work at Hurworth during the subsequent UGC site visit. Funding was secured in 1936; £4,500 a year for maintenance, plus a further capital sum of £3,000 from the Carnegie Foundation. Munro read a paper at the Royal Society of Arts in 1936 in which he argued that “if ever we are faced with an international crisis leading to war, the storage of foodstuffs and other commodities will be a question of vital importance, and it is much to be hoped that it will before long receive the fuller recognition that it deserves as a factor in Imperial defence”. Much less was known about the problems of storing wheat and flour than about dried fruits and tobacco leaves, so the Food Defence Plans Department initiated “The Grain Survey” which began work at Hurworth in autumn 1938 to establish the nature of the problem and to investigate potential methods of pest control in grain and flour stores.\n\nThe Second World War had a profound effect on Silwood Park and its neighbourhood. Many of the large houses were taken over by various departments of the war ministry. Open ground was used to set up tented camps for contingents of American troops preparing for the allied invasion on D-Day. Soldiers of The Royal Artillery and The Royal Engineers were encamped on Ascot Racecourse. Wellington bombers were assembled on Smiths Lawn in the Great Park. Number Seven Internment Camp was set up at Ascot with its own new railway sidings; into this terrible place were packed together immigrants from continental Europe, fleeing fascist persecution (“suspected aliens”), and Britons, thought to be Nazi sympathisers. Needless to say, this extraordinary arrangement led to tension, and there were many fights. There was also a massive influx of children escaping from the blitz on London; more than 3,000 evacuees had come to Ascot, Sunninghill and Sunningdale by January 1941, to be put up with local families and taught in the local schools. This was a major culture shock for both locals and incomers; the Londoners though t the local children were rural and stupid, while the locals regarded the evacuees as urban and ignorant. “Dig For Victory” meant that many ancient grasslands were ploughed up, and several of the best areas around the Copper Horse in Windsor Great Park were destroyed. At Cheapside, the field known as The Scouts Recreation Field was ploughed up to grow cereals; this is where Hilltop Close now stands.\n\nSilwood was used as a British Army Hospital during the war, and the Pioneer Corps were billeted there. The famous cricketer Denis Compton served as a sergeant at Silwood Park working as an Army Physical Training Instructor, helping wounded soldiers back to fitness. Many Army buildings were hurriedly erected within the Park. For example, ranks of tin Nissen Huts were erected on North Gravel (where the Research Greenhouses and Southwood Halls now stand), and South Gravel was levelled to serve as the Parade Ground (this was the old Beggars Bush, now the Science Park). By the end of the war, the grounds were littered with clusters of army huts and prefabs, and many of these were used to house returning prisoners of war and refugees. Some of the wartime buildings still survive; the bar and refectory, for instance, were the old sergeants’ mess. Other buildings lasted well into Imperial College days; a long wooden building known as the American Canteen, not demolished until 1987, stood on the site of the CABI building.\n\nThe success of the pest fumigation work at Slough meant that the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) took over the research in 1941 and commandeered space at Hurworth for this purpose. Despite this setback, war work on the biology of other stored products’ pests and their control continued unabated. At the end of the War in May 1945, the Department of Zoology faced a severe space crisis. DSIR were reluctant to leave Hurworth, and there was too little space to put up the Slough-based staff in South Kensington. But Munro’s luck was in again. Lunching at his club one day with Sir John Freyer, Secretary of the Agricultural Research Council and Mr Gater of the Colonial Office, both long-time supporters of Munro’s work, they happened to meet Sir Arthur Trueman, the Chairman of the University Grants Committee. As a result, the question of the future of the Field Station went to Sir Douglas Logan, then Principal of the University of London and Sir Alan Barlow, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury. It was soon agreed that DSIR should keep Hurworth, but the College should be provided with an equivalent sum of money with which to purchase a suitable replacement property. Munro then set out to scour the countryside on his bicycle. Priest Hill at Old Windsor was the college’s preferred site (this is now part of Brunel University), but Munro considered the soil too poor and the out-buildings were committed to sitting tenants. The search eventually narrowed down to two suitable sites: Binfield Park near Taplow and Silwood Park near Ascot (which was actually discovered by A.E.H. Higgins, Munro’s research assistant). The main building at Binfield Park was dilapidated, but what may have swung the decision Silwood’s way was the fact that the Green Line number 701 bus service from Ascot to Gravesend ran hourly past Silwood Park and happened to stop outside The Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington, right next door to the Biology Department.\n\nAt the time, however, the house and grounds at Silwood Park were occupied by the Army Pioneer Corps, and the War Office showed no inclination to leave the premises. It was time for some more of Munro’s legendary work behind the scenes. While lunching at the Athenaeum, he encountered Sir Henry Tizard, no longer Rector of Imperial College but soon to become the Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence, and told him of the military’s reluctance to vacate the site. The wheels had been oiled, and within days the War Office had agreed to vacate Silwood Park without delay. The Military Requisition Orders were ended in 1947, and the Park with 80 acres was purchased for £24,000 with contributions from the Empire Marketing Board (they had an interest in fumigation as a means of protecting stored foodstuffs from insect pests). Staff and students moved into Silwood Park in April 1947.\n\nThe adjacent property of Ashurst (formerly Stoneylands, see p. 244) with 22 acres was bought a year later from the Archer-Shee family for £11,000. The main house and outbuildings at Ashurst were particularly suitable for conversion into the kind of laboratories that were needed to continue research on fumigation for which the Field Station at Slough had become famous. Also, Munro did not want insecticides to be sprayed near the Manor House at Silwood, because that was where insects were kept for research purposes in controlled temperature rooms that had been built in the old cellars. The heart of the estate around Silwood Farm was bought in 1947 by William Perryman and his sons, who set about systematically asset-stripping the valuable timber from Nash’s Copse and Mann’s Copse. They left the land as scrub, which has subsequently become birch woodland, but there was little natural regeneration of oak or beech. They soon sold out, and the College bought 93 acres of land including Silwood Lake for £13,600 from a Major Bagshaw. In this way, the estate increased from an initial 80 acres in 1947 to its eventual 223 acres in 1953. By this time, it comprised a range of natural habitats for field experiments, including grassland, woodland, orchards, arable land, a marsh, and a lake along with two streams, one “red”, one clear. After this phase of land purchase, the College set about improving the facilities for teaching and research. An expansion plan proposed in 1955 was to have cost £860,000: 31 huts scattered about the estate were to be demolished, the Manor House converted to entirely residential accommodation where the students would live, and new laboratory accommodation of 5,700 square metres was to be erected. However, the University Grants Committee visit to Silwood in December 1955 went badly, the inspectors were unimpressed, and the plan was shelved. Professor O.W. Richards blamed this setback on his own lack of administrative experience, but December was not a good month in which to impress visitors with the workings of a Field Station.\n\nThe fact that the 1878 Manor House had been built by Charles Stewart for partying and entertaining on a regal scale, rather than as a domestic residence, made it ideal for conversion to teaching and research. The high-ceilinged rooms on the ground floor off the central dance floor were given over to a lecture room (with superb windows facing out across Silwood Bottom), a library (adjacent to the conservatory) and, until 1979, a Senior Common Room (facing the Lily Pond) where staff could escape from their students (modern tea breaks are much more egalitarian). The other downstairs rooms, and most of the big former bedrooms off the first-floor balcony, were given over to research labs, each of which accommodated three or four PhD students. The grandest of all the rooms was the turreted first floor corner room overlooking the Lily Pond; this was the office of the Director of Silwood Park. One of the principal bedrooms on the first floor overlooking the Lily Pond was kept as a very grand Visitor’s Suite. The complex of small dormer-windowed bedrooms in the roof of the Manor House that had formerly housed the servants became student accommodation (who often lived as many as three to a room in the early days). This maze of corridors and narrow stairs was known affectionately as The Warren. Around the courtyard and the former stables, the ground floor rooms were given over to workshops, while the upper story had more student bedrooms and recreation facilities including the celebrated Gnome’s Kitchen (so called because of the tiny door at the top of a narrow stair, through which access w as gained). This was a favourite room for partying, where the evening typically ended with students dancing, tightrope-like, on the narrow beams that straddled the roof space. Accommodation for students has been a constant concern, because local rents and property prices are so high (staff and students at Silwood do not receive a London allowance, in contrast to their colleagues at Royal Holloway College, just down the road at Egham). Generations of Silwood students lived in lodgings in the notoriously squalid Blue Star apartments, a big three-storey brick house named after the petrol station next door. The original Shenstone House had been turned into a hotel, and then, as it became progressively more dilapidated, into flats. The petrol station was closed and the house was knocked down in 1975 to make way for the construction of Shenstone Park.\n\nWilliam Penney FRS (1909-1991) is remembered at Silwood for the frightful hall of residence named after him. He was the nuclear physicist who led Britain’s development of the atomic bomb. Penney studied physics at the Imperial College and taught there from 1936 to 1945. He did research for the Ministry of Home Security and the Admiralty during the Second World War and was principal scientific officer of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1944-45 at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, New Mexico, USA, where he helped to develop the American atomic bomb. In 1946, Penney was appointed chief superintendent of armaments research for the British Ministry of Supply and in this capacity he supervised Britain’s development of its own atomic bomb, successfully tested on 3 October 1952, in the Monte Bello Islands off Western Australia. Penney was director of atomic-weapons research and development at Aldermaston from 1953 to 1959, and he was chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority from 1964 until 1967. In 1967, he was created a life peer as Baron Penney of East Hendred, which is a thoroughly Berkshire title. William Penney Hall of Residence was opened by Lord Flowers FRS in 1970 and represents a perfect example of how not to build student accommodation; the rooms are dark and pokey, and the lack of sound proofing has to be experienced to be believed. Until the early 1980s, married students mostly from overseas lived with their families in converted flats in a big old house called Sandyride. This was a rambling red-brick mansion with stables and servants quarters in outbuildings, which sat to the south of London Road, opposite the Blue Star, on land next to the lake of the Marist Convent. The property was sold in 1987, and the house was knocked down to make way for the speculative development of Princess Gate, built in pretentious 1990s style. This development destroyed the old walled kitchen garden, wiping out a wonderful population of Angelica archangelica in the process. Fortunately, Sandyride’s adjacent field (on London Road opposite Silwood House) was spared from development by stringent planning restrictions. The £970,000 obtained from the sale of Sandyride was used to build the two Flowers Halls on North Gravel, which were opened in 1987, adjacent to the three blocks of Southwood Halls that had been funded by the College in 1983. To cover the risk that the College might withdraw from Silwood Park, Southwood Halls had been built to a plan that would allow them to be sold as separate private houses if the need arose. The final residence block, known to generations of students as Colditz (but in fact, more prosaically, as John Smith Hall) added a further 33 study bedrooms in 1989.\n\nIn the early days of Imperial College at Silwood Park, the head gardener, Mr Stringer, had a staff of 15 to look after the grounds. One of their tasks was to grow the flowers needed by Imperial College in London; for this purpose, they had an extensive complex of greenhouses. The floristic highlight of the gardeners’ year was to take all these plants up to London by road to decorate the Royal Albert Hall for the graduation ceremony. For many years after 1947 there was food rationing, and a tradition of self-sufficiency developed among the staff and students. They kept their own pigs and hens in old wartime buildings on North Gravel, and garden staff grew huge crops of potatoes, and all of the vegetables needed to feed the resident student population. There were two kitchen gardens, one in Drive Field and another on the land where the Tractor Sheds and the Pinetum now stand. This tradition petered out gradually, and by the mid 1970s all of the provisions for sustaining the students were bought in. In Humphry Repton’s time, the original kitchen gardens for the Manor House were on the other side of the Park in what is now Silwood Nurseries; these had extensive walled gardens and greenhouses for fruit and vegetables. The vine in the greenhouse of the kitchen garden was famed for its size; it was 40m long, almost as big as the great vine at Hampton Court.\n\nIn the early years after Ashurst was bought by Imperial College, it was used essentially as a laboratory for insecticide research, particularly the use of fumigation in buildings, to control pests in stored food. The apparatus used by the scientists was wonderfully Heath Robinsonesque (e.g. the electric motor adapted by Drs Page and Lubatti in the late 1940s from Wellington bomber engine-heaters to run the fans for controlled environment cabinets). Subsequently, the work on insect physiology became increasingly sophisticated, employing stereoscan electron microscopes, and there was research into chemical communication between insects (pheromones). Research at Ashurst was transformed by the arrival of John Kennedy FRS who studied insect flight and Tony Lees FRS who studied insect responses to daylength (photoperiodism), when V.B. Wigglesworth’s insect physiology research group at Cambridge was disbanded, following the great man’s retirement in 1967. Ashurst was to become a world class centre for the study of insect behaviour. The Met Tower at Pound Hill had been built with a Royal Society grant in 1963 and was used for research into the detection of rain storms using radar. The work was soon closed down by the authorities, however, when it was discovered that the radar was interfering with local telecommunication systems. Later, the tower was used as the vantage point from which Charles David carried out his video recordings of moths flying upwind to a pheromone source which proved, contrary to then received wisdom that moths could not navigate relative to wind direction without access to visual cues from the apparent relative movement of the ground beneath them. The location of the odour plume was indicated by bubbles produced from an automated child’s soap bubble machine, and the location of the female moth (too small to appear on camera itself) was indicated by a research technician sunning behind the insect with his arm outstretched and his finger just behind the moth. Believe me; it looked just as eccentric as it sounds. But it worked brilliantly and provided a major breakthrough in insect behaviour. The Met Tower is now used as a mobile phone mast by three competing phone companies: Orange, Vodafone and Hutchison 3G.\n\nThe Overseas Spraying Machinery Centre metamorphosed into the International Pesticide Application Research Centre (IPARC) but continued development of new pesticide application techniques, including ultra low volume applicators; the scientists were affectionately known as “nozzle heads”. In 1963, the Sirex Unit was set up under Frank Wilson on the site of the current CABI building to study the biological control of Sirex wood wasps. It was funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and occupied a single storey, wooden building next to the wartime American Canteen. The unit closed in 1971, having completed its work, but its derelict buildings were not demolished until 1988. The Sirex Unit left a botanical legacy because one of the people who worked there during the 19 60s planted the bed surrounding the building with Oenothera biennis x O. cambrica, a Small-flowered Evening-primrose, and these plants became naturalized; they still grow on North Gravel in 2004. Where he got this unusual genotype and why he chose to grow the plant in monoculture, we shall never know.\n\nPhase I of an expansion program saw the building of the appalling flat-roofed, two-storey South Block laboratories next to Silwood Manor House, overlooking the Lily Pond. Thank goodness there was no Phase II. At its peak in the early 1980s, almost 300 people worked or studied at Imperial College at Silwood Park: there were 43 academics, 35 research fellows, 47 technicians and 106 postgraduate students, with a support staff of 43 full-time and 20 part-time employees. There were no full-time undergraduate students, although students visited on short field courses in summer and a few were in residence for the summer term to carry out their final-year projects.\n\nAshurst was closed down and sold off in 1987 at the peak of the property boom for £2,200,000. The site was eventually redeveloped in 1995 as Ashurst Park, but only after the property developer had suffered substantial financial losses. The proceeds of the sale of Ashurst were used to construct the three blocks of Garden Wood Laboratories at Silwood between the Manor House and Buckhurst Road which opened in 1988. Some of the scientists from Ashurst moved into the new laboratory blocks in Garden Wood, while others took up positions in Imperial College in South Kensington. But applied entomology was no longer to be the principal focus of work at Silwood Park, and studies of ecology and evolution were set to increase in importance.\n\nAfter the staff moved out of the Manor House to occupy their new labs and offices in Garden Wood, the grand old house lay empty and un-loved from 1988 to 1999 waiting for essential dilapidations to be carried out, including a new roof and re-wiring. There was no obvious source for the millions of pounds necessary for the refurbishment. The saviour was John Beddington FRS, head of the Huxley School, who convinced the College to invest in the Manor House to accommodate Environmental Science staff and students for their new MSc Course in Environmental Diagnostics. The conservatory was refurbished at the same time and provided with a new glass roof and new carved stone parapet. The Manor House was reopened on 9 March 1999 by the former director of Silwood Park Sir Richard Southwood FRS.\n\nNot all of the local residents know it, but there is a nuclear reactor in Silwood Park. It is quite extraordinary, nowadays, to imagine applying for planning permission to build a nuclear reactor in the middle of deepest and richest suburbia. But in the 1960s university expansion was unbridled, and they could do almost whatever they wanted. The CABI building was begun in 1987, following demolition of the wooden army buildings and the former Sirex unit that had cluttered the site. Designed by the same architects, C.A. Cornish Associates, who built the new Garden Wood Laboratories for the Biology Department, the Science Park and the Technology Transfer Centre on South Gravel and would build the NERC Centre for Population Biology. The Silwood and Ashurst libraries were merged with the CABI library in a move that was later regretted when CABI pulled out of the building in 2000, taking their books with them. CABI moved out to new quarters in Egham at the start of the new millennium. The NERC Centre for Population Biology opened in 1989 and sported a state-of-the-art controlled environment facility, consisting of 16 chambers in which different climates could be simulated (rainfall, temperature, daylength and carbon dioxide concentrations were varied experimentally in a range of experiments). It was named “The Ecotron” in jest at first (remember the Orgasmatron in Barbarella), but the name stuck and Ecotron was what it became. The first director of CPB was the eminent ecologist John Lawton FRS who was recruited from the University of York. The building was opened in July 1990 by Margaret Thatcher in one of her first official duties after stepping down as Prime Minister.\n\nDevelopment of the Science Park and the associated Technology Transfer Centre (TTC) on South Gravel was begun in September 1986. Many of the trees that had been left when Garden Wood was felled, and which had been intended as landscaping for the new site, blew down in the great storm of 15-16 October 1987. That is why the landscaping of the site consists entirely of trees planted in 1988, but at least it gave Greer Crawley who designed the scheme, the opportunity of planting a large number of interesting tree species, including many Quercus, Betula and Acer species, along with some distinctive conifers like Chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘Pendula’ (the entire planting budget was just £15,000).\n\nSilwood’s Gardens\n\nThe big, older trees around the Manor House (mainly Beech and various Cedars), date from c.1800 when Sibbald built his new house on this side of the Park. Prior to that, this part if Silwood Park had been heathery “waste” known as Beggar’s Bush. Sibbald made the decision to build here, instead of near Eastmore on the hill above Silwood Farm where Humphry Repton had preferred (see p. 219). There was then a long gap during which little if any tree planting occurred, until the modern phase of tree planting began in 1980. The first Pinetum was planted by Ray Davies and Mick Crawley on the east lawn adjacent to the main drive amongst the giant conifers in 1981. It consisted almost entirely of North American pines: Pinus rigida, P. ponderosa, P. jeffreyi and P. muricata established well but have become rather sparse-crowned at 25 years of age. Pinus coulteri from California is big and fast-growing but it makes a gaunt and unattractive specimen. The pinetum was extended to the west side of the drive partly for screening the Tractor Sheds (erected in 1986) with species like Brewer’s Weeping Spruce, several Japanese pines and a young Wellingtonia, planted in spring 1991. Two of the species which grew most rapidly, Pinus pseudostrobus and P. muricata, both died suddenly in 1998. There was much tree planting between 1983 and 1990 associated with the new halls of residence (Ostrya japonica, Pyrus pyraster, Frangula alnus). The open ground of Garrison ridge to the north of William Penney Hall, opposite the Nuclear Reactor, which had been Southwood’s intermediate successional stage, was levelled using a mechanical digger borrowed from one of Collin Merryman’s friends in 1993, and an arboretum of rare oaks and maples was planted in 1994. The most frost-sensitive oak species were planted in a bed along the south-facing wall of William Penney Hall in 1994, including Quercus vacciniifolia, Q. wislizeni and Q. agrifolia. The National Collection of Narcissus was moved from Sunningdale to Wishing Well Lawn in 2004.\n\nEcological and entomological research in the grounds of Silwood Park\n\nThere has been a long tradition at Silwood Park of studying insects and their relationships with their host plants (there is a full bibliography of this work on the web site). In the early years of the Field Station, most of the field work was carried out by Prof O.W. Richards FRS with Dr Nadia Waloff and their students. Richards had joined the zoology department in 1927 from Oxford. He became Head of Department and Director of Silwood Park in 1953 until his retirement in 1967. His botanist brother, also an FRS, was a leading expert on the ecology of tropical forests. Waloff was a formidable, chain-smoking Russian entomologist; she was recruited from Birkbeck College in 1942. Their study of grasshopper ecology in Nash’s Field was one of the first long-term studies of an insect population under field conditions (Richards & Waloff, 1954). The insect fauna of broom Cytisus scoparius was the focus of much of this early work and had both pure and applied aspects. Richards and Waloff were particularly interested in the ecological relationships between the different insect species feeding on broom, and their student Jack Dempster used a novel precipitin test to demonstrate which insects were predators and which were their prey. The broom beetle Phytodecta olivacea turned out to be a keystone species in this system (Richards and Waloff, 1961). They also carried out one of the world’s first exclusion experiments on the effects of insect herbivores on plant performance. They used insecticides to exclude insect herbivores from broom populations and discovered huge effects of insect feeding on seed production and death rate of the broom plants. These effects were attributable principally to the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum subsp. spartii and the broom beetle Phytodecta olivacea (Richards and Waloff, 1977).\n\nDick (T.R.E.) Southwood FRS was appointed in 1955 and Michael J. Way in 1961, both from Rothamsted, and both were destined to become Directors of Silwood Park. Southwood did much of the field work for his classic book Land and Water Bugs of the British Isles at Silwood Park (Southwood and Leston, 1959). He went on to study insects in grassland, like Oscinella frit (Southwood & Jepson, 1962), communities of insects on trees (e.g. on oak and Buddleja), and population dynamics of insects on shrubs (e.g. the alien Viburnum whitefly Aleurotrachelus jelinekii on the alien evergreen shrub Viburnum tinus). Southwood is perhaps best known for his work on the role of insects in plant succession. Former arable plots in Silwood Bottom were abandoned from agriculture in 1977, 1978 and 1979, and the insect communities that developed during the course of secondary succession were followed over several years (Southwood, Brown & Reader, 1979). The plots soon became dominated by perennial grassland, but trees established in the early years, and within 15 years the plots had become oak/birch woodland; the wooded plot, abandoned from agriculture in 1977, is preserved to this day as a reminder of these experiments. With Patricia Reader, he also studied the birds in three successional stages: the early successional (arable) community in Silwood Bottom, the intermediate community of scrub that developed on building waste on Garrison Ridge between William Penney Hall and Silwood Bottom and the later successional birch woodland on Hell Hill. Subsequently, the focus of the successional work turned to below-ground insect herbivores under the leadership of Val Brown and Alan Gange. This, in turn, led to work on the rhizosphere and mycorrhizae and into the ways that insects, feeding above and below ground on the same plant, can influence one another’s growth and survival.\n\nMichael Way specialised on aphids and their relationship with the ants that tended them. He was the first to show that aphids tended by ants caused greater damage to their host plants than aphids on their own. He also demonstrated facilitation in aphid feeding and growth, whereby an aphid on its own grew less quickly than a similar aphid with a group of aphids caged on the opposite side of the same leaf. It is to Michael Way and his long-term collaborator Mike Cammell that Silwood Park owes its large population of Spindle bushes Euonymus europaeus. These were planted because they are the winter host of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae on which the two entomologists carried out long term research. The tall aphid suction trap which stands on the middle of the lawn in Silwood Bottom is part of a Europe-wide network of similar traps that was originally set up under the direction of Roy Taylor at Rothamsted in 1960. By constantly sampling flying greenfly from the air, the idea was to anticipate pest outbreaks and hence to rationalise the use of insecticides in agriculture. Sadly, farmers these days find insecticides so cheap to use that they spray their crops every year, “just in case” (this is called prophylactic spraying).\n\nThe biology of insects in grasslands has been an on-going theme of the work in ecological entomology at Silwood Park. Stuart McNeill continued this tradition with his work on the energetics of the bug Leptopterna dolobrata in the Holcus mollis grassland on Gunness’s Slope. Long-term studies with the use of insecticides in grassland in Nash’s Field have shown the vital role played by the grass-aphid Holcaphis holci in suppressing the growth of Holcus mollis and hence allowing low-growing herbs like Galium saxatile to prosper; the enemies of Holcus mollis are the friends of Galium saxatile. Meanwhile, exclusion of slugs and snails promoted recruitment from seed, especially of low growing herbs like Crepis capillaris and Hypochaeris radicata.\n\nThe Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau (later CABI) came to Silwood in 1981, and their scientists worked on the first floor of the Manor House until their own custom-built facility was opened in 1988. CABI employees continued the tradition of studying broom Cytisus scoparius at Silwood Park. Broom is a troublesome pest of dry pasture land, foothills and riverbeds in California, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Efforts to find biological control agents for the weed involved screening a wide range of legume-feeding insects, mites and pathogens, and much of this work was carried out by CABI at Silwood Park. CABI scientists had extensive plots in rabbit exclosures on Gunness’s Hill from 1983 to 1998 in which broom grew spontaneously from the seedbank. CABI moved to Egham in 2001, and their building was converted for teaching and re-named the Hamilton Building in 2009.\n\nThe study of theoretical ecology at Silwood Park prospered following the appointment of M.P. Hassell FRS in 1971. Subsequent collaborations with R.M. May FRS and R.M. Anderson FRS revolutionised the study of host-parasitoid dynamics (Hassell and May) and led to the development of the celebrated SIR model of infections disease dynamics (Anderson and May), which tracked the numbers of “susceptible, infectious and recovered” individuals, by modelling the dynamics of disease transmission. In recent years the focus has broadened again, to include studies of evolution, biodiversity and conservation, but the Silwood tradition of linking theory, observation and experiment, both in the field and under controlled conditions using growth chambers and greenhouses, flourishes to this day."
