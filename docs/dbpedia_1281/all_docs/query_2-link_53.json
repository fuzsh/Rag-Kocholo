        "text": "The first commemorative march for Chile’s Popular Unity government took place on September 11, 1989. Paying homage to the victims of the military dictatorship, it gathered more than five thousand people at Salvador Allende’s then-unmarked tomb in Viña del Mar.\n\nIt would also be the final year of Augusto Pinochet’s bloody dictatorship. Before stepping down, Pinochet ominously announced on national radio that even in his absence the “struggle against Marxism must go on.”\n\nEvery year since that date, a commemorative march is held in Santiago de Chile. However, in 2005, the route was reversed so that it would begin, rather than end, at the cemetery and head toward its final destination at the Moneda Palace. The message behind the route change was clear: there will always be a place for the Left to mourn its fallen heroes, but its ultimate destiny lies elsewhere.\n\nThe Chilean left also seems to be reversing course in recent years, most spectacularly by winning majority representation in the all-important Constitutional Convention, responsible for rewriting the nation’s magna carta.\n\nAmid growing confidence on the Left, many people have also begun to look back with a different attitude on the history of Allende’s Popular Unity government (Unidad Popular, UP) — less as a solemn act of remembrance than an active search for useful political experiences.\n\nTomás Moulian is known to historians as one of the leading militants of the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU Obrero Campesino), a left-wing party that played a key role in Allende’s Popular Unity government. Although later Moulian was nominated as pre-candidate for the Communist Party in the 2005 presidential election, he is perhaps most widely recognized today as a sociologist dedicated to the study of the political economy of Pinochet’s dictatorship and as the author of the now classic Chile actual. Anatomía de un mito (Chile Today: Anatomy of a Myth).\n\nMoulian has most recently published a El gobierno de la Unidad Popular. Para comenzar (The Popular Unity Government: Getting Started). Written half a century after the electoral triumph of Salvador Allende and in the midst of Chile’s incredible left-wing resurgence, it’s a fittingly rigorous study of the policies of Allende’s government, meant to transmit real lessons to a Left eager to learn from the past.\n\nMía Dragnic spoke to Moulian for Jacobin to learn more about what it was like to play an active part in the thousand-day Allende government, and about why the Left needs to not just remember but also build new ideas based on the experience of the Popular Unity government."
