        "text": "* Graenum Berger; Helped Ethiopians Go to Israel\n\nGraenum Berger, 90, an American credited with helping relocate tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. A social worker by training, Berger became interested in Ethiopian Jews after encountering some during a visit to Israel in 1955. Ten years later, he visited Ethiopia and recalled being angered at the conditions there. “We saw extreme poverty, the worst in the world,” Berger said, “where people earned $65 a year. And they faced terrible discrimination.” He lectured about the Ethiopian Jews, also known as Falashas, before American audiences and formed the American Association for Ethiopian Jews. He thought he would be helped in his cause by the Israeli rabbinate’s 1975 decision to legally recognize the Falashas as Jews, but found little support from Jewish leaders in the United States and Israel. After Menachem Begin was elected prime minister of Israel in 1977, Berger sensed some support for his cause. In 1984 and 1985, Operation Moses, a secret airlift of Falashas to Israel, was initiated. In 1991 another rescue operation was carried out and thousands more Falashas were airlifted to Israel. By 1993, there were believed to be 50,000 Ethiopian Jews in Israel. While Berger didn’t set up the Israeli government- sponsored airlifts, he has generally been credited with being the moral force behind the evacuation.

Cordeiro Jr., 73, who as a high school student in Honolulu took historic photographs of the attack on Pearl Harbor. An editor at the Honolulu Star Bulletin asked Cordeiro to take a few photographs of naval maneuvers at Pearl Harbor on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941. Armed with a Leica camera borrowed from a teacher, Cordeiro captured the destroyer Shaw exploding in a ball of flames. Cordeiro joined the Army, and after being wounded in combat in the Philippines, exchanged his rifle for a camera. At the end of the war, he photographed Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepting the Japanese surrender aboard the Missouri. He went on to serve in the Korean War, winning a Bronze Star for his photography behind enemy lines. He retired from the Army in 1964 with the rank of master sergeant. On Monday in Oregon. The cause of death was not announced.\n\n* Hyman Faine; Labor Executive, Opera Booster\n\nHyman R. Faine, 88, a veteran labor executive who helped organize several of the country’s leading opera companies and later helped establish the country’s first management in the arts program at UCLA. Faine was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and came to the United States at age 10, graduating from City College of New York and Harvard Law School. After serving in the Army during World War II, Faine began a 25-year career as executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists for the U.S. and Canada. In that position, he negotiated union contracts for artists and staff at the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet, and opera and dance companies around the country. In Los Angeles, he negotiated contracts for the Roger Wagner Chorale. In 1970, he was appointed regents professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Management and later joined the regular faculty.

In opposing the repressive government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Silva sponsored groups that gave legal aid to political prisoners and helped people dismissed for political reasons find jobs. He also worked to collect evidence of torture and other human rights abuses. He once commented that “there are more of the Gospels’ values in socialism than there are in capitalism,” but he also firmly opposed Marxism. Silva’s work made him a target of attacks by the military and its rightist supporters. His parents’ grave was desecrated, he received death threats and gunmen fired on his house. President Eduardo Frei decreed five days of national mourning to honor Silva. “Above all, he was a man of indomitable spirit,” Frei said. “He would always tell me, ‘One has to work for the poor.’ ” Silva, who had been afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease for years, died Friday of a heart attack in Santiago.\n\n* Jack H.
