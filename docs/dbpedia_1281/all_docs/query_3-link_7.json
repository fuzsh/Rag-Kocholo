        "text": "(ANS – Rome) – Luis Badilla recalls the Salesian Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, a monumental figure in Latin American history and in particular in Chile. The cardinal, who died in April 1999 at the age of 92, is still very much loved and remembered not only in Chile, but in the memory of many Catholics and non-Catholics. It is impossible, as the director of the “Seismograph” writes, to recall the events of the 1973 Pinochet coup without the still-living presence of Salvador Allende and Raúl Silva Henríquez, “different men but both upright men, men of peace and justice, and each in his own tenacious and uncompromising way a defender of human life and the dignity of people.”\n\nBelow is Luis Badilla’s story.\n\nFifty years ago – on September 11, 1973 – around seven in the morning I called my archbishop, Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, whom I had known as a child since he was the Rector of St John Bosco College and I was a student there. I wanted to inform him of what had been told to me, two hours earlier, by friends residing in the city of Valparaíso, the main port of Chile, and where he had been a bishop appointed by John XXIII. Albeit confused and without answers, the news was horrendous and incredible: the city between the mountains and the Pacific was in the hands of the Navy, the first to show – in the middle of the night – the true nature of Pinochet’s coup plotters. There was already talk of people being executed on the street or in their own homes […] The coup plotters showed up, openly, occupying the radio and television station, around 5 in the morning.\n\nDon Raúl listened to my story, nervous and horrified, without saying a single word. At the time we parted, he said to me: “Protect yourself and your family well. You know, I didn’t sleep last night. I worked and prayed. The night was cold, very dark. It seemed like morning didn’t want to come. There are no stars today, Luis. ”\n\nAllende, His Family and Cardinal Silva Henríquez\n\nI met President Salvador Allende, with whom I collaborated, and two of his three daughters: Isabella and Beatrice. I was lucky enough to meet his widow Hortensia Bussi, after the coup,, a kind and meek woman, who despite her age and fragile health traveled the world advocating the cause of democracy and the defense of human rights. With her and Beatrice I made several trips to Europe in the 1970s to meet government officials and facilitate the reception of Chilean refugees […] More than once I was the bearer of messages between the President and the Cardinal, and today looking back with gratitude I am sure I met two moral giants forgotten too soon.\n\nLast Attempt to Save the Country\n\nBy May 1973, the political situation in Chile was already irreversibly deteriorating and there was but one question: when and how would the military coup take place. Salvador Allende, squeezed between those who wanted a policy of radicalisation in an extreme socialist direction and those who preferred a pause to consolidate the reforms won (a choice considered by some as ‘moderate social democratic’), decided to take the initiative to establish a sincere and transparent dialogue with the opposition, the Christian Democrats. At various times he experienced a dialogue with the former President and charismatic leader of the Christian Democratic Party, ran by Senator Patricio Aylwin, but actually controlled by former President Eduardo Frei. It wasn’t possible. Frei always refused any meeting because, as the facts after the 1973 coup show, he was already part of a plot to overthrow Allende.\n\nFormer President Eduardo Frei Decides\n\nIn the end, with the mediation of Cardinal Silva […] a meeting between Allende and Aylwin was possible. It was Friday, 17 August 1973. True and sincere dialogue between the two did not follow any initiative. Everything was paralyzed. The political situation of the country on the eve of the thousand days of government of the Popular Unity coalition was irreparably compromised.\n\nSome testimonies claim that on the night between 10 and 11 September Salvador Allende wrote the draft of his speech to the nation to announce a referendum, ensuring that if he lost he would immediately present his resignation. There was no alternative to get out of the crisis constitutionally.\n\nThe request to Pope Paul VI\n\nWhile he was writing this draft and Cardinal Silva was praying, the Armed Forces, which had been plotting since April as Pinochet himself acknowledged days after the coup, had set up a military machine to overthrow President Allende […]\n\nThe Failure\n\nToday, 50 years later, it must be said that President Allende and Cardinal Silva did everything to the last moment to avoid one of the worst tragedies in Latin America in the twentieth century. Salvador Allende ended his life with suicide at the end of his political experience, which failed due to many political errors, but also due to the absolute inconsistency of the alliance that supported him. In the midst of the detritus of pain, mourning and suffering, the Chilean people immediately identified the anchor to save themselves in their best-known and most loved shepherd: Raúl Silva Henríquez. But this is another story, one of hope that never remains silent. The story of a priest and bishop who dedicated his life to defending human dignity without hesitation and without backing down in the face of power.\n\nA few months after I left Chile with his help, and help from the then Archbishop of Panama City, Marcos McGrath (1924 – 2000), we met in the Vatican in the offices of the deputy director of the Osservatore Romano Fr Virgilio Levi (1929 – 2002). I then asked Don Raúl why Pope Paul VI had not condemned the coup even though he was severely critical. The cardinal replied: “It was I who begged His Holiness not to address the question publicly because Pinochet would have reacted badly, increasing the violence. So I thanked the Holy Father very much. His was a painful act of love for the Chileans.”\n\nThen I had the opportunity to meet Pope Paul VI to whom, in one of these meetings, I asked the same question. “I have been asked by the Chilean bishops and I think I have helped many persecuted people” the Pontiff replied."
