        "text": "4.7/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nGGuest UserI loved this hotel! The staff was really wonderful and accommodating. Juan was at the front desk each morning with a greeting of ”Good Morning Madame.” Nicolas was very helpful in arranging my stay prior to the visit, which was helpful. Every staff member was really friendly and accommodating. They served a small breakfast buffet in the main level each morning, even cooked eggs to order if you'd like. I went to this country traveling as a solo female. This was a nice location because it's walking distance to several restaurants and a lovely park. I felt completely safe in the area. My favorite was the Peruvian restaurant! I had this amazing seabass dish with scallops and calamari with a sauce on top. This was all on a bed of risotto. Chilian wine...fantastic! I wasn't familiar with this region's wine and was surprised at how good it was. My meal, paired with a lovely Chilian Sauvignon Blanc Reserve was so delicious that I went back and had the same thing the next night. There is also a hill about a mile away that has the Christ statue, that is very walkable. There is a Japanese Garden on the hill. If you can't walk there, there is a funicular and the Uber car service worked just as it does in the US. One tip, if you're from the US or North, the maps will be backwards on Google. Just google directions to get them in the direction you're going. I got lost the first day until I did my Google search on how to fix. The only problem I had was the language. Very few people speak English. I even went to a restaurant, fine dining at a park, quite lovely, but nobody spoke English and the menu was only in Spanish. To make matters worse, my phone died! Be prepared with how to use Google Translate, that will help, but if your phone dies, you're dead in the water. I found it very hard to communicate with people, which would not have been as bad had I not been traveling alone. I found it to be very isolating. I even took a tour with an English-speaking guide. I thought great, now I can chat with people, but NO! It was a guide who spoke Spanish, then translated to Portuguese, then English. I was the only English-speaking person on the bus. The museums, a few are only available in Spanish so no point going to those if you don't speak Spanish. Other than the language barrier, I had a lovely time. My highlight was my hotel and the staff!\n\nShow More\n\n4.5/5\n\nExcellent\n\nGGuest UserWe flew into Santiago on an overnight flight and used booking to stay for our first night. Arrived at the airport and needed to WhatsApp the hotel to arrange for a complimentary ride. It’s 10 mins away and the shuttle was new and clean. We attempted to check in a little early @ noon, but we’re told if we wanted to check in before 3PM we would be charged an extra 1/2 day rate. We decided to wait. After having a coffee I spoke to the front desk @ 2PM and they agreed to check us in early (I assume it’s because the hotel was extremely quiet and they had ample space/rooms). The hotel is clean, but quite a ways off the beaten path. Not sure how safe the area is as the hotel is gated with a wire fence and looks desolate and a little prison-like. Also, the hotel seems newer, but the walls are super thin and a little noisy because of this. Breakfast was very good and Lorenzo was helpful at the front desk.\n\nShow More\n\n4.5/5\n\nExcellent\n\nBBoarding_gate123My husband and I stayed in an executive room for 5 nights in January-February 2020 while holidaying around South America. Positives: - a massive fresh, clean and modern room with nice views - good breakfast buffet - good wifi - friendly staff, except for the breakfast staff who were a bit aloof. - within walking distance to the metro station. We Ubered a lot, and this worked fine. (Taxi drivers, however, struggled, to locate the hotel for some reason.) - a nice cocktail bar on the rooftop. Negatives: - we had repeated issues with lack of hot water in the shower. Not acceptable. - we had to ask four times to get our laundry picked up. - no room service for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We were travelling for 3 months and sometimes you're just too tired to venture out for food. Had this been a business trip, I'd had been absolutely appalled as I tend to have room service dinner so as to get a moment's rest and solitude. Simply inexcusable not to provide this service. - music from the cocktail bar carried into our room one night, necessitating earplugs (we were on the highest floor). - the cocktail bar is, understandably, very popular with locals. While I fully support the hotel also providing a space for locals, there should have been some tables (as well as sun loungers during the day) exclusively reserved for paying hotel guests, because it was quite difficult to grab a spot in the relatively small area both during the day and evening. (The hotel appeared to sell daytime pool passes to non-guests.) - about to check out, we called the concierge to ask someone to help us and come pick up our luggage. To our surprise, they informed us that this service was not provided (?!) and that they'd had to ask for permission from someone higher up to send someone to help us. I thought it was a joke at first, it sounded so absurd. When we checked in, there was a bellboy who automatically took all our luggage so making a big show about providing this when checking out was just very odd. All in all, however, a solid four-star hotel.\n\nShow More\n\n4.5/5\n\nExcellent\n\nGGuest UserGood morning, first of all, I would like say good things about the Doubletree Hilton Vitacura, was a great hotel, good location and close to the Mall and good restaurants around. Me and my 2 sisters and my mother stayed from 28/05 until 04/06 in the hotel and we were very proud with the service, all the employees were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very comfortable and affordable. Breakfast was the best part, which offered lots of options cold and hot buffet for everyone and specially for the waiter Leonardo and everyone else that gave us a good service and was very good. I would really love to thank everyone from the hotel Concierge, Breakfast Team, Housekeeping, Front Desk people and we had a wonderful time. I recommend this hotel and hope to see u guys next time.\n\nShow More"
