        "text": "The Catholic Church in Chile has spent months preparing for the arrival of Pope Francis.\n\nChurch facades are plastered with posters commemorating the visit, which will have great significance in a country that remains mostly Catholic despite a precipitous decline in faith since the turn of the century.\n\nThe papal visit has also aroused great interest from across the Argentine and Bolivian borders. According to the local press, 350,000 foreign visitors are expected to arrive during Pope Francis’ trip Jan. 15-18.\n\nStretching along a strip of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Andean Cordillera, Chile has not had a papal visit since Pope John Paul II came to Santiago in 1987.\n\nBut it was a very different Chile then with a white-uniformed Augusto Pinochet welcoming the pope as he descended from the plane.\n\nThe dictator still remained in control at that stage although he was already facing a wave of opposition that led to his defeat a year later at a referendum intended to extend his term of office for another eight years.\n\nThe Chilean people chose otherwise, opening the path for a return to democracy.\n\nThe status of the local Catholic Church has also evolved greatly over the intervening 30 years.\n\nIt held a place apart during the battle against the Pinochet dictatorship. Former president Michelle Bachelet paid tribute to this role in a speech at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago in 2010.\n\nThe museum contains a special section devoted to the Church’s action in favor of human rights under the Pinochet regime.\n\n“Hardly had the coup d’état taken place than Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez and the bishops publicly condemned it, demanding moderation and calling for respect for worker rights,” reads one wall panel.\n\nThree weeks later, Cardinal Silva Henriquez launched the Pro Paz (pro peace) Committee, an ecumenical effort to fight for human rights.\n\nSoon after, he also established the Vicariate for Solidarity, which played a vital role assisting detainees and their families.\n\nIn 1999, the nation decreed five days of mourning to commemorate the death of Cardinal Silva Henriquez.\n\nNow the archbishop of Santiago, Ricardo Ezzati was then bishop of Valdivia, some 850 kilometers south of the capital. His episcopal ordination there in 1996 included a symbolic ceremony for the new Chile.\n\n“More than 25,000 people participated in the celebration at the municipal stadium including 26 bishops, two cardinals, the apostolic nuncio, 120 priests, 100 seminarians … and two ministers,” La Croix reported in its edition of Oct. 22, 1996.\n\nThe article noted that Archbishop Ezzati, who prior to his epicopal ordination was the national delegate for youth ministry, had described Pinochet on national television in 1983 as a “traitor to the country.”\n\n“During the dictatorship, we in the Vicariate for Solidarity were the voices of those who had none,” Archbishop Ezzati recalls.\n\n“We were the only ones able to do this. However, after the restoration of democracy, our role changed. It was no longer our job but that of lay institutions, both cultural and political.”\n\nSince then, the Chilean church has experienced rapid secularization.\n\n“I would say that Chile, along with Uruguay, is the most secularized country in Latin America,” said Archbishop Ezzati.\n\n“We represent around 60 percent of the population, according to surveys, against 70 percent 30 years ago.”\n\n“This diminution is explained by the rise of non-believers and agnostics while the number of evangelicals has remained stable at around 17 percent,” he added.\n\nYet a series of affairs that have exploded in recent years have also damaged the church’s authority.\n\nOne of these was a scandal involving Father Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty of sexual abuse of children in a canonical trial at the Holy See.\n\nA study published at the beginning of January showed that only 36 percent of Chileans had confidence in the Catholic Church, a drop of 43 points since 2010.\n\n“I believe that several very significant cases will have an impact for a long time to come,” Archbishop Ezzati lamented."
