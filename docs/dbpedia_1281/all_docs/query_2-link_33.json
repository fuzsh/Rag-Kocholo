        "text": "The former \"Santa Monica House\" in the center of Santiago looks like a small manor, partly hidden by palm trees. Still alive in the memory of many Chileans, it will soon be adorned with a plaque for the historic role it played 50 years ago when it was seen as the only hope for the families of the victims of the coup d'état of September 11, 1973 and the terrible repression that followed in the South American country.\n\nThe “Santa Monica House”\n\nJust a few weeks after the bombing of the presidential palace on that day, the Comité Pro Paz (Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile) was set up by the Catholic Church to help the relatives of the disappeared. For two years, the \"Santa Monica House\" provided families with essential material, moral and legal support.\n\nAnd it saved the lives of many people. One of them was Sergio Zamora, a socialist activist who was arrested in 1975 after twenty months in hiding and a few daring acts, such as dispersing leaflets in the heart of Santiago.\n\nOn the very day of his arrest, Zamora escaped from the guards who had tortured him, and crossed the gates of the small manor house, where he found the determined help of the committee. This included that of the archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez, who intervened with General Augusto Pinochet to avoid another capture. Zamora would eventually flee to France.\n\nA tribute to the late Cardinal Silva\n\nLast May, during the first ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the coup d'état of September 11, 1973, the current Chilean government of President Gabriel Boric paid tribute to the cardinal, who died in 1999. A Mass was celebrated in his memory at the Moneda, the presidential palace bombed in 1973.\n\nTo mark the anniversary, the Catholic Church, both in Santiago and in the provinces, held meetings and discussions to reflect on the lessons to be learned from the past.\n\nIn Concepción, the country's third-largest city, 500 km south of the capital, Archbishop Fernando Chomali even became a filmmaker. He produced a 40-minute documentary on the families who are, still today, searching for the bodies of loved ones who disappeared under the dictatorship. Half a century later, almost 1,200 of Pinochet's victims are still waiting for burial.\n\nThis group began meeting weekly in facilities made available by the Church beginning in 1978.\n\n\"I made this documentary to pay tribute to these families and victims, and to let Chilean youth know what happened in our country,\" explained Archbishop Chomali.\n\nIn the film, which was screened on September 1 before a full house in Concepción, he highlighted the story of María Candelaria Acevedo, the region's representative in Chile’s Chamber of Deputies. Her father set himself on fire in front of the cathedral in 1983 after learning of María and her brother's arrest. She was released just in time to see her father one last time before he died of his injuries.\n\nThe Church on the side of the victims\n\nDuring the discussion following the screening, Hilda Espinoza, whose husband disappeared in January 1975, paid tribute to the role of the Church. \"Through Archbishop Fernando Chomali, I want to thank the Church as a whole for all the support we have always received from it. Without it, we wouldn't be here today as we are: on our feet, because, thanks to the Church, we had a roof over our heads, protection, a house, lawyers,\" she said.\n\n\"Right from the days following the coup, the Chilean Catholic Church was courageous under Pinochet,\" confirmed Patricio Jimenez, history professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. \"During the Fiestas Patrias (Homeland Holidays) on September 18, the Church refused to organize a Te Deum, as is traditional in Chile. It was the only year without a Te Deum in our history. In the context of the time, it was more than just a symbol,” Jimenez said. “Then very quickly, in October, the Pro Paz committee was created, which in 1975 became the Vicariate of Solidarity, which only closed its doors with the return of democracy.\"\n\nThis attitude is all the more striking given that it was not that of the Catholic authorities in the other countries of the region, also under military rule, despite pockets of resistance.\n\n\"Very early in Chile, the Church was sensitive to democracy and social issues from the very beginning of the 20th century, influenced by French and Belgian social Catholicism,\" Jimenez noted. \"Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez was formed in this spirit.\"\n\nFifty years on, the Church wants to keep the memory alive. It is calling for \"a month of prayer for Chile\". Church bells will be rung throughout the country on September 11 in tribute to the victims of human rights abuses.\n\nA Church discredited by the child sex abuse scandals\n\nBut is the country ready to listen to the Catholic Church, shaken by a number of high-profile child sex abuse scandals?\n\n\"There are those who feel, even within the Church, that we no longer have the legitimacy to tackle these issues,\" admitted Tomas Scherz, pastor of Santa Ana Parish in Santiago. \"And there's no question that the 50th anniversary of the coup d'état is being used as a 'marketing plan' to restore the Church's image. But many, like me, believe it is our duty to talk about the victims,\" he added.\n\nThe priest said this must be done in the parishes, but not only there. Several events were held at the Catholic University in Santiago, for example.\n\n\"But the truth is that the Church is no longer credible in Chile,\" lamented Mariana Aylwin, minister of education from 2000-2003 and daughter of the late President Patricio Aylwin, the Christian Democrat who led Chile from 1990-1994 immediately following the dictatorship. \"(The Church) also lacks national figures of stature,” insisted Aylwin. “Today, its message is no longer going beyond the confines of the churches.\"\n\nThis is true when it comes to Chile's past, as it is for the country's present."
