Stanley Turner 41631, also a Canadian, he decided to escort him down.\n\nHe was then attacked by nine Me109s one flown by the German ace Adolf Galland whose aircraft he managed to hit several times. During the encounter several Me109s then came to their commander's aid, Sgt. Robillard managed to shoot down at least two of them before he was also shot down. He saw two go down and locals reported a third. He made a statement on his return that the third aircraft had hid as he was preparing to collide with it when as a shell tore off his port wing. All this, it must be remembered after the young Canadian had only been in front line service for less than one month!\n\nHe managed to bale out and then, with the assistance from French locals, managed to evade capture, travelling through occupied France, through Spain, until finally arriving in Gibraltar on the 12th August 1941.
