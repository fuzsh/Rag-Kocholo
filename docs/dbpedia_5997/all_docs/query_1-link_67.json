        "text": "It is a regrettable fact that the constraints of time and resources have ensured that the focus of 625 Squadron archive reports has necessarily been upon the seventy-four aircraft and crews that failed to return from operational or training flights.\n\nOf the 523 airmen involved in these losses, their fates were truly abysmal, with 389, representing 75%, being killed, whilst 59 (11%), became prisoners of war, 16 (3%) evaded captured and 59 (11%) were safe including 12 injured.\n\nAt the foot of this page can be found a full list of all 74 aircraft and crews lost by 625 Squadron. Those currently covered by Aircrew Remembered include links to their respective archive reports.\n\nNo Bomber Station could have functioned at all, had it not been for the tireless and unselfish efforts of not just the Aircrews but of ALL the Station Personnel. These include of course, the ground crews servicing and preparing the aircraft and the countless other individuals located in every nook and cranny of an operational airfield. The Medical Centre Staff, the Admin Personnel, the Catering Cooks and Waitresses, the Bomb Dump personnel, the Armourers servicing the guns and 'Bombing Up', the Electricians, the Engineers, the Parachute Packers, Drivers, Security personnel, the Station Clothing Stores and Bedding, the Laundry, Mechanical Engineers servicing all of the Station vehicles, the Barber, the Dentist, the Painters, and many other 'Forgotten' but nonetheless essential contributors that made up a Bombing Effort.\n\nIt is also little appreciated that after the war, many 'natural deaths' were in fact the direct result of contracting illnesses through extraordinary exposure of ground personnel to working all hours of the day and night, causing abnormal exhaustion. Though not confined to outdoor working conditions, it was of course more prevalent than indoors, through six bitter winters, often in freezing cold, wet, and miserable weather. Indeed, during the first years of the war, it was often impossible to get dry clothes to change into between shifts. They had to work through whatever the weather threw at them, seven days a week, twenty four hours a day!\n\nIn order to show their appreciation, it was not uncommon for Aircrew to invite their Ground Crew and others to social evenings in the local pubs in town, where they could all relax, and improve their bonding. Each relied on the other and knew that it was all a combined effort. On many an occasion, fairly inebriated airmen would often 'borrow' bicycles to ride back to camp through the lanes. Next morning the local bobby would turn up to retrieve them and the Mechanical Transport pool would provide a vehicle to transport the bicycles back to town!\n\nSadly, the 'unsung heroes' that these personnel certainly were, are often forgotten when the achievements of Bomber Command are voiced and filmed. Without them however, the whole effort in prosecuting the War in Bomber Aircraft would have been impossible! It is regrettable that the post war silence of these personnel suggests that the world cared little for their contribution, yet is never too late for their voices to be heard.\n\nIt is therefore the object of this page, to pay tribute to at least some of the personnel, no matter what their role, who contributed to the valuable work undertaken by 625 Squadron during the Second World War.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting that we begin with those crews that managed to successfully run the gauntlet of thirty missions to tour expire and be rewarded with a posting to a training or administrative role, after which members of the RAF were then expected to return for a second tour of operations, whilst those of the Commonwealth Air Forces could volunteer for a second tour, or elect to remain in a non-combative role in England or their home country.\n\nAlas, aircrew who were fortunate enough to survive a tour, did so at a tremendous emotional and psychological cost as they witnessed the loss of their Squadron mates to the horrors of night combat over occupied Europe. Their chances of surviving a tour of thirty missions was less than thirty per cent - far from a comforting statistic!\n\nThe following list of pilots and crew that survived a tour may be incomplete and will be amended if additional crews are discovered.\n\n1.

Leonard Frederick Spooner, DFC 133621 RAFVR (Tour completed 10 April 1945)\n\n*F/L Middlemiss was the first pilot posted to the Squadron from a Conversion Unit to tour expire without an aborted mission. This would be the result of a tight knit crew coupled with an impeccable ground crew. Not to mention a tincture of good fortune from Lady Luck considering that the targets that this crew confronted were located in the heart of enemy territory—including the Ruhr Valley and many to the dreaded ‘Big City’, Berlin. In his list of targets there were no milk runs: Berlin 12 ops, Düsseldorf 2, Frankfurt 2, Stuttgart 2, and Nuremburg raid of 30 March 1944. His first lucky steed for ten ops was Lancaster LM384 until she failed to return from the 19 February 1944 Leipzig raid with the loss of F/Sgt. Charles Ernest Pearson and crew. The last eleven missions were carried out in lucky Lancaster ND639. She was lost when a pilot of No. 1667 Conversion Unit lost control in cloud on an exercise and crashed at Crowle, Lincolnshire on 5 April 1945\n\n**P/O Price DFC and his crew were second to tour expire of the ‘rookies’ from a conversion unit. As relative neophytes they were most fortunate to survive their second op to Düsseldorf of 3 November 1943 in Lancaster W4833.\n\nWe are most privileged to have Reg as a co-author and technical adviser of our team at this time (25 August 2020). His input and feedback have been invaluable as a contribution to many of our 625 Squadron archive reports. REG WE SALUTE YOU!\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF TOUR EXPIRED CREWS\n\nThe following photographs are of some of the above crews known to have completed operational tours. If you can identify any of the crew members please contact our helpdesk.\n\nCrew of G-George A Flight, 625 Squadron. From the left: Sgt Harry Bulman, engineer; F/L Clem Koder, pilot; F/Sgt Allan Avery, rear gunner, RAAF; Sgt Arty Sheehan, mid-upper gunner, RCAF; Sgt Jock Stewart, wireless operator; F/O Hal Zlutnik, navigator, RCAF; Sgt Eddie Donohue, bomb aimer (by exclusion) RCAF.\n\nSgt Avery was adopted by this crew after F/O David Mattingley's crew was broken up following the their heroic return from the November 29, 1944, Dortmund raid.\n\nFor further information see Battle Order 204 on the 625 Squadron Reference page:\n\nhttps://aircrewremembered.com/625-squadron-referen...\n\nIn the above photograph, James Tanner's grandfather, Flight Engineer, Raymond Blissett is pictured leaning on the car to the right of the Pilot, 1st Lt. Frank Marvin. Others in the photograph are: Rear Gunner, Wally Jetson; Bomb Aimer, Alan Ashworth; Wireless Operator, Ron Dickinson; Mid-Upper Gunner, Bill Leslie and Navigator, John Adlan.\n\nThe above photograph of F/Lt. L. F. Spooner and crew, was kindly provided by Kevan Cassidy, the son of the navigator, Sgt. Philip R. Cassidy. The others are unknown, although there are clues as to their identities given that Philip Cassidy is known to have been a member of the crew captained by Flight Lieutenant L.F. Spooner.\n\nHaving requested the help and expertise of John Naylor, he has kindly offered the following analysis regarding the identities of the other crew members.\n\nPlease note: We still seek confirmation of these identifications. If you can help, please contact our HELPDESK.\n\nBack row, left to right:\n\n1. Sgt J. Chambers, Wireless Operator, 1076628, wearing 'S' Brevet. Chambers, however, was the original wireless operator, and flew just 4 operations with the crew. He was taken ill on the operation of 21 December 1944, and did not fly with the crew again, his place being taken by various other wireless operators. Thus, if the photograph was taken after 21 December, this might be any one of at least eight substitute wireless operators or indeed Chambers himself.\n\n2. Sgt. Geoffrey Leslie Taperell, Rear Gunner, 1397780, wearing A/G Brevet, a name tag, (that I have never seen before that looks like Taperell), and a talisman of some description on his left lapel. He was born at Hackney, London, in 1924 the son of Leslie G. Taperell and Gladys C. Taperell née Wood. One known sibling: Audrey G. Taperell born at Edmonton in 1919.\n\n3. Sgt Philip R. Cassidy, Navigator, identified by his son Kevan Cassidy.\n\n4. Sgt E.P. Wilkes, Mid Upper Gunner identified by elimination.\n\nFront row, left to right:\n\n1. F/O Laurence Michael Ratigan, Air Bomber, 154077, identified by 'B' Brevet and epaulets which would appear to be those of a Flying Officer. He was promoted to F/Lt on 29 October 1945 (London Gazette 30 November 1945) and married Eleanor D. Mason at Bournemouth in 1949.\n\n2. F/Lt. Leonard Frederick Spooner, Pilot, 133621. Identified by his Pilot's Badge. DFC 17 July 1945, resigned 6 March 1949. His epaulets would appear to be those of a Flight Lieutenant, his rank from 5 November 1944, (London Gazette 24 November 1944).\n\nHe was born at Edmonton, North London, on 17 August 1920 the son of Arthur C. D. Spooner and Margaret Spooner née Ball. He was a Press Tool Maker prior to enlisting. In 1939 he lived with his parents at 73, Hoe Lane, Enfield. Siblings: Edna M. Spooner, born 1924 at Edmonton, and possibly Cyril E. Spooner born 1927 at Hendon.\n\n3. Sgt. William Harry Murray, Flight Engineer, 1184266 most likely to be next to Pilot in photo?\n\nSgt. Murray was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on probation on 28 February 1945 (London Gazette 17 April 1945 - new service number 195230).\n\nTour Expired\n\nBy 27 March 1945 F/Lt. Spooner had flown 34 operations, 3 of which were aborted. Of the other 31 only F/Lt Spooner and Sgt. Cassidy had flown on them all. Sgt. Taperell, Sgt. Wilkes and F/O. Ratigan had all flown 30. Thus all were tour expired, barring Flight Engineer, P/O. Murray. It is clear that the crew made a joint decision to fly one final operation, so that the whole crew could finish their tour together as one unit. Their decision to do so, serves as another example of the tight bond that existed between the members of bomber crews during the war. Their final operation was on 10 April 1945, a raid on the German city of Plauen. They returned safely and the crew name has now been added to the list of tour expired crews above.\n\nOTHER UNIDENTIFIED CREWS\n\nThe following photographs are of 625 Squadron crews for whom we have no detailswhatsoever. If you have any information please contact our helpdesk\n\nTony West has tentatively identified this to be the crew of F/O D.R. Ward who completed five of their trips with PB154. This is definitely not the crew of F/O E.P. Twynam lost on the November 4/5 1944 Bochum raid, with PB154. We would be most grateful to anyone who can confirm the identities of this crew. JEA\n\nThe photograph below of the same crew was placed on Facebook by Jeannette Littlejohn with the following information: 'Going through some of my dad's photographs (Leslie Brice, back row 3rd from left). It just has a date of 1944 on the back. Looking through his flying log book he lists his P/O as Parker.'\n\nThe photograph below corroborates the identity of Leslie Brice in the above photograph and the airman 2nd from left of Unidentified crew 7 .\n\nThe other members of the crew were:\n\nPilot: 1710097 P/O. Frank Gerald Parker; Navigator: 1685302(later P/O. 178839) Sgt. Ernest John Coupland; Air Bomber 1399759 F/Sgt. E G Williams; Wireless Operator: 157896 P/O. Leslie Henry Hutchinson; Mid Upper Gunner: 158008 F/O. Jack Alfred Knight; Rear Gunner 179880 P/O. Wilfred Laws Reed\n\nWe seek confirmation of the identities of the other crew members and the positions in the photographs. If you have any information please contact our helpdesk\n\nIn December 2022, Aircrew Remembered was contacted by Matthew Bishop, who identified the airman on the extreme right of the above photograph (Unidentified crew 8), as being his grandfather, Sgt. George Thomas Bishop. Air gunner, Sgt. Bishop, was posted to 625 Squadron from 103 Squadron wef. 10 April 1944. to complete the final operations of his first tour. He flew four operations with the crew captained by Fl/Lt. William Sydney Middlemiss DFC. The crew, assumed to be that of Fl/Lt Middlemiss, are pictured in front of Lancaster ND639 in which the crew flew the last eleven missions of their tour including the four flown by Sgt. Bishop. Sgt. Bishop was posted to 1481 (B&G) Flight wef. 15 May 1944. We seek positive identification of the others in the photograph, if you can help, please contact our helpdesk.\n\nThe above photographs courtesy Kevin Ball/Eileen Edge Collection\n\nTHE 48 MEMBERS OF A LANCASTER CREW\n\nThe pages of all Operations Record Books are littered with details of pilots, flight engineers, navigators, air bombers, wireless ops, air gunners and their deeds. And whilst even their steeds merit inclusion there is a yawning void when it comes to any reference to the teeming body of humanity that worked tirelessly, often in horrendous conditions, to enable the aircrews to sally forth, night after night to perform their deadly, deathly duty.\n\nYet these 'Erks' as they were affectionately known, received nothing but the utmost praise, gratitude and respect from the aircrews whose lives depended on their skill, expertise and attention to detail in maintaining and repairing their trusty mounts\n\nAn unequivocal pride in their work, born of a will to be the best, was such that each ground crew came to look upon their particular aircraft as their very own property, the aircrew being merely allowed to borrow it from time to time. They took a dim view of the crew that returned their pride and joy in anything other than the condition in which it left their safekeeping.\n\nAnd it did not end there, multitudes of others, engaged in performing important tasks, essential to the well-being of the crews and the efficient running of the base cannot, and should not be, overlooked: cooks, drivers, stores personnel, mess orderlies and admin personnel to name but a few.\n\nTo put it in perspective, of the 2500 personnel needed to run a bomber base, a mere 10% were aircrew.\n\nFront row (left to right): Flying Control Officer, WAAF Parachute Packer, Meteorological Officer, seven aircrew (Pilot and Captain, Navigator, Air Bomber, Flight Engineer, Wireless Operator/Air Gunner and two Air Gunners)\n\nSecond row. Twelve flight maintenance crew (left to right): NCO Fitter, Flight Maintenance Mechanic, NCO Fitter, five flight maintenance mechanics, Electrical Mechanic, Instrument Repairer, and two Radio Mechanics)\n\nThird row. Bombing up team: WAAF Tractor Driver with a bomb train of 16 Small Bomb Containers (SBC), each loaded with 236 x 4-lb No. 15 incendiaries. Behind: three bombing-up crew\n\nFourth row: Seventeen ground servicing crew (left to right): Corporal Mechanic, four Aircraft Mechanics, Engineer Officer, Fitter/Armourer, three Armourers, Radio Mechanic, two Instrument Repairers, three Bomb Handlers, Machine Gun Belt Fitter.\n\nBack row (left to right): AEC Matador Petrol Tender and two crew, Avro Lancaster B Mark I heavy bomber, Mobile Workshop and three crew.\n\nPENGUINS AND GROUND WALLAHS\n\nAnd last, but far from least, a section dedicated to all the Erks, Stores Bashers, Chair Force, Chain Gang, Cabbage Mechanics, Sky Pilots, Bluebirds, Passenger Pilots, Water Rats, Scab Lifters, Scuffers, Rock Apes and all the other indispensable Penguins and Ground Wallahs of 625 Squadron.\n\nSgt.
