The force was decimated by German fighters, and only 7 aircraft survived to fight again. Records show that 'R for Robert' landed at RAF Coltishall at 1600 hrs after the battle, and its pilot, Sqn Ldr Paul Harris, was awarded the DFC. On 6th October 1940 N2980 was taken 'on charge' by No 20 OTU, and some weeks later (31st December 1940) was on an ill-fated navigational training mission. The aircraft, piloted by Sqn Ldr Marwood-Elton, flew into a snowstorm some 20 minutes from Lossiemouth when the starboard engine failed. Because of the poor weather the captain ordered the trainee navigators to bail out and then, with the copilot managed to ditch the aircraft on Loch Ness. The Wellington soon sank and settled 70 metres below the surface. Wellington 'R for Robert' was salvaged from Loch Ness 21st September 1985 and transported to the Brooklands Museum of Motor Racing and Aviation where it has been restored, and is on display. 03.08.1940 - 30.08.1940 Commanding Officer, 7 Squadron RAF 28.12.1942 transferred, Reserve of Air Force Officers (and called up for air force service) 20.05.1947 permanent commission, RAF (General Duties Branch)\n\nHarris,\n\nSydney Herbert Verder\n\n01.06.1905\n\nRomford district, Essex\n\n-\n\n(03?).1983\n\nHove district, East Sussex\n\nP/O\n\n17.12.1924\n\nSq.Ldr.\n\n01.02.1937\n\nGp.Capt.\n\n01.10.1946 (retd 01.07.1955)\n\nCBE\n\n?\n\n?\n\nEducation: psa\n\nHarris,\n\nVorley\n\nOnly son of Uriah Harris (1864-1960), and Adeline Harris (?-1958), of Pontypridd.Married (27.07.1939, Istanbul, Turkey) Mary Tay (27.08.1906 - 1973), only daughter of Mr & Mrs J.H.

Flying Officer Hayes was unable to see the enemy aircraft himself, but he skilfully manoeuvred his aircraft on instructions from the air gunner. After a short while he sighted a Junkers 52 and although hard pressed by superior numbers of other enemy aircraft and with his own aircraft damaged, Flying Officer Hayes attacked the Junkers 52 with tenacity and determination until it was seen to go down with its port engine on fire. Breaking off the engagement and skilfully evading his opponents he made for home but shortly encountered three Heinkel 111's.
