My father; still living, was assigned to the 391st / 574th in Nov. of 44; his aircraft was shot down on the morning of Dec. 23rd, 44. I understand that only one person did not survive this incident. My father's memory is not very clear of the whole thing, but what he could tell me was he thinks the missing person was the Nav-Bombardier \"J.J McNamara\", my father's position was that of Engineer-Gunner \"Dom Lucero\", the Radio-Gunner was a \"J.J. Hancock\", with the Pilot being \"P.L. Woods\" and the Co-Pilot being \"C. Letzring\" I would very much like to hear from anyone who has knowledge of his crash on that day, as he had to spent many months in the hospital before discharge, and I would like to gain any photos of his group while there in Europe. I have a photo of my dad's crew but I believe this is state side upon graduation. My Father received the Purple Heart while in the Hospital, however, someone remove it from his pillow, and he has not gone after it. Can this be re-presented. My father continues to be very active as Past Commander of his local post with the American Legend. I would like very much to see him receive this medal in a military fashion. His four boys all served with-in the US Services, with his second serving in Vietnam 69-70; \"82nd Airborne\". Any information would be great ! Hope you have a wonderful New Year Sincerely, Gerald Lucero\n\nGerald,\n\nHerewith the information you are seeking.

Can anyone tell me the color scheme and markings of the 320th BG, 442BS on or abouts January 29, 1944. In particular I am looking for a description of my uncle's plane 42-95763 which was shot down on that date. I am also curious as to why there was a Radio Operator and a Special Radio Operator on board at the time. The crew consisted of Pilot, Copilot, Bombardier, Engineer/Gunner (my uncle), Radio/Gunner, Special Radio Operator and Tail gunner. Thank you. Bob Young\n\nDate:\n\n12/27/2002\n\nTime:\n\n1:45:36 PM\n\nTo: Mr. Trevor Allen, Historian, b26.com. I would like to take this opportunity to say \"Thank You\" for the marvelous work you have done in preserving the \"Memories\" of the Martin B-26 Marauder and ALL of the crew members who flew aboard them during WWII. Without people communicating and sharing their \"Memories\" the B-26 Marauder crew members would have MOST likely just faded away into Historical Oblivion. Moreover, Mr. Allen, without YOU and Mike, a lot of us would have NEVER been able to read with amazement about the lives and memories about and of these Marauder Men. Each time that I visit this Website, I always take time to look at the NEW additions (both the Postings and the Pictures). May God continue Good Health for both you Mr. Allen and Mike so that this Website continues to GROW and EXPAND into the distant future. Along with ALL of these Marauder Men being my Heroes, I want you to know, I add you Mr. Allen and Mike to my \"Heroes\" list as well. Mr. Allen, some time ago, you sent my Father, Jack Hastings, a copy of the Combat missions he had flown with the 322nd B.G., 449th B.S. Although you were only able to find 58 of his 70 missions, he has made sure plenty of copies of the LOG were circulated to other Family members. Again, thank you Mr. Allen for your work in this Amazing endeavor. My father, Jack Hastings celebrated his 82nd Birthday on 22 November 2002 and is doing great. He can also be contacted at the above address. Frederick Lee Hastings\n\nDate:\n\n12/25/2002\n\nTime:\n\n3:29:09 PM\n\nEnjoy your site. I am the son of George B. Simler who flew with the 322 Bomb. Group, 451 Bomb. Squadron. While on vacation in England my wife and I located his old base, now known as Andrews Field which is a museum dedicated to the men who flew and maintained the B-26.

My father was a Engineer Gunner, first with the 322BG, then later, because the crew he was with had experience, They were moved to the 494th BG. when it arrived in England. He came back to the States before the 494th moved to France having completed 73 missions. Dad kept in touch with Duke, Bill and Henry from his crew from right after the war until his death. In the mid eighties we got the opportunity to meet George Pilot, and Jack co-pilot. All began flying together at Barksdale and remained a crew through their 73rd mission, Aircraft I have heard mentioned were: \"Lights Out\" ( a picture of Hitler being hit with a boxing glove), and the other ship was \"We-Dood-It\" (They had a mission to fly and they did it) I attended two different 322 reunions with Bill, Jack, Henrey, and my Dad, West Point, and in Bosier City, Louisiana. I have never met a more honorable group of men as the Marauder men I met at those two conventions. Dad passed away May 1, 1993, I can not remember a day in his life he didn't mention the B-26, his time in England, or his friendships he made from his experience during the WWII era. Merry Christmas to all the First, and second Marauder generation families, and may God Bless. also I am looking forward to adding what ever I can from Dad's B-26 records and pictures on later dates.

My father was Myron \"Whitey\" Sterngold, a captain in the 451st bomb squadron 322nd bomb group. I think his plane was \"idiots delight\" but not sure--there were so many. I have a number of photos of him and his squadron. I can upload one of him and his dog who accompanied him in his flights. He always went to his squadron reunions and loved being with the guys. It was a very special time for him. He died in 1986, just before his 70th birthday of heart and kidney failure. He flew many missions. How do I get his war record? I also have a site where I took photos of his flight jacket which I am now trying to get restored. Thanks for setting up this site.

He never talks about this much but I know it means a lot. He is a good man. Becky Dunn\n\nBecky - your dad served with the 319th Bomb Group in the Mediterranean area. At this moment it is not possible to pinpoint his squadron as the three B26's you name, \"Snafu\", \"The Big Ass Bird\" and \"O'Riley's Daughter\" were from three different squadrons.

Thank you, Wade Anderton\n\nDate:\n\n12/19/2002\n\nTime:\n\n7:25:13 PM\n\nThe following passage is from a sermon by John Hagee:\n\nI want you to close your eyes and picture in your mind the soldier at Valley Forge, as he holds his musket in his bloody hands. He stands barefoot in the snow, starved from lack of food, wounded from months of battle and emotionally scarred from the eternity away from his family surrounded by nothing but death and carnage of war. He stands though, with fire in his eyes and victory on his breath. He looks at us now in anger and disgust and tells us this...\n\nI gave you a birthright of freedom born in the Constitution and now your children graduate too illiterate to read it.\n\nI fought in the snow barefoot to give you the freedom to vote and you stay at home because it rains.\n\nI left my family destitute to give you the freedom of speech and you remain silent on critical issues, because it might be bad for business.\n\nI orphaned my children to give you a government to serve you and it has stolen democracy from the people.\n\nIt's the soldier not the reporter who gives you the freedom of the press.\n\nIt's the soldier not the poet who gives you the freedom of speech.\n\nIt's the soldier not the campus organizer who allows you to demonstrate.\n\nIt's the soldier who salutes the flag, serves the flag, whose coffin is draped with the flag that allows the protester to burn the flag!!!\n\n\"Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands. Protect them as they protect us. Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need. I ask this in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Amen.\"\n\nWhen you receive this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our U.S. ground troops in Afghanistan, AND all over this world.\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n9:08:58 PM\n\nHoward W.

Some series of the tail serials do double and treble up on the last three digits, so the last three digits are not enough to identify a particular aircraft.

He said they stopped counting bullet holes at the #2000 because there were too many holes in their plane. I do not have a computer at my home in NC-I am visiting here only until Day after tomorrow. I will access a computer at our library but not often if you want to contact me.

I am trying to help the school collect as much information as possible about veterans who served during the world wars, especially those who were killed or decorated. The information is (eventually) posted at the following website http://kilby.sac.on.ca/ActivitiesClubs/Cadets/Cadets.htm - The school's website is www.sac.on.ca I had just received and read his IDPF from the Army. I had sent away the request in February and had thought it had gotten lost! Anyway, I am trying to learn as much as I can and thought that somebody reading your website might know something about him or his a/c. Thanks for your concern and I look forward to hearing from you in the future.\n\nP.S. I am considering contacting the National Personnel Records Center, but since I am not a family member I was wondering if the information they would give me would make it worthwhile?\n\nJustin Lindquist\n\nJustin,\n\nDate: 19 February 1945\n\nTarget: Railroad Bridge at Neuwied, Germany\n\nB26: 43-34208 W (Un-named)\n\nCrew:\n\nCapt Martin Harter - pilot\n\n2.Lt Shaldon Spector - copilot (prisoner of war)\n\n1.Lt Robert Brugman - bombardier/navigator\n\n2.Lt John Therkeldsen - bombardier/navigator\n\nS/Sgt Joseph Stube - radio/gunner\n\nSgt Harvey Johnson - engineer/gunner\n\nSgt Neubern Atkinson - armourer/gunner\n\nT/Sgt Harold Brown - armourer/gunner\n\nCapt Nicholas Opalic - Army liaison officer\n\nIncident:\n\nReceived direct burst of flak to left engine on approach to target,caught fire,dived away and later seen to explode in mid-air prior to crashing.

His grandfathers name is Maurice D. Norton. Army Service Number :0813XXX. We know that he was a part of the 397th bombardment group, his plane was \"Leaping Leama\". He also served with a Col. Richard Coiner during his time. Mr. Norton was part of the sqd. during the raid on Eller, Germany on 23Dec44. There is no record of his being there in his file, so he was never awarded the D.U.C.

On August 9th 1944, some B-26 went to Brest for one more bombing, and not certainly the last. I have found two accounts, coming from two different people, and am trying to match up these information to know what really happened, so to complete this aircraft file. What I already know about it : August 9, 1944. Attack on the German fortress at Brest. Lt Beesons ship was seriously damaged, or believed to be. Sgt. Henderson, and S/Sgt Chapman bailed out, but managed to return to the Squadron later. Lt. Beeson landed on one or our strips on the French coast, and he and the remainder of his crew managed to repair their airplane and return to base. Crews involved : Bennet, Roberts, Eyeberg, Mc Carty, Beeson, and King. Allen, Richards, Levy, Deardorff, Maloney, Strazalka (info from a friend, do not know the source) I have found a few different shots of Robert Chapman. A first one, where hes dressed in civilian clothes, with one knife in hand. Another one, back in his flying uniform, after he got back his chute where he had it hidden in a stack. Another on board of a 6th Armoured Division Jeep with about fifteen people around them, just before leaving Abilys Kergavarec farm. A last one with his family in the USA. All pictures were offered by the Abily family, from this nearest farm close to which he landed. I also found the following account in a book, and met the author Jean Dréo : August 9, 1944. Around 8 pm, for groups of 6 two-engines aircraft, some Marauders I think, Flying at about 1000 meters high, coming from Brest, following the Elorn River. Heavy Flak fire. When passing just in front of us, a bomber suddenly catch fire. For a few seconds, long flames with fume, then he falls vertically. A few moment later, , on the same road, at the same altitude, five groups of six in perfect formation. Very accurate Flak again. Just after they have passed, everyone is looking at a parachutist falling rapidly with an important balancing movement. Close to the ground, hopefully, it seems the balancing slow down, as the going down speed. No more can we see him again when he disappears behind the trees, in Saint-Yves direction. During this time, on the Lannoc, our cousins the the Lissillour, saw another airman landing around Dirinon. 20:30-20:45, Strong explosion and a big fume in this same direction. What I would like to know or get would be the following : The lost B-26 (s) type, serial number, nickname and crew, with copies of the complete Macrs if possible. Any photo of these crews or aircraft. A way to get in touch with any 322 Sqn who took part to that August 9th 1944 raid to Brest. Many thanks for any help you can provide.

Sgt. Chapman followed Sgt Henderson out, rest of crew remained with B26 which landed at Strip A-14 Normandy. Sgt. Chapman landed 1 1/2 miles from enemy lines and approximately 4 1/2 miles from Allied lines. On landing Sgt Chapman was taken by four French ladies to a nearby farm. From here he was taken to nearby woods, by a small French boy and told to remain hidden until dark. At dusk a Frenchman brought him civilian clothes and took him to a house to be fed. Afterwards he was taken to a haystack where he spent the night. Just before daylight he was collected and given breakfast before being taken to another hiding place. At around 10:00 AM the Frenchman returned and told Sgt. Chapman that Sgt. Henderson was also safe. Chapman requested that he should be taken to see Henderson but was advised that this was not safe there being many Germans in the proximity. At approximately 3.00 PM a patrol of the 86th Reconnaissance Company 6th Armored Division came over and picked Sgt. Chapman up. There was no MACR since both men returned to their unit.\n\nTrevor J Allen\n\nHistorian\n\nwww.b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n11/28/2002\n\nTime:\n\n9:06:41 PM\n\nLt.

Russ McClintock\n\nRuss,\n\nThe records of the 319th Bomb Group have proved to be very elusive and do not appear to have been retained since no USAF agency has copies or even The National Archives. As a consequence information on the 319th Bomb Group is very thin on the ground. However, what we do know is that on 18 June 1943 the 437th Bomb Squadron ship 41-31603 frown by Roger Zeller and crew was shot down over Olbia. What we do not know is the full crew list as these were missing. The good news however is that there was a missing aircrew report raised.

The reason I am writing this is to find out some information on a relative. My great-grand father's brother Roscoe D. Orr was a Flight Officer on a B-26, and was shot down off the coast of Sicily I believe. He was shot down sometime in July of 1943. Is there anything you can tell me about the circumstances regarding his death? Are there other sources that I could use to find out more about his death? Thank you for your time. Matt Ramsdell\n\nMatt,\n\nJuly 24th 1943 the 320th Bomb Group bombed the Marino di Paolo railroad yards in Italy. Thirty six B26's took off, escorted by P38 fighters of the 14th Fighter Group. On the first run the formation dropped its 500lb general purpose bombs, but missed the target. One flight of 443rd Marauders elected to come back for a second run, and this time scored several hits. As they turned for home they were hit by approximately twenty five Me109's. In the ensuing 45 minute air battle, the B26's shot down four of the enemy fighters and probably destroyed four more. However, Marauders 800 and 763 piloted by Lt Walter E. White and F/O Roscoe D. Orr, both of the 443rd, were shot down. Each crashed into the sea, one making a good water landing, but the other went in with both engines on fire and exploded. Only two parachutes were seen. The unlucky flights other four B26's were heavily damaged, three would never fly again, but all managed to limp to landings at Palermo.\n\nTrevor J Allen, Historian\n\nDate:\n\n11/12/2002\n\nTime:\n\n5:07:06 PM\n\nHarold Parks BombGp: 22 Squadron: 2 Years: 1939-1945.

He was stationed first at Andrews Air Force Base (about 1939), then upon the Pearl Harbor bombing was moved to Langley Field, VA. His unit stopped at Muroc Dry Lake for training on its way to the Pacific. He was stationed in Townesville, Australia from what the stories he used to tell...and his unit flew bombing missions north.

My Grandfather, Gerald Howard, was a pilot for the B-26 Marauder in the European Theatre, and was a Lt. colonel. He flew 70 missions over Germany, including the Battle of the Bulge. His nickname was 'Canary' because he painted a canary on his B-26 each time his crew shot down a German plane. One of the very few stories he told about WWII was the one where he and his crew were coming back from a mission and had some pretty good damage to their B-26. The plane came in for a landing and the landing gear was damaged and would not go down. My grandfather landed the plane without the gear down, and he said it was one heck of a ride. After the plane stopped, my grandfather sat on top the his B-26 and wept. One high ranking officer came to him, put his arm around him and said, \"Don't worry son, we'll get you another one.\" My grandfather passed away 9-28-01, he was 81. Thank You, Jason Grimmett (grandson)\n\nJason, did you know that your grandfathers planes were named \"The Howard Hurricane \" and \"The Howard Hurricane II\"?

I am looking for anyone who might have served with my brother, Harold W. (Bill) Morgan. He was in the 8th, spent 1943 and 1944 in England and France. He was a pilot and as far as I can remember his plane was called Morgan's Midgets since he was the tallest of the crew. I think he did about 44 or 45 missions at the ripe old age of 22. He entered at Randolph Field, Illinois in early 1942 I think. Bill died on his 55th birthday in 1975. As with most of the vets from WWII he never talked much about his time overseas. He was recalled during the Korean conflict but stayed in the US. He has a grandson who is looking for a picture of his granddad and the B-26. The only thing I have is about 20 letters he had sent my mom. I am the sole survivor of the original family but idolized my brother as he was about 10 years older. I have heard from other pilots that the B-26 was a very difficult plane to master. I know he was a 1st Lt. and learned to fly all over the country including Dodge City, KS. One address I found was 589th B Sqdrn 394th B Group. Bill was a private pilot after he came home and diddled around with school a little until he found a job doing what he loved. He was a pilot for Viersen-Cochran Drilling in Okmulgee, OK and flew an Aero-Commander Turbo-Prop at the time of his death. Anyone who might know of him or his group, help would be appreciated.

Thanks for your help in this matter Oliver A Pettit\n\nOliver - 21st June 1941 about two minutes into take off for an acceptance flight B26 serial number 40-1386 crashed into woods near the factory at Middle river, Maryland. Not only was there little wreckage suitable for study, but the Air Corps' report is missing. In fact there may never have been one as the plane was not yet Army property. The news media reported a backfire followed by smoke suggesting an engine problem. However, hearsay spread among the 22nd Bomb Group that the plane rolled over and crashed due to a flap malfunction. Most likely the cause will never be known. Martin lost copilot A.J. Bowman and the Army lost Lt.

Briggs and was a navigator on B-26's. In recent e-mails with Ted and Ray Harwood, they seem to confirm that Art is indeed the 'navigator' as seen in the 'the crew' pictures and the 'bombardier?' as seen in 'the people' pictures of your web sight. Do you confirm this too? Also, my uncle gave my dad a picture of 3 b-26's with flak all around them and he told my dad that he was the navigator on the flight and a friend died on that mission. Also, he gave my dad a picture through a bombsight of the port of Dieppe. The flight of 3 B-26's picture is also found on the b26 tail gunner web site, page 3, 9th picture down. The Harwood's told me that it is a 456th plane the \"Ole 33\" (Is this the whole name, I ve seen reference to 'Ole 33 and Gal'?), the mission date was June 20, 1944, the mission was over Dieppe, the bombardier was Dale Rush and he died and the tail gunner named S/Sgt Johnnie McClelland also died. DO you have record of the navigator on board the lead plane in the picture? Or who the pilot may be? I have other questions, but am hopeful to hear from you soon on these. Thank you Jeff Briggs\n\nJeff,\n\nThe records for both missions on June 20 1944 are missing so I cannot confirm the full crew make up of 1.Lt Paul E Warf's (pilot) B26.

There was crew of 8 and they weren't found 'til years later. Several things I am seeking. #1 - Donald was on the flight with the his two non-com mates, not the regular crew officers. The flight had 8 on board, 4 officers, 4 non-coms. I have his original crew picture with his regular crew taken in April 1944, shortly after they became operational. #2 - His widow nor any other family member to my knowledge received his personal belongings nor his medals. Presumably, some or all of the officers of his regular crew are still alive. They are Capt. John A. Dolan, Lt. Lance, Lt. Barker.

Yes Melvin Craig was trained on B26's and flew out to the Mediterranean Theatre as a B26 crew member, but then was transferred to a B17 unit to make up for combat losses. This was not an unusual practice, in fact it occurred frequently. The citation for the Air Medal was sourced by the 15th Air Force which was the strategic bomber component in the area operating B24 and B17 airplanes. All B26 Groups in the area came under the control of the 12th. Air Force. I suggest that you now look up which B17 Bomb Groups were operating around January 11 1944. Then it is a simple progression to find which Group or Groups attacked targets near Athens, Greece on that date.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrevor Allen\n\nHistorian, b26.com\n\nDate:\n\n10/23/2002\n\nTime:\n\n2:03:41 AM\n\nJohn M.

Escaped to Switzerland till end of War.\n\nOriginally I joined the 573rd Squadron of the 391st Bomb Grp., and started flying missions January 19,1945. \"Little Pink Panties\" was one of the planes our crew flew missions in. We also flew missions in \"Little Gal\". On April 4,1945 my crew was broken up so the pilot could fly on A-26s and I was reassigned to the 387th Grp., 559th Squadron. On April 16th, our squadron was assembled to fly our second mission of the day. I do not remember what plane we were assigned to fly in. We were on a mission to Tuttlingen when the plane took a direct hit in the left engine and began losing altitude. The pilot ordered us all to commence the bail out procedure. I was the second man out of the plane, landing about 40 miles inside Germany. I spent four days and four nights walking through Germany, arriving at the Rhine River on April 20th at the town of Laufenberg. I attempted to swim the Rhine River, narrowly missing the dam's intake, being pulled out of the river by Swiss soldiers. I was sent to an internment camp at Adelboden for the remainder of the war in the ETO. The tail gunner was taken prisoner by German soldiers. The Co-pilot, Bombardier and Engineer/gunner also made it into Switzerland. The pilot, named Reed, was killed; his chute being full of flak. I completed 26 missions.\n\nJohnnie,\n\nIf you were on the crew of \"Little Pink Panties\" you would have been in the 573rd Bomb Squadron.

I have a question that has been bothering me for many years. My dearest friend and College fraternity brother flew B-26s in N. Africa. Do you have any record of a Robert G. Smith as pilot in the N. African campaign, and where he was assigned afterward? I have been trying to reach him for years. Bob Destiche (Desty)\n\nBob,\n\nWhenever anyone asks me to identify men who flew B26's in the M.T.O I put my running shoes on since it is an almost impossible thing to do. Unlike the IX. AAF the 42nd Bomb Wing B26 Groups, 17th, 319th and 320th very poor records and almost no loading lists. It appears that at the end of hostilities they were lost somewhere between France and AFHRA. For years researchers have been trying every avenue to locate them, but with no luck. Unless I have a Bomb Group to start with it is an hopeless task. I am sorry to be so negative, but that is the situation. Regards, Trevor\n\nDate:\n\n10/13/2002\n\nTime:\n\n1:16:44 PM\n\nBoyd V.

I am helping my son do a history project on his grand father (my wife's father) who was a pilot in the 394th Bomb Group. His name was John Dibrell. The focus of the project is \"Rights and Responsibilities in History\" My son has to select a historical figure and comment on the rights and responsibilities of that person. It's a bit easier to see the incredible responsibilities these young men had. However, did they have any rights, so to speak? We read Stephen Ambroses book on B-24 Liberator pilots and he wrote that the pilots had the right to turn down a mission if they thought it was too risky or hazardous, without prejudice.. Was this same right afforded to B-26 pilots? Can you comment on the daily life/routine of a \"typical B-26 pilot and crew or refer us to a good narrative? Thank you. Scott Barnard\n\nRE: Scott Barnard, Guest book date 10/12/02. Subject: Grandson report on \"Rights & responsibilities.... . Question asked is: Did B 26 pilots have the same right as quoted; \"he wrote that (b24) pilots had the right to turn down a mission etc. .... .My reply as a B26 WW2 combat pilot with 65 missions in European theater,17 BG, 95 Sqd. is: NO. If there were such an unmilitary like right everyone would know about it if the unimaginable event ever occurred. We did our job & were not cowardly. Later as a commander I assigned crews & could choose my own missions if there were enough pilots to assign. I deliberately wanted & chose the most dangerous missions. Not as a hero but a 20 year old Captain that never met anyone that would make the type of request you mentioned. You will look for an answer forever & not find a different response to your question. I still have all my mental capacity but perhaps the one who said otherwise may have had \"shell shock\" or had changed to a life of fantasy? Max Petrisek serial # XXXX540. PS Feel free to check out this source! Follow-up:\n\nI can assure you no offense was intended. My father too was a B-26 Pilot in WWII with 394th BG, 584th Squadron. My father is no longer alive for my son or myself to ask these questions of. We read the Stephen Ambrose book \"The Wild Blue\". It is stated in that book that any pilot (the book's focus was the B-24) could refuse a mission if he feared for his life. Certainly it seemed a bit odd to us, and all my husband wanted was a confirmation of this to be fact or fiction. In looking for \"Rights and Responsibilities\" (the history fair theme) it seemed to us that the responsibilities were many and obvious. Finding what rights a military pilot might have was more challenging. We had hoped to show that this may have been a pilot's right, but was exercised by none.\n\nI am very proud of my father and each and every serviceman of WWII. I would never explore this subject looking for cowardice or dereliction of duty.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLisa Pavlica\n\nDate:\n\n10/11/2002\n\nTime:\n\n5:09:21 AM\n\nHenry Jaworski BombGp: 322 Squadron: 452 Years: 1944.

I was looking for a site about the 558th Bomb Squadron, 387th BBG to tell my Dad (William E. Tully Jr.) about so that he can view it himself. I saw the picture of the plane \"Lil-Li-Marlene\" on the Harkins page. I put an album together in April for my father's birthday, which contains all of the photos he took during WWII. This plane was in one of the picture, as were the metal buildings some of the soldiers on these pages are standing beside. Of course, I have all the pages typed on a floppy disk and cannot find that particular disk to list the crew members' names. My father was a radio technician. He has photos of captured German planes, a \"walk\" his crew took through one of the cities in France that was bombed, and various other photos that are priceless. My dad is alive and well living in Jacksonville, FL. He and my mother have been married for 57 years. He met my mom at a USO dance in Savannah, GA. He proposed to her in 1941 and she waited for him to return fro! m the war and they married in 1946. He does have some \"nicknames\" of the crew members he served with, but I'm not sure if this will help one of the gentleman (or their relatives) viewing this message to recognize the names. When I tell him about this site, I'm sure he'll be very excited. For those of you who served in WWII, thank you very much for serving and I hope everyone will get a chance to see these photographic memories. When and if I figure out how to place his photos here, I will do so. You'll love it.

Unfortunately, I have forgotten the name of the airplane. I think it is likely that it was the B-26, although it could appropriately have applied to another aircraft or actually any aircraft. My grandfather studied to be an airplane mechanic shortly before WWII, he was born in 1905 and too old to have been in the war. He lived in Detroit so it seems likely that he saw the above mentioned airplane at either the Detroit City airport (where he took his courses) or at Willow Run Airport where they did have 6 B-26's used for training mechanics. No one at Willow Run remembers the plaque. Everyone I have talked to seems to think that no factory ever put such a place on any airplane and that it could have been the crew and that the place was on only one airplane. I would like to know more about this and would appreciate more information if anyone remembers such a thing. Thank you, Kevin Link\n\nDate:\n\n10/1/2002\n\nTime:\n\n1:49:49 PM\n\nS/Sgt. Donald W.

My dad's nickname was \"Jump\". He was a First Lt. and flew 13 missions. I remember him saying that he didn't always fly with the same crew members. I do remember him talking about a buddy named \"Hedges\". Dad went to High School in Lacrosse, Indiana and played the violin and piano. During pilot training, Dad spent time at Shreveport, La., San Antonio, Tex., Fredrick, Oklahoma. Dad recieved 2 Air Medals, the American Theater Service Medal, European African Middle Eastern Service Medal, German Occupation Medal, and the Victory Medal.... Dad passed away in 1979 after raising 2 sons who were very proud of him. Just before he died, he and I took a little trip to Wright Patterson A.F. Museum and I was able to get a few pictures of him standing next to the B-26 that is on display. I wish the pictures would have turned out.

Ark. Best wishes to all B26ers & their relatives & friends. Prior to Pilot training I graduated from Aircraft Mechanic School in Keesler Field, Biloxi, Miss. While I \"sweatted-out\" getting into Cadets. I flew 63 missions out of Sardinia, Corscia, & Dejon, France. My original combat crew included Joe Shopes, pilot & Cam Tensi, Bomb./Navigator. We flew over on the Southern route ending to a staging facility in N. Africa. There we spent a few weeks with an assignment to train French pilots in new B26. In Sardinia the 3 of us were fortunate to be bunked with a pro pilot Lt. Roberts. Roberts was a mover & shaker & soon we had the best tent in the Sqd., concrete floors, brick walls behind the canvas sides, a chute for our ceiling, sink with hot & cold running water. We were next to the shower area & soon had other luxuries as home made furniture, special booze, fruit & connections due to Roberts personality. Cam who was Italian was also helpful in making connections with the natives. We accepted extra assignments as Officer of: Motor Pool, Mess Hall & Bar & I being an eager beaver became Training Officer. With Roberts connections we soon were flying to Sicily to haul back special food, traded with natives & the \"loaded\" US Navy. Yes, there were missions which for us started around the conclusion of Anzio Beach Battle. It was amazing how little combat simulation or indoctrination we had. I was lucky, my 1st mission was with Capt \"Marty\" Martinson as the cool pilot. There was never a finer Mentor. He later was flight Operations Officer. After many missions \"Marty\" & Major \"Bohmant\" assigned me to fly as Command Pilot on a 24 plane mission. With luck & lot of concern, \"all returned\", my job was accomplished! Might have been the youngest Command Pilot in the AF as I was only 20. Regretfully Schoeps, Tensi, & tail gunne"
