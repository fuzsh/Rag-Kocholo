        "text": "I was stationed at SRAFB from 1957 to 1959and was attached to the 7520th USAF Hospital at the base. The hospital was located in the extreme left corner of the base perimeter as one faced the main base entrance. (sorry don't remember directions). Up from the hospital was a line of barracks. My outfit was originally in last barracks (furthest from the hospital), but moved to either the first or second barracks in the row.\n\nSeems as through the base headquarters was on the main street as one entered the base. As this was a headquarters base there was no flight line as is obvious from its location.\n\nThe base housed a movie theater, BX (Base Exchange) which also included a small grocery store, liquor store, gymnasium, a bank, and a if memory serves me correctly a small golf course was located at the back of the base. Not sure whether this course belonged to the base or belonged to the city.\n\nAgain if my faulty memory is correct, living on the base precluded you from purchasing groceries, liquor, or beer at the base stores. Don't know why this restriction was in place, but the word was to prevent the resale of such items to the local population. Not very credible as the locals surely had access to these items at there local markets. Also if you lived off base either married or single, you could purchase from these stores.\n\nScript (looked like monopoly money) was issued in lieu of the regular U.S. Greenbacks. The script was used to purchase items on the base. Script was converted to pounds, shillings, etc. at the base bank. Don't recall the exchange rate at the time. I believe script was used to keep U.S. currency off the black market. I do remember that the script was changed every so often. The timing of this change was bizarre. The change was never announced except at the moment it occurred. The moment was usually early in the morning when everyone was deep in sleep. Someone would go through the barracks loudly waking everyone telling them to report to a certain building and to bring their script. Exchange for the new would occur at that time. Again, I guess this was to keep the black-marketeers off balance.\n\nJim\n\nI was stationed there in the early sixties and can answer a few of your questions (ROL asked some early contributors a few specific questions).\n\n1.You got in through the front gate which was manned 24 hours a day by USAF AP's(air police) at night, the base was patrolled by British Air Ministry constables and their dogs. If you were American military you had access 24 hours a day, British employees, there were many, had access when they were working, no matter the time of day.\n\n2.The function of the base was administrative due to it being the Third Air Force H.Q. Commanded by Brigadier General Puryer, but the real function of the base was as a communication center with a sister base at a RAF site in Hillingdon.\n\n3.There was a large hospital there, it was well staffed and I remember it to be a fully commissioned acute care facility capable of handling all emergencies. There were barracks for the lower rank enlisted blokes both male and female, there was a large dining hall,a large gymnasium, a club for the non commissioned officers and a beer bar for the lower ranks. Officers used the Douglas club in London, there was also a large cafeteria and a post office (South Ruislip was designated APO 125 for postal purposes) .\n\n4.In the sixties we used American money on the base but had to exchange it for pounds sterling to spend off base, in 1964 the exchange rate for one pound was $ 2.80 prior to 1960 script money was used on the base, I think it was like Monopoly money it was printed and distributed by the USAF.\n\n5.The base was entirely USAF and UK Air Ministry (not too many). I have no idea why the base was closed or when, if you learn why and when I would like to know.\n\n6.Yes if you were stationed there you worked there or at Hillingdon or at another base in Denham. The base in South .Ruislip was like a very small town it had every thing it needed. Lord I wish I was 22 years old again and back there.............................\n\nJoe\n\n(If you wrote this please contact Ruislip Online)\n\nBetween 1954 and 1957, our family lived in Pembroke Road, Ruislip, while my father was stationed at USAF High Wycombe. The USAF base in South Ruislip then was Headquarters, US Third Air Force. It had close ties to auxiliary bases at Eastcote and Bushy Park, as well as High Wycombe, Lakenheath, Burderop Park and Brize Norton. I do not know if the South Ruislip base existed until the newer base in West Ruislip that you mention. Local to Ruislip during the time we were there, there was only the South Ruislip base and its auxiliary in Eastcote.\n\nVia the No. 158 bus, we frequently visited the base in South Ruislip for USAF dependents' activities, such as medical and dental examinations at the USAF hospital, movies, using the base library, Post Exchange and commissary, base chapel, and attending sports events. In 1955, my youngest brother was born, and, in 1956, my next youngest brother had his appendix removed at the base hospital there. I earned my \"Eagle Scout\" award while a member of the American Boy Scout troop at the base and at Denham Commons.\n\nI was stationed there from 65-68. Lived briefly on base, then moved off base to Pinner. Today I couldn't tell you where except it was on main street and just down the road from the police station.\n\nOne of my roommates who also was stationed at the 7520th worked at the West Ruislip annex. I remember that the airman's club was there but that the NCOs club and officers club was at South Ruislip.\n\nI know that everyone had ration cards for cigs and booze. Script money was over with when I was there. The hospital itself was I believe 120 beds and was quite busy and had many doctors. Even had a flight surgeon and several specialists and a pharmacy.\n\nI later moved to Ruislip Gardens which was closer to the base.\n\nThere was a pub there called the Clay Pigeon that we used to go to that was near. Though I went to a pub/dance hall in Uxbridge that was closer to someone that I cared for and fancied at the time.\n\nJohn(Bob)(Mongoose) White\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip from 1958-1960. I was in the Air Police and there was a tight knit group of people there. I have spent years trying to locate personnel there when I was. About 3 years ago it all started coming together and there are now seven of us who has found each other. I worked at both the main base and Hillingdon. I have been back over a few times only to find the base closed and gone the last time.\n\nI am now in touch with bill \"Rube\" Ruppenstein, Utah \"Mac\" McIntosh, Chuck Watson, Max Brickey Schoenrock, Nathen Hall (Horace Pope) deceased last year and I am Oren \"Don\" Campbell. We would love to hear from anyone else who knew any of us.\n\nI have a few photos from the base and will post them to this site later when you think it may be ready. (These are the ones on this page - ROL) Don Campbell\n\nThanks so much for getting in touch, it seems the Base at South Ruislip is some what of a mystery, My partner and I have what we feel a very interesting web site, http://www.syd@alliesinwar (may not now be a valid web site) covering many subjects about all the services. Our idea was born by the fact I as many English girls married Americans from the South Ruislip Air Force Base, and they employed mostly English people from in and around South Ruislip. The hospital there, had quite a few children born there, so anything you can do to help us would be great.\n\nFor myself I was thrilled to find the Ruislip Lido on your site, and my now grown up children are enjoying seeing the place their Mother went to, as a child is still there and seems to be going strong.\n\nThe Base at South Ruislip was the Third Air Force H Q but it seems very little is known about any clubs or groups formed while the base was still open, and after it was closed.\n\nWe are hoping people will tell us their personal funny stories In the case of my husband and I it was sharing one bathroom, with four other couples in a large house on the side of Roxeth Hill Road that had been made into bed sitters where we all learned a brand new wait your turn dance (laughingly known as the The Wait your turn waltz), and our landlord became very concerned about the amount of bath water we had in our bath tub, and suggested we should do all our bathing at the base, We all learned to love that old house, during the time we were there ,and even our (make a different rule every day landlord) for the young couples that lived there.\n\nOne rule we still laugh at, he only rented to Officers so it wasn't long before the Airman loaned out their uniforms, in order to get by his renters interview leaving their name tag off. He never did catch on he didn't have four Base Commanders renting from him, but for us it was fun and gives us a lot of fond memories.\n\nAs far we know the buildings were put up in 1949 and we believe that the buildings were originally intended as warehouses. The Americans took the site over we think in 1950.\n\nMy sister worked on the base and she said that the buildings were awful - no windows in the blocks (this would confirm that the building were intended as warehousing).\n\nA later addition was a tunnel under the railway line into the fields on the other side, which were used as sport fields for the American Service men.\n\nAnother later addition was the hospital that the Americans built at the side.\n\nAs to why they came to South Ruislip I assume it was the close proximity to Northolt Airfield. The Americans (USAF) had offices on the Southside of Northolt Airfield - (Post BEA). Later still they moved from Northolt to the 4MU at West Ruislip.\n\nI worked for the Civil Service MOD and for the USAF at Northolt in the drawing office (1956). At this time they were developing the many airfield sites around the country like Alconbury, Mildenhall, Lakenheath and High Wycombe.\n\nAn interesting side step to this is that the English built all the dependant housing for the American - we called them tobacco housing - the Americans gave us tobacco and we paid for the dependant housing - the agreement being when the Americans vacated the housing they reverted to the local Governments - that is why when you see ex USAF housing being sold off they are so cheap.\n\nThe USAF page brought back memories of childhood and how the presence of the Americans livened up the area! Conductors on the 158 bus used to call out \"Texas!\" as the buses neared the stop outside the base and I think Larry Hagman (JR in Dallas) once said he was stationed at South Ruislip.\n\nMy father-in-law was a top U.S. Air Force Top Sergeant and served several tours of duty in the U.K. On of which was at South Ruislip Air Station from September 1962 to September 1966.\n\nThe South Ruislip Air Station was just east of Northolt Airport on the next road north of route 40. The entrance was on the south side of this road. The gates were manned by U.S.A.F. Military Police. U.S.A.F. Military Personnel had special decals on their vehicles to get in and out at all hours. Anyone else had to have special permission to access the station. The South Ruislip Air Station was HQ for the U.S.A.F. Third Air Force, which commands all U.S.A.F. units in the U.K.\n\nPersonnel worked at the station and lived nearby. Inside the Station were many supporting elements such as a hospital, shops, commissary, personnel offices, child care facilities, a post exchange, and a bank. The money median of exchange was dollars.\n\nMy family lived at No. 3, Whiteheath Ave., Ruislip. We have a friend, Al, who lived locally, that we still communicate with. There were American schools at West Ruislip, Eastcote and an American High School (upper grades) at Bushy Park. My husband attended Whiteheath when he first started school. On his first day there, while the other\n\nchildren came in uniforms, he showed up in blue jeans. This is where he learned the beautiful British accent that he will sometimes do for me. He is a \"Brit\" at heart.\n\nRAF Northolt was used by both RAF and USAF in a support capacity. I am not familiar with a USAF Unit at Ickenham. (My error, it is USN apparently, RO)\n\nWe were in London in 1999, but because we had about 100 students with us on tour with the Tennessee Ambassadors of Music, we did not get to come to Ruislip. We plan to come back and be able to spend some time and come back to where my husband spent only four short years of his young life; but believe me, these were the most impressionable years he ever spent\n\nbecause our love of your country only grows as we listen to the BBC news on the internet or watch the BBC news. No fancy shows like the US news, just to the point and we like that!\n\nMy father-in-law is very proud of his service to our country and he is very proud of having the opportunity to spend time in the UK. My mother-in-law is very proud of the shopping she did there years ago and has told us some places to go if they are still around when we do get to come back.\n\nAnybody out there? I would love to hear from anybody who knew A/2C John McDaniel, pay clerk, HQ Squadron, HQ 3D AF.(1-59 to 1-60), especially 1st Sgt Sam Robinson. Sam, I still have the TS card you initialled for me. Please, anybody whose TDY voucher got screwed up, I did the best I could.. Then there was A/2C Joe Wachoviak from Waukegan, Ill., A/2C Al Clem from LeRoy, Kansas and A/2C Dave Abromowitz from Long Island, NY. Hey guys, was it really that much fun, or is my memory screwed up too. Let's go do the Royal Ascot again. Maybe we can win as much as Dave did in the pools.\n\nIt would be great to hear from any of you.\n\nJohn McDaniel\n\nBoth my sister and myself married guys from the South Ruislip base. I had my first son Steven Robert Shaw born Nov 30 1960 in the base hospital. My sister and her husband were moved Oxford. My husbands name is Robert Shaw, and we are from Pennsylvania and my sisters husband was Greg Smith Oakland California.\n\nPatricia Shaw. (email address held by Ruislip Online)\n\nMy name is Anthony Alatis. I was stationed at Ruislip in 1951-53. General Leon W. Johnson was our commander in the 3rd Air Force. I was in special services. I did work for the University of Maryland Extension Courses which many service men took advantage of. I also was one of the four artists that painted the huge mural in the mess hall. The subject was \"America\" with \"Scarlet O'Hara\" as the centerpiece. >From Columbus arriving to rockets flying into space. Everything was covered. I arrived in time to help load a few planes that were flying food into Berlin. I would love to contact anyone from that time period\n\nI worked as a civilian carpenter and joiner for the EES @ West Ruislip US Airbase in 1967. We carried out works nationally at airbases such as Wethersfield, Chicksands, Burtonwood, Upper Heyford, Lakenheath etc driving Chevrolet Step Vans to get there. It was during the Vietnam War and some of our duties were very sad to say the least. Are there any other people (civilians) from West Ruislip Base keeping in touch with your site? Dick Galley\n\nHow interesting to find a site devoted to USAF South Ruislip. This was my first base in the UK after basic training at Lackland AFB Texas and tech training at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. I arrived there in June 1956 and being a draftsman was assigned to the graphics department making posters for the generals briefings. This lasted for about six months when they found out I was British and not eligible for top secret projects, I was there upon assigned to base planning which was located at RAF Northolt, the USAF part of the base and worked with mostly MOD personnel, however there were other USAF personnel there and a small PX.\n\nWe did the base planning for most of the bases in the UK, Manston, Brize Norton, Fairford amongst others. I had emigrated to the States in Decemeber 1955 and joined the USAF about a week after arriving in Springfield Mass.\n\nWas quite a surprise for them to send me back to the UK for my first fours years in the air force. My wife joined me in Ruislip and we lived first in Harrow on the Hill then in South Harrow and later in Watford. I have often wondered about the friends I had there but have never been able to contact them.\n\nI have a few pictures taken while I was there and will attach them in case you want to use them.\n\nRonald Coupe\n\nHouston Texas\n\nI just located your very interesting web site about the USAF Base at South Ruislip.\n\nI was stationed there as my first duty station from Mar 1967-Mar 1973. I was an Airman 3rd Class assigned as a Veterinary Specialist to the 7520th USAF Hospital. I departed when the base closed in early 1973 and we all moved to High Wycombe to finish out our tours.\n\nAs a Veterinary Specialist my job was to inspect all food, food processing, storage and preparation areas at South & West Ruislip as well as the local British establishments.\n\nI inspected the service clubs in downtown London; the Douglas House for the enlisted and the Columbia Club for Officers. We also inspected the NCO Club on South Ruislip Base and the Officer's Club across the street, as well as the Airman's club on West Ruislip.\n\nWest Ruislip is now occupied by the US Navy and the greater part of the old West Ruislip Base has been taken by the the Ickenham Council for housing. The Base chapel remains outside the Base gates as does a school. West Ruislip contains the FPO, Commissary and NAVEX, the Anchor Club plus a small shopping mall barber shop etc.\n\nMy family visited the Base in 1987 when the buildings were still there, but no more, South Ruislip Air Station is completely gone.\n\nI have so many good memories of South Ruislip. My wife and I lived in Harrow-on-the-Hill, Hillingdon and finally in Hayes. Our son was born at the 7520th Hospital in 1970.\n\nI intended to make the Air Force a career but joined the US Army in 1981 as a 1st Lieutenant and rose to the rank of Colonel. My wife and I moved back to England in September 2003 and currently live in South Ruislip only a short walk from the old base, which I pass every day!\n\nArt Heck, a former 7520th USAF Hospital Dental Tech, lives just down the street from me. We both attend the same parish, St. Andrew's Lutheran in Ruislip. It is a small world indeed.\n\nI have many, many stories about South Ruislip that I would be glad to share if you think there is an interest.\n\nAnyone wishing to contact me please feel free to do so.\n\nJames Hoke\n\nI was a USAF medic stationed at South Ruislip from January 1968 through July 1971. I worked at the 65 bed hospital there (primarily in the labor and delivery rooms and newborn nursery).\n\nOur chief of obgyn was Dr. Sandford Markham. Our other doctors included Dr. Ainsworth Dudley, Dr. Gary Fisher, and a British doctor Dr. MacNee.\n\nI remember many of the nurses and medical staff: Helen Ludi, Eileen LeCompte, Maria Andino, Mary Boyd, Alma Brundage, Anthony Juliano, David Rolls, Charles Horn, Myra Hardin, Barry Wheatley, Jack Murray, Ray Kelly, Andy Durey, Robert Scro, Robert Babenroth, Bob Bauer, and others.\n\nI lived on base for the first year and then shared a flat on Dell Farm Road very near Ruislip Lido. If any of you recognize any of the names I've mentioned or any of those mentioned should visit this site, please feel free to contact me at carlinjamesa @ msn.com\n\nI enjoyed my time in England and look back on it with fond memories.\n\nI am Paul K. Ayres. I too was assigned to the 7520th USAF Hospital from Sept 69 to Sept 71.\n\nI was a Veterinary Technician and worked at South Ruislip, West Ruislip, and Eastcote. I helped move the Veterinary Food Laboratory to RAF Lakenheath back in 1971. I also worked in âClass 3â food inspection in beef and poultry plants. I served as an independent duty technician at High Wycombe shortly before it closed. Ironically, I returned to England in 1985 and in 1991 was selected as the 3AF Command Chief Master Sergeant, serving in that position until 1995 at RAF Mildenhall.\n\nWhile in England, my wife Judy (an ex- Veterinary Technician as well at S. Ruislip back then) went back to see South Ruislip on a TDY trip to High Wycombe and RAF Uxbridge. Boy had the area changed. The base was still there, but locked down and filled with scrap. West Ruislip was only half of what it had been while I was stationed there, and the Navy now owned and operated it.\n\nOne of my daughters was born at the S. Ruislip Hospital and Dr. MacNee was the physician. I have kept up with a few of the folks from there at that time â¦ and have passed this web site on to them so they can add their comments too.\n\nPaul\n\nSouth Ruislip was my first posting after leaving training school at Warren AFB, Wy, in August 1955, I just turned 18 years old. I remember the best part of being stationed in South Ruislip was its close proximity to London, a tube (subway) ride away. In May of 1956, I was sent to Denham Studios and stayed there until 1959, however, I continued to go to SR almost every day while stationed at Denham. I met a wonderful woman named Ann from South Harrow and married her in August 1958 and we're still together, we lived in South Harrow until 1959.\n\nAnn and I used to go dancing at the Service Club in South Ruislip on Wednesday nights for many years. I was known as \"Chico\" at that time, it was my nick name. I truly remember the Tithe Farm pub where a lot of the American servicemen went to dance with the local ladies, all of whom were absolutely beautiful and ended up marrying quite of few of the American Airmen, me included. We also spent many nights and weekends at the Eastcote Arms pub, the next \"round-a-bout\" up from South Ruislip.\n\nI simply can't begin to tell you of all the wonderful times during my time in South Ruislip and the many wonderful people I encountered, that's both the American and British people, they were all just great. Now I hear that most of the buildings are jammed with junk or empty which is a shame, so many wonderful memorable times are gone but not forgotten. If anyone remembers me, please feel free to send me an e-mail to annchico @ pacbell.net.\n\nBob Sanabria\n\nHi, I am delighted to find this website on South Ruislip. I was a medic in the 7520th Hosp. I worked in the out-patient department. I answered sick-call and gave shots.\n\nOne morning, I even delivered a baby while on an emergency ambulance run! I loved it there. I met my wife in London and we had two daughters born in the hospital on base. I would like to hear from any of my old buddies: Stan Hesselgren, Leo Gomes, Arthur Ruff who was with the Red Cross, Ronnie Ray, etc. I was there from 1953-1956.\n\nI was born at South Ruislip hospital in the summer of 1958. My father was a serviceman who worked in the 603rd (I think) Communications Group. My mother was an English lady whom my father met and married. They lived in South Harrow on Rowe Walk.. My father was stationed there from 1956 till 1959. My father and mother know more about this time than I do, but were not available to give me any info on it when I came across this site. Steve\n\nHello; Danny Wills here. I was stationed at West & South Ruislip 67-72. Chief clerk in the 7500th AB orderly room then NCOIC of the Distribution Center (located next to the Post Office and Reproduction Center).\n\nStill in touch with Bob Faulkner, he ran the Rec Supply section and Ron Golson, worked in CBPO. Stayed the course, retired in 1986 with nearly 30 years.\n\nRuislip was the best kept secret in the Air Force, folks laugh when I describe the layout of the base. Loved those Thursday night Anglo American darts matches at the NCO Club, I helped organize them, made a few faux pas, like inviting the \"screws\" from Wormwood Scrubs Prison, miserable bunch, then another night I invited too many clubs, I think it was Heinz 57, British Overseas Airways and Wilkinson Sword Razors, over 200 showed up, I think the club capacity was 174, fortunately I knew the fire inspector who was on duty, he took one look inside and walked away shaking his head. John Najarian was Club Manager at the time. Now retired and living just south of Seattle. Thanks for the memories.\n\nBefore clicking on any e-mail link read this section\n\nI met my husband Gerald (Gerry) Stoddard in South Ruislip at the Tythe Farrm, we were married in 1958. Soon after he was posted to Burtonwood. Our son Charles was born there in 1959, where Gerry was the pharmacist at the hospital from 1958 to 1959. After we were wed we lived in London for a while, which is actually where I am from. We were stationed at Kirknewton then came back to the States & had four more children. We now live in Michigan\n\nPearl Stoddard\n\nI am trying to trace any details re a Irving Raymond King (also known as Bob) who was stationed at Ruislip in 1952/53.He may have been there before1952 and after 1953,he was an American servicemen.\n\nAny details would be gratefully received as I am his daughter, trying to find a family trace. I have come to a brick wall at the moment because his Military records were destroyed in\n\na fire.\n\nGreat to read some of your comments. I was stationed at South Ruislip in 66 and 67. Worked in Admin Services. Lived at 131 Harrowdene Rd North Wembley. My son was born there on base in Nov of 66. This was two of the best years of our life. The travel, sights, history and the people were wonderful.\n\nMy wife and son finally after 36 years made it back to England this year, and were able to see where we lived. My memories are too many to elaborate on, but, suffice to say that our years at South Ruislip will always be a part of us, never to be forgotten.\n\nSgt Alan Bresson\n\nCame to South Ruislip in 1960 from Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Worked at RAF Northolt until being sent to Bentwaters Civil Engineers in 1962\n\nAnyone remember Shimshock , or any of the guys in the barracks at South Ruislip in 1960 drop me a line. How about Nick Felicione in the First Sergeants office? I lived off base all the time and we had a ball.\n\nChuck Van Alen\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip from December 1955 to December 1959. and again from 1965-1969.\n\nMany pleasant memories are still with me from my time in England. I met my wife (now of 47 years) there and our first son was born at the hospital on the base. Before getting married, I lived off Field End Road. When married we lived in Ruislip Manor, Northwood Hills and South Harrow.\n\nI have never been back, but the urge is still there and perhaps some day I will.\n\nGeorge Magoon USAF RET.\n\nMy name is Marilyn Faithfull (nee Eedy), I am English and used to live in Harrow during the 1960s.During that time our next door neighbours at 28, Whitmore Rd were all officers in the USAF. These people and their families became good friends and I would like to contact, or hear news of any of them. I particularly remember the Youngblood family whose children I believe were called Melissa, Jinks and Susan and I am fairly certain that they were at Ruislip in 1962 and 63. Can anybody help me to make contact with them or any of the other families who lived there? Any lead would be appreciated.\n\nMarilyn\n\nI have many fond memories during the time I was stationed at South Ruislip from October 1954 till August 1956 in HQ. SQ. 3rd AF.\n\nMy duty section was in the SJA office working for CWO Lorne C. Payne. The court martial that stands out in my mind at least, is one Milosh Turkili(sp), who, with a friend, stole several cases of cigarettes from a warehouse at Denham Studios. They \"flogged\" their booty to a Mr. fisher and Mr. Cohen, two well known characters of London's criminal element. They were in Turkili's car with their loot covered by a blanket. Unfortunately, Fisher and Cohen being so popular with the law enforcement folks, they were noticed by a policeman and when he looked under the blanket all were arrested. Turkili and friend received a DD and time at Leavenworth. Don't know what resulted from the trial of Fisher and Cohen. BTW, Turkili's was an AP.\n\nDon Burge in Frankfort, KY\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip from Jan 70 â May 72. I was transferred âdown thereâ from the 79th TFS at RAF Woodbridge when they converted from the F100 âlead sledâ to F111s. I was assigned to 3rd AF Intelligence, and worked âbehind the Green Doorâ at the end of the hall in the HQs building. I could tell you more about that but then Iâd have toâ¦. Well, you know. I can say that I prepared the Intel slides for the daily briefings given to the 3rd AF commander (but I donât remember who it was at the time). For some time there I was practically a member of the Audio Visual Lab as theyâd see me coming and let me go right in to do my thing on the Ozelit (spelling?) slide making machine.\n\nDuring my two years there I lived in a bed sit in SR and shared a house with a coworker (one Harry McKay) in Harrow Wealdstone. I then met a wonderful Irish girl (Ann OâNeill) working in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch. We were married and lived in a rented apartment on Rydal Way in SR (continuing on Long Drive from the tube station, crossing Victoria Road) from an RAF Colonel (donât remember his name) that we never met.\n\nWe have many fond memories of our time there in SR, from the nights down at âBangersâ on Moscow Road in Bayswater (where we would scorch names and initials on the ceiling with candles while drinking Lowenbrau, and singing songs along with the guy that sat on a stool playing the accordion), and a snowball fight in a snowstorm at midnight on Christmas Eve 1971 in the middle of Queensway, to a Rec Center trip to Rome shortly after we were married.\n\nWe were married at St Gregory the Great Church right there in SR, and had our reception at the NCO club (we didnât have much money then). I remember buying bunches of Daffs at the tube station to bring home to Ann after work, and buying âthe messagesâ at the butcher shop on Victoria Road. I remember many trips in Harry McKayâs old mini, crammed full of people, looking for parties down in London and over in Pinner (the Navy guys had great parties). I remember many, many sightseeing trips all over London as well. I remember Bing Young (rank?), a fellow that worked for 3rd AF personnel, and Col Lester McCloud the DCSI for 3rd AF, Capt Bonnie Markison, Capt Bill Woodin (my bosses while there), and Tsgt Joe Shaw who worked with me and was best man at our wedding. I remember all-night card games in the dorm, and visiting buddies that worked in Data Processing. They showed me a card sorter, and I was so enthralled that I got out of Intelligence and into the Computer field (Iâm still a programmer now). The dorm was divided up into rooms (supposedly it was once a shoe factory) but the rooms had no ceilings, so if you locked yourself out all you had to do was scale the wall.\n\nContact Steven J. Guenther, SMSgt USAF (Ret)\n\nMy father was stationed at South Ruislip from '60 to '62. We lived off base in Stanmore, near Harrow. My parents used to take us to the Columbia Club in London and I recall that as quite ritzy. I remember playing baseball in the Little League on base. We played against other bases and a British team who usually beat us. We were sternly told not to call them \"blokes\".\n\nI don't remember much about the base except standing still for Taps, the movies, the PX, and that there were no airplanes!\n\nMy sister and I went to school at Bushey Hall American School. We have great memories of our time there. We used to ride the tubes and buses by ourselves all over the place.\n\nI remember taking our bikes on an odyssey to Ruislip Lido once with our English friends, of which we had many. I think living in an English neighborhood was the best thing for us because we were really exposed to the culture, much of which you can miss if you live on base. My dad was Maj. Charlie Errickson, and his mission there was as a civil engineer on the BMEWS site built on Fylingsdale Moor on the North Sea near Scotland.\n\nWe were transferred to Andrews AFB in '62 just in time for the Cuban Missle Crisis. I've been back since to see the house we lived in but couldn't possibly remember where the base was.\n\nDavid Errickson\n\nCan anyone help us find Ann and Chico Sananbria, Chico was Bob nick name while at South Ruislip Air Force Base, they were friends of our oldest sister Shirley Bernhardt, who married E Connor, we have tried the e mail address on the South Ruislip Air Force Base site, and understand they may have changed their server company, any help would be great.\n\nBrian and Dawn\n\nI was assigned to South Ruislip from Cheyenne, Wyoming after Technical School and worked in the 1969AACS from 1957 thru 1961.\n\nI married an English girl whom I met in the cafeteria. I returned in 1997 and found it greatly changed, but with most of the original buildings intact.\n\nMy wife has made numerous trips to England and tell me Ruislip and Harrow have changed little. Some with whom we remain in contact are Tom Ivory (California), Ken Edwards (Texas), Lee Olsen (Arizona), Ray Clouden (New Jersey), Tony Dawson (Connecticut), Dick Jarworski (Illinois), and Ray LaFortune (Massachusets). Reviewing the pictures bring back many fond memories. Thanks for the opportunity to relive part of my youth.\n\nFrank Archer\n\nI arrived at South Ruislip in August of 1968. It was my first assignment after Tech School. I was in the Data Automation section as it was known back then; today it would be the IT Dept. I was briefed upon by arrival by Capt. Charles Proffit, and my NCOIC was SMSgt Stanley Gettman. He didn't like me and I didn't like him. I remember working with 2nd generation computers, huge in size but with no power. Most of my time was spent sorting and collating punch cards to eventually feed them through the processor. I worked with TSgt Ron Waters, SSgt Louis Goldfarb, Sgt. Don Bassett, A1C Tom Condon, Airman Glenn Ramsey, and a few others whose names I can't remember.\n\nOff hours were spent working as the bartender at the Airmans Club, to help pay for the tax free Lotus Europa I bought for $2,900. A lot of my time was spent downtown at the London Playboy Club, where a steak dinner cost 10 shillings.\n\nI married a scrub tech named Barbara Hughes who was assigned to the base hospital. The marriage lasted about 6 months, and I haven't seen or heard from her since. Oddly enough though, my current wife was born in the same hospital in 1956, where her father, Robert Marino was stationed there. What a small world.\n\nI first lived in a flat in Rayners Lane, near the tube station. Does anybody remember the pizza restaurant there that was opened by a retired nurse? I later moved to Harrow with Sid Sontag, then later to Harrow-on-the Hill. Eventually, I found my way to infamous house on Frithwood Avenue in Northwood; home of outrageous parties and the World Famous Northwood Nads. And even today, I am in contact with my old friends from 32 years ago thanks to the power of the internet. SH (Clint Macy), Bimbo (Mike McCann), Curley (Joe Pasowitz), Randy Catley, and all the rest of the NADS, who had their reunion in Las Vegas 2 years ago.\n\nI saw America play in Orlando a few weeks ago, and called out to Gerry Beckley, I knew your father, Colonel Beckley; the Base Commander, when America was formed by the 3 members who were students at the American High School.\n\nI discharged from the Air Force in 1973, but stayed in Northwood until March, 1974. I had taken a job with Sprinzel Motor Cars in London selling tax free autos to tourists. I worked for Jon Hull, who many remember as the car salesman who came to South Ruislip selling MGB's.\n\nThose were wonderful years. The talent that played at the club, the many friends from the base, the English friends that I made while living there. And the 3 years I spent playing baseball for the Beckinham Blue Jays of the British Baseball League. Memories I will cherish forever.\n\nMarty Kramer\n\nI am trying to find information re my grandfather service details, no idea where to get them as NARA don't seem to have the relevant information, and I have nowhere else to try.\n\nHe was on the base in 1966, and his name was Forrest R. Hempel, he was a USAF personnel.\n\nWe have some records, but nothing denoting his dependants when he was transferred to South Ruislip for his last tour of duty.\n\nAny help is much appreciated, cause finding these records seem a nigh on impossibility.\n\nThanks\n\nRussell Hempel\n\nWhat a nice surprise this site was to me. Itâs been neat reading the memories of people for whom this was such a large part of their lives, as it was mine.\n\nI was a medic in OBGYN at the hospital from 67 to 70. I recognize names, such as Sid Sontag and Jim Carlin and the other folks he mentioned in his note. I remember others as well: Lin Roberts, Bill Fortune, Paul Carboneaux, Jennifer Clapperton, âJohn the Blokeâ who could do a perfect American accent and more. I include them here in case someone âGooglesâ their name as I did and finds this site!\n\nSomeone mentioned the excellent entertainment at the NCO club. Anyone remember Tina Charles? She was just 16 and singing in the club when I was there. We met just before I returned to the states and corresponded after that for a few letters. I thought she was telling a little story when she said she was going to be on the Tom Jones showâ¦but sure enough she was! She turned out to have quite a successful entertainment career, it seems.\n\nSome other things that that hold fond memories for me: The Royal Standard pub near Beaconsfield; cockles and periwinkles; a peace demonstration outside the base; HAVING to move off base in the London area in the era of Beatles popularity as a single 20 year old enlisted kid because the barracks were so small. And being told NOT to wear your uniform off base.\n\nAlso; midnight chow at the hospital; University of Maryland extension courses; gas rations; British girls; the Ruislip Lido; Die Bierkeller near Queensway; knowing someone who could get you a free call to the States in the middle of the night; Spoly Oly; a BX that had a tailored suit shop, excellent electronics and cameras; riding the tube. It was a grand time.\n\nAndy Durey\n\nCouple of bits of trivia about the USAB:\n\nAbout once a year, in the early 50's, there would be a big fair ground set up in the field on the SW corner at the Station Approach/Victoria Road. Needless to say, the Americans from the base had a ball there and naturally had a lot more money than most of us.\n\nOne time, An American chappy was hurtling around on one of the roundabout thingies, going at quite a rate, when his wallet got thrown out of his back pocket. When it hit the ground, all his $ bills (or pounds...can't remember now) came flying out and were blown all over hells half acre. Well, being the honest Brit kids that we were, we rushed around collecting them all up. When he eventually got off the ride, all white faced, as he obviously couldn't get off even though he knew that he had lost his wallet, he was eternally grateful for our honesty (ahhhhhhhh!!) He gave us five shillings each which in those days was a fortune to us young'ens!!\n\nMy mother asked me to go into Ruislip Manor to buy some pork sausages from \"Hooks\" the butcher. (do you remember that store??) Well, as it turned out, the money that she had given me was insufficient for me to buy the sausages AND bet back home on the bus...so, again, being the great kids that we were in those days, I bought the sausages, and walked all the way home to Deane Ave (S.Ruislip)\n\nOn the way, I just happened to be walking a few yards behind an American Airman with his girlfriend. (no doubt a Brit) Anyway, after about 10 minutes or so. They stopped, looked around at me, came over and handed me a big packet of gum. (Guess I looked hungry, and I guess he was used to kids asking for gum in those days)\n\nAlthough I still had to head in the same direction to get home, It was too embarrassing for me to continue following them, in case they thought I was just plain greedy, so I wandered around a bit, crossed over the road, and continued on my journey home, trying to stay out of sight. (Mum felt bad for not giving me enough money by the way, at least, that's what she said!!)\n\nAs a 17 year old in 1951, I fell in love with my first love. We never forget our \"first\" and he was stationed at Ruislip in the M.P.'s at that time. His name was Joe Keaton and after reading one of your messages, it brought back fond memories of Tithe Farm where we all used to go dancing. I even remember Len at the front door, who sold tickets to get in. A lot of us girls had very little money and we always used to chat Len up and he, more often than not, would let us in without paying. Oh, the wonderful times we had there. I still have a photo of a group of us that went from Tithe Farm into London to the Douglas House! My first love returned back to the States but I never forgot him!\n\nA couple of years later, after taking the civil service exam in London, I got a job at the base as a secretary. This was where I was first introduced to the sport of bowling (I had never heard of it!) and got quite good at it. For some reason, I do not have a lot of memories of working there because I transferred to Bushey Hall as a secretary to a Major who I remember had about six children and two German shepherds that we would bring into work and scare the heck out of us!\n\nI do remember reading a lot of books from the base library because he was hardly ever in the office to give me work! One time I was asked to tend the cloakroom for a dance being held at the Officer's club. The music was so great that after all the coats were checked, I was asked to dance and had a great time! I met my husband to be that night and we were married in 1956 and returned to the States in December of that year. His name was Lt. Eugene Kovary and our best man was Warrant Officer Jack Inman. We were married at the registrar's office in Watford and lived in Watford for a while. I could go on and on, but if anyone would like to correspond with me, I would be thrilled to hear from you!\n\nMy name now is June Hooper nee June English.\n\nWhat wonderful memories! I was stationed at the 7520th Hosp. On one of my trips to London, I went to a club called the \"51 club\". It was there that I met my English rose. We dated and then married. She came from East London but did not have the Cockney accent. Two daughters were born at the base.\n\nWhen we got married, the reception party lasted for two whole days! Everyone just slept around the living room. We fed everyone and we only went out to buy more food and booze. Some of the gang were Leo Gomes, Jose Rey , Ronnie Ray , Larry Scharf from St, Louis, and many other blokes and lassies.\n\nThe party must have been a good send off as we just celebrated our 51st anniversary.\n\nBill Tillar\n\nI met my wife at South Rusilip AS in the summer of 1971, when I was a Security Police Flight Chief. We had responsibility for South Ruislip, RAF West Ruislip, High Wycombe AS, and several auxiliary sites in the London Area. It was one of the choicest assignments in the USAF at the time. It shut down in 1972, Third AF moved to Mildenhall, and the 7500th AB Gp became the 7500 AB Squadron, and eventually moved to High Wycombe AS, and became Det#1, 20th Tactical Fighetr Wing at RAF Upper Heyford.\n\nI always remember that NCO Club was much better than Oak Club, and the Officers were always trying to figure out ways to get into the NCO club for the great shows that we used to have.\n\nIt was a great time, with super memories.\n\nTom Siefring\n\nWhat wonderful memories! I was stationed at the 7520th Hosp. On one of my trips to London, I went to a club called the \"51 club\". It was there that I met my English rose. We dated and then married. She came from East London but did not have the Cockney accent. Two daughters were born at the base.\n\nWhen we got married, the reception party lasted for two whole days! Everyone just slept around the living room. We fed everyone and we only went out to buy more food and booze. Some of the gang were Leo Gomes, Jose Rey , Ronnie Ray , Larry Scharf from St, Louis, and many other blokes and lassies.\n\nThe party must have been a good send off as we just celebrated our 51st anniversary.\n\nBill Tillar\n\nI was stationed in South Ruislip and West Ruislip in 1962 to 1963 in the 7500 abg Air Police Section.\n\nThe jobs I had were in South Ruislip and west Ruislip along with duty at the Douglas House in London. I lived on base in the barracks that had no ceilings (! ROL). There were three airmen to a room with no doors, just a curtain for the door. I pulled duty many a day at the front entrance of the base and at the 3rd. Air Force headquarters building. We drove a pick-up to West Ruislip for duty postings there. Mostly at the front gate.\n\nUK police (bobbies) would man the gate at the hospital entrance. I was there for the large peace rallies and the base would close the gates and all of the air police were on duty carrying hidden side arms and posted on the rooftops and around the 3rd. Air force headquarters bldg (scary times the cold war). I donât remember to many of the personnel there but I did have a great time.\n\nWest Ruislip had the airmenâs club where I had many a good time. And a bowling alley was there also but it was mostly used as warehouse for supplies as it had many warehouses we had to check every day. There sure were a lot of, beautiful girls coming to the airmenâs club at night. I would have to sign them in while working the front desk. West Ruislip also is where the main lock-up or detention centre was, in side the air police building at the front of the entrance.\n\nNorbert Green\n\nMy family was stationed at S. Ruislip 1967-70 and I went to Bushy Hall Senior High (Watford). I used to go to the NCO club at RAF W. Ruislip and met many nice airmen to dance with. I also had an Italian girl friend from Milan, Italy that went with me. I also went to the Playboy Club and I remember every drink was $1.00 and great shows.\n\nMy girl friend, American, her father was the NCO Club Mgr at the Douglas House. I can't remember her name or his now.\n\nThe father would get good shows from the US and we used to play the slot machines. I remember one winter the Douglas House had Sly and the Family Stone booked and they never showed up. Probably got hooked on good English beer. Anyway, her father gave us all in the club free food and drinks for the day.\n\nI think in 1969 was when the NCO club (W. Ruislip) closed down and the military were then stationed at Lakenheath. I really missed going to that club. Sometimes I would take a t rain from Liverpool and go to Lakenheath. Stay at a bed and breakfast and go to the Lakenheath NCO club. I would do this on the weekends. After I graduated from High School I attended a British Business College in S. Kensington. I went to school with foreign students (well to do). I then worked for Alfred Marks Temp Agency as I could not get a work permit for permanent employment. I worked for the Lancaster Gate Hotel. We even had our Prom there and my girlfriend and I rented a Rolls Royce to take us and out dates to the Prom. Those were the days.\n\nI also worked for Oil companies, an American Bank in Governors Square, Restaurants and ITV (BBC) counterpart.\n\nI really hated to leave S. Ruislip in 1970. My father was assigned to Washington DC (Forestall Bldg). He was a CWO-4 Fred Brining. My name was Daphne Brining. I got married years ago but and no longer married. I just kept my married last name. If any body remembers me or my dad during the above years, please email me. If we never ran into each other, please let me know about your stays in England.\n\nDaphne J. Gilbertson\n\nI was stationed at RAF Bovingdon 1957-1960 with AACS (GCA) which was a tenant unit of the 7531st Air Base Squadron. My buddy, A/2C Howie Ryder was stationed at S. Ruislip and I spent many weekends there. It was great being so close to London. Howie was a member of the 603rd Communications Squadron. He met his wife Valerie there.\n\nThe Bovingdon Bunch Association held a reunion in Bovingdon 1998. After the reunion I traveled down to S Ruislip Air Station but where had it gone? In its place was a super market, a strip mall and an auto dealership.\n\nThe RAF Bovingdon Bunch Association will be having its twentieth annual reunion in Grand Rapids Michigan on September 15-19, 2005. Many pilots from S Ruislip flew the old \"gooney birds\" from Bovingdon airfield. There were a number of others from the 3rd AF HQ, Comm Sqd, etc that had contact with Bovingdon. The 7531 Air Base Squadron had Bovingdon air crews at Northolt. Let me know if any of you out there are interested in the Bovingdon Bunch reunion.\n\nIs there a reunion organization for those who served at S. Ruislip?\n\nKen Holt\n\nBob Holcomb and I, Ron Larochelle ,are visiting each other in Maine as we speak and discovered this South Ruislip website. We were stationed there from 1960-1963 with Mike Fedorchak, Sonny Chesnell, Joe Hager, Larry Church and Ed Hussey. Are any of you guys out there or does anyone remember Bob and I? We frequently reminisce about England and South Ruislip in particular and often wonder about the fate of the base or the guys we were stationed with. I was a ground radio operator and Bob was a teletype operator.\n\nWe would be interested to hear from guys like Joe Hager, Ed Hussey, Sonny Chesnell, Larry Church, DiMiara and Hebior. We were all there from 1960 to 1963 in the 603rd Comm Sq.\n\nRonald R Larochelle\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip in 66-68. I was assigned to the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) District Office # 12. My duties included conducting background investigations on English gals marrying American GI's My bosses were Lt Col James Poynor and Lt Col Isiah Sigman. Remember going to the Playboy Club frequently. Our Hq in Washington DC always wanted to know what was happening in London. The Play Boy Club was the place to find out what's happening. If I sent in 5 EEI's (Essential Elements of Information) a month, my bar tab was paid for by the Air Force.\n\nThis was my second tour in England, I was stationed at High Wycombe USAB from Mar 54 to Mar 59. I married an English girl from High Wycombe in 1957, My son was born at the South Ruislip Hospital. I got divorced and was in England in 2002, plan another trip there this year. Should be fun seeing the old neighborhood again. Jim Ringo, MSgt, USAF Retired\n\nJim Ringo\n\nIt brought back many memories of my time at South Ruislip (March 1966-May 1967). I met and married Betty which ended in divorce (my fault), and will always remember the great times we had there. I have never been back to England, but hope to return there some day. I was in the 1969Comm Sq, and use to frequent the Airman's Club. Sure would like to hear from my old\n\nfriend Jim \"Golden Boy\" Newsom. Joseph E Davenport\n\nI was assigned to West Ruislip in 1962 after Denham closed . I lived off base but used many of the facilities at South Ruislip. In January 1963 I bought a V.W. Bug to get around London. In February of 1964 I was at Heathrow Airport when the Beatles returned from their first trip to America. I was in the 3rd Air Postal Squadron and was assigned to meet that plane and pick up the U.S Mail Bags. I also knew people at South Ruislip who ran around with Christine Keeler during the \"Profumo Affair\" We had 30 U.S. Bases in the United Kingdom in that time frame and I was able to get to most of them. The movie (The War Mongers) was filmed at RAF Bovingdon in 1962 . Some of (Goldfinger) was filmed at RAF Northolt. I left the U.K for good in 1964 and hope to return someday.\n\nLarry Plummer USAF Veteran.\n\nI was at the hospital working in the Physiotherapy room with Sidney Frame, the UK Physiotherapist. I was there from March 1955 to March 1958, went back to the states for early release due to the armed forces cutbacks. Many of our old haunts now come to mind, Tithe Farm, the Douglas House, the Lyceum Ballroom downtown, the Lido, etc.\n\nI would like to make contact with my old buddies particularly Ira Don Snyder of OK, John Maples, Bill Bagwell, Terry Andres, Norman Hoeft, Darrell Moeller, Phillip Lane, etc.\n\nI am in contact with Jim Kniceley and Bob Chapman. Sam Mallett\n\nA view from a Brit who lived in Ruislip Manor and once got a chance to go into the base. I lived in Cornwall Road and as a child remember the house next door to us was rented out to US military personnel who were stationed at the SR base. I used to play with their kids and one family I remember in particular was the Pererias (SP?). They had a son called Kim who was about my age. We used to play together a lot and I remember the American sweets and food he had. Hershey bars and strange named cereals. One day he invited me to go and see a movie at the cinema on the base. I think it was, rather aptly, Rudyard Kiplingâs Kim. I donât remember much about the base or the cinema except that when we got popcorn he immediately smothered it with salt. I had only been used to sweet toffee popcorn so was horrified when he put salt all over it. Eventually his father got posted back to the states and we kept in touch for a while. Last I heard he was in Colarado Springs but that was 25 years ago or so.\n\nBrian Crowe\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip from 1963-65 and worked in Third Air Force Graphics with Lew Brown..\"the master\". Lew used to do Time \"man of the year\" covers for all the generals and other big-shots who left South Ruislip. My daughter Cindia, now 40, was born at the 7520th Hospital at the base, delivered by Dr. McNee, one of the \"Queen's Obstreticians\" .\n\nI loved that place so much then and all the \"blokes\" I met there.\n\nA1C Jim Boyle\n\nnow 63 and living in Eugene, Oregon\n\nI had two assignments to England; Feb 54 to Mar 59 at High Wycombe, Bucks, assigned to the Security Police Sq. My oldest son was born at South Ruislip Hospital in Aug 58. My second assignment was with the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) headquartered at South Ruislip in 1967 and 1968. My girlfriend and I plan a trip to England in October 05 and plan to stay at a Hotel in Ruislip while we see the sights in London by tube. Jim Ringo, MSgt, USAF Retired\n\nI, Louis Swiniuch, aka Louie, was stationed at South Ruislip from 1956 to 1958. I worked in Statistical Services, with guys by the name of Shipp, Smidt, Sheehan, Dawson, Miller, Charadonna etc. most of whom I forgot their names. The bosses name was Capt.Sorg, Msgt Ducey, Staff Sgt. Dorothea Johnson, Maj. Harvard,Ltc. Dyste and others. Had spent two best years of my life at that location. I remember the chow hall with the long mural. Wonder what they did with that? The chow was great. Haven't had anything like it since. Chefs did great job. One of the best part was living off base as I was an A/1c at the time. I lived in two places on Jubilee Drive. One of the couples name was Treacher. Don't recall the number. The other had a son by the name of Ken. Don't know why that sticks with me. Also lived at a time at Harrow-on-the-Hill near the tube. Took the 158 bus back and forth to the base most of the time There were three of us living there Swiniuch,Smidt and Sheehan. Parties were too numerous to mention. Girls too numerous to mention.\n\nWe had several jaunts to the Lido with cases of beer. Usually on a Saturday. Eastcote arms, Tithe farms were usual pit stops for us.\n\nBefore getting to Ruislip I had been stationed at RAF Sta. Molesworth. I real mud hole of a base. I was there a year. Being transferred to Ruislip was like dying and going to Heaven. I have nothing but positive memories of the place. Food, people etc. Haven't been back there since, although there is special place in my heart for it. Plus I can't recreate the people, demographics or culture of the base. One of my favorite jaunts was Soho district by tube from either Harrow or South Ruislip. That was my home away from home. I married a girl from London and the marriage ended up disastrous. I recall seeing a girl from Harrow who used to come to dances at the service club. First name was Geneen (probably spelled her name wrong). She came from the Isle of Jersey I believe, as she was French.\n\nMade many trips to the Douglas House. It was like an Oasis in the middle of England. There was a golf driving range at the back of the base beyond the railroad tracks. Bought set of golf clubs from the pro. Went bowling at the alley a few times Played golf at a small course in the area, name escape me. Teddy boys, Barrel boys, Fish and Chips, Pint of Bitter, Senior Service. If it wasn't American it was Bloke girls, cars, beer, cigarettes etc. Favorite word \"Rice\"\". Don't ask me why, I don't know. In the end I did not want to leave there. I was told I would have to go back to the states if I reenlisted, stay there a year, then maybe I could get back. Maybe was to vague of a word for me, so I didn't reenlist. Another thing was that I was up for promotion and told if I reenlisted I would get that next stripe. I told them If I got the next stripe first then I would reup. We had kind of a Mexican standoff. I didn't get the stripe, so I got out. I'm sure theirs more to write, but I'm getting tired now so I'll just cut if off.\n\nLouis Swiniuch\n\nI was at South Ruislip from Dec 1961 to Dec 1964. Bill Hoffard, Jim Bickerton and me all arrived together as 18 year olds and we worked in Medical Supply at Denham. Then Denham closed and we moved to West Ruislip.\n\nWe still had to do everything at S. Ruislip like eat and sign out our trucks. We were lucky enough to be allowed to live off base and we lived in a few different apartments at Harrow On The Hill. We hung out with Shirley Turner, Charlie Worman, Ken Sikora, Bob Bleicher and others and we always had a full table of gals & guys at the Douglas House almost every night.\n\nBill Sachs and I just had lunch in Northridge, California after connecting after 36 years. I particularly remember the \"Silver Dollar\" pizza restaurant owned by a nurse, Major Patterson. I can't remember the town but it wasn't far away. (maybe Pinner?)\n\nI located a few people from Ruislip through Classmates.com and we chat. As most have commented the same, the 3 years I spent at Ruislip were among the best of my life. Hoffard & Bickerton & Turner, if you're out there let me know.\n\nRich Silver ( aka Rick)\n\nRuislip was my first base after basic and the first time I was ever outside the country. This was in early '69, a few years before they closed the base. Of course I was completely naive and thought of England as the place where the Beatles and the Stones came from. I also learned to drink, gamble, play pool, ride a motorcycle as well as learn a great deal about people and the world.\n\nI worked in the comm center and, since the base was slowly closing, had a lot of time off. I also fell in love with a girl that worked at the NCO club, Kathy Ravensdale. Even today I wonder what ever happened to her. I also made friends with a great number of people but as time passed, lost contact with all of them. That's the reason for writing. Thought that it might be great to hear from one of two of them again.\n\nAfter leaving S.R. I was stationed at RAF Welford in Newbury, Berkshire and then Green Common, the other side of Newbury. During my time at S.R. I lived onbase, then in Slough and then Harrow on the Hill.\n\nAww, the memories. Chris Cooper\n\nI used to live in Eastcote (Ferncroft Avenue off Field End Road) from 1940 till about 1960. My mother used to baby-sit for a couple that rented accommodation in Pinner, that came from Texas. We were invited to quite a lot of socials at the USAF base and it was a real eye opener in those days - say about 1950 - 54 (I'm not too sure on the dates) because they had all the things we couldn't get after the war. One of my unforgettable memories was that at this couple's house in Pinner - they had\n\na massive fridge which was filled completely with cans of beer and when the guy came back from work at the camp - he would get a beer out of the fridge - drink it (without putting it in a glass! like you did in those days) and then just chuck the empty can in the fireplace. Absolutely unheard of my house.\n\nHowever, they were a very nice couple, very friendly and generous but the children were what we would call nowadays, vandals - as the stone statues in the garden were wrecked and broken by them Then, they just said they were high spirited!\n\nMy father who was also in the Air Force, based at Ruislip, used to say the \"yanks\" were sloppy because they were always chewing gum. However, I always found them to be polite and courteous. They also had their American cars over and would often stop and offer us girls lifts when waiting at the bus stops. We thought it was very glamorous going in an American car - not on our own of course - always in pairs my Mum said!\n\nI live in Folkestone now and haven't been back that way for years. I used to go to Ickenham High School for girls and when I left, went to Pitmans to \"get a career\" - i.e. shorthand/typing - little did know that computers would overtake all that.\n\nMy other memory of the area - among others - is the street party we had in Ferncroft Avenue at the end of the war and we had a stage and I had to get up and sing \"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling! in a white dress with all paper cigarettes on it - because there was a shortage and there was a cartoon at the time - called Chad - it was a man looking over a wall - saying \"Wot NO - in my case, cigarettes\" - now days with the anti smoking themes that would have been frowned upon.\n\nHeather Tyrrell\n\nHi folks, how about some information regarding the visit of Glenn Miller during the war. My sister (unfortunately no longer with us), always said she danced with Edward G. Robinson there?. Any evidence he did go there?\n\nJohn Russell (ex. Bury Street) now living in Fremantle W.Australia .\n\nYou might be interested in my website about a game of American football played by a team, The Rockets,\" then based at South Ruislip\n\nThis was in 1956 and the Rockets had won their fourth British Isles championships and was preparing to play a team from an USAF base in Weisbaden, Germany for the European USAF Football Championship.\n\nDana Andrews, then a famous but aging Hollywood actor, met me, the head coach at a party held by my Special Service office. Andrews wanted to promote the event and show the British just how exciting American football can be.\n\nThe RAF was attempting to raises funds to rebuild a historical church, Saint Clement Dane Church, which had been destroyed during World War II by the Nazi Blitz of Great Britain. About 40,000 British spectators, with a few USAF personnel in attendance, raised about $225,000 in American currency. The BBC- Television agreed to add what amounted to about a million dollars in American currency. to help rebuild Saint Clement.\n\nSince the USAF helped fund rebuilding of the 2,000-year-old church, the 16,000 Army Air Corps personnel who lost their lives during World War II while serving in England, RAF agreed to share Saint Clements as a WWII memorial for the American loses, whose names are on a scroll attached to the pipe organ, the gate receipt was used to purchase.\n\nJim Martin\n\nHello to All: John Schmidt, a/k/a Smitty the Cop, here. I was stationed at South Ruislip from 11/66 to 12/69 and would like to reestablish contact with folks I met and had such good times with during the Carnaby Street era in London. I married a Central High School graduate (Ann Smith) and we now live in Virginia Beach where I practice law.\n\nSo, what ever happened to Jim Shearer, \"Tag\" Tagliaferro, Myra Hardin, \"Dewey\" Drouillard, Jenny Lutheran, Marty Best and June, Dan Aggers, Stan Mitchell, Tom Triplett, \"Chick\" Freeman, Capt. Tom Booth, Sam Ditusa, and the countless others who kept the party going at 14 Meadow Close long after the Airmans Club on West Ruislip closed for the evening? E-mail me at jschmidt@wilsav.com if you're a believer that Ruislip memories are priceless.\n\nRegards, Smitty\n\nHi, my name Is Ken McLean (AKA) Mac. I was stationed at South Ruislip from July 1966 to February 1968. I was in the 1969th Comm. Squadron. I'm looking for all my old friends. It would be great to have a reunion. I'm so happy to see this site and to read that so many others had such a wonderful time at South Ruislip as I did. I remember going downtown to Paddington to Count Suckles Cue Club with all my friends and afterwards going to Wimpys for a burger. There were other clubs, like the Bag O' Nails.\n\nI remember many of the guys like Big Lou, Tagliferro and Ebo, all were A.P.s I recently looked up my closest friends in the white pages on the computer. I found Eli Thomas who is doing well in Indiana. I tried to find Floss Mathis, who played for our basketball team, the London Rockets, unfortunately, his mother said that he died two years ago. I would love to contact Al Holloway, Lenny Wordlaw, Tony Williams, Speelman Phillips, Henry Brown (the Cook) who made the best SOS in the Air Force, Ray Gallagher, who followed me to Peshawar Air Station in Pakistan. He worked on the antennas with his best friend, I think his last name was Grace. What ever happened to Schofield, the guy who used to walk on the walls that divided the rooms, singing Tennessee Stud?\n\nIf any body is out there, or who remembers any of these guys, please write me at the following address:\n\nKenneth McLean\n\n62 Lincoln Ave.\n\nCliffside Park, N.J. 07010 Ken McLean (AKA) Mac\n\nI married a young man from Shepherds Grove AFB 57 years ago, we now live in NJ. We keep up with the SGAFB people and the web site. My cousin married a man who was stationed at Ruislip AFB. His name is Kenneth (Ken) Betch. My cousinâs name was Jocelyn (nee Ling). Jocelyn was very ill, the last time we corresponded, in the late 60âs, she was in the hospital. She is the only daughter of my fatherâs only other sibling. They had a son Wayne Collin Betch who would be about 48 now. I would very much like to find Ken and family. They are the only remaining members of that side of our family. I would appreciate any information or even any memories anyone might have and would like to share with us.\n\nThank you, Larry and Janet (Ling) Wood.\n\n(This would appear to be from a person who was stationed at West Ruislip)\n\nMy name is Ted Clark and my first duty station was RAF Shellingford, in Oxfordshire, with the 7568 Material Squadron; arriving June 1956. Our mission was to provide Radar Maintenance for the 32nd Brigade, who had air defense duty for the USAF SAC bases. RAF Shellingford was closed as an USAF installation in early 1957, with the men moving to Denham Studios, ie 7500 Air Base Group, as we opened 4MU as West Ruislip AB in early 1957. At this time, there was only about 120 USAF members on site. In the beginning, West Ruislip was a heavy maintenance facility for the repair of dump trucks, etc. Later, it would be come the site for AFEX warehouse. With the removal of the 32nd Brigade, most of the Radar Technicians & Comm. Technicians were transferred to other duty stations. I depart West Ruislip AB in June 1957 for Wheelus AB, Libya. A small group of men who were stationed at Shellingford/West Ruislip recently held a reunion in Atlantic City, NJ, and to a man, we all agreed that our time in England was the best of all our duty stations later on. I would enjoy communicating with anyone who is familar with either RAF Shellingford or 4MU/West Ruislip AB. Contact me\n\nMy dad was stationed at South Ruislip in the auditor's office from 1960-63. we went to Eastcote and west ruislip schools. we used to go to the NCO club at South Ruislip on Sundays for the buffet. They would have special shows (magicians) for the kids. We also used to go to the special picnics the bases would put on at Denham down by the lake where the movie Call me Bwana was made with Bob Hope. They spared no expense then.\n\nWe went to the AYA on weekends at West Ruislip while my parents went to the clubs. We bought our kerosene with ration cards at West Ruislip.\n\nDid anybody else discover that American pennies worked in the chocolate milk machine (instead of 6 pence) outside the Express Dairy shop on the road leading to S. Ruislip? We used to go to the snack bar at Denham and South Ruislip.\n\nWe went to the club at Denham, it was never crowded and my brother used to play the slot machines.\n\nWhat a wonderful time. I'm 55 now and some of my memories are a little sketchy. When we were leaving we stayed at the Harcourt House Hotel near South Ruislip and Douglas House.\n\nWhen I went back for a visit South. Ruislip. had been turned over to the English for something and I couldn't go on so I just stood and looked past what used to be the main gate to the main drag that went to the NCO club, snack bar and beverage shop across from snack bar. there are too many wonderful memories to share.\n\nAngela Crocker\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip from April 67 until Dec 69. I worked in flight scheduling in the headquarters building. I lived in base for a few months until I found a bed sitter with a great family. The barracks were more of a warehouse with heaters that seemed more like used jet engines and low partitions that offered little privacy.\n\nI loved my time in England, played soccer for the Rockets, went to Uxbridge technical college at night and lived high on the hog especially since the pound devalued twice while I was there. I wonder what happened to the 1938 Morris 8 that I used to drive.\n\nIâd enjoy hearing from anybody that was there thenâ¦â¦\n\nThom Corcoran\n\nI can't believe that I've found this site! I was stationed there from 1966 to 1969 at the Weather Central. (First building on the right end of centre corridor.) Lt Col Dodge commanding. Best duty of my life! A few months in the barracks and then out on the economy. Those incredible cost of living allowances! NCO club with incredible entertainment - Brook Benton comes to mind. How about those 10 Cent drinks! Except for Scotch which was at market price.. We'd get off a mid shift, go have breakfast and then go and open up the bar and stay untill the night and close it, with all sorts dropping by for a few hours. What good times...\n\nI miss all the guys, Jack Mekemson, Marty Best and Don Bowker (Comm) Don Douglas, Bill Richardson, Mac Macdonald, Vic Minella, Mike Spivey, Eric Linsay, Dr Hylton, the list goes on. We had six weddings in our detachment in one year - two on the same day.\n\nDoes anyone remember those two gorgeous WAF twins? Attached to the Generals office.\n\nI remember the pizza place operated by a retired US nurse major - often closed! The firing range at Uxbridge, Airman's club at West Ruislip. God, it all comes back! Best time of my life, then I married a lovely Brit. She picked me up in a pub in Leicester Sq. \"The Round Table\", anybody remember it? I'll talk with anybody about this all.\n\nFrank Berger Det 6, 28th Weather Sq Before clicking on any e-mail link read this section\n\nI worked at South Ruislip AFB between 1951-53. I was hired by the Air Ministry and I worked for Colonel Jones of 7th Air Division in the Stat div., as a clerk typist. I worked with a couple of Len's, a Collins, Mason, and Dowdy to name a few.\n\nMy father, Syd Banks and brother Doug Banks worked in the kitchen/Mess hall. They are both deceased.\n\nI met my husband, Elmer C Sluss, at the Tithe Farm on New Year's eve 1954. We married in August of that year at the Harrow Registry office. 52 years ago now. He was assigned to the 3rd Postal Sq at South Ruislip. He worked with, Proops (our best man), Pitts, Kerns, Dixon, etc.\n\nOur first home was on Roxeth Avenue, a bed-sit, with a shared bathroom down the hall. Our first child was born in the hospital on base. Needless to say we moved from Roxeth back to Dorchester Road, Northolt Park at that time to live with my parents.\n\nThose years hold wonderful memories of youth and new beginnings. I just wish I could still put names with faces. I remember the faces. We now live in Virginia. If you remember Cliff or me, please write, we'd really like to hear from you.\n\nJoan Banks Sluss\n\nI don't know if there is anyone out there who can help. I am searching for a Richard Allen Mcquistion. He was based at the USAF in South Ruislip, I believe up until about 1960ish. I'm not too sure. He was ground force but don't know which stripe. He came from America I believe it was Michigan. He was about 22 when he was there. I think. I don't really no that much about him. He dated a Jeanette Hughes who visited the base, her sister Gloria worked on the base in the cafeteria. He was friends with a David? who dated a girl called Cissy and they had 2 children together.\n\nI am desperately trying to find him or information about him as he must be about 67-69 now, and he has a son, daughter-in-law, granddaughter and great granddaughter whom he has never met.\n\nI am his grand daughter and am determined to find him, for my dad.\n\nI would be ever so grateful if there is anyone out there who has any information about him, what he was like etc, etc.....Please e-mail me from the link below.\n\nNicola\n\nI grew up just down the rd from the Air base and later my Secondary school was built opposite the base Where Currys Electronics store etc now stand. Queensmead School is where the bus stop was, where we would wait for the GI's to go to their rented homes away from home in Harrow etc. We would say cheekily to The American's. \"Got any gum chum\" As our parents thought this was scrounging, we could not go home chewing our ill gotten gum.\n\nAs pre teen kids we would take Our \"Guy Fawkes\" effigy to the bus stop to catch the GI's going home. \"Penny for the Guy\" We'd ask/beg (depending how a person looked at the tradition) for money. The week leading up to Nov 5th. We would tell the GI's, the effigy would be burnt on a bonfire we'd build. Then we would give a brief history of Guy Fawkes and the attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Our sister in a sack, dressed up as Guy Fawkes, being pushed about in a child's push chair, decided to stand up. The American lady who had been listening intently, yelled and jumped backwards. My poor sister being uncomfortable had to stand up to stretch out her long legs and had no idea she would frighten the lady so much. Janice was around 7 yrs old. I think Janice jumped with just as much fright, when the woman yelled out.\n\nSomewhere around the back area of the old site where the base stood, there is a rd leading to the local council waste/recycle dump. I went there with my dad in 2,000 to dump stuff he was clearing out from his stables. I know that there was a Baseball pitch somewhere back there through the tunnel, under the central train line that went to and from London. Steam trains used to travel that route also. As kids we would squash pennies on the line as the train passed over them. We would Bird nest also in that area (look not touch) we would have to run every so often when the Air police saw us back there.\n\nThe base had open days and as kids we were fascinated by the sodas and foods served. One open day was held at the Pavilion, as well as the base being opened to the public. The Pavilion was in Deane park playing fields. On Long drive. This was a farm field once.\n\nMy parents knew several couples that were based at Sth Ruislip in the 50's. Gene and Anita Fowler. Gene was a pilot. Also I remember the names of another couple, A Gene and Dotty. Others that I just can't recall. Training dogs and building Model Aircraft to fly were some of the interests between Gene fowler and my dad.\n\nI remember as very small child, an American friend of my dad's, who would arrive in a jeep. I remember the flight jacket he wore the odd head gear, the leather helmet. When they left for the states, my sister and myself were given a super metal doll house that had lights, a pool room and adjoining garage it was amazing to us at ages 6 and 4 ys old.\n\nEdward Brown My husband of 37 yrs worked with Computers on base along with Jimmy Temple Robbie Robinson, John Kline, Jack De Witt and many others.\n\nEd and myself, Robbie and his wife Christine, would go to a car dump along from the base main gates, where the guys were able to find parts for their American cars. I remember sitting in a very much picked over, old American car, minus wheels and Christine and myself taking daft pictures of each other. We traveled to Ball games, at different bases from time to time.\n\nWe went to London to see Georgie Flame and the Blue flames at a night club. We were allowed in and had paid, grabbed decent seating and then we were told the club was off limits to GI's, we had to leave in a hurry. No refund on our entrance fee! Better than the Military police catching the fellers.\n\nMy husband's brother boxed on base and at London Pubs and clubs, in his days stationed at South Ruislip. His name was Otis Brown. Otis while at a local pub, Maybe the 'Eastcote Arms.' Or a big Pub at Rayner's Lane on the Victoria rd, after a few beers he'd jump to the table top and preach a sermon of the \"Evils of beer.\" He boxed under his nick name \"Rocky.\" Later in his life Otis became the Commissary officer up at Chicksands. He also bar b q'd for the American Embassy in London, for charities etc. Sadly both Edward my husband, and his brother Otis Brown have passed on.\n\nGeraldine Brown\n\nMy childhood friend Valerie Traynor, married a man stationed at Ruislip Air Force Base around 1958. He was from Florida. She had two sons, Danny the oldest would have been about 2 years old, Jessie, about 1 years old. The man she married was not the father of her children. She lived on Bolton Road in Harrow. She had a sister named June, who also married an American, and June moved to Wisconsin around 1959.\n\nI have been looking for Valerie for over 40 years.\n\nI married Jon Kjelstad, who was stationed at Ruislip, and Burtonwood, We would like to hear from any old friends, as well as Valerie, or anyone that knows of her. April (Butler) Kjelstad.\n\nI had three of the most enjoyable years while stationed at South Ruislip from Aug 1967 to July 1970, left the Air Force following that as a SSgt.\n\nMy oldest son was born at the base hospital there and therefore the real estate of the old base will always be special to me and my former wife, Arliene. We lived in Iver Heath, Ruislip, Harrow and finally 27 The Croft in South Ruislip (behind St. Gregoryâs I think.)\n\nI worked for TSgt Lake (a made guy in the Mafia with contacts with the London mob, unbelievable Top Secret Crypto clearance) and with SSgt Lee Johnson although my first boss was MSgt Beatle Bailey.\n\nMy best friends were Bennie Killion from Texas and Michael Murray (from Arizona) both of whom I have lost contact. I was a central office technician assigned to the 1969th Comm Squadron and was responsible for the COPAN system and supporting the installation of the AUTOVON network at Hillington.\n\nSo many memories from Bangers in Queensbury to the theatre for great shows in the West End, mini-shirted local girls to wagged out demonstrators outside our gates. I used to enjoy placing bets on horse races at the little bookie shop just next to the South Ruislip station (TSgt Lakes mob connections got me a few great tips). Remember the ration cards for cigarettes, liquor and gasoline.\n\nI have had the opportunity to return to London many times since then. Until the early 80âs it was used as storage for art owned by the government and the 7520th Hospital building was part of a screen set for some TV program I was told. It is now all been torn down and there is a strip mall with a DIY as I recall. Visited 27 The Croft a few times and it is still there but nicely re-modelled and updated.\n\nA. John Miller II\n\nCan anyone tell me what happened to HARRY LANE, who i think was entertainment officer during the 60's?\n\nBill Before\n\nIâm William B. Poucher (Bill Poucher). My father, MSGT Lester Boyce Poucher, was stationed at South Ruislip USAFB in 1955-1956. We lived off base at âThe Retreat, 1 Raynorâs Laneâ. I was in the first grade. My sister and I were enrolled in an English school called Harrow on the Hill, or something like that. I think that dad as Sergeant Major of the 3rd Air Force at the time, or something like that. He was born in 1903 and had 28 years of service in when he was permanently disabled while stationed there. We were never sure what dad did. He never talked about the Air Force at home. The previous assignment was in some special AF or DoD program that his friends called the Russian School at Syracuse University. Prior to that, Dad was at Maxwell AFB at the Air War College. He alternated working for the Inspector General or in Air Force Intelligence.\n\nIâm just curious if any of you were there during the Hungarian Spring. Did you know dad? I remember London, the terrible smogs, Father Christmas (a cheapskate compared to Santa Claus), the Queen, singing God Save the Queen before watching a movie (we sang My Country Tis of Thee to the ire of the English). I remember the beautiful greenery of spring, getting caned at school, getting lost on the playground in a fog, developing an accent, wearing shorts in the winter with long wool stockings and some kind of rubber boot. I remember putting a sixpence in a slot machine at the NCO club and winning the jackpot. It caused a stir, since I slipped back where they were. It was against regulation for a child to do so. I remember calculating conversions of currency for my mother when we shopped (a gift reproducible today with a $5 calculator). I remember queuing up at stores. Only one customer could go in at a time at most stores. I suspect that I was a brat.\n\nAnyway, after Dad was disabled and we were flown to Washingtonâs Walter Reed Hospital and in the ensuing years, a number of his friends came to visit. They would talk a lot of politics but never about that era.\n\nIâve tried to get details of his assignments during the Cold War, but his records were sequestered in Fort Leavenworth. Shortly before the Freedom of Information Act, they were burned up in a big fire. Dad suffered injuries to his feet and back. He had a stroke. He lived another 11 years. But, he either didnât remember much about his service then or simply wouldnât talk about it.\n\nMy mom is 87 and is very ill. She has shared some things about his career, but it has been pretty sparse. In particular, he had a lot of ribbons and such, but I donât know where the paperwork is that explains what they are for. How do you get a Purple Heart without a scrap of paper to explain what happened?\n\nDid any of you know him?\n\nWilliam B. Poucher (Bill Poucher)\n\nAs a former South Ruislip Air Base member (67-68) I visited England in October and had the pleasure of being a guest of the Royal Navy In Portsmouth for the Trafalgar Day celebration while in my Mess Dress USAF uniform. We were thrilled to have been presented to Queen Elizabeth at the Navy Yard Museum dinner. We are still considering whether to wash our hands after having shook the hand of the Queen. We sat at the Head Table between Rear Admiral Wilkinson and Lord Wedgewood. MSgt Ringo, USAF Retired\n\nBefore clicking on any e-mail link read this section\n\nMy husband Ken has a sister Shirley who married a Joe Capelli who was stationed at the USAF Base at South Ruislip in the 1940s. They had 2 children and have moved to the USA. We are trying to trace them and wonder if anyone does remember this family and could email me about them\n\nJudith Haire\n\nWas stationed at South Ruislip from May 1956 until Dec 1956. I was assigned to the \"Instrument Trainer\" section (Flight Simulator). Our duty was to instruct the pilots from South Ruislip and neighbouring bases such as Bovingdon, etc. each month on Instrument Flight Procedures. The first day I arrived there I met Airman Kennedy from Louisiana , who had the bunk below me in basic training. He was married at South Ruislip a few months after I arrived there.\n\nAs I recall the Headquarters 3rd Air Force was located next a Kodak plant. While there I also served on the Honour Guard, so I had my Chrome helmet, white gloves etc. always available in case a High Ranking visitor came to the base. Looking at the pictures on you web site, they bring back memories. The one I remember was the day Secretary of the Air Force Quarles visited the base. I lived in Northwood and took the bus to the base each morning for sixpence. I rented an apartment from the Barnes family. As I recall he was a school teacher. They had two sons and I used to get Welch's grape juice from the base and they would watch Roy Rogers on the TV with my wife in the afternoon after school and they loved grape juice. I was then assigned to a Manson RAF station in Dec 1956 during the \"Suez\" crisis. I returned to London 8 years ago and visited Northwood. The home where I had an apartment had been town down and row houses built. The only thing that had not changed was the Police station and the local Pub!\n\nJames R Tucker\n\nI was station at Denham Studios May 1959, worked in The Traffic Management Household Goods section. About eight months later I went to South Ruislip to the Passenger section. In July of 1960 I adopted my son Paul. His Mother was English and dad American who worked at the Embassy in London. We were adopting our second son but he died . My wife's , mother and step father was assigned to the Comm Sqdn next door to the NCO club. We lived in South Ruislip and I drove back and forth to the base. I can still member our phone # after all these years. Ruislip 8797. I left Ruislip in Feb of 1963, went to Turner AFB GA, for year and a half, Wurtsmith AFB MI for 3 years, Korat Thailand, Travis AFB CA., and retired in May l971. We still have two English friends alive in England and one in Canada. I have not seen any of the guys I worked with at Denham or South Ruislip only one from Third AF Traffic and met Co; Bill Bannins, at Travis AFB and he worked at the MAC command post also Sgt James Frank, who hand four boys. Jim is in Kissimmee FL and last I heard Col Bill, went to Scott AFB Hqds Mac. The guys in my field, were Dan Beaton, Lowell Grace,my NCOIC was a guy named Mac? and Dale Whitchity from Hqds. He came to Travis after a tour in Nam.\n\nI had three tours over seas in 20 years, the first one in Korea 1952 with the Fifth Transport Sqdn , AVN, named the Mule Train 3 1/2 in England and one year in Thailand. One thing great the Air Force history section, has no record of the Mule Train in Korea and the Hqds was not at Young don po. But I went in and out of there many days and slept nights and in Feb of 1953 spent about three weeks there. Right out side of Seoul no Air Force was in Young don Po, per the History section.\n\nDale Hanen Betty Hanen Ruislip England May 1959 to Feb 1963\n\nMy name is Jack Williams, MSGT USAF Ret. During the period 1968 thru 1972 I was stationed at Ruislip, I worked in the NCMO department of UK COMM REGION HQ. We were the management office for all USAF NAVAIDs and Communications within the UK.\n\nMy wife Joyce and I had two children (Dena and Lee). We lived on Paxford Rd in Wembley and later at Carpenders Park before being reassigned to RAF Mildenhall for our final year in England. We returned to the States in 1973.\n\nThere were many people whom I worked with at the time and would love to hear from anyone stationed there at that time. Some of the men I worked with were: Charles Brooks, Dale Vincent, Bob Derman, \"Smitty\" John Smithwick, James Henley, James Berry, Jack Wood, Hugh Cooper, CMSGT Dixon, Capt Frank Provenzano, Capt Roher, James Perdue, Ron Lund, Mike Staffier, and American friends and neighbours: Frank and Carol Sheehan, Dave and Jane Fouser.Jack Williams\n\nI was a Medical Technician assigned to the USAF Hospital at South Ruislip from August 1966 until December 1969. I started working in the Intensive Care/Pediatrics Ward, and later worked in the Surgical Ward and then the Emergency Room for my last year and a half there. I lived on base at first, but finally got enough seniority to move off base. I lived in Watford for awhile, then had a flat in Chelsea and finally lived near Harrow-on-the-Hill.\n\nLast year I managed to locate Bob Scro, my former roommate in London (who also was with me in Basic Training and Tech School). He lives in New Jersey, while I am in Texas.\n\nI wanted to stay there when I got my discharge, but that âCatch 22â deal they had for getting a job kept me from staying. You had to have a job to get a Green Card, and you had to have a Green Card to get a job.\n\nIâd like to go back there and visit someday. Some of the best memories in my life come from those four years.\n\nBobby Summers\n\nMy name is Nile W. York. I was stationed at So. Ruislip From November 1952 to November 1955. I was in the 1969thAACS Squadron. I worked in the communications centre on the main street. We had some really great guys in our unit. Its hard to remember their names, Bill, Whitey, Sam. Haven't heard from any of them. Lived on base until my wife came over the next year. We then lived at Harrow, South Harrow and lastly at Northholt.\n\nOur son was born at the base hospital. I remember the bus stopped down the about a half a block. The guys would go out on payday, come back about half full, and not wanting to walk from the bus stop would stand on the back platform and step off at the base entrance. Some became pretty skilful at it, some lost some clothing and skin that were less skilful. O, yes, when we first got their the barracks were not ready. They based us at Bushey Park and bussed us back and forth. When we got fogged in, we might be at the base for a day or two. I believe that winter of 1952 was the year of great killer fogs.\n\nThere was no central heating, each room had a fireplace and coal was used in them. It would get so bad that when you were outside for awhile and blew your nose your handkerchief would be black. Anyone from that period that would like contact me can reach me at\n\n7904 N. Woodland\n\nKansas City, Mo. 64118\n\nHi. My name is Ray Ong and I was stationed at South Ruislip from 1967 to 1969. I was in the 1969 Communications Squadron in Ground Radio. Had many fond memories with Russ Groat, Louis Lukach, Walter Wrobel, Bill Haynes, Gerald Martin, Mel Strunk and many others. I also had a room in a house on Victoria Road near Ruislip Manor with the Coleman's. I am looking forward to make a trip back to the area.\n\nRay (Jim) Ong\n\nI was an English girl who visited the base as a child, going back nearly forty years ago my sister married a guy who was based there and their first child was born there I believe, it was great fun my sister would buy me toys from there which hadn't been launched in England I remember being the first kid in school to have 'Kerplunk' When my sister left to go and live in America, me and my Mum saw her off from Ruislip, it was always very exciting to visit the camp, the men all looked like movie stars in their USAF uniforms.\n\nMy sister's American husband was Claude Ivan Owen, anybody remember him?\n\nSandra\n\nI was stationed at Denham Air Station with the 7500th Air Base Group in Stat. Services, '58, '59, and '60. Many times for various reasons I took the shuttle bus from Denham to South Ruislip, and I had many friends who lived off-base in the area. The Airmans' Mess Hall at So. Ruislip was especially attractive and I do recall a large mural that may have been painted during WWII. The BX at Ruislip was also bigger and better, and the Airmans' Service Club was super. I would like to hear from anyone who would like to share memories of that time at both Ruislip and of Denham Studios (Air Station). Looking forward...\n\nPaul David Eaves\n\nHi, I would be interested to hear from anyone who might know of the whereabouts of Jess and Ritha Radcliffe, (or Ratcliffe) they had a daughter Vanessa. They were from Hurley Virginia, USA and would have been assigned to the Ruislip Air Base around 1961-1963. I have an old envelope with the following address on it:\n\nPOBox5 Hurley VA 2460 USA FR226-38-0175483DCAMFPSC#1089APOSF96326.\n\nThey would have had a mother's help called Pamela Spiers. Other people who would have known them possibly would have been Maree Cunningham, George Thorhauer, Master Sergent, Air Police. My mother was Pamela Spiers and I would like to get in contact with any of the above people.\n\nSue\n\nMy name is Jesse Jefferson, often referred too as \"Jeff Jefferson.\" I was googling for the \"UK Eagle\" 3rd AF newspaper when to my surprise I ran across the South Ruislip site! It was a pleasure to read the stories provided by the participated. I was in the USAFSS detached to South Ruislip and while there I played for the London Rockets basketball team. We were coached, 1956, by Major John Doukas. We were a very good team but our nemesis was the Chicksands Chicks. Later on I was transferred to Chicksands AFB and played for them. I played with Edgar Allan Poe, Major Anderson (that was his name), Jim Brown and Madison Pope to name a few. Someone wrote earlier about the movie star, Dana Andrews. I remember him sitting near us, at a Rockets football game, a championship game against one of the teams from Germany and Mr. Andrews had had to much of that English Ale (smile), I remember Ava Gardner and Robert Mitchum coming to our BX, They were doing a movie at Denham AFB.\n\nI loved South Ruislip and I loved riding the \"Tube\" to London. When I was transferred to Chicksands I could have cried. Again, thanks to all of you for allowing me reminisce.\n\nJesse Jefferson\n\nAfter two unending months at Burtonwood in 1951, I was transferred to SAC into the 485th Communications Squadron, living at Bushy Park and working at South Ruislip, in early January 1952.\n\nUntil the old Bomber Headquarters reopened at High Wycombe, we worked in the 3rd Air Force Relay Center on the same side of the street as the Hospital. When High Wycombe opened, a SAC trib station was set up across the street in the SAC Building. The office was across the hall from the Flight Surgeon's office and General LeMay's cigars used to stink up the area when he was on base. Knowing that HW was opening, I took a place in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire for my new bride who was due in on The Queen Elizabeth in March 1952. You might guess that I was retained to work at South Ruislip! Found commuting not bad, loved the Bucks area, and even moved on up to Terriers, on the hill above the train station in High Wycombe for a couple of years.\n\nI was almost a plank owner, that is if I had been in the Navy, as South Ruislip was relatively new when I was there. I won't comment on the facility as it is adequately covered above even though I found only one airman's entry which overlapped my time there. Still it was a great place with parking at the end of the street through an underpass. The newsstand stood just to the left of the entryway. The area became familiar, of course, and eventually we moved to South Ruislip for a few months before shipping out in November 1954.\n\nAm looking for a SGT GARRETT, tall black man, excellent NCO, great basketball player, also stationed in the same SAC trib and one of the finest men I ever knew. Unfortunately all my papers were lost with his information and he always signed all personal things \"Garry\" so I don't have his first name or MI. His wife was, I believe, Betty or Betsy, from Virginia and made the best apple pies this side of mama's kitchen. I have spent a great deal of time looking for him so if you have even a slender lead, please let me know. Thanks.\n\nHarris Johnson Greensboro NC 27406\n\nMy name is Bill Lycan, I served two tours at South Ruislip. The first was from early Nov. 1950 to Oct. 1953, and again from May 1955 to May 1958. I met my wife in the spring of 1951 when she and a friend were walking their dogs between South Ruislip and Ruislip. Her maiden name was Audrey Martin and she lived on Durley Ave. in Pinner. We were married in Harrow Aug. 9th, 1952. Our second son was born at the base hospital June the 7th, 1955 at the beginning of my 2nd tour. As a point of interest the mural in the mess was completed in 1950 (though it was added to and changed a little later) in time for Thanksgiving dinner which was attended by the Commanding General of 3rd Air Division (would not be Air Force until sometime in 1951) and local dignitaries, including the Mayor of London. I had arrived just in time to be a \"hat check\" boy for the occasion! I have just found this site and it sure does bring back many fond memories. I would be happy to communicate with anyone who served at Ruislip in the 50's, or who had family that did.\n\nBill Lycan\n\nI was stationed at RAF South Ruislip, 3rd AF HQ, 1965 - 68. My initial assignment was to 3rd AF Command Post and I then spent a year in 3rd AF Ops Plans. My final assignment there was to the 3rd AF VIP Flight, flying a VT-29 out of RAF Northholt. A delightful assignment. The photo I have sent (in the Gallery) is of 3rd AF Command Post staff members and was taken in 1965 at the South Ruislip Officers' Club .\n\nCol Robert R. Arnau, USAF (Ret)\n\nI served at South Ruislip from 1964-66 as a crypto operator in the communications centre. Since this was at the height of the \"Cold War\" it was quite interesting, and just coming off the Cuban Missile Crises, and the Kennedy assassination added to the mystique of the time. My wife and I lived on Long Lane, Ickenham, and made many friends, mostly young married's like us during our stay. Since our first home was sold, we moved half way through our stay to Field End Road, Eastcote. We have a reunion every year in Albuquerque at the Balloon Fest with our \"Air Force\" buddies, and relive the past, and try to keep alive what we had in England.\n\nMy wife and I have been back to JOLLY OLE ENGLAND a few times, and once visited our first home with our grown children. It is now time to think about taking our grandchildren over the pond and see our old digs.\n\nWhile stationed in South Ruislip I helped with our Little Leaguers by umpiring baseball games. We bought at the commissary, and I remember the huge shopping bags they used to pack our groceries in. Steak was a $1 a pound, and hamburger was .25c a pound, cigarettes were $1.40 a CARTON, vodka was $1.40 or so, and beer was next to nothing. The second year there, the BX got some BBQ's in and Dave Thompson and I were the first to buy one. Our English neighbours were shocked to see us cooking outdoors, and of course they became regulars to our weekend BBQ's. The commissary didn't supply any kind of Mexican food, and coming from Southern California we had satisfy our need of south of the border cooking by making things from scratch. Whenever my wife and I had a Mexican Feast, all of our friends showed up, even the single guys that lived on base.\n\nOne last tid bit. You may recall our NCO Club on base was second to none. Many of the stateside acts would perform there first to get some of the bugs worked out before they would go on stage downtown London. We had some real first rate entertainment at that Club. The American Express was where everyone banked, and they had air trips to Amsterdam, Paris or Munich for only $50, which included a hotel stay. Lastly, it took awhile accepting some bloke calling my wife dearie, sweetie or love.\n\nDick Benbow\n\nI was stationed at South Ruislip in the 1969th AACS Communications Squadron from October 1956 to October 1959.\n\nThe comm facility was actually a major relay station in the US Air Force and had circuitry into air bases in Africa, France, Germany, Holland and other, some classified, locations. We were the Air Force's primary gateway communications facility between the United States and Europe. Our call sign was JDL and we pushed a lot of traffic 24 hours a day, every day. I was the NCOIC Comm Operations and worked for Major Raymond Schultz, a very fine officer.\n\nI lived at #4 Leaver Gardens, Greenford, Middlesex, with my wife, Beverly, son Brian and daughter Cynthia.
