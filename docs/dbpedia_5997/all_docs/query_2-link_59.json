        "text": "This series consists of approximately 7,700 files containing biographical details of RAAF personnel who served during the 1939-45 War. The files are arranged in alphabetical order and mainly relate to RAAF officers and non-commissioned officers who passed through No 3 PRC and No 11 PDRC. They are predominantly of RAAF aircrew serving outside the South West Pacific Area. Some files for ground crew are included. Files are also included for Australians serving in the RAF, SAAF, RANVR, RAFVR and RCAF (see list of abbreviations).\n\nThe files were compiled for use at the RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. Their purpose was to collect historical information on Australians serving in the RAAF, RAF and RAFVR who achieved distinction from their operational exploits or distinguished service career (AWM93 item 211/2/2) and they were to be used by the RAAF Historical Records Section. Most of the files contain biographical proforma's issued by RAAF Overseas Headquarters through No 3 PRC and No 11 PDRC. The majority of these forms appear to have been issued and compiled between 1943 and 1945. This date range corresponds with the 1943 appointment of an officer to undertake historical records duties at Overseas Headquarters suggesting these forms may be the result of an active campaign to obtain accurate details of service from RAAF personnel to supplement the previously unsatisfactory record keeping.\n\nAfter the war the files were retained by the Department of Air in Melbourne. The series was transferred to the Australian War Memorial on 21 January 1963 together with a packing list of the files (AWM93 item 211/2/2, letter of 25 January 1963). The covering letter lists a number of files retained by the Department of Air Historical Sub-section at the time of transfer:\n\nGroup Captain C R Caldwell\n\nAir Commodore A H Cobby\n\nFlight Lieutenant A P Goldsmith\n\nGroup Captain A B McFarlane\n\nWing Commander W J McLean\n\nFlying Officer R H Middleton VC\n\nFlight Lieutenant W E Newton VC\n\nSquadron Leader A A N D Pentland\n\nSquadron Leader K W Truscott and\n\nGroup Captain J L Waddy.\n\nThese files are still retained by the RAAF Historical Section. The composition of each file varies according to the completeness of the information entered on the various forms. Some files contain very detailed information on the forms and various attachments relating to the individual\"s service career. Other files contain incomplete forms and no attachments. In general the files contain the following information:\n\n(a) A biographical proforma of personal details completed by the subject upon arrival in the United Kingdom recording name, number, rank, degrees, decorations, present appointment and location, previous service experience, places of training, civilian career and activities, family, address, date embarked and destination.\n\n(b) An end of operational tour proforma completed by the subject recording name, number, rank, ITS (Initial Training School) course, date left Australia, date of arrival in United Kingdom, OTU (Operational Training Unit) -AFU (Advanced Flying Unit) etc, present unit, previous units and details of operations. By 1945 this form also included details of squadrons, aircraft flown, command and type of activity and operations or training with American personnel, squadrons or aircraft.\n\n(c) A copy of decoration citations for awards.\n\nAlso included as attachments are press releases and newspaper cuttings, debriefs, transcripts of interviews and any form of publicity relating to the member such as Air Ministry or RAAF bulletins, scripts of BBC \"Calling Australia\" broadcasts and newspaper reports of death in action, operational exploits, sporting activities, marriages etc. There are also some RAAF Directorate of Public Relations bulletins released in Australia.\n\nAt the time of transfer the Department of Air issued instructions that the files should retain a grading of \"restricted\" (AWM93 item 211/2/2, letter of 25 January 1963). The series was access examined in 1984 and all the items are open."
