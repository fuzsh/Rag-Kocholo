The airplane was operated by Bear Lake Air, Inc., Seward, Alaska. The pilot and five passengers were not injured. The flight departed Bear Lake, in Seward, en route to the accident lake. The pilot reported that during the flight from Bear Lake, strong winds and turbulence were encountered. He added that after landing at the accident lake he taxied to shore, loaded his passengers, and briefed the passengers of the anticipated turbulence. He added that he taxied the airplane to the farthest point on the lake that would allow the maximum amount of takeoff run. He said that just after takeoff, about 150 feet above the water, a very strong gust of wind pushed the nose of the airplane to the left. He applied full right rudder in an attempt to regain control, but the nose of the airplane continued to the left, and the left wing stalled. The pilot said: \"The airplane just stopped flying, and we just fell from about 100 feet.\" As the airplane's floats struck the surface of the lake, the left side of the fuselage buckled, and the left wing struck the water. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, and minor damage to the left wing. Repaired; Thomas Gayer [Ingrams Air], Coopers Landing, Alaska, January 27, 2004; in service by April 2006; Michael Renfro, Bethel, Alaska July 24, 2008. On July 11, 2009 the aircraft sustained substantial damage following a loss of engine power and an emergency landing about 300 feet short of the runway at the Akiachak Airport, Akiachak, Alaska. The airplane was being operated by Renfro's Alaska Adventures, Bethel, Alaska. The pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The aircraft was flying from Bethel to Tuluksak, Alaska, when the engine started to run rough. The pilot diverted to Akiachak which was near his position. The pilot said the engine quit completely, and he was unable to reach the runway. The airplane collided with terrain about 300 feet short of the runway. The engine had been rebuilt about 100 flight hours prior to the accident, after developing problems following a previous rebuild. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage during the accident. An internal examination of the engine by the NTSB showed that a locking screw had backed out of one of the two anti-vibration counterweights on the crankshaft and scored the interior back surface of the engine case.

This was one of 15 aircraft purchased by SOMACO for Israel. Five others were purchased from other sources. Of these 20 aircraft, 17 eventually reached Israel; one crashed in Rome and two mistakenly landed in Gaza and were captured by the Egyptian army. 70285 (MSN 550) Delivered to USAAF July 5, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 5, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 35th Depot Repair Squadron, Abbots Ripton, Cambridgeshire. Disappeared over the English Channel on December 15, 1944 while en route from Bedford, England to Paris, France. Band leader A. Glenn Miller was lost along with the pilot John Morgan and Lt. Colonel Baessell. The pilot departed Abbots Ripton at about noon on the 15th with orders to pick up his passengers at Twinwood Farm, a satellite to RAF Cranfield, located three miles north of the centre of Bedford. After picking up Lt. Colonel Baessell and Major Miller, it departed for Villacoublay, France in marginal conditions, with Bordeaux being the aircraft's ultimate destination; Villacoublay was located some ten miles southwest of the centre of Paris. The aircraft was never heard from again. No trace of the aircraft or its occupants has ever been found. Speculation about the demise of Glenn Miller has included the theory that he was captured and tortured to death by the Nazis. The USAAF blamed the accident on mechanical failure caused by pilot error and bad weather. One theory is that the plane was lost by straying into a forbidden zone in mid-channel which was designated for the jettisoning of surplus ordnance. On its east bound channel leg the Norseman flew directly under 139 RAF Lancasters flying in the opposite direction. The Lancasters were returning from a scrubbed mission in France and were ordered to dump their bombs in the water. Two airmen, both now deceased, witnessed the accident. The Lancaster's navigator had never witnessed a bomb drop on any of his missions and changed positions to see one. He said \"I had never seen a bombing before, so I crawled from my navigators seat and put my head in the observation blister. I saw a small high wing mono-plane, a Noorduyn Norseman, underneath. I told the rear gunner there's a kite down there. There's a kite gone in! and he said he saw it too.\" But this theory has been disputed. 70286 (MSN 551) Delivered to USAAF July 5, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 6, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 27, 1944; 434th Fighter Squadron, 479th Fighter Group, Wattisham, Suffolk; damaged when ground looped at Wattisham July 30, 1945; To Foreign Liquidation Commission; Oberpfaffenhofen, Bavaria, Germany April 30, 1947. 70287 (MSN 552) Delivered to USAAF July 5, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 5, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 9th Air Force, Europe; accident May 29, 1946; salvaged June 24, 1946. 70288 (MSN 553) Delivered to USAAF July 5, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 6, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 27, 1944; Headquarters, 2nd Combat Bomb Wing, Hethel, Norfolk; Damaged landing at Dieppe, France December 28, 1944; salvaged December, 1944; to Royal Air Force for spares recovery. 70289 (MSN 554) Delivered to USAAF July 5, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 6, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 68th Bomb Squadron, 44th Bomb Group, Shipdham, Norfolk; landing accident Shipdham October 13, 1944; Air Force Europe; 1st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 10th Photo Reconnaissance Group, Furth [R-28], Germany; Crashed after taking off 1 miles N of Mayres, France March 24, 1946; Accident June 7, 1946; salvaged July 17, 1946. 70290 (MSN 555) Delivered to USAAF July 7, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 7, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 20th Fighter Group, Kingscliffe, Northants; 111th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 10th Photo Reconnaissance Group, Furth [R-28], Germany; Damaged when ground looped at Furth October 10, 1945; salvaged December 29. 1945. 70291 (MSN 556) Delivered to USAAF July 7, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 9, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 93rd Bomb Group, Hardwick, Norfolk; damaged when ground looped at Hardwick January 7, 1945; 361st Fighter Group, Little Walden, Essex; damaged when ground looped at Little Walden July 9, 1945; accident on May 29, 1946; salvaged June 24, 1946. 70292 (MSN 557) Delivered to USAAF July 7, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 9, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England August 19, 1944; 9th Air Force, Europe; salvaged. 70293 (MSN 558) Delivered to USAAF July 7, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 7, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; 9th Air Force, Europe; Air Force Europe; 1st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 10th Photo Reconnaissance Group, Furth [R-28], Germany; Damaged in collision at Tarascon, France March 22, 1946. 70294 (MSN 559) Delivered to USAAF July 7, 1944; Newark, New Jersey July 7, 1944; shipped to the 8th Air Force, England July 14, 1944; US Military Defense Aid diversion to Sweden April 18, 1946; AB Ahrenbergsflyg, Stockholm, Sweden; registered SE-ATB February 28, 1946; Leased to Industridiesel and subleased to Aeroskandia, Stockholm August 29, 1946; Damaged at Uddevalla, carburettor fire caused damage to cabling and metering systems July 15, 1948; AB Arosflyg, Stockholm July, 1948; Försäkringsbolaget Liverpool & London & Globe, Stockholm [insurance company] December 8, 1948; Intention of using parts for the repair of SE-ASL [43-35397], but further evaluation revealed that the majority of parts were sourced from SE-ATB and the hybrid was subsequently referred to as SE-ATB; Repaired by 21 Wing, Luleå February 1949; test flown June 1, 1949; AB Trafik Turist Transportflyg, Ostersund, Stockholm June 22, 1949; Damaged at Furuvik July 7, 1950, left float cracked and loosened at fastening joint; Royal Swedish Air Force / Flygvapnet November 19, 1951; type Tp78, serial 78003; 4 Wing Frösön, Östersund; Destroyed by fire September, 1956. 70295 (MSN 560) Delivered to USAAF July 12, 1944; Bainbridge, Georgia July 17, 1944; To RFC November 3, 1945; J.P.
