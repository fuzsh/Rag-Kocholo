        "text": "On the morning of 11 September 2001, terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda perpetrated the most devastating attack on the United States since the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in December 1941. Nineteen terrorists, most of who were of Saudi Arabian origin, seized control of four commercial airliners not long after takeoff from airports on the East Coast. Two airliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City. A third, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed in an open field in southwestern Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to subdue the hijackers and retake control of the plane. These unprecedented attacks claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people and injured some 7,000 more, and were immediately recognized as acts of war both by the administration of President George W. Bush and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).1 The attacks also catapulted the U.S. military into a protracted “global war on terrorism” that encompassed offensive and counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq for more than a decade.2\n\n_________\n\n1 For a detailed narrative of events on the morning of 11 September 2001, see National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, The 9/11 Commission Report (Boston: W.W. Norton & Company, 2004), 278–323. See also Stephen Holmes, “Al-Qaeda, September 11, 2001,” in Diego Gambetta, ed., Making Sense of Suicide Missions, updated ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 131–172.\n\n2 On terminological debates surrounding the “Global War on Terror,” see Barry Scott Zellen, The Art of War in an Asymmetric World: Strategy for the Post–Cold War Era (London: Continuum International Publishing, 2012), 282–283; Jan Goldman, ed., The War on Terror Encyclopedia: From the Rise of Al-Qaeda to 9/11 and Beyond (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2014), 154.\n\n1\n\nThe U.S. Navy played a critical role in the immediate military response to the 9/11 attacks, codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which formally began on 7 October 2001 and unfolded primarily in the Central Command (CENTCOM) theater of operations. Over the course of several months, American and Coalition military operations inside Afghanistan devastated the Taliban regime and seriously undermined Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network, which had used the land-locked country as a training ground and safe haven since 1996.3 Naval power was central to the operational successes of OEF, particularly during the intense opening phases of the military campaign. By December 2001, most campaign goals had been achieved and combat operations shifted to a mountainous section of eastern Afghanistan called Tora Bora, where isolated al-Qaeda and Taliban forces had fled. Several months later, U.S. forces launched Operation Anaconda against residual al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in eastern Afghanistan, the largest pitched battle of the war.4 Hundreds of al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives escaped into Pakistan and bin Laden was not captured or killed, yet al-Qaeda’s infrastructure in Afghanistan was destroyed and the Taliban regime was brought down just 102 days after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe initial phases of OEF necessitated an enormous commitment in terms of total naval forces in theater. During the operation’s first six months, the Navy committed to the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT)/Fifth Fleet area of responsibility a total of six aircraft carrier battle groups (CVBGs), four amphibious ready groups (ARGs), extensive additional support ships, and around 60,000 active-duty Sailors and Marines as well as some 13,000\n\n__________\n\n3 Helpful assessments of particular aspects of OEF include Nathan S. Lowrey, U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, 2001–2002: From the Sea (Washington, DC: United States Marine Corps History Division, 2011); Donald P. Wright, A Different Kind of War: The United States Army in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), October 2001–September 2005 (Fort Leavenworth: Combat Studies Institute Press, 2010); Seth G. Jones, In the Graveyard of Empires: America’s War in Afghanistan (New York: Norton, 2009).\n\n4 See especially Sean Naylor, Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda (New York: Berkley Books, 2005).\n\n2\n\nreservists. In terms of ships alone, this constituted a surge of over three times the number of naval vessels typically assigned to NAVCENT/Fifth Fleet. Coalition navies—the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy in particular—also participated extensively in OEF, providing further warfighting capabilities and support functions.\n\nThis essay briefly examines key aspects of the Navy’s contribution to the opening phases of OEF: naval strike warfare; combined operations of amphibious ready groups and Marine expeditionary units; and maritime interception operations. Naval strike warfare dominated and shaped the U.S. Central Command–directed joint air campaign, as carrier-based strike fighters and ship-launched cruise missiles pummeled Taliban airfields, air defense positions, and command and control nodes as well as al-Qaeda training bases. Amphibious ready groups and their embarked Marine expeditionary units (MEUs) surged additional naval power and executed an array of expeditionary missions, including the longest-range amphibious assault in U.S. naval history. U.S. and Coalition naval forces also carried out wide-ranging maritime interception operations in an effort to defeat international terrorist organizations, deter state and non-state actors from supporting terrorism, and inhibit other illegal maritime activities. Owing to its absolute control of the sea during OEF, the Navy projected immense power ashore and demonstrated its agility and adaptability as a vital instrument of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nNaval Strike Warfare\n\nAttacks against al-Qaeda and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime required a deep-strike capability in one of the most remote parts of southwest Asia where U.S. military forces initially had no access to forward land bases. Because Afghanistan was landlocked and positioned nearly 400 miles from the nearest sea at its southernmost border, carrier-based strike aircraft and ship-launched cruise missiles played a foremost role in the campaign. This was the first time that the U.S.\n\n3\n\nmilitary prosecuted a war from aircraft carriers, TLAM–armed vessels, and land bases positioned so far away from the combat zone. While Air Force heavy bombers delivered a large amount of the munitions used to attack al-Qaeda and Taliban forces, fighter aircraft from the Navy’s carriers flew over 70 percent of all strike missions between the formal start of OEF on 7 October 2001 and the end of December, by which time the Taliban regime had effectively collapsed.5 The OEF air campaign was also the most precise naval bombing effort to that date, owing to the nearly exclusive use of precision-guided munitions by Navy strike fighters. Naval strike warfare therefore dominated and shaped the CENTCOM-directed joint air campaign, which achieved significant results in a relatively short time span.\n\nTo maximize expeditionary air power during OEF’s critical opening phases, the Navy surged numerous aircraft carriers to the North Arabian Sea. Each aircraft carrier deployed with its embarked carrier air wing, comprised of several squadrons and detachments of both rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft, the latter comprised mainly of F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet fighters.6 Although Enterprise (CVN-65) and Carl Vinson (CVN-70) were the only carriers on station when strike operations began on 7 October, Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) arrived on 15 October. John C. Stennis (CVN-74) arrived several weeks later, in preparation for relieving Enterprise, which had already been deployed for nearly seven months. Kitty Hawk (CV-63), an older, conventional large-deck carrier, deployed from her home port of Yokosuka, Japan, without her full air wing complement in order to serve as an afloat forward staging base for joint special\n\n__________\n\n5 Benjamin S.

Some air missions lasted as long as ten hours, testing the endurance of the men and women in the cockpit.9 Each air wing flew an average of 30–40 combat sorties per day.10 Because air missions were of extraordinarily long duration and most carrier-based strike aircraft were shorter-range F/A-18s, naval aircrews relied heavily on inflight refueling support from Air Force and Royal Air Force (RAF) tankers based out of Kuwait, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.11 Aircraft carriers on station in the North Arabian Sea performed flight operations for approximately 14–16 hours per day, with two carriers typically implementing a day-night rotation.12 Navy and Marine Corps strike fighters were supported by Navy EA-6B\n\n__________\n\n7 David Brown, “The Element of Flexibility,” Navy Times, 15 October 2001.\n\n8 According to Benjamin S. Lambeth, carrier-launched air missions during OEF came to average a distance of 600 nautical miles from their stations around 100–120 nautical miles south of the Pakistani coast to central Afghanistan and another 150–200 nautical miles to northern Afghanistan (Lambeth, American Carrier Air Power, 20).\n\n9 Lisa Troshinsky, “Navy Pilots Set Flying and Target Records in Afghanistan,” Navy News & Undersea Technology 19, no. 4 (22 January 2002): 1.\n\n10 Lambeth, American Carrier Air Power, 27.\n\n11 British TriStar and VC-10 tankers provided approximately 20 percent of all inflight refueling support throughout OEF. As many as 12 allied tankers were airborne at any moment to support strike operations.\n\n12 In the first two-carrier iteration, Carl Vinson (CVN-70) served as the day carrier while Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) served as the night carrier. When Vinson departed the CENTCOM AOR after being relieved by John C. Stennis (CVN-74), Theodore Roosevelt became the day carrier while Stennis assumed duties as the night carrier.\n\n5\n\nProwlers, which jammed enemy radar and communications transmissions, and Navy P-3 Orions, which functioned effectively as tactical intelligence platforms.13\n\nNavy surface combatants and submarines armed with TLAMs conducted many of the initial strikes against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, particularly during the first several days of combat operations. McFaul (DDG-74), John Paul Jones (DDG-53), O’Brien (DD-975), Philippine Sea (CG-58), and Providence (SSN-719), together with British submarines HMS Triumph and HMS Trafalgar, launched a barrage of some 50 TLAMs against fixed targets inside Afghanistan on the evening of 7 October.14 McFaul and John Paul Jones launched around 15 Tomahawks against high-priority targets the next day, and Providence fired three additional TLAMs against “emerging targets of opportunity” within Afghanistan on 10 October.15 Heavy use of cruise missiles at the outset of OEF underscored the value of long-range, precision-strike capabilities, which had improved in preceding years through the addition of GPS guidance, enhanced reliability, reduced time for targeting, and increased operational range.\n\nCarrier-based F-14s and F/A-18s demonstrated the markedly improved capability that naval strike aviation had developed since Operation Desert Storm (1991), making substantial use of sizeable inventories of GPS- and laser-guided weapons. Approximately 93 percent of the weapons dropped by participating carrier air wings were precision-guided.16 The precision\n\n__________\n\n13 C.

Forward air controllers, many of whom were SOF and paramilitary personnel clandestinely inserted into Afghanistan shortly after the onset of hostilities, laser-designated strike fighters’ munitions onto their projected targets after aircrews had released them on geographic coordinates.18 According to some assessments, 84 percent of precision weapons launched by Navy strike fighters hit their designated aim points, though at least five incidents of collateral damage to civilians and residential areas in Kabul and Herat occurred in the first three weeks of OEF.19\n\nThe focus of naval strike missions shifted several times over the course of OEF’s initial phases. During the first 10 days of OEF, strike aircraft attacked mainly pre-briefed fixed targets such as airfields, air defense sites, bunkers, command and control nodes, military barracks, and training camps in or near key cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and Mazar-i-Sharif.20 Strikes then shifted to emerging targets of opportunity within selected engagement zones, such as al-Qaeda leaders and Taliban vehicles and troops on the move against allied Northern Alliance\n\n_________\n\n17 Steve Vogel, “They Said No. This is Our Answer,” Washington Post, 8 October 2001; Eric Umansky, “Studs and Duds,” Washington Monthly (December 2001): 15–21.\n\n18 Richard L.

Air attacks had decreased considerably by the middle of January 2002 but intensified again during Operation Anaconda, a major U.S.-led ground offensive against remaining al-Qaeda fighters in eastern Afghanistan’s Shah-i-Kot Valley from 2–18 March.22 After Anaconda, the successful conclusion of which signaled the winding down of OEF’s opening phases, sporadic sorties were flown as policing actions in support of the new Afghan provisional government.\n\nThe Navy projected tremendous force ashore during OEF strike operations using naval aviation and cruise missile attacks. Its strikes were continuously employed for tactical and operational effect, thereby shaping the battlespace on the ground inside Afghanistan. Exploiting sea control as well as complete air supremacy, U.S. naval forces executed deep-strike missions that destroyed or seriously degraded al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The success of naval strike operations facilitated the consolidation of Hamid Karzai’s provisional government in late 2001 as well as the deployment of provincial reconstruction teams throughout Afghanistan in 2002. These highly networked operations capitalized on naval, joint, and Coalition combat assets, applying lethality and versatility across the full range of strike warfare.\n\n__________\n\n21 Rowan Scarborough, “U.S. Splits Afghanistan into ‘Engagement Zones’,” Washington Times, 18 October 2001.\n\n22 On Operation Anaconda, see especially Naylor, Not a Good Day to Die; Lambeth, Air Power Against Terror, 178–231.\n\n8\n\nAmphibious Ready Group–Marine Expeditionary Unit Operations\n\nThe combined operations of amphibious ready groups and Marine expeditionary units constituted a second important component of naval action during the initial phases of OEF. The many ARGs deployed to the North Arabian Sea, together with their embarked MEUs, provided CENTCOM and NAVCENT commanders with flexible sea-based expeditionary forces capable of performing a vast range of missions on extremely short notice. ARGs centered on Peleliu (LHA-5), Bataan (LHD-5), and Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6), in conjunction with the 15th, 26th, and 13th MEUs respectively, executed amphibious operations, crisis response and limited contingency operations, and supported special operations forces. They also participated in multinational training exercises designed to enhance regional stability and cooperation between the United States and several of its allies. Arguably the most significant collective ARG-MEU operation of the first months of OEF involved Task Force 58, a naval expeditionary task force, directed by Vice Admiral Charles W. Moore to carry out an amphibious raid aimed at disrupting Taliban command and control in southern Afghanistan. Elements of Task Force 58, formed from Amphibious Squadrons 1 and 8 and the 15th and 26th MEU (SOC s), conducted the longest-range assault from the sea in U.S. naval history on 25 November 2001. ARG-MEU operations in OEF underscored the enduring close relationship between the Navy and Marine Corps, and demonstrated the adaptability of amphibious operations in a wide array of circumstances both inside and outside the theater of combat operations.\n\nIn addition to the Enterprise and Carl Vinson strike groups, the Peleliu ARG was among the first naval forces to arrive in the CENTCOM and NAVCENT area of responsibility during the run-up to OEF. Each ARG consisted of an amphibious assault ship (LHA or LHD), an amphibious transport dock ship (LPD), and a dock landing ship (LSD). They also each carried a Marine expeditionary unit, special operations capable (MEU [SOC]), built around a battalion\n\n9\n\nlanding team of infantry, an AV-8B Harrier detachment, a helicopter squadron, and a combat service support element. Having deployed from their home ports prior to the 9/11 attacks, the Peleliu ARG carried the 15th MEU (SOC) while the Bataan ARG—which did not enter NAVCENT/Fifth Fleet area of operations until mid-November—carried the 26th MEU (SOC). Shortly after OEF commenced, NAVCENT leaders began shaping plans for amphibious raids into Afghanistan to accelerate the defeat of Taliban and al-Qaeda forces.\n\nThe decision to conduct amphibious raids concurrent with intensive strike operations stemmed from the apparent need to prevent Taliban forces fleeing their northern strongholds and from reinforcing their remaining positions in the southern part of Afghanistan. Aiming to deny the Taliban a chance to strengthen their defenses, Vice Admiral Moore, the NAVCENT commander, opted in late October to combine the Peleliu and Bataan ARGs into a single amphibious task force under the command of Marine Brigadier General James N. Mattis. While the strategic objectives of Task Force (TF) 58 remained somewhat indefinite in late October and early November, Brigadier General Mattis organized a small staff comprised of selected Navy and Marine Corps personnel from multiple commands to plan and execute the initial amphibious offensive into Afghanistan.23\n\nTF-58 executed the longest-range assault from the sea in U.S. naval history on 25 November 2001, maneuvering some 400 nautical miles directly from the ships of the Peleliu ARG to seize a remote desert airstrip in southern Afghanistan that became known as Forward Operating Base (FOB) Rhino.24 The task force met no resistance during the initial insertion. This was due in part to the efforts of a Navy SEAL (Sea-Air-Land) detachment that had been inserted\n\n__________\n\n23 Lowrey, U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, 79–87.\n\n24 Ibid., 111–120; Steven L. Myers and James Dao, “The Marines’ 21st Century Beachhead is Far Inland,” New York Times, 22 December 2001.\n\n10\n\nthere several days before to provide surveillance and special reconnaissance over the objective. The build-up of forces at FOB Rhino was completed by 3 December. TF-58’s ship-to-shore maneuver was directly out of the joint Navy-Marine Corps concept of “expeditionary maneuver warfare,” which entailed rapid and deep movements directly from the sea to objectives inland. The establishment of this semi-permanent FOB marked the start of approximately two months of Marine combat operations in Afghanistan, first in and around Rhino and afterward at Kandahar Airfield, which light armored elements of TF-58 occupied on 14 December during follow-on operations from Kandahar to Kabul. 25\n\nTF-58’s build-up of combat forces at Kandahar Airfield and the initiation of concurrent and distributed actions there involved Marines and Sailors in another key aspect of OEF: detention operations. Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 133 were some of the first Navy personnel deployed to FOB Rhino and the airfield at Kandahar, performing round-the-clock runway repair and fortifying the Marines’ fighting positions on the perimeters of both sites.26 The Seabees constructed a short-term holding facility at Kandahar Airfield to house Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees, the first 24 of which arrived on 18 December. A steady influx of detainees to the airfield quickly enlarged the holding facility population to more than 350 persons by 9 January 2002. Although most of the detainees at the Kandahar facility were low-level Taliban fighters, TF-58 sent a number of al-Qaeda terrorists and suspected Taliban leaders out to Navy ships for safekeeping. Eight high-value detainees were confined on board Peleliu, and were later transferred to Bataan.

Marines deployed an element of a battalion landing team from the Peleliu ARG in the second week of October to provide security for Air Force combat search and rescue personnel operating from Shahbaz Airbase in Jacobabad, Pakistan. They remained ashore for 43 days before soldiers from the Army’s 101st Airborne Division relieved them.28 A tactical recovery force launched from the Peleliu ARG to Panjgur, Pakistan, in late October and retrieved a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter abandoned by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, which it then flew out to Kitty Hawk.29 The Peleliu ARG also steamed into the Persian Gulf in early November, remaining on station off the coast of Qatar with Marines standing by to evacuate U.S. citizens should terrorists strike the World Trade Organization conference then occurring in Doha.30\n\nARGs and their embarked MEUs simultaneously took part in multinational military exercises intended to augment regional stability and cooperation between the United States and its allies and partners.

Following Edged Mallet’s conclusion, the Bonhomme Richard ARG steamed north to the Persian Gulf and took part in Exercise Eastern Maverick in Qatar and Exercise Sea Soldier in Oman.33\n\nThe combined operations of ARGs and MEUs throughout the initial phases of Operation Enduring Freedom underscored the value of naval expeditionary forces, whose power projection capability, self-sufficiency, adaptability, and responsiveness gave CENTCOM and NAVCENT leaders a number of tactical options in the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The operations of TF-58 in particular validated the effectiveness of long-range, ship-to-objective maneuver, which until then was something rather new and essentially untried. Amphibious forces persistently surged additional naval power in and around the Arabian Sea, while performing security, crisis response, humanitarian relief, and limited contingency operations.\n\nMaritime Interception Operations\n\nA third key aspect of the Navy’s contribution to OEF centered on maritime interception operations (MIO) in the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf. These operations\n\n__________\n\n32 Ibid., 78.\n\n33 Ibid., 267–268.\n\n13\n\nrepresented, at least in part, a continuance of U.S. naval activities that was conducted in the NAVCENT region since August 1990, when the UN Security Council formally condemned the invasion of Kuwait and imposed international sanctions on Iraq.34 Yet they also constituted something new: a comprehensive attempt to prevent the seaborne escape of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda leaders from southern Pakistan, disrupt or defeat other international terrorist groups, and deter states and non-state actors from supporting terrorism. CENTCOM and NAVCENT leaders strongly suspected that bin Laden and his top aides would flee from Afghanistan into Pakistan, and from there to nearby countries using small vessels such as dhows.35 For this reason, maritime interception operations in late 2001 and early 2002 were heavily focused on leadership interdiction. These operations, executed principally by Navy surface combatants and those from Coalition partners including Great Britain, France, Canada, and Australia, further demonstrated the capability of multinational naval forces to cooperate productively in spite of lingering interoperability issues.36\n\nRecognition of the need for a robust MIO component to Operation Enduring Freedom surfaced well before the military response to 9/11 formally commenced. NAVCENT commander Vice Admiral Moore established Task Force 50 in late September 2001 to provide the necessary command structure for the various carrier battle groups operating in the Arabian Sea, appointing Rear Admiral Thomas E. Zelibor, embarked in Carl Vinson, as its commanding officer. While TF-50’s primary mission was to conduct air operations into Afghanistan, its secondary tasks\n\n__________\n\n34 On the adoption of UN Security Council Resolutions 661 and 665 and their impact on U.S. naval patrol and interceptions operations during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, see Marolda and Schneller, Shield and Sword, 54–55, 86–87; Pokrant, Desert Shield at Sea, 29–37.

An incident that occurred in November 2001 underscores the perilous nature of such actions. The destroyer Peterson (DD-969) intercepted and diverted M/V Samra to a holding anchorage in the northern Persian Gulf on 18 November, after noticing the vessel sitting low in the water and listing. An eight-member boarding party from Peterson discovered some 1,700 metric tons of black-market Iraqi oil, but as it was concluding its inspection the weather deteriorated and Samra was overcome by heavy seas. Samra quickly sank, drowning security team members Engineman 1st Class Vincent Parker and Electronics Technician 3rd Class Benjamin Johnson.38 Four smugglers also drowned. An MH-60R from Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light (HSL) 44 Detachment 4, embarked on board Peterson, an SH-60B Seahawk from HSL-42 Detachment 2 from cruiser Leyte Gulf (CG-55), two rigid-hull inflatable boats from Leyte Gulf, and frigates Ingraham (FFG-61) and Australian Sydney (FFG 03) managed to rescue six Sailors and ten smugglers.\n\nU.S. naval forces increasingly focused on leadership interdiction as Coalition airstrikes and ground operations eroded the Taliban’s control of key Afghan cities such as Kabul, Herat,\n\n__________\n\n37 This discussion of TF-50 is drawn from Jeffrey G. Barlow, “The U.S. Navy’s Role in Coalition Maritime Interception in Operation Enduring Freedom, 2001–2002,” in Gary E. Weir and Sandra J. Doyle, eds., You Cannot Surge Trust: Combined Naval Operations of the Royal Australian Navy, Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, and United States Navy, 1991–2003 (Washington, DC: Naval History and Heritage Command, 2013), 167–188.\n\n38“Oil Ship Sinks, U.S. Sailors Missing in Persian Gulf,” CNN, 18 November 2001, http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/11/18/iraq.oil.ship/index.html.\n\n15\n\nMazar-i-Sharif, and Kandahar. Assessing the effect that these successes could have on al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership, Rear Admiral Thomas E. Zelibor implemented an operational plan during the final week of November 2001 that made maximum use of U.S. and Coalition naval forces to close off sea and air escape routes from southern Pakistan. Referred to alternately as “leadership interdiction operations” or “leadership interception operations” (both of which were abbreviated as LIO), these actions involved querying, stopping, visiting, boarding, and searching vessels suspected of moving terrorists, particularly terrorist leaders.39 Ships carrying Pakistani migrants seeking work in the United Arab Emirates and Oman were of special concern for the Navy and its Coalition partners owing to their potential for transporting terrorists. LIO patrols commenced in the Gulf of Oman on 23 November and in the North Arabian Sea six days later. Princeton (CG-59) and aircraft from Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) accomplished some of the first LIO missions near Gwadar, off the southwestern coast of Pakistan.40\n\nDespite their obvious similarities, separate rules of engagement distinguished LIO from MIO. LIO rules of engagement allowed Coalition warships to query and board non-flagged vessels they reasonably suspected of transporting terrorists. Rules of engagement for U.S. ship commanders, authorized by NAVCENT, permitted the use of disabling fire to halt suspicious vessels and to search or seize non-government vessels based on actionable intelligence.41 Allied analysts alerted NAVCENT leadership to particular ships they suspected of smuggling terrorists and illegal weapons via al-Qaeda infiltration routes.\n\nSailors and aviators carrying out interception operations executed both compliant and non-compliant boardings of suspect ships. The first instance of a non-compliant boarding\n\n__________\n\n39Schneller, “Operation Enduring Freedom,” 199–200.\n\n40Mark L. Evans and Roy A.

The Seahawks intercepted the ship and flew armed observation and cover as they guided two boatloads of SEALs deployed from Shreveport (LPD-12), which boarded and stopped the vessel and mustered her 22 crewmembers. Shreveport quickly deployed 71 additional Marines, explosive ordnance disposal sailors, and SEALs for security and search. The raid force detained Kota Sejarah for two days, although inspectors could not locate suspected al-Qaeda fighters or weapons.42\n\nConventional naval forces conducting MIO during Operation Enduring Freedom frequently collaborated with special operations forces, particularly when intelligence officers and staffers had reason to believe that certain vessels were carrying al-Qaeda leaders. Shreveport (LPD-12) deployed SEAL Team 8 as well as Special Boat Unit 20 during a nighttime boarding of M/V El Obeid in the North Arabian Sea on 13 January 2002. Two HH-60H Seahawk helicopters from Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (HS) 11 and HS-8 on board Shreveport provided both sniper and AGM-114B Hellfire missile coverage for the special operators, who boarded, seized, and inspected the vessel. Maritime interdiction personnel from Elliot (DD-967) reinforced the boarding party.43\n\nAs interception operations intensified and the number of Coalition ships committed to OEF increased, NAVCENT formally established a multinational task force in February 2002. Focused solely on interdicting terrorists and their resources at sea, Combined Task Force (CTF) 150’s area of responsibility encompassed the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Horn of Africa, and\n\n__________\n\n42 TF 58 Command Chronology, Part 3, p. 91; Lowrey, U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, 145.\n\n43 TF 58 Command Chronology, 102; Lowrey, U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, 390; William T.

This expansive area covered more than 2.4 million square miles of coastline bordering 12 countries. Initially commanded by a U.S. naval officer, Rear Admiral Christopher C. Ames embarked in Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), CTF-150 operated subsequently under the command of Coalition flag officers. Coalition partners such as France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain contributed leadership, ships, and aircraft to the task force.44\n\nU.S. and allied naval forces conducting MIO within the NAVCENT/Fifth Fleet area of responsibility maintained pressure on terrorist networks and countered illicit movement of weapons, people, and other materials. By March 2002, more than 7,244 queries were made and 47 ships boarded.45 Several months later, these operations were redesignated “expanded maritime interception operations” when President George W. Bush authorized European Command (EUCOM) as well as CENTCOM to interdict terrorists and their material resources at sea.46 Although some complications arose at times from divergent rules of engagement as well as national limitations on the specific types of missions naval vessels could perform at the operational level, multinational naval forces worked together effectively to advance the shared priorities of the nascent Global War on Terrorism.\n\n__________\n\n44 Schneller, “Operation Enduring Freedom,” 201; Schneller, Anchor of Resolve, 100; Greg Nash and David Stevens, Australia’s Navy in the Gulf: From Countenance to Catalyst, 1941–2006 (Silverwater: Topmill, 2006), 50–52.\n\n45 Schneller, “Operation Enduring Freedom,” 200.\n\n46 Schneller, Anchor of Resolve, 101.\n\n18\n\nConclusion\n\nThe intense opening phases of OEF, in which U.S. and Coalition forces achieved the collapse of the Taliban regime and drove al-Qaeda from its established base of operations in Afghanistan, included an important naval and maritime component. The U.S. Navy contributed decisively to the downfall of the Taliban and the devastation of al-Qaeda, projecting immense combat power beyond the littoral regions and demonstrating remarkable operational flexibility. The men and women of the Navy confirmed the ability of 21st-century U.S. naval forces to rapidly deploy, organize for combat, and perform an array of missions across the warfare continuum in support of national priorities.\n\nOperation Enduring Freedom validated, in at least some appraisals, the Navy’s post–Cold War focus on precision strike and network-centric operations, as well as the necessity of aircraft carriers in a way not seen in many decades.47 The capabilities of aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups provided a level of access and on-demand reach that did not require host-nation support. The Navy’s amphibious capabilities enabled the rapid deployment of forces directly from the sea to objectives deep inland, showing that amphibious flexibility is one of the chief strategic assets that a sea-based force can possess. Multifaceted U.S. and Coalition maritime interception operations became a key tool in the escalating War on Terrorism, preventing the potentially catastrophic threats posed by transnational terrorist movement and the illicit transport of weapons and related materiel.\n\nIn distinct ways, the Navy’s multifaceted participation in OEF set the stage for its involvement in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), which a U.S.-led Coalition launched in March 2003.48 Although the OIF naval effort built on the experience of 12 years of operations in the\n\n__________\n\n47 See, for instance, Peter D.

Cordesman, The Iraq War: Strategy, Tactics, and Military Lessons (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic and International Studies Press, 2003).\n\n19\n\nPersian Gulf and North Arabian Sea, the men and women of the Navy applied the immediate experiences and operational lessons of OEF in the fast-paced military campaign that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein in just three weeks.\n\n20\n\nSelect Chronology\n\nThis chronology highlights significant events relating to the U.S. Navy’s participation in the opening phases of Operation Enduring Freedom. Earlier entries concerning the 9/11 attacks and their aftermath provide background to and highlight the stages of development of subsequent events. These background entries serve to supply a sense of context and connection between events.\n\nThe chronology aims to provide readers with a near daily progression of the major activities of U.S. and allied naval forces during the initial military response to 9/11. It is not, however, a comprehensive timeline of every operational action, command directive, or ship movement. The events detailed here offer a glimpse of how the first global conflict of the 21st century impacted the men and women of the U.S. Navy and how they, in turn, influenced the course of this multifaceted conflict.\n\nThe source base comprises unclassified archival records of the Navy and Marine Corps, as well as unclassified reports, press releases, defense analyses, book chapters, and monographs. Because the vast majority of Navy operational records from the past several decades remain classified or belong to the respective combatant commands, research for this chronology was confined to unclassified primary and secondary sources readily accessible at the Naval History and Heritage Command, Marine Corps History Division, Pentagon Library, and Library of Congress. Owing to source limitations, information regarding the operations of submarines—equipped with cruise missiles and outfitted for special operations—appears with far less frequency than that concerning aircraft carrier battle groups or amphibious ready groups. All errors and omissions are solely those of the author.\n\n21\n\n2001\n\n11 September Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorists fly two hijacked passenger airliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, into the World Trade Center in New York City, and a third, American Airlines Flight 77, into the Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 93, crashes in southwestern Pennsylvania after passengers attempt to subdue the hijackers. Subsequently referred to as 9/11, the unprecedented attacks claim the lives of more than 3,000 people. 49\n\n11 September Atlantic Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Robert J. Natter dispatches aircraft carriers John F. Kennedy (CV-67) and George Washington (CVN-73) to New York City, with their respective Carrier Air Wings (CVWs) 7 and 17, to provide coastal and air defense as well as a visible stabilizing presence. Other sortied ships include cruisers Leyte Gulf (CG-55), Monterey (CG-61), Hué City (CG-66), Vicksburg (CG-69), and Vella Gulf (CG-72), destroyers Ramage (DDG-61) and Ross (DDG-71), and fast combat support ship Detroit (AOE-4). Vella Gulf assumes duties as North Eastern Air Defense Commander, for which she establishes tactical data links and radar coverage and helps coordinate fighter combat air patrols over Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. John C. Stennis (CVN-74) and Constellation (CV-64) Carrier Battle Groups (CVBGs) are deployed to protect air and sea approaches to the West Coast. Admiral Natter also activates Mercy-class hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH-20) to assist with rescue and relief efforts in New York.50\n\n11 September Vice Admiral Charles W. Moore, Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command as well as Commander Fifth Fleet, orders the formation of a multi-carrier battle force in the North Arabian Sea under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas E.
