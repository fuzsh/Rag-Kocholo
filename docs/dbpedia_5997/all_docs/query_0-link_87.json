        "text": "Crews posted to 462 Squadron RAAF, Bomber Command, UK:-\n\n462 Squadron RAAF, 4 Group at Driffield in Yorkshire from August to December 1944, or to\n\n462 Squadron RAAF, 100 Group, Foulsham in Norfolk from January to September 1945.\n\nFor crews stationed in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia (1942/1943/1944) please visit 462 Squadron RAAF, Middle East.\n\nLink to photos of 462 Squadron at Driffield, August 1944 to end December 1944; also some more recent photos of the former RAF Driffield site.\n\nLink to photos of 462 Squadron at Foulsham, January and September 1945, but mostly during February/March/April 1945 â full Squadron with Halifax; Pilots; Navigators; Bomb Aimers; Wireless Operators; Flight Engineers; Air Gunners A Flight, Air Gunners B Flight; Special Duties; \"Top Brass\".\n\nOperational Air Crews August 1944 to May 1945.\n\nSpecial Duties (WINDOW) Twelve Wireless Operators were Posted TO 462 Squadron Foulsham in January 1945, to dispense WINDOW. A second group of 12 W/Ops carried out Special Duties (WINDOW) from late April 1945. Names for both groups are listed in separate tables on this page.\n\nSpecial Duties (Radio Counter Measures) Twelve Air Force personnel, with various former roles, were Posted TO 462 Squadron in early 1945 to carry out Radio Counter Measures. A second group of 10 personnel who arrived in April 1945 also belong to this section. Names for both groups are listed in separate tables on this page.\n\nUn-aligned Air Crew personnel Names of those who were POSTED IN with other Air Crews between August 1944 and April 1945, but who were not listed in any subsequent Ops. They are listed by month of arrival, but they have not yet been matched with any crew, and their crew positions are not yet known. This list was updated for 6 April 2017.\n\nNon-Operational Crews POSTED IN during late April or May 1945, or in June, July or August 1945, listed by month of arrival. The named crews were identified by Pilot and Crew members, after contact by some former Veterans of these crews, or by their family or friends. These Crews are not listed in Squadron Operational flights, but carried out training flights, and may have flown on Ruhr Tours, and bomb disposal by jettisoning over the North Sea. Some may have transported Senior personnel to and from Germany or Denmark, and possibly transported of ex-Luftwaffe PoWs to the UK. Such flights were mentioned in the Squadron ORB, however Pilots were not usually listed by name, but when they were, the names of the crew were not included.\n\nNon-Operational personnel POSTED IN May to August 1945, but not yet identified by crew. This list was updated for 6 April 2017.\n\nOffice Staff and Ground Crew are listed separately, and names will be added when personnel are identified.\n\nNo list has yet been located of other non-operational staff, e.g. cooks and mess staff including waitresses, Officer's batmen and batwomen, drivers, Control Tower staff, radio operators, plotters, meteorologists; Intelligence Section staff; Photographic Section staff, etc, many of whom would have been WAAFs.\n\nWAAF Staff (Women's Auxiliary Air Force) â posted to RAF Station Driffield, 4 Group (466 Squadron and 462 Squadron), OR to RAF Station Foulsham, 100 Group (192 Squadron RAF, and 462 Squadron). This list is incomplete.\n\nWanted please: Photos of crews of 462 Squadron at Driffield or Foulsham, or during their prior training at OTU or HCU; or photos of individual crew members; also names of non-operational personnel including WAAFs. If you can assist with photos, or wish to advise of errors on this page, or can provide full names etc., please make contact, including your source of information for verification. All contributors will be acknowledged. Thank you.\n\nInformation has been sourced from 462 Squadron Operational Record Books (ORBs); WW2 Nominal Roll; National Archives of Australia (NAA, Service Files, Casualty Files, and Aircraft Loss Files); Australian War Memorial; New Zealand Defence Force (Personnel Archives and Medals); Air Force Lists; London Gazette; and Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Various books and websites were also consulted to compare details, however discrepancies were noted between official records and authors. ORBs also contained typographical and factual errors. Some pages of the Squadron ORBs are difficult to read, especially when the carbon paper on the original pages had obviously required replacement, and the type-writer keys were worn and/or misaligned. This may be the reason for the differences in Names and Service Numbers, as quoted by various authors. Those names without Service Numbers and Air Force (i.e. RAF/RAFVR, RNZAF, RCAF), will have those details added after verification. Further errors have been noted in that some members were listed as POSTED IN, but were not in the POSTED OUT lists; others were not in the POSTED IN lists, but were later POSTED OUT. Some complete crews or groups were omitted in some month's documents (e.g. not POSTED IN were Breusch's Crew 30 during September 1944, Friend's Crew 36 during September or October 1944; Ely's Crew 39 during November 1944, and Lodder's Crew 44 during November 1944, Scharer's Crew 54 early January 1945; and a second group of 12 W/OPs for SD/WINDOW duties in April 1945). To further confuse issues, some members were listed in POSTING IN for two consecutive months (e.g. Langworthy's crew 34 POSTED IN October 1944 and again November 1944), similarly some members were POSTED OUT twice (e.g. Joseph Davidson DFC in July and August 1945). The lists of names on this web page have been compiled from monthly Squadron POSTING IN lists, monthly POSTING OUT lists (ORB Forms 540), and crew names from Ops (ORB Forms 541). Due to the state of the original records, these lists may still be incomplete.\n\n(Please refer to Acknowledgements page for details of books and internet sites.)\n\nOperational Air Crews August 1944 to May 1945\n\nThe list below is an amalgamation of information from all sources, following attempts to verify the accuracy of information.\n\nColumn 1 â Crew number. There does not appear to be any official list of crew numbers allocated by 462 Squadron during WW2. However on this site, the number relates to each crew, in the sequence of their posting to 462 Squadron. This system was used in \"Phoenix â Book 2: The Reincarnation\" by A.G.Batten; also by Authors of \"Brave & True\" (466 Squadron); as well as by the 466-462 Squadron Association for their records. Other authors simply refer to each crew by the Pilot's name.\n\nColumn 2 â Pilot, listed alphabetically by surname.\n\nColumns 3 to 8 â Crew members, listed by their Role in that crew. Some crews had a sequence of members over time. These have been listed as 1, 2, 3 etc, in the relevant crew position. Some personnel flew with more than one Pilot, or flew with a different crew to \"catch-up\" on Ops if they had missed an Op with their usual crew. Others were not assigned permanently to a particular crew, see also see Column 9.\n\nColumn 9 \"Special Duties\" â additional 8th Crew member who was EITHER ....\n\n.... the \"Spare Bod\" with no permanent crew or someone who wanted to \"catch-up\" an Op, and who dispensed WINDOW; OR ....\n\n.... the German-speaking Special Duties Operator (SDO) who operated the Radio Counter Measures Equipment.\n\nOn some occasions, if both were required for a particular Op, there were 9 in that crew.\n\nThe substantive role for the \"Spare Bod\" (WINDOW Dispenser) when on ops with their usual crew is included in brackets after their name, e.g. Column 9 Special Duties, Leslie Edward Miles (F/Eng) 1894484 RAFVR was Killed in Action (KIA) in the role of Special Duties dispensing WINDOW with the Astill Crew, but he was usually a Flight Engineer with another crew (pilot Donald Grant Uther).\n\nThose who were not permanently with any crew may also be listed separately. However, if they were on an Op with a crew that did not return, they are listed with that crew. Details of aircraft loss, grave sites, and PoW/Evader status will be included in each crew's page, to be created as an ongoing project.\n\nThose with two Service Numbers include those who were commissioned, and whose original Service Number was changed (e.g. RAF/RAFVR). Note that some of the RAAF Service Numbers begin with the upper-case letter O, not the number zero/nought 0. On this web page, the Service Number as initially recorded in the Squadron ORBs is placed first.\n\nPlease note that this list is still a work in progress, initially concentrating on crews who were Killed in Action (names in RED), or who already have a page on this site, or who were mainly RAAF and records are therefore readily accessible. Click on the blue hyperlinks to go to a Crew page or to a page for an individual crew member which may include a photo of their crew.\n\nPoW (in red) after a crew member's name indicates that he was taken Prisoner of War after the loss of that crew's Halifax.\n\nEvader (in red) after a crew member's name indicates that he evaded capture (with or without assistance), and returned safely to the UK.\n\nAny name followed by a ..... (?) .... indicates that details require verification."
