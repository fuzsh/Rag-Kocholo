Their target was Hamburg .\n\nThey were on the way to their target, flying over the Dutch province of Groningen, when they were intercepted around 23.00 by a German night fighter, piloted by oberfeldwebel Paul Gildner. Gildner had been successful only twenty minutes prior, when he shot down a Blenheim of 110 squadron (with crew Flt/Lt Dickinson DFC, Sgt Charles William Fry and Sgt Robert Mower) which crashed west of Groningen, near Tolbert.\n\nShortly after shooting down the Blenheim he engaged the Wellington flown by Sgt Elder and his crew over the town of Jispinghuizen. Machinegun fire was heard among the roaring engines of the planes. The Wellington was hit and started to burn. Soon after the Wellington crashed on the eastside of the main road running from Vlagtwedde to Ter Apel.\n\nOnly the nose turret gunner, Sgt Douglas Wilmott Waters, managed to bail out of the burning plane. He was taken prisoner.\n\nThe rest of the crew was buried at the Esserveld cemetery in Groningen, where they were laid to rest together with the Blenheim crew that was shot down only minutes earlier.\n\nA picture of the German fighter pilot (Ofw. Gildner) and his wireless operator, inspecting the wreck of Elder's Wellington which has been located by Stevin Oudshoorn (see below).\n\nIan Waters was able to take Douglas to visit the graves in 1999, but were unable to locate the crash site in the time they had.\n\nIn March 2016 Ian visited Holland on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the crash. With the assistance of local help he was able to meet up with Mr & Mrs Abbes and their two sons. The Wellington had crashed just short of their farmhouse in the village of Jipsinghuizen. Mr Abbesâs parents were living there at the time, and whilst they have sadly passed away, Mr Abbes was able to tell of his parents experience. Mr Abbes clearly recalled his mother having told him she saw the Germanâs extract five crew from the plane, so my fatherâs report, in which the Germans had told him Tommy had also jumped, but was too low, appears incorrect.\n\nThe following day Ian was taken to meet a Mrs Hulskar, a charming lady of 90 years old. She didnât speak English but the Abbesâs were able to interpret. As a 14 year old she had a first hand account of the events of the night of 13/14 March 1941. She recalled a terrifying experience from the noise of gunfire of the German nightfighter shooting at the Wellington at a low altitude. She then saw a fully deployed parachute coming down, which implies his father left the aircraft at a higher altitude than 400 feet. This landed in a tree which she was able to show Ian.\n\nDouglas had told Ian that he had seen lights of the German border post. This had previously caused them considerable difficulty in locating the crash site, and as the Abbesâs were to inform us, this was not a border post but a concentration camp, several of which were along the border.\n\nMrs Hulskar told us, as a child, she was in the farmhouse with her parents and two friends. Douglas had knocked on the door and they took him inside. He was taken to the kitchen and offered coffee. A knock on the door revealed two gentleman known to the occupants of the farmhouse as German collaborators. Mrs Hulskarâs father and his friend said they had seen no-one but would come and help find the parachutist, leaving their wives, Douglas and Mrs Hulskar in the house.\n\nA subsequent knock on the door revealed the mayorâs secretary who said they were aware of an escape network who would get Douglas to England. He left and they never saw him again. The mayorâs office informed the farmhouse occupants that he had made it to England. That was incorrect as he was arrested shortly afterwards.\n\nMrs Hulskar did say Douglas returned to see them after the war and thank them for their help.\n\nThis photograph was taken when they placed at wreath at the graves on the 75th anniversary. They are from left to right Gert Abbes (son of Mr & Mrs Abbes), Klass Niemeijer of the Dutch WW2 aircrash investigation unit, Mrs Abbes, Mr Abbes and Ian Waters.\n\nSadly Mr Abbes passed away in August 2016 and Mrs Hulskar in October 2017.\n\nDate of loss : 13 March 1941\n\nCrew of Wellington Mark I C N2746 (13-Mar-1941) BU-M consisted of :\n\nSgt Victor Lawrence 'Vic' Bagley, 754080, Pilot, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Nationality : United Kingdom, KIA 13 March 1941, Aged 21\n\nSgt George Cedric 'Danny' Daniel, 618264, Air Gunner, Royal Air Force, Nationality : British, KIA 13 March 1941\n\nSgt Alexander Graeme 'Mick' Elder, 754780, Pilot, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Nationality : British, KIA 13 March 1941, Aged 19\n\nSgt Sol Glazer, 40621, Navigator / Observer, Royal New Zealand Air Force, Nationality : New Zealand, KIA 13 March 1941, Aged 29\n\nSgt John La Bassee 'Jack' Tomkinson, 701366, Wireless Operator / Air Gunner, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Nationality : New Zealand, KIA 13 March 1941, Aged 22\n\nSgt Douglas Wilmott Waters, 910761, Nose Gunner, Nationality : British, POW 13 March 1941\n\nSource : Stevin Oudshoorn (Nachtjagdarchiv Horst Diener, via Ab Jansen in Wespennest Leeuwarden, vol.

According to pilot Crampton, Marshall Johnson who was rear gunner at the time, calmly announced over the intercom, as if he were talking about the weather, \"down the phones, we are under attack\" and promptly sent up a hail of gun fire to meet his attacker. The German fighter raked the forward section of BU-G killing their second pilot Jenkins and the aircraft immediately exploded in flames. The rest of the crew managed to bale out safely with only minor injuries but Sgt Kent's chute caught and tangled on the tail of the flaming aircraft and he was pulled down with it to his death.
