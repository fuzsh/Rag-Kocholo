        "text": "Another RAF veteran was killed today. Again accidents proving just as deadly as the enemy.\n\nCaptain Toné Hypollyte Bayetto was killed when the top wing of his Sopwith Dolphin (E4449) folded up and he crashed. At the time he was an instructor at 29 Training Depot Station and was instructing Hogan and others in formation flying.\n\nThe book Pearls Before Poppies suggests that he collided with an Avro flown by Sergeant Patrick Hogan. Confusingly the RAF casualty cards for Hogan show two different dates for his accident, both 4 April 1918 and 4 August 1918. The second of these suggest he collided with a Sopwith Scout (D4176) rather than a Dolphin, so I think this is probably incorrect.\n\nBayetto’s own card suggests simply that he was performing “an acrobatic”. Bayetto had earned the nickname “Mad Jack” for his stunting.\n\nBayetto had obtained his pilot licence in 1913. He started in the RFC as a Sergeant Pilot back in 1915, flying Morane Saulnier Type Ns with 8 Squadron RFC. One of the most well know photos of an RFC Type N features Bayetto in the cockpit.\n\nAfter stints at the front he was serving with 66 Squadron RFC when on 30 September 1917 he was shot down and fractured his skull in the crash. He was sent home to recover and then posted to East Boldre as an instructor.\n\nBayetto’s father was head chef at one of London’s leading hotels and was always happy to give any RFC friends of his son a good meal free of charge.\n\nOut in Italy, a patrol from 66 Squadron RFC, with Lieutenant Alan Jerrard, Captain Peter Carpenter, MC and Lieutenant Harold Ross Eycott-Martin, was flying over Borgo del Moli when they engaged a group of Austrian Albatros DIIIs. The official medal citation takes up the story:\n\n“When on an offensive patrol with two other officers he attacked five enemy aeroplanes and shot down one in flames, following it down within one hundred feet of the ground.\n\nHe then attacked an enemy aerodrome from a height of only fifty feet from the ground, and, engaging single-handed some nineteen machines, which were either landing or attempting to take off, succeeded in destroying one of them, which crashed on the aerodrome. A large number of machines attacked him, and whilst thus fully occupied he observed that one of the pilots of his patrol was in difficulties. He went immediately to his assistance, regardless of his own personal safety, and destroyed a third enemy machine.\n\nFresh enemy aeroplanes continued to rise from the aerodrome, which he attacked one after another, and only retreated, still engaged with five enemy machines, when ordered to do so by his patrol leader. Although apparently wounded, this very gallant officer turned repeatedly, and attacked single-handed the pursuing machines, until he was eventually overwhelmed by numbers and driven to the ground.”\n\nGerrard was credited with three official victories for this action, though he claimed at least six. He was eventually brought down and taken prisoner. The fact that he survived almost completely unscathed is something of a miracle as his Sopwith Camel (B5648) had 163 bullet holes in it.\n\nFor the action, Gerrard was awarded the Victoria Cross, and Carpenter and Eycott-Ross were awarded the Military Cross. Due to his capture Jerrard was eventually presented with his Victoria Cross by George V at Buckingham Palace on 5 April 1919.\n\nOut in Italy, 66 Squadron RFC had moved about 35 miles east from Grossa to Treviso on 18 February 1918. They were soon back in the action.\n\nYesterday various patrols claimed two enemy aircraft shot down. Early on near Motta, North East of Treviso, Lieutenant Harold Ross Eycott-Martin, in Sopwith Camel B5623 claimed an Aviatik C. Just before midday, Captain Kenneth Barbour Montgomery in Camel B4628 shot down an Albatros DV. near Fonzaszo, to the North West of Treviso. Unfortunately, 2nd Lieutenant Arnold Baillie Reade failed to return from a patrol in Camel B2534 and was later reported as having been killed in a flying accident.\n\nToday 2nd Lieutenant Albert Frederick Bartlett was in the opposite direction in his Camel B5594 near Motta, south west of Treviso, when he forced down another Albatross DV.\n\nCaptain Montgomery was not so lucky, he failed to return from a patrol after being hit by ground fire, crashed in a vineyard near Rustignè di Oderzo, and was taken prisoner in Camel B4628. Meanwhile, his 28 Squadron colleague 2nd Lieutenant Harold Butler also went missing in his Camel (B6362) and was later reported killed.\n\nIn a day of mishaps, Lieutenant Eycott-Martin had his engine shot up but managed to limp home.\n\n2nd Lieutenant Norman Samuel Taylor and 2nd Lieutenant William Carrall Hilborn ended up landing in Grossa due to fog whilst ferrying new Camels to Treviso (B5226 and B6406). Finally, 2nd Lieutenant Herbert Newton Edward Row crashed his Camel (B5190) on landing at Treviso from a patrol.\n\nToday, the RFC bombed the German 14th Army Headquarters at Vittorio in Italy.\n\nTen RE8s from 42 Squadron escorted by Sopwith Camels from 28 and 66 Squadron made the raid at around 1000 this morning. They were met by enemy fighters from Jasta 1, and in the ensuing combat 3 enemy planes were claimed. Also in the fighting, Captain Ralph Erskine from 66 Squadron was shot down in his Camel (B6414). He crash landed in the front line trenches and was taken prisoner with a leg wound. He died of his wounds shortly afterwards. He was the first British airman killed in Italy.\n\nHe had been married in March 1917 and his son was born shortly after his death on 18 January. He too was killed in the Second World War at the same age (25).\n\nToday, 28 Squadron RFC became the first British air unit to arrive in Italy to support operations there.\n\nBack on 26 October 1917, the British and French Governments had agreed to send divisions from the Western front to help the Italians, and three days later a British detachment, consisting of the head-quarters of the XIV Corps, together with the 23rd and 44th Divisions, had been ordered to Italy. General Sir Herbert C. O. Plumer arrived to take command of the British troops in Italy on 10 November and he established his head-quarters at Legnago, but shortly afterwards moved to Padua.\n\nFor air co-operation. 28 Squadron RFC Sopwith Camels) and 34 Squadron RFC (RE8s)have been withdrawn from France, and grouped to form 51 Wing under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Percy Mills.\n\nEach squadron has been allotted one month’s supply of petrol and oil, an adequate supply of transport and spares, and had their establishments increased to allow of immediate replacements of casualties. This is to allow the units to operated independently until the relevant support services can be set up.\n\nThe first trains left Candas in France on 7 November. The Squadrons have travelled by train, rather than flying, such is the uncertainty surrounding the operations, and this way the aircraft and stores can travel together.\n\nWhile these arrangements were under way, an Allied conference on 5 November at Rapallo, agreed to send two additional British divisions to Italy, with two more aeroplane squadrons in this case 45 and 66 Squadrons RFC (Sopwith Camels)\n\nThe War Cabinet then decided to send yet a third detachment to Italy, consisting of the XI Corps headquarters\n\nand two divisions, and so another corps squadron. 42 Squadron RFC (RE8s) was earmarked. These Squadrons will begin their transfer over the next few days.\n\nThe poor weather continued for much of the day on the Western Front, but started to clear by the evening. As is becoming common these days due to the presence of almost half of the German air strength in the area, a mass dogfight ensued over the Ypres Salient around 1915 and carried on for some two hours.\n\nThe fight developed when two flights from 56 Squadron RFC attacked a group of German scouts, and were joined by flights from 19, 66 and 70 Squadrons RFC, and 10 Naval Squadron. Other German scouts from Jastas 11 and 27 then joined in. The Official History suggests there were more than 90 aircraft involved! Despite the size, or perhaps because of it, much of the fighting was indecisive with only one pilot on each side killed.\n\nEarly in the combat Captain Noel William Ward Webb in Camel B3756 from 70 Squadron shot down an Albatross with Jasta 11’s Leutnant Otto Brauneck on board. Brauneck crashed near Zonnebeck and was killed. Webb reported:\n\n“There were about 6 EA below me and on the way back to lines I dived on the leading machine, letting off a burst of about 50 rounds. I saw the EA wobble and then fall plane over plane and finally spin. Later, I thought I saw this EA crashed on the ground”\n\nAround the same time, 2nd Lieutenant Joseph Cecil Smith in Camel B3814 from the same squadron also claimed an Albatros out of control, though this could not be confirmed. Smith’s aircraft was also badly shot up but he was uninjured.\n\nCaptain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell and 2nd Lieutenant Leonard Monteagle Barlow from 56 Squadron both claimed enemy aircraft forced down. Shortly after this their Flight Commander Captain Phillip Bernard Prothero was killed when the wing of his SE5’s (A8925) wing collapsed. Vitfeldwebel Alfred Muth from Jasta 27 claimed this but Barlow and Webb reported the aircraft breaking up in a dive. Webb stated:\n\n‘Early in the operation I saw a red nosed SE5 diving on an EA. The pilot seemed to me to dive his machine over the vertical and then both planes on one side folded back and the machine descended in a spinning nose dive.’\n\n2nd Lieutenant A Wearne from 19 Squadron was taken prisoner when his rudder cable was shot through and unable to steer he landed at Faumont aerodrome escorted in by 3 Albatrosses.\n\nAs the combat came to a close, Lieutenant James Thomas Byford McCudden flying Sopwith Pup B1756 from 66 Squadron also claimed an Albatross Scout out of control. It was his second and last victory in the Pup before switching to the SE5a.\n\nPilots at this time well aware that they were in just as much danger from their colleagues as the enemy, particularly once a dogfight broke out.\n\n66 Squadron RFC were on patrol today around 1315 when they encountered Jasta 8. Both 2nd Lt Archibald Garden Robertson in Sopwith Pup A6207 and 2nd Lieutenant Archibald Vincent Shirley in Sopwith Pup B1745 were both killed. At the time it was believed that Shirley had collided with an enemy aircraft but it was later confirmed that the two Pups had collided with each other. Nevertheless, Oberleutnant Konrad Mettlich claimed them as his first two victories.\n\nOther members of the patrol, Captain James Douglas Latta MC in Sopwith Pup B1726 and Lieutenant Arthur Burrell Thorne in Sopwith Pup A6181 were both badly shot about but escaped.\n\nFlying was curtailed today due to poor weather.\n\nThere were no casualties from enemy aircraft today, although 2nd Lieutenant HR Parry From 40 Squadron RFC was forced to land his Nieuport Scout (B1541) after the petrol tank was holed from the ground. 2nd Lieutenant William Thomas Walder also from 40 Squadron bodged a landing, coming down on one wheel and then putting another Nieuport Scout (A6785) on its nose.\n\nA variety of other mishaps wrecked three Sopwith Strutters. 2nd Lieutenant Charles Henry Harriman and 2nd Lieutenant William Stuart Cattell from 43 Squadron crashed 8232 on landing from gun practice. Sergeant G Skinner and 2nd Class Air Mechanic A Giles from 70 Squadron also crashed 8211 following an engine failure on a reconnaissance mission. Lieutenant John Ross Robertson from 66 Squadron overturned A6154 when he made a forced landing on soft ground following an offensive patrol.\n\nLuckily none of these crewmen were hurt.\n\nThe action in the air continued with the offensive on the ground. Seven British aircraft were shot down with eight crew killed, 5 wounded and 2 taken prisoner. The British also claimed 36 enemy aircraft forced down or shot down though in the event the Germans only confirmed 2 wounded and 2 killed.\n\nThe big operation of the day was a combined reconnaissance and bombing mission to Le Quesnoy and Landrecies. A distant reconnaissance by nine Sopwith Strutters from 70 Squadron accompanied by six Sopwith Pups from 66 Squadron failed due to low cloud and on the way back the formation was attacked over Solesmesby six Halberstadts. One of the two-seater Sopwiths was shot down in flames and one of the escorting pilots was forced to land and was made prisoner.\n\n2nd Lieutenant Clive Harold Halse and 2nd Air Mechanic William J Bond from 70 Squadron in Sopwith Strutter (A1002) were shot down by Leutnant Fritz Otto Bernert from Jasta 2.\n\n2nd Lieutenant Robert Stanley Capon from 66 Squadron got separated from the formation and shot down by Oberleutnant Heinrich Lorenz from Jasta 33 in Sopwith Pup A6175. He crashed near Cambrai and was taken prisoner. Three of his colleagues were also shot but managed to escape back over the lines – 2nd Lieutenant Reginald Myer Marsh in Sopwith Pup A670, Captain Robert Oxspring in Sopwith Pup A7305, and 2nd Lieutenant Cecil Charles Morley in Sopwith Pup A6152.\n\nThe bombing formations, which followed, fared better. Five Martinsydes from 27 Squadron each dropped one 230-lb. bomb in the neighbourhood of the sheds at Ath Station. The three escorting SPADs had a brief indecisive encounter with two Albatros two-seaters on the outward journey, but there was no other opposition.\n\nBernert then flew south to engage a 6 strong bombing formation from 9 Squadron returning from a raid on Busigny and shot three of them down. Lieutenant Charles Lee Graves in BE2e A2941, Lieutenant Frank Arthur Matthews in BE2e A2937, and Lieutenant George Edward Hicks in BE2e 7195. Graves and Matthews were killed and Hicks was taken prisoner."
