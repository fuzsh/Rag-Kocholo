Against strongly-defended targets he soon displayed the courage and determination of an exceptional leader. He was always ready to accept extra risks to ensure success. Defying the formidable Ruhr defences, he frequently released his bombs from below 2,000 feet. Over Cologne in November, 1940, a shell burst inside his aircraft, blowing out one side and starting a fire; undeterred, he went on to bomb his target. About this time, he carried out a number of convoy, patrols in addition to his bombing missions. At the end of his first tour of operational duty in January, 1941, he immediately volunteered for a second. Again, he pressed home his attacks with the utmost gallantry. Berlin, Bremen, Cologne, Duisberg, Essen and Kiel were among the heavily-defended targets which he attacked. When he was posted for instructional duties in January, 1942, he undertook four more operational missions. He started a third operational tour in August, 1942, when he was given command of a squadron. He led the squadron with outstanding skill on a number of missions, before being appointed in March, 1943, as a station commander. In October, 1943, he undertook a fourth operational tour, relinquishing the rank of Group Captain at his own request so that he could again take part in operations. He immediately set to work as the pioneer of a new method of marking enemy targets involving very low flying. In June, 1944, when marking a target in the harbour at Le Havre in broad daylight and without cloud cover, he dived well below the range of the light batteries before releasing his markerbombs, and he came very near to being destroyed by the strong barrage which concentrated on him. During his fourth tour which ended in July, 1944, Wing Commander Cheshire led his squadron personally on every occasion, always undertaking the most dangerous and difficult task of marking the target alone from a low level in the face of strong defences. Wing Commander Cheshire's cold and calculated acceptance of risks is exemplified by his conduct in an. attack on Munich in April, 1944. This was an experimental attack to test out the new method of target marking at low level against a heavily-defended target situated deep in Reich territory. Munich was selected, at Wing Commander Cheshire's request, because of the formidable nature of its light anti-aircraft and searchlight defences. He was obliged to follow, in bad weather, a direct route which took him over the defences of Augsburg and thereafter he was continuously under fire. As he reached the target, flares were .being released by our high-flying aircraft. He was illuminated from above and below. All guns within range opened fire on him. Diving to 700 feet, he dropped his markers with great precision and began to climb away. So blinding were the searchlights that he almost lost control. He then flew over the city at 1,000 feet to assess the accuracy of his work and direct other aircraft. His own was badly hit by shell fragments but he continued to fly over the target area until he was satisfied that, he had done all in his power to ensure success. Eventually, when he set course for base, the task of disengaging himself from the defences proved even more hazardous than the approach., For a full twelve minutes after leaving the target'area he was under withering fire but he came safely through.\n\nWing Commander Cheshire has now completed a total of 100 missions. In four years of fighting against the bitterest opposition he has maintained a record of outstanding personal achievement, placing himself invariably in the forefront of the battle. What he did in the Munich operation was typical of the careful planning, brilliant, execution and contempt for danger which has established for Wing Commander Cheshire a reputation second to none in Bomber Command.\n\nChichester,\n\nPatrick George\n\n18.03.1901\n\nBarnstaple, Devon\n\n-\n\nSq.Ldr.\n\n01.02.1937 [17241]\n\nW/Cdr.\n\n?\n\n(T) Gp.Capt.\n\n01.07.1943 (retd 15.09.1947)\n\n14.07.1923\n\ncommissioned\n\nChild,\n\nJohn\n\nYounger son of Dr. Noel Child, and Elspeth Child (later Guilfoyle), of Shackerley Hall, Albrighton, Wolverhampton. 14.06.1918\n\n-\n\n03.09.1948\n\n[burial from RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, locality Musselburgh]\n\nP/O 29.07.1939 [33435] F/O 03.09.1940 (WS) F/Lt. 03.09.1941 F/Lt. 21.05.1946, seniority 29.01.1943 (T) Sq.Ldr. 03.12.1946, seniority 01.07.1944 Sq.Ldr. 01.10.1946\n\n25.02.1947, seniority 01.06.1945\n\nEducation: RAF College, Cranwell.\n\n29.07.1939 commissioned, RAF (General Duties Branch) ? - ? ? 08.1948 - 03.09.1948 Commanding Officer, 612 Squadron RAF (Dyce)\n\n[Killed in a flying accident in Spitfire FR14 TP240 that crashed near Holmside, Co.

When the aircraft was reported missing search patrols interrogated a Headsman of a Burma village who informed the patrol that the aircraft had crashed into the sea about 8 miles from the shore. The Headsman produced a damaged log book (Stuart). A later patrol between Tavoy and Mergui found a valise which had been washed ashore with the name ‘Allard’ marked on it. The villager stated to this patrol that the aircraft was seen flying low, it exploded and fell into the sea. The crew members of the Expeditor were: Flying Officer William Stanley Allard (186359) (RAFVR) (Pilot), Flying Officer Donald Ian Paul Stuart (201103) (RAFVR) (Navigator).

William Neville Cumming, O.B.E., D.F.C., A.F.R.Ae., F.R.Met.S. He was 55 years of age. Known to his friends as \"Bill,\" though sometimes as \"Neville,\" G/C. Cumming had devoted most of his working life to aviation, in which his career was both active and distinguished. Between 1917 and 1926 he served first in the R.N.A.S. and then in the R.A.F., in France and India. He next went to Canada for four years, where he did much pioneer civil flying. In 1931 he joined Imperial Airways, with whom he remained until 1938. During this period he was concerned with the introduction of flying-boat services, carrying out the first tests of the Short Caledonia from Southampton to Alexandria on March 4th, 1937. He also inaugurated the New York to Bermuda service on June 12th, 1937. It was in 1936 that he obtained his first-class navigator's ticket. Between 1939 and 1945 he again served with the R.A.F., first in Coastal Command and later as staff officer in charge of anti-U-boat defences in the Indian Ocean. Since the war he had been associated with several air transport companies and had been director of TSIorth-West Airlines (I.O.M.), G/C. Cumming. Ltd., and Southern Engineering Co., Ltd. In 1949, G/C. Cumming served for a year as Master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators of the British Empire. This was the year in which the Queen, as Princess Elizabeth, was installed as Grand Master of the Guild. She in turn installed the Master. G/C. Cumming was also a past chairman of the British Air Charter Association, a past-president of F.I.T.A.P., a member of the Council of the Air League of the British Empire and a member of the Helicopter Association of Great Britain. Sympathy is extended to his widow, son and daughter.

His untiring efforts and outstanding ability have been reflected in the splendid work accomplished by the squadron which he commands. One day in March, 1942, he was wounded in the head during a sortie. Despite this, he flew his aircraft safely back to base. Following a short enforced rest, he returned with renewed vigour. Squadron Leader Currant has destroyed at least 14 and damaged many more enemy aircraft.\n\n** This officer has led his flight with great skill and courage in air combats in the defence of London. He has destroyed seven enemy aircraft and damaged a number of others. His splendid example and fine fighting spirit have inspired the other pilots in his flight.\n\n*** Since September, 1940, this officer has personally destroyed six enemy aircraft and damaged several others, bringing his total to thirteen.
