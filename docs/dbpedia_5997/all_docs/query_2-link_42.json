        "text": "In memory of Sergeant John Elwyn JOHN RAFVR, 1153102 and the crew of ED989\n\nNo. 5 Group, RAF Bomber Command, No. 57 Squadron\n\nThis is dedicated to my Great Uncle John Elwyn JOHN, to his crew on Lancaster ED989, and to all RAF air and ground personnel who without hesitation put their lives on the line day and night during World War II. Also, with gratitude to the people of Lincolnshire, who made space in their hearts and lives to support all those that served in Bomber Command.\n\nUntil the pandemic hit in 2020, John Elwyn had just been a photograph in the hallway at my father’s house. A smiling 21-year-old air gunner who lost his life on Lancaster ED989, August 1943. The following has been compiled from interpreting John’s MOD records, National Archive documentation, extremely helpful members of various Bomber Command/Lancaster social media groups, and many a late night researching the internet.\n\nJohn Elwyn JOHN was born on 22 January 1922 at 1 Howells Terrace, Heol Las, Glamorgan, Wales. His father was David Llewelyn JOHN, a Tin Plate worker and his mother was Margaret (nee BODYCOMBE). He was their fifth child; his older sister Ruby Elvira JOHN is my paternal grandmother.\n\nAt the time he was born, Heol Las was a small close-knit and hardworking Welsh village. The main source of income for men came from working in either a coal mine, a tin plate works or in agriculture, though economically times were becoming very challenging. John Elwyn lived within a stone’s throw of his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. He went to the local Council school in the next village of Birchgrove. The family were heavily involved in local chapel worship. I have found newspaper articles about the JOHN family from the 1910s and their activities at Capel Saron, Birchgrove, with his aunts and uncles winning awards for recitals and singing in the choir.\n\nIn a transcript from John Elwyn’s maternal aunt, Deborah BODYCOMBE recorded in 1976, she mentions her sister Margaret (John Elwyn’s mother) used to travel to Llansamlet, the next village bringing her seven children to visit their grandmother Mary. Deborah said that when the grandchildren came to visit, their grandmother used to buy a cow’s tongue, which she stuffed and slow cooked on the open fire. She then thinly sliced the tongue before serving. By all accounts it was delicious, and everyone looked forward to this family meal!\n\nIn his early years, John Elwyn experienced close personal loss. In 1934, his younger sister Rita Eileen passed away with pneumonia aged 3½. His mother Margaret passed away with cancer in January 1939, aged 45. This was two weeks before John Elwyn’s 17th birthday. On the 1939 register taken on 29 September his occupation is listed as “Colliery Worker Sumpmans Mate (Above ground).” With local employment opportunities diminishing within the tin plate works, his father had moved to Ebbw Vale to work in the steel industry. John Elwyn and his younger siblings remained in Heol Las as World War II broke.\n\nJohn Elwyn became a RAF Volunteer Reserve as an Aircraftman 2nd class (AC2) aged 18 years. He was based at RAF Cardington, Bedfordshire from May to August 1940. He then moved to No. 951 Squadron in Bristol, which later merged with No. 927 Squadron. On 4 February 1941 he became an Aircraftman 1st class (AC1), then promoted to Leading Aircraftman (LAC) on 8 August 1942. The following month he was attached to No. 11 Balloon Centre at Pucklechurch, 7 miles from Bristol City Centre.\n\nIn October 1942, he travelled to London to the Air Crew Recruiting Centre (ACRC). Here, recruits completed a basic induction, undertook a series of rigorous medical checks, and completed tests to identify roles for which they would be suitable. For John Elwyn this was as an air gunner.\n\nHe was posted to No. 14 Initial Training Wing (ITW) at Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire. Here the recruits took physical training on the sea front and went to training classes in the Spa Royal Hall. They were billeted in requisitioned local people’s homes, boarding houses, and hotels. Two months later he moved further north to No. 4 Air Gunnery School (AGS) based at RAF Morpeth, Northumberland.\n\nFrom the book RAF Morpeth: A Forgotten Airfield in Northumberland by Graeme Rendall (2021), I have discovered that John Elwyn was possibly part of No. 21 course that arrived on 22 December 1942. It says that “December 1942 had seen plenty of bad weather, including plenty of thick haze, with no less than 11 days being regarded as completely unfit for flying.”\n\nOn 27 February 1943 John Elwyn received his temporary sergeant stripes and on 2 March 1943, he commenced his Air Gunner Occupational Training at No. 12 O.T.U., RAF Chipping Warden, Northamptonshire. This was the point when the recruits formed an air crew of five which included a pilot, navigator, bomb aimer, wireless operator, and a gunner. The usual method for “crewing up” was putting all the trainees from the various occupational training schools into an aircraft hangar and leaving them to sort themselves out! The flight engineer and an additional gunner usually joined later at the heavy conversion training, making up a crew of seven able to operate on a Lancaster.\n\nI have identified from archive photographs that S/L Benjamin Southam AMBROSE (Pilot) and Sgt Donald Edwin NYE (Wireless Operator) were at RAF Chipping Warden at the same time as John Elwyn. On 22 April 1943 John Elwyn moved to RAF Swinderby, Lincolnshire, part of No. 1660 C.U. for heavy conversion training. It was here that his crew were joined by an additional gunner, F/S James Lawrence LAMB RCAF. For a brief period, John Elwyn was attached to No. 1485 (Bomber) Gunnery Flight based at RAF Dunholme Lodge, Lincolnshire.\n\nOn 9 June 1943 John Elwyn moved to No. 467 (RAAF) Squadron, RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. In the Operations Record Book of No. 467 (RAAF) Squadron from the National Archives (AIR-17-1930-11), John Elwyn is listed in the “Personnel – Posting in” from No. 1660 C.U. with all his other crew members and pilot S/L Benjamin Southam AMBROSE.\n\nSadly, S/L AMBROSE (https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/100319/) was the 2nd pilot on Lancaster ED4983 who set off to Dusseldorf on 11 June 1943 at 22:25. He and his crew were recorded as “Missing with no news received.” Later it was discovered that the plane had been hit by flak battery I./514 and crashed at Frenz, Germany. He is remembered at the Rheinberg War Cemetery, Germany.\n\nIn the same Operations Record Book, there is an entry “The evening of 11 June 1943 the Squadron held a dance in the gymnasium for the benefit of the Squadron Sports Fund. It was very well attended and was voted an extremely popular affair. Many of the men we would have liked to see there, however, were off on the first operation this month, the attack on Dusseldorf.” I feel this would have been a much-needed respite for the base from the demands of the war effort, but sad knowing S/L AMBROSE was one of the casualties from that raid.\n\nA week later, John Elwyn and the remaining crew were posted to RAF Wigsley, Nottinghamshire to join No. 1654 C.U. for further heavy conversion training.\n\nOn 28 July 1943, his final posting was to No. 57 Squadron at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire. The Operations Record Book of No. 57 Squadron from the National Archives (AIR-27-538-35) states that Wing Commander Walter Ralph HASKELL DFC took over from Wing Commander Frederick Campbell HOPCROFT DFC. It goes on to say “W/Cr. HASKELL DFC & crew posted to Squadron.” I assume that John Elwyn and his crew had already been allocated to fly with W/C Walter Ralph HASKELL before they came to No. 57 Squadron.\n\nI have found six sorties for John Elwyn from his time at No. 57 Squadron, the final one he and the crew never returned. Their first sortie together was on 29 July 1943 on Lancaster JA914, target Hamburg City Centre with John Elwyn in the position of rear gunner. This sortie had a 2nd pilot on-board, S/L Malcolm CROCKER (https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/105262/). S/L Malcolm CROCKER later went on to become a Wing Commander and DFC. Tragically he lost his life 21 June 1944 as part of No. 49 Squadron attack on the synthetic-oil plant at Wesseling. He and his crew never returned, he is remembered at the Rheinberg War Cemetery, Germany.\n\nOn his future sorties John Elwyn was in the position of mid-upper gunner, all the same crew. These sorties included:\n\n30 July 1943, Lancaster JA914, Remscheid\n\n9 August 1943, Lancaster ED827, Mannheim (Sortie not completed as rear turret unserviceable)\n\n10 August 1943, Lancaster JA914, Nuremburg\n\n12 August 1943, Lancaster ED698, Milan\n\nHis final sortie was 17 August 1943, leaving RAF Scampton at 21:44 flying into a moonlit sky. This was part of Operation Hydra; the target was the German V2 rocket factory at Peenemünde. He flew on Lancaster ED989, DX-F, Frederick III. The Operations Record Book of No. 57 Squadron from the National Archives (AIR-27-538-38) states “Missing, lost contact after take-off.” The plane was in the third wave of Lancaster bombers leaving the UK that night. When returning from Germany, ED989 was understood to be the 32nd or 33rd plane to be shot down.\n\nThe crew of ED989 is listed below. They had a 2nd pilot on board, F/S Cyril BUTTERWORTH who transferred into No. 57 Squadron on 14 August 1943:\n\nW/C Walter Ralph HASKELL DFC, Pilot – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/110183\n\nF/S Cyril BUTTERWORTH, 2nd Pilot – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/103410\n\nSgt Ronald Amos Charles Martin STRINGER, Flight Engineer – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/122561\n\nF/O James JONES, Navigator – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/112446\n\nSgt John Furniss HARKNESS, Bomb Aimer – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/109932\n\nSgt Donald Edwin NYE, Wireless Operator – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/117465\n\nSgt John Elwyn JOHN, Mid-Upper Gunner – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/112176/\n\nF/S James Lawrence LAMB RCAF, Rear Gunner – https://losses.internationalbcc.co.uk/loss/113416\n\nJohn Elwyn is also remembered in the commemorative book at Scampton Church, panel 98:\n\nhttps://scamptonchurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RAF-Scampton-Window-Commemorative-Book-Compressed.pdf\n\nAs a family we are immensely proud of him, what he achieved during his RAFVR career and his dedication to serving his country, may he and his fellow service men and women never be forgotten.\n\nSent by his Great Niece Bev Davies. With a special thanks to Richard JOHN from the extended family in South Wales for providing invaluable information about Heol Las and keeping John’s memory alive by visiting the local war memorial in Primrose Park, Llansamlet on behalf of the family.\n\nFlt Lt W F Martin DFC – Story Behind the Stone\n\n“On the night of 21 June 1944, Lancaster Mk III ND 471 “A-Able” of No 57 Squadron took off from RAF East Kirkby at 2302 as part of a raid on an oil plant at Wesseling, Germany. It did not return, although its crew did, being forced to ditch in the North Sea in the early hours of 22 June, having completed their mission and taken flak returning over the Dutch Coast, which holed the fuel tanks and steadily cut the engines. The Navigator was Flying Officer William Fisher Martin who, for his actions on this and other missions, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The raid on Wesseling was one of 32 operational missions he completed with 57 Sqn, based at RAF East Kirkby. Having completed this operational tour he went on to be the Navigation Leader for 617 Sqn, based at RAF Woodhall Spa, and deployed to the Far East in early 1945 as part the Tiger Force effort preparing for War with Japan.\n\nThese are his memories of the night they ditched:\n\n“We huddled together in the rocking dinghy, seven very scared, very wet and very much at sea airmen. We watched with a sense of loss the large starboard wing of good old A for Able sinking lower in the water. She had carried us safely through our last 15 ops and she was now going down into the depths of the North Sea, leaving us on the surface, crouched miserably in our all too small dinghy, still only half realising our predicament. It had all happened very quickly. One minute we were happily wending our way homewards, 5,000 ft, 175 on the clock and the contented feeling of another ‘job’ successfully completed”.\n\n“It had been a tough one, with four separate attacks by a rocket-firing night fighter and we had been very very thankful when we crossed, safely as we thought, the Dutch coast, and headed out to sea. Suddenly, for no accountable reason, A for Able swung round in a semi-circle and headed East again.”\n\nThe fuel tanks had been holed and both starboard engines had stopped. The Flight Engineer soon found that fuel tanks which should have contained more than 200 gallons were now empty. The port inner engine had also stopped and the last remaining engine was coughing badly.\n\n“The Skipper’s voice came quietly to us over the intercom. “Prepare to ditch.” A few minutes while everyone collected their remaining wits about them and made their respective preparations. I hastily fixed our position and passed it in message form to the Wireless Operator, who had immediately commenced distress signals.”\n\n“All too soon came the dreaded order “Ditching stations!” We took off our harnesses, inflated our Mae Wests and scrambled back to our crash positions. “Escape hatches off!” “1000 feet”, “500 feet”, “200 feet”, “Prepare for impact!” – we braced ourselves for the crash – and then oblivion!”\n\n“When I scrambled to my feet the water was up to my knees and ‘Snow’ the Bomb Aimer was thrusting the dinghy packs into my hands. Automatically in pitch blackness I stumbled to the upper escape hatch and thrust them up to the awaiting hands – dinghy and radio followed and then I scrambled up through the hatch and breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the Skipper crawling along the top of the cabin – good old Nick – were we all out then? A quick scramble on to the wing – already awash – and then into the dinghy, steadying it to help Nick aboard (she was already floating) “all present?” “Jack?” “Geoff?” “Johnny?” – all correct! “OK, cut the line” – momentary panic as A for Able keeled over on her nose and stood threateningly above us, a huge mass in the darkness. “Paddle! Paddle for God’s sake!” It seemed hours until we worked our way by pushing on the wing and thrusting off from the clear wing tip and then we were left, watching her go down – our trusty old kite – damn Jerry anyway”.\n\n“Slowly we quieted ourselves and tried to take stock. The Skipper’s face was a mess, he was bleeding freely and was a bit dazed. Someone fumbled in the darkness for the first aid kit. Then we realised there was more water in the dinghy than we would like. Snowy tore off his flying boot and we began to bale. Eventually we got organised, rigging the mast for the portable radio transmitter and turning the handle, which gave us a ray of hope. The occasional wave broke over us and soon we were cold and miserable and feeling very sorry for ourselves. Dawn came slowly, after we had been in the water for nearly 3 hours”.\n\n“At about 8 o’clock, we were roused by the sound of engines and saw, low and well to the South, a couple of aircraft speeding Eastwards, probably off to photograph the damage we had done the previous night. Time dragged by until we heard engines again and saw a large aircraft below cloud and well to the South. Miserably we watched it turn away and disappear. Later we heard it again and I took the flare pistol from my battle dress. As it turned some distance from us I fired off a cartridge. It carried on. They hadn’t seen it!”\n\n“Shortly before noon it reappeared and I waited until it seemed near enough and fired off another cartridge. Again it turned away and we sat back, our hopes dashed. Then it turned and, this time, seemed to head straight for us. I reloaded hastily and fired again, and this time there was no mistake. They had spotted us! Scrambling to our feet we cheered and waved as they banked and flew over us. A bigger dinghy was dropped and inflated on impact. We paddled over to it and climbed aboard. It was wonderful, the lift in morale, once we felt safe”.\n\n“The aircraft kept station above us and signalled that help was on its way. Sometime later it headed away East, then swung round towards us again and soon after we saw the bow waves of a naval launch approaching. When it arrived we were helped aboard, given dry clothing and a large mug of naval rum. Never had a drink been more appreciated, and I remember little else until we docked at Yarmouth later, having been in a deep sleep”.\n\n“The Skipper and I spent a couple of nights in a naval hospital and then we were driven to the nearest airfield and flown back to East Kirkby, where the rest of the crew had already arrived. We learned that the base had lost 11 aircraft that night and morale was low, so that our arrival had brought a great boost to the Station as a whole, and I can well appreciate the hopes raised by our return”.\n\nDowned at 0210, and spotted by an Air Sea Rescue aircraft around midday, when they boarded the rescue launch they had been afloat for 12 hours. An investigation revealed that their emergency calls had not been heard and that they had been lucky to have been rescued so soon. The aircraft that spotted them was on a separate mission looking for dinghies that had been dropped the previous day, but once they were seen the air-sea rescue system swung quickly into action.\n\nOn the afternoon of the flight, the crew had carried out the usual pre-ops check flight, a short trip to make sure that everything was working correctly and flown early enough to allow the engineers to fix any snags. It was a bright, sunny day, and the trip was uneventful. After they had made their way back to their parking spot, the pilot made an unusual decision that was to prove vital to their survival that night. He decided they should practice their ditching drill. Ignoring the hoots of derision from their colleagues and groundcrew in the June sunshine, they went through the ditching routine, even extracting the dinghy from the fuselage and carrying it out onto the wing. The Skipper could not explain why he decided to run the drill but, when debriefed, the crew attributed their safe escape to the fact that they had just practiced for the event. It was a message quickly passed to other bomber units.\n\nThe Wesseling raid itself was a disaster for 5 Group; of 133 aircraft that were airborne that night, 37 were lost, mainly due to night fighters that intercepted the bomber stream over Holland. 200 men lost their lives, 44 became prisoners of war and 9 evaded capture. RAF East Kirby alone lost 11 aircraft that night; A-Able’s crew was the only one of those to return.\n\nFlt Lt William Fisher Martin’s DFC citation reads as follows:\n\nThis officer has participated in many operational sorties against a variety of targets. He has proved himself a most efficient navigator, and has always displayed outstanding courage and determination throughout his operational tour. His fine technical skill has largely contributed to the success of many missions. In April 1944 his aircraft was detailed to attack Schweinfurt. On the outward flight it was attacked and damaged by an enemy fighter. The rear gunner was wounded and the inter-communication system and the elevator were damaged, both turrets also being rendered unserviceable. Flying Officer Martin calmly navigated the damaged aircraft to the target, which was bombed, and safely back to this country, where a successful landing was accomplished. Again, in June 1944, during an attack on a target in West Germany, his aircraft was damaged by anti-aircraft fire and the petrol tank was holed. On the return flight, owing to lack of fuel, the bomber was forced down on to the sea. After more than twelve hours in the dinghy, the crew were rescued. Despite slight head injuries, Flying Officer Martin’s cool courage and cheerfulness were a source of inspiration to the rest of the crew”.\n\nHappily, Bill Martin survived the War and, although he died not long after retirement in 1980, he was able to meet up with the rest of his crew in 1979 at the first reunion of 57 and 630 Squadrons. He had 3 daughters, Margaret, Sheena and Alex. His granddaughter Wendy joined the RAF in 1991 and is still serving today (2022).\n\n“In June 1944, my Mother Mary was six months pregnant with me. Safe at home on her parents’ farm in Scotland her world was shattered on 22nd June by the arrival of a telegram advising that my Dad was missing following operations on the night of 21st June. The thought that he may never return nor see his first child must have been devastating. On 23rd June however, a second telegram arrived bearing the joyful news that Dad had been safely rescued at sea.\n\nI arrived on 1st December, 1944 and it was several months before we met due to his continuing wartime service. From the time that he was demobbed until his death in 1980 we enjoyed a loving and special father and daughter relationship. He was indeed a remarkable man and he taught me much about the natural world, patience and kinship.” Margaret Rothery née Martin\n\n“My Dad was my hero. Not because he was a war hero, just because he was my Dad. He WAS a DFC, MiD, Goldfish Club war hero, but we heard little about that growing up as, like so many other survivors, he didn’t talk much about his wartime service. However, I knew there was something important about him, that he had a medal – once, when I was about 9 or 10, I “borrowed” his DFC & took it to school for show & tell, but didn’t tell anyone. Of course, my mother chose that day to clean the china cabinet ………. !\n\nGrowing up, he was just like every other good dad – our mentor, our teacher. He taught me about the night sky, without me realising at the time that was how he had navigated his Lancaster Bombers. He once got me up, again in the night, to see the Northern Lights on a rare occasion they were visible where we lived.\n\nMy dad passed away when I was 26 & pregnant with my first child, so he never met my children. But I KNOW he has watched over them. My first born regaled us with tales of his “dreams” until he was in his early teens. In those dreams, my father came to play with him & took him in his plane, showed him his navigator’s station (and my son described it in accurate detail, which even I didn’t fully appreciate until I saw it for myself in Just Jane some 30 years later).\n\nTo us he was, and will always remain, quite simply our much loved, always missed, ever-present hero dad.” Sheena Cowan née Martin\n\n“I arrived in 1964 when my dad was 50! I only had him in my life for a very short 16 years…never had him walk me down the aisle. So my memories of my hero my dad are short and limited however he was the most lovely caring softly spoken Scotsman that I will never forget.” Alex Martin\n\n“I was just 12 when my Grandfather died in 1980, but was fortunate enough to be present with my parents the previous year at East Kirkby at the inaugural gathering of the 57/630 Squadrons Association when he was reunited with the other 6 members of his crew. I recall there was a lot of laughter that weekend as memories were recounted and stories told of derring do. Although I did not know then that I would join the RAF some years later, I remember thinking what a marvellous organisation it must be! The horrors that my Grandfather’s Crew endured would only become apparent many years later as I researched their 32 operational missions. The stories my Grandfather told undoubtedly left their mark and provided the inspiration for me to follow in his footsteps and join the RAF, and here I am more than 30 years later. I have been attending the annual 57 and 630 Squadron Association reunions annually since 2010 and have been fortunate to have met many of the men and women who served at East Kirkby at the same time as my Grandfather: heroes one and all. Per Ardua ad Astra.” Air Commodore Wendy Rothery\n\nTerry Heighton by his son, Chris\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015, I was fortunate to work as part of the development team that established the International Bomber Command Centre, where I led the commissioning process for the Spire. Without doubt, something I was incredibly proud to be part of, and one of the most rewarding and memorable projects I’ve ever worked on.\n\nIn 2019, I re-visited the IBCC with my Dad, who at the time, was really quite seriously ill, and with a terminal diagnosis. We had always planned to visit the centre, and particularly the Spire, as it was something that Dad always wanted to experience for himself – Not least because of my connection to the project, as this was something we talked about a great deal, but also because of our shared love of all thing’s aviation, and particularly historic aircraft. Indeed, it was through talking about Bomber Command, the IBCC, my role in the project, and generally being two plane spotters, that we were able to find common ground between us, as we were quite different people, with different interests, and who followed vastly different career paths, yet we created some unbeatable father and son moments, that I am now in the process of repeating with my own son, who thankfully, also has the aviation genes!\n\nOn the day of our visit, Dad was now completely wheelchair bound, with oxygen cylinders, which presented some logistical challenges, however nothing insurmountable. Having explored the exhibition, we discovered the digital archive station in the foyer, and although I hadn’t come across a ‘Heighton’ or distant relative within the losses database in all the time I worked on the project, Dad was adamant that we should search anyway – His illness certainly hadn’t affected his stubbornness! To our amazement, we discovered Sgt. Hubert Heighton, who was a pilot, stationed at RAF Leeming with 10 Squadron, and who flew the Armstrong Whitely V Bomber.\n\nOn the night of 15th /16th May 1941, the Whitely V crews were one of a number of 10 Squadron crews tasked with bombing Hannover. They took off from RAF Leeming at 2217 and bombed the target area from 14,000 feet at 0117. Hubert’s Whitely V was attacked by an enemy aircraft at around the same time, however the crew fired a red signal flare and the enemy aircraft broke off its attack. The searchlights in which the aircraft was being held, were switched off. The crew were able to make a safe return to base at 0445 and a number of bullet holes were found in the aircraft.\n\nLater that summer, on the evening of 7th/8th July 1941, Hubert, Sergeant Harris Black, Flight Sergeant Robert Thompson, and Flight Sergeant Owen Lucas, were flying back to Leeming in Whitely Z6816 from operations in Osnabrück, and according to the records I’ve discovered, the Whitely V unexpectedly crashed into the North Sea, off Flamborough Head, with no survivors and their bodies were never recovered.\n\nThe events that led up to the crash remain a mystery, certainly to me, yet this is a story that I have continued to explore and pursue, and one that continues to twist and turn, as it unravels.\n\nDad and I were speechless at our discovery, and proceeded through the doors, along the Ribbon of Remembrance to the foot of the Spire, where I turned Dad’s wheelchair to face the iconic view of the city, that we had talked about so many times. Dad was overwhelmed and overcome with emotion in a way that I have never seen before, which was quite remarkable, and he insisted on standing, or at least trying to stand by himself, to pay his respects to all who served. As he said himself, ‘I simply cannot be here, right now, with you, and stay sat down’. It was a huge effort for him, and took every last bit of energy that he had, but he managed to do it, and largely by himself.\n\nWe stood together in the silence for what felt like hours, until I noticed that Dad was really struggling and about to fall, so we quickly moved the wheelchair back into place, and we began to walk through the Walls of Names, talking about who these people might have been, the families they left behind, and whether their ancestors even know about their sacrifice?\n\nWe slowly walked around to Panel 45 and found Hubert, which was quite a moving experience for both of us, where we placed a poppy by his name, as so many families do throughout the year. Over lunch in the café, we talked for hours about the Chadwick Centre, the Spire, a very nerdy discussion about aircraft, and the Spire opening ceremony, including the now famous flypast from the Vulcan that caught the sun exactly at the right moment to create a shining Avro Delta Wing over the Spire -Something really quite incredible, that I will never forget.\n\nSadly, our day together at the IBCC would prove to be the last day we spent together, as my Dad passed away shortly afterwards.\n\nMy Mum and I are both IBCC annual pass holders, and each year, on the anniversary of Dad’s passing, we meet at the IBCC and sit on the benches looking out to the Spire, to remember and celebrate Dad’s life.\n\nOur stone on the Ribbon of Remembrance is absolutely dedicated to Dad’s love of aviation, and indeed of the Spire, to create a space that we as a family can continue to return to, and hopefully, where Dad’s great grandchildren, can do the same, long into the future. However, it also captures, and preserves the stories of that remarkable day of discovery we spent together, Hubert Heighton’s story, the importance of the IBCC to our family, and to ensure these stories remain alive and kicking, and in the hearts of future generations of Heightons.\n\nFor me, I’ve been inspired to embark on a new writing project to tell mine, Dad’s and Hubert’s story, and how, in the most unlikely of circumstances, we were able to forge a now unbreakable bond, across generations of our family.\n\nIn many respects, my connection with the IBCC, after nearly 10 years since I first joined the project, has now come full circle.\n\nTo find out about Hubert Heighton, click here\n\nF/O RAFVR in 78 Squadron, Group 4\n\nOn the night of July 29/30th 1943 a force of 757 aircraft left Bomber Command airfields in England to attack the port of Hamburg in Germany. The force was made up of 340 Lancasters – 224 Halifaxes – 119 Stirlings – 70 Wellingtons and 4 Mosquito Pathfinders. The mission was recorded as being successful. The losses suffered by the attacking force totalled 28 aircraft, 11 Lancasters – 11 Halifaxes – 4 Stirlings and 2 Wellingtons.\n\nMy late brother, 131566 Flying Officer K Wilson who was a Flying Officer RAFVR in 78 Squadron 4 Group Bomber Command, was flying as Navigator in Halifax JD 252 which was one of the Halifaxes that did not return from the raid. On the 30th of July 1943 a body was recovered from the sea near Bridlington by the Air Sea Rescue Services and was later identified as that of the W/O of Halifax JD 252 – 1111494 Sgt G.M Gibb who after identification was buried in Driffield Cemetery with full Military Honours on the 4th of August 1943 – Military Marker Grace 6227 – I have visited his grave and placed a floral tribute on it. The other six crew members of Halifax JD 252 were not found and it was assumed they lost their lives at sea and their names are commemorated on the panels at the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede.\n\nWhen WWII ended in 1945 the MOD imposed a 30 year rule which prevented any research into missions flown by the RAF over enemy territory being undertaken which resulted in my Mother and Father going to their graves not knowing the fate of my brother ( the navigator of Halifax JD 252 ).\n\nAfter the declassification of the missions flown by the RAF during WWII was activated in 1975 I decided to carry out research into the steps that my brother has taken from joining the RAF as a VR in 1939 until the loss of his aircraft Halifax JD 252 on the 29-30th of July 1943. I did not carry out my research with the intention of writing a book but it was to try and find out what happened to my brother 131566 Flying Officer Kenneth Wilson who was the navigator of Halifax JD 252. After the aircraft had been reported missing as both our parents had gone to their graves not knowing what had happened to the Official Secrets Act etc. It was ex RAF personnel who had read my research documents who persuaded me to try and turn my research and documents into a colour illustrated book (entitled No Known Grave) to record for future generations what it was like for a family to receive the so called “Dreaded telegram” during WWII and who have a loved one with no known grave as a result of the conflict.\n\nAt the time that I wrote the manuscript for the book people did not have computers and I did not have a typewriter or any experience in the field of writing so my manuscript was written with a pen on paper which I then sent to a professional firm to be printed as a manuscript before going to be published.\n\nIf I could have foreseen that when the book eventually published Her Majesty the Queen (the head of the three Armed Forces) – Dame Vera Lynn – David Jason etc would read it then I don’t think that I would have attempted to write it however some good has come out of it as I have received several letters from people in our country and countries abroad who have read the first issue of my book and who were asking if I could research the loss of their loved ones who sacrificed their lives whilst serving in the RAF to find out if their fallen loved ones have a Military Marker Grave as they have been unsuccessful in their efforts in doing so. I have been able to trace the final resting place of several of their loved ones and therefore I feel that I have been able to do for them that no one could do for my Mother and Father due to the war time restrictions etc. Although I have done these researches voluntarily they are very rewarding as I am in receipt of letters from them containing photographs of them standing by the Marker Grave that I have managed to trace for them also it has helped to keep my mind active in my old age.\n\nFinally, I am in the process of writing an updated version of my book which contains many more photographs – documents – Her Majesty the Queens letter – Dame Vera Lynn’s two letter etc. If all goes well and the second edition is published I will forward a copy to you for the archives. The first edition, which sold out, raised much money for charity.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nJohn Wilson (RAF Veteran)\n\n78 Squadron Halifax II JD252 EY-W Sgt. Peter Snape Hamburg, July 1943\n\nOperation: Hamburg, Germany.\n\nDate: 29/30th July 1943 (Thursday/Friday)\n\nUnit: No. 78 Squadron\n\nType: Halifax II\n\nSerial: JD252\n\nCode: EY-W\n\nBase: RAF Breighton, Yorkshire\n\nLocation: North Sea\n\nREASON FOR LOSS:\n\nTook off at 22.30 hrs from RAF Breighton, Yorkshire to bomb the port and city of Hamburg joining 776 other aircraft on the third raid on this target within the last five days. 340 Lancasters, 244 Halifaxes, 119 Stirlings, 70 Wellingtons and 4 Mosquitoes made up the force.\n\nThe idea was that the target be approached from the north to concentrate on the northern area of Hamburg which had not been bombed on previous occasions. The pathfinders dropped their markers too far east of the city. 707 aircraft got through to the target, dropping a total of 2,318 tons of bombs on residential areas – no figures are available as to the casualties on the ground for this raid although it is known that over 40,000 were killed during that week and over 16,000 residential buildings were destroyed.\n\nThe worst incident was when bombs hit a large department store in Wandsbek – the building collapsed and blocked exits from a shelter that was in the basement – 370 people died from poisoning by the fumes from a coke store nearby. An amazing 1,200,000 people fled the city after these raids.\n\nThe allies lost 31 aircraft on this operation with 176 aircrew losing their lives and a further 17 being made pow. Most of the aircraft were shot down by the Luftwaffe night fighters, although 14 were shot down by searchlight assisted flak over the target area.\n\nNo details or claims have been made for this loss. Another 78 Squadron was also lost on this operation:\n\nHalifax II JB798 EY-P Flown by Fl/Sgt. Peter A. Fraser RAAF who along with his 6 other crew members were all killed and buried in Hamburg.\n\nSome publications have the Bomb Aimer listed incorrectly as F/O. C.E. Burns.\n\nAll but one of the crew are commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial (panel numbers below). Sgt.

Mackenzie – ‘Nightfighter War Diaries Vol’s. 1 and 2’, Martin Middlebrook and Chris Everitt – ‘Bomber Command War Diaries’, Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nWing Commander A L Christian MiD* RAF – 1906 – 1941\n\nArnold Louis Christian was born in Hove, grew up in Birkenhead where his family operated their business, and educated as a boarder at Ruthin Public School, (founded in 1284 almost 150 years before Eton College).\n\nAfter gaining Higher School Certificate he began work in the family business and, in 1929, went to Newcastle Upon Tyne to open a new branch of the business. There, two significant life events occurred. He met the girl who was to become his wife and he entered a newspaper competition winning first prize – a half hour flying lesson. Smitten by both, he left the business – much to the annoyance of the family – and was commissioned into the RAF in October 1930.\n\nUpon completion of flying training at No 3 FTS, (Flying Training School), RAF Grantham, he was posted to No 54 Squadron, RAF Hornchurch. As a member of 54 Sqn he participated in the famous Hendon Air Displays, hugely popular in the 1930’s, was married, and two of his three children were born, (both boys, they too were to join the RAF, followed by two of his grandsons).\n\nNow a Flight Lieutenant, he was posted, unaccompanied, for eight months over 1935-36 to Ed Damer and Atbara in the British Protectorate of Sudan. On return it was to 218 (Bomber) Squadron, RAF Upper Heyford, and selection for instructor training at CFS, (Central Flying School), RAF Upavon. On the evening of 28th June 1937, whilst in the station cinema, a message was flashed onto the screen – ‘F/L Christian you have a baby daughter’ – home at Upper Heyford, his third child had been born. From CFS it was briefly to No 6 FTS, RAF Netheravon, and then on to No 5 FTS, RAF Sealand, as a flying instructor.\n\nPromoted Squadron Leader on 21 November 1938, there then followed 10 months at RAF Debden before a posting to RAF Bicester. Briefly to No 108 Sqn and then No 104 Sqn as Commander of ‘B’ Flight. Both squadrons operated the Bristol Blenheim light bomber.\n\nOn 25th October 1939, as second pilot/navigator to Major Jim Cordes, chief test pilot for Handley Page, he flew on the maiden flight from Bicester of their new heavy bomber the ‘Halifax’. In April 1940, 104 & 108 merged to form No 13 OTU, (Operational Training Unit), where he served as a Flying Instructor.\n\nOn 24th November 1940 it was to 105 Sqn, ( No 2 Group, Bomber Command), RAF Swanton Morley. Stuart R Scott, in his book Battle-Axe Blenheims No 105 Squadron at war 1940-1, records ‘Well known to many of the crews as an instructor, S/L Arnold Christian had arrived to become Flight Commander of ‘B’ Flight, and was ultimately to prove a very popular CO’.\n\nOne month later, on Christmas Eve, he was promoted Wing Commander and became the squadron’s commanding officer.\n\nAt this time the squadron was engaged largely on night operations against various industrial targets, and specific oil refineries, and these continued into 1941. On 4th February, he led the squadron to attack docks at Ostend, Dunkirk and Dieppe and also on several airfields in Northern France. All targets were successfully attacked without loss.\n\nOn 30th March, lifting off at 20.18 hours as part of a much larger mixed force, he led 5 Blenheims, from RAF St. Eval, Cornwall, to attack the port of Brest where the German battlecruisers, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, responsible for inflicting huge losses on British shipping, were docked. All bombs were delivered in the target area and all crews survived the attack. So too did the enemy ships!\n\nOn the 9th April the squadron received orders to convert to daytime operations and on the 13th the daylight anti-shipping role began. The task for No 2 Group and its Blenheim squadrons was to seal the North Sea to enemy shipping.\n\nThe crews now had to learn a new skill and Arnold Christian was hugely instrumental in this, as remembered by S/L David Bennett, who paid tribute in 2 Group RAF by Michael J.F. Bowyer:\n\n‘Arnold Christian, an A1 Category CFS (Central Flying School) instructor, could fly a Blenheim better than most and inspired us all with his skill and leadership. He had been responsible for our rapid conversion from night bombing to daylight low-level operations in April 1941. Training was intense as Christian encouraged us to fly accurately over the sea at 50ft and lower. ‘The lower the better’, were his words, and ‘effective jinking manoeuvres near the deck (sea level) can get you out of trouble in the target area’. He was right. A Blenheim could be thrown around, and his example inspired us all. Our squadron commander was a stubborn never-say-die character with inborn leadership of a somewhat rebellious nature, traits possessed by so many 2 Group squadron commanders’.\n\n‘Beat’ areas were established along coasts from southern Norway to the Low Countries and these were the Blenheim’s new hunting grounds. Blenheim squadrons of 2 Group were detached, in around two weeks rotation, to RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, to operate Norwegian coastal beats. On 5th May, 1941, it was the turn of 105 Sqn. 17 Blenheims moved from Swanton Morley to Lossiemouth for their rotational stint.\n\nAt 05.10 hours on Thursday, 8th May 1941, in Blenheim V5828:R, Wg Cdr Arnold Christian and his crew, F/Sgt Harold Frederick ‘Andy’ Hancock (Observer) and Sgt G. Wade (Wireless Op/Air Gunner), lifted off leading 5 other aircraft and headed for the beat 2 area off the Norwegian coast at Stavanger.\n\nAs recorded in Battle-Axe Blenheims by Stuart R. Scott, four of the aircraft saw no shipping and returned to base. Aircraft T2118:E (P/O Buckley) was at No 2 position (on the right) of the CO’s aircraft when, as further recorded, a convoy of twenty vessels appeared at the entrance to Hafrsfjord, west of Stavanger. Two merchant ships were singled out one a merchantman, the other identified as an 800-ton flak ship. When the first merchant vessel was last seen, it was down by the stern, billowing smoke high into the air. During his run-in for a beam attack on the flak ship, P/O Buckley realised that W/C Arnold Christian and his crew, had not re-appeared on his port side. Their Blenheim was last seen with the port engine on fire.\n\nHerr Leidland, a fisherman, saw the aircraft crash into the water, and he later retrieved a flying boot from the sea; it contained a leather tag with F/Sgt Hancock’s name on it. They had crashed south of the entrance to Hardangerfjorden, north of Stavanger.\n\nThe loss of the CO hit squadron morale very badly, and was well remembered by the then S/L David Bennett who paid the following tribute also in Bowyer’s 2 Group RAF, Arnold’s sense of fun and his good, dry humour, added to his superb airmanship, made 105 a good squadron!\n\nPhotograph: Battle-Axe Blenheims – Stuart R Scott\n\nFrom Battle-Axe Blenheims, Sgt Geoffrey Rowland (WOp/AG) commented W/C Arnold Christian was one of the finest COs one could wish to serve under, and Sgt Wood (Pilot), we all remembered Arnold Christian joining in with the boys, playing rugger with the adjutant’s hat.\n\nThe above is the briefest story of a husband, a father, a regular officer in the RAF. More than that, it is also the story of so many Bomber Command aircrew – 55,000 – who lost their lives in WW2. Stuart Scott sums it up well in the introduction to his book, Battle-Axe Blenheims. ‘The Blenheim crews suffered grievous losses throughout the war, but their resolve, their firm belief in the right of their tasks, and their absolute belief in their leadership, remained unswayed’.\n\n105 Squadron’s motto Fortis in Proeliis translates as ‘Valiant in Battles’\n\nThere can be no more fitting epitaph for a Blenheim crew.\n\nTo order your stone and preserve the memory of your loved one click here\n\nBernard ‘Pop’ Green.\n\nThere was the start of the forest, but in between was open ground covered in snow. Thirty-two pairs of feet had left the exit to ‘Tunnel Harry’ and made the dash to the woods, when it was Bernard’s turn.\n\nA miscalculation meant the tunnel exit had come up short by about ten feet, and was just beyond the perimeter fence. Bernard was the thirty- third person to leave the tunnel, and at the age of fifty-six, the oldest of the seventy-six that would escape that night, in what became known as ‘The Great Escape’.\n\nBernard was born in Bourne End Bucks in December 1887, and between 1903 and the start of the First World War, he served as a sapper in the 2nd Gloucestershire Royal Engineer Volunteers, the London Electrical Engineers and finally in the TA with the Royal East Kent Yeomanry.\n\nThis all took place whilst studying at Clifton College Bristol and reading Theology at Trinity College Cambridge.\n\nOn the 24th June 1914 he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in Buckinghamshire Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. By 1915 he was serving in France and Belgium, when he was wounded by a German rifle grenade fragment at Ploogsteert and was sent back to England to recuperate. On his return to France, he was promoted and seconded to different Machine Group Corps.\n\nIn 1916 he attended various Lewis and Vickers Gun courses both in France and England, where he met Johnny Dodge, who many years later, would also become a POW at Stalag Luft 3, and a fellow escaper. On the first day of the Battle for the Somme, he was promoted to Captain, but again had to return to England to attended a course, and whilst home on his 29th birthday, he married Kathleen Dorothea Connell.\n\nAt the beginning of 1917 he was Mentioned in Dispatches for action at the Somme and then fought at Passchendaele. By 1918 he had further promotion to Major and the award of a Military Cross in the King’s Birthday Honours List. In October, just one month before the Armistice, he was severely wounded in his heel, from either a bullet or shrapnel.\n\nHe returned to England for recovery and was given £120 compensation for his injuries.\n\nAfter the war, Bernard and his wife started a family, his son was born in 1919, followed by a daughter in 1921. He worked at the family Paper Mill which he ran with his Brother-in-Law. He fulfilled many roles including Managing Director and Senior Sales Representative, which gave him the chance to travel through Europe sourcing raw materials.\n\nWith the Second World War looming, in December 1939 Bernard joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve, he was 52 years old. He attended the Air Gunnery Course at RAF Aldergrove and was awarded his brevet. Following this he was posted to No 44 Sqn flying the Hampden out of RAF Waddington, with the rank of Pilot Officer on Probation.\n\nOn the 20th July 1940, Bernard was on his first mission, which was a ‘Gardening’ sortie to Frederikshavn, basically laying sea mines which had the codeword ‘Vegetables’, in the busy shipping lanes. The four-man crew consisted of the pilot Sgt Edward Farrands, Sgt Percy Nixon the observer, Sgt Reg Miller the second air gunner, plus Bernard in the rear turret. Their Hampden L4087 took a direct hit from flax, which was protecting the port of Frederikshavn. Edward announced he would have to ditch in Tannis Bay, as a fire was spreading across one of the wings, and sections of it were falling from the aircraft.\n\nThe belly of the plane hit the sea and part of the starboard fuselage was torn away. Bernard threw himself through the hole and surfaced next to the sinking plane. Floating next to him was the dead body of Sgt Nixon, whose neck appeared broken by the force of the impact. Bernard was a strong swimmer and swam towards the roaring surf that was breaking against the shoreline and dragged himself onto the beach. Within a few hours he would find himself in a Police Station at Skagen in Denmark, where he was handed over to the Germans and would spend the rest of the war as a prisoner.\n\nBernard was taken by train to Dulag Luft near Frankfurt am Main. This was a reception camp before prisoners were transferred elsewhere. It was here he heard the news that Sgt Farrands had survived the crash, but like Bernard, he was caught by the Danish Police, having broken into a summer villa. The bodies of Nixon and Miller were washed up on the beach and they were buried in the cemetery at Skagen.\n\nBetween 1941-1942 Bernard found himself promoted twice, eventually obtaining the rank of Flight Lieutenant. He was subject to various transfers between POW camps, including Stalag Luft II in Littmannstadt Poland, Stalag Luft I Barth Germany, a short visit to Stalag Luft III near Sagan and then Offlag XXI B, Schubin Poland.\n\nBy 1943 Bernard was back at Stalag Luft III to fulfil his destiny of becoming one of the ‘Great Escapers’. Bernard was known as ‘Pop’ this probably referred to his age, being one of the older prisoners, or it could have derived from when he was Pilot Officer on Probation. At Stalag Luft III, his role in the building of ‘Tunnel Harry’ was to be a ‘Penguin’.\n\nHe carried special pouches down his trouser legs, and walked around the compound dispersing earth that had been removed from the tunnel.\n\nHis escape on that cold winter’s night in March 1944 was short lived, he gathered with twelve other prisoners, all dressed as Czech workmen. They made their way to a railway station south of Sagan, boarded a train for about fifty miles, before alighting near Hirschberg. As he approached a village he was forced to walk straight through the centre, because the surrounding fields were covered in deep snow, so he couldn’t bypass the village. He was captured by a German soldier and returned to Stalag Luft III, where he spent 14 days in the cooler.\n\nOf the original seventy-six to escape, three managed to make ‘home runs’, one landed in England, two managed to seek refuge in Sweden. On Hitler’s orders fifty of the escapees were executed, they were chosen from different nationalities to send a chilling message back to the camps.\n\nBy 1945 the Germans started to evacuate the POW camps in the East, as the Soviet Army advanced. Bernard and the fellow inmates were forced marched, half starving and inadequately dressed in atrocious winter conditions, with heavy snowfalls and sub-zero temperatures, back into Germany. Many suffered from exhaustion and exposure to the weather, and were shot by their captors where they fell.\n\nThey were finally liberated from a camp, on the 2nd May 1945 near Lübeck, by the 11th Armoured Division British Army. On the 7th January 1947 Bernard was Mentioned in Despatches for his part in the Great Escape.\n\nAfter the war Bernard remarried following the death of his first wife and ran a taxi business in Chichester. In 1963 he attended the Premiere of ‘The Great Escape’ at the Odeon Leicester Square, to benefit the Royal Air Force Association and the RAF Escaping Society.\n\nBernard died on the 2nd November 1971 aged 83 years old.\n\nTo order your stone and preserve the memory of your loved one click here\n\nAt the very end of the path that leads to the Memorial Walls, on the left hand side, there is a large Stone dedicated to all the Australian Air Force members who served in Bomber Command during WW2. Australian aircrew were trained in Australia, Canada and Rhodesia under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), before they arrived in the UK to serve in Bomber Command. The first ground instruction and flying schools opened in Australia in 1940 and by March 1941 the graduates were joining the UK based Squadrons.\n\nApproximately 10,000 Royal Australian Air Force personnel served with Bomber Command and 3,486 were killed, 650 died in training accidents and 1500 became Prisoners of War. Many served on the eight RAAF Bomber Command Squadrons, namely 455, 458, 460, 462, 463, 464, 466 and 467 Squadron.\n\nThe first two Australian Squadrons formed were No 455 Sqn in June and No 458 Sqn in September 1941. By the end of 1941 both were flying regular missions against Germany. Although the Australian Government wanted to consolidate their airmen into RAAF units, there was never an Australian Bomber Command Group, compared to the likes of No 6 (Canadian) Group. Even the Australian Squadrons often had a small number of Australians on them, as the men tended to form into crews at the Operational Training Units, without regard for nationality, and didn’t wish to be broken up when they eventually arrived on the Squadrons. Some Commanders favored mixed nationality crews, so we find many Australians serving in various Squadrons throughout Bomber Command.\n\nThe arrival of No 460 Sqn RAAF to RAF Binbrook in spring 1943, caused quite a stir. The Squadron was transferring from RAF Breighton and the groundcrew were given the options of traveling by train or being transported in Horsa gilders, over 800 of them chose to travel by Horsa. Their different uniforms and accents also caused problems, with one local schoolboy running home to his parents and declaring the Germans had arrived! During the next two years of the war, 460 Sqn suffered some of the highest casualty rates in Bomber Command.\n\nDepicted on the Stone is the badge of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian War Memorial which is in Campbell, a suburb in the capital Canberra. This Memorial was unveiled on the 11th November 1941 and holds the Rolls of Honour which commemorates over 102,000 members of the Australian Armed Forces who have died during War Service, and since 1945, those killed in Wars and certain Peacetime Operations. The Tomb of the Australian Unknown Soldier is located here, along with an extensive National Military Museum.\n\nTowards the bottom of the Stone, we have an inscription from a letter written by Fg Off Colin Kelvin Flockhart who served on No 619 Sqn. Colin was born on the 1st February 1924 in Ashfield NSW. He attended school in Sydney, completed his accountancy studies before gaining employment with the Commonwealth Bank. When old enough he joined the RAAF and qualified as a pilot in 1942. After completing his flying course, he was sent to Canada for further training before arriving in England. He converted onto the Lancaster and was posted to No 619 Sqn based at RAF Strubby here in Lincolnshire. On the 1st December 1944 Colin wrote a three page letter to his parents to be delivered in the event of his death. He described how he was happy in the RAAF, his belief in what he was doing, his faith in God and his appreciation of his family.\n\nI have been very proud to wear my uniform, keep smiling although your hearts are breaking.\n\nThese words were extracts from his letter home, a letter that would soon be delivered to his parents in Earlwood NSW. On the 7th January 1945 Flockhart and his crew were detailed to take part on a raid on München. Flying in Lancaster ND957 PG-M, they were returning from the target in bad weather and reduced visibility, when their aircraft disintegrated over St Pierre in France. It is thought a possibly collision occurred with a 49 Sqn Lancaster PB586, also returning from München. That accident caused the death of three Australians, FS Eric Smith from Sydney was Colin’s Wireless Op on ND957, and WO Frederick Miller from Canberra was the Wireless Op on the 49 Sqn aircraft. Those on board both aircraft were laid to rest in Villeneuve St Georges Old Communal Cemetery 18 Km South East of Paris. Fg Off Colin Flockhart was just 20 years old at the time of his death.\n\nIt wasn’t just the aircrew who made the ultimate sacrifice, Sgt Laurence Parker was born in Bundaberg, Queensland. He served as groundcrew on No 467 Sqn based at RAF Waddington. Most aircraft had nose art which depicted how many raids an aircraft and crew had completed. The nose art was normally a bomb, but Sgt Parker suggested using beer mugs to record the event, and painted these onto the aircraft he serviced. On the 4th December 1943 Laurence was killed when a Lancaster JB140 crashed on takeoff after two engines failed. The aircraft swung violently, leaving the runway before the pilot managed to get it under semi control. Unfortunately, it hit a parked No 61 Sqn Lancaster before crashing into Sgt Parker and a Sgt Hobba. Ironically Laurence was killed by an aircraft he serviced himself, whilst Sgt Hobba survived with slight injuries. The following day FS Cecil Frizzell the Air Gunner on JB140, who hailed from Queensland, succumbed to his injuries.\n\nThe bravery, gallantry and sacrifices of all those who served in the RAAF in Bomber Command during the war is reflected in the medals awarded to Australian personnel. 2 Victoria Crosses, 62 Distinguished Service Orders, 1 Military Cross, 1609 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 3 Air Force Crosses, 1 Distinguished Conduct Medal, 6 Conspicuous Gallantry Medals, 1 Military Medal, 297 Distinguished Flying Medals and 3 Air Forces Medals.\n\nSgt E A Hall (462) – 10 Squadron\n\nOne of the pleasures of being a Volunteer Tour Guide at the IBCC is the chance to meet and chat with veterans or their relatives. One day whilst guiding I got chatting with David Hall and his twin sister Carol who were visiting the Centre. As we walked up the Ribbons Of Remembrance they stopped to show me a Stone they had laid in memory of their father, a father they hardly got to know, they were just 15 months old when he was killed in Norway.\n\nTirpitz was the second of the Bismarck Class Battleships built for the German Navy. Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz it was armed with a battery of eight (15 inch) guns, housed in four twin turrets. In early 1942, the Tirpitz sailed to Norway acting as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. Whilst stationed in Norway, the ship was intended to be used to intercept the Arctic Convoys heading to Russia. Tirpitz was Churchill’s nemesis, it was a formidable ship and it would take a formidable effort to destroy it.\n\nIn between October 1940 and November 1944, 26 Operations were mounted to destroy Tirpitz. During ‘Operation Title’ they used two Chariot Manned Torpedoes, but mechanical failure stopped the attempt, whilst in ‘Operation Source’ four Midget Submarines were deployed, which did manage to cause extensive damage. Finally on the 12th November 1944, Operation Catechism saw 32 Lancasters attack the ship at Tromsø, eventually causing it to capsize after three direct hits.\n\nOn the 30th March 1942 No 4 Group mounted an attack on Tirpitz using Halifax aircraft picked from 10 Sqn, 35 Sqn and 76 Sqn, operating at forward bases at Lossiemouth, Kinloss and Tain in Scotland. The raid consisted of 12 aircraft each from 76 Sqn and 35 Sqn, with 10 aircraft getting airborne from 10 Sqn. The total distance to the target and return to base would be 1300 miles with a flight time of 8 hrs 30 mins, the raid was planned in two phases with 76 Sqn dropping 4000 lb HC bombs. Phase 2 would see 10 Sqn and 35 Sqn flying into Faettenfjord at 600 feet carrying Mines and Incendiaries. On reaching the Norwegian coast the weather was clear with bright moonlight, but on arriving in the Trondheim area sea fog and 10/10 cloud were obscuring the target. Tirpitz was moored next to a cliff making an air attack more difficult, cut down trees were laid over the deck as camouflage, and if need be, Tirpitz could create clouds of artificial fog by mixing water with chlorosulfuric acid. Many of the aircraft had to jettison their bombs on searchlight and flax batteries, and because of the sea fog and haze, it was difficult to make any damage assessments.\n\nIn nearby Hemnefjord the local people could hear aircraft en route to and from Faettenfjord. A young man witnessed an aircraft flying erratically and descending, as it passed over a small island called Sørfuglan there was an explosion onboard and the aircraft crashed. It is possible the aircraft was hit by German Anti Aircraft guns at nearby Hemnskjel.\n\nThe following morning people found debris and dead fish around the fjord carried by the currents, this could be from W1043 ZA-F, although nearby another Halifax from 10 Sqn had also crashed, that was W1044 ZA-D.\n\nFour days after the crash of W1043, the body of the Sqn Ldr Frederick Webster was washed up near the Lighthouse at Terningen. No remains of the other six crew were ever found. On the 8th April 1942 Sqn Ldr Webster was buried at Trondheim Stavne Cemetery along with four airmen from 35 Sqn, who had perished when their two Halifax aircraft were shot down. Three bodies were recovered from the crash of W1044 and initially buried in a local cemetery at Heim before being moved to Trondheim Stavne Cemetery after the war.\n\nIn 2005 David Hall travelled to Norway to visit the crash site where his father perished. He was accompanied by Wynne Hines the sister of the Air Gunner Plt Off Sam Leney, who was 22 years old at the time of his death. During the visit they went out by boat to the spot between Sørfuglan and Jamtøya where it is believed Halifax W1043 came down. David placed a wreath in the water as they paid their respects to the airmen who lost their lives that day. A dram of whisky was also poured into the fjord. At last David and Wynne had the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. Whilst in Norway they also went to Stavne Cemetery to visit the grave of Sqn Ldr Webster, the only crew member recovered from the crash. The remaining crew are honoured on the Runnymede Memorial for all those airmen who have no known grave.\n\nSix of the thirty-four aircraft that took off failed to return.\n\nTo order your stone and preserve the memory of your loved one click here\n\nFrom 10 Squadron:\n\nW1043 flown by Sqn Ldr Webster and W1044 flown by Plt Off Blunden.\n\nCrew Of W1043 ZA-F\n\nSqn Ldr Frederick David Webster DFC Age 29 Pilot\n\nSgt Eric Archibald Hall Age 30 Pilot\n\nFlt Lt Audrey Charles Stevens-Fox Observer\n\nPlt Off Samuel Robert Leney Age 22 Air Gunner\n\nFS Harold Sydney Wheatley Age 24 Flight Engineer\n\nSgt Walter Hall Age 27 Air Gunner\n\nSgt Arnold Hague WOp/AG\n\nFrom 35 Squadron:\n\nR9438 flown by FS Bushby, this aircraft had made it back over the North Sea almost to Shetland from the Tirpitz, but crashed in to cliffs at Fitful Head on Shetland killing all the crew.\n\nR9496 flown by FS Archibald and W1015 flown by FS Steinhauer both crashed in Norway.\n\n76 Squadron:\n\nR9453 flown by Sqn Ldr Burnett was last heard from en route back to base passing over Sumburgh and are believed to have ditched in the sea somewhere off Sumburgh Head.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Halifax force, little or no effective damage had been inflicted on Tirpitz during the 30th March 1942 attack.\n\nSgt Eric Archibald Hall\n\nLancaster PD268 SR-O\n\nOn the 7th March 1945 at 1708hrs, Lancaster PD268 of 101 Squadron lifted off from RAF Ludford Magna in the Lincolnshire Wolds. A total of 23 Lancasters would depart Ludford Magna that evening to support the raid. The target was the Junker’s Aircraft Factory at Dessau and they were part of a large bomber stream consisting of 526 Lancasters and 5 Mosquitoes. 18 Lancasters, which was 3.4 Percent of the force failed to return, including the crew of PD268. They were the only crew not to return safely to Ludford Magna in the early hours of the following morning, nothing was heard from them after taking off.\n\nAt the controls that evening was Sqn Ldr Montgomery Gibbon AFC and next to him, was WO Ivor Bond the Flight Engineer. He would be assisting the pilot with fuel calculations, monitoring the engines and hydraulic pressures, and ready to carry out immediate action drills in the case of engine failure or fires. Down in the nose of the aircraft, Sgt William Canning the Bomb Aimer, would be busying himself checking his switch selections and bomb-sight, ready to direct the pilot onto the target as they approached Dessau.\n\nMeanwhile the Navigator Fg Off Roy Gawthorp would be updating their track towards the target with the latest winds which he received from the Wireless Operator Sgt Leslie Tyrrell. All the time the Air Gunners Sgt Alfred Matthews and Sgt Charles Preston would be scanning the horizon for German Nightfighters trying to infiltrate the Bomber Stream. Seven would be the normal complement of a Lancaster, but this was an ABC Lancaster, also known by the codeword ‘Airborne Cigar’, so this carried an extra crew member.\n\nHuddled over the glow coming from a Cathode Ray Tube was Plt Off Rudolph Mahr a Canadian from Winnipeg. Rudolph or ‘Rudy’, was a Russian Jew born in 1926, his Russian father was John and Anna his mother was from Germany. They left Russia and travelled to Canada arriving by ship in 1936 and took Canadian Citizenship. As the war progressed Rudolph wanted to prove what honourable Canadians they had become, so signed up with Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an Air Gunner.\n\nWhen 101 Squadron was earmarked as the ABC Squadron in 1943 a call went out for volunteers who spoke or understood German, Rudolph volunteered for the as of yet undisclosed role, that he would play on the Squadron. His job on the Lancaster was the Special Duty Operator, the eighth man. The SD Operators came from all walks of life, some were German Jews like Hans Heinz Schwarz or George Kesten, who were born in Berlin, but fled their homeland and served in the RAF. Others were aircrew who had learnt some German at school, and volunteered for this new role. They all had to learn the codewords that the ground controllers would use with the Nightfighter pilots, as an example ‘Kapelle’ which meant Target Altitude.\n\nSo as Rudolph stared at his Cathode Ray Tube he was looking for a blip that would indicate a transmission. He would stop his receiver on the signal and listen to confirm it was a Luftwaffe ground to air frequency. Once confirmed he would activate one of three 50 Watt transmitters, bring it over the frequency and block the signal, thereby preventing the Luftwaffe ground controllers from communicating with their Nightfighters. Often engine noise picked up by a microphone in one of the engines, would be played out as the jamming signal. The outside of the ABC Lancaster was dominated by three large aerials, two on the top of the fuselage, and one under the nose, these highlighted the specialist role of the aircraft. But the crew of PD268 were not alone, other Lancasters from 101 Squadron would also be dispersed in the Bomber Stream at 10 mile intervals, all using their jammers to mask the Luftwaffe air comms. So as the Bomber stream progressed the jamming umbrella would move along trying to protect the raid.\n\nThe ABC Lancaster not only provided a jamming capability, they were part of the raid plan, carrying a bomb load themselves. The load would be reduced because of the extra weight of the specialised equipment and the extra operator carried in the fuselage. In the case of PD268 the bombs would never reach the target, the importance of the activities of 101 Sqn was not lost on the Luftwaffe, which made every effort to locate and destroy the modified Lancasters. A Nightfighter, the very thing they were trying to protect the stream from, managed to intercept them and attack the aircraft with cannon. No wreckage or crew were found and it was assumed the aircraft had come down in the sea. The only place relatives could pay their respects was the Runnymede Memorial, which commemorates over 20,000 air force men and women, who lost their lives and have no known grave.\n\nHorst Klötzer was a local historian and archaeologist who documented the crash sites of warplanes in the Westphalia district of Germany. In 2013 he followed up on reports of a crash site in a forest near the city of Hagen, and a survey of the site found widely scattered remains of an aircraft, some of these parts were very tiny, often less than two centimetres wide. Further excavation revealed some British coins, a compass pendant, part of a landing gear strut and various metal pieces with identification marks on them. There was also reports from local people who remembered the crash took place on the 7th March 1945 and that a body from the crash had been buried in an unmarked grave in the local cemetery. After painstaking investigation the final resting place of PD268 had been discovered. The cemetery had no records to support the burial of the airman and no further action by the authorities has taken place.\n\nHorst Klötzer and his team used social media to try and find surviving relatives of the crew. In 2015 Ernest Mahr, the brother of Rudy, flew to Paris with his wife, hired a car and drove the 560 kilometres to the crash site at Hagen. Ernest could finally pay his respects to his elder brother, who was just nineteen years old at the time of his death.\n\nPlt Officer Rudolf “Rudy” Mahr RCAF Special Duties Operator\n\n101 Sqn part of No1 Group had some of the largest losses in Bomber Command during WW2. Because of their specialist role not only did they fly missions with No1 Group, they also had to fly in support of other Groups. Hence there was very little respite for the men of 101 Sqn. In total 1094 men were Killed In Action and 178 were taken Prisoners Of War.\n\nTo order your stone and preserve the memory of your loved one click here\n\n51 Squadron is one of our local units here in Lincolnshire, and currently operates out of RAF Waddington, just a few miles south of the International Bomber Command Centre, flying the ‘Rivet Joint RC135W’ aircraft.\n\nDuring the war it was a Bomber Command Unit assigned to No 4 Group and operating out of various airfields in Yorkshire, including RAF Linton-on-Ouse, RAF Dishforth and RAF Snaith, flying the Whitley and then the Halifax Bomber.\n\nBorn on the 10th December 1914, Porokoru Patapu Pohe, (known as John or Johnny) grew up on his parents farm in Taihape, New Zealand. After finishing school he worked on the family farm and served two years in the Territorial Army with the Manawatu Mounted Rifles. In 1939 he volunteered to join the RNZAF, and was eventually accepted for pilot training. On the 18th January 1941 Porokoru was awarded his flying brevet, and thus became the first Maori pilot in the New Zealand Air Force. Like many of his compatriots he travelled to Canada to undergo advanced training under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, before finally arriving at No 10 OTU at RAF Abingdon in May 1941, to convert onto the Whitley.\n\nIt was whilst flying a Whitley on the 21st July 1941, on a bombing raid near Paris, that he earned the distinction of being the first Maori to bomb a target in occupied Europe. On the 24th August 1941 Porokoru was posted to 51 Squadron and was promoted to Flight Sergeant in October that year. The following February he piloted a Whitley which dropped paratroopers on a radar station near Le Havre. This daring raid called Operation Biting or perhaps better know as the Bruneval Raid, was mounted to try and capture and dismantle a German radar called ‘Würzburg’. This radar controlled anti aircraft and searchlight batteries, whilst also directing nightfighters into the bomber streams, so any countermeasures that could neutralise it, would be very useful. So the aim of the raid was to return sections of the radar, including some of the electronics back to the scientists in Britain, so they could get a better understanding of the inner workings of the system, and advances in German Radar technology. To help with this, they also brought back a German Radar Technician, all the equipment was taken down to the local beach where a Royal Navy landing craft collected the assault teams, transferred them to motor gunboats for the journey back across the Channel.\n\nOn completion of his operational tour Porokoru was posted as an instructor to No 24 OTU at RAF Honeybourne flying the Wellington. In March 1943 he survived a crash when the wing of his Wellington caught fire. Requesting a transfer back to operational flying, he converted to the Halifax bomber at No 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit at RAF Rufforth, before he and his crew rejoined No 51 Sqn, which was now based at RAF Snaith. Within two days of joining his old squadron, he was tasked to fly against Hannover. On the night of 22nd September 1943, in aircraft JN901, they were hit twice by anti aircraft fire over the target area and had to limp for home. Such was the damage to the aircraft that they were forced to ditch in the English Channel, but at least all the crew survived. For two days they huddled in the dinghies before a German spotter plane sighted them and directed a German vessel to pick them up, thus Porokoru and his crew became Prisoners Of War.\n\nPorokoru eventually arrived at Stalag Luft III near Sagan in October, but by 1944 he was actively helping to construct tunnel ‘Harry’, that would shortly see prisoners try to make a bid for freedom, in what is famously called ‘The Great Escape’.\n\nOn the night of 24/25th March 1944 in the depths of a real bad winter, seventy six POWs managed to escape through tunnel ‘Harry’ before a guard patrolling outside the perimeter fence noticed the next man attempting to emerge from the tunnel. When the Germans discovered the escape, they put into action a well rehearsed manhunt. Porokoru and his companion Al Hake, an Australian Spitfire pilot, who were both suffering with frostbite in their feet, were captured by a local patrol and handed over to the Gestapo at Görlitz prison. On the 30th March, Gestapo officers collected six prisoners including Al Hake and Porokoru, they were driven away and never seen again. On Hitler’s orders fifty of the escapees were executed, they were chosen from different nationalities to send a chilling message back to the camps. Of the original seventy six to escape, fifty were executed, twenty three were returned to POW camps and just three managed to escape, one landed in England, two managed to seek refuge in Sweden.\n\nOriginally cremated and buried at Sagan, Porokoru is now buried in Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery. At Sagan close to the where Stalag Luft III was located, there is a memorial to ‘The Fifty’. Post war investigations saw a number of those guilty for the murders, tracked down arrested and tried for their crimes.\n\nFlying Officer Porokoru Patapu Pohe RNZAF was Mentioned in Dispatches with the citation “In recognition of distinguished service and devotion to duty”. He is remembered on Panel 227 of the Memorial Walls here at the International Bomber Command Centre. Below is an entry from Fg Off JSB Tyrie’s Stalag Luft III diary, which remembers those executed during ‘The Great Escape’\n\nTo order your stone and preserve the memory of your loved one click here"
