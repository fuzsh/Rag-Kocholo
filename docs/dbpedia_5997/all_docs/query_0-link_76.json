        "text": "Until now the situation of the two belligerents is relatively balanced and oriented towards a wait-and-see attitude or at least a defensive attitude. On the Italian side, this strategy corresponds to the orientations of the Duce and the General Staff. Isolated geographically, poorly prepared and lacking modern equipment, the Italian troops have no interest in embarking on a more offensive strategy. While some attacks are launched during the summer of 1940, they are more to strengthen the lines of defense by capturing the main border forts controlling access to water points and road infrastructure. The conquest of British Somaliland has the same objective of eliminating an opposing enclave and shortening the front to be covered. The idea, conveyed by some authors, that the Italians have missed the opportunity to inflict a serious setback on British forces must be strongly relativized. First of all, the situation of the British is far from being so weak with the gradual arrival during the autumn of reinforcement from India, South Africa, as well as from various African colonies. In addition, an offensive towards Sudan would have been a logistical nightmare for the Italians given the size of the area to cross to go toward Egypt and the absence of any infrastructure. In addition, we must not forget the need for the Italian troops to fight a rebellion in area of eastern and northern Ethiopia.\n\nOn the British side, this strictly defensive position can be explained by the need to strengthen the forces on the ground and especially to train inexperienced troops. Nevertheless, East Africa is in the thinking of the British Command and General Archibald Wawell. He is aware of the need to secure his rear lines and logistics before considering a victory in North Africa. The Red Sea is one of these vital arteries. As a result of the closure of the Mediterranean Sea, renforcement can only came from two directions: the Indian Empire or bypassing Africa. In both cases, the ships must cross the Red Sea to access Egypt, that is to say within reach of italian airfields andports. In addition, the Italian presence has the consequence of classifying the Red Sea as a war zone, which excludes the navigation of any American ship. It is therefore essential to eliminate this danger.\n\nWithout going into the details of the British strategy, which will be discussed later, the situation changes gradually in October for several reasons. First, there is a change in command with the arrival of General William Platt in Sudan and Alan Cunningham in Kenya with instructions to relaunch the offensive spirit. Then, significant reinforcements are progressively deployed on both fronts.\n\nLieutenant-General Alan Cunningham, the new Commander-in-Chief for Kenya (East Africa forces).Collection : Imperial War Museum.\n\nFinally, a double political pressure is imposed by General Jan Smuts, the South African Prime Minister, to obtain a victory during the first half of 1941, as well as by Winston Churchill. Pending a simultaneous offensive on both fronts for the beginning of 1941, decision is nevertheless made to launch a series of progressive attacks to strengthen the starting positions and train the troops.\n\nThe first begins on 6 November 1940, in Sudan, taking advantage of the arrival of the first elements of the 5th Indian Division. General William Platt decides to prepare an attack against the border position of Gallabat. He can used the Sudan Defense Force, the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and eight Matilda of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment. The clash turns, initially, in favor of the British who quickly take the position with heavy losses for the 27th Italian Colonial Battalion. Following the initial success, Brigadier William Slim, in charge of the units, is instructed to continue in the direction of Metemma where the Italian position is nevertheless stronger. In parallel, the Regia Aeronautica receives the order to concentrate all its forces to support the Italian troops. The aerial battle that engages turns to the advantage of the Italians who conquer the air superiority. From the first day, the K Flight and No.1 (SAAF) Squadron are virtually eliminated as a fighting force with the loss of five Gloster. The South Africans also deplore the loss of their squadron leader. On the ground, General Slim is forced to order a general retreat while destroying the equipment remained on the spot so the last three Matilda available. The losses amount to about 200 men.\n\nThis first battle marks a first turning point in East Africa as it is the last Italian victory and British defeat. At the same time, the Italian decision to concentrate Regia Aeronautica in a specific sector shows real limits in terms of logistics. Suffering from an absence of any possible reinforcement, obliged to disperse more and more these units on the various sectors, the Regia Aeronautica will not be able any more to concentrate its forces against the British offensives. This at a time when the RAF and SAAF are able to receive more modern aircraft like Bristol Blenheim and Hawker Hurricane.\n\nOn the southern front, a similar operation is launched on 16 December 1940 against El Wak with elements of the 1st South African Infantry Brigade, the 24th Gold Coast Brigade and the 1st South African Light Tank Company, under the orders of General Dan Pienaar.\n\nGeneral Dan Pienaar (1st South African Infantry Brigade).Collection : Imperial War Museum.\n\nThe attack is a success and the Italian position falls before the end of the day. Without going into the details of this battle, rather minor in its objective and scale, it allows to highlight several elements. First, there is the air superiority by the presence of the South African Hawker Hurricanes. In parallel, No.40 (SAAF) Squadron’s Hartbees are able to ensure very good cooperation with ground troops, while several Junkers Ju.86 of No.12 (SAAF) Squadron are sent to bomb italian positions before the assault. On the ground, the action is conducted with a very good coordination between the infantry and motorized troops to bypass and cut the enemy lines, which illustrates the future aspect of operations on the southern front.\n\nFinally, the political aspect is strongly present with the choice of the day of the attack at the request of the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts. 16 December is Dingaan’s Day in South Africa, a sacred event in Afrikaner nationalist mythology, when about five hundred Voortrekkers under the orders of Kapitan Andries Pretorius and Sarel Cilliers win a major victory against the Zulu troops in the battle of Blood River in 1838. Jan Smuts wishes to attract the support of the nationalist and the majority of the white Afrikaner population relatively hostile to the idea of fighting alongside the British Empire, while strengthening the position of the South Africans troops. As proof, he hastens the following days to propose the sending of an additional South African division.\n\nEl Wak’s victory marks the second turning point in East Africa with one of the first Italian defeats in this theater of operations, while providing the first elements of future allied success on the southern front: a “blitzkrieg” with motorized troops, a willingness to bypass the defenses by multiple movements, the conquest of air superiority and cooperation with troops on the ground, but also a very strong political influence. On the Italian side, this very relative failure is nonetheless clearly evident as General Gustavo Pesenti, commander of the Juba sector, is immediately replaced by Carlo de Simone (at the head of the offensive against British Somaliland). In addition, the Italian reports express strong concern over the total inefficiency of anti-armor ammunition, mostly from stocks captured during the conquest of British Somaliland.\n\n6 November 1940\n\nNorthern Front\n\nThe village of Gallabat is one of the border posts between Sudan and Ethiopia, and controls one of the main roads in the region (with the village of Metemma on the other side of the border). On 4 July 1940, a column under the command of General Pietro Gazzara occupies the various British forts on the border. The Gallabat – Metemma sector is then entrusted to Tenente Colonnello Castagnuola with the 25th, 27th and 77th Colonial Battalion, as well as several Banda formations (irregular troops often from Eritrea or Italian Somaliland). In order to facilitate the future offensive to the north, and to test the relatively inexperienced troops, Major-General William Platt decided to organize a limited offensive to retake Fort Gallabat and, depending on the situation, push towards Metemma. The operation is entrusted to the command of Brigadier William Slim placed at the head of the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade, just arrived in Sudan. He has also, for this purpose, eight armored Matilda of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment. The air component is formed by Vickers Wallesley of No.47 (RAF) Squadron and nine Gloster Gladiator of No.1 (SAAF) Squadron and K Flight.\n\nThe attack began at 05:30 when the British artillery opened fire towards Gallabat, taking the Italian garrison completely by surprise. At the same time, six Vickers Wellesley of No.47 (RAF) Squadron took off between 02:55 and 03:18, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Graham R. Magill. If the K7733 crash on takeoff, although with no consequence to the crew, the other five bombers are over the target around 05:00 to bomb the fort and the radio station. They are followed by several Vickers Vincent of No.430 (RAF) Flight. Two Hawker Hardy pf No.237 (Rhodesia) Squadron are also above between 04:55 and 08:35, to cooperate with ground troops.\n\nThings seem to start well for the British and at 08:00 the first elements attack the Italian troops for the control of Fort Gallabat. Despite several Italian counterattacks, the fort quickly falls into the hands of the opponents, and Brigadier William Slim is already starting to consider a movement towards Metemma. However, the events are about to switch, at least initially, on the air.\n\nIn order to cover the troop’s progress against the potential Italian bombers, three Gloster Gladiators of K Flight take off : Flight Lieutenant Kenneth H. Savage (L7614), Pilot Officer Jack Hamlyn (L7612) and Henry B. Kirk (K7969). While patrolling east of Metemma, they are totally surprised by a formation of six Fiat CR.42 of 412a Squadriglia CT under the command of Capitano Antonio Raffi. British pilots do not have time to react. Lieutenant Flight Kenneth H. Savage is killed, while Pilot Officer Henry B. Kirk must evacuate his aircraft. If the Pilot Officer Jack Hamyln manages to escape, injured at his foot, he is quickly forced to a crashed-landing with his Gloster Gladiator L7612. The K Flight is now reduced to one aircraft (K7977). The victories are claimed, on the Italian side, by Capitano Antonio Raffi, Tenente Niso Provinciali and Sergente Pietro Morlotti.\n\nShortly after, the Italians spot another isolated fighter. This is Major Schalk van Schalkwyk of No.1 (SAAF) Squadron in charge of a reconnaissance flight. Immediately at Heston’s advanced airfield, Captain Brian J.L. Boyle is ordered to take off to assist him. He arrives just in time to see his Squadron Leader jump in parachute, the clothes on fire. Severely burned, Major Schalk von Schalkwyk will die the next day despite medical care by the Italians. Now isolated with the Italian fighters, Captain Brian J.L. Boyle has no choice but to try to escape. He finally managed to put his Gloster Gladiator (N5852) severely damaged in friendly lines. Injured, he is evacuated to the hospital of Wadi Seidna. He will receive the DFC on 7 January 1941. The two victories are claimed, respectively, by Capitano Antonio Raffi and Sottotenente Fiorindo Rosmino.\n\nLogbook of Captain Brian J.L. Boyle.Collection : SAAF Museum, via Tinus le Roux.\n\nIf Indian troops are able to capture the fort, the loss of air cover allows the Italians to bring some Caproni Ca.133 who are able to harass the troops on the ground.\n\nFour Gloster Gladiators of No.1 (SAAF) Squadron take off around 13:20 to patrol over Gallabat. They are joined by the latest aircraft of K Flight, the K7977 piloted by Flying Officer Jack M. Hayward. They intercept a Caproni Ca.133 formation, two of which are claimed destroyed by Lieutenant Andrew Duncan and John L. Hewitson (N5824).\n\nThey are, however, once again surprised by Fiat CR.42 of 412a Squadriglia CT. The K Flight continues is bad luck and Flying Officer Jack M. Hayward is quickly shot and killed. The South Africans are doing better as Lieutenant Johan J. Coetzer and Robin Pare, assisted by the other two pilots, are able to claim two Italian fighters. In practice, 412a Squadriglia CT only reports a damaged aircraft during the day. Tenente Mario Visintini claims a victory during the clash.\n\nIn any case, the day ends very badly for the British and South Africans that has lost six Gloster Gladiators, loss three pilots and three others wounded. K Flight is literally decimated, while No.1 (SAAF) Squadron no longer has an officer with a rank higher than Lieutenant. As a result, Air Commodore Leonard H. Slatter is ordered to come quickly to take control."
