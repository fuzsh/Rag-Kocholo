Note: Budget numbers for movies can be both difficult to find and unreliable. Studios and film-makers often try to keep the information secret and will use accounting tricks to inflate or reduce announced budgets.

This chart shows the budget of every film in our database, where we have it. The data we have is, to the best of our knowledge, accurate but there are gaps and disputed figures. If you have additional information or corrections, please let us know at corrections@the-numbers.com.

Our movie profit and loss records, based on this budget information, can be found here.
