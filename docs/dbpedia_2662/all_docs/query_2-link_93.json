        "text": "An X-Ray Procedure is used to study and diagnose disease of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. X-rays use invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs on film. X-rays are made by using external radiation to produce images of the body, its organs and other internal structures for diagnostic purposes. X-rays pass through body tissues onto specially treated plates (similar to camera film) and a “negative” type picture is made (the more solid a structure is, the whiter it appears on the film).\n\nNational Ankle X-Ray Procedure Pricing Summary\n\nNational Minimum Price $51 (Lincolnton, NC) National Average Price $72 National Maximum Price $133 (Lincolnton, NC)\n\nAnkle X-Ray Cost Averages Around the Country\n\nPrice Range San Francisco, CA Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $110 - $280 Seattle, WA Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $70 - $170 Denver, CO Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $60 - $150 St. Louis, MO Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $80 - $190 Tampa, FL Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $60 - $140 San Diego, CA Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $80 - $200 Boston, MA Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $100 - $240 Detroit, MI Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $60 - $160 Minneapolis, MN Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $60 - $150 Baltimore, MD Ankle X-Ray Cost Average $90 - $230\n\nClick to find out more about how to use the pricing information shown on this site.\n\nHow to Use Our Pricing Data\n\nOur goal at NewChoiceHealth is to provide you with comprehensive medical pricing information that gives you the power to make more informed healthcare purchasing decisions.
