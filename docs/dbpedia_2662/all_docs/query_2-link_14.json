        "text": "Weekend predictions: Garfield likely to come top on brutal weekend at the box office (updated)\n\nMay 31st, 2024\n\nAfter a record-breaking (for all the wrong reasons) Memorial Day weekend, market conditions are only going to get worse this weekend, with no films opening in over 2,000 theaters. The Garfield Movie looks like the likely winner this weekend, although Furiosa has a shot, and even IF could conceivably top the chart in its third weekend. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: IF faltering as we head into another disappointing weekend\n\nMay 17th, 2024\n\nAfter a good opening for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes last weekend, it looked as though Summer season momentum was building. Soft preview numbers for IF are cause for concern though. As a family film, it should play strongly through the weekend, but it’ll need to perform very strongly to hit the $40 million or $50 million that we’d hoped for. Meanwhile, The Strangers: Part 1 is looking solid, and Back to Black is, as expected, falling short of its potential. More...\n\nIF trailer\n\nMay 17th, 2024\n\nComedy starring Cailey Fleming and Ryan Reynolds opens in theaters today. Full movie details."
