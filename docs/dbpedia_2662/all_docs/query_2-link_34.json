        "text": "Aug 7, 2024 | 1:53 PM\n\nLocal film production company Banished Bird Films is holding a launch party Wednesday, August 7 to celebrate the start of production on their new film Booty Call.\n\nProducer Jessica Ray Moutray says the dramatic thriller follows a recent high school graduate living on a farm with his sister and grandparents after the death of his parents.\n\n“His younger 12-year-old sister is absolutely obsessed with their late parents and a supposed family treasure that was buried out on the farm,” Moutry says. “He doesn’t believe that this treasure exists. But when their grandparents go away for a weekend, thieves end up showing up at the property, and they end up having to survive a hostage situation and settle their differences.”\n\nMoutray says the free-to-attend launch party will include early footage shot for the film.\n\n“We’re going to have a bit of a teaser going on of the first shots of the film,” she says. “We have some door prizes available. We really wanted to bring together people that are curious about film and the film community that already exists in Grande Prairie, because the arts community is so integral to our city.”\n\nShe says she was happy to be involved in such a heavily local production in her hometown, after previously moving away to pursue film in Vancouver.\n\n“When the pandemic happened, we moved back,” she says. “You come up with this notion that these things just don’t happen here. But then we go more involved as we came home. I joined the PRIMAA (Peace Region Independent Media Arts Association) board of directors, and then I met Leanne and Sonja our other two producers, and they were the two that recruited me to help,”\n\nFilming on Booty Call is expected to wrap later this month, followed by roughly six months of editing to get the film ready for it’s premiere.\n\nThe launch party is being held at GPLT tonight (Wednesday, August 7). Doors open at 7:00 p.m.\n\n(Photo Credit Banished Bird Films)"
