        "text": "To find the box office data for a film, go to the title page and scroll to the section titled \"Box Office\".\n\nYou can find additional box office information by going to the IMDbPro title page. IMDbPro, our membership service for industry professionals, provides granular box office data for a title such as budget, country wise box office data such as opening weekend gross, total gross, and weekend gross in the \"Box Office\" widget and tab on both the desktop site and IMDbPro apps.\n\nFor a list of all-time top grossing movies both domestically (North America) and worldwide please visit Box Office Mojo. On Box Office Mojo, you will find additional all-time charts as well as box office reporting from around the world including daily, weekend, weekly, monthly, quarterly, seasonal and yearly box office reporting and editorial coverage.\n\nOur gross figures are cumulative (i.e. they reflect the total amount of money grossed by a movie up to a certain date in the specified territory).\n\nSome movie may also include partial weekend grosses that display the amount of money collected during that particular weekend. Weekend grosses are not cumulative: each weekend gross amount therefore doesn't include the money collected in the previous weekend.\n\nA date of \"final\" next to a box office gross indicates the total amount of money collected during the film's whole release period.\n\nMovie grosses reporting isn't an exact science. Studios and distributors have started disclosing detailed figures only recently; the information for films released over 15 years ago are therefore very sketchy. The longer you go back in time, the less reliable the information becomes.\n\nSome sources often erroneously report theatrical rentals as grosses. On some old or foreign films, only rental figures may be available instead of grosses, and vice-versa.\n\nThe info on movie budgets is even harder to find: studios are usually very reticent when it comes to discussing how much a film cost, especially when a movie performed poorly at the box-office. Additionally, reported budgets may change over time due to escalating costs (Waterworld and Titanic are two high profile examples) or costs may be difficult to calculate (the salary for a star or director may be part of a sum agreed for a package deal consisting of several films).\n\nReported budgets may also vary greatly depending on whether they only include the cost of producing/shooting the film (the so-called 'negative cost') or also additional expenses (like prints and advertising). For low-budget movies, the promotional expenses can often be much larger than the negative cost (see for example The Blair Witch Project).\n\nWhenever possible/available, our budget figures refer to a film's negative cost, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nOur gross figures are cumulative (i.e. they reflect the total amount of money grossed by a movie up to a certain date in the specified territory).\n\nSome movie may also include partial weekend grosses that display the amount of money collected during that particular weekend. Weekend grosses are not cumulative: each weekend gross amount therefore doesn't include the money collected in the previous weekend.\n\nA date of \"final\" next to a box office gross indicates the total amount of money collected during the film's whole release period."
