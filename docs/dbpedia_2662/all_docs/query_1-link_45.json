        "text": "Some movies just seem destined to fail. Hard Rain is one of these tragic cases. Originally titled The Flood, the film was shot in early 1996 but wasn't released until 1998, in January, a dumping ground for bad movies. Standing in the wake of several disaster-themed pictures (i.e. Twister, Dante's Peak and Volcano), and following several water-themed adventures like Waterworld, Speed 2: Cruise Control and Titanic (not to mention Deep Rising, which was released later the same month), Hard Rain arrived right at the tail end of the disaster craze.\n\nThe film brewed a bit of a media storm blanketed in bad publicity thanks to a rough start (John Woo left the project), lengthy reshoots (the film's ending was reworked) and bad early word (claims the film wasn't any good, hence the title change). To make matters worse, the film's theatrical trailer wasn't particularly exciting, and the film sported an undesirable R-rating (there are three moments of completely unnecessary graphic violence that could have been very easily removed to obtain a PG-13).\n\nUltimately, people simply weren't compelled to see the film, and, quite literally, its $70 million budget was washed down the tubes. Thankfully though, like many big budget box office bombs of the mid-to-late '90s, the film did manage to chum up some bank thanks to VHS and DVD sales, but it was too little, too late. Hard Rain had already been unanimously hailed as a box office dud.\n\nTo be frank tough, it's a shame people skipped out on Hard Rain, because it's a solid disaster flick. The film doesn't differ much from a good old-fashioned Western, albeit a soaked Western. An armored car guard (Christian Slater) must fight for his life when a gang of hoodlums (one even wears a cowboy hat) rob his vehicle amidst a terrifying flood. Our hero makes it out alive, with the $3 million in cash his armored car was holding. But once the town's unlikable sheriff learns of the money, the hoodlums aren't the only people our hero must contend with.\n\nProduced and written by the folks behind Speed, the film basically follows the same formula of that picture. You've got your plucky up-and-coming female heroine (Minnie Driver), the former '80s heartthrob hero (Christian Slater), a few renowned character actors (Randy Quaid, Betty White, and Ed Asner to name a few), and a top class A-lister as your villain (Morgan Freeman). Add in a few action sequences, some romance, a heist, and you've basically got the same movie.\n\nBut the fact that writer Graham Yost actually manages to frequently deviate from the formula is what makes Hard Rain so interesting. The film ignores some of the typical plot conventions of a genre action picture, opting for smarter tension-building sequences and lively action beats. Yost even manages to give dimensionality to the film's principal villain – who isn't as cold-hearted as a stock villain would be.\n\nAnd instead of relying on the picture's disaster themes to drive the narrative, the flood seems more symbolic of something deeper, even biblical. This is why the film's third-act morality play works as well as it does. Sure, it sneaks up on the audience a bit too quickly, but the simple fact that Yost has the foresight to see that our best (and worst) qualities come out in the midst of disaster is honestly quite refreshing. It's particularly fresh in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which saw the failure of federal and local government, and rampant looting – both elements are strewn throughout the narrative.\n\nWhile it's clear some post-production tinkering has taken place (one subplot involving Betty White seems completely out of place), Hard Rain is actually a surprisingly energetic actioner.\n\nThe production design is just incredible. The entire city really looks like it's been drowned by massive flooding. Effects, most of which are practical, are shockingly terrific barring a few exceptions (fire effects look terrible).\n\nAction set pieces are delightfully exciting, and the film even boasts a few tense moments. It's also skillfully shot, built around fun characters and interesting twists and turns. It's not always the cleverest disaster picture (logic errors abound). But compared to some of the more recent disaster-themed dreck that chews up space on SyFy, Hard Rain is a genuine genre masterpiece.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nThe film is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen using the AVC MPEG-4 codec on a single-layered BD25 disc. The film itself consumes 21.3 gigs of disc space. Hard Rain looked pretty abysmal on DVD, so this high-def master truly is a breath of fresh air. But don't expect a pristine presentation – this dark, murky film isn't really capable of providing such greatness.\n\nShot mostly at night in low-light settings with heavy rain dropping down during virtually every major set piece, the film looks inherently nasty. Black levels bleed into one another. Colors are muted (with a slight blue hue infecting blacks). Textures and details are flattened as the picture's depth of field is limited by the rain and bad lighting. If a character is right in front of the camera, expect a sharp, clean image. If they stand more than about three feet away, expect a much softer image.\n\nStill, this encode does its best, with very few compression flaws (the rain doesn't give way to too much macroblocking). There is a hint of color banding, most noticeable during wide shots that feature gray, dreary backdrops. The print, unfortunately, is marred by nasty black and white dust specks immediately noticeable during the Paramount logo, and present throughout the picture. This indicates that the print didn't see a thorough remaster for this Blu-ray, which is a real shame. The film deserves better, though, admittedly, the transfer is much sharper and cleaner than most Lionsgate catalog titles.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nAudio choices are English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with Spanish and English subtitles and English captions for the hearing impaired. I've never really been of fan of this film's sound design, and it's not any better on Blu, even with the sound field opened up to a full 7 channels.\n\nThe mix complete lacks three-dimensionality. Rain seems to only come from the front surrounds and the center channel. Effects are incredibly unstable and poorly mixed into rear surrounds. For example, there's a flood alarm that goes off just before the dam breaks, but it's only occasionally heard in the rears. Why not all the time? After all, it is a city-wide alarm, shouldn't it be heard anywhere in the city? Even echoing in the background?\n\nEven more annoying, the film barely uses any LFE despite numerous gun battles and explosions, not to mention the pulse-pounding score from Christopher Young. Dialogue is also occasionally distracted by the film's thunderstorms and gun play, particularly because most of the rain seems to be coming from the center speaker. While this could have very easily clocked in as a reference listening experience had the sound designers actually understood how to craft a mix with some semblance of spatial awareness, what we ultimately get is downright waterlogged.\n\nScore: 4 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nThis single-disc BD comes packed in a blue elite case featuring the film's cheesy, blown-out home video artwork that makes the film look more like a bootleg of a direct-to-video cheapie. Extras include the film's theatrical trailer (in SD), Lionsgate's standard bookmarking feature as well as their usual collection of trailers and promo materials. That's it.\n\nIt's a shame Lionsgate didn't offer a retrospective featurette about this \"troubled\" production. Or at least provide fans with the film's darker, alternate ending.\n\nScore: 1 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCheck your brain at the door and you'll inevitably have a ball with this tense, action-packed Western/disaster picture. It's a shame, even in hi-def, the movie looks and sounds mediocre. But, despite the flaws, this Blu-ray still provides the best presentation currently available on home video."
