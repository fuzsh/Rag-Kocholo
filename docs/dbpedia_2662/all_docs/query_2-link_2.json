        "text": "British actor and producer Ray Panthaki has told Sky News he thinks people should be more open about what it costs to make a film.\n\nPanthaki's new film Convenience was independently made for a budget of £80,000 - the same amount it would cost to do just one shot of a Harry Potter movie, he said.\n\n\"You know what you're kind of told as producer, 'never say your budget, never tell anyone what it is',\" he said.\n\nBut he said he was happy to admit the cost of making his film in the hope it might inspire others who want to do the same.\n\nThe final Harry Potter film, which was released in 2011, cost £125m to make.\n\nPanthaki added that he thinks the British film industry is in great shape and that there are plenty of tax breaks to take advantage of."
