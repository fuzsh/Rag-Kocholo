He tells them that he is a student,sleeping rough so they persuade him to come back to the site and ask for a job.\n\nPoetic Justice\n\nThe sisters and Dorien are on a trip to the Isle of Wight where Chris and Darryl have been transferred to Albany prison.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nJeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond are on location with the forthcoming Sweeney movie as they take charge of shooting the film's climactic car chase. Clarkson uses his expertise to choreograph the stunt driving whilst Hammond directs the movie's lead actors, Ray Winstone and Plan B, and organises an explosive finale. Meanwhile, back at the test track James May casts a suspicious eye over the new Vauxhall Corsa VXR Nurburgring and gives his verdict on the brand new Fiat Panda. Plus, Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds is the star in the Reasonably Priced Car."
