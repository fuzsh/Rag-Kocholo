Many videographers also handle sound production for these events.\n\nDo videographers provide raw footage?\n\nSome videographers provide raw footage for an extra fee of $100 to $500+. Raw footage is the unedited footage of your event with hundreds of video clips in separate files, not one continuous video. Raw footage does not incorporate high-quality audio from external microphones.\n\nAre videographers worth it?\n\nA videographer is worth it to capture more than a photograph can. Your event only happens once, and a video allows you to relive your favorite memories from that special day.\n\nHow much to tip a videographer\n\nTip $50 to $100 to the lead videographer and $50 to $75 for the assistant or second shooter. However, tipping a videographer is not expected if the videographer owns the business. Consider tipping if the videographer works for a larger video company or exceeds your expectations.\n\nHow to find and hire a videographer\n\nBefore choosing a videographer near you, be sure to:\n\nLook for videographers whose style matches the video type you like best.\n\nRead their reviews on Fash and Google.\n\nInterview your favorite videographers and discuss your ideas and vision.\n\nAsk the videographer about their pre-event, event day, and post-event process.\n\nGet a detailed contract in writing that breaks down everything included in your package, the payment plan, and the refund and cancellation policy.\n\nDiscuss the video usage rights to confirm how you and the videographer can use the footage. Videographers often retain the copyright to use the videos for marketing and social media.\n\nDon’t make the last payment until you’ve received the final video.\n\nQuestions to ask videographers\n\nAsk these questions to ensure you hire the best videographer:\n\nHow many events have you filmed, and which event types do you specialize in?\n\nHow many events do you film per year?\n\nWhat’s your videography style and approach?\n\nCan we see examples of finished videos you created?\n\nWhat packages do you offer, and how much do they cost?\n\nCan you describe your editing process?\n\nDo we get any input into the final product?\n\nHow do you choose the music for the video, and can we choose the music?\n\nIf you charge a travel fee, what does it cover?\n\nWhat is your payment schedule and required deposit?\n\nWhat is your refund or cancellation policy?\n\nDo you carry backup videography equipment?\n\nWhen will we receive our edited video?\n\nWhat format will you deliver our video in?\n\nWill we own the rights to the video, or are there any sharing or use restrictions?\n\nWill you share our videos on your website or social media?"
