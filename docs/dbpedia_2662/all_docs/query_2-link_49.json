        "text": "Did you know that the information from a diagnostic X-ray can save your life?1 It's no surprise, then, that seven out of 10 Americans get medical or dental X-rays each year.1 X-rays can be a safe and effective way for providers to evaluate your health.2\n\nKeep reading to learn more about X-rays, including how they work, how much they cost and more.\n\nWhat Is an X-Ray?\n\nAn X-ray (aka radiograph) is a common imaging procedure ordered by medical and dental providers.3 In fact, X-rays are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging.4\n\nX-rays create pictures of your bones, teeth, organs and soft tissues — all without making an incision.3 Most often, healthcare professionals use X-rays to evaluate injuries such as broken bones and dislocated joints,2 and to spot cavities.3 However, this noninvasive technology can help providers diagnose, treat and monitor a wide range of injuries, disorders and diseases.2\n\nDo You Need an X-Ray?\n\nIf your healthcare provider can't diagnose an issue by sight or touch, they may order an X-ray. Below are some signs that you might need an X-ray.5\n\nJoint pain or stiffness: X-ray images can reveal fluid buildup from a joint injury, diagnose arthritis and help your doctor monitor the overall condition of your joints.\n\nPersistent swelling: If you notice inflammation that doesn't go down after several days, your doctor may order an X-ray to find out if you fractured a bone or if there's fluid around a joint.\n\nTrouble breathing: With a chest X-ray, your provider can diagnose acute conditions like pneumonia and chronic issues like lung cancer.\n\nTrouble moving a limb: If you injured your ankle, leg or foot and are having trouble walking, an X-ray will show if you fractured a bone.\n\nTrouble with digestion: An X-ray — usually with a contrast dye — can help your doctor diagnose digestive issues or reveal the location of foreign objects in your body.\n\nHow Does an X-Ray Work?\n\nAn X-ray machine sends invisible beams of radiation through your body to create images of your internal structures. Areas like bones and teeth absorb radiation easily, so they appear white in the images. Soft tissues don't absorb radiation as easily, so they appear gray in the images.2\n\nSome types of X-rays use a contrast material such as iodine or barium to create more detailed images.6 If you're having what is called an \"X-ray with contrast,\" you will either swallow a pill, receive an intravenous injection or get an enema containing the dye before the exam.\n\nTypes of Medical X-Rays\n\nX-ray machines can take pictures of different areas inside your body.2 Here are some of the most common types of medical X-rays:2\n\nAbdominal X-rays show images of the kidneys, stomach, liver and bladder to help diagnose conditions like kidney stones and bladder stones.2 With the help of a contrast material like barium, an abdominal X-ray can also reveal problems in your digestive tract.6\n\nBone X-rays can reveal broken bones, dislocated joints and arthritis, as well as signs of bone cancer or infection.2 By taking X-rays over several years, your doctor can also determine the progression of arthritis.6\n\nChest X-rays can reveal abnormalities in the heart and lungs, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung cancer and an enlarged heart.6 A chest X-ray with a contrast material that contains iodine can also highlight sections of the circulatory system to reveal blocked blood vessels.6\n\nMammograms are X-ray images of breast tissue that can help doctors evaluate breast lumps and diagnose breast cancer.2\n\nHow Much Does an X-Ray Cost?\n\nIn the United States, the average cost of a medical X-ray is $125, but prices can range from around $50 to over $500. The cost depends on a variety of factors, including:7\n\nYour location\n\nThe body part being examined\n\nThe facility\n\nX-ray costs by location\n\nIf you live in a rural area with fewer facilities to choose from, your X-ray may cost more than it would in a city with many providers. Below is a chart of the average cost of X-rays around the United States.7\n\nX-ray costs by body part\n\nThe cost of X-rays also depends on the part of the body being examined. For example, a finger X-ray typically costs much less than a chest X-ray. Below is a chart of the average cost of X-rays by body part.8\n\nNote that the average cost of more specialized X-rays — such as arterial, venal or ductal X-rays — can range from $20,000 to $30,000 or more.\n\nX-ray costs by facility\n\nX-ray costs also vary based on the facility. An inpatient facility (like a hospital) typically costs more to run than an outpatient facility (like a doctor's office or urgent care center), so you may end up paying hundreds of dollars more for an X-ray in an inpatient setting. The average cost of an X-ray at inpatient facilities is $450; the average cost of an X-ray at outpatient facilities is $75.7\n\nDoes urgent care do X-rays?\n\nYes, urgent care facilities offer X-rays.9 The cost of an X-ray at urgent care is typically much less than at an emergency room.9 And with your permission, an urgent care facility can share your digital X-rays with your primary care provider.10\n\nAre X-Rays Covered by Health Insurance?\n\nX-rays are usually covered by health insurance.8 Depending on your health plan, your X-rays may be covered in full, or you may be responsible for a copay of about $10 to $50 or coinsurance of about 10% to 50%.8 Make sure to schedule your X-rays at an in-network facility, which will be less expensive than an out-of-network provider.7\n\nIf you don't have health insurance, your X-ray may cost about $100 to $1,000 or more, with an average cost between $260 and $460.11\n\nCost-Saving Options for Medical X-Rays\n\nIf you're looking for the most affordable place to get an X-ray, consider an outpatient clinic or imaging center.11 Cash-paying patients may be charged between $45 and $250 per X-ray at an outpatient clinic.11\n\nIf you don't have insurance, ask about discounts for X-rays — some facilities offer a discount of up to 30% or more for cash-paying patients.8 You can also use the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tool to find a health center near you that offers discounted care based on income.8\n\nOr, consider connecting with MDsave, a marketplace that partners with providers to offer affordable rates on medical procedures for patients to purchase directly online.12 Through MDsave, the national average cost of an X-ray is $279.12\n\nPreparing for an X-Ray\n\nBefore a medical X-ray, you may need to:\n\nWear loose, comfortable clothing or change into a hospital gown.2\n\nRemove metal objects like jewelry and hearing aids.2\n\nAvoid using lotion or perfume.2\n\nFast for several hours (for gastrointestinal X-rays).2\n\nSwallow a contrast medium or take it as an injection or enema.6\n\nNo special preparation is required for a dental X-ray.13\n\nWhat to Expect During an X-Ray\n\nX-ray exams are typically performed by an X-ray technician or radiologist.14 They may provide you with a lead covering to prevent radiation from reaching other parts of your body.3\n\nDuring a medical X-ray, you may need to sit, stand or lie down in several positions while the images are completed.14 You will stand in front of (or sit or lie on) a specialized plate that contains X-ray film or sensors.14 During a dental X-ray, you may need to bite down on a device that's placed inside your mouth.3\n\nIt's important to stay still during an X-ray — or possibly hold your breath for a few seconds — so the image comes out clear.6 Most X-rays are completed within 15 minutes.7\n\nX-Ray Results\n\nX-rays are saved digitally and can be viewed on a computer screen within minutes.6 A radiologist will interpret and report the results to your doctor, who will then share the findings with you.6 While bone X-ray results may be ready right away, the results of X-rays of your digestive tract may take longer.2\n\nAre X-Rays Safe?\n\nIn general, X-rays are safe and effective for people of all ages.3 While radiation exposure can cause cell mutations that may lead to cancer, the amount of radiation you're exposed to during an X-ray is generally low.6 Plus, medical and dental X-rays expose the smallest area of the body necessary to get the image.3\n\nHowever, be sure to tell your doctor if you may be pregnant.6 With most diagnostic medical X-rays, the risk to an unborn baby is small, but your doctor may recommend a different imaging test, such as an ultrasound.6 Dental X-rays are typically safe when you're pregnant or breastfeeding.15\n\nSide effects of X-rays with contrast\n\nIf you have an X-ray with contrast, be sure to drink plenty of fluids afterward to flush the dye from your system.\n\nSide effects from contrast material may include:2\n\nFeeling flushed\n\nA metallic taste\n\nThese side effects typically go away in a few minutes.\n\nIf you have an allergic reaction to the contrast material, symptoms may appear up to a day or two after the X-ray. These may include:2\n\nSkin rash, hives or itching\n\nHeadaches\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nTrouble breathing\n\nCall your doctor if you have symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nHow Often Can You Get an X-Ray?\n\nThere is no strict rule for how many times you can get a medical X-ray each year.1 Every X-ray can involve a tiny risk — but the risk of not getting a medically necessary X-ray is greater than the risk from the radiation.1\n\nPeople with healthy teeth and gums typically need dental X-rays once every six to 18 months.15 However, if you're prone to cavities or gum disease, you might need more frequent X-rays.15\n\nManaging Health and Wellness Costs With the CareCredit Credit Card\n\nIf you are looking for an option to help manage your health & wellness costs, consider financing with the CareCredit credit card.
