        "text": "DVD and Blu-ray Releases for February 1st, 2011\n\nFebruary 1st, 2011\n\nThere's still a lull when it comes to first-run releases on the home market with no major, or even midlevel hits coming out this week. In fact, the best-selling release according to Amazon.com is Alice in Wonderland on Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack, which is a contender for Pick of the Week. The other major contender is Let Me In on Blu-ray, which failed to find an audience despite impressing critics almost as much as the original did. I'm going to give the honor to Let Me In, but both are worthy contenders. More...\n\nDVD Releases for August 8, 2006\n\nAugust 7th, 2006\n\nAccording Amazon, there are nearly 900 DVDs being released this week, half of which are episodes of Charlie Rose. Even if we ignored those releases, it was still a busy week, especially at the high end with several contenders for DVD Pick of the Week. In the end I could narrow it down to three selection, Brick - Buy from Amazon, CSA: The Confederate States of America - Buy from Amazon and Inside Man - Buy from Amazon. But I couldn't decide between those so all three earn the title: DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nInternational Box Office Busier than Weekend Before\n\nApril 17th, 2005\n\nThe Pacifier finally debut across Australia after playing in Queensland and Victoria for the past two weeks; the massive expansion allowed the film to climb to first place with $1.125 million on 267 screens. That lifted its total in the market to $3.41 million so far and the film should have strong legs. Add to that its $1.75 million opening in Spain and $590,000 in Belgium and the film managed $4.1 million over the weekend, which doubled its early total to $8.1 million. More...\n\nFrance's $5 Million Baby\n\nApril 3rd, 2005\n\nMillion Dollar Baby performed brilliantly this week earning $8.8 million for an international total of $60 million, placing fourth on the international box office charts. In France the film dominated the marketplace with $4.94 million on 450 screens and in Germany the film earned $760,000 in semi-limited release (120 screens) for the best per screen average in the market. On the other hand, the film flopped in Slovakia where it missed the top ten in its debut. On the holdover front, the multi-Oscar winning front saw its weekend haul climb by 20% in Spain to $980,000 and it's still doing well in Australia, Italy and South Korea. More...\n\nBaby Still Earning Millions\n\nMarch 27th, 2005\n\nMillion Dollar Baby has again slipped off the radar screen, but we do know it hit $52 million internationally, which means it made $9 million during the week. The film didn't earn $1 million in any single market, but is still doing strong in South Korea, ($970,000), Spain, ($840,000), Italy, ($600,000) and Australia, ($350,000.) Best estimate has the film earning just shy of $5 million of that over the weekend and taking sixth place on the international box office charts. More...\n\nBaby Takes Fifth in Close Race\n\nMarch 20th, 2005\n\nAfter gathering in all the data the winner for the race for fifth place is Million Dollar Baby, I think. It would need to lost more than 40% from last week's total and that's not taking into account its openings in South Korea at $1,515,672 and second place, its $110,000, third place debut in Finland, $86,000 in Russia, $50,000, second place debut in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, exact weekend totals are unknown but it is estimated at $6 million raising its international total to $43 million so far. More...\n\nHitch Tops 2005 Charts\n\nMarch 16th, 2005\n\nNot only is Hitch the undisputed champion of 2005 for the domestic market, it is also the new number one worldwide, topping Howl's Moving Castle $216.5 million to $211.9 million. And with $28.1 million this weekend on 4,600 screens in 40 markets, the film sits at $66.0 million internationally and could become the first film from 2005 to reach the $100 million milestone on the international scene. The film's biggest opening of the weekend came from the U.K., where it racked up $8.1 million including sneak peaks, which represented more than 50% of total box office in the market. Add in first place debuts in Italy with $2.5 million on 300, Belgium with $820,000 on 57, Netherlands with $670,000 on 93 and $225,000 on 16 screens in the U.E.A. The film also performed admirably in South Korea with a third place, $1.4 million weekend on 175 screens. Notable holdovers include its $6.3 million in Germany, down less than 30% to $17.2 million in that market alone and $1.83 million in Australia, down 34% and still first place in both markets. The film was also first place in Scandinavia, but exact numbers are currently unavailable. More...\n\nSwimming with Sharks\n\nMarch 13th, 2005\n\nShark Tale finished its international run with a second place $2.08 million opening in Japan on 485 screens. Its $4,296 per screen average it quite low for the market and generally means the film won't have the usual legs films in Japan have. The film performed much better in Italy where it finished first again with $3.0 million, down just 23% during its sophomore stint. Overall it took in $5.2 million to raise its international total to $181 million, but without any more openings it might struggle to hit $200 million. More...\n\nPhoenix is Reborn on the Home Market\n\nMarch 12th, 2005\n\nFlight of the Phoenix was clearly a disappointment when it was release in theatres last December, but it's fortunes turned around at the home market. Opening week of release saw the remake bring in $7.27 million in DVD rentals and $1.23 million in VHS rentals. Combined they represent nearly half the film's $21.0 million domestic box office. More...\n\nSaw Remains on Top of Belated Rental Charts\n\nMarch 5th, 2005\n\nThanks in part to a slow week for DVD releases, Saw remained the top DVD rental on this weeks charts with $6.80 million this week, a drop of 28% from last week, and a two week total of $16.27 million so far. On the VHS side, the film dropped first to third with $1.09 million, down 38% for a total of $2.83 million. More...\n\nSeems Like Fockers have Finished First Forever\n\nMarch 2nd, 2005\n\nMeet the Fockers maintained their hold on the international box office crown with $20.8 million on 4200 screens in 48 markets for a running tally of $184.7 million. The film opened in only one market, New Zealand, which is strange since the film has been playing in Australia since Christmas. Like Canada and the U.S., most films tend to open in Australia and New Zealand on the same day, and it looks like the delay hurt the film's box office as $524,000 on 53 screens was lower than expected. The film maintained its pole position in several larger markets including Germany, where the film dropped just 15% to $5.0 million and Austria down just 7% to $1.0 million. More...\n\nAviator Has Icarus-Like Flight\n\nFebruary 27th, 2005\n\nThe Aviator started out Oscar evening extremely well, but it was Million Dollar Baby that won the biggest prizes at the 77th annual Academy Awards. More...\n\nTwelve Tops the Best of the Rest\n\nFebruary 27th, 2005\n\nOcean's Twelve may have dropped out of the top five, but it is still going strong with $4.5 million on 1400 screens in 35 markets for an international box office of $225.8 million so far. No new openings means the heist film had to rely on holdovers likes its $2.5 million during its third weekend in the U.K. and $1.4 million during its fifth week of release in Japan, finishing second in both those markets. More...\n\nSeeing Saw\n\nFebruary 24th, 2005\n\nThe low-budget horror movie, Saw was the top rental this week bringing in $9.47 million in DVD rentals and $1.75 on the VHS side. More...\n\nFrench Film Finishes Fifth\n\nFebruary 20th, 2005\n\nIznogoud: Calife a la place du calife, a movie based on a Asterix and Obelix spin off of sorts, dominated the French box office taking in $7.1 million, more than double the second place film and more than a third of the top ten total. It is also enough to push it into the Top Five on the international scene, dropping Finding Neverland into sixth place. Unfortunately, like the several films made in the Asterix and Obelix series, this one is unlikely to make much of an impact outside the French speaking markets. More...\n\nFockers are Fabulous\n\nFebruary 9th, 2005\n\nA higher than expected opening in Spain and a lower than expected decline in the U.K. allowed Meet the Fockers to retain top spot on the international charts. The film opened first in a handful of markets, including a $4.7 million opening in Spain on 356 screens, $377,000 in Denmark, $352,000 in Taiwan and $275,000 in Israel. Its most prolific market continues to be the U.K. where the film brought in $8.5 million during its second weekend there; that's a 42% drop-off, which is a little high for the market, but not as high as expected given its huge start last weekend. That one market represented more than half of its weekend total of $16.3 million on 1700 screens in 28 markets for a running tally of $82.9 million. More...\n\nDoes the Screen Actors Guild Predict Oscar Glory?\n\nFebruary 5th, 2005\n\nMore than a dozen awards were handed tonight in Los Angeles at the Shrine Exposition Center, and with only five theatrical awards there were more than a few surprises. More...\n\nScreen Actors Guild Gets Its Chance to Shine Tonight\n\nFebruary 5th, 2005\n\nThe 11th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are handed out tonight and while there are numerous awards only five are for theatrical releases. More...\n\nFockers Flatten Competition\n\nFebruary 2nd, 2005\n\nMeet the Fockers open in the U.K. over the weekend with an astounding $14.8 million on 456, which is more than four times the original's earnings there in 2000. That figure was also more than 8 times the second place film , and more than half the market's total box office. Add in a handful of openings in other, mostly smaller markets and the film brought in $19.2 million on 1,700 screens in 15 markets for a $58.8 million total so far. More...\n\nFilms Earn Early Oscars Gold\n\nFebruary 1st, 2005\n\nOscar Nominations gave a box office boost to many films this past weekend while other films are too far into their runs for it to make a difference, (The Motorcycle Diaries) or out of theatres completely, (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.) But of the 35 films that received Oscar Nominations, 17 saw increases in either their overall box office, per theatre average or both. More...\n\nDVD Releases for February 1, 2005\n\nJanuary 31st, 2005\n\nEvery week films get a second chance at success from the home market; or, in some cases, a first chance at success. Here is a list of wide releases, limited releases and a few from the growing TV on DVD section including this week's winner Penn & Teller: Bullshit! - Season 2 - Buy from Amazon and Sealab 2021 - Season 2 - Buy from Amazon and Wonderfalls - The Complete Season - Buy from Amazon and Degrassi Junior High - Season 1 - Buy from Amazon. Wow - busy week. More...\n\nEastwood Wins DGA Award - Becomes Oscars Favorite\n\nJanuary 31st, 2005\n\nOn Saturday, the Directors Guild of America celebrated their 57th annual awards. And while there were many winners, only two awards were for theatrical releases. More...\n\nOcean Steals International Box Office Crown Back\n\nJanuary 26th, 2005\n\nThe International Box Office Race is certainly interesting, as Ocean's Twelve recaptured the lead this weekend with $14.4 million on 4,600 screens in 58 markets and now sits at $170.4 million internationally and $292.8 million worldwide. A large chunk of that total came from Japan, where the film earned $6.8 million (including sneak peaks) on 510 screens, while ending Howl's Moving Castle's nine week reign on top. While this was a strong performance, it was 20% lower that the original's debut in the same market. More...\n\nAll That's Golden Does Not Glitter\n\nJanuary 25th, 2005\n\nOf the eight films that won Golden Globes last weekend, only a handful saw their box office take increase this weekend. This can be partially explained by the snowstorm, and partially by how late in the film's run it was by the time the awards were announced. However, it may also be an indication of the declining influence the awards ceremony has. More...\n\nOscar Nominations Sidestep Box Office Giants\n\nJanuary 25th, 2005\n\nThe Oscar Nominations were announced this morning and at first glance it appears that most of the nominations went to films with smaller budgets and box office results. Box office hits were nearly shut out of the major nominations. More...\n\nAlexander Reigns over International Audiences\n\nJanuary 19th, 2005\n\nAfter a massive opening last week in Spain, Alexander took top spot on the international charts thanks to a strong opening in Italy, Brazil and Hong Kong. The film managed first place in all three markets with $3.87 million on 446 screens in Italy, $906,900 on 193 screens in Brazil and $275,244 on 30 screens in Hong Kong. Holdovers were not as kind to the Sword and Sandal epic as it dropped nearly 50% in the U.K., Spain and France. Overall the film brought in $14.5 million on 3600 screens in 51 markets for a running tally of $88 million. And while the film will easily cross $100 million internationally, which is roughly 3 times its domestic figure, it has to be looked at as a disappointment financially. More...\n\nAviator Soars Above the Rest\n\nJanuary 17th, 2005\n\nThe Golden Globe were handed out tonight with no one film really dominating the night. The Aviator led the night with three awards with a few others films taking home two apiece. More...\n\nTwelve Takes Top Spot\n\nJanuary 12th, 2005\n\nThe race for first in the international marketplace continued to be close with three films within a couple million of each other. Leading the way was Ocean's Twelve with $17.5 million on 5200 screens in 54 markets; the film's international total now sits at $137 million, slightly more than half of what Ocean's Eleven finished with. The heist film did open well in several markets, which mostly balances out severe drop-offs due to the post-holiday. For instance, the film opened well in South Korea with $2.1 million on 150 screens and debuted in first place in Argentina, ($500,000), Portugal, (with $720,000) and in the Philippines, ($370,000.) More...\n\nGold Stocks Rise\n\nDecember 21st, 2004\n\nIt is a week after the Golden Globe nominees were announced and a perfect time to look at the effect, if any, that the acclaim has brought previously released films. More...\n\nSideways is Golden\n\nDecember 14th, 2004\n\nGolden Globe Nominations were announced on Monday and as with the IFP Independent Spirit Awards, Sideways lead the pack with 7 nominations. This does not mean it is the favorite in any particular category, but it does help its chances of taking home some hardware on January 16th. More...\n\nHolidays Coming Early\n\nNovember 12th, 2004\n\nThis weekend also sees the opening of three more films in wide release, (including Polar Express, which opened on Wednesday) and another with opens in just several hundred theatres, but should still finish in the top ten. It's a busy weekend for moviegoers indeed, one reminiscent of the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend. More...\n\nIncredibles were Merely Super\n\nNovember 8th, 2004\n\nThe top film on the charts wasn't as impressive as predicted, but that helped some of the holdovers hold up better. Overall, there was a massive leap from last weekend at 43.8%, but a troubling 5.8% drop from last year. This extended pseudo-slump the box office has been in has cut 2004's lead over 2003 to just 2.1%, $7.641 billion to $7.480 billion. Unless 2004 can close strong, we will see the second year in a row with declining ticket sales. More...\n\nThis Weekend will be Incredible\n\nNovember 5th, 2004\n\nPredicting which movie will finish on top of the charts this weekend is a simple matter. The real question is will The Incredibles break records, and if so, how many. More...\n\nPicking Sides\n\nNovember 2nd, 2004\n\nSideways was again able to top the per theatre average chart this week. Its average of $25,288 was more than double its nearest competitor and was the only film to top the $10,000 mark. More...\n\nHalloween not as Scary as Predicted\n\nNovember 1st, 2004\n\nWith four of the films in the top five beating expectations, this Halloween wasn't as bad as predicted. It was still down about 5.0% from last weekend and 1.5% from last year, but that's not as bad as it could have been. At first glance that's not too bad, however, last year Halloween was on a Friday and there were no new wide releases, which undoubtedly lead to last year under-performing. More...\n\nWill Halloween Scare Away Moviegoers?\n\nOctober 29th, 2004\n\nTraditionally, Halloween is not a good day for the movies, with kids and families staying away from the theatres in order to trick or treat. The only films that really benefit from Halloween are horror films aimed at High School and College students.

Not the dumping ground that September is, but without a major holiday, it's not as prosperous as November. Also, the month is usually good to horror movies for the obvious reason. One last note, the movie industry as a whole is in a bit of a slump right now, of the 11 films that opened wide in September, only 2 will beat expectations by any reasonable degree. This has caused me to downgrade some of my predictions, especially for earlier in the month.
