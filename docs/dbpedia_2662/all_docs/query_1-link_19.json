        "text": "Talking Screens: A Week In Chicago Film, August 9-15, 2024\n\nNew pictures this week include the devised documentary nail-biter “War Game” and magnificent, raucous, riotous Hong Kong action period piece “Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In.”\n\nAlso: Levan Akin’s “Crossing,” a drama of the bonds between Turkish and Georgian culture (opens Friday) and a Friday double feature of Czech master Vera Chytilová’s 2006 “Pleasant Moments“—”Hana is a dedicated psychiatrist who begins to blur the boundaries between her profession and her personal life”—and her 1963 debut, “Something Different” which “interweaves the stories of competitive gymnast Eva and the disillusioned housewife Vera.” Streaming from Friday on Apple+: protean director Doug Liman’s heist comedy “The Instigators,” with Matt Damon and co-writer Casey Affleck, Michael Stuhlbarg, Paul Walter Hauser, Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, Toby Jones and Ron Perlman.\n\nBefore taking a few weeks off starting August 12 to rebuild its main auditorium, the Music Box continues its “Summer of 70mm,” with a version of “North By Northwest,” converted from VistaVision, in its 70mm debut; and Walter Hill’s bold, bravura retelling of the story of Helen of Troy, “Streets Of Fire” (in a print with magnetic soundtrack for the original 1984 release). More on Hill’s film below. “In the booth, 70mm gets the museum treatment: projectors are scrutinized for any potential sources of print damage, our insurance company is notified that precious cargo is being shipped, and image and sound are calibrated to exacting standards. For a format known for its mightiness, 70mm prints are exceedingly delicate and require the same handling care as a newborn baby,” the Music Box attests. Details and tickets here.\n\nPlus: Facets and Kartemquin prep for the Democratic convention with “Filmmakers On The DNC: From 1968 To Now,” including a conversation with two veteran filmmakers who were there, Gordon Quinn and Andrew Davis; the digitization of Bill Stamets’ Chicago history Super 8 soundies gets funded; and Chicago International Film Festival’s CIX: Lab offers a Zoom introduction to their work with the filmmaking community. (More on these below.)\n\nOPENERS\n\nJanuary 6: but worse. The relentless, enthralling nonfiction thriller “War Game,” devised and directed by Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber, is a heroic slab of narrative construction, improvisation, theater and political narrative, mounting within constructed sets a six-hour war game that dramatizes what could occur if another January 6 were attempted by malign politicians and their followers. The clock ticks; the moment bristles; dozens of faces and figures, most of whom are veterans of politics or the military. The exercise was already in the works from the Vet Voice Foundation, and the filmmakers seized the opportunity to capture, live, the six hours of simulated violent treachery. Vet Voice: “convened a bipartisan group of U.S. defense, intelligence, and elected policymakers spanning five presidential administrations,” they write, “to participate in an unscripted role-play exercise in which they confronted a political coup backed by rogue members of the U.S. military, in the wake of a contested presidential election.” It’s never a lesson but always a caution. Moss tells Filmmaker, “We were negotiating our access, conceptualizing the film, building the team, figuring out the logistics and raising money, which was really difficult… But I thought this was an extraordinary opportunity, this combination of improvisational theater, documentary and dystopian science fiction. Tony and I looked at Peter Watkins [“Punishment Park,” “La Commune,” “The War Game”] and [stage director] Ivo van Hove’s theater work as references, but the thing itself felt unknown, and that was exciting. It was a tremendous leap of faith and we had very little time, but sometimes it helps to have a ticking clock. The players had six hours, we had about twelve weeks and I loved it.” The film tears at speed across its ninety-minute duration. “I think of filmmaking as a kind of levitation act,” says Moss. A Sundance 2024 selection. More on the film here. “War Game” opens Friday, August 9 at Siskel.\n\nThe demolition of the impossible mass of Hong Kong’s walled city of Kowloon was completed in 1994, a couple of years before the first time I visited the colony and was still awed by other, remaining zones, teeming spaces like Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. The overcrowded, unsafe runnels and lawless warrens of the six-and-a-half acre home to 35,000 residents seem impossible to imagine today, but beyond historical records like location work in the insurgent, vital Hong Kong cinema of the late twentieth century, we can feast our eyes on Soi Cheang’s big-budget, old-school, neo-noir martial arts locomotive, “Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In.” The slow passing of local cinema’s best years after the 1997 handover left behind much melancholy and only a few filmmakers like Johnnie To who stuck to the narrow streets and myriad islands of the territory. But there have been few hyperkinetic action pictures of this scale that resist a latter-day Chinese identity with such sweet ferocity. The topography of the central city and 1980s movie iconography, both of a lost time, are delineated with immaculate imagination. The story’s melodramatic complications are disposable, but the action tableaux are like city buses, wait five minutes and another one comes along. Sammo Hung, Raymond Lam, Philip Ng, Louis Koo and other performers are there to accelerate the ride. It’s a bittersweet dystopian canvas, but also the purest action machine built on the choreographed denial of physics since the blunderbuss that is “RRR.” The milieu and the many martial moments are glorious. “Twilight Of The Warriors: Walled In” opens Friday, August 9 at River East, Drafthouse and outlying screens.\n\nREPERTORY & REVIVAL\n\nWalter Hill’s baroque 1984 street-level superhero musical “Streets of Fire” releases its narcotic gas in large format: “The following story takes place in the Other World,” begins the unpublished screenplay for Walter Hill’s 1984 “Streets of Fire,” shot, with great hope, under the title, “The Adventures of Tom Cody: Book One.” “A far off place”—partially shot under Chicago’s El tracks—“where genres collide—in this case, Futuristic Fantasy meets the Western, gets married and has Rock and Roll babies. And in a rather special way, it’s meant to be a comedy.” Yes, this caterwauling rampage of a movie was produced “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”: the 1980s. (The influence of this blissfully berserk production on generations of anime has begun to be explored and explicated by those in the know.) Co-written with Larry Gross, ‘Streets of Fire” is a grandiloquent compatriot to their later masterpiece, “Geronimo: An American Legend” (1993) and more pertinently, their collaboration on 1982’s “48 Hrs,” which enabled the lurid finery of Hill’s seventh feature. More exuberantly stylized than “The Warriors” (1979), it seemingly stands in stark relief to the carborundum asperity of movies like “Hard Times” (1975), “The Driver” (1978), “The Long Riders” (1980) and “Southern Comfort” (1981).\n\nYet, along with its willingness to go for baroque at every turn in its boisterous, feverish retelling of the Helen of Troy myth, “Streets of Fire” elevates the estimable craft of those movies in a vivid, grimy, neon-draped palette, with expressive, classical framing in both wide and closer shots, an unerring instinct for when to cut (and slash) a shot or scene, and simple joy in humans and machines in motion and the splendor of noise. It’s lunar, unearthly, magnificent, bought with the success of “48 Hrs,” but handed down with its own unbridled glee, as in, “Can you believe we’re getting away with this shit?” “Streets Of Fire” (7omm) plays at the Music Box, Friday, August 9, 10pm and Sunday, August 11, 8:30pm.\n\nCHICAGO SEEN\n\nFacets and Kartemquin present “Filmmakers On The DNC: From 1968 To Now,” a weekend of activism on film. A panel of that title is Friday, August 9, 7pm, featuring filmmakers Gordon Quinn and Andrew Davis (via Zoom) in conversation, moderated by former Chicago Film Office head Rich Moskal. Quinn and Davis were both in Chicago; some of Davis’ footage is in “Medium Cool” as well as documentaries on that moment. Relevant clips will be shown as well. On Saturday, August 10, 1pm, a screening of “Hard To Swallow,” followed at 6pm by screenings of Kartemquin’s “Viva La Causa” and “Golub.” An “Artivism” panel takes place Sunday, August 11 at 2pm. Filmmaker Gordon Quinn will be joined by director Ruth Leitman, Field Museum media producer Latoya Flowers, communications strategist and creative director Essence McDowell and sculptor and community organizer Sonja Henderson.\n\nChicago Film Archives has gotten a $44,000 grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources to outsource the digitization of veteran Chicago filmmaker Bill Stamets’ magnetic sound films. The project will start in September and CFA will have a year to complete the digitization and cataloging. Charles Henry, president of CLIR, writes, “These projects represent a crucial effort to bring to light the rich histories and cultural contributions of communities that have long been marginalized. It is more important than ever to ensure that these voices are not only preserved but also celebrated and integrated into our collective narrative. By digitizing these collections, we are bridging gaps in historical knowledge and promoting a more equitable representation of our diverse society.” More here."
