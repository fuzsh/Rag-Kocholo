Applicants can use other \"high level\" personnel from the production (e.g. director, editor, etc.) to provide verification of work performed. Listing references that can comment on your experience and your production work significantly speeds up the application process.\n\nAny individual serving in a representative capacity or is employed by the applicant, cannot serve as a reference (e.g. agent, manager, entertainment attorney, etc.)\n\nREMINDER TO APPLICANTS: Ensure your references are aware they’ve been selected. Individuals who are unaware that they are references, more often than not, do not reply to inquiries from the PGA. This can either significantly delay the application process or lead to a denial of your application.\n\nBIO & RESUME\n\nIn addition to providing credits for consideration, applicants are required to upload and submit a bio and resume. With the exception of those working in new and emerging media, there is no specific format required but your bio and resume should be more than a simple printout from IMDb. These documents allow individuals to communicate any aspect about their work not covered in other areas of their application and will assist the Guild in arriving at a determination.\n\nFor applicants who exclusively or primarily work in new and emerging media, your resume must include a list of all released/launched projects and credits from the last five (5) years, with these categories of information:\n\nYear of release/launch\n\nTitle of the project/production\n\nCredit received\n\nFormat (e.g. XR/VR/AR, special venue, video game, digital short, etc)\n\nForm of distribution/exhibition (e.g. platform, console, website, etc) *\n\n# of episodes (if applicable)\n\nRunning time (if applicable) - Or cumulative running time of all episodes combined\n\nURL (if available)\n\n*How and where the audience views/consumes/experiences your work.\n\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS\n\nUpon receipt of all materials your application will be processed and your credits will be vetted by the PGA staff. MEMBERSHIP DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE GUILD'S SOLE DISCRETION AND ARE NOT AUTOMATIC. Our goal is to have a decision within 30-90 days.\n\nYour submission is checked to make sure you've sent in all requested information in accordance with the application instructions. Applications must be accompanied by a bio & resume and payment for the application fee, initiation fee, and annual dues. Applications missing any of these items are considered incomplete and will not be processed.\n\nPGA Staff checks your credits against the membership requirements to ensure the minimum criteria has been met. Your role and responsibilities, job duties, and experience are evaluated and confirmed based on comments and feedback from inquiries sent to your references, along with information from other third-party sources. Additional information and documentation may be requested in order to demonstrate the applicant’s execution of functions and responsibilities of a Producer as defined by the PGA. Due to the evolving nature of media and content, the PGA has broad discretion when evaluating applicants for potential membership. Upon completion of your credits evaluation, you will receive an email from the Guild notifying you of our determination.\n\nIf you're denied membership, you will be notified by the Director of Membership and all fees paid will be refunded (with the exception of the non-refundable application fee). If you are denied membership this does not restrict you from applying in the future. Should your credits or professional experience change, the PGA encourages you to reapply for membership.\n\nIf you’ve been approved, the first of three emails you'll receive is an official welcome from the PGA Presidents. Two additional emails will follow from the Director of Membership with helpful information on how to jump start your involvement and an invitation to the quarterly New Member Orientation. In addition, you will immediately start receiving a variety of PGA communications announcing upcoming PGA activities, events, and seminars, and granted full access to your PGA profile within our online Community Hub.\n\nMEMBERSHIP COST\n\nThe total amount to join is $1050 which covers the following:\n\nNote: Should your membership be terminated in the future, the app fee, initiation fee, and annual dues will be paid again when reapplying for membership.\n\nAny questions? Send us an email at applications@producersguild.org for further assistance."
