        "text": "What does an X-ray room consist of?\n\nAn x-ray room structurally consists of an exam room, control room, lead-lined door, lead-lined walls, and lead-lined glass window. It comes in different sizes, ranging from 10'x10', 12'x16', and larger.\n\nRad room configuration and equipment will heavily depend on the type of X-ray equipment your facility has. Features may include an on-light, generator, positioners, workstation, detector charger, lead vests, lead skirts, and apron racks.\n\nPlease note that each state has unique laws surrounding lead shielding.\n\nTo help, you can download the list we've compiled of Radiological and Health Department Links by State to direct your search.\n\nDR\n\nDigital radiography (DR) uses flat panel detectors to produce a digital image. Unlike traditional X-ray methods that require film development in a darkroom, digital radiography provides instant access to clear and detailed digital X-ray images.\n\nEven though DR systems come with a higher initial investment, they often result in lower long-term expenses due to their minimal maintenance requirements.\n\nHigh-resolution image quality\n\nFully digitized configuration\n\nSwift image viewing (within 1 minute)\n\nLimited portability unless utilizing newer wireless systems\n\nReduced risk of overexposure to radiation\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency breaks down the features and benefits of digital radiology and how these advancements are improving medical services.\n\nCR\n\nComputed Radiography or CR is replacing traditional film radiography. CR systems use cassette-based phosphor storage plates (PSP) to capture images. These systems tend to be more cost-effective as they have a lower initial investment then digital radiography. While you gain flexibility, your image quality will not be as high-resolution. Overall, here are a few features to keep in mind with a CR based system.\n\nLower-resolution images\n\nMore labor-intensive due to plate storage and transfer\n\nBulky design\n\nIncreased portability and flexibility\n\nIncreased risk of radiation over-exposure\n\nProne to damage and requires more maintenance\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of computed radiography, click here to learn more!\n\nFREE DIGITAL X-RAY CONVERSION GUIDE\n\nExplore the possibilities for transitioning your analog X-ray system to a digital format. Use this step-by-step guide to learn how your analog X-ray equipment can produce crisp, convenient digital images.\n\nYou'll discover:\n\n• Three methods for going digital\n\n• Pros and cons of each method\n\n• Average costs for each method\n\nClick the button below to become an X-ray expert - no contact information is required!"
