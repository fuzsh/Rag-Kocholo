        "text": "A new film about the troubled singer Ray Charles's life features an extraordinary Oscar-tipped performance from Jamie Foxx. John Hiscock meets him, and talks to the director of a movie that was 17 years in the making\n\nThe actor had nervously gone to the singer's studios in a scruffy part of Los Angeles in the summer of 2002 to present himself as the person who would be portraying Charles on screen in writer-director Taylor Hackford's Ray. \"The first words he said to me were, 'C'mere, boy,'\" Foxx recalls. \"He grabs me, checks out my hands and says, 'Oh yeah, I love this. Got those strong fingers.'\n\n\"So we got straight to the piano and he says, 'Jamie, if you can sing the blues, you can do anything.'\" Foxx is an accomplished pianist and he had no difficulty joining Charles in a medley of blues standards. But then Charles switched to Thelonius Monk and suddenly Foxx was struggling. \"It was a musical obstacle course,\" he laughs. \"Monk is complex and intricate and I remember I hit a wrong note and he stopped and said, 'Now why the hell would you do that? The notes are right underneath your fingers. You just got to take a second and find them.'\n\n\"I knew he was talking about more than music and I used that metaphor through the whole film: the notes in life for us are right underneath our fingers as long as we take the time to find the right ones. I think that with this movie we took the time to find the right notes to make it come together.\"\n\nThe time Foxx, 37, spent with Charles was well worth while. On screen he completely masters Charles's leg-swinging gait, his open-mouthed smile, and his speech pattern, but one gets the sense that he is not just pretending to be Ray Charles, but that he understands him completely. It is a galvanising performance that will assuredly win Foxx an Oscar nomination and, following his fine portrayal of the taxi driver in Collateral, confirms him as one of the most gifted actors working in Hollywood.\n\nAfter his initial meeting, he shrewdly decided to ignore Hackford's advice to spend a lot of time with Charles, because he wanted to capture the essence of the singer as a young man. Quincy Jones gave him a cassette tape of Charles when he appeared on the Dinah Shore Show 35 years ago. \"He was young, he was energetic and really on his music, so we took that DNA and we just spread it all the way through the script, from when he was 19, all the way up until he was 65,\" he says.\n\nHe wore prosthetics in his eyes to understand Charles's blindness and it brought home to him probably more than anything else what Charles's life was like.\n\n\"It's like diving into a cold pool and then you get used to it,\" he said. \"My hearing intensified. Sometimes I take playing the piano for granted because I'm a showy person and I'm looking at other people, but when you don't have sight you get more into the music. It's more intense so you can understand why Ray was moving that way.\"\n\nHe also found himself alone sometimes, when the cast and crew would go for lunch and not tell him, forgetting that he could not see them leave. \"I was experiencing having to take people's word for things,\" he says. \"If Ray Charles was playing at a place, he didn't know if there were 3,000 or 30,000 people there. He had to take somebody's word for it and that was his whole life.\"\n\nExuberant and outgoing, Foxx loves to talk, laugh and tell stories. He is an avid party-goer and is plainly enjoying his new fame immensely. When we meet he is wearing a T-shirt from the film Ali, in which he had played Ali's longtime friend Bundini Brown, and laughingly recounts tales from his early days in showbusiness when he was doing impersonations at comedy clubs' amateur nights. \"I would do impersonations of Bill Cosby and Mike Tyson and I was the only black kid doing Ronald Reagan at the time.\"\n\nHis break came when he landed a regular role in the television show In Living Colour. He later ventured into dramatic territory when Oliver Stone cast him as a nervous third-string quarterback who becomes an overnight sensation in Any Given Sunday. His strong performance in Collateral made him a leading man and the actor to bring Taylor Hackford's long-planned vision to life.\n\nThe film does not sanitise Charles, and in dealing with 40 years of his life it portrays his womanising, his heroin habit and the deep wounds to his psyche caused by witnessing his brother's death and then losing his sight at the age of seven.\n\nHackford, 59, realised that any film about Ray Charles had to be warts-and-all. To his surprise, Charles agreed. But then problems arose that would take Hackford, director of a film about Chuck Berry and producer of the Ritchie Valens biopic La Bamba, almost 17 years to surmount.\n\n\"When I produced La Bamba,\" he says, \"it was a low-budget film because Ritchie Valens's career was 18 months and it took place mostly in Southern California. He had a couple of big gigs and then he died. I could make it for $5 million. The problem with Ray Charles's life is that once he got on that bus in northern Florida as a teenager he never stopped moving. He went everywhere, all over the United States and all over the world, so you have to tell a story that gives a sense of that.\n\n\"Then there was his complicated nature, his womanising, his drug addiction – all of those things needed to be seen in this film to really make it work.\"\n\nBecause of the budget – it was eventually made for $40 million (£22 million) – and the dark material, no studio would contemplate taking on the project. He was told that Charles's story was too black to appeal to white audiences; too old-fashioned to appeal to the hip-hop crowd; it was unlikely to make any money overseas; Ali had just come out and failed at the box-office and anyway, biographies belonged on television.\n\n\"There was so much resistance in Hollywood,\" he recalls. \"All I got was 'No, no, no.' Nobody wanted to make the picture.\"\n\nBut he wrote a treatment anyway and then was forced to put it aside to take on other projects. He directed Dolores Claiborne, The Devil's Advocate and Proof of Life, produced several films for other people and, on New Year's Eve 1997, married actress Helen Mirren, his companion since 1985.\n\nHe returned to Ray in 2002 and, with Foxx tentatively on board and a complete screenplay written with James L White, he finally found an unlikely financier in Philip Anschutz, an evangelical Presbyterian and moral conservative who has invested heavily in a variety of family-friendly films, most notably the flop Around the World In 80 Days.\n\nThe press-shy Anschutz, who has not given an interview since 1976, turned out to be a huge fan of Ray Charles, which was why he was willing to finance a film about an inveterate womaniser and heroin addict. He did, however, impose the condition that the film had to do without the kind of salty language viewed as commonplace among musicians of the time.\n\nHackford initially rebelled, but when Charles surprisingly agreed with Anschutz, pointing out that black men at the time did not curse a lot, especially in public, Hackford relented.\n\n\"We had known for a while that Ray wasn't doing well and that he wasn't going to make it, but even knowing that, it was tough for everybody,\" says Foxx. \"He got a chance to see a rough cut of it, so in a sense he got his flowers before he left. If he was here, he'd probably be saying, 'What's all the hubbub about? Let's get on with everything.'\""
