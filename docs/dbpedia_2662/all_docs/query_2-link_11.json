        "text": "Academic Requirements\n\nScottish Highers — 3 passes (grade D or above).\n\nA Levels — 2 passes.\n\nInternational Baccalaureate — minimum score of 24 with 3 subjects at Higher Level.\n\nRecognised equivalences (EU and International Entry Requirements).\n\nWe welcome the Scottish Baccalaureate and will accept Highers and Advanced Highers combinations.\n\nWe offer a flexible approach to students taking Higher over more than one academic year and who achieve their qualifications in more than one sitting.\n\nEnglish language requirements\n\nThe language of study at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) is English. All applicants whose first language is not English will be required to provide evidence that their English language level meets the entrance requirements.\n\nThe required IELTS level for this programme is 6.5 overall with a minimum score of 5.5 in each component. Full details of all the English tests we can accept can be found on our English Language Requirements page.\n\nDirect entry\n\nApplications for direct entry beyond Year 1 will be considered on a case-by-case basis and by the Royal Conservatoire’s Recognition of Prior (Experiential) Learning policy. If you wish to apply for direct entry, please mark the entry point on the UCAS Conservatoires application as 2 or 3.\n\nTuition fees\n\nScotland: £1,820 (for most full-time, Scottish-domiciled undergraduate students, this will be paid by SAAS. More information is available on our Fees & Funding pages)\n\nRUK: £9,250\n\nInternational (including EU): £27,968\n\nFunding & Scholarships\n\nYou can find out about the funding and scholarships available for studying at RCS by visiting our dedicated page:\n\nFunding & Scholarships\n\nCost of Living & Programme Costs\n\nIn addition to tuition fees, it is estimated that you will need between £11,200 and £15,300 per year to live in Glasgow, plus programme costs. Much will depend on your lifestyle and whether your course runs for three or four terms.\n\nUndergraduate Programmes within the School of Drama, Dance, Production and Film have a range of associated costs related to the specific activities required and advised by the programme team. To ensure fairness and parity of experience concerning certain core programme activities a one-off payment to cover a proportion of necessary costs is required of the student at matriculation. You can find these costs in the pdf below:\n\nBA Filmmaking Programme Costs\n\nApply via UCAS\n\nApplications are made through the UCAS website. You can read our guidance about using UCAS on our dedicated How to Apply page.\n\nApplicants will also be required to create an Acceptd account when they apply, which will be used for scheduling auditions. More information about this process will be available soon.\n\nWe do not offer deferred entry. If you wish to commence in 2026, you must apply next year.\n\nThe Royal Conservatoire of Scotland institution code is R68. You will also require the following programme code to apply: BA Filmmaking – 200F\n\nThe closing date for all on-time BA Filmmaking applications is 29 January 2025. If you submit your application after this date, we cannot guarantee that the audition panel will review your application. If you do want to submit a late application, you must contact admissions@rcs.ac.uk in the first instance to check we are accepting late applications.\n\nApplication/Audition fees\n\nThere is a UCAS Conservatoires application fee of £27.50. In addition to the application fee, each conservatoire charges an audition/interview assessment administration fee. The interview assessment administration fee is £55 for this programme. Fees are not refundable. The fees are paid via the UCAS website and not directly to RCS.\n\nWe recognise that auditioning and interviewing for conservatoires, drama and ballet schools can be costly. The audition assessment administration fee allows us to offer a thorough and positive experience to all applicants. We encourage you to get in touch to ask the panel questions and find out more about the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to see if it is the best place for you.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring fair access to a conservatoire education for students who have the talent and potential to benefit from it, regardless of their background. In support of this, audition fee waivers are offered to applicants whose financial hardship may be a barrier to auditioning. Please see the audition fee waiver document for more information.\n\nWe are the only place in Europe where you can study all of the performing arts on the one campus. There is a distinctive creative energy at RCS and you’ll be made to feel part of our inclusive and diverse environment from the very beginning of your studies.\n\nOur graduates are resourceful, highly employable and members of a dynamic community of artists who make a significant impact across the globe.\n\nAt RCS, students develop not just their art but their power to use it.\n\nWhy RCS"
