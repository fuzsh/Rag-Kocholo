        "text": "Description\n\nIn 1890, the first assigned Maronite Catholic missionary arrived in New York City. Like many Lebanese immigrants, he brought with him his faith and the hope of building a better tomorrow.\n\nNow, modern-day parishioners can read about the complete history of the Maronite Church in America in a new book called History of the Maronite Catholic Church in the United States, Volume I, The Clergy. Five years of extensive research were needed to unearth never-before published documents and to translate historical records and correspondence from their original French or Arabic into English. To further understand the evolution of the Church, the authors also analyzed interviews conducted with parishioners and pastors over the past seventy years.\n\nThis 440-page book is an essential addition to the bookshelf of any Maronite curious about the contributions our Church has made over the last 125 years."
