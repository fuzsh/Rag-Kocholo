        "text": "After Saint Maron’s death his followers founded a religious Christian movement that known as Maronites, which would later become the Maronite Church.\n\nThe Maronite movement would reach Lebanon through his first disciple Abraham of Cyrrhus, who moved there as missionary, and was known as the Apostle of Lebanon. Saint Maron’s saintly life and his miracles attracted many followers from across the Levant. In sacred Christian art Saint Maron is often represented portrayed kneeling in prayer or standing wearing a black monastic habit with a hanging stole, holding a long Episcopal crosier staffed by a globe which is surmounted by the bifid Maronite cross in his right hand, and a miniature church maquette in his left hand.\n\nOur Christian family belongs to the Antiochian Catholic rite that continues to celebrate its millenary Syriac Aramaic tradition. The Antiochian rite, of which the Maronite Church is part, dates back to the 5th century Antioch and Jerusalem, from where is expanded throughout Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and in the 17th century to the southwestern Indian coast where a Syro-Malabar Church was founded. The Maronite Church is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See of Rome, and is the third largest of the Eastern or Oriental Catholic churches that has no non-Catholic counterpart. On February 9, 2011, His Holiness Pope Benedict the XVI celebrated the 1600th Anniversary of the existence of the Maronites as a confirmation of the full communion of the Maronite Church with the Holy See of Rome, and blessed the Statue of Saint Maron during a massive ceremony: the 12th and last statue to be placed on the walls of the Vatican.\n\nThe immediate spiritual head of the Maronite Church after the Pope is the “Patriarch of Antioch and all the East,” who is presently Mar Beshara Boutros al-Rai, residing in Bkerki, in the Casa of Kesrouan, in Lebanon. The church retains the ancient West Syrian liturgy today, even though the vernacular tongue of the Maronites is Arabic. After the Second Vatican Council the Maronites were freed of papal efforts to Latinize their rite.\n\nMaronites of the expansion today are also found in southern Europe and North and South America, having emigrated in the 19th century under the pressure of persecutions. Wherever they go, Maronites maintain and celebrate their own liturgy, traditions and culture and have their own clergy, some of whom are married."
