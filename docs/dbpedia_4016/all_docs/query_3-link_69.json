        "text": "STS. PETER AND PAUL CATHOLIC CHURCH HISTORY\n\nThe Catholic Church is one, with the same faith, under the same Pope, and with the same sacraments. Yet at the same time, it is both Eastern and Western, it's two lungs with which it breathes the breath of the Holy Spirit, as Pope John Paul II frequently reminded us. Between East and West, the Catholic Church has twenty-two different Rites in which the Mass and other sacraments are celebrated.\n\nThe Western Catholic Church mainly celebrates in the Roman Rite, which is one of these twenty-two Rites. The Eastern Catholic Church, on the other hand, celebrates the liturgy in several Rites such as the Byzantine, the Armenian, the Melkite, and the Maronite, among others.\n\nSts. Peter and Paul Church in Tampa is an Eastern Catholic Church of the Maronite Rite. The Maronite Church originated in Antioch when St. Peter founded the Church there. Eventually, this group of Middle Eastern Catholics, mainly from Lebanon, became known as \"Maronite,\" the name deriving from the holy Syrian monk St. Maron (died 410 AD).\n\nJune 1, 2018 -\n\nFr.

Elections for five members of the Presbyteral Council, divided proportionally by years of ordination, took place at the Clergy Conference held June 29-July 2, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOctober 2008 – May 31, 2009:\n\nFr.
