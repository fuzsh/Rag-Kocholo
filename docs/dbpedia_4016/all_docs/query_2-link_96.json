        "text": "Posted By: DTBrown What's in a name? Who are we? - 06:19 AM\n\nThere are several different ways we are called. Some call us \"Greek Catholics\" (I once read it was Empress Maria Theresa who coined the term...perhaps that's an apocryphal tale...I don't know.) Fifty years ago the term \"Byzantine Catholic\" came into vogue. Certainly, we have a Catholic identity as we are part of the one, holy and catholic, and apostolic Church. But, are we really \"Greek\" or\"Byzantine\"? Are these not artificial terms?\n\nIf we look at our liturgy not only are we Catholic but we are also Orthodox. The liturgy calls us Orthodox. Let me not be misunderstood. Many solely identify the term \"Orthodox\" with that part of the Church which rejects the primacy of Rome. Those commonly called \"Orthodox\" sometimes take offense at those of us who use the term \"Orthodox in union with Rome.\" I am not suggesting the term \"Orthodox\" in those ways. But, I think it is important we affirm what the liturgy calls us...and not mistranslate the phrase \"Orthodox Christians\" to \"all you Christians of the true faith.\"\n\nInstead of \"Greek Catholic\" or the very recent \"Byzantine Catholic,\" why shouldn't we be called \"Orthodox Catholics\"? It would affirm our heritage without resorting to an artificial name. It would also clarify that we are, sadly, not in full communion with our mother churches of the East but still proud of our heritage.\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\nDave,\n\nAgreed on just about all counts. I�ve written before that �Byzantine� is artificial-sounding and in fact is a recent invention. The Ruthenians in the US officially began using it in the 1950s; the old moniker still used in Slovakia and Ukraine is �Greek Catholic�. But there haven�t been any Byzantines around since the 1400s and even they didn�t call themselves that but rather Romaioi, �Romans�. �Greek� makes it sound like you all have baklava and bouzouki music at church festivals (and ouzo at the Sportsmen�s Club bar). Like you I wince at the Ruthenians� studied avoidance of the word �Orthodox�. It sounds, well, so fake, like they�re trying to hide or distort history.\n\nSo I agree: come up with a name that acknowledges your Churches came from the Orthodox and hopefully one day will be reunited with them. Something that acknowledges the pain caused by creating the Eastern Catholic groups at the Orthodox� expense (a mistake, certainly in the long run) but also points the way to an eventual true restoration of communion, not a false union. �Orthodox in communion with Rome� is my favorite but it upsets the Orthodox and is too long to use comfortably anyway. (Test-marketing the expression with a born Ruthenian girlfriend once didn�t get a positive response either.) And �Orthodox Catholic� already is taken by 1) the Orthodox and 2) traditional (Tridentine) and especially conservative (Novus Ordo but sound) Roman Catholics.\n\nSo as I see it, you need to come up with a more user-friendly (shorter) version of �Orthodox in communion with Rome�.\n\n<a href=\"http://oldworldrus.com\">Old World Rus�</a>\n\n[This message has been edited by Rusnak (edited 11-13-2000).]\n\nPosted By: DTBrown Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 02:27 PM\n\nYes, some conservative Roman Catholics use the term \"orthodox Catholic\" (usually with the small \"o\") to describe themselves. But, as far as I know none of them have that on the signs in front of their parishes. What I'm proposing, for example, is that instead of \"St Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church\" we would have \"St Nicholas Orthodox Catholic Church\" on a sign in front of one of our churches.\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\n[This message has been edited by DTBrown (edited 11-13-2000).]\n\nHmmm... the sign in front of my church says \"Holy Cross Melkite Greek Catholic Church\" -- but then, we're Melkites! One could even say we don't know who we are since, originally, the Melkites were part of the Syrian Church and slowly adopted the Byzantine practices.\n\nThe local Maronite church has a sign that reads \"St. John Maron Maronite Catholic Church.\"\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nEdward, deacon and sinner\n\nDave,\n\nWhat I'm proposing, for example, is that instead of �St Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church� we would have �St Nicholas Orthodox Catholic Church� on a sign in front of one of our churches.\n\nI like it!

Who are we? - 06:47 PM\n\nQuote\n\nPre-Schism, the East already went by Orthodox and the West by Catholic, but\n\nthere was only one communion.\n\nWhat is your reference for this? Up until the Reformation, the term \"Catholic\" was far from the common proper name for the Church. It was simply called \"The Church\". The occasional use of the term \"Catholic\" occurred, but just to make th distinction between a particular church and the universal church.\n\nThe pre-schism Christians of the East never used the term \"Orthodox\" to indicate themselves and their particular traditions as distinct from the Latin West. The term was employed to differentiate Latin-Greek Christians from the \"unorthodox\" Syrian, Coptic and Persian Christians. After the schism, it was then also applied to the \"heretical\" Latins as well.\n\nIt still do not understand why a new term should be adopted by the Byzantine Catholic Church that we know will antagonize the Orthodox. Is this ecumencial sensitivity?\n\nK.\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 08:23 PM\n\n>>>I like it! But the Johnstown Diocese and some older OCA Orthodox churches (also Ruthenians, as many\n\nhere know) do the same thing. <<<\n\nIn fact, until relatively late in the day, the Ruthenian Churches were known as Orthodox Catholic--as can be seen by looking at the covers of some of the 17th-18th century trebniks published in Uzhorod and Mucachevo. And since, until we started celebrating in English, we called ourselves \"Pravoslavie Khristianje\", I see no reason why we should not call ourselves the same in English.\n\nThe Ruthenian phobia against the \"O\" word is as silly as the Orthodox phobia concerning the \"I\" word.\n\nPosted By: DTBrown Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 12:46 AM\n\nKurt,\n\nHow is it that we are not Orthodox? You don't seriously believe that \"Christians of the true faith\" is the original intended meaning of the prayer at the Great Entrance, do you? Or when in the Litury of St Basil the priest prays for all \"right-believing Bishops\" (Ruthenian version) is not the plain meaning \"Orthodox Bishops\"?\n\nThe Western Liturgy also uses \"Orthodox\" to describe the faithful. From a Catholic perspective the Roman Church is also an Orthodox Church. There are plenty of references in the early Church where the faithful are referred to as \"Orthodox\" as well.\n\nIn the Creed, however, the term is \"Catholic\" and that is the primary name for the Church. We often use qualifiers...such as Roman Catholic or Maronite Catholic, etc. I'm asking why we should use Byzantine instead of our historical name \"Orthodox\"? I remember reading a post from Fr Petras on CINEAST where he mentioned that it was Ruthenians shortly after the Union who inserted \"Orthodox\" into the prayer at the Great Entrance which from there found its way into the Slavic Churches (the Greek and Antiochian Churches do not use \"Orthodox\" in the Great Entrance prayer).\n\nAsking if Eastern Orthodox would be offended by our use of the term is like saying we should not use \"Catholic\" either because some of them view themselves as the Catholic Church. I know of some Orthodox who won't even say \"Roman Catholic\" but insist on other terminology because they won't accord the Church of Rome the designation \"Catholic.\" Fortunately, such are rare but they do exist.\n\nI would suggest to Kurt to consider the approach of the Melkite Church. The earlier versions of _Byzantine Daily MIssal_ avoided the term \"Orthodox.\" The current edition (_Byzantine Daily Worship_) restores the designation. The use of \"Orthodox\" by Eastern Catholics goes back at least 30 years! The English translation used by the Ukrainian Church uses \"orthodox Christians\" at the Great Entrance.\n\nOur avoidance of \"Orthodox\" and the use of \"Christains of the true faith\" is an embarrasment. It's akin to those churches which have changed the Creed to \"one, holy, Christian and apostolic Church\" to avoid saying \"Catholic.\"\n\nI say it's high time we restore the term \"Orthodox\" to a place of honor in our Churches!\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 12:53 AM\n\nDave,\n\nOnce your church becomes Orthodox again, then at that moment feel free to call yourself and your church Orthodox in the fullest sense. For now, you have no claim until your church is fully restored.\n\nPosted By: DTBrown Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 12:58 AM\n\nRobert,\n\nI have no objection to your Church using the term \"Catholic.\"\n\nDo you object as well to the Melkite use of \"Orthodox\" as in _Byzantine Daily Worship_?\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 01:30 AM\n\nDear Brother and Sisters,\n\nChrist is in Our Midst!\n\nBoth Eastern Orthodox Christians (not in communion with Rome) and the Western Catholics have used and continue to use the terms Orthodox and Catholic in their formal Titles.\n\nIt was by convenience that the Eastern Orthodox Christians began to use Eastern Orthodox Church as a way to differentiate them primarily in the West from the Western Catholics who were known as \"Roman Catholics\" .\n\nIn many of my books that I had as I was studying Greek Orthodoxy to become An Eastern Orthodox Christian, the Church was called the Holy Orthodox and Catholic Church. I was informed that in all Orthodox countries that was the title of the church and that the national nomenclature [Greek, Russian, Serbian, Antiochian was an appelation to identify your hierarchs you fell under in a multijursidictional area in the diaspora (US, Canada, Australia, England, Brazil,etc)].\n\nThose in communion with the Western Catholics were most prominently known in the East as Latin Church or Latin Catholics. As I understand it in the countries with multiple churches in the west the Latin Church came to be known as the Roman Catholic Church--- a name that the church has encouraged to be used. Itially all other groups in the church not using latin were known as \"Rites\"--- as the terms of association have changed somewhat after Vatican II, these rites have sought to identify themselves more with their Mother (National) Churches. Now the desire of some to call themselves Orthodox blurs the way that visiting \"Eastern Orthodox (not in communion with Rome--NICR)\" identify the churches that they may commune fully within.\n\nThis will present a new problem for the churches in union with Rome --- once again they will appear to the Eastern Orthodox (NICR) to be try to convert Eastern Orthodox (NICR)to Roman Catholicism thru subterfuge.\n\nAgain a new block to the restoration of full communion between two sister churches is thrown up by the very church that is seeking to facilitate the opening of full communion. How do you suppose to handle closure on this issue?\n\nYour brother in Christ,\n\nThomas\n\n[This message has been edited by Thomas (edited 11-13-2000).]\n\nPosted By: Medved Re: What's in a name?

Who are we? - 03:26 AM\n\nThomas,\n\nThis is the old \"uniates are Rome's way of converting Orthodox\" red herring. No matter how loudly we state this is no longer our rationale for existence the only reply we get from many Orthodox is: \"well, then you need to make your choice: either be Orthodox or Roman.\" Or, as one board member stated recently: \"There is no such thing as Eastern Catholicism.\"\n\nIs the price of our renouncing the goal to make converts of Orthodox our self-annihilation...a sort of \"final solution\"? A \"you must convert to us\" mentality would support that idea. We hear that often here from some Orthodox: \"return to Orthodoxy.\" This bulletin board exists to proclaim that we Eastern Catholics do exist and that we take seriously the obligation to preach the gospel to all. We will not just close and disappear--or just preach to \"our people.\"\n\nWe acknowledge that much of our direction in the past was wrong-headed...we have renounced proselytizing of Orthodox. That does not mean we will stop proclaiming the gospel, however. We are discerning our direction. If our Churches do ever reunite most likely we would have the \"vocation to disappear\" to quote one Eastern Catholic Bishop--as our reunion would most likely end the reason for any separation.\n\nI see as key to our future direction our reclaiming our heritage. There is no reason for us to be ashamed of what the Liturgy call us: we are Orthodox. To infer that somehow that name is now tarnished is more of an insult to Eastern Orthodox than our reclaiming our name would be.\n\nAs to whether or not some Eastern Orthodox would be offended by our so doing I would say that many of those would only be satisfied by our closing up shop and joining Roman parishes.\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\nPosted By: Christian Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 03:51 AM\n\nDear David Ignatius,\n\nI have avoided looking in this thread, fearing the question \"Who are we?\". It seems like if we have to ask, we are already lost. I once knew a man who was always asking me such questions, and it seemed such a \"miasma of blisslessness\".\n\nI do not mean to criticize the thread, it is an interesting and timely discussion. I have encountered this kind of searching recently. What is in a name...?\n\nMay I quote the \"Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity\" Oxford, 1999?\n\n\"Today, the term 'Byzantine' remains synonymous with 'convoluted' and 'labyrinthine', redolent of intrigue, decadence, cruelty, despotism, duplicity...\"\n\nWisely did Constantine retitle the city, but the word will not die. \"Byzantine Catholics\" is an invented term that was meant to unite all the Greek Catholics using the Constantinopolitan Rite, the use of the Great Church of Constantinople. As a scheme to unite, it was an utter failure. Why has the word been rejected by every Church which worships in the use of the Great Church of Constantinople, except the Ruthenian Church?\n\nFor me, Orthodox Catholic works quite well, (or Catholic Orthodox) but that could be any Catholic or Orthodox. Inclusive language found a natural home... But when we seek to define ourselves by who we are not, (eg. them), then are we not already lost?\n\nI agree with you, and would like to simply call myself Orthodox. But that word cannot be used exclusively of \"Christians using the Liturgy of the Great Church of Constantinople\". For Orthodox have many Liturgies, Laws, Theological Expressions in Truth, and that is the true richness of Orthodoxy.\n\nIn looking for titles to identify ourselves, and to reference others, I cannot wait until the day when \"brother\" is all that needs to be said.\n\nIn a dreamy kind of mood...\n\nChristian\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 06:25 AM\n\nDave,\n\nOf course you should not have an objection on the Orthodox Church using the term Catholic. The Orthodox Church is truly the Catholic Church. Orthodoxy and catholicity can never and should never be separated. Separation of the two leads to schisms and heresies which are quite common nowadays. Many schismatics, heretics, and heterodox claim to be Orthodox and Catholic when they are not. This is the challenge many like myself confront from time to time.\n\nIn regards to the Melkites use of the word \"Orthodox\" in their services it is correct. However, they need to return to the fullness of the Orthodox Church. They need to return to their real Mother Church. The relationship with Rome is artificial rather than being authentic and genuine in the unity of the faith. As much as I love my Melkite brethrens it is my duty to remind them of the Orthodox unity of the faith which Rome does not fully share. One cannot help the sick by becoming sick. What needs to be done is for Rome to become Orthodox and truly Catholic. The potential for this transformation lies within her. She must be willing to admit the theological errors committed outside Orthodoxy and fully embrace Orthodoxy for what it is. For someone to claim that Rome has always been Orthodox & Catholic is mislead and fed distortions. All an Orthodox like myself wants is the truth of Orthodoxy to be incorporated in the hearts and minds that do not know any better and that desire to spiritually grow in Christ. Defend Catholicism or Roman communion as much as you may want but the truth is that it needs to become Orthodox for a true Catholic communion.\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: What's in a name? Who are we? - 06:31 AM\n\nDear Brother Dave Ignatius,\n\nChrist is in our Midst!\n\nYou wrote:\n\n\"I see as key to our future direction our reclaiming our heritage. There is no reason for us to be ashamed of what the Liturgy call us: we are Orthodox.

It is confusing to many of us why they would seek to use the title \"Orthodox\" as the title of their Church when they have instead chosen in the past to emphaisize the term Catholic. To me the term Eastern Catholic Churches describes most fully their stance and communion with Rome. The Holy Orthodox and Catholic Church of the East, seems to in like manner emphasize the term Eastern Orthodox Church--- this limits confusion occurring when one member or the other visits the other church.\n\nI have visited an Eastern Catholic Church when traveling and there was no Eastern Orthodox Church. I found few differences in the liturgical worship until the ektanias--- where we would pray for our diocesian Bishop, the Eastern Catholic Church prayed for the Patriarch of Rome, His Holiness John Paul II. It was only then that I remembered that I would not be able to partake of the Mystical Supper for I am not in communion with the Pope.\n\nI commend the Byzantine Catholics or Eastern Catholics for their desire to return to more\n\ntraditional worship and spirituality of their Orthodox Ancestors, however to unilaterally declare themselves \"Orthodox\" without embracing fully what the Eastern Orthodox Church means spiritually and historically, seems to me to be confusing and unneccessarily confrontive to many Eastern Orthodox Christians. Many Eastern Orthodox Christians are only beginning to work through the challenge of Ecumenical discussions that will lead, I fervently believe, to full communion with in the two sister Churches of the Holy, Apostolic, Orthodox and Catholic Church.\n\nI do not wish to be bringing up the \"red Herring\" but as I said in my earlier posting,\n\n\"How do you propose closure on this issue\". My proposal is that the Eastern Catholic Churches use that title to avoid confusion with the Eastern Orthodox Church (NICR).

I like it!\n\nIf the Byzantine Catholics � Catholic Orthodox � deny something essential to Eastern Orthodoxy, that seems to say being in schism is part of the essence of Eastern Orthodoxy, which I wouldn�t want to say. The best from both sides in the churches of the Chalcedonian/Constantinopolitan � Orthodox � tradition emphasize the positive in that tradition and are not �Protestant� � not protestant vs. the Pope, Roman Rite, Rosary, etc. etc. (but not wholly uncritical either) � not using a negative to define who they are.\n\nFor similar reasons � denying their obvious historical connection to the Orthodox � the Ruthenians� silly nonuse of the word Orthodox is wrong, emphasizing a negative, as do the hatefulness of deliberate latinization (such as Nicholas Elko�s 1950s-1960s tearing down of iconostases) and, sorry, church signs and nomenclature like �St X CATHOLIC Church (Byzantine or Byzantine-Slavonic Rite)�.\n\n<a href=\"http://oldworldrus.com\">Old World Rus�</a>\n\nPosted By: anastasios Re: What's in a name?

For instance, say you have Saint Peter (Byzantine) Orthodox Church and Saint Peter (Syriac) Orthodox Church, and Saint Peter Syriac Catholic Church. They all claim to be \"Orthodox Catholic\", so right now, regardless of official title, this formula might work to distinguish:\n\n(Name of Church) + (Sui Juris Church in cases where more than one church uses same rite) + Rite + Communion\n\nExample: Saint Bob Syriac Catholic Church\n\nSaint Bob Syriac Orthodox Church\n\nSaint Bob Ruthenian Byzantine Catholic Church\n\nSaint Bob Russian Byzantine Orthodox Church\n\nSaint Bobos Coptic Orthodox Church\n\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThis way everything would be plain and clear.\n\nPosted By: Kurt Re: What's in a name?
