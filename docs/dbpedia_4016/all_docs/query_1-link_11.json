        "text": "“We all unanimously teach that our Lord Jesus Christ is to us One and the same Son, the Self-same Perfect in Godhead, the Self-same Perfect in Manhood; truly God and truly Man; the Self-same of a rational soul and body; co-essential with the Father according to the Godhead, the Self-same co-essential with us according to the Manhood; like us in all things, sin apart…” (Dogmatic Definition of the council of Chalcedon 451AD)\n\nUnfortunately, the council did not succeed in putting an end to quarrels. It distinguished, and up to the present day, the Chalcedonians from the Monophysites: The Chalcedonians with the Pope and the Western Church, the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Byzantine Greeks, the Greek Catholic Melkites, the Orthodox Greeks and the Maronites; and the Monophysites with the Coptic Church of Alexandria, the Ethiopian Church, the Armenian Gregorian Church and the Orthodox Syriac Church.\n\nAnxious to defend the Chalcedonian faith, the Emperor Marcian built an important monastery not far from the city of Apamea.\n\nKnown as Mar Maroun, this monastery became the most important of the monasteries and the great defender of the teaching of the Council of Chalcedon. By the zeal in propagating their faith, the Maronite monks attracted the hostility of the Monophysites. At the beginning of the Sixth Century, the Byzantine power has changed sides and, for a time, defended the Monophysites. Thus the monophysite Patriarch Severus of Antioch, with the supported of the Emperor Anastasius, went to persecute the Chalcedonians and, at the head of the list, the monks of Mar Maroun. In 517 AD, 350 Maronite monks, who went to an alleged meeting of reconciliation with the Monophysites, were ambushed and massacred.\n\nIn spite of this massacre and despite the religious incoherence of Byzantium, the Maronite Church retained its Chalcedonian faith, remained attached to the magisterium of the universal Church and showed unfailing fidelity to the successors of Peter. It is from these constants that the Maronite soul was shaped and established.\n\nTired of the incoherence of Byzantine politics, and finding that the patriarchal seat was vacant, the Chalcedonians of the Church of Antioch elected, in 685 AD and without referring to Constantinople, their patriarch, Jean-Maron (Youhanna Maroun), a Maronite monk and bishop from Batroun and Mount Lebanon. This decision of great historical significance for Lebanon constituted the official consecration of the Maronite Church.\n\nBasileus regarded this election as an act of insubordination which would affect his imperial authority. He sent an army to capture the patriarch who had established his residence at the Mar Maroun convent on the Orante. Youhanna Maroun managed to escape the army of Basileus and took refuge in the region of Byblos. The convent was destroyed and five hundred monks were found dead.\n\nRetired in the Lebanese mountain with their patriarch, the Maronites resisted the Byzantine army and won a decisive victory in 694 AD. The two commanders of the imperial army were killed in this battle. Just as the election to the patriarchal seat of Youhanna Maroun officially consecrated the Maronite Church, this victory marked the birth of the Maronite nation. The English historian Edward Gibbon of the Eighteenth Century wrote: ”Maronite was transferred from a hermit to a monastery, and from a monastery to a nation. This humble nation survived the empire of Constantinople, which persecuted it”.\n\nAfter this episode, the Maronite Patriarchs spent their time between the convent of Kfarhaï in Lebanon and the reconstructed convent of Mar Maroun on the Orante. It was not until 938 AD, after the destruction of the Maroun monastery by the Arabs, that the patriarchal siege was definitively established in Lebanon to escape the disorders which afflicted the countries of the East and opposed the Byzantines, Seldjukides and Fatimids, until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1098 AD.\n\nPersecuted by the Muslims as well as by their Byzantines, the Maronites, despite their small number and poverty, showed remarkable pugnacity when it came to defending their identity and their faith.\n\nAfter the departure of the Crusaders, the Maronites witnessed the violence of the Mamelukes (slaves) who had become soldiers and a powerful military oligarchy. All the way from Egypt, which they ruled in 1250 AD, they conquered Lebanon and Syria and retained power until 1517 AD, when they were defeated and replaced by the Ottomans. Unlike the Arabs who saw no military interest in the Lebanese mountain, the Mamelukes, in their struggle against the Crusaders, realized the strategic importance of the mountain and understood that it was first necessary to reduce their entrenched Maronite allies in hard-to-reach places from which they would undertake surprise attacks. The Mamelukes, before and after the departure of the Crusaders, led many murderous raids against the Maronites. Several Patriarchs were humiliated and killed. One of them, Gabriel de Hejoulah, was even burnt alive in Tripoli in 1367 AD. It is said that there is not more crueler than a slave who has become king. The Mamelukes were very violent and massacred a large number of Maronites.\n\nDespite all the misfortunes and suffering endured, the survivors were able to regroup and rebuild their community life around their patriarchs. They have even succeeded in securing relative autonomy and experienced population growth through a very high birth rate. The Maronites were not the only victims of the Mamelukes’ cruelty. Other communities, which belonged to Islam, were persecuted and found refuge in the Lebanese mountain. This was the case of the Nosairis, the Shiites and the Druze who had settled in Keserwan.\n\nTaking advantage of the wars between Mamelukes, Crusaders and Mongols, these communities revolted against their oppressors. The Mamelukes, who had just forced out the Franks and the Mongols, turned against the insurgents of Keserwan, and quickly materialized their revolt. Repression and vengeance were terrible. Those who escaped the massacre were deported: the Nosaïris to Akkar, the Druze to Chouf and the Shiites to the South. The hub thus created in Keserwan allowed the Maronites to settle there without disturbing the Mamelukes.\n\nThis is how the Maronite population’s expansion gradually reached the entire mountain and created a new reality: the cohabitation and organization of intercommunity relations became both a wealth for Lebanon and a unique experience of conviviality and intercultural dialogue. However, at the same time, it can be considered as an Achilles heel, that allows the occupants to divide and rule them.\n\nThe Maronite School in Rome enabled the development of many pupils who played an important role in the evolution of the Lebanese society. These pupils, who were truthful multipliers, were the main architects of the establishment of a network of schools in the mountains.\n\nIn 1610 AD, they introduced the first printing plant of the East and installed it in the convent of Kozhaya. Other students of the Maronite School of Rome held important positions in prestigious institutions in Europe: Gibrayil El-Sehnaoui, professor of Oriental languages at the Royal College of France, Ibrahim El-Hakim, Curator of the Oriental Library of France , Merhej Ibn Namroun, professor and translator. Youssef Assemaani, archivist at the Vatican Library and translator, was an outstanding figure. His research on Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Persian and Amharic (Ethiopian) that he would have recorded in his enormous Bibliotheca Orientalis remains a reference to this day. These men, as well as others, made the Europeans coin the following expression: “knowledgeable like a Maronite.”\n\nThe Maronite School of Rome also graduated forty bishops, of whom twelve were patriarchs. The most famous one, Patriarch Douaihy, was the first historian of his church.\n\nFrom the Seventeenth Century onwards, Latin religious communities supported the Maronite clerics in their educational mission: the Capuchins in 1626 AD, the Carmelites in 1635 AD, and the Jesuits in 1656 AD. Later on, other communities also followed the same path.\n\nThe Maronite School of Rome enabled the Maronites to emerge from their intellectual isolation and be in permanent contact with western thought, while waiting to be the main architects of the revival of Arabic language and literature. It also triggered, in Maronite society, an acute awareness of the importance of education. The Lebanese synod held at Louaizé in 1736 AD affirms: ”In the name of Jesus Christ, we exhort the ordinaries of the dioceses, towns, villages, and convents to help each other to encourage this work which has been very fruitful. They must find a teacher where there is none, write the names of the children who are able to learn, order the parents to bring their children to school. If they are poor or orphans, the church or convent gives them food and if the church cannot, it gives a part and the parents give another. ”\n\nThis decision was remarkable when one considers the time at which it was made. It made all parents consider their children’s education a top priority. One of the greatest pride of the Maronites in the construction of modern Lebanon is the creation of schools. They have been open to all communities and have enabled Lebanon to become a center of intense cultural activity.\n\nThe revival of the language, literature and of the Arabic thought took off in Lebanon."
