        "text": "Glory to the one descended and settled upon the upper room; he gave learning to the ignorant and wisdom to simple hearts.\n\nCome, let us praise the Lord who descended upon the upper room, let us sing to God our Savior who gave wisdom to simple hearts.\n\nGlory be to the Shepherd who enriched his flock with priests and bishops, with altars and offerings.\n\nYou are invited to attend the upcoming Symposium and Lecture in honor of Father Paul (Boulos) Feghali taking place in person and online, on Thursday, September 26, 2024, from 2:00pm until 6:30pm. The Hidden Pearl Institute and Press will award $5,000.00 to a Ph.D. student during the event.\n\nI am sorry to inform you of the passing of Fr. Joseph AbiSaad on the morning of August 19, 2024.\n\nFr. Joseph was a faithful pastor of Saint Anthony Church, Lawrence, MA; Saint George Church, Dover, NH; Saint Sharbel Church, Newtown Square, PA; and most recently, Saint Theresa Church in Brockton, MA.\n\nNorbert George Vogl, Jr., 92, of Colchester and Essex Junction, Vermont, passed away peacefully the morning of August 7, 2024 in the comfort of his family. He was a devoted member of Holy Cross Church in Colchester, Vermont where he was actively involved with many aspects of Catholic education; a member of the Knights of Columbus, an Eagle Scout, Cubmaster and Scoutmaster with the Boy Scouts of America, and a volunteer with civic organizations over the years.\n\nHis Beatitude and Emminence, Patriarch Bechara Peter Rahi, has decided to grant the rank of Chorbishop to Father Elie Mikhael.\n\nThis follows the appointment by His Holiness Pope Francis of Father Elie as Apostolic Administrator of the vacant See of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon in Mexico.\n\nOur Holy Father, Pope Francis, has called for a Jubilee Year December 24, 2024, through December 28, 2025. He has asked us to be \"pilgrims of hope\" during this year and to deepen our personal encounter with Christ. Therefore, with a whole-hearted affirmation, I have decided to embrace the Jubilee Year with the following Eparchial requests of clergy, religious and laity\n\nThose entrusted with designing and staging the Olympics Opening Ceremonies in Paris had too much time, money and power. They did not deserve that privilege.\n\nThe scene of the Last Supper mocking Jesus and his disciples, was especially egregious.\n\nOur Maronite Church is on the verge of announcing the beatification of Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy of Ehden, \"a beacon of knowledge and holiness.\" He is a \"beacon of knowledge\" as evidenced by his writings in all fields: historical, theological, liturgical, and others. He is the greatest Maronite Patriarch, unparalleled and will remain so, with his scholarly personality: philosophical, theological, liturgical, and historical, and his sharp intelligence since his school years and beyond.\n\nOn this occasion, we invite you to encourage the members of your dioceses and parishes (parishes - brotherhoods - associations - organizations...) to participate in the celebration of the proclamation of the venerable Estephan El Douaihy as Blessed.\n\nListen to this lecture to understand not only the value of Christianity 2000 years ago, but the great value today of the presence of Christians who truly believe in Christ, his way of life, and what this means for children, families and especially women.\n\nA beautiful testimony has been given to the Maronites. Written in 1980 by Charles Malik, I ask you to give it a good read. Itâ€™s kind of embarrassing and humbling to see someone from the outside view the Maronite Church and the great responsibilities and gifts that have been placed in our hands as Maronites through our Father in faith, St. Maron."
