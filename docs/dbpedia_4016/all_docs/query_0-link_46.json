        "text": "The relics of St. Sharbel Makhlouf, a pious hermit who lived in the 19th century, will visit St. John Maron Maronite Catholic Church in Orange this weekend.\n\nSt. John Maron is the only Maronite church in Orange County, a part of the Catholic church practicing Eastern traditions. While the Orthodox part of the church draws from Latin or Roman traditions, many traditions in Maronite churches come from Lebanon, where the church patriarch resides.\n\nThe Rev. Antoine Bakh said this is the first time the church has hosted the relics of a saint.\n\nThe remains of Sharbel’s body will enter the church at 11:30 a.m. Saturday during a processional and will remain the subject of events throughout the day – including an overnight adoration that will last into Sunday.\n\nThe relics will leave the church at 6 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSharbel, sometimes spelled Charbel, was a Maronite monk and priest in Lebanon who lived from 1828 to 1898.\n\nMonths after his death, people claimed to see a light coming from Sharbel’s tomb. When it was reopened to investigate, they found his body had not decayed at all.\n\nDocuments from the Vatican library record that the tomb was reopened several times throughout the years, each time revealing the body had not decayed. The body also oozed blood and liquid while still remaining perfectly intact.\n\nChurch documents state that Sharbel’s body did not start showing signs of decay until it was looked at in 1965 – 67 years after his death.\n\nMany Catholics considered these events miraculous.\n\n“The tomb became a place people would pilgrimage to,” Bakh explained. “People would pray to Sharbel for intercession, and they would receive answers to their prayers, and a lot of them would be healed.”\n\n“By their lives, saints testify to Christ,” Bakh said. “Christ, in turn, honors them by working through them. Often this means performing miracles through their bones or things they touched or through their prayers in heaven.”\n\nBakh said Sharbel’s tomb is covered with hundreds of letters and testimonies of his healing power.\n\nFor these reasons, Sharbel was made a saint in 1977 by Pope Paul VI.\n\nBakh said being able to have the body of the saint in the church will be a spiritual experience and offer many a chance to pray in Sharbel’s presence.\n\n“(This) is a way of being physically close and feeling spiritually close to the saint,” Bakh said. “It brings people closer to God through the saint. It’s an opportunity to share in his presence.”\n\n“It’s very sacramental,” he said."
