        "text": "Commemorated on February 14\n\nSaint Maron was born in the fourth century near the city of Cyrrhus in Syria. He spent almost all his time beneath the open sky in prayer, vigil, ascetical works and strict fasting. He obtained from God the gift of healing the sick and casting out demons. He counselled those who turned to him for advice to be temperate, to be concerned for their salvation, and to guard against avarice and anger.\n\nSaint Maron, a friend of Saint John Chrysostom, died before 423 at an advanced age.\n\nSome of Saint Maron’s disciples were James the Hermit (November 26), Limnius (February 23), and Domnina (March 1). Saint Maron founded many monasteries around Cyrrhus, and converted a pagan temple near Antioch into a Christian church."
