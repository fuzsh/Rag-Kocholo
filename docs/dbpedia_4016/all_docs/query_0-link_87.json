        "text": "Maronites follow Eastern Orthodox ritual practices while maintaining its allegiance to Roman Catholicism. It is prominent in modern day Lebanon. Maronites trace their origins both to St. Maro, a Syrian hermit who lived in the late 4th century, and to St. John Maron, the patriarch of Antioch from 685-707. Seeking refuge from increasing Muslim control in Syria, the Maronites migrated to Mount Lebanon in the ninth century. Existing in isolation for centuries, they were discovered by Roman Crusaders in the twelfth century and both immediately “made common cause” with each other."
