Stars Victor McLaglen as McGinnis and Barry Fitzerald as Michael O'Keefe. A man has been found guilty, and will be executed unless the real murderer comes forward. Joe Calleia is the priest who is trying to convince the real murderer to confess, to save an innocent man from dying. (Calleia was also the Detective in "Gilda"... great film!) co-stars Sally Eilers. Directed by John Farrow. .. he won the oscar for best writing "Around the World in 80 Days". Farrow has an interesting story himself... seven children with Maureen O'Sullivan. His daughter Mia Farrow was famous in her own right. This tale is pretty good drama. Must be pretty new to Turner Classics. Worth watching!
