        "text": "This is a strangely convoluted story with two intertwined narratives, one set in 1980 and the other in 2017 and linked by the character of Connie Holden. The first narrative deals with Connie’s relationship with a much younger woman, Elise Morceau, while the second finds her thirty-seven years older and meeting up with a young girl called Rose who tricks her into becoming her assistant. It transpires that Rose is actually the daughter of Elise.\n\nThat is the bald outline but there is so much more to the novel than that. The characters of Rose and Elise often seem to overlap although Rose never knew her mother who disappeared when she was very young. She, Rose, has been brought up by her father who has provided few details of her mother’s past while, just to complicate the picture, Elise’s mother also died when she was young. Although Elise gave birth to Rose her parenting was chaotic, a sad mix of postnatal depression, inadequacy and a tendency to want to escape whenever life became challenging. Rose has the same tendencies.\n\nConnie who exists in both narratives is a successful writer. Unlike Elise she is confident and focused. Apart from the age difference you have the sense that this is an unbalanced relationship which while intense at times is also fragile. On a trip to the United States inspired by the filming of an adaptation of one of her novels, Connie adapts to Californian life while Elise feels isolated and confused. Things come to a head and Elise runs away with Matt who is married to Connie’s American friend Shara. This is something that Elise seems almost to fall into unthinkingly and that’s a feature of her life – feeling out of control and somehow not finding her own boundaries. That’s mirrored in Rose and her on and off relationship with her boyfriend Joe. There is no permanence anywhere!\n\nInevitably, the two stories come together and Connie realises who Rose is. It’s chaotic but Connie finally completes the circle by describing what happened to Elise and how she came to leave her baby daughter. At the end of the novel, Rose avoids the same fate as Elise but then runs away. It could be a happy ending and she could simply be on a trip from which she will return but that certainly isn’t made clear.\n\nSo, what’s the book about? Well there is something about the sins of the parent being visited on the offspring, there is something about the capacity of secrets always to leak and there is something about guilt and unresolved relationships. It’s also a book about women and the choices they make and the difficulty of finding a way through. Matt who features in both narratives has been a poor partner and a lousy father. He seems weak willed always wanting to avoid consequences. Joe, the other leading male, is not much better. Neither of them are any help to the women. Finally, there is something weirdly of The Miniaturist and its dolls house in this story. The 1980 characters are distant as if viewed through a lens but the impact they have on the present is considerable.\n\nThere are a couple of places where the story struggled. I found the glossy 1980s California a little bit second hand and then there’s a bit of New York which doesn’t quite ring true. Also, bits of the climatic ending are loose almost as if there is too much to fit into this particular puzzle.\n\nThese are minor quibbles though. Jessie Burton is an outstanding writer and can sum up a place, a mood or a time in two or three sentences and this is a story which makes you think about the damage people do and the difficulty of making sense of a life and a past which is full of gaps and unknowns!\n\n(The Confession is published by Picador. Thanks to the publishers and to NetGalley for an advance copy in return for a fair review.)"
