        "text": "It's not exactly like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs. It's more like seeing one of those dogs on the TV show That's Life! that could say \"sausages\". Only instead of saying \"sausages\", it's saying, \"You understand, madam, that I am the greatest libertine in all Paris!\" while wearing a top hat. Pete Doherty tries his absolute best, and in some ways isn't every bit as terrible as you might think. There's a poster quote for you. Yet any lenient bemusement vanishes on imagining the reaction of someone who had no idea who Doherty is: \"Hey, who was that terrible actor playing the lead guy, the one who describes himself as a 'libertine'? Why on earth did they cast him?\"\n\nWell, the legendary singing star and Olympic-standard caner stars in this leaden period drama, based on Alfred de Musset's 1836 novel, as a womanising dandy who falls in love with a delicate provincial widow, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. He has a weird sort of innocence, like an eight-year-old playing the Archangel Gabriel in a school nativity play. But when the camera cuts to a proper actor who knows what he or she is doing, and then back to Pete, the effect is surreal, as if Doherty had visited some Euro cinema theme park with a greenscreen attraction which allows members of the public to Photoshop themselves into the action.\n\nGainsbourg will frown earnestly at him, and he will gaze impassively back, occasionally looking sharply away, apparently struck by some epiphanic sense of her beauty or his own unworthiness. Or perhaps director Sylvie Verheyde has coaxed the move out of him by loudly opening a can of Special Brew out of shot, and taken the sound out in post-production. But all the time, Doherty sounds like Danny in Withnail and I, pondering the difference between a judge's wig and a long white hat. Well, maybe his fanbase will turn out, and the casting will make this a fabulous new movie-business model. In which case Verheyde may now be pondering a sci-fi thriller about monkeys in the Arctic."
