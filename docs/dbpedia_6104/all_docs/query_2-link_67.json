        "text": "It started, essentially, as a dare. Tony and Olivier-winning actor Gavin Creel lived in New York City for 20 years and never once entered The Metropolitan Museum of Art. When offered an opportunity to write a new work based on their collection, he finally went in.\n\nWALK ON THROUGH is a thrilling new musical featuring 17 original, infectious, pop-infused songs that invite you to join Gavin as he discovers -- much to his and our surprise -- what it means to be fully alive.\n\nInspired by The Met's world-renowned collections, WALK ON THROUGH is an affirmation of the transformative power of art to reveal the heart of our human condition in a bold new way. The music – and Gavin's journey – break through the noise and divisions of modern life, transporting audiences on an unpredictable and astonishing walking tour of love, loss, and renewal.\n\nBased on a concept originally commissioned by The Met, WALK ON THROUGH will make its Off-Broadway debut at MCC Theater’s Susan & Ronald Frankel Theater (511 W 52nd Street, New York, NY. 10019) November 13 - January 7, 2024.\n\nIn December 2022, WALK ON THROUGH was presented for two SRO industry- wide showcases at The Pershing Square Signature Center’s Irene Diamond Stage. The audience was comprised of a curated list of potential producers, investors, and partners, as well as influencers and friends.\n\nAs a result of the Signature showcase, WALK ON THROUGH will be produced by the acclaimed MCC Theater Off-Broadway in the fall of 2023 for a limited-engagement opening in November 2023.\n\nFounded by Co-Artistic Directors, Bernie Telsey, Bob LuPone, and Will Cantler, MCC Theater is one of the most exciting and innovative Off- Broadway theaters in New York City; a non-profit that is celebrated for the development and presentation of daring new works.\n\nFor any further inquiries or questions, contact info@walkonthrough.com\n\nThe executive team of has been working closely with The Metropolitan Museum of Art, various contemporary artists and the artists’ estates to secure necessary permissions for the artwork featured in WALK ON THROUGH.\n\nFor use in future theatrical productions, we have already obtained permissions from Cindy Sherman, Gregory Crewdson, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, Joan Snyder, the estate of Edward Hopper and many more.\n\nThe Met has also enthusiastically endorsed the project, indicating their full support and willingness for use of the Museum’s image, logo, and likeness.\n\nA full list of the objects from The Met’s collection that appear in WALK ON THROUGH can be viewed on our Art Credits page.\n\nGavin Creel (Writer and Performer) is a Tony Award winner for his performance as Cornelius Hackl in HELLO, DOLLY! starring Bette Midler.Creel made his Broadway debut in THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, for which he received his first Tony nomination.
