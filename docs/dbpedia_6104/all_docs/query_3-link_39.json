        "text": "A short-short story\n\nThis is part of a series: X Goes to Confession.\n\nHello, my name is Mary. My doctor gave me maybe a day before I wouldn’t be strong enough to make my final confession. So I asked the chaplain to come in. This is what happened. I hope you’ll keep it all a secret, including the last thing I’ll tell you.\n\nMe: Father, I have sinned, a lot.\n\nChaplain: I understand. We all have.\n\nMe: But not like me…When my husband stopped being interested in me, which happened fast, I slept with other men. I must have slept with… 100. If I could, I’d want to do you.\n\nChaplain: Uh, sorry. What else would you like to confess?\n\nMe: Do you have a couple weeks?\n\nChaplain: I’m here for as long as you want me.\n\nMe: I’ll skip to the highlights or I should say, low lights. Well, I paid my cleaning woman under the table so she didn’t have to pay taxes — What a ripoff taxes are.\n\nChaplain: Many people feel that way. I’m sure God understands. Anything else?\n\nMe: I lied and said that a coworker abused me. I said that so I could get his territory — It’s easier to fundraise in Piedmont than in Oakland.\n\nChaplain: I see. Anything else you want to confess?\n\nMe: Well, I used to shoplift, actually right up ’til I became bedridden. Want me to tell you my methods?\n\nChaplain: Up to you.\n\nMe: Well, I had more approaches than a sleazy guy at a singles bar. But here’s one example: I’d make sure the Nordstrom store camera wasn’t on me, take a piece of jewelry from the counter, palm it like magicians do, pick a skirt, go into the dressing room — no cameras allowed there — stuff it in my panties, get dressed, and voila!\n\nChaplain: You sound almost proud.\n\nMe: You got me.\n\nChaplain: Well, shoplifting is common and getting more common. I hope God will forgive you.\n\nMe: Okay, the Ten Commandments say I need to honor my mother and father — No way — My mother was lazy and my father was sleazy.\n\nChaplain: Well, maybe we should kinda wrap this up.\n\nMe: Okay. One more. I saved the best or should I say the worst, for last. I am going to leave a note on my deathbed saying it was I who killed my father.\n\nChaplain: Who did?\n\nMe: My sister but I like her and if I take the fall, maybe the cops will stop investigating. It won’t matter to me — I’ll be dead.\n\nThe chaplain’s voice got soft as he intoned the last thing:\n\nChaplain: I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nMe: Amen. (The chaplain was supposed to say Amen with me but I don’t think he did.)\n\nI read this aloud on YouTube."
