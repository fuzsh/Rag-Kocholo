        "text": "Corporate confession\n\nFoster reminds us that we can often fall into a hole where we think that everyone else is super holy compared to us. In turn, this leads us to even more guilt about our sin and results in us hiding away, living a veiled life that inevitably is full of hypocrisy.\n\nThe solution? We have to accept that we are a fellowship of sinners, who are all in this together, and who are all just as good or bad as one another. This puts us on a level playing field, and (ideally) leaves us no room for judgement.\n\nThen we each need to find someone we trust, who we know isn’t going to judge us, who’s a good listener, and who follows Jesus. Ask them to sit down with you and start learning this discipline. If you are struggling to think of anything, or if you are struggling to say anything, Foster suggest two exercises:\n\nSpend some time beforehand, maybe across a few days, picking different stages of your life and spending just 10 minutes in silence asking God to reveal things from that stage of life. Write down whatever comes into your head, no matter how crazy it is. Then after you’ve gone through each stage, meet with the friend and read it to them, confessing.\n\nIf you’re struggling to actually share, get your friend to ask you questions. If even this isn’t working then go to ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ questions, where you simply have to nod or shake your head. Eventually this should lead somewhere.\n\nRight now, the thought of this might seem really uncomfortable, and it likely will be. But the end goal is that we gain freedom – a freedom only found in the realigning ourselves with God.\n\nTo conclude, here are the four things that the Foster lays out as the fundamentals of confession:\n\nBE SPECIFIC\n\nConfession is all about being as specific as possible. It’s easy to say, ‘God, please forgive me because I was bad today,’ rather than, ‘God, today I hurt … and I was also thinking horrible things about … when they annoyed me. I also struggled with …. today. Lord please forgive me and help me to grow into being more and more like you.’ People came to Jesus with obvious sins and then were forgiven and healed, so we should too.\n\nBE SORROWFUL\n\nThis doesn’t mean wallowing in our sin. This doesn’t mean letting our sins control us and eat us up. It’s just about having a healthy amount of regret, and a regret of having ‘offended the heart of the Father.’ Really it’s just about being sorry that you strayed from the father’s heart.\n\nHAVE A DETERMINATION TO AVOID SIN\n\nThe whole point of confession is the free us from our past sin and give us a yearning for a holy life, that means having a determination to avoid sin. This means really trying to live a life in which we avoid sin as much as we can. However, we must know this is done in God’s strength, not ours alone.\n\nEND IN JOY\n\nThe whole process is done for the sake of living a life full of joy, aligned with the Father. When we’ve done this well there is almost inevitably joy at the end of it.\n\nSo, now we know what confession is all about, let’s have a go! Here are a few ways we can get started…\n\nText or ring a friend who you trust and ask them to engage in this with you. Take some time before you speak to reflect and pray, asking God to reveal things to you and then share and feel the freedom\n\nSpend some time alone, write those things you may be feeling guilty about down. Pray over it. Then tear the piece of paper up into as many pieces as possible. This is a physical act of that sin being taken away.\n\nSpend some time praying. Being in God’s presence and take that first step in sharing with him your sin and asking for forgiveness."
