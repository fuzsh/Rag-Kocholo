        "text": "Book Summary\n\nFor every innocent man sent to prison, there is a guilty one left on the outside. He doesnt understand how the police and prosecutors got the wrong man, and he certainly doesnt care. He just cant believe his good luck. Time passes and he realizes that the mistake will not be corrected: the authorities believe in their case and are determined to get a conviction. He may even watch the trial of the person wrongly accused of his crime. He is relieved when the verdict is guilty. He laughs when the police and prosecutors congratulate themselves. He is content to allow an innocent person to go to prison, to serve hard time, even to be executed.\n\nTravis Boyette is such a man. In 1998, in the small East Texas city of Sloan, he abducted, raped, and strangled a popular high school cheerleader. He buried her body so that it would never be found, then watched in amazement as police and prosecutors arrested and convicted Donté Drumm, a local football star, and marched him off to death row.\n\nNow nine years have passed. Travis has just been paroled in Kansas for a different crime; Donté is four days away from his execution. Travis suffers from an inoperable brain tumor. For the first time in his miserable life, he decides to do whats right and confess.\n\nBut how can a guilty man convince lawyers, judges, and politicians that theyre about to execute an innocent man?\n\nMedia Reviews\n\nMedia reviews not yet available.\n\nThis information about The Confession was first featured in \"The BookBrowse Review\" - BookBrowse's membership magazine, and in our weekly \"Publishing This Week\" newsletter.

Realizing he didn't have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.\n\nOne day at the Dessoto County courthouse, Grisham was inspired to start a novel.
