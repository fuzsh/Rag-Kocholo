        "text": "This is a story about hiding what we have done well, and not celebrating our creative work. It’s a true story, about me. I am embarrassed to share it, but am going to, because I think we all do this to our detriment, and in doing so stop others accessing what we have created with love.\n\nYou might have noticed that I wrote a book which came out last month. It is a book about life lessons inspired by ancient Japanese culture and philosophy. What you probably don’t know is:\n\nIt has been #1 bestseller in multiple Amazon categories ever since here in the UK.\n\nIt hit the top 40 on the whole of thebookdepository.com (which has over 4 million books).\n\nThe Sunday Times Style called it “A truly transformational read”\n\nThe rights have been sold for nineteen foreign languages\n\nJapanese people have said some incredibly kind things about it, such as “Beth is one of the great foreign writers who truly understand (wabi sabi and Japanese culture)” and “Beth has described (this philosophy) better than a native could”\n\nTokyo’s biggest English-language bookstore called it “a beautiful book about Japanese culture”\n\nI could go on – there have been many many kind words from all corners – from interior designers to life coaches, and readers all over the world.\n\nAnd yet since the day it came out, I have not sent a newsletter or even shared it very much here on Facebook, celebrating one of the best creative projects of my life. Why? I have told myself I have been busy, which is true – I have sold a house, been to America to teach, settled my family into a new home and town, and my eldest started school, all in the three weeks since the book came out. But still, deep down I know that’s not the real reason.\n\nIt’s because I didn’t want to brag, or show off. Know that feeling? But the whole point of writing this book was to bring this hidden wisdom out of the Japanese language, and share it with all of you so you could integrate its beautiful life lessons to live a more authentic and inspired life. And I really really care about that.\n\nI only realised I had done this when I was stood in front of a room full of female entrepreneurs at the incredible 1440 Multiversity in California a week or so ago, answering a question about newsletters. I mentioned that I rarely use my newsletter or my groups on Facebook to sell things, because I prefer just talking to you about life, and sharing thoughts and inspiration which I hope are of use. What I realised was that I have written a book full of those things, which a lot of people have said is a really fantastic book, and yet I have hardly shared it with you.\n\nSo, as of today that is all changing! I am going to celebrate this piece of creative work in three major ways:\n\n(1) I would like to encourage you, in no uncertain terms, to PLEASE READ IT. I promise you will feel more calm, tuned in, and appreciative of beauty in your own life as a result. You can get it in beautiful hard copy or on ebook here (currently at around 30% off on Amazon)\n\nIf you are in the US/Canada you can get it at 30% off with free shipping from The Book Depository here.\n\nI wrote it as a precious gift to you and hope it helps you treasure all that is good in your life.\n\n(2) If you have read it, I am going to ask you to PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW! Reviews make so much difference. I am so grateful to have over 200 five star reviews for my first Freedom Seeker, and know they really help people to decide if a book is a good fit for them.\n\nGIFT FOR YOU: As a token of my gratitude for you taking the time to write a review, I would love to send you a small gift in the post, to wherever in the world you are. Please complete your review ASAP and then fill in the quick form here with your address if you would like some delightful personal snail mail from me.\n\nHere are the links for leaving a review: Amazon / Goodreads (if you got it from The Book Depository) / Waterstones\n\n(3) Over the next few weeks I am going to share some of my favourite snippets from the book and the ideas behind the and some personal stories about my journey to writing it, so stay tuned for those!\n\nAnd I am going to stop being shy about celebrating the things I have worked so hard to create with love for you. I hope you will do the same – this week I encourage you to think about one thing you are proud of, and share it with someone in your family, friendship circle, online community or elsewhere, celebrating your skills, talents and dedication. Please feel free to leave a note in the comments and share it with us too!\n\nMuch love,\n\nBeth Xx"
