        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Texas -- A Texas man who claimed an intellectual disability in a late attempt at a reprieve was executed Wednesday evening for the killing of a woman who was jogging near her Houston home more than 27 years ago.\n\nArthur Lee Burton, 54, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and was pronounced dead at 6:47 p.m. local time. He was condemned to die for the July 1997 killing and attempted rape of Nancy Adleman, a 48-year-old mother of three.\n\nBurton appeared nervous as he lay strapped to the death chamber gurney and a spiritual adviser prayed briefly over him, the inmate's right leg twitching under a white sheet that covered him from his chest to his feet.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to all the people who support me and pray for me,\" Burton said when asked by the warden if he had a final statement, his voice repeatedly cracking with a sharp breath after saying several words.\n\n\"To all the people I have hurt and caused pain, I wish we didn't have to be here at this moment, but I want you to know that I am sorry for putting y'all through this, and my family. I'm not better than anyone. I hope that I find peace and y'all can, too.\"\n\nHe nodded to his brother, Michael, watching through a window nearby, took four gasps as the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began taking effect, then appeared to yawn before all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead 24 minutes later.\n\nAdleman had been brutally beaten and strangled with her own shoelace in a heavily wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou, police said. According to authorities, Burton confessed to killing her, saying \"She asked me why was I doing it and that I didn't have to do it.\" He recanted this confession at trial.\n\nHours before the scheduled execution time, the U.S. Supreme Court declined a defense request to intervene after lower courts had previously rejected Burton's request for a stay.\n\nBurton's lawyers had argued that reports by two experts and the records showed Burton \"exhibited low scores on tests of learning, reasoning, comprehending complex ideas, problem solving, and suggestibility, all of which are examples of significant limitations in intellectual functioning.\" They had argued the evidence was a strong indication of an intellectual disability that made him \"categorically exempt from the death penalty.\"\n\nProsecutors, however, argued that Burton had not previously raised claims of an intellectual disability and that he had waited until eight days before his scheduled execution to do so.\n\nOKLAHOMA MAN\n\nOklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board voted 3-2 on Wednesday to recommend the governor spare the life of a man on death row for his role in the 1992 shooting death of a convenience store owner during a robbery.\n\nThe board's narrow decision means the fate of Emmanuel Littlejohn, 52, now rests with Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who could commute his sentence to life in prison without parole.\n\n\"I'm not giving up,\" said Littlejohn's sister, Augustina Sanders, after the board's vote. \"Just spare my brother's life. He's not the person they made him out to be.\"\n\nStitt's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the board's decision, but Stitt has previously said he and his staff meet with attorneys for both sides, as well as family members of the victim, before deciding a case in which clemency has been recommended.\n\nLittlejohn was sentenced to death by two separate Oklahoma County juries for his role in the shooting death of 31-year-old Kenneth Meers, who was co-owner of the Root-N-Scoot convenience store in southeast Oklahoma City.\n\nProsecutors said Littlejohn and a co-defendant, Glenn Bethany, robbed the store to get money to pay a drug debt and that Littlejohn, who had a lengthy criminal history and had just been released from prison, shot Meers after he emerged from the back of the store carrying a broom.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Tessa Henry said two teenagers who were working with Meers in the store both described Littlejohn as the shooter.\n\n\"Both boys were unequivocal that Littlejohn was the one with the gun and that Bethany didn't have a gun,\" she told the panel.\n\nBethany was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nLittlejohn, who testified before the panel via a video feed from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, apologized to Meers' family and acknowledged his role in the robbery, but denied firing the fatal shot.\n\n\"I've admitted to my part,\" Littlejohn said. \"I committed a robbery that had devastating consequences, but I didn't kill Mr. Meers.\n\n\"Neither Oklahoma nor the Meers family will be better if you decide to kill me.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Juan A.
