        "text": "Lifetime is bringing the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard to the screen. The network has announced a three-night documentary event, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard for premiere in early 2024.\n\nThe six-hour special, debuting as two-hour episodes on January 5, 6 and 7 at 8pm ET/PT, features unprecedented access to Blanchard, a victim of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy who suffered horrific abuse and made national headlines for her role in her mother’s violent murder. The docu special provides Blanchard “the platform to share her story, her way,” says Lifetime. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nCurrently still incarcerated, Blanchard is set for release in December and “is finally ready to tell her truth before she becomes a free woman for the first time in her life,” according to the release.\n\n“As Lifetime approaches its 40th anniversary next year, we are excited that Gypsy, like many other women before her, has entrusted us to help tell her story,” said Elaine Frontain Bryant, EVP and Head of Programming A&E, Lifetime and LMN. “From the emotional prison Gypsy lived in with Dee Dee to the physical one that she is in now, we are deeply honored to partner with Gypsy as she embarks on this next phase of her life.”\n\nThe documentary features Blanchard in prison on the eve of her parole hearing as she recounts her emotional journey of being forced to remain a child, held prisoner by her own mother and the unfathomable choice she made in order to survive. The doc also follows the road to Gypsy’s prison wedding and reveals Ryan, her fiancé, for the first time.\n\n“After a lifetime of silence, I finally get to use my voice to share my story and speak my truth. As a survivor of relentless child abuse, this docuseries chronicles my quest for liberation and journey through self-discovery,” said Blanchard. “ I am unapologetically myself and unafraid to expose the hidden parts of my life that have never been revealed until now.”\n\nThe Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard comes from Category 6 Media, part of the A+E Factual Studios group and Emmy nominee Melissa Moore (Monster in My Family) who executive produces and has documented Gypsy since 2017.\n\n“I’ve been documenting Gypsy’s ‘coming of age’ in prison for the past seven years and over the course of this time, I watched her transform into a woman who holds responsibility for her past and now has the courage to face an unknown new free world for the first time,” said Moore.\n\nAlong with Moore, Sharon Scott, Laura Fleury, Carolyn B. Day executive produce. Frontain Bryant, Brie Miranda Bryant and Nicole Vogel executive produce for Lifetime. A+E Networks has worldwide distribution rights."
