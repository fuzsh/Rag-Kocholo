He has also tirelessly distinguished himself as a devout humanitarian, raising tens of millions of dollars for various causes and uplifting youth via his New Look Foundation. Since 1999 he has been providing opportunities for young people in underserved communities and enabling them to flourish and achieve seemingly impossible dreams. A long-time supporter and Global Citizen Ambassador, USHER has performed at events since 2015 raising awareness to defeat poverty, defend the planet, and demand equity. A true outlier, he was equally at home on the stage of his sold-out My Way Las Vegas residency as he was on a 2016 government cultural mission to Cuba as part of President Barack Obama’s Presidential Committee for Arts and Humanities. In 2024 he will be celebrating 30 years as an entertainer, headlined the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show and released his ninth studio album, COMING HOME.\n\nCategory: Company Release\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240730324910/en/\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS\n\nAMC Theatres:\n\nRyan Noonan, (913) 213-2183\n\nrnoonan@amctheatres.com\n\nTrafalgar Releasing:\n\npress@trafalgar-releasing.com\n\nSony Music Vision:\n\nDevan Schulte, (201) 805-5242\n\nDevan.Schulte@sonymusic.com\n\nUSHER\n\nThe Chamber Group\n\nChris@TheChamberGroup.com\n\nLydia@TheChamberGroup.com\n\nSource: AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc."
