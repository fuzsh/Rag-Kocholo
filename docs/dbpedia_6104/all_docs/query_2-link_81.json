        "text": "Rumors of a feud brewing between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, alongside the cast of It Ends With Us, are flying after observations from the film's recent premiere have gone viral on TikTok.\n\nThe premiere of 'It Ends With Us' took place on Tuesday, August 6 at AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, which saw Blake Lively accompanied by her star husband Ryan Reynolds and his Deadpool and Wolverine co-star Hugh Jackman.\n\nYet fans raised suspicions as they spotted Justin Baldoni being snapped solo, with his wife Emily, and friends, rather than joining the group including Blake, Brandon Sklenar, Colleen Hoover the author of the novel the film is based on and other cast members.\n\nTerrifying maps identifies areas of US most likely to be targeted in nuclear war\n\nBono's daughter Eve Hewson fires back at nepo baby claims with 13-word slap down\n\nAmidst the telling separation of photos, social media was quick to speculate that something might be happening out of the public eye.\n\nThe storyline follows Lily (played by Blake) who encounters Ryle Kincaid (Justin) one evening on a rooftop, leading them to fall deeply in love before their relationship hits troubled waters. Notably, Justin holds the dual role of lead actor and director of the movie.\n\nKEEP UP TO DATE WITH ALL THE LATEST ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nLeading TikTok content creator Jenna Redfield threw in her views, postulating that Blake and her husband Ryan, both producers of the adaptation, might be locking horns with Baldoni over creative direction, suggesting that either actual \"beefing\" has occurred or they are orchestrating a PR stunt to drum up buzz for the film. The latter could well hold merit given Variety's forecast of a hefty $35million opening weekend for the cinematic release.\n\nOther speculations suggested that Justin may have upset Blake, leading the company to create a distance. The most prevalent theory was that Justin was simply difficult to work with, causing friction with the rest of the cast.\n\nJenna also highlighted that Liz Plank, co-host of Justin's The Man Enough Podcast, was present at the event but did not share anything featuring or about Justin. The film was produced by Wayfarer Studios LLC, which also produces the podcast, and Jenna found it strange that they haven't utilised the podcast to promote the film."
