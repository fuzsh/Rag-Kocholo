        "text": "\"City of lights... I came here to find something... Drifting in a river I cannot control...\" Trafalgar Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for Usher: Rendezvous in Paris, an energetic concert movie experience launching in theaters this September. It will be playing for two nights in many cinemas around the world, not just in the US, if anyone wants to rock with Usher. The concert doc features songs from Usher's entire 30 year career. Captured during Paris Fashion Week at La Seine Musicale, the film features chart-topping hits including \"Yeah!\", \"My Boo\", \"Love In This Club\" and more. In addition to bringing this vibrant concert experience to the screen, Usher gives audiences a glimpse inside life beyond the stage â€“ delivering a movie experience \"U won't want to miss.\" This trailer is trying to be extremely cinematic, with ultra-widescreen cinematography that makes the whole concert seem like it's being projected on masking tape. This looks like an epic concert, complete with spectacular lights, dancers galore and a roller skating sequence. Dance on. ðŸ•º\n\nHere's the official trailer for Anthony Mandler's concert doc Usher: Rendezvous in Paris, on YouTube:"
