Based on the pseudonymous Timothy Lea novels by screenwriter Christopher Wood (The Spy Who Loved Me), each instalment follows the fortunes of the feckless and accident-prone – yet seemingly irresistible – Timmy (Askwith) as he gets embroiled in the money-making schemes of his brother-in-law Sidney Noggett (Anthony Booth, Corruption).\n\nThe fun starts in Confessions of a Window Cleaner, as Timmy must satisfy the demands of a clientele of lonely housewives whilst attempting to woo police officer Liz (Linda Hayden, The Blood on Satan’s Claw). In Confessions of a Pop Performer, Timmy endures the ups and downs (and ins and outs) of the music business when he joins a band managed by Sid. With Confessions of a Driving Instructor, Timmy finds his female students fumbling for his gearstick. Finally, in Confessions from a Holiday Camp, entertainment officer Timmy struggles to organise a beauty contest under the watchful eye of the camp’s tyrannical new manager.\n\nDirected by Val Guest (The Full Treatment) and Norman Cohen (Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers), this classic quartet features a supporting cast of British comedy greats, including Bill Maynard (Oh No It’s Selwyn Froggitt), Doris Hare (On the Buses), Windsor Davies (Endless Night), John Le Mesurier (The Wrong Box), and Liz Fraser (Adventures of a Taxi Driver). As beloved by audiences as they were reviled by critics, the Confessions series sparked a string of imitators, and stand as a time capsule of the fashions and attitudes of 1970s Britain.
