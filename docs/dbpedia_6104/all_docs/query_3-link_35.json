I enjoyed how the story unfolds, the way the characters discover more and more about the past as we go on with twists and turns all over the place!\n\nEva and Bhodi‚Äôs chemistry pops off of the page, you can really feel their fizzle! I adored the ‚ÄúConfession‚Äù moments throughout the book, these were so adorable!\n\nThis book is a complete rollercoaster for the emotions. I cried, I laughed and had a few WTH moments which my partner had to check with me that I was ok because I was gasping and muttering to myself!\n\nThis is an amazing debut novel from this author and I crave more!!\n\n5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (one of my top reads of the year!)\n\nRecommend ‚úÖ\n\n#sarahforesterdavis #evaandbodhi #confession #debutnovel #bookstagram #romance #newadult #upperyoungadult #favouriteauthor\n\nRead\n\nJuly 3, 2022\n\nI got bored unfortunately, maybe I‚Äôll come back to it idk.\n\nMarch 31, 2023\n\nI‚Äôm not sure how I heard about this book. It takes place a town north of where I live but I work there. The characters say ‚ÄúFlagler‚Äù and the ‚ÄúThe Halifax‚Äù so frequently that I thought maybe the chamber of commerce paid each time they were mentioned. There are all kinds of mentions of actual locations / restaurants but the descriptions are not always accurate and sometimes really off. As I got further into the book, it‚Äôs terrible. I was thinking it‚Äôs like a scooby doo episode that wont end. Every plot twist is even less plausible and the teens are the only one who piece it together. Then the characters compare themselves to scooby doo. It‚Äôs not a nice portrayal of the area with lots of references to the teens and parents doing drugs. Then there are the sex scenes between teenagers. Who wants to read about that?!? Despite the local connection, I can‚Äôt recommend this to anyone.\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nI heard about this book from friends in Flagler Beach. It takes place in my hometown and everyone is talking about it. SO HAPPY I got a copy! I LOVE Bodhi & Eva! I couldn't put it down. The author did a great job keeping my attention throughout the entire story. Every few chapters ended on a little cliff hanger, which kept me wanting to read more. The chemistry between Bodhi and Eva was to die for, and the ending had me screaming at my book. My only disappointment? I have to wait for the sequel because it's not out yet! Definitely one of my top reads of the year.\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nOkay, I found this book on my kindle and didn‚Äôt realize how amazing it was!! It was one of those books that you need to read in one day. I love the friendships with Bodhi, Coop, and Beck. I just like the dynamics between them and the rest of the characters and I am in love with Bodhi and Eva. I love the setting! I also like how mental health is a major part of this book, because I think mental health is super important. Immediately I read the next book because omg I literally was freaking out when this one finished. Sarah is such an amazing author and I definitely recommend everyone to read her books and especially this book! Thank you for this amazing book you‚Äôve written!!!\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nIt‚Äôs not very often you read a book and don‚Äôt want it to end. Confession is that book. You are drawn into it and you don‚Äôt want it to ever end. Can‚Äôt wait to read the next one!\n\nOh and if there is ever a book that needs to be turned into a film, Confession is it!\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nSoooo good! I love the plot twists and everything about itüòÅ\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nthis book is so underrated it‚Äôs not even funny.\n\nJanuary 28, 2022\n\nAD-DIC-TIVE üíØ‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\nGet ready to buckle up & enjoy the ride!!! üôåüèº As soon as I read the first page of Book 1, I didn‚Äôt stop until the end of Book 2!!! üìñ It was SOOO good. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº I haven‚Äôt read a story this addictive in such a long time! I have been craving üòã something that would get me jonesing for the next page, next chapter and finally found it. I loved the fact that there was suspense, mystery, a beautiful love story, amazing side characters that added so much fun to the story line, but most of all the badass Eva & Bodhi!!! Gah! Can I please have a Bodhi for myself?!?! ü•∞\n\nThis author, where the heck has she been all these years?!?! ü§©üèÜ I have been wasting time skimming pages, reading the end before reading the middle just to see if it‚Äôs worth it. Ultimately, dreaming of a story that would keep me on the edge of my seat, make me laugh, cry, and scream while throwing the book across the room like these 2 books did‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è I had ALL the emotions but in a FANTASTIC, DONT MISS OUT ON THIS STORY, OR YOU WILL REGRET IT kind of way!!!\n\n*My Confession-I had no idea that she was going to keep the story going with a 3rd book. ü•≥ Normally, I wait until a series is finished before starting it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Impatient much! ü§™But, I‚Äôm glad I got a kick start on the life of these hilarious, LOYAL, adventurous, in ways damaged but inspiring group of friends that have made my quiet moments to myself so enjoyable. I am in my late 30‚Äôs and have no shame for loving and becoming an addict for the young adults of Flagler Beach!!!\n\nI can say with üíØ% certainty that WHATEVER Sarah Forester Davis writes, I will read! Addicted to her writing style, mind, and creativity!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nJanuary 10, 2022\n\nI really loved this book. I am definitely not a teen, and I don‚Äôt live in Flagler Beach‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but Sarah is a neighbor and has been getting such positive feedback that as an avid reader I really wanted to see what was so attention grabbing about this book. Girl- you are a novelist! What an imagination and the way you transitioned your thoughts into words was pretty spectacular. I may have gotten up before the sun this morning and didn‚Äôt move from the couch until about an hour ago to finish the story of Bodhi and Eva and heck everyone else ‚Ä¶.I have a soft spot for Coop and want to be neighbors with Calvin:) Be proud Sarah! I will be finding you to autograph my copy and can‚Äôt wait to read the sequel.\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nI was so disappointed with this book. I'd held off reading it until Book 3 came out and from all the reviews and quote snippets I was expecting this to be a 5*+ read and it just fell completely flat for me. It took me days to get through the book and usually I would devour a book in a day or two!\n\nI felt the characters were pretty shallow and we don't get much depth in the writing. There's just something missing for me.\n\nIn all the posts and reviews Bodhi and Eva are made out to be soul mates - I didn't believe it. I don't know if it's because we don't see them together from 12 - 14 on page and are just told about it but it didn't work for me. Eva has a good reason for having not contacted Bhodi after her accident and she has a good reason for having \"moved on\". She was stuck and really given no choice. What's Bhodi's excuse? He claims she is his soulmate and he has been lost without her for the 3 years they were apart but yet he made zero effort to try and talk to her despite living in the same town. We are supposed to believe they only saw each other once in a 3 year period and to top it all off Bhodi has been happily sleeping with every girl with a pulse and his friends joke about how he's lucky he didn't get any of them pregnant! We are also told countless times how \"experienced\" he is. The author then tries to explain it away as his way of dealing with his anger - nope! When will authors stop making every male they write about a manwh*re especially at 16/17! I'm sorry but if you truly felt someone was your soulmate you just wouldn't do that especially when that person lives in the same town as you! It was just too far fetched for me and Eva just brushes it off as if it's nothing! I honestly did not feel the connection between Eva and Bhodi at all and I'm so disappointed. I will say if we had seen some of the earlier interactions between the two or even them while they were separated that might have been better.....!?!\n\nI honestly thought I would devour all 3 books but I'm not even interested in book 2!\n\nAugust 29, 2021\n\n2.5‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nThis book had a lot of potential that it sadly didn‚Äôt reach. Imagine Outer Banks with a messier plot.\n\nMy main issue with it was that the entire mystery probably could‚Äôve been tied up in two chapters if the characters had actually sat down and had a conversation with each other. There were far too many instances of characters getting annoyed because the truth was being withheld from them, then demanding answers and storming off a sentence into the explanation saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt listen to this!‚Äù. It got very tedious very quickly. Other frustrating answers were given such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave that for you to figure out‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my story to tell‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you part today and part another day‚Äù. Then there‚Äôs characters figuring out new clues and not sharing it or lying and then being annoyed that others hid things from them and lied? Plus there‚Äôs the mental gymnastics that Eva somehow managed to do to figure out these clues was frankly astounding - someone give her a gold star for that.\n\nEva and Bodhi didn‚Äôt have a ton of chemistry. There was a lot of telling and not much showing. I don‚Äôt know how many times they exclaimed they were soulmates and had loved each other from age 12, but other than Eva spending a lot of time either moaning or whining Bodhi‚Äôs name they just didn‚Äôt sizzle, and their actions while apart didn‚Äôt scream soulmate actions.\n\nSadly it wasn‚Äôt all resolved by the end, I assume this is going to be a series but it would‚Äôve worked a lot better as a more concise standalone, at least for this couple. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd read further books, as I said there‚Äôs a lot of potential and I think it‚Äôs a case of this new author needing to find her feet and find her pacing. There is a great story in there it just needs worked out a bit more. I‚Äôm keeping my fingers crossed for future books in this series living up to the potential I hoped this one would meet.\n\nAugust 29, 2023\n\nI saw a reference to this book somewhere, and since I live in Florida, I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it is mediocre at best and trite at its worst. With respect, I honestly don't know how it's gotten the high ratings it has.\n\nI quickly realized it's YA material, something - at 60 years old - I just honestly can't relate to. Accepting that though, I figured why not be open to it, and even see if it makes me reminisce about young love and the adventures you seem to so easily see in life when you are young. Ah, if only those themes were well executed. It's an overly saccharine teen love expressed with every clich√©d, vapid angsty turn of phrase you can think of. If I read \"soulmate\" or \"I'll never leave you again\" one more time, I think my mother's warning that my face is gonna stay that way would come to fruition.\n\nI even thought the friendships and other characters were completely unrealistic. The focus was so pinpointedly on the 'soulmates' that the other characters were paper cutouts, just props in the scene, none of whom acted realistically in any way, shape or form.\n\nThe mystery is what made me continue, but 2/3 of the way through I really didn't care anymore to execute the brain power to piece any of the flimsy data that was attempting to be \"clues\". Having just now finished, I still have to stop and mental confirm what it was even about, and don't ask me to explain how some of the characters fit in.\n\nSomehow, I finished, so I must have seen or at least wished for some glimmer in the writing or plot, although I can't pinpoint what. Maybe this author has some skills that will fine tune and develop over time, but unfortunately I'm not investing time to find out.\n\nDecember 26, 2022\n\nThis YA romance novel was beautifully written. I definitely binge read this book because I just couldn‚Äôt wait to find out what would happen next. I loved this story about Bodhi and Eva and how they became soul mates from the moment they met. There is a lot of mystery and ‚Äúwho done it‚Äù throughout the story and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find it all out.\n\nThe heartbreaking loss that Bodhi experienced at such a young age made me feel for him and pulled me into the story that much further.\n\nagain.\n\nI did find the plot twists difficult to follow and found myself having to go back and reread some pages. There was a little summary at the end of the book as Eva and Bodhi talk with Luke, but I was still a little confused.\n\nI love that the ending of this story was not rushed ‚Ä¶. because there is another book! I‚Äôm looking forward to reading Confessions part 2 to see where the story takes us .\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nConfession: not sure how to feel about this book. Overall I‚Äôm glad I read it, and I loved the connection I had to the Florida location. The ending was decent and definitely had my mind wondering about potential outcomes. I was not a fan of the ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù lingo being thrown around, it felt a little too young or naive for me. But maybe it was just meant for a younger audience, I definitely feel like my younger self would have ate this book up!\n\nThe real reason I‚Äôm not giving this book a 4 is because the emotion behind it was just not there for me. It‚Äôs not hard to get me in a panic or tears over a book and when I should have been upset‚Ä¶ I just wasn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt in love with the characters that much. That said‚Ä¶ I think I might pick up the sequel‚Ä¶ so it definitely is good enough for me to keep reading!\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\nThis book is a beautifully written love story a story of soul mates and family not al ways doing the right thing.\n\nThis is the story of Eva and Bodhi two 17 year olds who fell in love when they were younger and kept apart by Eva's father.when Bodhi's mother dies he reconnects with Eva and then begins the search for the answer as they realise they still love each other and are still soul mates.\n\nThis book keeps you on your toes there is so much going on as they follow the clues to try and unravel their family histories.\n\nI loved this book this beautiful love story is just gorgeous.Its all set on a beach among this seaside community and I couldn't read it fast enough.Highly recommended x\n\nJanuary 12, 2023\n\nI didn't know it was a series! This book was sitting on my Kindle for a week or so after becoming friends with the author on TikTok. I honestly thought it was a cute romance with a bit of spice and boy oh boy was I wrong.\n\nThis is an adventure of white collar crime, espionage, and secrets. The love story is center stage, but when you get deeper into the separation between their families and how little control Eva especially has in her life, secrets start pouring out and the mystery takes precedent in their lives.\n\nI really enjoyed this book and I really don't know where it goes from here. It's not perfectly wrapped up with a bow, so I know there's more and my only prayer is that it's not a trilogy because I can't handle much more information thrown around to change the truth again.\n\nApril 16, 2023\n\nFor the most part, I enjoyed this book. The story is interesting, with a number of twists, and held my attention. I liked all the characters‚Ä¶even the not so nice ones were well written and well developed. The only thing I had a problem with was Bodhi‚Äôs endless talk about his love for Eva and needing to touch her every moment. I get that they are 17 and that is foremost on his mind. I just got tired of him going on and on about it. I also love the secondary characters, particularly Coop, who brought a lot of humor to the story. Haven‚Äôt decided yet if I want to read the follow-up novel which continues Bodhi and Eva‚Äôs story.\n\nJanuary 3, 2022\n\nAt first I liked it because it got outerbanks vibes and I LOVE that show. However I just found this book to be too overly dramatic for me (I like angst and drama but I had too many eye rolling moments) I really wanted to like this book. I also just couldn‚Äôt get over how he was 17 and she was 16 and everything seemed unrealistic adult like. Idk if I making sense however I found myself just skipping to the last chapter to see what happened. Maybe I‚Äôll give it another go when I‚Äôm in a better headspace but for now it‚Äôs DNF.\n\nAugust 20, 2022\n\nYou might think this is just a teenage love story, and nothing else . It is a love story , but it‚Äôs also a mystery. It‚Äôs suspenseful, and Ms Davis weaves a tale that had me saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got to be kidding me‚Äù and ‚ÄúWHAT‚Äù! I literally had to keep reading . And then the end . The END ! I‚Äôm so grateful I had the 2nd book already because it would have been a miserable wait if I didn‚Äôt ! I immediately started #2. And I‚Äôll spend the rest of the weekend reading it in every spare moment . My guess is if it ends like #1 .. I‚Äôll be eagerly anticipating #3!\n\nOctober 2, 2022\n\nOn one hand I love how much the main characters love each other but also‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre so young and it‚Äôs a little unbelievable? There‚Äôs also just so much ‚Äúmystery‚Äù going on that I simply could not keep up üòÖ The book did make me feel, so I give the author that for good emotional writing.\n\nI did not finish the second in the series because I was just too confused.\n\nReview is more personal preference & not a reflection of the author. If you like the Outer Banks on Netflix I think you would like this book!!!\n\nOctober 18, 2022\n\n3.5 stars\n\nI really enjoyed the Outer Banks vibe of this story and I kept trying to ‚Äúsolve the mystery‚Äù along with the characters. Eva and Bhodi‚Äôs relationship was really sweet, but a little over the top sometimes with the use of the word ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù. They really did remind me of Sarah and John B with Eva‚Äôs dad trying to keep them apart and Bohdi‚Äôs parents both supposedly dead.\n\nThe twists and turns were good at keeping me wanting to find out what happens next.\n\n**small note: the overuse of adverbs at times was a little difficult to read but overall I enjoyed the book and the plot ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nJanuary 8, 2023\n\nOne dimensional characters\n\nThe characters sounded one dimensional. I DNF, got to chapter 4 and the repetitive thought processes these two were having was maddening. I felt they were a bit dense, water down characters with very basic thought processes. Plus both of them with this soul mate jazz.\n\nKindle Unlimited books are leaving something to be desired. Haven't found a really good book in a while.\n\nI tried to skip chapters because I am guessing something interesting is going to happen eventually. However, make it interesting at least by chapter 4.\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\nWhat we have here is a teen romance & mystery split 50/50. I enjoyed the plot, liked the characters, although found them somewhat flat & as hard as I tried, couldn't fully connect with them. The author delivered some very interesting side characters, an impressive storyline but wow, this was a very long book. There was an epilogue but it didn't fully tie things up. Little did I know, this is a three book series, each one just as long, with more mysteries to solve. Am I up for reading two more to finally reach the end of the mysteries & secrets. I'm sorry to say, no, I am not.\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n4.5 stars~ I was definitely entertained by this book but the beginning was slightly boring. ‚ÄúI want you‚Äù but I‚Äôm stuck in a difficult place type thing. Eventually the plot carries on and that‚Äôs where it sparked my interest. It brought in this mystery of how their pasts are intertwined without them knowing as well as how their parents and grandparents are. I like when an author comes up with something I can‚Äôt predict or haven‚Äôt seen before and this was definitely one of those moments. I never knew what was coming but it still had that teenage romance in there to add. I have quite a few highlights from this book. I do recommend!!!\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nThis book was a pleasant surprise! I had read the synopsis awhile back when I bought the book, but l had since forgotten, so I went into this blind. I assumed it would be another angsty teenage romance. What I got was so much more! It took on OBX vibes as the friends were trying to put together the mystery of the lies that were their lives. There was excitement, intrigue, romance, mystery, unconditional friendship. It ended on a cliffhanger. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the second installment brings!\n\nNovember 9, 2021\n\nPicked this book up because Flagler is my home away from home. I loved being able to visualize the locations where things were taking place. I enjoyed this book and my favorite characters were Beck and Coop, they were so real. I did find the who is who part of some of the story confusing, and even had to draw a picture at one point to help me get it straight. Other than that it was an enjoyable read!\n\nDecember 12, 2021\n\nWhen I started reading, it became almost impossible to put the book down. This romantic thriller with plot twists, mystery, and strong characters that you'll fall in love with, will keep you wanting to read more. I absolutely love this book and didn't want it to end. I already miss the characters, especially Bodhi and Eva. Confession is an amazing debut novel by Sarah Forester Davis and I for one am excited to read her next book.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nConfession\n\nI enjoyed this book. Eva and Bodhi‚Äôs love story is just beginning and so many secrets from their pasts are being revealed, but there are still so many to be uncovered. A lot happens in this book, at one point there was almost too much going on at once. Because of this there was a point where it was almost difficult to keep and hold my interest in the book. But I‚Äôm very thankful I pushed through and finished this book. Very excited to see what happens next!"
