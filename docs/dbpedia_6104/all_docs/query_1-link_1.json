It was directed by John Farrow from an adaptation by Jerome Cady of Leo Birinski's story. The film stars Victor McLaglen, Sally Eilers, Barry Fitzgerald and Joseph Calleia.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nPat McGinnis (Victor McLaglen) murders a policeman and escapes by committing a more minor crime, for which he is arrested and jailed. An innocent man, Michael O'Keefe (Barry Fitzgerald), is convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. While delirious after an injury, McGinnis confesses to priest Father Loma (Joseph Calleia). Loma, whose flock includes McGinnis's girlfriend Molly Sullivan (Sally Eilers) as well as the O'Keefe clan, struggles to find a way to save O'Keefe without violating the sanctity of confession. He must convince McGinnis to give himself up.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVictor McLaglen as Pat McGinnis\n\nSally Eilers as Molly Sullivan\n\nJoseph Calleia as Father Loma\n\nBarry Fitzgerald as Michael O'Keefe\n\nElisabeth Risdon as Norah O'Keefe\n\nPamela Blake as Laura Mahoney (as Adele Pearce)\n\nMalcolm 'Bud' McTaggart as Frank O'Keefe\n\nJohn Bleifer as Weaver\n\nWilliam Haade as Moore\n\nGeorge Humbert as Mercantonio\n\nStanley Blystone as Detective (uncredited)\n\nRobert Homans as Bartender (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nPandro S. Berman of RKO bought the film rights to Leo Birinski's story in January 1939 intending to turn it into a vehicle for Chester Morris.[1] Robert Sisk was assigned to produce.[2]\n\nEventually the lead role was given to Victor McLaglen and John Farrow was given the job of directing. A key support part was given to Barry Fitzgerald, who had appeared in The Informer (1935) with McLaglen and had not made a film since Bringing Up Baby (1938); he had most recently been on Broadway in The White Steed.[3]\n\nLucille Ball was to play the female lead but was ultimately unable to because she was recovering from an operation for appendicitis. Filming started 15 June 1939.[4]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nFull Confession is often regarded as a semi-remake of John Ford's The Informer (1935) starring the same leading man, Victor McLaglen.[5][6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
