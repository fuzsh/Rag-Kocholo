        "text": "All eyes have been on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, whose intriguing story has been told through a Hulu TV series, an HBO documentary and countless news stories. Fresh off the success of Lifetime’s special, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the cable network will continue chronicling her life in a new unscripted series.\n\nPremiering on June 3, the new Lifetime show comes after the 32-year-old’s exclusive two-hour interview on 20/20. Missed catching Blanchard’s six-episode docuseries when it aired live in January? Keep reading to find out how to watch The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard online.\n\nHow to Watch The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard Online\n\nThere are several ways to stream The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard online: by buying or renting it online or by using a cable TV provider to stream the series on demand on Lifetime’s website or app or when it broadcasts live.\n\nLifetime’s six-hour documentary series originally premiered on Jan. 5 to 7, and all six episodes are available to buy or rent online at Apple TV, Prime Video and other video-on-demand platforms.\n\nThe Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard is also available to stream on-demand through Lifetime’s website or app, which will require you to log in with your cable TV provider credentials, including traditional and streaming services such as DirecTV Stream, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, Philo, Sling, Verizon, Xfinity and others.\n\nIf you want to watch the show when it airs live on Lifetime on cable, you can use a live TV streaming service that carries the network, such as DirecTV Stream, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, Philo or Sling. (Check your local listings for broadcast dates and times.)\n\nSee below for more information on each of the options.\n\nWhere to Watch the Gypsy Rose Blanchard-Inspired Movies and TV Shows\n\nBlanchard’s story was the inspiration behind The Act, Hulu’s original limited series starring Joey King as the teenage Gypsy Rose and Patricia Arquette as her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. Released in 2019, the show spans eight episodes and is available to stream exclusively on Hulu, which starts at $7.99 per month for the ad-supported base plan.\n\nHBO also released a 2017 true-crime documentary, Mommy Dead and Dearest, inspired by Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee Blanchard. The one-hour, 32-minute film is available to stream on Max, which can be added to DirecTV, Hulu and Prime Video streaming plans.\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard: Where Is She Now?\n\nNow out on parole and living in Louisiana with her husband, Blanchard will be the subject of a new unscripted series on Lifetime that will continue to follow the 32-year-old as she settles into her life.\n\nShe recently spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about why she wanted to work with Lifetime on the initial six-hour docuseries and her advice for others in her previous situation. She also revealed that she hasn’t yet seen Hulu’s series, The Act, or other documentaries inspired by her story.\n\n“I think the biggest reason why I held back all this time, and am coming forward now, is because I just wasn’t emotionally ready at the time,” Blanchard told THR. “There are a lot of things to unpack in my life — more than just with my mother. And so I think at the time of doing my previous interviews, everything was so surrounded around my mother and I. So I think now I’m coming to a place where I could be more confident to open up a little bit more and feel like I’m in a safe space enough to [open up]. That’s why I’m so candid in this documentary.”\n\nBlanchard was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016 after she pleaded guilty to persuading Nicholas Godejohn, a boyfriend she met online, to kill her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, who had forced Blanchard to pretend for years that she was suffering from serious illnesses, including leukemia and muscular dystrophy. She was released on parole from Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center on Dec. 28 after serving 85 percent of her original sentence.\n\nIn a statement, executive producer Melissa Moore says, “I’ve been documenting Gypsy’s ‘coming of age’ in prison for the past seven years and over the course of this time, I watched her transform into a woman who holds responsibility for her past and now has the courage to face an unknown new free world for the first time.”"
