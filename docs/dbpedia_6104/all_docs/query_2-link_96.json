        "text": "Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher) writes for a gardening magazine, but dreams of working for a high-profile fashion magazine. Her great passion in life, which has become an addiction, is shopping. As a result, Rebecca has over a dozen maxed-out credit cards. She owes $16 000 and is being relentlessly pursued by a debt collector named Derek Smeath (Robert Stanton). She manages to avoid him only by telling outrageous lies. Rebecca shares an apartment with her best friend, Suze (Krysten Ritter), who convinces Rebecca to attend Shopaholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nIn the process of trying to gain an editorial position at the famed fashion magazine Alette, Rebecca ends up at Successful Saving magazine. Here she is employed to write a financial advice column, which becomes an overnight success. Even Rebeccaâ€™s parents (John Goodman and Joan Cusack) read her column and follow her advice.\n\nRebecca becomes romantically attracted to her boss, Luke Brandon (Hugh Dancy), and romance blossoms. Unfortunately, everything that Rebecca has told Luke is a lie, and her lies are catching up with her."
