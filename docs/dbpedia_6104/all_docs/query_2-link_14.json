        "text": "Three-time Emmy® and two-time Golden Globe® nominee Sherry Stringfield (“ER”) and Katie Leclerc (“Switched at Birth”) star in the World Premiere of “Beverly Lewis’ The Confession,” a Hallmark Channel Original Movie on Saturday, May 11 (9p.m. ET/PT, 8C).\n\nThe dramatic sequel to Hallmark Channel’s highly acclaimed original movie, “Beverly Lewis’ The Shunning,” which first premiered in 2011, is based on the second novel of The Heritage of Lancaster County Books from New York Times best-selling author Beverly Lewis. The series is based on some of the heartbreaking experiences of Lewis’ maternal grandmother, who was born into the Old Order Mennonite Church, which became the genesis of Lewis’ fascination with her Plain heritage.\n\nKatie Lapp (Leclerc) is an innocent young Amish woman who has ventured out of her small Lancaster community for the first time after a painful incident led to her “shunning” from the very township that raised her. As she takes on the unfamiliar outside world, she is desperate to track down her birth mother, a wealthy and generous woman named Laura Mayfield-Bennett (Stringfield) who is sadly dying of cancer. With only a few months to live, Laura and her husband Dylan (Adrian Paul, “Highlander”) prepare Laura’s estate and will. When Dylan, a greedy gambling addict, finds out he will inherit close to nothing from his wife, he hires\n\nan out-of-work actress, Alyson (Julia Whelan, “Once and Again”), to feign as Laura’s long-lost Amish daughter—hoping Laura will take the bait and leave her entire estate to her only child.\n\nBelieving her daughter has finally returned to comfort her in her last days, Laura welcomes Alyson into her home at the same time the real Katie finally arrives at her door. Soon, a case of mistaken identity—and the unexpected return of Katie’s mysteriously missing Amish boyfriend—leads Laura to the cruel conclusion of betrayal in this heartening Amish story of long-kept secrets and a family’s true faith in love.\n\n“Beverly Lewis’ The Confession” is a Believe Pictures and Lightworks Pictures Production in association with Mission Pictures International. Brian Bird, Maura Dunbar and Michael Landon, Jr. are the executive producers. Cindy Bond and Chevonne O’Shaughnessy are co-executive producers. David R. Kappes is the producer. Michael Landon, Jr. directed from a script he co-wrote with Brian Bird. Based on the book by Beverly Lewis.\n\nBeverly Lewis is America’s foremost author of “plain heritage” literature and is the author of more than 70 books. Ms. Lewis’ father was a pastor in Lancaster County, heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch community and part of the sub-grouping of Mennonite churches who believe in simple living, plain dress and reluctance for modern conveniences.\n\nHallmark Channel, owned and operated by Crown Media Holdings, Inc., is a 24-hour basic cable network that provides a diverse slate of high-quality entertainment programming available in high definition (HD) and standard definition (SD) to a national audience of 87 million subscribers.
