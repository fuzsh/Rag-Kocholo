        "text": "October 24, 2019\n\nthis book is delivered in a stark and barebones prose, but the story itself is surprisingly convoluted and intricate.\n\nthe first chapter is told in the form of a lecture as a teacher addresses her class with what appears to be a series of anecdotal non sequiturs about the new milk program at school, the announcement of her impending retirement, the illness of a \"famous\" teacher at another school, the recent death of her four-year-old daughter manami, etc etc. but slowly, subtly, her lecture becomes a tightening noose as these seemingly unconnected stories take on a chilling import as she ultimately accuses two students in the classroom; shūya and naoki, of causing manami's death, and then very casually drops the bombshell of the horrifying revenge she has already set in motion. her detached offhandedness makes this final lecture incredibly shocking, and when the teasingly meandering narrative starts to firm up and show its true shape, it's just like BOOM\n\nclass is dismissed.\n\nthe second chapter threw me for a loop at first. new voice, new tone - who's this then? turns out, this chapter is told from the POV of a girl in the class, mizuki - the class president, who witnesses and reports on the aftermath of the teacher's revenge-plot-admission and the way it affects the two accused boys and how the revelation that they are murderers causes the other children to treat them. short answer: badly.\n\nfrom there the chapter-voice is handed off to each of accused two boys in turn, and a chapter from naoki's sister, and then it circles back again to shūya and naoki, and with each chapter, we learn more and more about the repercussions, as well as more about the motivations leading up to the girl's murder and the truth of her death as each narrative answers a few more questions, unmasks lies, exposes intent, and fills in the gaps as the individual perspectives begin to interlock in these perfect spokes, and the story comes to an explosive conclusion with a final chapter from the teacher - one last act of vengeance, one more gotcha, and the last word is emphatically had.\n\ni liked it, although i found it dragging sometimes, despite how unadorned the prose is. sometime i felt it was taking too long to get to the conclusion, and would have worked better at a faster pace considering the genre. i did really enjoy the structure - a sort of nest of confessions, with an increasingly paranoid tone, and i appreciated the way that the motivations for seemingly inexcusable actions are revealed and you begin to be able to sympathize and understand the characters a little better, but then we're off into another viewpoint and all the good intentions or misguided reasons have already been tainted and transformed into new violent acts and it's just too late for anyone to be saved.\n\nbleak. deadly. destructive.\n\ncome to my blog!\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nThe concept was interesting, the teacher's character was so raw and ruthless (as she should!).\n\nMy only complaint is that the retelling of the same story became less interesting after five times...\n\nStill worth a shot if you enjoy murder-mysteries and want to try something different!\n\nReview: https://youtu.be/k4xf-JGQihQ\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nOh my gosh!!!! Wow, what a totally crazy and unique thriller. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything like this! So surprising and has so many good plot twists.\n\nHere’s the reading vlog where I read it: https://youtu.be/IqiMeVjpQfA\n\nMay 4, 2021\n\nwell, the narrative style of this is one i immediately didnt connect with. which is such a shame because i love a good old fashion revenge story.\n\nwith thrillers, i enjoy the suspense, trying to solve the mystery. but the entire thriller component is divulged in the first chapter, aka the first confession. which is how this book is organised - each chapter is a different confession from someone who is connected to the main event (the teacher whose daughter was killed, the students who killed her, a classmate, and a sister). each POV retells the same event, but provides different insight as to why the murder happened and the fallout of everything afterwards.\n\non paper, this sounds fine. but the confessions are written in a way where the reader is the recipient of the confession, being addressed directly. its just a lot of telling and not any showing (since the confessions happen after everything). as someone who prefers dialogue and following a story as it actually happens, this kind of narrative just did not work for me.\n\neven though the execution wasnt my favourite, i did actually enjoy the essence of the story. i thought the motives were interesting and the effects of the characters actions intriguing. i just wish it had been told in 3rd person with a more traditional linear narration. oh well. :/\n\n↠ 2.5 stars\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nBefore anything else there is also a movie version of this book which I prefer more because that movie is literally art.\n\nI finished watching it as soon as I completed the book. I am still screaming.\n\n⤵Detailed review\n\n4 stars\n\n\"I think we regular people may have forgotten a basic truth—we don’t really have the right to judge anyone else.”\n\nThis book of Kanae Minato is inspired by AGATHA CHRISTIE and that's it I was sold. But when I completed the book I understood in what aspects she was inspired by her. Like instead of in terms of who did it? It was more like who took the revenge? It was slow and 'let audience solve' it type of book.\n\nLet's dive into the detailed review ( in gun points )\n\nPlot\n\n“That's all I really wanted,\" he said. \"Just somebody to notice me.”\n\n- As the name says, this book is a series of confessions at the centre of which lies the death of a child at the hands of two schoolboys. The victim is their homeroom teacher's daughter and the book starts with her confession. So we know who was killed, how and when. It's just the matter of why?\n\nWriting\n\n-The author was very successful in setting up an eerie atmosphere. Actually it’s on the verge from being eerie to creepy. All thanks to our amazing author for writing this book so brilliantly.\n\nNarration\n\n- told from POV of six unreliable narrators three mothers and three teenagers. I love how different people can make a event sound different and how different can parenting be and what it can mean for different parents. While on other hand the teen narrators made me realize that how badly these kids want to be noticed, they have there own ideals and ideologies and interesting ways to get noticed.\n\nCan't blame them honestly I was mildly like Kitahara in my teens.\n\nAll the narrations were intriguing and interesting in there own way.\n\nthe only issue was the repetitive events and repetitive naaration which was okay at first but then I really started to get bored reading about them again and again.\n\nValues\n\n- the book discussed various themes like - role of teachers in society, intense bullying, minor criminals and law aganist them.\n\nEnding\n\n- that ending was like a game changer. I was like wtf and wow at the same time. That revenge plan was like WOW.\n\nThis book was not quite what I expected it to be, but I still enjoyed it. If you are looking for an addicting and concise thought provoking psychological thriller. This is definitely it..\n\n“The world you live in is much bigger than that. If the place in which you find yourself is too painful, I say you should be free to seek another, less painful place of refuge. There is no shame in seeking a safe place. I want you to believe that somewhere in this wide world there is a place for you, a safe haven.”\n\nApril 9, 2023\n\nUn thriller que me habían recomendado por activa y por pasiva. Me ha reconciliado con la literatura negra japonesa. Impresionante.\n\nDice la sinopsis:\n\nEl último día de clase, la profesora Yuko Moriguchi anuncia a sus alumnos que deja la escuela. Todos saben el motivo: no han pasado más que unos días desde que su hija de cuatro años apareció ahogada en la piscina del colegio, en apariencia por accidente. Sin embargo, Yuko sabe que la verdad es muy distinta: la mataron dos alumnos de esa misma clase.\n\nY a ella no le interesa buscar justicia. En realidad, prefiere venganza.\n\nDe esta última lección de Yuko nadie saldrá sin cicatrices; al fin y al cabo, todo el mundo tiene algo que confesar.\n\n¿Qué me ha gustado del libro?\n\nLa trama. No estamos ante el típico thriller, que, tras un asesinato, verse sobre descubrir al culpable. Aquí la premisa es otra. Dos alumnos de trece años de la clase en la Yuko Moriguchi es tutora han asesinado a su hija de cuatro. Desde el principio sabemos quiénes son y las motivaciones que les atribuye Moriguchi. La venganza es el eje central sobre el que se construye el libro. Una venganza inicial que desencadena consecuencias que van más allá de lo previsto hasta desembocar en un final, que no vi venir, y que solo puedo calificar de impactante.\n\nEl primer capítulo, que es brillante. Cuando comencé su lectura tuve la impresión de que se iba a ir un poco por las ramas. Imposible equivocarse más. Cuando lo terminé tenía la boca abierta cual buzón de correos. Menudo comienzo.\n\nLa estructura. Se articula en torno a seis capítulos narrados en primera persona por los personajes principales. Cada capítulo con título alusivo a quién lo va a protagonizar. El primero y el último corresponden a la misma persona. Esos seis capítulos nos presentan las distintas caras del mismo poliedro. Vamos a conocer la perspectiva y motivaciones de la madre de la víctima, de los asesinos, de sus familiares y de sus compañeros de clase. Un mosaico muy completo que se superpone en el tiempo.\n\nEl ritmo no es frenético, pero sí ágil. Los giros están bien colocados tensión e intriga van de menos a más. Nada sobra en este libro; cada detalle, cada cosa que presenta tiene su razón de ser. Está hilado de forma muy fina. Todo tiene relación y explicación, y todo encaja.\n\nLo que tiene de análisis sociológico de las distintas dinámicas, familiares, escolares y legales en Japón. En este aspecto es una novela bastante oscura. En determinados momentos me ha puesto los pelos de punta. Los modelos de familia ideal, las expectativas con respecto a los hijos, los padres que no quieren ver, las exigencias escolares, la figura sobredimensionada del tutor docente, las conductas disfuncionales de muchos adolescentes, el bulling, la Ley del Menor japonesa, la redención y el duelo son algunos de los aspectos que se tratan en este libro. No deja títere con cabeza. Me ha gustado especialmente, apreciar en su justeza las diferencias con respecto a nuestro modelo social. Algunas de estas diferencias son para bien, otras no tanto.\n\nLos personajes, todos ellos bien trazados. Las distintas visiones que nos va aportando de ellos tanto en los capítulos que protagonizan como en los que no.\n\nEl final tan brillante como el comienzo. Impactante y lapidario.\n\nEn conclusión. Un thriller muy bien hilado, que me ha sorprendido mucho. Pasa a estar entre las mejores lecturas de lo que llevo de año. Kanae Minato se convierte para mí en una autora a seguir. Muy recomendable.\n\nSeptember 29, 2021\n\nUma premissa muito interessante que acabou sendo frustrada pela abordagem bastante preconceituosa e estereotipada do HIV.\n\nNão recomendo.\n\nJuly 8, 2018\n\nNeeding a quick book to fill my time before ending a holiday, I turned to Kanae Minato’s debut thriller that spins a murderous tale from many perspectives. Yuko Moriguchi has chosen to retire from teaching after her young daughter drowned in a pool. As a single mother, the death hit hard and Moriguchi faces her students one final time to deliver an end of year lecture. During this final address, she admits that the death of her daughter was no accident and that two students are responsible, choosing not to reveal them to the class. She has taken it upon herself to exact a form of revenge, even after the police deemed the death an accident. What follows is a telling of the events through the eyes of many, each with their own truths and revelations. The students, parents, and Moriguchi herself are touched by these perspectives, which enrich the revenge and leave everyone a little more vulnerable to the truth. A wonderfully crafted story that keeps the reader’s attention throughout. Those who love a thriller with many hidden revelations will enjoy this and need not worry about the translation, as it keeps a seamless narrative.\n\nWhile this book is apparently an international sensation, I had not heard about it. I am glad I scrolled through my local library and found it, which has fit nicely into the end of my holiday reading period. Minato does well in presenting this piece, which allows the reader to see the story (particularly the crime) through the eyes of many characters, thereby offering motives and enriching the greater story. Yuko Moriguchi is an interesting character, given the first opportunity to tell her version of events. The reader is likely locked into this truth through the long opening chapter and their beliefs are only then shaped by subsequent characters, all of whom twist events slightly to their favour while peppering the narrative with new facts. The various perspectives are strong and depict the differences in age, mentality, and ability of those given the narrative reins, which can force a reader to relax their preconceived notions. The story is not like anything I have read before, both because of its Japanese-influenced references and individualised approach to the subject matter. This is unlike many thrillers, English and translated alike, that I have read, proving both refreshing and mind-cramping. I was impressed to see the story develop as it did and am interested to read Minato’s second piece, which seems to be receiving the same type of praise.\n\nKudos, Madam Minato, for such a thought-provoking novel. Full of the criminal element and personal angst, I can see why you received such literary praise.\n\nLove/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:\n\nhttp://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/\n\nA Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge: https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nA genius.\n\nOne of those true crime reads that would keep you hooked even though you seem to know everything what happened.\n\nFirst, do not pick up this book thinking it as a who-done-it kind of murder mystery thriller.\n\nAs is for most of Japanese thrillers, I find this book going along the same path of revealing the murderer to the reader in the first place as if it's the most important thing to do for such books in order to enjoy them.\n\nAnd rightfully so, we are hooked even though we know there's nothing much to drill in the following pages so as to solve who did the murder.\n\nBut then the best parts of such books are the explanations or the scenarios the plot explains why or how the culprits turned out the way they are.\n\nRead this book so as to psychoanalyze the the characters. And I would say this is one book in the same genre of thrillers which comes as best after Keigo Higashino's ones.\n\nThe different POVs are interesting and distinctive from one to another. The highlight of the book.\n\nSome parts are quite disturbing. Warnings for self-harm, harm to others amounting to crime and extreme neglect.\n\nBut then after everything happened, you have to ask yourself what happened and who actually did it. You won't believe the twist that's coming.\n\nOne of the best reads of 2021.\n\nJune 7, 2017\n\nBrilliantly constructed, but pointless. I'm disappointed given the volume of buzz and strong recommendations for this novel. Still, Confessions is original and offers a sterling and surprising ending.\n\nDecember 21, 2021\n\n“I think we regular people may have forgotten a basic truth—we don’t really have the right to judge anyone else.”\n\nThe blurb of this book is so inciting and alluring, you just can't ignore it. You have to read the book, after all how many stories you have read about teachers killing their own students? I am sure there aren't that many. I started reading this as soon as I read that blurb and immediately got sucked into this weird tale.\n\nStory consists of six different narratives, all linked to the murderer or people who knew the murderer. So all the six different people brought something unique with their storytelling. Some told how they knew the murderer and how these events effected them. And then there were those two twisted students who were at the center of all this. Every confession hit me differently, some made me angry, some sad, and others made me want to strangle someone.\n\nIt was dark, and gives one lot to think on. After Malice and this, I know I will be reading more Japanese thriller in coming days.\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nFunny, I think I’ve finally had my fill of revenge now. And with luck, I’ve at last started you out on the road to your own recovery.\n\nEach chapter of Confessions is told by a different character, identified as The Saint, The Martyr, The Benevolent One, The Seeker, The Believer, and The Evangelist. Each character is very well-defined, and tells their portion of the story, building upon what has already been revealed. By the end of the novel, the reader will fully understand the whole story.\n\nAnd what a story it is! Confessions is about crime and criminal justice, sensationalism, judging others and the moral ambiguity of vigilante justice. It’s about the complex relationships—and the blind spots—between parents, teachers, and their children/students.\n\nMost of all, though, Confessions is an extraordinary story about revenge. I loved every twist and turn. On at least two occasions, my jaw literally dropped when I realized what was about to happen. Confessions is deliciously dark, downright evil in places, with a brilliant ending. I can’t recommend it strongly enough. A must read.\n\nJanuary 30, 2018\n\n4.5 Stars.\n\nTHIS BOOK! This is a book I would recommend to everyone! The twists and the turns were incredible. Nearly every twist and turn knocked me off my feet and that is SO rare as I predict so many twists in thrillers and mystery books. This book should really have the success of books like Gone Girl & The Girl on the Train because it's just so awesome! I'm not going to say anything to give the story itself away because I don't want to ruin it.\n\nStory - 4.5 Stars.\n\nWriting - 4 Stars.\n\nExecution - 5 Stars.\n\nThis book was almost perfect. Things dropped off a teeny bit in the middle of the story but the ending completely made up for it. It just was so thought out and everything fit together so well too. I would 100000% recommend this and I would definitely read something else by Kanae Minato. She's definitely not your run of the mill author, she's insanely talented and a natural writer and storyteller.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOctober 12, 2022\n\nAbsolutamente anonadado. Una vez que lo empecé resultó casi imposible querer soltarlo.\n\n«Lo había subestimado. Una rata acorralada morderá a un gato. Y de hecho, cuanto más idiotas son los que están acorralados, más actos inimaginables son capaces de cometer.»\n\nUna novela coral de tan sólo seis capítulos que se lee en un santiamén. Por medio de distintos puntos de vistas se va desenrollando toda una trama sobre la inmoralidad, la venganza, la justicia, la ética y la moral, la hipocresía del ser humano y de temas que van desde figuras paternas ausentes y figuras maternas muy metidas en el meollo del asunto, la ley de protección de menores y con una mirada muy crítica sobre el comportamiento social, la humanidad y la responsabilidad individual y colectiva.\n\nConfesiones es un diálogo abierto de varias personajes sobre el mismo hecho: el curioso \"accidente\" de la hija de la profesora Moriguchi y los implicados en tal funesta circunstancia que llevó a la muerte de la pequeña. Una historia que va de confesiones duras y sinceras, sobre juicios cara a cara, justicia tomada por mano propia, castigos crueles, muchísima hipocresía y actos monstruosos bajo el tapete por personajes que están poseídos por ansias de venganza sin fin. Una historia que te muestra que nada es lo que parece y que es mejor no llevarse por las apariencias o las primeras impresiones, quien parece el monstruo esconde mucho más por debajo, y el que parece inofensivo guarda por dentro un peligro andante.\n\nDe hecho, en un principio me estaba decepcionando tener que encontrarme con que había motivos para que los personajes hicieran un acto tan bestial, pero luego, me encantó precisamente que mostrara la inmoralidad de los pequeños y como no les importaban sus actos siempre y cuando esto representa seguir con sus planes, los cuales tienen un motivo de peso según su visión. Lo cierto es que mientras que para uno de ellos es una simple travesura que se convierte más pronto que tarde en el móvil de un verdadero asesinato; para el otro si que es un asesinato en un principio por su propia búsqueda de apoyo emocional. Al final solo quedará la culpabilidad del primero e irónicamente el absoluto fracaso del otro.\n\nEl final es buenísimo y también malísimo a niveles insospechados. Es una espiral de odio y venganza que me encanta como concepto pero la ejecución es patética por el puñado de deus ex machina que se aprecian, convirtiéndolo en un desenlace sublime y a la vez muy telenovelesco, que se agarra con pinzas. Para mí está claro que fue espectacular pero muy a la par decepcionante a nivel narrativo. Sin embargo, es una novela corta, que se lee del tirón gracias al manejo de la información a cuentagotas de la psicología de su personajes y por la intriga que supone el desvelar los recovecos de la mentalidad de tres de sus personajes a fondo y cabalidad. Es una novela turbia, adictiva y muy punzante la mayor parte del tiempo.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nUn muy buen libro sobre un crimen (el asesinato de una niña), en donde no solo se nos muestra el crimen, también la venganza de la madre, las consecuencias de ello, cómo se ideo el asesinato y la venganza, por qué, y cómo de diferente es la sociedad japonesa a la nuestra.\n\nMe ha gustado mucho ver la historia desde la perspectiva de todos los implicados; así podemos ver la motivación de cada uno, y los motivos que les llevaron a la situación final.\n\nEl libro está compuesto por 6 capítulos, cada uno de ellos desde la perspectiva de uno de los protagonistas (hay 2 capítulos protagonizados por la misma persona).\n\nEl abandono, el querer reconocimiento, el querer encajar, el ideal de familia, el dolor, la pérdida, el fanatismo o la obsesión, la venganza, y más, son los temas que veremos en esta novela.\n\nUn libro interesante -no solo por el crimen, también por lo social- y que engancha.\n\nEsta fue la primera novela de la autora, y creo que no pudo tener mejor inicio de carrera.\n\nMuy recomendable.\n\nJanuary 24, 2023\n\nWuuu, relectura con mi club. Mantengo la nota de la primera lectura y no agrego mucho más porque este es de esos libros que se disfrutan sin saber nada de ellos. Es un libro ideal para discutir con sus clubes o su compañero de lecturas favorito.\n\n4.5 estrellas.\n\n¡Maravilloso! Llegué a este libro sin saber mucho sobre él y creo que quizá por eso lo disfruté tanto. Un cruel asesinato y la venganza que éste inspira provocan un efecto bola de nieve en el que las cosas se van torciendo y poniendo peores cada segundo.\n\nLas diferentes perspectivas desde las que está narrada la historia nos permiten ver el antes, durante y después a través de los ojos de los involucrados. Minato hace un maravilloso trabajo enseñándole al lector que no hay blanco y negro, más bien, diversos tonos de gris. Me encantó, creo que esta historia se va a quedar conmigo un buen rato.\n\nLe doy 4.5 estrellas porque le faltó un poco de chispa para envolverme por completo, quizá haya sido la traducción. Muy recomendable.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\n,\n\nHer pupils murdered her daughter, she will have her revenge.........................\n\nThat was as much as I need to know about this novel in order for it to engage my interest.\n\nFirstly I would never have come across this book if it wasn't for a friend here on Good reads who's review encouraged me to read this wonderful novel.\n\nI really enjoyed this story of revenge by Japanese writer Kanae Minato and found myself intrigued by the happenings in this Japanese school.\n\nI listened to this book and the chapters are narrated in alternating voices and I enjoyed the narrator very much.\n\nThis is a dark and disturbing novel that had lots of unexpected twists and turns to keep the reader interested. The writing is simplistic and yet the author manages to captivate her readers with an imaginative and entertaining plot. I love complex and dislikable characters, so be warned this book is not for readers who are looking for loveable characters.\n\nFor a short novel this one really packs a punch and I will recommend this one to many of my friends.\n\nI think readers who enjoyed like Defending Jacob may enjoy this one.\n\nSeptember 14, 2021\n\nA teacher gives a last lecture to her students at the end of the school term and drops a bombshell that leaves everyone reeling. What follows is a story of revenge and the butterfly effect, wherein one small action has a ripple effect that changes, and ruins, countless lives.\n\nThis was my first foray into Japanese mysteries and it certainly won’t be my last.\n\nI highly recommend the audio version of this if you can find it. It’s a very well-spent 6 ½ hours of your time. Each chapter is essentially a monologue: be it a lecture, a letter, a diary, a confession, etc and so the format of listening works especially well here. (At the time of this review, it was available as an audiobook on Hoopla for me)\n\nAs a note, this book delves into very dark subject matter. Do not think that because it’s about middle school students this is anything resembling YA, or that things aren’t going to get really twisted. It *starts* with the death of a 4 year old child, so just prepare yourself going in.\n\nAugust 7, 2022\n\nMe estreno con la literatura nipona con este apasionante thriller.\n\nDonde el debate sobre la ley del menor, la violencia, la venganza y la capacidad de redimirse, se unen en un complejo cóctel de emociones.\n\nYa solo la portada anima a leerlo y aunque en un principio me costó un poco habituarme a la forma de narrar, enseguida me vi envuelta en esta historia.\n\nComenzamos la narración con la voz de la profesora de instituto Yuko Moriguchi, la cual ha perdido a su pequeña Manami de cuatro años en lo que parece ser un trágico accidente.\n\nA modo de despedida de sus alumnos seremos testigos de acusaciones que nos dejarán sin aliento en más de una ocasión. Y es que Moriguchi tiene razones de sobra para pensar que la muerte de su hija no fue accidental.\n\nAnte la impotencia de saber que son menores y de que la ley no actuará en consecuencia, decide tomarse la justicia por su mano.\n\nCada capítulo en primera persona se abre con un personaje diferente y aunque en ocasiones sentí que se repetía sobre lo mismo, eso me ayudó a no perderme ningún detalle, veremos cambios muy sutiles que poco a poco nos harán abrir los ojos y ver lo que se encuentra tras cada uno de ellos. Porque aquí todos tienen algo importante que confesar...\n\nAdemás del propio asesinato, la autora trata muchos temas de interés de una cultura que parece muy distinta pero que realmente tiene muchos puntos en común a la nuestra; como la relación entre las madres trabajadoras y sus hijos o el bullying dentro del sistema educativo y como lo afrontan los docentes y familiares.\n\nMe ha gustado mucho aprender cosas de este país que desconocía, como la edad a la que los jóvenes entran en la mayoría de edad (20 años), la ofrenda monetaria que hacen a las familias en caso de un fallecimiento o los turnos que realizan entre los propios alumnos para entre todos mantener las aulas limpias.\n\nMe parece perfecto y es una manera de que los jóvenes valoren y respeten más la labor de los mayores.\n\n🔝👌 Dividida en seis partes a las que dan voz los distintos personajes clave de esta historia, nos mantendrá en vilo con sus constantes giros y su gran capacidad para sorprendernos.\n\nY qué decir de ese final, a mi me ha dejado impactada, sublime y desgarrador. De los que te dejan con la boca abierta.\n\nDesde luego que no volveré a ver una clase de instituto con los mismos ojos, da miedo pensar lo que se esconde tras algunas de esas cabezas.\n\n¿Te atreves a averiguar lo que se esconde tras esta singular venganza? 👀\n\n📖 Próxima lectura:\n\n\"Ojo por ojo\" - David Joy.\n\n📚 https://www.facebook.com/LaLocadelosL... 📚\n\nApril 22, 2019\n\nWas war denn das für ein Buch, welches ich hier gerade gelesen habe? Es lässt sich irgendwie schwer in ein Genre pressen. Am ehesten würde man es als Psychothriller bezeichnen, aber dafür wird die Handlung nicht chronologisch erzählt. Zudem sind Opfer und Täter vermeintlich schnell zu Beginn des Buchs benannt, so dass sich hier kein Whodunit-Leseerlebnis einstellt. Oder ist es dann doch eher Gesellschaftsdrama? Egal, es ist anders, es ist japanisch und es ist verdammt gut.\n\nDas kleine Mädchen einer Lehrerin wird im Schulschwimmbad entdeckt. Sie ist ertrunken. Wenige Tage später stellt sich die Lehrerin vor die Klasse und legt ein Geständnis ab. Sie bezichtigt zwei Schüler der Klasse des Mordes an ihrer Tochter und benennt die beiden Täter mit A und B. Soweit noch alles im normalen Bereich. Doch mit dem letzten Satz ihres Statements setzt sie eine Kettenreaktion in Kraft, die einem die Kinnlade herunterfallen lässt. Und danach wird klar, dass alles, was danach kommt, eine Reaktion auf das zuvor Geschehene ist. Die nachfolgenden Kapitel werden immer wieder aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln erzählt. Einer Mutter des vermeintlichen Täters, einer Schwester, einer Mitschülerin, A und B selbst. Und nach jedem Geständnis wird dem Leser klar, dass eigentlich nichts so war, wie es ursprünglich schien. Als Leser versucht man das Beschriebene zu interpretieren, doch wenn die entsprechende Person dann selbst zu Wort kommt, verschieben sich die Puzzleteil zur Aufklärung der Motive. Nur ein Motiv bleibt gleich: Der Rachefeldzug der Lehrerin.\n\nIm letzten Drittel war ich etwas enttäuscht, da ich dachte, es kommt kaum noch Aufklärung in die Geschichte. Doch mit der letzten Seite endete das Buch dann noch mit einem unvermuteten Knaller. So muss ein spannendes Buch sein. Dass man danach denkt, ich brauche etwas zu trinken, denn mein Mundraum ist gerade völlig ausgetrocknet, weil ich die Selbstversorgung in der letzten Stunde vergessen hatte. Der Hammer.\n\nDas Buch funktioniert aber auch nur in dieser Form, weil es in Japan spielt und hier die Lehrer eine andere Stellung haben. Wenn ein Schüler aufgegriffen wird von der Polizei, dann wird sein Lehrer benachrichtigt und nicht etwa die Eltern. Der Lehrer muss dann den Schüler abholen. Diese außergewöhnliche Lehrerstellung macht das Buch auch dementsprechend ergreifend. Mehr kann ich nicht schreiben, denn alles andere wäre gespoilert. Daher gibt es nur eine eindringliche Empfehlung: Lest dieses Buch!\n\nNovember 27, 2021\n\nRating: 4 or 4.5 stars\n\nQuick Summary\n\nA mother and teacher delivers her final lesson and revenge to the kids that murdered her daughter. A lesson the whole class will never forget!\n\nPick this up if you enjoy/don’t mind\n\n😈 Central theme: revenge\n\n🧍 Know the murderer from the start\n\n🌑 Dark and intense\n\n🐢 Slightly slower pace\n\nWhat I enjoyed\n\nThis is a true psychological thriller with complex characters. Although the crime and murderers were revealed at the start there was so much to learn about all the characters. Each one was different and had a unique voice. This was in first person POV but addressed to the reader so we get deep insights into the characters thoughts and how the revenge had impacted them. All the reveals and twists had me hooked!\n\nYuko Moriguchi’s revenge was dark, twisted and messed up. Moriguchi takes the law into her own hands knowing that the juvenile justice system will not let the kids face criminal prosecution. It was poetic how the revenge was her last lesson to her students, teaching them that regardless of age, criminals should be punished and must live with the consequences.\n\nMoriguchi also taught them that criminals should be treated and portrayed as nobodies instead of sensasilising their crimes and character in the media. As she gave her lecture, she called the murderers person A and person B, knowing that everyone will figure who she was referring to.\n\nWhat I didn’t enjoy\n\nAt times it did feel a bit slow and drawn out, but then the reveals would hook me back in\n\nAll up until the end, it felt realistic but the ending was nuts, not sure how the teacher could have pulled that off. Normally I like crazy plots but compared to the rest of the novel this seemed a bit much. This is a very minor comment, it was still a good ending.\n\nApril 7, 2017\n\nThis novel is an unreliable multiple first person POV epistolary thriller debut novelwell, there are 2 chapters that are not epistolary-like. The theme of the book is REVENGE.\n\nLately I have been reading mystery/thriller by Japanese authors. These stories have dark tragic plots and voices, I stopped expecting truly happy-ending. The Confessions is one of those novels, and with relatively shorter length than previous Japanese thrillers that I've read, this novel keeps the tense stable.\n\nThe first chapter is a must read, a strong point of the story, a closing speech by the Moriguchi-sensei to her class. Even the movie adaptation made the strong dark atmosphere for the entire first chapter scene:\n\ncloudy weather, or dark atmosphere of vengeance?\n\nI still found this novel as a debut. The first chapter is an excellent short story by itself, but from second chapter to last chapter felt as later additions to make the novel length story. The reward for reading second chapters and beyond are not as quick as reading the first chapter. Although I can safely said, the last chapter revelation is worth the reading effort. I recommend everyone to AT LEAST read the first chapter, maybe by Scribd.\n\nI was tempted to rate this book 5 star, due to first and last chapter. but even with lesser middle chapters, it is still worth 4 star.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\nJune 7, 2024\n\n\"Life may be as fragile and light as a bubble, but her body had turned into a lump of lead.\"\n\nI'm sure there are lots of teachers who grow to dislike their pupils, but not nearly as many filled with the hatred and obsession to harm them as the middle-grade teacher in this novel.\n\nShe has her reasons: a couple of her pupils murdered her four-year old daughter (this is told at the beginning and is not a spoiler).\n\nThe story is told from 5 different viewpoints and I found it very clever how the author wove the story in this way. It made for some twists that were fun, though not all that shocking in the manner they were revealed.\n\nI found the writing style to be highly readable and entertaining. Not my usual genre but I'm glad I read it.\n\nMarch 14, 2019\n\n‘Confessions’ revolves around the revenge plot contrived by a middle school teacher Yuko Moriguchi. Her four-year daughter Manami accidentally dies on the school grounds but on further investigation, she learns it wasn’t an accident. Heartbroken, she decides to resign but during her last lecture to the class, she reveals the truth about the incident and sets in motion a plan to avenge her daughter. The story showcases the lives of the people in the aftermath of her confession.\n\n‘Confessions’ is one of the most unique and twisted psychological thrillers I’ve read. It was such a page-turning experience! The story was narrated by different characters which provide a fresh narrative to the story and reveals more information. So what we learn in the beginning gets completely amended as we learn in detail about the incident and the motivation of the characters. The narration was sharp and devoid of emotions. Once I started reading, I just couldn’t put it down!\n\n“Weak people find even weaker people to be their victims. And the victimized often feel that they have only two choices: put up with the pain or end their suffering in death. But they’re wrong. The world you live in is much bigger than that. If the place in which you find yourself is too painful, I say you should be free to seek another, less painful place of refuge. There is no shame in seeking a safe place. I want you to believe that somewhere in this wide world there is a place for you, a safe haven.”\n\nIt’s a dark story about dysfunctional families, obsession, cruelty, the quest for love, the quest for revenge. When we think about children, we always picture them as some kind of sweet and innocent beings but this book shows just how much of cruelty they are capable of and are able to get away with. It also highlights the role of the family, society, and environment in shaping them. The story is unpredictable and full of twists and is topped off with an unexpected ending!\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this book. If you’re looking for a good Japanese psychological thriller, then go for it!\n\nRead On Blog!\n\nJuly 22, 2020\n\nInsidiously vicious.\n\nWhat a riveting opening and explosive ending! Pun appropriately intended. The whole first part (of six) is just so gripping to the point where I can easily see myself totally go pass my stop if I was listening on my commute. The middle parts are also really good but nothing beats that opening and ending chapters: intense, creepy and evil.\n\nMy first Japanese novel and it totally raise my expectations for the others that I’ll read. Because yes I will be exploring more books from Japan. This is just really good.\n\nrating:★★★★½\n\nMay 11, 2017\n\nThis was my first foray into Japanese fiction and it will not be last. I am now in LOVE with Japanese crime fiction and mysteries and I keep adding more to my bookshelves.\n\nI. Could. Not. Put. This. Book. Down.\n\nIt is so perfect in every way. For me, I think this is one of the most brilliant mysteries I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It's incredibly intricate where the layers get peeled back slowly until you reach the mind blowing ending.\n\nHighest Recommendation!"
