        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: On Empire this season, Nia Long plays maybe the best female foe Taraji P. Henson’s Cookie Lyon has ever had. But she’s now going to be Terrence Howard’s wife in Life In A Year, Sony’s romantic drama starring Jaden Smith and Cara Delavigne.\n\nHoward, of course, plays Cookie’s ex-husband and music mogul Lucious Lyon on the Fox series.\n\nIn Life In A Year, Long (The Best Man) will play Catherine, the spouse of Howard’s no-nonsense patriarch and the supportive mother of Daryn (Smith). The movie, now filming in Toronto, centers on 17-year-old Daryn’s love for his girlfriend Isabelle (Delavigne) who is diagnosed with cancer, and his desire to make the most of the little time they have left together.\n\nThe project also reunites Long with her on-screen Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air boyfriend from a couple of decades ago: Will Smith is producing the Mitja Okorn-directed pic for Sony and Overbrook Entertainment along with his business partner James Lassiter and Marc Bienstock.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAs well as playing scheming club owner Giuliana on Fox’s hip-hop family blockbuster and co-starring in Lifetime’s Beaches remake that aired in January, Long appears on the big screen this year in the Sundance pics Lemon and Roxanne Roxanne, which Deadline exclusively revealed in January that Neon picked up out of the Robert Redford-founded fest. Long also is set to topline The Goldbergs spinoff pilot in the works at ABC.\n\nShe is repped by CAA, Primary Wave Entertainment and attorneys at Meyer & Downs."
