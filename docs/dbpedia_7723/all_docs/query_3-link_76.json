        "text": "Perhaps Houston Rockets coach Ime Udoka thought actress Nia Long would have fogottten him by now. Last year, the NBA coach was kicked out of the Boston Celtics for being involved in a sex scandal with one of the team's employees. As collateral damage, he also ruined his relationship with fiancé Nia Long. Both Udoka and Long share an 11-year-old son. The actress recently spoke to Jeezy in an interview about the future and what she learned from her past experiences. In her statements, she said there is no use for excuses but she also had a sick burn ready for Udoka. That should be the least he deserves after what he did to Nia Long.\n\nThis is what the actress said during that interview, which is a direct dig at her ex fiancé after what he did to her: \"Black people have survived insurmountable obstacles. The journey of being Black in America is not easy. And I'm not a victim of any of it, but I'm realistic about the journey. I know how I am treated differently in certain situations. I understand that I have to raise my boys to be men. I've had some pretty devastating moments in my life over the last couple of months and I've had to just say, 'It's alright, you'll pick yourself back up and' - oh my God I'm about to cry - 'You pick yourself back up and you keep it moving.'\"\n\nHow is Ime Udoka doing now?\n\nAfter leaving the Boston Celtics, coach Ime Udoka still had that NBA Finals accomplishment on his resume. An NBA franchise would eventually offer him a contract, that team was the Houston Rockets. This season, the team from Texas is not doing great with a 4-3 record so far. During the off-season, it was reported that Ime Udoka refused to get James Harden back to the team due to undisclosed reasons. As far as Nia Long is concerned, the actress is currently trying to navigate life after such a drastic change of pace with her two sons."
