        "text": "1. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1995)\n\nSource:NBCU Photo Bank\n\nLisa Wilkes (Nia Long) stole our hearts — and Will Smith’s — as his girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. She looked like the sexy girl next door, or in Will’s case, on campus. For her look, Nia wore a long, form-fitting black dress and classic pixie cut hair.\n\n2. THE N.Y.C. PREMIERE OF ‘BLADE’ (1998)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nToni Braxton, Halle Berry, and Nia Long were the inspiration for short haircuts across America in the 90’s and 2000’s. Here, Nia is at the New York City premiere of Blade. She kept it cute and simple in a purplish-blue halter top, blue jeans, and strappy sandals. And, of course, she wore her short pixie cut.\n\n3. “Broken Hearts Club” Los Angeles Premiere (2000)\n\nSource:SGranitz/WireImage\n\nNia Long was glowing with her baby bump at the Broken Hearts Club Los Angeles Premiere. She wore an army green sleeveless jumpsuit with a jeweled belt and ear-length bob.\n\n4. The Best Man Premiere (1999)\n\nSource:Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images\n\nNia Long attended The Best Man premiere in a sparkingly below-the-knee halter dress that had a nice surprise from behind…\n\n5. The Best Man Premiere (1999)\n\nSource:Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images\n\n…It’s the back detail for me! We loved this look so much we owed it to you to show you all of it! Yes, Nia!\n\n6. 35th Annual NAACP Image Awards (2004)\n\nSource:Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nNia Long was radiant in an all-white gown as she took home an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series at the 35th Annual NAACP Image Awards. She completed the look with a sleek ponytail. What’s not to love about this look!?\n\n7. NIA LONG AT THE CARTIER CELEBRATES SANTOS 100 YEAR (2004)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nNia Long attended the Cartier Santos 100 event in a sexy two-piece suit with a lace bodysuit underneath. Who doesn’t love menswear as women’s wear on the red carpet? Her bodysuit shows off her sexy side in an otherwise structured look. Nia Long traded in her short pixie cut for a head full of loose curls.\n\n8. NIA LONG AT THE VH1 HIP HOP HONORS (2005)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nFast forward a few years later to Nia Long at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2005. She looked chic in a chocolate brown slip dress. This entire look is so timeless, it could be worn today. In true Nia Long fashion, she rocked her signature pixie cut but spiked it a little.\n\n9. ‘Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen’ Premiere (2009)\n\nSource:NDREAS BRANCH/Patrick McMullan/Getty Images\n\nThe same year, Nia Long attended ‘Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen’ Premiere looking elegant in white again. This time, the actress opted for an all-white sleeveless jumpsuit and shoulder-length hair.\n\n10. American Black Film Festival Honors Awards (2017)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nNia Long looked elegant alongside her longtime partner Ime Udoka at BET’s 2017 American Black Film Festival Honors Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel. She wore a one-shoulder knee-length flowy dress and long soft curls.\n\n11. Sundance NEXT FEST (2017)\n\nSource:Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Sundance\n\nNia Long attended the 2017 Sundance NEXT FEST at The Theater at The Ace looking casually chic in jeans, a black top, and a floor-length floral design jacket. She completed the look with a top-knot bun and a black Chanel cross-bag.\n\n12. NIA LONG AT NOWWITH AND YAHOO LIFESTYLE EVENT (2018)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nNia Long does all black so well! She attended the NowWith and Yahoo Lifestyle event in a black slip dress paired with a chic black moto jacket. This is such a good look! Who doesn’t have a classic black slip dress in their closet?\n\nOn her feet, Nia wore black Louboutin open-toe booties. She let her hair fall loosely past her shoulders. She channeled the all-black-everything vibe perfectly.\n\n13. ‘Roxanne Roxanne’ New York Premiere (2018)\n\nSource:Mike Pont/WireImage\n\nBack to black! Nia Long attended the Roxanne Roxanne New York Premiere wearing an all-black pants suit with gold button details and a black cami underneath the blazer. She pinned her hair up and had a swooped bang to complete the look.\n\n14. LA Premiere Of Entertainment Studios’ ’47 Meters Down Uncaged’ (2019)\n\nSource:Getty\n\nYes, Nia! The actress stepped out for the LA Premiere of Entertainment Studios’ “47 Meters Down Uncaged” in a powder blue, low cut cocktail dress. Can we take a moment to fully acknowledge the lengths to which she shut it down?\n\nFirst of all, this color looks heavenly against Nia’s skin. I’m a huge fan of the simple styling. Her hair is pulled back in what seems to be a faux hawk ponytail, her smoky eye is done to perfection, and the white heels offer a nice pop of color. Here for it!\n\n15. Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards (2019)\n\nSource:Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nIt’s a family affair! Nia Long attended Nickelodeon’s 2019 Kids’ Choice Awards with her sons Massai Zhivago Dorsey II (left) and Kez Sunday Udoka (middle). She kept her look casually chic with a printed jumpsuit, long jean jacket, and strappy gold heels. She wore her hair pinned in a top bun, showing off her bamboo earrings. Can we just add that we love how her sons completed her fly?"
