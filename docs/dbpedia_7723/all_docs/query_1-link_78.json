The sitcom, starring Mike Epps and Nia Long, may air as a midseason replacement. Written by Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley, the series centers on Uncle Buck (Mike Epps), a fun-loving but irresponsible guy who needs a job and a place to stay. By happy coincidence, his brother’s nanny has just quit and his brother and sister-in-law need his help. James Lesure, Iman Benson, Sayeed Shahidi and Aalyrah Caldwell co-star.\n\nCragg and Bradley executive produce with Will Packer, and Korin Huggins and Phil Traill co-executive produce. This is the second series order for feature producer (“Think Like A Man”, “Ride Along”) Packer. In his first TV development season, he scored two comedy pilots through his Universal TV-based Will Packer Prods., People Are Talking at NBC and Uncle Buck at ABC. Both have now been given series orders.\n\narticle by Lori Lakin Hutcherson (follow @lakinhutcherson)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMike Epps has been cast in the title role in Uncle Buck, ABC‘s single-camera comedy pilot based on the classic John Hughes film starring John Candy. Also cast in the project, from Universal TV and Will Packer Prods., is Nia Long.\n\nLike the movie, the series adaptation, written by Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley, centers on Buck Russell (Epps), a childish man who learns how to be an adult by taking care of his brother Will’s kids in a very childish way. Long will play Will’s strong-willed and smart wife.\n\nThe new Uncle Buck TV remake (there was a short-lived 1990s Uncle Buck CBS series starring Kevin Meaney) had been conceived with Buck as African American, giving the format a new twist. Packer is known for producing hit feature comedy franchises with Black leads, like Ride Along and Think Like A Man. On ABC, Uncle Buck would be a suitable companion for another single-camera African American family comedy, Black-ish.\n\narticle by Nellie Andreeva via deadline.com\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe 4th annual Women in Entertainment Empowerment Network Awards were held yesterday at New York’s Helen Mills Theater, bringing together a who’s who of powerful women in entertainment to celebrate one another. Honorees included Carol’s Daughter founder Lisa Price, radio personality Angela Yee, hip-hop veteran MC Lyte, financial literacy expert Lynn Richardson, fitness motivator Jeanette Jenkins, and singer Sevyn Streeter.\n\nWith past honorees like actresses Vivica A. Fox and Nia Long, radio personality Angie Martinez, and broadcaster Soledad O’Brien, the goal of WEEN is to lift up women who aspire to work in the entertainment business, while awarding those who have made great strides. WEEN’s co-founder and chair, Valeisha Butterfield-Jones, remembers the first moment when she felt she simply had no choice but to empower women.\n\n“Russell Simmons, Common, Dr. Ben Chavis, and Kevin Liles were guests on Oprah in 2006. There was an audience of women and from satellite they brought in women from Spelman talking about the misogyny in the entertainment biz and the Nelly “Tip Drill” video,” she says. “I felt like I had this huge responsibility to do something. I didn’t know what ‘do something’ meant. But I knew I was too close and too involved to be silent.”\n\nButterfield-Jones set out to make a difference. Inviting 40 women of power to a rooftop in New York to discuss issues pertaining to women in the business, the turnout more than doubled expectations: 121 women showed up to support, collaborate, and speak up. The success continued. “At the first major WEEN event at the Hammerstein Ballroom, I was super nervous. And when I arrived I saw a line of girls, thousands down 34th Street. And it was another aha moment,” says Butterfield, who served in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011 as deputy director of public affairs for International Trade. “Cause this wasn’t just something we thought could work and thought was needed. The evidence was here. Young women were crying for support and mentorship.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFresh off the success of Best Man Holiday, 43-year-old actress Nia Long has landed a new starring role on WEtv’s first original scripted series.
