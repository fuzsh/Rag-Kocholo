        "text": "Cam’ron has revealed that Nia Long left his DMs unanswered for over a year. On a recent episode of It Is What It is, Cam disclosed his failed endeavor. On Tuesday (Dec. 5), the New York rapper decided to share the message in its entirety on his Instagram.\n\n“Hey stink. I was giving you some time to yourself till I reached out,” Cam’ron’s romantic message began. “Your perseverance as a strong Black woman through this turbulent time has been something to behold. You shouldn’t be taken advantage of and exploited as you did nothing to deserve this.”\n\n“Especially all over these sports networks,” he continued. “You’re bigger and better [than] that. You’re a queen, and by the way I’m a king. Together we can achieve the greatness we were both destine [sic] for as a couple… As I sit here sipping gazpacho and watching ‘The Best Man’ I was inspired to reach out, because that’s what I am—the best man for you!! Hope to hear from you soon my Mi-amor or should I say ‘Ni-amour.'”\n\nCam’s romantic plea arrived in the aftermath of Nia’s ex-fiancé, Ime Udoka, having a cheating scandal. In 2022, Udoka, was suspended by the Boston Celtics after allegedly having an affair with Kathleen Lynch, a Celtics staffer.\n\nAfter news of Udoka’s infidelity went public, Long announced that she had broken off their engagement and voiced her displeasure with both Udoka and the Celtics, calling the latter “disappointing.”\n\nIn September, Nia addressed the situation and called out the Celtics and Kathleen. She posted a video of a Black woman “unmoved by white tears.” “Where was this level of awareness a year ago @celtics ???” she captioned the post.\n\nWatch the dramatic reading of Cam’s DM above."
