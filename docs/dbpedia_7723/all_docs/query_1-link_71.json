        "text": "Actor Nia Long has been roped in to essay a crucial role in late pop singer Michael Jackson's biopic. As per Variety, Nia will essay the role of Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson in director Antoine Fuqua's upcoming biographical drama.\n\nOn having Nia on board, Fuqua in a statement said, \"Nia has delivered iconic performances throughout her career. I've been a fan for a long time because her characters stay with you. I'm excited to now work alongside her as she pours all of that into Katherine Jackson: a woman who was the glue, the rock, and the heart of the Jackson family during its best and its most turbulent times.\"\n\nMichael is expected to chronicle the singer's complicated legacy. According to the logline, the story will portray a \"brilliant yet complicated man\" who became known as one of the greatest performers of all time. John Logan, whose screenwriting credits include Gladiator, Sweeney Todd, and the James Bond movies Skyfall and Spectre, penned the script.\n\nMichael is currently in production and slated to hit theatres on April 18, 2025. Graham King (Bohemian Rhapsody) is producing the movie with the co-executors of the Michael Jackson estate, John Branca and John McClain. Lionsgate is distributing the film domestically, while Universal Pictures International will handle all territories apart from Japan (which Lionsgate will oversee).\n\nALSO READ:Michael Jackson biopic, starring late singer’s nephew, to release in 2025"
