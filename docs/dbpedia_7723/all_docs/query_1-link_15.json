The comment section filled up with love and support. “Hey beautiful..” comments Queen Latifah. “One thing about Nia long is she doesn’t age at all..” reads another comment.\n\nSee the selfie below.\n\nNia Long has also been making recent headlines as she and her ex, Ime Udoka, have reached a settlement. The actress is set to receive $32,500 a month in child support for their 12-year-old son. According to reports, Ime was reportedly initially expected to pay $56,389 a month as he has a salary of $465,804. They both however mutually agreed on monthly $32,500 a month.\n\nAccording to the settlement, Nia Long will be in charge of “decision-making authority in case of disagreements with advance notice to her ex, with the exception of routine and emergency matters.” The two will have joint custody of their son, Kez.\n\nAfter 13 years together, Nia Long called it quits after Udoka was caught in a cheating scandal with his co-worker. She spoke about the breakup in an interview with rapper Jeezy. “I had a really public breakup recently,” she said. “It was a wakeup call for me in the sense of like, ‘OK, you’re going to do this on your own and you’re going to be fine and you’re not going to worry about what anyone thinks and has to say.’”"
