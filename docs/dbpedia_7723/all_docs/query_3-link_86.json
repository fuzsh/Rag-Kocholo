        "text": "For the students who missed it, on Feb. 1, award-winning actor Nia Long came to talk to UConn students about her trials and tribulations in Hollywood. Long engaged students in a discussion, sharing her firsthand experiences navigating the complexities of the entertainment industry as a black woman in this event— scheduled on the first day of Black History Month. Long’s talk provided a rare glimpse into the world of acting and enriched students with her insight into gender dynamics and diversity in Hollywood.\n\nSophomore student and political science major, Phoenix Harper, took the stage to introduce Nia Long, highlighting her credentials as a four-time NAACP Award winner and her notable roles in iconic films and shows such as “Boyz N the Hood,” “Friday,” “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and “Made in America.”\n\nDuring the engaging conversation, Harper questioned Long on her journey into acting and its impact on her character. Long said, “It was wonderful because I got to learn about myself and trusting my emotions and understanding them.” She attributed her entry into acting to her proficiency in portraying emotional scenes, a skill she developed through classes with actress Betty A. Bridges.\n\nThe conversation also touched upon Long’s high school connection with Regina King, an accomplished actor with accolades including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and four Primetime Emmy Awards. Long emphasized the importance of her single mother’s influence, citing financial challenges as a driving force to pursue acting.\n\n“My mother as a single mom, didn’t have a lot of money and I felt if this is a way I can make money and use all these extra tears I seem to have then, this could be a good thing,” Long said.\n\nHarper asked Long about the changes she has observed in the industry over time as a black woman. Long expressed a desire for an industry where distinctions based on race are obsolete, advocating for an environment where artists are recognized for their craft rather than their ethnicity. She candidly discussed facing daily microaggressions and highlighted the need for collective action to break generational curses and foster respect in the industry.\n\n“Everywhere I go I get asked this question, and it’s not a bad question, but it’s concerning because I want this industry to get to a place where it’s not black anything and its just artist because that is what we are.”\n\n“I have been through a lot of things in this industry and deal with microaggressions probably daily,” Long said.\n\nLong urged students to set an example for the next generation, emphasizing the role of young leaders in shaping a more inclusive and respectful future. Reflecting on her career, Long admitted to feeling stuck in repetitive roles, even contemplating quitting. She shared her belief that success comes not from pushing too hard but from trusting in her faith and finding joy in one’s pursuits.\n\n”I almost quit, I know what it feels like to be poor so I’m not driven by money but by the things that make me happy,” Long said.\n\nShe spoke of generational curses, and how we should represent and teach the people around us to respect others, and if we all come together as a community one action can enrich the world we live in. “Set an example for the kids, they are the next leaders.”\n\nLong later announced her upcoming role as Katherine Jackson, the mother of Michael Jackson, describing the character as a force within the Jackson family. She emphasized the importance of living truthfully in the role, embodying the essence of the character.\n\n“Trying to push things too much, you are not trusting and doing the things that make you happy,” Long said. “Sometimes your purpose finds you if you listen and it’s just the way the universe works.”\n\nNia Long’s visit offered valuable insights into the challenges and triumphs of a distinguished career in Hollywood. Her words resonated as a call to action for aspiring artists and advocates for positive change in the entertainment industry."
