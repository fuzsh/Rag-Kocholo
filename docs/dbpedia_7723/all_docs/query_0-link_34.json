        "text": "Lionsgate and Universal Pictures International’s Michael Jackson biopic Michael has cast Nia Long as Jackson matriarch Katherine Jackson. The Antoine Fuqua-directed movie is now shooting for an April 18, 2025 global theatrical release.\n\n“Beyond Nia’s incredible talent, I was deeply moved by her connection to the material and her commitment to honoring Katherine and the love she had for her son,” said Michael producer Graham King.\n\nFuqua added, “Nia has delivered iconic performances throughout her career. I’ve been a fan for a long time because her characters stay with you. I’m excited to now work alongside her as she pours all of that into Katherine Jackson: a woman who was the glue, the rock, and the heart of the Jackson family during its best and its most turbulent times.”\n\nLong said, “Katherine Jackson is an incredible pillar of strength and grace for the entire Jackson family. As a mother, she was selfless and endured forces beyond her control yet still managed to help build a legacy beyond measure. I am honored to bring her voice to the screen and share Michael Jackson’s story with audiences everywhere.”\n\nLong is a four-time NAACP Image Award winner and star of the Best Man franchise, Netflix’s You People, Sony’s Searching, Love Jones, Friday, Soul Food, Boyz N the Hood, and several other films and TV series.\n\nShe’ll be starring opposite Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson who will play his King of Pop uncle and recent Oscar nominee Colman Domingo, who will play Katherine’s husband Joe n the movie scripted by three-time Oscar nominee John Logan.\n\nLong is represented by Verve Talent and Literary Agency and Meyer & Downs.\n\nMichael is also produced by the co-executors of the Michael Jackson estate, John Branca and John McClain. Lionsgate has domestic distribution, while UPI has all offshore territories sans Japan."
