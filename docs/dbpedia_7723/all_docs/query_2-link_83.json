        "text": "After sliding into Nia Long’s DM over a year ago to shoot his shot, Cam’ron finally was able to meet up with the actress. The two met up at Rich Paul’s 42nd birthday party.\n\nCam’ron shared the photos of he and Long on Instagram.\n\n“He want the scoop, she want the tea, I can not talk, we keeping it street!!” he captioned his post. “@iamnialong aka Ni-Amore.”\n\nIn a new episode of It Is What It Is, Cam discussed the meet-up with his co-host, Ma$e. He explained that he gave Long his number and she described his shot “fly.”\n\n“People are doing exactly what you’re saying, ‘Look, Cam don’t mess this up.’ Look, I met my Ni-Amore. She was very very cool,” he recalled. “So she says, ‘You’re funny, you’re hilarious.’ I said, ‘But yo did you see my DM? It wasn’t opened.’ And she said, ‘Yeah, I seen it.’ I said, ‘What you [think] about it?’ And she said, ‘Nah, that was fly.’ And that’s it, people.”"
