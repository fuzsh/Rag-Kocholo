        "text": "Actress Nia Long is seeking full custody of the 11-year-old son that she shares with Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka.\n\nLong and Udoka split up last year after 13 years together following a workplace affair that Udoka had while he was head coach of the Boston Celtics.\n\nLong filed a case in Los Angeles County Court asking for full custody of the former couple’s son, Kez, according to The Blast.\n\nShe is also seeking for Udoka to pay all of the attorney fees attributable to the case.\n\nThe outlet said that this is “just the beginning of what will most likely become a custody case, which will include some sort of child support.”\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in December, Long spoke about the toll the situation took on her and her son.\n\n“I think the most heartbreaking thing about all of this was seeing my son’s face when the Boston Celtics organization decided to make a very private situation public,” Long said at the time.\n\n“It was devastating, and it still is. He still has moments where it’s not easy for him. If you’re in the business of protecting women — I’m sorry, no one from the Celtics organization has even called to see if I’m OK, to see if my children are OK. It’s very disappointing.”\n\nLast September, Udoka released a statement apologizing for his conduct.\n\n“I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family for letting them down,” the statement said.\n\n“I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team’s decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment.”\n\nUdoka was hired as the head coach of the Rockets in April.\n\n“The NBA told me that they feel very comfortable with Ime becoming coach of the Houston Rockets, and so that made me feel good after a lengthy, lengthy conversation with them,” Houston owner Tilman Fertitta said after the hiring."
