        "text": "In 2019, Old Spice launched “Men Have Skin Too,” an episodic campaign following a couple that shares a love for Old Spice’s line of moisturizing products. Starring comedians Deon Cole (Black-ish) and Gabrielle Dennis (A Black Lady Sketch Show), the spots feature a husband who is unable to hold onto his favorite Old Spice items due to his wife’s tendency to “borrow” them. Her boundary-crossing habits have fueled an expanded universe that has seen multiple short films and major supporting stars, like Patti LaBelle as the equally overstepping mother-in-law.\n\nThe campaign’s latest installment sends the embattled couple to therapy, where they explore their issues with a mental health professional played by actress Nia Long.\n\nWORK SMARTER - LEARN, GROW AND BE INSPIRED.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nTo Read the Full Story Become an Adweek+ Subscriber\n\nView Subscription Options\n\nAlready a member?
