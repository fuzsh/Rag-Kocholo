        "text": "Veteran actress Nia Long took to social media to address the alleged mistress of his ex-fiance Ime Udoka for the first time after their cheating scandal was made public. The affair between Udoka and his alleged mistress, Kathleen Lynch, happened while he was coaching the Boston Celtics.\n\nUdoka, 46, stepped down as coach after their affair came to light. Lynch – a married woman and mother – was also the basketball franchise’s team service manager. Long ultimately called out Lynch as well as the Boston Celtics for how it handled the cheating scandal in a caption for a video she reposted on Instagram, Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe video in question was a discussion between writer Dr. Yaba Blay and Glennon Doyle on the We Can Do Hard podcast. Dr. Blay was touching on how the pain of Black women is relegated to the background while that of White women isn’t.\n\n“Where was this level of awareness a year ago @celtics ??? #kathleenlynch,” Long captioned in the post. A number of celebrities sent words of support to Long in the comments section.\n\n“Accountability to my sis and nefews. retribution is in order I stands with u @iamnialong I. got ya bac,” rapper Snoop Dogg commented with a rose and praying hands emoji. “Love u,” the Boyz n the Hood star replied.\n\nLong in the comments section also thanked Dr. Blay for her “fearlessness and speaking facts for all of us.” “This is such an important conversation that needs to be heard and understood,” she added.\n\nFollowing the publicity of the affair, Long condemned the actions the Celtics took in response to the scandal. She told The Hollywood Reporter that the basketball franchise had failed to call to check if she or her two sons were OK. Long and Udoka share one of her sons.\n\n“If you’re in the business of protecting women — I’m sorry, no one from the Celtics organization has even called to see if I’m OK, to see if my children are OK,” she said. “I think the most heartbreaking thing about all of this was seeing my son’s face when the Boston Celtics organization decided to make a very private situation public.”\n\nThe 52-year-old said she was relocating to Los Angeles with her son. “I went home to be with my son, and that was what was most important to me, because he was not having an easy time,” Long said, adding that she had to withdraw her son from school as a result of the affair.\n\n“It was devastating, and it still is,” Long said. The actress also revealed her 11-year-old son “still has moments where it’s not easy for him.”"
