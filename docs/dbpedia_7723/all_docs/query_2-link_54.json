And while she's unapologetically Black in real life and onscreen, she wants people to know that the art she makes is available for everyone to indulge in.\n\n\"I'm here to represent who we are, and if you want to come along for the ride, everyone's welcome!\"\n\nAnd that's that on that!\n\nTo learn more about Nia and her latest project, The Best Man: The Final Chapters, be sure to check out her full BuzzFeed interview.\n\nShare This Article"
