        "text": "Nia Long has reportedly filed for full custody of her son Kez, who she shares with former fiancé Ime Udoka, following his alleged affair.\n\nAccording to Essence, Long's attorney Samantha Spector filed a petition seeking to \"determine a parental relationship\" as the couple never got married. Long reportedly requested Udoka, the newly-appointed Houston Rockets coach, receive visitation rights and cover all attorney fees.\n\nThe move comes after Udoka, the former Boston Celtics coach, was banned from the franchise for a year after reportedly engaging in an improper and consensual relationship with a woman on the team's staff.\n\nLong previously spoke out about how the alleged cheating scandal affected her son.\n\n“I think the most heartbreaking thing about all of this was seeing my son’s face when the Boston Celtics organization decided to make a very private situation public,” Long said. “It was devastating, and it still is. He still has moments where it’s not easy for him. If you’re in the business of protecting women — I’m sorry, no one from the Celtics organization has even called to see if I’m OK, to see if my children are OK. It’s very disappointing.”\n\nLong, who got engaged to Udoka in 2015, said she was appreciative of the overwhelming support she received amid the allegations.\n\n“What I found was this tribe of women and men who were standing up for me in a way that felt like I was in this bubble of protection, and that was very comforting,” she previously said."
