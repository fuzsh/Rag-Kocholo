        "text": "Nia Long has nothing left to prove. The actress, who first came to fame in 1991’s Boyz n the Hood, has been perfecting her craft for decades. Long became one of Hollywood’s “It” girls in the 1990s when she starred in the later seasons of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and the comedy film Friday. Leading roles in movies like Love Jones, Soul Food, and The Best Man soon followed, and her talent and undeniable beauty quickly made the New York native a mainstay in pop culture — so much so that her name has been featured in at least 20 hip-hop songs by artists such as Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Nas, and Missy Elliott.\n\nIn the years that followed, Long solidified her place as an A-list star with performances in The Best Man Holiday and Are We There Yet?, several NAACP Image Awards, and a return to television on Fox’s Empire and CBS’ NCIS: Los Angeles. The actress also made time to start a family, welcoming a son with Massai Z. Dorsey in 2000 and a second son in 2011 with her then-fiancé, Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka. Actress, fiancée, mother, mentor — Long was doing it all. Her ability to be everything to everyone came to a halt in September 2022, however, when it was revealed that Udoka had an affair with a female Celtics staff member. Long said at the time that the affair was “devastating” and “heartbreaking,” adding that no one in the Celtics organization reached out to check on her or her children.\n\nNow, newly single and basking in the possibilities of the new year, Long is making the time to focus on herself.\n\n“[I’m looking forward to] peace and a clear space [this year]. Just peace and doing the things that make me happy,” Long says. “Being able to do whatever I want when I want to do it and putting myself first because I think, for a long time, I’ve put everyone else first. My kids are both of a certain age where they actually can take care of themselves. I’m not doing the day-to-day caretaking.”\n\nNia Long attends the Los Angeles premiere of You People at Regency Village Theatre on January 17.\n\nPrioritizing her happiness includes pursuing her dreams, and Long has already accomplished one goal from her list. The actress always wanted to work alongside comedy legend Eddie Murphy, a dream she says she’s had her “whole life.” Long fulfilled that dream when she was cast to play Fatima Mohammed, the wife of Murphy’s character, in Netflix’s You People. The comedy, which is available to stream on January 27, follows a Black Muslim woman and a Jewish man who unexpectedly find love in Los Angeles. When their families gather to plan the wedding, hilarious high jinks ensue. Starring Jonah Hill, Lauren London, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in addition to Murphy and Long, You People is a smart, modern take on the cultural clashes that can occur when two diverse families get together.\n\n“I’ve watched Eddie my whole life, and he’s an icon, and he’s a comedic genius, and to be able to tell my great-great-grandkids — ’cause I’m gonna be around for a while — like, ‘Oh, y’all didn’t know Eddie Murphy, but I did. I was there for that,’” Long says with a laugh. “[In this film], there’s already pressure when the in-laws or the potential in-laws meet one another. On top of that, you have these two families that come from completely different experiences and cultures. The stakes are higher. Everyone’s sort of being on their best behavior, yet things slip out that are completely inappropriate. And I think, in the real world, that happens.”\n\nYou People isn’t afraid to push the boundaries (lines about the Holocaust, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and U.S. slavery provide some of the biggest laughs in the film), and the cast is very much in on the joke. Long says that the actors were all consummate professionals who knew how to find the humor without being offensive, thanks in part to a creative script written by Hill and director Kenya Barris.\n\n“I think the actors in this film are responsible with who they’re representing and who they are. All of the actors here have had experiences within their own culture. We’re just telling a story,” Long says. “I think one of the things that’s important [about this film] is that if we’re ever going to get to a place where we have true understanding and cultural acceptance, we have to have empathy. We have to realize that not everything is personal. Yes, we have to be aware of history. Yes, we have to acknowledge history. Yes, we need to teach our children about history. But sometimes people just don’t know.”\n\nLong’s character, in particular, knows how to strike the balance between concerned parent and clueless mama. Fatima is by far the most empathetic of all the parents featured in You People, in part because Long drew from her own experiences. When it comes to her elder son’s dating life, Long says she’s learned to trust his instincts, and Fatima very much mirrors that choice. While Long stresses that she’s usually more vocal than Fatima, she’s learned to appreciate the art of being subtle.\n\n“I’m not the perfect mother; I’ve made many mistakes,” Long explains. “I think there’s no such thing as a perfect mother. Also, you don’t want to be a perfect mother because you want your kids to see you recover from mistakes, from challenges, from heartaches and conflict in your life. That’s part of teaching them how to manage their own lives. I’m very open with my children; we talk about everything. My son has a girlfriend right now, and she’s very, very sweet and beautiful. I approve, and he knows I approve, but there were a few in the past that were questionable. I didn’t say anything. I just kept my mouth shut because I knew it wasn’t going to work. I was actually shocked that I didn’t say anything. I kind of tapped into my inner Fatima.”\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou People is available to stream now on Netflix.\n\nMariel Turner is the Senior Culture Editor at Shondaland.
