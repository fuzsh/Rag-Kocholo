        "text": "Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka will reportedly pay actress Nia Long $32,500 per month in child support for their 12-year-old son, of whom they now have joint custody, according to court documents, per The Blast.\n\nLong, 53, reportedly gave Udoka, 46, a break in child support payments because she is a wealthy actress. He had to pay $56,389, but his ex-girlfriend allowed the payments to be over $20,000 lower.\n\nUdoka's monthly disposable income is $465,804 and their son spends 95 percent of the time with Long, who first wanted full custody and only visitation rights for him.\n\nThe former couple split up in 2022 after Udoka had an alleged affair with a co-worker while working as the head coach of the Boston Celtics.\n\nNia Long moved on from Ime Udoka\n\nLong has stated several times that she moved on from Udoka and wishes him nothing but the best. The actress is even taking on potential suitors.\n\nWell, at least one. Cam'ron, a rapper, shot Long a direct message and met her shortly after at the birthday party of NBA agent Rich Paul, who is one of LeBron James' best friends."
