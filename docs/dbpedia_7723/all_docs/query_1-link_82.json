        "text": "Usher has reassured Nia Long that he will be back in Las Vegas soon after she expressed regret at missing out on seeing his residency concert series.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday (December 3), the Friday actor said: “My only regret this year is missing @Usher in Vegas,” seemingly brushing off the drama surrounding her estranged fiancé Ime Udoka cheating on her.\n\nUsher saw the post and replied: “Don’t worry…I’ll be back in Vegas on 2/11.”\n\nThe date in the post refers to Super Bowl LVIII, where Usher will be the halftime show entertainment. The game is due to be played at Allegiant Stadium, home to the Last Vegas Raiders.\n\nUsher and Nia Long’s exchange comes shortly after the former wrapped up his My Way Las Vegas residency at Dolby Live — Park MGM after a run of exactly 100 shows.\n\nThe R&B legend was visibly emotional during his final show and broke down crying during a performance of “Without You.” In a fan-shot video, Usher can be seen dropping to his knees and covering his face as he is surrounded by his backing dancers.\n\nHe then starts crying and turns away from the sold-out crowd before saying: “God bless you, I love you.”\n\nCelebrating the 25th anniversary of his debut album My Way, Usher’s Las Vegas residency has created multiple viral moments since it began in July 2022.\n\nThe most headline-worthy came this past June when he serenaded Keke Palmer, causing some drama with Palmer’s now ex-boyfriend Darius Jackson.\n\nIn response to the viral clip of Usher singing to Palmer, Jackson wrote on social media: “It’s the outfit tho.. you a mom,” taking issue with the actress’ risque dress.\n\nJackson was subsequently slammed for his criticism of Palmer’s outfit, but later doubled down on his remarks by saying: “We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is.\n\n“This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case.”"
