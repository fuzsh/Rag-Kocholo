Nia Long is set to tell her story in her own words. Exclusively reported by ESSENCE, the 52-year-old is releasing a memoir focusing on her career, motherhood, and activism. Additionally, the work will feature untold stories and personal reflections from the leading lady.

“I am thrilled to have found a home for my memoir at Gallery and 13a,” explained the actress. “My steps to finding divine purpose have been thoughtful and intentional. For better or worse, you will find truth and transparency in the storytelling, sprinkled with ’90s nostalgia.”

“Nia Long’s life has unfolded on screen, right before our eyes, from Boyz n the Hood to Love Jones, and beyond,” added Charles Suitt, publisher of 13a. “Yet there is just something so relatable about her. She is a trailblazer who is all about action. We are looking forward to her telling her truth, as only Nia can.”

According to the outlet, 13a is named for the amendment that abolished slavery. The imprint of Simon & Schuster focuses on publishing the leading Black voices in sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and other areas.
