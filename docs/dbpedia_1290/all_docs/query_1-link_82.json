        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nFor the first female director of Public Health, see Sara Josephine Baker.\n\nJosephine Baker (June 3, 1906 â April 12, 1975) was an American expatriate entertainer and actress. She became a French citizen in 1937. Most noted as a singer, Baker also was a celebrated dancer in her early career. She was given the nicknames the \"Bronze Venus\" or the \"Black Pearl\", as well as the \"CrÃ©ole Goddess\" in anglophone nations. In France, she has always been known as \"La Baker\".\n\nBaker was the first African American female to star in a major motion picture, to integrate an American concert hall, and to become a world-famous entertainer. She is also noted for her contributions to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States (she was offered the leadership of the movement by Coretta Scott King in 1968 following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, but turned it down), for assisting the French Resistance during the Second World War and being the first American-born woman to receive the highest French military honor, the Croix de Guerre, and for being an inspiration to generations of African American female entertainers and others.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n\n1.2 Rise to fame\n\n1.3 Civil rights activism\n\n1.4 Personal life\n\n1.4.1 Marriages\n\n1.4.2 Death\n\n2 Legacy\n\n2.1 Portrayals\n\n3 Filmography\n\n4 References\n\n5 Further reading\n\n6 External links\n\n[edit] Biography\n\n[edit] Early years\n\nBaker was born Freda Josephine McDonald on June 3, 1906 in St. Louis, Missouri,[1][2] the daughter of Carrie McDonald. Baker's true ethnic background is unknown. Her father's identity is debated among historians. Nevertheless her estate credits vaudeville drummer Eddi Carson as her natural father,[3] but according to a biography written by her foster son Jean-Claude Baker:\n\nâ â¦ (Josephine Baker's) father was identified (on the birth certificate) simply as \"Edw\" â¦ I think Josephine's father was white â so did Josephine, so did her family â¦ people in St. Louis say that (Josephine's mother) had worked for a German family (around the time she became pregnant). (Carrie) let people think Eddie Carson was the father, and Carson played along â¦ (but) Josephine knew better.[4] â\n\nHer mother, Carrie, was adopted in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1886 by Richard and Elvira McDonald, both of whom were former slaves of both African and Native American descent.[4]\n\nWhen Josephine was 8 she was sent to work for a white woman who abused her and burned Josephine's hands when she put too much soap in the laundry. She later went to work for another woman.\n\nBaker dropped out of school at the age of 12 and lived as a street child in the black slums of St Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters and scavenging for food in garbage cans. Her street-corner dancing attracted attention and success for her, and she was recruited for the St. Louis Chorus vaudeville show at 15. She then headed to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, performing at the Plantation Club and in the chorus of the popular Broadway revues Shuffle Along (1921) and The Chocolate Dandies (1924). She performed as the last dancer in a chorus line, a position in which the dancer traditionally performed in a comic manner, as if they were unable to remember the dance, until the encore, at which point they would not only perform it correctly, but with additional complexity. She was then billed as \"the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville.\"\n\nOn October 2, 1925, she opened in Paris at the ThÃ©atre des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, where she became an instant success for her erotic dancing and for appearing practically nude on stage. After a successful tour of Europe, she reneged on her contract and returned to France to star at the Folies BergÃ¨res, setting the standard for her future acts. She performed the Danse sauvage, wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Baker's success coincided (1925) with the Exposition des Arts DÃ©coratifs, which gave us the term \"Art Deco\", and also with a renewal of interest in ethnic forms of art, including African. Baker represented one aspect of this fashion. She was very creative and loved sequins and feathers. She also loved to be sexy and wear short shorts and low tops.\n\nIn later shows in Paris she was often accompanied on stage by her pet cheetah, Chiquita, who was adorned with a diamond collar. The cheetah frequently escaped into the orchestra pit, where it terrorized the musicians, adding another element of excitement to the show.\n\n[edit] Rise to fame\n\nAfter a short while she was the most successful American entertainer working in France. Ernest Hemingway called her \"â¦ the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.\" In addition to being a musical star, Baker also starred in three films which found success only in Europe: the silent film Siren of the Tropics (1927), Zouzou (1934) and Princesse Tam Tam (1935). Although Baker is often credited as a movie star, her starring roles ended with Princesse Tamtam in 1935.\n\nAt this time she also scored her greatest song hit, \"J'ai deux amours\" (1931) and became a muse for contemporary authors, painters, designers, and sculptors including Langston Hughes, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, and Christian Dior.\n\nUnder the management of Giuseppe Pepito Abatino â a Sicilian former stonemason who passed himself off as a Sicilian count â Baker's stage and public persona, as well as her singing voice, went through a significant transformation. In 1934 she took the lead in a revival of Jacques Offenbach's 1875 opera La crÃ©ole at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Marigny in the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es of Paris, which premiered in December of that year for a six month run. In preparation for her performances she went through months of training with a vocal coach.\n\nIn the words of Shirley Bassey, who has cited Baker as her primary influence, \"â¦ she went from a 'petite danseuse sauvage' with a decent voice to 'la grande diva magnifique' â¦ I swear in all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer.\"\n\nBaker was so well known and popular with the French that even the Nazis, who occupied France during World War II, were hesitant to cause her harm. In turn, this allowed Baker to show her loyalty to her adopted country by participating in the Underground, smuggling intelligence to the resistance in Portugal coded within her sheet music. After the war, for her underground activity, Baker received the Croix de Guerre, the Rosette de la RÃ©sistance, and was made a Chevalier of the LÃ©gion d'honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.[5]\n\nDespite her popularity in France, she never obtained the same reputation in America. Upon a visit to the United States in 1936, she starred in a failed version of the Ziegfeld Follies (being replaced by Gypsy Rose Lee later in the run), her personal life similarly suffered, and she went through six marriages, some legal, some not.\n\nHer 1935â36 US performances received poor reviews. Baker returned to Paris in 1937, married Frenchman Jean Lion, and became a French citizen.[6]\n\nIn January 1966 she was invited by Fidel Castro to perform at the Teatro Musical de La Habana in Havana, Cuba. Her spectacular show in April of that year led to record breaking attendance.\n\nIn 1973, Baker opened at Carnegie Hall to a standing ovation.\n\n[edit] Civil rights activism\n\nAlthough based in France, Baker supported the American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s. She protested in her own way against racism, adopting 12 multi-ethnic orphans, whom she called the \"Rainbow Tribe.\"[7] They were: Akio (Korean son), Janot (Japanese son), Luis (Colombian son), Jari (Finnish son), Jean-Claude (Canadian son), MoÃ¯se (French Jewish son), Brahim (Algerian son), Marianne (French daughter), Koffi (Ivorian son), Mara (Venezuelan son), NoÃ«l (French son), and Stellina (Moroccan daughter).[8]\n\nFor some time she lived with all of her children and an enormous staff in a castle, ChÃ¢teau de Milandes, in Dordogne, France. Baker bore only one child, stillborn in 1941, an incident that precipitated an emergency hysterectomy.\n\nShe refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States.[9] Her insistence on mixed audiences helped to integrate shows in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn 1951, Baker made charges of racism against Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club in New York, where she had been refused service. Actress Grace Kelly, who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party, vowing to never return (and she never did). The two women became close friends after the incident. Testament to this was made evident when Baker was near bankruptcy and was offered a villa and financial assistance by Kelly (who by then was princess consort of Rainier III of Monaco).\n\nBaker also worked with the NAACP.[9] In 1963, she spoke at the March on Washington at the side of Martin Luther King, Jr.[10] Wearing her Free French uniform emblazoned with her medal of the LÃ©gion d'honneur, she was the only woman to speak at the rally.[11] After King's assassination his widow, Coretta Scott King, approached Baker in Holland to ask if she would take her husband's place as leader of the American Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, Baker declined, saying her children were \"â¦ too young to lose their mother.\"[12]\n\n[edit] Personal life\n\n[edit] Marriages\n\nWillie Wells (foundry worker, 1919)\n\nWilliam Howard Baker (Pullman porter, 1920â23)\n\nJean Lion (French sugar magnate, 1937â38)\n\nJo Bouillon (orchestra leader, 1947â57)\n\nShe also went through two non-legal wedding ceremonies to Giuseppe Pepito Abatino in 1926 and American artist Robert Brady in 1973.\n\nOn April 8, 1975, Baker starred in a retrospective revue at the Bobino in Paris â JosÃ©phine Ã Bobino 1975, celebrating her 50 years in show business. The revue, financed by Prince Rainier, Princess Grace, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, opened to rave reviews. Demand for seating was such that fold-out chairs had to be added to accommodate spectators. The opening-night audience included Sophia Loren, Mick Jagger, Shirley Bassey, Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli.[13]\n\n[edit] Death\n\nTwo days later, Baker was found lying peacefully in her bed surrounded by newspapers with glowing reviews of her performance. She had a coma after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. She was taken to PitiÃ©-SalpÃªtriÃ¨re Hospital, where she died aged 68 on April 12, 1975.[13][14]\n\nHer funeral was held at L'Ãglise de la Madeleine. The first American woman to receive full French military honors at her funeral, Josephine Baker locked up the streets of Paris one last time. She was interred at the CimetiÃ¨re de Monaco in Monte Carlo.[13]\n\n[edit] Legacy\n\nHer affection for France was so great that when World War II broke out, she volunteered to spy for her adopted country. Josephine's agent's older brother approached her about working for the French government as an \"honorable correspondent\" -- if she happened to hear any gossip at parties that might be of use to her adopted country, she could report it. Josephine immediately agreed, since she was against the Nazi stand on race not only because she was black but because her husband was Jewish. Her cafÃ© society fame enabled her to rub shoulders with those in the know, from high-ranking Japanese officials to Italian bureaucrats, and report back what she heard. She was able to do things such as attend parties at the Italian embassy without any suspicion falling on her and gather information that turned out to be useful. She also helped in the war effort in other ways, such as by sending Christmas presents to French soldiers.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded France, Josephine left Paris and went to her home in the south of France, where she had Belgian refugees living with her and others who were eager to help the Free French effort led by Charles de Gaulle from England. As an entertainer, Josephine had an excuse for moving around Europe, visiting neutral Portugal, coming back to France, and such. Baker assisted the French Resistance by smuggling secrets written in invisible ink on her sheet music.\n\nShe helped mount a production in Marseilles on the south coast of France to give herself and her like-minded friends a reason for being there. She helped quite a lot of people who were in danger from the Nazis get visas and passports to leave France. Later in 1941, she and her entourage went to the French colonies in North Africa; the stated reason was Josephine's health (since she really was recovering from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain and pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid a strip search) and made friends with the Pasha of Marrakesh, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several) and emergency hysterectomy she had to go through in 1942. Despite the state of medicine in that time and place, she recovered, and started touring to entertain Allied soldiers in North Africa. She even persuaded Egypt's King Farouk to make a public appearance at one of her concerts, a subtle indication of which side his officially neutral country leaned toward. Later, she would perform at Buchenwald for the liberated inmates who were too frail to be moved. Baker became the first American-born woman to receive the highest French military honor, the Croix de Guerre.\n\n\"Place JosÃ©phine Baker\" in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris was named in her honor. She has also been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame and the Hall of Famous Missourians. Her name has also been incorporated at Paris Plage, a man-made beach along the river Seine \"Piscine JosÃ©phine Baker\".\n\nTwo of Baker's adopted sons, Jean-Claude and Jarry (Jari), grew up to go into business together, running the restaurant Chez Josephine on Theatre Row, 42nd Street, New York, which celebrates Baker's life and works.[15]\n\nBaker's iconic performance style has also been influential. Diana Ross, a long-time admirer of Baker, performed in Bob Mackie-designed outfits similar to Baker's and reenacted similar poses of the latter in many photo sessions. Whitney Houston pays tribute to Baker in her \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" music video to represent the Harlem Renaissance. Baker's banana skirt, in particular, has made numerous media appearance. A dancer wore one in Sir-Mix-A-Lot's 1991 video for \"Baby Got Back\", and singer BeyoncÃ© Knowles wore one when performing for CBS's 2006 Fashion Rocks. During her performance, images of Baker were projected on a large screen above the stage.\n\n[edit] Portrayals\n\nIn 1991, Baker's life story, \"The Josephine Baker Story\", was broadcast on HBO. Lynn Whitfield played Baker, beating more than 500 actresses for the role, including Whitney Houston. The performance won her the Emmy for \"Best Actress In A Mini-Series or Special\".\n\nThe first scene of the 2003 French animated film Les Triplettes de Belleville is of a 1930s-style cartoon parody that features a caricature of Baker\n\nThe 2004 erotic novel Scandalous by British author Angela Campion uses Baker as its heroine and is inspired by Baker's sexual exploits and later adventures in the French Resistance. In the novel, Baker, working with a fictional black Canadian lover named Drummer Thompson, foils a plot by French fascists in 1936 Paris. The novel is said to be the first time a historical figure has been used as the heroine in a modern erotic novel.\n\nIn 2006, the director of the OpÃ©ra-Comique of Paris, JÃ©rÃ´me Savary, presented his Ã la Recherche de JosÃ©phine (Searching for Josephine), a musical inspired by Baker's musical revues and songs from her early career. It tells the story of a French director in search of a star for his Parisian show in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. He finds Baker, who becomes the toast of Paris. It was a huge success and has toured in Louisiana.\n\nIn the 1997 animated film \"Anastasia\", Baker appears with her cheetah during the musical number \"Paris Holds the Key (to Your Heart)\"\n\nA German submariner mimics Josephine Baker's \"Danse banane\" in the film Das Boot.\n\n[edit] Filmography\n\nLa SirÃ¨ne des tropiques (1927) aka Siren of the Tropics at the Internet Movie Database\n\nZouzou (1934) at the Internet Movie Database\n\nPrincesse Tam Tam (1935) aka Princess Tam-Tam at the Internet Movie Database\n\nMoulin Rouge (1941) at the Internet Movie Database\n\nFausse alerte (1945) aka The French Way at the Internet Movie Database\n\nAn jedem Finger zehn (1954) aka Ten on Every Finger at the Internet Movie Database\n\nCarosello del varietÃ (1955) at the Internet Movie Database\n\nGrÃ¼sse aus ZÃ¼rich (1963) at the Internet Movie Database (ZDF TV)\n\n[edit] References\n\n[edit] Further reading\n\nThe Josephine Baker collection, 1926â2001 (call number M1297; 3 linear ft.) are housed in the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Stanford University Libraries\n\nKraut, Anthea, Between Primitivism and Diaspora: The Dance Performances of Josephine Baker, Zora Neale Hurston, and Katherine Dunham, Theatre Journal 55 (2003): 433â50.\n\nSchroeder, Alan, Ragtime Tumpie (Little, Brown, 1989), a children's picture book about Baker's childhood in St. Louis and her dream of becoming a dancer.\n\nSchroeder, Alan, Josephine Baker (Chelsea House, 1990), a young-adult biography.\n\n[edit] External links\n\nJosephine Baker Official website\n\nJosephine Baker at Allmusic\n\nJosephine Baker at the Internet Broadway Database\n\nJosephine Baker at the Internet Movie Database (self)\n\nJosephine Baker at the Internet Movie Database (character)\n\nA la recherche de JosÃ©phine official site\n\nA Josephine Baker photo gallery\n\nJosephine Baker Photographs in the Western Historical Manuscript Collection at the University of Missouri-St. Louis"
