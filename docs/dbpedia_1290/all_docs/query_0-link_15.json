        "text": "1935\n\n1 hr 17 mins\n\nMusic, Comedy\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nJosephine Baker stars in a \"Pygmalion\"-like story of an uninhibited young Tunisian woman who poses as a serene Indian princess in Paris, where she is introduced to French society by a celebrated author. Baker's then-husband, Pepito Abatino, wrote the screenplay. The film was banned in the United States because of its mixed-race romance."
