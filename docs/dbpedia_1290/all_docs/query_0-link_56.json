        "text": "Josephine Baker\n\nJosephine Baker (born Freda Josephine McDonald; 3 June 1906 â 12 April 1975) was an African-American expatriate singer and entertainer, whose career was centered primarily in Europe and in particular in her adoptive country of France. In her early career she was also renowned as a dancer, and was among the most celebrated performers to headline in the lavish revues of the Folies BergÃ¨re in Paris. Her performance in the revue Un Vent de Folie in 1927 caused a sensation in Paris, with Baker in her costume consisting of only a girdle of bananas becoming not only her most iconic image but also a symbol of the jazz age and the 1920's. She was celebrated by all of the great artists and intellectuals of the era, with various circles dubbing her the \"Black Pearl\", the \"Bronze Venus\", as well as the \"Creole Goddess\". Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she renounced her U.S. citizenship to become a citizen of France in 1937 upon her marriage to Jean Lyon.\n\nBaker was the first person of African descent to become a world-famous entertainer and to star in a major motion picture in the silent film La Sirene des Tropiques (fr) (1927). Baker refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States and is noted for her contributions to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1968 she was offered unofficial leadership in the movement in the United States by Coretta Scott King, following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. After thinking it over, Baker declined the offer due to her children.\n\nShe was also known for helping the French Resistance during World War II, and received the French military honor, the Croix de guerre and was made a Chevalier of the LÃ©gion d'honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.\n\nJosephine Baker was born Freda Josephine McDonald in St. Louis, Missouri, Baker's racial and ethnic descent are unknown. Her mother, Carrie, was adopted in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1886 by Richard and Elvira McDonald, both of whom were former slaves of African and Native American descent. Josephine Baker's estate identifies vaudeville drummer Eddie Carson as her natural father despite evidence to the contrary. Baker's foster son Jean-Claude Baker wrote a biography on her that was published in 1993 titled Josephine: The Hungry Heart. Jean-Claude Baker did an exhaustive amount of research into the life of Josephine Baker, including the identity of her biological father. In the book, he discusses at length the circumstances surrounding Josephine Baker's birth:\n\nâ The records of the city of St. Louis tell an almost unbelievable story. They show that (Josephine Baker's mother) Carrie McDonald...was admitted to the (exclusively white) Female Hospital on May 3, 1906, diagnosed as pregnant. She was discharged on June 17, her baby, Freda J. McDonald having been born two weeks earlier. Why six weeks in the hospital? Especially for a black woman (of that time) who would customarily have had her baby at home with the help of a mid-wife? Obviously there had been complications with the pregnancy, but Carrie's chart reveals no details.\n\nThe father was identified (on the birth certificate) simply as \"Edw\" ... I think Josephine's father was whiteâso did Josephine, so did her family ... people in St. Louis say that (Baker's mother) had worked for a German family (around the time she became pregnant). He's the one who must have got her into that hospital and paid to keep her there all those weeks. Also, her baby's birth was registered by the head of the hospital at a time when most black births were not. I have unraveled many mysteries associated with Josephine Baker, but the most painful mystery of her life, the mystery of her father's identity, I could not solve. The secret died with Carrie, who refused to the end to talk about it. She let people think Eddie Carson was the father, and Carson played along, Josephine knew better.â\n\nWhen Baker was eight she was sent to work for a white woman who abused her, burning Baker's hands when she put too much soap in the laundry. She later went to work for another woman.\n\nCarrie McDonald and Eddie Carson had a song-and-dance act, playing wherever they could get work. When Josephine was about a year old they began to carry her onstage occasionally during their finale. She was further exposed to show business at an early age because her childhood neighborhood was home to many vaudeville theaters that doubled as movie houses. These venues included the Jazzland, Booker T. Washington, and Comet Theatres.\n\nJosephine lived her early life at 212 Targee Street (known by some St. Louis residents as Johnson Street) in the Mill Creek Valley neighborhood of St. Louis, a racially mixed low income neighborhood near Union Station, consisting mainly of rooming houses, brothels and apartments with no indoor plumbing. Targee Street, where Josephine lived, had gained notoriety in October 1899, when a 22-year-old prostitute named Frankie Baker (no relation to Josephine) discovered her lover/pimp Al Britt (referred to in various sources as Allen or Albert) with another woman, and shot him in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. The incident was immortalized that year by songwriter Bill Dooley, in a song called \"Frankie Killed Allen\", which later was revamped as the American classic blues ballad \"Frankie and Johnny\".\n\nJosephine was always poorly dressed and hungry as a child, and developed street smarts playing in the railroad yards of Union Station. She had little formal education, and attended Lincoln Elementary School only through the fifth grade.\n\nJosephine's mother married a kind but perpetually unemployed man, Arthur Martin, with whom she had a son and two more daughters. She took in laundry to wash to make ends meet, and at eight years old, Josephine began working as a live-in domestic for white families in St. Louis. One woman abused her, burning Josephine's hands when the young girl put too much soap in the laundry.\n\nAt 13, Josephine also worked as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur's Club at 3133 Pine Street. She also lived as a street child in the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living with street-corner dancing. It was at the Old Chauffeur's Club where Josephine met Willie Wells and married him the same year. However, the marriage lasted less than a year and she left Wells to join a black Vaudeville group.\n\nIn Baker's teen years she struggled to have a healthy relationship with her mother, Carrie McDonald, who did not want Josephine to become an entertainer, and scolded Baker for not tending to her [Josephine's own] second husband, Willie Baker, whom she had married in 1921 at age 15. Although she left Willie Baker when her vaudeville troupe was booked into a New York City venue and divorced him in 1925, it was during this time she began to see significant career success, and she continued to use his last name professionally for the rest of her life.\n\nAlthough Baker returned after traveling with gifts and money for her mother and younger half-sister, the turmoil of the relationship with her mother pushed her to make a trip to France.\n\nBaker's street-corner dancing attracted attention, leading to her being recruited for the St. Louis Chorus vaudeville show at the age of 15. She headed to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, performing at the Plantation Club and in the chorus of the groundbreaking and hugely successful Broadway revues Shuffle Along (1921) with Adelaide Hall and The Chocolate Dandies (1924). She performed as the last dancer in a chorus line.\n\nTraditionally the dancer in this position performed in a comic manner, as if she were unable to remember the dance, until the encore, at which point she would perform it not only correctly but with additional complexity. Baker was billed at the time as \"the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville\".\n\nBakerâs career began with her doing blackface comedy at local clubs; this was the \"entertainment\" that her mother did not approve of. Blackface performances landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris, which would become the place she called home until her final days.\n\nBaker sailed to Paris, for a new venture, and opened in La Revue NÃ¨gre on 2 October 1925, aged 19, at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. In Paris, she became an instant success for her erotic dancing, and for appearing practically nude onstage. After a successful tour of Europe, she broke her contract and returned to France to star at the Folies BergÃ¨re, setting the standard for her future acts.\n\nBaker performed the \"Danse sauvage\" wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Her success coincided (1925) with the Exposition des Arts DÃ©coratifs, which gave birth to the term \"Art Deco\", and also with a renewal of interest in non-Western forms of art, including African. Baker represented one aspect of this fashion. In later shows in Paris, she was often accompanied on stage by her pet cheetah, \"Chiquita\", who was adorned with a diamond collar. The cheetah frequently escaped into the orchestra pit, where it terrorized the musicians, adding another element of excitement to the show.\n\nAfter a short while, Baker was the most successful American entertainer working in France. Ernest Hemingway called her \"the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.\"\n\nIn addition to being a musical star, Baker also starred in three films which found success only in Europe: the silent film Siren of the Tropics (1927), Zouzou (1934) and Princesse Tam Tam (1935). She starred in Fausse Alerte in 1940.\n\nBaker dancing the Charleston, 1926\n\nAt this time she scored her most successful song, \"J'ai deux amours\" (1931). At the start of her career in France, Baker met a Sicilian former stonemason who passed himself off as a count, who persuaded her to let him manage her. Giuseppe Pepito Abatino was not only Bakerâs management, but her lover as well. The two could not marry due to Baker still being married to her second husband, Willie Baker.\n\nUnder the management of Abatino, Baker's stage and public persona, as well as her singing voice, were transformed. In 1934, she took the lead in a revival of Jacques Offenbach's opera La crÃ©ole, which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Marigny on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es of Paris. In preparation for her performances, she went through months of training with a vocal coach. In the words of Shirley Bassey, who has cited Baker as her primary influence, \"... she went from a 'petite danseuse sauvage' with a decent voice to 'la grande diva magnifique'... I swear in all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer.\"\n\nDespite her popularity in France, Baker never attained the equivalent reputation in America. Her star turn in a 1936 revival of Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway generated less than impressive box office numbers, and later in the run, she was replaced by Gypsy Rose Lee. Time magazine referred to her as a \"Negro wench...whose dancing and singing might be topped anywhere outside of Paris\", while other critics said her voice was \"too thin\" and \"dwarf-like\" to fill the Winter Garden Theatre. She returned to Europe heartbroken. This contributed to Baker's becoming a legal citizen of France and giving up her American citizenship.\n\nBaker returned to Paris in 1937, married a Jewish Frenchman, Jean Lion, and became a French citizen. They were married in the French town of CrÃ¨vecÅur-le-Grand, in a wedding presided over by the mayor, Jammy Schmidt.\n\nWork during World War II\n\nJosephine Baker in her famous banana costume\n\nIn September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, Baker was recruited by DeuxiÃ¨me Bureau, French military intelligence, as an \"honorable correspondent\". Baker collected what information she could about German troop locations from officials she met at parties. She specialized in gatherings at embassies and ministries, charming people as she had always done, while gathering information. Her cafÃ©-society fame enabled her to rub shoulders with those in the know, from high-ranking Japanese officials to Italian bureaucrats, and to report back what she heard. She attended parties at the Italian embassy without raising suspicions and gathered information.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded France, Baker left Paris and went to the ChÃ¢teau des Milandes, her home in the south of France. She housed friends who were eager to help the Free French effort led by Charles de Gaulle and supplied them with visas. As an entertainer, Baker had an excuse for moving around Europe, visiting neutral nations such as Portugal, as well as some in South America. She carried information for transmission to England, about airfields, harbors, and German troop concentrations in the West of France. Notes were written in invisible ink on Baker's sheet music.\n\nLater in 1941, she and her entourage went to the French colonies in North Africa. The stated reason was Baker's health (since she was recovering from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid a strip search). She befriended the Pasha of Marrakech, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a hysterectomy. The infection spread and she developed peritonitis and then septicemia. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French, and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her friends managed for the most part on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.\n\nIn Cairo, Egypt's King Farouk asked her to sing; she refused because Egypt had not recognized Free France and remained neutral. However, she offered to sing in Cairo at a celebration of honor for the ties between Free France and Egypt, and asked Farouk to preside, a subtle indication of which side his officially neutral country leaned toward.\n\nAfter the war, Baker received the Croix de guerre and the Rosette de la RÃ©sistance. She was made a Chevalier of the LÃ©gion d'honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.\n\nBaker's last marriage, to French composer and conductor Jo Bouillon, ended around the time Baker opted to adopt her 11th child. After the separation, Baker's chateau in France was foreclosed and she had to be physically removed from the property.\n\nLater career\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Bolstered by recognition of her wartime heroics, Baker the performer assumed a new gravitas, unafraid to take on serious music or subject matter. The engagement was a rousing success, and reestablished Baker as one of Paris' preeminent entertainers. In 1951 Baker was invited back to the United States for a nightclub engagement in Miami. After winning a public battle over desegregating the club's audience, Baker followed up her sold-out run at the club with a national tour. Rave reviews and enthusiastic audiences accompanied her everywhere, climaxed by a parade in front of 100,000 people in Harlem in honor of her new title: NAACP's \"Woman of the Year\".\n\nHer future looked bright, with six months of bookings and promises of many more to come.\n\nAn incident at the Stork Club interrupted and overturned her plans. Baker criticized the club's unwritten policy of discouraging black patrons, then scolded columnist Walter Winchell, an old ally, for not rising to her defense. Winchell responded swiftly with a series of harsh public rebukes, including accusations of Communist sympathies (a serious charge at the time). The ensuing publicity resulted in the termination of Baker's work visa, forcing her to cancel all her engagements and return to France. It was almost a decade before U.S. officials allowed her back into the country.\n\nIn January 1966, Fidel Castro invited Baker to perform at the Teatro Musical de La Habana in Havana, Cuba, at the 7th anniversary celebrations of his revolution. Her spectacular show in April broke attendance records. In 1968, Baker visited Yugoslavia and made appearances in Belgrade and in Skopje.\n\nIn her later career, Baker faced financial troubles. She commented, \"Nobody wants me, they've forgotten me\"; but family members encouraged her to continue performing. In 1973 she performed at Carnegie Hall to a standing ovation. The following year, she appeared in a Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium, and then at the Monacan Red Cross Gala, celebrating her 50 years in French show business. Advancing years and exhaustion began to take their toll; she sometimes had trouble remembering lyrics, and her speeches between songs tended to ramble. She still continued to captivate audiences of all ages.\n\nAlthough based in France, Baker supported the American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s. When she arrived in New York with her husband Jo, they were refused reservations at 36 hotels because she was black. She was so upset by this treatment that she wrote articles about the segregation in the United States. She also began traveling into the South. She gave a talk at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, on \"France, North Africa And The Equality Of The Races In France\".\n\nShe refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, although she was offered $10,000 by a Miami club. (The club eventually met her demands). Her insistence on mixed audiences helped to integrate live entertainment shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. After this incident, she began receiving threatening phone calls from people claiming to be from the Ku Klux Klan but said publicly that she was not afraid of them.\n\nIn 1951, Baker made charges of racism against Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club in Manhattan, where she alleged she had been refused service.\n\nActress Grace Kelly, who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party, vowing never to return (although she returned on 3 January 1956 with Prince Rainier of Monaco). The two women became close friends after the incident.\n\nWhen Baker was near bankruptcy, Kelly offered her a villa and financial assistance (Kelly by then was princess consort of Rainier III of Monaco). (However, during his work on the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Baker's sons. Having read a Blumenthal-written story about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and, using comparison of the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.)\n\nBaker worked with the NAACP. Her reputation as a crusader grew to such an extent that the NAACP had Sunday, May 20, 1951 declared \"Josephine Baker Day\". She was presented with life membership with the NAACP by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Ralph Bunche. The honor she was paid spurred her to further her crusading efforts with the \"Save Willie McGee\" rally after he was convicted of the 1948 beating death of a furniture shop owner in Trenton, New Jersey. As Baker became increasingly regarded as controversial, many blacks began to shun her, fearing that her reputation would hurt their cause.\n\nIn 1963, she spoke at the March on Washington at the side of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Baker was the only official female speaker. While wearing her Free French uniform emblazoned with her medal of the LÃ©gion d'honneur, she introduced the \"Negro Women for Civil Rights.\" Rosa Parks and Daisy Bates were among those she acknowledged, and both gave brief speeches.\n\nAfter King's assassination, his widow Coretta Scott King approached Baker in the Netherlands to ask if she would take her husband's place as leader of the American Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, Baker declined, saying her children were \"too young to lose their mother\"."
