        "text": "One related item crossing the ocean this week to be at the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair is Giovanni Boccaccio's De claris mulieribus, second edition, dating to the mid-15th century, which is the first collection of biographies devoted exclusively to women. They're also bringing one of (!) their rare Lovelace volumes, a first edition of the paper she wrote, annotated by her math tutor.\n\nThere's also a Pank-a-Squith gameboard, which is difficult to find with its suffragette game pieces, a rare hand-painted WSPU donation tin, and a Women's Freedom League sash, once owned by the suffragette Hodgson sisters.\n\nAs we approach International Women's Day on March 8, many booksellers are honoring the much overlooked work of women, including Alembic Rare Books and Deborah Coltham, who are issuing a joint catalogue of women in science. Bernard Quaritch also published a catalogue focused on \"Women.\" And it's worth noting that the next catalogue of women's work issued by book dealer Elizabeth Crawford will be her 200th.\n\nThe exhibition of work is on display at Peter Harrington through Friday, March 15 at its shop located at 43 Dover Street."
