        "text": "ACADEMY MUSEUM OF MOTION PICTURES ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF FILM PROGRAMMING TO ACCOMPANY LANDMARK EXHIBITION REGENERATION: BLACK CINEMA 1898–1971.\n\nScreenings include world premieres of films newly restored by the Academy Film Archive—including Reform School (1939), a film once thought lost.\n\nLos Angeles, Calif., JULY 14, 2022—The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures announced today details of its upcoming film programs including the first film series organized to accompany the landmark exhibition Regeneration: Black Cinema 1898–1971 on view August 21, 2022–April 9, 2023. These programs offer a survey of the films and filmmakers explored in Regeneration , an exhibition that expands our understanding of US film history by highlighting the work of African American filmmakers, including those who worked independently from the Hollywood studio system.\n\nThe first film series to accompany the exhibition—Regeneration: An Introduction—will kick off on August 25 with the world-premiere of a new restoration by the Academy Film Archive of the “lost” film Reform School starring Louise Beavers. This series runs until September 29 and will feature more than twenty screenings programmed by Bernardo Rondeau, Senior Director of Film Programs for the Academy Museum.\n\nCovering the same 70+ year span as the exhibition, from cinema’s infancy in the 1890s to the early 1970s, the film series ranges from showcasing silent era pioneers such as writer-producer-director Oscar Micheaux’s dramas to the groundbreaking allegories of Spencer Williams and the independently produced, genre-defying works of innovators such as Melvin Van Peebles. Audiences will also be introduced to stars largely unknown to mainstream moviegoers—Ralph Cooper, Clarence Brooks, and Francine Everett—alongside iconic screen legends Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, and more.\n\n“It’s been an amazing journey arriving to this first chapter of our film programming to complement the game-changing exhibition Regeneration: Black Cinema, 1898–1971, which offers a more expansive version of American film history,” said Rondeau. “The screening series will offer audiences the chance to discover the films highlighted in Regeneration, hopefully, deepening their experiences of the exhibition. It is incredible to be able to present films that have not been seen in decades, and I am thankful to our partners, especially the Academy Film Archive for their tremendous efforts in rediscovering and restoring a number of these films making them available like never before to new audiences.”\n\nIn addition to the inaugural film series Regeneration: An Introduction, the museum will launch additional film programming and screenings around Regeneration in late 2022 and early 2023 including world premieres of films newly restored by the Academy Film Archive—Harlem on the Prairie (1937) and Mr. Washington Goes to Town (1942); a centennial celebration of Dorothy Dandridge and Ruby Dee; screenings of silent films with live musical accompaniment; and a screening series by guest programmer Maya Cade to debut in February 2023.\n\nCade is the Creator and Curator of Black Film Archive and a Scholar in Residence at the Library of Congress. She has been awarded special distinctions by the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics for the Archive. Her work has been featured in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, NPR, The Paris Review, and Vulture, among other publications. She is the fall 2022 programmer in residence at Indiana University’s Cinema and was the fall 2021 research fellow at Indiana University’s Black Film Center & Archive. Originally hailing from New Orleans, Cade is based in Brooklyn."
