        "text": "She adopted 12 children, partly because she couldn't have any of her own and partly because she believed in equality for all, no matter what nationality, religion or race they were of. They were called \"the Rainbow Children\" and their names were: Akio (Korea), Luis (Colombia), Janot (Japan), Jari (Finland), Jean-Claude (Canada), Moïse (French), Marianne (France), Noël (France), Brian (Arab), Mara (Venezuela), Koffi (the Ivory-Coast), Stellina (Morocco).\n\nBuried with her husband Jo Bouillon in the Monaco cemetery and their grave is located right next to that of Jean Chevrier and Marie Bell.\n\nIn a \"Wayne's World\" skit on Saturday Night Live (1975), she was ranked #8 in Wayne's Top 10 Babes of All Time.\n\nIn 1951, the Stork Club in New York City refused to serve her because she was black. This led to a confrontation with columnist Walter Winchell. Later, during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" period in the early 1950s, she was falsely accused of being a Communist sympathizer, and the FBI started a file on her.\n\nGeorges Simenon, the Belgian author of the famous \"Inspector \"Maigret\" series of detective novels, had a short relationship with Josephine in 1925. However, he couldn't take the fact that she was more famous and in spotlight than he was, and that he had begun calling himself \"Mr. Josephine\", so he broke it off.\n\nThe Dutchman Henk van der Meyden composed and wrote a musical about her life called \"Josephine\", which had its premiere in 1991 at Luxor Theater, Rotterdam. Cheryl Howard played the role of Josephine. The musical contained five of her original, as well as new material.\n\nJanet Flanner, \"New Yorker\" correspondent said of her \"Her magnificent dark body, a new model to the French, proved for the first time that black was beautiful\".\n\nIn 1928, her husband/manager 'Count' Pepito di Abatino dueled Andrew Czolovodi, a Hungarian cavalry officer, over Josephine in St. Stephen's cemetery in Budapest. The duel lasted only 10 minutes, ending when di Abatino was scratched by Czolovodi's blade.\n\nIn 2003, another musical went on stage, in Belgium, called \"Simenon et Josephine\". It was a musical comedy related to the Maigret year of 2003 in Belgium.\n\nAccording to Jacqueline Stewart hosting for Turner Classic Movies, Josephine Baker was buried in France with a 21 gun salute. This made her the first American woman to be buried in France with military honors."
