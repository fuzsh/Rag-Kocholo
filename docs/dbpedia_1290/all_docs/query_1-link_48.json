        "text": "For over a century, Black women performers have challenged racism, sexism, and heteronormativity. However, the ephemeral traces of historical performances are always in danger of being erased or misinterpreted. In the 1920s and 1930s, Josephine Baker both shocked and delighted audiences at Parisian dance halls with her scandalous banana belt. For many critics, the belt symbolizes either her agency or her submission to primitivist caricature and racial/sexual objectification. Instead, through what I call female phallicism, I theorize the belt as a multiple dildo harness that intervened in complex ways in colonial racial and sexual discourses. The banana belt offers contemporary critics a multidimensional, dialog- ic space for dismantling racial and sexual hierarchies. Keywords: queer theory; transgender theory; Josephine Baker; African American performance; 1920s Paris; femme; dildo\n\nJosephine Baker‘s performance of the black female body on the Paris stage in the 1920’s and 1930’s is one example of the commodification of black sexuality. It had its precedent in the nineteenth century in Saartjie Baartman, known as the “Venus Hottentot”, who became a symbol of deviant sexuality. White men felt lured by the “exotic” and “the other”, and Josephine Baker would highlight her backside in her dance performance to arouse male desire, providing her audience with a spectacle of the primitive. As a result, the female body that had been the object of sexual exploitation in the times of slavery transformed itself in the means to entrap and sway the white coloniser’s erotic impulse. Thus, what this article aims to prove is the contribution of Josephine Baker to a new female black identity using a postcolonial and post-positivist approach to her performances on stage and her own life. She gave a new meaning to the black female body through agency and sexuality, transforming black women into speaking subjects.\n\nJosephine Baker and Anna May Wong are two exceptions to white hegemony in early show business. They became the first Afro-American and Chinese-American stars in the 1920s, and reached international stardom in spite of their ethnicity but also because of it. Their careers and success were based on their exoticization. Baker and Wong’s exoticism has much to do with ethnicity, but also with sex and gender. Their exotic dances on stage or on screen can be considered to be forms of erotic shows. This article shows how sex, gender and race are entangled in their movies and burlesque shows. It also discusses the ways in which the agency and the audience of the performer should be taken into account and analyzes how these performances were both rooted in Western imaginative geographies as well as connected to symbolic and material spaces.\n\nThis article reads two poems by the African American writer Elizabeth Alexander as examples of post-colonial feminist critique centered around the question of historical misrepresentation of the black female body. Her poems selected for this study refer to, or signify on, the discursive and representational practices of reducing non-white women to the role of (not necessarily sexual) objects, commonly employed by the predominantly white and male Western culture from the very first colonial encounters onwards. This process of “fetishization” can be viewed in relation to the much broader category of “otherization” of black females in a society guided by both phallo- and Eurocentric values, in which – while their physicality and sexuality is often overexposed – they become nearly invisible as human agents and subjects. The primary aim of this article is to analyze Alexander's poetic presentation of the processes of racialization/eroticization of two iconic “black female bodies” – Saartjie Baartman and Josephine Baker.\n\nCreating a sensation with her risque nightclub act and strolls down the Champs Elysees, pet cheetah in tow, Josephine Baker lives on in popular memory as the banana-skirted siren of Jazz Age Paris. In Josephine Baker and the Rainbow Tribe,&quot; Matthew Pratt Guterl brings out a little known side of the celebrated personality, showing how her ambitions of later years were even more daring and subversive than the youthful exploits that made her the first African American superstar.Her performing days numbered, Baker settled down in a sixteenth-century chateau she named Les Milandes, in the south of France. Then, in 1953, she did something completely unexpected and, in the context of racially sensitive times, outrageous. Adopting twelve children from around the globe, she transformed her estate into a theme park, complete with rides, hotels, a collective farm, and singing and dancing. The main attraction was her Rainbow Tribe, the family of the future, which showcased children of all skin colors, nations, and religions living together in harmony. Les Milandes attracted an adoring public eager to spend money on a utopian vision, and to worship at the feet of Josephine, mother of the world.Alerting readers to some of the contradictions at the heart of the Rainbow Tribe project--its undertow of child exploitation and megalomania in particular--Guterl concludes that Baker was a serious and determined activist who believed she could make a positive difference by creating a family out of the troublesome material of race.&quot;"
