Josephine Baker stars in a "Pygmalion"-like story of an uninhibited young Tunisian woman who poses as a serene Indian princess in Paris, where she is introduced to French society by a celebrated author. Baker's then-husband, Pepito Abatino, wrote the screenplay. The film was banned in the United States because of its mixed-race romance.
