        "text": "Danny Welbeck has suggested his performance against Ostersunds FK was hampered by concerns about playing on an artificial pitch.\n\nThe Englishman put in a disappointing display leading Arsenal’s attacking line and was mostly a spectator as the Gunners won 3-0 in Sweden.\n\nIt was a comfortable win for Arsenal, but Welbeck struggled to impose himself against the Swedish minnows and make correct decisions in key areas.\n\nWelbeck has recently recovered from another knee injury, and hinted he was worried about the pitch and even said he was sometimes frustrated with his team-mates’ energy.\n\n‘The pitch was hard, l knew coming here it would be difficult, with the players they’ve got they like to keep the ball, and we had to keep our cool, be patient,’ Welbeck told BT Sport after the victory.\n\n‘Maybe we could have played the ball forward a bit quicker, try to catch them out, but it was a professional start.\n\n‘It’s a 3G pitch. I made sure I did my rehab. You hear stories, but I felt fine, just looking to get more minutes under my belt after injuries.’\n\nNacho Monreal set Arsenal on their way to a victory in the Round of 42 Europa League tie before an own goal just before half-time put the Gunners in cruise control.\n\nMesut Ozil got Arsenal’s third in the 58th minute, before David Ospina protected his side’s clean sheet by saving a last-minute penalty.\n\nArsenal will welcome Ostersund to the Emirates next week with a formidable cushion to lean back on, but Henrikh Mkhitaryan has urged his team-mates to remain focused.\n\nMkhitaryan put in a star performance against Ostersund, but the playmaker insisted the return leg was still a vital fixture for his team.\n\nHe said: ‘We have to focus on every game regardless of this result to ensure more success.\n\n‘Even with the League Cup final, I think we have to play with the same team and win at home.’"
