        "text": "The World Para Ice Hockey Championships B-Pool will return to Ostersund, Sweden from 17-22 September, with six participating teams attempting to earn themselves a spot at the Paralympic Qualification Tournament for the Beijing 2022 Games.\n\nThe top three finishers from Ostersund will advance to the Winter Paralympics Qualification Tournament later this year where they will meet Norway, Italy and Slovakia. The top two finishers will also be promoted to the A-Pool for the 2022-23 season.\n\nHost nation Sweden, which has three B-Pool silver medals to its name, will be the top seed in the tournament, and Vancouver 2010 Paralympic silver medallists Japan will be the second seed. They will be followed by No. 3 China, which finished runner-up at the last World Championships B-Pool, and No. 4 Germany, the 2013 B-Pool winners. No. 5 Poland and No. 6 Finland will round out the participants.\n\n“Ostersund has become a city truly dedicated to hosting and promoting Para ice hockey and winter sport events over the years, and we are excited to be returning there once again,” said World Para Ice Hockey Manager Michelle Laflamme. “Following a successful World Championships A-Pool in Ostrava, we are excited to pass the torch to Ostersund now, where six additional teams will have the opportunity to move one step closer to securing a spot at the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games.”\n\nThe round-robin style tournament will take place at Ostersund Arena, which holds up to 2,700 spectators. With a population of about 60,000, Ostersund is known to be a winter sports hub, and hosted the World Para Ice Hockey World Championships B-Pool in 2015 and the European Championships in 2016. It has also hosted the 2019 IBU Biathlon World Championships, and other major international winter events, including cross-country skiing World Cups and World Junior Curling Championships.\n\n“I am incredibly looking forward to Ostersund hosting these World Para Ice Hockey Championships,” said Beatrice Olsson, chair of the Local Organising Committee (LOC). “The LOC, together with the volunteers and the whole town, will do our very best to make the teams feel welcome and able to perform at their best. There will be exciting competition days where a lot is at stake.”\n\nThe schedule for the event will consist of the following matchups (kick-off times are shown on Central European Time, CET):\n\n17 September\n\n10:00 — Poland vs. China\n\n13:30 — Germany vs. Japan\n\n17:00 — Finland vs. Sweden\n\n18 September\n\n10:00 — Japan vs. Poland\n\n13:30 — China vs. Finland\n\n17:00 — Sweden vs. Germany\n\n19 September\n\n10:00 — Japan vs. China\n\n13:30 — Finland vs. Germany\n\n17:00 — Sweden vs. Poland\n\n21 September\n\n10:00 — Germany vs. Poland\n\n13:30 — Japan vs. Finland\n\n17:00 — China vs. Sweden\n\n22 September\n\n10:00 — Poland vs. Finland\n\n13:30 — China vs. Germany\n\n17:00 — Sweden vs. Japan\n\nThis will be the eighth edition of the World Para Ice Hockey Championships B-Pool. The last World Championships B-Pool took place in 2019 in Berlin, Germany, where the RPC won gold, Slovakia took silver and China claimed bronze."
