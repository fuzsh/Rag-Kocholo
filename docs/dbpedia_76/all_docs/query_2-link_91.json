        "text": "July 28, 2017\n\nTarah Hobbs, a goaltender for the University of Minnesota from 2013-2016, has been signed by Ostersunds DFF, a professional women's soccer team in the Elitettan league in Sweden.\n\nThe former Minnesota stand out joins the team after a one-day training session in Sweden. She will be able to play as soon as the next game. Hobbs will join former Gopher Haley Helverson, who has been a member of the team for one year. She has played in six matches for Ostersunds DFF this year.\n\nHobbs left Minnesota as one of best goalies in Gopher history. She holds the record for most shutouts in a career with 33, six more than any other Gopher. She is second in goals against average at 0.90 and second in career minutes at 7,406:42. She was the first Minnesota player to receive the Big Ten Goalkeeper of the Year award, which she did as a freshman, and was named All-Big Ten twice in her career. Coach Stefanie Golan says she believes Hobbs will be successful in Sweden.\n\n\"Tarah has worked extremely hard to get where she is at today,\" said Golan. \"She prepared and committed herself to become a better player and we have no doubt that she is going to kill it in Sweden.\"\n\nHobbs will play in the Elitettan league, which is the second highest division of Swedish women's football. Contested by 14 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Damallsvenskan.\n\nSeasons run from April to October, with teams playing 26 matches each in the season. The league started in 2013, with Ostersunds DFF becoming a part of the league in 2015 after finishing first in the first division in 2014. Hobbs says she is excited to get started.\n\n\"I am super excited to continue my soccer career after Minnesota. I feel like Ostersunds is a good place to start my professional career, and can't wait to see what opportunities I will have here. I feel Minnesota, my coaches, teammates and support staff fully prepared me to pursue this dream, and I would not be here without them,\" said Hobbs. \"During out two-week break in this season, I have been training with the men's team here. I am looking forward to experiencing the world, culture, people and pursing a lifelong dream of playing soccer at the highest level.\"\n\nOstersunds DFF plays at JÃ¤mtkraft Arena in Ã-stersund, Sweden. Its current capacity is 8,466 and it has been open since July 13, 2007.\n\nAt the last report, Ostersunds DFF held a record of 3-10-1 overall. The next game for Ostersunds DFF is set for August 12 against HovÃ¥s Billdal IF at 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. CST)."
