        "text": "Aug. 8, 2017\n\nThe third Minnesota soccer player in the past two weeks has joined a professional team across the Atlantic Ocean. Josee Stiever, a midfielder who played from 2013-2016, has joined Ostersund DFF, a professional team in Sweden.\n\nThe Cedarburg, Wis. native joins Ostersund DFF after playing with GSI Pride, a team in the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL). Stiever joins Tarah Hobbs who joined the team just a few short weeks ago and former Gopher Haley Helverson, who has been a member of the team for one year. She has played in six matches for Ostersund DFF this year.\n\nStiever made an impact with the Gophers from the moment she stepped onto campus. She played in 86 games, netted 21 goals, recorded 20 assists and 62 points. Her 20 assists put her tied for the eighth most in program-history. She also came up big in the clutch, netting nine game-winning goals in her four years with Minnesota, good enough for ninth most in program-history.\n\nHead Coach Stefanie Golan says Stiever will be a valuable player in the professional ranks.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Josee will be able to have a long professional soccer career. She is one of the hardest working individuals I have had the pleasure to coach,\" said Golan. \"She has a tremendous character, and will be an asset to any team who wants to give her an opportunity.\"\n\nStiever will play in the Elitettan league, which is the second highest division of Swedish women's football. Contested by 14 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Damallsvenskan.\n\nSeasons run from April to October, with teams playing 26 matches each in the season. The league started in 2013, with Ostersund DFF becoming a part of the league in 2015 after finishing first in the first division in 2014. Stiever says...\n\n\"I want to thank God for opening doors for me, and my parents for encouraging me to walk through them. Also, thank you to my Gopher soccer family for always supporting me and to FC Kansas City for the opportunities they have given me,\" Stiever said. \"I have a few friends, including Tarah, with Ostersund DFF right now who have said great things about the club so when the opportunity came up, it was an easy decision to say yes. I'm so grateful to be living out my dreams every day and I can't wait to see where this sport takes me!\"\n\nOstersund DFF plays at JÃ¤mtkraft Arena in Ã-stersund, Sweden. Its current capacity is 8,466 and it has been open since July 13, 2007.\n\nAt the last report, Ostersund DFF held a record of 3-10-1 overall. The next game for Ostersund DFF is set for August 12 against HovÃ¥s Billdal IF at 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. CST)."
