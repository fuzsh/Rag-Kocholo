        "text": "When the draw was made for the Europa League back in December and Arsenal were paired with Ostersund there weren't many people connected to the Emirates who knew too much about the Swedish minnows.\n\nStories quickly began to emerge, however, of the remarkable journey that the team from a team in the far north of the country had been on which had allowed them rub shoulders with illustrious company such as Arsene Wenger’s star-studded squad.\n\nIronically enough that journey had been led by an Englishman, the forward thinking Graham Potter, who had arrived in 2011 and helped transform a small town club into a side who had earned the right to go toe to toe with some of Europe’s best.\n\nBut Potter was not the first Englishman to make his mark with Ostersund, far from it. Way before the former Stoke City and Southampton player had arrived on the scene there was another man from these shores who had upped sticks and opted to brave the near arctic conditions in the name of football.\n\nAnd for that man, Thursday night’s meeting between Ostersund and Arsenal will be an occasion that he could never have imagined when he first set foot on Swedish soil in 1999.\n\nPaul Read remains the only player to play for play for both clubs. The former Arsenal traine progressed through the youth ranks at Highbury during the George Graham years and was a regular for the reserves during the mid-90s, but was never able to force his way through to the senior side.\n\nHe left in 1997 and moved to Wycombe Wanders where he spent two years before his contract ended and he became a free agent. It was then that he received a call that saw him take a very different path to the one usually followed by most English players.\n\n“It was quite random really,” Read told Football.London. “I was in Cyprus on holiday and got a call from my mum and dad back home saying that a guy from Sweden had been in contact.\n\n“So I went over to Ostersund for five months to start with. They’d only been formed for a couple of years so I knew almost nothing about them, I tried to find out a bit about them but there wasn’t much history.\n\n“And it was an unbelievable experience. I had such an amazing time. The place is beautiful. It was like a fresh start for me.\n\n“I went over there and we managed to win the title. When I got there we were second and we managed to win pretty much every game we played, I think I scored 17 or 18 goals in 15 games and we won the title, their first ever title in the northern league.\n\n“Then we went to play in what was like a grand final against the team that wins the southern league. That would have got us promoted, but we got beat over the two legs.\n\n“I got invited back for another season but suffered from a bucket load of injuries and never really got off the ground.”\n\nRead returned to England in 2000 to join Exeter City but the year he spent playing in Scandinavia was one that he remembers as one of the most enjoyable of his career.\n\n“It was such an amazing experience,” he said. “It was a different type of football, the place is so nice. The people are great. If I could have stayed I would have, I really enjoyed the football.\n\n“Because they were quite new into it I had a lot of feedback into what they were doing training wise so I got involved in that side of things with them as well.\n\n“It was one of the most enjoyable periods of football I had because I think it was so new and fresh to me. And being the marquee player everything was based around me.\n\n“That was nice, being the main player scoring goals and making the difference. And seeing the progression they were making.\n\n“I left one of the biggest clubs in the country in Arsenal, then had a so, so time at Wycombe because of injuries. So to go there was a fresh start and getting into a new culture gave me something to really aim for.”\n\nRead added: “I used to go in every day and sit with the manager and chairman and they would ask what they had to do each day to compare to the teams in England and I would talk about diets and things like that.\n\n“I was at Arsenal for six months with Arsene Wenger and even then I could see the difference with the diets that were coming in at the time.\n\n“So they were feeding off me for my professional knowledge. You could they were a forward thinking club, but I would never have thought it would end like this.\n\n“When the draw came out and I told my little boy, it was great. We’re lucky enough that I get some tickets for one of the boxes at the Emirates from time to time and he was so excited.\n\n“We went to my mum and dad’s house and he went through the memorabilia and he saw the pictures and he couldn’t believe it. I told him Ostersunds were like a part time team when I played for them and now they are going to the Emirates, which is bigger then their whole town, it’s crazy. It’s a magnificent story for them.”\n\nWhen Read left Sweden in 2000, Ostersund were still plying their trade in the lower reaches of Swedish football - despite the title win his goals inspired in 1999.\n\nBut there rapid rise through the leagues to the Allsvenskan started in 2011 when Potter was appointed manager, culminating in last season’s fifth placed finish.\n\nThey have shown during their journey to the top they they have what it takes to cause anyone problems and have a history of being able to upset the more established sides.\n\nEven in the Europa League this season they have seen off the likes of Galatasaray and Hertha Berlin from the Bundesliga - and Read has warned Arsenal that they will pay the price if they go into Thursday night’s game thinking it will be a walk in the park.\n\n“It will be a stern test for the boys,” he said. “It will just be a massive culture shock. I went back one winter for the end of season awards and it was absolutely freezing, I’ve never faced anything like it. It was that cold, it was ridiculous.\n\n\"They’ve made such great strides in such a short space of time. To get where they are now is a hell of an achievement.\n\n\"I would never have imagined this would have happened. We were doing well when I was there and I know they were keen on getting professional players over there to give themselves an edge. But to have made the stride they have is unbelievable.\n\n“I would never have thought they would end up playing the mighty Arsenal, I would never have seen it coming. The progression they have made has been phenomenal and it will be a close game. Our lads will be in for a culture shock when they get there and I think our fans will as well.\n\n“It’s a nice stadium, but it’s like a League 2 stadium. It’s very open, it gets very windy and very, very cold. So I think the lads will have to be on the ball or they might end up tripping over a banana skin.”\n\nRead added: “To think that Arsene Wenger and the players are going to be walking into that ground is remarkable. For the Ostersund players it must be like Christmas at the moment.\n\n“And I think Wenger will put a strong team out because we need to win it don’t we. It’s all we’ve got to aim for now, it gives us a Champions League spot.\n\n“He needs to go guns ho and get that Champions League spot because I don’t think we’re going to get fourth place that’s for sure.”"
