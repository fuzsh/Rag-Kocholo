        "text": "“It’s always a difficult decision but I think they are clear about that.\n\n“Since the start of the season, it’s clear. He played in the whole competition. I have two world-class goalkeepers and I decided from the start on to have clarity in the games they play. I maintain that.”\n\n\"Danny Welbeck's had a lot of serious injuries and he's never really got any rhythm going in his game.\n\n\"Tonight is a good opportunity for Danny. He needs some goals and if he can get himself into the right areas and be as composed as he needs to be to putt he ball in the back of the net.\n\n\"It's good to see him back for Arsenal and for England. That's still there for Danny Welbeck in the summer. If he can get himself in form he's got a real chance [of making the World Cup squad].\""
