        "text": "Arsenal were hugely disappointing as they limped into the last 16 of the Europa League despite losing to Swedish minnows Ostersund.\n\nThe Gunners led 3-0 from last week's first leg but were well below-par as they fell 2-0 down before the break.\n\nSead Kolasinac ended the visitors' hopes of a incredible comeback but Arsenal struggled throughout.\n\nFor some players it was a chance to impress ahead of the Carabao Cup final but the fringe players blew it.\n\nHere are Darren Lewis' player ratings.\n\nArsenal\n\nOspina 6 - No chance with the goals. Exposed by his poor defence.\n\nBellerin 6 - Good cross from him for the goal to be fair.\n\nChambers 4 - Unlucky for the first goal but poor for the second.\n\nHolding 4 - No real understanding with Chambers and Ostersunds cashed in.\n\nKolasinac 7 - Fine finish,minutes into the second half, as Arsenal improved.\n\nElneny 5 - Good second half strike to force a fine save out of Aly Keita.\n\nMaitland-Niles 4 - Never at the races. Replaced at half time.\n\nMkhitaryan 5 - Even his classy abilities could not make an impact first half\n\nWilshere 6 - One of the few to emerge with any credit from this shambles.\n\nIwobi 5 - Not enough of an impact considering his ability.\n\nWelbeck 5 - Tried - and failed - to chip the keeper with much better options available.\n\nSubs\n\nXhaka 6 (for Maitland Niles 45)\n\nWillock 5 (for Wilshere 75)"
