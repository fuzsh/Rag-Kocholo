        "text": "\"Wollentz’s study is very impressive in its intellectual breadth and depth, combining acute insights in the theory of heritage and memory with detailed empirical observations derived from heritage ethnographies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Sweden.\"\n\n-- Prof. Cornelius Holtorf, UNESCO Chair on Heritage Futures, Linnaeus University, Sweden\n\n​“Gustav Wollentz’s book is a refreshing read that enters into the intense debate on difficult heritage and invites us to rethink some of the analytical tools we use for the study of spaces marked by violent events, starting from the very notion of ‘temporality’. The book’s analyses of Mostar, Gazimestan, and Sandby Borg are not mere applications of the concepts discussed in the theoretical chapters, but are a remarkable way of “doing theory” empirically, moving from the specific features of each case study.” --Francesco Mazzucchelli, University of Bologna, Italy\n\nGustav Wollentz defended his PhD in the summer of 2018 at the Graduate School of Human Development in Landscapes, Kiel University, Germany. He received his Bachelor’s and his Master’s degrees in Archaeology from Linnaeus University in Sweden. In 2018 and in 2019, he was hired within the AHRC-funded Heritage Futures research programme to co-author a chapter on “toxic heritage.” He is currently working as a project leader / researcher at the Nordic Centre of Heritage Learning and Creativity, in Östersund, Sweden.\n\nBuy print copy\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 114.39\n\nPrice includes VAT (Italy)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 114.39\n\nPrice includes VAT (Italy)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nMyCopy Softcover EUR 39.99\n\nPrice for Italy\n\nDigitally printed black-and-white edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout"
