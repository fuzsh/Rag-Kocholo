        "text": "Brighton track potential head coaches and managers in the same way that they do players. They pay attention not just to results but to performance in relation to factors such as budget, resources and facilities.\n\nA 3-1 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday will not have deterred the club from the belief that Graham Potter is the right man for the job. He had been on their radar for several years because of the way he over-achieved at Ostersund, the Swedish side he steered to three promotions and the knockout stages of the Europa League.\n\nWhen tracking potential new managers, the club focuses either on a shortlist of candidates or one they are particularly keen on. In this instance it was Potter. The powers that be felt he would be attracted by the job after a season in the Championship with Swansea, where he was constrained by financial difficulties following the Welsh club’s relegation from the Premier League.\n\nHe would also deliver the style of football they were looking for. Brighton had become a turgid watch during the fight for Premier League safety last season in the final six months of Chris Hughton’s tenure. Owner-chairman Tony Bloom, a lifelong supporter himself, wanted fans to feel excited again.\n\nCharacter was a consideration as well to fit the club’s DNA. Hughton and his two predecessors — Sami Hyypia and Oscar Garcia — were humble, well-mannered, non-controversial. That is the look Bloom wants for Brighton. Potter is in the same mould.\n\nPotter has used and transformed players who were not in Hughton’s plans. Steven Alzate was nowhere near the first team last season, when he was loaned out to Swindon before suffering an injury.\n\nPotter took a liking to his poise in possession from day one of pre-season. The 21-year-old has featured in more than half of Brighton’s Premier League games and has earned a call-up to the Colombia squad.\n\nAaron Connolly, 19, had 15 minutes of League Cup action under Hughton. He has been involved in 11 of Brighton’s 14 matches in all competitions since Potter took charge, showcasing his pace running in behind defenders, devilish streak and eye for goal. He has been promoted from the under-21s to the Republic of Ireland senior squad.\n\nDefender Dan Burn, loaned straight back to Wigan to recover from injury and play games in the Championship after he signed in August 2018, made three FA Cup appearances for Hughton once he returned to the Amex in January. He is comfortable with the ball at his feet, even though he is 6ft 7ins, and has played all 1080 Premier League minutes for Potter.\n\nA source says: “From day one it was a clean slate for everyone. It doesn’t matter your experience or age, you’ve all got a chance. Managers usually do this and then after two or three weeks revert to the tried and trusted.\n\n“He’s played kids and they have come off for him. As much as we all liked and respected Chris, there is no way Connolly and Alzate would have been playing.”\n\nYou knew what you were going to get with Hughton’s Brighton: 4-4-1-1 in the first Premier League season, 4-3-3 in the second season, players in customary positions.\n\nPotter keeps opponents guessing with multiple changes of formation and role alterations for individual players within those systems. Brighton have played in a 4-2-3-1, 3-4-3, 5-3-2 and 4-2-2-2. Burn has been a left-back and a left wing-back, as well as one of three central defenders.\n\nPascal Gross and Neal Maupay have operated on the right, left and centrally in attacking areas. An insider tells The Athletic: “He is almost blind to a player’s position. Take Alzate – against Norwich he started at left wing-back and finished at right wing. He’s played central midfield, right-back and as a No 10. Graham sees players slightly differently, what they can do in different parts of the field. He doesn’t look through one lens, he looks through multiple lenses.\n\nThe time and length of training sessions has not changed but the content has. The emphasis is now far more about what Brighton do in possession than out of possession.\n\n“You could see it from the first session,” a player tells The Athletic. “The running was with the ball. With Chris we knew exactly what we were going to do defensively.”\n\nSessions are recorded and Potter uses video analysis to show the players aspects that went well or what went wrong and why. It is always done constructively, to encourage, not as a vehicle to criticise.\n\nThe analysis is sometimes done the same day, sometimes the following day, with individuals or collectively. One-to-one analysis is not always with Potter. Assistant Billy Reid and coach Bjorn Hamberg are regularly involved as well.\n\nHamberg says: “I work a lot with clips. The player can speak, we’ll have a discussion around it. How we work is, if they get a chance to influence their own game, they can take more control, more responsibility. When things are tough they feel they can challenge themselves as well. That, for me is key, that communication with the players.”\n\nPotter, 44, insisted on bringing his entire backroom team with him from Ostersund and Swansea: Reid, Hamberg and player recruiter Kyle Macaulay. They are a varied bunch in terms of age and experience, with a good chemistry.\n\nFormer Hamilton Academical manager Reid is the father figure. A source says of the 56-year-old Glaswegian: “Billy is a go-to for the players. He is the shoulder to cry on, but he is also an enforcer. If Billy needs to be firm, he will be firm.”\n\nHamberg, 34, has been with Potter the longest, since he began his eight-year reign at Ostersund. The former midfielder, coach and manager of Swedish sides BK Bjorner and Froso, says: “Probably he earned the most respect from me by calling every player by their name straight away. We had twins in the team and he even got them right!\n\n“It’s small things, but you see the same things now. It wasn’t a show, it’s just him, genuine and well prepared every day. That caught my eye straight away. Attention to detail and he cares about the human being, understanding problems, background.”\n\nReid’s fellow Scot Macaulay knows the type of player Potter wants to fit into his system. The 33-year-old former Derby County and Aberdeen midfielder has worked closely with Paul Winstanley, head of recruitment for the past five years.\n\nBrighton made Bristol City’s Adam Webster, well-known to Potter from his season in the Championship, their record £20 million buy in the summer. A source says: “We’d identified Webster some time ago, but he really wanted him.”\n\nAdding Webster, a ball-carrying central defender, suited Potter’s playing philosophy and provided the scope to play with three centre-halves instead of just two. The decisions to let Florin Andone and Jurgen Locadia leave on loan to Galatasaray and Hoffenheim respectively, once the season had started, were driven by Potter.\n\nInsiders were concerned it would leave the squad short of firepower, but he was one step ahead, already plotting the emergence of Connolly. Although his title is head coach, he will be heavily involved via Macaulay in any further signings during the January transfer window.\n\nIt seems to be working. While Brighton are 11th in the Premier League, they are in sixth in terms of their expected goals on 17.5. For context, that is above the free-scoring Leicester, who have netted 29 times this season (but have an xG of just 15.66).\n\nAlthough Potter and his backroom team came as a package, he also wanted a dressing room link to the Hughton era. Apart from the final six months, Hughton’s reign had been a huge success, taking the club from the bottom end of the Championship to the Premier League and staying there for two seasons.\n\n“The one thing he was a little bit concerned about was not having a direct connection with the previous team other than Ben Roberts, the goalkeeping coach, who he wanted to keep,” a source reveals of Potter.\n\nThis is where former captain Bruno comes in. Brighton have numerous ex-players working for them in the academy, Albion In The Community — the club’s charitable arm — and as matchday hosts at the Amex.\n\nThey had been discussing with Bruno the possibility of a post-playing role long before his retirement at the end of last season. Potter met the Spaniard and they hit it off immediately.\n\nBruno is now part of Potter’s backroom staff, another pair of ears and eyes. He usually watches matches from the stands, rather than the touchline, and remains a big influence within the dressing room as the core group of Hughton’s squad gradually diminishes.\n\nAn insider tells The Athletic: “I think it’s massive to keep Bruno there, close to the players and close to the manager. That contact. You need to keep some things. Especially with the respect everyone at the club has for him.”\n\nPotter spoke a lot about setting a positive environment in which players can thrive prior to his appointment in meetings lasting several hours with chief executive Paul Barber, technical director Dan Ashworth and finally with Bloom, Barber and Ashworth.\n\nIn the technical area, he regularly applauds demonstrably, with his hands above his head, even when a move breaks down or a pass goes astray, as long as the intention is right. He never criticises individual players in post-match press conferences.\n\nA source says: “He is a great believer in creating an environment where players can express themselves, where they will have belief in their own abilities and thrive. If the first team is doing well, everyone is doing well. There is a united front, which Graham loved. He loved the fact that the car park attendants would get a bonus if we stayed in the Premier League and finished higher than the previous season. That is re-enforcing the environment he wants to create around the players and the team.”\n\nPotter works closely with the medical department in determining the training needs of individual players on a daily basis. He places a lot of faith in science and the need for rest and recovery. That sometimes means a lighter workload.\n\nPotter’s bespoke approach and placid demeanour is deceiving. He is not a soft touch. Parameters were set during pre-season. He puts the onus on the players to be responsible for their actions.\n\nHe comes down hard if the trust is abused and the players are not in peak condition to perform when they are at work. As one source put it: “He’s not a Rottweiler, but he’s not a poodle either.\n\n“He is not someone who will say ‘You can’t go out and have dinner with your partner or friends,’ but if you do go out, don’t forget you are representing the club, you’ve got a game coming up, you’ve got training tomorrow. That’s all part of being grown-up.”\n\n(Photo: Martin Rickett/PA Images via Getty Images)"
