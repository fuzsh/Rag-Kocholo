Therefore, sports diplomacy and soft power have become an alternative avenue for Taiwan to strengthen its global profile. ⚾ Because of its unique situation caused by China’s ‘One China principle,’ Taiwan has participated in the Olympic Games and other international sports competitions under the name of ‘Chinese Taipei’ since 1981. 🥅 This issue is not only related to Taiwan’s international space but also linked to Taiwanese identity. The upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics offers a global stage for countries to advertise themselves through sports. 💡 What is the future of Taiwan’s sports diplomacy and what do international sporting events mean for Taiwanese identity? Join us at ISDP’s Stockholm Taiwan Center for a discussion about Taiwan’s sports diplomacy, international participation, and Taiwanese identity. Register here: https://lnkd.in/dEMjSS8B We are happy to welcome our speakers: Po Chun Liu, Taiwan Sport Forward Association, and Tao-Tien (Ömür) Hsiung, National Chengchi University, National Taiwan Normal University. Moderator: Yi-Chieh Chen, Junior Research Fellow, Stockholm Taiwan Center.\n\nDo you like MUN but are afraid of speaking up?

In this article, I examined the emergence of sport as a tool of the European Union’s (EU) soft power, studying the benefits of an EU sport diplomacy strategy and the form it should take. Public diplomacy is gaining momentum and is increasingly used by state and non-state actors as means to influence the behaviour of others. This paper argues that for the EU to gain a comparative advantage over other state and non-state actors, it should adopt a hybrid sport diplomacy strategy that is based on soft and smart power and reflects its norms, values, and unique structure. Key actions it should consider are collaborating with international (sport) organisations and developing grassroots projects. If you are interested by this article or would like to use it as part of your own research project, you can find it here using this link 😊 (also available on my profile) : https://lnkd.in/eGR6MmuY\n\nThe increased awareness of Sports Diplomacy reflects an innovation in diplomatic practice that Australia can genuinely (and distinctively) lead, strengthening people to people and institutional links for positive impact within our region, and globally. It's excellent to see this recognised in DFAT’s latest media release through the formation of the Sports Diplomacy Consultative Group and the updating of the Sports Diplomacy 2030 Strategy. I’m truly pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to and chair the Ministerial Advisory Council over recent years following on from the wonderful leadership of Josephine Sukkar AM. Throughout the term, we saw an increased recognition of sports diplomacy as a key soft power asset including: the development of the Sports Diplomacy MOOC in partnership with La Trobe University; enhanced global sport for development dialogue through the Dubai World Expo Sports Diplomacy Roundtable; stronger collaboration with Universities for regional engagement through sport; more Australians in positions of influence; more regional teams engaged in competitions; as well as support of Team Up activities, the ONOC Step Up Oceania conference and DFAT’s Gender Symposium during the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023. I acknowledge and celebrate the efforts that members of the Ministerial Council have all made and continue to make, in advancing the spirit and practice of sports diplomacy in their respective sectors and communities. The next decade is critical for ensuring Australia’s sports diplomacy delivers real impact for Australia and our regional partners on the global stage and as the next iteration of the Consultative Group takes shape, I look forward to contributing to the Roundtable discussion to maximise the outcomes of Australia’s Sports Diplomacy efforts.

As the conference coordinator, I am deeply privileged to be part of this exceptional group of representatives from our university. Each member of our team brought a unique perspective and unwavering dedication to the table. Together, we are poised to engage in diplomatic dialogue, address global challenges, and forge connections with delegates from around the world as we witnessed the ambitious delegates form all around the world joining in to bring up discussions on the issue of ‘Protecting the Rights of Refugees Children in Developed Countries’. Beyond the immediate honor of representing our university, this conference holds significant potential for impactful outcomes. Moreover, our presences at the conference sent a powerful message about our university's commitment to fostering dialogue, cooperation, and understanding on a global scale. With the active engagement in global issues discussion, we as teenagers are hoping to drive revolutions of the world which will be soon handled by the youngsters by reminding, inspiring and encouraging all of you to actively engage with the reality where possibilities scatter abundantly. With the Best Diplomats Conference as a stepping stone, I am hoping to receive more valuable opportunities to engage in business discussions in regards of Environment, Social and Governance which are crucial to sustainability. #sustainability #leadership #globalconnections\n\nDo you like International Model United Nations Association (IMUNA) but are afraid of speaking up ?

From analyzing diplomatic negotiations to exploring the impact of global trends on foreign policy, I find immense fulfillment in delving into complex issues and fostering nuanced understanding. Additionally, as a sports enthusiast with a keen interest in football, I enjoy engaging in conversations about the latest matches, player performances, and the broader socio-cultural significance of sports on a global scale. Whether it's dissecting geopolitical tensions or debating team tactics, I relish the opportunity to explore diverse topics that bridge the realms of international relations and sports."
