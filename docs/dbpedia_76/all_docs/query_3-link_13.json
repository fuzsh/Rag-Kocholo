        "text": "The aim of the department for Work and Career at Mid Sweden University is to introduce students to the labour market already during their studies. This is a great possibility for students to connect with possible future employers in Sweden.\n\nWhile studying one of Mid Sweden University´s international programmes, you can also work on your career. We offer placements, free guest lecturers from the commercial and industrial sectors, and also excellent possibilities to work on your degree projects in cooperation with a local company in your field. Find out more at the Karriärtorget billboard on campus or online.\n\nMid Sweden University does not provide student accommodation. However, we cooperate closely with student housing companies in each campus city and recommends different housing companies in Sundsvall and Östersund. The choice of housing varies from campus to campus, but all types of student accommodation in Sweden are generally of a high standard.\n\nThe housing companies offer a wide range of accommodation such as:\n\nstudent residence hall (dormitory rooms)\n\nstudent residence hall (student flats with single or double rooms)\n\nsingle apartments\n\nshared apartments\n\ncottage apartments\n\nEssentially, most exercise and fitness activities are considered tax-free employee welfare benefits if they are of a simple nature and of a low cost value. In order for a benefit that consists of only a single treatment or activity to be considered simple in nature and of low value, the cost may not exceed 1,000 SEK per occasion or activity.\n\nAt Mid Sweden University there are student unions looking after your interests concerning your education and questions related to the social aspects of student life.\n\nThe student union endeavours to see to it that you get as good an education as possible, and that your days of study are as good as they can be. This organisation is an organisation of students for students."
