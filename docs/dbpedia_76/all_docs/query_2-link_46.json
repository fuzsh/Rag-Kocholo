        "text": "Arsenal made short work of Swedish side Ostersund to have one foot in the Europa League's last 16.\n\nAnd it was a man who hasn't appeared in the competition for EIGHT years who did the damage in snowy Scaninavia.\n\nMesut Ozil was with Werder Bremen when he last played on a Thursday night, but he helped make short work of Graham Potter's men.\n\nNacho Monreal and an own goal made it comfortable, before the German got in on the act with the third.\n\nWith a penalty save to boot, here's how they rated...\n\nOspina 8\n\nA freezing spectator before Ghoddos warmed him up - plus a penalty stop\n\nBellerin 7\n\nBailed out by Ospina after giving away late penalty with poor challenge\n\nChambers 7\n\nAllowed Ghoddos two sights of goal but made key blocks too\n\nMustafi 7\n\nInvolved in penalty scare but otherwise strolled through the game\n\nMonreal 8 (Kolasinac 73)\n\nIn the right place at the right time again with third goal in six games\n\nElneny 7\n\nWon't be the toughest game he has trying to shield defence\n\nMaitland-Niles 7\n\nIn his preferred central midfield position and kept things safe and simple\n\nIwobi 6\n\nShot led to opener. With better passing could have been more productive\n\nOzil 8\n\nMOTM. Not at full tilt and didn't need to be to dictate game and score\n\nMkhitaryan 7 (Nelson 84)\n\nUnlucky not to open his Arsenal account but did set up two more goals\n\nWelbeck 5 (Nketiah 83)\n\nHanded very rare chance up front and failed to take it. Frustrating.\n\nSubs not used: Xhaka, Macey, Willock, Holding\n\nOstersund\n\nKeita 5; Mukiibi 6, Papagiannopoulos 4, Petterson 6, Widgren 5 (Widgren 73); Edwards 6, Nouri 6 (Hopcutt 46, 6), Mensah 6; Sema 7, Ghoddos 7, Gero 6 (Tekie 46, 6). Unused: Andersson, Aiesh, Sonko Sundberg, Islamovic."
