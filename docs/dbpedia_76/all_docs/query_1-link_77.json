        "text": "If you want your opinions to he heard, you like taking initiative and a little snow doesn’t scare you off, then the go-to country for your studies must be Sweden.\n\nLong-time ago a country of barbaric Vikings, nowadays Sweden, has polished its manners, and nothing proves it more than the fact that the Swedish higher education system ranks second in the world. Did we mention cutting-edge research and real-world challenges in multicultural academic communities? If you're looking to study at a university in Sweden, you will find a range of education programmes, innovative approaches, and international outlook.\n\nTo get a better picture about what’s like studying in Sweden, you need to know that the education here is more about self-development through student groups and independent studies, than about listening to the typical teacher lecture. Let’s try and see the details behind this big picture.\n\nWhy study in Sweden?\n\n1. It's free for most European students\n\nThat's right! If you come from the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), you don't have to pay any tuition fees to study at public universities in Sweden. And this is great news because you can use the money you save to cover living costs, which are above the European average.\n\n2. Freedom, equality, and sustainability\n\nThese are the three core values of the Swedish society and citizens. These values are reflected in all aspects of life, including work, education, the natural environment, and so on.\n\nSwedes will do as much they can to provide you with the support and resources you need to achieve your academic, professional, personal, or any other goal.\n\n3. Sweden is the best example of eco-friendliness\n\nIf you're environmentally conscious, you'll love living here. Sweden has been investing in the wellbeing and preservation of nature for a long time now.\n\nIt represents an example of what any nation can do through involvement and commitment. For instance, by 2040, Sweden aims to achieve 100% renewable energy production.\n\n4. Open and progressive mentality\n\nSweden is one of those wonderful places where you don't have to worry about being different or not fitting it. They embrace everybody regardless of their personal choices or background. Stockholm, for example, is often considered as one of the most open cities in the world.\n\n5. English is widely spoken\n\nOver 80% of Swedes speak English, which makes it super easy to interact with local people and find English-taught degrees in Sweden.\n\nStill, we recommend learning at least the basics of Swedish, the most common words, for those rare cases when you meet someone who doesn't speak the English language.\n\nWhich universities and colleges to attend in Sweden?\n\nSweden is home to over 35 universities and university colleges, and they all offer degree programmes according to European standards.\n\nStart your search for a dream Swedish university with one of these universities we recommend:\n\nUniversity West\n\nMälardalen University\n\nLinnaeus University\n\nJönköping University\n\nUniversity of Boras\n\nWorld Maritime University\n\nUppsala University\n\nWhat is it like to study in Sweden?\n\nStudying in Sweden is likely to make you feel relaxed. Yes, students need to work hard, and expectations are high, but the higher education system is also very flexible and informal.\n\nPopular student pastimes include team sports, cultural societies, and outdoor activities (performed very well dressed). There’s also a great nightlife, with clubs and bars dotting Sweden’s cities, and student unions organising evenings out.\n\nWhat to study in Sweden?\n\nSwedes are great with cars, great with IT, and great with the environment. So, it’s not hard to guess which are some of the most popular study areas in Sweden. These are:\n\nComputer Science degrees in Sweden\n\nEngineering degrees in Sweden\n\nArts degrees in Sweden\n\nEnvironmental Studies in Sweden\n\nCultural Studies in Sweden\n\nWhere to study in Sweden?\n\nSweden is a great place to live and study. From buzzing larger cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö, to cosy university towns like Uppsala and Lund, there’s a place for every taste in Sweden.\n\nWhether you end up close to the Arctic Circle in Luleå or bumping shoulders with continental Europe in Malmö, you’ll find accessible towns with extensive public transport and bustling student scenes.
