        "text": "The Europa League kicks off again this week with Arsenal heading out to Sweden to take on Ostersunds on Thursday night.\n\nIt will certainly be a new experience for the Gunners, with very little known about the Allsvenskan side over on these shores.\n\nBut they have shown already in the competition that they should not be underestimated by only losing once in the group stages and beating a team of the quality of Hertha Berlin.\n\nAhead of the game we caught up with Malin Hagg (@OneMalinH )‏ of the Arsenal Sweden Supporters' Club (@ArsenalSweden) to find out more and Thursday night's opponents and exactly what the travelling fans from north London should expect when they arrive in Scandinavia.\n\nFirst of all, the big question that everyone wants to know - How cold is it going to be out there?\n\nIt’s definitely going to be cold, but perhaps not as bad as we were worried about. According to the weather forecast it’ll be around -3 to -5 C during the evening.\n\nRight now it’s -13 though so you never do know. Either way – be sure to dress warm. Layers are your friend!\n\nWhat can the traveling Arsenal fans expect from their stay in the city.\n\nOstersund is not a big place and its entire population of 50,000 would fit inside Emirates Stadium! Ostersund are used to arranging sporting events, but usually the focus is on winter sports such as skiing, biathlon etc.\n\nLately the football club has gained a lot of attention though and there is no doubt that this is the biggest game in the club’s (pretty short) history. It will most likely be cold and dark, but the people are friendly, and I’m convinced Arsenal supporters will be warmly welcomed.\n\nCan you give any tips about what the traveling fans should do while they are in the city?\n\nI think the most obvious answer to that is: enjoy the winter! There will definitely be a lot of snow and there’s a possibility to do both alpine and cross-country skiing not too far from the city. There’s also a place where you can try biathlon if you’re feeling brave (although this might have to be pre-booked).\n\nLet’s talk about the game them. Ostersund’s rise in recent years has been a remarkable one, how are they viewed in Sweden?\n\nThis is a tricky question. Ostersund has received a lot of praise for doing things a bit differently with their culture approach and there is no denying that they have been very successful over the past few seasons.\n\nHowever, supporters of other Swedish clubs aren’t very impressed by them. Not only are they a very young club (which in itself isn’t impressive) but they have also introduced something they call “positive supporter culture” where the job of the supporters is to only cheer on the club/players and never to boo their own team, the opposition or other fans.\n\nThey’re very proud of this supporter culture, but it has been on the receiving end of quite a bit of ridicule from hard-core supporters of other Swedish clubs who value the rivalry and enjoy when it gets heated.\n\nAn English manager has been the man behind the success - Why do you think Graham Potter has been so successful?\n\nI think one of the reasons why Potter has been so successful is because the club trusts him. He has received a lot of freedom to work with the team and the players and I think Potter has a clear idea about what he wants from his players.\n\nIt hasn’t been all positives, but even during tougher times the club has stood by him and in the end that has shown results. It seems as if he’s got a close relationship with his players and they all seem to trust him completely and want to play for him.\n\nI think it’ll be hard to judge just how good Potter is as a manager until he manages another team, but there’s no denying he seems to be a great fit for Ostersund.\n\nWhat sort of football do Ostersund play?\n\nOstersund play their own style of football. They tend to be disrespectful when they meet teams that, on paper, should be better, which is something that can take other teams by surprise.\n\nThey rarely adapt their style of play to their opposition and when they were new in Allsvenskan (Swedish Premier League) they took more points off the top teams than the bottom ones.\n\nThey rarely do well against a team who sits back and defends well but can push forward if they’re allowed the space. I think a lot of other teams have underestimated Ostersund so let’s just hope Arsenal can learn from their mistakes.\n\nWho will be the danger man?\n\nBrwa Nouri is the captain and has been very important to them during the group stages but his fitness level is in doubt ahead of the game next week.\n\nIf he’s playing, I’d say he will be key to keep track on. If he’s not, I’d say Saman Ghoddos is the man to watch as I expect them to play a similar style as they did against Athletic Bilbao.\n\nHow much excitement is there in Sweden about the game?\n\nIn Ostersund the excitement is huge, of course, but Arsenal has a strong following in Sweden and the interest that Arsenal Sweden has had in this game is massive.\n\nLots of people have tried to get a hold of tickets and I think even neutrals are excited about a big team like Arsenal coming to a small town like Ostersund.\n\nWhat will it be like for you to see Arsenal play over in your own country.\n\nIt’ll be great, of course. Arsenal has been to Sweden quite a few times before, but they rarely play games that matter.\n\nThe last competitive game in Sweden was against AIK in the Champions League in 1999 so it’s great to see them here for a game that actually matters!\n\nIt means more people will come over from other countries, and it gives everything an extra edge. I’m very excited!\n\nAre you looking forward to meeting up with the traveling Arsenal fans?\n\nDefinitely! That’s the best part about European games – meeting other travelling supporters in weird places.\n\nYou guys have planned two events for Wednesday and Thursday nights haven’t you? Tell us a little about them and where the traveling Arsenal fans should go\n\nWell, we’ve made arrangements with Bishop’s Arms on Stortorget 8 (the big square). They have extended their opening hours until 2am on both Wednesday and Thursday, and on the game day they will open already at 1pm.\n\nWe have negotiated a deal on food and drinks and on Thursday the place is open to Arsenal supporters only.\n\nWe mostly wanted to have a place for pre-game drinks and somewhere for Arsenal supporters to go to meet other supporters.\n\nApart from opening and closing times there is nothing else to keep track of, we just hope to see as many of the travelling supporters as possible there for a great build-up."
