        "text": "In response to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, most countries adopted vaccination policies on the basis of clinical trial outcomes and scientific evidence for vaccine procurement and policy planning frameworks. Studies suggested that after Omicron variants emerged, persons receiving 2 COVID-19 vaccine doses might not be adequately protected against severe illness and death (1–8). Research indicated that persons who completed a primary vaccine series would need a booster dose for better protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants (9–13). Moreover, many countries provided several COVID-19 vaccine platform combinations (mix-and-match) of mRNA, protein subunit, and viral vector–based vaccines. However, few studies adopted population-level datasets and national vaccination registry records to examine the VE of mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine regimens against SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe illness, and death.\n\nGovernment agencies, including the UK Health Security Agency (14), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (7), Health Canada (15), and the Public Health Agency of Sweden (16), adopted sampling or regional data to routinely evaluate COVID-19 VE in real-world settings. Those authorities review VE for national vaccination strategies to improve public policy implementation and provide evidence to encourage vulnerable groups and at-risk populations to get vaccinated. However, most countries worldwide have experienced several waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and VE results could be affected by natural humoral immunity due to SARS-CoV-2 infection among populations. Thus, previous VE might be biased because of persons who were infected and vaccinated, reporting schemes, and fundamental distinctions among groups with different vaccination statuses.\n\nTaiwan offers various COVID-19 vaccines for the public, including mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 [https://www.pfizer.com] and Moderna mRNA-1273 [https://www.modernatx.com]), protein subunit (Medigen MVC-COV1901 [https://www.medigenvac.com]), and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 [https://www.novavax.com]), and viral vector-based vaccines (Oxford–AstraZeneca AZD1222 [https://www.astrazeneca.com]). In Taiwan, AZD1222 was introduced on March 22, 2021, mRNA-1273 on June 8, 2021, MVC-COV1901 on August 23, 2021, and BNT162b2 on September 22, 2021. Government-funded COVID-19 vaccines were provided and prioritized by risk groups, such as healthcare workers, COVID-19 control staff (e.g., frontline health authority, customs, immigration, and quarantine staff, and security workers), caregivers in social welfare facilities, and high-risk groups (such as persons receiving kidney dialysis, older adults, pregnant women, and patients with rare diseases, catastrophic illnesses, or chronic diseases). No preferential recommendations for specific vaccine platforms were offered, and COVID-19 vaccines were provided to risk groups on the basis of availability. Persons could choose and reserve any available COVID-19 vaccine platforms at the vaccination stations.\n\nIn Taiwan, after authorities investigated COVID-19 cases, most were classified as imported, and few autochthonous cases were reported until April 2022. Community outbreaks did not begin until May 2021 and all were controlled within 3 months (17,18). Moreover, the national COVID-19 vaccination program was initiated in March 2021 (19), and vaccine coverage was <1% of the population when community outbreaks occurred in May 2021. Those outbreaks were mainly an Alpha subvariant of SARS-CoV-2 and was well controlled under the country’s zero-COVID policy. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) conducted a seroprevalence survey on blood donors whose samples were obtained during January–April 2022. The national nucleocapsid protein positivity rate was 0.00%­–0.94%, showing that the population maintained a low level of COVID-19 infection. When a major outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant began in April 2022, the population could be regarded as SARS-CoV-2 immune naive. Thus, evaluating the nationwide VE of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine combinations among a population-based cohort became realistic after April 2022.\n\nWe launched this study and used national vaccination registration records and a mandatory patient-level COVID-19 reporting dataset to estimate real-world VE of mRNA, protein subunit, and viral vector-based vaccines against infection, severe disease, and death in this predominantly infection-naive population during Omicron BA.2 variant predominance in Taiwan, mainly April–September 2022. This study also aimed to provide an overview and review of the performance of various COVID-19 vaccine platforms and vaccine combinations against the SARS-CoV-2–associated severe illness and to provide evidence for the vaccination strategy and guidance for areas and countries where various vaccine types are available."
