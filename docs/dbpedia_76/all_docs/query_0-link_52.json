        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI’ve been running lots and lots of tests to try and characterise the effects of laser flare. Basically it’s as previously described by @Monger_Designs and @RocusHalbasch - in that I am seeing bad flaking and corrugated surfaces on parts - on the faces of parts matching brightest flare side.\n\nIt might be a little “tl;dw”, but I think this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gWAbKKrR6o illustrates it best - I’m not done yet, there’ll be at least one more video, probably two, but imo this is conclusive evidence of the issues that laser flare can cause.\n\nI call it conclusive proof - because it shows before and after prints - of identical form1 files, with the same vat, same resin (I didn’t even refill the resin, although I did have to strain it) - nothing changed between the prints except that I rotated the laser 180 degs in it’s aluminium block (I am always careful to be wired to earth before touching the laser) .\n\nAfter rotating the laser - the flaking and surface corrugation switches sides on the parts - ergo - the flaking and surface corrugation can only be caused by the laser flare.\n\nHere’s a pic of the type surface corrugation that I’ve been seeing - NOTE this is not flaking! these parts are washed, the corrugated surface is exactly that - corrugated.\n\nnote the right hand side (hinge side) front surfaces. They should be flat. Now contrast with the rear view:\n\nMore pictures to come along with more videos - I’m currently running taller versions of the same parts in the new grey resin with a brand new vat - both resin and vat having arrived yesterday.\n\nAs @Ante_Vukorepa and @JoshK have already said I think it’s now very clear that the Form1+ laser needs an iris (given that it seems extremely unlikely they would shift to an entirely new laser module). I’m not sure what the solution is though - Josh forwarded me his design but I think it would be difficult to install correctly.\n\nIn an ideal world Formlabs would step up - and ship out replacement lasers with pre-installed iris’s (the laser modules are exceedingly easy to install/uninstall) - and if the machine needed any configuration to match a new laser module, it could be done via Preform following an update allowing a remote connection to our Form1+'s.\n\nI’m not holding my breath though - in the meantime I’m working on my own iris design that I hope will be easy enough to install - but I’m certainly not 100% confident on that front.\n\nThoughts from the usual suspects? any unusual suspects? FL?\n\nSo continuing on - with taller parts now and in grey to show the flaking - these two were printed with the brightest laser flare pointing to the front of the machine, and as you can see - the front facing surfaces are covered in lots of flakes. Most of these will wash off - but the hinge side part will be left with surface corrugations. The non-hinge side part will probably come out fine\n\ncontrast this with the rear view of the same parts and note the lack of flakes.\n\nAfter these prints were completed, I rotated my laser - which I filmed and will provide a youtube link for - and started a new print of the exact same two parts, in the same vat with the same resin (after straining, and a top up) - mirrors as always have not been touched.\n\nThis is what my laser spot looks now - note the bright flare side is now pointing to the rear of the machine (oppositely oriented from when the parts above were printed) - this means the flaking on my parts currently printing will now be on the rear side faces instead of on the front.\n\nKevin,\n\nBrilliant illustration/investigation. I have exactly the same problem. Since upgrade to F1+ i have not had one good print, mostly total failures. Been through all the mirror cleaning and exchanging the big mirror in contact with support. Still same problem and my printer is actually useless… Before upgrade my laser point was really a spot but now it has the same shape as you show. I think my failures are due to the broad laser creates a lot of jelly flakes, increases over time the print goes on until the part failes. The jelly production after upgrade is huge compared to before when the laser had a good spot.\n\nDo you have any idea what the technical difference is between the F1+ laser and the older one? Changes made to be able to measure the laser effect…?\n\nWill keep up the communication with F1 support - soon to see what their next move will be. New laser…\n\nKeep up your good work!\n\nRegards\n\nKjell Nilsson\n\nÖstersund, SWEDEN\n\n@RocusHalbasch — ya’ll are on the bleeding edge!\n\nWe have found, in general, that in many cases where people have laser concern, it is often associated with dusty or dirty mirrors, poor part orientation, dirty resin tanks, etc. The issues caused by the artifacts here, while important, are not (in general) a widespread cause of complete print failures. I think that’s what contributing to the mixed messages you’re seeing from our support team, who are chiefly focused on making sure that everyone is successfully printing, and may be less able to address the complex issues that @KevinHolmes and others have raised. I would be surprised if anyone on our team has outright denied that what we’re seeing here might be an issue—I think they’ve only shared what we know, which, of course, is always less than we’d like.\n\nI do know that our team has gone to great lengths to verify issues, attempt to repeat exact prints, etc. More difficult questions, like those here, are referred to R&D and engineering teams, who are continuing to take a look at the issue, but that does take time.\n\nIn short, as @Monger_Designs says, we care, we’re trying, and I for one, think we’ve been doing a good job of it. That doesn’t mean we’re perfect—far from it—but we’re planning on sticking around for the long haul, and the only way we know how to do that, is to make a great machine at a great price, so that’s what we’re going to keep on working on."
