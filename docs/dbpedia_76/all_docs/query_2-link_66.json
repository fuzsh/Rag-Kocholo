        "text": "Arsenal host Ostersunds FK in the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie on Thursday night at the Emirates.\n\nThe Gunners overcame freezing conditions and an artificial pitch to triumph 3-0 against the Swedes in the first leg last Thursday, but they will need to finish the job when the teams meet again this week.\n\nGoals at the Jamtkraft Arena came courtesy of Nacho Monreal, Mesut Ozil and an own goal from Sotirios Papagiannopoulos to make the north London outfit firm favourites to progress to the last-16.\n\nThe positive news for Arsene Wenger is that he can rotate his squad and rest key first-team players ahead of the important Carabao Cup final on Sunday against a Manchester City side looking to make amends for their disappointing defeat to Wigan in the FA Cup last night.\n\nWhat time is Arsenal vs Ostersunds kick-off?\n\nThe Europa League fixture will be held on Thursday 22 February.\n\nThe game will be hosted at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nKick-off is at 8.05pm.\n\nWhat TV channel is Arsenal vs Ostersunds on?"
