Well done if you make it to the end. Also, please click the ‘follow’ button on the bottom right hand corner of your screen, then you will get email updates! Just what you wanted for Christmas!\n\nExpectation: Sweden in winter is snowy, cold and dark.\n\nReality: We are in Östersund during possibly its worst winter in memory. Temperatures are normally between -10 and -5, instead the temperature is between about 0 and 5, or 10 degrees above average. This means those nice thick gloves I bought in Italy haven’t been used yet.\n\nReality: We get 5cm of snow every couple of days, but each time it warms up again, sometimes raining a little, which adds to the thick layer of ice on every footpath and road. I didn’t see the bus that slid 20 metres down a hill side-on, but running to the gym is enough excitement for the day.\n\nReality: Despite it being the winter solstice, it actually doesn’t feel that dark here. Sure, the sun rises at 9:40 and sets at 2:20, but the trails are lit, and there is plenty of twilight either side. We have seen the sun much more than expected, although at 3.6 degrees above the horizon, it’s hardly enough to get a tan going, even with my easily burned skin.\n\nExpectation: Sweden is ethnically homogenous, inhabited mostly by white Scandinavians.\n\nReality: There is a surprising amount of diversity here, even in Östersund, which is a long way north. Many seem to come from North Africa, but the most popular type of restaurant is Thai or Turkish, where we hope to eat soon, although it may not happen with Swedish prices.\n\nExpectation: Ikea furniture is everywhere.\n\nReality: Having been in precisely zero Swedish houses, I can’t really tell this one yet, but the room Jackson and I are sharing doesn’t seem to have any storage, let alone a Fjell wardrobe, Expedit shelving or a Malm bedside table with drawers. Don’t pretend you don’t already own those items.\n\nExpectation: Sweden has a way of protecting people from the worst of capitalism\n\nReality: Sweden may have a good degree of wealth equality, but just about the only thing advertised on TV seems to be online gambling, where they don’t even pretend to warn you about the dangers of addiction. I guess even perfect people (or nations) have their vices.\n\nExpectation: Everyone in Sweden drives a Volvo\n\nReality: This one is actually pretty close. There are A LOT of Volvos cruising around. Coming from a family of Volvo addicts, I’ve managed to spot four of the last five models we’ve owned all in a single day. Sad, I know.\n\nRacing\n\nOn Saturday most of the team competed in the Daniel Karlssons Minne race, which took place just outside our cabins at the Östersund stadium. The girls all had solid races, with Casey picking up third place in the 19-20 age group, and some cash to go with it. I was feeling pretty tired and lacked a bit of motivation during the 7.5km, mass-start race, skiing fairly hard but not particularly intelligently to post a mediocre result (definitely not last though). I’m probably not doing any more races until I get back to Italy, and I’m now looking forward to three weeks of tough training while I prepare for World U23 Championships, back in Val di Fiemme.\n\nAdventuring\n\nToday we went to Vålådalen, a little hamlet in the mountains about 100km from Östersund, near the Norwegian border. They had about 33km groomed, so naturally I tried to ski all of them, and almost succeeded. One of the trails started off with a 2.5km climb straight up a road, then did a spectacular loop up around the treeline, giving us great view across the mountains. As you can see from the GPS output, the track was twistier than Georgie Hincapie’s varicose veins.\n\nAnd some pictures:\n\nBathing\n\nWe now have an ice bath on our veranda. Fortunately it is slightly warmer than the river in the previous photo, but I went in it once when there was a layer of ice on top. We have to stay in for five minutes up to our shoulders, to help with our recovery. Whilst it is kind of enjoyable in a masochistic sort of way (nothing to do with 50 Shades, get your mind out of the gutter), I really hope it works because it is very cold in there.\n\nWater Slides (again)\n\nWherever there is a water slide, we will ride it. This particular water park had a 120m long slide where we could go in formation for extra speed. Being Europe, there was very little supervision, until we got the bottom, displacing a whole heap of water out of the slide and onto the floor and laughing a lot in the process, where we found a lifeguard. He looked at us sternly, and we thought we were about to get a talking to, but he just wanted to tell us the best formation to go down in for maximum speed. He also let us use tubes (like snow tubes) to go down the slide in, despite them being locked up because someone had flipped one a few days before and had hurt themselves.\n\nThere was also a diving board, where, while going for greatest distance, I managed to land on my face. Let’s just say that I’m more skilled when the water is in solid form.\n\nChristmas\n\n2013 marked the 6th Christmas away from Australia for me, and the 5th without my family. I will never complain about this because I am amazingly lucky to do what I do. Fortunately, the other skiers are like a family to me, one of whom I’ve spent the past 4 years with. Linky cooked us delicious Swedish meatballs, or fake meatballs a.k.a. featballs (say it out loud) for the vegetarians. I scored highly in Kris Kringle, picking up a $10 plastic toboggan that even has brakes, which makes it safer than rollerskiing, the thing I spend a couple of hundred hours a year doing. Maybe I’m in the wrong sport.\n\nUntil next time!"
