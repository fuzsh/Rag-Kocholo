        "text": "Sam Mensiro will never forget the meeting he had with Graham Potter when he returned from Swedish rivals Orebro to play under the current Brighton and Hove Albion head coach for a second time at Ostersund.\n\n“I got married when I moved to Orebro and it didn’t work out,” the Ghanaian defender explains. “He re-signed me. He saw I was going through a lot.\n\n“He called me into his office, sat me down, and spoke to me. He knew what I could bring to the team and he knew if I was sad, because of my marriage, it would affect me.\n\n“Once I spoke to him, all the sadness I was going through after the divorce disappeared. He told me he brought me to Sweden, he believed in me, and I could help the team a lot.\n\n“That was a special day for me. After that, I felt I had a new life to live.”\n\nPotter’s Brighton launch the second half of their season at the Amex Stadium tonight with the chance to climb to eighth in the Premier League if they beat bitter rivals Crystal Palace. That would take them within a point of Manchester United.\n\nThe 46-year-old’s reputation as one of the brightest head coaches in the country continues to blossom.\n\nSince taking over in May 2019 after a year in the Championship with Swansea City, Potter has been turning Brighton from perennial bottom-six strugglers into an emerging force, playing a stylish brand of football.\n\nThat doesn’t surprise some of the players that have worked under the widely travelled ex-defender.\n\nA picture emerges of a leader who commands respect, commitment to the cause and a willingness to embrace new challenges with a blend of high-level coaching and empathy.\n\nFormer Brighton and Palace striker Glenn Murray played under a long list of managers during a 17-year career in the top four divisions of English football at nine clubs, including Eddie Howe, Neil Warnock, Alan Pardew and Chris Hughton. None of them matched Potter’s imaginative thought process.\n\n“He takes into consideration that we’re humans and humans make mistakes,” Murray says. “What he wants off the back of that is our reaction from that mistake to be positive.\n\n“So, he accepts that things aren’t going to go right all the time, that people are going to miss a shot or a pass, but as long as they’re trying the right thing, he’s happy.\n\n“But it’s how you react to that negative. If you make a bad pass, if your head drops and you don’t run back, he’s not going to applaud you for that.\n\n“It’s about moving onto the next phase as quickly as possible. If something bad happens, then you just go again, again and again. It’s getting that reaction time quicker and quicker to not let disappointments, or good things, impact on what you do next.\n\n“That was the first time in my career such a big onus had been put on that. No one wants to see a player throw his arms in the air or reacting badly to a decision, or to something happening in a game.\n\n“Graham came in and made a point of this immediately. He didn’t need something to happen to make a point of it — he wanted to highlight this point before anything happened, before the instinct took place.”\n\nBrighton supporters have become accustomed to seeing Potter applauding his players in the technical area, hands raised above his head, even when things go wrong.\n\nZambian midfielder Enock Mwepu, signed from Red Bull Salzburg last summer, says: “Graham always wants us to play the next action. That’s the confidence that he gives us.\n\n“When we make mistakes, he always tells us to work on the next action. That’s why, when one of us makes a mistake, he always tries to clap, as if to say, ‘Come on, another one’, instead of staying on the mistakes, pointing at each other. We just want to work for him all the time and see what we can achieve.”\n\nThe experiences he had during his own playing career have impacted on the way Potter has treated his players since moving into coaching.\n\nHe played for Southampton in the Premier League and for England Under-21s but didn’t sustain a career at elite level, gradually dropping down into the lower divisions.\n\n“I psychologically didn’t help myself; wasn’t strong enough,” Potter tells The Athletic. “I suppose your strength is your weakness. I always thought to myself that can bring you down a little bit. Maybe, as a manager, it helps you a little bit more because you are thinking, ‘How can I improve?’\n\n“That’s why I stopped playing when I did at 30 because I didn’t want to be that player who got somebody the sack because my attitude was wrong or I wasn’t really at a point where I could give everything.”\n\nA fascination with the way Pep Guardiola’s teams attack began for Potter when the Manchester City manager was at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. He’s not a clone of the Spaniard’s methods but his training sessions are based primarily around possession.\n\nAt Ostersund, he steered the club from the Swedish fourth tier to the top tier, and the last 32 of the Europa League.\n\nMansiro says: “In pre-season training, we didn’t run that much.\n\n“We used the ball a lot. Most teams they run a lot; bleep tests and everything. We always used the ball from day one, getting used to possession. That’s why when it came to the games, we had a lot of possession.”\n\nPotter’s intellectual, level-headed demeanour is reflected in training.\n\n“Very calm, very structured, always thought behind the process,” Murray says.\n\n“He’d try to get the boys to understand as well. It wouldn’t just be doing something and hopefully the penny drops. There would be complete clarity from players and management: why were we doing it and what it was in aid of — a cultured, relaxed, encouraging environment.\n\n“That’s what struck me the most when he came in: the culture off the field. Not that it was ever a bad place to work. I always enjoyed my time at the training ground but he made it even more comfortable and more friendly — more of an environment that you wanted to hang around in, stay and learn.”\n\nOne of Potter’s traits is taking players out of their comfort zone, using them in positions previously unfamiliar to them. Mwepu has played in a variety of midfield and more advanced roles in different team formations during his first six months at the club.\n\n“That’s what makes him a good coach,” says the 24-year-old Zambia international. “He always tries to give us challenges as players, tries to put us in positions where we don’t want to play but adapt to that.\n\n“He’s there to guide and help you with that. It’s good for me as well, playing in different positions.”\n\nThe self-deprecating Potter’s multi-tasking philosophy stems again from his playing days as predominantly a left-back with clubs as diverse as Southampton in the Premier League to Macclesfield in the fourth tier and, at the start of his coaching journey, at Leeds Metropolitan University in the ninth-tier Northern Counties East League.\n\nHe says: “There’s the bottom, then there’s four or five rungs down — and that’s where I started off!\n\n“When you start off there, you have to think outside the box. You have to work with what you have. You have to be creative, you have to try to maximise everything you have. That’s just been part of how I’ve got to where I’ve got to.\n\n“For me, it’s quite normal. I think it’s common sense to look at the attributes of a player and see how you can maximise and use them.”\n\nFor Mensiro at Ostersunds, that often led to specific tasks.\n\n“He knew the team we were playing against,” says the 32-year-old. “If they were strong on the left side, he’d work more on that. Or maybe the striker; work more with the centre-backs. It would depend on the game.\n\n“He always had an assignment for me. If they had a good midfielder, I’d man-to-man mark him. He’d always have a way of winning.”\n\nAlthough Potter’s character is serene, it doesn’t make him boring or immune from displays of humour and anger.\n\nMensiro says: “There was a day in training. We were doing possession and I went into a tackle. He wasn’t happy about it.\n\n“It happened again, so he stopped the game and had the ball, so I went in and tried to kick the ball.\n\n“He said, ‘Nobody go near Sam, he’d kick his grandma!'”\n\nPotter tries to make the daily routine of players enjoyable but he also has a steely edge. He has no time for bad eggs or anyone threatening the harmony of the group.\n\nHe doesn’t shy away from tough selection decisions, even if it means leaving out somebody who’s played well.\n\nMurray explains: “If you are not on board with his philosophy and thought process, then you won’t be at the football club. It’s very much a collective, regardless who starts during the game.\n\n“It’s easier for me to understand now I am out of the game from a management point of view.\n\n“Being a substitute is not necessarily a bad thing but it’s that word ‘clarity’ again. There’s a whole understanding from the 25 players that literally anyone could start any weekend and there’s no time or room for outward disappointment.\n\n“So, if you’re not playing, you’re supporting the players that are playing and vice versa because there will be constant changes for what he feels can hurt the opposition best for whatever game he is preparing for. It’s nothing personal.\n\n“We’re seeing more of the squad used, which is a more modern philosophy in football because there are so many games. Graham rotates the squad of 25 really well.”\n\nPutting the team above individuals doesn’t come at the expense of a caring approach by Potter to each of his players.\n\nHe’s helped Mwepu to adapt to a new country and a new league since the Zambian’s move in July from Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga.\n\n“Graham has been a good mentor to me ever since I met him,” Mwepu says. “He’s been guiding me and helping me; especially bringing confidence and trying to fit in well with the group.\n\n“So, in that regard, he is someone I looked forward to working for. That relationship has enabled me to settle at Brighton quickly.”\n\nPotter took Mensiro to Sweden with Ostersunds in 2011 when he was in his early twenties. Mensiro played against Potter’s Leeds Metropolitan University team as a student at Hartpury College in Gloucestershire. He had a spell at League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers when they were a National League side in 2009-10, in between playing in non-League football for Ledbury Town and Evesham United.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings, Mensiro played for Potter in the Swedish top flight and against Arsenal in the last 32 of the Europa League in 2018.\n\n“He’s like my dad,” says Mensiro. “He was the one who gave me the opportunity to start my football career.\n\n“I enjoyed every minute I played under him. It’s not just as a coach, it’s more like as a dad. He’s there for you if you have any problems. He’s the Special One.”\n\nA player’s view of a coach or manager can be shaped to a certain extent by how they fared under him. That isn’t the case with Murray, even though it was Potter who effectively ended the top-flight career of a man that had been Brighton’s top scorer in the Premier League for two seasons under previous manager Chris Hughton.\n\nMurray was 35 when Potter took charge. The centre-forward’s game time gradually reduced and he ended his career in the Championship with Watford and Nottingham Forest, where he was reunited with Hughton.\n\nIt hasn’t affected Murray’s opinion.\n\n“I appreciate how good he is,” says the player-turned-pundit. “I enjoyed playing for him. He was very new. I played under Eddie Howe (at Bournemouth), who showed similarities, but Graham was even more what I’d call the modern-day football coach.\n\n“I learnt a lot under him. He was very approachable, no matter whether it was football or family reasons; always very understanding of all situations, very open-minded.\n\n“All round, he’s a good guy and he’s a very good football manager as well.”\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)"
