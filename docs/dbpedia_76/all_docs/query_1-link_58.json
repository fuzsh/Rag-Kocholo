        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nBiathlon is a winter sport that combines the physiologically challenging cross-country (XC) skiing with the fine motor skills of rifle marksmanship. To be a successful endurance athlete, such as a biathlete, the athlete must accumulate a large amount of physical training [1] along with sufficient recovery [2]. Previous studies have shown that XC skiing explains roughly 50% of the variation in biathlon performance in individual races [3] and ~ 60% in sprint biathlon races [3] while the remaining variation is explained by the shooting performance (shooting time and shooting results) [3, 4].\n\nBiathlon training is performed using multiple types of training modes, for instance: running, roller skiing, cycling and on-snow skiing [5, 6].When monitoring physical training in biathlon, the training dose is based on duration, mode of exercise and intensity. The intensity is usually scaled based on the percentage of maximum heart rate (HRmax) [7] or as the relationship between the heart rate (HR) and lactate values [5, 8, 9]. The duration at each intensity can be allocated either as the time in zone, based on the recorded time in different intensity zones; the session goal, based on the main intensity goal of a single session; or as a combination of the time spent in each zone and the main goal for the session [10, 11]. In general, as adolescent athletes age they are encouraged to train more systematically and with greater volume and specialization in order to prepare for more training and competition later in their career [12]. There are reasons to believe that a simple copy-paste strategy from a senior athlete’s training structure is not optimal as it comes with a risk of injury or less than optimal development, due to the difference in training volume and biological maturation between adolescents and fully matured athletes [13, 14]. Endurance athletes in mid and late adolescence have been reported to exercise at least five times a week [15] or about 7 hours of endurance training [16]. Most late-adolescent athletes that aim to compete at an international level need to balance an athletic career and school simultaneously, through a double career in a school-sport system. Prior to upper secondary school (USS), most adolescent athletes choose to specialize, by choosing one sport to focus on while stopping practicing other sports, and to train and compete for > 8 months per year [12, 17]. Many USS provide resources for student-athletes to advance within a particular sport while simultaneously preparing for an academic career, for example through adequate facilities [18], coaches and adjusting the school schedule to training and competitions [19]. Many schools allow their students to extend their school attendance by one extra year to ease the double-career transition and maximize training. However only a fraction of athletes that try to maximize the outcomes of both a sporting career and an academic career actually succeed in doing so [17].\n\nGiven the limited knowledge of biathlon training in general and adolescent biathlon training in particular, the aim of this study was to retrospectively describe the longitudinal changes of training variables in adolescent biathletes based on performance level.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study is the first to retrospectively describe the longitudinal changes of training variables in adolescent biathletes based on performance level, in a structured training environment. The NTB had a greater volume of training than the NLB during USS. While the NTB managed to increase their training on a linear basis, the NLB did not further increase the volume of their training during Y4. NTB also showed a greater use of more sport specific training modes compared to NLB a well as a greater number of shots fired during both LIT and HIT.\n\nThe linear increase in training volume for NTB is mainly explained by the training they did during the GP, since the two groups did not differ in training volume over the other training phases. Given that the GP stretches over the summer months, the vast majority of the phase covers the summer vacation when no common structured training is performed. Consequently, more of the training needs to be self-motivated by the biathlete. Previous research has showed that athletes who successfully adhere to a training plan had a greater level of self-motivation compared to those who were less successful in adhering to the planned training [23]. Heavy training periods have been reported to increase the risk of mood disturbance in adolescent athletes, resulting in periods of staleness and loss of motivation [24]. Mood disturbance in athletes has previously been shown to increase linearly with training load [25]. Since the GP is generally considered to be the toughest training period in biathlon, the increased training load during this period could affect some biathletes negatively with mood disturbance and a loss of motivation to train. Other psychological factors such as the athlete-coach relationship have been suggested to play a major role for sport drop-out in adolescent athletes [26] and their ability to respond to training [27]. The desire to further develop in a main sport is also an important personal attribute for an athlete’s motivation [28]. In a study by Karlsson et al., [20], adolescent national-team XC skiers aged 16 trained approximately 450 hours and then increased their training volume in a linear fashion over their final adolescent years. Since linear increase in the training volume seems to be a factor for further success in skiing sports, and both performance groups are part of the same school system, with the same opportunity to train equally for the majority of the time, the result of this study should be of interest to USS from a supportive perspective, as well as to coaches. The annual training volume reported by the NTB is similar to other studies examining the training characteristics of international-level biathletes [5, 8, 29].The distribution of ~ 90% LIT is similar to that of international senior-level athletes in XC-skiing and biathlon [1, 8]. Notably both the age and level of performance are considered greater in those papers [30]. The similarities in training characteristics between studies despite the age and performance level can partly be explained by the variety of tools (e.g. training diary, method of reporting, technology etc.) used by athletes, coaches and associations to plan and monitor training.\n\nThe number of training sessions performed by late-adolescent athletes of different performance groups has previously been reported to not be a factor for further success [31]. In accordance with the present results, the greater training volume of the NTB with the same training frequency can be partly explained by the longer duration of each session, leading to more total accumulated training time. Training volume in biathlon is affected by the time spent on shooting practice, which gives less time to accumulate endurance training to the same extent when training is combined with shooting practice compared to unmitigated endurance training. This may indicate that the NTB assesses their physical training differently compared to the NLB, hence adding more physical training for compensating for the combined training.\n\nThe NTB had a greater volume of training in all specific training forms, showing the increased importance of sport-specific stimuli during both summer and winter conditions for selection as an NTB. The distribution of specific vs general training in the present study is similar to the previously reported results of a world-class XC skier [32]. It has previously been reported that highly skilled athletes accumulated more hours of structured training during late adolescence compared to less skilled athletes [33]. A high volume of year-round training with the primary aim to improve performance is the typical definition of sport specialization [34, 35]. Schooling in a structured training environment at a sport-focused USS should therefore be considered as an active sport-specialization. However, biathlon training is based on several different types of training forms [5, 6], diversifying the stimuli while still defining it as the main sport. In XC skiing, which has a very closely related training regime to biathlon, late adolescent XC skiers reported that 98% of their training is main-sport specific [36]. Previous studies have raised concerns about the increased risk of injury and psychological burnout from too-early sport specialization in adolescent athletes [13, 37], however the risk of injury from specialization in late-adolescent athletes is not as clear [38].\n\nThe greater volume of specific training simultaneously reflects the difference in number of shots fired in both LIT and HIT. Accordingly, the NTB spent a greater amount of their training on skis and thus fired more shots. In this study, the total number of shots fired by both groups is well under the reported number of shots reported in previous studies of international level biathletes [6, 8]. The vast majority (> 60%) of the shots in the present study were fired during precision exercises in various states of unloaded training. Precision shooting is often the back-bone of all shooting training with the goal to improve technical factors for accuracy and speed of preparation [6]. Technical factors such as stability of hold, shooting accuracy, triggering [39], minimal body sway and rifle movement [40, 41] are all associated with better shooting performance. However, shooting performance has been shown to decrease with elevated physical intensity. After high-intensity exercise, the stability of hold [42] along with postural balance and aiming accuracy [43] are all impaired. Thus, there is a need to train during conditions that are similar to those of a competition to improve performance. Greater skill acquisition in fine motor tasks induced by training has been shown to affect neural function and connectivity in the brain [44]. Since the NTB training consisted of significantly more shots fired during HIT compared to the NLB, prospective NTB could have improved their technical shooting skills during intense exercise and competitions. In previous studies, the number of missed targets has been shown to influence the final ranking at world cup competitions [45, 46]. Since selection to a national team is mainly based on competition results, the shooting accuracy during HIT and competitions is of great importance.\n\nIllness and injury occurred equally frequently in both groups and did not explain the difference between the NTB and NLB. Differences in performance level have previously been reported to not affect the risk of becoming ill or injured [38]. Adolescent biathletes seemed to be ill to the same degree as other adolescent winter athletes [20]. The prevalence of training cessation due to injury was not frequently reported in the present study (~1–2 days/year). One explanation could be that biathlon training can be fitted around many types of injuries through alternative training [47]. Types of injuries are not reported in this study, however previous studies of biathlon and XC skiing have shown that injuries are more frequent in the lower extremities compared to other body parts [47, 48].\n\nThere are some limitations that should be considered in the present study. The use of a new system for training planning and registration, together with self-reported data, should be considered when interpreting the data. The potential limitation of a retrospective study should be noted, as the data doesn’t present any cause-effects relationship. The generalization that all biathletes will be of the same performance level if performing the same training may not be applicable. Furthermore, the dataset did not include other training forms such as strength or power that have been recorded in other studies of XC skiers [49, 50] due to the inconsistency on how to quantify these variables over this time period."
