She has had a large number of exhibitions at art galleries and museums in Sweden but is also in great demand internationally. Among other things, she has been shown at galleries in New York, Los Angeles, Rome and Barcelona, but also at the Swedish embassy in Washington and at several international art fairs.\n\nIn his embroidery, Lasson uses only the black thread, which creates a graphic and strong expression. Her work is primarily about how we treat nature in Sweden's northern areas."
