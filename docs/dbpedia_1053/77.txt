A 32-year-old actress has defended her relationship with her OAP partner who is 39 years her senior.

Anica Lazić came under fire after sharing photos of her sunning herself on holiday with lover Lazar Ristovski, 71.

Ristovski is a famous actor and director in their homeland Serbia.

He has starred in nearly 100 films, including a small part in the James Bond thriller ‘Casino Royale’ in 2006.

The couple has been together for two years.

However, their age gap has raised eyebrows in Serbia ever since their romance became public.

After sharing holiday snaps on her socials, one fan spat: “It’s not real love”.

Her followers promptly came to her defence and Lazić posted their responses on Instagram Stories.

One fan replied: “As someone who is married to a man 42 years older than me, I completely understand you and send my support in every sense, love is love.”

Lazić responded: “This message especially blew me away.”

Another follower said: “True love radiates, those of us who have it know the truth. Those who do not, unfortunately, do not understand. You are an inspiration.”

The actress replied: “This is one of the most beautiful messages I’ve received today.”

She recently said of her OAP beau: “Lazarus means ‘God helps’.

“It is believed a man with that name was sent by God to help the Earth.

“I know it’s so.”

She continued: “You are a winner, a benefactor, our greatest artist.

“A protector, an optimist, a patriot, someone who is bold and brave, and a great friend.”

In March this year, Lazić shared a photo of her walking out of the sea hand-in-hand with her fella in the Maldives.

She called it one of her favourite images of them together, as reported by What’s the Jam.

She wrote: “When he leads, I don’t ask where.”
