        "text": "The story of a young man who, in 1991. receives order to report to a military drill, and finds himself on Vukovar front, where he spends five months. Returning from there, he discovers changes within himself, but within his home town also. Totally lost, he finds no way to make contact with the environment, and suddenly experiences love with the girl who survived all horrors of that war...\n\nBased on a comedy TV series about Serbian \"aristocracy\" during the Turkish \"answer\" to the Serbian Uprising during the Serbian-Turkish war in the 19th century. During this time it was of the utmost importance to take the right steps and wisdom is really needed for making those right steps. With the help of a fortune teller, Karadjordje (the leader of the Uprising) learns that, according to a legend, somewhere in the hills exists a Stone of Wisdom which makes you, if you hit your head against it three times, more wise. So he employs his nephew Crni Gruja, with assistants Ceda Velja and Bole, to find him this miraculous Stone. Crni Gruja finds the Stone and, convinced that he is really becoming more wiser, decides to make some business.\n\nA small border post on the Yugoslav-Albanian border in the spring of 1987. Frustrated and always drunk, lieutenant Pasic feels a strange pain in his groins. He seeks help from the only doctor among the soldiers, Sinisa, who diagnoses a sexually transmitted disease. Not wishing his wife to know about it and trying to find excuses not to go home, he declares a state of emergency, claiming that the Albanian army is preparing an attack against Yugoslavia. A joke transforms into war hysteria: soldiers dig trenches, Pasic grows wilder as the days go by, Sinisa embarks on a dangerous liaison, and his best friend Ljuba decides to leave the army. The situation slowly runs out of control...\n\nMacak (The Cat) is the best basketball player around the blocks of New Belgrade. Meanwhile, his friend is bullied by a local gangster Coma, whom he owns money. To pay off his debt, Macak will play 1 on 1 with the rival player, eventually winning it. However, Coma doesn't stand on his promise, so Macak decides to solve this problem the other way.\n\nAlek is desperate because Teodora has left him after a three-year relationship. Suffering and apathetic, he mentions suicide constantly; he simply does not want to accept that the relationship is over. He has self-pitying sessions with his friend Bane every day. Despite Bane's advice, Alek keeps calling Teodora, who has fallen in love with Nemanja. However decisive and tough Teodora is when she is with Alek, she is indulgent and helpless when she's with Nemanja. Nemanja is not in love with her but with Marina, a girl a few years younger than he is; Marina, in turn, is not in love with him but is very attracted to Alek's \"Slavic depression.\" She doesn't know that his \"desperation charm\" comes from his failure with Teodora; she thinks he was born like that.\n\nIn 1999 Belgrade, producer Sergei and his film crew are in a disastrous situation: The film they're making is under threat; there's no money, the crew are dissatisfied, and NATO bombing is just around the corner. Then Mileta, a member of the State Security Service, comes looking for American co-producer Harvey. Anxious and worried in the midst of the bombing that's begun, Sergei hides Harvey from what he thinks is awaiting him: arrest. During the night, he thinks up a plan. He announces the start of filming on a new, patriotic film, in which the main role will be played by Harvey. The plan works--the State supports the film, and Mileta, as the State's representative, joins the crew. However, the underlying conflict between Mileta and Sergei explodes during the first screening. Mileta accuses them of being artists and not being patriots. Sergei begins to realize that he has endangered not only the film but the lives of the whole crew. A tragic death provokes a real revolt amongst the crew and some refuse to keep filming. Embittered by their 'unpatriotic' stance, Mileta arrests the protagonists and forces them to continue. Sergei, whose wife and child have now left, and who is accused of collaborating with Mileta by the rest of the crew, thinks up another plan."
