        "text": "\"On Retracing Images: The essays in this collection disclose cultural and political dynamics as they occurred before and in the wake of Yugoslavia's dissolution (1991-92) by analyzing visual data such as film, art, graffiti, street-art, public advertisement, memorials, and monuments. Within the vast field of Balkan Studies such visual materials have rarely been taken for important empirical evidence. Against the still widely held presumption that the cultural production of allegedly \"totalitarian\" states such as Yugoslavia can be neglected as they were penetrated by state ideology, the contributions offer a corrective image of the complex ideological dynamics and discoursive potentials in various artistic and cultural fields. Phenomena such as \"Titostalgia\", nationalist mobilization, nation-branding, rewriting of history, inventing of traditions, and symbolic violence that have surfaced in recent years are interpreted in the light of Yugoslavia's legacy. Contributors include: Zoran Terzić, Elissa Helms, Miklavz Komelj, Nebojša Jovanović, Isabel Ströhle, Sezgin Boynik, Gregor Bulc, Davor Beganović, Robert Alagjozovski, Gal Kirn, Mitja Velikonja, Daniel Šuber, and Slobodan Karamanić.\"\n\nThe paper will examine the theoretical works on the experimental film in Yugoslavia during the period of the early 1960s, the period often referred to as cinema of the second avant-garde. Being influenced by the early and formative years of formalist film theory and following the tendencies in the artistic and curatorial practices in Yugoslavia (other line), the decades after WW2 were marked by authors and films that were brought up by the amateur cine-clubs and the independent film festivals. The second avant-garde is a period of the redefined experimental cinema which had an enormous influence on further evolution of Yugoslav “autochthonous” and radical film movements, such as “The Black Wave.” This paper has an aim of analytical approach towards the cinema of the second avant-garde with regards to influences that shaped it as well to those which were shaped by it, taking into consideration both socio-political and socio-cultural context of Yugoslavia in the early 1960s. In this regard, in the paper will also be presented the brief analysis of the antifilm phenomenon and its originator—Mihovil Pansini.\n\nIn the present paper I examine the so called neo-avantgarde films made in Balázs Béla Studio, Budapest, Hungary, between seventies and eighties. These films eventually were made not by professional film directors, but by artists who were active in many branches of art, e.g. conceptualism, happening, performance , experimental painting, photo and literature etc. They were focusing on materiality of film, geometric abstraction and seriality, intermediality, experimental montage and renewing of the classical tradition of allegorical montage, new combinations of sound and image etc. Naturally, these procedures were not permitted in mainstraim film industry, not to mention the fact that they were not acceptable from the point of view of the ideology of social realism. The question is how these films tried to improve the double criticism the targets of which were the hegemon ideology in politics and the hegemon forms of reality.\n\nPrompted by comments and criticisms of a paper dealing with Emir Kusturica’s Zivot je cudo made by an anonymous reviewer I hope to address three issues: 1) the expansion of the canon studied, 2) the ideological slant of the study, and 3) the question of weight given to extra-textual evidence. First, the reviewer points out that studying Kusturica’s movies, especially Underground, brings nothing new to the table because it rehashes old formulas touching either on ethnic propaganda (Cerovic 1995, Finkielkraut 1995a, 1995b) or on Balkan stereotypes (Iordanova 2001, Zizek 1997a, 1997b, Levi 2007). New movies and director’s should be sought out in order to apply Todorova’s (1997) theoretical framework. I argue that it is illegitimate to expand the canon to works the circulation of which is limited and that is why Kusturica remains our best bet. Nevertheless, I demonstrate that the focus should be switched from Underground to Zivot je cudo. Secondly, I tackle the reviewer’s skepticism of “insider” analysis because it necessarily has an ideological/nationalistic slant (the reviewer points out all ex-Yugoslav commentators have something to gain or lose by the virtue of their nationalities). I point out that the study of Balkanism is itself a political project and thus has an ideological slant, and that the commentators, regardless of their nationality stand to gain or lose something. Thus, we should focus on the comments made not the commentators. Finally, I conclude with an appeal to giving intra-textual evidence or rebuttals of Balkanism greater emphasis than extra-textual ones, especially because in Kusturica’s case it reveals that the often overlooked aesthetic break that takes place with Dom za vesanje goes hand in hand with the representation of Balkan sterotypes. Whether this is subversion or proliferation of Balkanism remains to be settled."
