Early that same month, France and Britain landed four divisions at Salonika, respectively under General Sarrail and General Sir Byron Mahon, to assist their outnumbered Serbian ally caught between the invading forces. The Serbs fought while retreating southwards with the plan to withdraw into Macedonia to link up with Allied forces. After the defection of Greece, the Bulgarian forces stopped the Franco-British relief force in the Vardar Valley, the Serbs found themselves swept together in the plain of Kosovo by the converging Austro-Hungarian, German, and Bulgarian columns.[5]\n\nTo escape the invaders' encirclement, on November 23, 1915, the government and supreme command made the joint decision to retreat across the mountains of Montenegro and Albania. The objective was to reach the Adriatic coast, where they would reorganise and reequip the Serbian Army with assistance from the Allies. The Serbs then retreated across the mountains in three columns; the retreat took the remnants of the army, the King, hundreds of thousands of civilian refugees, and war prisoners. Between November 1915 and January 1916, during the journey across the mountains, 77,455 soldiers and 160,000 civilians froze, starved to death, died of disease, or were killed by enemy raids. Austrian pilots used the new technology of the time, dropping bombs on the retreating columns in what has been called 'the first aerial bombardment of civilians.'\n\nOut of the 400,000 people who set out on the journey, only 120,000 soldiers and 60,000 civilians reached the Adriatic coast to be evacuated by Allied ships to the island of Corfu, where a Serbian government-in-exile headed by Prince-Regent Alexander and Nikola Pašić was established. Another 11,000 Serbs would later die of disease, malnutrition, or exposure sustained during the retreat. In some sources published following the conflict, the event was described as the greatest and most tragic episode of the Great War.[7]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nSerbian campaigns\n\n[edit]\n\n1914\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Serbian campaign (1914)\n\nOn July 28, 1914, a month after the assassination of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, Austria-Hungary, the second-largest country in Europe, declared war on Serbia marking the beginning of World War I. The campaign represented the first significant military engagement between the Central Powers, mainly Austro-Hungary, and the Allied Powers, led by the Kingdom of Serbia. The campaign began in the night of 28-29 July with Austria-Hungary bombarding Belgrade. On 12 August, the Austro-Hungarian forces, under General Oskar Potiorek, initiated their first offensive into Serbia when the Balkanstreitkräfte, consisting of the 5th Army and 6th Army, attacked Serbia from the west and north.[8]\n\nDespite initial setbacks, the Serbs, under General Radomir Putnik's command, used the terrain and strategic advantages to secure a decisive victory at the Battle of Cer. The blow to Habsburg prestige was incalculable, with Serbia marking the first Allied victory of World War I as all Austro-Hungarian forces were repelled out of Serbia. Following the initial failure, Austria-Hungary regrouped and launched a second invasion in September 1914. The Battle of the Drina saw the Serbs pushing the 5th Army back into Bosnia, forcing the remnants of the Balkanstreitkräfte to retreat in late September.[9] A third invasion launched in October 1914, resulted in the capture of Belgrade on 2 December 1914 before a successful Serbian counter-offensive at the Battle of Kolubara expelled the Central Powers forces from Serbia before the end of the month, concluding the campaign.[10] After being humiliated by \"the peasant regiments of a small Balkan kingdom\",[11] the blow to Habsburg prestige was \"incalculable\" and Franz Ferdinand's avenging remained unfulfilled.[12] The Serbian Campaign of 1914 concluded within the year and General Potiorek was relieved of command.[10]\n\n1915\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Serbian campaign (1915)\n\nIn early 1915, the German chief of the general staff von Falkenhayn convinced the Austro-Hungarian chief of staff von Hoetzendorf to launch a new invasion of Serbia. In September Bulgaria signed a treaty of alliance with Germany and quickly mobilized its army.[13] On 6 October 1915, combined German and Austro-Hungarian forces under the command of Field Marshall August von Mackensen attacked Serbia from the north and west with the intention of drawing the bulk of the Serbian forces along the Sava and Danube.[14]\n\nOn 11 October, without a previous declaration of war, the Bulgarians started making attacks on Serbian border positions. On 14 October Bulgaria finally declared war on Serbia and the First and Second Armies, under the command of General Boyadzhiev, advanced into the Timok region of northeastern Serbia[15] with the mission of cutting the vital rail line that ran from Salonika up the Vardar and Morava River valleys, and depriving Serbia of reinforcements and artillery ammunition.[16] Numbering nearly 300,000 men, the forces of Bulgaria quickly overwhelmed the weak Serbian units along the frontier.[15] The Serbian Army had 250,000 men of which a large number were already battling 300,000 Germans and Austrians in the north. In addition, Austrian troops soon started marching from Dalmatia.[17]\n\nFacing a front of 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) against three armies and as promises of aid and reinforcements from the Allies fell through, the Supreme Command of the Serbian Army started an organized retreat towards Kragujevac and Niš.[17] On 6 November the Bulgarian First Army made contact with General Gallwitz's Eleventh German Army in the vicinity of Niš; on 10 November they crossed the Morava River about 18 miles (29 km) south of Niš and struck the Serbs. For two days, the greatly outnumbered Serbian army held Prokuplje but eventually had to retreat.[14] The pressure of the Austro-Hungarians, the Germans, and the Bulgarian First Army in the north and the Bulgarian Second Army advancing from the east forced the Serbs to retreat in a southwesterly direction into Kosovo.\n\nPrelude\n\n[edit]\n\nKosovo offensive, 10 – 24 November\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kosovo Offensive (1915)\n\nIn mid-November, the Serbian armies reached Pristina ahead of their pursuers, but were unable to break south through the blockade of the Bulgarian Second Army at Kačanik Pass near Skopje, to reach Salonika and establish the liaison with the French troops of General Sarrail.[14] The goal of Mackensen was to corner the Serbs in the Kosovo area and force them to fight a decisive final battle.[19]\n\nThe rupture of communications between Niš-Skopje-Salonika and the rupture of the liaison with the Allies brought the army into a most critical situation. Field Marshal Putnik began concentrating his troops for the purpose of securing access to the plateau of Gnjilane known as the \"Field of Blackbirds\".[3]\n\nThe Austrian Luftfahrtruppen, that until then provided air support to the Austro-Hungarian army and communications between the German Eleventh and Bulgarian First Armies, started using reconnaissance aircraft to carry out bombing missions across the plain of Kosovo, striking the columns of refugees and blurring the lines between combatants and noncombatants in what has been called \"the first-ever aerial bombardment of civilians\". Albanians hostile to Serbs mounted guerrilla actions picking off weak detachments, acting in revenge for the repression they endured following the transfer of the province from Ottoman to Serbian and Montenegrin territory two years earlier.[22]\n\nThe entire Bulgarian army, supported from the north by parts of the Eleventh German Army, now advanced against the Serbs. Following intense fighting on 23 November, Pristina and Mitrovica fell to the Central Powers and the Serbian government abandoned Prizren, its last temporary capital in Serbia.[24]\n\nOnly three possibilities were considered: capitulation and separate peace, a final honourable-but-desperate battle of annihilation, or further retreat. Only retreating and counterattacking were seriously considered, while capitulation was not an option on the table; the only possible avenue of escape lay to the southwest and northwest, over the towering Korab and Prokletije mountain ranges of Albania and Montenegro, part of the Dinaric Alps, a region with an altitude of over 6,000 feet (1,800 m) as the snow was beginning to fall. The Serbian government led by Prime Minister Nikola Pašić, Prince Regent Alexander and the Supreme Command under Field Marshall Radomir Putnik made the decision to order a general withdrawal and fight on from exile, planning to reorganise and reform the army with the help and support from the Allies.[17]\n\nOrder of retreat, 25 November\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 23 November, Vojvoda Putnik ordered all Serbian forces to use the last of the artillery ammunition and then bury the cannons, taking the breechblocks and sights with them; if burying the guns was impossible, they were to be rendered useless.[16] Putnik also ordered that, to save them from being captured by the enemy, every boy near military age, from twelve to eighteen years old, 36 000 in total, was to follow the army and join the retreat with the goal of saving the country's manhood and raising soldiers for the future front. On 25 November 1915, an official order of retreat addressed to the commanders of all armies, was published by the Serbian High Command:[26]\n\nThe only way out of this grave situation is a retreat to the Adriatic coast. There our army will be reorganised, furnished with food, arms, munitions, clothing, and all other necessities which our allies will send us, and we shall again be a fact with which our allies must reckon. The nation has not lost its being, it will continue to exist even though on foreign soil, so long as the ruler, the government and the army are there, no matter what the strength of the army may be.\n\n— Serbian High Command, 25 November 1915, [26]\n\nRetreat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Serbian Army split into three columns heading towards the mountains of Albania and Montenegro, pursued by the Austro-Hungarian Tenth Mountain Brigade and by the German Alpine Corps.[14] The army's rock-bottom morale was boosted by the presence of the ailing, 71-year-old King Peter I, who had stepped aside on June 14 to let his son Prince Alexander rule as Regent but now resumed his throne to face the crisis with his people. The elderly monarch, who was almost blind, travelled through the mountains riding in an ox cart.[27] To evade General Mackensen's final encirclement effort, the Serbian army, and a mass of civilians fleeing the massacres perpetrated by Austro-Hungarian troops,[28] retreated along three routes, all converged on Lake Scutari, on the border of Albania and Montenegro, and from there headed towards the Adriatic.[29]\n\nUpon reaching Albania Essad Pasha Toptani, an Albanian leader and former Ottoman General, who was a Serb ally and the one central authority left in Albania, provided protection where this was possible.[30] Where he was in control, his gendarmes gave support to retreating Serbian troops, but as the columns moved to territories in the north, attacks by Albanian tribesmen and irregulars became commonplace.[31] The Serb-Montenegrin troops' brutal actions in the First Balkan War, made many of the locals ready to take their revenge on the soldiers retreating through the mountain passes, continuing the cycle of revenge with killing and looting.\n\nRetreating columns\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern columns\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Northern column, composed of the First, Second and Third Army and the troops of the defence of Belgrade, took the route across southern Montenegro, from Peć to Scutari (Shkodër), via Rožaje, Andrijevica and Podgorica.[19][33]\n\nIt contained the largest contingent of Serbian troops and it also included a mobile medical unit The first Serbian-English Field Hospital, with two doctors, six nurses and six ambulance drivers. The unit was headed by British nurse and commissioned major, Mabel Stobart.[34] The retreat of this force to Andrijevica was to take place under the direction of the First Army, which was to occupy positions at Rožaje. Members of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service in Serbia also evacuated following this route, at times alongside the army.[35]\n\nThe mission of the troops of the defence of Belgrade was to cover the retreat of the Army of the Timok as long as that army had not begun its movement of retreat, and then to retire in its turn.[7] Because of this, the northern column delayed its departure from Peć until 7 December. It also had the responsibility to act as a rearguard against an attack by the Austro-Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Germans. Tracing an arc from northwest to southwest through Montenegrin territory and skirting the northern border of Albania through the snow-covered mountains, hunger, exposure, and disease killed soldiers and civilians, as well as prisoners of war travelling with them, by the thousands.[36]\n\nThe northern column began to reach Scutari on 15 December. Serbian officers and artillery crews in Montenegro handed over 30 cannons to the Montenegrin Army,[16] Montenegrin forces played a key role in covering up the withdrawal, most notably against Austro-Hungarian forces in the Battle of Mojkovac.[37]\n\nCentral columns\n\n[edit]\n\nThe central column consisted of King Peter I, the court, the government and the General Staff took the route through central Kosovo across northern Albania, from Prizren to Shkodër via Lum and Pukë.[38]\n\nOnce across the Vizier's Bridge on the Drin River, the troops, who had retreated from Macedonia, continued west through Albania, ultimately to Lezhë. The Timok Division also continued to move south and then west through Albania to Durrës. It had the shortest route to the sea but encountered some resistance from hostile Albanians.[39]\n\nRegent Alexander crossed it in just two and a half days and the Serbian government set off on 24 November, reaching Shkodër/Scutari four days later. The officers of the Supreme Command who accompanied the Chief of the General Staff Radomir Putnik took longer, leaving on 26 November and arriving in Shkodër on 6 December.[37]\n\nSouthern columns\n\n[edit]\n\nThe southern column followed the third route of withdrawal, from Prizren to Lumë and further through the Albanian mountains to Debar and Struga.[39]\n\nThe southern column was the first to depart and the last to arrive at the coast. The southern route presented the most direct way to make contact with Sarrail's Army of the Orient. The General Headquarters had asked the commanders of these groups to keep in constant telegraphic communication, but from the first day of the operations this was found to be impossible. The geography of the country did not allow of any other means of communication, so that the commanders of these groups were left to their own devices during the whole movement.[40]\n\nAll the troops part of this group were placed under the orders of the commander of the Army of the Timok.[7] The column left on 25 November and moved south all the way to Elbasan. Along the way it had to contend with Albanian resistance and Bulgarian attacks; on 10 December, the Bulgarians attacked Serbian positions along the crest of the Jablanica mountain range.[41] As the Bulgarians again reached Struga before them, Serbian soldiers and civilians turned southwesterly, marching down the Albanian coast to Valona and across via Tirana reaching Durrës on 21 December.[40]\n\nAlbanian coast\n\n[edit]\n\nAs early as 20 November, Pašić sent an urgent message to Serbia's allies, asking for supplies, particularly food, to be sent to the Adriatic ports. When the Northern and Central columns arrived in Shkodër, they found the harbour empty of the foreign ships they had expected and hoped for. Learning that some supplies had come ashore in Durrës, 60 kilometres (37 mi) away, the columns of troops and refugees were sent further south.[15]\n\nFood was dispatched from France and Britain but it was still in Brindisi, Italy, the chosen port for the shipment of materials. Due to the presence of Austrian naval forces in the Adriatic, and after a convoy sent to Skadar earlier was destroyed by the Austro-Hungarian navy,[15] the Italians had only sent a few vessels.[15] On 22 November Austrian destroyers sank the Italian steamers Palatino and Gallinara, which were sailing from Brindisi to Saint Giovanni di Medua and Durrës on the Albanian coast, while the Unione another Italian vessel transporting supplies was forced to scuttle after being attacked by a submarine.\n\nOn 5 December the Italian steamer Benedetto Giovanni, alongside the Greek steamer Thira, was sank near Saint Giovanni di Medua by an Austrian cruiser. On 8 and 9 January two more Italian ships Brindisi and Città di Palermo were sunk by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Eventually, a decision was made to evacuate the Serbian Army, and its accompanying civilians, to the French-occupied Greek island of Corfu and as far as Bizerte in French Tunisia.[44] This decision, made primarily by the French did not involve any discussions with the Greek authorities.[15] The refugees were to be transported from Durrës and Saint Giovanni di Medua to Vlora where they would board three large French ships and another one provided by the Italian Royal Navy and transported to the Tunisian port of Bizerte. On 11 January 1916 French soldiers, later joined by Italian and British, started the occupation of Corfu, in preparation for the arrival of the Serbian troops.\n\nEvacuation, 15 January – 5 April 1916\n\n[edit]\n\nThe evacuation started on 15 January; the journey was made from three ports, San Giovanni di Medua, Durrës and Valona (Vlorë).[47] Altogether, 45 Italian, 25 French and eleven British transport ships were employed in the evacuation; they carried out 202, 101 and 19 voyages, respectively.[48] The Duke of Abruzzi and Vice Admiral Emanuele Cutinelli Rendina, commander of Italian naval forces in the southern Adriatic (with headquarters in Brindisi), were tasked with planning the evacuation by sea; it was established that larger ships would load the troops in Durres and Vlore, whereas smaller vessels would be employed in San Giovanni di Medua. Rear Admiral Guglielmo Capomazza supervised the evacuation in Vlorë, Albania.[48]\n\nOn 14 January the Serbian government, ministers, and the members of the diplomatic corps boarded an Italian ship, the Citta di Bari, for Brindisi.[49] On 6 February the Serbian supreme command and Regent Alexander were evacuated to Corfu, where around 120,000 evacuees had arrived by 15 February, and around 135,000 ten days later. Up to 10,000 evacuees were taken to Bizerta around the same time. The sick were transported to the Greek island of Vido, to prevent epidemics. The Italians took over the majority of Habsburg prisoners, and transferred them to the uninhabited island of Asinara (off the coast of Sardinia). Nearly 5,000 refugees, mostly women, children, and elderly people were taken to Corsica accompanied by the Serbian Relief Fund and the Scottish Women's military hospital.\n\nMost of the Serbian troops had been evacuated by 19 February. On 23 February 1916, the transfer of the infantry was completed including 6,000 Montenegrin soldiers who had joined them. The cavalry division who had started evacuating on 27 February 1916 but had to wait for better weather, was last to embark on 5 April 1916, which marked the end of the operation.[37] A total of 260,895 men were evacuated, including Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers and civilian refugees, the royal families, the Serbian government and members of delegations.\n\nAftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the official statistics from 1919, 77,455 Serbian soldiers died, while 77,278 went missing. The worst fate befell the Southern Column, where approximately 36,000 young boys, some who would have become conscripts in 1916, but some as young as twelve, had been ordered by the Army to join the retreat; within a month about 23,000 of them died.\n\nOf the estimated 220,000 civilian refugees who had set off for the Adriatic coast from Kosovo, only about 60,000 survived. Those who survived were so weak that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Because the rock composition of the island made it hard to dig graves, those who died on the journey were buried at sea. Bodies were lowered from French ships into the depths of the Ionian Sea, near the Greek island of Vido; more than 5,000 Serbs are believed to have been buried this way. The sea around Vido is known as \"The Blue Graveyard\" (Plava grobnica).[54]\n\nField Marshal Putnik travelled to France for medical treatment, where he died the following year.[55] Nearly 5,000 Serbian refugees, mostly women and children were sent to Corsica, evacuated from Albania, they were attended by the staff of the Scottish Women's military hospital who had travelled with them, an operation financed by the Serbian Relief Fund based in London. Many of the young boys who had survived the retreat were sent to France and Britain for schooling.\n\nOccupied Serbia\n\n[edit]\n\nSerbia was divided into separate Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian military occupation zones. In the Austro-Hungarian zone of occupation (northern and central Serbia), the Military General Governorate of Serbia was established with its center in Belgrade. In the territory occupied by the Bulgarians, a military government was set up with its center in Niš, the area was divided into two administrative zones. Both the Austrian and the Bulgarian occupation regimes were very harsh, the population was exposed to various measures of repression, including mass internment, forced labour, concentration camps for political opponents, starvation, Denationalization and Bulgarisation policy.\n\nKosovo was divided into two Austro-Hungarian occupational zones: Metohija entered the Austro-Hungarian Military Government of Montenegro, while a smaller part of Kosovo with Mitrovica and Vucitrn became part of the Austro-Hungarian Military Government of Serbia. The greater part of Kosovo – Pristina, Prizren, Gnjilane, Urosevac, Orahovac was included in the Bulgarian Military Region of Macedonia.\n\nSalonika front\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 1916, more than 110,000 Serbian troops were transferred to Salonika, where they joined the Allied army after Greece entered the war; some six Serbian infantry divisions and one cavalry division, named after regions and rivers in their homeland would eventually return to serve, playing a key role in the breakthrough of the Macedonian Front in September 1917, and the liberation of their homeland a year later.[2]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe great retreat is considered by Serbs to be one of the greatest tragedies in their nation's history.[7] It is remembered, using biblical symbolism, as the Albanian Golgotha, a sacred sacrifice followed by the national 'resurrection' of Serbia's victory at the end of the war.\n\nImages\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCommemorative Medal of the Great Serbian Retreat\n\nGde Cveta Limun Žut, (2006).
