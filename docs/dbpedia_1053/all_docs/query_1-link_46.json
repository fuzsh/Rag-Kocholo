You just don’t see that here in the same way, people are very isolated from each other. They work and they go home and just watch television in the evening.”\n\n00:02:20 (Boris VO) (Various private archive shoots, all in Serbian language)\n\nWe liked to watch TV as well and even had a camcorder, which I, being the cinematically gifted child that I was, always tried to get my hands on.\n\n00:02:27 (VV)\n\n Boris as a kid saying “Come here, dad!”\n\n00:02:31 (VV)\n\nWhat I really wanted was the camera he was holding.

Communism?\n\n00:03:53 (VV) (BW footage of an old American Anti Communism movie)\n\n US educational program: “It’s an international criminal conspiracy!”\n\n00:03:57 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the old Yugoslavia period)\n\nWell, for two decades prior to 1980 Yugoslavia was prospering with its annual GDP growth averaging 6.1 percent.\n\n00:04:05 (VO) (Various footage from old Yugoslavia)\n\n Michael Parenti: “A decent standard of living, free medical care and education, guaranteed right to a job, […] affordable public transportation and housing and utilities, literacy rate over 90%, life expectancy was 72 years. Most of the economy was in the public, not for profit sector.”\n\n00:04:25 (VV) (clip the popular Yugoslavia comedy drama) (Serbian)\n\n Yugoslav song: “Nobody has it better than us, may it be like this every day!”\n\n00:04:30 (VV)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “Yugoslavia was a different case because it had established it’s own form of a socialist model\n\n00:04:37 (VO) (Various Yugoslavia period archive shoots)\n\nof economic activity, which was a mixed economy with private capitalist enterprise, with state-run industry and with worker cooperatives. And the worker cooperatives were extremely successful or sometimes the only game in town.”\n\n00:04:47 (VO) (Various Yugoslavia period archive shoots)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “It was considered to be a success story of market socialism. It had higher rates of growth than most of the countries of Western Europe, it had an advance welfare state, [...] it was a multiethnic society which lived in harmony, and in many regards it was a model of development.”\n\n00:05:12 (Boris VO) (Various Yugoslavia period archive shoots)\n\nI guess you could say there really is something special about this land. So, why have people spilt so much blood over this land? Who was to blame here?\n\n00:05:21 (VV) (Footage from the old Yugoslavia comedy movie) (Serbian)\n\n Ckalja: “Usually, the least suspicious one is guilty. That I know. I’ve read dozens of crime novels.”\n\n00:05:25 (Boris VO) (Various shoot from the old Yugoslavia)\n\nBefore I continue, where are we? Yugoslavia was located between Greece, Italy and Romania and it was populated by Serbs, Croats, Bosnian Muslims, Slovenes, Macedonians, all of which are Slavs, and Albanians, Hungarians and others. Their country was the result of a long fight to unite the people, to show the world what they can achieve if they work together, regardless of what happened in the past.\n\n00:05:48 (VO) (Music clip Lepa Brena, Zivela Yugoslavia) (Serbo-Croatian)\n\n00:06:22 (Boris VO) (Various footage from the old Yugoslavia)\n\nThroughout history, this idea has been a thorn in the eye of many Empires and world powers.\n\n00:06:27 (VO), (Various old archive shoots)\n\n Michael Parenti: “The idea was that the Southern Slavs would not remain weak, divided people falling out among themselves or falling prey to some imperialist outsider,\n\n00:06:37 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots)\n\nSerbs lost their freedom after the Ottoman Turks attacked them in 1389 on the Field of Blackbirds, which is called Kosovo.\n\n00:06:45 (VV)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “With the Serbs, the loss of statehood that lasted several centuries, for instance, produced a strong anchorage in the myth of Kosovo.”\n\n00:06:54 (VV) (VO with various pictures of the Kosovo and other famous historic battles)\n\n John Bosnitch: “Journalists come to Serbia and say: “Why are you Serbs so darn crazy that you celebrate a battle that you lost? When you talk about the Battle of Kosovo. And you always talk about a battle and how great it was, but you lost. Aren’t you guys masochistic? Isn’t there something wrong with you?” And I said: “Ever heard of the Alamo?” Remember the Alamo? Ever heard of Masada? In which the Jews defended to the death and then committed suicide, rather then to be captured.”\n\n00:07:29 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots)\n\nFor standing up against the Turks, Serbs were persecuted and inventive torture devices were implemented.\n\n00:07:34 (VV) (Various archive shoots)\n\n John Bosnitch: “We lived under terrible persecution. We were whipped, we were lynched, except the manner in which we were lynched was by impalement. We were impaled. If you don’t know what impalement means, impalement means a sharppened stick is put up your anus, driven through your body and exits through your back without going through your vital organs. They were experts, Turkish Ottoman experts who did that. So, you were impaled, like Christ was put on the cross, to suffer.”\n\n00:08:15 (Boris VO) (Footage from old Yugoslavia films and archives)\n\nThere was, however, a way to avoid all this - Convert to Islam! And many did, many had no choice. This made a part of the Slavic population Muslim while the rest was Christian Orthodox. On the other hand, the State Religion of the Austrian Empire was Roman Catholic, with a large Croatian population greatly influenced by this.\n\n00:08:35 (Boris VO) (Various shoots, BW shoots and pictures)\n\nWhen the Austrians illegally took over Bosnia and it’s large Yugoslav population in 1908, the Yugoslav dream had never been more threatened. So, a group of Yugoslav nationalists, “Young Bosnia” which included Serbs, Muslims and Croats, decided that ‘enough was enough’. A young man, perhaps you’ve heard of him, Gavrilo Princip, shot and killed the Austrian archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Afterwards he was quoted as saying:\n\n00:09:01 (Boris VO) (Newspaper animation)\n\n“I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, we must be free from Austria!”\n\n00:09:08 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nAlthough the assassination of their archduke did kinda make the Austrians mad and heck, now they had a reason to attack the last Slavic stronghold – Serbia. This was, however, not the real reason for the attack – the Austrians and Germans had a plan to expand their Empire to the East. War was the only way they’d achieve this.\n\n00:09:31 (Boris VO) (Various BW archive footage)\n\nDuring the early period of World War I, a bunch of Yugoslav politicians fled the Habsburg Empire and formed the Yugoslav Committee in London to raise funds and realize the Yugoslav dream.\n\nTowards the end of the war, the Committee met up in Corfu, Greece, with the Serbian government and declared that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were \"the same by blood, by language, by the feelings of their unity, by the continuity and integrity of the territory which they inhabit undividedly, and by the common vital interests of their national survival and manifold development of their moral and material life”…\n\n00:10:14 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nIt was what the Austrians and Ottomans had feared – Yugoslav unity! The Old World Order was gone – Yugoslavs finally got a country of their own!\n\n00:10:15 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was, sadly, short lived, because another war was brewing soon, the likes of which the world has never seen. In hopes of keeping Yugoslavia out of the war Yugoslav Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Treaty with Nazi Germany in 1941. But the British didn’t like this, so they encouraged a coup d’etat and mass rebelion against the pact. The British were happy, but now Hitler wasn’t. In fact, he was so angry that he wanted to wipe Yugoslavia off the map. Yugoslavia was attacked from all sides.\n\n00:10:46 (VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “Yugoslavia at that time was divided up into 12 pieces and some of it went to fascist Hungary, some of it went to fascist Italy. Macedonia went to the Bulgarians and the Albanians, […] Serbia was occupied by the Wermacht and ruled by the Germans. Croatia and Bosnia were united into a Croatian fascist state under the Ustashe regime.”\n\n00:11:10 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nThis was called the Independent State of Croatia.\n\n00:11:13 (VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “The idea, of course, in 1941 was that Croatia would be a kind of condominium for German power in the Balkans.”\n\n00:11:20 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nThe Croatian fascists were quick to start eradicating all non-Croatian elements in the state. You know what that meant? Serb hunting season started!\n\n00:11:28 (Old Ustasha song) (Croatian)\n\n00:11:35 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nYes, Hitler’s final solution was applied here as well, and hundreds of thousands of Serbs but also Jews, Roma and others were killed, most of them at the 4th largest concentration camp in Europe – Jasenovac.\n\n00:11:47 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “A total number of 600,000 were killed at Jasenovac.”\n\n00:11:54 (VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “The Croatian fascist regime, the Ustasha regime, […] had one aspect that was very distinctly different, and that was that it was a clerical fascist regime. It integrated into its political dictatorship the Catholic clergy. […] They were at the top of the government, in the leading councils of government, and they were also in the military and they were in the concentration camps. They were at Jasenovac. Some of the actual camp directors were priests.”\n\n00:12:27 (VV and VO, various shoots from the archives)\n\n John Bosnitch: “The Croatian inquisition, which took place in World War II, makes the Spanish inquisition just look like child’s play.”\n\n00:12:35 (VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “Pope Pius supported this fascist regime, the top leadership of the Vatican was fully cognecent of what was going on there.”\n\n00:12:42 (Boris VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nOn the other hand, Royalists loyal to the crown, called Chetniks, decided to act.\n\n00:12:47 (VO) (Various BW shoots from the archives)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “The Chetniks were the resistance movement which even though proclaimed itself\n\n00:12:54 (VV)\n\nThe Royal Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland was composed almost exclusively of the Serbs. However, after the bloody German reprisals in Serbia in the fall of 1941, the Chetniks realized that continuing resistance at any cost, when the Germans were killing […] 100 Serbs for a single dead German, was self defeating and suicidal.”\n\n00:13:19 (Boris VO) And various BW shoots from the archives)\n\nThis didn’t matter to the West though.. they just wanted dead German bodies. So, all aid to the Chetniks was cut and shifted towards another group of fighters who managed to neutralize all other groups. The Yugoslav Partisans! The communists, made up of members of all ethnicities, were lead by a guy called Tito. In 1943, Tito declared the new Yugoslavia which was finally liberated two years later. Tito, if nothing else, was brilliant at playing political games with big powers for his own interest, which is just what Yugoslavia needed to gain complete independence. It’s important to say that Tito wasn’t just a leader, he was a brand, recognized in the world.\n\n00:14:03 (Boris VO) (Various shoot from the archives)\n\nHe was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned movement. And why were they so important?\n\n00:14:07 (VO) (Various shoot from the archives)\n\n Sunil Ram: “They were able to play a middle ground for the great powers that allowed the great powers to potentially talk to each other and discuss certain issues that could not be talked about openly.” (Sunil Ram interview, 07:02 min)\n\n00:14:20 (VO, Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\n TV announcer: “He hopes to [...] perform the difficult feet of walking both sides of the street – East and West!”\n\n00:14:27 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\nTito’s strong arm kept the country together. When he died on May 4, 1980, many in Yugoslavia were crying… maybe not so much for him as much they were crying for Yugoslavia itself.\n\n00:14:45 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\nHis funeral was the largest funeral for a statesman in recorded history.\n\n00:14:59 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\nThen things started to fall apart when Yugoslavia began to get into debt to international creditors shortly after Tito’s death. In 1984, while the eyes of the world were pointed at Sarajevo where the Winter Olympic Games were being held the Reagan administration was specifically targeting the Yugoslav economy in a secret memo, National Security Decisions Directive 133, which stated that: “U.S. policy will be to promote the trend toward a market-oriented Yugoslav economy”. And it was in line with previous decisions directives which advocated expanded efforts to promote a quiet revolution to overthrow Communist governments and parties.\n\n00:15:34 (VV) (Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “It triggers a whole series of other initiatives, most of which are not published. The Decisions Directive [...] simply states that what the US would want to achieve is that Yugoslavia ceases to be a market socialist economy and becomes a free market economy, modelled on the West.”\n\n00:15:59 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives and animation)\n\nAnd we know today what means the U.S. used to impose their will on Yugoslavia, years before any conflicts began. As the Soviet system was on its last legs in 1988, Washington wasted no time in sending advisers to Yugoslavia from a non-profit organization with a high-sounding name, the National Endowment for Democracy, or NED.\n\n00:16:11 (VV) (Presidental talk)\n\n Ronald Reagan: “Good morning and welcome. It’s good to have you all here to celebrate the launching of a program with a vision and a noble purpose, the establishment of the National Endowment goes right to the heart of America’s faith in democratic ideals and institutions.\n\n00:16:27 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives and newspaper animation)\n\nHowever, Allen Weinstein, who planned the NED told the Washington Post in 1991 that: \"a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.\" This basically means that the NED was really a sort of CIA spinoff.\n\n00:16:41 (VO) (Various shoots from the movie archives)\n\n Philip Agee: “Instead of having just the CIA going behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process by inserting money here\n\n00:16:49 (VV) (Part of interview with Philip Agee)\n\nand instructions there and so forth… They have, now, a sidekick – which is this National Endowment for Democracy. NED.”\n\n00:16:56 (Boris VO) (Various shoots from the movie and TV archives)\n\nThus the NED started handing out generous bribes in every corner of Yugoslavia, financing opposition groups, buying up hungry young journalists with dreams of a new life, and financing trade union opposition, pro-IMF economists and human rights NGOs.\n\n00:17:09 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots, author shoots and animations)\n\nThe National Endowment for Democracy also controls and pays for the Center for International Private Enterprise which in turn funded the G-17. Who were the G-17? They were an NGO made up of 17 free market economists, with three of the leading members being Washington-based staff members of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - Dusan Vujovic, Zeliko Bogetic and Branko Milanovic.\n\nG-17 coordinator Professor Veselin Vukotic worked closely with the World Bank, and, as the Minister of Privatization under Yugoslav Premier Ante Markovic, he was in charge of the World Bank \"bankruptcy program\" in Yugoslavia during 1989-1990, which led to the devastation of the Yugoslav economy.\n\n00:17:50 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots, WOC purpose shoots and animations)\n\nOther members of the G-17 consult for the World Bank and attend World Bank-organized meetings. In 2002, they formed a political party in Serbia, and since then, despite the fact that in every election they’ve gotten between 7% and 11% of the popular vote, G-17 controlled the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy of Serbia.\n\nThis is not simply a group of economists. It is a network. The IMF and World Bank use this network to impose their policies on Yugoslavia. And how do they do it?\n\nFirst, they force governments to do away with any social protections - subsidized food or rent, free transportation, free medical care. You know… all those things you don’t really need. Out the window.\n\n00:18:30 (VV) (Various archive shoots, author shoots and animations)\n\n Michael Parenti: “You cut back public sector spending, you cut wages, you cut employment, you abolish worker management enterprise, in other words, you force your people to work harder for less.”\n\n00:18:41 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots, author shoots and animations)\n\nSecond, they use economic manipulation and new laws to force businesses - public and private - into bankruptcy.\n\n00:18:49 (VV)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “The World Bank describes this mechanism as a “trigger” mechanism, they use that term. They say we need to trigger the bankruptcy of Yugoslav industry.”\n\n00:19:02 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots, author shoots and animations)\n\nThen these businesses are taken over by a small clique of leveraged buyout speculators and other powerful foreign economic interests. They purchase the businesses at rock bottom prices.\n\n00:19:12 (VV) (Various archive shoots, author shoots and animations)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “Creditors could simply take hold of these enterprises within a 45 day period and either the enterprise had to close down or it was privatized.”\n\n00:19:25 (Boris VO) (Various archive shoots and purpose shoots)\n\nThis is called \"Privatization through Liquidation\" and it is standard practice in the Balkans and Eastern Europe and this is exactly what happened to Yugoslavia. World Bank data confirms that under Vukotic’s direction from January 1989 to September 1990, more than 1100 industrial firms were wiped out. The standard of living declined 18% between January and October 1990. This downturn raised unemployment to 20 percent and thus increased tensions between the republics.\n\n00:19:49 (VV) (Various archive shoots)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “Impoverish the population through these sweeping IMF reforms, which in turn contributed to heightening social and ethnic strife.”\n\n00:20:01 (VV) (Serbian Language)\n\n Slobodan Drakulic: “So you had dissatisfaction of everybody and everybody’s looking for a guilty party.”\n\n00:20:06 (VV) (Serbian Language)\n\n Branislav Lecic: “When a man has nothing and he’s not aware in the egistential sense,\n\n00:20:11 (VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nhe clings to those types of ideas that awaken the human inside him, and those are usually national or religious stories. Suddenly, he feels more important when someone tells him – Yes, it’s their fault, not yours. By believing that you’re bigger than others, your ego and libido goes up.”\n\n00:20:26 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nIn desparation, Prime Minister Markovic visited Washington to meet with President George H. Bush. He said that rising tensions among nationalities would be a consequence of his austerity/privatization plan, so he asked for a billion dollars in aid, and said that, if aid didn’t come, there would be trouble.\n\n00:20:43 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nAnd we all know the Americans didn’t want any trouble.\n\n00:20:46 (VO, VV, various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\n Michael Parenti: “In November of 1990 […] President George Bush went to the U.S. Congress and pressured them to pass the Foreign Appropriations Law that called for the cutting off of all aid and credits to Yugoslavia. The law also demanded that if any republic in Yugoslavia wanted further U.S. aid, it would have to break away from Yugoslavia and declare its independence. OK? It’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s not my speculation, it’s not my analysis, it’s a public law! It’s a public law! [...] It required the U.S. State Department approval of election procedures and results in every one of the republics! It required that the republics not hold national elections, but hold elections only in their own republics. And that the aid would only go individually to these republics, and when the aid did go, it went to those groups which the U.S. defined as “democratic” groups, which meant small, right-wing, ultranationalist and even fascistic parties.”\n\n00:21:48 (VO, various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “This fracturing of Yugoslavia was not the result of pre-existing internal divisions. Those internal divisions were heightened as a result of an outside intervention.”\n\n00:22:03 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nBy 1991, the inflation was 200% and the Yugoslav federal government was unable to pay the enormous interest on its foreign debt or even to arrange the purchase of raw materials for its industry. Credit collapsed and recriminations broke out on all sides. Cooperation between the republics and the Belgrade central government virtually ceased.\n\n00:22:23 (VO) (various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “The republics were not getting any money from the federal government, they weren’t transferring any tax revenues, so the whole federal fiscal structure had collapsed and the republics were left to their own devices and then came in the new form of nationalism.”\n\n00:22:40 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nAs the Americans demanded, multi-party elections were held and economic policy was at the center of the political debate as nationalist and separatist coalitions ousted the Communists in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia. And with the republics at one another's' throats, both the economy and the nation itself embarked on a vicious downward spiral.\n\n00:23:00 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nOf course, the local political figures did their best to calm the people down.\n\n00:23:06 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Vojislav Seselj: “We shall avenge Serb blood.”\n\n00:23:09 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Vlade Gotovac: “The Serbs will die in the havoc of their dead heart!”\n\n00:23:13 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Radovan Karadzic: “Don’t think that you won’t take Bosnia and Herzegovina to hell and the Muslim people perhaps to annihilation!”\n\n00:23:19 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nThe people needed a hero to save them, someone with their interest at heart. Instead, they got these guys. In 1991, elections were held in the Bosnian republic of Yugoslavia. Alija Izetbegovic, a former Nazi collaborator in World War II, was a candidate who had an Islamic vision for the mainly Christian Bosnia, as professed in this little book he wrote: “There can be neither peace nor coexistence between the Islamic religion and non-Islamic social and political institutions”. Alija lost the elections to the moderate Muslim leader Fikret Abdic. Losing the elections didn’t stop our Alija though, so he madea a deal with Fikret, where Alija would be President, but would quit a year. So, faster than you can say “Islamic Declaration”, Alija made sure his Presidency was extended due to the crisis, as you can’t have a power struggle in such tragic times. In fact, there was a moment when Alija could’ve prevented the war, when he signed the Lisbon Agreement in 1992, which would’ve made Bosnia a confederation of three regions. Alija didn’t like this, he wanted all the power. Luckily for him, the Americans didn’t like this peace idea either. So, the American ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, stepped in.\n\n00:24:30 (VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\n George Kenney: “So, my cabinet was in this meeting with Zimmerman and Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic had just come back from Lisbon […] and Zimmerman says to him: ‘Well, you know, you could get a lot more from U.S. recognition if you just waited.’ And my cabinet told me his jaw just hit the floor.” (George Kenney, 16:27 min)\n\n00:24:49 (Boris VO) (newspaper animation)\n\n “If you don’t like it, why sign it?”\n\n00:24:50 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nAlija took the American advice and withdrew his signature, fortified his power, and the Americans recognized it.\n\n00:24:58 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nAnother guy who just loved his power was the one, the only, Slobodan Milosevic! Slobo, as the masses liked to call him, knew how to use those masses to get what he wanted.\n\n00:25:10 (VO, various archive Film and TV shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Masses: “Slobo we love you!”, Slobo: “I love you too!”\n\n00:25:14 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nWith a little luck and help from his close friend Ivan, the President of Serbia, he got sent to Kosovo in 1987 where Serbs felt threatened by the Albanians. During a scuffle with the police, one Serb asked Slobo why the police were beating them. Slobo then rightfully proclaimed: “No one shall dare beat you”. He became an overnight star, as the protector of all Serbs! However, the incident with the police was fairly localized. This guy needed a bigger stage. So, because he was so thankful to his friend Ivan, he booted him from the Presidency. He also got him killed a decade later. You’d think that after Slobo became the new President of Serbia, he’d calm down, but no. He still needed a bigger stage,\n\n00:25:55 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots of battle of Kosovo anniversary)\n\nand what luck, a big anniversary was coming up. As Serbs were marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, which is the crux of their historical culture, waving Serbian, Yugoslav, American and, wow, Canadian flags, singing patriotic songs, Slobo took the stage and what the West described as a nationalist call to arms, inflamed the audience!\n\n00:26:17 (VV) (VO Milosevic speak with various archive film and TV shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Slobo: “Yugoslavia is a multiethnic society and its survival depends on the complete equality of all nations that live within it. The crisis that has struck Yugoslavia led to ethnic, but also social, cultural, religious, and many other less important divisions. The bridging between the differences will soften the effects of these rifts.”\n\n00:26:48 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nAlright, maybe it wasn’t that inflammatory, but at least the opera singers afterwards were pretty cool.\n\n00:26:56 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nBut if you think this guy had high ambitions, what about a guy being compared to Jesus Christ?\n\n00:27:00 (VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Announcing Franjo Tudjman: “On this day Christ triumphantly came to Jerusalem, greeted by the people as a messiah.

The saviour of the Croatian people, Franjo Tudjman. No pressure, eh?\n\n00:27:30 (Boris VO) (Various archive Film and TV shoots)\n\nNow, Franjo won the elections fair and square, but the people around him weren’t really good at hiding what was going to happen next.\n\n00:27:37 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Stipe Mesic: “There will be no war!”\n\nEven these guys aren’t buying it. Franjo’s government was quick to arm themselves, illegally.\n\n00:27:45 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Franjo: “We have not been arming ourselves!”\n\n00:27:48 (Boris VO)\n\nYeah right, what about this?\n\n00:27:50 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Martin Spegelj: “Right now, we have 80,000 of us armed with Kalashnikovs.”\n\n00:27:53 (Boris VO, various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nIt seemed like war was the only option. Thankfully, there were many citizens who just said “NO”.\n\n00:28:00 (VI) (Footage from the Belgrade peace rally)\n\n Belgrade peace rally: “All we are saying is give peace a chance!”\n\n00:28:10 (VV) (Bosnian)\n\n Raif Dizdarevic: ““We shall not go down the path of inter-ethnic quarrels”\n\n00:28:20 (Boris VO) (Various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nYugoslavs stood a lot to lose if Yugoslavia broke up. For 50 years, they grew up together, lived together, married each other and at the centre of all this was Bosnia, with a mixed population of Muslims, Serbs and Croats – a sort of mini-Yugoslavia in itself. Massive anti-war rallies were held in its capital Sarajevo, which had the largest number of ethnically mixed marriages, with a message to the politicians: “Don’t sacrifice peace for political ambition!” But with little higher interest in keeping Yugoslavia together, the politicians decided to send a message of their own to the demonstrators.\n\n00:29:05 (Boris VO) (Various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nSlovenia and Croatia were the first who decided that peaceful negotiations weren’t working out for them. So, they unilaterally declared independence in 1991.\n\n00:29:14 (VV) (Slovenian independence) (Slovenian)\n\n Slovenian Parliament: “We declare independence and state sovereignty.”\n\n00:29:22 (Boris VO, various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nBosnia followed in 1992. All of them were quickly recognized by the West.\n\n00:29:26 (VO, various film and TV archive shoots)\n\n George Kenney: “When the White House announced that we would be recognizing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, we at the State Department had no idea what that decision would be before it was announced, which is a very peculiar state of affairs. I was a desk officer, office director, nobody at the working level had any idea what the White House would decide. So, you can say just that the decision was a political one, it was not based on a careful consideration of what recognition might entail.”\n\n00:29:56 (Boris VO, various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nIt was, in essence, a dependable way of making conflict inevitable. The question was, would the people buy it?\n\n00:30:09 (Boris VO, various film and TV archive shoots)\n\nOf course, as history has shown, there was one surefire way to mobilize public opinion in favour of a conflict and bring them back to the WWII mentality where all Serbs became Chetniks and all Croats Ustashe.

When they did start, the role of the media was to further homogenize, futher brutalize, to give people new motives to take part in the war and be on their worst behavior.”\n\n00:33:00 (VV) (Various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Woman on TV: “Well, when I watch television and see what’s really going on, I want to help and our Serbia is worth sacrificing one’s life for.”\n\n00:33:06 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThere was no official military mobilization, it all worked on a voluntary basis.\n\n00:33:10 (VV, scene from a film “Tito i Ja”) (Serbian)\n\n Lazar Ristovski: “You.. and you. You two are volunteers.”\n\n00:33:17 (Boris VO, TV archive shoots)\n\nOne man, though, who could make a difference, realized where this madness was heading. His name was JOSIP KIR.\n\n00:33:24 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Jadranka Reihl-Kir: “My husband was the police chief of the Osijek-Baranja county in the Slavonian region of Croatia in 1991. Back then there was no Croatian Army, so all problems were being dealt with by the police.”\n\n00:33:46 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAs rebel Serbs had put up road blocks to control passages towards Serb-populated areas, Josip Kir, who was a Croat, decided to resolve these issues in a peaceful manner.\n\n00:33:56 (VV and various TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Jadranka Reihl-Kir: “Exclusively through negotiations, he was able to take down every single road block. My husband never differentiated people according to ethnicity – he believed that people are either good or bad. Apparently, that was his disadvantage. At the time, Franjo’s party, the HDZ, was in power, and extreme elements within the HDZ did not agree with Kir’s policies of peace.”\n\n00:34:24 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nKir was quickly becoming an obstacle to the aspirations of the Croatian HDZ and had to be taken out.\n\n00:34:30 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Jadranka Reihl-Kir: My husband was murdered by a Croatian HDZ member, Antun Gudelj. He pulled the trigger.”\n\n00:34:39 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nWho ordered the assassination, however, remains unresolved.\n\n00:34:43 (VV and various shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Jadranka Reihl-Kir: “On the day he was murdered, a newspaper came out with the headline – With Kir no more, Slavonia is at war.”\n\n00:34:52 (Boris VO, various shoots)\n\nYes, the war had started, best characterized by two words!\n\n00:35:01 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n “Ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing,...”\n\n00:35:02 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nEthnic cleansing. The term, however, was nothing new in the Balkans, as it was first used in WWII to describe how the Croatian Ustashe were cleansing Croatia of unwelcome ethnic elements such as Serbs and Jews. In the minds of Serbs during the 1990s, this was very much engraved in their national memory. Franjo didn’t care because he knew he had the support of just the right people. German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in almost daily contact with Zagreb, gave his go-ahead for Croatian secession and actually pressured its Western allies to recognize Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n00:35:35 (VV, scene from a film) (Serbian)\n\n Lazar Ristovski: “Who else would attack us Serbs other than the Germans! Don’t you ever get tired of that?”\n\n00:35:41 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “The German Serbophobia [...] it was geopolitical in the sense of 1914 and 1941. And that continuity also reflected itself in the almost visceral preference for the Croats and the Slovenes, who after all had belonged to the German cultural and state structures for hundreds of years.”\n\n00:36:04 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThere was, however, one problem in this plan. The Serbs – who were now a constitutional people of Croatia! That pretty much meant that no decisions about Croatia could be made without the Serbs, while Serbs and Croats had an equal status. Now, Serbs were facing increasing discrimination by the Croatian government.\n\n00:36:22 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Gregory Elich: “A lot of people were killed outright and threatened. People lost their jobs. It wasn’t just Serbs, even say Croatians who’s married partner was Serbian faced similar discrimination.”\n\n00:36:36 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nFranjo knew this all too well. So what did he do? He wrote a new Constitution.\n\n00:36:42 (VV, Milan Panic) (Serbian)\n\n Milan Panic: “The constitution says that Croatia is a country of Croats. That’s automatic ethnic cleansing. Constitutional.”\n\n00:36:49 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBy creating such a Croatian constitution, Franjo violated the Yugoslav constitution which he considered invalid, but he still wanted to keep the internal Yugoslav borders. The Serbs had a different idea.\n\n00:36:59 (various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Krajina rebellion: “This is Serbia!”\n\n00:37:02 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nWhat the Croatian Serbs wanted was to have control over the lands they populated, their own self-government, their schools, a right to preserve their language, culture and national identity. The Croats really wanted the same, feeling threatened by what was now being described by Zagreb as the Serbo-Yugoslav giant.\n\n00:37:18 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots and animation)\n\nThe Serbs thought, well, if Croats can separate from Yugoslavia, why can’t the Serbs separate from Croatia? After all, the same thing happened in America back during the Civil War. When Virginia seceded from the U.S., the northwestern part of the State seceded from Virginia to form West Virginia that was loyal to the Union.\n\n00:37:35 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Scott Taylor: “When I got there, when we inspected the lines these guys all told me their heroic stories of how they were just simple peasant Croats that had been, you know, patriots. And the JNA was this formidable fighting force they had overcome […] All the weapons that they had, they said that they had to capture from the JNA. Well, that might have worked on someone else. I looked around and I did my in-training, I mean, and I knew who made various Kalashnikovs. [...] Every single one of the weapons carried by these guys, everything from machine guns to sniper reiffles, was all made in East Germany.”\n\n00:38:11 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nEven though Croatia never officially admitted that Germany was arming them, they decided to thank the Germans with a song. In German, you know, so only the Germans would understand.\n\n00:38:19 (VV, Danke Deutschland) (Deutsch)\n\n Danke Deutschland by Sanja Trumbic: “Thank you Germany, my soul is burning. Thank you Germany, for this lovely gift”\n\n00:38:28 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Scott Taylor: “If you follow that bouncing ball, just recently, just last summer, Croatia donated surplus, 4 or 5 thousand Kalashnikovs to the Afghan National Army. Those aren’t surplus, what they’re doing is hiding essentially a murder weapon.”\n\n00:38:44 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe Serbs had more than enough weapons and they were too eager to crush the Croatian Army.\n\n00:38:49 (VV, Seselj) (Serbian)\n\n Vojislav Seselj: “As far as their army is concerned, 20, 30 Chetniks fixes everything.”\n\n00:39:02 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe Croatian town of Vukovar was under siege for 87 days, which later brought a phyric victory to the Serb forces. Why phyric? Well, because they actually destroyed the entire city!\n\n00:39:13 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Zeljko Sabo: “The whole world became aware of the tragedy of Vukovar. Over 4,000 people living in Vukovar perished.”\n\n00:39:22 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nA horrific example of how territory suddenly became more important than the people living on it.\n\n00:39:31 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nEven though they were brainwashed into thinking they were doing the right thing, some people woke up and realized what was really going on.\n\n00:39:39 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nMILAN LEVAR, a Croat who was determined to protect his town of Gospic from the Serbs, was among the first to join the newly established Croat Army, but quickly became disillusioned after an order he received.\n\n00:39:50 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Zeljko Peratovic: “Milan Levar was a Croatian defender who got tasks in 1991 to murder Serb civilians, which he saw as immoral and wrong, thus refusing to complete them.\n\n00:40:04 (VV, Levar’s Wife) (Croatian)\n\n Vesna Levar: “In June of 1992, my husband got out of the Army after his unwillingness to carry out orders of those who were in power here in Gospic.”\n\n00:40:17 (VV, TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Zeljko Peratovic: “He then alerted the proper authorities about the crimes being committed in Gospic. Since the authorities did nothing, in 1993 Levar resorted to public appearances, talking about the injustice against his fellow citizens, the Serbs of Gospic, but also some Croats who either didn’t agree with the policies of ethnic cleansing in Gospic, or simply were an obstacle to those in power at the time.” (Zeljko Peratovic)\n\n00:40:48 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nHis fight brought him all the way to the International Criminal Court where he testified. After that, however, extreme elements in Croatia decided to silence Milan Levar.\n\n00:40:59 (VO, VV various TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Vesna Levar: “He was killed by a planted bomb in his own back yard. This was in 2000. when there was peace in Croatia.”\n\n00:41:17 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Zeljko Peratovic: “Milan Levar was a symbol of Croats who wanted a fair and just Croatia and that’s why he was killed. The government only partially investigated the crimes of Gospic, discovering 50 bodies and convicting 3 people of 15, 12 and 10 years in prison. And that’s where everything stopped.”\n\n00:41:48 (Boris VO, various shoots and newspaper animation)\n\nInstead of building peaceful and trusting relationships between the waring sides in Croatia, in 1992, the Pentagon was busy proclaiming its imperial hegemony over the world in its \"Defense Planning Guide.\" According to the New York Times of 1992 this document asserts that the only possible course for the U.S. to pursue is complete world domination, and it adds that no other country has the right to aspire to the role of leadership, even as a regional power.\n\n00:42:16 (VV)\n\n James Bissett: “It simply looked upon itself now as the supreme power in a unipolar world and that they could do whatever they wanted to do.”\n\n00:42:25 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots and pictures)\n\nYugoslavia had to be broken down. And there was no better symbol for Yugoslavia than it’s central republic of Bosnia.

It involves brother versus brother, family member versus family member and it is one of the ugliest kind of conflicts.”\n\n00:43:20 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots and pictures)\n\nThe Serbs wanted to have control over lands mainly inhabited by Serbs, including lands that were of strategic importance to them, the Croats wanted the same for themselves, while the Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks as they’re called today, wanted it all. To achieve this, the Bosnian government, now increasingly representing the Bosniak voice, started getting help from the Americans.\n\n00:43:44 (various TV archive shoots and pictures, VV)\n\n Lewis Mackenzie: “Secret flights started arriving at Tuzla and air drops and other areas. […] The Americans started to approve the delivery of arms to the Bosnian Muslims.”\n\n00:43:54 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAmerican President Clinton later admitted in a book that the Americans didn’t enforce the arms embargo. Heck, but that’s not all. Alija was also offered the help of hundreds of Mujahadeen! Come on, who can say no to these guys. Serbs, on the other hand, relied heavily on aid from Belgrade. As the Yugoslav Army was the fourth largest in Europe, the West moved to stop Belgrade from helping the Serbs in Bosnia. So, in May of 1992 sanctions were imposed on what was left of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n00:44:26 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBy October 1993, 90 percent of Yugoslavia's domestic drug production stopped. The average daily intake of calories had fallen by 28 percent compared to 1990 and 1.5 million people were classified as undernourished. Two months later, over 60 percent of Yugoslavia's work force was unemployed and the average monthly income had dropped from $500 to $15.

As I recall, it was something like 1.8 billion percent inflation rate.”\n\n00:46:34 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThey even printed a 500 billion dinar note. The lawlessness was intensifying and the mafia was taking control. In spite of the catastrophe around them, the Serbs would not heel to the will of the West, so one man decided to use this opportunity to save an organization that no longer had a purpose.\n\n00:46:52 (Boris VO, NATO various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, was a system of collective defense whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party, founded in 1949. The purpose, really, became to protect the West from the Soviets, a counter-balance to the later formed Warsaw Pact.\n\n00:47:10 (VV)\n\n George Bogdanich: “President Eisenhower saw NATO as a defensive Alliance that eventually the Europeans would take over. Instead, the US has turned it into an instrument of power and Eastward expansion.”\n\n00:47:27 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBut then the Soviet Union went bust.\n\n00:47:29 (VV, various TV and film archive shoots)\n\n George Bogdanich: “The US […] explicitly broke the agreement that was made with Gorbachev about not surounding Russia with hostile militarily armed states.” (George Bogdanich, 27:48 min)\n\n00:47:44 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n John Bosnitch: “The colonization of Serbia is the bottom or second step on the staircase to Russia. We must be colonized because NATO […] learned Hitler’s lesson: Don’t have a two-front war when you’re attacking the Russians, you have to neutralize Yugoslavia the way Hitler did.”\n\n00:48:03 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBut to do that, you’d need to create a case where you had to intervene against an enemy in Yugoslavia. Enter Joe Biden.\n\n00:48:11 (VV, Senate Foreign relations Comittee)\n\n Joe Biden: “We face […] a blatant act of Serbian expansionism and aggression […] This is no more a civil war than Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia had civil wars in the 1930s. This, as then in my view, is fascist thuggery on the march!” (Joe Biden and British response, 02:19 min)\n\n00:48:29 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n George Bogdanich: “He was calling Serbs horrific names and at the same time he had a very influential position on the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate.” (George Bogdanich, 24:43 min)\n\n00:48:39 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBiden was also emphasizing the importance of a new role for NATO, as seen in February of 1994 at the Senate hearing on the future of NATO.\n\n00:48:47 (Boris VO, newspaper animation)\n\n Joe Biden’s words: “Last month, while the allies reassured themselves in Brussels that NATO remains at the bedrock of European security, crimes of a kind that were tried at Nuremberg a half a century ago continued unabated in Bosnia. Without a common enemy to unite us, we may find that our conceptions of what constitutes national interest may very well divide us”\n\n00:49:13 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nHe found the common enemy in the Serbian people, who were already previously demonized by US Public Relation firms such as Ruder & Finn, hired by various separatist groups from Yugoslavia.\n\n00:49:24 (VV)\n\n Michel Chossudovsky: “They not only demonized the Serbian leadership, they demonized the Serbian people.”\n\n00:49:31 (VV, various BW archive shoots)\n\n Sunil Ram: “The problem for the Serbs was that they were a little slow off the mark. They did not understand what was being done to them, and by the time they did, the whole Balkan region had collapsed into a state of conflict, in which the Serbs were made out, clearly, from propaganda at the time, to be the enemy of everybody else.”\n\n00:49:53 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThus, the US quickly set out to act against the Serbs, stirring up a storm in Croatia. Operation Storm, that is.\n\n00:50:01 (VO, various TV archive shoots, VV)\n\n Lewis Mackenzie: “They came up with a plan where the Croatian Army would launch an attack down into the Krajina and occupy the area that was manned by the Serbian minority that had been there for 4 or 5 centuries, but it was declared that they were much too radical to permit to continue within the borders of Croatia”\n\n00:50:25 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAnd at a meeting on the Brijuni islands, Franjo gave his go-ahead to general Ante Gotovina for the single largest act of ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars:\n\n00:50:34 (VO, various TV archive shoots) (Croatian)\n\n Voice of Franjo: “We must inflict blows that will make the Serbs all but disappear [...] It is important that these [Serb] civilians start moving and then the army will follow them, and when the columns start moving, they will have a psychological effect on each other. [...] We provide them with an exit, while on the other hand we pretend to guarantee civilian human rights and the like...”\n\n00:51:00 (Boris VO, various TV archive and BW shoots)\n\nAn operation that lasted 84 hours in August of 1995, resulted in the death of around 2,000, and a quarter of a million ethnically cleansed Serbs. Slobo and his generals, the protectors of all Serbs, had abandoned them.\n\n00:51:14 (VV, Scene from a BW movie) (Serbian)\n\n General: “Save yourselves if you can!” Soldiers: “Come back, General!”\n\n00:51:21 (VV)\n\n Lewis Mackenzie: “Operation Storm was an American inspired, by some of my coleagues, because the people that were advising the Croatian Army were retired American general officers who operated just outside of Beltway in Washington.”\n\n00:51:37 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nFranjo was very happy.\n\n00:51:39 (VV) (Croatian)\n\n Franjo: “They didn’t even have time to take their dirty money, or underwear!”\n\n00:51:46 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots and animation)\n\nWith the Serbs gone from Croatia, the Americans moved on to Bosnia. Simply pushing out the Serbs from there was not so easy, so a different strategy was implemented. Presenting the conflict in Bosnia as a civil war, which it was, instead of a war of Serbian aggression, meant that the Western public would be confused, and the water would be muddied. To intervene, the Americans needed to make clear who they had to intervene against.\n\n00:52:10 (VV)\n\n Richard Holbrooke: “The Serbs started the war. The Serbs are the original cause of the war.”\n\n00:52:16 (VV)\n\n Bill Clinton: “They are the complete aggressors and wrongdoers.”\n\n00:52:19 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nNATO was used to militarily continue the colonization process, but Clinton knew it had to be somehow justified to the wider public. Perhaps the best example of what we’re talking about here is Srebrenica.\n\n00:52:32 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nSrebrenica, a village in Bosnia, was declared a UN safe zone for Bosniaks seeking refuge, but was never really demilitarized, which allowed Bosniak forces to attack neighboring Serb villages. Serb commander Ratko Mladic overran Srebrenica, with thousands of Muslims killed and ethnically cleansed.\n\n00:52:51 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “What happened in Srebrenica was a stage managed fall of the enclave to the Serbian forces, which never expected to conquer it.”\n\n00:53:00 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe United Nations declared that this was genocide, even though UN observer Philip Corwin estimated that the number of killed Muslims in Srebrenica was no larger than the number of Serbs killed in villages around Srebrenica. But that didn’t matter, Srebrenica was to be used for a much greater agenda.\n\n00:53:17 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “There are trustworthy witnesses on the Muslim side who claim that Alija Izetbegovic told them that Bill Clinton had indicated to him, Izetbegovic, that 5,000 dead Muslims would be the price of NATO intervention on the Bosnian Muslim side. They believe that Srebrenica was deliberately sacrificed by Izetbegovic in order to provide this burnt offering to the White House that would be the justification for intervention and indeed, ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’.”\n\n00:53:48 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe Bosniak government ‘had no choice’.\n\n00:53:51 (VV)\n\n Joe Biden: “Mr Silajdzic, speaking for his government said:”\n\n00:53:53 (VV) (Bosnian)\n\n Haris Silajdzic: “We have no choice and our Presidency had no choice but to appeal for a military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina”\n\n00:54:01 (VV)\n\n Joe Biden: “You can not […] go this alone, the American public will not tolerate it, the Alliance can not stand it.”\n\n00:54:10 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAnd intervention ensued. Here was NATO, an organization formed for the sole purpose of defense of its member states, attacking a country that has not attacked or threatened any of its member states. Lewis Mackenzie, who was the Major General of the UN Army in charge of Sector Sarajevo, tried to warn the Americans of what they were embarking upon.\n\n00:54:35 (VV)\n\n Lewis Mackenzie: “I appeared in front of Congress and they asked me my opinion. And I said – Start training your grandchildren to be peacekeepers in Bosnia, because you’re going to be there for generations. And a lot of them are still there.”\n\n00:54:47 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAs heavily-armed US and NATO troops enforced the peace in Bosnia, the press and politicians alike portrayed Western intervention in the former Yugoslavia as a noble, if agonizingly belated, response to an outbreak of ethnic massacres and human rights violations.\n\n00:55:03 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “A lot of the so-called liberal or left-wing or progressive media were themselves coopted by the mainstream viewpoint regarding the Balkans. In other words, they had bought into this paradigm that was presented to them by [...] the arms of the Government of the United States and of the EU powers.”\n\n00:55:25 (VV, various TV archive shoots and pictures)\n\n John Bosnitch: “Only the journalists who towed the line and found new ways to attack the Serbs, other than the ones their editors sent them to tell, other than the stories that were pre-written before they came to the Balkans [...] those guys excelled.”\n\n00:55:40 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nOf course, the bombing campaign forced the Bosnian Serbs to surrender. At the peace accord signing, which internally divided Bosnia into a Serb entity and a Muslim Croat entity, all those responsible for intensifying the war were praising peace.\n\n00:55:54 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThis is the village of Vrhbarje, near Sokolac in Bosnia, inhabited mainly by Serbs and Muslims. After the imposed Dayton peace accords, the villagers were aware of what this meant to them, and as the town became a part of the Serb entity, the Muslims decided to collectively leave to their own entity.\n\n00:56:14 (VV, TV archive shoots) (Bosnian)\n\n “Both of you in tears!“ (Interviewer), “Neighbours!” (Suno, Muslim), “Neighbours.” (Nedjo, Serb), “Today you’re parting ways.” (Interviewer), “That we are.” (Suno) “Well, is it hard?” (Interviewer), “Yes, as you can see.” (Suno), “Two neighbors saying goodbye in tears?” (Interviewer), “From the depth of my heart, and his - definitely.” (Suno) “Definitely.” (Nedjo) “You lived together for so many years…” (Interviewer), “As many years as he’s lived, we’ve lived together.” (Suno), “Together for 68 years” (Nedjo), “Without fights, disagreements…” (Interviewer), “Always helping each other, our entire lives and now as well.” (Suno) “And how is it now?” (Interviewer) “It’s hard.

We got along great.” (Senad, Muslim), “Did the Serb kids ever provoke you or cause any problems?” (Interviewer), “No, never, everything between us was good, just like before.” (Senad)\n\n00:57:30 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThis video footage has never been shown anywhere before. It just didn’t fit the image the Western media had tried to hard to project, the tidy melodrama of the evil Serbs destroying everything non-Serb in sight. Do you think this would mobilize Western public opinion to intervene?\n\n00:57:47 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n “No disagreements, no pressures, no fights.” (Interviewer) “No, never. Never here.” (Nura)\n\n00:57:53 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Serbian-Bosnian)\n\n “You’re alive and well.” (Interviewer), “Alive and well, never had any problems, not the slightest problem.

I want Yugoslavia back, like it was before.” (Kadrija, Muslim)\n\n00:59:08 (Boris VO, various pictures)\n\nHuman compassion was something that was completely normal to a young Serbian man from Trebinje in Herzegovina called SRDJAN ALEKSIC.\n\n00:59:16 (Boris VO, Srdjan’s father)\n\nSrdjan’s father recalled how his son noticed that the Serb police were arresting a man on an ethnic basis.\n\n00:59:22 (VV, Srdjan’s father, various reconstruction shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Rade Aleksic: “Srdjan saw the police taking away Alen and he followed them to see why they were doing so. They then confronted a drunk soldier who seized Alen from the policemen, quickly realizing he’s a Muslim. At the time, Alen was a soldier of the Army of Republika Srpska and was on leave due to an injury he sustained during battle and the necessary rehabilitation needed. The drunk soldier took out his knife to slaughter Alen on the street, the worst possible death for a man. Srdjan intervened and started fighting with the soldier. Alen managed to escape, while Srdjan threw the soldier’s knife and began walking away. However, three other soldiers, who were watching the fight from far away, attacked Srdjan, threw him to the ground, kicked him, hit him… and left Srdjan on the street unconscious. My son was taken to the hospital where they diagnosed him as having a brain hemorage. Srdjan was fighting for his life for seven days. On the seventh day, January 27, 1993, my son passed away.”\n\n01:00:45 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThis is one among many stories of true heroism that never made it to the Western media. The West was more focused on escalating the conflict so they could have the excuse for jumping in for their own interests. As the world celebrated peace in Bosnia 1992, the international financial institutions were busily collecting former Yugoslavia's external debt from its remnant states, while transforming the Balkans into a safe-haven for free enterprise. In late 1995, the West unveiled a \"reconstruction\" program that stripped Bosnia of sovereignty to a degree not seen in Europe since the end of World War II. It was pure colonialism, consisted largely of making Bosnia a divided territory under NATO military occupation and foreign administration. This pattern of intervention was so successful, that the West just had to replicate it in Kosovo.\n\n01:01:36 (VV)\n\n Visar Yimeri: “I think that the region is important in geostrategic terms. They saw Kosovo as a very potential country to actually secure their presence in the region.”\n\n01:01:46 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBut the West underestimated the importance that Kosovo has to the Serbian people.\n\n01:01:55 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Bill Clinton: “My fellow Americans, today our armed forces joined our NATO allies in air strikes against Serbian forces responsible for the brutality in Kosovo.”\n\n01:02:05 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nOn March 24, 1999, on the order of Javier Solana, in an act of pure aggression, NATO had violated international law and the UN charter by launching an air assault on Yugoslavia. The people of Yugoslavia, however, decided to show their true spirit, by going outside, singing songs and having fun on their bridges in spite of the catastrophe around them.\n\n01:02:27 (various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n The song “We love our fatherland!”\n\n01:02:33 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n TV: “Did you hear that the air raid sirens have sounded off in Belgrade?” Ceca: „Yes, and I don’t give a damn!“\n\n01:02:39 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Woman: “Clinton, f**k you, we’ll win!”\n\n01:02:42 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Man: “I want to say that Clinton is a woman and has no heart! He’s without mercy, that motherf… I apologize.”\n\n01:02:51 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Another man: “If they bomb our village bridge, we’ll build it again in… 3 hours! Just because we can.”\n\n01:02:59 (VV)\n\n Scott Taylor: “We thought the Serbs should last 5 days under the bombing and then [give up]. No one expected them to run on the bridges, put on target T-shirts,…”\n\n01:03:08 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe declared mission was to stop the violance in Kosovo and topple Slobo. Bombing Yugoslavia had the opposite affect, as the conflict in Kosovo only intensified, and the public rallied behind Slobo.\n\nThe reality of the war, however, was far too gruesome. Schools, hospitals, bridges, TV stations, and even foreign embassies, were all legitimate military targets for NATO.\n\n01:03:33 (various TV archive shoots)\n\n Scott Taylor: “The things that they bombed, I mean, the power grid. […] Night after night they would hit the power grid, knock it out so that they couldn’t pump water and, you know, the bakeries couldn’t fire up in Belgrade. So, denying […] millions of people access to daily bread and water. How does that affect the counter insurgency efforts of the Serbian security forces in the province of Kosovo?\n\n01:02:42 (Boris VO)\n\nThese were attacks on the Serbian people.\n\n01:03:54 (VV)\n\n Vlade Divac: “When civilians die, they call them collateral damage. That’s what makes you feel bad, because they’re humans, you know, they have their names and they’re everything for their families. But, for the rest of the world, they’re just collateral damage.”\n\n01:04:11 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Scott Taylor: “They hit the cigarette factory in Nis three times. And it ended up being purchased by Phillip Morris. Well if I walk into a supermarket with a hammer and start smashing stuff and then say – look, I’ll pay you a pittens for the remains, I’m a viking and a vandal.”\n\n01:04:28 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nApparently the cigarettes made in Nis were also killing Albanians in Kosovo, so they needed to be taken out.\n\n01:04:35 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Scott Taylor: “Obviously Phillip Morris had an issue with the cigarette factory in Nis, it was one of their main competitors in the European market.”\n\n01:04:41 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n John Bosnitch: “The real purpose of the war was to economically colonise the country. […] To replace the whole non-compatible domestic infrastructure with German-compatible, American-compatible economic systems. So, bomb the car factory, the Yugo car factory, the car that managed to make it into the U.S. market, bomb that to the ground. Bomb the cement factories, bomb the oil industry, […] bomb all of the telecommunication systems so you can sell them the new ones, much more expensive, but not any better.”\n\n01:05:13 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoot, newspaper animation)\n\nIf this was NATO’s job, it had to have been well coordinated in advance. In fact, almost a year prior to the war, the World Bank carefully analyzed the consequences of an eventual military intervention leading to the occupation of Kosovo and conducted relevant \"simulations\" which \"anticipated the possibility of an emergency scenario arising out of the tensions in Kosovo.\" This suggests that NATO had already briefed the World Bank at an early stage of military planning. The plans for occupation started before a good enough pretext to intervene was found.\n\n01:05:45 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nBut hold on, occupation? Weren’t we told that Kosovo was to be liberated from the Serbian aggressors who invaded it? Well, I have yet to find someone who can explain how a country can invade itself. History was twisted in a way that would give the West a believable pretext to intervene.\n\n01:06:01 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAfter 5 centuries of Turkish rule, Kosovo legally became a part of Serbia in 1912. By then, a lot of the Serbs were long gone, and those that were left were again under attack during World War II, when the Albanian fascists took over Kosovo. Mustafa Kruja, the Prime Minister of Albania, was in Kosovo in June 1942, and at a meeting with the Albanian leaders of Kosovo, he said: \"We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo be – the area be cleansed of them and all Serbs who had been living there for centuries should be termed colonialists and sent to concentration camps in Albania. The Serb settlers should be killed.\"\n\n01:06:39 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “The terror against the indigenous Serbian population reached significant proportions with over 10,000 being killed in cold blood and twice that number being expelled.”\n\n01:06:59 (Boris VO, various BW TV archive shoots)\n\nHere’s Tito with Enver Hoxha, the Albanian dictator during communist times. You see, one thing I didn’t mention about Tito is that he didn’t just want to be ruler of Yugoslavia, he wanted most of the Balkans, a federation including parts of Greece and Italy, Bulgaria and Albania as well. This meant that the Albanian dictator Hoxha was to be shown just how much the Albanians were well treated in Yugoslavia. So, the Yugoslav Albanians, living mostly in Kosovo, got a better living standard than in Albania! Their own University, schools, newspapers, political institutions, cultural centres, everything in the Albanian language. Albanians from Albania were flooding into Kosovo with ease, and the Serbs were being pushed out.\n\n01:07:47 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Serb woman in 1982: “There were 200 Serb houses here, now there’s only 5. Everyone left, from pressures, terror.”\n\n01:08:00 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nWestern media failed to mention any of this. The official story was that Kosovo Albanians wanted independence because of Slobo’s actions in the 1990s, which ignored the fact that Albanians demanded for Kosovo the status of a Republic quickly after Tito’s Yugoslavia was formed, around the time Slobo was born, and even held mass demonstrations in 1968. In ‘74, Tito gave Kosovo, still a province of Serbia, all the traits of a Republic and this effectively helped the Albanian leaders to continue what was started in World War II.\n\n01:08:30 (VV)\n\n John Hawthorne: “You had a lot of low level intimidation. [...] Attacks on individuals that are not dealt with by the police, in that sense, effectively. There are no arrests that follow.”\n\n01:08:42 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Serb man in 1985: „We can’t stand this terror anymore!”\n\n01:08:45 (Boris VO, newspaper animation, various TV archive shoots)\n\nA New York Times article published on July 12th 1982, many years before Slobo came to power said that “the exodus of Serbs is admittedly one of the main problems that the authorities have to contend with in Kosovo.” Regarding the Albanians who want to separate from Yugoslavia, Becir Hoti, an executive secretary of the Communist Party of Kosovo stated that ''the nationalists have a two-point platform - first to establish what they call an ethnically clean Albanian republic and then the merger with Albania to form a greater Albania.”\n\n01:09:14 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAnd they were desparate for help, they needed it at any cost. Any cost you say?\n\n01:09:20 (VV, girl sings)\n\n Albanian girl, Medlina Bardhi, singing: “Madeleine (Albright), I love you! I forget you never! Madeleine, I adore you, now and forever! My dreams come true cuz I have your name. When I grow up, I will do for children the same!”\n\n01:09:46 (VV)\n\n Madeleine Albright: “There are a lot of little girls in Kosovo whose first name is Madeleine.”\n\n01:09:58 (VV)\n\n Richard Holbrooke: “If you want, we can talk here or we can go outside”\n\n01:10:09 (Reporter VO)\n\n Albanian American conference, New York, 2004: “Mr. Clark, this is your group, they’re all KLA, former fighters.”\n\n01:10:20 (VV)\n\n Richard Holbrooke: “Thank you for the enormous amount of money you’ve raised tonight!”\n\n01:10:29 (VV)\n\n Bill Clinton: “I must say, I never expected that anywhere someone would make such a big statue of me.”\n\n01:10:47 (Boris VO, newspaper animation, various TV archive shoots)\n\nYou gotta hand it to the Albanians, they really know how to flatter the Americans. Trouble is the Albanians didn’t know what they were getting themselves into. In 1998, the KLA was still classified by the U.S. State Department as: “a terrorist organization bankrolled by the proceeds from the heroin trade and by Osama bin Laden”.\n\n01:11:07 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAs it became more evident that the KLA was driving events in Kosovo, the U.S. realized it could use them for their own interests.\n\n01:11:13 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Gregory Elich: “The whole northern Albania region was actually under the control of the KLA, not the Albanian government and U.S. cargo planes were landing at a rate of two a day bringing supplies and arms shippments. British special forces, CIA, U.S. military forces were providing training to the KLA – this was before the war. Germany was shipping ex-East German military arms to Albania, with the understanding that Albania would provide it to the KLA.”\n\n01:11:43 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe goal was to provoke a harsh response from the Serbian army, so the West could pretend it’s jumping in to stop the war and impose its policies. Slobo sent in the military and a full blown conflict erupted in 1998.\n\n01:11:56 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n Slobodan Samardzic: “The situation of an unsolvable conflict between Serbs and Albanians was simulated under the banner of human rights violations. Human rights were used as a matra through which Western, especially US, public opinion would accept the legitimacy of intervention.”\n\n01:12:20 (VO, VV various TV archive shoots)\n\n Barry Lituchy: “Certainly everything the United States have done in Afghanistan and Iraq, [...] is far worse than what the Serbian military ever did in Kosovo.”\n\n01:12:28 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nIf you’re gonna colonize a territory, might as well put it on paper.\n\nUS State Secretary Madeleine Albright, masterminded the so-called Rambouillet agreement which was modeled on the Dayton Accords imposed on Bosnia. Here NATO outlined how it will occupy and colonize Yugoslavia, in Annex B of the Rambouillet agreement:\n\n01:12:47(Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n “NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft, and equipment, free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout Yugoslavia”\n\n01:12:56 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Milan Milutinovic: “They took us to Rambouillet to drown us!”\n\n01:13:02 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n George Kenney: “We intentionally raised the bar too high, we knew that they could not accept this Addendum to the Agreement and the intention was to go ahead and bomb.”\n\n01:13:14 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nIn fact, this Annex was secret! That’s right, it was not revealed to the public until several months after the beginning of the war. The document also went a step further and basically promised Kosovo secession in 3 years.\n\n01:13:28 (VO -> VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Bill Clinton: “The Kosovar leaders signed that agreement last week. Even though it does not give them all they want…”\n\n01:13:33 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nNope, they have to wait 3 more years to get it.\n\n01:13:37 (VV)\n\n Bill Clinton: “…they saw that a just peace is better than a long and unwinnable war. The Serbian leaders, on the other hand, refused even to discuss key elements of the peace agreement.”\n\n01:13:49 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nGee, I wonder why. “Hey, do you want us to occupy you this way or that way?” Of course while the true details were hidden, the story was presented that the Americans wanted to protect the Albanians.\n\n01:13:59 (VV, American talk show)\n\n Fox News: “Maybe we could show some refugee pictures, you know what, they break my heart, America’s been responding to this terror, these pictures that have been going on and all these attrocities. […] You look at all the attrocities, all the misery and mayhem and insanity – there’s an incideous evil that permeates this Earth.”\n\n01:14:15 (VV, various TV archive shoots)\n\nMany Albanians didn’t buy it.\n\n01:14:17 (VV, various TV archive shoots) (Serbian)\n\n First Albanian: “I’m not Orthodox, I’m an Albanian. From the First World War to today, I’ve never lived better anywhere than in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. The country that is the richest and should be the smartest in the world, is bringing evil to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav and Albanian people. This is all the fault of the KLA, America and NATO.”\n\n01:14:47 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n TV newscaster: “But the West says they’re helping you and solving the humanitarian crisis”, Second Albanian: “Bombing doesn’t help anyone.”\n\n01:14:55 (VV)\n\n Visar Yimeri: “I consider that the intervention of the West in 1999 against Serbia was [...] made possible by the geostrategic interests that the Western countries might have had and especially the United States of America.”\n\n01:15:09 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThis had nothing to do with the Albanians, or the Americans caring about them.\n\n01:15:13 (VO, Serbian war reporter) (Serbian)\n\n Miroslav Lazanski: “Can NATO pilots distinguish tractors from Yugoslav Army tanks from the air? 10 days after the incident, we stand on the spot of the NATO slaughter of Albanian refugees from Kosovo, near the town of Djakovica.”\n\n01:15:28 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThat’s right, NATO killed Albanian civilians too. Lots of them. If they cared about Albanians, or Serbs for that matter, the West wouldn’t have aided the KLA which was directly linked to organized crime and the narcotics trade. You don’t help anyone by aiding the mafia. After the highly publicized Racak massacre which was later to be revealed by Finnish forensic Helena Ranta as staged, NATO bombed Yugoslavia, but failed to destroy the Yugoslav military.\n\n01:15:55 (VV)\n\n Gregory Elich: “By the end of NATO bombing, only 13 Yugoslav tanks were destroyed and a lot of those were old models that were left out deliberately as decoys.”\n\n01:16:03 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n John Bosnitch: “The Serbs had ingenius methods of protecting their military defences. They built wooden tanks, painted them to look like a real tank and put an old heater or microwave oven inside it and turned it on. NATO goes by with hiper-high technology, sees the target and bombs it. OK, those bombs cost several hundred thousand dollars per go, and the tar paper tank costs about 200 bucks.”\n\n01:16:28 (VO -> VV scene from a Serbian film) (Serbian)\n\n Bata Stojkovic: “ Let me tell you a joke. An Englishman, a Bulgarian, a Frenchman and a Serb are sitting in an airplane. Now, I’m not quite sure what happened, but in the end, the Serb was the smartest and outwitted everyone else!”\n\n01:16:58 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nSo why did Slobo give in to NATO?\n\n01:17:02 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n Gregory Elich: “At the June 2nd meeting when Marti Ahtisaari and Viktor Chernomyrdin came to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic, Ahtisaari read […] NATO’s terms and Milosevic asked if it could be modified or discussed, and Ahtisaari said “No, you have to accept this in its entirety.” Milosevic asked them: “What would happen then if I don’t sign?”\n\n01:17:18 (VV)\n\nThere was a table between them with a flower vase and Ahtisaari moved the vase to the side and said: “Belgrade will be like this table.” Then he repeated the gesture of his arm sweeping across the table. He said in a weeks time there will be half a million dead, it will be carpet bombing Belgrade.”\n\n01:17:40 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nFaced with Ahtisaari’s monstruous threat, Slobo had no choice and signed the agreement, while Ahtisaari went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008.\n\n01:17:56 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n CBS: “This is a CBS News Special Report, part of our continuing coverage of the Crisis over Kosovo”, Dan Rather: “Earlier today, Serb forces began withdrawing from Kosovo and NATO suspended its 11 week bombing campaign. The UN Security Council then voted to authorize a NATO-led force of up to 50,000 troops to move into Kosovo immediately.”\n\n01:18:10 (VV)\n\n Visar Yimeri: “The first step of the Western geostrategic interests was fulfilled in 1999 being that NATO troops entered Kosovo and they remain still in Kosovo.” (KOSOVO 04, 08:24 min)\n\n01:18:20 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAlong with U.S. troops which established Camp Bondsteel, the second largest foreign military base outside of Germany, an army of lawyers and consultants was sent into the now occupied Kosovo under World Bank auspices to create an \"enabling environment\" for foreign capital. And how was this done?\n\n01:18:37 (VV)\n\n Gregory Elich: “They set up an organization to manage the privatization of socially owned enterprises and after a certain period of time they determined that they would do this without any regard to legal ownership, that they wouldn’t have to pay any attention to who actually legally owned this, they just basically confiscated it and privatized it, sold it to whom they chose.”\n\n01:19:02 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nYugoslav State banks in Kosovo were closed down and the Deutschmark was adopted as legal tender. Almost the entire banking system in Kosovo was handed over to Germany’s Commerzbank A.G. which gained full control over commercial banking functions for the province.\n\n01:19:17 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nOne second though. Think about this for a little bit. Human rights violations. War crimes. Those are the reasons the West went in to Kosovo, we’ve been told by the media, right? So why was the head of the UN mission of Kosovo most obsessed with taking over a coal mine from the Serbs?\n\n01:19:36 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nPrior to the bombings, Western investors already had their eyes riveted on the massive Trepca mining complex which constitutes \"the most valuable piece of real estate in the Balkans, worth at least $5 billion.\"\n\n01:19:50 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe Trepca complex not only includes copper and large reserves of zinc but also cadmium, gold, and silver.\n\n01:19:57 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nThe International Crisis Group, a think tank supported by Financier George Soros, issued a paper on \"Trepca: Making Sense of the Labyrinth\" which told UNMIK \"to take over the Trepca mining complex from the Serbs as quickly as possible” and that “handing Trepca over to the Kosovars is ruled out”.\n\n01:20:13 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAnd in August 2000, UNMIK Head Bernard Kouchner sent in heavily armed \"peacekeepers\" wearing surgical masks against toxic smoke to occupy the mine. This was done on the pretense that it was creating an environmental hazard through excessive air pollution.\n\n01:20:28 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nOf course, a healthy environment had always been a top priority of the West in Yugoslavia, even during the bombing campaign nicknamed “Merciful angel”.\n\n01:20:38 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\n RT: “After NATO used depleted uranium munitions here during the 1999 bombing, military experts from Belgrade have registered an increased radiation level and claim the area is highly contaminated. Dr. Sedlak was the first to raise the alarm. In 2001, he registered an unprecedented increase in cancer patients.”\n\n01:20:50 (VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nDoctor: “There is no other place in the modern world where so many people and so many young people aged between 30 and 40 die from cancer.” RT: “In this animal hospital in the South of Serbia, one of the most bombed regions, there is evidence of something going wrong.\n\n01:21:02 (VV, Journalist)\n\nAs it takes billions of years for uranium to decay, the ghost of the merciful angel will hang over the region virtually forever.”\n\n01:21:12 (Boris VO, various shoots)\n\nSee, that’s perfectly fine. Meanwhile, the United Nations had handed over the management of the entire Trepca mining complex to a Western consortium. With a stake in the Trepca deal was Morrison Knudsen International. The new conglomerate was the Washington Group, one of the World's most powerful engineering and construction firms as well as a major Defense contractor in the US.\n\n01:21:34 (Boris VO, various shoots)\n\nAre any of the Western politicians, businessmen or lobbyists facing charges for stealing from the Yugoslav people, for crimes against the people of the former Yugoslavia? Nope. Not a single one of them. Instead, to escepe any persecution, they set up a tribunal in the Hague, the Netherlands, to try the Yugoslav people involved in the war.\n\n01:21:56 (VV)\n\n Srdja Trifkovic: “The Hague Tribunal was founded in 1993 on the basis of the Security Council Resolution, rather than General Assembly Resolution, which means that it is an ad hoc body created on the basis of political rather than legal principles.”\n\n01:22:14 (Boris VO, various shoots and TV archive shoots)\n\nWhen you’re creating a colony, you only lock up the dissidents. Back in Belgrade, Slobo, who was declared a man of peace in 1995 when he handed over Bosnia to the West, after he was being stubborn about doing the same for Kosovo, got indicted for war crimes.\n\n01:22:30 (VV)\n\n John Perkins: “I think every major world leader knows that if they don’t go along with the system, that they’re likely to be taken out one way or another.”\n\n01:22:38 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nAfter an extensive anti-Slobo campaign readily financed by Western wallets,\n\n01:22:43 (VO, Euronews footage)\n\nThe EU and the USA have spent millions of Euros in equipping opposition movements inside Yugoslavia with the necessary resources to fight in election campaign.\n\n01:23:52 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nSlobo lost the elections in September of 2000, but wouldn’t heel to his opponent, Vojislav Kostunica. Vojo decided that enough was enough.\n\n01:23:07 (VO, drums)\n\nVictory, victory shoutet the crowd, Slobodan, Slobodan save Serbia and kill yourself\n\n01:23:14 (VV, Slobodan announces that he’s been defeated) (Serbian)\n\n Slobo: “I congratulate Vojislav Kostunica on his election victory.”\n\n01:23:19 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nSlobo fell. But what next? The politicians were all back to quarelling over insignificant nonsense, in the hottest TV reality show also known as the Serbian National Assembly.\n\n01:23:33 (VV, TV presenter) (Serbian)\n\n Vladimir Jelic: “The MPs spent the night making accusations and even swearing.”\n\n01:23:39 (VO, Serbian parlament) (Serbian)\n\n RTS: “After members of DS allegedly talked dirty about his mother, Aleksandar Vucic asked the President of Parliament to intervene several times”,\n\n01:23:46 (VV) (Serbian)\n\nAleksandar Vucic: “This bandit from the Democratic Party swore at me more than once!”\n\n01:23:49 (VV, Serbian parlament) (Serbian)\n\n Dragan Todorovic: “I’m ready to make my modest contribution to our path to Europe, as I know what you’ll need there. Unlike those who have been taking their stockings off, dear Minister, I will give you a pair of stockings that you’ll need for the EU.”\n\n01:24:13 (VV, Serbian parlament) (Serbian)\n\n Aleksandar Vucic: “The only thing worse than appointing Ceku and Thaci’s archduke and Solana’s corporal, Boris Tadic, would be to give the title of Prime Minister to the archdule of Meridijan bank worth 11 million Euros.”\n\n01:24:27 (VV, Serbian Parlament) (Serbian)\n\n Bozidar Djelic: “I would’ve prefered if members of the Radical Party here said ‘Bravo Djelic! That’s the stuff! Show everyone how a Serb can be successful in finances! Bozo, you da man! Show! Show everyone! We’re proud of you! One archdule, an archduke of finances, Bozidar Djelic, well done!”\n\n01:24:46 (VV, a historic Shoe) (Serbian)\n\n Dragan Todorovic: “This is the second shoe that will go down in history. The world will hear about this.”\n\n01:24:56 (VO, Newscaster) (Serbian)\n\n Newscaster: “This is the first time shoes were thrown around in Parliament, adding to a long line of incident including water splashing and forceful removal of MPs.”\n\n01:25:07 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nInstead of focusing on the really important things, they allowed the further fragmentation of Yugoslavia. In 2003, the name “Yugoslavia“ officially ceased to exist thanks to the genius perscription of Havier Solana.\n\n01:25:23 (VV, Comedians) (Serbian)\n\n Question: “Is that the famous doctor Solana?” Micko: “Yes, the famous NATOlogist, OEBSologist and bombardologist.”\n\n01:25:29 (Boris VO, various shoots)\n\nHowever, one man didn’t want to give up his country and its system so easily. Blasko Gabric, from my hometown of Subotica, decided to make a radical move.\n\n01:25:40 (VV)\n\n Blasko Gabric: “Yugoslavian socialism was much much better socialism than any other socialism, alright, comparing to the Russians or comparing with Chinese. We had a Heaven. If you can imagine a Heaven in the Earth, that was Yugoslavia.”\n\n01:25:53 (Boris VO)\n\nBlasko explains who took away his piece of Heaven.\n\n01:25:56 (VO -> VV)\n\n Blasko Gabric: “The Western world, they want to talk ‘You will go to Heaven when you die.’ They don’t want afford you Heaven when you’re alive.”\n\n01:26:06 (Boris VO)\n\nSo, he turned his property of 15 hectars into a new, fourth Yugoslavia.\n\n01:26:13 (VV)\n\n Blasko Gabric: They destroy your factory, if they put everything on private. Whatever we had we don’t have anymore, what do you call that?”\n\n01:26:18 (Boris VO)\n\nThe West said this was democracy.\n\n01:26:21 (VV, Explanation of Democracy)\n\n Blasko Gabric: “We have a very very nice joke. When Muslim people ask their priest how can he explain democracy to them, to be capable to understand. Says, well, very simple I can explain that to you. See, when I go in top of minaret and you are down below me and I piss on you guys, even you can piss on me too. That’s democracy.”\n\n01:26:48 (Boris VO)\n\nWell, jokes aside, taking away Yugoslavia’s name had a more malevolent motive.\n\n01:26:54 (VO -> VV)\n\n Blasko Gabric: “When they take Yugoslavia away, when they call [...] Serbia and Montenegro [...] West promised to the Montenegro: Leave the Serbia alone”\n\n01:27:02 (Boris VO)\n\nCome 2006, after a controversial referendum Montenegro became the newest country of the world.\n\n01:27:10 (Newspresenter VO) (Montenegrin)\n\n News: “55.4% of citizens voted for the independence of Montenegro!”\n\n01:27:18 (Boris VO)\n\nHowever, another part of the former Yugoslavia still wanted that title. You guessed it, Kosovo. In the same year, negotiations began between the Belgrade government and the Albanian minority over the status of Kosovo. However, the so-called negotiations were a farce from the beginning, as almost all the Western powers were promising Kosovo independence regardless of the negotiations.\n\n01:27:41 (VV, President Bush)\n\n George W. Bush: “Sooner rather than later, you gotta say enough is enough – Kosovo is independent. That’s the position we’ve taken. The people of Kosovo need to know that it is a solid, firm position, even though there is diplomacy and talks […] but if it’s apparent that that’s not going to happen in a relatively quick period of time, in my judgement, we need to put forward a resolution!”\n\n01:28:05 (Boris VO)\n\nThink about it. If you had some of the world’s largest powers telling you that you can get what you want, why the hell would you settle for any less and try to reach a compromise? As anticipated, the talks broke down and Kosovo, unilaterally, declared independence.\n\n01:28:26 (VO, President Bush)\n\n Bush: “It has been an honor to welcome the President and Prime Minister of an independent Kosovo to the Oval Office. I’m proud y’all are here. I welcome you. I’m a strong supporter of Kosovo’s independence.”\n\n01:28:39 (Church is being ruined)\n\n “Albanian pro-independence protest in Kosovo”\n\n01:28:59 (VV, Bush)\n\n Bush: “I pledged that the United States would continue to work with those nations that have not recognized an independent Kosovo to convince them to do so as quickly as possible.”\n\n01:29:07 (Boris VO, various TV archive shoots)\n\nContrary to what Bush had hoped, the majority of world countries didn’t recognize Kosovo, and it didn’t even become a UN member state. Thus Kosovo failed to become a country. What was absurd in this story is that the Albanian minority, which in all fairness did suffer greatly throughout the 1990s, thought that they actually got independence in 2008.\n\n01:29:27 (VV)\n\n Albanian: “Big day for Kosovo people. Albanians, yeah.”\n\n01:29:31 (VV)\n\n Reporter: “How do you feel?”, Albanian: “Oooo, I feeling very very good. This is like a dream.”\n\n01:29:39 (VV -> various TV archive shoots)\n\n John Bosnitch: “As a Serb, I feel sorry for the Albanians. Because they have been dooped even more than we have. They think they have an independent state. All they’ve got is a military barracks in which they are just allowed to walk around freely. Kosovo is a U.S. military base. It happens to have some local color called Albanians. Some local foliage like leaves on the trees.”\n\n01:30:01 (VV, Hashim Tachi) (Albanian)\n\n Hashim Thaci: “The Kosovo government and the Kosovo people will always bow in deep respect for the United States and for the U.S. administration.”\n\n01:30:08 (VV)\n\n John Bosnitch: “Whether they could decide to do something not consistend with U.S. wishes – impossible.”\n\n01:30:14 (VV Interview with Kosova people)\n\n Boris: “Do you think the Kosovo government could do anything without the Americans agreeing with it?”,\n\nAlbanian 02: “No.”\n\n01:30:21 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Albanian 01: “I don’t believe so. No. I don’t think we can do something without the Americans, English, Germans, French and other powers.”\n\n01:39:32 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Boris: “Do you think that the Kosovo government can make any decisions not consistent with American wishes?”, Albanian 03: “No, it can’t, it can’t.”, Boris: “Why not?”, Albanian 03: “It can’t. America is America.”\n\n01:30:45 (VV) (Serbian)\n\n Albanian 05: “I don’t think so. I don’t think so.”\n\n01:30:49 (VV)\n\n Albanian 04: “We just... we listen Americans.”\n\n01:30:50 (VV)\n\n Vjollca Abdullahu: “America, there are 50 countries... States. Yeah, so, why Kosovo not be a part of America?”, Boris: “You would support that?”, Vjollca: “Yes, why not. They are just administrating everything in Kosovo.”\n\n01:31:03 (VV)\n\n Boris: “The Americans are in control?” Albanian 07: “Yea, they are pretty much in control here.”\n\n01:31:08 (VV)\n\n Albanian 08: “We are not independent from European Union and from America.”\n\n01:31:15 (VV, English Language)\n\n Visar Yimeri: “The formal channel whereby the international missions of Kosovo have the absolute power over all walks of political and economic life in Kosovo are represented through International Civilian Representative who has the right to expell any elected official or anull any laws that are passed by the Assembly of Kosovo. At the same time, there is an informal channel whereby the international community meddles within the politics and economics of Kosovo through the Ambassadors of the powerful countries that have been seen or presented itself as sponsors of the independence of Kosovo. [...] The wishes of these Ambassadors are kind of like orders to Kosovo’s politicians. Kosovo still remains a colony and this colonization has actually degraded the life or the standard of living of Kosovo.”\n\n01:32:01 (Boris VO, various footage of Vojvodina)\n\nOn the other hand, the people of Serbia’s other province were unaware of what was being prepared for them. Smack dab in the middle of the Pannonian plain, Vojvodina has always been an attractive chunk of real estate, exploited for its fertile farmland. After Kosovo’s declaration of independence, the West turned their sights northward.\n\n01:32:22 (Boris VO"
