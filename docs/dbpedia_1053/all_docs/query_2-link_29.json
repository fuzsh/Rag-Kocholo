        "text": "Padang Moonrise: The Birth of the Modern Indonesian Recording Industry (1955-69), Various Artists\n\nPadang Moonrise is the story of modern Indonesian music that emerged underneath the volcanoes of Java and Sumatra. This compilation brought to us by Soundway Records features traditional songs from Java, Sumatra, Bali and beyond, re-imagined by a small group of state-sponsored musicians that also composed and arranged new music. These songs are aimed at consolidating a geographically disparate country with a new language and new ideas of national character. The results are a unique blend of styles that have remained mostly insulated from the world outside of Indonesia until a recent worldwide resurgence in the interest of recorded music of all forms has shone a new light on these nearly forgotten recordings.\n\nDiggers Dozen, DJ Muro\n\nDiggers Dozen presents its first compilation on BBE Music, curated by Japan’s King of Diggin’, DJ Muro. A 12-track release showcasing Japanese jazz-funk and latin-jazz produced in the 70s for Nippon Columbia. Fusing traditional Japanese instruments and melodies with jazz, funk and latin, these tracks are composed by some of Japan’s finest jazz composers and musicians including Kiyoshi Yamaya, Tadaaki Misago & Tokyo Cuban Boys, Kifu Mitsuhashi and Toshiyuki Miyama. The original vinyl upon which these tracks first featured have been deemed super rare among the collector market and have not been available outside of Japan before this release.\n\nForest, Forest\n\nLong lost and much sought after Private Press from Western Massachusetts band Forest. A distinctive Acid-Jazz, crossover AOR, soul sound recorded by this touring band who stood out for having two drummers. This re-issue released on BBE Music comes with 6 previously unreleased tracks.\n\nElements of Nature, FELBM\n\nFollowing a 2 week residency at former monastery Buitenplaats Doornburgh, Eelco Topper aka FELBM collaborated with a cast of local guest musicians on flute, saxophone and cello, infusing the original rhythmic foundation of percussion and acoustic guitar with a lush melodic backdrop. The resulting release out on Soundway Records, titled ‘Elements of Nature’, marries the fluttering melodies and lo-fi cassette sound of earlier FELBM releases with a new conceptual approach and more varied sonic toolkit. Here, Topper successfully preserves the joyful naïveté of the Tapes series while exploring sweeping new ground, resulting in a decisive step forward for Felbm as a composer, producer and artist.\n\nOpera, Nenad Jelić i Łażą Ristovski\n\nSoundway Records reissues a limited 1000 vinyl run of Nenad Jelić and Laza Ristovski’s seminal experimental Serbian album Opera originally released on the former Yugoslavian state record label PGB / RTB in 1986. Combining Balkan and South American percussion and rhythms with synthesisers, vocal samples, and at times unexpected acoustic instruments (zither and harmonica), the album has slowly become a cult classic amongst fans of fourth world and avant garde music and is a kaleidoscope of contrasting moods and inspirations.\n\nIntroducing, Hideyasu Terakawa Quartet Live ft. Hiroshi Fuji\n\nAs part of BBE Music’s J Jazz Masterclass Series, a reissue of the 1978 private press album ‘Introducing’ by the Hideyasu Terakawa Quartet featuring Hiroshi Fuji. With only 100 copies pressed at the time of its original release, this extremely rare album has been reissued by BBE Music for a wider audience to enjoy. The recording itself was a beautiful anomaly given that saxophonist Terakawa never performed again with vibist Hiroshi Fuji. Recorded live in concert at the jazz spot DIG in Masuda City, Japan during Terakawa’s regional tour in 1978. Unlike other J Jazz Masterclass releases, the album contains no original compositions but rather fascinating interpretations of material by leading jazz composers such as Wayne Shorter, Frank Foster and Milt Jackson and Jimmy Heath."
