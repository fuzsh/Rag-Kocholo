        "text": "Is there a secret law that says that in order to achieve significant international distribution, a European film must point up a central relationship involving a cutie-pie kid and a wise older man? The Czech hit Kolya had one, as did Roberto Benigni's Oscar-winner Life is Beautiful; and who could forget the godfather of them all, Cinema Paradiso?\n\nButterfly's Tongue, from Spanish director Jose Luis Cuerda, is the latest incarnation of the breed and uses its charming double act as a way into broaching the difficult subject of the Spanish civil war.\n\nThe small half of the twosome is called Moncho (Manuel Lozano), the seven-year-old son of a tailor in a backwater Galician village. He's timid but is brought out of his shell by the local schoolteacher Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez). Among the many educational delights to which Don Gregorio introduces Moncho are the eating habits of insects - hence the title. But this is 1936, and Don Gregorio, an unashamed republican, is eventually swept up and cast aside as the Falangist tide sweeps into even this remote corner of the country.\n\nWith a narrative seen largely through the child's eyes, Butterfly's Tongue is clearly employing a time-honoured method of sweetening a bitter sociohistorical pill; but there are undoubted strengths in its approach. For one, it can suggest with great subtlety the approaching wave of paranoia that - beyond Moncho's understanding - is provoked by the increasingly vicious ideological conflict.\n\nSecondly, though Butterfly's Tongue lacks the uncompromising detail and overt political debate of Ken Loach's Land and Freedom, its point of view - that of locals, not the International Brigades - means that all that sappy can-you-hear-the-drums-Fernando? romance is banished.\n\nNevertheless, it's precisely the lack of hard detail that weakens Butterfly's Tongue; too many scenes comprise companionable bug hunts, cheerful marching-band music and everyone-say-aah kiddie kisses. Still, as events pick up pace, Cuerda manages to forge a sufficiently stark climax that makes up for the soft-focus rambles that precede it.\n\nThe effect of a much more recent civil conflict is explored in Cabaret Balkan, a film from Serbian director Goran Paskaljevic, which is the centrepiece of the ICA's Out of That Darkness: The Legacy of the Holocaust in the Age of Genocide season.\n\nThough no exact date is established, the time is certainly after Yugoslavia's initial break-up and civil war but before the Nato intervention over Kosovo. A dark and sinister Belgrade is the location for a series of interlocking stories that expose a raw seam of brutality and humiliation among a desperate, unhappy population.\n\nFollowing an introduction by Gene Simmons lookalike MC - which is unfortunately an unpromising, thoroughly hackneyed device - the parade of misery begins. In the opening section, for example, a car accident results in the aggrieved driver forcing his way into the family apartment of the teenager responsible and methodically smashing the possessions of a lifetime; it's easy to see, in this, an echo of how whole communities can be terrorised by local militias.\n\nNear the end, another teenage tearaway is pursued through the tumbledown streets by an angry vigilante mob mistakenly convinced of his guilt; again, not much imagination is required to see how ethnic paranoia could easily be converted into violence.\n\nThe broad, expansive and occasionally overwrought style of film-making has much in common with Underground, Emir Kusturica's 1994 lament for a lost nation; an impression reinforced by the fact that several members of Underground's cast reappear. Sad-faced Miki Manojlovic, beefy, mustachioed Lazar Ristovski, and intense-looking Mirjana Jokovic all make their presence felt.\n\nThey illustrate in their different ways the atmosphere of poetic nihilism generated by Paskaljevic and co-writer Dejan Dukowski (on whose play, The Powder Keg, the film is based). Though lacking the sweep and musicality of Kusturica's work, Cabaret Balkan is a worthy addition to the canon of films spawned by the region's civil strife.\n\nFrom real wars to fantasy ones; in particular, ones that exist only in the minds of animators encouraged to spare no expense. Titan AE comes bearing the reputation of the flop cartoon that precipitated the closure of 20th Century Fox's animation studio - its reputed cost of $80m saw a catastrophic $9.4m opening weekend take in the US.\n\nIt was also explicitly aimed at teenage boys - that most fickle of cinema audiences - and in this service roped in Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and Bill Pullman to voice a sci-fi yarn that involved weird star maps, vicious aliens out to destroy humanity, a slinky cartoon babe for our chisel-jawed hero to snuggle up to, and kick-ass soundtrack action courtesy of Luscious Jackson and Powerman 5000.\n\nThat said, Titan AE isn't quite as idiotic as it sounds. The visuals are spectacular - and most unlikely, given co-director Don Bluth's track record with sappy sub-Disney efforts like Thumbelina and Anastasia. An opening scene, in which planet Earth is vaporised by a pitiless race of ETs called the Drej (pronounced \"dredge\"), sets the tone; as our plucky crew set forth across the universe to unearth the lost Titan Project, the animators let loose their wildest imaginings in a series of planetary environments - hydrogen trees, ice clouds, polluted atmospheres, you name it. Any adolescent-aimed animation must show a Manga influence, but Titan AE (the AE, incidentally, stands for After Earth) comprehensively outdoes its Japanese precursor in sheer visual verve.\n\nBut though the producers make much of the involvement of Joss \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" Whedon, Titan AE is considerably undermined by a screenplay that, considering the investment, is bafflingly light on basic story clarity. Though no one would ever expect a teen toon to be especially demanding, large plot shifts are simply glossed over, or else explained by a particularly weird-voiced character.\n\nNeither can Bluth and his co-director Gary Goldman resist periodic injections of slurp, as Damon's character - fearless good-guy Cale - resolves some of the same father-hate issues that are currently obsessing Hollywood. Nevertheless, as a lesson in state-of-the-art visuals, Titan AE is compulsive viewing.\n\nThe cumbersomely titled The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, however, is the exact opposite of this. Duller by far than the first Flintstones movie - which, despite its popularity, was itself no great shakes - this follow-up completely fails to generate any of the rumbustious quality that was the saving grace of the John Goodman version.\n\nWhat we have here is a sort of prequel to the cartoon - Mark \"Full Monty\" Addy as a young Fred and Stephen Baldwin as young Barney, meeting up with their future spouses. Fine actor though he undoubtedly is, Addy is hung out to dry in the lead role, unable to replicate Goodman's effusiveness. The supporting cast of American TV stars and campy Brit faces don't offer much help. This one is strictly for the kids."
