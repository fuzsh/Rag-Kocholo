        "text": "1986 studio album by Bijelo Dugme\n\nPljuni i zapjevaj moja JugoslavijoStudio album by ReleasedNovember 1986RecordedRTV Sarajevo Studio I, Sarajevo\n\nJugoton Studio, ZagrebGenreLength37:59LabelDiskoton / KamaradProducerGoran BregovićBijelo Dugme chronology\n\nBijelo Dugme\n\n(1984) Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo\n\n(1986) Mramor, kamen i željezo\n\n(1987)\n\nPljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo (trans. Spit and Sing, My Yugoslavia) is the eighth studio album by Yugoslav rock band Bijelo Dugme, released in 1986.\n\nPljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo is the band's first album recorded with vocalist Alen Islamović, who came to the band as replacement for Mladen Vojičić \"Tifa\". It is also the band's first album since 1977 live album Koncert kod Hajdučke česme to feature keyboardist Laza Ristovski as the official member of the band and the band's last studio album to feature keyboardist Vlado Pravdić.\n\nThe album was polled in 1998 as the 53rd on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav Rock and Pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best Albums of Yugoslav Pop and Rock Music).[1]\n\nBackground and recording\n\n[edit]\n\nNew singer: Alen Islamović\n\n[edit]\n\nDivlje Jagode vocalist Alen Islamović, who took over as Bijelo Dugme's singer in early fall 1986, had been unsuccessfully pursued two years earlier by the band's leader Goran Bregović in the immediate aftermath of long-time vocalist Željko Bebek's spring 1984 departure from the band.[2] Unsure about volatile interpersonal relations within the band and fearing Bebek's possible return into the fold, Islamović had decided to turn the offer down at the time and stay with Divlje Jagode;[2] twenty-three-year-old upstart Mladen \"Tifa\" Vojičić thus became Bijelo Dugme's new vocalist, recording only one studio album, 1984's Bijelo Dugme, with the band.[2] Under the pressure of professional obligations, sudden fame, and media scandal that revealed his LSD usage, Vojičić left Bijelo Dugme after only a year, and Divlje Jagode's Islamović got approached once again about joining.[2] This time, Divlje Jagode were based out of London, pursuing an international career under the modified name Wild Strawberries. Doubting Divlje Jagode's international prospects, 29-year-old Islamović decided to take the offer this time, leaving Wild Strawberries and returning to Yugoslavia to join Bijelo Dugme.[2] Talking about the second vocalist change in two years and the band's personnel issues in general, Bregović stated at the time:\n\nFuck singing, and fuck the singer too. What's important is the kind of person he is. The biggest issue in Dugme is can we work together or not. Everything else is easy. I'm very satisfied with Alen. My band is healthy. We've had enough of drunks and drug addicts.[3]\n\nRistovski returns as an official member\n\n[edit]\n\nKeyboardist Laza Ristovski, who had left Bijelo Dugme in 1978, first returned as guest for the band's 1984 self-titled album's recording sessions before rejoining as a full-fledged member following the album's December 1984 release.[2] Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo thus became the first Bijelo Dugme release since 1977 live album Koncert kod Hajdučke česme to feature Ristovski as an official member. For the first time in Bijelo Dugme's history, the lineup included two keyboardists: Ristovski and Vlado Pravdić.[2]\n\nYugoslavism\n\n[edit]\n\nPljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo features similar Balkan folk-infused pop rock sound as Bijelo Dugme, and was similarly inspired by Yugoslavism within communist and socialist patriotic framework, containing numerous references to the Communist League (SKJ)-defined Yugoslav unity as well as the lyrics on the inner sleeve printed in both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets.[2]\n\n(Self-)censorship\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to pressure from Yugoslav communist authorities, Bregović would eventually give up on implementing some of the ideas he had originally envisioned for the album.\n\nWhen he began conceptualizing it, Bregović wanted Yugoslavism-inspired Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo to contain contributions from individuals known for holding political views outside of SFR Yugoslavia's official ideology as espoused by the SKJ, the only legally allowed political party in the country. To that end, he and the band's manager Raka Marić approached three such individuals who had at that point been effectively proscribed from public discourse in Yugoslavia for over a decade:\n\npop singer Vice Vukov, who had represented SFR Yugoslavia at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest before seeing his career prospects marginalized due to being branded a Croatian nationalist as a result of his association with the Croatian Spring political movement,\n\npainter and experimental filmmaker Mića Popović, associated with Yugoslav Black Wave film movement, who got a dissident reputation due to his paintings and early 1960s films,\n\npolitician and diplomat Koča Popović, who despite a prominent World War II role with the Partisan resistance guerrillas as the 1st Proletarian Brigade commander—an engagement that in the post-war communist Yugoslavia earned him the Order of the People's Hero medal followed by high political and diplomatic appointments—nevertheless got silently removed from public life in 1972 after coming out in support of Latinka Perović and Marko Nikezić, leading figures of the so-called \"Serbian liberals [sr]\", a liberal faction within the SKJ's Serbian branch.[4]\n\nBregović's idea was to have Vukov sing the ballad \"Ružica si bila, sada više nisi\" (\"You Were Once a Little Rose\"). However, despite Vukov accepting, the plan never got implemented after the band's manager Marić got detained and interrogated by the police at the Sarajevo Airport upon returning from Zagreb where he had met with Vukov.[4]\n\nMića Popović's contribution to the album was to be his Dve godine garancije (A Two-Year Warranty) painting featuring a seemingly down-on-his-luck pensioner sleeping on a park bench while using pages of Politika newspaper as blanket to warm himself, which Bregović wanted to use as the album cover. When approached, Mića Popović also accepted though warning Bregović of possible problems the musician would likely face.[4] The album ended up featuring a photograph of Chinese social realist ballet on the cover.[5]\n\nFinally, Koča Popović was reportedly somewhat receptive to the idea of participating on the album, but still turned the offer down.[4]\n\nPlan B: Svetozar Vukmanović Tempo\n\n[edit]\n\nEventually, under pressure from the band's record label, Diskoton, Bregović gave up on his original idea and turned to alternative solutions.[5]\n\nSticking to the socialist-communist Yugoslavism overall theme, he decided to secure at least one aging pre-World War II Yugoslav revolutionary's appearance on the album. Reaching out to surviving individuals of that ilk was done through Duga journalist and writer Milomir Marić who had been known to keep contact with many of them as part of the preparatory work for his upcoming book Deca komunizma [sr] (Children of Communism). Bregović was able to get seventy-three-year-old Svetozar Vukmanović Tempo to agree, visiting him in his Reževići [sr] home and arranging for Tempo to travel to Sarajevo where—backed by the Ljubica Ivezić Orphanage choir—he recorded the old revolutionary song \"Padaj silo i nepravdo\" (\"Fall, (Oh) Force and Injustice\").[7]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nAll songs written by Goran Bregović, except where noted.\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nGoran Bregović - guitar, producer\n\nAlen Islamović - vocals\n\nZoran Redžić - bass guitar\n\nIpe Ivandić - drums\n\nVlado Pravdić - keyboards\n\nLaza Ristovski - keyboards\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nSvetozar Vukmanović Tempo - vocals (on track 1)\n\nAmila Sulejmanović [sr] - backing vocals\n\nAmela - backing vocals\n\nZumreta Midžić \"Zuzi Zu\" - backing vocals\n\nNenad Stefanović Japanac - bass guitar\n\nSinan Alimanović - keyboards\n\nSlobodan Sokolović - trombone\n\nBranko Podbrežnički - recorded by, mixed by\n\nDamir Begović - recorded by, mixed by\n\nVlado Perić - design\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album's biggest hits turned out to be \"Hajdemo u planine\", \"Noćas je k'o lubenica pun mjesec iznad Bosne\", \"A i ti me iznevjeri\" and ballads \"Te noći kad umrem, kad odem, kad me ne bude\" and \"Ružica si bila, sada više nisi\".[2] The subsequent promotional tour was also very successful with sold-out sports arenas across Yugoslavia.[2]\n\nBregović vs. Dragan Kremer\n\n[edit]\n\nLarge section of the critics, however, disliked Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo. In his Danas review, Dragan Kremer drew parallels between the developing economic and political crisis in SFR Yugoslavia and what he sees to be the band's ongoing creative crisis:\n\nUnfortunately, what makes this album so 'Yugoslav' mostly has to do with the crisis and lack of criteria, which are no longer possible to hide.[3]\n\nIn 1987, Kremer went further while appearing as guest on TV Sarajevo's show Mit mjeseca (Myth of the Month), a programme pitting Yugoslav rock critics against the country's rock stars—allowing critics to directly pose questions to musicians sitting across from them in the same studio. In the case of Kremer's appearance, however, Bregović wasn't in the studio due to being on tour—Kremer's taped questions were thus shown to Bregović while his reaction was filmed.[8] Expressing his dislike of the band's new album, Kremer looked into the camera and addressed Bregović directly:\n\nAs a man who adores records with an almost fetishist passion, I hate what I'm about to say and do, but I feel compelled to [still go ahead with it] as means of posing a question. All great authors usually have the same answer to this question, which is that all their works, regardless of type, are equally dear to them and equally good, but — is it possible that this album is your [Bregović's] ugliest and dumbest work?[9]\n\nUpon stating the above, Kremer tore up the Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo album cover.[9] A visibly angry Bregović reacted by cursing under his breath and launching into an insult-laden tirade directed at Kramer:\n\nIt's hard, even for a fool, to harbour ambitions of being liked by everyone, especially by these kinds of fat little pigs with sideburns who probably still masturbate on a regular basis in their forties. Even asking me to answer this pile of imbecilic questions, I mean.... But there's something that doesn't make sense here: we're about to go on a tour with 400,000 copies of this album already sold, which guys like this crap on regularly. So, either the people are fools, which would make what this guy's saying right or I'm still better at writing songs than he is at writing reviews\".[9][8]\n\nThe incident got a lot of attention in the Yugoslav media at the time with the angle of usually calm and collected Bregović losing his temper being the focus.[2]\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nVukmanović's appearance on the record gained attention of The Guardian, which described this move as \"some sort of Bregović's coup d'état\".[2]\n\nIn terms of individual tracks and their respective melodies, some in Yugoslavia have noted similarities between \"Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo\" and Survivor's 1982 hit \"Eye of the Tiger\" as well as between \"Zamisli\" and Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1985 track \"Jungle Man\".[10]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\n\"New Partisans\"\n\n[edit]\n\nAlongside Plavi Orkestar's Smrt fašizmu!, Merlin's Teško meni sa tobom (a još teže bez tebe), and Hari Mata Hari's Ne bi te odbranila ni cijela Jugoslavija [bs] Pljuni i zapjevaj, moja Jugoslavijo has occasionally been categorized as part of New Partisans, a mid-1980s collection of albums by Sarajevo-based bands, featuring sound centered on the Balkan folk-inspired pop rock music as well as containing either direct lyrical/visual references or allusions to Yugoslavism within communist and socialist patriotic framework.[5]\n\nThe term New Partisans was introduced during fall 1986 by Plavi Orkestar's manager Malkolm Muharem [sr], during Smrt fašizmu!'s promotional cycle as means of promoting his clients' latest release and potentially jump starting another (sub)cultural movement, similar to what he had participated in achieving three years earlier with the New Primitives. Unlike the New Primitive bands that all came from similar background and were of the same generation, the supposed New Partisan bands were much more disparate. Though the New Partisans never took off as a coherent movement, the term was nevertheless picked up by numerous Yugoslav journalists who continue to use it when describing various phases in Bijelo Dugme's, Dino Merlin's, Plavi Orkestar's and Hari Mata Hari's respective careers.[11]\n\nAccolades and retrospective reaction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to its successful commercial performance, over the decades since its release, Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo made a number of Yugoslav pop-rock all-time lists in different categories.\n\nIn the 1998 book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike, Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo was ranked 53rd on the list of 100 Greatest Yugoslav Rock and Pop Albums.[1]\n\nIn 2015, Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo album cover was ranked 3rd on the 100 Greatest Album Covers of Yugoslav Rock list published by web magazine Balkanrock.[12]\n\nFurthermore, the album gained retrospective significance in the context of the breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars. In 2016, looking back on Goran Bregović's overall career and specifically Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo within it, Politika columnist Aleksandar Apostolovski wistfully opined that \"due to seeing Yugoslavia as an inseparable part of his being, Bregović was convinced his own Partisan aesthetic dressed up in rock'n'roll arrangements, with even the Communist International's enforcer Svetozar Vukmanović Tempo taking part on the microphone, would stop the country's disintegration\".[13]\n\nCovers\n\n[edit]\n\nHit tracks off Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo—primarily \"Ružica si bila\" and \"A i ti me iznevjeri\"—saw a number of covers, mostly by performers from the newly-established, post-Yugoslav countries. Additionally, Bregović himself repackaged some of the songs for his collaborations with Iggy Pop and Sezen Aksu.\n\nSerbian folk singer Ana Bekuta recorded a cover of \"A i ti me iznevjeri\" on her 1993 album Pitaš me kako živim (You're Asking Me How I Live).[14]\n\nIn 1993, Bregović composed the soundtrack for Emir Kusturica's surrealist drama Arizona Dream, including a new version of \"Hajdemo u planine\" titled \"Get The Money\" with English language lyrics and sung by Iggy Pop.[15]\n\nSerbian ensemble Fejat Sejdić Trumpet Orchestra recorded a cover of \"Hajdemo u planine\" on their 1994 album Na Dragačevskom saboru orkestara u Guči (On the Guča Trumpet Festival).[16]\n\nTurkish pop singer Sezen Aksu recorded covers of \"Te noći kad umrem, kad odem, kad me ne bude\", \"A i ti me iznevjeri\", and \"Ružica si bila, sada više nisi\" with Turkish lyrics—titled \"Allah'ın Varsa\", \"Kasım Yağmurları\", and \"Gül\", respectively—on her 1997 Bregović-produced album Düğün ve Cenaze.\n\nCroatian pop singer Alka Vuica recorded a cover of \"Ružica si bila, sada više nisi\", entitled \"Ružica\", on her 2001 album Profesionalka (Professional Girl).[17]\n\nSerbian folk singer Usnija Redžepova recorded a cover of \"A i ti me iznevjeri\" on her 2007 album Oko Niša kiša (Rain around Niš).[18]\n\nBosnian and Yugoslav rock band Teška Industrija recorded a cover of \"A i ti me iznvjeri\" on their 2010 album Bili smo raja (We Were Pals).[19]\n\nBosnian and Yugoslav pop singer Zuzi Zu, who sung backing vocals on Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo, recorded a cover of \"Ružica si bila\", releasing it as a single in 2011.[20]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
