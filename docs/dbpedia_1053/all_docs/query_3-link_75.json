        "text": "The Honorable Ban Ki-Moon\n\nSecretary General\n\n760 United Nations Plaza\n\nUnited Nations\n\nNew York, NY 10017\n\nREF: The Drina March apology\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nThe first Allied victory of the World War I, The Battle of Cer [Mountain], opened the door towards the end of The Great War and creation of The League of Nations, predecessor of The UN.\n\nThat is exactly what The Drina March represents, fighting for freedom regardless of the odds. Individuals who objected to The Drina March belong to a group that fought against the Allies in both World Wars.\n\nUN apology for The Drina March being performed in The UN is an affront to millions of Allies who gave their lives in WWI for freedom.\n\nSerbs as people never demographically recovered from the loss of 56% of male population in WWI, leading to the additional loss of up to one million in WWII. By UN Genocide Convention, it is Genocide by attrition. That is what the complaint about The Drina March was all about - the fear that the truth will come out.\n\nMedia battle cry \"Serben Muss Sterben\" (The Serbs must die) in 1914 announced this genocide and such racist cries continue to the present day. UN apology is creating a new wave of anti-Serb media reports bordering on racism.\n\nLiving behind barbed wire is already reality for the Serbs in UN-governed Kosovo. After this apology, what Serbs can expect next from The UN, a new text of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights that adds \"except Serbs\" to all articles?\n\nYour Excellency, UN apology to anti-Serb racists who prefer to goose step to the tune of Die Fahne Hoch was misguided, factually inaccurate and morally wrong.\n\nYou owe an apology. To the Serbs and all Allied nations."
