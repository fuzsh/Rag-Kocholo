I’m Apache, and I am president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. I’m representing Marlon Brando this eve- ning, and he has asked me to tell you . . . that he very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the [reason] for this being . . . the treatment of American Indians today by the film indus- try.” - From the 1972 Academy Awards show Let us now praise famous men and famous women; let us praise as well men and women not famous, and even some of those infamous. The theme of all this is best summed up in a line from John Ford’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: “When the legend becomes the fact, print the legend.” Brando gave Littlefeather a three-page statement to read at the Academy Awards if he won the best actor category for his performance in The Godfather. Alerted to this, the event’s organizer searched Littlefeather out to tell her she could only make a brief statement. Brando won. Littlefeather came out in a 1903 white buckskin ceremonial gown. As she came onstage, even before she began to speak, there was considerable audience noise; everyone was wondering what was up. Then she made the statement above. Well before she finished, the audience began booing loudly. Obviously, this proved to be one of the Oscars’ all-time most controversial moments. It was a typical later-Brando gesture: all theatrics and misdirection, lacking substance but still excit- ing the desired dialogue. Charles Champlin offered one of the most reasoned views on it, writing, “The question is whether the gesture, in all its arrogant sincerity, succeeds in dramatiz- ing or trivializing the problem.” He followed with, “Say what you will about him, he’s an electrifying non-presence as well as an electrifying presence.” The nonappearance added to the Brando mystique and myth. On the other hand, it ended up causing Littlefeather enormous, life-changing problems. Unfortunately, the first investigations into her life turned up inaccurate information indicating she was not an American Indian - that her father was Filipino and her mother was white. This was wrong, but although there was more accurate later reporting, it was never really corrected in the public’s mind. Instead, that she was a phony became accepted as fact and is still regularly reported as such. She was an American Indian and had long been involved in related activists’ causes, which is how she met Brando. The truth in this kind of context was nearly meaningless. It won’t be surprising if we receive letters arguing she was not an American Indian, citing the early reporting. People often want to believe the worst about others; many find pure joy in the accusation. page two II “How can I hate John Wayne upholding Goldwater and yet love him tenderly when he r sweeps Natalie Wood into his arms in the last reel of The Searchers ?” -]ean-Luc Godard There are artists - the creative talents - and then there is their art, their work. Obviously, anyone can respond to creative work in any way he or she wants, as the very purpose of such work is to elicit exactly those kinds of individual reactions. It is unnerving and troubling when there is an organized effort to attack art or speech because the view- point represented runs counter to the beliefs of one group or another. This is even more alarming when this assault is based not on the content of the work but is a reaction to the personal beliefs of the creative talent. A terrible - and, to a real extent, terrifying - example of this was the Dixie Chicks incident, when Natalie Maines’ relatively tame slight of President George W Bush inspired pundits and country deejays to launch an all-out assault on the band. Compared to the weight of the comment, the intensity of these attacks was astonishing, as more blood was poured in the water to intensify the frenzy of the many sharks gathered. In the name of patriotism, there was this organized assault on the Dixie Chicks in an effort to punish them for what had been said. In this context, it is always especially interesting to consider John Wayne. A dominant, totemic American figure, he person- ifies to many everything great about this country; many others regard him as a hardcore-American, right-wing reactionary. hi The many ways in which creative work makes meaning for those who experience it are rarefy as direct or specific as both supporters and critics often argue. When a film or novel or TV show gets inside your head, the way it resonates, and the ideological seeds thus planted, is really not dependent on the creators’ intentions. In some cases, those may be richer and more insidious; in others, they are surprisingly direct. The John Ford-directed Westerns, frequently starring Wayne, that I watched growing up proved to be powerful influences on my moral education and my understanding of this country. I care not a whit for Wayne’s personal politics, but the actions and dignity of Wayne onscreen still strongly inform my sensibility. The American film Western has proven one of the richest areas in the culture for metaphoric evocations of the classic American philosophical conflict between the freedoms of indi- viduals and their responsibilities to the greater community. IV “I don’t know if I should present this award on behalf of all the cowboys shot in John Ford Westerns over the years.” - Clint Eastwood’s comment at the 1972 Academy Awards show as he followed Littlefeather In any number of ways, Clint Eastwood’s response was unfortunate, from its awkward construction to its rather silly point. Undeniably, many Ford films participate in the standard, stereotypical presentation of the American Indian. In one of his masterpieces, the above-mentioned The Searchers (1956), there is a truly offensive bit that is supposed to be humorous, wherein a squaw is kicked so that she rolls down a small hill. Films like Fort Apache, however, were crucial steps toward presenting a fairer version of Western history, especially in regard to American Indians. Ford personally befriended and helped support the native tribes in the areas where he shot. He knew civilization was a step forward and necessary, but he didn’t trust it. In many of his later Westerns, he explored the irony that those who tamed the West were inherently so psychotic that there was no place for them in the world they helped create. Unfortunately, the aura of Wayne has always been so great that subtlety regarding his performances has been lost: Broad acceptance or derisive dismal have been the dominant reac- tions. The intensity of those who hate Wayne has often unfairly stained many of those who worked with him, no one more than Ford. Certainly, Ford was a fan of the military, but this never impaired his sophisticated understanding of the irresolvable contradictions in the conflict between freedom and order. Currently, those who make the most regular and extreme moral judgments about others are all too often not actors in ongoing political and social dramas. They are rocking-chair moralists, so comfortable with their own correctness that they feel justified criticizing the opinions and beliefs of oth- ers. Since many have rarefy been in the kinds of extreme situ- ations in which one’s ideals are actually put to the test, their certainty as to how pure and uncompromising they would be has never been vetted. continued on p.6 ; m ^VGABjDUT. jSiewpr the neiirtCeninra- , Matt Schlirr*- ^ut of retirement to *1 c^mpietaly be KtV §*cJi hiVn ifi &f ' jrtaM .

The effects of McCarthyism on the Hollywood film industry were horrifying in that so many were compro- mised by their own cowardice. Standing firm for honor and ideals in that environment was far more risky than being thought a witch in Salem. The director Cecil B. DeMille led a group that wanted to force every member of the of the Directors Guild of America to sign a loyalty oath. Joseph Mankiewicz was the president of the DGA. Hand-in-glove with the push for the oath was a campaign of innuendo suggesting that Mankiewicz was a communist sympathizer. At the climactic meeting where the membership was to finally vote on the oath, DeMille and his supporters spoke for hours about patriotic loyalty. All those attending were well aware that the vote would also be about Mankiewicz’s tenure. After those hours of speechifying, Ford stood up and spoke: “My name’s John Ford. I make Westerns. I don’t think there’s anyone in this room who knows more about what the American public wants than Cecil B. DeMille - and he certainly knows how to give it to them. ... But I don’t like you, C.B. I don’t like what you stand for, and I don’t like what you’ve been saying here tonight.” The vote that followed was overwhelmingly against the loyalty oath. ■ Postmarks SOUND ORDINANCE HURTS LIVE MUSIC Dear Editor, On Thursday evening [June 4] between 8 and 10pm, my band the Gourds performed a free show at Shady Grove on Barton Springs Road. As a crane pivoted overhead like something from an H.G. Wells novel, Shady Grove was cited for a sound-ordinance violation. The irony was not lost on anyone there. In its race, which is already lost, to move people Downtown, this city is going to lose something that cannot be replaced. Music in Austin is a well-known quality-of-life element that draws unique people and businesses to live here. It is remarkable that up until now we have been able to maintain such a vibrant musical scene with the artificially overvalued real estate market. Before we lose control of it, the sound ordinance needs to be replaced by neighborhood-specific agree- ments between businesses and residents. In a rapidly growing city like ours, the police and fire resources wasted on call and response to this nonissue is ridiculous. And when it is more acceptable to have cranes undertaking major construction projects than it is to have a local band playing music for the citizens of Austin, I think we are at a serious crossroads. I hereby call on all musicians, music industry profes- sionals, and supporters of local music to make some serious noise about this issue. If we do not, then those who call it “noise” will have their way. And all will be lost. Kevin Russell The Gourds/Shinyribs VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS Dear Editor, The fact that the city of Austin has pulled the original request for proposal in favor of creating a new one, that they are listening to input from the crowd, and that a group of motivated and technically savvy Austin citizens are ready to contribute to the effort are very positive devel- opments [“The Genius of the Crowd ... Source,” News, June 5]. Thank you, William Hurley, for coordinating the OpenAustin effort, and thank you to the other Austinites who have passion- ately worked to shed the light of day on this process so far. Please go to OpenAustin.org and share your thoughts for how a city known for technical and cultural innovation should engage online with its citizens. Chris Almond HIPSTERS OVERLOOK BATTEN Dear Editor, Wow. I cannot believe the Chronicle missed this! A musician was in town Monday night who is one of the best guitarists in the world today. There was not even a mention, a clip, or even a smart-ass comment about the show. Her name is Jennifer Batten. Surely you guys have heard of her. Oh, I forgot, anyone with the ability to play guitar with any talent/taste is not hip in the Chronicle’s world of the same old singer- songwriter, punk, and hip-hop rap crap we are exposed to each week.

A revised request for proposal will be issued in July. A great article [“The Genius of the Crowd ... Source,” News, June 5]. But I think there is one big miss in the reporting: the Twitter activation process that paused City Council in their tracks. When the issue was initially broadcast on Twitter, the Thursday before the Friday vote by the City Council, a group of Tweeters began rallying the troops to demand a halt to the Cignex award.

At this point William Hurley and #OpenAustin or OpenAustin.org did not exist. There is a large number of posts (also predat- ing Hurley’s press-aware, press-friendly entree into the dis- cussion) that outline the situation and what the community response was that killed the Cignex request for proposals fiasco. You can find links to those articles on an alternative #COAWebsite site, www.meterthis.net. I encourage every- one to join their voices together on the OpenAustin idea platform, and I hope that the June 18 meeting with the City Council is productive. I look forward to a healthy RFP process once the new criteria is released in July. A lot of people are interested in participating. I know I am. John McElhenney CROWD GENIUS? OR GROUPTHINK? Dear Editor, Re: “The Genius of the Crowd ... Source” [News, June 5]: Genius of the crowd? Or groupthink? When we get City Council killing a project based on a few dozen squeaky Tweets, we’ll really bring government to a standstill. It all sounds so good and happy on paper, this crowd- sourcing hooey with its technical hand-waving, until some- one actually has to build, test, and maintain 42 different SQL queries that talk to some legacy, proprietary database - for one city department. (Cleanup on aisle 10. “No way. I don’t do 10.” - the Gourds.) How about the dozens of meetings for that one department to figure out the busi- ness logic of who has view, edit, and publish rights for that department’s area of the website? Is that logic already built into the Plone system? Has staff been trained on the Plone system? Maybe there’s a reason that was a requirement. This will be an ugly, complicated technical challenge and an equally ugly, complicated business challenge. So many different departments, databases, con- stituencies, and approval chains. Let’s get legal involved too. Think there are any privacy issues here with granting citizen volunteers access to fund financial information, crime incident reports, payroll, Social Security numbers, etc.? Methinks $800,000 is a bargain and would have been gladly paid to any company not based in the Silicon Valley. Say Austin-based Vignette, the world leader in CMS, curiously silent in this. No doubt they steered clear of this train wreck for a reason. “Hurley has since stepped down from the ... organization team.” Nice. Thanks for slipping the new website out three years. Bill Kilday TAKEN BY PYRATES Dear Editor, Re: “Thwack!” [Earache! Music blog, June 8]: This is the best group I’ve seen in a long, long while. The Dead Pyrates Society will blow you out of the water! John Staehely can play guitar that will put most guitarists to shame, and the rest of the band can keep up with the best of them; Joe Kennedy can sing and put on a show like no other. I have their CD, and I can’t get enough of them. I’ve seen them in Austin, Dallas, and I think once in Fort Worth. So if you want to see the same old rock & roll bands, don’t go see this group, but if you want something that will blow you away, you have to go see the Dead Pyrates Society.

It’s not planned for Webberville but in Hornsby-Dunlap, a unique area with real agriculture, old and new residential neighborhoods, and green businesses like the tree farm and the native plant nursery that is within the city’s 2-mile extra-territorial jurisdiction. The proposed mine includes property on which three major creeks (Decker, Elm, and Gilleland) come together and flow into the Colorado River. This is a historical area surrounding what they call the Hunter Mansion, built in 1859. The mined property includes the cemetery where James Gilleland is buried. The neigh- borhood has been residential at least since the Hunter Mansion was built. Now new neighbors that have invested in homes recently approved are facing the possibility of a 2,000-acre gravel pit across the road. These homes are not low-income, but they represent the life savings and entire portfolio for most of us. Of course we are wor- ried about property values, along with health and safety issues of a mine and a 4-mile field conveyor next door. The TXI-hosted forums mentioned were a joke. I hope Commissioner Ron Davis will keep his promise about having a serious debate with all of us in the Hornsby-Dunlap neighborhood about the compatibility of this proposed TXI pit mine project with the residential area already there. Richard Macdonald SCIENCE, RELIGION SEPARATE TOPICS Dear Mr. Black, In response to your “Return to Forever” article [“Page Two,” May 29], I have a few concerns. While your article skips around, covering many topics, you did recall the same old issues that seem to get nowhere. Science and religion are two separate topics: Science is a way of thinking about our world, and religion is a way of believing about our world. It is indeed tunnel vision to think the two are linked or that they contradict each other. However, in your statement, “Certainly, the 24-hour Earth day in which we travel around the sun in no way restricts the creator,” you incorrectly stated scientific fact. Our 24-hour Earth day is a result of one Earth rotation on its axis, not revolving around the sun (which is equal to one Earth year) as you claim. Research shows that the average American is basically scien- tifically illiterate. For example, more than half of Americans do not know what causes the seasons nor understand the role of DNA and genes in heredity. Any discussion of evolution and creation- ism must first include scientific fact. Perhaps if our citizenry knew more about our planet and the diversity of living organisms on it, this debate would indeed be over. Sincerely , Julie Wasserman Science educator [Louis Black responds: The 24-hour Earth day comment was a stupid mistake on my part. The Chronicle's usually so vigilant proofers missed it as well. The column accepted that science and religion are two separate topics but argued that they weren’t inher- ently contradictory.] CONTINUED ON P.12 Even if your friends find out.

Of course not.” So now there’s a battle of footnotes? Well, what about the quality of the information contained therein? Does that count for anything? I’m not the one who dropped off the book, The Fluoride Deception by Christopher Bryson, but I have read it. The footnotes Mr. Black derides come from a decade of deep research by a determined BBC correspondent who, like himself, started out with no opinion and scant interest in the assignment that had been handed him. Bryson’s footnotes come from the archives of the likes of Boston’s Forsyth Institute, the Carnegie Institution, the University of Rochester, Sloan-Kettering, the U.S. Department of Defense, private collections of long-dead scientist-bureaucrats, and personal interviews with nonagenarians (including Edward Bernays, the “father of public relations” and author of Propaganda) who helped design and market the fluoridation scheme. Pro-fluoride publications thick with footnotes certainly abound, but none I’ve come across boast the caliber of this documenta- tion. While everyone is entitled to their opinion or no opinion at all, it hardly makes sense to dismiss a book one hasn’t read by comparison with a second, purely hypothetical book one also hasn’t read. This shows ignorance of the learning process - the steps by which we come to place our trust in one source over another. People might rather study The Fluoride Deception side by side with some of the American Dental Association’s and Centers for Disease Control’s promotional tracts (e.g., ADA’s \"Fluoridation Facts,” easily available online) and then decide for themselves whose footnotes most persuade. Rae Nadler-Olenick TAX REVOLT TIME Dear Editor, Central Taxus, if you’re not mad as hell about your property tax rates, consider that your counterparts in another Sun Belt state, Florida, pay one-third of what you pay! From personal experience, I can tell you that life is not appreciably better here for the taxes we pay. Under current economic conditions, a property tax freeze should be immediately instituted. After meeting with the Travis County property appraiser’s office and getting nowhere, I am fuming. Like many others, my home is being measured against outdated peak sales data. With mount- ing foreclosures in my area, were I to try to resell my home now, I would experience at least a 10% loss. Further, May’s 9.4% unem- ployment data is alarming, and it fails to reflect nontabulated unemployment rolls, corporate salary cuts, the underemployed, or others who have just given up! It’s time for bloated government wages - federal, state, county, and city - to be carefully reviewed and trimmed. If cor- porations can do it, so can we! The Flouston Chronicle recently published a searchable list of all state employee wages. It is clear that many state workers are paid handsomely by com- parison to the private sector - not even considering perks and benefits that go far beyond retirement - at our expense. My neighbor, who barely works 40 hours a week, is listed as a “manager” for the Department of Housing & Community Affairs, is not college-educated, and is paid a taxpayer-funded salary of $71,000. A further insult: The state of Texas paid out $25 mil- lion in “bonuses” in 2008 alone. Balderdash! To research state salaries, visit the Houston Chronicle site: “2008 state of Texas public employee salaries.” It’s time for a Central Texas tax revolt, wouldn’t you say?

Gov. Rick Perry acknowledged the inevitable on Tuesday and said he’s planning for a special session, date and agenda TBD. Later that day, he went mountain biking and broke his collar- bone. See our Lege wrap-up (almost), p.24. Following a shooting that left eight people injured, hip-hop and dance club Spiros announced it would not reopen. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission shuttered the club for a week after the incident, and soon after, Spiros voluntarily surrendered its liquor license. See “Off the Record,” Music, p.53. Budgeting frenzy begins, as City Manager Marc Ott released this week some $45 million in pos- sible city budget cuts for the next fiscal year, and public forums began for the rest of us to decide what we can do without - police, pools, parks ... it’s a sobering list. See “City Hall Hustle,” p.16. missioned efficiency study of the district, which suggested (among other things) that we could save a lot of money by closing schools, limiting pre-K, and ending art and music. See “AISD ‘Efficiency’ Study,” p.18. Local news and talk radio have all gone agog over the recently released video of Kathryn Wink- fein, a 72-year-old grand- mother, being Tasered by Precinct 3 Deputy Constable Christopher Bieze after she became belligerent during a traffic stop. As the Taser’s supposedly an alternative to deadly force, does that mean Bieze would’ve had to shoot her otherwise? (We think not.) Media Watch The Hightower Report Lege Aftermath The AISD board of trustees received its com- Flanked by oil and gas industry reps, Gov. Perry denounced the Obama administration for attempting to do something about greenhouse gas emissions, saying the science “hasn’t solid- ified” and any regulation would “wreck the Texas economy.” He didn’t mention the huge Texas con- tribution to global carbon emissions, nor the expanding Texas drought that may have its latest roots in global warming. Right on time, the Republic of Texas Biker Rally arrives in Austin this weekend, with thou- sands of belching motorcycles contributing their bit to Austin’s C0 2 and ozone, likely pushing the city over the edge to noncompliance with federal regulations for the year. Monday June 8 was the one-year anniversary of the burning of the Governor’s Mansion, still a hulking wreck just south of the Capitol. It’s not rebuilt yet because the Texas millionaires who said they would raise the money privately couldn’t do so - the Lege decided we could rebuild it with federal stimulus money instead. Maybe some of the unemployed Texas workers denied insurance by Gov. Perry’s intransigence can get construction jobs rebuilding his house. Former prosecutor and candidate for district attor- ney Mindy Montford was arrested last weekend on a public intoxication charge. According to reports, Montford was a passenger in a car that was pulled over after a minor mishap. As an offi- cer was questioning the driver, Montford got out of the car and tried to advise the driver of his rights. The officer ordered her back in the car, from where she was later arrested. As we sit down to balance the books, we might consider our largest deficits BY MICHAEL KING Budget cutting is everywhere. This week City Manager Marc Ott released the city’s cheerfully titled “Menu of Potential Budget Reductions,” a daunting $45 million list of things Austin probably shouldn’t do without, but will likely learn to do so at least to the tune of $30 million (making up the rest in property taxes). The Austin ISD board of trustees just received its “efficiency study” from the good folks at MGT of America, suggesting that if the district really, really tightens its belt, it could save $392 million over the next five years (see “AISD ‘Efficiency’ Study,” p.18). The state doesn’t deal in efficiency studies - other than the Sunset process it mostly ignores - so legislators huffed and puffed about frugality, crossed their fingers, and then patched this year’s quiet financial disaster with federal stimulus funding. Nationally the news is much the same - the Obama administration, while it pours money into failing banks and other financial institutions (I know, we’ve got to prime the pump), is now promoting a return to “pay as you go” federal point austi 1 budgeting so that the inherited Bush deficit doesn’t get so unmanageable as to make impossible health- care reform and similar national needs. I’m all for watching the pennies - at the Chronicle, we’re shrinking from bad times like everybody else, and just listen to the shuddering of my 15-year- old Honda - but there’s a depressing same- ness to these debates that’s not entirely due to the fact that we’re generally broke. For one thing, there’s the hang- over factor. Sensible economists began warning in the Nineties that we couldn’t ride this financial bubble forever, then came two massive, extended wars of choice that devastated other countries and our youth, even as they pumped more hot air into the economy. There were dim-bulb variations of the same argument on the state level, especially about Sacred Texas Highways: “You’ll charge tolls over our dead bodies,” went the public refrain, and, “You damn well better not raise the gas tax” - but hey, why in hell aren’t you building any more “free” suburban-flight highways? CONTINUED ON P.17 QUOTE of the WEEK “There’s just no fat. This is a menu of options that hit the bone ... none of them come lightly.” - Assistant City Manager Michael McDonald, intro- ducing a smorgasbord of potential cuts in the city budget.

His chief of staff will be Mark Nathan, the political consultant who directed Leffing- well’s campaign; he also worked on the campaigns of five of the council’s current members. Nancy Williams, executive assistant in Leffingwell’s council member office, will retain that role; she’s a former director of the Texas Democratic Party. Returning to City Hall from Capital Metro is Matt Curtis, who will be an executive aide. Curtis was previously an aide to Mayor Will Wynn and to Council Member Brewster McCracken. Amy Everhart, who worked on the Leffingwell campaign and for the campaigns of Council Members Jennifer Kim and Mike Martinez, will leave her post at the Sierra Club to serve as a policy aide. Lastly, Leffingwell’s current execu- tive secretary, Janet Jackson, will stay on in her role (barring any wardrobe malfunctions). “I feel very fortunate to have such a seasoned team of public servants and community activists join the Mayor’s Office,” said Leffingwell in a press release, adding he would also soon name the members of his Community Cabinet, an advisory group of community leaders he promised during the campaign to create. - Wells Dunbar > COURTING NEW URBANISM Incoming Council Member Chris Riley has chosen Marisa Balias as his policy aide (a second aide is yet to be named). The pick underscores Riley’s commit- ment to urban design and planning; Balias holds a master’s degree in community and regional planning from UT-Austin, with a concentration on urban development and public partici- pation in community planning. She’s coming to City Hall from Black + Vernooy Architects/Placemaking Studio, where she worked with Sinclair Black on sustainable building for mixed- use urban infill projects. She’s also worked on downtown dis- trict master planning and redevelopment projects in Detroit. For the Congress for the New Urbanism national conference in Austin last year, Balias edited Emergent Urbanism: Evolution in Urban Form , Texas, a book showcasing Central Texas. What with the Downtown Plan and Comprehensive Plan under way, among other major initiatives, Balias’ skill set could shore up City Hall’s loss of New Urbanists Brewster McCracken and aide Rachel ProctoMVIay. Meanwhile, Proctor-May is expect- ed to take a new position coordinating the Pecan Street Project for Austin Energy. - Katherine Gregor BYRON MARSHALL TO VIRGINIA? The Richmond Times- Dispatch reported last week that Byron Marshall, president of the Austin Revitalization Authority, is in the running to be named Richmond’s chief administrative officer, the top ranking staff post in the city’s bureaucracy. Marshall has run the ARA, a nonprofit community land corporation contracted with the city to revitalize East 11th and 12th streets, since 1999. Prior to that, he was an assistant city manager for Austin and Atlanta’s chief operating officer. Critics of the ARA have charged that the agency has responded slowly to com- munity needs, built overpriced office space, and lacks trans- parency; the agency is currently under a performance audit. The Times-Dispatch has called attention to some unflattering chapters in Marshall’s career, including his resignation as Atlanta’s COO once it emerged he “held a $96,000 consult- ing contract with an economic-development authority in Austin.” This week, Times-Dispatch columnist Michael Paul Williams said Marshall, Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones’ “trial balloon for a top city post,” was “taking some hits and losing altitude.” One Richmond council member said Marshall, if officially nominated, shouldn’t be approved until the ARA audit is completed. - W. D. THE REAPER COMETH The budget chips are falling - here’s your chance to weigh in BY WELLS DUNBAR Some things you can’t escape. The Hustle was on a Fun Ship cruise with his better half last week, leaving behind the Sturm und Drang of municipal governance for the 24-hour pizza station and sunburned feet. Leaving behind Austin - or so he thought. Returning from an excursion through Jamaica, he overheard some fellow zip-lin- ers raving about their new home. While they love California, they became enraptured with Austin while visiting and moved there. Besides, the houses were so expensive back in San Francisco. Thanks to you, now they’re just as expensive here! But a look at the city’s ledgers reveals, unfortunately, Aus- tin would do well to attract more of my tax-generating Silicon Valley friends. This week, the city released a list of about 240 potential cuts - “menu items” in municipal parlance - which in all would whittle some $45 million from the city budget. The potential total is larger than the actual shortfall Austin faces, between $30 million and $43 million (depending on whether the city sets property taxes at the current “nominal” rate or increases them to the slightly higher “rollback” rate, the high- est state law allows without a special election). The breathing room, if you can call it that, is because we face some difficult choices: “There’s just no fat,” Assistant City Manager Michael McDonald told a City Hall press corps briefing. Describing how city services never fully recovered from the last round of cuts - made during the last downturn, the post-9/11 crash from 2002 to 2004 - he emphasized: “This is a menu of options that hit the bone, as the city manager would say. None of them come lightly.” All city departments examined ways to cut 7% from their budgets; public safety departments, which already consume two-thirds of the entire General Fund budget, were asked to cut 3.5%. While the Hustle will crunch the numbers all summer and beyond, through the budget presentation in July and to its approval in September, here are several areas of primary inter- est, including both cost savings and revenue increases: POLICE - $8.7 million: Canceling the 2010 cadet training class would realize the most savings, $5.2 million, and the most controversy, because it would mean reduced staffing for specialized units like DWI and organized crime. Reducing over- time would realize $1.2 million in savings but could affect “hotspot” programs designed to monitor high-crime areas. Less fruitful but closer to home: $120,000 in waived fees for security support of the South by Southwest Festival (co- owned by Chronicle chieftains Nick Barbaro and Louis Black) are also on the potential chopping block. FIRE - $4.5 million: Converting two engines to medical response units (most fire calls are medical emergencies) would save $1.24 million but immediately engenders com- cits hall ustl See the “short” list of potential city budget reductions with this story at austinchronicle.com; for the very long list ; see www.cityofaustin.org/budget. plaints of taking firefighters off trucks. Eliminating special pay incentives for firefighters with special certification and bilingual training saves $1.73 million. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES - $5.3 million: EMS can save $250,000 by reducing contributions to an Austin Community College program designed to increase minority candidates for EMS jobs. But the agency’s centerpiece would be a bump in cost for ambulance fees - from $515 to $772.50 - which would raise Austin to the 75th percentile, costwise, of peer cities city staff examined. This specific measure comes before City Council for enabling approval this Thursday, June 11. TRANSPORTATION - $3.5 million: A 52-cent increase in the transportation user fee, that arcane charge on utility bills cov- ering road maintenance, is being considered in addition to a previously planned $1.14 hike, bringing the total to $1.66. HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES - $2.9 million: Proposed cuts include shifting the funding of a $200,000 free pet-sterilization program to donations, permanently shuttering the already-closed south day labor site (saving another budgeted $200,000), and seeking alternate funding of $300,000 for a summer youth employment pro- gram, possibly through federal stimulus bucks. PARKS & RECREATION - $2.8 million: Closing outright two lesser-used pools and replacing seven older park pools with low-main- tenance splash fountains for children could save $160,000. Cutting 11 supervised sum- mer playground programs would save $100,000, and a $5 fee on most nights of the Trail of Lights for those 11 and older would collect $250,000 to offset event costs. LIBRARY - $1.8 million: Several reductions proposed here: opening branches an hour later and closing an hour earlier ($700,000), similarly reducing Central Library hours ($130,000), reducing the books budget ($160,000), and reducing library maintenance ($180,000). EMPLOYEE FURLOUGH - $1.1 million: The city is mulling a program whereby city employees could take time off for which they wouldn’t be paid. The proposal would not apply to uni- formed public safety personnel. Of course, all the above are only proposals, although it’s clear from their overall scope and severity, drastic cuts will invariably be made. Don’t let that happen without your partici- pation.

But like any good prog, I’m gung ho on city services and public schools. “Sorry,” say the folks in charge - we’ve got to pay the piper there, too. This week city staff is passing out poker chips for us to play with in our own little budget forums (see “City Hall Hustle,” p.16), and they’re not the sort of chips that you can cash in for real money at the end of the evening. I’m both looking forward to and dreading those forums. Perhaps at least some previously uninformed taxpayers will learn how diffi- cult it is to balance a public budget in hard times. Nevertheless, the people who most need the lesson will likely stay home, poised at their keyboards, blasting everybody in cyber range for “waste and fraud” and mis- placed priorities - that is, for spending money on anything but what the typist thinks is worthwhile. For some weeks, for example, my e-mail has been angrily salted by the neighbor- hood police advocates, who oppose cutting one dime from the public safety bud- gets even though police, fire, and EMS now consume two-thirds of the city’s oper- ating funds, with a bullet toward three-fourths. Would 90% - I suppose there has to be something left over for streets and sewers - be more to their liking? Yet some of the very same people, I was not sur- prised to see, were featured in TV and radio news bites this week complaining that their neighborhoods might have to do without some park resources or swimming pools or library hours this summer. Hey, if you need recreation, there are always squad-car ride-alongs. My predecessor and colleague in this office, Mike Clark-Madison, used to polite- ly point out to City Council that in good times, instead of the timid rollback rates, the city might consider tax rates that would actually bank money for real, future resource needs. Don’t worry, nobody ever listened to him. Bitter Aftertaste The only point I’m making, in my curmud- geonly way, is that in our current circum- stances there really are going to be no easy budget choices. We’ve already had spirited internal arguments here about the AISD effi- ciency study, which ranges from sensible notes about purchasing matters or administra- tive featherbedding to cancellation of music, art, and physical education classes to school closures. That’s the Starbucks approach, close some franchises - we could really save a great deal of money if we just closed every last one of them, altogether. Or we could just put the custodial staff on 10-month wages, thereby both saving taxpayers’ money and increasing the percentage of poverty-status children in the schools, all at one blow. Over the next few weeks and months, we’ll be reporting in detail on the city budget delib- erations as well as the school district’s fiscal debates, sure to be made more interesting by the ascension of a new council and the arrival of a new school superintendent with her own perspective and priorities. Certainly one of the reasons for commissioning the MGT study dike the city’s preliminary “Menu”) was to provide the admin- istration with political cover for whatever cuts are finally made; they’re quite unlikely to reach the dra- conian potential of the report, so we’ll all be able to say we fended off the wolves at the door and can return to busi- ness as usual, bloody but unbowed. Years ago, those noisy peaceniks were warning that if the country wasn’t concerned about international peace and justice, we should at least be concerned about the always sacred bottom line. We were told that the cost for our endless wars abroad would inevitably come home to our states, our cit- ies, our hospitals, our schools. Considering what we’ve cost the hapless and devastated citizens of the countries of our “enemies,” there is perhaps some small justice in realiz- ing that at least the financial chickens have finally begun to come home to roost. But the taste remains bitter - and it is likely to be with us for a very long time. ■ In our current circumstances, there really are going to be no easy budget choices.

District staff will make a formal response to the study in August, but special assistant to the superintendent Milan Sevak argued that MGT missed a core part of their charge. He quoted from the study’s executive report: “The goal of the study was to identify opportunities for reductions in expenditures without adversely affecting student academic performance, losing District productivity, or reducing the quality of services’ - there are several examples, and they themselves note that pre-K is one of them that would have an impact on student performance.” Although the final deci- sions lie with the district, he said, “There’s no sense of the report organizing it by, These are the ones that we really don’t recommend.’” Similarly, Torres questioned MGT’s “tried and tested meth- odology” of using abstract “best practices” and restricting ser- vice provision to statutory mini mums as a way to cut costs rather than by evaluating how best the district can reach its goals. “The only thing that I can think of is, To a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail,”’ he concluded. - Richard Whittaker AISD ‘Efficiency’ Study: Not Exactly What the Doctor Ordered? Last August, Austin Independent School District commis- sioned an “efficiency study” from consultants MGT of America, in theory to provide material for discussing new directions and potential cost savings for the district. But this week - after the firm delivered a list of up to $392 million in potential savings over the next five years - district staff and the board of trustees are suddenly holding the report at arm’s length and treating it like an uninvited guest. All the materials in the report, especially the proposed cuts - as both the district and MGT point out repeatedly - are sim- ply “options” that the district can adopt or ignore. AISD board Vice President Vince Torres, one of the early advocates for commissioning this analysis, disagrees even with calling it an efficiency study. He explained, “I’m an engineer, and efficien- cy means achieving the maximum output for the minimum input.” The real purpose of the study, he said, was to “devel- op an objective way of showing the taxpayers that we’re spending their money wisely.” The report does include many recommendations (like joining cooperative purchasing programs or using purchasing cards rather than issuing individual purchase orders) that the district could adopt as part of its next budget (due before the board in August). Torres said trustees are eager to pluck “the low- hanging fruit,” where a change in process could save cash without impacting educational quality - such as cutting $250,000 budgeted for refreshments for committee meetings. The report also puts a spotlight on central administration. It proposes beefing up the internal audit department, making it report to the board as well as the superintendent, and moving it back to the district’s central offices as a gentle reminder that everyone, not just campuses, is subject to oversight. The study also suggests cutting out approximately $1 million in travel and cell-phone allowances for administrators, which it criticiz- es for being too generous and unrelated to miles traveled or calls made. But not every suggestion would be so easy to implement or so palatable to the education community - such as a wide array of potential staff cuts, both in central administration and on the campuses. At the upper end of the pay scale, that means restructuring human resources to get rid of three positions for a savings of more than $375,000 a year. At the bottom end, MGT suggests ending the habit of keeping full custodial staffing over the summer and using specialist “deep clean” teams instead, saving $2.3 million per year. Staff reduction proposals are not surprising, Torres argues, because staff expenditures make up 85% of the district bud- get. But he was quick to add that cutting positions is not the same as sacking staff and that if the district does go down that path, it would show “a sen- sitive approach to transitioning personnel.” The most radical option would be closing up to eight schools. MGT estimated there are up to 16,000 “excess seats” dis- trictwide and proposed closing seven ele- mentary schools and one middle school. Mary McKeown-Moak, a senior partner with MGT, explained: “There are schools that are at 40 percent of their capacity. ... That means that they’re not operating very efficiently.” MGT came up with the figure of eight schools by subtracting the total num- ber of current students from the total number of classroom seats (curiously, including seats in portable, or temporary, classrooms), thereby calculating the “excess,” and then halving the num- ber to allow for growth. But Torres says that calcula- tion doesn’t reflect real current or future needs and doesn’t take into account issues like dropout rates. He com- pared running a school district to running an electric utility: “We have to have the maximum capacity to educate the maxi- mum number of children we have to educate.” A school under capacity this year could be over capacity next year, especially if its attendance zone were realigned. Torres said he’s also worried that the report “didn’t seem to reflect the values of our community.” (That’s particularly disappointing, because part of why MGT got the $455,000 contract was that it has a local office.) For example, it sug- gests the district could save $50 million over five years by ending elementary art and music classes, another $1.8 mil- lion by halving the number of field trips, $18 million by cutting full-day pre-K to the state-mandated minimum half-day, and $31 million by slashing 248 special-education instructional assistant positions - based on special-ed staffing levels in other districts. Torres countered, “We value inclusion of our special education community,” and said that’s one cost AISD may be more willing than others to absorb. Education Austin President Louis Malfaro detected some self-justification by MGT in the study. He explained: “At the end of the day, they needed to come up with a big bottom line so they could say, ‘Look at all this money we saved.’ If they’d only come up with $20 million, people would have asked, ‘What did we spend all that money on?”’ McKeown-Moak defended all these figures as merely options and said that “the study lays out the pros and cons” City Council Looks like an all-nighter After a few weeks away, the City Council returns today, Thursday, June 11, to a torrential backlog of unfinished business. Here’s a tip-off to what the day’s looking like: A briefing on the city’s $45 million “menu” of potential budget cuts isn’t even the main attraction. Take a look: On the consent agenda, Item 12 marks the return of the infamous $1.5 million contract to develop an Integrated Solid Waste Management Master Plan for Solid Waste Services. Will the management shake-up there that scuttled former Director Willie Rhodes to Code Compliance mean the controversial contract will now pass? Local engineering firm HDR is still recommended by staff... Item 15, alluded to in “City Hall Hustle” (p.16), allows for a $250 hike in EMS transport fees... Item 16 is the re-emergence of the polarizing proposal to rework staffing in the upper ranks of the Austin Fire Department. As council post- poned Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr’s original proposal for five assistant chiefs, questioning the cost, it now looks like the number of assis- tant chiefs has been downgraded to four... Item 32 codifies new parking regulations created by the city’s upcoming switch from parking meters to an electronic pay-station model. It includes free meter parking for motor- cycles and mopeds and a minimum parking- time purchase of 15 minutes. Moving onto items from council, Item 38 requires any member of a board advising the city on development or contractual matters to file a public financial statement and spells out rules overseeing the Public Safety Commission as it transitions from a tempo- rary task force to a permanent commission... Item 39 oversees creation of an Austin Generation Resource Planning Task Force to examine the utility’s mix of energy sources; there were worries at the time the task force was proposed that it would be dominated by business interests, but the resolution says it “shall not be weighted in favor of any one interest group or customer class.”... And Item 40, from Council Members Randi Shade and Lee Leffingwell, names “transparency as a core value” in the redesign of the city web- site, ensuring it doesn’t get lost in all the newfound tech hoopla over its design. The aforementioned briefing on the budget development process is scheduled at 10:30am, while a briefing on new amend- ments to tree regulations comes before council at 2pm; 6pm public hearings include Item 71, an appeal of Planning Commission approval allowing adult-lounge-zoned male strip club LaBare to set up shop in Lincoln Village, across from Highland Mall. And lastly, Item 75 is the 2009 Bicycle Master Plan update, returning for certain council approval after a procedural error kept council from okaying it last month. This meeting’s certain- ly not stuck in first gear. - Wells Dunbar 18 the Austin chronicle JUNE] 12,2009 austinch ronicle.com Dallas Revisions Itself Across from City Hall in downtown Dallas, a sophisticated model for next-generation sus- tainable urban development is about to rise from a parking lot. The visionary project began with an international design competition, Re:Vision Dallas, organized by San Francisco-based Urban Revision. The 2.5- acre full-block project will supply all of its own renewable energy. It’s intended as a model for creating socially, economically, and environ- mentally healthy and self-sustaining places around the globe; project requirements includ- ed enough garden space to feed about 300 inhabitants, 40% affordable housing, and an educational facility. The winning submissions include features such as visible cutting-edge water and energy systems, vertical farming and slow-food restaurants; one has a “grain field providing seasonal vegetation for live- stock grazing in the sky pasture.” Three finalist teams - which all created futuristic architectural plans - now have been selected from hundreds of competing archi- tecture and planning firms in 26 countries. (View their designs at www.urbanrevision.com/ dallas.) The design jury included two Austin- ites: Pliny Fisk, director/co-founder of the Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems, and Sergio Palleroni, director/co- founder of the BaSiC Initiative at University of Texas, as well as Dallas community leaders and other internationally known architects and community planners. The three finalists awarded cash prizes: Forwarding Dallas (Portugal), chosen for European-style massing, vegetated screens, and innovation; Entangled Bank (North Carolina), selected for striking full-block massing and arrangement of sustainable systems; and Green ways Xero Energy (San Francisco), chosen for creating a sense of community with bold greenway plans. The Central Dallas Community Development Corporation, a “grassroots, faith-based” organization focused on affordable housing, is the project’s lead developer. It’s now deciding whether to select a single team or pursue a collaborative effort by the three finalists. It also has requested bids from a private developer partner; ground breaking is planned for late 2010. At the competition kickoff last December, Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert hosted leading urban planners and design professionals for an intensive design charrette organized by Urban Revision. He expressed a goal that “Dallas be at the forefront of design, sustain- ability, and vibrancy of cities.” Leaving Austin in its dust, we gather. Could our city do something equally cool and creative with Project Green, the redevelopment of the city-owned water-treatment plant site Downtown? We asked Perry Lorenz and Tim McCabe, the developers selected for that project, for a reaction to Revision Dallas. Lorenz promised to take a careful look. “It was a great process, and the result is stunning,” said McCabe, who was familiar with the design competition; he’s leading Project Green for Trammell Crow, which is now negotiating with the city of Austin to buy the land. - Katherine Gregor Emancipet: 10 Years, 10 Bucks, lO Friends Double high fives to Emancipet, which celebrated a 10-year anniversary on June 3 with its 100,000th sterilization - an important milestone for both the organization, which pro- vides free and low-cost spay/neuter and wellness services, and the Austin area. “The number of births of unwanted puppies and kittens prevented by these 100,000 surgeries is estimated to be in the millions” said Executive Director Amy Mills. “We believe these efforts are contributing to the recent decrease in intake and euthanasia at the city’s Town Lake Animal Center.” The lucky dog undergoing the com- memorative surgery was a lab mix named Kelli; her owner received a gift basket and a lifetime supply of flea-control products. In addition, on June 9, Emancipet kicked off its Power of Ten fundraising campaign, in which Emancipet will ask friends and supporters to donate $10 and each in turn ask 10 friends to do the same.

EMERALD POINT MARINA, LAKE TRAVIS austinchronicle.com JUNE 12,2009 the Austin chronicle 19 i.W.Y- DRUG RING COMES FULL CIRCLE Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a June 3 press confer- ence that a rise in vio- lent street crime and gang activity in neigh- borhoods across the city was the impetus for a joint local-state-feder- al task force investiga- tion that began more than two years ago and ended with 28 defen- dants sentenced to between three and 27 years in federal prison. “It is a good day for anyone who abhors vio- lence,” Acevedo said. Investigators with the Austin Police Depart- ment, FBI, Travis County Sheriff’s Office, Pflugerville Police Department, and several other Central Texas agencies joined with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice’s Office of the Inspector General to crack down on a cocaine traf- ficking organization run through the Cinco-Tres gang (or 5-3, which refers to the 512 area code), a subset of the Bloods gang, said Acevedo. At the helm was Duane Hosea, “the head of the snake, as far as I’m concerned,” Acevedo said. Hosea, now spending 27 years in federal prison for his trafficking activities, was directly connected to cartels south of the border in Mexico and Honduras, said FBI agent Steve Hause; the goal of the joint investigation was to break down the “entire conspiracy from the streets to Mexico.” In building the conspira- cy case, Hause said, police have seized a total of more than 450 kilos of cocaine since 2005. Acevedo also took a couple of glancing shots at the Travis County Courthouse - seemingly both at the bench and the District Attorney’s Office - saying that send- ing the cases through the federal system (where they would end up anyway in a joint operation) resulted in longer sentences and “no rocket docket here, no spank on the hands.” The attitude in Austin is sometimes “dismissive” when it comes to drugs, but as a “major corridor” from Mexico through the U.S. - a “trip wire,” if you will - Austin can’t afford to be so lax, Acevedo said. In the future, he added, police will look “for every opportunity we can” to send cases through the federal system - where, for example, a sentence means straight time with no parole. However, in the drug trade, it remains true that when a snake’s head gets chopped off, another is soon likely to grow. And so it begins again. -Jordan Smith AGLCC Ousts President in Pride’s Wake Basking in the warm rainbow glow of one of Austin’s most successful Pride weekends to date, what would any self-respecting group in charge of the festivities do? Why, lop off the top of its leadership, of course. Perplexing as that sounds, that’s just what the Austin Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has done. According to its Tuesday morning press release: “President Jimmy Flannigan has stepped down and for- mer executive vice-president Chad Peevy has taken on the role of president of the chamber. ... Flannigan resigned his position to pursue other interests and to focus on his own business, Site Street.” Flannigan’s purported resignation was a shock, since the consensus of the LGBT community and beyond seemed to be that this year’s Pride was not only a success but a great leap toward earning the public’s trust in the AGLCC, a group that has long strived to live down its reputation as a too conserva- tive - some say repressive - organization that was to be, for the first time, in charge of not only Austin’s Pride Parade but all of the city’s Pride festivals as well. As it turns out, the gingerly worded press release didn’t accurately represent what hap- pened. “I’m disappointed that the new cham- ber leadership decided to mischaracterize my exit,” said Flannigan on Tuesday. “My commit- ment to this community remains strong.” According to the newly seated AGLCC President Peevy, the board in fact had asked for Flannigan’s resignation. “That press release was issued to save face for Jimmy,” Peevy said. “There was very little organiza- tion that went into [this year’s] Pride, and what did happen happened very late in the game,” he continued. “And as we start think- ing about next year and the level we want to take Pride - with a national headliner and in doing things more on a national scope ... if we’re going to do that, then we’re going to need a full year to think about it. We had no time to waste.” SUICIDE BY COP GRAVES LOSES IN FEDERAL COURT A jury has found in favor of the defendants in Richard Graves v. Williamson County and Don Zachary, a lawsuit tried June 1-2 in U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks’ court. The jury rejected Richard Graves’ allegation that Williamson County Sheriff’s Deputy Don Zachary violated Graves’ constitutional rights when he shot him in the groin and heart on July 27, 2004, while Graves was holding a gun to his own head and sitting cross-legged on the balcony of an apartment belonging to his ex-wife, Tania Besek. According to court documents, Graves had brandished a gun at Besek, after which she’d called police and reported that Graves might kill himself. A “man-with-gun” family disturbance call went out, culminating in the near-fatal shooting. (See “WilCo Follies,” June 27, 2008.) When Graves initially filed the lawsuit, things seemed to be going his way. William- son Co. sought qualified immunity for Zachary but lost on appeal, and Sparks - along with a panel of justices for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans - agreed with Graves that he had posed no threat to police or bystanders. At trial, other officers who were on the scene testified that indeed Graves had not pointed the gun at them, that they would not have charged up the stairs without taking cover as Zachary had done, nor would they have shot Graves without first talking to him. Moreover, the plaintiff’s counsel, Jeff Edwards, argued that Graves had indeed complied with com- mands to show his hands - by lifting his left one, palm open, and keeping his right to his own head with the gun. The defense coun- tered that this did not constitute compliance. Zachary testified that Graves had “lured” him upstairs, faking surrender; if he’d seen the gun sooner, he’d have taken cover down- stairs, he said, but believed he had to charge up to save others. Moreover, he insisted that he ordered Graves to drop his weapon, though no one else could testify to having heard him say that. He said he shot haphaz- ardly out of stress and justified the second shot - two or three seconds later - by saying, “I thought I’d missed.” Although Zachary is a trained sniper, he represented himself on the stand as having felt fearful and helpless. According to ballis- tics evidence, Zachary was at point-blank range on the first shot; forensic analysis could not determine distance on the second shot, but on the 911 tape, that shot was muffled, and witnesses said that it was hard to hear. The shot entered Graves’ shoulder, traveling at a much steeper trajectory than the first shot, according to Edwards. Graves told the Chronicle he doesn’t remember see- ing either shot coming - his eyes were closed before the first, and he blacked out after the second. The defense cast Graves as a highly intoxi- cated and dangerous “active shooter,” pack- ing a weapon “like the one used at Colum- bine” and “no different than a gunman on the UT campus.” Graves was contemplating not just suicide but homicide, the defense abruptly argued during closing arguments - a claim to which Edwards objected, unsuccess- fully. The jury would sort out the facts, was Sparks’ response. According to Graves, these facts still remain: He wanted to kill himself that night and no one else. “I just wanted to die,” he remembers telling officers right before the first shot, a wish Zachary almost granted him. - Patricia J. Ruland Yet according to the very same press release, this year’s Pride was “one of the better organized and most enjoyable Pride celebrations in Austin to date.” “There is no question that what Jimmy did for this com- munity definitely launched the | chamber forward,” conceded | Peevy. “But keep in mind, this I is a board; all of us worked i to make this happen, not just > Jimmy Flannigan. Our growth g became stunted when rela- o X tionships were put in jeopar- dy. Right now we have ven- dors who are asking for refunds.” Peevy declined to reveal the number or identities of the vendors. “Right now,” said Peevy, the board has no plans to fire anyone else. At press time, the AGLCC released a revised statement acknowledging that Flannigan had not resigned but was instead voted out of office, an interesting first day’s task for Austin’s new AGLCC board.

At this writing, a trial may be the only way to settle the emotionally charged debate pitting historic preservation against property rights. Until then, the six-month cooling-off period provides a reprieve of sorts for the Hyde Park Neighborhood Association, which last month secured a temporary restraining order to block the demolition of a 100-year-old home at 4213 Avenue G. Property owner Helen Nohra and her now- grown children have owned the Bradford- Nohra property for more than 60 years. They want to bulldoze the time-worn neoclas- sical home and build townhomes on the spacious corner lot at 43rd and Avenue G. The family is pursuing the case on consti- tutional grounds, arguing it is with- in its rights to control its own property. The HPNA, on the other hand, advocates pre- serving and restoring the aging structure, in spite of the rambling, gener- ic-looking altera- tions that have been made to it over the years. At the very least, they argue, the historic front portion of the house - replete with grand, full-length columns - should remain intact because of its contribution to the char- acter of the leafy neighborhood. The house is listed as “potentially contributing” to the Hyde Park National Register Historic District. At a hearing June 4 - the day the tempo- rary restraining order was set to expire - attorneys for HPNA, the Nohra family, and the city recounted a curious set of circum- stances surrounding the case, which first rumbled to life in early 2008 when the prop- erty owners requested a demolition permit; neighbors opposed the permit and instead sought a historical designation. Both the Historic Landmark Commission and the Planning Commission ruled in favor of the neighborhood association (and against the recommendation of city staff), and in March of this year, the City Council came close to sealing the deal with a preliminary vote in favor of historical zoning. “After that,” said HPNA attorney Philip Durst, “everything stopped.” As Durst explained to the court, the house was “90 percent of the way” to securing historical designation when city staff reversed course in mid-May and issued the demolition per- mit. Neighborhood leaders rushed to the courthouse and obtained the temporary order to keep the bulldozer at bay. City staffers had decided to issue the demolition permit after researching a boards and commissions ordinance, amended in 2007 in an attempt to bring uniformity to the vast number of citizen panels making recom- mendations to the City Council. The various boards were to have adopted new bylaws by January 2008, changing, among other things, their quorum and voting procedures. But the Historic Landmark Commission (and apparently other boards as well) was still operating under old bylaws when it voted on the Bradford-Nohra case. Under the amend- ed ordinance, the commission would have needed a greater voting majority to render a decision in the case than the 3-2 simple majority vote that moved the issue forward. Meanwhile, people on both sides of the zoning case have privately expressed con- cern that the city could be opening the door to a number of legal challenges, considering the Bradford-Nohra case is just one of count- less matters that the com- mission voted on while operat- ing under its “simple majori- ty” bylaws. The amended ordi- nance issue could also impact other boards and commissions, although how much legal weight they carry is unclear, since most serve in advisory capacities. On May 19, the city auditor’s office issued a “risk assessment” of 20 boards and com- missions to determine which panels were in compliance with city policy and which ones, as the report put it, could “benefit from a performance audit.” As it happens, the Historic Landmark Commission topped the risk list with 21 points. It’s uncertain whether the risk report will come into play as the Bradford-Nohra case moves forward. “My gut feeling is that this is going to go to trial,” said attorney James McManus, representing the Nohra family, after the hearing. He added that the family had offered to give the house to the neigh- borhood association at no charge, on the condition the HPNA move the structure to another site. “But they want to control what goes on that property,” McManus said of the association. HPNA member Amon Burton, who participated in mediations between the neighborhood and the family, doesn’t deny McManus’ assumption. “This is one of the most prominent corners of Hyde Park,” he said, noting the corner’s transit link to the bygone days of the trolley car. Additionally, the Elisabet Ney Museum sits a block away from the property in one direction, and Shipe Pool is a block away in another direc- tion. “We want to protect the historic quality of that corner,” Burton said. - Amy Smith The Bradford-Nohra house at 4213 Avenue G HOME 3-$)ay Summer Sale BUY ONE, GET ONE OFF (Second item equal ex teoaex value ) J$uy Clny One Jtem dt Jteyutwc Jletait Jrice and J$uy a Second Jtem at 1/2 price.
