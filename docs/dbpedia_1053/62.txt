This is old track (1982) made by Yugoslavian musician Laza Ristovski .It's called "Beyond the Horizon" and it's made with two synthesizers-Minimoog and Oberheim OBX-a.Somebody recorded it from vinyl-that explains pops and clicks:(

So,for those who like good old analog sounds and Jarre-like music ,they should have it :

beautiful, I remember this song from way back when i was a kid. this is a track from his second solo album.

even tho hidden behind the iron curtain (at the time) Ristovski was as good of a player/synthesist as his more internationaly known peers like jarre, saga, tony banks etc.. besides solo work, he was best known as a guest synthesist/kbd player on tons of albums by famous Yugoslavian rock artists during 70s and 80s. i remember he had one of the first commercially available full PPG systems, including PRK and Waveterm.

btw, my friend visited him recently, in Belgrade. and Laza still owns his R.A.Moog Minimoog, OB Four Voice and Mellotron M400 from the 70s. unfortunately, he is seriously ill with MS.
