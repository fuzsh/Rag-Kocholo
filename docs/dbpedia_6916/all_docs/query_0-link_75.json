        "text": "In this intense episode of \"Crime Junkie,\" hosts Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat delve into the chilling particulars of The Alphabet Murders that have haunted Rochester, New York. The episode details the tragic and mysterious circumstances surrounding the deaths of three girls in the 1970s, all sharing the eerie connection of double initials and the locations of their body discoveries. With a series of suspects paraded throughout the years and the uncanny statistical implication of a serial killer's involvement, the hosts explore the complexities of these interconnected crimes and the debate over the possibility of multiple culprits.\n\nDespite multiple leads and suspects from troubled firefighter Dennis Termini to the infamous Kenneth Bianchi, the truth behind \"The Alphabet Murders\" has evaded resolution for decades. Flowers and Prawat also address the pivotal role of DNA evidence, which has proved indispensable in excluding certain suspects without bringing the case to a close. With renewed interest and advancements such as Investigative Genetic Genealogy, the episode ends on a note of tentative hope, as modern technology could finally unravel one of the most labyrinthine and notorious cases in criminal history. Join the investigation with \"Crime Junkie\" as the hosts unravel the threads of a puzzle that remain unresolved to this day.\n\nThe murders of the three girls\n\nCarmen Colon, Wanda Walkowicz, and Michelle Maenza, the victims from Rochester, New York, share disturbing similarities across their murders. Each girl had double initials, and their bodies were found in locations matching the initials of their names. A witness reported seeing a confrontational man who attempted to hide a girl resembling Michelle near the location of her body discovery, also noting he had long fingernails, aligning with evidence of scratches on Carmen's body. A statistical analysis implies it's highly unlikely (0.03% chance) for three separate random victims to have double initials, suggesting a potential serial killer. The pattern of abductions and murders in Connecticut stopped when the Rochester murders began and resumed when they ended.\n\nThe debate over a single killer versus multiple killers is ongoing due to variations in the brutality and methods of the murders. Differences in how the girls were lured and killed lead some to speculate about multiple assailants. However, officials view the initial coincidence as just thatâa bizarre coincidence. There is an open question around whether Carmen Colon's killer was the same as the one responsible for Wanda and Michelle's deaths, given the disparities in evidence.\n\nSuspects\n\nMultiple suspects have come to light in the Rochester murder investigations due to connections or evidence, despite no definitive conclusions.\n\nMiguel Colon, a relative of two victims, caught investigators' attention after a violent domestic incident, but his family attested to his innocence. Dennis Termini, a firefighter with a suspect history, became a prime suspect due to matching eyewitness descriptions and evidence found in his vehicle that suggested a connection to the crimes. Although Termini's criminal activities ended in suicide, suspicion remained strong. Kenneth Bianchi, known as the Hillside Strangler, was re-considered due to his presence in Rochester during the murders and an employment background that warranted scrutiny, but the investigation moved away from him when wrist prints and further evidence did not align. Joseph Naso became a suspect in 2011 when evidence linked him to murders in California and his Rochester residency during the abductions emerged.\n\nWitness descriptions contributed to developing a suspect profile, and a security guard named Gilbert encountered a man who matched the description and behaved suspiciously. Despite this, the cases remain unsolved with each lead often diverging and not definitively incriminating any one suspect.\n\nThe DNA evidence\n\nIn the investigation, DNA evidence has been crucial in excluding suspects but has not yet resulted in an arrest.\n\nMultiple suspects, including Kenneth Bianchi and Dennis Termini, were ruled out with DNA evidence from Wanda Walkowicz's case. Although her profile has been tested against many individuals, no matches have been found, and it remains unclear if the DNA profile is entered into CODIS. The DNA in the cases of the other two girls was destroyed, posing a challenge for investigators.\n\nThere is a push for using Investigative Genetic Genealogy (IGG) to generate new leads after the resumption of familial DNA testing in New York in 2023. Despite the state of New York not funding IGG, grants from Season of Justice could help facilitate the use of genetic genealogy to potentially solve Wanda's case and related investigations.\n\nThe case of Carmen Colon, Wanda Walkowicz, and Michelle Maenza from Rochester, New York, known as the double initial or alphabet murders, reveals chilling similarities amid an ongoing debate about the number of assailants involved.\n\nThe similarities in the cases linking them as possible serial killings\n\nThe three young girls, Carmen Colon, Wanda Walkowicz, and Michelle Maenza, are forever connected by the disturbing similarities between their cases. All three girls had double initials in their names and their bodies were found in areas matching the initials of their first and last namesâWebster and Macedon. A witness came forward to report seeing a man, who was confrontational and attempted to hide a girl resembling Michelle, near where her body was discovered. Furthermore, the same witness described the suspect as having long fingernailsâa detail eerily reminiscent of scratches found on Carmen's body.\n\nA statistical analysis cited suggests that the occurrence of three separate random victims all with double initials is markedly low (0.03%). Moreover, the timing of linked series of similar murders in Connecticut further fuels theories of a potential serial killer. The episodes of abduction and murder in Connecticut ceased as the Rochester murders began, only to resume when they stopped.\n\nThe debate about whether there was one killer or multiple\n\nHowever, there remains a lack of consensus on whether the murders were the work of a single perpetrator or multiple killers. Some argue that the brutality and methods varied to a degree that could suggest different assailants. For instance, one girl's killing was notably more violent, while the others appeared to have been coaxed by feeding, indicating possibly different approaches.\n\nAshley Flowers and other investigators have deliberated the significance of the ...\n\nIn the chilling cases of the Rochester abductions, various suspects have surfaced over the years. These individuals have drawn the attention of law enforcement due to their backgrounds, behaviors, or direct links to evidence.\n\nMiguel Colon\n\nMiguel Colon, an uncle of one of the victims and the brother-in-law to another, drew the attention of investigators following a violent domestic dispute that resulted in him shooting two relatives before taking his own life. Even though his family firmly believed in his innocence, the nature of the incident kept him on the investigators' radar until his death.\n\nDennis Termini\n\nDetails emerge around Dennis Termini, a firefighter with an alleged history of targeting teen girls and women, his criminal activities ending in suicide as the police were closing in on him. Termini's vehicle, known for its unique dent, matched the description provided by a witness, and investigators found evidence such as cat hairs and human hair, consistent with one of the victims, that implicated Termini. The discovery of his yearbook photo and the confirmation that he was approximately 25 years old at the times of the crimes further supported the suspicion that Termini may have been involved. He maintained a strong standing as a primary suspect for the cases of Wanda and Michelle for several years.\n\nKenneth Bianchi\n\nKenneth Bianchi, notorious as the Hillside Strangler, initially didn't seem connected to the Rochester crimes due to his geography and the nature of his known crimes. However, details about his presence in Rochester during the corresponding time frame, his employment background, and subsequent re-evaluations of evidence, such as wrist prints, prompted a renewed scrutiny by investigators. Despite the initial mismatch of the wrist prints and a lack of further incriminating evidence, Bianchi's candidacy as a suspect saw multiple reassessments before he was nearly ruled out.\n\nJoseph Nazo\n\nThe arrest of Joseph Nazo in 2011 uncovered disturbing evidence that extended beyond the four murders attributed to him in Northern California between 1977 and 1994. Photographs of women and a handwritten list with ominous associations, coupled with h ..."
