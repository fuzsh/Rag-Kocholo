        "text": "Hi friends! I’m back with yet another book review, so let us commence the spilling of the tea!\n\nThere’s a serial killer on the loose, working his way through the alphabet and the whole country is in a state of panic.\n\nAgatha Christie is often hailed as the “queen of mystery”. This is my fourth book by her, and I think my second favorite for quite a few reasons. I need to watch TV show to compare it*! Also, a quick note: the audiobook narrator, Hugh Fraser, did an AMAZING job. All the voices are perfectly done, and easily discernible. I loved the French accent for Hercule.\n\n*also to see how ron weasley handles muggle murder. something tells me he might not do so well.\n\nThis is much more psychological than I was expecting? It was less whodunit and more whydidit. Hercule Poiroit (our beloved detective) was actually rather serious, and it was interesting seeing how he handled having so many loose ends. What really fascinated me was how the police was focused on catching the killer by classic means, while Poirot was preoccupied with studying the mind and motive. The climax and resolution only hammered in how Christie can truly thrive writing any kind of mystery! To be honest, they have a really modern feel in how brilliantly she plots her stories.\n\nnow let’s one-line some characters!\n\nHercule Poirot: Basically, his banter with Hastings is hilariously chill, yet his mind?\n\nCaptain Hastings: His name should be Captain Obvious, because he states the obvious*.\n\n*dang maybe MY name should be captain obvious\n\nSir Franklin Clark: His name starts with Sir, so of course he embodies chivalrous gentleman.\n\nMary Dower: Forgettable.\n\nMegan B: I can’t remember her last name but Megan was an absolute queen.\n\nDonald Fraiser: Literally Ron Weasley, red hair and all.\n\nThora Gray: Tell me why the Dora theme song plays in my head whenever her name is mentioned.\n\nAlexander Cust: Cinnamon roll…?\n\nSO yeah. The plot was not very twisty, but it in that way it drew upon some “thriller” elements. I mean, technically everyone was pretty chill about the murders so it wasn’t really a thriller, but it felt totally different from Christie’s previous mysteries.\n\nSo yeah, I think that’s it! Agatha Christie always has good mysteries that I can never totally predict, even if I don’t fall in love with them. Have you read this? Seen the TV show?"
