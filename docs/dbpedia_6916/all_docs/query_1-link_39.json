        "text": "Dozens of commuters see a young girl fleeing a car on the side of the expressway in Rochester, NY, but no one pulls over to help. The community is devastated when her body is discovered just days later, but it’s assumed to be a tragic but isolated incident. But when more young girls go missing…only to have their bodies discovered within days in a similar manner…the community must ask: is a serial killer stalking the streets of Rochester? And is he choosing his victims based on a seemingly random characteristic? This is Part 2 of 2.\n\nIf you have any information relating to any of these cases, please contact the New York State Police Department at (585) 398-4100, or email them at [email protected].\n\nCheck out Alphabet Killer: The True Story of the Double Initial Murders by Cheri Farnsworth.\n\nCheck out Nightmare in Rochester: The Double Initial Murders by Michael Benson.\n\nTo listen to CONSPIRACY: North Fox Island & The Oakland County Child Killer Part 1 and Part 2, please visit our website.\n\nFor more information about or to donate to Season of Justice, please visit www.seasonofjustice.org."
