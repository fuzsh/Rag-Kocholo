        "text": "Tony Randall stars as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in the director Frank Tashlin’s extravagant 1965 adaptation of Agatha Christie’s “The ABC Murders,” infusing the sleuth’s punctilious style with analytical nerdiness. When Poirot turns up in London to see his tailor, he learns that a circus clown named Albert Aachen has been killed, and he decides to solve the case. Then a bowling instructor named Betty Barnard is murdered, and Poirot suspects the killer of working his or her way through the alphabet. Tashlin transforms the mystery into a giddy parody of Alfred Hitchcock’s films: borrowing his highly inflected, riotously inventive visual styles, Tashlin creates a sort of live-action cartoon, with distorting angles yielding disorienting juxtapositions, whether from the explosive results of a dish of kidneys flambé or during balletic capers at a bowling alley. In an intricate set piece, Tashlin transforms a casino’s glossy formalities into a theatre of horror, though his subject isn’t bloody murder but its irresistibly macabre, media-friendly allure—the power of such tales to liberate creative energy and lend the oppressive dullness of daily life an invigorating jolt. (Streaming on Amazon and playing Sept. 3 on TCM.)"
