        "text": "In the early 1960s, MGM made a series of Miss Marple comedies starring Margaret Rutherford as the indomitable sleuth. The films were loosely based on Agatha Christie‚Äôs works, and the author herself was decidedly NOT a fan of these comedies. Love it or hate it, Rutherford does make the role of Miss Marple her own! The films also feature Rutherford‚Äôs real-life husband and actor, Stringer Davis, in the role of village librarian Mr. Stringer, a role created just for the films.\n\nQuite a few years ago, I purchased a box set of all 4 films in the series: Murder, She Said (1961), Murder at the Gallop (1963), Murder Most Foul (1964), and Murder Ahoy! (1964). I had never gotten around to watching them all ‚Äî until now. Oversight corrected!\n\nBecause all the films follow a basic formula, I thought it made sense to do one big post comparing-and-contrasting aspects and themes from the entire series. (It has taken me WEEKS, y‚Äôall, to watch all the films, rewatch them for note-taking and analysis purposes, create photo collages, and finally put together this post. All for the love of reel librarians. ‚ù§ )\n\nTherefore, heads up:\n\nThis is a MARATHON post, so buckle up for the reel librarian (bicycle) ride\n\nPotential spoilers ahead\n\nBelow is the trailer for the first (and best) in the series, Murder, She Said, so you can get a sense of the jaunty and lighthearted feel of the movies. You can first see Mr. Stringer 49 seconds into the trailer below. The main musical theme is also so catchy, you‚Äôll find yourself humming it for days. No, it‚Äôs just me, then? üòâ\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the basics\n\nFirst things first, let‚Äôs provide some context with the basics of each film. All the films were directed by George Pollock and starred Margaret Rutherford played the role of Miss Marple. All the films also featured Stringer Davis as village librarian Mr. Stringer and Charles Tingwell as Inspector Craddock.\n\nMurder, She Said (1961):\n\nSource:\n\nBased on Agatha Christie‚Äôs 1957 novel, 4.50 from Paddington, aka What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!, featuring Miss Marple\n\nMovie plot:\n\nWhile traveling by train, Miss Marple witnesses the strangling of a woman in the carriage of a passing train. With the aid of her friend, Mr. Stringer, she figures out the body must have been thrown off the train near Ackenthorpe Hall. When the police don‚Äôt take her seriously, she takes a job as a housemaid at Ackenthorpe Hall in order to conduct her own investigation.\n\nMurder at the Gallop (1963):\n\nSource:\n\nBased on Agatha Christie‚Äôs 1953 novel, After the Funeral, aka Funerals are Fatal ‚Äî which features Hercule Poirot as the sleuth, NOT Miss Marple!\n\nMovie plot:\n\nWhen Miss Marple and Mr. Stringer are out soliciting donations for a charity, they visit the reclusive Mr. Enderby, arriving at his estate just in time to witness his death. Miss Marple, suspicious that Mr. Enderby‚Äôs death is not accidental, becomes even more suspicious when his sister, Cora, is murdered. When the police don‚Äôt take her seriously, Miss Marple books a stay at a riding school/hotel run by one of Mr. Enderby‚Äôs heirs in order to conduct her own investigation.\n\nMurder Most Foul (1964):\n\nSource:\n\nBased (very, very loosely) on Agatha Christie‚Äôs 1953 novel, Mrs. McGinty‚Äôs Dead, aka Blood Will Tell ‚Äî which, again, features Hercule Poirot as the sleuth, NOT Miss Marple!\n\nPlot:\n\nMrs. McGinty, a former actress, is found murdered, and her lodger is suspected of the crime. During the trial, Miss Marple is the lone holdout on the jury, believing the lodger innocent. When the police don‚Äôt take her seriously ‚Äî are we sensing a pattern here?! ‚Äî Miss Marple joins a regional theatre company in order to conduct her own investigation.\n\nMurder Ahoy! (1964):\n\nSource:\n\nBased on Agatha Christie‚Äôs characters and not on any particular source novel. However, there are plot similarities to Agatha Christie‚Äôs 1952 novel, They Do It with Mirrors, aka Murder with Mirrors, which features Miss Marple as the central sleuth.\n\nPlot:\n\nShortly after joining a local trust‚Äôs board of directors, Miss Marple witnesses the death of a fellow trustee. She doesn‚Äôt believe his death is an accident, and she thinks there‚Äôs something fishy about HMS Battledore, a ship the Trust purchased for the rehabilitation of young criminals. When the police don‚Äôt take her seriously ‚Äî what else is new?! ‚Äî she boards the ship in order to conduct her own investigation.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs screen time\n\nAs I watched each movie in the series, I kept track of how much screen time Mr. Stringer had in each movie, to see if his role ever increased with subsequent films.\n\nAs you can see from the table above, Mr. Stringer‚Äôs role definitely increased after the first film, in which he was only onscreen for a total of 15 minutes, or 17% of the film‚Äôs total runtime. In subsequent films, Mr. Stringer‚Äôs screen time remained pretty consistent, between 18-19 minutes, or 21-22% of each film‚Äôs total runtime.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs role\n\nMr. Stringer, the village librarian, is not a character borne of Agatha Christie‚Äôs imagination, yet he is a recurring character in each film of the series. Why, then, was this character created for the series?\n\nIn a biography of Margaret Rutherford, Andy Merriman also wrote that Rutherford, in her 70s during the filming of the series, insisted on having her husband appear alongside her.\n\nBy all accounts, Stringer Davis and Margaret Rutherford were devoted to each other, with Davis accompanying his wife wherever and whenever she was filming. Their relationship was a lifelong love story. They married in 1945 after a 15-year courtship, and they were together until Rutherford‚Äôs death in 1972. Davis took care of Rutherford in her last years, after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. He died in 1973, only a year after the love of his life passed away.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs role stays consistent throughout the series, and his character and personality never change. Although a supporting character, his role is vital in moving the plot forward. He is there as a companion to Miss Marple, a steady, adoring, supportive sidekick. He is a supporting character who fulfills two major character types in each film:\n\nInformation Provider ‚Äî Miss Marple sends Mr. Stringer on various research quests in each film, so he literally provides information to her (and the audience).\n\nComic Relief ‚Äî He plays the ‚Äústraight man‚Äù in their comic relationship. Miss Marple makes jokes or says something outrageous, Mr. Stringer reacts, the audience laughs. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nFilm critic David Cornelius also highlights Mr. Stringer‚Äôs comic role:\n\nTherefore, each film in the series ends up in the Class III category, films in which the librarian(s) plays a secondary role.\n\nA librarian by any other name‚Ä¶\n\nAlthough Mr. Stringer plays the village librarian, does the word ‚Äúlibrarian‚Äù ever actually get said out loud in the series? In a word‚Ä¶ NO. The closest we get is in the second film, Murder at the Gallop (1963), when Miss Marple describes Mr. Stringer as ‚Äúcustodian of the local library.‚Äù\n\nMr. Stringer as Information Provider and the importance of research\n\nAs I mentioned above, Mr. Stringer‚Äôs successful research quests always save the day. It is clear that Miss Marple trusts Mr. Stringer. Because Miss Marple trusts him ‚Äî and I would argue also because he‚Äôs a librarian ‚Äî the audience trusts him. Mr. Stringer makes it possible for Miss Marple to have her ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment at the end of each movie. I will now highlight Mr. Stringer‚Äôs major research quests in each film.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs research quest in Murder, She Said (1961):\n\nAt 53 minutes into the first film, Mr. Stringer bicycles to Miss Marple‚Äôs house for a nightcap (a ‚Äúsmall beer‚Äù) and plotting. They‚Äôre interrupted by Inspector Craddock, who tries to warn them off the case. (It doesn‚Äôt work.)\n\nMiss Marple: Well now, how did you get on at the probate registry?\n\nMr. Stringer: Really Miss Marple, I think in view of what the inspector said ‚Äî\n\nMiss Marple [interrupting]: Did you see the will?\n\nMr. Stringer: Yes.\n\nMiss Marple [while uncorking the beer]: What did it say?\n\nMr. Stringer: Well, old Mr. Ackenthorpe‚Äôs father obviously didn‚Äôt get on very well with him.\n\nMiss Marple: I‚Äôm not surprised at that. Go on.\n\nMr. Stringer: You see, the house and the income from the family fortune are his, but he can‚Äôt touch the fortune itself. That‚Äôs the first point.\n\nMiss Marple: Yes? [hands Mr. Stringer a beer.]\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs research quest in Murder at the Gallop (1963):\n\nAt 1 hour and 5 minutes into this film, Mr. Stringer is in Miss Marple‚Äôs hotel room. From underneath her bureau, Miss Marple takes out a painting that‚Äôs all wrapped up in paper and string and hands the parcel to Mr. Stringer.\n\nMiss Marple: Now you are, please, to take this to London to the art dealers. They will appraise it. And get it back here as quickly as you can.\n\nMr. Stringer: All right, if it will help.\n\nMiss Marple: Well, I‚Äôm hopeful it will not only help but clinch the whole matter, so to speak.\n\nWhen Mr. Stringer comes back from London, they continue their conversation.\n\nMiss Marple: What did you find out?\n\nMr. Stringer: You were quite right, Miss Marple. It‚Äôs worth at least 50,000 pounds.\n\nMiss Marple: I knew it. Then it was that picture after all.\n\nMr. Stringer: It certainly was.\n\nMiss Marple: Excellent. We can now proceed with certainty.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs research quest in Murder Most Foul (1964):\n\nAt 45 minutes into the third film, Miss Marple and Mr. Stringer meet in a public garden and sit on a bench.\n\nMiss Marple: It seems to me what whomever Mrs. McGinty was blackmailing must have had some connection with the production of this play in 1951, and is with the Cosgood Company.[‚Ä¶] Now, what organization would be likely to keep a record of all professional theatrical productions?\n\nMr. Stringer: The censorship people, I suppose.\n\nMiss Marple: To be sure. The Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs office in London. I should be obliged if you would go there posthaste and inquire into the history of this play. Where it was produced in 1951, who was in it, and so on.\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nMr. Stringer: Very well, Miss Marple. I‚Äôll take the next train up.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, Mr. Stringer then calls Miss Marple up from a public phone booth in order to relay the results of his research. He looks extremely pleased with himself!\n\nMr. Stringer: You were right, Miss Marple. Remember September was put on in 1951, a tryout performance at Pebblestone-on-Sea.\n\nMiss Marple: Very interesting. Particularly as the author claims that he‚Äôs only recently completed the work.\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh, well, that may have been embarrassment. You see, the Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs office particularly remembers it because it was booed off the stage halfway through the second act.\n\nMiss Marple: That doesn‚Äôt surprise me in the least. The point is, was there anyone we know in it?\n\nMr. Stringer: I have obtained a full cast list, and in it occurs the name of Margaret McGinty.\n\nMiss Marple: What? Really? Excellent. Now, tell me, apart from Mr. Cosgood, who else in this company was connected with this production? No one? You sure? Yes. All right, Jim. I was just thinking. Of course, it‚Äôs possible that someone has since changed his or her name. Look, Jim. Drop the cast list in to me at Westward Ho!, will you? Thank you. Goodbye.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs research quest in Murder Ahoy! (1964):\n\nA little over 52 minutes into the fourth and final film, Miss Marple breaks some bad news to Mr. Stringer, that he‚Äôs a suspect in a murder! But after she gives him some brandy to help with get over the shock (‚ÄúMe? A murderer?‚Äù), she has a research-related task for him to do.\n\nMiss Marple: I found this envelope in Compton‚Äôs sea chest, and it had been steamed open. [‚Ä¶] Mr. Stringer, you must return to Milchester at once. Go and see the secretary of the trust, Miss Pringle, and ask her what kind of communication from the ship would likely to be contained in an unusual envelope of this sort.\n\nMr. Stringer: But, Miss Marple, the police. I thought you said I was to lie low.\n\nMiss Marple: Well, use the back stairs, turn up your collar, and pull down your cap. Goodbye. Good luck.\n\nMr. Stringer gets the requested information back to Miss Marple in an unexpected way. He ties the evidence around a rock, rows out to the boat Miss Marple‚Äôs staying in, and then throws the rock through her window. Only problem is, his aim is too good; the rock hits Inspector Craddock in the head, and Craddock passes out. AWKWARD.\n\nMiss Marple: Do you know who threw that rock? My friend Mr. Stringer.\n\nInspector Craddock: Mr. Stringer?!\n\nMiss Marple: Yes, and you‚Äôll thank him for it. I found this envelope in Compton‚Äôs cabin after his death.\n\nInspector Craddock: Assaulting a police officer, withholding information‚Ä¶ again.\n\nMiss Marple: Now, don‚Äôt be petty, Chief Inspector. This type of envelope is used for the ship‚Äôs quarterly report to the trustees, and Mr. Stringer has enclosed the latest example for our perusal.\n\nMr. Stringer as Comic Relief\n\nWhile Mr. Stringer rarely makes a joke himself ‚Äî at least, not intentionally ‚Äî he does regularly find himself in the most ridiculously awkward situations. Behold:\n\nComic relief in Murder, She Said (1961):\n\nIn Murder, She Said (1961), he dresses up as a train worker, and for his efforts, he nearly gets run over by a train. Poor Mr. Stringer.\n\nHe then (awkwardly) assists Miss Marple ‚Äî ‚ÄúMr. Stringer, will you kindly give me a leg up?‚Äù ‚Äî so she can take a peek over a wall.\n\nComic relief in Murder at the Gallop (1963):\n\nEarly in Murder at the Gallop (1963), Mr. Stringer once again gets roped into physically assisting Miss Marple so she can have another peek into somewhere off limits, this time the room in which the heirs of the murdered man react to the contents of his last will and testament.\n\nAnd now for the comic moment that even made this film‚Äôs trailer ‚Äî Miss Marple and Mr. Stringer DO THE TWIST. As you can see below, Mr. Stringer realllly gets into it!\n\nComic relief in Murder Most Foul (1964):\n\nEarly in Murder Most Foul (1964), Miss Marple calls on the sister of the deceased woman, using an excuse of collecting things for the church jumble sale. Hidden in the jumble? Mr. Stringer! He‚Äôs hiding until called upon to pop out and pretend to be a bookseller, so that Miss Marple can snoop while the sister is distracted. As you do.\n\nComic relief in Murder Ahoy! (1964):\n\nIn the final film, Murder Ahoy! (1964), Mr. Stringer is tasked with following a group of delinquent boys who come ashore. His ingenious hiding place? A tramp‚Äôs boat! He gets discovered almost immediately by the tramp, who demands to know ‚Äúwhy a grand gentleman like yourself who‚Äôs able to live in a lovely hotel like that is wanting to sleep in my bed.‚Äù\n\nLibrary scenes\n\nThere are a few library scenes in the series, but Mr. Stringer, the village librarian, is only seen in an actual library in the first film. Fittingly, this scene serves as our introduction to this reel librarian.\n\nPublic library scene in Murder, She Said (1961)\n\nThis scene occurs at 7 1/2 minutes into the film, after Miss Marple gets upset at Inspector Craddock‚Äôs insinuation that she‚Äôs been hallucinating a murder. She grabs three books stacked up on a bench in her hall and walks to the library.\n\nWe then see Mr. Stringer talking with another patron, a hard-faced and no-nonsense woman, who is inquiring about a newly published mystery novel.\n\nMr. Stringer: I‚Äôm sorry, Mrs. Stainton, The Hatrack Hanging, Falcon-Smith‚Äôs latest, I‚Äôm afraid we haven‚Äôt received our copy yet.\n\nMrs. Stainton: Plain inefficiency. Anyway, I want to know the moment it comes in.\n\nMr. Stringer: Of course, of course, Mrs. Stainton.\n\nWhen Miss Marple comes into the library, his face lights up. We see more of the library as she walks by rows of bookcases and past a young man in the background flipping through a book. Mrs. Stainton stalks off upon Miss Marple‚Äôs arrival, and Mr. Stringer reveals his favoritism ‚Äî and his ability to lie!\n\nMr. Stringer puts up a finger ‚Äî in effect, shushing Miss Marple. He then pulls out a book from under the desk, The Hatrack Hanging.\n\nMr. Stringer: I‚Äôve been keeping it for you.\n\nMiss Marple pulls him into the stacks and asks if he thinks she‚Äôs unstable or given to hallucinations. Mr. Stringer seems properly horrified at the suggestion. (His job, first and always, is to reassure and support Miss Marple, and he does an excellent job of it.) Miss Marple then reveals to the audience why she and Mr. Stringer are qualified to investigate the murder on their own.\n\nMiss Marple: Mr. Stringer, how many detective novels would you say we have read over the years?\n\nMr. Stringer: Impossible to say. Certainly many hundred.\n\nMiss Marple: Yes. Which gives us, wouldn‚Äôt you agree, a certain knowledge of the criminal mind?\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh, most assuredly.\n\nMiss Marple: Well, this is where we put that knowledge to the test.\n\nMr. Stringer: We?\n\nMiss Marple: Yes. We.\n\n(I would also argue that this short exchange also explains why Mr. Stringer‚Äôs character was made a librarian, because OF COURSE a librarian would have ready and steady access to detective novels.)\n\nMrs. Stainton interrupts this bit of camaraderie when she walks back to the front desk and discovers The Hatrack Hanging book! Uh-oh‚Ä¶\n\nMrs. Stainton: So it has come in!\n\nMr. Stringer [oh-so-innocently]: Oh, has it?\n\nMrs. Stainton [to Miss Marple]: Well? I think I have first call.\n\nMiss Marple: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll like it, Hilda. Too obvious. The mother did it, of course.\n\nMrs. Stainton: How could you possibly know that? The book has only just come in.\n\nMiss Marple: It always is with Falcon-Smith ‚Äî a deprived child, you know.\n\nMiss Marple then sails away, clearly the winner of this verbal cat fight. She calls back to invite Mr. Stringer for tea, which he eagerly accepts.\n\nStill smiling, Mr. Stringer picks up a stamp, as Mrs. Stainton looks sourly back at Miss Marple.\n\nThe entire library scene lasts only a couple of minutes, but we learn several things, including:\n\nThe library is used by a variety of patrons of different ages.\n\nThe library must have a well-stocked collection of detective and mystery novels.\n\nThe library set is filled with books without call numbers. (Sigh.)\n\nMr. Stringer engages in occupational tasks, such as stamping.\n\nMr. Stringer is a very capable liar.\n\nPrivate library scene in Murder Ahoy! (1964)\n\nAround 15 minutes into the final film, Miss Marple connects the first murder to the plot in a book entitled The Doom Box. But this time, the book doesn‚Äôt live in the village library, but rather Miss Marple‚Äôs private library.\n\nMiss Marple: Propel me please, Jim.\n\nMr. Stringer pushes the stepladder forward, as Miss Marple scans titles. (Her private library is beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?!) Also, library ladder alert!\n\nMiss Marple: Oh, here we are. The Doom Box by J. Plantaganet Corby. Here it is. Now listen. ‚ÄúAnd so, me lad, declared Sefton Harricott: Jacob Rushton did indeed suffer a heart attack, but it was induced by a noxious substance in his snuff.‚Äù\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh, Miss Marple, I‚Äôm beginning to ‚Äî\n\nMiss Marple: Wait. ‚ÄúThe murderer, continued Harricott, made one error. He failed to remove the incriminating residue from the snuff box.‚Äù A mistake our murderer no doubt imagines he has not made.\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh. But why should anyone want to do such a thing?\n\nMiss Marple: That, Mr. Stringer, is the question. Poor Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke had just returned from our ship. He had something important to say. He never said it. I wonder. Yes, that‚Äôs where the motive must lie. Mr. Stringer, there is something going on aboard the Battledore.\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh, goodness.\n\nThis scene is vital for propelling the plot forward (just as Mr. Stringer propels Miss Marple forward, hah! üòâ ). It leads Miss Marple to the boat to investigate up close‚Ä¶ and it leads us to the next library scene!\n\nShip‚Äôs library scene in Murder Ahoy! (1964)\n\nA little over an hour into the final film, Miss Marple is back to sleuthing and skulking again at night. There‚Äôs a ship‚Äôs library, which is clearly marked on the door (although there is no hint of a librarian on board the ship, not even when the crew introduced themselves earlier to Miss Marple).\n\nThe ship‚Äôs library looks pretty extensive, as multiple bookcases can be glimpsed behind Miss Marple. Even though, once again, there are NO CALL NUMBERS (sigh), Miss Marple easily finds the The Doom Box book on the shelves!\n\nThis is a vital clue, as it proves Miss Marple‚Äôs theory about the first murder. She later uses this same book to catch the killer in the final act!\n\nBooks, book, books\n\nBeyond the library, books themselves are quite important throughout the series ‚Äî providing information, clues, and sometimes even alibis! It makes sense to me that in a series with a recurring reel librarian character, that books themselves also tie in heavily into each film. Let‚Äôs explore how books are further highlighted in each film.\n\nBooks in Murder, She Said (1961)\n\nDuring the opening scene when Miss Marple travels on the 4.50 train to Paddington train, she is reading a pulp mystery novel, Death Has Windows by Michael Southcott. Turns out, this was a fictitious novel mocked up by the production team! This establishes the tone early on that Miss Marple loves to read mystery and detective novels. But that same pulp mystery novel, with its lurid cover, also leads the train attendant to think Miss Marple‚Äôs dreamed what she says she saw!\n\nThis theme continues, as near the end of the film, Miss Marple has a paperback copy of Murder is Easy by Agatha Christie. This time, the book is a real one, a novel Christie wrote that was published in the UK in 1939 and published as Easy to Kill in the U.S.\n\nAt almost 43 minutes into the film, Miss Marple calls up Mr. Stringer, who is in his pajamas in bed (scandale!), and we get to glimpse a tall stack of books on his bedside table. What I especially loved is that the book on top of the stack is entitled A Hell of a Woman.\n\nIndeed, Miss Marple is a hell of a woman. üòâ\n\nBooks in Murder at the Gallop (1963)\n\nAt 23 minutes into the second film, Inspector Craddock is interviewing Miss Milchrest, the companion to the murdered woman.\n\nInspector Craddock: When did you see her last?\n\nMiss Milchrest: Just before I went to the library.\n\nTrue, this is a direct reference to a library ‚Äî and an indirect reference to books in said library ‚Äî but I laughed out loud that a trip to the library was being used as an alibi!\n\nAnd was she referring to Mr. Stringer‚Äôs library? That part is never clearly stated, but it‚Äôs possible.\n\nBooks in Murder Most Foul (1964)\n\nI‚Äôve already mentioned how early on in this third film, Mr. Stringer hides amidst the jumble sale items in a wagon while Miss Marple distracts the murdered woman‚Äôs sister, Gladys. Mr. Stringer then poses as a bookseller ‚Äî a most appropriate ruse for a librarian, right?!\n\nGladys: Well, you are from the insurance, aren‚Äôt you?\n\nMr. Stringer: Oh, no, madam. No. I was hoping to interest you in improving your mind. I was wondering if you‚Äôd allow me to show you the new Wonder Book.\n\nAlthough Mr. Stringer first gets mistaken for an insurance salesman (hah!), he successfully distracts Gladys from Miss Marple snooping around upstairs. After Miss Marple comes back down the stairs, he hurries to help her out and leaves the Wonder Book with Gladys.\n\nAlmost an hour after that scene, at 1 hour and 15 minutes into the film, Miss Marple visits a theatrical agent, Mr. Tumbrill, who opens up a book to a large photograph of an actress. This photograph, along with Mr. Tumbrill‚Äôs information, provides a clue for Miss Marple to narrow down the potential murderer.\n\nBooks in Murder Ahoy! (1964)\n\nWe‚Äôve already gotten a lovely view of Miss Marple‚Äôs private library, as seen when she figures out the first murder was described in a book she has a personal copy of, entitled The Doom Box.\n\nHere are other titles that can be glimpsed in Miss Marple‚Äôs private library:\n\nThe Doom Box comes up again and again throughout this film!\n\nAt 1 hour and 10 minutes, Miss Marple describes the (second) murder to Inspector Craddock, and this murder is also outlined in The Doom Box! This conversation gets cut short when Stringer beans Craddock with a rock.\n\nThen, five minutes later, everyone is going ashore to participate in the festivities for Trafalgar Day. Everyone except for Miss Marple, of course. As everyone crowds around her state room, she displays the copy of The Doom Box that she took from the ship‚Äôs library.\n\nThis is a rattling good detective yarn, you know. I borrowed it from the ship‚Äôs library. I know only one of you has read it, but I suggest that all of you do. I‚Äôve just got up to the most exciting part, when ‚Äî. Well, I hope I won‚Äôt be giving too much away when I say the answer is a mousetrap.\n\nThis book is a (mouse)trap, of course, to catch the killer!\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs relationship with Miss Marple\n\nMiss Marple turns down two offers of marriages in the series (!!), neither one from Mr. Stringer. However, she alludes to Mr. Stringer while turning down an offer of marriage in Murder, She Said (1961):\n\nMiss Marple: If ever I do embark on such a venture, there is someone else.\n\nAnd in the very next scene, as Miss Marple leaves, Mr. Stringer is there to pick her up. (Always.) As they drive away, we see a sign a young boy hung on back of the car, a ‚ÄúJust Married‚Äù sign. Their close, affectionate relationship is front and center from the very beginning (and end!).\n\nThroughout the series, we also get treated to many closeups of Mr. Stringer looking adoringly at Miss Marple. It‚Äôs really quite touching, and this recurring theme brings in a very sweet and human aspect to this reel librarian character.\n\nAnd it wasn‚Äôt until I put the above collage together that I realized that Mr. Stringer is almost always seen, from the audience‚Äôs perspective, to the right of Miss Marple. A visual affirmation that he is her right-hand man? Makes me think of Wong in the Doctor Strange movie‚Ä¶\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs style\n\nMargaret Rutherford provided her own wardrobe for the Miss Marple movies, rewearing many of the same items throughout the entire series. I‚Äôm particularly enamored of her wool cape, complete with attached scarf. We see this cape for the first time as she heads out to the village library.\n\nMr. Stringer matches Miss Marple, tweed for tweed. (To my mind, it‚Äôs also highly likely that Stringer Davis is wearing his own clothes for the role, as his real-life wife did, but I have not read that confirmed anywhere.) As Mr. Stringer, he almost always dresses formally, in a suit and tie, befitting his professional status as a librarian. He also often wears a clock pin; ever practical and punctual, our Mr. Stringer. (Can you tell I have a soft spot for this reel librarian character? Bias alert!)\n\nAs you can see in the collage below, even when he‚Äôs washing dishes, he keeps his tie on! And when he‚Äôs bicycling or out and about, he often changes into a natty knickerbocker tweed suit and cap. And when he‚Äôs off duty, like when directing a community play in Murder Most Foul (1964), he‚Äôs still in tweeds, but in a jacket with a more unstructured cut. A little old-fashioned, sure, but he never wears anything impractical or inappropriate to the occasion.\n\nMr. Stringer in action\n\nAlthough there is only one major scene of Mr. Stringer, the village librarian, working in an actual library, we do get to see him being quite active outside the library. We see him riding a bicycle in Murder, She Said (1961) and a tricycle in Murder at the Gallop (1963). He also dons shorts (!) for a jog in Murder Most Foul (1964), and he gets in some nighttime rowing in Murder Ahoy! (1964).\n\nDare I suggest that Mr. Stringer has turned out to be one of the most physically active reel librarians ever?! Reminder: Stringer Davis was born in 1899, which means he was in his 60s during the filming of this series. #GoStringer\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions\n\nStringer Davis is a joy to watch in these films, due to his expressive face. I‚Äôve already mentioned the sweetness he conveys in his adoring gazes at Miss Marple. Even in a scene in which he had little to no dialogue, he shines because his face is always fully reacting in the moment. We get treated to multiple full-screen closeups of Mr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions in each film in the series. Bless.\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions in Murder, She Said (1961):\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions in Murder at the Gallop (1963):\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions in Murder Most Foul (1964):\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs facial expressions in Murder Ahoy! (1964):\n\nMr. Stringer‚Äôs words of wisdom\n\nHere are a few final, memorable quotes from this reel librarian character (beyond all the ‚ÄúDear me‚Äù and ‚ÄúBut, surely‚Äù remarks that often punctuate his conversations with the more forcible Miss Marple). Mr. Stringer‚Äôs character has been described as timid; I would venture that he is often the voice of caution and common sense.\n\nQuotes from Murder Most Foul (1964)\n\nI thought it advisable to get into peak condition for any emergency. Is there one already?\n\nI was hoping to interest you in improving your mind.\n\nI‚Äôll leave you the book, Mrs. Thomas. Brood on it, will you? Brood on it.\n\nQuotes from Murder at the Gallop (1963)\n\nI really must be getting back to the library, Miss Marple.\n\nI fear we‚Äôre taking the grave risk of seeming inquisitive.\n\nMiss Marple: ‚ÄòTittle-tattling busybody,‚Äô I believe were his words.\n\nMr. Stringer: No. Yours.\n\nQuotes from Murder, She Said (1961)\n\nMiss Marple, whatever it is: No, no, no.\n\nMiss Marple, prudence demands a retreat.\n\nFinal thoughts?\n\nI agree with Mr. Stringer, prudence demands a retreat here, too, regarding this blog post. We librarians gotta stick together! üòâ\n\nAny final thoughts you would like to add this deep dive into Mr. Stringer‚Äôs role in MGM‚Äôs Miss Marple series of movies? Have you seen one or all of the movies? Please leave a comment and share!\n\nSources used"
