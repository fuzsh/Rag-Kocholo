        "text": "Agatha Christie's celebrated detective, Hercule Poirot, in the somewhat surprising person of Tony Randall, fliply exposes himself as a \"Belgian snoop,\" thereby illustrating at the outset of this whodunit that Miss Christie's noted mystery and her hero are being given a light, perhaps farcical touch. Unfortunately, neither Mr. Randall's Poirot nor the gags, chases and red herrings offered are inventive, comical or charming enough to make this more than a routine run through of clichés and clues.In a quickly flashed, unbilled bit, the redoubtable Margaret Rutherford, as the Miss Marple of previous Agatha Christie films, says \"This is as simple as A.B.C.\"Well, it isn't, actually. In the script turned out by David Pursall and Jack Seddon, Poirot is not a searching, brilliant sleuth but a rather dandified, coy, occasionally foggy citizen given to skipping about and apparently fumbling through evidence to check on the seemingly schizophrenic, outsized beauty, played by Anita Ekberg, whom he suspects.Our boy can't be blamed too much, however. The plot convolutions are such that the lady's psychiatrist (Guy Rolfe), as well as James Villiers and others are in there from time to time to confuse matters in standard style. The basic idea is that someone, in some demented fashion, is dispatching unfortunates with the initials A.A., B.B., C.C., D.D.—get it? The denouement, it should be added, is as labyrinthine as any to come along in a long spell of sleuth epics.Before arriving at that gnarled ending, Robert Morley, as a frighteningly inept British intelligence agent assigned to protect Randall during his stay in London, plays the role with the ease of a natural-born bumbler who can't avoid being locked in closets or jailed in the clumsy pursuit of his duty. Tony Randall, on the other hand, has the benefit of superb makeup, which makes him a truly Victorian type with boulevardier's thin mustache, bald and \"a Belgian with a bit of a beak.\" Aside from the makeup, however, he is a rather tepidly dedicated snooper, given to airy remarks and a somewhat spurious Gallic pronunciation.Miss Ekberg is Amazonian and a bit unbelievable as the beauteous blond femme fatale who keeps haunting Poirot with leads to murders. Guy Roife is matter-of-fact as the amorous psychiatrist, Cyril Luckham, Sheila Allen and James Villiers help keep the investigators in doubt as obviously uneasy types and Maurice Denham, as a pipe-smoking inspector, is guaranteed to make authentic Scotland Yard operatives head for the hills in shame.Frank Tashlin, who directed this escapade in the broadest of styles, did manage to catch a truly humorous bit in having Poirot loudly interrogate a suspect in bed over the snores of his wife. And he has captured pictorial London, including the bridle path in Hyde Park.What he and his writers and cast have failed to do is to make Poirot and his intriguing gallery of friends and foes, the classic characters that have genuinely fascinated millions of Agatha Christie readers all these years. Poirot in pictures is simply an unexciting, bizarre \"Belgian with a beak\" involved in murders that are not especially exciting.\n\nThe CastTHE ALPHABET MURDERS; screenplay by David Pursall and Jack Seddon; based on Agatha Christie's novel, \"The A.B.C.
