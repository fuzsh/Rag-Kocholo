        "text": "The Amazon Original Series thriller Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders (2018) came to the United Kingdom as a BBC One release in December 2018 with a release to Amazon customers in January 2019. The 3-episode mini-series is set in 1930’s England as an adaptation for television from the 1936 release of Agatha Christie‘s book The ABC Murders.\n\n(Agatha Christie wrote The ABC Murders book, which was released in 1936).\n\nWe are introduced from the start to our chief and famed Belgian detective in England, one Hercule Poirot as portrayed by John Malkovich. Poirot is shown to have aged, perhaps lost some of the perceived braggadocio, and in a perpetual consideration of not being sufficient to stopping all murderous crime. Besides a hinted memory to occurrences dating back to Belgium preceding 1914, Poirot begins getting letters of a tone that suggesting bragging from a killer seeking attention for a serialized set of killings based on the alphabet. The locations will be disclosed, and the letters go to Poirot rather than the police.\n\n(John Malkovich as Hercule Poirot in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nContemporary to this, we are introduced to the new living arrangements for one Mr. Cust. Mr. Cust had received a shipment of stockings prior to his arrival, and only later are we introduced to the truths of his epilepsy, his headaches from a blow to the head received in World War One, and that the full name. Eamon Farren plays the role of Alexander Bonaparte Cust.\n\n(Eamon Farren as Alexander Bonaparte Cust in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nAt the point of receiving the first letter, prior to the commission of any murders, Hercule Poirot heads to his longtime aid in the police business Chief Inspector Japp. By The ABC Murders as a book, Christie was aging Chief Inspector Japp out of the series of Hercule Poirot books. This had not been a known quantity in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders, so Poirot is surprised to find that Japp has retired. Japp’s replacement with the police, Chief Inspector Crome, is portrayed by Rupert Grint of Harry Potter fame. Crome provides a significantly cold shoulder to Poirot by doubting his credentials, his background, even the validity of his background. Any notions of Belgium aren’t initially shared, though the vague notion of this past is engaged through the three episodes of the mini-series. Crome and Poirot have starkly different theories of the responsible parties through the mini-series.\n\n(Rupert Grint as Chief Inspector Crome in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nWhen frustrated by Chief Inspector Crome to a level where his confidence in the chief is hindering the investigation, Poirot reaches out to the retired Chief Inspector Japp. Kevin McNally plays Japp in the film, and vouches for the young Crome while advising Poirot to put the letters making it to his, Poirot’s, residence out of mind. The means of exit for Poirot’s police friend are rather unique and convincing.\n\n(Kevin McNally as Chief Inspector Japp in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nProgressing through the show from the first to the second episode, the notion of a calling card beyond simply the sending of letters originates with the passing has been increased to the leaving of exceptionally pronounced letters associated with each death in serial. First there is the death of Alice Asher in Andover, with a copy of The ABC Railway Guide featuring the letter A. Then there is the death of Elizabeth “Betty” Barnard in Bexhill some days later, which features the letter B from The ABC Railway Guide. The third prominent killing is Sir Carmichael Clarke in Churston with the letter C from The ABC Railway Guide. Christopher Villiers as Clarke signals the final correct killing per the alphabetical pattern, and clear suspicion of Alexander B. Cust looks as clear as ever.\n\n(Christopher Villiers as Sir Carmichael Clarke in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nIt is in the transition from the second to the third and final episode of the mini-series that the fourth deliberate killing, an error that kills Benny Grew rather than Dexter Dooley in Doncaster begins to unravel the pattern. The suspicions of Poirot and Crome could not be further apart, with Crome pursuing Mr. Cust and Poirot digging deeper, seeing the truth of the setup that has framed Mr. Cust through the Twinkle Toes nylon company who reveal, through thorough Poirot questioning, that Cust has been framed. This is where the Poirot observation early on that he suspected the murder was a male and female partnership, with one writing the letters while the other commits the murders, comes into play.\n\n(Freya Mavor as Thora Grey in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nThe third episode begins revealing a spotlight on Thora Gray and Franklin Clarke. The service personnel for Sir Carmichael Clarke had disliked Thora from the beginning, and she is threatened with expulsion from the Clarke household by Carmichael in the first episode of the mini-series. By the third episode, her relationship with Franklin is revealed, and the pieces begin to fit together more clearly. Freya Mavor portrays Thora Grey as Andrew Buchan portrays Franklin Clarke.\n\n(Andrew Buchan as Franklin Clarke in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nThe third episode brings together the serial murderer into focus, Chief Inspector Crowe and Poirot reconcile, using the intuition gained by the nylon investigation of Poirot. Some slick detection and trickery by Crowe and Poirot lead to the necessary evidence acquisition that reveals the true culprit or culprits of the crime, and who stood to benefit from the deaths. One other character remains alive and relevant as the story concludes, yet I deliberately fail to raise this party for the simple joy of wishing you, fair readers, the chance to enjoy the mystery that is Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders for yourself.\n\n(The ABC Railway Guide in Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders).\n\nWas the murderer Alexander Bonaparte Cust? Was it Franklin Clarke with an assist from Thora Gray? Was it somebody connected to Betty Barnard, Alice Asher, or someone from Doncaster? Has Poirot’s guilt over a failure of the past been justified in connection to the current crimes? I leave these for you to consider in deciding to watch Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders. My grade for the mine-series is 3.75-stars on a scale of one-to-five stars.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, April 17, 2019"
