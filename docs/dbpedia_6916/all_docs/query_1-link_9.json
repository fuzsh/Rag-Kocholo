        "text": "Except for the theme of a sequence of murder victims with names in alphabetical order, accompanied by the placement of an A.B.C. guide at the crime scene, this adaptation is radically different from the original book. Some of the characters have the same names as in the original but their backstories are significantly different as well. Even Hastings is not Poirot's regular partner but a secret service agent assigned to see Poirot safely out of the country.\n\nThe murders do not take place in towns in alphabetical order. All the events take place in London. Poirot is not drawn in the case by a series of warning letters. Here he is accosted at a turkish bath by an apparently psychotic blonde woman who says she must kill. She then escapes leaving behind a handbag with the initials A.B.C and a bowling score card. A.A. has already been killed--he is an \"aquaclown\", a stunt diver. The bowling card leads Poirot to B.B. (Betty Barnard) who in this case is a bowling alley instructress. Both Betty and Don Fortune, her boyfriend, seem to know of the woman A.B.C. but they don't give Poirot many details.\n\nBetty is killed shortly thereafter. By questioning Don Fortune, Poirot learns that A.B.C. is a woman he had tried to chat up, and that she is a patient of a psychiatrist Duncan Doncaster who had also wanted treat Betty Barnard. Doncaster is a nod to the town of Doncaster which in this adaptation, Poirot never goes to. He is the D.D.\n\nPoirot next meets Doncaster who tells him that A.B.C. is a schizophrenic case he has treated and that she has some obsession with the letters of the alphabet in sequence. By sneaking a look at Doncaster's patient index, Poirot learns that A.B.C. is Amanda Beatrice Cross, social secretary of shipping tycoon Sir Carmichael Clarke. Poirot is worried that Sir Carmichael, C.C. will be next.\n\nSir Carmichael doesn't believe Poirot's warnings and sends him packing but Poirot hides in the house and discovers Lady Diane Clarke (not at all an invalid, unlike the Lady Charlotte in the original novel) having an affair with Doncaster (he seems to have an affair with Betty Barnard and A.B.C. as well). Sir Carmichael also stumble on the lovers. There is a lot he does not know. Lady Diane tells him, for example, that his step brother Franklin Clarke is gambling away the family fortune at a night club.\n\nSir Carmichael goes to the nightclub and predictably, he is shot by a poison dart and killed.\n\nAll this while, a running gag has been the many efforts of Hastings (with the help of the police) to get Poirot to the airport and have him flown out of the country but Poiort somehow always escapes. Now Hastings decides the fastest way to get Poirot out is to help him solve the case, since Poirot refuses to let it go. Poirot reasons that someone must be harbouring A.B.C. or working in cahoots with her and they deduce it must be Doncaster. Hastings makes an anonymous call to Doncaster, warning that Poirot is closing in on A.B.C. As predicted, this smokes Doncaster out. He goes to look for Amanda to warn her. Poirot follows him onto a ship. Through a porthole and he sees Doncaster with Amanda in a cabin. But before Poirot can do anything else, he is knocked out.\n\nPoirot awakes to find himself in the cabin surrounded by Japp and the police. Doncaster is lying dead next to him. He has been killed by a poison dart and Japp is certain Amanda killed him. Poirot's attacker was Don Fortune. He had also followed Doncaster because he dislike him for his relationship with Betty.\n\nThe police discover Amanda in the dockyards. She tries to escape but is cornered and climbs up a crane. Poirot urges her to come down, assuring her that he knows she didn't do the killings and that he would help her. But she jumps into the water and disappears.\n\nThe police are satisfied that the case is solved but Poirot still has doubts. Talk of a red herring gives him and idea and he goes to Sir Carmichael's house. The butler tells him Lady Diane and Franklin had just departed on a train to Scotland with the coffin to embark on a ship. Sir Carmichael is to be buried at sea. Thereafter, Franklin and Lady Diane would go to South America for a respite.\n\nPoirot follows them on the train and corners Franklin in the luggage van. The body of Lady Diane is also there. She has just been poisoned by him. He accuses Franklin of being the mastermind behind the crimes. He stands to inherit a large fortune after all. Suddenly, out of a coffin, with a dart gun in hand, pops Amanda!\n\nPoirot reconstructs the crime for the two. Amanda had spent a stint in Switzerland supposedly on health grounds. There, she could have learnt stunt diving from A.A. She and Franklin then plotted the alphabetical killings to hide the motive for the killing of C.C. After D.D., Amanda pretended to commit suicide by jumping off the crane but she survived because she had learnt to do stunt diving from A.A. Now, Franklin with Amanda disquised as Lady Diane plan to escape by ship to South America. Lady Diane would be hidden in the coffin and buried at sea.\n\nAmanda, with a sneer, agrees that Poirot is right and prepares to kill him. But apparently Poirot has brought his \"insurance\". He gives a whistle and the van suddenly fills with policemen hidden in all sorts of unusual places.\n\nWhat are the themes carried over from the original novel?"
