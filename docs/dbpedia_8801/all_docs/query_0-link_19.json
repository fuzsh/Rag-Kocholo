        "text": "General presentation\n\nLast update : 05.02.2013 | Print this page\n\nTimişoara (Romanian pronunciation: [timiʃo̯ara], German: Temeschburg, also Temeswar or Temeschwar, Hungarian: Temesvár, Serbian: Темишвар, Temišvar, Turkish: Tamışvar or Temeşvar), is a city in the Banat region of western Romania. It is the capital of Timiş County.\n\nThe first record of the city of Timisoara, built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress called Castrum Regium Themes, dates back to 1212.\n\nOver the years, Timisoara, the largest city in western Romania, has been influenced by many cultures. The Romans used it as an important crossroads fortress until the Tatars destroyed it in the 13th century. Conquered by Turkish armies in 1552, Timisoara remained under their protection until 1718 when the region of Banat came under Austrian rule for two centuries. Timisoara later became a vital commercial and manufacturing town. Turks, Austrians, Germans and Serbs all left their mark and their influence can be seen in neighborhoods throughout the city even today.\n\nIn the 19th century, the railway system of the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom reached Timişoara. Timişoara was the first city in the country with international routes economic boom as the amount of foreign investment, especially in high-tech sectors, has risen. In terms of living standards, Timişoara ranks fourth nationwide. In an article in late 2005, French magazine L'Expansion called Timişoara Romania's economic showcase, and referred to the increased number of foreign investments as a \"second revolution\".\n\nWith 303,708 inhabitants (2011 census), Timişoara, the second largest Romanian city, considered the informal capital city of the historical region of the Banat, is the main economic and cultural center the West of the country.\n\nThe ethnic makeup, as of 2009, is as follows: 85.52% Romanian, 7.5% Hungarian, 2.25% German, 4.73% other. The Ukrainian community is currently growing, partly due to the presence of Ukrainian language educational facilities. In recent years, local investment by Italian companies has spurred the creation of an Italian community, even leading to calls for an Italian Cultural Center.\n\nThe charm of this city, settled on the northern bank of the Bega River, lies in its distinct architectural character and vibrant cultural life. Frequently referred to as \"Little Vienna,\" Timisoara is home to year-round musical and theatrical performances, art galleries, museums and a buzzing nightlife. A progressive, cosmopolitan place, Timisoara was the first city in Europe and second in the world after New York, to use electricity to illuminate its public streets.\n\nThanks to its mild climate, Timisoara has lots of public squares and lush green retreats. The city is easy to explore on foot. If you get tired, a tram will be along in a moment; the system is fast, frequent and efficient.\n\nTimisoara abounds with churches of several denominations, a Jewish quarter, an elegant baroque square and a pedestrian-only downtown area. Some of the monuments in the heart of the city afford panoramic views, while the many parks in this \"city of flowers\" provide an idyllic spot to take a break from sightseeing."
