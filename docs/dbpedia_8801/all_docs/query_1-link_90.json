        "text": "The heritage of Habsburg rule in Romania is conspicuously visible in the storied city centre of Timisoara, which has earned the city the nickname Little Vienna. Timisoara is one of the most populated cities in Romania, playing an integral role in fostering scientific and cultural development and serving as the regional capital of the Banat region. This year, the city further improved its prominence as the European Capital of Culture, jointly with Veszprem in Hungary and the sun-soaked Elefsina in Greece.\n\nThe slogan of Timisoara as the Europan Capital of Culture is: »Shine your light – Light up your city«. In the words of the organisers, the slogan mirrors the path of an individual to becoming an empowered and engaged European citizen whose core values are building a community and passion. It seems the idea correlates to the traditional diversity of the region. Romanians have co-existed harmoniously with Germans, Hungarians, Serbs, the Roma people, Czechs, Slovakians and Bulgarians in the region for centuries. The Mayor of Timisoara is the 39-year-old German political scientist Dominic Fritz, who once wrote speeches for the former German President Horst Köhler. Throughout the year, the city hosted several milestone events. One was the resounding art exhibition of Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși (1867 – 1957), showcasing the artist’s oeuvre from his most prolific years. The exhibition, hosted in the sculptor’s home country for the premier time after half a century, showcased his works, otherwise exhibited in the world’s preeminent museums. Timisoara is also a festival city. This year, 12 took place across the city, and around 30 events took place weekly. The eventful happenings concluded last week with a spectacular concert by Roisin Murphy and other concluding events as part of the “Neverending Timisoara” campaign.\n\nTimisoara is generally an exceptionally inviting city with a size comparable to Ljubljana. Its streets are bustling with life, exuding a relaxed way of living. Visitors can reach everything by foot, and tidy parks and lively alleys perennially strike guests. This year, several art installations made countless passing onlookers grin. One of the artworks is the five-storey project Nursery, home to 1,306 plants. The project was envisaged by architects from the Barcelona-based studio Maio. Timisoara is full of life 24/7. The legacy of this year’s European Capital of Culture is bound to live on.\n\nBefore the outbreak of COVID-19, Timisoara celebrated the opening of an incredible new convention centre. Opened in 2019, the Timisoara Convention Centre was designed by architects from the renowned Sundokovy Sisters bureau. Even though the architectural bureau had been known chiefly for its design of hotels, bars and public spaces, they graciously transferred their knowledge to the realm of convention centres and created a timeless building. Their brainchild is among Eastern Europe’s most modern convention centres, suitable for cultural events and congresses. The flawless design was tested this year as the city hosted events as part of the European Capital of Culture. The nascent convention centre appears elegant, spacious and transcendent. We were most impressed by natural materials, including stone, and the refined, clean lines adorned by wooden elements. Undoubtedly, the Timisoara Convention Centre is a venue of the future that heralds positive times for the meetings industry in this Western Romanian outpost. The vicinity of the Hotel Timisoara is an additional advantage.\n\nThe city is undergoing radical change. Recently, the ultra-modern Opera Hotel opened its doors, followed by boutique hotels such as Branco, Cosmopolita, Novera and others. According to our classification of destinations, Timisoara is a medium-sized destination, which means it is perfect for events for up to 1,200 attendees. One of the magnets luring event organisers is Timisoara’s page-long list of unique venues and the legacy created during its time as a European Capital of Culture.\n\nThe city has tremendous potential, especially given how the European Capital of Culture was exalted this year. Unfortunately, the city’s meetings industry has not made an alliance or created a well-functioning convention bureau yet. We believe a coherent organisation would facilitate the city’s surging development.\n\nTest the waters\n\nThe city is closely connected to water, which you can discover during a dedicated teambuilding programme curated by one of the local teambuilding agencies. They will prepare a memorable walk through the city that will uncover many secrets, often hidden beneath the earth. One of the core parts of the program is solving a quiz in groups that will go head-to-head on various topics. The teams must answer questions about the city’s history, culture and art. Accompanying games will ensure guests have a memorable experience. In the end, the team that answers most questions correctly wins. The tour begins at the losefin Water Tower, home to the first Romanian hydro-electric plant before ending at the Water Museum, a pearl of industrial architecture from the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe most typical local beverage you can come across in every house is ţuica [tsuˈika]. Ţuica is a distilled spirit made from plums that most people in the countryside prepare themselves. In some villages, there are smaller distilleries, while in towns, larger distilleries can be used by all locals. The amount of alcohol percentage depends on the region of Romania but usually varies from 30 to 60%. Making a quality ţuica is a matter of pride.\n\nRomanians are equally proud of the Banat cuisine, considered exceptionally diverse and inspired by the mix of cultures and national gastronomies living here. Thus, the cuisine combines German, Austrian, Romanian and Slavic influences. There is a slew of healthy dishes on the menu, including dumplings, strudel and various pastries. We definitely recommend trying the mouthwatering Timisoara version of paprikaš, the legendary grenadimarš or noodles with potatoes. Several restaurants in the city offer original Banat cuisine. Of course, there are global cuisines in Timisoara, too. If you are craving something while on the go, we recommend trying the excellent pretzels that come in endless variations.\n\nWe strongly believe it is high time that you consider Timisoara as a location for your next event. The destination will blow you away with its freshness and creative energy. It is famed for its multifaceted cultural layers and tolerance that stems from the co-existence of 21 cultures and religions. Moreover, organising events in this city is straightforward, as all venues and landmarks are reachable on foot. Having hosted the European Capital of Culture 2023, Timisoara now has the needed event infrastructure. In our opinion, Timisoara is a wow destination that you must offer a chance to stun you. Love at a second glance may last a lifetime. Event organisers can include several cultures and countries in their events here."
