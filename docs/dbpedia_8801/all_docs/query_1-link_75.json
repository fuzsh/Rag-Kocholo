        "text": "Where do you guys live?\n\nIoana and I both live in the same city. Situated in the Western part of Romania, Timisoara is the third biggest city in the country and at the same time the capital of the Timis county. Sometimes referred to as Little Vienna, Timisoara was the city where the Romanian Revolution started from and has recently been selected as European Capital of culture in 2021.\n\nYou can find more information about Timisoara on Wikipedia.\n\nHow can I get to Timisoara?\n\nThere are several options for getting to Timisoara.\n\nWhen leaving from Denmark, the airports that you should try searching flights to are:\n\nTimisoara, Romania: Ryanair – There is an option of flying to Timisoara from Billund through London Stansted but the tickets might be expensive in that period.\n\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (330 Km away) – Wizz Air flies to Cluj from Billund. From Cluj there are some flights to Timisoara with Bue Air but I do not know how regular and if they suit the times connection wise, but in case there is nothing suitable for connections then I will ensure that you will be picked up and driven to Timisoara.\n\nBudapest, Hungary (300 Km away) – Ryanair has direct flights to Budapest from Billund, other companies also have flights but they are more expensive. If you choose to go there I will have someone to pick you up an drive you to Timisoara.\n\nBucharest, Romania (600 Km away) – Wizz Air flies to Bucharest from Billund. There are also some daily flights from Bucharest to Timisoara with Ryanair or Tarom but I do not know how good they will suit you in terms of connections. If you choose to come there I can also insure that a car will pick you up but please bear in mind that the drive will be longer.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia (150 Km away) – I have never used this route so I cannot give any advice here but in case you find something convenient to and from there I can also insure that you will be picked up or driven back to the airport.\n\nWhen leaving from UK:\n\nThere are direct flights daily from London to Timisoara with different airlines. According to Momondo the best choice would be Ryanair (please disregard the dates chosen by me, you are more than welcome to come earlier and leave later).\n\nWhen leaving from Lithuania:\n\nI have only managed to find a flight on Momondo from Kaunas to Budapest which is acceptable in terms of flight duration but a bit expensive in my opinion (please disregard the dates chosen by me, you are more than welcome to come earlier and leave later).\n\nI would suggest that you try flying through London or Billund to one of the airports mentioned in the previous sections if that is more suitable. I will arrange that you are picked up from and taken to the airport.\n\nRecommendations:"
