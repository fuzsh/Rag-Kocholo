        "text": "...\n\nTimişoara Fast Facts\n\n...\n\nTimiÈoara Info\n\nTimisoara, the largest city in western Romania, grew around the site of Castrum Regium Themes (Castri de Thymes), an ancient Roman crossroad fortress. Although surrounded by marshlands, in 1241, Timisoara was invaded and partially destroyed by the Tatars. In 1552, the Turkish armies conquered Timisoara and kept the town under their authority until 1716 when the region of Banat came under Austrian rule. Soon after the Habsburg Empire took over the Banat region, from the Ottomans, the new governor of Banat, General Mercy, commisioned a heptagram-shaped bastion with strong walls, towers and gates. During early 1720s large numers of Swabian immigrants settle in Timisoara. The Swabians - skilled craftsmen from Swabia, southern Germany - helped transform Timisoara in a major commercial and manufacturing town. Austrians, Germans, Jews, Serbians and Hungarians all left their mark during the two centuries of Austrian domination of Timisoara. More on history of Timisoara.\n\nThe first chocolate producer in Romania was founded in Timisoara in 1890.\n\nToday, artisanal chocolate manufacturer Chantia continues the city's chocolate-making tradition.\n\nChantia offers chocolate-lovers 40 different kinds of pralines, all made from pure cocoa butter Belgian-style chocolate.\n\nThe charm of Timisoara, a city settled on River Bega, lies in its distinct architectural character, ample green spaces and vibrant cultural life. Frequently referred to as \"Little Vienna\", Timisoara is home to year-round musical and theatrical performances, art galleries, museums, cosy restaurants and cafes and a buzzing nightlife.\n\nFrancesco Illy, inventor of illeta - considered the blueprint for modern espresso machine - was born in Timisoara in 1892. Illy also developed an innovative packaging technique based on pressurization; his method remains the industry's standard for preserving and enhancing coffee freshness during transport and storage.\n\nA progressive, cosmopolitan place, Timisoara was the first city in Europe and second in the world, after New York, to use electricity to illuminate its streets.\n\nIn 1869 TimiÈoara introduced public transport with horse-drawn trams, a premiere in Europe.\n\nThanks to its mild climate, Timisoara has lots of public squares and lush green retreats. The city is easy to explore on foot. For those to prefer to travel a little faster, a tram will be good option; Timisoara's public transport system is fast, frequent and efficient.\n\nTimisoara abounds with churches of several denominations, a Jewish quarter, an elegant baroque square and a pedestrian-only downtown area. Some of the monuments in the heart of the city afford panoramic views, while the many parks in this \"city of flowers\" provide an idyllic spot to take a break from sightseeing.\n\n...\n\nTimisoara Sights and Landmarks\n\nThe abundance of Secessionist architecture gave Timisoara its rather appropriate moniker, \"Little Vienna\". Secessionism developed in two distinct architectural phases in the city. Sinuous lines and floral decorations characterized the first phase which lasted until 1908. The second phase, which continued until the First World War, saw simpler, larger buildings with geometrical designs. Secessionism in Romania was an important link between the Byzantine style and later modernist architecture.\n\nTimisoara is home to six, ample, public squares surrounded by monumental buildings. Three of them: Piata Libertatii, Piata Unirii and Piata Victoriei are located in the historic centre (Cetate neighborhood) while the other three are found in the city's main neighborhoods: Elisabetin (Piata Balcescu), Fabric ( Piata Traian ) and Iosefin ( Piata Maria ).\n\nPiata Victoriei (Victory Square)\n\nSome of the city's most interesting sites are its elegant baroque buildings. They can be found allover the city and around Piata Victoriei. Piata Victoriei was created in 1906 when Timisoara medieval fortifications were demolished to create an esplanade that stretches from Opera Piazetta to the Romanian Orthodox Mitropolitan Cathedral.\n\nThe focal point is the towering Romanian Orthodox Mitropolitan Cathedral (Catedrala Ortodoxa Mitropolitana) that lies on the southern edge of the square. As most parts of TimiÈoara city-centre are built on a swamp, 5,000 oak logs were needed to support the city's emblematic structure that can accommodate 5,000 worshipers. One of the easily recognizable features of the cathedral is its roof made of green and red ceramic tiles, arranged in a mosaic design. In front of the Cathedral lies a memorial that remembers those who lost their lives during the 1989 Revolution which overthrew the Communist regime. Insights into the 1989 revolution are oferred by the Memorial Museum of the 1989 Anti-Communist Revolution (Muzeul RevoluÈiei), located 0.5 miles north of the cathedral. Other monumental buildings facing Piata Victoriei include Erno Neuhausz Palace, Lloyd Palace, Weiss Palace, Merbl Palace, Dauerbach Palace, HÃ¢lt Palace, Szechenyi Palace and Loffler Palace and the National Opera.\n\nPiata Unirii (Union Square)\n\nThe picturesque Habsburg-era Piata Unirii is lined by imposing structures that include places of worship of different denominations, public institutions and historic pastel-hued buildings. During the 18th century, the Union Square was Timisoara's commercial centre and the venue for military ceremonies and religious processions. Piata Unirii structures of note include:\n\nNicolas Lenau College (Liceul Nicolas Lenau), built in 1761 and former home to the earliest theatre in Timisoara.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Cathedral (Catedrala Orthodoxa Sarba) completed in 1748 and the Serbian Bishop's Residence ( Vicariatul Ortodox Sarb). Its mint green and white facade with rich decorations is spectacular.\n\nThe Roman-Catholic Cathedral (Catedrala Episcopala Romano-Catolica), built between 1736 and 1754 after plans by Fisher von Erlach, the architect that profoundly influenced and shaped the tastes of the Habsburg Empire. A fine example of Viennese baroque style the Roman-Catholic Cathedral is also known for its he main altar murals, completed by Michael Angelo Unterberger, director of the Fine Arts Academy in Vienna.\n\nThe impressive 18th century Baroque Palace (Palatul Vechii Prefecturi) dominates Unirii Square's south side. Formerly the governor's residence, Timisoara Baroque Palace now houses the Museum of Fine Arts. One of museum's highlights is the rich colletion of works by German, Flemish and Italian artists.\n\nAt the northwest corner of Piata Unirii stands the spectacular Scont Bank (Banca de Scont). This typical Art Nouveau structure, built in the early 20th century, features an organic shape comprising curved walls studded with turquoise tiles forming patterns drawn from folklore, and extravagant iron gutters and window grills.\n\nFrom Piata Unirii, walk 0.1 milesa east along Str. Palanca to the oldest, still standing, building in Timisoara, the 18th century Maria Theresia Bastion now home of Banat Region Etnography Museum.\n\nPiata Primariei Vechi / Piata Libertatii (Old Townhall Square or Freedom Square)\n\nAnother remarkable, large, square in Timisoara is Piata Libertatii, now called by the locals the Red Square. The new name was inspired by the coloer of the tiles used to re-do the pavement in 2014.\n\nMonumental buildings facing Timisoara Old Townhall Square include: Timisoara Garrison Headquarters, Old Townhall, Palace of Agricultural Bank, Palace of Credit Bank. From Piata Primariei Vechi continue along Str. Lucian Blaga to the 14th century Huniade Castle (Castelul Huniade). Built in the early 1300s, the castle was expanded in the mid-1400s and redesigned by the Habsburgs in the 18th century.\n\nTimisoara Residential areas\n\nSouth and east of the Bega Canal are the Elisabetin, Fabric and Iosefin residential districts, true gems of Jugendstil, or art nouveau, architecture, built mainly in the late 19th century. The small residential square of Piata Plevnei, south of the Bega Canal, is bordered by excellent examples of the first phase of Secessionist architecture, such as Gemeinhardt's Peacock House (Casa cu Pauni) built in 1905. Facades are covered with an abundance of typical motifs: peacocks, swans, owls and squirrels together with sinuous vines and foliage. The theme continues on the buildings lining Splaiul Tudor Vladimirescu, following the south bank of the Bega, and to a lesser extent, around nearby Piata Maria and Bulevardul 16 Decembrie 1989.\n\nSecessionist, or Art Nouveau architecture also can be found in the cities of Arad (especially on Strada Closca and Piata Avram Iancu), Oradea (Vulturul Negru and Astoria hotels), Cluj (Odon Lechner National Theatre), Satu Mare and Targu Mures (Palace of Culture).\n\n...\n\nJewish Timisoara\n\nEven though Jewish presence in the Banat region dates back to the 2nd century AD, the first written mention of the Jewish community in Timisoara occurred in 1716, when the Turkish army commander surrendered the town to the Austrian Prince Eugeniu of Savoia.\n\nIn the old Sephardic cemetery, graves dating to the Turkish occupation may be seen, the oldest belonging to Azriel Assael, a Rabbi and surgeon who died in 1636. A century latter, Rabbi Meir Amigo and four followers from Istanbul were allowed to settle in the city. Following the implementation of citizen rights acts in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Timisoara's Jewish community flourished, reaching a population of almost 7,000. Six synagogues were built in the city after 1867, the year of the Austro-Hungarian reconciliation. Today, three are still standing with one still active.\n\nThe Great Synagogue - Fabric Synagogue\n\nSinagoga din Fabric\n\nAddress: Strada Ion Luca Caragiale 1\n\nOne of the most beautiful buildings in Timisoara, the Great Synagogue or Fabric district synagogue, was built in 1899 after plans by architect LipÃ³t Baumhorn, in traditional Moorish style.\n\nTimiÈoara Great Sinagogue more info .\n\nThe New Synagogue\n\nSinagoga Cetate\n\nAddress: Strada MÄrÄÈeÈti 6\n\nThis Neolog-rite synagogue, built in Oriental style in 1865, resembles the great synagogue in Oran, Algeria.\n\nOne of the largest synagogues in Europe (the synagogue can accommodate up to 1,500 worshipers), it is currently closed for repairs.\n\nTimisoara New Synagogue more info .\n\nThe Orthodox Synagogue\n\nSinagoga Iosefin\n\nAddress: Strada Gheorghe Pop de BÄseÈti (Iosefin district)\n\nBuilt between 1906 and 1910, the Orthodox Synagogue is the only one still in service, at this time.\n\nIosefin Synagogue more info .\n\n...\n\nTimisoara Museums\n\nMuseum of Banat Region\n\nMuzeul NaÈional al Banatului\n\nAddress: Piata Huniade 1\n\nTelephone: (+4) 0256 491.339\n\nE-mail\n\nOpen: Tue. - Sun.: 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nAdmission charge\n\nHoused in Huniade castle (14th century), the Museum of Banat region is home to an impressive collection of historical artifacts, exhibited in five distinctive: archeology, history, natural science, technology, Lapidarium.\n\nBanat Museum - Ethnography Section\n\nMuzeul NaÈional al Banatului - Sectia de Etnografie\n\nAddress: Str.

The first identifiable civilisation in Banat region (western Romania) were the Dacians who left traces of their past; historians believe that the current location of TimiÈoara corresponds to the Dacian settlement of Zurobara. (coordinates given by geographer Ptolemy in Geographike Hyphegesis place Timisoara in the northwest of Banat). 9th century\n\nVoivode Glad rules over Banat.

Designated as the residence of the governor, Timisoara maintained all its privileges of a free royal city.\n\n1860\n\nThe Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\n1867\n\nDirect Hungarian rule began, following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 / establishment of the dual monarchy.\n\nEnd of the 19th century\n\nTimisoara experiences extensive modernization and fast economic and demographic growth.
