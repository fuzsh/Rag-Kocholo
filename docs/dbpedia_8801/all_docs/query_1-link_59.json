        "text": "Ara Malikian, one of the most brilliant and expressive violinists of his generation, will perform in Timișoara as part of THE ARA MALIKIAN WORLD TOUR. He will be accompanied by the LIRA Symphony Orchestra of the Timișoara Municipal House of Culture. Conductor: Radu Popa. Concertmaster: Cristian Dragalina. Partner: Union of Armenians of Romania.\n\nWith a fencer's look and agility, Ara Malikian is a showman who offers a completely atypical violin performance. This eccentric maestro has become famous for his versions of well-known themes, from Bach to Bjork, Radiohead, or Pulp Fiction, to Angheluș Dinicu's \"Ciocârlia.\"\n\nEnjoy the summer in Timișoara!\n\nThis year's edition of \"City Celebration\" offers you a series of premiere concerts in the city on the Bega, organized by the Timișoara Center for Projects, and over 100 cultural, sports, and community events for all ages, produced by organizations in Timișoara and funded through the Center for Projects.\n\nParcul Civic, the Bega River, and all the spaces that will be activated, both upstream and downstream, create in 2024 a route for exploring and (re)discovering the city, along the water that unites the community.\n\nFree admision."
