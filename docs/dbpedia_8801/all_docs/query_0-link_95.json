Its territory is currently in south-western Romania and northern Serbia (eastern Vojvodina). The capital of the county was Timişoara (Hungarian: Temesvár, Serbian: Temišvar).\n\nGeography\n\nTemes county was located in the Banat region. It shared borders with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Hungarian counties of Torontál, Arad and Krassó-Szörény. The river Danube formed its southern border, and the river Mureş (Hungarian: Maros, Serbian: Moriš) its northern border. The river Timiş flowed through the county. Its area in 1910 was 7,433 km².\n\nHistory\n\nTemes County was formed in the 11th century. The county was taken by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, and was included into the Ottoman Province of Temeşvar. After the Banat was captured by the Habsburgs in 1718, the area of the county was included into the Banat of Temeswar, a separate Habsburg province. This province was abolished in 1778, and the area of the county was incorporated into Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1860 the area of the county was part of Voivodship of Serbia and Tamiš Banat, a separate Austrian crown land. Temes County was re-established in the 1860s, when the area was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn 1918, the county first became part of the newly formed Banat Republic, and then was divided between Romania and the also newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. A majority of the county was assigned to Romania, while the south-western third was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929).\n\nThe Yugoslav part of the pre-1918 Temes County (the southern Banat region) is currently part of the Serbian autonomous region of Vojvodina. The Romanian part is now part of Timiş County, except a 10 km wide strip along the Mureş River, which is in the Romanian Arad County.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the census of 1910, the county had 500,835 inhabitants.\n\nPopulation by language (1910 census):\n\n*Romanian = 169,030 (33.75%)\n\n*German = 165,883 (33.12%)\n\n*Hungarian = 79,960 (15.97%)\n\n*Serbian = 69,905 (13.96%)\n\n*Slovak = 3,080\n\nubdivisions\n\nIn the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Temes county were:"
