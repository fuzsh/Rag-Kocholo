        "text": "1. Taste the local food!\n\nThe Banat region is a multi-ethnic and multicultural melting pot where the traditions and culinary customs of the romanians, hungarians, croatians, serbs,bulgarians and even the french have harmoniously merged. Even the most Romanian of foods have influences from the surrounding nations incorporated into it.\n\n16 restaurants in Timișoara - among which Casa Bunicii is proudly included - are currently included on a signposted route of Banat’s gastronomy.\n\nThe Banat region gastronomy route was created by the Association for the Promotion and Development of Tourism in Timiș County and the Horetim Employers' Association, which completed the project to promote the local cultural and gastronomic heritage \"Taste the diversity in the Banat dialect\".\n\nAt Casa Bunicii we serve tasty traditional food from Banat because it has the taste of our childhood. It's the food we grew up with.\n\nThe influences of Banat's culinary multiculturalism are present at every step in our menu: Hungarian and Viennese goulash: Viennese schnitzel: braised red cabbage (bazarese) with baked duck leg: slightly sweeter salads: not so sour soups, only using sour cream, not vinegar: Serbian rice: homemade vegetable pot: various sauces - cherry, dill, sage or tomato: typically German and local desserts such as krempita, plum gomboti and sweet cheese pancakes, raisins and vanilla sauce.\n\nInstead of the traditional chicken soup with noodles that was on the tables of Banat residents every Sunday, at Casa Bunicii you can order duck soup with fluffy semolina dumplings, the duck gives the soup a special flavor and an intense golden color and the dumplings floating on the surface , a special elegance and distinction.\n\nThe traditional Spatzle (Swabian dumplings) can be tried in various combinations: with ribs, mushrooms, meat, cheese or vegetarian. A homemade raspberry or elderberry syrup completes the meal.\n\nThe recipes have been adapted so that they can be delivered in a reasonable amount of time to hungry customers eager to try grandma's dishes. A diverse traditional, rustic Banat menu perfect for savoring slowly.\n\nhttps://www.casa-bunicii.ro/post/la-casa-bunicii-va-ofer-mancare-traditionala-din-banat-pentru-ca-are-gustul-copilariei-mele\n\n2. Visit the historic center!\n\nOne of the top 10 things to do in Timisoara is to visit historical center of Timișoara, with its three urban squares which seem like they’ve been taken straight out of a tale - Unifications Square, Liberty Squre and Victor Square, can be included in a mini-city tour that reviews the beautiful buildings representative of the Secession style, churches, synagogues, artistic institutions , parks and gardens, Turkish, Jewish and Austrian Timișoara, but also the hotspots of the 1989 Revolution, when we became the first city free from communism in Romania.\n\nIn Citadel District you can visit historical buildings like: the Huniade Castle, the Dicasterial Palace, the Baroque Palace, the National Theater and Opera of Timisoara, the Dauerbach Palace, the Lloyd Palace, the House of Prince Eugene of Savoy, the old Town Hall, the House of the Count of Mercy, the Brück House, the Rooster Building, The Roman Catholic Episcopal Palace, the House with the Iron Axis, the Church and the Serbian Orthodox Palace.\n\n- A possible starting point for a walk through Victory Square is the Metropolitan Cathedral - dedicated to the Three Holy Hierarchs, completed in 1940, founded by King Mihai and built in the Byzantine style. Here you can see the relics of Saint Joseph the New from Partoș, and visit the museum with the collection of old religious art from Banat.\n\n- The Ernő Neuhausz Palace - an integral part of the Secession palace complex in Victory Square, is one of the main attractions of the city. The palace was built in 1910 by the entrepreneur Ernő Neuhausz from Timisoara and designed by the architect László Székely in the period’s style, with the most refined ornaments on the Corso. It is located in a continuous front of monument Secession buildings, between the Lloyd Palace and Arnold Merbl Palace. \"The building stands out for its facade, specific to the second manifestation of the Secession current in the architecture of Timisoara. The decorations are geometric and simplified, but the play of textures subtly rhythms the field of the facade\", we learn from the history of the building. In 1922, it appears under the name Farber Palace in the Golden Pages, because shortly after its completion it came into the possession of Bernat Farber, the owner of a textile wholesale store in Fabric district and a member of the leadership of the Jewish community. It is the family that founded the Azur paint factory. John Farber is today the owner of the Neuhausz Palace in Victory Square.\n\nhttps://ghidulbanatului.ro/palatul-neuhausz-bijuterie-arhitecturala-din-inima-timisoarei-proprietatea-apartine-unui-miliardar-american_15424.html\n\nA review of Timișoara's historic Art Nouveau/Secession buildings, with their stories and architects, can be accessed here:https://heritageoftimisoara.ro/cladiri/stil/Art+Nouveau+Secession\n\n- On the cobblestones of Liberty Square and St. George Square, you can see marked the location where the hamam (Turkish public bath), the bazaar (market), the Central Mosque and the Turkish cemetery were.\n\nhttps://ghidulbanatului.ro/povestea-bailor-turcesti-din-timisoara-otomana-ce-inseamna-kulliye-soyunmalik-si-iliklic_8769.html\n\n- The Maria Theresia Bastion - originally called the Ravelin of the Provision Store, used to store food - is part of the old Stronghold of Timisoara, which was completely rebuilt in the Vauban style between 1730-1735, after the Habsburgs conquered the city (in 1716). The bastion represents a small testimony of history that has survived to this day, along with the wall fragments from the Botanical Park and Calea Alexandru Ioan Cuza.\n\nHere is the National Museum of Banat, which hosts various exhibitions.\n\nhttps://ghidulbanatului.ro/ravelinul-depozitului-de-proviant-o-bijuterie-istorica-a-timisoarei-capitala-culturii-europene_13568.html\n\n- Located inside the walls of the former citadel, “Unification” is the oldest square in the city and houses the most beautiful historical monuments. You can easily lose a few hours admiring all the details of the buildings. This place has such a pleasant vibe that you won't want to leave and it can aditionally be compared to the most impressive markets in Europe.\n\n- The Holy Trinity statue is located in the center of Union Square and was erected in memory of the victims of the plague epidemic in 1738-1739. The statue was made in baroque style, being commissioned in Vienna and brought to Timişoara by way of the Danube, Tisza and Bega rivers.\n\n- Perhaps the most representative building in Unification Square is the Roman Catholic Cathedral. Its construction was carried out in two stages, namely 1736-1751 and 1755-1774. It is a true example of the baroque style, and the interior is rich, especially with the nine altars, in rococo and baroque style. Recently, it has been extensively renovated, and from April 2023, on Saint George's Day, it is ready to host religious ceremonies again, after a break of over four years.\n\n- The Baroque Palace was built in the second half of the 18th century and is incredibly similar to the Kinsky Palace in Vienna. It houses the National Art Museum.\n\n- The Prenner House has been attested since 1812. In 1848, a carpentry and a locksmith shop operated here. From the point of view of the architectural style, the building belongs to the eclectic historicist style.\n\n- The Brück House, the most impressive and photogenic building in the center of Timișoara, was built in the Art Nouveau and Secession styles, featuring Hungarian folklore motifs. The house can be admired on Mercy street no. 9, corner with Unification Square. It is a narrow, four-level building that is reminiscent of Amsterdam. It was built in 1910, according to the plans of two famous architects, Székely László and Arnold Merbl. After the construction of the building was completed, the owner Salamon Brück established a pharmacy on the ground floor of the building. To this day it is still open, keeping some of the old furniture.\n\nhttps://ghidulbanatului.ro/secretele-casei-bruck-cel-mai-impresionant-si-fotogenic-imobil-din-centrul-timisoarei_5901.html\n\n- Completed in 1909, in Art Nouveau style, on three floors, the Miksa Steiner Palace is one of the most appreciated buildings in Timisoara. It is also known as the Former Discount Bank, due to the symbols found on the building, the beehive. It looks like a gingerbread house.\n\n- Unification Square has a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere, you can still feel the vibe of the old days. Every Sunday you can witness a changing of the guard as it used to be, walking past the house of Mr. Lazar Lazarovits, which in 1828 was the headquarters of the La Trei Husari restaurant, or the house of Elisabetha Dadan, which housed the most famous inn of those times, La Elefant.\n\n- The Serbian Orthodox Episcopal Palace was built in 1745 in the Baroque style. In 1905, the interventions of the architect Laszlo Szekely introduced a new style of facades, which included neo-Byzantine influences.\n\n- The facade of the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral faces Emanoil Ungureanu Street. It was built between the years 1745-1748 from stone and brick and has rich decorations in baroque style.\n\n- The Sârbești Community House was built in classicist style with baroque influences, in 1786. The restoration in 2008 highlighted the double Doric semi-columns at the entrance gate, the building having the charm of bygone times.\n\n- At the exit from Unification square you can meet the “U” Barracks, which is still waiting to be transformed from a ruin towering in the city center into a five-star hotel accompanied by an art gallery.\n\n- You can end your visit in the center of Timisoara with a walk through the Botanical Park. Initially, there was a botanical garden here with an area of ​​9 hectares, inaugurated in 1986, which had over 1,650 species of plants. Currently the garden is a public park, which still has 200 species of plants. It's still a perfect place to reconnect with nature right in the middle of the city.\n\nhttps://instatravel.ro/timisoara-obiective-si-atractii-turistice/\n\nFor those who come to Timișoara for the first time and want to benefit from a guided tour of the city, trust the Timișoara City Tours guides.\n\nhttps://www.casa-bunicii.ro/post/ghid-turistic-in-timisoara\n\n3. Walk along the banks of Bega canal!\n\nThere is no way to come to Timișoara and not walk along the banks of the Bega Canal. On foot, by bike or by boat, the ride will surely delight you. Spring is a perfect time to visit the city, especially if you catch the magnolias and cork oaks in bloom. On your walk you will meet athletes who are kayaking on the Bega.\n\n- If you start the walk from the Cathedral Park, you will discover the lovers' tunnel.\n\n- At the beginning of April, Justice Park impresses with the very large number of blooming tulips.\n\n- The Rose Park, however, is more beautiful in summer, being full of roses that create a great view. In the interwar period, there were over 1,200 labeled rose varieties here. In the park, the Festival of Hearts, the Folklore Festival of Ethnic Minorities and the Gastronomic Festival are organized.\n\n- You will meet on your way the Ion Creangă Children's Park and the Lovers' Walkway, a pedestrian bridge to the Regina Maria Park named so because of the padlocks that couples tie here since 2012. Today, several hundred locks - of all shapes and colors - hang heavily on the walkway fence.\n\n- Regina Maria Park is the oldest park in Timisoara. Here in the spring you can find a little corner of heaven, the gorgeous magnolias beautify the place.\n\n- From the restaurant of the Beer Factory you can go to the Decebal Bridge, where you can hop on the ferry.\n\n- On the banks of the Bega river, you will find the Water Plant, the experimental physics laboratory “Experimentarium TM\" inaugurated by the university environment in the Park of Roses for the first time for students and young people who want to discover science in a fun and magical way. You can rest, restore and relax by stopping at one of the many terraces.\n\n- Alpinet Park is the most visited by tourists, as it is very close to the center. From here you can once again admire the Metropolitan Cathedral.\n\nhttps://instatravel.ro/timisoara-obiective-si-atractii-turistice/\n\n- Timișoara was the first city in Romania with public water transport, which was reopened in 2018 with seven vaporetto boats - bearing historical names - and nine stations for regular runs. Five of the seven steamboats are painted by artists.\n\n- There are six leisure walking routes on the Bega Canal.

Visit the museums!\n\n- The Communist Consumers’s Museum was opened in 2015 as a result of a private initiative. Although small, it is the most visited museum in Timișoara, ranking 6th among the city's tourist attractions, after Unification Square, Liberty Square, Victory Square, the Cathedral and the Bega bank. Arranged in the basement of a house in the Elisabetin area, where the Scârț-Loc Lejer cafe also operates, as well as the Auăleu theater, in the form of a typical “Golden Age” home - with a living room, children's room, kitchen, storeroom, hall and bathroom - the museum includes practically everything Romanians had at home: from household items, furniture, clothing, household appliances, toys, trinkets, stationery to cosmetics or kitchen products. The indispensable siphons, glass fish, Fram fridge and dial telephone are present. The dark atmosphere, the many, cheap and cramped objects, the difficulty of sneaking among the furniture and trinkets awaken the memories and nostalgia of Romanians who lived their childhood and youth like this, but also the curiosity of foreigners and influencers. It can be visited for free, there are no staff, supervisors or tickets. Just you alone with your memories.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/muzeuconsumatorcomunist/?locale=ro_RO\n\n- The exhibitions within \"(r)evolution? lived histories 1945-1989-2022\" are permanent and can be visited from Tuesday to Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., and on Saturday between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. :00, at the headquarters of the Revolution Memorial Associaciation (str.

The \"Cultural Branch at the Water Plant\" project connects water and culture, people and industrial heritage. The museum complex is part of the Urseni Factory, and its main building - known among Timisoara residents as the Flying Saucer - is a monument of industrial architecture, designed by the famous architect László Székely.

Here you will be able to admire a wide selection of his photographic work, alongside works on paper and video fragments filmed by Brâncusi himself, completing all the portraits of this great artist of the 20th century.\n\nhttps://curatorial.ro/arta/expozitiile-eveniment-din-cadrul-timisoara-capitala-europeana-a-culturii-prezentate-la-paris/\n\n7.
