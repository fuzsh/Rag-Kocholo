        "text": "The nobles of the Jakšić family were among the most representative members of the Serbian elite from late medieval Hungary. The Jakšić brothers took refuge in Hungary and settled near the Mureș River in Nădlac (Csanád County). Later, King Matthias donated to them various estates in several counties of his realm, including Transylvania. Although Transylvanian archives contain a substantial amount of data on the family, this has not been thoroughly researched. Documents presented in this study have not been previously published, except for the one from April 1559. They are found in the archives in Sibiu, Cluj and Oradea and they chronologically cover the period of the 16 th century, containing information on both branches of the Jakšić family. Documents from the Romanian archives do not fundamentally change the established view on this family, but they supplement our knowledge and cast light upon some controversial or less known aspects of the history of the noble Jakšićs in medieval and early modern times."
