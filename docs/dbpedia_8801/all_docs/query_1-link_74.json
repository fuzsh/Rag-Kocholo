        "text": "Georgi says: “If you appreciate a good cultural heritage, Timisoara is the place for you. It can enrich, can be fun and romantic! “\n\nTimisoara is the largest city of Timis County, Banat, Romania.\n\nThe name of the city comes from River Timis which in the ancient times the Romans used to call either Tibiscus or Tibisis.\n\nTimisoara is situated in the western part of Romania, between the two great rivers: Timis and Bega.\n\nIt is the third largest city in the country and is an important historical, economic, financial, cultural and scientific center with a large community of foreigners Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Serbs.\n\nThe culture in this area is influenced by various ethnic communities, especially the German, Hungarian and Serbian, but also the Bulgarian, Italian and Greek.\n\nThe rich and diverse cultural heritage of Timisoara placed the city among the first three after Bucharest and Iasi.\n\nThere are three main theaters in Timisoara through which great performances are being offered in Romanian, German and Hungarian: National Theatre, German and Hungarian Theatre.\n\nThese three institutions share the same building with the Romanian Opera.\n\nBanat Philarmonic it is also worth mentioning as on its scenes performed big names like Franz Liszt, Brahms, Strauss son, Enescu and on February 9th, 1855 the premiere of Verdi‘s Traviata.\n\nTimisoara is also a charming place through its many parks, green spaces and public gardens that are studded with charming flowers and made people known it as “The City of Parks”.\n\nFurthermore due to its various architecture and Viennese Baroque influences, Timisoara is also called “Little Vienna”.\n\nAnother extremely interesting aspect which I found fascinating (as this is about my own country) is that Timisoara was the first European city which had its streets lighted with electricity (12 November 1884).\n\nAlthough from a culturally point of view Timisoara has many options of entertainment, don’t think there are not as many when it comes to having a good fun by enjoying going to restaurants, clubs and cafes.\n\nThe night life is buzzing in Timisoara and there are options from which to choose for anyone: couples or singles of any age.\n\nIf you fancy tasting something delicious, you can find a variety of restaurants with traditional Romanian food as well as dishes from the international cuisine.\n\nTimisoara is the birthplace of many fascinating personalities that influenced the course of history in Romania and abroad.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nJohnny Weissmuller (1904-1984), best known actor that played the role of Tarzan in Hollywood\n\nStefan Kovacs (1920-1995) football coach for Ajax Amsterdam (Olanda football club) between 1971 and 1973.\n\nFrancesco Illy (1892-1956) inventor of the first automatic coffee machine and founder of Illycaffè\n\nNikolaus Lenau (Franz Nikolaus Niembsch Edler von Strehlenau) – (1802-1850) Austrian poet, one of the German and universal poetry classics, born near Timisoara in Csatad (Schadat) village, now Lenauheim.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?\n\nIf you found this article useful please take a moment to tweet, like, or share this article by using the buttons at the top or bottom.
