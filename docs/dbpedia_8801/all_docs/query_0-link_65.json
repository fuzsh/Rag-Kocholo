        "text": "Timișoara has been recorded since 1173, but it has no medieval monuments. The town has been planned twice. In 1716, when the Austrians entered the country and liberated the town from under the Turkish tenure of 164 years old, they demolished the whole town, they brought engineers who projected and built a new town, the present old town. At the beginning of the 20th century the engineers restarted the work and made the plan of the modern Timișoara, which was respected in the first decades of Socialism as well.\n\nThe fortress survived 9 assaults, it has never been conquered in battles because it has been built on the marshland, and the two flows, Bega and Timiș, which at the present has its course at a distance of 10km, formed a real system of defense. The name of the town in Hungarian reflects this state, Temesvar, that is the fortress situated on Temes; that is Timiș. The only persons who could approach the fortress were those who knew all the passes. The marshland also provoked a lot of trouble to the town`s concillors. The majority of the constructions from the 18-19th centuries were built on wooden pillars, which were quite resistant until the phreatic bed was up but the problems appeared with the development of the town. The phreatic level dropped and the pillars started to putrefy. The draining of the marsh was initiated by the Austrians in the 18th century, the same time when the Bega channel, navigable a long time, was dug. The Timiș and the Bega were connected through canals and weirs, thus the water surplus could be bailed out, and in draught period it could be pumped in or from the Timiș. Thus, Bega was, for a long time, until the Tito era, navigable, when the dams were closed and lattices mounted on the rivers.\n\nIn the 18th century industrialization emerged in the most beautiful and cleanest town of Europe as well. The first factory, that is the beer factory was followed by that of the silk and cigarette, but let`s take a look at the things the town is proud of, in chronological order:\n\n1718 - the certification of the oldest beer factory from Romania\n\n1718 - the inauguration of the first elementary school from the fortress, the first in Romania\n\n1728 - the beginning of the Bega's sewerage, the first navigable channel from Romania\n\n1745 - the first communal hospital from Romania (24 years before Vienna and 34 before Budapest)\n\n- the first town of the monarchy with the streets lighted up by lamps\n\n1819 - for the first time in Central Europe the anti-smallpox vaccination is administered\n\n1823 - In Timișoara, Bolyai Janos announces the discovery of the first uneuclidian geometry in the World\n\n1847 - in the beer factory's yard takes place the first concert of Johann Strauss Jr. outside Vienna\n\n1855 - the first town of the Habsburg monarchy with the streets lighted up with gas\n\n1884 - the first town on the European continent with the streets lighted up electrically, with 731 Lamps\n\n1886 - the first ambulance station from Hungary and Romania\n\n1895 - the first blacktopped street in Romania\n\n1899 - the first electric tram in Romania\n\nand as an evidence of the multiethnic character of the town\n\n1953 - the only European town having three state theaters, in Romanian, Hungarian and German\n\nThe dates of the town's town hall\n\nSights\n\nThe Romano-Catholic Dome Metropolitan Cathedral The Serb Cathedral The Serb Orthodox Church from Mehala The Serb Orthodox Church, Fabric St. Ilie Orthodox Church Orthodox Church of Elisabetin The Elisabetin Romano-Catholic Church The Sfântul Iosif Romano-Catholic Church Sfântul Rocus Romano-Catholic Church Înălțarea Sfintei Cruci Piarist Church Millenium Church The church of the nuns belonging to the Notre-Dame order The Romano-Catholic Church from the Mehala Saint Ecaterina Church Iosefin Romano-Catholic Church Greek Catholic Church in Fabric Church of the Order of Mercy, Greek Catholic Church Synagogue Citadel Synagogue Fabric Synagogue Iosefini Reformed Church The Evangelical Lutheran Church Franciscan Monastery The Serb Orthodox Episcopal Palace The Roman Catholic bishop Dicasterial palace Lloyd palace Baroc palace Dauerbach palace Dejan palace Hilt-Vogel palace Löffler palace Marbl palace Neuhausz palace Széchenyi palace Weiss Palace Water Palace Palace of Culture, Theater and Opera House with Atlanti Emmer house Brück house House of Prince Eugene of Savoy House to the axis of iron Mercy house The Turkish House Skanzen Museum of Banat The Art museum Carmen Sylva High School Lenau High School Loga High School School Piarist Sfânta Treime or the Plague Statue Statue of St. Mary Statue of St. John Nepomuk Monument to Virgin Mary Iron Bridge Decebal Bridge Mihai Vitezul Bridge Botanic park Roses park Fountain with Fish Union Square fountain Iosefini Water Tower Fabric Water Tower City hall The old City house The Huniazilor Castle Maria Theresia Bastion Discount Bank The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Academic library, Ormos house Neptune public lavatory The Military Casino Guilds Tree Cigarette factory The Brewery Slaughterhouse The hydroelectric power station\n\nAcknowledgements to Szekernyés János for the informations contributed."
