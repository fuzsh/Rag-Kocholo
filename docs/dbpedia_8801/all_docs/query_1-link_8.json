        "text": "Timișoara is the capital city of Timiş County, the 3rd largest city in Romania and the main social, economic and cultural centre in western Romania.\n\nNicknamed the Little Vienna or the City of Flowers, Timişoara is considered the informal capital city of the historical Banat. The country’s third most populous city is the economic hub of the region, with 319,279 inhabitants as of the 2011 census, home to almost a half-million inhabitants in the metropolitan area, as well as ca. 50,000 students from over 50 countries.\n\nHistory\n\nTimişoara municipality, documentarily attested of over 730 years, the capital of Timis County, located in Câmpia Timişului (Timis Plain); Timis Plain is crossed by Bega and Timiş Rivers, whose presence has influenced over the time the evolution of the town from the Citadel fortified with walls, bastions, fosses and vallums. Known as Citadel (ever since 1212) - Castrum Temesiense - located at the crossroad of the military and trade roads, becoming a main target of the dispute between the Turks and the Austrians and later on, coveted by the Hungarian bourgeoisie and aristocracy - Timişoara developed as a town around the fortified nucleus starting from the 18th century. In the period 1315-1323, King Charles Robert of Anjou establishes his royal residence at Timişoara citadel.\n\nIn 1781, Timişoara was granted privileges and was declared a free town, the credential document containing the acknowledgement of the coat of arms and of the seal. The coat of arms is divided by a horizontal line into two parts, the upper one being divided in its turn, by a vertical line. The upper left half comprises four silvery bands within a bloody plain, symbolizing the four main rivers which cross Hungary. In the right half, on a golden background, it is presented, on a green base, the former water tower of Timişoara citadel, and through its open gate, one can see a mill wheel.\n\nInteresting facts\n\nIt was the first city in the Habsburg Monarchy with street lighting (1760) and first European city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884. It opened the first public lending library with reading room in the Habsburg Empire and built a municipal hospital 24 years before Vienna. Also, it published the first German newspaper in Southeast Europe (Temeswarer Nachrichten). It has been an important centre for music in Europe since the 19th century.\n\nLandmarks\n\nUnion Square\n\nIt is a representative place for Timişoara and surely every tourist who visits the city also reaches the Unirii Square. The oldest market in the city, in Baroque style, houses the Roman Catholic Cathedral or Episcopal Cathedral, the Baroque Palace, the Serbian Orthodox Bishopric, the Serbian Orthodox Episcopal Cathedral, the N. Lenau Theoretical High School, the Monument of the Holy Trinity, mineral water fountain and other buldings from 18th - 19th century. Next to the pharmacy near the Baroque Palace, among the tiles that form the pavement of the market you can see on a stone with the plan of the former Citadel of Timişoara from the 19th century.\n\nThe Baroque Palace (Timişoara Art Museum)\n\nIt dates from the 18th century. Over time it was the official residence of the Timiş County (in the 18th and 9th centuries), the seat of the governor of Banat Timişan and Vojvodina (1849-1860), the headquarters of the Prefecture (20th century), and since 1984 it houses the Art Museum.\n\nThe monument of the Holy Trinity\n\nGreat Synagogue (Synagogue in the Fortress)\n\nIt was built between 1863-1865, in Moorish style, following the architect Ignatz Schumann's project. The plan of the church is in the form of a Greek cross, the dome is hemispherical and the outside has few glazed ceramic decorations. It is currently being renovated.\n\nThe Bastion\n\nBetween 1723 and 1765, the largest Vauban-style fortress in our country was built in Timişoara. It had 9 strongholds and had an important defense role in the 18th - 19th centuries. However, at the beginning of the 20th century the fortress prevented the development of the city and it was decided to demolish it. The part of the fortification that still exists from the former fortress of Timişoara is known under the name of \"Bastion\" or \"Theresia Bastion\".\n\nCity Hall\n\nIn the past, the building hosted the Higher Trade School. It was built in 1924-1925 in a neo-romanian style.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.primariatm.ro/timisoara/index.php?meniuId=15&viewCat=134"
