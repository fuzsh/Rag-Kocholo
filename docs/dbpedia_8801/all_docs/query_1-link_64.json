        "text": "Today there is a Jewish population of about 300 people. Historically the first half of the 16th century is when the first permanent Jewish settlers arrived. The oldest tombstone in the Jewish cemetery dates from 1636 commemorating the \"rabbi and surgeon\" Azriel Asael. The Jewish population numbered 155 in 1716; 220 in 1739; 72 families in 1781; 1,200 persons in 1840; 2,202 in 1858; 4,870 (c. 15% of the total population) in 1890; 6,728 (9.2%) in 1910; and 9,368 (10%) in 1930. In general, the Jews of Timisoara were well-to-do and were able to finance ample communal activities. Two schools were opened in different quarters of the town in the 1840s. Timisoara was an important Zionist center. There were 13,600 Jews in Timisoara in 1947, but their number gradually decreased through emigration to Israel and other countries; 3,000 Jews remained in 1971."
