        "text": "“Romanian gymnast Ana Maria Barbosu has officially received an Olympic bronze medal for the floor exercise after it was stripped from American Jordan Chiles following a scoring controversy that has continued more than a week after the competition in Paris ended.” - The Washington Post\n\n\"Attracted by free trips, haute cuisine, and a shot at millions of rubles in grants, hundreds of young people from Moldova have participated in a Russian outreach program with ties to Russian officials and a fugitive Moldovan oligarch that is aimed at rebranding Russia and 'refriending' a new generation of politicians, journalists, and beauty queens.\" - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\n\n“In 1999, an impressive structure went up on the National Mall: a wooden church in the traditional Romanian architectural style, imported in pieces and rebuilt over three nights for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival’s ‘Gateways to Romania’ exhibition. The church and the exhibition it anchored were the brainchildren of Eliot Sorel MD, now a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral health sciences in the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS).” - GW Today\n\n\"When a 19-year-old girl was mauled to death by a wild bear in Romania last month, the country’s response was swift: double the number of animals culled every year. In Italy, however, the killing of a female bear who injured a French hiker has sparked an agonised public debate on how to handle aggressive specimens within the country’s growing bear population.\" - Financial Times\n\nA friendly (and final) reminder that there are just a little over two weeks left to apply for the Romanian American National Heritage Award, an annual competition aimed at high school students with Romanian heritage or connections, working to contribute to strengthening the Romanian spirit and community cohesion in the United States. Romanians of DC is proud to serve as a community partner for this award which distinguishes exceptional contributions of youth to increasing the community cohesion, the preservation and dissemination of the Romanian culture and traditions in the United States. The application for the 2024 Awards will remained open through August 25, 2024 and winners will be announced on September 15.

After a dyke burst last summer near his village of Mahmudia, swathes of the delta once drained for farmland were submerged again, creating the region's second-largest lake and a paradise for the region's battered biodiversity.\" - Ani Sandu | The Central Virginian\n\n\"Over one thousand participants are expected to take part in this year’s most important business event in the Republic of Moldova, Moldova Business Week 2024. This year’s event will take place from September 16-20 in various regions of the country. The motto of the current edition is, 'Republic of Moldova – Your next destination for investments.'\" - Emerging Europe"
