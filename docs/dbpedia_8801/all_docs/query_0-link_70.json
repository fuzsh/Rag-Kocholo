        "text": "After an impressive four months period, the largest exhibition dedicated to the works of Constantin Brancusi in the last 50 years in Romania welcomed its last visitors on Sunday, marking an exceptional moment in the cultural landscape of Timișoara.\n\nThe exhibition hosted by the National Art Museum of Timișoara managed to gather over 130,000 visitors. It proved to be one of the most significant cultural events of the Timisoara 2023 - European Capital of Culture programme, attracting without a doubt a large number of tourists from Romania and from abroad. This success reconfirms Timisoara's position as a visual arts capital and cultural destination. Moreover, it contributes to local economic development and to the promotion of a positive image, thus strengthening the city's status in the international cultural and tourist landscape.\n\nThe students took the unique opportunity to discover Constantin Brancusi's world in person. Over 26,000 students visited the exhibition in more than 900 school trips, coming from Timișoara, from 26 cities in the country, 18 communes and villages in the region, but also from abroad (Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary).\n\nAt the closing of the exhibition, the Governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isărescu, presented the silver coin dedicated to Constantin Brâncuși, in a limited edition of 5,000 pieces. The coin depicts the portrait of the great artist on the obverse and the building of the National Art Museum in Timișoara on the reverse. It can be purchased at the BNR branches in Bucharest, Timișoara, Iași, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova and Constanța, at a price of 547.40 RON, starting from Tuesday 30 January 2024.\n\nThis year, 28 projects will be implemented in Timisoara schools within the \"Power Station+ | Creative Schools\" programme, funded by the Ministry of Culture, through the Timisoara Center for Projects. The total value of the 28 projects, which were rated by the evaluation and selection committee with the necessary score to be declared admitted, is 2,000,000 lei.\n\nThe projects fall under the thematic strands \"Creative Partnerships\" (17 projects), \"Creative Spaces\" (6 projects) and \"Creative Resources\" (5 projects), aiming to contribute significantly to the overall objectives of the Power Station+ | Creative Schools Programme. They aim to enhance cultural activities for young audiences, stimulate interest in the local cultural scene among young people, strengthen interactions between the school community and cultural professionals, develop partnerships between cultural and educational actors, and improve teachers' skills in integrating cultural resources into the educational process.\n\nThe cultural programme continues this year and Timisoara remains the centre of cultural events. February is dedicated to the visual arts, and until 10 February, the Faculty of Mechanics - UPT is hosting the exhibition: one one zero zero one zero zero, which reflects the history of the campus of the Polytechnic University of Timișoara and can be visited from Monday to Friday.\n\nThe exhibition The Twist can also be seen until February 11 at Kunsthalle Bega.

Dimitrie Leonida'' in Bucharest.\n\nOne year with the 1306 nursery, the exhibition that presents the nursery's journey during its ten months of existence, from the concept to the evolution of the plants and the relationship between people and the town, can be admired until 17 February at the Flower Shop in Victoriei Square.\n\nOne of the most beautiful exhibitions, Rituals, Keepers and Storms, by Ioana Nemes, is open to the public until 9 March at ISHO House.\n\nThe National Museum of Art Timisoara will host the exhibition Parallels.
