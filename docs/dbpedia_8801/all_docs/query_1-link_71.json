        "text": "Transylvania is a country located in Eastern Europe. It borders with Romania to the East, with Ukraine to the North, with Hungary to the West and with Serbia to the South. With a total area of 102,834 square kilometres, Transylvania is the 17th largest country in Europe and the 10th most populous member state of the European Union, having approximately 11 million inhabitants, 3 million more than Romania. Its capital and largest city is Cluj. Other major urban areas include: Timișoara, Brașov, Oradea, Arad and Sibiu.\n\nModern Transylvania was formed in 1962 after secession from the Socialist Republic of Romania. The General Serban Georgescu took the lead of the Liberation Army of Transylvania, mostly composed of the ex-Romanian army stationed in the region in addition of a few volunteers.\n\nTransylvania ranks 21st in the Human Development Index, right under Austria. It has been a member of the United Nations and NATO since 1963, and part of the European Union since 2004. A vast majority of the population identifies as Eastern Orthodox Christian and are native speakers of Romanian, a Romance language.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFor the History of Transylvania before 1962, please visit this page.\n\nIndependence from Romania - 1962[]\n\nOn December 12th, 1962, the romanian general Serban Georgescu initiates a coup with the support of the romanian army stationed in Transylvania and a few rebels. The whole region is cut from Romania and on December 13th, Georgescu declares the independence of Transylvania through Cluj's TV broadcasting center.\n\nThe coup has been planned much time ahead with the help of the CIA, backing this anti-communist revolt. They saw the opportunity to have an allied state beyond the Iron Curtain, weakening the USSR's position in the area.\n\nOn December 15th, Bucharest sends its tanks and its planes to the newly proclamed state to regain control. Due to the very dense forest coverage and the hilly landscapes, the effect of the planes was almost negligible. The newly-formed border between Transylvania and Romania crossed the Carpathian mountains, creating a natural shield for Transylvania. The self-proclaimed Liberation Army of Transylvania managed easily to contain the advancement of romanian tanks in the few roads large enough.\n\nThe height of the conflict is illustrated on December 16th, in the border village of Lazaret in the Sibiu district. Most of Romania's forces crossed the border at that moutaineous point, only to face strong resistance including tanks, rebels and a large use of explosives. The Romanian army's main offensive is defeated, Bucharest gives up and Transylvania becomes officially independent on December 19th, 1962.\n\nNATO alignement and opening of the country - 1963[]\n\nAs Transylvania is being massively recognised by the West Bloc at the end of 1962, the country is offered to join NATO. The country doesn't have a strong army and is landlocked within the Warsaw Pact and Yugoslavia, which makes the NATO shield a necessary protection for sustainability. NATO saw a strong strategic advantage of having an outpost within the influence zone of the USSR.\n\nThe access to Transylvania's allies being blocked by its neighbours, and uncertain by Yugoslavia, the country had to develop its local industry and agriculture. This led to a massive investment plan by the Transition Government to ensure the stability of the country. This investment plan was extended later in June 1963 after the US offer to Transylvania for development funds under a Marshall plan extension. Both civilian and military industries receive massive investment from the state to ensure the well-functionning of the country. The country is being rapidly privatised and the transition from a planned economy to a free market economy is rapidly done.\n\nIn July 1963, the Transition Government led by Serban Georgescu announces the first free elections of the country, to be held in November 1963 in order to let the first elected government take the lead in January 1964. In August 1963, the Constitution of the Transylvanian Republic, highly influenced by the French Constitution, is being proposed to the citizens, which voted in a referendum at 95% in favour, with only 10% of abstentionism.\n\n1964 - 1973, the Growth Years[]\n\nThe following 10 years showed relative stability, a big growth in the country's GDP and a development mainly of local industries to counter the effect of the embargo from the Warsaw Pact. A NATO division remains stationed in the country to help ensure the protection of the borders.\n\n01 January 1974 - 07 January 1974, Failed coup[]\n\nOn January 1st 1974, as the new government was supposed to enter in power, a paramilitary group enters the government building in the capital city at 10:00. All resistance is killed, the rest are being kept as hostages. At the exact same time, 3 other paramilitary groups take control of the Avram Iancu international airport, the main broadcast station in Cluj and the main electricity production centre of the city. Explosives detonate in various points across the country, targets being:\n\nThe main military base in Cluj, causing important losses and partial destruction of the military equipment.\n\nOn the Freedom Place (Piața libertăţii; previously known as Union Place - Piaţa Unirii), blowing up the stage where the new president, Andrei Puiu, should've been giving a speech. He delayed his appearance by a few minutes to adjust his speech, escaping the bombing. However, his campaign aide, thought to become his prime-minister, Horasiu Petrescu, was present on stage and didn't survive, along with 10 other people.\n\nThe Town hall of Timișoara, resulting mainly in civilian deaths.\n\nOther terrorist groups, mainly armed volunteers, take control of various town halls across the country.\n\nThe previous government officials, which escaped the bombings at the Freedom Place as well, as well as the new elected president and his team were evacuated to the city of Turda, a neighbouring city of Cluj. The loyal part of the army, the previous and the new government started working from the military base of Turda to manage the crisis. NATO allies were immediately warned.\n\nAt 13:00, the paramilitary group that took control of the broadcast station announce their intent to take over the Transylvanian government to \"liberate it from the imperialistic chains of the USA\", and to unite again with Romania under the communist regime. The Romanian and the USSR governments deny any implications in the coup, but encourages the \"Transylvanian citizens to follow the liberation\". It was later proved that both Moscow and Bucharest had been smuggling funds, weapons and explosives in Transylvania.\n\nThe response from the armed forces of Transylvania is swift, and regain control of strategic points and cities fallen under the control of rebels. The NATO brigade engages the armed rebels in the city of Cluj-Napoca, without much success.\n\nYugoslavia, refusing to let the USA send aircrafts to provide support to Transylvania, decided to let the NATO allies cross its skies on January 5th. This follows a major show of force from the USA navy in the Adriatic sea, and the official declaration of Richard Nixon announcing that blocking NATO from helping its ally is similar to an act of war.\n\nThe next day involves various breaches in the buildings controlled by the coup makers, and on January 7th at 04:00, the NATO brigade enters succesfully the government building and arrests any surviving rebels, with limited civilian casualties. The last buildings held by the rebels were all taken back by 16:00.\n\nThe new government's investiture is delayed by a month to allow a smooth recovery of the country, and the arrested rebels are put to trial and condemned for treason of democracy with a maximum of imprisonment for life, and a minimum of 30 years.\n\n1989 - The fall of the neighbouring communist states[]\n\nWhen the communist government falls in the border countries of Transylvania, a dialogue is immediately opened. The centrist and liberal government sees there an incredible opportunity for collaboration, economy, and sees the opportunity to join the European institutions.\n\nPresident Iliescu of Romania and President Costin of Transylvania meet on March 12, 1990 to discuss the eventual reunification. Iliescu insists that it should be done as soon as possible, at the image of the German reunification, but Costin and his government have reservations, especially about the difference of wealth between the two countries. Many debates occur in the Transylvanian parliament, without any clear consensus appearing. A referendum is put in place concerning the reunification on June 1990. The main argument in favour was refering to the common destiny of Romania (including Moldavia, still under USSR control then). The main argument against was the difference in wealth, and the empoverishement of Transylvania in order to put the entire country on the same wealth level. Another argument against was the serious problem of corruption in Romania, that is somewhat low in Transylvania. The referendum resulted in a NO at 71%, and YES at 29%, with an abstention of 8%. President Costin declared that the unification was hence not on the agenda of the government, but that it is certainly not forgotten and the country will wait the development of Romania to see the evolution.\n\nDiscussions between Budapest and Cluj also happened, and the two countries agreed very quickly in looser controls at the border, and many Transylvanian firms had the opportunity to invest in Hungary, just like in Romania.\n\nWorried by the instability in Yugoslavia, Cluj offered some logistical support to Belgrade, but had to cancel due to protests inside the NATO commandment. It is later, in 2004, that NATO used Transylvania's airports to perform tactical bombings on Serbia. This damaged severely the relationship between Serbia and Transylvania, and the various presidents that succeeded in Serbia regularly remembered Transylvania that Bucarest is their legitimate capital. Romania indeed continued to show support to Serbia in the name of their friendship during the Yugoslav wars.\n\n2004 - today[]\n\nThe president Ionuţ Vasiliu (UPG, centre-left) was elected in 1999 on the program of entering the European Union during the planned expansion waves. The citizens of Transylvania having a positive image of the institution, the party wins the presidency again in 2004 with the previous Prime Minister, Anatolie Nicolae.\n\nIn 2007, Transylvania joins both the Schengen Area and the Eurozone.\n\nIn 2008, the financial crisis hits the USA and Transylvania is one of the first European countries to be hit, due to its very close ties to the United States.\n\nOn September 2, 2012, the president Călin Babeș (TF, far-right) is shot 7 times with an automatic rifle during an official visit in Bucarest. Two Romanian special forces agents have been killed while tying to protect the Transylvanian president, as well as 3 civilians. The suspect, a 35 year-old man named Bogdan Mihai and romanian nationalist extremist, has been instantly killed. This act has been caracterised as a terrorist attack, as the letter of Bogdan Mihai left mentioned acting for political reasons. His motives were that the Babeș government refused to acknowledge the fact that \"Transylvanian territory shall belong to Romania\". The romanian president, Traian Băsescu, condemned the attack and insisted that \"the union may happen only with appeased relations\". However, the tension between Cluj and Bucarest rose nonetheless.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, a series of articles by investigation newspapers uncover serious corruption practices, and illegal financing in most political parties, especially in the DPP (centre-right), the RCM (conservatives), and the TF (far-right). The DPP government, led by Nicolas Enescu had to change its prime minister twice due to the corruption accusations (Ion Zaituc then Felix Cernea), to finally lose its coalition with RT (centre) and become then a minority government in cohabitation (UPG, centre-left, prime minister imposed by the parliament, Theodor Voicu).\n\nIn 2019 is elected Emilia Giurgiu at the Presidency, being both the first woman elected as president in Transylvania, and the first EcoT (greens) president. Her prime minister, Soós Vince, is the first prime minister coming from the Hungarian minority.\n\nSection heading[]\n\nWrite the second section of your page here."
