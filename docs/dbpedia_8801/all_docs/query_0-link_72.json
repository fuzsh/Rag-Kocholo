        "text": "County: Suceava\n\nCapital: Suceava\n\nThe county is named for its capital. The origin of Suceava is unknown. One theory posits Hungarian *Szucsvár (literally \"Furrier Castle\") from noun szucs (furrier, skinner) + noun vár (castle), but there is no etymological evidence to support this; one older Hungarian name Szocsvásár looks close, but ending -vásár means \"bazaar, fair, market\". In fact, the source of Suceava* seems more likely Slavic; compare Polish Suczawa and Ukrainian Suchava.** This would align with the theory that the city took its name from the Suceava River, putatively Ukrainian in origin. The Suc-/Such-/Sucz-/Szocs-/Szucs- element is reflected in the names (archaic) German Sotschen and Yiddish Shots.\n\n* Romanian letter c is pronounced ch before e or i.\n\n** And indeed, the city's Modern Hungarian name Szucsáva, which looks to have been borrowed from Slavic as well (either directly or through the Romanian).\n\nCounty: Teleorman\n\nCapital: Alexandria\n\nCounty name Teleorman is a Romanian evolution of the Cuman/Turkish expression deli orman (\"mad forest\"): adjective deli (insane, mad) + noun orman (forest); the sense is of \"a dark, thick and sinister forest\".*\n\nThe capital Alexandria was named for Prince Alexandru II Ghica who founded the city in 1834.\n\n* Compare the Ludogorie region in Bulgaria: Bulgarian adjective ludo (singular neuter form of lud \"crazy, mad\") + noun gorie (\"forested area\"), collective noun formed from noun gor(a)- (forest) + collective neuter noun-forming suffix -ie. It is also sometimes still known by its original Turkish name: Deliorman.\n\nCounty: Timis*\n\nCapital: Timisoara*\n\nThe county is named for the Timis River. The origin is unknown, but the river was known as Ancient Greek Thibisis/Tibisis and Latin Tibiscus, Tibisci in antiquity; it has been posited that the thib- was a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) element associated with water. The principal etymological theory is that Tibisis first evolved into an early Romanian form *Timisis and then to Timis. However, compare names Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS) Tamis and Hungarian Temes. These might have evolved from the Romanian or it might have been the other way around (and there might not be any relationship to the Latin and Greek names at all).** Another chicken-and-egg etymological puzzle.\n\nPlace name Timisoara is the Romanian rendering of Hungarian Temesvár (\"Timis Castle\"): name Temes- (Timis) + noun -vár (castle,fortress).\n\n* Diacritics:\n\n** That Tamis does appear redolent of BCS noun tama (darkness), which - through Proto-Slavic to PIE - might suggest a link to the etymology of a river as far away as the Thames in England.\n\nHighly speculative of course!\n\nCounty: Tulcea\n\nCapital: Tulcea\n\nThe county is named for its capital Tulcea. The origin is unknown; the city first appears in Ottoman records at the beginning of the 16th Century as Turkish Tulça.* Tulcea is its Romanian form; compare also Bulgarian/Ukrainian Tulcha and Hungarian Tulcsa. The Turkish -ça suffix (if that is what it is) is used to form demonyms but the Tul- element is a mystery. One theory is that the origin is Tatar;** compare Tulchyn in Ukraine.\n\n* The city is very old, founded in the Seventh Century BC as Ancient Greek Aigissos (Latin Aegyssus, Aegyssi).\n\nRegarding Tulça, this is the Modern Turkish spelling. Ottoman Turkish would have recorded the name in Arabic script; a 19th-Century English rendering was Toultcha.\n\n** Wikipedia - Tatars of Romania\n\nCounty: Vaslui\n\nCapital: Vaslui\n\nThe county is named from its capital, Vaslui. The origin is unknown. One theory (more of a traditional claim really) is that the city was founded* by the Byzantines and named for Emperor Basil II. As the Greek name Basileios is rendered in the Slavic languages as Vasil- in some variation or another, there is some merit to this. Another theory posits a Turkic origin; element -ui is apparently a component ofCuman hydronyms.\n\n* Or rather re-founded since the site has been settled since the Neolithic.\n\nCounty: Vâlcea\n\nCapital: Râmnicu Vâlcea\n\nCounty name Vâlcea (\"Little Valley\") is Romanian noun vâlcea, a diminutive from Late Latin noun vallecula/vallicula, valleculae/valliculae (same meaning), itself formed from noun vallis, vallis* (vale, valley) + diminutive suffix -cula. An alternate etymological theory posits a Slavic source meaning \"wolf\"; compare Bulgarian noun valk (wolf).\n\nPlace name Râmnicu Vâlcea** (literally \"Vâlcea Fishpond\"), from Romanian noun râmnic (pond or lake arranged on a river for raising fish), itself from Slavic (probably Bulgarian) noun rybnik (same meaning): noun ryb(a)- (fish) + noun-forming suffix -nik (here indicating a derivative function noun).\n\n* Source of Romanian noun vale (valley).\n\n** There are a number of places named Râmnicu in Romania. The addition of a second name helps to further identify the locality in question; compare Râmnicu Sarat as well as the two towns Râmnicu de Jos and Râmnicu de Sus (literally \"Lower Fishpond\" and \"Upper Fishpond\" respectively).\n\nCounty: Vrancea\n\nCapital: Focsani*\n\nThe origin of Vrancea is unknown. One theory traces the name to the Slavic word for \"raven\"; compare Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian vran (crow, raven) and Old Church Slavonic vranu (raven). Another posits aThraco-Dacian source for \"forest, mountain\" in the element v(r)an-; compare Sanskrit vana (forest, tree, wood). Not really very convincing. A third theory links Vrancea to (now obsolete) Romanian noun frânc (a term once used to refer to anyone from western Europe i.e., a Frank**). That f to v change is highly problematic though. Neither Romanian nor Hungarian (frank) nor the Slavic languages (Bulgarian frank) nor Turkish (Frenk) exhibit any such historical phonetic shift in consonants.\n\nPlacename Focsani is considered to be derived from family name Focs(a)-*** + adjective-forming suffix -ani (masculine plural form of suffix -an \"of or pertaining to\").\n\n* Diacritics:\n\n** Based on the premise of the (Saxon) Germans who moved into the region in the Middle Ages.\n\n*** Focsa appears as a family name both with and without the diacritic mark under the s. It also appears in some other Romanian localities e.g., Focseasca and Focsanei.\n\nAnd so ends our etymological tour of Romanian county names.\n\nI don't know about you, but this has been a fascinating journey for me. Given the history of the region that is now Romania, it should be no surprise that these 41 counties and their capitals have names that reflect Latin, Greek, Slavic, Turkish (also Turkic!) and Hungarian roots. In some cases, their origins are a complete mystery. In others, they are not what you might expect. I'm sure many would have assumed prima facie that the names were largely of Latin origin when, in reality, Slavic and Hungarian sources appear much more prevalent.\n\nNavigating through various etymological claims could be tricky. There has been a tremendous amount of Romanian nationalism manifested about place names, based on a need to assert the country's putative Romano-Dacian origins. Sometimes that has rendered theories that verge on the fanciful. In this respect though, Romanians are no different from ourselves: the impulse to build a national saga and summon up heroic origins is a very human one.\n\nAnyway, I have in mind another European country for my next etymological look at place names. After a break of a day or two, I'll launch into it.\n\nStay tuned!"
