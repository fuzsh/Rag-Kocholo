Timișoara, city, capital of Timiș județ (county), western Romania. The city lies along the canalized Bega River.

Nearby archaeological finds indicate settlements of Neolithic and Roman origins. First documented in 1212 as the Roman castrum (fort) Temesiensis, Timişoara in the 14th century became a fortress in the middle of marshland. The town was sacked by the Tatars in the 13th century, but its citadel was rebuilt and for a few years was the residence of Charles I of Hungary (1309–42). From 1552 the town was held by the Turks until the Austrians took it in 1716. After the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, the city and the region, known as the Banat of Temesvár, were governed from Vienna and colonized with non-Magyars, mostly Swabian Germans. The city withstood a siege by Hungarian revolutionaries, lasting 107 days, in 1848. Occupied by Serbia in 1919, it was allotted by the Treaty of Trianon (1920) to Romania.

Antigovernment demonstrations that erupted in Timișoara on December 15–17, 1989, sparked the revolution that toppled the Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu from power a few days later. It was Ceaușescu’s use of deadly force to suppress the demonstrations in Timișoara that spurred the army to defect to the side of the uprising.

The city is a cultural centre. There are several higher-educational institutions, including the University of Timișoara (founded 1948). Timișoara has a state theatre, a state opera and ballet, a philharmonic orchestra, and a library. There are parks along the navigable Bega Canal, which runs through the centre of the city. Principal buildings include the monumental Roman Catholic cathedral (1736–73), the Serbian cathedral (1748, restored 1791), and the regional museum, housed in a restored 14th-century palace.
