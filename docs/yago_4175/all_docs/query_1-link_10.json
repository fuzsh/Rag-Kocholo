        "text": "The use of torture is completely prohibited by international law. However, many countries still employ torture methods. Read our guide below to learn about the situations in countries many of our clients are coming from.\n\nWhat is the UN Convention Against Torture?\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the world’s countries have ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, since it was first adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984.\n\nRatification is an act by which a state agrees to be legally bound by a convention. By ratifying, a state accepts that torture is always absolutely prohibited and never justified. The prohibition of torture is an absolute and peremptory norm (jus cogens) of international law. As such, the prohibition can be enforced even against a state that has not ratified any of the relevant treaties.\n\nDespite this, the use of torture is still widespread and many governments, as well as insurgent groups that control territory (such as Boko Haram in Nigeria), continue to use torture to oppress and persecute people to this day.\n\nThere are various reasons people may be targeted. Chief amongst them are political activity, belonging to an ethnic or religious minority, or being LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer). Often political activity is low level, such as handing out leaflets or wearing a t-shirt, or being accused of associating with an opposition group.\n\nPhysical and psychological torture techniques include beatings, electrocution and sexual torture including rape, as well as sleep deprivation, threat to family members, and mock executions.\n\nWhere is torture happening?\n\nAt Freedom from Torture, we support people who seek refuge in the UK having fled torture all over the world. Our research shows that torture is still rife in many countries.\n\nOur specialist doctors use medico-legal reports to provide independent evidence of torture to people seeking asylum in the UK. Using data from those reports, we can see worrying trends of torture in certain countries across the world.\n\nTorture in Iran\n\nIn Iran, torture and other human rights abuses are used by the government to sow fear among the population, suppress political activity, force confessions and act as punishment.\n\nWe have evidence that since the Cultural Revolution of 1980, torture has been used by the state to control a broad range of political, religious and social activity. Reports of torture have continued to emerge following the crackdown on the popular uprising linked to the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022.\n\nRead more about torture in Iran.\n\nTorture in Eritrea\n\nFor decades, President Isaias Afewerki has ruled Eritrea with an iron fist. There are no legislature, media outlets, non-governmental organisations or even a judiciary.\n\nThere is a harsh system of conscription that sees every Eritrean serve for an indefinite period often lasting around 10 years. Whilst in service, Eritreans are subjected to treatment that has been characterised as enslavement, and attempts to avoid national service have led to imprisonment and torture.\n\nAfewerki’s regime has also conspired to crush any political opposition and a number of religions including through arbitrary imprisonment and torture.\n\nTorture in Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nHuman rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are rife.\n\nWe have evidence that women and men exercising their rights to participate in political or human rights activism have frequently been detained and tortured by the state to silence any political opposition. Our 2018 report, ‘A tool to silence: torture to crush dissent in the Democratic Republic of Congo’ studies the experiences of 74 Congolese men and women and reveals that torture, including rape, is rife within the detention system.\n\nSince then, elections have been held in the Congolese state, and a new President, Félix Tshisekedi, has taken office following the 18- year rule of former President Joseph Kabila.\n\nRead more about torture in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nTorture in Sudan\n\nIn 2019, Sudan’s President of 29 years, Omar al-Bahir, was ousted and arrested. Though the former President remains detained in Sudan, he is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In 2021 a short-lived transitional government was overthrown after a military coup. Protests against the coup the following year were met with a deadly crackdown as government forces killed, forcibly disappeared and tortured protestors.\n\nSudan remains deeply unstable and, in 2023, civilians have borne the brunt of a devastating armed conflict that has erupted between rival factions in the military government.\n\nWe have evidence of human rights violations committed under the government of Omar al-Bashir. In particular, we have evidence of torture committed from 2003 after the Darfuri war under the premise of non-Arab ethnic cleansing.\n\nTorture in Turkey\n\nOur evidence shows that torture has been happening in Turkey for decades, mainly to repress the Kurdish minority and the political involvement of its people.\n\nBased on 60 medico-legal reports we produced between February 2012 and March 2017, our 2017 country briefing highlighted the systematic use of torture between 1992 and 2015.\n\nTurkey’s record on human rights has further worsened since the failed coup of 2016. Regular reports have emerged in recent years of Turkish border guards killing and torturing Syrians attempting to cross over into Turkey.\n\nRead more about torture in Turkey."
