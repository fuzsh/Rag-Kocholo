        "text": "I have been considering this for a while and goodness knows I didn’t invent the idea of flashback awards but last year’s Academy Awards really made me think seriously about it. And so, one year later, here we are! I am nominating 1919 films for a fictional 1920 awards show, the Movies Silently Awards or the Fritzis because my ego knows no bounds.\n\nBefore we dig into the nominees, several points:\n\nThis will not be a direct copycat of the Oscars. I will be eliminating categories and adding them as I see fit.\n\nThe selection process will be a hybrid. I plan to consider historical resources like the original Photoplay Medal of Honor nominees AND bring in a modern perspective. I originally planned to hold a contest based on the Photoplay noms but decided that I wanted to give 1919 a little bit of love first. It was such a smashing year.\n\nAll awards show nominations are arbitrary and there is no such thing as objectivity. I make no claims of fairness.\n\nThis is just for fun. If you absolutely hate all my nominees, you are free to set up your own awards on your blog.\n\nObviously, I must restrict the list to what survives and what is available for viewing. This limits the scope quite a bit but I think it’s the only fair thing to do in this situation.\n\nI am also limiting myself to features because there is no way in hell I am opening the Chaplin vs. Keaton can of worms.\n\nI think that’s everything on the “trying not to get yelled at on the internet” list so let’s do this thing!\n\nBest Feature-Length Picture\n\nBack to God’s Country\n\nBlind Husbands\n\nDaddy Long Legs\n\nThe Daughter of Dawn\n\nThe Dragon Painter\n\nJ’Accuse\n\nMadame DuBarry\n\nMale and Female\n\nSouth\n\nWhen the Clouds Roll By\n\nBest Director\n\nCecil B. DeMille (Male and Female)\n\nGermaine Dulac (La Cigarette)\n\nAbel Gance (J’Accuse)\n\nMarshall Neilan (Daddy Long Legs)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Blind Husbands)\n\nBest Actress\n\nPola Negri (Madame DuBarry)\n\nOssi Oswalda (The Doll)\n\nMary Pickford (Daddy Long Legs)\n\nGloria Swanson (Male and Female)\n\nNell Shipman (Back to God’s Country)\n\nBest Actor\n\nHobart Bosworth (Behind the Door)\n\nSessue Hayakawa (The Dragon Painter)\n\nRomuald Joubé (J’Accuse)\n\nThomas Meighan (Male and Female)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Blind Husbands)\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nTsuru Aoki (The Dragon Painter)\n\nKathleen Clifford (When the Clouds Roll By)\n\nBebe Daniels (Male and Female)\n\nColleen Moore (The Busher)\n\nJane Novak (Behind the Door)\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nWallace Beery (Behind the Door)\n\nLon Chaney (The Wicked Darling)\n\nEmil Jannings (Madame DuBarry)\n\nGerhard Ritterband (The Doll)\n\nRudolph Valentino (Eyes of Youth)\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nAbel Gance (J’Accuse)\n\nAgnes Christine Johnston (Daddy Long Legs)\n\nJeanie Macpherson (Male and Female)\n\nNell Shipman (Back to God’s Country)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Blind Husbands)\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nDal Clawson and Joseph Walker (Back to God’s Country)\n\nHenry Cronjager (Daddy Long Legs)\n\nFrank Hurley (South)\n\nJulius Jaenzon (The Outlaw and His Wife)\n\nAlvin Wyckoff (Male and Female)\n\nBest Costumes\n\nThe Doll\n\nThe Daughter of Dawn\n\nThe Dragon Painter\n\nMadame DuBarry\n\nMale and Female\n\nBest Editing\n\nDaddy Long Legs\n\nThe Doll\n\nThe Eyes of Youth\n\nJ’Accuse\n\nWhen the Clouds Roll By\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nBehind the Door\n\nDaddy Long Legs\n\nJ’Accuse\n\nMadame DuBarry\n\nWhen the Clouds Roll By\n\nBest Title Cards\n\nBack to God’s Country\n\nBehind the Door\n\nBlind Husbands\n\nThe Busher\n\nMale and Female\n\nBest Foreign Language Feature Film\n\nOne film to a country or else this would be an all-German list! And trust me, I did not take my German selection lightly.\n\nEl automóvil gris (Mexico)\n\nLa Cigarette (France)\n\nThe Doll (Germany)\n\nThe Outlaw and His Wife (Sweden)\n\nTowards the Light (Denmark)\n\nPhew! I hope you enjoyed these nominees and that you maybe have some new material for your to-watch lists!\n\n“Did you… did you just snub Broken Blossoms?”\n\nYes, yes, I did. Next!\n\nUpdate: I am not publishing any more comments complaining about my decision regarding Broken Blossoms. As stated above, feel free to hold your own award show. I wrote a Twitter thread detailing why the film turns my stomach, if you’re interested.\n\n“When will we learn about the winners?”\n\nOscar night! February 9, 2020!\n\n☙❦❧\n\nLike what you’re reading? Please consider sponsoring me on Patreon.
