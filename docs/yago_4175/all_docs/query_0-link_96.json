        "text": "After watching every horror film of the 1960s that I could find, I’ve now started on my way into the 1970s. I’m fairly optimistic that the horror films of the '70s will be an improvement over the '60s overall. If not better, then at least more intriguing. I’m hoping to find a wider variety of films as filmmakers gain more creative freedom over the years, and I believe I should have more material to write about.\n\nBecause I love the '70s so much, I'm going to start a series where I go through every '70s horror film I'm watching, month by month.\n\nWe're starting at the very beginning of the decade, naturally, in January of 1970. While we may see anywhere from 5 to 10 horror flicks in most months, maybe even more, January only saw a paltry three films, and two of them were on a double bill. However, judging by how long this article is, you can imagine how dense most of the following installments will be.\n\nWe begin with the very first horror film released in the 1970s. It's The Dunwich Horror, executive produced by Roger Corman and released by American-International Pictures on January 14th in the United States.\n\nAfter Corman and AIP exhausted a wealth of material from the works of Edgar Allan Poe in the '60s, it figures that the next logical step would be adapting H.P. Lovecraft. It stars Dean Stockwell as a sorcerer named Whateley who manipulates Sandra Dee into participating in a ritual to resurrect the \"Old Gods\". I'm no expert on Lovecraft (I don't do much reading), but according to this film, the Old Gods are these tentacle monsters hiding in Stockwell's attic that kill people with a seizure-inducing colored light show.\n\nAfter a pretty cool opening title sequence set to a catchy theme by Les Baxter that plays all throughout, the film turns out to be your standard fare about witchcraft and the angry townspeople trying to stop it. We've seen so many of these in the last decade, and thanks to the success of Rosemary's Baby, the demon train ain't slowin' down anytime soon.\n\nMy favorite actor in the film is Ed Begley, Sr. as a professor trying to investigate the Whateley family history, who teams up with an elderly doctor to solve the mystery. This doctor is played by 45-year-old Lloyd Bochner, but you totally wouldn't be able to tell by looking at his powdered hair, especially when he says lines like…\n\n\"You all know me! I delivered most of you!\"\n\nIn a Corman production, you’ll usually find a young up-and-comer before they were famous, and here we have an early appearance by Talia Coppola, before her marriage to composer David Shire.\n\nThis film is also one of the favorites of the stoner metal band Electric Wizard, as they’ve used a sample of dialogue in their song We Hate You, and named another one of their tracks Dunwich. If you’re an old coot that hates noise, don’t listen to Electric Wizard.\n\n“You see man as a rather dismal creature.”\n\n“Yes. Why not? Look around. You’ll see what’s there… Fear, and frightened people who kill what they can’t understand.”\n\nJumping ahead to January 23rd, we find a double bill of heavy-hitters written and directed by a true auteur of the horror genre: Andy Milligan. Excuse me if I haven’t made my sarcasm clear enough.\n\nMilligan was a filmmaker based in New York who specialized in making shoddy Z-grade trash like Seeds and The Ghastly Ones. In other words, he made some of the worst films ever made, fast and cheap.\n\nHe was one of the figures responsible for upping the ante of blood and gore on the screen, none of it the least bit convincing. You can see this in his film Bloodthirsty Butchers.\n\nFor this film, Milligan traveled to jolly ol' London to bring the story of Sweeney Todd to the silver screen. Why bother with Tim Burton and Stephen Sondheim, when Milligan already brought us the definitive version, with the finest troupe of actors, fresh out of the local East End community theater.\n\nHonestly, the acting isn't quite as bad as in most of Milligan's American productions. Perhaps the accents do a lot to mask things, or these Brits are just more professional than Andy's regular NY troupe.\n\nHowever, you cannot escape from the usual Milligan trappings, like the bottom-of-the-barrel camerawork, sound recording, and gore effects. They had a fake severed hand that looked like it was purchased from the Halloween shop, and used it multiple times.\n\nYou can experience more of the Milligan magic in the second part of the double bill, Torture Dungeon, which he made back on his home turf, with more of his regular troupe of actors.\n\nIt’s a story set in Medieval times, where the actors are dressed in garb left over from the last Renaissance fair, hanging out inside an abandoned greenhouse.\n\nWith Milligan, you can expect a lot of romance, and with that comes a lot of sex. Sex that looks like it was filmed by a chimpanzee and scored with whatever stock classical music they had in their library. Andy was quite progressive, too, showing us scenes of both lesbian and gay male coitus, including a gay romance with a hunchback.\n\n“I’m not a homosexual. I’m not a heterosexual. I’m not asexual. I’m trisexual. Yes, that’s it. I’ll try anything for pleasure.”\n\nOutside of all that, and an arranged marriage with a mental retard, I struggle to remember much of what happened here. It's simply amateur hour stuff, and there will be plenty more of Milligan's brand of filmmaking to go around, as we head further into the 1970s."
