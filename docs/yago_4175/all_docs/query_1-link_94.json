        "text": "The inmates of Van Diemen's Land's notorious Separate Prison, at Port Arthur, endured a silent, lonely psychological torture.\n\nWhen it opened in 1848 the British Empire was moving away from corporal punishment, instead forcing convicts to quietly reflect on their past deeds in isolation.\n\nThe approach was dreamed up by reformists who believed physical punishment was hardening convicts, and making them more likely to re-offend.\n\n\"It was a prison discipline that operated under the principles of isolation, silence and control,\" said University of Tasmania phD candidate Honey Dower.\n\n\"There's significant evidence that suggests there is a connection between solitary confinement and decreased mental health.\"\n\nMs Dower tracing the lives of the convicts through historical documents, including obituaries and conduct records of those who spent time in the Separate Prison.\n\nThe separate treatment\n\nThe Separate Prison was opened in 1848 and operated until the site's closure in 1877.\n\nIt has been restored and is visited by thousands of tourists every year.\n\nThe prison housed convicts who had further offended while living elsewhere in the colony, usually through violence or serious theft.\n\n\"Instead of being out and about in the colony of Hobart or Richmond they were sent to the prison which would resemble a modern prison today,\" Ms Dower said.\n\nThe prisoners had to study and attend chapel, and when outside their cell they had to wear a hood to hide their face.\n\n\"They weren't allowed to communicate with anyone,\" she said.\n\nThey were no longer called by their name, only a number.\n\nIt was a silent place — mats were laid in the corridor so even footsteps went unheard.\n\nFrom the Motherland\n\nThe prison was based on the Pentonville Prison in London, the first Separate Prison in the British Empire.\n\n\"That was open and operating from 1844,\" Ms Dower said.\n\n\"The first 1000 prisoners, the majority of them ended up in Van Diemen's Land with a number returning to solitary confinement at Port Arthur.\n\n\"Part of this wave of reform was moving away from corporal punishment to more of a psychological slant.\n\nMs Dower said reformists believed physical punishment made convicts more inclined to do further criminal activity.\n\n\"The objective here was to reform them, and that was through religious reformation, hence the amount of time they had to attend divine service and confess their sins to chaplains,\" she said.\n\nDriven mad in 'proper' solitary\n\nThe Separate Prison cells had a window, but if convicts caused further trouble they could be sent to 'proper' solitary confinement — a cell without light or sound.\n\n\"You'd stay there for a minimum of a week and upwards of a month,\" Ms Dower said.\n\n\"Several prisoners ended up in pauper institutions, they weren't able to find work and had lingering health affects.\n\n\"There's strong anecdotal evidence that as a result of confinement in the Separate Prison they were sent to mental asylums, the most prominent being the New Norfolk institution.\"\n\nOne convict Ms Dower has studied, Leonard Hand, was sent to the Separate Prison when he was 18 and his mental state severely deteriorated.\n\nMs Dower believes the convict may have had a disability, and he was eventually released for medical reasons.\n\nThe prison closed in 1877, but Ms Dower said its principles remain in prisons across the world."
