        "text": "[Torture] dehumanizes people by treating them as pawns to be manipulated through their pain.\n\nKenneth Roth, Getting Away with Torture, Global Governance, 2005\n\nHistory offers no modern examples of the strategic effectiveness of harsh interrogation techniques, but it is replete with examples of the negative strategic effects such techniques have on the counterinsurgency force.\n\nLou Dimarco, Losing the Moral Compass: Torture and Guerre Revolutionnaire in the Algerian War, Parameters, 2006\n\nThe use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it\n\nLord Hoffmann, British judge\n\nWhen the state itself beats and extorts, it can no longer be said to rest on foundations of morality and justice, but rather on force.\n\nMordecai Kremnitzer quoted in Marcy Strauss, Torture, New York Law School Law Review, 2004\n\nWhile the rest of the world is expected to abide by the UN Convention against Torture, for example, the Americans evaluate international law on the basis of whether it serves their interests.\n\nExcesses of Sex and Violence, Der Spiegel, May 2004\n\nThe interrogations, torture and socialization of prison turned most of the men rounded up by Mubarak into hardened militants, thirsty for revenge: they would become the foot soldiers of terrorism\n\nGilles Kepel, The War for Muslim Minds, 2004\n\nNot only will torture create a dedicated core of anti-American jihadists, their stories will lose us the \"hearts and minds\" campaign with the larger Muslim population.\n\nJeannie L. Johnson, Exploiting Weakness in the Far Enemy Ideology, Strategic Insights, 2005"
