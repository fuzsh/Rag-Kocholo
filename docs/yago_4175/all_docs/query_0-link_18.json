        "text": "Paris has been all over news a lot lately, thanks to a major event that was scheduled to take place there this very month. Might I add: taking place finally, after years of news, hype, and endless preparation. I’m talking, of course…about the new Napoleon (1927) restoration, which finally premiered in the City of Light earlier this month.\n\nWait, what did you think I meant?!\n\nThis restoration has been eagerly anticipated, to put it mildly, and I even had several friends and acquaintances fly to Paris just to experience the July 4th-5th premiere of this seven-hour film. (Insert your own low-hanging fruit joke about cinephile Yanks, Independence Day, and spending Independence Day in France here. *wink*) I’ll admit it, the thought of jetsetting there myself did cross my mind…!\n\nThis restoration has taken the Cinémathèque Française 16 years to complete, with financial assistance from the Golden Globe Foundation, the Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée, and even Netflix. Back in 2016 I got to attend a presentation by Georges Mourier (who spearheaded the restoration) at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival detailing how his team was sifting through 22 separate versions of the film in their monumental task to piece together a definitive, true-to-Gance print. Or something approximating definitive, at any rate.\n\nHere I’ll add that there’s been some controversy over the fact that the great historian Kevin Brownlow, who is almost as legendary for his obsession with Napoleon as he is for his devotion to silent film in general, was not brought onboard this project–not even as an advisor. The Cannes festival did briefly acknowledge his previous work when the new Napoleon opened their 77th festival back in May (the restoration pre-premiere, if you will). Political murkiness creeps its way into everything, I suppose.\n\nSo how did the Paris premiere go? It was held at the La Seine Musicale in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, and featured the Radio France Choir and 250 musicians from the National Orchestra of France and the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra. The score was a brand-new one by Simon Cloquet-Lafollye utilizing dozens of pieces of classical music. To say there was a lot of hype is an understatement. Archivists, film restorers, and researchers from all over the world were in attendance, and even Abel Gance’s daughter, Clarisse. The audience numbered about 3000, from what I’ve heard.\n\nNot having gotten to experience Napoleon in Paris myself, I had to experience it vicariously through others posting on Facebook and other social media. Silent London recently shared an exceedingly thorough breakdown of the premiere written by attendee The Realm of Silence–here’s a vivid excerpt of what the opening night was like:\n\nTickets scanned, we file through. It is half past five. Several lines lead towards covered checkpoints. Bags are inspected, bodies are searched. We proceed to the doors, where our tickets are scanned once more. Inside, there is a buzz of expectation. I overhear conversations in French, English, German. Further down the lobby, I see a giant projection of the trailer for tonight’s premiere. I catch the words “definitive”, “monumental”, “historic”, “complete”. Above the doors to the auditorium, the same video loops on LCD screens.\n\nThe screening is supposed to start at six o’clock, but five minutes beforehand queues still struggle through the three tiers of security outside. Inside, I take a programme booklet and search for my seat. Buying tickets online was not easy. The seating plan was like a nightmarish game of Tetris. With no sense of where each block lay in relation to the screen, in desperation I opted for “gold” tickets. Inside the concert hall, I find with immense relief that my view is superb. Dead centre, two ranks below the projection booth, three ranks above the sound mixing station…\n\nI sit and read the programme. It promises me a kind of accumulative bliss. Sixteen years of work. 1000 boxes of material examined. 300 kilometres of celluloid sorted. A score of 148 cues from 104 works by 48 composers, spanning 200 years of music…This is to be a ciné-concert “on a giant screen”. Giant? I look up. The screen is big, but it’s the wrong format. It is 16:9, like a giant television. The sides are not curtained or masked. How will they produce the triptych? The hall fills up. Last-minute arrivals scurry in. I catch a glimpse of Georges Mourier. He has chosen to sit very close to the screen…By the time the lights go down, it must be at least a quarter past six. But what matter a few minutes’ delay compared to sixteen years of preparation? This is Napoléon.\n\nSince the new Napoleon print is over seven hours long, it was presented in two parts over two consecutive evenings, with intermissions included. This was a showing that required commitment, my friends–for everyone involved.\n\nHere’s a reaction I saw on Facebook: “It was a long way to go to see a film, but for me it was worth every mile. An incredible achievement in film and I soaked up every minute of it. My once in a lifetime chance to experience it in Paris, within view of Napoleon’s Tomb and surrounded by Parisians.”\n\nA Nitrateville user who goes by EKsilent wrote: “The restoration was nice. Not a huge improvement on the Brownlow, but nice. 18 fps seems to give a more natural flow, I liked it. In some cases some noticeable different camera angles and takes…This also add to a more coherent feel and flow. Some extra scenes and snippets are added but nothing earthshaking. You are still fine with the Brownlow version. The Marat murder scene is now placed at the beginning of the Reign of Terror episode which in my opinion works better.”\n\nAnd here’s a reaction to the opening night showing from historian Bruce Calvert:\n\n“The first half of Napoleon was pretty spectacular. The tinted restoration is beautiful. The music score was compiled from many old classics and we even had a choir singing La Marseillaise. The film is a series of montages and nothing happens quickly. To me it is reminiscent of the Soviet silents of the time with many montage sequences. There aren’t many characters besides Napoleon, they are all just types. The film really does provide a feeling of love of French history. (I also don’t understand French very well, so that inhibits my understanding of the story.) It was also a bit warm in the auditorium. I know many of my friends say that seeing this film with a live orchestra was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of their lives. I am very glad to see it under such excellent circumstances, but it is not going to be one of mine.”\n\nEvidently he found Night #2 a more satisfying experience, filmwise:\n\n“The second half of Napoleon was more spectacle. We meet Josephine, the terrors of the Revolution unfold, and Napoleon conquers Italy. The tryptic is reminiscent of Cinerama, except that some times there are three different images at once…I’d love to see this again on video with English translations so the I could understand the titles and story better. It was an unforgettable experience. Certainly one of the best French silent films, a grand experiment that mostly works.”\n\nI didn’t think of this until now, but it makes sense that this Paris theater would only have title cards in French–although I would’ve had a hazier experience, too. (Now, give me Intolerance with French title cards and I’d probably be alright!)\n\nIn general, reactions to the showings on social media were overwhelmingly positive for the quality and clarity of the print and appreciation for the work that was involved. Everyone seems fairly pleased at the addition of the new material (apparently it doesn’t substantially change the trajectory of the film, but just adds to it) and how various pieces were shuffled into place. And, of course, the film itself was a magnificent experience, as it always is.\n\nThe score, however, was a different story–not because of the musicians and singers, who were reportedly fantastic, but because the classical pieces chosen did not always jibe with the action onscreen. This is a problem I’d expect with those old, fuzzy YouTube uploads of various silent films, not a screening as hyped as this one. On Nitrateville, Ann Harding wrote:\n\n“Some choices work well such as Mendelssohn’s Scottish symphony on the snowball fight. Others are a bit strange like Elgar’s Enigma Variation (Nimrod). Quintessential English music over Napoleon reviewing his troops?!? I was also surprised to hear a choir singing Mozart’s Ave Verum Corpus at the end of triptychs when the soldiers are singing the contemporary Le Chant du départ by Méhul (“La victoire, en chantant, nous ouvre la barrière!“). Bizarre…”\n\nEKsilent was also underwhelmed: “The score can’t compare to the Carl Davis score. It is episodic and rhapsodic and not that fit-as-a-glove beauty that Davis achieved. I missed the powerful emotional response that the Davis score brings out.”\n\nRealm of Silence was very frank on this topic: “Considering that Cloquet-Lafollye’s score draws on 200 years of western classical music for its material, and that it has had several years to be assembled, I was disheartened to find so many scenes which lacked a sustained rhythmic, tonal, and cultural synchronicity with the film.”\n\nI’m still feeling a bit wistful about missing out…except for one very important detail of the presentation which, had I witnessed it after travelling all the way to Paris, would’ve devastated me. Realm of Silence described what happened:\n\nI wrote earlier that the screen size (and lack of masking) made me wonder how the triptych would be handled in the Paris concert hall. Since there was no rearrangement of the screen or space for the second evening’s projection, I was even more puzzled. How would they fit the three images on screen?\n\nEventually, I got my answer. When Napoleon reaches the Army of Italy and confronts his generals, something peculiar started happening to the image: it started shrinking. This was not a sudden change of size. Rather, like a form of water torture, the image slowly, slowly, got smaller and smaller on the screen. To those who had never seen Napoléon before, I cannot image what they thought was happening; did they belief that this gradual diminishment was Gance’s intention? As the image continued to shrink, someone in the audience started shouting. I couldn’t make out what he said, but something along the lines of “Projectionist!” Was he shouting because he didn’t know what was happening, or because he knew what should be happening? I would have started shouting myself, but I was struck dumb with disappointment…\n\nWhen the image had shrunk enough (making me feel like I was fifty rows further back in the auditorium), the two additional images of Gance’s triptych joined the first. This was the first time I’ve seen Napoléon projected live when the audience didn’t spontaneously applaud this moment. Why would they applaud here, when the revelation was rendered so anticlimactic?… I’m not sure I’ve ever been so disappointed in my life. Every time I’ve seen the triptych projected as intended, I’ve been almost physically overwhelmed by the power of it. (In Amsterdam in 2014, before a triptych forty metres wide and ten metres high, I thought my heart was about to burst, so violently was it beating.) This time, I was taken utterly out of the film. I could hardly bear being in the concert hall.\n\nI can imagine what the reasoning was: this new print is set to play on French television and Netflix later this year, thus the image shrinking was done to accommodate future television sets. This my brain can understand. But my soul doesn’t understand why such an anticipated screening, the result of almost two decades of work, wouldn’t want to put on a grand triple-screen finale to end all Napoleon triple-screen finales. If I, someone who’s never seen Napoleon on the big screen, had flown all the way to Paris only to miss out on the whole point of seeing Napoleon on the big screen I would’ve been crushed.\n\nNot that it wouldn’t have been excited and enjoyable as a whole…not that it wouldn’t have been a grand experience in general–especially with Gance’s daughter in the audience. No trip to Paris is ever in vain (I can confirm). But while the new print may have be close to definitive, I fear that this 2024 premiere is always going to be remembered as: “Magnificent…but…”\n\nMany thanks to Valerio Greco for sharing his photos of the premiere and to Bruce Calvert for sharing his photos and observations!\n\nI highly recommend that you check out Paul Cuff’s, aka Realm of Silence’s entire post about the premiere. Already extremely familiar with the film, he was able to describe the various changes/improvements/weaknesses of the new print in impressive detail. I’m grateful he took the time to do such a thorough breakdown.\n\n—"
