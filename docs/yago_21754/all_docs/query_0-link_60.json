        "text": "I am glad the truth is finally acknowledged.\n\nAt the time of the Grand Duke's death, the Bolsheviks maintained that 'the people of Ural, angered by exploitation of the working classes, took the justice into their own hands', although no one really believed that tale. Everyone knew that the Grand Duke was killed on Cheka's orders.\n\nIn a documentary which was aired here several years ago, it was alleged that the Grand Duke begged his executioners to at least save the lives of his secretary and valet but they were afraid leaving any witnesses, so the Grand Duke had to witness their death, before he himself was murdered.\n\nThe bodies were 'destroyed', which some take to understand that they were burned. Although they may well be buried somewhere; Ural is a pretty big place and if one wants to hide something, it is not that difficult.\n\nTrue,the Urals is a vast area.Still,I do hope,and very much so,that the SEARCH Foundation of Captain Peter Sarandinaki will look towards Perm now,and start an investigation into the possible whereabouts of the two men.Now the Kremlin has acknowledged they were innocent they might come forward with evidence that \"accidently\" was lost at the time...if you catch my drift.Everything is accidently lost & found there.\n\nI do hope they one day will find Misha and his loyal Johnson .\n\nTrue,the Urals is a vast area.Still,I do hope,and very much so,that the SEARCH Foundation of Captain Peter Sarandinaki will look towards Perm now,and start an investigation into the possible whereabouts of the two men.Now the Kremlin has acknowledged they were innocent they might come forward with evidence that \"accidently\" was lost at the time...if you catch my drift.Everything is accidently lost & found there.\n\nI do hope they one day will find Misha and his loyal Johnson .\n\nI think that if there was evidence as to where Mikhail was buried it would have come out by now, even though he wasn't rehabilitated until now.\n\nI think that if there was evidence as to where Mikhail was buried it would have come out by now, even though he wasn't rehabilitated until now.\n\nGuess you are right,just wishfull thinking from my side,sometimes matters take longer in Russia,and evidence\n\nand what not pop up as easily as it disappears,it is Russia after all....\n\nI'm fairly convinced Misha and Johnston will not be found,I just Wish they would,c'est ca.\n\nBeen to the Hermitage here yesterday,again,and saw Misha's officers coat from the Kozak Regiment.\n\nHere is the blog entry devoted to Grand Duke Mikhail and his wife Natalia Brassova. Although it is in Russian, there are photos of the couple.\n\nÍàòàëüÿ Áðàñîâà è Ìèõàèë Àëåêñàíäðîâè÷ Ðîìàíîâ.
