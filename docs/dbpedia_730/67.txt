Victory Medal 1914-19 (Major G. H. Scott. R.A.F.), good very fine

George Herbert Scott - or Lucky Breeze as he was also known - was born on 25 May 1888. He was a British airship pilot and engineer. After serving in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force during the Great War, Scott commanded the airship R34 on its return Atlantic crossing in 1919, which marked the first transatlantic flight by an airship and the first east–west transatlantic flight by an aircraft of any kind.

Subsequently, he worked at the Royal Airship Works in connection with the Imperial Airship Scheme and took part in a second return Atlantic crossing, this time by the R100, in 1930. He was killed later in the year (along with 47 other people) aboard the R100's near-sister, the R101, when it crashed in northern France during a flight to India.

Sold together with the R101 Memorial Card and copy of the Daily Mail, 6 October 1930, which covered the disaster.

In addition to his achievements as an aviator, Scott made significant contributions to airship engineering, notably in the evolution of the mooring mast.
