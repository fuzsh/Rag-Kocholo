He was educated at George Watson's college from 1930 to 1942. On leaving school he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and was sent to Oklahoma in the United States for pilot training. He rose to the rank of Aircraftman 2nd Class before being commissioned as a Pilot Officer on probation on the 18th of June 1944. He was confirmed in his rank and was promoted to Flying Officer on the 18th of December 1944.\n\nFollowing the losses to glider pilots during the Battle Arnhem, where the Glider Pilot Regiment had lost 90% of the men who took part, the Royal Air Force was called upon to provide 1,500 pilots for glider training for Operation Varsity, the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945. John Haig was one of these. He was attached to G Squadron based at Great Dunmow where the pilots underwent intensive training for the operation during March 1945. On the 6th of March 1945 he was appointed to the command of No. 24 Flight. The camp was sealed off at noon on the 22nd of March and final equipment and supplies for the operation were issued the following day.\n\nOn the 24th of March 1945 he was one of sixty crews who took off from Great Dunmow for the operation, with another twenty taking off from RAF Matching Green. Forty four of the crews from G Squadron were carrying men of the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment as well as men from Anti Tank Batteries of the Royal Artillery and of a Field Ambulance.

He rose to the rank of Flight Sergeant before being commissioned as a Pilot Officer on the 22nd of March 1944.\n\nJohn Hall and his Navigator, Flight Sergeant Henry Herbert \"Harry\" Ashby, took off from RAF Northolt at 10.30am on the 15th of July 1944 in Mosquito PR Mk IX MM249 for a photo reconnaissance mission over France. Having successfully completed their mission the aircraft was returning to base when one of its engines failed. Visibility was poor and they attempted to make a forced landing in Windsor Great Park but both men were killed when the aircraft crashed there.\n\nHe is buried at Brookwood Military Cemetery Plot 22 Row D Grave 1\n\nHalley William Alexander Munro Pilot Officer 63440\n\nNo. 10 Operational Training Unit, Royal Air Force\n\nKilled on active service on the 4th of May 1941 aged 18\n\nWilliam Alexander Munro Halley was born at Edinburgh on the 2nd of January 1923 the eldest son of Alexander Munro Halley, a tea buyer and company director, and Nora Catherine (nee Forbes) Halley of 54, Victoria Street, Aberdeen, later of 15, Hartington Place, Edinburgh.

He went on to George Watson's College from 1935. He was a keen swimmer and golfer. On leaving school he had intended to enter banking but instead he enlisted as an Aircraftman in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in July 1940 and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on probation on the 3rd of April 1941.\n\nWilliam Halley and his crew took off from RAF Abingdon on the 4th of May 1941 in Whitley Mk V N1467 RK-Z for a circuit training flight. The aircraft crashed into a house at Cherwell Farm, 31, Linton Avenue, Oxford, at 4pm killing the entire crew and seriously injuring Mrs Frances Emma (nee Stanbra) Hitchcox, her husband, Joseph Edwin, and her son Kenneth who both suffered burns. Oxford medical student Nick Rawlins attempted to rescue one of the crew but was driven back by the flames and exploding ammunition. The injured were taken to Radcliffe Infirmary where Frances Hitchcox died the next day from a cardiac arrest following severe burns.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nPilot Officer Charles Nairn Small (Pilot)\n\nPilot Officer William Alexander Munro Halley (Observer),\n\nSergeant John Alfred Mochan: (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner)\n\nAt the inquest, Arthur James Hitchcox, one of the sons of the house stated that: - \"The engine suddenly cut out and the plane dived to within 100 feet of the ground. It then flattened out and glided straight into the house, setting fire to it.\"\n\nEyewitness, Derrick Holt was walking with a friend beside the River Cherwell when he saw the aircraft circling. He stated that: -\"As it flew towards us from the direction of New Marston, the engines gave off four puffs of smoke before it dived directly at us. Fortunately, it started to flatten out and flew overhead before hitting the far bank of the Cherwell, sliding up Linton Road and exploding in a ball of black smoke, followed by the crackle of exploding ammunition.\"\n\nOne eyewitness reported that they heard one of the engines misfiring and when the aircraft crashed the noise was said to have been heard all over North Oxford.\n\nThe incident is commemorated on a plaque which was unveiled on the 4th of May 2014 at the Leonard Wolfson College Auditorium which now stands on the crash site.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Aberdeen Grammar School Roll of Honour 1939-1945.\n\nHe is buried at Liberton Cemetery, Edinburgh Section M Grave 244\n\nHalsall, Donald Addie Pilot Officer 62669\n\n254 Squadron, Royal Air Force\n\nKilled in action on the 27th of December 1941 aged 21\n\nDonald Addie Halsall was born at Ormskirk, Lancashire on the 7th of December 1920 the second son of Robert Halsall, a solicitor, and Marie Macnee Addie (nee Pickard) Halsall of 17, Sandringham Road, Ainsdale, Southport in Lancashire.

On leaving school he became a member of Southport Rugby Football Club.\n\nBefore the outbreak of war, he had enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and volunteered for flying duties, although he didn't begin his training until April 1940. He was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on the 9th of March 1941.\n\nDonald Halsall and his crew took off on the 27th of December 1941 in Blenheim Mk 1 Z6184 for an operation to Norway. When over the Norwegian coast the aircraft was seen to be attacked by two Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters and was shot down, with the starboard engine seen to be on fire. It crashed into the sea to the west of Bjornoy at Faafjord, between the islands of Husevaagoy and Grindoy, with the loss of the entire crew.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nPilot Officer Donald Addie Halsall (Observer)\n\nPilot Officer John \"Jack\" Worrall Roche RAAF (Pilot)\n\nSergeant Frederick Henry Silk (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner)\n\nHis father received the following telegram: - \"Deeply regret to inform you that according to information now received from the International Red Cross Committee your son Pilot Officer Donald Addie Halsall is believed to have lost his life as the result of air operations on 27th December 1940. Letter confirming this telegram follows. The Air Council express their profound sympathy.\"\n\nHis body was recovered from the sea on the same day off Vaagso Island. It was taken to a hospital at Maaloy where he was found to have been killed instantly by a bullet. He was buried with full military honours at Maaloy Cemetery, Son-og-Fjordane, Grave 8 on the 30th of December 1941. His body was exhumed in 1946 and reinterred at its present location.\n\nHe is commemorated on the war memorial at King George V School, Southport.\n\nHe is buried at Stavne Cemetery, Trondheim Plot A IV British, Row G Grave 5\n\nHamilton, William Flight Lieutenant 63095\n\n604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron, Royal Air Force\n\nKilled in action on the 16th of May 1943 aged 23\n\nWilliam Hamilton was born at Lasswade, Midlothian on the 3rd of March 1920 the son of Dr William Hamilton MC MB Ch.B and Mary Miller Hamilton of Stanley Lodge, Roslin. He was educated at George Watson’s College from 1928 to 1938 after which he went on to Edinburgh University to read Medicine. He was married to Rosemary Olive.\n\nHe enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1940 and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on the 23rd of March 1941. He was promoted to Flying Officer on the 24th of March 1942 and to Flight Lieutenant on the 23rd of March 1943. He was posted to 604 Squadron flying night fighters.\n\nWilliam Hamilton and his radar operator, Flying Officer John Ross Coates, took off from RAF Scorton on the night of the 16th of May 1943 in Beaufighter Mk If V8554 along with four other aircraft from the Squadron which had been scrambled to intercept an incoming raid of six enemy aircraft which were approaching Sunderland. During the mission, he radioed his base to report that they were engaging an enemy aircraft after which nothing more was heard and the aircraft failed to return. It was assumed that they were shot down by return fire from the enemy aircraft and had crashed into the sea. Flying Officers Keele and Cowles from the Squadron were successful in destroying a Dornier 215 during the same sortie.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial Panel 119\n\nHardie, John Captain EC/6411\n\nC Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)\n\nDied of wounds on the 18th of March 1944 aged 26\n\nJohn Hardie was born at Bo'ness on the 12th of December 1917 the only son of Alexander Hardie and Margaret M. Hardie of 1, Corstorphine Hill Avenue, Edinburgh, later of Barnton, Midlothian. He was educated at George Watson's College from 1929 to 1934. He was connected to the firm of Messrs. Hardie & Co, builders of Bo'ness and Edinburgh and was a member of Barnton Rugby Football Club and was a Scout Master.\n\nIn 1940 he enlisted in the Royal Scots before being posted to Sandhurst Military College for officer training from where he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Indian Army. He was attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles and was later appointed to the command of C Company.\n\nAt 10.30am on the 14th of March 1944, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles arrived on trucks at Imphal Road Training Camp where they received the news that large numbers of Japanese troops were at Jat Gyat. They assembled on the Imphal – Tiddern Road at 10.30pm that night and made contact with enemy troops at 3pm the following day when A and B Companies came under fire and heavy fighting began.\n\nAt 2pm on the 16th of March John Hardie’s C Company caught the enemy moving across their front and killed thirteen of them.\n\nOn the morning of the 17th of March 1944, C and D Companies attempted to advance in the direction of a nearby river. During their move forward they encountered a Japanese bunker complex and were forced to take cover in slit trenches just to the north of B Company’s positions. They remained there, where they improved their positions, until 3pm when they were withdrawn to prepare for an attack that night. At 2.30am on the 18th of March 1944, the main column was to advance while C Company and a Platoon of D Company, assisted by tanks, were detailed to act as a rearguard but also to attack and clear an enemy roadblock ahead of them. Within minutes of the attack on the roadblock John Hardie was severely wounded and was brought back to the Regimental Aid Post at 2.25am where he died of his wounds during the night. The attack on the enemy roadblock was a failure and no further forward progress was made that night.\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission records his death as having taken place on the 17th of March 1944 but the Battalion war diaries record it as having taken place on the 18th of March 1944.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Rangoon memorial Face 63\n\nHart, Colin James Lieutenant 177486\n\n2nd Battalion, Royal Scots (Royal Regiment)\n\nDied on the 18th of October 1942 aged 26\n\nColin James Hart was born at Edinburgh on the 27th of February 1916 the only son of Daniel Hart and Jane Hart of 34, Arden Street, Edinburgh, later of \"Ar Den\", London Road, Stranraer, Wigtownshire. He was educated at George Watson's College from 1921 to 1932. On leaving school he joined the staff of the National Bank of Scotland and worked at their Canonmills and Edinburgh West End Branches. He enlisted in the Territorial Army and was mobilised on the outbreak of war for service in the Royal Scots and was later transferred to the Royal Pay Corps. He attended an Officer Cadet Training Unit before being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Scots on the 15th of March 1941. He was posted to the 2nd Battalion of his regiment based in Hong Kong and arrived there in June 1941. He was wounded during the fighting for the city and returned to his unit after two months in hospital. He was captured on the 25th of December 1941 when Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese. He was promoted to Lieutenant on the 15th of September 1942.\n\nOn the 27th of September 1942, he was one of 1,816 British prisoners of war who were embarked on board the Japanese armed troopship Lisbon Maru for transit to Shanghai and Japan where they were to be used as slave labour in factories, mines and dockyards. In addition to the prisoners were 778 Japanese troops of which 25 acted as guards for the prisoners. Colin Hart was of 373 men of the Royal Scots who were packed into No. 1 Hold at the front of the ship.\n\nAt just after 7am on the morning of the 1st of October 1942, the Lisbon Maru was some six miles off the Sing Pang Islands to the south of Shanghai when she was struck in her engine room by a torpedo fired by the American submarine USS Grouper. The explosion caused the engines to stop and the lights to go out and the vessel's gun began firing. Throughout the day the prisoners were kept in the partially closed holds with no food or water. At 5pm the 778 Japanese troops were offloaded onto a Japanese destroyer, leaving the prisoners, their 25 guards and the crew of 77 still on board the crippled ship. At 9pm, fearing that they could be overwhelmed by the prisoners, the decision was made by the ship’s Captain to seal the holds where the prisoners were being held. Two men had died in Hold No. 1 and Hold No. 3, where the torpedo had exploded. The holds were flooding and continued to do so even when the prisoners manned the pumps. Just after dawn the next day the crew and all but five of the guards left the ship as it was clear that the ship was close to sinking. Lieutenant Colonel Stewart, the senior British officer, ordered Lieutenant Howell of the Royal Scots to attempt to break out of the sealed hatches. Howell and a few men managed to break out from Hold No. 1 but were fired at and two men were killed. Howell reported back that he had seen an island some distance away and Stewart ordered the men to abandon the ship. A number of the prisoners climbed out of the hold, jumped into the sea and began swimming towards the island. The Japanese guards fired at them but were quickly overwhelmed by the prisoners who were by now pouring out of the holds. At about this time the stern of the Lisbon Maru became lodged on a sandbank and stayed afloat for another hour, giving time for the prisoners to evacuate before she sank at 10.45am. Between the swimmers and the island were a number of Japanese auxiliary ships and tugs which refused to allow the prisoners on board and in some cases, fired on them. Lieutenant Howell was picked up by a Chinese sampan and was among the first to reach the island where he persuaded the locals to pick up the men in the water. Around 200 survivors were assisted by the local villagers until the Japanese arrived to pick them up a few days later. They were packed together on the deck of a Japanese gunboat and taken to Shanghai where a roll call was taken on the 5th of October which revealed that 846 men had died in the sinking, although it was later discovered that 35 had escaped with the assistance of the local Chinese.\n\nWith dysentery rife among the survivors, the 35 worst cases were left at Shanghai while the remaining men were embarked on board the cargo ship Shinsei Maru for transit to Kobe and Osaka in Japan. On their journey the ship stopped at Kokura, where 50 very sick men were dropped off, and continued on to Hiroshima where Colin Hart, who was suffering from diphtheria and dysentery, was one of fifty men considered to be too ill to continue the journey and were disembarked there. He died a short time later.\n\nHe is commemorated on the war memorial at the National Bank of Scotland.\n\nHe is buried at Yokohama War Cemetery British Section A Row D Grave 13\n\nHart, William Marwick 2nd Lieutenant 148304\n\nC Troop, 11 (Honourable Artillery Company) Field Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery\n\nDied of wounds on the 23rd of January 1942 aged 22\n\nWilliam Marwick \"Bill\" Hart was born at Edinburgh on the 25th of November 1919 the son of William Binnie Hart, a railway claims inspector, and Maggie (nee Marwick) Hart of 7, Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh. He was educated at George Watson's College from 1924 to 1938. He was a keen horseman. On leaving school he joined the firm of Messrs. Steel Brothers & Co Ltd, Burma traders of London, and was training in their London office prior to being posted to their Burma office.\n\nHe enlisted in the Honourable Artillery Company in May 1939 and was mobilised for service on the outbreak of war. He attended an Officer Cadet Training Unit before being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on the 7th of September 1940 and was posted to his old regiment. He embarked for overseas service with his Regiment on board HMT Samaria on the 25th of September 1941. They landed at Port Tewfik on the southern portion of the Suez Canal in Egypt on the 5th of December 1941.\n\nTowards sunset on the 23rd of January 1942, the 11th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery was heading north through Libya where they were falling back following Operation Crusader, where they had been involved in heavy fighting over the previous few days. Captain Dunn of A Battery was looking to the rear through his binoculars when he saw enemy tanks in pursuit. He alerted the commanding officer and brought his guns up alongside a South African troop of 25 pounder field guns on a ridge near Saunu to engage the 36 enemy tanks which were advancing towards them with the sun behind them. One of the guns fired prematurely, giving away the battery's position and bringing down a hail of machine gun fire on the HAC positions. Following the earlier fighting C Battery had one remaining gun which fired half a dozen rounds before it was put out of action by machine gun fire. Lieutenant Peter Mills climbed into the gun layer’s seat to see what he could do to make it fire but was soon badly wounded. Bill Hart ran across to the commanding officer to seek orders and was sent across to the South African troop. He had almost reached them when he too was badly wounded and he died from his wounds later that night\n\nHe is commemorated on the Alamein Memorial Column 13\n\nHastie, John Everest Ordinary Seaman D/JX 272241 RN\n\nHMS Prince of Wales, Royal Navy\n\nKilled in action on the 10th of December 1941 aged 21\n\nJohn Everest \"Ian\" Hastie was born at Ayton in Berwickshire on the 6th of August 1920 the son of Alexander Hastie and Jane Hastie of Chirnside in Berwickshire, later of Penang. He was educated at George Watson's College from 1926 to 1929 and from 1935 to 1939 and was appointed as a School Prefect. He was School Swimming Champion and the winner of the discus event at the annual games. On leaving school he joined the staff of the Caledonian Insurance Company in Edinburgh.\n\nOn the outbreak of war he enlisted in the Royal Navy and trained at HMS Drake at Devonport before being posted to the battleship HMS Prince of Wales (H53).\n\nHMS Prince of Wales arrived at Singapore on the 2nd of December 1941 in response to rising tensions in the Far East with a probable attack from the Japanese expected. She was still in port when Japanese aircraft attacked Singapore on the 8th of December and her anti-aircraft guns engaged them but without success. With reports of Japanese troop transports in the area she set sail during the afternoon, with the battlecruiser HMS Repulse and the destroyers HMS Electra, HMS Express, HMS Tenedos and HMAS Vampire, collectively known as Force Z, under the command of Admiral Sir Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips. In response to intelligence reports, Force Z headed for Kota Bharu to engage the Japanese transports thought to be landing there but was spotted by the Japanese submarine I-65 on the afternoon of the 9th of December and by enemy spotter aircraft during the evening. At 2.11am on the morning of the 10th of December 1941, they were spotted by another submarine and at 8am they arrived off Kuantan where the landings were discovered to have been a diversion. At 11.13am the first formation of eight Japanese Type 96 bombers attacked the ship, with one bomb passing through the hangar roof and exploding on the main deck below. At 11.30am a second attack followed comp\n\nrising of seventeen Type 96 bombers armed with torpedoes. This formation split, with one group heading for the battlecruiser HMS Repulse but she was not hit during the attack. HMS Prince of Wales was hit by one of the torpedoes which struck her on the port side, to the rear of Y Turret wrecking her propeller shaft, destroying bulkheads, causing flooding and disabling the electrical supply to the rear of the ship. She began to take on a heavy list. A third attack was made solely against HMS Repulse but a fourth was made against both ships by Type 1 aircraft carrying torpedoes which scored a hit on HMS Repulse and she sank at 12.33pm. Meanwhile, six aircraft from this wave broke off and attacked HMS Prince of Wales, which only had two of her anti-aircraft guns still operating and scored three hits, causing further flooding. A short time later she was hit by a 500kg bomb which penetrated the main deck and hit a makeshift aid centre causing widespread casualties. Several more bombs scored near misses which caused further damage and at 1.15pm the order was give to abandon ship. HMS Prince of Wales sank five minutes after the order was given with the loss of 327 of her officers and men, including Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach. The destroyers arrived and rescued around 1,000 men from both ships but 840 men had been lost.\n\nHe is commemorated on the war memorial at Chirnside.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Plymouth Naval Memorial Panel 49, Column 2\n\nHawkins, James Addison Flight Lieutenant 120119 (Pilot)\n\n1521 Flight, Royal Air Force\n\nDied of wounds on the 14th of April 1944 aged 22\n\nJames Addison Hawkins was born in London on the 13th of November 1921 the son of Reginald Thomas Hawkins and Margaret Thomson (nee Addison) Hawkins of 32, Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh. He was educated at George Watson's College from 1926 to 1929 and from 1935 to 1939, where he was a School Prefect, Swimming Champion, and winner of the discus event at the annual Games.\n\nAfter a year at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve where he rose to the rank of Leading Aircraftman before being commissioned as a Pilot Officer on the 27th of February 1942. He was promoted to Flying Officer on the 1st of October 1942 and to Flight Lieutenant on the 27th of February 1944. He was later posted as a flying instructor at an operational training school.\n\nAt 3.35pm on the 14th of April 1944, James Hawkins and Flying Officer Bryan Hedley Dennis took off from RAF Wymeswold in Master Mk 1 LB415 for a beam approach training exercise. Weather conditions were good with eight miles of visibility. At 4.30pm, the aircraft was flying at 1,000 feet over the village of Screveton when it was in collision with Lancaster Mk 1 W4103 of No. 5 Lancaster Finishing School. The two aircraft crashed a short distance apart in a field just to the south of RAF Syerston killing Bryan Dennis and the entire Lancaster crew, which included Old Watsonian David Winchester McRuer. The force of the collision threw James Hawkins clear of the wreckage and he descended by parachute, but was severely injured. He was taken to the Royal Air Force Hospital Quarrington at Sleaford where he succumbed to his injuries later the same day.\n\nA report into the crash, compiled by Wing Commander W.C. Gardiner of No. 5 Lancaster Finishing School, dated the 16th of April 1944 noted that: - \"Aircraft using Newton's beam have always been a source of some anxiety and pilots have been warned to keep away from beam approach aircraft. It was not known that aircraft other than Newton's used the beam for practice and would be flown by pilots unfamiliar with local conditions.\"\n\nA memorial to the two crews was unveiled at St Winifred's Church, Screveton in 2004 and a memorial stone and plaque was consecrated at the crash site on the 13th of November 2005.\n\nHe is buried at Burton-on-the-Wolds Burial Ground Row F Grave 10\n\nHeggie, David Alexander Sergeant 1053585 (Pilot)\n\nNo. 54 Operational Training Unit, Royal Air Force\n\nKilled on active service on the 29th of May 1941 aged 26\n\nDavid Alexander Heggie was born at Edinburgh on the 7th of December 1915 the eldest son of Maurice Heggie, a company director, and Ada Mary (nee Aitchison) Heggie of 13, Napier Road, Edinburgh. He was educated at Cranley School and at George Watson's College where he played as a forward in the 1st Rugby XV and later for old Watsonians. On leaving school he went to work for Heggie and Aitchison Ltd, joiners and cabinet makers of 62, Duff Street, Edinburgh, but left their employ in July 1940 to enlist in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He trained as a pilot and rose to the rank of Sergeant before being posted to No. 54 Operational Training Unit based at RAF Church Fenton to complete his pilot training.\n\nOn the 29th of May 1941 David Heggie took off in Defiant Mk 1 N1556 for a solo night training flight. At the time, he had 24.50 hours of solo flying time on Defiants, of which 8 were at night, and 106.55 hours of total solo flying time on all aircraft types of which 11.50 were at night. While he was airborne an air raid siren sounded across the airfield at 1.25am, due to enemy activity in the area. As a result, all the airfield lighting was extinguished. David Heggie received instructions from air traffic control to orbit the Church Fenton flashing beacon at 5,000 feet and to turn off his navigation lights. He acknowledged the message but instead of flying to the correct beacon he flew towards the second emergency beacon, some four and half miles away, and began circling it at 2,500 feet. This was the same beacon and height as Blenheim Mk 1 L8337 had been given and the two aircraft collided, \"disintegrated\" and crashed near Rakes Wood killing David Heggie and the Blenheim pilot, Sergeant Kenneth Campbell Gemmell. A portion of the Blenheims skin was found amongst the wreckage of the Defiant.\n\nAn inquiry into the collision concluded that: - \"The accident was undoubtedly caused through either disobedience of, neglect or inability to carry out the orders given to the pilot of the Defiant by the controllers over R/T. These orders were acknowledged a full 5 minutes before the accident. There is a possibility that the Defiant was flying en route for his beacon and inadvertently passed over the other beacon but this is inexcusable as he knew the position of both beacons and the visibility was good and both men were visible from the air.\"\n\nHis funeral took place on the 31st of May 1941.\n\nHe is buried at St John the Baptist Churchyard Extension, Kirkby Wharfe Row D Grave 3\n\nHoneyman, Percy Ewen Clunes Lieutenant Colonel 5214\n\nRoyal Scots (Royal Regiment)\n\nDied on the 17th of February 1945 aged 50\n\nPercy Ewen Clunes Honeyman was born at Inverness on the 11th of November 1894 the youngest son of Thomas Honeyman, Factor to the Lochiel Estate, and Jane Stuart Honeyman of Lochiel, Achnacarry.

One of the convoy, the SS Royal Scot, under the command of Watsonian John Bruce Watson OBE, triggered an acoustic mine, blew up and sank. HMS Pintail rushed to the scene to pick up survivors and also triggered an acoustic mine; she sank almost immediately.\n\nAn eyewitness on another ship wrote: - \"A beautiful new ship called H.M.S. Pintail came out to join us, I think from Harwich. We plodded along over a mirror-like sea, the sun glittered and flashed from the water as she glided past us. We were so envious of her power and grace. Suddenly she speeded up, and carving white wings of water, she cut across our bows. There was a huge explosion and she heeled onto her side, still cutting through water, with a white wave curling over her decks, ripping off depth-charges, and men like cotton reels and dolls, like a dying animal, and then nothing! Everything vanished! There ahead of us was the mirror-like sunlit sea, but nothing else. We were stunned. Then suddenly the scene changed, becoming macabre. Bodies came to the surface. Not exactly complete men, but parts missing, and entrails floating after some bodies. It was pitiful. It still flashes into my mind and it hurts. Time does not heal.\"\n\nLieutenant Commander D.J.L Percy RN, commanding officer of the destroyer HMS Quantock who was in the area at the time, described the scene - \"It was the most dreadful sight that I have ever seen. It did not seem possible that there could be any survivors.\"\n\nSix officers and forty eight men were lost with twenty two of the crew being rescued from the water.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Chatham Memorial 44,3.\n\nHunter, Ian Ronald Grey Flying Officer 178294\n\nNo. 302 Ferry Training Unit, Royal Air Force\n\nKilled in action on the 6th of March 1945 aged 21\n\nIan Ronald Grey Hunter was born in Midlothian on the 3rd of June 1923 the son of William Hunter, a consulting engineer and Elizabeth M.

Eight crews had been briefed for the raid but the last four which had been due to take off were recalled due to bad weather. When the remaining four aircraft arrived over the target they encountered 10/10ths cloud and the result of their bombing was not seen. The aircraft crashed between Comacchio and San Giuseppe with the loss of all but one of the crew. Due to the lack of anti-aircraft activity in the target area that night it is thought that the loss of the aircraft was caused by bad weather.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nWarrant Officer Roy Dennis Toynton (Pilot)\n\nWarrant Officer Thomas Fulton Hunter (Air Gunner)\n\nFlight Sergeant George M. Seddon (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner) (POW Stalag VIIA)\n\nPilot Officer Stanley Birch (Navigator)\n\nThe bodies of two of the crew were found in the wreckage of the aircraft but the other two had managed to bail out.

A short time later they saw an oncoming electrical storm which they passed through during which the aircraft was tossed around between 13,000 and 2,000 feet. At dawn, they were still over the ocean and were short of fuel but managed to make landfall where they landed on a small lake. Before long they realised that they were in neutral Portuguese East Africa, about seventy miles to the south of Loureno Marques and were in danger of being interned. A short time later, Captain J.

Flight Lieutenant Jagger continued to the target however, and successfully completed his attack. Whilst over the city, the defective engine became useless, but Flight Lieutenant Jagger flew the bomber safely to base. This officer has always displayed the greatest determination to reach and bomb his objective and his example has inspired all.\"\n\nJohn Jagger and his crew took off from RAF Graveley at 8.10pm on the 21st of January 1944 in Halifax Mk III HX324 TL-B for a raid on Magdeburg. The aircraft was carrying three 1,000lbs general purpose bombs as was as target indicators. At 10.15pm, when the aircraft was in the area of Hanover, it was attacked and shot down by Ju88 C-6R4+L flown by Hauptmann Eduard Jakob of 3./NJG2. Three of the crew managed to escape from the aircraft before it exploded in mid-air at very low altitude, spreading the wreckage over an area of 500 metres in diameter. The wreckage came down half a kilometre to the west of Rehbeck, near Luchow and Dannenberg. Eduard Jakob’s aircraft crashed at Deelen the following morning injuring him and another member of the crew. This was his third and final victory before he was killed in action on the 8th of February 1945.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nSquadron Leader John Johnstone Jagger DFC (Pilot)\n\nFlight Sergeant William Percival (Flight Engineer)\n\nPilot Officer John Ralph Humberstone (Navigator) (POW No. 3366, Stalag Luft III)\n\nFlight Lieutenant Thomas Patrick McGarry (Air Bomber) (Injured) (POW No. 108661 Stalag Luft I)\n\nWarrant Officer Donald Smedley (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner) (POW No. 871, Stalag 357)\n\nFlight Sergeant Nelson John Rapere (Air Gunner)\n\nFlight Sergeant Eric Hie (Air Gunner)\n\nAfter the war the Royal Air Force Missing Research and Enquiry Service found an eyewitness to the crash and recorded the following in their report: - \"A four engine aircraft was observed approaching Rehbeck from the Southeast at approximately 22:00 on 21st January 1944. It was flying at a very low altitude and when about ½km west of Rehbeck at a height of approximately 100 metres it exploded in the air. The bombs had been jettisoned prior to the explosion. Cannon fire was heard and it is assumed that the aircraft was shot down by a night fighter. The aircraft burned for approximately ½ hour. Debris from the wreckage was scattered over an area of about 500m in diameter. On the following day the Luftwaffe took the remains of the wreckage to Salzwedel.

On the 15th of September the regiment's tanks crossed the Rover Marano. David James's No. 1 Troop from B Squadron was across the river by 6.30am and began forming a bridgehead, although their objectives were not consolidated until midday. On the morning of the 17th of September 1944, B Squadron was detailed to support the attack of the 2nd Battalion, King's Regiment on an enemy position known as Point 137. In advance of this, the three tanks making up No. 1 Troop, under the command of Lieutenant B.E.S. King set out along the road at 4.30am to neutralise an enemy position known as Point 126. They were covered during this move by tanks of No. 2 Troop. With the assistance of troops from the 2nd King's they cleared three enemy machine gun positions, with Lieutenant King being wounded during the exchange of fire. Ignoring his wounds, Lieutenant King then led his tanks towards Point 137 at first light where they came under fire from a German Mark IV tank which hit two of No. 1 Troop's tanks, knocking both out. While one crew managed to escape from their tank without injury the other tank crew suffered badly with its commander, Sergeant J. Maxwell, and Lance Corporal Gifford being wounded and David James killed. The other two members of the crew, Troopers Mitchell and Johnson, escaped injury.

He resigned his commission on the 31st of May 1937 on his appointment as an Acting Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force from the same date. He was confirmed in his rank on the 5th of April 1938.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of war, he was promoted to Flying Officer on the 5th of October 1939 and took part in many raids over Germany and the occupied territories, including actions over Dunkirk and the Lofoten Islands.\n\nHe was serving with 59 Squadron based at RAF Detling when, without warning, the airfield came under attack from German Ju 87 Stukas at around 4pm on the 13th of August 1940. When the attack was over some sixty seven personnel, mostly ground crew, had been killed with another ninety four injured. Ian Jameson was among the injured and was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital at Rochester where he was treated for shock and was released two days later.\n\nHis brother received the following telegram dated the 17th of August 1940: - \"Regret to inform you that information received states that your brother Pilot Officer Ian Sutherland Jameson has been injured as the result of enemy action on 13th August 1940. Nature of injuries not known at present. Further information will be sent to you as soon as possible. Letter follows.\"\n\nHe was promoted to Flight Lieutenant on the 5th of October 1940 and served for nine months in Iceland before returning to the UK in 1941.\n\nOn the 4th of May 1942, Ian Jameson and his crew took off from RAF Carew Cheriton at 9.20am in Blenheim Mk IV R2779 QY-U with one other aircraft from the Squadron to provide an escort to a DC2 aircraft over the Bristol Channel. At the time he had a total of 699 hours of solo flying experience of which 199 were on Blenheim aircraft.\n\nThe two Blenheims rendezvoused with the DC2 at 9.40am and at 9.43am the pilot of the other Blenheim, Pilot Officer G. Gregory, who was flying in line astern, noticed that the port engine of Ian Jameson’s aircraft had cut out. Following the engine failure Ian Jameson had turned the aircraft to starboard and had set course for base. Pilot Officer Gregory followed the aircraft in a northerly direction for about three minutes, during which time Ian Jameson’s aircraft was flying at 150 mph and was maintaining its height. Having concluded that the aircraft was \"fully under control\", he continued to escort the DC2 alone before leaving it to return to base at 10.35am.\n\nThe sea in the area was covered by thick fog from 50 feet up to 600 feet and it is thought that Ian Jameson had tried to land the aircraft on the sea but had crashed at about 10.30am with the loss of the entire crew.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nSquadron Leader Ian Sutherland Jameson (Pilot)\n\nSergeant Robert Arthur French Raymond (Wireless Operator/ Observer)\n\nFlight Lieutenant Arthur Walter Barnes (Air Gunner)\n\nFive aircraft from the Squadron were dispatched to look for the missing aircraft and its crew. Four hours later Ian Jameson and Robert Raymond were found alive in the water by a rescue boat some 7 miles to the northwest of Lundy Island. They were pulled from the sea and artificial respiration was carried out on both men, but to no avail and both died from exposure. There was no trace of Arthur Barnes or of the aircrafts dinghy. Their bodies were brought back to Clovelly Harbour from where they were taken to the mortuary at RAF Chivenor.\n\nAn investigation into the failure of the engine found that there had been problems with it in the past and that it had been stripped down, fitted with new parts and satisfactorily tested on the ground.\n\nHis funeral took place on the 8th of May 1942.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Roll of Honour for AVIVA PLC.\n\nHe is buried at St Augustine’s Churchyard, Heanton Punchardon Row N Grave 12\n\nJohnston, Robert Douglas Surgeon Lieutenant Commander (D)"
