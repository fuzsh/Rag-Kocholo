        "text": "Alcock and Brown set off from St. Johns in Newfoundland, Canada, crash landing in a bog in Clifden, Connemara, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later. They faced difficult conditions, surviving continuous cloud, snow and ice and a near-fatal stall in their open-cockpit aircraft, as well as a thick fog that meant they had to blind-fly almost the entire way.\n\nBut it was worth it. On their return to London, Secretary of State for Air, Winston Churchill, presented them with a prize of £10,000, offered by the the Daily Mail, for completing the first crossing in less than 72 consecutive hours.\n\nA few weeks after Alcock and Brown flew across the Atlantic in 1919, the first transatlantic flight by rigid airship was completed. Major George Herbert Scott of the Royal Air Force flew the airship R34 with his crew and passengers from RAF East Fortune, Scotland to Mineola, New York, covering a distance of 3,000 miles in four and a half days.\n\nThe age of the airship lasted a further two decades. Here's the lounge on the R100, which flew from 1929-1930. It had three decks. The lower deck contained the crew accommodation, the middle deck had a dining room, which doubled as the passenger lounge, plus the kitchen, 18 four-berth passenger cabins and a gallery on either side for passengers to enjoy the view through the windows built into the skin. The third deck consisted of a gallery running around the dining room and 14 two-berth cabins.\n\nThe Hindenburg began passenger flights in 1936 and made 36 Atlantic crossings. Fares was $400 one-way (around $7,000 today). Westward journey times ranged from 53 to 78 hours, eastward took 43 to 61 hours. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 signalled the end of the airship era.\n\nIn 1927, Charles Lindbergh completed the first nonstop flight from New York to the European continental land mass, and the first solo crossing of the Atlantic. His journey from Roosevelt Field, Mineola, New York, to Le Bourget Airport near Paris took almost 34 hours.\n\nSeaplanes were used for transatlantic flights in the 1930s. Pictured above is the Dornier Do X, the largest, heaviest, and most powerful flying boat in the world when it was unveiled in 1929. A test flight on October 21 of that year had 169 people on board, a passenger record that was not broken for 20 years. It completed its first transatlantic flight in 1931.\n\nPan Am purchased nine Boeing 314 Clippers in 1939, a long-range flying boat capable of crossing the Atlantic. They offered \"one-class\" luxury travel, a necessity given the amount of time passengers spent on board – cruising speed was only 188 miles per hour. The 36 seats could be converted into bunks, they had a lounge and dining area, and the galleys were crewed by chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women were provided with separate dressing rooms, and white-coated stewards served five- and six-course meals with gleaming silver service.\n\nAfter Second World War, North American and European carriers such as Pan Am, TWA, Trans Canada Airlines, BOAC, and Air France acquired larger piston airliners that could cross the North Atlantic with stops (usually in Gander, Newfoundland and/or Shannon, Ireland). In January 1946 Pan Am's DC-4 flew from New York (La Guardia) to London (Hurn) in 17 hours 40 minutes, five days a week.\n\nIn 1953, the Comet became the first turbojet to enter transatlantic service, with BOAC. The plane flew at twice the height and speed of previous airliners and both Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret were among the 30,000 passengers to board the aircraft in its first year. Early sales were strong, with Air France, Air India, Japan Air Lines and Pan Am among the other carriers to place orders. Britain was primed to lead the world into the jet age. But a string of accidents raised doubts about its safety and in the end only 114 were built.\n\nIn 1976 Concorde became the first and only supersonic airliner in service. It flew regular transatlantic flights from Heathrow Airport and Paris Charles de Gaulle to John F. Kennedy International in New York, Washington Dulles International in Virginia and Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados. In 1996, a BA Concorde travelled from New York to London in just two hours 52 minutes and 59 seconds, hitting a top speed of 1,350mph. Its final flight was in 2003."
