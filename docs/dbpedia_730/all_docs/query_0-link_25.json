        "text": "Sorry if this is not exactly related to WW1 as such, but it relates to the same period and probably draws on the same areas of expertise.\n\nDid Winston Churchill qualify as a pilot, and if so did he do much flying?\n\nI happened upon the Wikipedia article on Group Captain Alan Scott while pursuing another line of enquiry. He commanded 60 Sqdn RFC in the first half of 1917 (it was he who signed off Billy Bishop’s combat reports…..). During mid-late 1918 he commanded the Central Flying School, and I was intrigued to find that apparently he “taught Winston Churchill to fly”. The reference given for this leads to the website of Churchill’s archives, and this confirms that Alan Scott was his flying instructor, and that Churchill was slightly injured in an accident in July 1918, but it does not say whether he qualified.\n\nhttp://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/nod...=CHAR%201%2F132\n\nThe only other reference to Churchill as a pilot that I could find was in his own Wikipedia article, which states that during his time as First Sea Lord, prior to WW1, he took an interest in Naval Aviation (I’ve seen other evidence of that) and that this included taking flying lessons. The reference for that leads to a thread on the aerodrome.com which turns out to be closed. So did he have two goes at learning to fly?\n\nCross and Cockade are publishing alphabetical lists of people who gained RAeC certificates up to 1918. I have only recently joined that organisation and I don’t have the C’s. Can anyone tell me if Churchill appears in this? (He may be listed as Spenser Churchill, and the S’s haven’t come out yet).\n\nOf course in WW2 he was fond of wearing an Air Commodore’s uniform; I don’t know if this had official status and I can’t locate a photo that shows whether he wore a pilot’s wings. There is a famous photo of him sitting in the pilots seat of a Boeing Clipper in mid-Atlantic, with a cigar on and looking very pleased with himself, but presumably there was an anxious BOAC (or RAF Ferry Command?) captain very close to hand.\n\nAdrian\n\nWinston Churchill’s flying is well documented in both photographs and correspondence pre WWI –WW2. Some examples from old tech books:\n\nMartin Gilbert, Winston Churchill– a Photographic Portrait, revised version,1988, 104&105 show him on a practice flight at Eastchurch (Daily Sketch 24 February 1914); 113 WC in flying gear and quoting his letter 29/5/1914 to Clementine renouncing flying (Radio Times Hulton Picture Archive: P2444); 214 climbing into co-pilot’s seat of a bi-plane at Kenley 16 April 1939 on being made Honorary Air Commodore (Fox Photos: 218803).\n\n20 January 1965 Telegraph Obituary Supplement, IV pictures him by a plane in 1914 with the caption: “As a pilot he was not a success.”\n\nAs for his wings they seem to have appeared during the course of WW2: H Stafford Northcote, Winston Churchill Man of Destiny, 6 shows him visiting RAF aircrew c.1940 in his Air Commodore’s uniform without wings; p.16 patting Monty’s dog Rommel, again in A/Cde uniform he now has wings (Gilbert, Photographic Portrait, 309 dates it to 7/8/1944); p.64 shows him at the controls of Boeing 314 Flying Boat “Berwick” enroute for Bermuda 1942 (all Imperial War Museum).\n\nNeil Ferrier, Churchill the Man of the Century, 19 shows: him “Visiting the Central Flying School, September 1912”; “A flight over Portsmouth Harbour, 1914” in aircraft 95; and “on a transatlantic flight to the Bermuda Conference” a different shot to the above.\n\nGreat War Forum\n\nThe pics I’ve found do seem to be from that one flight and it is the one mentioned in the biographies; I’d agree that he had the flying bug and was frustrated that he never got the licence. Was his bulk any worse that Goering’s? By 1939 at Kenley he definitely looks as if he was uncomfortable getting in.\n\nSome of the planes that Churchill flew listed in Page & Sturtivant Royal Navy Aircraft Serials and Units 1911-1919 No.2 Short S.38 (GV Wildman-Lushington), No.95 Maurice Farman Longhorn (AM Longmore), No.149 Sopwith “Socialble” (SDA Grey: 3 times; used by the same pilot for the raid on Cologne 22/9/1914). He is not listed in the index, so I’ve probably missed several references.\n\nFor someone to spend so long learning especially pre war suggests that Churchill was spectacularly bad at it! The difference is that Trenchard did qualify! With regards to the princes I doubt there was an instructor who wanted to be the one who let them solo and then crash. The Prince of Wales might have had a playboy image at the end of the 20s, but the Duke of York (later George VI) never did. He was not regarded as someone to wrap in cotton wool, went to Jutland and if I remember correctly learn to fly with the RNAS."
