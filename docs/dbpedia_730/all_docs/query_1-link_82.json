        "text": "December 1944\n\nAt 10:15 hours on 2nd December a night operation was announced and with all aircraft airborne on exercises the Station pulled out all of the stops to prepare. By 13:00 all aircraft were ready and crews briefed. At 15:45 hours with twenty crews in their aircraft, engines running and ready for take off, the Op was cancelled.\n\nMonday 4th December 1944. Sited on the main north-south railway line Heilbronn had little other importance and as such escaped a serious attack until the railway network in the area increased in priority as a target and 5 Group despatched 282 Lancasters and 10 Mosquitoes. 20 aircraft and crews of 630 Squadron armed with 1 x 4000lb HC and Mk.14 Incendiary clusters.\n\n4th/5th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Heilbronn\n\nTake Off: at 16:04 hours Wing Commander Grindon and crew in NG259.were first away.\n\nME312-A F/O JW Langley\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nPD253-D F/O A Stockill\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O GE Billing\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNN702-J F/O GR Scott RCAF\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N W/C JE Grindon\n\nLM287-O F/O A McGuffie\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R W/O GH Cowan\n\nLM260-S Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nPD254-W F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nNN703-X F/O AM Maclean RCAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nThe target was punctually and accurately marked and the attack went as planned between 19:30 and 19:40 hours from 11.000 to 12,000 feet. Massive areas of fire were seen across the town with heavy explosions between them. On the homeward track incendiaries were again reported being jettisoned offering assistance to enemy fighters searching for the bombers. Considerable fighter opposition was encountered mainly within 25 miles of the target.\n\nAboard Eric Harris’ NG123 “U-Uncle” mid-upper gunner Sergeant Tom Locke and rear gunner Sergeant Lewis were involved in two decisive combats with both resulted in JU88’s being damaged. Sadly the combat reports can no longer be traced. (Note: the Station ORB records the Lncaster as “G-George” but that is considered to be a typing error).\n\nSevere icing in thick cloud was encountered on the homeward flight shortly after leaving the target and it proved hard to climb clear of the cloud. NN703 flown by the Canadian Albert Maclean was the last to return to base at 23:47 hours. The post war British Bombing Survey reported that after the 1,254 tons of bombs fell within just minutes the resulting fires destroyed 351 acres of the town, 82% of the built up area. It is likely that a true firestorm developed and burned the town. Records are contradictory on this night and it is possible that the aircraft flown by the Thompson and Scott crews have been transposed.\n\nWednesday 6th December 1944. In 5 Group’s next attack their 255 Lancasters and 10 Mosquitoes were split to attack two different aiming points, 168 aircraft bombing the town centre and 87 the railway yards. Six-thirty provided 16 Lancasters each armed with 1 x 4000lb HC and Mk.14 Incendiary clusters.\n\n6th/7th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Giessen\n\nTake Off: at 16:46 hours “Cliff” Clifford and crew were first away from base.\n\nME312-A F/O JW Langley\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nPD317-G F/O PS Weston RNZAF\n\nND412-H F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nNN702-J F/O DA Clifford\n\nNG259-N F/O GE Billing\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R F/O A McGuffie\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W W/O GH Cowan\n\nNN703-X Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\n“G-George” flown by Phil Weston and “H-How” by Jack Hoare took off but both abandoned their missions after engine failures, neither are listed in the 630 Squadron Operations Record Book but they are detailed in the 630 Squadron “Ops Record” held at the RAF Museum, Hoare jettisoned his complete bomb load over the North Sea while Weston jettisoned his Cookie and some incendiaries. Weather made the flying tricky for long stretches of both the outward and homeward routes and arriving over the target crews found patchy cloud but had clear visibility of the aiming point. The Controller had the markers placed accurately and on time and gave clear instructions for the attack. The squadron attacked from 20:15 until 20:19 hours from 9,800 to 12,000 feet and was well concentrated in the town with fires spread over a large area. Fighters were first encountered over the target and followed the home route for 15 minutes.\n\n“V-Victor” flown by Rendel Lewis was in combat with a JU88 which was claimed as destroyed by his gunners Sergeants Reg Bennett (mid-upper) and Joe Morgan (rear gunner). No combat report has been located.\n\nSeveral reports speak of jet propelled fighters operating and bombers were seen to be shot down. At 23:57 hours Geoff Stemp touched down at base, the last of the squadron’s aircraft to return. Severe damage was caused at both targets, the raid being a total success.\n\nFriday 8th December 1944. Crews were called from their beds at 03:45 in the morning and briefings started at 05:00 hours. 14 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed for Ops and bombed up with 14 x 1000lbHC TD .025. They were part of a force of 205 Lancasters of 5 Group attacking the Urftdam as a previous raid by 8 Group had failed to destroy it. The Germans were using the dam to release substantial amounts of water when US Forces attempted to advance down river.\n\n8th December 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Heimbach-Urftdam\n\nTake Off: at 08:13 hours Squadron Leader Marcel Cuelenaere DFC RCAF, flight commander, led the squadron from East Kirkby.\n\nME312-A F/O JW Langley\n\nNG125-F S/L MR Cuelenaere RCAF\n\nNN702-J F/O DA Clifford\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N W/C JE Grindon\n\nLM287-O F/O A Stockill\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nPB344-R W/O GH Cowan\n\nLM260-S Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nDespite 9/10ths cloud all crews identified the target visually, the attack ran from 10:48 to 11:14 hours bombing from 8,000 to 10,000 feet and one stick of bombs was seen to straddle the aiming point, other bombs were seen in the right location but prevailing weather conditions prevented proper assessment. 630 Squadron crews attacked between 10:47 and 10:58 hours from 8,200 to 9,500 feet. There were no ground defences and no fighter opposition. One Lancaster was seen to lose its tail fin and rudder before diving into the ground after only two of its crew escaped by parachute, sadly it was a Six-thirty crew. All aircraft were diverted to Tarrant Rushton on return due to very poor weather conditions at base. Ron Stone landed at 13:56 hours, the last to return safely. Lieutenant Lacey in“W-William” landed at Manston short of fuel. Crews were ordered to remain where they had landed until 09:30 on the 9th. The Squadron Bombing Leader F/L George Arkieson is reported to have flown on this attack, it is suspected that he flew as a supernumerary with a crew but was not recorded in the ORB. Rendel Lewis and crew had Failed To Return.\n\nLancaster III, LM637 (Codes LE – V)\n\nPilot – F/L Rendel Forrest Lewis. Age 29 †\n\nFlight Eng – Sgt Leslie Oyston. Age 24 †\n\nNavigator – F/S Kenneth Frank Lenton. Age 18 †\n\nBomb Aimer – F/O Reginald Harold William Usher. Age 21 †\n\nWireless Op – Sgt Cyril Cook. Age 19 †\n\nMid Upper – F/S Reginald Joseph Bennett . Age 25 †\n\nRear Gunner – Sgt Joseph Anthony Morgan. Age 19 Prisoner Of War\n\nSadly LM637 collided with another Lancaster in the target area around 11:00 hours, losing its tail fin and rudder it crashed on the western bank of the Urftalsperre near Schleiden/Eifel. Those who died are buried at Rheinberg War Cemetery. F/L Rendel Lewis was was a Barrister at Law and had been a Navigation Instructor at the RAF College Cranwell his navigator Ken Lenton was only 18 years old. Joe Morgan the 19 year old Rear Gunner from Crook, Co.Durham suffered a broken leg due to flak splinters and parachuted into captivity in agony. His leg was not properly treated and was left to set itself as he passed through a succession of 6 different prison camps.\n\nThe post-war RAF investigation concluded that “following collision Lancaster LM637 fell directly into the lake at a steep angle”. In 1959 the wreckage of the aircraft and remains of the crew were found when part of the Heimbach-Urftdam Schwammeauel lake scheme was drained. The aircraft was positively identified and the crew were buried at Rheinberg War Cemetery, previously they had been commemorated on Runnymede Memorial.\n\nSunday 10th December 1944. An early morning attack against the Heimbach-Urftdam was launched with 16 Lancasters of the squadron participating fully bombed up with 14 x 1000lbHC TD .025 bombs. They took off about 04:00 hours to attack at 07:00 hours but were all recalled and returned to base at about 06:00 hours.\n\nME312-A P/O A Stockill\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nJB290-C F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nNG125-F F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O PS Weston\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNN702-J F/O DA Clifford\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O GE Billing\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nPB344-R F/O A McGuffie\n\nLM260-S F/O AM Maclean RCAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nME739-T F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nThis was not counted as an attack and as such not recorded in the 630 Squadron Operations Record Book or permitted to count towards the number of ops required towards tour completion by the airmen.\n\nMonday 11th December 1944 – 5 Group were returning to the Urftdam with 233 Lancasters and 5 Mosquitoes of 8 Group. The squadron’s aircraft were each bombed up with 14 x 1,000 lb T.D. (.025) bombs.\n\n11th December 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Heinbach-Urftdam\n\nTake Off: at 12:21 hours PD317 Phil Weston and crew were first airborne..\n\nME845-Q P/O A Stockill\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nJB290-C F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nNG125-F F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O PS Weston\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNN702-J F/O DA Clifford\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O GE Billing\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nPB344-R F/O A McGuffie\n\nLM260-S F/O AM Maclean RCAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nConditions were quite cloudy in the target area however bombing was generally reported as being in the correct location, the squadron’s crews attacked between 14:45 and 14:56 hours from 8,000 to 10,000 feet several sticks of bombs were seen to straddle the spillway and an experienced crew reported craters on the spillway and the dam. Most crews had to make 2 or 3 bombing runs before they could get a clear enough view to attack the slipway due to drifting clouds and the smoke from bomb bursts. Attacking at 14:56 hours “C-Charlie” had one bomb hang-up, it later dropped clear over France on the flight home. Some light flak was experienced from the dam and some heavy flak from the neighbouring village of Heinbach. “Billy” Billing’s crew in NG259 did not attack as the crew could not identify the target in the cloud and smoke. Aboard LM216 “K” the Squadron Bombing Leader Flight Lieutenant George Arkieson persuaded his pilot Lieutenant Doug Turner SAAF to orbit the target for 20 minutes until the cloud had drifted past enabling him to identify the dam and execute a pinpoint attack. All aircraft of the squadron had returned by the time that “Jim” Ovens and crew in ND949 touched down at 17:49 hours. Photo reconnaissance confirmed hits on the dam but still no major breaches.\n\nTuesday 12th December 1944 – preparations were made for a daylight bombing attack with an expected take off at midday. At 11:25 hours with all crews in their Lancasters ready to take off the operation was scrubbed.\n\nAt lunch-time a Lancaster (JA908) of 1668 Heavy Conversion Unit on a training sortie from Bottesford lost its port outer engine and was ordered to divert to East Kirkby. Arriving in a period of poor visibility they touched down but bounced back into the air losing their starboard main wheel in the process. The aircraft was unwilling to climb leaving F/O LJ Richer RCAF, it’s pilot, no alternative but to force land in the circuit at 13:09 hours. The Lancaster skidded to a halt and caught fire, seven of the eight aircrew aboard being slightly injured. The flight engineer had a fractured left leg.\n\nOn Wednesday 13th December 1944 preparations were made for a daylight bombing attack with an expected take off about midday for an attack at 15:00 hours. Brieifings commenced at 09:00 and At 12:00 hours, just 15 minutes before take off, with all crews in their Lancasters ready to take off the operation was scrubbed and carried forward for the next day. At 17:10 hours the squadron were advised that they should prepare for a morning take off and to attack at 13:00 hours.\n\nThursday 14th December 1944 – Preparations were made and crews stood by for briefing at 09:20 hours when word was received a one hour postponement. At 10:06 hours two crews of Six-thirty were detailed to join two of 57 Squadron in a minelaying operation. Nine minutes later the remainder of the crews were told that their mission was cancelled but to prepare for a night bombing attack that night. At 13:15 hours the night bombing attack was cancelled but the briefing for the minelaying crews went ahead at 13:30. Two Lancasters were detailed to plant mines in the u-boat passage routes of the Kattegat.\n\n14th December 1944 Night Minelaying Mission “Silverthorne”\n\nTake Off: at 15:27 hours Bill Adams (LL966) took off before Ed Thomas and returned after he had landed, at 22:05 hours. Both squadron aircraft had to be diverted to Spilsby on return.\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nLL966-P Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nIn the “Silverthorne” area visibility was good and from 15,000 feet the 2 Lancasers planted their mines between 18:05 and 18:35 hours in the allotted positions without difficulty. Some heavy flak was encountered from a flak ship in the vicinity and a JU88 was seen but there were no combats.\n\nPreparations were made for an attack during Friday 15th but it was cancelled at 17:00 hours, put off until the following day when at 10:15 hours warning was received for a maximum effort raid. Full preparations were made, flight planning took place at 15:30 and aircrew briefing at 17:10 for a 22:00 hours attack. H-hour was delayed till 22:30 then 06:00 before the Op was scrubbed 45 minutes before take off.\n\nSunday 17th December 1944. At 10:30 a maximum effort attack was announced with flight planning commencing at 13:30 hours for an attack on the town centre and railways yards of Munich, 5 Group sent 280 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitos. 17 aircraft of Six-thirty were detailed each armed with 1 x 2000lb HC bombs and Mk.14 Incendiary clusters.\n\n17th/18th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Munich\n\nTake Off: at 16:01 hours flight commander Squadron Leader Malcolm Eyre in LM260 and Bill Adams in ND949 were the first away.\n\nME312-A F/O H Thompson\n\nNG258-B F/O A Stockill\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O PS Weston RNZAF\n\nNN702-J F/O LA Barnes\n\nLM216-K F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nNG259-N F/O GE Billing\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nME739-T F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nNG123-U F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nPD254-W Lt MT Ackerman SAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nEn-route for the target all radio navigational aids aboard LM260 “S-Sugar” became unserviceable but Flight Lieutenant George Arkieson (Squadron Bombing Leader) assisted Flight Lieutenant Bert Hewitt to ensure a successful attack. Arriving over the target the attacking force found the weather clear with some smoky haze low down. The markers were well concentrated and were believed to have been accurately placed. 630 Squadron attacked from 13,300 to 15,000 feet between 22:02 and 22:11 hours the target appeared well bombed. Again there were reports of incendiary clusters being dropped along the route home as far west as the Rhine. Heavy flak and search lights were active but there were no fighters in the TA. There was Intense light flak between Basle and Mulhaus. Neil Roberts RAAF flying MG123 was the last of the squadron to return at 02:17 hours. Bomber Command recorded severe and widespread damage in the city centre and in the marshalling yards.\n\nMonday 18th December 1944. The next attack involving the squadron was a 5 Group raid on Gdynia far across the Baltic Sea. The cruiser “Lützow” was in port and was a prime target. 13 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed to participate in the attack and were bombed up with 9 x 1000lb HC. At the same time the squadron was instructed to provide aircraft and crews for a minelaying operation.\n\n18th/19th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Gdynia\n\nTake Off: at 16:53 hours Steve Nunns and crew in NG125 were first away.\n\nME312-A F/O PS Weston RNZAF\n\nJB290-C F/O HA Ramsey\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nNG125-F F/L SA Nunns\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLL966-P Lt MT Ackerman SAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R W/O GH Cowan\n\nLM260-S F/O A McGuffie\n\nME739-T F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nNG123-U F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nND949-Z Lt W Adams USAAF\n\n“B-Baker” was unserviceable at the last moment leaving Geoff Stemp’s crew unable to take off. Over the harbour the warship designated as Six-thirty’s aiming point was clearly seen in the expected position but it proved hard to get good bombing runs. Attacking from 11,600 to 14,000 feet between 22:01 and 22:08 hours, bombs were seen to straddle the ship and jetty and there was a large explosion on the jetty followed by an oil fire. George Radley, bomb aimer aboard Mathinus Ackerman’s “P-Prune” found at the critical moment that the bomb release “tit” did not work and they had to orbit to make a second run effectively jettisoning their load over the red marker, “U-Uncle” also had technical problems, Neil Roberts’ bombs landed between the railway tracks and the docks. German records confirm damage to shipping, dockyard installations and housing in the town. Numerous searchlights were in action as were some single engined fighters over the target. Only Bill Adams and crew in “Z-Zebra” landed back at base in thick fog, the Scott crew aboard “E-Easy” landed at Strubby, all other crews landed at Woodbridge. South African Marthinus Ackerman was the last of the squadron to touch down at 03:59 hours.\n\nSimultaneously three of the squadron’s Lancasters laid mines, all 3 aircraft were armed with 6 x Mk.IV mines.\n\n18th/19th December 1944 Night Minelaying Mission “Spinach South”\n\nTake Off: at 03:02 hours NN703 (Frank Millar) was the first to take off.\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nPD254-W F/L M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nWeather was clear and no opposition was encountered when mines were laid from 14,000 feet at 21:55 hours by Matt Miller’s crew and 15,000 feet at 22:07 by Ed Thomas’ crew. A JU88 was seen but it did not attack. NN703 “X-X ray” brought it’s mines back as their H2S failed and planting would not have been reliable. Thomas and Millar landed at Woodbridge on their return in very poor weather conditions Frank Millar being the last down at 03:02 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday 19th December 1944 an op was planned to attack Kaiserslautern, with preparations nearing completion and the aircrew briefing in progress news was received at 14:05 hours to scrub the mission due to bad weather in the target area. Poor weather then descended on East Kirkby preventing any further flying.\n\nThursday 21st December 1944 – 207 Lancasters and 1 Mosquito of 5 Group attacked the Synthetic Oil Plant at Pölitz. 6 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed for the attack and bombed up with 1 x 4000lb HC Minol and 12 x 500lb (Tail Inst) bombs.\n\n21st/22nd December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Pölitz\n\nTake Off: at 16:55 hours NN703 (Henry Archer) took off from East Kirkby first.\n\nNG258-B F/O A Stockill\n\nNG259-N F/O GE Billing\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer\n\nPD327-Y P/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nThe attack was late to start as crews had to orbit whilst the placement of the markers was assessed. The red and green TI’s were found to be 300 yards north of the target and with an adjustment for that the Controller ordered the attack to commence. The attack took place between 22:04 and 22:11 hours from 15,500 to 18,000 feet and some good fires and large explosions were seen. There were numerous searchlights but very little flak and very few sightings of enemy fighters. On return “W-William” was diverted to Kinloss, “X-X ray” to Carnaby, “B-Baker” and “Y-Yoke” to Strubby.\n\nLancaster I, NG258 (Codes LE – B )\n\nPilot – F/O Arnold Stockill. Age 31 †\n\nFlight Eng – Sgt James Duffett. Age 21 †\n\nNavigator – F/O William McPherson James. Age 31 †\n\nBomb Aimer – Sgt Raymond Athol Bruck. Age 22 †\n\nWireless Op – Sgt James Stuart Bain . Age 20 †\n\nMid Upper – Sgt John Henry Quinlivan .Age 20 †\n\nRear Gunner – Sgt Leslie George Pooley. Age 19 injured\n\nDiverted to Strubby due to weather conditions at base “B-Baker” crashed at 03:20 hours at Scrafield Farm between Scrafield and Mareham-on-the-Hill. The dead were buried near to their home towns or relatives across the country. Stockill was cremated at Darlington, Duffett buried at Colchester, James at Stockton-on-Tees (Oxbridge Road) Cemetery, Bruck at Tankersley (St Peter) Churchyard, Bain at Edinburgh (Liberton) Cemetery and Quinlivan Park Cemetery, London. Their teenage rear gunner Les Pooley from Wisbech survived injured and was taken to Woodhll Spa Hospital where he recovered.\n\nAircraft diverted to other stations were ordered to remain there until the weather cleared and due to persistent fog were away until after Christmas. Post raid photo reconnaissance showed that the chimneys of the power station serving the plant had collapsed and that other damage had been caused. The return to Eask Kirkby of “O – Oboe” was certainly in filthy weather however her crew were elated, New Zealander Frank Millar’s lads had never missed an op together and had completed their tour, they were screened and their pilot recommended for a DFC.\n\nTuesday 26th December 1944. After several days of filthy weather the conditions suddenly improved and Bomber Command supported ground actions in the fighting in the Ardennes. A mixed group mission comprising 294 aircraft attacked Wehrmacht positions near St. Vith. Six-thirty were ordered to provide 2 aircraft armed with 14 x 1000lb bombs. It was decided to detail aircraft which had been waiting to return to base from stations which they had been diverted to.\n\n26th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on St. Vith\n\nTake Off: at 13:15 hours LM287 was the first of the two to take off and also coincidentally would be the last to land at 18:10 hours.\n\nNG259-N F/O EJ Monk\n\nLM287-O F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nAircraft climbed to bombing height and encountered no flak until the target was reached where moderate flak came up. Crews were briefed to bomb the Red TI’s and as the target was well marked and visibility good, a good concentration of bombing was observed. The 630 Squadron pair attacked from 13,200 to 13,900 feet at 15:31 and 15:33 hours. Jerry Monk later recalled that they attacked in brilliant sunshine beneath a formation of hundreds of Halifaxes which bombed for six thousand feet above, with thousand pounders and window falling all around. Both aircraft were diverted again on their return, this time to St.Eval a Coastal Command station in Cornwall where the visiting crews reported feeling less than welcome. Two days later when the weather cleared in Lincolnshire and they were able to escape, they roared off the end of St.Eval’s cliff top runway and Jerry Monk turned back to “beat up” the airfield before making a low run past the Flting Control with his cre all making the less polite V for Victory towards their former hosts. Back at East Kirkby Jerry was hauled before the OC who had received a colourful telephone call from his opposite number at St.Eval. With hindsight it was speculated that this incident on an otherwise spotless operational record could be the reason that Jerry Monks did not receive a DFC on completion of his tour.\n\nWith training flights scheduled an order was received for an op and Six-thirty detailed aircraft X, Y, E and R which were on the deck at Strubby. The Lancasters were bombed up and their crews briefed at Strubby. As the day commenced the squadrons’ aircraft which had been sitting on other bases all returned, N and O from St Eval, J from Spilsby, C, F, G, K, Q, T, P and U from Swinderby and Z from Woodbridge.\n\nThursday 28th December 1944. 5 Group mounted a raid comprising 67 Lancasters and 1 Mosquito to attack a “large naval unit” – the cruiser “Köln” and nearby shipping off Horten in Oslofjord. Four aircraft were detailed but only three took off each armed with 13 x 1000lb bombs. As mentioned above the crews took off from Strubby where they had been diverted.\n\n28th/29th December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on shipping in Oslofjord\n\nTake off: at 19:39 hours Warrant Officer George Cowan and crew (PB344) led the section. “E-Easy” (McGuffie) did not take off due to brake pressure problems.\n\nPB344-R W/O GH Cowan\n\nPD327-Y P/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer\n\n630 Squadron crews attacked between 23:49 and 23:59 hours from 7,500 to 8,000 feet bombing visually by moonlight but Wanganui and sea markers were used as proximity markers. A thin layer of cloud obscured the moon and made identification of the ships difficult. The Kriegsmarine cruiser “Köln” could not be found and despite crews remaining over the target area in the face of intense light flak for 31 minutes it was impossible to gain any hits on the target vessels however U-735 was bombed and sunk, her commander and over half of her crew killed. Squadron aircraft landed back at East Kirkby, where Tom Baker (PD327) as the last to touch down at 02:51 hours.\n\nFriday 29th December 1944 – at 10:55 hous on 29th the squadron were warned of a minelaying Op and crews were briefed at 14:15. Two aircraft were despatched with mines.\n\n29th /30th December 1944 Night Minelaying “Onions Area”\n\nTake off: at 15:57 hours Matt Miller in PD254 was first away followed a minute later by Steve Nunns in NG125.\n\nNG125-F F/L SA Nunns\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nAt 19:06 and 19:09 hours from 12,000 feet both crews planted their vegetables in position using H2S and available landmarks. Slight heavy flak emanated from Oslo and some light flak from ships in the fjord but thankfully no fighters were seen. At 22:45 hours NG125 touched down at base 4 minutes after PD254.\n\nSaturday 30th December 1944. Scheduled to participate in a daylight attack 630 Squadron carried out flight planning and aircrew briefings from 08:45 hours. Aircraft were taxying around the perimeter towards the runway to take off when the mission was cancelled at 11:23 hours. Just over an hour later orders were received to prepare for a night attack. At mid-day on Saturday 30th December a B-17 Flying Fortress of 8th USAAF crashed in flames at East Kirkby while trying to land in bad visibility, sadly the entire crew were killed.\n\nDuring the afternoon aircraft were prepared and their crews briefed at 22:10 hours. 5 Group carried out an attack using 154 Lancasters and 12 Mosquitoes against an identified German military supply bottle-neck in a narrow valley at Houffalize. 12 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed to participate and were bombed up with 6 x 900lb and 12 x 1000lb\n\n30th /31st December 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Houffalize\n\nTake Off: at 02:12 hours Desmond Reynolds in NG125 was first off the deck.\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds\n\nNN702-J F/O EJ Monk\n\nLM216-K F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O LA Barnes\n\nLM287-O F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nLL966-P Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O AM Maclean RCAF\n\nNN703-X F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z W/O GH Cowan\n\nThe squaron’s crews attacked between 05:00 and 05:05 hours from 5,000 to 11,500 feet. Solid cloud lay over the target with occasional breaks and crews who bombed saw the TI’s cascading on the ground through patches of thin cloud and often only at the last minute. Jack Hoare’s crew descended below the clouds to 5,000 feet and bombed in clear visibility observing that a good concentration of bombing was falling around the TI’s. The crews of F, J, N T and Z did not bomb. No fighter opposition was fielded by the Luftwaffe. Len Barnes (NG259) was the last to return to base at 07:56 hours.\n\nConfusion exists in the records over who flew ND949-Z in this attack, the F541 states that it was W/O Cowan however the logbooks of F/O Ramsey and also two of his crew record that they flew ND949, so likely the Cowan crew flew NN703-X which the F541 shows to have been taken by Ramsey’s crew.\n\nSunday 31st December 1944. At 10:40 hours an order was received for a minelaying mission, aircrew briefing commenced at 13:00 hours. 2 Lancasters of Six-thirty participated in a small scale mining operation, each carrying 6 x Mk.IV mines in u-boat transit channels in the Kattegat area.\n\n31st December 1944/1st January 1945 Night Minelaying in “Yew Trees” area\n\nTake Off: at 16:20 hours PB894 (Ed Thomas) was the first to take off.\n\nPB894-A W/O EA Thomas\n\nLM287-O F/O M Miller\n\nMines were planted at 20:24 hours from 15,000 feet by Matt Miller in LM287 which returned to base at 23:08 hours. Night fighters are known to have been active in the area and Ed Thomas’ crew Failed To Return.\n\nLancaster I, PB894 (Codes LE – A)\n\nPilot – W/O Edward Ainsley Thomas. Age 26 †\n\nFlight Eng – Sgt David Daniel Jones. Age 31 †\n\nNavigator – F/S William Henry McDonald Marshall. Age 23 †\n\nBomb Aimer – F/S Eric Leese. Age 23 †\n\nWireless Op – F/S Joseph Henry Jones. Age 23 †\n\nMid Upper – Sgt Bernard John Phillips. Age 30 †\n\nRear Gunner – Sgt George Rex Boden. Age 22 †\n\nIt is believed that PB894 was the Lancaster claimed by Hauptmann Eduard Schröder of 3/NJG 3 at 2,800 metres altitude over the sea 50 km north-west of Hanstholm at about 21:00 hours, it was his 18th victory. The crew are commemorated on Runnymede Memorial\n\nNovember 1944\n\nWednesday 1st November 1944. 226 Lancasters and 2 Mosquitoes of 5 Group supported by 8 Mosquitoes of 8 Group attacked the Meerbeck Synthetic oil plant at Homberg. 19 aircraft of Six-thirty were detailed for Ops, each armed with 11 x 1000lb AN-M65 (.025) and 4 x 500lb AN-N64 (.025) bombs.\n\n1st November 1944 Daylight Bombling Attack on Homberg\n\nTake Off: at 13:26 hours in LM260 Wing Commander Grindon was first away.\n\nPD253-D F/O SA Nunns\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN702-J F/O GE Stemp\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O JW Langley\n\nPB344-R F/O GE Billing\n\nLM260-S W/C JE Grindon\n\nME739-T F/O A McGuffie\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nNN703-X F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O DA McGillivray RNZAF\n\nND949-Z F/S GH Cowan\n\nPD317-G F/O H Grayson\n\nArriving in the target area heavy cloud hung over the synthetic oil plant. The early wave of the main force bombed before the markers went down, others arrived just as the markers were dropped directly in front of them. The force leaders were east of the track approaching the target area and the majority of crews reported attacking the markers between 16:08 and 16:12 hours from 17,000 to 18,000 feet. Four crews of 630 Squadron bombed Mors, the built up area south of the target, as they could not identify the primary and “D-Dog” (Steve Munns) bombed Krefeld for the same reason. Moderate to intense accurate flak was encountered over the target and many aircraft returned with flak damage, Wing Commander Grindon’s aircraft was holed in 33 places by flak, the hydraulics were shot away, the main rudder controls and elevator controls were damaged. Some like Henry Thompson’s crew found their aircraft to be “like a sieve” when they inspected it later, Jack Hoare’s “X-Xray” was quite badly damaged by flak but no enemy fighters were seen. ME739 (Alex McGuffie) was the last to return to base at 18:50 hours.\n\nThursday 2nd November 1944. Bomber Command launched its last major attack of the war against Dusseldorf with 992 bombers. 14 Lancasters of Six-thirty participated, each bombed up with 1 x 4000lb HC, 6 x 1000lb AN-M59, 4 x 500lb GP (.025) and 2 x 500lb GP 53 (LD ½ hour) bombs.\n\n2nd/3rd November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Dusseldorf\n\nTake Off: at 16:21 hours the recently promoted Captain Desmond Reynolds of the SAAF took off ahead of the squadron.\n\nPD253-D F/O H Thompson\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF (F/S GR Scott RAAF)\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O H Grayson\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF (F/O RJ Sassoon)\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPB344-R F/O JW Langley\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V Lt W Adams USAAF (F/O AM MacLean RCAF)\n\nPD254-W F/O A McGuffie\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer (Lt MT Ackerman SAAF)\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/S GH Cowan\n\nWeather conditions were clear at the target with good visibility and ground defences were not troublesome with flak bursting clear of the bombers and the searchlights ineffective in the moonlight. The target was marked punctually with Red TI’s which were quickly assessed as accurate when compared with the bends in the River Rhine and the inland waterway dock yards. Minutes later the reds were backed up with green TI’s which fell slightly to the east. The squadron attacked between 19:17 and 19:36 hours from 17,400 to 21,000 feet. Throughout the attack the ground markers were clearly seen and experienced crews rated the concentration of bomber as excellent. The Germans set some decoy red TI’s 3 – 4 miles north west of the target and a slight delay in setting the green markers might have caused some confusion. Large fires were soon burning with a thick pall of smoke over the town, the fires could be seen for 100 miles on the return flight. Fighters began to appear over the target about half way through the attack and continued to attack the main force as it flew home until about 0430East. 6 combats took place with night fighters. PD254“W” arrived 12 minutes late and did not attack. The bombing fell mainly on the northern half of the city where more than 5,000 houses were destroyed or badly damaged and 7 factories were destroyed and a further 18 seriously damaged including some steel production plants vital to the German war effort. Bill Adams and crew were the last to return to base at 22:04 hours in LM637.\n\nOn 4th November Harry Grayson’s crew (7 ops) and that of New Zealander Don McGillivray (4 ops) were posted to 189 Squadron to provide further crews with some operational experience amongst a squadron which had been formed mainly from sprog crews directly from training.\n\nA number of crews recently arrived from training were preparing for ops in early November, they included Canadian Albert “Mac” MacLean’s[i] crew of British lads from 1654 HCUand LFS, 21 year old Richard Sassoon[ii] the son of a retired Army officer from Roehampton and his all British crew, the crews of 26 year old New Zealander Harry Ramsey[iv] from Auckland, his countryman Phil Weston[v] from Hunterville, NZ and Australian Neil Roberts[vi] from Healesville, Victoria. Arnold Stockill[vii] and crew were amongst the most recent arrivals, their captain was a 31 year old married man with two small children, originally from Darlington but resident in Wallasey.\n\nSaturday 4th November 1944. 174 Lancasters and 3 Mosquitoes of 5 Group were despatched to bomb the section of the Dortmund-Ems Canal near Ladbergen, north of Munster, just repaired by the Germans. 13 Lancasters of 630 Squadron participated in the attack, each armed with14 x 1000lb AN-M (.025) bombs.\n\n4th/5th November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Ladbergen\n\nTake off: at 17:34 hours in sequence behind Desmond Reynolds (NG125). One of the aircraft carried Neil Roberts RAAF a new pilot making a Second Dickie trip, sadly the ORB does not show which aircrew he flew with. UPDATE – the logbook of F/O FEH Millar DFC records that he flew with a 2nd Dickie, Neil Roberts RAAF.\n\nLL949-E F/O GE Billing\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FEH Millar RNZAF (P/O NG Roberts RAAF)\n\nLL966-P F/S EA Thomas\n\nME845-Q S/L MA Eyre\n\nPB344-R F/S GH Cowan\n\nNG123-U F/O LA Barnes\n\nLM637-V F/O A McGuffie\n\nNN703-X Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nWeather at the target was clear and visibility good and the marking was punctual and accurate after which the controller ordered the force to bomb the southern of the two lots of red TI’s. The distance between both lots was less than 150 yards and both lay between the two branches of the canal junction. The squadron’s attack took place from 10,200 to 13,000 feet between 19:30 and 19:34 hours and bombing was reported to be very concentrated with multiple sticks of bombs straddled the canal junction. Ground defences were negligible although fighter flares were seen repeatedly between the Dutch coast and the target but few fighters were seen. German decoy interference included W/T messages such as 19:32 hours “Return to Base”, repeated at 19:34 hours and at 19:35 hours “Flare force return to base” but as crews had satisfactory VHF reception they followed the Controllers orders and ignored the interference.\n\nThe banks of both branches of the inland waterway were breached again letting the water drain off and leaving large cargo carrying barges stranded. Post war a report by Industry Production Minister Speer which had been prepared for Hitler recorded that the bombing of the canal prevented delivery of smelting coke from the Ruhr to 3 important steelworks, 2 near Brunswick and 1 near Osnabruck. In post-war interrogations Speer revealed that these raids on the Dortmund-Ems Canal together with attacks on the German railway system produced more serious set backs to German war production than any other bombing. At 22:23 hours Len Barnes flying “U-Uncle” was the last of the squadron to land back at base.\n\nRecords contradict themselves as to whether the Adams crew or the McGuffie crew flew “V” or “X” respectively.\n\nWednesday 6th November 1944. Continuing the campaign, 235 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitos of 5 Group attempted to cut the Mittelland Canal at its junction with the Dortmund Ems Canal near Gravenhorst. Detailed to participate were 17 aircraft of Six-thirty each with a load of 13 x 1000lb AN-M65 bombs.\n\n6th/7th November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Gravenhorst\n\nTake Off: at 16:08 hours NG125 (Desmond Reynolds) and his SAAF colleague Douglas Turner (flying LM216) were the first away. Frank Millar (LM287) had another recently arrived SAAF pilot (Gordon Lacey) aboard as Second Dickie.\n\nPD253-D F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nLL949-E F/O GE Billing\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF (Lt GR Lacey SAAF)\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O H Thompson\n\nPB344-R W/O GH Cowan\n\nME739-T F/O A McGuffie\n\nNG123-U F/O GE Stemp\n\nLM637-V F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nPD254-W F/O LA Barnes\n\nNN703-X F/O AM MacLean RCAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nWeather over the target was clear with some slight haze but the flares were so accurately placed by the Mosquito low-level marker (Flight Lieutenant LCE DeVigne) that they fell into the canal and so were almost immediately extinguished. The Controller ordered the force to stand-by but was unable to get adequate illumination of the target and at 19:38 hours after only 31 aircraft had bombed gave the order to abandon the attack and return to base. None of the squadron’s crews were able to attack. Ground defences were negligible but some fighters were observed. The MacLean crew in “X-X ray” were the last to return at 22:35 hours.\n\nTuesday 7th November Flying Officer Bill Horsman[viii], who had flown as bomb aimer in “Peter” Docherty’s crew until they completed their tour some weeks earlier, was welcomed back when he joined the staff of RAF East Kirkby as Station Air Sea Rescue officer but was immediately waved off again as he was despatched on a 3 week specialist ASR course at Blackpool.\n\nSaturday 11th November 1944. The squadron participated in two simultaneous missions next as 5 Group attacked Harburg with 237 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitoes and also laid mines off Oslo, in the Kattegat and in the estuary of the River Elbe. 17 aircraft from Six-thirty were tasked to attack the Rehenania-Ossag oil refinery at Harburg, each bombed up with 1 x 4000lb HC and 14 x No.14 incendiary clusters.\n\n11th/12th November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Harburg & Minelaying\n\nTake Off: at 16:12 hours the recently arrived Flight Commander Squadron Leader Malcolm Eyre led the formation out from North Kirkby.\n\nME312-A F/O LA Barnes\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nPD253-D F/O PS Weston RNZAF\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nPD317-G F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nLM216-K F/O GE Billing\n\nNG259-N F/O H Thompson\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nME739-T F/O A McGuffie\n\nNG123-U F/O AM MacLean RCAF\n\nLM637-V S/L MA Eyre\n\nPD254-W F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nPD237-Y F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nME312 “A-Able” (Len Barnes) returned early landing at 19:17 hours after his bomb aimer (F/O Derrek Simons) was taken ill and LL966 “P” (Olly Atkinson) had returned early at 18:11 hours when the W/T receiver failed and couldn’t be repaired.\n\nGround defences lit fighter flares from the coast near Heligoland onwards to the target to draw fighters in to the bomber stream, along the route to the target and even on the homeward route. Marking at the target was a few minutes late but appeared to be accurate and the Controller’s clear instructions avoided confusion when the Germans lit a decoy flare. The squadron attacked between 19:18 and 19:31 hours from 16,250 to 19,000 feet. Smoke from the burning oil tanks obscured the markers later during the attack, several large explosions were seen at 19:18, 19:22 and 19:25 hours and heavy black smoke was rising from the oil depot. Ground defences died down as the attack commenced and search lights were being used to indicate the track of the bombers to night fighters. Few enemy aircraft were seen but there were 2 inconclusive combats with night fighters. Realising that they would not make it to the target in time after hearing the Controllers instruction cease bombing and return to base the crew of PD237 “Y-Yoke” (Richard Sassoon) jettisoned their bombs on a concentration of search lights and anti-aircraft guns situated at 5340Nx0900E at 19:50 hours from 17,750 feet. Formation leader Squadron Leader Eyre was the last of the squadron’s Harburg force to return to base at 22:08 hours.\n\nOn the same night two of the squadron’s Lancasters were involved in a gardening operation each armed with 6 Mark VI mines.\n\n11th/12th November 1944 Minelaying in the “Young Eglantines” area\n\nTake Off: at 16:33 hours Frank Millar was the first off the deck, he was also the last to return to base at 21:05 hours.\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer\n\nThe two aircraft and crews designated for “gardening” duties planted their “vegetables” at 19:02 and 19:15 hours in the allotted positions using H2S without serious difficulty although some heavy flak was experienced from Heligoland. No enemy fighters were seen but fighter flares were observed near Cuxhaven. The logbook of Henry Archer proves that the details of the two aircraft are transposed in the 630 Squadron Operations Record Book, and are here corrected- Frank Millar and crew flew “O-Oboe” and Henry Archer and crew flew their regular Lanc “X-X ray”.\n\nNext Bomber Command joined the 8th USAAF to attack targets at Düren, Jülich and Heinsberg in preparation for an attack by the American First and Ninth Armies.\n\nThursday 16th November 1944. The RAF despatched 1,188 bombers to destroy lines of communication and the USAAF sent 1,239 bombers to raid troop positions. 19 aircraft of Six-thirty were despatched to join the force attacking Düren each bombed-up with 11 x 1000lb AN-M65 and 4 x 500lb AN-M64 (.025) bombs.\n\n16th November 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Düren\n\nTake Off: at 12:24 hours South African Doug Turner was the first away.\n\nME312-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nNG258-B F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nLL949-E F/O JW Langley\n\nNG125-F F/O A Stockill\n\nPD317-G F/L SA Nunns\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/L RF Lewis\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O AM MacLean RCAF\n\nNN703-X F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nLM637-V F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nIn a rare moment of awkwardness Steve Nunns’ “D-Dog” went unserviceable at the last moment, Jerry Monk’s crew were taken off the Battle Order making “G-George” available for the Nunns crew.\n\nAlthough there was a thick haze and dense smoke covering the town the immediate target area was clear and visibility was good. The Controller was considered by the main force to be excellent, giving clear precise instructions although W/T reception was poor at times. He ordered the force down to 10,000 feet, the squadron attacked between 15:34 and 15:39 hours from 9,800 to 12,400 feet and bombing was reported to be very concentrated on the target. One very large explosion was seen at 15:37 hours although no fighters were seen and the flak was moderate. An Air Gunner reported that the Lancaster seen to go down in flames at 15:33 hours was hit in the starboard wing by a Lancaster with a fin and rudder painted yellow. The casualty had a red letter painted on a black fin but its squadron letters could not be seen. Tom Baker was the last to return at 18:38 hours.\n\nJohn Langley’s crew aboard LL949 “E-Easy” could not attack as their bombs hung-up when the distributor failed to move, the crew managed to jettison two 1000lb bombs over the North Sea but brought the remainder home. The three towns attacked by the RAF were virtually destroyed. Many aircraft had to divert to Strubby due to very poor conditions over base on their return. The weather remainded very poor and an attempt to return on the following day had to be aborted again due to conditions over East Kirkby.\n\nAfter a heavy rain storm in the early hours of Sunday 19th November a preliminary warning of Ops was received at 10:05 hours – an early take-off was planned and the station put in maximum effort to be ready however the order was later cancelled. The same thing happened the very next day with an 09:40 hours warning, everything was ready for the planned 13:15 hours take off but it was was delayed until 16:25 hours and finally scrubbed at 16:45 hours.\n\nWith their pilots each having completed an op as Second Dickie the crews captained by South Africans Gordon Lacey[ix] and Marthinus Ackerman[x] were to be detailed for ops on the next Battle Order.\n\nTuesday 21st November 1944. 5 Group maintained the pressure on the German inland water transport system returning to the Mittelland Canal near Gravenhorst with 138 Lancasers and 5 Mosquitoes. 21 Lancasters of Six-thirty were bombed with 1000lb GP (.025) bombs.\n\n21st/22nd November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Gravenhorst\n\nTake Off: at 17:22 hours Squadron Leader Malcolm Eyre in PD254 was first away.\n\nND949-Z Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nJB290-C F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nME312-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nNG258-B F/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nPD253-D F/O A Stockill\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nPD317-G F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O LA Barnes\n\nLM287-O Lt MT Ackerman SAAF\n\nLL966-P Lt GR Lacey SAAF\n\nPD254-W S/L MA Eyre\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nPD344-R F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nNN703-X F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nThe marking was punctual but some of the Controllers orders were considered to be confusing. At 20:59 hours some crews were ordered by W/T to descend to 4,000 ft and attack but then received a message by VHF to attack as planned and had to climb back to their original bombing height. 630 Squadron attacked between 21:03 and 21:12 hours from 3,500 to 9,800 feet and was reported as well concentrated, only a small amount of light flak was experienced and no search lights. Small scale fighter activity and only in the target area and start of the route homeward. There were five combats in the target area and one on the route home but none were conclusive. The canal banks were successfully breached and later photographs showed that the water drained off over a 30 miles stretch leaving 59 barges stranded in one short section alone. George Scott and crew aboard NG258 were the last to land at 00:11 hours.\n\nThe Squadron Adjutant, Flight Lieutenant Charles Martin, MM was posted out, an Ealing man, thirty-nine year old former insurance official Flight Lieutenant Alfred Henry Lionel Britton quickly arrived to replace him.\n\nIn the second half of the month a new flight commander was posted in to replace A-Flight’s Squadron Leader Millichap. Squadron Leader Marcel Cuelenaere DFC RCAF[xi] was a French-Canadian who had completed a tour of 30 ops with 97 Squadron between October 1942 and March 1943 which included some of the very long range missions to bomb Italy (awarded a DFC, London Gazette 15th June 1943). He had been presented with his DFC at Buckingham Palace by HM King George VI at an investiture on 21st March 1944. During a long Instructing tour at 1654 and 1660 HCU he survived injury when the Lancaster (W4937) in which he was instructor swung and crashed on landing at Swinderby on 26th September 1943, he instructed further at 1668 HCU and finally 5 LFS before joining 630 Squadron. Not surprisingly his crew included second tour veterans such as navigator 36 year old Manx postal telegraphist Bob Corkill DFC formerly of 9 Squadron and wireless op 31 year old Wil MacDonald DFC who had completed his previous tour with 61 Squadron. Both of these two men would go on to have distinguished careers post-war in the Colonial Service, Bob Corkill in the West African Postal Administration and Wil MacDonald as a Superintendent of Police in Kenya.\n\nWednesday 22nd November 1944. 171 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitoes of 5 Group were despatched to attacked the u-boat pens at Trondheim. The squadron records do not indicate what bomb load was carried by its 12 Lancasters however LL949 which was lost is reported to have had 17 x 500lb MC (.025) aboard.\n\n22nd/23rd November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Trondheim\n\nTake Off: at 15:38 hours Desmond Reynolds (NG125) was first to get airborne.\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nNG258-B P/O GR Scott RAAF\n\nME312-A F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD253-D F/O A Stockill\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nNG125-F Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nLM216-K F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nNN702-J W/O EA Thomas\n\nPD254-W F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD327-Y Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nNG259-N F/O LA Barnes\n\nNG259 “N-Nan” (Len Barnes) returned early 20:59 hours as their bomb aimer was ill.\n\nOn the outward journey a weather front forecast for 5758N was encountered at 56N and spread over 5° of latitude. At 61N there were breaks in the cloud and the target area visibility was very good. The green proximity marker was clearly seen and the first flares dropped at H -13. Fairly intense light flak came up from the target area and the line of fire gradually lowered to converge at about 1000 feet. The Controller ordered crews to return to base at 21:08 hours. Ten searchlights were active and maintained a steady beam to track aircraft leaving the target area. B, F, G. J. K, T, V, W and Y all returned immediately as instructed. The return flight included 5 hours in solid cloud. Arnold Srockill in “D-Dog” landed at Thornaby short of fuel and Ed Thomas flying “J-Jig” was the last to return landing at 03:36 hours. One crew Failed To Return.\n\nLancaster I, LL949 (Codes LE – E)\n\nPilot – F/O George Ross Flood RNZAF. Age 21 †\n\nFlight Eng – Sgt Leslie Thomas Woodward.

Age 22 †\n\nMid Upper – Sgt Frederick Hughes. Age †\n\nRear Gunner – Sgt Maurice Benjamin Henley. Age 22 †\n\nNothing was heard of the aircraft or crew until 26th November when wreckage was found by a farmer on a sandbank near the north bank of Humber off Sunk Islands Sands and reported to Withernsea Police Station. Six members of the crew were found dead but the flight engineer was still alive. Twenty year old Leslie Woodward, a married man from London had survived the crash but was injured and suffering terribly from exposure, sadly he died of his injuries on 1st December. LL949 appeared to have flown into the ground at a shallow angle in a north to south direction while returning from a long distance attack. The crew had operated on the previous night and the Head of the Court of Enquiry believed that fatigue had been a leading factor in the accident after a long range mission flown at low altitude. Amongst the crew was Scots born Charlie Agnew who had emigrated “down under” with his family to Australia as a young child he grew up in Perth, WA, he moved to New Zealand in 1937 and joined the New Zealand Army Department as a Signwriter. The three Kiwis and Sgt Henley are buried in Harrogate (Stonefall) Cemetery, Sgt Woodward is buried at Hampstead Cemetery, Sgt Hughes at Moston (St Josephs) RC Cemetery and Sgt Aspell at Coventry (St Paul’s) Cemetery..\n\nSeveral days of filthy weather followed and the Station was stood down.\n\nSunday 26th November 1944. 270 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitoes of 5 Group attacked Munich with aiming points in several railway centres. 20 Lancasters of 630 Squadron but 2 returned early. The bomb loads are not recorded however it is known that they comprised 1000lb MC and 4lb incendiaries.\n\n26th/27th November 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Munich\n\nTake Off: at 10:35 hours LM216 (Phil Weston) took off from East Kirkby leading the squadron.\n\nME312-A F/O JW Langley\n\nNG258-B F/O GE Stemp\n\nPD253-D F/O H Thompson\n\nNG125-F F/O GE Billing\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nLM216-K F/O PS Weston RNZAF\n\nNG259-N F/O HA Ramsey RNZAF\n\nLM287-O F/O A McGuffie\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q W/O GH Cowan\n\nLM260-S Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/O NG Roberts RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O LF Ovens\n\nJB290-C F/O RJ Sassoon\n\nPB344-R F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nJohn Langley’s “A-Able” returned early after it’s starboard inner failed, landing at Manston at 01:50 hours and Billy Billing’s “F-Fox” landed back at base at 03:59 hours with navigational aids, intercom and bomb sight all unserviceable. The target marking was accurate and all crews saw the concentration of TI’s clearly. To the north there was a single Red TI cancelled by a Yellow and to the west were decoy TI’s set by the Germans which do not seem to have deceived any of the attackers. Large areas of the town were seen to be on fire and the conflagration could be seen 100 miles away. The squadron’s attack took place between 05:00 and 05:24 hours from 15,200 to 17,500 feet and a very large explosion was seen at 05:07 hours just north of the eastern end of the marshalling yards. Ground defences and searchlights were surprisingly light and ineffective. Some fighters attacked and there was 1 combat before reaching the target and 2 combats in the target area. Rendel Lewis brought LM637 in to land at 23:18 hours, the last of the squadron to return to base.\n\nOn Thursday 30th November Group Captain Taaffe OBE relinquished command of RAF East Kirkby to Group Captain Bernard Casey OBE[xii] who would remain in command for the next 12 months.\n\n[i] Albert MacLean (J.28539), RCAF.\n\n[ii] Richard Joseph Sassoon (1802851, 150614), RAFVR.\n\n[iii] George Richard Scott (051658, A.427555), RAAF.\n\n[iv] Harry Alexander Ramsey (NZ 415017), RNZAF.

All but seven of the squadron’s crews bombed using H2S although crews unable to get a decent fix attacked ships which could be seen in the harbour. Five attacked by holding formation with other crews and bombing simultaneously. Experienced crews believed bombing might have been to the east of Wilhelmshaven. They attacked between 11:03 and 11:07 hours from 15,000 to 18,000 feet. No fighters were encountered and the flak was reorted to be inaccurate and short. Unable to identify the primary target both “U” bombed Leeuwarden and “K” bombed Jever. NF961 (Ted Thomas) landed at 13:47 hours, the last to touch down.\n\nThe 630 Squadron Operations Record Book at the National Archives records “Billy” Billing and crew flying “G-George” however this is contradicted by the RAF Museum’s 630 Squadron “Ops Record” and East Kirkby “Raid Book” which both state that “Jim” Ovens and crew flew “G-George”, both providing precise detail of their attack, bombing time, height course, etc and this is also supported by the listing of ops flown by “Jim” Ovens in the recommendation for his DFC. It has been suggested that it was a last minute change.\n\nAlec Swain and his crew had flown the last op of their tour and were promptly screened from ops as he was recommended for a DFC. Their rear gunner 21 year old Geoff Bate from Aston in Birmingham who had flown some ops before joining the crew had finished his tour and been posted away in August having been recommended for a DFC, the remainder of the crew broke up as they were posted to new duties in the weeks that followed.\n\nFriday 6th October 1944. In the last of 32 major attacks against Bremen 246 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitoes of 1 and 5 Groups set out again for the north German coastline. 18 of Six-thirty’s Lancasters were detailed for the mission – 2 armed with 1 x 4000lb HC and 9 x 1000lb ANM59, each of the others with 3,000 x 4lb incendiaries. A minelaying operation was also detailed.\n\n6th /7th October 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Bremen\n\nTake Off: at 17:34 hours New Zealander Ross Flood was the first of 630 Squadron to take off .\n\nLM673-B F/O GE Billing\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nPD317-G F/O SA Nunns (W/O HT Ryan RAAF)\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN702-J F/S EA Thomas\n\nLM216-K F/O M Grayson\n\nNF961-L F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nNG125-N F/O EI Britton\n\nLM287-O F/O FEH Millar RNZAF (F/O LF Ovens)\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nJB290-C F/O A Bates\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O GE Stemp\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer\n\nPD327-Y F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nRoss Flood in “E” had to jettison his bomb load over the North Sea and return early with their pitot head unserviceable. Over the target weather conditions were clear with excellent visibility and crews believed that the markers were accurately placed, 1,021 tons of bombs were dropped of which 868 tons were incendiaries. 630 Squadron’s crews attacked the green target indicators between 20:25 and 20:32 hours from 17,750 to 18,500 feet. The attack went as planned aside from serious interference on VHF. Joe Barton, Eric Britton’s bomb aimer aboard “N-Nan” encountered technical problems and the crew jettisoned their bomb load in the target area. A large area of fire was seen on both banks of the river and flak defences were strong, active and accurate with several aircraft sustaining damage, search lights were also reported numerous and active.\n\nSeveral fighters were in position over the town and “V-Victor” flown by Rendel Lewis was in combat with a JU88 which was claimed as damaged by his gunners Sergeants Reg Bennett (mid-upper) and Joe Morgan (rear gunner). No combat report had been located.\n\nGeorge “Billy” Billing in LM673 was the last of Six-thirty to land at 23:10 hours.\n\nSerious damage was caused in this attack to he AG Weser ship building yards where u-boats and other warships were built, to two Focke-Wulf aircraft factories, the Siemens-Schuckert electrical works and several associated war industries. A German report states that the transport network was seriously disrupted.\n\nOn the same night 3 aircraft were detailed to participate in an operation to lay mines in the “Young Yams” area, two carried 6 x G718 mines and one carried 1 x D46, 1 x 406.B230, 1 x G716 variant, 1 x B230, 1 x D406 and 1 x G716.\n\n6th /7th October 1944 Night Minelaying in “Young Yams”\n\nTake Off: at 17:48 hours Bill Gordon (PB344) was the first of the minelayers to take off and Kiwi Ian Herbert the last of them to return at 22:01 hours.\n\nLM259-F F/O SID Herbert RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/O JO Davies\n\nPB344-R F/L WH Gordon\n\nWeather was fine with excellent visibility and coastal features were clearly identified. There was no opposition and between 20:14 and 20:27 the mines were dropped as required from 1,500 feet.\n\nAt Bardney on 7th October No.5 Group formed another new Lancaster squadron, actually reforming 227 Squadron which had earlier operated Beaufighters in anti-shipping operations in the Mediterranean and Aegean. The new 227 Squadron was to be immediately operational and as such received 9 Squadron’s “A” Flight and 619 Squadron’s “B” Flight supplemented by experienced crews from elsewhere within the Group. Six-thirty contributed the crews of New Zealanders Tony Wilson (4 ops) and Ian Herbert (21 ops) accompanied by those of Arthur Bates (11 ops) and Eric Britton (8 ops). Both the Britton and Herbert crews were shot down on 4th December and Tony Wilson was shot down on 18th December whilst flying with another crew.\n\nSaturday 7th October 1944. 121 Lancasters and 2 Mosquitoes of 5 Group attacked the sea wall east of Flushingas a part of a tactic to flood the surrounding land which was below sea-level and had been recovered from the sea. 630 Squadron had 16 Lancasters detailed for the operation – all armed with 14 x 1000lb (1 hours).\n\n7th October 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Walcheren Dykes\n\nTake Off: at 11:47 hours the first airborne was Henry Archer in NN703.\n\nNG123-U F/O GE Billing\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nPD317-G F/O SA Nunns\n\nME739-T W/O HT Ryan RAAF\n\nNG145-I F/O H Grayson\n\nNN702-J F/O EA Thomas\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer\n\nLL966-P F/O JO Davies\n\nME845-Q F/O LF Ovens\n\nPD327-Y F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nPB344-R F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nNF961-L F/O A Bates\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nLM216-K F/O SID Herbert RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nConditions for the attack were perfect, the weather was clear and visibility excellent, red TI’s were accurately placed in the middle of the Dyke on the seaward side. After a first run up the wind estimation was adjusted and later sticks of bombs fell directly across the dyke. Some bombs exploded immediately despite their long delay settings and caused obvious damage, holes could also be seen where LD bombs had gone into the dyke. 630 Squadron’s crews attacked between 12:32 and 12:39 hours from 6,900 to 8,500 feet virtually all making a visual attack. Accurate flak defensive fire came from Flushing and Breekobs, and 16 aircraft showed flak damage. The sea walls were successfully breached. Edward Thomas and crew were the last to return at 14:51 hours.\n\nWednesday 11th October 1944. 160 Lancasters and 20 Mosquitoes of 1 and 8 Group attacked Fort Frederik Hendrik gun batteries at Breskens on the south bank of the Scheldt whilst 115 more 5 Group Lancasters attacked guns near Flushing on the north bank. 61 more 5 Group Lancasters and 2 Mosquitoes attacked the sea-walls at Veere on he north-east coast of the Island. 15 of Six-thirty’s aircraft and crews were detailed for the operations, 9 to attack Flushing Docks and 6 to attack the sea wall north of Veere – all were armed with 12 x 1000lb AN-M59 and 14 x 500lb ANM64 (.025) bombs.\n\n11th October 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Walcheren (Docks & Veere)\n\nTake Off: At 13:00 hours Steve Nunns crew in PD253 were the first airborne.\n\nPD253-D F/O SA Nunns\n\nND412-H F/O EJ Monk\n\nNN702-J F/O HT Ryan RAAF\n\nLL966-P F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O DA McGillivray RNZAF\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nPB344-R F/L WH Gordon\n\nLM287-O F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD327-Y F/O GE Billing\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\n5/10ths cloud hung over the primary target at 3,000 feet but visibility was good. The squadron’s crews identified the target visually and bombed the sea wall north of Veere from 14:41 to 14:43 hours from 6,000 to 6,800 feet and the sea wall at Flushing between 14:47 and 14:54 hours from 6,800 to 7,800 feet. A good concentration of bomb bursts were evident in the northern part of the dockyards and towards the end of the attack the aiming point was no longer visible due to bomb bursts. Flak was negligible and no fighters were seen. 630/E didn’t see the markers until too late and bombed the dyke visually, south of the canal mouth at Veere. ND412 (“Jerry” Monk) was the last aircraft back to East Kirkby at 16:20 hours.\n\nOn 14th October 1944 Wing Commander John Grindon[i] took command of 630 Squadron. A 27 year old from Newquay in Cornwall, Grindon’s father had been killed at Ypres less than a month after his birth, graduating from RAF Cranwell in 1937 he joined 98 Squadron flying Hawker Hinds and shortly before the outbreak of war 150 Squadron flying Fairey Battles. Serving in France during the Phoney War he was posted to the UK on a Navigation course shortly before the Fairey Battle equipped squadrons were annihilated and following that to Canada as an instructor with 34 OTU at Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick. John Grindon maintained a barrage of requests to return to operational flying until July 1944 when he was posted to 106 Squadron to replace a Flight Commander who had just failed to return. Having flown 13 ops with 106 Squadron and proven himself a very able flight commander he had gained sufficient operational experience to take command of 630 Squadron. Wing Commander Blome-Jones left the station promptly to take up a staff position.\n\nEric Harris’ crew were allocated NG123 “U-Uncle” as “their own” and immediately commissioned nose art worthy of an 8th USAAF B-17. Adorned with a reclining blonde nude beneath “Oh U Beauty” their Lancaster is recognisable on many photos from that stage onwards.\n\nWelcomed back at East Kirkby with a “bash” in the mess celebrating their successful evasions and time with the French Resistance after being shot down over France in mid March and late July respectively, Len “Barney” Barnes and Bill Adams USAAF arrived back with 630 Squadron. Both quickly re-formed crews from available bods and were soon back on Battle Orders to complete their tours, Barnes immediately opted to make another trip as Second Dickie to “get his hand in” in the light of the changes to ops since he’d last flown. Quickly making friends with Flying Officer John Black[ii] a senior air gunner about to commence his second tour, having no mid-upper gunner for his new crew Barnes was delighted to have Johnny Black join him.\n\nSaturday 14th October 1944. 5 Group tried to destroy Brunswick 4 times in 1944 and finally accomplished that aim in its coming operation mounted by 233 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitoes. 20 of the squadron were detailed to participate, all armed with 2 x 1000lb MC and 16 x No.14 Mk.I clusters.\n\n14th/15th October 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Brunswick\n\nTake Off: at 22:25 hours SAAF pilot Desmond Reynolds in NF961 was first to take off from East Kirkby. Ross Flood apparently flew “J” borrowed from 57 Squadron.\n\nPD253-D F/O GE Billing\n\nME626-57 F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNG145-I F/O GE Stemp\n\nNN702-J F/S EA Thomas\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nNF961-L Lt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O LF Ovens\n\nLL966-P F/O HT Ryan RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R F/L WH Gordon (F/O LA Barnes)\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer (F/S GH Cowan)\n\nPD327-Y F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nThe marking was punctual and red TI’s were assessed as 200 yards west of the aiming point so crews were ordered to bomb the eastern edge of the grouping of red TI’s. A good concentration of bombing resulted in the town being well ablaze by the time the attack ended. Crews of 630 Squadron attacked between 02:26 and 03:38 hours from 18,200 to 19,000 feet and on their return complained that some squadrons had jettisoned considerable quantities of incendiaries along the route home for the first 50 miles which gave great assistance to enemy fighters and ground defences. Two aircraft sustained flak damage over the target and there were 4 combats with enemy fighters but no claims or damage. Ted Thomas landed NN702 at 07:41 hours, the last to touch down. The centre of Brunswick was gutted and German reports state that 150 hectares of the town were hit.\n\nSunday 15th October 1944. 630 Squadron were detailed to contribute 2 Lancasters and crews to a minelaying operation in the “Silverthorn” area. Each carried 6 x Mk.IV mines.\n\n15th/16th October 1944 Night Minelaying in the Kattegat\n\nTake Off: at 18:40 hours Henry Archer was the first away, he landed at 01:00 hours at Syerston, shortly after Bill Gordon touched down at Strubby.\n\nLL966-P F/L WH Gordon\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer\n\nAn unsuccessful sortie as both aircraft had H2S failures and couldn’t identify landmarks visually in 7/10ths cloud cover so returned with their loads intact. One source states that the Archer crew flew “I-Item” on this night.\n\nTwenty-four year old Dennis Brammer[iii] from Stone in Staffordshire and his crew who had recently joined the squadron from training were in the early stages of operational readiness exercises. Brammer went to school at Henley High School and then Alleyne’s Grammar School also in Stone. On leaving school in April 1938 he joined the staff of National Provincial Bank as a probationery clerk at their Worcester branch, being promoted to junior clerk in July 1938 and then to clerk in July 1940. In July 1941 he left the bank to join the RAF and after training in Canada earned his wings and a commission in March 1943.\n\nTuesday 17th October 1944. 5 Group returned to the sea wall at Walcheren despatching 47 Lancasters and 2 Mosquitoes. 5 aircraft of Six-thirty were detailed, each armed with 14 x 1000lb MC (Delayed fuse).\n\n17th October 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on West Kapelle Sea Dykes\n\nTake Off: at 12:42 hours Rendel Lewis and crew in NN703 were the first airborne.\n\nJB290-C F/O LA Barnes\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nLM216-K F/O GE Billing\n\nNG123-U F/S GH Cowan\n\nNN703-X F/L RF Lewis\n\nThe weather was clear, cloudless and visibility very good. A red TI was accurately placed and crews were able to identify the target visually between 14:00 and 14:15 hours. 630 Squadron attacked promptly between 14:00 and 14:01 hours from 5,000 to 5,700 feet. The majority of bombs fell between the existing breach in the sea dyke and the red TI with several sticks of bombs straddling the dyke. Flak at the target was negligible with only a few light guns and one heavy gun firing from positions north of the town, one aircraft received flak damage, no enemy fighters were seen. “Billy” Billing was the last to touch doen at 15:23 hours.\n\nThat night on a routine night cross country navigation exercise a newly arrived crew crashed and sadly were all killed\n\nLancaster I, NF961 (Codes LE – L)\n\nPilot – F/O Dennis Archibald Brammer. Age 24 †\n\nFlight Eng – Sgt Leonard George Cook . Age 20 †\n\nNavigator – W/O Gerald Joseph Davies . Age 34 †\n\nBomb Aimer – Sgt William Albert White. Age 21 †\n\nWireless Op – Sgt Dennis Gordon Holyoak . Age 21 †\n\nMid Upper – Sgt John Christopher Fitzpatrick. Age 21 †\n\nRear Gunner – Sgt Clifford John Evans. Age 35 †\n\nNF961 crashed at approximately 02:35 hours possibly due to icing, on Harfa Bank near Osmotherly about 6 miles north-east of Northallerton. Four of the crew are buried at Harrogate (Stonefall) Cemetery, the pilot was buried at Stone Cemetery in Staffs, the wireless operator at Birmingham (Yardley) Cemetery and the rear gunner at Bridgend Cemetery in Wales.\n\nThursday 19th October 1944. 263 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitoes of 5 Group returned to Nuremburg to attempt the knock out blow on the city which had avoided total destruction on several previous raids. 20 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed each armed with 1 x 2000lb HC and 12 x 500lb J-type clusters.\n\n19th/20th October 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Nuremburg\n\nTake Off: 17:18 hours Ross Flood and crew took of in LL949 “E”.\n\nJB290-C F/O HT Ryan RAAF\n\nPD253-D F/O GE Billing\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF (W/O JW Langley)\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN702-J F/O GE Stemp\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O LF Ovens\n\nLL966-P Lt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R F/L WH Gordon (F/O A McGuffie)\n\nLM260-S Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nME739-T F/O RA Stone RNZAF\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O LA Barnes\n\nNN703-X F/L HD Archer (F/O JW Hoare RAAF)\n\nPD327-Y F/S GH Cowan\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nThe aiming point had not been marked, almost total cloud cover was over Nuremberg, so the controller ordered the Back Up markers and green and red TI’s, the crews could see the markers clearly and after a 200 yard correction was ordered, a good concentration developed, fires covering a large area. VHF reception was good and the controller’s orders were clear. The squadron attacked between 20:56 and 21:04 hours from 15,600 to 19,000 feet. Ground defences were not strong and light fighter activity was reported over the target. There were combats but no claims and flak engaged several aircraft over France on the return flight. On the return journey jet propelled fighters were reported south of Stuttgart and one crew identified n Me262. A German report confirmed that bombing destroyed 41 industrial buildings and almost 400 houses in the industrial southern districts.\n\nFor three crews it was their last op with 630 Squadron, John Davies’ crew (19 ops) and Aussie Henry Ryan (5 ops) newly formed 189 Squadron on 22nd October and actually went on 23rd, almost a week later on 29th they were followed by Flight Lieutenant Bill Gordon’s crew who had flown 24 ops with 630 Squadron, on arrival Gordon was promoted Squadron Leader and became a flight commander. A week later two more of Six-thirty’s crews would be joining them.\n\nOn 22 October Flight Lieut Freddie Spencer, recently awarded the DFC after almost 60 Ops flown during two tours, was posted to Instructional Duties. He had flown on Ops with 630 Squadron from 1 January 1944 through until 17 Sep 1944\n\nMonday 23rd October 1944. 112 Lancasters of 5 Group were despatched to attack the Flushing coastal gun batteries. 6 aircraft of Six-thirty were detailed, they were bombed-up with 14 x 1000lb AN-M65 (.025) bombs.\n\n23rd October 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Flushing\n\nTake Off: at 15:11 hours Lieutenant Bill Adams USAAF was the first off the deck followed almost immediately by George Cowan.\n\nPD317-G F/O EJ Monk\n\nNG145-I F/O GE Stemp\n\nNN702-J Lt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O LF Ovens\n\nLM637-V Lt W Adams USAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/S GH Cowan\n\nVisibility at the target was poor and most crews had to make several orbits before they could identify the aiming points in order to make a satisfactory bombing run. The Controller gave orders to abandon the mission after he had failed to identify the target. The majority of crews did however to make bombing runs and bombs were seen straddling the gun emplacements. All of 630 Squadron crews involved in the attack did bomb between 16:29 and 16:38 hours from 4,000 to 4,800 feet. Some heavy and light flak was encountered on the approach and over the target and 6 aircraft were slightly damaged. No enemy fighters were seen. The last to return to base was PD237 (George Cowan) at 17:51 hours.\n\nTuesday 24th October 1944. 4 aircraft were detailed for minelaying along the established u-boat transit routes of the Kattegat. 6 x Mk.IV mines were delivered by each of the squadron’s Lancasters.\n\n24th/25th October 1944 Night Minelaying in the Kattegat\n\nTake Off: at 17:25 hours ME845 (Henry Archer) lifted off from East Kirkby first.\n\nPD253-D F/L TG O’Dywer\n\nME845-Q F/L HD Archer\n\nPB344-R F/O FEH Millar RNZAF\n\nLM260-S Lt W Adam USAAF\n\nMillar and O’Dwyer’s mines were released at 21:41 and 21:54 hours both at 7,000 feet and Adama and Archer’s at 21:14 and 21:53 hours both from 12,000 feet. The gardening operation was classified successful. LM260 (Bill Adams) was the last to land at 01:50 hours.\n\nOn that minelaying sortie “Pancho” O’Dwyer’s crew completed the last op of their tour, their captain was recommended for a DFC, as was George Arkieson (Bombing Leader) who had regularly flown with the crew. The wireless op Len Wood had completed his tour some weeks earlier and had been recommended for a DFC before being transferred as an instructor. Flight Lieutenant Herbert Graham Cawdron DFM, Squadron Signals Leader, who took his place on a regular basis had been awarded his DFM with 9 Squadron in August 1942 on completion of his first tour. Several of the crew including George Arkieson and navigator Tom Collins subsequently joined 617 Squadron in January.\n\nThe next Battle Order featured the OC Wing Commander Grindon and three recently arrived crews were making their operational debuts after their captain’s had made their flights as Second Dickies. The crews were captained by Australian Jack Hoare[iv] from Shenton Park, Western Australia, John Langley[v] from Eltham in South East London with his all NCO crew and the Scots/English crew of former soldier Alex McGuffie[vi].\n\nSaturday 28th October 1944. Not having flown operationally for several days it seems likely that 5 Group had been awaiting suitable weather conditions to attack the u-boat bunkers at Bergen in Norway. 237 Lancasters and 7 Mosquito markers were despached. 19 aircraft of 630 Squadron participated all armed with 11 x 1000lb AN-M65 bombs.\n\n28th/29th October 1944 Night Bombing Attack on U-boat base at Bergen\n\nTake Off: at 22:15 hours Wing Commander John Grindon flying his first Op with the squadron was the first off the deck.\n\nPD253-D F/L SA Nunns (F/O PS Weston)\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nPD317-G F/O H Grayston\n\nND412-H F/O H Thompson\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN702-J F/O GE Stemp\n\nLM216-K Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FEH Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nPB344-R W/C JE Grindon\n\nLM260-S F/O JW Langley\n\nME739-T F/O A McGuffie\n\nNG123-U F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLM637-V F/L RF Lewis\n\nPD254-W F/O TB Baker RAAF\n\nNN703-X F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O DA McGillivray RNZAF\n\nND949-Z F/S GH Cowan\n\nClear conditions were expected but cloud covered the target on arrival. The concrete submarine pens were punctually marked and at 02:00 hours the Controller ordered crews to attack from between 5,000 and 8,000 feet and bombing took place between 02:03 and 02:13 hours. Crews made two or three bombing runs but in most cases couldn’t see the red TI’s due to filthy weather. At 02:10 controller ordered “return to base”. The Operations Record Book of 630 Squadron indicates that only one crew of the squadron were able to attack but bombing records show positively that Don McGillivray’s crew bombed Red target indicators at 02:07 hours from 6,000 feet and suggest that Tom Baker and Geoff Stemp’s crews also attacked at 02:05 and 02:15 hours from 5,000 and 5,200 feet as all other crews are clearly marked “did not bomb”. Ground defences in the area of the u-boat bunkers were light but some fighters were seen. All aircraft were diverted to alternative stations on their return and landed all across Yorkshire. Jack Hoare and crew were apparently the last to land safely at 05:59 hours when they touched down at Snaith. D, I, K, Q and T landed at Burn, E, H, J, O, R, S, U, V, N, W, Z and X landed at Snaith, P landed at Carnaby, G and Y landed at base.\n\nMonday 30th October 1944. 102 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitoes of 5 Group attacked the southern West Kapelle gun batteries in support of the Walcheren campaign and the Opening of the River Scheldt. 12 Lancasters of Six-thirty were detailed for the mission, which were bombed up with 14 x 1000lb MC (1 hour delay) bombs.\n\n30th October 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Walcheren\n\nTake Off : at 10:17 hours ME845 Reg Waterfall took off at the head of 630 Squadron.\n\nPD253-D F/O GE Billing\n\nLL949-E F/O GR Flood RNZAF\n\nPD317-G F/O H Grayson\n\nNG145-I F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN703-J Capt DCB Reynolds SAAF\n\nLM216-K S/L RE Millichap\n\nLL966-P F/O OJS Atkinson RAAF\n\nPB344-R Lt DS Turner SAAF\n\nLM260-S F/O JW Langley\n\nLM637-V F/O JW Hoare RAAF\n\nPD327-Y F/O DA McGillivray RNZAF\n\nME845-Q F/O RG Waterfall\n\nWeather was clear and visibility good in the target area when the attackers arrived.\n\nThe red Target Indicators were assessed as accurate by the Controller and most of the bombing was concentrated on these TI’s. 630 Squadron crews attacked between 12:14 and 21:21 hours from 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Crews reported that the TI’s landed in sand dunes and could be difficult to see. No opposition of any kind was met. The following day Canadian and Scottish troops accompanied by Commandos sailed their landing craft into the breaches which Bomber Command had created in the sea walls and after a week of fighting the island fell. The last to return to East Kirkby was PD253 flown by “Billy” Billing at 13:51 hours.\n\nFor the crew of Roy “Chappy” Millichap who had joined the squadron mid-tour when the services of an experienced senior pilot were required as flight commander, they had flown their last op with the squadron. All of their recent 16 ops had been carried out aboard LM216 “K” and they were now split up. Tom Scrivener, navigator and mid upper and rear gunners Eric Darton and David Schwab were promptly posted to training units as instructors, the remainder of the crew trickled away from East Kirkby gradually, their captain’s DFC was announced in early December and finally in January Roy Millichap handed over his position as flight commander and was himself posted. Millichap remained in aviation and post-war attained the position of Flight Superintendent for BOAC’s fleet of Constellations receiving a Queens Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air in the 1957 New Years Honours List for his work in that capacity.\n\nAt the end of October 1944 the mixed Australian, Canadian and British crew of 20 year old Flying Officer Richard Scott RAAF were posted to 630 Squadron having been cleared for Ops by S/Ldr Lawrence Pilgrim DFC at No.5 Lancaster Finishing School, he followed them to the Squadron six months later to commence another tour of Ops as Flight Commander.\n\n[i] John Evelyn Grindon (33206), RAF.

Shipping in the dry dock facility at the harbour of Brest was the next target, when the squadron formed a part of he 67 Lancaster attack by 5 Group. 11 aircraft of the squadron were detailed to participate, each with a bomb load of 11 x 1000lb AN-M fused .025 sec plus 4 x 500lb AN-M64 (.025).\n\n2nd September 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Brest\n\nTake Off: at 11:07 hours Terence O’Dwyer (LL966) and John Davies (LM637) took off from East Kirkby at the head of the squadron.\n\nLL949-E F/S GR Flood RNZAF\n\nLM259-F F/O DA Clifford\n\nNN702-J F/O CET Peters\n\nLM287-O F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/L TG O’Dwyer\n\nME845-Q F/O AR Kerr\n\nPB344-R F/O WH Gordon\n\nLM637-V F/O JO Davies\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer\n\nND949-Z F/S RA Stone RNZAF\n\nChas Faulkner and crew had to stay behind when “G-George” went unserviceable at take off. Weather at the target was clear throughout the attack and ships under repair were clearly seen in the docks before the attack. Crews of the squadron all attacked visually between 14:35 and 14:56 hours from 10,800 to 13,500 feet. The scene afterwards was of flooded docks and ships with their decks awash as the bombing had been concentrated on the dry docks and the dockside to the east. No opposition made undisturbed bombing runs possible with many crews going round again for a repeat run before bombing to ensure accuracy. Cloud began to drift in and at 14:14 hours the Controller ordered “stop bombing” for five minutes to allow it to clear. Photographs taken at 14:47 show the docks flooded and both ships sunk. NN702 was the last to return at 17:36 hours.\n\nOn 2nd September a barrage balloon cable fouled the overhead power cables supplying the area and the pumps supplying water to the Station. Great care was taken with any water consumption until supplies resumed the next day.\n\nSunday 3rd September 1944. 675 bombers were despatched to make a second attack on Luftwaffe Night fighter stations in the Netherlands. 17 aircraft of Six-thirty were detailed with bomb loads of 11 x 1000lb MC LD (1 hour) plus 4 x 500lb MC LD (1 hour).\n\n3rd September 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Deelen\n\nTake Off: the Lancasters took off from East Kirkby from about 15:15 hours.\n\nND554-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nJB290-C F/O EI Britton\n\nPD253-D F/O EJ Monk\n\nLL949-E F/O EP Mitchell\n\nLM259-F F/L HH Long RCAF\n\nPD283-G F/O CR Faulkner\n\nNN702-J F/O CET Peters\n\nLM216-K F/S GR Flood RNZAF\n\nNF961-L F/L TG O’Dwyer\n\nLM287-O F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/O E Docherty\n\nME845-Q F/O AR Kerr\n\nPD344-R F/O WH Gordon\n\nLM260-S S/L MA Eyre\n\nLM637-V F/O JO Davies\n\nPD254-W F/O M Miller\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer\n\nND949-Z F/S RA Stone RNZAF\n\nThe weather conditions on the outward flight made formation flying difficult and to the north of the planned track. The proximity marker was however well placed and crews had no difficulty in identifying their aiming points although some had to make a second bombing run to catch a break in the clouds. 630 Squadron crews attacked between 17:30 and 17:33 hours from 14,000 to 16,500 feet. Accurate and heavy flak was encountered over Utrecht and over the target area with 9 aircraft reporting flak damage although only 1 of the 675 raiders was lost. Ross Flood landed LM216 at 20:38 hours, the last of the squadron’s Lancasters to touch down.\n\nThe F541 for this attack does not include Henry Archer’s crew in Lanc NN703 “X” although their participation is recorded in the “Ops Book” at RAF Hendon, the recommendation for his DFC and conclusively in his flying Logbook.\n\nFliegerhorst Deelen was again badly torn up and it’s runways badly damaged. The Luftwaffe obviously decided that enough was enough and beginning on the following day transferred all of its units and aircraft further back into the Fatherland, effectively pulling out of Deelen by 11th September.\n\nCyril Peters’ crew had completed their 6th Op, their last with Six-thirty as they transferred to 97 Squadron Pathfinders where sadly they would all be lost on the night of 10th November 1944 on a night training exercise using LORAN over liberated France. Their Lancaster (PB200) dived into marshes and they were buried at Clichy New Communal Cemetery. Two 97 Squadron aircraft on that exercise were lost, the other disappeared without trace. Investigation of the records of a US Army Anti-Aircraft unit based in the vicinity are scheduled by a 97 Squadron historian.\n\nBetween 3rd and 6th September the “Coastal types” (154 Wing) lodging at Strubby moved out, 144 and 404 Squadrons to RAF Banff and 280 Squadron to RAF Langham. The Base was expanded to 5 Lancaster squadrons with the arrival of 619 Squadron at RAF Strubby and 44 Squadron at RAF Spilsby on 28th and 30th of the month respectively. The administration of the Wainfleet bombing ranges was also transferred from RAF Coningsby to RAF Spilsby during the month. Group Captain JB Jeudwine DSO OBE DFC (formerly OC 619 Squadron) took command of RAF Strubby from 7th October.\n\nABOVE – (front row) Paddy Walsh (rear gunner), Desmond Reynolds (Skipper), Bill Brentnall (bomb aimer). (back row) Alan Ellis (flight engineer), unknown, Noel Coster (Navigator), Ed Burnand (wireless op)\n\nA number of newly arrived crews were preparing for operations at the time, two were captained by officers of the South African Air Force, 26 year old Lieutenants Desmond Reynolds[i] from Breyten and 25 year old Douglas Turner[ii] from Natal who had trained at 1660 HCU.\n\nAnother new crew was headed by Australian “Olly” Atkinson[iii] of Beenleigh, Queensland, another by New Zealander Tony Wilson[iv] from Wellington who had trained in South Africa before coming to the UK and three crews headed by British pilots, 21 year old recently married Geoff Daggett[v] from Ilford, Northfleet innkeepers son Geoff Stemp[vi] just days passed his 21st birthday and recently commissioned Henry Thompson[vii] from Harrogate (originally from Aspatria in Cumberland), who was a 28 year old RAF regular serviceman.\n\nSaturday 9th September 1944. 113 Lancasters and 24 Mosquitoes of 5 and 8 Group were tasked to attack a German target next. 16 aircraft of 630 Squadron were detailed for Ops, each with 1 x 4000lb HC and 2,000 x 4lb incendiaries.\n\n9th/10th September 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Mönchen Gladbach\n\nTake Off: at 02:35 hours Eric Harris and crew in PD254 were the first airborne. Five of the crews were accompanied by Second Dickies, the most ever carried on Ops by Six-thirty.\n\nND554-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nPD253-D F/O SA Nunns\n\nLL949-E F/O EP Mitchell\n\nLM259-F F/L HH Long RCAF (P/O GE Billing)\n\nPD283-G F/O CR Faulkner (F/S DA McGillivray RNZAF)\n\nLM216-K F/O SID Herbert RNZAF\n\nNN702-J F/O MA Swain (F/O GE Stemp)\n\nND412-H F/S GR Flood RNZAF\n\nNF961-L F/O A Bates\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/S RA Stone RNZAF\n\nPB344-R F/O WH Gordon (F/S OJS Atkinson RAAF)\n\nLM260-S F/O EI Britton\n\nPD254-W F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer (F/O AJR Wilson RNZAF)\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nWeather conditions were good with no cloud although there was a little haze or smoke in the target area. Two red TI’s were dropped by the marker force and the Controller gave instructions to attack the southerly one. The squadron’s crews attacked between 05:19 and 05:27 hours from 17,000 to 17,500 feet. Bombing was very concentrated and some major explosions were seen by multiple crews with the first still visible from the Dutch coast on the return. Ground defences were lighter than usual. At 05:27 hours flying at 17,000 feet with a clear moon to starboard of PB344 “R-Robert” Bill Gordon’s mid upper gunner Sergeant Frederick “Dobbie” Dobson sighted a twin engined night fighter on their starboard beam up, at about 400 yards range and ordered a corkscrew to starboard opening fire himself with a burst of 200 rounds.The German continued to dead astern and broke away to port being lost in the darkness. Their rear gunner Sergeant Vic Cardwell didn’t get a chance to open fire and the mid-upper later complained that the fact that there was no tracer amongst his ammunition had prevented him from correcting his sighting and made dim difficult without it.\n\nSergeant Dobson (mid upper) trained at 12 AGS, 16 OTU and 1661 HCU.\n\nSergeant Cardwell (rear gunner) trained at 12 AGS, 16 OTU and 1661 HCU.\n\nEchoing the thoughts of Sergeant Dobson on the lack of tracer rounds was Sergeant Bernie Edwards, John Davies’ mid-upper aboard ND949 “Z-Zebra”. Flying at about 17,000 feet at 05:35 hours immediately after bombing the target he sighted a fighter on the port quarter at about 250 yards. Davies carried out a banking search to starboard and the fighter passed about 200 feet above the Lancaster between the mid-upper and rear turrets. Sergeant Edwards fired a 100 round burst at point blank but without tracer was unable to correct his aim or observe hits. The fighter broke off and disappeared never presenting itself as a target for Sergeant Ted Dodge in the rear turret as their pilot threw the Lancaster into a port corkscrew. No claim could be made. Sergeant Edwards (mid upper) trained at Penross AGS, 29 OTU and 1661 HCU. Sergeant Dodge (rear gunner) trained at Penross AGS, 29 OTU and 1661.\n\nAt 07:47 hours Henry Archer (NN703) was the last to return. The assessment of the raid matched German reports, it was a devastating attack and the centre of the town was destroyed.\n\nMonday 11th September 1944. In support of ground operations German defensive positions at Le Havre were pounded by 218 bombers. 15 aircraft were detailed to join the force each armed with a bomb load of 10 x 1000lb AN-M65 fused .025.\n\n11th September 1944 Daylight Bombing Attack on Le Havre\n\nTake Off: at 05:38 hours Don Mallinson (LL966) was the first off the deck.\n\nND554-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nPD253-D F/O SA Munns\n\nLL949-E F/O EP Mitchell\n\nLM259-F F/L HH Long RCAF\n\nPD283-G F/O CR Faulkner\n\nNN702-J F/O GE Billing\n\nND412-H F/O A Bates\n\nLM216-K S/L RE Millichap\n\nNF961-L F/O SID Herbert RNZAF\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nLL966-P F/L DR Mallinson\n\nPB344-R F/O WH Gordon\n\nLM260-S F/O AR Kerr\n\nPD354-W F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nWeather at the target was clear with very good visibility. 5 Group’s target had no markers at H-hour (07:30) but the other target further south was being marked. The squadron’s crews attacked between 07:33 to 07:42 hours from 10,200 to 13,000 feet. No instructions were received from the controller until he called “Cease bombing” and Return to Base as the targets had been destroyed. British Ground forces led by 2 British divisons stormed LeHavre and a few hours later the Germans surrendered.\n\nSteve Munns and crew in PD253 were the last to return to East Kirkby at 09:27 hours.\n\nReturning safely from LeHavre Eugene Mitchell’s crew heaved a sigh of relief, they had completed their last op, classified tour expired they were screened. They had lost their original navigator Ken Chamberlain who with previous operational experience had completed his tour six weeks earlier and been posted as an instructor with a recommendation that he be awarded a DFC (it was later confirmed). His seat was filled by flight commander Roy Calvert’s own navigator French-Canadian Joe Beaudoin for the next six ops until they were permanently allocated the Canadian “Goodie” Goodhew DFC who had just survived the ditching which claimed the lives of all of his former crew (pilot was Ron Hayes) except himself and the rear gunner. “Goodie” became their navigator through till the tour end. Eugene Mitchell was duly recommended for a DFC and the crew were split up and posted away in instructional roles.\n\nIn the second raid of the day undertaken by the squadron, Six-thirty formed a part of a 226 Lancaster and 14 Mosquito force despatched by 5 Group to Darmstadt in what would be a “night of fighters”.for 630 Squadron. 17 aircraft were detailed each with 1 x 4000lb HC and 14lb incendiary clusters.\n\n11th/12th September 1944 Night Bombing Attack on Darmstadt\n\nTake Off: at 20:39 hours flying LM216 Wing Commander Blome Jones led the squadron from East Kirkby.\n\nND554-A F/O DA Clifford\n\nPD253-D F/O SA Nunns\n\nLL949-E F/S GR Flood RNZAF\n\nLM259-F F/L HH Long RCAF\n\nPD283-G F/O CR Faulkner\n\nND412-H F/O SID Herbert RNZAF\n\nNN702-J F/O GE Billing\n\nLM216-K W/C LM Blome-Jones\n\nNF961-L F/L TG O’Dwyer\n\nLM287-O F/O FE Millar RNZAF\n\nNG125-N F/L DR Mallinson\n\nPB344-R F/O WH Gordon\n\nLM260-S F/O A Bates\n\nME739-T F/S RA Stone RNZAF\n\nPD254-W F/O EC Harris RNZAF\n\nNN703-X F/O HD Archer\n\nND949-Z F/O JO Davies\n\nIt is possible that Don Mallinson actually flew LL966 “P-Peter” attacking Darmstadt, records are contradictory. No cloud and good visibility in the Target Area aided the attackers and the target was punctually and accurately marked so the bombing started immediately, before H-Hour on instructions from the Controller. 630 Squadron’s crews attacked between 23:58 and 00:03 hours from 12,000 to 13,700 feet. Bombing was regarded as extremely concentrated. Several large explosions were seen in the city centre and one particularly large one was reported by several crews at 00:45 hours after they had left the TA. Some of the later arrivals at the target found bombing less easy due to the heavy pall of smoke which was then at 10,000 feet. Ground defences were slight around Darmstadt but the searchlight belt between Mannhein and Frankfurt was very active. Fighter activity in the TA was intense and several combats resulted. The glow from the fires was obvious from 180 miles away on the return flight. Over the target at 00:02 hours at 13,100 feet the rear gunner aboard NN702 “J-Jig” (George “Billy” Billing) Flight Sergeant DG Todd RAAF sighted two FW190’s dead astern and slightly up, as they came into attack he instructed a corkscrew to port and got off a 100 round burst just as the enemy fired, before his guns jammed and he lost sight of the fighters as he struggled to clear the stoppages. Fortunately he was successful before the next attack on “J” which would follow shortly..\n\nAlso over the target moments later Hazen Long’s “Spirit of Canada” LM259 “F-Fox” (the ORB states LM260 but the Combat Report and “Ops Record”both give LM259 which he’d flown on the earlier raid on LeHavre) was sandwiched between two t"
