Aircraft later crashed in 1941 in Iceland. The pilot, Brooks filed a post flight report which read: \"\"While carrying out an anti-submarine patrol on the 14-9-39 in the Western Approaches and in the vicinity of the Fastnet Rock it was noticed that the port inner engine was behaving in an erratic manner all attempts to rectify the matter in the air were unsuccessful so it was decided to make a forced alighting. At 0730 a forced landing was carried out in DINGLE BAY outside the three mile limit and the aircraft taxied to an anchorage in Ventry Bay. A boat was hired and the fractured pipe which was the cause of the trouble was taken ashore and repaired by the local garage. The local superintendant of Police met us at the pier and proved to be most helpful - organising facilities for the repair of the pipe and also for return transport to the aircraft on its completion. At 1400 hours we were allowed to leave after enquiries had been made as regards internment from the Chief of Police in Dublin. During the return to Pembroke Dock we assisted in an anti-submarine search with three destroyers near the spot where the S.S. Vancouver City had been sunk a little earlier - with no result.\n\n[Refs: PJ Cummins article Ireland Eye, Sept. 2005 and Evans, \"\"Help From Heaven\"\", p.18; Both supplied kindly by PJ Cummins;AM Form 78 via M.

The ORB of 7 O.T.U. records this as : Aircraft B.17.F No 1245160 (Captain W C Milton) with nine crew and two passengers, made a forced landing in the sea of Magilligan Point after a Transatlantic flight, and sank at about 12:00 hours. Two anti-submarine trawlers rescused the crew. The Captain fo the aircraft was interogated by S/Ldr. Grenna (Engineer Officer) and a signal was sent regarding suspected sabotage. The crew were uninjured and were taken by air in a Douglas D.C.3 to Prestwick. This loss was recorded as a loss of a Wellington from 7 O.T.U. in some sources, and had been listed as such in this source until 2013. The ORB for the training unit however lists no such loss. Two of the crew became prisoners within months while another six were killed in action. 1/Lt Grimes was killed by shell fragments while on a mission to La Pallice, France on November 18, 1942. 1/Lt Levy was killed in action on 3 Jan 1943 over France. Sgt Cherry, Snover, Garland and Shoemaker were lost on 4 March 1943 when B-17 42-5129 was shot down off the coast of Holland. Kramarinko was taken prisoner when his aircraft was shot down over Holland on 5 April 1943. Kessler also became a POW when his aircraft was lost on 21 May 1943.

Kirschner took off as part of a five aircraft flight from Lands End, England on a 6 to 7 hour flight to Port Lyautey, French Morocco following a B-25 navigation plane. Out over the Bay of Biscay they ran into a severe line squall and the flight broke up while attempting to penetrate. Kirschner tried to return to England, while one other pilot bailed out over Portugal and another was shot down by a Luftwaffe heavy fighter. Kirschner ended up over Ireland while attempting to return to England. The aircraft was salvaged by the 12th of March, when it was handed over the border. P J Cummins describes this incident in his book in Chapter 11. Charles Kirschner had served in the Royal Air Force before transferring to the USAAF. He later served with the 356th Fighter Group in England and flew 52 missions. He remained in the Air Force after the war and served in Germany for a time. He was injured in a car accident in the 1950's and passed away in 1967, aged 52, a retired Air Force Major. His nephew Lance Shawver provided the attached photo which shows Charles probably from his high school days.\n\n[MA File G2/X/1138 clearly shows Kirschner as pilot name and signature.

The crew went on to 379th Bomb Group and eight of them were either killed in action or became POW's in the following months. John Semach evaded capture and made it back to England. The bombardier, Harry X Ford, visited Donegal in 1993 and published a book in 2010, named 'Mud, Wings and Wire' which tells his recall of the events in Ireland and in Germany as a POW. He had visited the wrong town, Portnablagh, based on the memories of locals who were actually recalling the landing of a British Hudson aircraft in June 1942, see above.
