L. I have reason to believe that the initials may be wrong as my great uncle was Arnold Ernest Lundie and he was a WW1 airman, but is not listed on you site.\n\nVeronica van Zyl\n\nCanada\n\nArnold Ernest Lundie\n\nIn May 2020 the following e-mail was received from Warrick Nelson (wr.nelson@xtra.co.nz)\n\nI was interested to discover this page today. My grandfather was not involved in flying, serving instead in the SA Field Ambulance, but two of his brothers were.\n\nF W Nelson is listed (Frank Wright)\n\nHowever, their older brother, Ernest Wright Nelson is not listed. He was born in Barkly East, 1877. He served in East Africa, earning the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nMy father notes in a family history:\n\nOn 5 August 1914, a few days after war was declared, he joined the East African Volunteer Artillery and served till 21st May 1915 with the rank of sergeant. He returned to survey work for a few months but on 22nd December he joined a squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service then in East Africa and was discharged on 4 July 1917 to return to survey work. During his service with the Navy he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for the following deed as reported in the Mombasa Times of 13 June 1917.\n\nEXCITING AIR TRIPS\n\nThe trip was not devoid of excitement, Mehenje was safely reached, but while over the position, the petrol tank began to leak. This was a serious matter for Lieut. Moore and his assistant air mechanic, Nelson, were over 150 miles from home, in enemy territory, amongst country where it was impossible to make a landing, and with only sufficient petrol to do the retum journey if none was wasted. But Nelson rose to the occasion and showed his resource, initiative, and presence of mind. By a clever arrangement with his pocket handkerchief, he managed to catch the petrol as it escaped, and conducted it back to the reserve tank. Njombe was reached safely, but there was less than half a gallon of petrol in the tank when the daring aviators got back to the hangar. The General Office Commanding strongly recommended Lieut. Moore and air-mechanic Nelson to General Smuts for recognition of their excellent work and services.\n\nHe returned to Johannesburg and on 6 May 1918 signed on provisionally with the Royal Air Force and started training as a pilot, but was notified on 18 November 1918 that owing to a change in the European situation his services would no longer be required.\n\nI trust this might be a useful addition to the record. AS he served in East Africa, it is easy to overlook his South African connection.\n\nTheir father (Charles Edward Nelson) served in a number of campaigns in the Eastern Cape in the late 1800s. I have recently transcribed letters he wrote to his parents from this period and made them available 10.5281/zenodo.3692090\n\nPeter Duby e-mailed in September 2020 as follows:\n\n\"... my grandfather, Lieutenant George Arthur Limouzin, was awarded the Royal Aero Club licence 2491 at Shoreham airfield near Brighton on 29 January 1916 and was posted to the newly formed 26th (South African) Squadron Royal Flying Corps which he followed to Tanganyika in mid-1916. In Tanganyika he flew Bristol BE2Cs and Henri Farman HF27s in support of Gen. Jan Smuts advance along the Pangani River. He unfortunately contracted malaria in 1917 and was recuperating in a military nursing home in St.James in the Cape (South Africa) when 26 squadron was disbanded at Blandford Camp in Britain on 8 July 1918. \"\n\nIf you want to read the military service record of George Alfred Limouzin: service record\n\nAndrew Mardell e-mailed in March 2021 as follows:\n\n\"I would like to add another person to your list of South African airmen who served in in the RAF during WW1. My great grandfather, Jack Bruce Wilson (Service Record Air 76/554/71 National Archives) from Port Elizabeth, served from 11 May 1918 until his release from service 14 June 1919.\"\n\nReturn to Society's Home page"
