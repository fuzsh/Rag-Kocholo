        "text": "In honor of the Centennial of Flight on December 17, 2003, Women in Aviation International selected a unique celebration. Instead of inducting the normal number of women or groups into our Pioneer Hall of Fame, we paid tribute to 100 Women Who Made a Difference in the first 100 years of aviation.\n\nEarly Pioneers\n\nIf we accept the premise that the first machine-powered flight by humans occurred on December 17, 1903, with the Wright Brothers, it is appropriate to begin with an almost forgotten contributor to that great event: their sister Katharine Wright. In remembering the financial and moral support she provided to them, her brother Wilbur said, \"If ever the world thinks of us in connection with aviation, it must remember our sister.\"\n\nKatherine Wright first flew with her brothers for their demonstration flights in France in 1909. Katherine could have been the inspiration for the Baroness Raymonde de Laroche of France, who was the first woman in the world to solo in 1909 and the first woman in the world to earn her pilot's license in 1910.\n\nAfter watching some of the early flying exhibitions by the Baroness de Laroche, Bessica Raiche returned to America with her French husband and they began building aircraft in their living room. She is given credit for being the first American woman to solo on September 16, 1910, in one of the aircraft she and her husband built.\n\nBlanche Stuart Scott was technically the first American woman to solo, when a block on her aircraft's throttle jolted out of place and she went airborne on September 2, 1910. She was not credited with being the first American woman to solo by the Aeronautical Society of America because the flight was ruled accidental.\n\nHarriett Quimby was the first American woman to earn a pilot's license in 1911, and she was the second woman in the world to do so. She was killed in an aircraft accident in 1912.\n\nHarriett Quimby's friend Matilde Moissant was the second American woman to earn a pilot's license. She also set several altitude records and was the first person of either gender to land a plane in Mexico City.\n\nTiny Broadwick began her career parachuting from balloons. She was the first woman to parachute from an airplane. In 1915, she became the first person to demonstrate parachutes to the US Army.\n\nKatherine Stinson was the first woman to fly the mail and the first woman in the world to own a flying school. In 1913, Katherine and her mother created Stinson Aviation Company to rent and sell airplanes. In 1917, Katherine toured Asia, and was the first woman to fly in Japan or China.\n\nKatherine's younger sister, Marjorie Stinson, was employed by her sister's flying school as their chief instructor.\n\nRuth Law was the first woman to fly at night in 1913 and the first woman to loop-the-loop. Three years later she broke the world's non-stop cross-country record, for men or women, by flying 590 miles from Chicago, Illinois, to Hornell, New York.\n\nThe 1920's and 1930's\n\nBessie Coleman was the first African American (either gender) to earn a pilot's license, but she had to travel to France to do so, because none of the American schools would train blacks. She earned her pilot's license in France in 1921, returned to America and took up stunt flying to earn money. She died while test flying her newly delivered aircraft in 1926, the day prior to a flying event scheduled in Florida.\n\nIn 1931, Ruth Nichols attempted to be the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, a flight that was aborted by engine failure but netted her a women's altitude record. Later that year she broke Pancho Barnes' speed record. She founded Relief Wings in 1939 to coordinate private aircraft for emergency and disaster relief. Her contribution to winning World War II was in offering the services of Relief Wings to the Civil Air Patrol in 1942.\n\nLady Mary Bailey of Ireland earned her pilot's license in 1926 and immediately flew the Irish Sea. She became the first woman to qualify for a \"blind-flying\" certificate (instrument rating). Two years later she left London on a solo flight to Cape Town, South Africa. She returned solo via the west coast of Africa.\n\nPhoebe Omlie was the first woman to earn a transport license in 1927. In 1930 she won the Dixie Derby Air Race, and then in 1931 she won the National Air Races in Cleveland, the first year women were admitted to the race. She went to Washington, DC, as the private flying specialist for the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) to help the country prepare for World War II, where she chose flying schools that could serve as training centers for military flyers. She tried to convince the CAA to use women as flight instructors, but they turned her down. She took her proposal to the Tennessee Bureau of Aeronautics and they accepted it, prompting other states to do so.\n\nIn 1928, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger. She gained fame from this, but it was by no means her most significant contribution to aviation. She became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic solo in 1932. In 1935, she became the first person to fly solo across the Pacific from Honolulu to Oakland. Two years later Amelia and her navigator Fred Noonan began their around-the-world flight from Miami eastward. After completing 22,000 miles of their journey, they were last seen on takeoff from Lae, New Guinea, on July 2, 1937. She was truly an inspiration to women, her attitude toward success and failure summed up in the following quote, \"Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.\"\n\nIn 1927, at the age of 16, Elinor Smith was the youngest pilot ever to receive a Federation Aeronautique International (FAI) license, signed by Orville Wright. The next year, at age 17, she became the first and only pilot to successfully maneuver a plane under all four New York City bridges, resulting in a 10-day grounding by the Mayor of New York and much publicity. In November 1929, she joined Bobbi Trout in trying for the first inflight refueling endurance record for women, which lasted over 42 hours. At age 19 in 1930, she was voted the Best Woman Pilot in the US, the same year that her hero Jimmy Doolittle was voted Best Male Pilot.\n\nBobbi Trout earned her pilot's license in 1928. In 1929, she regained the women's endurance record from Elinor Smith, and at the same time gained records for the first all-night flight by a woman, most miles covered by a 60-horsepower engine, and heaviest fuel takeoff to date. With Elinor Smith in November 1929, she established an endurance record of 42 hours and 3.5 minutes, which was also the first refueling endurance record attempted by a women's team. In 1996, she was the first woman to receive the Howard Hughes Memorial Award from the Aero Club of Southern California.\n\nThe day after she soloed, Fay Gillis Wells, during a test flight of an experimental airplane, was forced to parachute to safety, making her the first woman member of the Caterpillar Club. She earned her pilot's license in 1929 and was then hired by Curtis Wright to demonstrate and sell their aircraft across America. She combined her love of flying with her love of journalism throughout her long and inspirational career. In 1972, she was one of only three women to accompany President Nixon to China. She also helped create the International Forest of Friendship in Amelia Earhart's birthplace, Atchison, Kansas.\n\nAmy Johnson of England flew her first solo in June 1929. She was the first woman to obtain her ground engineer certificate in January 1930. And, she was the first woman to fly solo from London, England, to Australia in 1930.\n\nIn early 1930, Pancho Barnes earned her first world speed record, besting Amelia Earhart's record. In 1931, she and Lavelle Sweeley organized women pilots and medical personnel into the Women's Air Reserve (WAR), to provide aid during national emergencies. The WAR was disbanded in 1941 when opportunities appeared for women to join such organizations as the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP).\n\nAnne Morrow Lindbergh was the first American woman to earn a glider pilot's license. She was determined to help her husband Charles on his pioneer routes for the airlines industry. In order to do so, she learned Morse code and earned a radio operator's license. In 1933 she accompanied her husband on a 5-month 30,000 mile survey for Transcontinental Air Transport, through Greenland, Iceland, Russia, England, Spain, Africa and Brazil. During the trip, she established a world record for radio communication between aircraft and ground stations when she made contact with Sayville, Long Island, while flying off the coast of West Africa. She was the first woman to be awarded the National Geographic Society's highest award, the Hubbard Gold Medal, for her achievements as copilot and navigator on that trip. Today, Lindbergh is best known as a writer. Her early books are eloquent travelogues of pioneering adventures in the air. Her natural tendency towards quiet introspection and observation came to fruition in literary works that remain among her greatest contributions to aviation.\n\nEdna Gardner Whyte earned her pilot's license in 1931, and her transport license in 1932. She established her own flight school and in 1938 had flown so many hours that she was ranked first in flight hours flown in Look Magazine's list of American women pilots. She was the 10th American woman to obtain her helicopter rating.\n\nKatherine Cheung was the first Asian-American woman to earn a pilot's license in 1932. Three years later she obtained an international airline license and flew as a commercial pilot. She flew aerobatics in an open cockpit Fleet and regularly entered competitive air races. She had planned to return to China in 1937 to open a flying school, but a male friend was killed while flying her airplane. Her father, who had been extraordinarily supportive of her flying but was then on his deathbed, secured a promise from Katherine to give up flying.\n\nNancy Bird Walton of Australia earned her pilot's license in 1933 and her commercial license in March 1935. She was one of the first two women in New South Wales to fly at night and the youngest woman in the British Empire to qualify for a commercial license. In 1949, she formed the Australian Women Pilots Association.\n\nFrench pilot Helene Boucher was the holder of the women's world speed record when she crashed in rough weather and died. She summed up her desire to pursue aviation records in the following: \"It is the only profession where courage pays off and concrete results count for success.\"\n\nJean Batten of New Zealand flew solo from England to Australia in 1934, beating Amy Johnson's record by four days. Soon after she flew from Australia to London, becoming the first woman to fly from England to Australia and back. She later became the first woman to fly from England to Argentina.\n\nEnglish pilot Beryl Markham learned to fly in Kenya and planned to be the first pilot to fly nonstop from London to New York City, crossing the Atlantic from east to west in September 1936. She ran out of fuel just off the coast of Nova Scotia and made a safe water landing.\n\nLouise McPhetridge Thaden was winner of the first Women's Air Derby in 1929 and was the only woman to hold three aviation records simultaneously (altitude, endurance, and speed). She and copilot Blanche Noyes became the first female team to win the Bendix Transcontinental Air Race against male competition in 1936.\n\nBlanche Noyes received her pilot's license in April 1929, the first woman in Ohio to do so. In 1935 she joined the Air Marking Division of the Bureau of Air Commerce.\n\nJessie Woods helped her barnstormer husband create the Flying Aces, the longest-running of the air circuses. Jessie learned to fly in 1929, walked the wing, parachuted, flew as a stunt pilot, performed gymnastics from a rope ladder, and, at age 81, rode the wing again.\n\nWorld War II Military and Support\n\nIn World War I, Helene Dutrieu< of France and Princess Eugenie Shakhovskaya of Russia both served as reconnaissance pilots.\n\nThe first military woman to fly combat missions did so in Turkey in 1937. Sabiha Gokcen participated in the Thrace and Aegean exercises, and in the same year joined the Dersim Operation. During the Seyh Riza Rebellion, she facilitated the land operation by bombing Dersim and its surroundings.\n\nIn the Soviet Union in World War II, women flew combat missions in three predominately female regiments. The 588th Air Regiment (later the 46th Taman Guards Bomber Regiment) flew night bomber missions in the PO2 biplane. The 587th Bomber Regiment (later the 125th M. M. Raskova Borisov Guards Bomber Regiment) flew bombing missions in the PE2 airplane. The 586th Fighter Regiment flew air defense missions in the YAK-1 aircraft.\n\nFighter pilot Lily Litvak of the 586th regiment shot down 12 German aircraft and shared the credit for two others. Regiment mate Katya Budanova shot down even more aircraft but the exact number is unknown. They were both killed in action in 1943.\n\nOriginally a navigator and a Gold Star Hero of the Soviet Union, Marina Raskova used her influence to propose and gain approval for the formation of the female regiments. She was the first commander of the 587th Bomber Regiment, and she was killed ferrying her aircraft to the front lines.\n\nRose Clement served as a Navigator in the US Navy during World War II. These women navigators were the first US military women to be aircrew, to wear wings, and to receive flight pay (half their base pay). They were generally assigned as navigator instructors, in pairs at various bases around the country, after satisfactory completion of celestial navigation training.\n\nIn Britain in November 1939, Pauline Gower proposed and was granted permission to form the Women's Section of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), which would ferry aircraft from the DeHaviland factory to RAF training bases. She was the first woman to be allowed into, let alone fly, a Royal Air Force plane.\n\nAnn Wood-Kelly was recruited by Jacqueline Cochran to be one of the first 24 American women pilots to serve in the British ATA. She ferried more than 900 planes of 75 different types, mostly the renowned Spitfires, to destinations in England and France. In recognition of this service, she was awarded the King's Medal by King George IV, presented to her in Washington D.C. by the British Ambassador.\n\nIn the US, Nancy Harkness Love founded, and was named commander of, the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) in September 1942. The 28 women pilots who made up her squadron were the first women to ferry airplanes for the U.S. Army. She also was the first woman to fly the P-51, P-38, B-25 and the B-17. In 1946, she was awarded the Air Medal and a citation for her leadership of women flying advanced military aircraft.\n\nBetty Huyler Gillies was one of the original Ninety-Nines. She flew as a test pilot for Grumman aircraft, was one of Nancy Love's first recruits into the WAFS, and later served in the WASP and the US Air Force Reserve. In 1981, she received the Elder Statesman of Aviation Award from the National Aeronautic Association of the U.S.\n\nCornelia Fort was airborne with a student over Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. She was also one of Nancy Love's first recruits into the WAFS. She was the first casualty of the group, on March 21, 1943, when she crashed following a mid-air collision on a ferrying mission.\n\nThe Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) >were formed in August of 1943 from two groups: the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) and the Women's Flying Training Detachment (WFTD). While technically civilians at the time, the WASP were involved in all aspects of military flying operations, with the exception of combat and overseas ferrying. More than 1,000 WASP pilots flew over 70 million miles and delivered 12,650 airplanes across the country. The WASP program was suspended in December 1944. In the late 1970s, they were granted long overdue military veteran status.\n\nWASP Gloria Heath flew the B-26 aircraft towing aerial gunnery targets. She was a founding member of the International Flight Safety Foundation. She is recognized internationally for her initiatives resulting in use of cockpit recorders for accident investigation, safety improvements, and a global satellite-aided system of response to disaster/distress.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Doris Lockness was employed at Douglas Aircraft as a Liaison Engineer on the C-47 airplane. She joined the WASP in 1943, and her husband divorced her for doing so. In 1984 she was the first female pilot to receive the Legion of Merit Award from the OX5 Aviation Pioneers.\n\nTwo Chinese Americans, Hazel Ah Ying Lee and Margaret \"Maggie\" Gee, served as WASP. Hazel had traveled to China in 1932 with the intention of joining the Chinese Air Force to fight against the Japanese, but was not allowed to do so. She came back to the US, joined the WASP, and was stationed at Romulus Army Air Base, Michigan. On November 25, 1944, she died as the result of a midair collision with another P-63 on landing approach.\n\nAnother group whose members were technically civilians, but whose military role cannot be denied, wasClaire Chennault's American Volunteer Group (AVG) in China, nicknamed the Flying Tigers. Besides pilots and other ground crew, the group included women flight nurses, such as Jane Foster Hanks.\n\nMary Utterback Barr worked nights in a factory to pay for flying lessons, then moved to New York to attend aircraft mechanic's school and worked on airplanes during World War II. Barr also served as an FAA Pilot Examiner and Accident Prevention Counselor, and in a variety of positions within the United States Forest Service, including being the first woman pilot and smokejumper.\n\nAfrican-American Willa Brown Chappell taught other blacks to fly. In 1942 she became the first African-American woman member of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). With husband Cornelius Coffee, she created the Coffee School of Aeronautics, the first US government approved school of aviation for blacks. The school ran the studies that led the Army to admit blacks into the U.S. Army Air Corps, and was the beginning of the Tuskegee Institute.\n\nMary Feik taught aviation mechanics for the US Army Air Corps. During World War II, she became an expert on several fighter planes, and is credited with becoming the first woman engineer in research and development for the Air Technical Service Command. She flew more than 5,000 hours as a B-29 flight engineer, engineering observer and pilot in fighter, attack, bomber, cargo and training aircraft.\n\nElsie Pickles worked during World War II as one of Boeing's Rosie the Riveters. She bucked rivets under many of the B-29 aircraft being built at the factory. Like thousands of other women at such factories, her efforts helped create the aircraft that helped win the war.\n\nCommercial Aviation\n\nOn December 31, 1934, Helen Richey won a contest against eight male pilots to become a copilot for Central Airlines, making her the first US woman to pilot an airmail transport aircraft on a regular schedule. The male pilots refused to admit her to their union, and they pressured her employers to prohibit her from flying in inclement weather. She resigned rather than be treated unfairly, and joined Louise Thaden at the Air Marking Department of the Bureau of Air Commerce.\n\nEmily Howell Warner became the first permanent woman pilot for a scheduled US passenger airline, when Frontier Airlines agreed in January 1973 to take the bold step of hiring a woman. In 1974, she became the first woman member of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). She became the first female U.S. airline captain, of a Twin Otter, in 1976.\n\nFiorenza de Bernardi became Italy's first woman airline pilot in 1967, when she was hired by Aeralpi. In 1969 she became Italy's first woman airline captain. She also founded the Italian Women Pilots Association. She has flown Twin Otters, Islanders, Queen Airs, Yak-40s, and DC-8s all over the world for various airlines and charter companies.\n\nCanadian Lorna DeBlicquy wrote a guest editorial in 1974 in Canadian Flight protesting the discrimination against women pilots by Crown Corporation Air Transit. The article attracted national comment in the media and contributed to the improved climate which now ensures women a place in the cockpits of Canada's major airlines. In 1995, she was awarded the Order of Canada, which honors Canadian citizens for outstanding achievement and service to the country or to humanity at large.\n\nEvelyn Bryan Johnson received her private pilot's license in 1945, her commercial rating in 1946, and her flight instructor's certificate in 1947. She was been a flight instructor for 45 years, and has given flight examinations for various licenses and certificates for the FAA to more than 9,000 applicants. In 1991, she passed her 50,000th hour of logged flight time, believed to be the most ever accumulated by a woman pilot.\n\nLoretta Jones has been a licensed pilot since 1957. She has all ratings through Air Transport Pilot and is a certificated flight examiner. Loretta has logged more than 25,000 hours, and has instructed nearly 1,000 student pilots during the past forty years. She was instrumental in changing hiring policies at airlines, and counts among her students the first woman pilot for United Airlines.\n\nOrganizations\n\nAda Brown was hired as a stewardess by United Airlines in 1940. Recognizing the widespread discrimination that stewardesses faced on the job, Brown and a group of her flying partners signed up almost 300 women, forming the world's first stewardess union at United, the Air Line Stewardess Association (ALSA) in 1945. Today, thanks to Ada Brown, flight attendants at United Airlines and 25 other carriers are represented by the union that grew from ALSA: The Association of Flight Attendants.\n\nAudrey Poberezny has played an active role in the formation, administration and operation of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) since its founding in 1953. She has been instrumental in helping the organization grow from a local club for amateur aircraft builders into an international organization that embraces virtually the entire spectrum of sport aviation\n\nIn 1954, Jean Ross Howard-Phelan became the 13th woman in the world to receive a helicopter rating. She has participated in three international helicopter championships and both U.S. and international fixed-wing air races. She is noted for her efforts in establishing heliports in emergency medical services. Founder of the Whirly-Girls, Inc. in 1955, she has also written extensively on aviation.\n\nJacqueline Smith Burdette joined the Navy after high school to become an Air Controllman. In 1968, she co-founded Professional Women Controllers, Inc. Her firsts included the first woman manager of an ARTCC to the first woman Division Manager responsible for ATC operation in four states and 3400 controllers. She retired as FAA Administrator for the Alaska Region.\n\nNancy Hopkins Tier started flying in November 1927, and has entered and won many air races. She joined the Civil Air Patrol in 1942, where she served for 18 years and was the first woman to achieve the rank of Colonel as Wing Commander of Connecticut. In 1969 she joined the official board organized by the Ninety-Nines to create the International Women's Air and Space Museum (IWASM), and was IWASMs first President when it opened in 1986.\n\nAmy Carmien founded the publication Women in Aviation in 1988. She was a founding board member of Women in Aviation International (WAI) and a trustee of the International Women's Air and Space Museum (IWASM). Amy has been inducted into the International Forest of Friendship and was honored by the Northwest Michigan Women's History Project.\n\nSeeing the need for an all-inclusive organization to encourage women to pursue careers in aviation, aerospace educator Dr. Peggy Chabrian held her first conference in Prescott, Arizona, in 1990. She then founded Women in Aviation International (WAI) in 1994. Annual conferences draw thousands of attendees, who come to network and witness the awarding of hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships, type ratings, and educational benefits.\n\nSport Aviation and Record Setting\n\nBetty Skelton Frankman became internationally famous after winning the 1948, 1949, and 1950 Women's International Aerobatic Championships. Her Pitts Special experimental bi-plane, Little Stinker, is now displayed in the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nIn 1964, Geraldine Mock became the first woman to fly around the world, completing Amelia Earhart's 1937 goal, in a single engine Cessna 180 named the Spirit of Columbus. Her around the world flight made her the first woman to fly both the Atlantic and Pacific, the Pacific in both directions, and the Pacific in a single-engine airplane.\n\nMarion Jayne is known on six continents as the world record holder for the most cross-country speed race victories, as the FAI Gold Medalist for the longest race, and as the only US pilot to race twice around the world. Jayne and her daughter, Pat Keefer, received the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) Gold Medals for winning the longest race in history--24 days around the world.\n\nElizabeth (Betty) Pfister learned to fly in 1941 and ferried United States Army aircraft for nearly two years during World War II as a WASP. Betty served on President Nixon's Women's Advisory Committee on Aviation from 1969 to 1972. She was also a member of the United States Helicopter Team, competing in the World Championships in 1973 and 1978.\n\nCaptain Julie Clark was one of the first women airline pilots to fly for a major airline back in the 1970s. In addition, Julie has been an internationally-recognized air show performer, flying her personally-restored military trainer, the Mopar Parts T-34.\n\nBoeing 767 pilot Cheryl Stearns was the first woman on the U.S. Army Parachute Team, the Golden Knights, in 1977. She has 30 world parachuting records, is 21-time national woman's champion, and twice world champion. She has over 15,000 skydives, the most of any woman in the world.\n\nPatty Wagstaff is a three-time U.S. National Acrobatic Champion and six-time member of the US National Aerobatic Team. The airplane used in her 1991 victory in the US National Aerobatic Championship, the prototype BFGoodrich Aerospace Extra 260, is on display at National Air & Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n\nWingwalker Patty Wagner and her pilot husband Bob are the longest-performing wingwalking team. They fly a restored BFGoodrich WACO Model CTO Taperwing.\n\nIndustry\n\nJanet Harmon Bragg was the first African-American woman to earn a commercial pilot's rating. She and other black students formed the Challenger Air Pilot's Association and built their own airport near Chicago. Her efforts convinced President Roosevelt to establish Civilian Pilot Training Programs (CPTP) at black colleges and black-owned airports. In 1985, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award.\n\nOlive Ann Beech, along with her husband Walter, co-founded Beech Aircraft Company in 1932. She served as secretary-treasurer and director until 1950, when her husband died. She then took over as President and CEO of the company, and transformed the Beech Aircraft into a multimillion-dollar, international corporation.\n\nMoya Olsen Lear, as a child, loved roller coasters. Being married to Bill Lear, mothering the team that made the Learjet and, later the Learfan, was one heck of a ride. She is considered the mother of the business jet industry.\n\nArlene Elliott was a steady promoter of general aviation for more than 60 years. She and her husband Herbert began Elliott Aviation, a fixed base operation, in 1936. She was instrumental in the turnaround of the bankers' attitude toward the financing of aircraft purchases.\n\nJune Maule was the CEO and exclusive owner of Maule Air, Inc., the world-renowned manufacturer of Maule STOL airplanes. She was the wife and business partner of the late B. D. Maule, aircraft designer and manufacturer. For 55 years she operated the administrative aspect of Maule aircraft, and aircraft parts manufacturing facilities.\n\nNadine Jeppesen was hired by United Airlines as a stewardess. In 1936, she married Capt. Jeppesen and together they established a flight chart business, producing the Jeppesen Airway Manual. She hired cartographers, helped design and write the copy for promotional procedures, and handled a myriad of other details. She continued to work as secretary/treasurer until the company was sold in 1961.\n\nQuiet, unassuming Martha King is the renaissance woman of aviation. From being the only woman to hold every class of pilot and instructor rating, to explaining aviation to the public on TV, to teaching one-half of the new pilots in the country, Martha has made a profound mark on aviation.\n\nNancy Fitzroy is an internationally recognized and honored expert in heat transfer and fluid flow. She was with the General Electric Company until her retirement in 1987, serving in a number of engineering and engineering manager capacities. In 1986 she became the first woman to head a major national engineering society, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nSouthwest Airlines President and COO Colleen Barrett is the U.S. airline industry's highest ranking female and is credited with nurturing the 32-year-old company's unique corporate culture. She began her journey as a legal secretary to Herb Kelleher, the airline's co-founder.\n\nTest Pilots\n\nAnn Baumgartner Carl became a WASP during World War II. She was transferred to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where she became their first and only female test pilot. On October 14, 1944, Ann became the first woman to fly a jet aircraft, the Bell YP-59A.\n\nCecil \"Teddy\" Kenyon, Barbara Kibbee Jayne, and Elizabeth Hooker all flew as test pilots for Grumman Aircraft during World War II. Right off the assembly line, they flew the F6F Hellcat, the fighter plane that was the backbone of the naval air war against Japan. They served as test pilots at Grumman throughout the war, drawing the admiring attention of newspapers and national magazines.\n\nGerman Hanna Reitsch was a test pilot for the Luftwaffe and a protégée of Hitler. As one of the few women who broke from traditional roles in Nazi Germany, she flew the first helicopter, the piloted version of the V-1 buzz bomb, and the rocket-powered Messerschmitt 163.
