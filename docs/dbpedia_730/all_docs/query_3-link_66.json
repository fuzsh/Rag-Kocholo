        "text": "Joy Reed\n\nJoy Reed, EdD, RN, was honored as the 2014 recipient of the Ronald Levine Legacy Award in recognition of her lifetime of contributions to public health in North Carolina.\n\nDr. Reed has held the position of Head of Public Health Nursing and Professional Development since June 1995, and has served in several other lead positions for the Division of Public Health. Since 2002, Dr. Reed has led the Division’s Accreditation Program, making North Carolina one of only a few states in the nation to have such a program. In addition, Dr. Reed has also served on various national committees presenting herself and North Carolina in a professional and progressive manner.\n\nIn light of her passion for public health and nursing, the Joy F. Reed EdD, RN, FAAN Leadership Scholarship has been created in honor of Dr. Reed’s loyalty and dedication to the advancement of public health nursing in the great state of North Carolina.\n\nDr. Reed began her nursing career over 40 years ago, earning her BSN from Duke University, a Master’s in Community Health from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and an Education Doctorate from North Carolina State University. She was a Robert Wood Johnson Fellow and was the only public health nurse in her cohort. In 2008, she was given the Pearl McIver Public Health Nursing Award by the American Nurses Association and was inducted into the American Academy of Nursing (FAAN), the highest honor bestowed upon a nurse. In 2010, Dr. Reed was recognized by Duke University as a Distinguished Alumnus. Through this progression of higher education and awards, Dr. Reed has displayed a character that exemplifies excellence in nursing scholarship and professionalism.\n\nPam Silberman\n\nPam Silberman, JD, Dr.PH, was honored as the 2013 recipient of the Ronald Levine Legacy Award in recognition of her lifetime of contributions to public health in North Carolina.\n\nDr. Silberman is the president and CEO of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine (NCIOM). She has served in this role since 2005, and served as vice president from 1999-2005. The NCIOM convenes diverse task forces to study important health issues facing the state. Dr. Silberman is currently working on task forces to develop a rural health action plan, to increase the use of preventive dental services for children eligible for Medicaid or NC Health Choice, and to reduce early childhood obesity. She recently helped staff different workgroups to identify the decisions the state must make to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nState Health Director Laura Gerald, MD, MPH, noted Silberman's record of achievement in expanding the scope of public health services and programs as well as enhancing public health capacity through policy development and collaboration with the private sector. \"Dr. Silberman is and continues to be successful in making an enduring contribution to North Carolina's state and local public health system,\" said Gerald.\n\nDr. Silberman graduated with a doctorate in public health from the UNC School of Public Health in December in 1997. She obtained her law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981, and her bachelor’s degree in political science and psychology from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1977.\n\nDr. Silberman was presented the award at the State Health Director's conference on Jan. 24, 2013, in Raleigh. The annual event convenes state and local health officials from across the state.\n\nDr. Rachael Stevens\n\nDr. Rachael Stevens was honored as the 2011 recipient of the Ronald Levine Legacy Award in recognition of her lifetime of contributions to public health in North Carolina.\n\nStevens is a senior advisor for the N.C. Institute for Public Health and a consultant to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She began her career as a nurse in health departments in Chapel Hill and Cabarrus County and was a Public Health Nursing Education and Research Specialist in the N.C. Division of Health Services (now the Division of Public Health). Among her many public health activities, Stevens has been a leader in the Association of North Carolina Boards of Health and is a member of the Chatham County Board of Health. On the national level, she has been active in the National Association of Local Boards of Health and has participated in leadership of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and CDC-funded Multi-State Learning Collaborative since 2005.\n\nA graduate of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Nursing, Stevens has been a clinical assistant professor in public health nursing at the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Public Health, providing scholarly advising to many graduate students, many of whom work in public health in North Carolina.\n\nPaul M. Stone and Beth Lovette\n\nPaul M. Stone\n\nPaul M. Stone, president and CEO of the N.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association, received the Ronald H. Levine Legacy Award for Statewide Impact on Public Health for his efforts to protect restaurant and bar workers and patrons from second-hand smoke, helping North Carolina become the first tobacco-producing state in the nation to pass legislation making restaurants and bars across the state smoke-free. The new law became effective Jan. 2, 2010.\n\n“The smoke-free restaurants and bars law was several years in the making, and there is agreement that it was the support of the business community that made the difference in the end,” said Engel. “Paul Stone’s leadership was to work with his board and bring the board along, and they became a key factor in the debate over this legislation. The result was passage of a strong bill in May 2009 that is good for business as well as good for health.”\n\nEngel also recognized Stone for his contributions in planning the business tools that have assisted the 24,000 businesses in North Carolina that must come into compliance with the new law.\n\nBeth Lovette\n\nBeth Lovette, Wilkes County health director since 2002, was presented with the Ronald H. Levine Legacy Award for Local Innovation in Public Health. Lovette is known for her tireless leadership in improving health in the community and state and for advocating with policymakers and legislators for public health issues.\n\nThrough boards and through partnerships with schools, hospitals, non-profits and other organizations, Lovette has worked to build collaborations, develop and implement action plans for the community’s health, improve children’s health and tackle childhood obesity, improve access to care for the uninsured, and address the high rate of accidental deaths due to prescription drug overdoses, as well as to expand health care services and build a stronger health care system in the community. Under her leadership, the Wilkes County Health Department was accredited by the state in 2006.\n\nDon Yousey, Dean Smith and Dr. Leah Devlin\n\nBrunswick County Health Director Don Yousey and Dean Smith, retired long-time basketball coach at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have each been awarded the 2009 Ronald H. Levine Legacy Award for Public Health in recognition of their outstanding contributions to public health in North Carolina. The awards were announced by State Health Director Leah Devlin at the 2009 State Health Directors Conference in Raleigh on Jan. 24.\n\nAt the conclusion of the award ceremony, Dr. Ron Levine made a surprise presentation of a 2009 Legacy Award for Public Health to Dr. Devlin herself. Devlin is retiring on Jan. 31 after 30 years in public health, serving on local, state and national levels. She has been State Health Director and director of the N.C. Division of Public Health since 2001.\n\nDon Yousey\n\nThe 2009 Levine Award for Local Innovation in Public Health was presented to Don Yousey, who has been health director of Brunswick County for more than 10 years. Yousey was honored for a long list of accomplishments, including securing grant money for a new outreach medical unit, establishing a regional office to administer case management services for Medicaid clients, and starting a clinic for seniors with no medical home. Yousey also led a focused effort by the health department and Minority Infant Mortality Task Force that resulted in two consecutive years of a zero infant mortality rate in the county. Among his many other successful projects was the establishment of an umbrella organization to enable area local health departments to provide low-cost diabetes self-management education that is reimbursable by Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurance. The pilot project was one of five in the state to get American Diabetes Association approval in 2008.\n\nA native of Rome, N.Y., Yousey received his master’s degree in public health from the University of Texas at Houston in 1984. He retired to North Carolina from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in 1993. He served as health director of Bladen County for almost four years before transferring to Brunswick County. Yousey is past president of the North Carolina Association of Local Health Directors and was the recipient of the 2003 Health Director of the Year Award and the 2005 Ham Stevens Award.\n\nDean Smith\n\nThe Levine Award for Statewide Impact in Public Health went to Dean Smith. Dean Smith spent 39 years of his life coaching at UNC – the first three years as an assistant and the final 36 as the head coach. At the time he retired, he was the winning-est and most respected coach in the history of Division I collegiate basketball. Recognized as one of the great minds of the game, Smith is widely known and respected for his intelligence, his innovation, and his love for his players.\n\nIn the world of Public Health, Dean Smith is also known and appreciated for his ongoing efforts to encourage North Carolinians to get their annual flu shots. Over the last nine years, Dean Smith has acted as North Carolina's spokesperson for adult immunizations, particularly advocating an annual flu shot for senior adults. His constant support of North Carolina's adult immunization program has been a valuable resource in spreading the importance of flu and pneumonia shots. Coach Smith has rolled up his sleeve every year to show how easy and painless it is to be vaccinated against the flu, even going as far as tossing the coin at a senior adult basketball game to highlight the importance of annual flu shots. His punchline? “Get your flu shot – it’s the best shot you’ll ever take.”\n\nThomas D. Bridges, Mary L. Piepenbring and John H. Frank\n\nThree people have been awarded the 2008 Ronald H. Levine Legacy Award for Public Health in recognition of their many contributions to public health on the local, state and national levels. One local health director and representatives of two philanthropic agencies received the awards at the 2008 State Health Director’s Conference in Raleigh on Jan. 25.\n\nDr. Leah Devlin, State Health Director, presented the awards to Thomas D. Bridges, Henderson County health director; Mary L. Piepenbring of The Duke Endowment; and John H. Frank of the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust.\n\n“North Carolina is fortunate to have these dynamic leaders in private philanthropy and local public health making these significant contributions to health in our state,” Devlin said.\n\nLevine Legacy Award for Innovation\n\nThomas D. Bridges\n\nBridges, who received the Levine Legacy Award for Local Innovation, has been director of the Henderson County Department of Public Health for the last nine years, after serving for five and a half years as health director in Person County.\n\nDuring his tenure as a local health director, Bridges has played a key role in establishing a regional coalition among local hospitals and health departments. Continually seeking more effective ways to serve the community, he frequently volunteers his agency as a pilot site for new ideas, initiatives and systems. In various leadership roles in the N.C. Association of Local Health Directors, he has led the way in advancing technology for local health agencies, such as improved health data systems and access to the Public Health Training and Information Network, which brings interactive public health teleconferences and training opportunities to convenient sites across the state.\n\nBridges also has key roles in the Region 6 Public Health Regional Surveillance Team (PHRST); Western Partnership for Health; N.C. Public Health Executive Committee and Governing Council; Henderson County Partnership for Health, Inc.; and N.C. Center on Health and Aging, and is a member of the Henderson County Council of Aging.\n\nBefore becoming a health director, Bridges was a long-time director of Nutrition Services at the Craven County Health Department. He has also worked as a laboratory technician in hospitals and at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health.\n\nLevine Legacy Awards for Statewide Impact\n\nTwo Levine Legacy Awards for Statewide Impact recognized the work of Frank and Piepenbring and their respective charitable organizations.\n\nJohn H.

Schools for Physical Education Programs; and multiple programs supporting child immunizations, community-based public dental clinics, HIV prevention, nutrition, and chronic disease prevention.\n\nIn addition, since 2001 the Health Care Division of the Trust has invested $10 million dollars in the five-year Project SELF (Smoking Education Lifestyle Fitness) Improvement, the largest and longest, single commitment the Trust has made throughout its history.\n\nMary L. Piepenbring\n\nPiepenbring is director of the Health Care Division of The Duke Endowment, a Charlotte-based private philanthropic foundation. A licensed social worker, she has worked in various positions in hospital administration in North Carolina and South Carolina and held the position of vice president in administration for seven years at the Carolina HealthCare System in Charlotte prior to joining The Duke Endowment in 2000.\n\nPiepenbring and the Endowment were recognized for their support of the N.C. Child Maltreatment Initiative, the Care + Share Initiative, programs addressing childhood obesity, and the Health Network for the Medically Uninsured, as well as improving access to quality dental care, providing funding support to small and rural hospitals, and giving $1 million in flood relief grants to North Carolina communities.\n\nPiepenbring serves in leadership positions with the N.C.
