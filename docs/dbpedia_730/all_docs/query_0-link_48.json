        "text": "For the Royal Naval Air Service’s first large waterborne aircraft, Britain looked across the Atlantic\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Britain’s Royal Naval Air Service had only a few waterborne aircraft, mostly floatplanes. All were small, light and unarmed. But following an intense development eff ort, early 1917 saw the introduction into RNAS service of a large maritime machine weighing more than 9,000lb, twin-engined, equipped with multiple machine guns and able to carry substantial bomb loads over long distances. Th is was the Curtiss H-12 flying boat, imported from the United States to help combat Germany’s U-boats around Britain’s coastline.\n\nThe H-12 had its roots in the pre-war world. By 1914, the leading authority on water-based aircraft was American pioneer Glenn Hammond Curtiss, who’d built and flown various types at his birthplace in Hammondsport, New York State. Early that year Curtiss and John Cyril Porte, a British naval officer turned aviator who also had waterborne flying experience, joined forces there. They planned an aerial crossing of the Atlantic, which if successful would scoop a £10,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail for the first aeroplane to accomplish that feat in under 72 continuous hours."
