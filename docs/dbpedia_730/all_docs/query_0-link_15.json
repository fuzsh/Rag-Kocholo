        "text": "Why was the RAF formed?\n\nImage: A Royal Flying Corps recruitment poster from the Great War (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Royal Air Force grew out of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Navy Air Service on April 1st, 1918.\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was established in 1912 when British military figures began exploring the potential of aerial warfare. It literally added an entirely new dimension to fighting, which until then had been undertaken on land and sea.\n\nThe Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS) was the RFC’s naval counterpart.\n\nBoth organisations were run by the British Army and the Admiralty respectively. They formed the core of Britain’s early experiments with aerial warfare.\n\nFrom the start of World War One up until the founding of the RAF, the RFC and RNAS fought in the skies all over the world. Pilots were considered dashing, courageous “Knights of the Air”. It’s true it did take extraordinary bravery to pilot what we would think of as relatively primitive warplanes. Aerial combat was in its infancy during the great war.\n\nBy the end of the war, over 6,000 men and women in the RFC, RNAS and the nascent RAF had been killed. Flying was dangerous enough by itself without having to dodge enemy fire in the sky and from the ground.\n\nThe importance of remembrance is such that we continue to recognise and commemorate these early aviation pioneers, these duellists of the sky. Not only did they give their lives to bring the Great War to a close, but their innovations and experiences also helped shape aviation as we know it today.\n\nBy the end of World War One, the RAF had around 300,000 personnel and over 20,000 Aircraft. Included in its ranks was the Women’s Royal Air Force until it was disbanded in 1920.\n\nDuring the inter-war years, the RAF was scaled back. Part of its naval obligations was spun off into the Fleet Air Arm which would become one of the five fighting arms of the Royal Navy.\n\nThe RAF was gradually expanded in the 1930s as tensions rose over Europe. By 1939, build-up activity had accelerated with new aircraft and pilots being built and trained as fast as possible.\n\nImage: Lancaster bombers of RAF Bomber Command. Bomber Command would take huge casualties during World War Two (© IWM TR 1156)\n\nSummer, 1940 has gone down as the RAF’s finest hour. From June to September, the Battle of Britain raged over the skies of southern Europe as the RAF clashed with the Luftwaffe. The RAF came out on top, thanks to the efforts of its pilots as well as the hundreds and thousands of ground crew, radar operations, medical teams, and support staff keeping pilots airborne.\n\nBomber Command’s rate of attrition was astronomical during World War Two. While its role has attracted controversy in post-war discourse, there is no denying the danger Bomber Command aircrews faced.\n\nNight after night, bomber crews flew dangerous sorites across occupied Europe, facing torrents of anti-aircraft fire and waves of enemy fighters. Some 57,000 or so airmen died in Bomber Command during the Second World War.\n\nIn total, including ground and aircrews, the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force, and related units like the RAF Regiment infantry divisions, the RAF took around 120,000 casualties during World War Two.\n\nIncluded in their ranks are pilots from all over the Commonwealth, as well as from Allied and initially neutral nations. Canadians, Americans, Australians, Czechs, Poles, Free French and many more nationalities flew for the Royal Air Force during World War Two.\n\nRemembrance Day gives us a chance to remember all those RAF personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice during the World Wars.\n\nRAF Remembrance Day traditions\n\nRAF remembrance mirrors how the other armed forces commemorate their dead on Remembrance Day and Sunday.\n\nRemembrance Day falls on the 11th of November each year.\n\nThe date has historical value. It was on the 11th of November 1918 that the Armistice was signed. This ceasefire between the Entente Powers of France and the British Empire and Imperial Germany marked the end of fighting on the Western Front, essentially ending the Great War.\n\nSince 1919, we have continued to mark this occasion as Remembrance Day.\n\nIts meaning has expanded since then. We don’t just commemorate and contemplate the sacrifice of the dead of World War One. Instead, Remembrance Day is a time to focus on all victims of all global conflicts.\n\nOne of Remembrance Day’s key traditions is the two-minute silence. This is a period where we stop what we’re doing and take a small amount of time to contemplate war dead around the world.\n\nThe two-minute silence is traditionally marked by a bugler sound The Last Post, a song that has since become emblematic of final service and sacrifice.\n\nRemembrance Sunday is slightly different but runs on the same theme of commemoration.\n\nThe Sunday before November 11th is considered Remembrance Sunday unless the 11th itself falls on a Sunday that year.\n\nThe change was made during World War Two to ensure events and services could be organised properly during wartime. The change has also helped broaden the scope away from the Armistice and World War One.\n\nSo, what form does RAF Remembrance Day or Sunday take?\n\nUsually, this means Royal Air Force personnel being involved in local and internal services and events. For instance, aircrew may join parades, attend church services close to nearby barracks, or hold private, RAF-only services on air force bases or in barracks.\n\nFor example, the RAF Queen’s Colour Squadron provided the honour guard at the feet of the Cenotaph at 2021’s Remembrance Sunday service.\n\nThe Royal Air Force may also put on fly-by events where historic and contemporary aircraft take to the skies in memoriam of those who flew them originally.\n\nRAF Remembrance parade\n\nImage: RAF troops on parade at Bury St. Edmunds, alongside British Army Soldiers (Cpl James Ledger RAF UK MOD © Crown copyright 2021)\n\nAs we touched on earlier, the RAF will be part of remembrance parades up and down the country.\n\nThe most viewed of these is the Cenotaph parade on Remembrance Sunday.\n\nSenior RAF leaders as well as a small number of aircrew and staff will be present at the Cenotaph in central London.\n\nThe Cenotaph, meaning “empty tomb” in Greek is a large memorial made of stark white Portland stone. It is dedicated as a symbolic memorial to all casualties and victims of wars and conflicts around the world.\n\nIf the Cenotaph’s design looks familiar to you, you might be pleased to know it stemmed from the pen of Sir Edwin Lutyens. Lutyens was one of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s original principal architects and created some of our most iconic monuments, such as Thiepval in France.\n\nEach Remembrance Sunday representatives of the armed forces come together to hold wreath-laying ceremonies and parades past the Cenotaph.\n\nOther major parades take place in cities and towns throughout the UK. For example, in 2021, the RAF Regiment paraded through Edinburgh city centre, down the Royal Mile from Edinburgh Castle, climaxing with a wreath laying at the Stone of Remembrance.\n\nAt the Commission, we are involved in many different services and events come in November. To get an idea of what we do and how we do it, check out our remembrance roundup detailing 2021’s activity.\n\nRAF Remembrance poppy\n\nImage: Poppies are a powerful remembrance symbol (Unsplash)\n\nGo anywhere in the UK during November and you’ll see little red flowers pinned to many people’s chests. This is the poppy, one of the nation's strongest symbols of remembrance.\n\nWhy poppies? They were chosen as the flowers grow over what were once the killing fields of Flanders in Belgium.\n\nThe pretty red petals bloom each year, acting as a peaceful alternative to the mud, blood, and fire of yesteryear.\n\nThe poppy appeal was first organised in 1921 by the Royal British Legion. Proceeds from the sale of each poppy badge go towards supporting veterans, so if you’re in the UK in November and want to do some of your own commemorations, pick one up.\n\nPoppies are incorporated into the remembrance of RAF personnel.\n\nRAF stories of the fallen\n\nCaptain Albert Ball VC\n\nI mage: Captain Albert Ball in front of the many aircraft he flew (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nIt seems almost inevitable that Albert Ball would become a pilot.\n\nIn his youth in Nottingham, UK, where he was born in 1896, Albert would while away the hours in a small shed on his family’s property, tinkering with engines and electrical equipment.\n\nSpeed thrilled Albert. He was a keen cyclist but that would satiate his need for velocity.\n\nWhen he volunteered in 1914 following the outbreak of World War One, Albert was assigned to the Sherwood Foresters. He was desperate to get assigned to the North Midland Bicycle Division but even then, this wouldn’t be enough.\n\nBy 1915, Ball had started taking private flying lessons. He achieved his Royal Aero Club Certificate and requested a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps.\n\nHis early start in the RFC saw him piloting reconnaissance aircraft. While in the skies, Albert shocked his colleagues by throwing his craft around with complete gusto, displaying an absolute lack of fear.\n\nAlbert would also tweak and fettle his craft to ensure maximum performance.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of commanders like Kiwi Captain Cooper, the young Albert quickly graduated away from reconnaissance and become a fully-fledged fighter pilot of 56th Squadron RFC.\n\nBehind the controls of aircraft like the temperamental French Nieuport fighters, Albert would become the highest-scoring British ace of World War One.\n\nAn ace is a fighter pilot with five or more confirmed kills. In his time as a fighter pilot, he shot down 43 enemy planes and even used rockets to take down an Imperial German balloon.\n\nThe Nieuport fighters Albert flew were known to be tricky planes to pilot and somewhat unpredictable. Albert seems to have had complete mastery of his craft. Coupled with his love for speed and incredible courage, Albert was able to dominate the skies for over two years. It’s thought his actions helped the RFC achieve aerial superiority during the Battle of the Somme.\n\nOn May 11th, 1917, Albert and 56th Squadron encountered enemy aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte over Douai, France. A furious dogfight ensued: a deadly aerial dance of machine gun fire, tight manoeuvring, and rapid machine gun fire.\n\nAfter fighting a running battle with visibility deteriorating, Albert’s plane tumbled from the sky alongside a German fighter piloted by Lothar von Richtofen, nephew of the feared Red Baron.\n\nAlbert was killed on impact while von Richtofen, whose plane also fell to earth, survived.\n\nThere has been some debate as to whether von Richtofen was responsible for shooting Albert down. Fighter aces were important propaganda tools as much as they were soldiers, so von Richthofen’s claims could simply be for appearances. We will probably never know the truth.\n\nAlbert was buried behind what were then enemy lines. His grave was discovered in later Allied pushes up the Western Front in the Great War’s closing stages. Instead of being transferred to CWGC purpose-built cemeteries, Albert’s father elected to let Albert lay where he was buried.\n\nYou can find Captain Albert Ball’s grave in Annoeullin Communal Cemetery.\n\nFor his considerable skill at arms and his huge tally of victories, Albert earned the Victoria Cross Distinguished Service Order and two bars, the Legion d’Honneur and Russian Order of St. George 4th Class.\n\nFirst Officer Amy V. Johnson\n\nImage: Amy V. Johnson (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nWe need to remember the sacrifices women made when considering RAF remembrance.\n\nWhile women pilots were not allowed to serve in combat roles, a great deal many served in the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA).\n\nThe ATA’s job was to ferry new, damaged, and repaired aircraft from factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, maintenance units, scrapyards, and active service squadrons and airfields.\n\nOne such pilot was First Officer Amy Johnson.\n\nAmy Johnson had a remarkable pre-war flying career. As a sort of British equivalent to famous American aviator Amelia Earhart, Amy had broken many barriers for female pilots.\n\nIn 1930, Amy became the first women to fly solo from Britain to Australia aboard her plane Jason. Her list of firsts grew from there.\n\nIn 1931, with partner Jack Humphries, she became one of the first people to fly from Britain to Moscow in one day, covering the 1,760-mile distance in 21 hours.\n\nAmy married Scottish pilot Jim Mollison in 1932. Shortly after, she beat her husband’s solo flying record from London to Cape Town. Together, the pair flew across the Atlantic to New York in 1933. In 1934, the Mollisons reached India from London in record time too.\n\nAmy also beat her own London-Cape Town record in 1936.\n\nWith such a storied pre-war career, it’s little wonder Amy Johnson joined the ATA in 1940. Her husband Jim would serve in the Air Transport Auxiliary too during World War Two.\n\nUnfortunately for Amy, it would not all be smooth flying during this time.\n\nOn 5th January 1941, Amy was ferrying an Airspeed Oxford aircraft from RAF Squires Gate in Prestwick, Scotland to RAF Kidlington near Oxford in Southern England.\n\nPoor weather conditions affected the flight. Amy’s craft began to run low on fuel and she bailed out near the Thames Estuary near Herne Bay on the southeast coast.\n\nA convoy of wartime vessels in the Thames Estuary spotted Johnson's parachute coming down and saw her alive in the water, calling for help.\n\nConditions were poor. The sea was heavy, the tide strong, with snow falling. The water and weather were bitterly cold. The captain of one of the vessels that spotted Amy, Lieutenant Commander Walter Fletcher of the HMS Haslemere, moved his ship in close to attempt a rescue.\n\nRopes were thrown to Johnson, but she was pulled under the ship and never seen again. Amy's watertight flying bag, her logbook and chequebook later washed up and were recovered near the crash site.\n\nAs no body was found, Amy is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial.\n\nSeveral witnesses believed there was a second body in the water. Fletcher dived in and swam out to the body, rested on it for a few minutes then let go. A lifeboat was dispatched to grab the Lt Cdr. When it reached Fletcher, he was unconscious, eventually dying in hospital several days later. For his attempted rescue ahead of his own personal safety, Fletcher was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal in May 1941.\n\nLieutenant Commander Walter Fletcher is buried at Gillingham (Woodlands) Cemetery in Kent.\n\nSergeant Leslie Francis Gilkes"
