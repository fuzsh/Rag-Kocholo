Serve here.\n\nFor over 200 years, the District of Columbia National Guard has held the vital responsibility ​​of protecting the Nation's Capital. Through times of peace and times of war, the D.C. National Guard has honored its commitments to the nation and the District of Columbia. The D.C. National Guard has been there from the fields of France and the beaches of Normandy, to the skies above D.C. on 9/11, and is still there, ready and vigilant. Service in the D.C. National Guard is part of a long tradition of dedication, bravery and valor. Our Guardsmen are connected to these Soldiers and Airmen of the past not just through the flags they carry or the patches they wear, but through their commitment to serve their community. Day-in and day-out D.C. National Guardsmen are writing the new history of the D.C. National Guard. Their daily dedication and commitment to facing any challenge our nation demands will fill the pages of history like the pages contain within.\n\nLearn the history of the Capital Guardians--Protecting the Capital and Defending the Nation Since 1802 by exploring the history section of the D.C. National Guard website or visit the online D.C. Capital Guardian Museum.\n\nWant to view history first hand? Visit the museum in person at 2001 East Capital Street, Southeast, Washington, D.C. 20003.\n\nThe war of 1812 would produce an American treasure and one of the most famous Veterans of the D.C. National Guard: Francis Scott Key. Francis Scott Key was a Lieutenant with the Georgetown Artillery during the War of 1812. During the British bombardment of Baltimore Harbor, he asked and was allowed to be sent to Maryland to negotiate a prisoner exchange. After the negotiations, the ship’s commander felt he had seen too much and needed to stay on the ship through the rest of the attack. As he watched the flag fly above Fort McHenry, he wrote the poem that is now the lyrics to The Star-Spangled Banner—our national anthem.​​​ ​​​​\n\nThe D.C. Commanding General is the senior military officer and commander of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Act of 1871 placed a governor at the head of the District of Columbia and the D.C. Militia, and from 1871 to 1887, there was no Commanding General. In 1887, the position of governor was eliminated and the Commissioner from the government was established with five appointed commissioners and the positioI of Commanding General returned.\n\nAs of today, there have been 23 Commanding Generals of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nRank Name Appointment Date of Relief Brig. Gen. John Mason Jun. 28, 1802 1811 Maj. Gen. John Peter Van Ness 1811 1814 Vacant 1814 1827 Maj. Gen. Walter Smith 1827 1829 Maj. Gen.

McCandless April 2021 Present\n\nFor a brief time, there was an armory on the National Mall where the National Archives building now stands. This building was taken over to be used as a hospital during the Civil War. The D.C. National Guard rented spaces across the city for weekly drills throughout the 19th century. Some of these spaces included rooms above Central Market, The True Reformer Building on U Street N.W., in temporary buildings built for World War I war-workers on North Capitol Street and even the old National Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nMany felt that the D.C. Guard needed a permanent home, but the debate over how to fund such a building and where it would be built lingered for decades. During the 1930s, the fervor to build an Armory reached fever pitch. The D.C. National Guard armory came together after a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Land was donated by the department of the interior, and a plan was drawn up by the Works Progress Administration. The D.C. Armory was the largest building in the Department of Defense at the time it was built in 1943. During World War II, it housed the FBI fingerprinting bureau. The building has also held an important role in the community. Over time, there have been tractor pulls and horse competitions, circuses, car shows, boxing tournaments and Georgetown University has used the Armory for their basketball games.\n\nFrom 1904-1976, the D.C. National Guard operated a training post in Southeast D.C. known as Camp Simms. At one point the camp was 168 acres, stretching from Alabama Avenue S.E. to the district line and had firing ranges, maintenance shops, and even a swimming pool. With the birth of aviation, the D.C. National Guard established air fields at Bolling Field and later Andrews Field. These posts, now known as Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling and Joint Base Andrews, still host D.C. National Guard facilities and units. In 1980, the D.C. National Guard opened its Army aviation facility at Davison Army Airfield, D.C.’s first property on Fort Belvoir. Following the aviation facility was a new Regional Training Institute which opened on September 11, 2011. The newest D.C. National Guard property, a parcel of land from the District of Columbia’s Oak Hill reservation, in Laurel, Maryland, is the home of the Capital Guardian D.C. Youth ChalleNGe Academy.\n\nFrom 1898-1916 the citizen-Soldiers of the D.C. National Guard included citizen-Sailors in the Naval Battalion. In 1904, the USS Puritan was loaned to the D.C. Naval Militia. It would be the largest ship employed by the D.C. Naval Militia Battalion at 290-feet-long and armed with four 12-inch guns. The USS Puritan would serve with D.C. Militia until September 14, 1909. In 1915, the D.C. Naval Battalion established an aeronautical corps. The unit leveraged civilian experience to train aviators for the war overseas. All D.C. Militia ships were returned to active naval service during World War I, and the battalion never reformed afterward. However, D.C. law still allows for the battalion to be re-instituted.​​​\n\nHeadquarters, D.C. Naval Militia, on the banks of the Potomac River -- pre-WWI. USS Fern, D.C. Naval Militia.
