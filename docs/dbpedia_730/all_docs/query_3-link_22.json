Hub Zemke, the Commander of the 56th Fighter Group flying in Bomber Formation, ahead of the “Big Ships”, the fighters thus were able to deceive the enemy into mistaking them for the Bomber Force. The fighters fanned out in flights of four to encounter the enemy fighters forming up and speeding to intercept the “Bombers”. Rankin led his flight in an attack on 25 plus ME-109 aircraft causing the enemy formation to drop external fuel tanks and dive for the deck. Rankin had 2 kills during the encounter.\n\nA short time later, he and his Wing man were able to join up with the Group Commander, who was circling above 50 plus enemy fighters with 25 plus enemy fighters above, after providing cover for Colonel Zemke while he destroyed an ME-109; Rankin proceeded to destroy 3 more ME 109’s the last of which he shot off the tail of his Commander.

Welch\n\nMajor Billy Welch was born March 11, 1921 in Albany, Alabama, he grew up in various cities in the South east, mainly Georgia and Florida. He graduated from Leesburg High School in Leesburg, Florida in 1941, six months later the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and we were in World War II. I was fortunate enough to enter Aviation Cadet flight training in April 1942; preflight training at San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center August – October 1942; primary flight training October – December 1942 at Avenged Field Sweetwater, Texas. This was training ground and home to the “Fly Girls”, the Women’s Aviation Service Pilots (W.A.S.P.’S). They now have a museum dedicated to their loyal service. From January – March 1943, we were sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas which at that time was “West Point” of the era, which I considered it a great honor and privilege to be trained there. We were trained to fly PT-19’s and BT-14’s. Advanced flight training was accomplished at Mission, Texas where we flew AT-6’s; we graduated March 24, 1943 as single engine Fighter Pilots. This was truly my boyhood dream, to earn those “Silver Wings”!\n\nHe was trained at Langley Field in the P-47 (Republic) “THUNDERBOLT” , which was the largest fighter plane in the Army Air Corp at that time and was stationed at Andrews Air Force Base, (Camp Springs, MD at that time), where they protected our nation’s capitol, intercepting any unidentified aircraft approaching.\n\nThe 361st Fighter Group was sent overseas to Scotland, in 1943 and based at Bottisham in East Anglia, under the command of General Jimmy Doolittle. Major Welch was scheduled , by request, on every mission sent out, he flew 300 combat hours, participated in three major air battles and flew 3 patrol missions on\n\n“D” Day, June 6, 1944, completing that tour in late August 1944. He was selected to remain in England and became a P-51 (Mustang) Flight Instructor at Gox-Hill near Hull, England. In November 1944, he was sent home. December 1944 began the “Battle of the Bulge” during which he survived 83 combat missions. They were told to “get ready “to go to the Pacific where he was Flight Instructor in fighter aircraft for foreign students: Norwegians, Belgians, Danish and French, to fight in the Korean War. After his 8th Air Force World War II tour, he was assigned to Yuma, Arizona and flew the P-39, “Bell Air Cobra” and the P-63 “King Cobra”. He also flew these aircraft in Harlingen, Texas when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nThe wars ended and he was discharged as 1st Lieutenant in Reserves. Civilian life was dull after all his adventures, he tried several types of employment but nothing satisfied. Aviation was “his thing”. He re-enlisted in the Air Force in 1946 as Staff Sergeant; being newly married him and his wife was back “in service”. As an “enlisted man”, his career turned toward flight instructor of many kinds of military aircraft, even jets. His willingness and eagerness to learn new and different things earned him an excellent military career moving through all the ranks up to Major.\n\nMajor Welch, at the age of 43, retired from the Air Force in June, 1963. Moved back to Leesburg, Florida to sell sand, but instead he started flight instructing at the local airport and eventually operated a flight school for another 18 years.\n\nOctober 25, 2007, Major Welch was awarded, by the FAA, the Wright Brothers “Master Pilot” award.

He had a desire to fly from the time he was eight years old when his father took him to see the Thunderbirds at an air show in Greenville, South Carolina. He had his picture made with a fighter pilot and was captivated by the entire experience. He also took his first airplane flight to Washington, DC about that time and visited the Air and Space Museum. It was bout that time that he decided he wanted to be a pilot.\n\nHe joined the Civil Air Patrol when he was in the eighth grade and started taking flight lessons at the Asheville Airport. He actually learned to fly before he learned to drive. He attended Aviation Academy for two summers. After graduating from Erwin High School, he attended UNCC for two and a half years before entering the United States Army in 1995. He loved every minute of flight school and received his wings in October of 1996 at the age of 22. He obtained his multi-engine fixed-wing license in addition to his rotor license.

He was a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice defending the freedoms that many in our own country take for granted.” Steve and Allison Almason\n\n“This is a very touching story of a life lived well. The man knew his priorities and faced life with courage. I wish we were all that brave.” Matt Welch\n\nMitch was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery (Section 60, 8315) on Monday January 23, 2006, at his request, where he received the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Combat Action Badge and the Air Medal with V Device.\n\nDorothy Post Hoover\n\nMrs. Hoover was born in Asheville, North Carolina November 22, 1916; attended Lee Edwards High School, Biltmore Jr. College and Cecil’s Business College. She worked as a legal secretary, bookkeeper and Clerk in the NC General Assembly.\n\nShe was a licensed private pilot for a year and a half before completing her studies at the women’s auxiliary service pilot’s school at Avenger Field, Texas where she graduated as a flier with the ferry command, was accepted in the WASP program by Jacqueline Cochran in 1943, trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas in PT-19’s, BT-15’S, AT-6’S and AT-10’s.\n\nAfter graduation was assigned to South Plains Army Field, Lubbock, Texas as a tow pilot on Lockheed Lodestar C-60’s, to train military glider pilots.

While not permitted to fly in combat during World War II, the WASP’s opened the door for women in the next generation.\n\nShe is the wife of Captain Henry O. Hoover of Asheville, North Carolina who is stationed in the Hawaiian Islands with the Army.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Tarver Davidson\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nTarver Waddell Davidson was born May 1, 1922 in Swannanoa, North Caroline. He was the second son of Samuel Fred and Floy Waddell Davidson. He attended grammar school in Swannanoa and graduated high school at Warren Wilson, which was then a high school and junior college. He married Betty Curtis from Asheville in 1949, had two children, Richard and Betsy, residing in Skyland, NC. Richard lives in Skyland and Betsy in California. Betty died in September 2004 and Tarver died in February 2007.\n\nService information: Tarver Davidson was a co-pilot on a B-24 Liberator bomber, flying with the 8th Air Force in England. He was shot down over occupied France on his fourth mission and parachuted “into the arms of the German army. He sustained several shrapnel wounds to the leg and some of this was never removed. Tarver was a prisoner of the Third Reich for nine months, being held in prison camps in Frevent and Lille, France; Brussels, Belgium and finally in Frankfurt, Wetzlar and Obersol, Germany. The final camp, about 70 miles south of Berlin, number 174, he thought, was the camp where the tunnel had been dug (prior to his arrival) and was the actual one about which the movie “The Great Escape” was written.\n\nSince this was a military camp, he was not subjected to the harsh treatment given prisoners in the political camps. However, hunger was a very real problem and he gave Red Cross credit with saving them with the packages they provided frequently. Tarver stated that the German guards took some foods from the packages, but they were also near starvation. He reported playing a lot of Bridge and Chess and the camp had an amateur theatrical group and an orchestra, the instruments provided by the Red Cross. They also had basketball goals set up for games in good weather.\n\nThey were moved from this camp around Christmas, 1944; when the Russian forces were advancing, they walked through a sleet storm all night then were given shelter in a warm brick plant in Spremburg, then they were hauled to Nurenberg in box cars where they stayed for two – three months and watched while the railroad yard was being bombed several times, which was about two miles away. They left this camp walking, arrived at a camp near Munich where they were liberated by General Patton leading an armored column. The German guards heard that Patton was coming and fled their posts. The prisoners were left several days without food, when Patton arrived, they were fed, then had to walk to the coast to be shipped out. He returned to the states in the spring of 1945.\n\nHe spent a year as a civilian flight instructor and was recalled to active duty in September 1947. He spent two years with the Occupation Forces in Japan. He was transferred from the Air Force reserve to the Infantry National Guard in 1950, flying light planes and helicopters as an Army aviator for two years. His active duty stateside stations were all in California.\n\nAs a civilian, he was employed by the Kearfott Corp. and later an employee of E.A. Industries of Arden, where he traveled much of the USA and Europe, installing and repairing the machinery in automated brick plants.\n\nFirst Lieutenant William L. Griffin\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nFirst Lieutenant Griffin grew-up in North Asheville. He graduated from Lee H. Edwards High School and enrolled in NC State College. When the government lowered the age limit for Air Force pilot training, Bill and a close friend, Bernard Ferguson, decided to apply.\n\nDecember 7, 1941. His first orders sent him to Miami, Florida in January 1941, introducing him to Air Force actions and discipline and was sent to San Antonio, Texas three months later, for classification, where he classified for pilot training. This began at Harvey Parks, Sikeston, Missouri; he was the first pilot in his group to do a solo flight.\n\nThe basic training was in Winfield, KS; advanced training was at Blackland Field in Waco, Texas which was a school for twin engines. He received his wings in March 1944 and was sent to Columbia, South Carolina for A-20 training. That wasn’t meant to be! The very maneuverable low-level one pilot plane was being de-emphasized in combat in favor of the larger B-25. He learned later that the B-25’s had a longer range, could carry more fire power and a bigger bomb load. It required two pilots, these planes were often flying nine abreast, doing evasive action and skimming tree tops and ground as they strafed the targets. Their crews consisted of two pilots, a navigator, an engineer, a radio man and a tail gunner.\n\nHe expected to be trained on the A-20’s but was assigned in Greenville, SC to co-pilot B-25, which replaced the A-20’s. He had no bomber experience until this time. He would learn the plane and fly missions before he checked out as First Pilot. His pilot was well trained and competent for their tasks and they had a really great crew.\n\nThey flew together for about 3 months and were sent to Savannah, Georgia to fly a new B-25 to Sacramento, California to be modified for their long journey. All guns were removed and the glass nose was replaced with a solid one which was designed to hold eight fifty caliber machine guns. A bomb bay, extra gas tanks and another gas tank in the radio compartment were installed. When this was completed, they loaded their gear and started their journey to, Hawaii, Christmas Island, Canton Island, Fiji Islands, New Caladonia and finally to Townsville, Australia. This was an awesome journey for two twenty year old pilots and a twenty-one year old navigator.\n\nHe was in New Guinea briefly when he was assigned to the 405th Squadron, 38th Bomb Group, and 5th Air Force.\n\nHe flew 50 missions out of Biak, Morotai and Luzon, the most northern island of the Philippines.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Edward F.

Retired to North Carolina in 1986.\n\nLt. Logan is a member of Retired Pilots’ Association, Reserve Officers Association, Air Force Association, Carolina Mountain Club, American Legion and The Air Forces Escape and Evasion Society.\n\nLieutenant Coman W. Rothrock, Jr.\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nLieutenant Coman W. Rothrock, Jr. is a native of Asheville, North Carolina and graduated from Lee Edwards High School class of 1939. He also received student pilot instruction at the old Asheville-Hendersonville Airport under the tutelage of Paul McMurray.\n\nHe was a student at the University of North Carolina, 1939-1942; during these years he was active in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. He left the university in 1942, his junior year, for Aviation Cadet Training in the Army Air Corps.\n\nActive duty assignments from 1942-1945 included: the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics; the First Bomb Squadron; Ninth Bomb Squadron; the 1159th School Squadron; the 903rd Base Unit and the 452nd Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force in Europe. It was at the 903rd Base Unit in Pinecastle Army Air Field, Florida that Lt. Rothrock conducted extensive equipment testing, stall testing for the Boeing Company on Boeing, Douglas and Vega built B-17G’s, and performed the first zero-zero (meaning zero visibility and a zero ceiling or not being able to see beyond the windshield of the aircraft), weather take-offs and landings in a fully loaded B-17G Bomber. By the end of two years their unit had completed 159 projects.\n\nLt. Rothrock started making instrument approaches with a radar blind approach system in July 1944. The major in charge got the basic idea while in Italy when he was tracking a B-24 that crashed into a mountain. He devised some plastic grids with circles and a runway line. The major could tell Lt. Rothrock how high he should be as he crossed each circle but he could not tell the altitude. This was the forerunner of ground controlled approach. The project was interrupted when he was sent to Elgin Field to check out in a B-29, he flew it back to Pinecastle, the airplane was transferred to the B-24 Squadron and Lt. Rothrock resumed test work. In November 1944, his duties were flight leader, assistant operations officer and squadron instrument check pilot and then he was named the squadron project officer and test pilot for an “All Weather” project reporting to Colonel Earl Tash who was wing project officer on the Air Forces Board. The objective was to devise a system whereby they could take off, fly to a target, drop their bombs return to base and land… all on instrument. Through much experimenting and research, Lt. Rothrock being a major contributor, successfully completed two zero-zero landings on January 22, 1945.\n\nHis formal education was completed in 1946 at the University of Florida where he received a degree in chemical engineering. While working in paper manufacturing he contributed many innovative ideas and procedures now used by the paper industry.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Paul Summey\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nLieutenant Colonel Paul Summey Was born in Forest City, North Carolina on August 1, 1919 and lived there until attending Appalachian State Teacher’s College in 1940.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, he left college for active duty in the Army Air Corp. He and Juanita were married in 1941. She joined the WACCs.\n\nHe became a B-24 pilot during World War II, based at Hethel Field in Norwich, England, flying bombing missions into Germany and France. He was severely wounded over St. Lo, France in 1944, but recovered in England and flew the rest of his missions at Hethel Field.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Summey left active duty after the war, remaining current by flying in the Reserves at Dobbins Air Field in Georgia. In 1952, he became active again joining the relatively new Strategic Air Command, flying B-47’s at Hunter Air Force Base in Savannah, Georgia and later flying B-52’s out of Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi. He entered Tactical Air Command in 1967, flying C-130’s into Vietnam from his home base at CCK in Taipei, Taiwan. He flew support for the US Marines at the battle of Khe Sahn during the Tet Offensive in 1968. He retired as a squadron commander at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina.\n\nHis awards include the Distinguished Flying Cross; the Air Medal (2 Oak Leaf Cluster; a Purple Heart and numerous unit and service citations and commendation medals.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Paul Summey and Juanita had one son, Paul II of Asheville, North Carolina; two grandchildren, Heather and Paul III (Tripp). They celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary in August of 2010.\n\nHe passed away at the VA Community Living Center in Asheville, North Carolina on December 5th, 2010.\n\nLieutenant Robert P. Weaver\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nLieutenant Robert Weaver was born in Asheville, North Carolina August 29, 1918, to Marvin and Minnie Weaver.\n\nHe was born to fly! His ability to fly was only exceeded by his ability to serve as a loving husband to his wife, Margaret Bibb Weaver and as an adored father to his five children.\n\nFrom his first victory in a model airplane contest on November 11, 1939 at Asheville Memorial Airport until the time he almost had to land on an Interstate highway near Rockwood, Tennessee some forty years later ( he confessed to his son who was a passenger in the plane with him at that time …”Today I was scared for the first time, it’s time to hang-up my wings.”\n\nHe attended Asheville Schools and two years at Brevard College.\n\nHe was employed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority at the Asheville-Henderson Airport. Duties included the control and direction of civilian and military flight operations at the airport.\n\nLt. Weaver joined the Army Air Corp and World War II; training at Curtis Wright Technical School in August-September of 1942 in Glendale, California; Mather Field, October 1942 through April 1943, in Sacramento, California and instructor school, May – June 1943 at Randolph Field, Texas.\n\nHe was then assigned Fighter Pilot to the 94th Fighter Squadron (Hat –In-The-Ring) and flew 50 missions as a P-38 Fighter Pilot into Germany based out of Foggia, Italy and surrounding bases.\n\nHe completed 17,000 plus flight hours.\n\nHe was awarded EAME Ribbon three Battle Stars; AT Ribbon Victory Medal World War II and Lapel Button issued ASRS.\n\nAfter the war, Lt. Weaver continued his love for flying by serving as a civilian flight instructor at Spence Airbase in Moultrie, Georgia; Fort Rucker, Alabama; Fort Stewart, Georgia and finally retired as a GS-13 Instructor Pilot on the Singer Link Trainer at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nCaptain Clair E. Wyrick\n\nArmy Air Corps\n\nI enlisted as an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps in April 1942 and was called to active duty November 1942. My initial training started with classification at Nashville, Tennessee, continuing through pre-flight at Maxwell Field at Montgomery, Alabama and on to primary flight training at Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I then went to basic training at Malden, Missouri with the final flight training in twin engine AT-10’s at Seymour, Indiana and upon graduation, as a 2nd Lieutenant, I was now a confirmed pilot.\n\nHaving earlier requested duty as a bomber pilot, I was sent to B-17 transition training at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois, followed by tactical training as a command pilot with crew at Avon Park, Florida, where the crew was trained together. We completed this in March of 1944 and were shipped overseas via the Queen Elizabeth, ending up with the 95th Bomb Group at Horham in Southeast England.\n\nIt was now April 1944, after a short familiarization with the local area we were sent on our first combat mission on April 26. After many more missions (35) including “D” Day, June 6, 1944, Big “B” (Berlin) and others, my crew and I completed our tour of duty on August 4, 1944. During our tour we each received the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters and the Distinguished Flying Cross. One crew member received the Purple Heart for an injury. We were extremely fortunate to finish the action as a complete original crew with no serious wounds; however we did go through several aircraft as a result of combat damage. We split up and returned to the United States. My duties for the remainder of the war were as a B-17 command pilot giving training to radar navigators and bombardiers in sunny Florida.\n\nIn April 1945, the war in Europe was nearly won and I was allowed to be discharged from the Air Force as a First Lieutenant.\n\nI started flying with Eastern Airlines, Inc. in July 1945. I flew as a co-pilot for the first 10 years in DC 3’s, 4’s and Constellations. I was promoted to Captain in June 1955 and flew out of New York airports in DC 3’s, 4’s, 6’s and 7’s, the Constellations, Martin 404 and Convair 440’s. I was, for a short time, current and qualified in all of these aircrafts simultaneously. I moved back to Miami in 1958 and flew scheduled trips until 1964 when I became an instructor in the training department, instructing new hires and pilot upgrades in DC 7’s. Eastern was buying 727’s, so I moved to that and again was instructing new and upgrade pilots.\n\nI worked in the training department as a manager of flying and Training Director, from 1965 until my retirement in 1977, in this capacity; we were allowed to return to line flying every 4th month to keep familiar with this phase.\n\nSince retirement, my flying has been limited to private airplanes. I owned a Cessna 310 and a Cessna 182 which I flew some charter flights out of Macon County until 1991, I decided to hang it up and I haven’t flown since. However, I do miss it.\n\nIn closing, I have been an extremely fortunate individual to have first, survived combat in the war with no injuries and second, to have worked at an occupation that was thoroughly enjoyable and received good pay for it. What better life can you expect?\n\nMajor Fred W. Glover\n\nArmy Air Forces\n\nMajor Glover was born on December 4, 1915 in Asheville, NC. He was a professional baseball player before World War II. When the war came he went to Canada and received his pilot training with RCAF.\n\nMajor Glover was sent to England but was assigned duty as a ferry pilot rather than a fighter squadron. He was transferred to the US Army Forces May 26th, 1943, as a flight officer and was assigned to the 336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Group, based at Debden.\n\nCredited with a “probable” when he shot up a long-nosed Focke-Wulf 190D on a mission to Berlin on March 6th, 1944. His first confirmed victories came on March 16th, 1944 when he destroyed two ME-110’s near Munich; March 29th, he shot down a FW-190 over Brunswick; and minutes later shared in the destruction of a HE-111 bomber with Major George Carpenter and First Lieutenant John Godfrey; April 8th, another FW-190 fell to his guns and on August 5th, newly promoted First Lieutenant Glover became as ace when he downed an ME-109 over Germany, in that same month he was given command of the 336th Fighter Squadron.\n\nMajor Glover was leading a bomber escort to Merseberg, Germany when he encountered an ME-163 rocket fighter east of Liepzig and shot it down on November 4, 1944. The group went back to Merseberg on November 21 and Glover shot down three ME-109’s in the vicinity of Dummer Lake and was promoted to Major on December 22, 1944.

He enlisted as private/aviation cadet on March 12, 1942; too pre-flight training at Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama; primary flying at Helena, Arkansas; basic at Gunter Field, Montgomery and advanced at Marianna, Florida.\n\nHe was commissioned second lieutenant military aviator on January 12, 1943, in Miranna, assigned at 52nd Ferry Group Air Transport Command, Long Beach, California and flew various types of aircraft all over the world. Reassigned to Second Air Force in December of 1943 to a crew in Salt Lake City, took phase training in B-17’s at Sioux City, IA; assigned 379th Bomb Group, Kimbolton, England and flew first combat mission on June 9, 1944.\n\nCaptain Moore finished 34 mission-tours and returned to the United States in October, 1944, was assigned to Lockbourne AFB as B-17 instructor pilot, November 1944. He was reassigned 2nd Search and Rescue Squadron, Kessler Field, Florida as an instrument flying instructor; reassigned to Air Transport Command at Memphis Army Air Base, Memphis Tennessee, separated from service at Scott Field, E. St. Louis, in 1946 with rank of captain, enrolled in Ohio State University and got his first newspaper job.\n\nHe was recalled to active service in the Korean Conflict in 1949 and was assigned as air freight officer at Hickam Air Force Base, Honolulu, Hawaii, later becoming executive office of traffic squadron.\n\nHe became a civilian again in 1952 and went straight back to the newspaper in Columbus, Ohio where he had made a start “between the wars”. He became city editor of the Columbus Citizen Journal, remained there until 1965 when he was appointed assistant director and later director of a civic organization called The Development Committee for Greater Columbus, sort of like a Chamber of Commerce but much more oriented toward planning for orderly growth of the community. Captain Moore became director of news media relations for Nationwide Insurance Corp. in 1969, left Columbus (home office) in 1974 to become city editor of Asheville Citizens-Times, during that time he helped organize and set –up the Mountain Area Hospice. He started a long term relationship with Blue Ridge Mental Health Association and served as chairman for a number of years.\n\nCaptain Moore was a member of the Asheville Regional Airport Commission for several years, which was a sort of labor of love. He served as a board member of Quality Forward, United Appeal and was elected to Asheville City Council in 1989, served as vice mayor for a two-year term, was re-elected in 1991 and retired after four years in office. He became part time at the Citizen Times in 1987 and writes a few editorials and features for the newspaper and for This Week magazine.\n\nHe is still fascinated by aviation and would like to get another term on the Airport Commission.\n\nColonel Robert Morgan\n\nArmy Air Forces\n\nColonel Robert Morgan was born on July 31, 1920, in Asheville, North Carolina and grew up during the Great Depression. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a business degree just before joining the Army Air Corps in December 1940.\n\nRobert K. Morgan commanded one of the Army Air Force’s most famous heavy bombers during World War II. Many crew later completed 25 combat sorties, Morgan and the other nine men of the “Memphis Belle were the first to reach that goal as a crew. Upon receiving his commission and wings, he went on to train in the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. He crossed the Atlantic in October 1942 in a B-17, Memphis Belle” and was assigned to the 324th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) at Bassingbourn, England. By the fall of 1942, combat leaders such as Curtis LeMay had refined bombardment doctrine and developed the “combat box” formation which Morgan would later fly over Germany.\n\nHis first missions were flown against targets in occupied France and the Low Countries, but in early 1943, the B-17’s were launched against the enemy’s homeland. As the Americans pushed deeper over the Reich, the outdistanced allied fighter cover and losses mounted. The bomber crews’ morale plummeted; rotation was set at 25 missions, but seemed an impossible goal.\n\nColonel Morgan and his crew neared rotation, the story of the aircraft became well known. He returned home to a hero’s welcome; he had survived. He took command of the 869th Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy), (after a three month publicity tour of the United States in 1943), which was equipped with the Boeing B-29 Super Fortress in the summer of 1944. November 24, 1944, he led the first B-29 raid over Tokyo from Twentieth Air Force’s hard-won base on Saipan in the Marianas. He completed another 25 combat missions before returning home in May 1945. Morgan left active duty in September 1945, but continued serving in the Reserves.\n\nHe returned to North Carolina and joined his father’s furniture manufacturing business and later formed a Volkswagen dealership. He retired from the Air Force Reserve in 1965 as a colonel and with his wife, Linda, they live in Asheville.\n\nSETTING: In May 1943, Captain Robert Morgan and the crew of the “Memphis Belle” neared completion of their combat tour. The Army Air Force saw an opportunity to publicize this milestone and invited Hollywood film director William Wyler to document their final mission. Wyler flew on the May 17 mission and then put together a superb color film that dramatically brought the impact of the air war over Germany home to America. This mission came to life again in 1991 when Catherine Wyler coproduced a feature film based on her father’s work.\n\nLieutenant Woodville Grady Rozzell\n\nArmy Air Forces\n\nLieutenant Grady Rozzell was born August 26, 1923 in White County, Tennessee. He joined the Reserves on July 7, 1942, was accepted to the AAFCC in Nashville, Tennessee on February 4, 1943 and started Preflight training at Maxwell Field, Alabama in March of 1943. Flight training for Grady started with Primary at Dorr Field, Florida in April and May of 1943; basic at Bainbridge, Georgia in June and July of 1943, then advanced training at Moody Field, Georgia before taking B-17 transition at Hendricks Field, Florida from October 13 until January 20, 1944.\n\nHe joined the 8th AFRD in England on May 10th of 1944 and did not have to wait long before seeing combat. He was assigned to the 401st bomb Group 8th Air Force and flew out of Deenethorpe Air Force Base in Kettering, England. Lt.

Rozzell, the pilot for “Rosie’s Sweat Box”, a B-17 Bomber. On one occasion, 151 holes were found in the fuselage and were patched. After 12 missions, “Rosie” was in for repair, the flying fortress exploded and disintegrated while being tested by a substitute crew following the repairs. The entire substitute crew was killed. The cause of the explosion was unknown, it happened about 60 feet above the ground.\n\nOne of the many events he participated in and recorded was D-Day. The night before D-Day, Rozzell wrote in his diary: “The barracks is wild with excitement and suspense. Everyone just knows this is the invasion.” “I’m glad it’s finally arrived” he wrote of D-Day and the invasion. “There’s going to be many good men killed today. Blessings on them.”\n\nIn recognition of his service during this period of time, Lt, Rozzell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with three Oak Leaf Clusters, American Theater Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Theater Medal with three Bronze Stars for Air Offensive in Europe, Western Europe and Northern France Campaigns.\n\nOn August 15, 1944, he left England and World War II combat. After his enlistment was up he returned to Chattanooga, Tennessee area where his mechanical skills and some college work got him into the maintenance engineering aspect of the textile industry.\n\nHe moved to Swannanoa in 1962 to serve as plant engineer to the Beacon Manufacturing facility and has remained in the area.\n\nHe has an active interest in the community serving many terms with the Volunteer Fire Department and one term on the Buncombe County School Board.\n\nHe has taught Sunday School for the last 30 years at the First Baptist Church of Black Mountain where he has also served as deacon.\n\nCaptain Robert W.

To further his desire for flying, he applied for Naval Aviation Training. Due to an overflow of applicants for training, he was placed on hold.\n\nWhile waiting for that special call, he learned of and applied to Naval Air Station (NAS) Atlanta in Chamblee, Georgia which was a Navy facility that had aircraft. The NAS had offered him the rank of Airman Recruit and was assigned to an aircraft maintenance line where he learned to wash, fuel, and repair aircraft.\n\nThe call he was waiting for finally came in August 1950 and was sent to Pensacola, Florida to begin his flight training. Robert spent a good year and a half in Pensacola flying SNJ’s and learning various specialties of flight such as formation flight, gunnery, bombing, night flying, aeronautics, cross-country navigation, and carrier landings on the USS Monterey during the stages of his Preflight and Primary flight training. Robert was then sent to complete his Intermediate flight training in Corpus Christi, Texas where he was placed in a squadron of AD’s (Skyraiders) learning dog-fighting, bombing, and firing aerial guns and rockets. He was later sent back to Pensacola to complete All-Weather training in twin-engine Beechcraft SNB’s. Robert graduated from flight training in April 1953 and elected to go into the Marines and was sent back to Corpus Christi where he married Sue. As the Korean War began to rise, he was assigned to the Second Marine Air Wing in Cherry Point, North Carolina and placed in the VMA-211 squadron flying AD’s. Later, his squadron was relocated to a re-opened air base in Edenton, North Carolina to practice carrier landings.\n\nFollowing his carrier training, the Navy ordered his squadron to Asia where he would eventually board the CVL Wright, sister ship of the Monterey, for his Port of Call at a Naval base in Yokosuka. After the Korean War had ended, Robert returned to Edenton where he finished his tour and was discharged from the Marines in July 1955.\n\nRobert decided to continue on with his desire for aircraft and enrolled in NC State where he earned his degree in engineering and excelled in the design of electronic equipment for both military and commercial aircraft.\n\nLt.

He was a seventeen year old freshman at Yale University when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe was called up for active duty as a Naval Aviation Cadet in March of 1943, as were fifty other Yale men, and began his physical conditioning for flight training at North Carolina Pre-Flight School in Chapel Hill. He honed his basic skills at Olathe, Kansas and Pensacola, Florida. There he was awarded his Naval Aviator’s Wings and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nHe was introduced to combat aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station in Edenton, North Carolina where he flew the B-25 bomber which in Navy nomenclature was the PBJ. Following officer operational flight training, he was assigned to Marine Bomber Squadron VMB-621 at Cherry Point, North Carolina where he became exceedingly well trained with a total of 750 hours of flight time before shipping overseas to the South Pacific. A total of fifteen months of Kirk’s two years of training for combat was in the state of North Carolina.\n\nFollowing a nineteen day troop transport boat trip, he was based on the island of Emirau located one degree south of the equator in the Bismarck Archipelago. He experienced five missions over Rabaul for the Headquarters Squadron of Marine Air Group 61 of the First Marine Air Wing.\n\nKirk was extremely grateful that President Truman authorized the atomic bomb which brought an end to the war. He was to learn later while flying from a base in the Philippines that his Air Group anticipated eighty per cent losses during the invasion of Japan.

Symmes married Gay Burnett, a graduate of Northwestern University, of Texas. Together they are the proud parents of three children, Sarah, Martha and Will; eight grandchildren.\n\nHistory of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II by Robert Sherrod notes:\n\n“The most significant innovation in South Pacific aviation in 1944 was the arrival in March of what were, for the Marines, big planes with six-man crews…there seems to have been no special reason for the Marines to have PBJ’s (B-25’s) except that the Army was overstocked by several hundred planes and the Marines would try anything. They were used to being given whatever tools the Army or Navy were tired of or had in surplus.”\n\nCaptain Forrester C. Auman\n\nCaptain Forrester C.
