        "text": "1917-1939: Aviation comes to Ohio State\n\nThe Ohio State University has played an integral part in advancing the aeronautics field, while evolving into one of the nation’s premier aviation programs. Less than 14 years after the first flight, World War I created the need for qualified military pilots. In spring 1917, the War Department established Schools of Military Aeronautics at six universities, including The Ohio State University.\n\nThe School of Aeronautics opened May 21, 1917, when the first \"squadron\" or group of 16 cadets reported. As the story goes, the cadets built the aircraft in the aeronautics building, located on the southeast corner of West 19th Avenue and Neil Avenue. The planes would then be rolled down the hill to the field just east of the Olentangy River, where flight tests and training would ensue.\n\nUnfortunately, this arrangement was short-lived, with the opening of Ohio Stadium in 1922. Shortly thereafter, the university built a second airport on East Broad Street “near the country club,” while also using other local airports such as Sullivant Field on Neil Avenue. In 1939, Ohio State was one of a number of universities that took part in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, sponsored by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, for the purpose of fostering private flying\n\n1942-1949: Birth of an airport\n\nIn support of its pilot training program, the university, in May 1942, purchased property for the development of an airport. The new facility was located on the outskirts of town, seven miles north of campus in northwest Columbus. The first plane to utilize the new airport landed at the field on November 5, 1942. What followed was the construction of the airport's first two buildings in the spring of 1943, and two 2,200 feet, hard-surfaced runways, taxiways, and aprons in early 1944.\n\nFour Columbus women pilots formed a chapter of the Ninety-Nines organization in 1946. '99' was founded by Amelia Earheart, named after the 99 women pilots who attended the first meeting in 1926. In the photo on the far left is Helen Linn, assistant coordinator of pilot training at KOSU in 1946. For more info about this organization, visit the All-Ohio 99s website.\n\nRuth Gouthey (photo on the right and the second from the right in the photo above) was Ohio State's first female flight instructor, pictured here with a student in 1947. Gouthey also helped form the first Columbus chapter of the 99s. Ohio State began offering flight instruction in 1945.\n\n1950s-1959: Growth in flight training\n\nIn 1952, lab fees and ground school for a private pilot’s license totaled $530. By 1956, school enrollment was at capacity with 29 students and the fleet consisted of four Cessna 140s and four Navions.\n\nBeginning in the late 1940s and continuing into the 1950s, the airport partnered with the farming community to research equipment for crop dusting. Charles W. Kellenbarger, aircraft maintenance supervisor at Ohio State Airport, worked on the Ohio Project. This was “an airplane developed by the Ohio Flying Farmers Association, The Ohio State University, Civil Aeronautics Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and others, for use in spraying and dusting farm crops.\" A modified version of the Piper J-3, the airplane was built to take off from and land on short farm fields. (Science and Mechanics, 8/1956) However, the plane crashed in 1957 and the project was halted.\n\nJack Eggspuehler was named director of the School of Aviation at Ohio State in 1958 when he was 28 years old. He was head of aviation until he retired in 1978. Part of his responsibilities included serving as airport director.\n\n1960-1969: Ohio State Enters the Jet Age\n\nIn 1967, the crew of a TWA 707 mistook the airport for Port Columbus International Airport. After shuttling all passengers and baggage to Port Columbus, and removing all galley equipment and seats, the plane was light enough to depart for the larger facility across town. Watch the 707 take-off below.\n\nThese Beech Musketeers are pictured at the Beech Aircraft Customer Delivery Center in Wichita, Kansas, in June 1969. The picture is courtesy of Myron Ashcraft, Ohio State University class of 1971.\n\nThe airport started its decades-long partnership with the NIFA by hosting their national competition in 1960. SAFECON (Safety in Flight Evaluation Conference) has been held at The Ohio State University Airport ten times.\n\nThe National Intercollegiate Flying Associations (NIFA) relocated its headquarters to The Ohio State University Airport in 2012.\n\n1970-1979: Growth in Research and Development\n\nIn the 1970s, the airport operated an air transportation service with two DC-3s. The service provided transportation for university sports teams, faculty and administration and served as a flying classroom.\n\nIn 1976, Dr. Gerald Gregorek, Ohio State Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, and Dr. Stacy Weislogel, Ohio State Aviation, worked with NASA and Beech Aircraft Corporation to test a new aircraft wing design at the OSU Airport. The Beechcraft Muskateer had the new wing built up over the conventional airfoil to find out if the design would improve economy, performance and efficiency of general aviation airplanes. (Columbus Dispatch, 2/29/1976)\n\nWright Airlines\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Administration granted a temporary permit for Wright Airlines of Cleveland to operate a weekday commuter service between Cleveland and Columbus in August of 1975. However, by October of that year, Ohio State University’s administration moved to evict Wright Airlines because there was no lease. Residents near the airport also objected to the increased air traffic. Eventually Wright moved their operations to Port Columbus. The university then clarified that it had no intention of “expanding ….use to the operation of regularly scheduled commercial airlines…”\n\n1980-1989: “Airport For Sale” and Community Support\n\nOfficials of Ohio State University discussed selling Don Scott Airport and the surrounding land in 1986. Ohio State President Edward H. Jennings called for a land use study to determine the feasibility of “disposing of the approximately 1,400 acres, valued at upwards of $100 million, and moving the agricultural and aviation programs elsewhere.”\n\nThe above cartoon depicts Ohio State President Edward Jennings as King Kong, taking over the airport with the intention of selling it to developers. Peggy McElroy was a member of the Northwest Civic Association. (Suburban News)\n\nThis discussion continued on and off for decades, with vigorous arguments offered from both sides. Developers were interested in discussing commercial and retail use of the property, as well as residential buildings. President Gee continued the discussion on selling the airport in the 2000’s.\n\n1978-1982: Richard D. Gilson chaired the Department of Aviation, director of the Ohio State Airport and director of the aviation psychology lab.\n\n1982-1990: Stacy Weislogel was Department of Aviation chair, and was airport director from 1982-1983.\n\n1990-1999: “A city within a city”\n\nKenneth Newstrom, airport director, 1992-1997\n\n“The airport is city within a city. We have our own police and fire department, There is a city-type atmosphere with tenants and users.\"\n\nStatistics from the time:\n\n140,000 take-offs and landings per year\n\n5th largest in state\n\nOne of the top 30 GA in country\n\n80 flight students per quarter\n\n2000-2009: Outreach and Community Activism\n\nAirport outreach programs were created in 2009 and currently serve over 2,000 students and adults each year. In addition, the airport provides shadowing opportunities for eligible local K-8 students interested in entering a collegiate aviation program. Outreach staff provide tours of the facility by school groups, scouts, and other individuals. The airport is the host site of the semi-annual Youth Aviation Adventure and Young Eagles airplane rides\n\nAirport Open House and Don Scott Trot: A 5K on the Runway\n\nThe Airport Open House was held in 2003, 2005, and 2007, and attracted thousands of visitors with hot air balloons, military fly-overs, static displays, free plane rides for kids, a 5K run, and more. This event was brought back in 2015 and 2016 with similar success.\n\nWOOSE\n\nA group of airport expansion opponents formed a group called WOOSE (We Oppose Ohio State Expansion), complete with a website. (Worthington ThisWeek, October 3, 2003) Airport supporters responded by pointing out that the airport has a $65 million economic impact and provides medical transportation services. The runway expansion would reduce the noise problem, improve safety and create more business opportunity to the region. (Worthington News, April 23, 2003)\n\n2010-present: The Ohio Aeronautics and Aviation Campus\n\nThe airport has evolved in the 75 years since its inception from a pure training facility to Ohio’s premier business aviation center, and is the primary facility serving The Ohio State University and the surrounding central Ohio general aviation community. Today, the airport serves as a general aviation reliever for Port Columbus International Airport. Its status as a Part 139 certificated airport assures the aviation community that the facility will meet the highest standards in terms of operations and maintenance.\n\nThe university airport is home to 200 aircraft, including, both single- and multi-, piston and turbine engine aircraft and rotorcraft, and sees an estimated 75,000 operations per year, including corporate activity, student training, and pleasure flying. The airport ranks fourth in Ohio in the number of take-offs and landings and within the top 100 general aviation airports nationally.\n\nThe airport has welcomed many dignitaries to Columbus, including former Presidents of the United States, First Ladies, celebrities and even manatees being transferred to/from the Columbus Zoo.\n\n2015: Austin E. Knowlton Foundation gives Ohio State $10M to enhance aviation, education and research facilities\n\nContinuing its namesake’s commitment to education and to his alma mater, the Austin E. Knowlton Foundation donated $10 million to upgrade aviation education and research facilities, and the terminal at The Ohio State University Airport.\n\n“This generous gift reinforces the university’s commitment to aviation education and research at Ohio State and to utilize Don Scott Field as it was originally intended — training pilots, advancing aviation innovation and serving the needs of a growing region,” said Dean David B. Williams of the College of Engineering.\n\n“Modernizing the facilities will allow us to keep pace with the educational needs of 500-plus Ohio State students, research demands of the state and nation, and service expectations of local businesses and pilots.”\n\n2017\n\nIn 2017, the airport celebrated its 75th anniversary, as well as the groundbreaking for a new flight education and terminal building.\n\nGus Custer\n\n1964-1981 Airport Maintenance Supervisor\n\n1981-1990 Airport Maintenance Manager\n\n1990-1996 Airport Assistant Director of Operations\n\nThe Ohio State University Society of Technicians Chair\n\nInternational Snow Symposium Research and Development Committee Member\n\nRichard “Gus” Custer worked at The Ohio State University Airport from 1964 until 1996. As head of airport maintenance, he was responsible for the upkeep of airport facilities and equipment.\n\nOne of the most notable things Gus was involved with at the airport was the construction of runway 9L/27R. Custer was responsible for constructing the original grass runway before 9L was paved. Along with this runway, he installed runway lights, taxiway lights, taxiway C, and helped build a fuel farm. The Ohio State Airport had the first runway GPS system and Automated Weather System; Custer helped construct these systems.\n\nOne of the larger airport projects was the brand new Air Traffic Control Tower.\n\nAlong with the airport maintenance staff, Gus helped build Hangar 7.\n\nWhen Custer wasn’t working on building taxiways and towers, he was maintaining airport buildings, roads, taxiways, and runways. All pavement markings were required to be repainted annually in order to meet FAA Part 150 compliance. Custer also witnessed the infamous TWA 707 landing that occurred at OSU Airport in 1967.\n\nAs our airport undergoes construction for the new terminal, it is important to remember its legacy and the hard work of all the employees who helped make the airport what it is today.\n\nMichael Fischer\n\nDuring one of The Memorial tournaments a Citation Air plane and crew were at the airport and just dropped some people and then they saw me and my two brothers. We were there watching all the jets bringing people into town for the tournament. The two pilots asked if we would want to go see the inside of the plane. So we did.\n\nMeredith Frederick\n\nAircraft Dispatcher\n\n2010: Aviation Engineering\n\nOne of my favorite memories from working at the airport happened on a snowy, slow day in the middle of winter. My coworker Cecilia and I had been talking for some time about how much fun it would be to have a go at driving one of the snowplows or snow brooms. This particular day saw driving snow, very low visibility, and consequently, no landing traffic. Mark and Dale, airport facilities veterans, were out in the elements treating the runways with the plows and brooms. Cecilia and I watched them go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and had more delusions of snowplow grandeur. Suddenly, the phone rang. We were being summoned to meet the snow equipment! We scrambled out and chose our respective rides. Cecilia paired up with Mark on the plow, and I paired up with Dale on the broom. Intimidated by all the buttons, levers, and Dale's side-eye, I listened closely to his introduction of how to work the broom. And off we went! Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Feeling pretty confident after a few passes, I had a go at running the blower and broom portion of the machine at the same time under Dale's watchful supervision.\n\nAfter a full pass of the taxiway, I was feeling good, until Dale told me to look behind me. All of the snow had blown right back over the taxiway, since my clever self didn't think to take the howling wind into account when directing the blower. Progress undone! That earned me significant more side-eye from Dale, and the advice to stick to airplanes and leave snow removal to the professionals.\n\nWe completed a few more pity passes to give me the chance to save face before Dale dropped me off at the terminal and I was reunited with Cecilia. Cecilia and I were all smiles and laughs after our snowplow lessons. My pride took a hit that day, but it was big fun and to this day I still smile when I see the brooms and plows working the runways.\n\nDoug Hammon\n\n1999 - 2019: The Ohio State University Airport Director\n\n1989: Aeronautical Sciences (SBS)\n\nIn late 1987 or early 1988, my instructor and I were waiting to taxi from the student ramp to go out to the practice area. We were held in place by ATC as the Beach Starship was on its way in for a demonstration to a local business. Before landing though, the aircraft rolled on its side and flew the length of the runway for all to see. Worth the few extra bucks I had to spend as the hobbs meter kept racking up minutes while we sat and enjoyed the show. The Starship never really caught on, but its successor, the Piaggio, was both designed and housed here at Don Scott.\n\nMargaret J Jewett\n\n1965 to December 1997: The Ohio State University Airport\n\nRetired assistant to the director of flight education\n\nI was blessed in being a part of OSU Aviation for about thirty years. I saw and remember many fine young people receive their pilot licenses and are now keeping you safe when flying our friendly skies. I have so many fond memories of all of you.\n\nTommy Smathers\n\nThe Ohio State University Airport Customer Service Manager\n\nSales & Operations Manager / AEG Fuels - Miami, FL\n\nAviation Management / College of Arts and Science\n\nI had the pleasure and privilege of working customer service at KOSU from Spring 2006 until January 2011. While attending Ohio State, these were by far the best and most memorable years I can remember! Sue Riggs (Customer Service Manager) gave me the best opportunity to learn and experience aviation first hand and I wouldn't have traded it for anything. I think about my time spent there often and wish only the best for the future of Don Scott Field! Not only does the airport serve as an excellent reliever and general aviation destination, it is among the very few educational establishments that give students, aspiring aviators and enthusiasts of all ages the best first-hand experience anyone could ask. Thank you KOSU!\n\nWarren Collmer\n\nCorporate pilot (37 years, retired)\n\nSocial sciences, College of Arts and Sciences, August 1973\n\nAs a high school student at Worthington High School (now Thomas Worthington), I did a work/study program my senior year and worked in the maintenance department at OSU Airport as a mechanic's helper. I also worked on the line fueling aircraft on the weekends.\n\nIn the spring of 1969, Ohio State Aviation was in the process of replacing the fleet of Piper Cherokee training airplanes to new Beech Musketeers. In late May, Beechcraft invited the Department of Aviation for a two-day factory tour and I was asked to go as well. We flew to Wichita in one of OSUs DC-3s. I remember that Bill Hubbard was the captain and the staff flight instructors (all Ohio State students) took turns in the right seat. Jack Eggspeuhler, Marv Easter, and other admin officers and staff were on board too. We met with Olive Ann Beech, and the tour included a side trip to Liberal, Kansas where the OSU Musketeers were being assembled. We returned home two days later. Great memories that influenced my life in aviation.\n\nI also remember when Jack Eggspuehler acquired a P51 Mustang and buzzed the airport (in the pre-tower days).\n\nDick Taylor\n\n1966-1988 (retired): Ohio State Department of Aviation\n\nDirector of Flight Operations and Training\n\nIn 1966, Dick Taylor joined the faculty of the Department of Aviation at The Ohio State University. He was the department's Director of Flight Operations and Training from 1981 until his retirement as Associate Professor in 1988. He wrote the following about OSU Airport’s air transportation service in Forty-Seven Years In Aviation: A Memoir; Chapter 16: Books, Helicopters, and Gliders:\n\nOne of the Diesel-3s (just one of many nicknames, including Douglas Racer, Gooney Bird, Dizzy Three, and the Grand Old Lady) was an ex-American Airlines airplane built in the late 1930s with 40,000-plus hours of flight time when it was donated to Ohio State. Rechristened N11OSU and repainted in school colors, it was the university's \"flying classroom,\" fitted with 28 airline seats, a movie projector in the rear and a screen at the forward end of the cabin.\n\nWe flew students and faculty on field trips that were enhanced by visual presentations during their flights to and from various points of interest. The OSU athletic department was a major source of business for the Air Transportation Service; 11OSU transported nearly all the varsity teams except football (too many players and too much equipment) to games at all the Big Ten schools and occasional non-conference venues. As you can see, the airplane was a little worse for wear from a cosmetic standpoint, having spent a lot of time out in the wind and weather because of hangar-space restrictions. But 11OSU served Ohio State well until it was sold in 1974. Our other DC-3 (no photo available) was formerly owned by the Kroger Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was donated to OSU when the grocery giant decided to transport their VIPs in turbine-powered airplanes.\n\nThis aircraft was everything a corporate transport should be: luxurious seating for 14 passengers, mahogany cabinets and sideboards topped with living-room quality light fixtures, leather headliners and picture windows on each side, to name just a few of its accoutrements. It had oversized prop spinners, enclosed wheel wells and several power and aerodynamic enhancements that added more than a few knots to its cruise speed. For all practical purposes 77OSU became the university president's airplane -- a \"royal barge\" to be sure -- but our then-sitting president, Dr. Novice Fawcett, deserved it. Two weeks after I returned from Korea it was the airplane in which I earned my ATP certificate and DC-3 type rating. 77OSU appears in my log books on many occasions until it was sold in 1972."
