He is being recognized for pioneering work identifying mechanisms responsible for the structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in cancer. Through the development of innovative murine models, Pellman demonstrated that whole genome duplication, now known to occur in approximately 40% of human cancers, has the potential to accelerate the somatic evolution of cancer. He also identified a mechanism explaining chromothripsis, a massive form of chromosome rearrangement that is also common in cancer. Using in-house developed methodology to combine long-term, live-cell imaging with single-cell whole genome sequencing, his group has recreated chromothripsis in the laboratory, demonstrating that it can arise from cancer-associated aberrations of the nucleus called micronuclei, thereby contributing to the mechanistic understanding of cancer genome instability.\n\nPellman’s award lecture will be held on Monday, April 8, at 5:30 p.m. PT.\n\nAACR-Irving Weinstein Foundation Distinguished Lectureship: Rafi Ahmed, PhD (Photo)\n\nThis award, supported by the Irving Weinstein Foundation, acknowledges an individual whose outstanding personal innovation in science and whose position as a thought leader in fields relevant to cancer research has the potential to inspire creative thinking and new directions in cancer research.

She is being recognized for unprecedented contributions to defining and understanding the genetical, molecular, and environmental factors that contribute to cancer onset and progression in underrepresented patient populations. Ragin’s elegant research has identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered expression of the DNA-damage response gene, polymerase β, that affect chemotherapy and radiotherapy response in patients of African origin. In addition to these pioneering research accomplishments, she is celebrated for providing consistent mentorship to minority cancer researchers and for leading collaborative and global projects dedicated to cancer prevention.\n\nRagin’s award lecture will be held on Sunday, April 7, at 3 p.m. PT.\n\nAACR-Princess Takamatsu Memorial Lectureship: Tony Hunter, PhD, FAACR (Photo)\n\nThis award, supported by The Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund, recognizes an individual scientist whose novel and significant work has had or may have a far-reaching impact on the detection, diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of cancer, and who embodies the dedication of Princess Takamatsu to multinational collaborations.\n\nHunter, a Fellow of the AACR Academy, is the American Cancer Society Professor of the Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory and Renato Dulbecco Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. He is being recognized for his seminal discovery of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins that illuminated fundamental processes of cellular signaling and enabled the development of cancer therapeutics targeting kinases. His basic biomedical research targeting tyrosine kinases has since been successfully translated to more than 80 tyrosine kinase inhibitors clinically approved to treat and manage a multitude of cancers.
