        "text": "Although he was not in our records, a newspaper article in the Summit Herald, of Summit, New Jersey, Jan. 20, 1944 announced that Second Lieutenant William R. Reiss had completed his training at Douglas and was moving on to Cochran Field, Macon for his intermediate stage of his flying training.\n\nApparently Reiss was in ROTC at Rutgers and had been called up at the end of January, 1943 [Source: The Courier-News (Bridgewater, New Jersey), 15 Jan 1943, Fri, Page 14]. This call up would explain why he is already a 2nd LT while at Douglas."
