        "text": "Post by Dave Homewood on\n\nI have tried to find a list, a nominal roll, of all the people from New Zealand who served in the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Naval Air Service or Royal Air Force in World War One.\n\nI cannot find such a thing, so I thought I would start one. I don't know too many of them but I'm certain you chaps can add more names and details please. Here are those I have already:\n\nNew Zealanders Twenty-Minuters that I do know about, beginning of a list at least:\n\n2nd Lt William B. Rhodes-Moorhouse VC (Pilot, British-born NZ'er, served in France)\n\nMajor (later Group Captain) Keith Logan \"Grid\" Caldwell (Pilot, from Auckland and Cambridge, NZ, trained by Walsh Bros, Kohimarama, served in France) See my pages on him here for more details\n\nwww.cambridgeairforce.org.nz/World%20War%20One%20Airmen.htm\n\nand\n\nwww.cambridgeairforce.org.nz/Keith%20Caldwell.htm\n\nAir Marshall Sir Keith Park (Pilot, born Thames, NZ, trained UK after transferring from Cavalry)\n\nDetails here\n\nwww.nzedge.com/heroes/park.html\n\nand\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/park1.htm\n\nWill Scotland (Pilot, born Pahi, Kaipara, Auckland, trained at Hall Flying School, Hendon, UK before war, served with D Company, Indian Expeditionary Force in Iraq flying BE's and Maurice Farman Shorthorns) Highly recommend you read 'Venture The Far Horizons' by Edgar Harvie for Will's story, it's brilliant. Doesn't cover too much in WWI though sadly.\n\nLaurie Pitcher (groundcrew mechanic, from Masterton, NZ, Will Scotland's Mechanic in Iraq)\n\nMalcolm \"Mad Mac\" MacGregor (Pilot, born Mangamako, Hunterville, NZ; trained at Walsh Bros Flying School, Kohimarama, Auckland; served at RFC School of Instruction, Oxford, UK, then No. 8 Reserve Squadron at Netherhavon, Salisbury Plains flying Maurice Farmon Shorthorn trainers. He then moved to the same squadron's 'B' Flight at Upavon flying Sopwith Pups and Avro 504's. Graduated with Wings in April 1917, and posted to No. 54 Squadron, France. Was injured after two months, then on recovery joined No. 91 Sqn, followed by posting to No. 85 Sqn. Ended the war flying SE5a's in France. postwar started or was involved in many airlines and was a huge character in the aviation scene till his death while landing at Rongotai in the late 1930's)\n\nCaptain Clive Collett - First NZ ace (Pilot, born Blenheim, NZ, trained in RFC. Flew BE-2c's and Sopwith pups in France. Shot down 15 enemy aircraft. See...\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/collett.htm\n\nGeoffrey Callender (Pilot, trained Walsh Bros Flying School, Kohimarama with Keith Caldwell - first two pilots through the school.\n\nCaptain Ronald Bannerman (Pilot, see...\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/bannerma.htm\n\nCaptain Harold Beamish (Pilot, see...\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/beamish.htm\n\nMajor Arthur Coningham (Pilot, see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/coningha.htm\n\nFlt Lt Thomas Culling (Pilot, RNAS, also reported as NZ's first ace! see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/culling.htm\n\nCaptain Euan Dickson (Pilot, see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/dickson.htm\n\nCaptain Herbert Drewitt (Pilot, see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/drewitt.htm\n\nLt Fred Gordon (Pilot, See\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/gordon.htm\n\nLt Carrick Paul (Pilot, see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/paul.htm\n\nLt Alan Scott (Pilot, see...\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/scott1.htm\n\nCaptain Gill Watson (Pilot, see\n\nwww.nzfpm.co.nz/aces/watson.htm\n\nCaptain John Seabrook (Pilot, later Chief Instructor at Auckland Aero Club in 1920's, many of his photos were sold on TradeMe recently before I realised who he really was.)\n\n2nd Lt Joe Hammond (Pilot, famous already as the first NZ military pilot, flying Bleriot 'Britannia')\n\nAny additional names or details are welcome. There were over 1000 New Zealanders in the WWI air war, serving with the RFC, RNAS, RAF and Australian Flying Corps (later RAAF). 224 pilots were trained at Kohimarama and Wigram, (110 at the former, 114 the latter) who then sailed from New Zealand as cadets and joined the RFC to complete their training. 203 of them were commissioned, though only 68 were in time to see action.\n\nHundreds of other New Zealanders joined the RNAS, RFC, or RAF by transferring from the NZEF or by direct enlistment. In total 70 NZ'ers died in the air services. I do not have their names though. One was Rhodes-Moorhouse who got his VC posthumously.\n\nCan you add more please?\n\nPost by Peter Lewis on\n\nPart of the problem you've got here is one of sematics. How do you define a 'New Zealand Airman'?\n\nAs I see it, there are three groups of these fellows:\n\n1. Those who were born in NZ, and after the War those who survived mostly returned to NZ and spent the rest of there lives here eg McGregor\n\n2. Those who were born overseas and came here as children or young men intending to settle. If the war had not come along, they may well have never left NZ again eg Seabrook\n\n3. Those who were born overseas and briefly visited NZ for only a short period of time (months if not weeks) and had no intention of staying or returning after they had left eg Rhodes-Moorhouse\n\nI had this argument with MoTAT years ago, when they were listing 'famous air people' (I can't say 'airmen' without excluding Jean Batten) and I was stongly against including Rhodes-Moorhouse as in my view he was not a New Zealander and never considered himself as one. He was born and brought up in England and only visted NZ once for a few weeks in 1906/1907. Most online references these days (eg Wikipedia) refer to him as 'English recipient of the Victoria Cross'. His catagorizing as a New Zealander. in my view, dates from local propaganda designed to promote recruitment at that time.\n\nI do not in any way mean to denigrate the fellow, or his expoilts, but I do not think that he should be included in this category.\n\nPost by Dave Homewood on\n\nI have considered the same thing about Rhodes-Moorhouse. I doubt there are many others in his position. His father was British but came to NZ and settled. He married a Kiwi. They then went to England later and he was born. He grew up there.\n\nSome sources say he's British of New Zealand parents. It's all a bit confusing as one of his parents wasn't really a NZ'er, though maybe he was nationalised as one? I agree he's much more English than Kiwi, but back then we were all british citizens so that confuses it more too.\n\nThe reason I decided to include him is because the RNZAF Museum has a large display dedicated to him specifically, and it seems they consider him a British-born New Zealander too.\n\nI think there's a blur in being two such tied and entangled countries. If his parents had gone to Japan and he'd been born there, he'd be considered a Kiwi much more than a Japanese guy I think.\n\nPost by Dave Homewood on\n\nJust an update of New Zealanders who served in the World War One Air Forces, I found a list of pilots who were all the founding members of the Territorial Air Force (also known as the NZAF) in June 1923. They had all served in WWI. I have added first names where I know them. The list is\n\nMajor Keith L. Caldwell, MC, DFC\n\nCaptains\n\nR. E. Buckingham, MC\n\nC. F. Meagher, AFC\n\nMaurice W.

Only one I know was a pilot, the other two I am still working on. They are:\n\n- Leonard Lewis 'Dick' Orr (Pilot)\n\n- Lt Thomas Henry 'Tommy' Hampshire\n\n- Sgt William 'Bill' Meanie\n\nCan you add other WWI New Zealanders who were pilots in particular, or other tradesmen from the RFC, RNAS or RAF (or other air forces)? Or can you add a first name to any of the above?\n\nPost by Dave Homewood on\n\nHere is another Kiwi airman from WWI, with a distiunguished career. This is taken from the July 1974 issue of NZ Wings magazine:\n\nWWI Zeppelin-buster dies at 90\n\nA NEW Zealander who was the first man to engage a German Zeppelin over Britain during the First World War and contribute to its destruction, died in Uper Hutt last month at the age of 90.\n\nHe was Mr Alfred de Bathe Brandon, who received the Military Cross for his bombing attack on the Zeppelin L.15 on the night of March 31-April 1, 1916, and the Distinguished Service Order for firing on and forcing down the L.33 on the night of Septemebr 23-24, 1916.\n\nMr Brandon was born in Heretaunga in the Upper Hutt Valley in 1884 and practised as a barrister in Wellington during the early 1900's.\n\nAlways keen on flying, he joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1915, even though he was then aged 33, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.\n\nFollowing the Armistace, Mr Brandon now a major, returned to New Zealand and continued his law practise.\n\nHowever, in early 1919 he was one of three officers attached to the staff of Colonel Vere Bettingdon who had been sent from Britain to advise the New Zealand Government on its future aviation policy.\n\nMr Brandon was also a close friend of the late Sir Francis Chichester and he had much to do with his coming to New Zealand.\n\nMr Brandon continued to practise as a barister and solicitor in Wellington until about 20 years ago.\n\nPost by planeimages on\n\nToo late at night to look at lists but Joseph Joel Hammond is credited with being the fist Kiwi to fly. He worked for \"Bristols\" (British and Colonial Aircraft company) and was the chief pilot of the \"\"Bristol Air Mission\" in 1911 to try to sell a pair of Bristol \"Boxkites\" (10 & 11) to the Australian Government.\n\nThe Gov't declined but No.11 was sold to W.E.Hart who, after rebuilding the machine when a windstorm wrecked it, became the holder of the first (and only) Australian Air League RAC-endorsed pilots' licence.\n\nI understand that Hammond returned to the UK and lost his life shortly after. I do not know if this was in military service or, like his mechanic/instructor in Australia, Leslie McDonald, he died in a civil prang.\n\nI am presently writing a story on Hart.\n\nPost by mungus on\n\nAnother one. My Grandmothers cousin.\n\nMajor Harry Williams (believed MC)\n\nFrom Mere Mere, Taranaki. (Although his family also farmed near Cambridge)\n\nRFC 7 Squadron\n\nBegan WW1 as 1st Lt in mounted rifles Gallipoli.\n\nWounded July 1915 and evacuated to Egypt.\n\nWith permission from Gen Russell, transferred to RFC initially as an observor in BE2B/C in middle east campaign, then to UK for wings course. Pilot in SE5, Bristol Fighter, RE8, Avro, DH9 & Sopwith Pup. Shot down in no mans land, breaking both legs but survived the War...\n\nI am lucky enough to have some of his original letters from Gallipoli to my Grandmother on NZEF stationary, and copies of some of his memoirs. But would like to see his records for confirmation of exact details, etc. As I have these for one of his nephews who was KIA in 1943 in the Solomons in RNZAF P40 NZ3076.\n\nDoes anybody know a way to get RFC officer records? And also NZ Army WW1 records? Thanks...\n\nPost by Dave Homewood on\n\nWelcome to the forum Mungus. Please tell me more about the Cambridge connection with this airman. Did he ever live in the Cambridge district himself at any point? If so he then comes under the area of my website project. Also, did the P-40 pilot have any connection to the Cambridge district?\n\nAs for his service records, you should be able to get them from Archives New Zealand I think, do you know his service number because they hold records for several Harry Williams's from WWI. If you have his service number do a search here for his name\n\narchway.archives.govt.nz/CallSimpleSearch.do\n\nThe Military Personnel files come up on the second and third page when you search for 'Harry Williams'\n\nPost by mungus on\n\nThank you for your welcome Dave.\n\nThe post was more about adding to a list of WW1 Kiwi pilots.\n\nRegarding any Cambridge links. I was told he retired somewhere near Cambridge. He was also part of the family of the JJ Patterson / Williams farming enterprises in the Waikato and Taranaki. This included dairy farms around Cambridge.\n\nApparently his Legal name was - Henry Daniel Williams - Born 9.12.1893 and died on 26.6.1981. But always known as \"Harry\". But I would have to do more research to be sure of any details.\n\nI will post back if I do.\n\nAs an aside 2 of his nephews also flew, in WW2. Lyn Williams KIA 31.07.43 in P40M NZ3076 in the Solomons, and Reeve Williams (Fleet Air Arm) POW, who sadly died about 2 or 3 years ago in Tauranga."
