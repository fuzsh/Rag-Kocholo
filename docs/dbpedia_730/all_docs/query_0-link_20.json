        "text": "WW1 British Naval Aviation\n\nThe Royal Naval Air Service (R.N.A.S)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was the air arm of the Royal Navy during World War I and existed from 1914 until 1918 when it merged with the British Army’s Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force (RAF).\n\nThe RNAS was responsible for a range of activities, including reconnaissance, bombing raids, and anti-submarine patrols. It operated a variety of aircraft, including seaplanes and airships, and played an important role in the Battle of Jutland, one of the largest naval battles in history.\n\nThe RNAS also had a number of notable pilots, including the famous ace, Raymond Collishaw, who flew a variety of aircraft on multiple fronts and was credited with over 60 aerial victories.\n\nOverall, the RNAS made significant contributions to the Allied war effort during World War I and laid the foundations for the development of the RAF in the years to come.\n\nEarly Development (1908-1911)\n\nWillows No. 4, HMS Airship No.2, 1912\n\nAs early as 1908, the British government promoted the creation of an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. There was also a sub-committee on aviation born from the Committee of Imperial Defense. These were reunions of politicians and military staff to study the best use for nascent aircraft, for military purposes. On May 7, 1909 Vickers was appinted to create a rigid airship usabled for the Royal Navy for reconnaissance and observation. “Mayfly” was a 156 m long aerostat, which crashed after a gust of wind on September 24, 1911 before its maiden flight.\n\nBy November 1910, the Royal Aero Club offered the Royal Navy two aircraft for instruction and evaluation, done at its Eastchurch facilities. The British Admiralty accepted, provided that aspiring pilots were voluntary, single and able to pay their dues to the Royal Aero Club…\n\nStill, there were 200 volunteers, and four were trained at the Naval Flying School Eastchurch: Captain E.L. Gerrard of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and Lieutenants C.R. Samson, A.M. Longmore and A. Gregory (Roskill), all patented in 1911.\n\nThe RFC naval branch (1912-1914)\n\nPersonnel of No.1 Squadron RNAS in late 1914\n\nA Royal Decree of 13 April 1912 creating the Royal Flying Corps also was accompnied by the creation of the Royal Navy Air Detachment, at the same time as the Air Battalion of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The RFC naval unit was soon placed under command of Commander C.R. Samson, with the creation of a Central Flying School open to officers and privates of both services. It was created on June 19, 1912, in Upavon and commanded by a naval officer, Captain Godfrey Paine. A Special Reserve of Officers was also formed for those don’t choosing between both services yet.\n\nThe unified structure allowed the Royal Navy to carry out its own tests at Eastchurch. The summer of 1912 also saw the Admiralty creating its own Aeronautical Department, entrusted to Captain Murray Sueter. From September 1912 “Naval Air Service” appeared in documents mentioning four seaplanes tested in coordination with the British Army.\n\nIn 1913 the establishment of a seaplane base on the Isle of Grain (Medway entrance) was accompanied by the installation of airships maintenance and facilities at Kingsnorth. Overall, the RFC proposed nine land bases to be usable by the Navy, all close to the coast.\n\nIn 1913 also, aircraft took part in British naval maneuvers from HMS Hermes, a converted cruiser into a seaplane carrier.\n\nOn June 7, 1913, the Naval Air Service comprised 44 officers and 105 privates, all trained from the Central Flying School and Eastchurch School. In addition 35 specialists had been qualified to handle RN airships. Three blimps ordered for the Army (Willows No 4, Astra Torres AT-14, Parseval No.4) were transferred to this NAS and as a semi-independent entity, the Royal Naval Air Service was officially constituted on 1 July 1914, as the naval element of the Royal Flying Corps. It was however independent as attached directly to the command of the Royal Navy, and took orders from it. As a result, this was the world’s first independent naval branch, and fully under Royal Navy control from August 1, 1915, less than a year after the war has started.\n\nWartime Operations (1914-1918)\n\nHMS Vindex, one of the serial-converted seaplane carrier\n\nBy August 1914 the RNAS boasted no less than 39 planes, 52 seaplanes, 6 airships and 2 captive balloons. The associated personal amounted to 727 men of all ranks and 120 pilots, spread among 12 bases for airships along the British coasts.\n\nThe RNAS was at first responsible for naval reconnaissance (1) combat assistance to the fleet (2) surveillance of the coasts (3) and attack of coastal sectors under enemy control (4), like the Flanders Coast. From the experience driven from HMS Hermes, new seaplane carriers were soon converted from requisitioned civilian steamers, freighters and later even liners. By December already, the RNAS could project its seaplane force from HMS Engadine, Riviera and Empress. First operation was a raid on naval installations of Cuxhaven. Due to the weak bomb load of the seaplanes, the RNAS failed to destroy the solidly built Zeppelin hangars, but it proved the concept and had a certain psychological impact.\n\nSee the full list of WWI British seaplane carriers and aircraft carriers\n\nHMS Ark Royal was the first tailored ships as a seaplane carrier, soon enabling wheeled undercarriage models to take off from her foredeck, assuming they would later land on the coast. It operated 5 seaplanes and two Sopwith Tabloid for air defence and escort of the former. In February 1915, HMS Ark Royal took part in the Dardanelles Campaign, where most of the later converted seaplane carriers participated in.\n\nIn WWI, apart HMS Hermes (ii) which was not completed in time, the Royal Navy operated 14 converted ships: 12 seaplane carriers, some fitted with small decks for planes take-off, and two true “aircraft carriers”, HMS Furious and Argus. In 1918, the RNAS was the world’s largest and best equipped naval air force worldwide.\n\nIn 1917, the battlecruiser HMS Furious started to be modified, with 49 m flight deck over an aircraft hangar and by August 2, 1917, Squ. Commander Edwin Dunning died while trying to land with a Sopwith Pup. The rear turret was removed and replace by a 91 m landing bridge, also above a hangar, creating the world’s first true aicraft carrier, albeit still with the bridge, funnel and mast in the middle. This concept was experimented when bombing the German naval installations at Tondern on July 19, 1918: 7 Sopwith Camels took off from Furious and managed to destroy the Zeppelin L.54 and L.60.\n\nHMS Campania in 1917\n\nBut apart these spectacular operations, the bulk of RNAS missions was to patrol over the English Channel and North Sea in search of German submarines. 175 U-boats were spotted in 1917 alone, 107 attacked, a few sunk (these models still lacked sufficient bomb loads). In this role, seaplanes were preferred, unquestionably, as they could land anywhere unlike wheeled models. They were generally larger and had a much longer range. Still, it was envisioned to place short runways on most large ships of the RN in an attempt to shoot down Zeppelins when spotted. This was the distant ancestor of the CAM-ships of WW2. Most Battleships in 1918 received such small platforms over their “B” turret in order to launch a Pup for various missions, assuming again it would land somewhere.\n\nHMS Furious in 1918\n\nContribution to British Armor Development\n\nTalbot Armoured Car of the Admiralty Pattern Mk.II, Turreted, late 1915 type.\n\nOne aspect which is not awaited and often overlooked is the importance of the RNAS in developing armour warfare in WWI. Long before the British Army deployed any tank on the western front. The first tank engagement of the war took place on September 15, 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. The British Army used tanks for the first time in combat, and the engagement involved a small number of tanks attacking German trenches.\n\nThe tanks used in this engagement were Mark I tanks, and they were slow and unreliable. Nevertheless, they were able to provide some support to the infantry and break through the German lines.\n\nThe tank crews faced a number of challenges, including mechanical breakdowns and getting stuck in mud and shell holes. However, despite these difficulties, the tanks proved to be effective at crossing trenches and destroying barbed wire obstacles.\n\nThe first tank engagement was not a decisive victory, but it demonstrated the potential of tanks as a new weapon of war. As a result, both the British and the Germans began to develop and improve their tank technology and tactics, leading to more sophisticated and effective tanks being used in subsequent battles.\n\nHowever, added to the rivalry with the RFC, the RNAS started to be in rivalry with the Army as well: The RNAS operating along the Belgian coasts had its vehicles experimentally armored in order to secure its means of communication and recover fallen pilots behind the enemy lines. They were also the only ones available protecting the withdrawal of Belgian troops between Antwerp and the Yser.\n\nIn September 1914, the RNAS form an Armored Car Section, with their modifications designed by a special commission from the Air Department of the Admiralty. The first three vehicles were delivered on December 3, 1914.\n\nThe RNAS would form over time six squadrons of 12 vehicles. The first was sent to France, and later transferred to Egypt in late 1915, Another went to Africa, two were transferred in April 1915 to Gallipoli and by August 1915 the remainder were transferred to the British Army, although some still sported the “RNAS” inscription in 1916, and kept the same original crews.\n\nImprovized armoured Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, 1914\n\nAdmiralty Pattern Mark II Rolls Royce in 1915\n\nLanchester Armoured Car, same configuration, 1915\n\nAnother RNAS Lanchester in Persia, 1916/ Notice the dark sand livery.\n\nIn August-September 1914 already, to rescue RNAS pilots which fell behind enemy lines, a detachment of improvized armor vehicles was developed in Belgium for that purpose.\n\nThe RNAS (Royal Naval Air Service) operated improvized armoured cars to fast moving and return from behind enemy lines, developed by Commander Samson, which personally converted all models he could muster from the RNAS vehicle park at his disposal, converted in Belgium. By the autumn of 1914 dozens of vehicles were ordered to be converted, testing various solution to protect the driver and passenger (including the precious pilot(s) !). From “Open top” configuration they were gradually transformed through two “Admiralty pattern” ending with fully enclosed and turreted vehicles which really pioneered the development of Armoured Cars in Great Britain. The front became static in 1914, but apart in Belgium and Flanders where these rescue missioned became too hazardous to go on, these armoured cars saw action this time with the Army where it really mattered, where the situation was mobile enough: In the middle east and eastern front.\n\nIt should be added that the Royal Navy was also intrumental (through Winston Churchill) in the development of Tanks in Great Britain, through the “landship committee”, adoption of casemated naval guns for tanks, etc. But it was not related to the RNAS.\n\nEnd of Independence (1918)\n\nHMS Argus, the world’s first “through-deck” aircraft carrier. A conversion of the Italian liner Conte Rosso under construction in Beardmore and requsitioned, she was not accepted until September 1918, used to train pilots and still around in WW2.\n\nIf the Army eventually recuperated the armored vehicles from the RNAS without much incident, the conflict between the RNAS and the RFC was certainly more intense. The RNAS was diverted from its traditional role when called to the aid of the RFC on the Western Front, and to defend London. Since the latter was a Zeppelin Raid, the admiralty estimated that the last contribution authorized a more proactive answer, by attempting to destroy Zeppelin installations at Friedrichshafen, ending the problem to the source. The raid was carried out on 21 November 1914 from Belfort with RNAS three Avro 504s dropping eleven 9 kg bombs, destroying ground installations plusthe hydrogen production unit, but not the hangar or airships inside.\n\nThis success galzvanized the armiralty which launched other raids on Kaiserliches Marine bases at Cuxhaven, Wilhelmshaven and Tondern (after all, these were “navy vs. navy” fights), and the Royal Navy withing a very tight budget eventually created its own autonomous strategic bombardment unit. This was not seen with approval by the RFC and fed a rivalry, leading to tractation on models diversions. The RNAS obtained from Sopwith priority in delivery of Sopwith 1½ Strutter over the RFC, and led the War Office to oblige the TNAS to return these to the RFC. The Navy obtained however to receive also the very first production Sopwith Pup, well before the RFC, and later, the Sopwith Triplane, and in turn the Sopwith Camel, while the RFC went on with upgraded Pups.\n\nOn 1 April 1918 the British Army’s Royal Flying Corps, independent from the Army, was seen as a concession, and in exchanged, obtained the merging of the Royal Naval Air Service into a new unified service called the Royal Air Force. The RNAS thus had to transfer a total of 67,000 men, 2,949 aircraft and seaplanes, 103 airships and 126 shore bases. For the Royal Navy this was a hard blow as it would not be easy until the end of the war to collaborate on its own missions.\n\nOn April 1, 1924, however, the Fleet Air Arm was created inside the Royal Air Force as a concession, to separate notably RAF units operating from aircraft carriers. It’s only May 24, 1939 that the Fleet Air Arm returned under British Admiralty full control, but having only 232 aircraft among 20 squadrons. Still, the rivalry went on in WW2, shown notably by the halp-hazard complement of RNAS planes compared to the RAF. This time the latter ensured to have the monopoly on delivery of the latest Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire for example, and total monopoly on bombers. This was only lifted in 1943-44 due to the need of having long-range ASW patrol bombers, whereas the complement of aircraft carriers progressed with better models.\n\nComplete List of WW1 RNAS models\n\nFairey Campania torpedo/bomber/scout, world’s first carrier-borne designed aircraft.\n\nThe widely used Short 184 (over 900 built)\n\nThe RNAS torpedo-carrier Sopwith Cuckoo was tailored to operate from aircraft carriers, such as HMS Furious\n\nFelixtowe F2A long range flying boat.

The term “flying corp” reflected the use that was made of aviation this moment of pioneers, a simple emanation of the army, devoted to observation. Unlike France, Britain had no active squadrons or aeronautical industry in 1914. His material came, like most countries, from French productions. The British cockade was itself directly inspired by the French cockade, following misunderstandings and friendly shots due to the symbol of St. George cross drawn from the union Jack affixed to the first aircraft, confused with the German cross. But this industrial dependence, Britain began to get rid of it rapidly, and reached very high industrial standards in 1918.\n\nFrench planes of the Royal Flying Corps\n\nThe nation outside United Kingdom that became a major provider was France, overwhelmingly compared to USA and Italy, not only for planes but also aircraft engines. This could take the shape of complete purchased planes or licence-production, direct or indirect. Some French early designs were quite influential like the Farman Mf.11. In late period, proportion of British planes was much larger than in 1914 where the RFC started from scratch. But the list is quite extensive nonetheless:\n\nBlériot XI\n\nBlériot XII\n\nBlériot XXI\n\nBlériot Parasol Monoplane\n\nBreguet Type III\n\nCaproni Ca.1\n\nCaudron G.4\n\nCaudron R.11\n\nDeperdussin TT\n\nFarman III\n\nFarman F.40\n\nFarman HF.20\n\nFarman MF.7 Longhorn\n\nFarman MF.11 Shorthorn\n\nFarman Type Militaire, 1910\n\nFBA Type A\n\nMorane-Saulnier G\n\nMorane-Saulnier H\n\nMorane-Saulnier BB\n\nMorane-Saulnier I\n\nMorane-Saulnier L\n\nMorane-Saulnier LA\n\nMorane-Saulnier N\n\nMorane-Saulnier V\n\nMorane-Saulnier P\n\nMorane-Saulnier AC\n\nNieuport IV\n\nNieuport 12\n\nNieuport 16\n\nNieuport 17\n\nNieuport 20\n\nNieuport 21\n\nNieuport 23\n\nNieuport 24\n\nNieuport 27\n\nPaulhan biplane\n\nSPAD S.VII\n\nSPAD S.XIII\n\nVoisin III\n\nClement Bayard II Zeta airship\n\nAmerican planes of the Royal Flying Corps\n\nWithout the language barrier and with the formidable American industrial resources, some American models made their way into British service. The earliest were converted Wright aircrafts for military purposes in 1912-13 and the Cody V was only two planes operationally tested in 1914 but soon discarded.\n\nBut the RFC also operated captured German aircrafts, mostly for tesing purposes, intact or lightly damaged and fallen into rear lines. These were the AEG G.IV and Ago C.IV, Albatros D.I, D.III, D.V, D.Va, DFW C.V, Fokker D.VII, Dr.I, E.III, Friedrichshafen G.III, Gotha G.V, Halberstadt CL.II, D.III, Hannover CL.II, Junkers J.I, LVG C.VI, Pfalz D.III and Rumpler C.IV.\n\nCody V biplane\n\nCurtiss JN-3\n\nCurtiss JN-4\n\nFamous Models\n\nHere are following some of the most famous British Planes of WW1. They were be studied more exhaustively in the respective manufacturer pages.\n\nAirco DH.5\n\nDH.5 in March 1917.\n\nThe DH5 was supposed to be much more efficient than the DH.2 it replaced had to keep its excellent field of vision while having the advantage of a tractive propeller. This is how he had the distinction of having a superior sail plan offset to the rear and a cockpit very forward. Ready late1916, it was ordered by the RFC 40 copies but its maneuverability was lower than the Pup. The aircraft were operational in May 1917, just after the Allied eclipse on the North Front. This aircraft had a Le Rhône engine but its maneuverability was disappointing and its pilots made it to be quickly placed in ground attack groups. At the end of 1917, the Dh-5 was withdrawn from service and its sails were not taken on later planes.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 7,82 m, Length 6,71 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

A 1915 specification of the RFC required an observation aircraft capable of defending against hunters. F2 replaced RE.8 “Arry Tate”, mediocre, and was bigger, faster, and much better armed, with a hood machine gun and a rear-seat defense. Its first engine, the Rolls-Royce Falcon, was soon insufficiently produced to meet the needs of the cell and the Falcon engine F2A, operational in March 1917 within the squadron 48 suffered heavy losses. Faster, the RR Falcon II-powered F2B restores the balance. Sturdy and maneuverable, the F2Bs were observation planes capable of self-defense, but also of hunting, or bombarding targets. 3100 aircraft saw the day of the main F2B, which fought until the armistice.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 11.96 m, Length 7.87 m, Height 2.97 m\n\nWeight: empty: 886 Kgs.

Maneuverable, but slow, it was equipped with a French Rotary engine Le Rhône. The Scout C (161 copies) was operational in December 1914, the Scout D (210 copies) divided between the army and the Navy.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 8,33 m, Length 6,02 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

Tandem, with a rear defender position, it could also ship a Substantial charge of bombs or rockets. It was operational in January 1918 and from then on adopted and mass produced, to 390 copies in its version A. Very successful, declined after-war in civil versions, it was in service until 1927.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 14,02 m, Length 9,14 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: -Kgs.

Deriving from the O/400, he was equipped with two machine gun positions for his defense and embarked a 910 Kgs bomb load. Its first flights came in October, but the first operational squadrons were only in August-September 1918, the rest being constituted at the time of the signing of armistice. Otherwise, this large multi-train aircraft was the basis of military and civilian derivatives.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 30.48 m, Length 19.16 m, Height 6.7 m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

Among his first productions are this heavy fighter / single engine observation aircraft with a propulsion engine configuration / forward gun position, before the synchronization arrives. Very similar to the Airco Dh.2 it served as a heavy fighter, with good autonomy but improved maneuverability. It flew for the first time in January 1915, with a Green engine (Fe2a, 12 units), then a Beardmore (Fe2b, 1927 units), in service until the end of 1918. A last Version, the Fe2d, (300 units) was powered by a 250 hp Rolls-Royce Mk.III, and had performance well above Fe2a (100 hp).\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 14,55 m, Length 9,83 m, Height 3,97 m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

He was equipped with a mobile Vickers machine gun in the front, the piloe wedging the handle between his knees and stepping forward to fire and reload the weapon. The mobility of the machine gun had some advantages in combat. First flight made in October 1916, production of 182 copies, withdrawn in the summer of 1917 for insufficient maneuverability. French Gnome engines, but some Clerget and The Rhone, quadripal propeller.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 9,60 m, Length 7,21 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

Designed by state-owned RAF, it was designed to outclass German fighters in a hurry and was equipped with powerful online engines early on. He made his first flight in December 1916 with a Hispano-Suiza 150 hp, the same as SPAD VII. He also had two machine guns, hood and wing. A first series of 85 Se5 were launched in April 1917, then gave way to the improved Se5a, equipped with the HS of 200 hp, but the rate of production too slow was alternated with a local engine, the Wolseley W4a Viper. 5127 aircraft of this version went on fire, the last ones in November 1918.\n\nAn excellent device, as robust as it was manageable and fast, it was a powerful contributor to the Allies regaining control of the skies on the North Front, but many were also exported or affected in the Commonwealth, fighting in Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans … The Se5a, much easier to handle for young drivers than the Sopwith Camel, was still in service in 1922.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 8.12 m, Length 8.30 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

It was removed from service as a fighter, but many still operated against Zeppelins raids in Britain or for light bombing missions.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 8,08 m, Length 6,04 m, Height – m\n\nWeight: empty: – Kgs.

It was largely derived from the Sopwith Pup, but with a Clerget 9 engine more powerful, but also more maneuverable and having a better field of vision. It was he who inspired the triplans subsequently built for the Germans. He made his first flight in May 1916 and was operational at RNAS * in November. 140 copies were built, but the series stopped there: The recently arrived Camel was better. An ace like Raymond Collishaw earned most of his victories on this device.\n\n*Royal Naval Air Service: Royal Navy Air Branch.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 8,08 m, Length 5,74 m, Height 3,60 m\n\nWeight: empty: 499 Kgs.

With the adaptation of the new Bentley BR2 engine, the Snipe prototype was not really operational until February 1918. Its early armament consisted of two bonnet guns and a third of its wings, but it was quickly removed. The series copies, after the initial order of 1700 machines, were not ready in France until September… The Sqn 43, 78, and 208 implemented it intensely until the armistice, and the Snipe proves that it was in every respect superior to the Camel – and even to all the other hunters of the moment. The newly converted Australian Sqn 4 abolished 36 enemy aircraft in four days, while Major Barker abolished three Fokker DVIIs alone in a Homeric duel.\n\nDimensions: Wingspan: 9.14 m, Length 6.05 m, Height 2.60 m\n\nWeight: empty: 596 Kgs.

Here are most (if not all, the hunt is still ongoing) WW1 British prototypes, from prewar sports planes tested by the military to projects and programs started in the very last days of the war but developed in 1919 or 1920 like the Amazing Tarrant Tabor, largest aircraft in the world.\n\nPemberton-Billing P.B.31 Nighthawk (1916) – British WWI prototype of interceptor\n\nTarrant Tabor (1919) – British heavy bomber, which design started just at the end of the war by W.G Tarrant Ltd (Only flight in May 1919, and crash) It was the world’s largest aircraft. After this, the larger Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo (a novaplane, or nine-plane aircraft) showed by adding planes were no substitutes for structural strength. Giant planes would return, but made in all metallic structures and sturdier cantilever wings.\n\nFlanders F.4 (1912)\n\nThe Flanders F.4 was a WW1 British prototype serie of two-seat monoplanes designed and made by Howard Flanders, developed from the Flanders F.3. The latter flew in the spring of 1912, with success. Trials urged the British War Office to order four more for the newly created Royal Flying Corps with the same configuration as the F.3 but larger cockpits for two seats in tandem. It was also faster with a 70 hp (52 kW) Renault engine and four-bladed propeller and reviews, sturdier parts and assembly to be easier to maintain and be more reliable. The fixed landing gear was also improved as coil-spring suspensions were fitted to the wheel arms. First flight occurred at Brooklands on 6 July 1912, and the four ordered has been delivered by 2 January 1913, showing good flying characteristics. More were to come when the RFC was rebuffed from monoplanes after a fatal crash by a Deperdussin and a Bristol-Coanda in early September 1912. The Royal Flying Corps banned the use of monoplanes. The Flanders had their engines removed to power Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2s and the fuselage and wings dumped or recycled.\n\nGrahame-White Type XV (1913)\n\nThis military trainer biplane was available before World War I. Often known as the Box-kite, this model was derived from the Grahame-White Type XII, following a long line of civilian and sport models but also the military Type X and XI. In 1911 the company was created by Claude Grahame-White and included an aerodrome (Hendon), a school and a workshop. Famous designer was John Dudley North, later Boulton and Paul’s chief designer. Among the models buit were Aero-bus and Box-kite biplane, influenced by the Farman design. After its prewar own models the company focused on manufacturing other models, like the Henry Farman F.20 (80 hp Gnome/Rhone) and Avro 503, with about 600 delivered of the latter. In 1917 it was ordered also 700 DH-6 two-seater biplanes. Problems and delays on delivery raised disputes with the Air Board and led to huge financial losses that will almost bankrupt the company later, saved after the war by refurbishing war-surplus Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost chassis…\n\nThe Type XV was also named Admiralty Type 1600, as it was purchased first by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). This was a pod-and-boom biplane with three-bay unstaggered wings. Early models had seats for the instructor and student pilot fitted on the leading edge of the lower wing. They usually seat in tandem in the nacelle, the engine being locatred at the back of it, in a pusher configuration. Four parallel beams started from the upper and lower wings, ended with twin rudders and the horizontal stabilizer. From equal span wings succeeded extensions on the upper wing. The landing gear was of the two-wheel and skid model. It was one of the most common trainerof the RNAS and RFC as 135 available before the war. By November 1913 one of these underwent trials with of forward-mounted Lewis machine gun, firing at ground targets. The Grahame-White Type XV were obsolete after 1915 and gradually retired or sold, just broken, and apparently three survived the war to see civilian service from 1919.\n\nRead more on Graham-White\n\nHoward Wright 1910 Biplane (1910)\n\nThe Howard Wright 1910 biplane was a two-bay pusher biplane of the “Farman type”, with two pairs of booms forward of the wings and bearing a single elevator and others supporting a single rudder half above and half below. The wings were reinforced by a mahogany main spar and short sheet-metal king posts. The upper wings had removable extensions braced by other king posts and the undercarriage had skids and wheels attached underneath. It was propelled by a 50 hp Gnome in a pusher configuration. The prototype traded this later for a 60 hp E.N.V. water-cooled engine and flew at the £4,000 Baron de Forest prize (longest all-British flight). A second prototype was built which flew at Larkhill on Salisbury plain, but crashed in Kent and was resold to the Army, being used by the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers at Larkhill. Another was bought by Thomas Sopwith which later won the Baron de Forest prize. A fourth prototype was shipped to New Zealand in 1910 for Leo and Vivian Walsh. A fifth one was used by the Graham White flying school at Hendon, powered by a Gnome engine, another was flown by Lewis Turner at the 1912 Aerial Derby, and another was powered by a 40 hp (30 kW) Green engine and flew at the Graham White school in 1911 before moving to Rangoon the next year. This gave a total of seven planes which mainly formed many pilots in 1911-1913.\n\nMartin-Handasyde No.3 Monoplane (1910)\n\nA single sport monoplane based on Antoinette monoplanes, with a slender triangular section fuselage. It had also tapered wings braced by mid-span kingposts, and acted by wing-warping. It rested on a pair of wheels on a cross-axle and forward-projected skid. It was powered powered by a 60 hp (45 kW) Antoinette V-8 engine, later a 40 hp (30 kW) J.A.P. It flew at Brooklands with H.P. Martin acting as pilot in November 1910 but crashed in 1912, when piloted by Graham Gilmour, suffering a fatal structural failure. The two-seater was called the Martin Handasyde 4B Dragonfly was 11 m wide, built for Thomas Sopwith.\n\nCody Mark V (1913)\n\nThis plane of United Kingdom, was designed by American engineer Samuel Franklin Cody and first flew in July 1912, being introduced into service in late 1912 and was retired in 1913, used as a trainer by the Royal Flying Corps. Only two were ever built. Thy were the result of the December 1911 RFC competition for a Military aircraft capable of carrying a pilot and observer. Showman and aviation pioneer Samuel Cody was well-placed in this competition, already having British Army Aeroplane No 1 at the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1908, which made the first powered controlled flight in the United Kingdom. He also tested in August 1912 a monoplane powered by a salvaged 120-hp (89 kW) Austro-Daimler engine, and later a monoplane 60-hp Green engine which made a competition flight (tour of Britain) in 1911. This model crashed too, but Cody rebuilt both with a new engine and many modifications, the model being known as the Cody V. It participated an an Army competition and won the first prize, and was used by the Royal Flying Corps from 30 November 1912.\n\nASL Valkyrie (1911)\n\nThis competition model was a canard pusher designed by Horatio Barber of the Aeronautical Syndicate Ltd in 1910. 11 were built and widely flown during 1911 for sport, race and also for instructional purposes at the ASL flying school at Hendon Aerodrome in London. But they also served military purposes: Four were given to the War Office to promote military aviation in Britain. In 1914 they had been long retired. The Valkyrie B was propelled by a 1Gnome Omega rotary, 50 hp (37 kW) engine and flew at 70 mph (113 km/h; 61 kn).\n\nASL Viking (1912)\n\nA unusual single-engine, two propellers tractor biplane built by the Aeronautical Syndicate Ltd and designed by Horatio Barber, which first flew on 12 January 1912. This 360 kgs. plane housed a mid-fuselage Gnome Omega 7-cyl. air-cooled rotary piston engine, 50 hp (37 kW), which actioned two propellers fitted mid-wings on struts, via A.S.L. wooden fixed pitch tractor propellers, chain-driven. It first flew early in 1912 but due to no commercial success Barber basically ceased activities and sold Aerial Syndicate assets in April 1912 to Frederick Handley Page. The Viking ended in the hads of Hamilton Ross, manager of the Chanter Flying School at Shoreham, fitted with floats, and a single propeller driven directly by the engine through a gap in the rear part of the fuselage.\n\nBeatty-Wright Biplanes (1911-1913)\n\nThese were basically Wright Biplanes used at the Beatty School of Flying, some being modified by Beatty. The latter was a gifted pilot, one of the world’s first to make banked turns on his Wright over Hendon. George William Beatty was born on August 28, 1887 in Whitehouse, New Jersey. He used to work as a linotype operator and in 1911 he enrolled at the Wright School at Nassau and in 1912, established a school on Long Island, then shipped his plane to England and formed there a partnership with Handley Page in 1914, establishing a new school at Hendon Aerodrome. Chief pilot instructor became Edouard Baumann. In 1915 Beatty opened a workshop tp produce aeroplane parts, also at Hendon, which worked well until the end of World War and also tested variants of the Wright design. In 1916 he made a reliable and simple two bay plane for training, powered by an Anzani, and then Beatty’s own engine, but it crashed on 13 October 1917. He returned to the USA after the war.\n\nBoulton-Paul P series (1918)\n\nUntil the end of the war, Boulton & Paul Ltd, a former generic manufacturer of Norwich had built many aircraft under contract, including 1,575 Sopwith Camels and 550 of the Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b. With the success of their planes they setup a design department and started working on their own model. Their first model was the P.3 Bobolink, which was designed following an official requirement for a replacement of the Sopwith Camel. They created a no-nonsense two-bay biplane powered by the same Bentley BR2 that already powered the Sopwith Snipe, another contender. This was the first also to feature jettisonable fuel tanks, placed behind the pilot and separated with a sheet of armour to act as firewall. Whereas the Bobolink and Snipe had similar performances, the former had ban ground handling and was more complex, therefore not selected.\n\nThe Boulton Paul P.6 was a parallel project, a pure testing biplane, two-bay aircraft made to explore the effects of different airfoil sections and a large interplane gap to test interference effects. The fuselage was virtually a near-copy of the Camel’s and many Camel parts were used, but it was powered by a relatively week RAF1a air-cooled V-8, 90 hp (67 kW). First drawn in April 1918, the P.6 probably flew in the last days of the war (date unknown). From 1919 it was used as a sales planes, with the company name over it. A replica was built by the Boulton Paul Association, now in store at Cosford. It was derived into the P.9 Light utility aircraft of which six were bult, used on the civilian market.\n\nThe next Boulton & Paul P.7 Bourges was a prototype British twin-engined biplane day bomber made on the official requirement to replace the DH.10 Amiens, powered by the new ABC Dragonfly radial engines, 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, rated for 200 hp (239 kW) each. It was classic-configuration two-bays biplane with strut-mounted engines, capable of 123.5 mph (107 kn, 199 km/h) at 6,500 ft (1,980 m) 9¼ h of endurance and a practical 15,000 ft (4,600 m) ceiling, which can be reached in 25 min 25 s (max ceiling 20,000 ft (6,100 m)), and a power to mass ratio of 0.10 hp/lb (0.17 kW/kg). It was armed with two .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis guns in the nose and mid-upper position, and carried four 230 lb (105 kg) bombs. Three prototypes were ordered by the Air Ministry, but the first, called Bourges Mk IIA only flew in June 1919, fitted with provisional 230 hp/172 kW) Bentley BR2 rotary engines. It became Bourges Mk IA when fitted with the planned ABC dragonfly engines. It was stable, fast but also extremely sturdy and had unusual acrobatic qualities for a bomber. The second prototype had low-wing mounted engines and gulled upper wing, and the third 1920 Bourges P.7B F2905 was fitted with again new engines, a pair of 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion. It was called the Mark IIIA, but since the requirement had been abandoned, the prototypes served as test planes at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough until 1924. The Bourges was also declined as a civilian airliner.\n\nThe last of these late WW1 company’s models was the Boulton-Paul P.10, a conventional two-seats, one engine biplane made for structural testings. It was the British first all steel aircraft, and first to use plastics as a structural material, Bakelite-Dilecto, which was a hard, synthetic cellulose-formaldehyde compound that had many qualities, like being fire-proof. The fuselage structure used high tensile steel, zinc treated and varnished against corrosion. it was showcased as a knowhow advert at the Paris Salon d’Aeronautique in 1919, but probably never flew.\n\nDunne D.8 (1912)\n\nThe Dunne company made some of the most amazing aircraft in these pioneering years: It was a delta wings biplane, with a pusher configuration. It was designed by aviation pioneer J. W. Dunne. In 1906 and up to 1909 he was working for the Army Balloon Factory (later RAE Farnborough) and designed a swept biplane wing aircraft that can have automatic stability. He buit the D.1 in 1907, followed by the sole D.2 and D.3 prototypes, then the D.4. After 1909 he created the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd. and his first plane was the Dunne D.5, a single prototype powered by a Green 60 hp engine, and which first flew in 1910 and proved to be aerodynamically stable in flight. The Dunne D.8 was a development for military applications. Only four were built, with a Green engine. It flew at the Larkhill Military trial in August 1912, but was not officially part of the competition. In 1913 the plane was refitted with a 80 hp Gnome engine. A further two were ordered by the War Office order, soon cancelled. There were also the Nieuport-Dunne exposed in 1913 and the Burgess-Dunne hydroplane series built in the US.\n\nSage Type 2 (1916)\n\nThis prototype of two-seat biplane fighter aircraft, single-engine with an enclosed cabin was buuilt by Frederic Sage & Co. Limited,\n\ndesigned by Clifford Tinson, which first flew on 10 August 1916. This single prototype was discarded as more advanced models became available. The company was a well-known woodworker, which created a department for plane manufacturing, soon headed by test pilot and designer, E C Gordon England and recruited Clifford Tinson from Bristol. They designed a very small a small wood-and-fabric tractor biplane, and at that time there was still no synchronising gear for the machine-gun, and a hole was cut in the upper wing above the gunners seat for him to stand and man the Lewis gun. It was powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine mated to a four-bladed propeller. It was wrecked during a crash landing but never rebuilt. New planes with synchronized machine-guns appeared indeed.\n\nDe Havilland DH.15 (1919)\n\nAIRCO became De Havilland in 1920. Its first plane was in fact the last Airco prototype, designed as a replacement for the legendary Airco DH.9A of 1918. This was basically and Engine test bed, powered by a B.H.P (Galloway Atlantic) V-12 watercooled, 500 hp engine. It was very stable and sturdy, and can fly at 139 mph (224 km/h), with a service ceiling of 20,000 ft (6,100 m), and rate of climb of 1,500 ft/min (7.62 m/s). It made many test flights in 1919-1920.\n\nEdwards Rhomboidal (1911)\n\nAlthough this model was never a military plane, it’s so strange it is worth mentioning it. Just like other oddities like the swept-wing Dunne, this was an attempt to replace the tail with a particular wing arrangement, in imperfect lozenge, or Rhomboidal. It was designed by E.W. Edwards and flew in 1911, powered by a single Humber 50 hp (37 kW) inline water cooled engine, driving through cranks and chains, two tractor two-bladed propellers. It used wing warping, the wings being tensioned between the ends of the longitudinal girders and the outer ends of the struts by cables forming the wing leading edges. There was no lateral control and the machine was tested at Brooklands in early 1911 but it is not know of its flew.\n\nHoward Wright 1910 Monoplane (1910)\n\nA Wright-type plane made by Howard T Wright, and designed by W.O. Manning. It was derived from the Howard Wright 1909 Monoplane. At least three of these Howard Wright were on display at the 1910 Aero show at Olympia. One was flown by Thomas Sopwith. This tractor monoplane with uncovered wire-braced wooden fuselag was powered by a 40 hp (30 kW E.N.V. water-cooled engine and tested later a polished aluminium spinner. It was flown at the Royal Aero Club’s flying field, Eastchurch on 3 April by Warwick Wright.\n\nLakes Water Bird (1911)\n\nThe Avro-Curtiss design was the first British seaplane. It was built by A.V. Roe Ltd and designed by E.W. Wakefield. It first flew in a conventional wheeled undercarriage with skids and was later reconditioned as a seaplane on 25 November 1911. After Henri Fabre success in 1910, pioneers were concerned to “unstick” their plane, weakly powered, from water. In the US, Glenn Curtiss first flown on 26 January 1911 the first practical seaplane, and A.V.Roe & Co modified a Type D on floats, which flew briefly in November 1911, at Barrow-in-Furness. It was using stepped floats, but was underpowered and just made a “hop” above the water before roughly falling back being damaged in the process. However it was modified, equipped with cylindrical floats and flew 60 times between December 1911 and January 1912. It was used to design the production model Lakes-built Water Hen.\n\nMacfie monoplane (1911)\n\nAnother interesting prewar prototype was the Macfie. It was a small shoulder wing, tractor monoplane powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) J.A.P. V8 engine and had an open-frame fuselage. It was designed and made, and flown by Robert Macfie, and was reminiscent of the Blériot, controlled by wing-warping via wires attached to king posts. But he also envisioned a production model already and his prototype was innovative because of its ease of construction, maintenance and repair. He dropped flying during the war and was an active member of the Landships Committee, militated for the use of caterpillar tracks for an armoured fighting vehicle, submitting many designs of its own.\n\nMersey Monoplane (1911)\n\nThis prototype was designed by Robert C Fenwick/Sydney T Swaby for Planes Limited, made for the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition. However it crashed during trials and was never repaired. Based in Lancashire, W P Thompson of Formby created Planes Limited and hired Frederick Handley Page, creating the Handley Page Type B, later modified by Robert C Fenwick. It was a pusher monoplane, powered by a 45 hp (34 kW) Isaacson radial engine. It was mounted in the nose, while the two-bladed propeller was driven by a long extension shaft ending at the rear. Later Fenwick and Swabey would create their own company, The Mersey Aeroplane Company. Before undergoing military tests, the 1912 plane altready crashed during a test and was rebuilt by Fenwick. But he died in the 13 August 1912 accident.\n\nPaterson Biplane (1910)\n\nDesigned by Compton Cecil Paterson this pusher biplane was built in his own facility, the Liverpool Motor House. It was similar to the Curtiss Biplane, an open-framed pusher with a sturdy steel-tubes tricycle landing gear. It flew on 23 June 1910 but was damaged, helping later Paterson to obtain his aviator’s certificate.\n\nRoe series (1910-1914)\n\nThe Roe series were all experimental prewar triplanes. The Roe I was dubbed as the first all-British plane that ever flew, as all previous flight were made by using French engines. This triplane of 1909 was propelled by a chain-driven HP JAP motorcycle engine which drove a four-bladed propeller. The first “flight” was more of a simple hop. It was made by Alliott Verdon-Roe (E.V. Roe), a British Lancashire aviation pioneer which started as a surveyor in Canada, worked in railways, in a dock, as engineer in various ships, allowing him to see one day an Albatross flying.\n\nBack in UK he had the obsession of creating his own plane. In 1906 he joined the Royal Aero-club as a secretary, and became a draughtsman to represent GLO Davidson’s engines, but he eventually resigned after a passage in the USA. He then started designing planes and won the Daily Mail competition for one of these models in 1907. He started to fly a real size one, the Roe I Biplane based on his winning model at Brooklands in 1907–08. His first recorded flight was made in 8 June 1908.\n\nHis behavior had him antagonize with the management at Brooklands, and he moved later to Walthamstow Marshes, creating his workshop under a railway arch at the end of a viaduct. There, he created his first triplane, dubbed the avroplane, which flew in July 1909. This model became the Roe type II. A replica of it was made in 7 June 2008 at the Brooklands Museum in Surrey. He created with his brother the A.V. Roe Aircraft Co. (Avro) on 1 January 1910, and developed his next models, aimed at the military.\n\nThe Roe II called “Mercury” was in fact the first product of the Avro company, in 1910. It was designed by Alliott Verdon Roe as a sturdier Roe I Triplane and two were built and tested examples. One became Roe’s company advertising plane, and the other was bought by W. G. Windham. Moved by a two-bladed propeller driven by a Green C.4 4-cylinder inline water-cooled, 35 hp (26 kW), the longest “hop” of this model was 600 ft (180 m) at 45 mph (72 km/h; 39 kn). The Roe III was the last of these prototypes, a triplane tailplane with ailerons, two seats and an open-top fuselage of triangular cross-section.\n\nProduction records differed from 3-5 prototype with various ailerons configurations, still powered by a Green engine. One joined the Harvard Aeronautical Society USA, and two were lost by fire en route to the 1910 Blackpool Meeting, later replaced. Avro became one of the most successful British manufacturer to this day. His company built the largest production of planes in WW1 with the Avro 504 (8,300). In the late 1940s, he retired his shares from Avro and created his own company by purchasing S. E. Saunders Co., to create Saunders-Roe, which built the world’s largest floatplane, the Princess.\n\nScottish Aeroplane Syndicate Avis (1910)\n\nThe Avis I or a photo assumed to be such\n\nThe first plane of this unsung pioneering company was made by Howard T Wright (Nothing to do with the Wright brothers) in 1909, together with William Oke Manning for Alan Boyle at Battersea. Influenced by the Blériot design, this single-seat tractor monoplane had an open-air wire-braced wooden fuselage, cabane struts wire bracing, and used wing-warping for lateral control with foot pedals and a stick for elevation. The cabane prolongated downwards to a skids carriage for wheels using shock cords. The tail was cruciform tail, single assembly and articulated on a universal joint. The “Golden Plover” was propelled by a 30 hp (22 kW) Anzani engine which was soon disappointing on trials and replaced by a 35 hp (26 kW) Anzani and a new propeller made by Wright.\n\nIt flew succesfully at Boyle in March 1910 and was sold to Mr Maconie to be used at Brooklands in the summer of 1910. Their Avis II was propelled by a 40 hp (30 kW) J.A.P., exhibited by the Scottist Aeronautical Syndicate at Olympia and used by R.F. Wickham and later lost in a crash. The Avis I name was given to a third prototype, given a 40 hp (30 kW) E.N.V. engine, used by Boyle and lost later at the Bournemouth Air display. An Avis III was bought by racing driver J. H. Spottiswode, and the Avis IV was used by Boyle and resold on auctions when the syndicate was dissolved, at Brooklands, to Eustace Gray from the local press.\n\nSpencer-Stirling biplane (1910)\n\nSpencer-Stirling plane, powered by two props chain-driven by a Berlier engine\n\nA single pusher biplane used by the RNAS. It was designed by Herbert Spencer and first flew on 9 November 1910, of the Farman type. It was later re-enginered with a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome Gamma rotary engine after having tried the unreliable RH 4-cylinder in-line engine, rated at 40–70 hp (30–52 kW). This plane helped Herbert Spencer to obtain his Aviator’s Certificate at Brooklands, and flew several times until it crashed in February 1912, acting as RNAS trainer.\n\nBritish Aircraft Manufacturers in Detail\n\nThe Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited\n\nRather than being named according to the relevant acronym, AMCL, Airco abbreviated as “aircraft company” was perhaps the shortest-lived aircraft manufacturer (1912 to 1920), but produced thousands of planes only for the British military in the span of WW1. If Airco disappeared, it was not the case of all its assets, starting with its famous chief designer, Geoffrey de Havilland. Together with a part of his former team would later form De Havilland, one of the greatest names in British aviation history.\n\nAirco was funded in 1912 by George Holt Thomas in Hendon (north London), which also became one of the first great British dedicated airfields. In 1914, he convinced Geoffrey de Havilland which worked at the Royal Aircraft Factory (Farnborough) to join in as chief designer of the new company. From then on, De Havilland’s would be credited for around 30% of all planes used by the UK and US during the great war. Therefore all Airco models carried the initials “DH”. Also in 1914 William Taylor Birchenough became the company’s celebrated test pilot for the duration of the war.\n\nIn 1918 it promoted itself as the largest aircraft company in the world. The end of the war forced the company to convert to civil trasportation, and the company established the first airline in the UK called Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited. However despite of these numerous surplus aircrafts, there was little interest of the public, and no support of the government. The company was soon unprofitable and was sold in 1920 to the Birmingham Small Arms Company, its assets sold and liquidated soon after. However during the short span of WW1, Airco engineered some of the finest British planes ever put into service.\n\nThe DH.9A, a development of the Airco DH.9 with Liberty engine which first flown in March 1918 was only retired from service in 1931…\n\nAirco production\n\nThe DH.11, last bomber of the company (1918). It was to use the failed ABC Dragonfly radial engine.\n\nThe first great success of Airco was the DH.2 pusher which in 1916 helped to put an end to the domination of the Fokker Eindecker. Other famous models were the prolific DH.6 trainer, and the reliable DH.4/DH.9 light bombers. The DH.9A had a particularly long career postwar and was chosen as the first de Havilland airliners, later developed as the larger DH.16 and DH.18 operated by Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited owned by George Holt Thomas as a subsidiary before ceasing activities in 28 February 1921. The company record were staggering. Not only they claimed to produce 30% of British aircraft production, but they also produced their own engines as well as licensed copies of the Gnome and Le Rhone rotary engines. Airco also built Airships and seaplanes, and had a workforce in 1918 of about 7-8,000 personal spread into the factories, a metal-workshop and machining, materials testing laboratory, and a wind tunnel.\n\nIn addition to the wartime models below, Airco also produced DH.9C (1921), a passenger plane, tested the DH.11 Oxford (1919) a radial engine version of the DH.10, as well as the Airco DH.15 Gazelle (1919) an engine testing DH.9A, the DH.16 (1919) a cabin DH.9A four-seats airliner and the DH.18 (1920) a single-engine with an eight seats cabin.\n\nThe DH.18, last plane of the company. A 8-seats passenger plane, far away ancestor of the De Havilland Dragon.\n\nAirco DH.1:(1915) pusher fighter 100 +70 DH.1A\n\nAirco DH.2 (1915) pusher fighter 453\n\nAirco DH.3 (1916) 2 pusher bomber prototypes (1 DH.3A)\n\nAirco DH.4 (1916) tractor bomber 6,295 (4,846 USA)\n\nAirco DH.5 (1916) tractor fighter 552\n\nAirco DH.6 (1916) tractor trainer 2,280\n\nAirco DH.9 (1917) light bomber 4,091 +DH.9A 1,997\n\nAirco DH.10 Amiens (1918) light bomber twin engines 258\n\nAirco DH.1 (1915)\n\nThe Airco DH.1A was the first production model of the company, a sturdy pusher that helped claiming back the sky for the entente\n\nThe first production aircraft from Airco was somewhat inspired by the “Farman” flown by Britain’s RFC in ww1 but the powerplant which propelled it was anemic at its beginning, and when it was improved to the point of giving the needed speed, the concept was already obsolete. It helped nevertheless to cope with the Fokker scourge, but soon after was reverse to the Middle East or served as a trainer and the Home Defence. Geoffrey de Havilland’s first design was reminiscent of the F.E.2 from his prvious assignment at the Royal Aircraft Factory. The DH.1 was a pusher, with the pilot and observer in tandem cockpits in the nose while the propeller was behind. The observer was stepped down and had a machine gun with a clear field of fire, one great advantage of the pusher formula. The wings were fabric-covered, two-bay structure unstaggered and unswept of equal span. The stabiliser and rudder ended a long pair of open-framework booms. Like the F.E.2b, the Airco DH.1 was designed for the water-cooled Beardmore 120 hp (89 kW) inline engine but since those Beardmore engines were already in high demand and short supply (F.E.2b and R.E.5) the mush smaller air-cooled Renault 70 hp (52 kW) V8 engine was installed in its place.\n\nThe DH.1 prototype was given aerofoils placed each side of the nacelle that cold be rotated to act as air brakes. That proved not the most practical idea and they soon removed. The fixed conventional landing gear in V-struts, used coil springs with oil suspension. Geoffrey de Havilland piloted himseld the DH.1 prototype in January 1915 at Hendon seeing the Renault engine underpowered, but performance was not yet appealing and production was authorized, with a first order 49 planes. The DH.1 production was the shifted from Airco, already engaged on a more promising model, to the Savages Limited Factory, King’s Lynn, a previous fairground equipment manufacturer. The final production planes had a simplified rubber cord suspension, and a revised cockpit coaming. But production was so slow slow that only five were delivered to the RFC by the end of 1915. After this initial batch, which was soon reverse to training, the later production at last received the Beardmore engine and was redesignated DH.1A. despite its performannces equal to the F.E.2b both planes were slated for replacement by tractor types. A 50 DH.1As was placed but by June 1915 at Airco the first single-seat D.H.2 had already flown and became one of the best British fighters for the few month. In all 70 1A were delivered total, which added to the Renault propelled DH.1. made about 99 (100 with the prototype) by Savages factory, but on Airco design.\n\nThe DH.1 was sent to the less risky Middle East theatre, but only Beardmore DH.1As in July 1916, used by No. 14 Squadron of the RFC as B.E.2 escort. They claimed an Aviatik in August 1916 and on 5 March 1917, there was a loss during a bombing raid on Tel el Sheria. The Squadron later converted to R.E.8 in November 1917. Already in 1916 the bulk of the production was used for training. 43 were also reported in service with Home Defence fighter units, and 24 aircraft more before 1918. Apparently the model was also used by the Australian Flying Corps, as No. 1 Squadron operated a single aircraft (no. 4620) from June to July 1916.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDimensions: 8.83 x 12.50 x 3.46 m (28 ft 11⅝ in x 41 ft 0 in x 11 ft 4 in) Wing area: 426 sq ft (39.6 m²)\n\nWeight: 1,356 lb (616 kg) emtpy, 2,044 lb (927 kg) loaded\n\nEngine: Renault Type W, 70 hp (50 kW) 80 mph (70 kn, 130 km/h) climb at 350 ft/min (1.7 m/s)\n\nArmament: 0.303 in (7.70 mm) Lewis machine gun (observer)\n\nAirco DH.2 (1915)\n\nThe Airco DH.2, side view\n\nThe second pushed designed by De Havilland was perhaps better remembered, first as a proper fighter to reach true mass-production, and second to have helped squash the “Fokker scourge”. It was effectively a one-seat version of the previous DH.1 two-seater. Smaller dimensions and weight, helped to reach better performances with the licence-built Gnôme Monosoupape rotary engine rated a 100 hp (75 kW). The need for this plane was naturally the situation in the air over the western front, which urged the need for a single-seat fighter. Before any synchonized system was available, only a forward-firing armament could do the job, therefore pushers became the first fighters. The DH.2 first flew in July 1915 and was armed with a single .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun in the nose. Originally this machine-gun was to be positioned on one of three flexible mountings in the cockpit after transfer in flight. But this system was soon dropped as pilots realized it was much more practical to to aim the aircraft rather than the gun. Higher authorities at first ban the weapon relocation, until a clip allowing it to be released was approved, designed by Major Lanoe Hawker which also devised a gunsight with a ring sight and model helping the gunner in his aiming. The bulk of the large production (by that time) of 430+ planes was taken by the 100 hp (75 kW) Gnôme rotary engine versions, but late production shifted towards 110 hp (82 kW) Le Rhône 9J. models although according to some sources it was only experimental. The nine-cylinder, air-cooled rotary Gnome 100 hp apparently had a tendency for shedding cylinders in midair.\n\nThe Airco DH.2 blueprint\n\nOn 22 June 1915 the prototype DH.2 passe all tests and went in France for operational trials with No.5 RFC Squadron. It was shot down and later repaired by the Germans which also evaluated it. production planes soon arrived in No. 24 Squadron RFC, the first entirely equipped with single-seat fighters in France. It was starting operations in February 1916 and was the first of seven squadrons to use the Airco DH.2 on the Western Front. This model proved to be often superior to the Fokker Eindecker, and showed it especially during the Battle of the Somme. No. 24 Squadron alone revendicated 44 kills. The DH.2 had sensitive controls however, which combined with short training traduced in a high accident rate to the point of being called “The Spinning Incinerator”. As time went by though its qualities of agility were recoignised, the inherent instability being also the result of mounting this kind of rear-mounted rotary engine incidentally helped agility as all good fighter pilot knows. However the advantage it had no longer held when facing newly arrived Halberstadt D.II and Albatros D.I in September 1916. In time, No. 24 and No. 32 Squadron RFC swapped on the Airco DH.5s in June 1917. The last DH.2 remaining in service were then on the quieter Macedonian front, and in Palestine until the fall of 1917. It was afterwards still used as an advanced trainer until the end of the war.\n\nThe Airco DH.2 helped creating the first British aces. Lionel Rees, James McCudden and 13 more aces distinguished themselves and flew the DH.2. Namely Patrick Anthony Langan-Byrne (10 victories), Alan Wilkinson (10), Selden Long (9), Arthur Gerald Knight (8), Eric C. Pashley (8), John Oliver Andrews (7), Sidney Cowan (7), Hubert Jones (7), William Curphey (6), Stanley Cockerell (5). Tactician Oswald Boelcke was killed because of a collision with Erwin Böhme during a dogfight against DH.2s.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDimensions: 7.69 x8.61 x2.91 m (25 ft 2½ in x28 ft 3 in x9 ft 6½ in) Wing area: 249 ft² (23.13 m²)\n\nWeight: 942 lb (428 kg) empty, 1,441 lb (654 kg) loaded\n\nEngine: Gnôme Monosoupape rotary engine, 100 hp (75 kW), 93 mph (150 km/h) at sea level\n\nPerformances: 250 mi (400 km) (2¾ hours) range, 14,000 ft (4,265 m) service ceiling reached at 545 ft/min (166 m/min)\n\nArmament: .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun with 47-round drum magazines\n\nAirco DH.3 (1916)\n\nThe Airco DH.3 prototype on 19 January 1919 apparently\n\nThe Airco DH.3 was the first bomber of the company. Designed in 1916 as a long-range day bomber by Geoffrey de Havilland, it was a quite large twin-engine pusher biplane with three-bay wings but a relatively slender fuselage and curved rudder. The two 120 hp (89 kW) Beardmore were not mounted as in tractor configuration but between the wings as pushers, like previous planes. There were sturdy tailskid landing gears under the wings, and two additional wheels placed beneath the nose to prevent bumping when landing. Three prototypes flew, the first in January or February 1916 as photographic evidence suggests but didn’t get a War Ministry serial number performances were not good enough for the war office. A second prototype designated DH.3A, flew with 160 hp/119 kW Beardmore engines, and was showcased to the war office, with performances good enough this time to trigger an order for 50 soon after. It was cancelled however because strategic bombing was not a priority and twin-engined bombers were thought to be not effective, therefore the two prototypes were mothballed in 1917. In fact, the DH.3 was a victim of Royal Aircraft Factory internal debate early 1916 with British private aircraft manufacturers squabbling over undue ordered planes from the R.A.F. even if their private competitors proved superior in any ways. There was a growing hostility at the War Office to private sector which combined with the belief of large twin-engined aircrafts being impractical, as shown by the poor F.E.4, strategic bombing being dropped as a tactic, but resurrected over time, due to the German bombing campaign over Britain and the D.H.10 appeared. It was a direct development of the DH.3 (March 1918) but arrived too late in production to see any service. Civilian planes based on its cell would be built after the war.\n\nDH.3 blueprint, airwar.ru\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDimensions: 11.23 x 18.54 x 4.42 m (36 ft 10 in x 60 ft 10 in x 14 ft 6 in) Wing area: 793 ft2 (73.67 m2)\n\nWeight: 3,980 lb (1,805 kg) empty, 5,810 lb (2,635 kg) loaded\n\nEngines: Two Beardmore 120 hp (160 hp DH.3A) inline piston engines.\n\nPerformance: Top speed: 95 mph (153 km/h), range: 700 miles (1,130 km), Endurance: 8 hours, climb at 550 ft/min (2.8 m/s)\n\nArmament: Two flexibly mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis guns, 680 lb (308 kg) bomb load.\n\nAirco DH.4 (1916)\n\nAn American DH.4.\n\nDesigned by Geoffrey de Havilland it was a light two-seat tractor biplane, for aerial reconnaissance and light day bombing. it was to be powered by the the brand new Beardmore Halford Pullinger (BHP) engine, rated for 160 hp. It first flew in August 1916, powered by a prototype of the BHP engine that reached 230 hp (170 kW). Tests shown its favourable handling and performance and the Central Flying School (CFS) own evaluations ended with the writing of a very favorable report, praised for its excellent stability, moderately light flying controls good crew positions. it was noted to reach the best climbing rate ever recorded however it also appeared that the BHP engine had flaws that required redesign prior to launching production. This went as far as not planning any schedule for the BHP engine while there was an already available water-cooled Rolls-Royce Eagle, an excellent in-line engine at the end of its development process and offering the same performances and general figures as the BHP. Therefore, in the summer of 1916, the second prototype flew successfully with this Rolls-Royce engine, and this decided the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to place an order in late 1916 while the Royal Navy interest materialized into an order for two prototypes, configured to its own requirements for evaluation. Equally successful trials bring additional orders for the Royal Naval Air Service.\n\nDH.4 in the sky of France\n\nThe DH.4 was a two bay biplane tractor of all-wooden construction, traditional materials but treated plywood for the fuselage a 3mm skin, which made it both strong and lightweight? Therefore cross-bracing owas limited to the rear cockpit area. However the nose cowling designed for the rather long Beardmore Halford Pullinger (BHP) proved roomy for the Rolls-Royce Eagle. In addition to both engines, the American Liberty was used, but also depending of the manufacturer, the RAF3A, Siddeley Puma and even Fiat engine. In all cased, the propeller was four-bladed while Cooling depended of an oval-shaped frontal intake and port-mounted exhaust manifold above the upper wing. The inversion of the engine was also carried out in some production models for the tall Richardo-Halford-Armstrong (RHA) supercharged engine in order to clear the pilot’s view. The observer was separated from the pilot by as space between which the fuel tank was positioned. This large gap caused in-flight communication problems and speaking tube fitted later proved useless in most situations. American-built planes had the pilot’s and observer’s seating and fuel tank swapped which improved communication and the pilot chances of survival in a crash.\n\nCivilian DH.4B in flight in the 1920s\n\nThe armament consisted in a single pilot’s forward-firing synchronised Vickers machine gun and one or a twin mount with a lighter and handier .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis guns on the scarff ring around the observer cockpit. The bomb load was about 460 lb (210 kg) on external racks. Some time later, an additional Vickers gun was tried, as well as a COW 37 mm guns a few days before the end of the war. The numerous DH.4 available after the war made the delight of private owners and regional airlines. The DH.4 was also modified as a seaplane for the navy, fitted with two large floats, and prototypes tested at Felixstowe before the end of the war.\n\nDH.4 of early production\n\nIn late 1916, the first batch of fifty with their 250 hp (186 kW) Eagle III engines were accepted by RFC, with a single synchronized 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun for the pilot, and a Scarff ring mounted 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun for the observer. Airco soon received more orders and couldn’t cope with these. Therefore, production was passed on F.W. Berwick and Co, Glendower Aircraft Company, Palladium Autocars, Vulcan Motor and Engineering, Westland Aircraft Workand a total of 1,449 aircraft were delivered at V-day out of the total 1,700 aircraft ordered, in UK alone for the RFC and RNAS. Indeed, SABCA of Belgium produced 15 more in 1926, but USA also did their share. As the Bolling Commission investigated for readily-available planes for the expeditionary force, the DH.4 impressed the board and was chosen, for direct use and production licence and tooling in the United States. The other ones picked by the commission were the Bristol F.2 Fighter, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5, and French SPAD S.XIII. If a DH.4 was evaluated from the summer of 1917, it was not until 1918 that the first American DH-4s leaved the factory floor from several manufacturers, Boeing, Dayton-Wright, Fisher Body Corporation, and Standard Aircraft Corporation. Over 1,000 modifications were incorporated into the design compared to the original. So much so that a grand total of 9,500 DH-4s were delivered of which 1,885 reached France in time for operations. The Liberty engine was adopted for this version and would also eventually propelled the DH.9A in UL as well. After the war, American-built DH.4s in surplus would be modified by Boeing up to the DH-4B standard (Boeing Model 16), with 111 delivered in 1920, half being refurbished later and in 1923, another Boeing version with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage designated DH-4M-1 and Atlantic Aircraft’s DH-4M-2 were produced while some DH-4M-1s were converted into dual-control trainers (DH-4M-1T), target tugs (DH-4M-1K) while the USMC took delivery of modified O2B-1s and night O2B-2 which until the crash of wall street.\n\nWright-radial DH-4B of the US Air Force after the war\n\nWith time, DH.4s were fitted with better versions of the Eagle engine such as the 375 hp (280 kW) Eagle VIII which became standard in the end of 1917 despite grossly mismanagements and chronical shortages. This left engineers to investigate for alternatives, and included naturally the BHP (230 hp/170 kW), RAF3A (200 hp/150 kW) Siddeley Puma (230 hp/170 kW) and even the 260 hp (190 kW) Fiat which made their way to production aircraft but none matched the outstanding Eagle engine.\n\nThe DH.4 enjoyed a fairly long career, helped by its legendary reliability, quality and durability, performances and love by its crew. Entering service in January 1917, with No. 55 Squadron, two more squadrons in May 1917, then six squadrons by the fall of the year with the RFC’s will to launch retaliatory bombing raids on German. Russia was an early and happy customer of the DH.4, with 50 of them by September 1917. The RNAS was equally satisfied with the DH.4 starting with No. 2 Squadron in May 1917. In addition to France, they were also used over Italy, patrolling the Aegean front and Otranto barrage. During one of many RNAS coastal patrols Major Egbert Cadbury and Captain Robert Leckie shot down Zeppelin L70 on 5 August 1918. Later on, four DH.4s sank UB 12 on 19 August 1918. The DH.4 is considered by experts today the best British one-engine light bomber in service in WW1. The crews in particular loved its speed and altitude that made it immune to German fighters. It was never escorted, and the feat was repeated by the Mosquito of ww2 fame.\n\nBy the fall of 1918 RFC’s equipment of DH.4 began to fade as engines were in short supply, production switching to the disappointing DH.9 instead and replacement by the far better DH.9A with an American Liberty engine available in very large numbers. In June 1918 DH.4s of 55 Squadron performed strategic bombing raids over Germany in daylight, flying in wedge formations, for the leader to guide bombing drops and having the advantage of a massed defensive fire. This unit accused losses, but operated without replacement as these were the lowest of all units in operation in November 1918. Many were converted after the war for passenger transport, with enclosed cabins. The list of operators included also Argentina (civilian service) Australia (idem), Belgium (Aviation Militaire Belge), Canada, Chile, Cuba, Greece, Iran, Mexico, Nicaragua, New Zealand, South Africa, Soviet Union, Spain, and Turkey (postwar!).\n\nOne of the numerous civilian versions postwar, this CAM 2 served with the US airmail by the Robertson Aircraft Corp. by 1926\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDimensions: 9.35 x13.21 x3.35 m (30 ft 8 in x 43 feet 4 in x 11 ft) Wing area: 434 ft² (40 m²)\n\nWeight: 2,387 lb (1,085 kg) empty, 3,472 lb (1,578 kg) fully loaded.\n\nEngine: Rolls-Royce Eagle VII inline liquid cooled piston 375 hp (289 kW)\n\nPerformances: Top speed 143 mp (230 km/h), range: 470 mi (770 km), endurance: 3/4 hr, ceiling: 22,000 ft (6,700 m), climb in 1,000 ft/min (305 m/min)\n\nArmament: .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers, rear 1/2 Lewis gun (observer), 460 lb (210 kg) of bombs.\n\nAirco DH.5 (1916)\n\nModern replica DH.5 in New Zealand\n\nDe Havilland designed the Airco DH.5 combining a classic tractor biplane with better forward visibility inherited from the pushers. The main planes indeed were 27 inches separated, the upper one being more backward, to free frontal vision for the pilot, his vision no longer cluttered by the upper plane. The prototype had a forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun was given a system allowing to fire it both upwards or to change its angle in flight. The production model would go for a fixed mounting on top of the cowl but offset to the left. The main fuel tank was installed behind the cockpit and below the oil tank for gravity, with another gravity fuel tank over the top main plane offset to the right.\n\nThe DH.5 prototype started trials in December 1916 whereas the Sopwith Camel and RAF S.E.5 were about also to enter service. The DH.5 however proved inferior to the earlier Sopwith Pup, compounded by the use of a single machine gun when two were mandatory. It was nevertheless trusted enough to be ordered from four manufacturers, starting with the bulk of the production by Airco (200), British Caudron (50), Darracq (200) and March, Jones & Cribb (100). The DH.5 rapidly proved unpopular in 1917, compounded by alleged handling difficulties and poor performance at high altitude, with a tendency to fall rapidly when in action.The upper main plane was also a blind spot to the rear and weak point as most attacks came from that angle in 1917. However the DH.5 was both robust, good at low altitude with an excellent forward field and it was discovered it excelled best as strafing attack plane, showing excellent performances in the Battle of Cambrai. The DH.5 served also with the No. 2 Squadron Australian Flying Corps, the first Australian fighter squadron also for ground-attack until December 1917. In 1918 all DH.5 in service were being replaced by the S.E.5a in January 1918 and gradually moved to training units briefly before being removed RFC service.

In 1914-1917 the company’s models were famously designed by Dutch designer Frederick Koolhoven (prefix “F.K.”). Best sellers were the FK3 and FK 8 observation and general purpose planes, but AW also tried a quadruplane fighter, the FK9, without much success. The company later moved to civilian planes, and was eventually merged with Armstrong Siddeley which also comprised the Gloster Aircraft Company and Hawker Aircraft. Now it’s Hawker Siddeley.\n\nThe first plane of the company was the result of the British War Office asking W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd to manufacture aeroplanes and aircraft engines for the Army. Soon after the department was set up and Frederick Koolhoven in (formerly head of British Deperdussin design), a small, single-seat scout aircraft was soon created. Of single-bay tractor configuration the F.K.1 and balanced elevators and no fixed tailplane. It was powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnôme although a 80 hp had been originally planned, in short supply. Koolhoven flew it personnally in September 1914 but as suspected it was underpowered. Modifications included a fixed tailplane, enlarged ailerons but since the superior Sopwith Tabloid and Bristol Scout were available the army delined any order. The “Sissit” was abandoned. For the next model however, the Dutch designer simply “borrowed” the Aircraft Factory B.E.2c design already produced under licence and modified it in some points; it was a success, produced to around 500 as the F.K.3. The next F.K.4 was a paper project, just like the F.K.2, but the F.K.5 and 6 were built, as experimental triplanes to serve as escort fighters, answering to a 1916 War office specification. The FK5 never flew, modified with the gunner’s nacelles slung under the middle wing, shorter and a deeper fuselage, and conventional tailskid. Four were ordered in April but only one built, showing poor performances, whereas synchronized MGs were now available, and the whole program ended.\n\nThe next F.K.8 was a simple “copy-paste, repeat” of the F.K.3. It was a conventional, sturdy, all-purpose two-seater biplane powered by a Beardmore 120 hp 6-cylinder inline piston engine, 160 hp (112 kW). About 1,650 were manufactured, which served long after the war for the company Qantas, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Paraguay. The previous F.K.7 has been planned as a replacement for both the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and the Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3. introducing basic dual controls for the pilot and observer. It flew in May 1916, but for marketing purposes when pitted against the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 it was renamed F.K.8. and ordered in quantities. The next F.K.9 and F.K.10 were interesting escort fighter designed as quadruplanes, the only ones in service with the RFC (Photo).\n\nThis oddball only saw one prototype for the RFC (with a 110 hp (80 kW) Clerget 9Z engine) and eight of pre-production test F.K.10, featuring a revised fuselage and tail, with a 130 hp (100 kW) Clerget 9B/Le Rhône 9J engines. The initial order of 50 was dropped after testing the first batch (see later for details). The next wartime model of the company was the Armadillo, this time designed by Koolhoven successor, Fred Murphy. It was a private-venture project, centered around the promising Bentley BR2 rotary engine. It was more to test the skills of the new design team rather than a response to an official requirement. It was a two-bay biplane with a square section fuselage, with two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns fitted on the cowl and synchronized, in January 1918. It made its first flight in April 1918 and compared badly to the Sopwith Snipe because of its poor view from the cockpit. It led to the more advance Ara, postwar (first flight 1919) of which two prototypes were built and tested but dropped because grave issues with the new ABC Dragonfly engine.\n\nAW Models:\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.1 (1914)”Sissit” (1)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.2 (1915) (8)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.3 (1915) (500)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.6 (1916) (2)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.8 (1916) “Big Ack” (1,650)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.9/10 (1916-17) “Quadriplane” (9)\n\nArmstrong Whitworth Armadillo (1)\n\nAirship R25\n\nAirship R29\n\nAirship R33\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.3 (1915)\n\nThis two-seat general-purpose biplane was designed by Dutch designer Frederick Koolhoven. It was a near-copy of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, already built by AW for the Royal Flying Corps. Th first prototype was flown in 1915 by Norman Spratt, powered by a 70 hp (52 kW) air-cooled Renault 70 hp V-8. It was made simpler than its inspiration plane, by eliminating welded joints and complex metal components in the structure. To test the concept, seven aircraft were built, retrospectively called FK.2 sometimes. It was rejected by the RFC as offering little advantage over the BE2C; therefore Armstrong Whitworth worked on an improved version, with a new fin and rudder, a more effective field of fire for the observer, straight leading edge, no horn balance, and a 90 hp (67 kW) RAF 1a engine, derived from the Renault engine. The new FK.3 flown at Upavon in May 1916 and this time estimated superior to the BE2C on all accounts but the loading capacity despite its formula was already obsolescent. 150 were ordered by the RFC to AW, while 350 more were ordered to Hewlett & Blondeau Limited at Luton. The arly and later version could be distinguished by their rams’ horns forward stubs, which replaced their initial twin high exhaust pipes exiting above the upper wing. Later during production, RAF engines were in short supply, therefore 12 planes were tested with the new heavier 120 hp (90 kW) six-cylinder inline water cooled Beardmore 120 hp and span was increased by 2 ft (610 mm) to compensate. They were converted back with RAF engine as soon as they were available. Oddly these planes were never deployed operationally in France (FK.8 were preferred), but kept mostly for training and reserve units in UK, with the No. 43, 47, 53, 55 and 63 Squadron RFC. Only those of the 47 Squadron at Salonika operated this model in action, which was obsolete by early 1918. The bulgarians captured one, and the Australian Flying Corps No. 3 Squadron AFC also used this model for training.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions: Length: 29 ft (8.84 m), Wingspan: 40 ft (12.19 m), Height: 11 ft 11 in (3.63 m)\n\nEmpty weight: 1,386 lb (629 kg), Max. takeoff weight: 2,056 lb (983 kg)\n\nEngine: 1 × RAF 1A inline piston engine, 90 hp (67 kW)\n\nPerformance: Top speed: 77 kn (89 mph, 143 km/h) at sea level\n\nService ceiling: 12,000 ft (3,660 m), Endurance: 3hr\n\nArmament: 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun, rear observer cockpit/up to 112 lb (51 kg) bombs, single seater version\n\nArmstrong Whitworth F.K.8 (1916)\n\nThis British two-seat general-purpose biplane served alongside the R.E.8 until the end of the war. 694 F.K.8s have been delivered, 1650 total, counting exports and postwar production. It was designed by Frederick Koolhoven to replace the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and FK.3. It was more powerful (160 hp (110 kW) Beardmore water-cooled engine), larger, sturdier, had oleo-pneumatic landing gear, a scarff-mounted MG Lewis, and the rudder had a rudder featuring a long, pointed horn-balance. It was also serial-fitted with dual controls in case the pilot was injured, for the observer to take control. Outside the Armstrong Whitworth synchronization mechanism, not reliable, the plane used at an early stage the Arsiad interrupter gear and Constantinescu gear. Bt the plane had many teething problems like a weak oleo undercarriage and blocked radiators.\n\nThe tail was modified also and the wings, gunner’s seat and exhaust system were revised, nose cowling and radiators too lately so there were three distinct production versions over time. Nicknamed “Big Ack”) it proved effective and dependable, was liked for its crew and trusted upon to led reconnaissance missions as well as strafing and ground attacks or night bombing. The prototype flew in late 1916 and it arrived first at 35 Squadron RFC, in January 1917. It served well in France, Macedonia, Palestine, for home defence. It was able to carry six 40 lb (20 kg) phosphorus smoke bombs, four 65 lb (29 kg) bombs or two 112 lb (51 kg) bombs on underwing racks and the pilot was given a forward-firing .303 in Vickers machine gun. By the early 1920s these planes had been all discarded. Some served for much more years afterwards with QANTAS in Australia, the small Kingdom of Hejaz AF or Paraguay.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions: Length: 31.5 ft (9.58 m), Wingspan: 43.6 ft (13.26 m), Height: 10 ft 11 in (3.33 m)\n\nEmpty weight: 1,916 lb (869 kg), Max. takeoff weight: 2,811 lb (1275 kg)\n\nEngine: Beardmore 6-cyl engine, 160 hp (112 kW)\n\nPerformance: Top speed: 83 kn (95 mph, 153 km/h) at sea level\n\nService ceiling: 13,000 ft (3,960 m), Endurance: 3hr\n\nArmament: 1x .303 Vickers FF, 1x 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun (observer), up to 224 lb bombs\n\nAvro\n\nEarly History\n\nThe Avro company is a familiar one in British History, forging so many of memorable plane over decades of engineering imagination. In the cold war, Avro forged the “V” bombers, an infamous family that assured British dissuasion power during the early cold war, and made the equally successful Lancaster in WW2, pioneered pilot-less fighters and missiles as well as the Concorde. But its started as A.V. Roe and Company on 1 January 1910 at Brownsfield Mill, Great Ancoats Street, Manchester. The company was funded by Alliott Verdon Roe and his brother Humphrey Verdon. Alliot constructed a successful aircraft, the Roe I Triplane “Bullseye” which was followed by early production models such as the Avro E or Avro 500 (March 1912, 18 built) for the RFC which had just been created. The world’s first enclosed cockpit also was pioneered in 1912, and the monoplane Avro Type F and biplane Avro Type G also appeared this year as prototypes. The Avro 504 (September 1913) was evaluated by the War Office and entered service in the early months of the war first as observation plane, then for training aircraft. Amazingly it remained in that role until 1933, with a production which lasted 20 years and 8,340 produced also by Hamble, Failsworth, Miles Platting and Newton Heath. Nothing came close in this area but De Havilland’s Tiger Moth.\n\nThe Roe Bulls eye triplane, 1911, one of the first production of the firm, and the Type F and G.\n\nIt should be noted that the company also tested a pusher in april 1915, the Avro 508, drew plans for a new seaplane, the 509, produced six 510 seaplanes in July 1914 for the RNAS, tested a fast scouting aircraft, the 511, later 514 in 1914, tested and produced four Avro 519 in 1916, two 523 Pike, two 529, two Avro 533 Manchester bombers, a single two-seat fighter Avro 521 in late 1915 and Avro 527 in 1916, but also a reconnaissance model for the RNAS (Avro 528), another 2-seats biplane 530 in 1917, a prototype one-seat fighter Avro 531 Spider in 1918\n\nThe firm produced during the war a dozen interesting models of prototypes, ranging from single-seat fighters to four engine bombers, like this Avro 529 of April 1917.\n\nThe legendary Avro 504\n\nAvro 504\n\nAlthough the company Avro will turn a hundred types of planes before being absorbed into Hawker Siddeley Aviation in 1963 and disappear as a name, its most iconic model before, through and after WW1 would remain the 504. This very plane totalled 8,970 during the war and production went on for almost 20 years (10,000 from 1913 until 1932). It was by all means the most-produced aircraft of any kind during the great war, and one of the most produced airplane worldwide prior to WW2. And this fantastic twits of fate proceeded from humble beginnings, the Avro 500 of 1912.\n\nEarly Models\n\nAvro 500 (12 built)\n\nThe first production model designed by Alliott Verdon Roe was the 500, which made its fist flight on March, 3, 1912. It was a development of the Type E biplane, a prototype which was developed in parallel to the Avro Duigan. The latter was tailored by Roe as a two-seats tractor biplane for the pioneer Australian aviator John Robertson Duigan in 1911. It was powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) E.N.V. V-8 motor for 40 mph (65 km/h) and later after reconstruction by a 50 h (37 kW ) Gnome engine. It was considered as a basis for the 500. The latter was a single seat biplane with the same characteristics, but crucially, a 60 hp (45 kW) E.N.V. meeting success in 1912. If at first the prototype’s top speed and rate of climb were not impressive, the pilot was dithyrambic about its agility and other corners of flight. The second prototype used a lighter 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome air-cooled rotary engine and flew on 8 May 1912. It was able to climb to 2,000 ft (610 m) in five minutes and later covered 17 miles (28 km) in 20 minutes. This met the War Office requirements for a “Military Aircraft” published for the Military Aeroplane Competition. Therefore an order was placed for two more, and later the model renamed the Avro 500, received nine more orders, including five single-seats. In addition to the No. 3, 4 and 5 Squadrons of the RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service, a single plane was purchased to serve with the Portuguese Air Force.\n\nAvro 501/503 (3)\n\nVery close to the Avro Type H, the 501 and 503 were early British military seaplanes developed from the succeful Avro 500 design. They were designed as amphibious planes, with a single large main float and wheels under the fuselage. The first flew over Windermere in January 1913, later rebuilt in a twin-float configuration and tested further by the British Admiralty and later converted. The improved version, type 503 impressed the Inspector of Naval Aircraft, order three, and later Avro showcased it to the Imperial German Navy staff in June 1913. One was purchased for evaluation and flew from Wilhelmshaven to Heligoland in September 1913, later licence-built by Gotha as the WD.1 or Wasser Doppeldecker-1 while others were turned (without licence) by Albatros, AGO, and Friedrichshafen and later were eventually given to the Ottoman Empire during the war after being declared obsolete. So in all five airplanes of both types were produced. These single-seat biplanes were propelled by a Gnome Omega Omega 14-cyl two row air-cooled rotary piston engine, 100 hp (75 kW) which gave them a top speed of 55 mph (89 km/h).\n\nSuccess story: The 504\n\nIt seems amazing that only after producing a dozen Avro of all models for the military, the firm should be entrusted to turn so many of the next iteration in the lineage. This process however took some time before the merits of the plane were fully recognized. It first flew on 18 September 1913, at that time powered by an 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome Lambda. This was a proven seven-cylinder rotary engine. It was designed for training and private flying, a reliable two-bay all-wooden design with a solid square-section fuselage. Although not revolutionary, this made for a sturdy, dependable and very stable aircraft. In particular it was given the trademark of training planes of that era to prevent bad landings, a central ski fitted between the wheels, called “tooth pick”. It was of course, declined in two and one-seat versions, and largely deployed by Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) before the war. It was sent in France soon and rapidly became the #1 British military plane in availability, performing many useful tasks like observation outside training. One Avro 504 became the first British plane to be shot down, on 22 August 1914.\n\nAlso in November 1914, several 504s took off from from Belfort in north-eastern France to perform the first bombing attack against Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen (Lake Constance). They carried then four 20 lb (9 kg) bombs each and the mission was a success. Later on, because of a growing number of encounters, the Avro 504 was armed with the Lewis gun, with a Foster mount for night fighting. This model was known as the Avro 504K. There were many other wartime variants. The most famous and current were the 504K and 504J. Both were equipped with 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome or 110 hp (80 kW) Le Rhône because of shortages, and these models ended in the Home Defence squadrons of the RFC by 1917. In Russia, White Russian Type 504 captured became Soviet planes, rapidly copied like th U-1 in the early 1920s, leading later to the ubiquitous Polikarpov Po-2. In Japan it became the Y"
