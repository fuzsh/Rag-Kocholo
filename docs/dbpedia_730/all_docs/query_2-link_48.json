        "text": "Members of the Gene Regulation and Inheritance Program share an interest in uncovering the mechanisms governing inheritance of cell state as well as mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and on understanding how those mechanisms are altered in cancer cells. The Program has three main focus areas: (1) elucidating fundamental mechanisms governing the regulation of non-coding RNAs, transcription, and cell inheritance; (2) determining how transcriptional and post-transcriptional control are dysregulated in cancer; and (3) developing therapeutic agents and biological systems to target pro-tumorigenic alterations in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. The Program also has expertise in computational analysis of gene expression patterns, mRNA splicing, and mutation identification which is being used to uncover alterations that drive aberrant gene regulation and impact all three focus areas. Program members combine cell, molecular biology, biochemical, structural biology, computational, and genetic approaches. The Program is enhanced by the excellent Cancer Center Shared Resources, especially the Animal, Sequencing Technologies & Analysis, Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, and Mass Spectrometry Shared Resources."
