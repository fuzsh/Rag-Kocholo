        "text": "My great grand uncle Walter James Robinson, worked for a long time at Boulton Paul Aircraft, Codsall as a Chief Inspector and was one of 30 people aboard an airship, the R34, to make the first non-stop transatlantic crossing in 1919.\n\nHe was born in 1893 in Norwich and died in 1961 in Wrottesley, Wolverhampton.\n\nR34 Transatlantic Crossing\n\n2–6 July 1919: Two weeks after Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic airplane flight, the Royal Air Force rigid airship R 34 landed at Mineola, Long Island, New York, completing the first east-to-west Atlantic crossing by air.\n\nThe airship was under the command of Major George Herbert Scott, A.F.C., R.A.F. The total complement, including passengers, was 30 persons.\n\nThe 108 hour, 12 minute flight started from East Fortune Airship Station near Edinburgh, Scotland at 2:38 a.m., British Summer Time (1:38 a.m., Greenwich mean time) on Wednesday, 2 July. R 34 arrived at Mineola at 9:54 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (1:54 p.m. G.M.T.) on Sunday, 6 July.\n\nAccording to records of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the distance flown by R 34 was 5,797 kilometers (3,602 miles). On arrival, the airship had only 40 minutes of fuel remaining.\n\nR101 Disaster\n\nWalter James Robinson escaped death in the R101 disaster when he gave up his place to an American.\n\nThe R101, which was built at Cardington, Bedfordshire, crashed on 5 October 1930 near Beauvais, France.\n\nAt the time the R101 was the largest airship ever built.\n\nThe craft set off from Cardington on 4 October en route to Karachi but crashed just a few hours later, killing 48 of the 55 passengers and crew.\n\nAmong the dead was aviation minister Lord Thomson of Cardington, who had pushed for the government to promote airship building."
