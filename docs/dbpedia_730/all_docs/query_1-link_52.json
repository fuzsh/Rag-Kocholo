        "text": "On 5th July, 1940, three Spitfires of 64 Squadron took off from Kenley at 7.55pm, for a reconnaissance patrol over Northern France.\n\nThey were flown by Flying Officer Taylor, Sub-Lieutenant Dawson-Paul and Pilot Officer Douglas Keith Milne (in Spitfire Ia, P9449). They encountered enemy aircraft over Rouen and in the ensuing engagement, Dawson-Paul shot down a Me109, though his aircraft was damaged and he limped in to Hawkinge. Only Taylor made it back to Kenley at 9.15pm that evening. Sadly, Pilot Officer Milne failed to return.\n\nHaving lost his life a few days before the official beginning of The Battle of Britain, Milne is not remembered as one of “The Few.”\n\nDouglas Milne was the fifth son of Mr. and Mrs. William Milne of Temple Hall, Meigle. He and his brothers appear to have been active members of the Meigle Wolf Cubs, performing a sketch entitled, “Wolf Cubs to the Rescue” in a scout concert in April 1927. He won a prize for Art in 1932, while studying at Alyth Public School.\n\nDouglas Milne was granted a short service commission as Acting Pilot Officer on 2nd September, 1939, (Gazetted 19/9/1939).\n\nAs Douglas Milne has no known grave, his name is inscribed on the Runnymede memorial and also appears on the Meigle War Memorial at the entrance to Victory Park, Meigle, Perth and Kinross. It is interesting to note that P/O William Milne, a flying instructor killed on 7th February, 1942, is also remembered on the Meigle War Memorial, though it is not known if the two men were related.\n\nRest in peace Sir and thank you for your service."
