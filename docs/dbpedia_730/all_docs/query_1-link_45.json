Dad said that British planes used hydraulic switches but the American ones were electric  He saw the other ground crew member do something with the joystick on the Kittyhawk, then saw the spark but could do nothing about it, too late. Injury thought to have occurred Late Jan early Feb 1942. Dad told me a little story which made me chuckle  When they got back to port after the war, Gourock near Glasgow, the same port he had left from, the dockers went on strike as they were about to disembark. Our armed services, battle-hardened men who had not been home for years, gave the Glaswegians five minutes to change their minds  They did, within 2 minutes! 135\n\nDrake (Sqn Ldr)\n\nDFC and Bar, DSO\n\nBilly 39095 RAF 25/5/42 15/1/43 3302 SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 28 JULY, 1942, Bar to DFC\n\nActing Squadron ^ Leader Billy DRAKE, D.F.C.

He has participated in a large number\n\nof varied sorties and has displayed skill, courage and tenacity of a high order. On three occasions in April, 1945, Flight Lieutenant Hirons led small formations of aircraft in attacks on various targets in the battle area. On one occasion the target was a fortified factory and four gun sites. The attack was well pressed home. The factory was\n\ndemolished and the gun sites, rendered useless. On another occasion the target consisted of several field guns well placed for defense and which were giving considerable trouble to our ground forces. Flight Lieutenant Hirons led his section into the attack with great skill. As a result three of the gun positions we're put out of action. In other sorties this determined pilot has been responsible for destructive attacks on much mechanical transport, several barges and a number of locomotives. He has at all times displayed the greatest\n\ncoolness and set a splendid example to all.\n\n216 HOARE BRIAN PATRICK 404365 RNZAF 26/11/41 8/2/42 KIA, BNF, Flight Sergeant B. P.

Flying Officer Oliver Green and Flying Officer R. B. Whittington of this Flight arrived at Sidi Hanaish from Heliopolis on 12 December while Flight Lieutenant Scoular and Sergeant E. N. Woodward arrived on 16 December. At this later date, Flying Officer Jack Hamlyn had already been detached to 112 Squadron, flying his first known sortie on 13 December.\n\nIn February 1941, he led K Flight to East Africa, moving up to the front on 13 February, 1941\n\nOn 22 February 1941 K flight saw its first action since its return to operations when Scoular on an early patrol over Mersa Taclai in Gladiator N5828 saw some Blenheims passing and escorted these to Massawa. There he spotted a lone S.79 in flight, and shot it down. There is no Italian record of this loss and it may in fact have been a transport Savoia.\n\nIn April the flight formed the nucleus of 250 Squadron, re-equipped with Tomahawks and he was promoted Squadron Leader to command. He was to lead the unit in the Western Desert during the Battleaxe and Brevity offensives, where he made further claims to become 1st CO of 250 Sqdn, He left the RAF as a Wing Commander, subsequently joining Rolls-Royce.

Although the ground echelon arrived in Singapore, by the time the air echelon, aboard HMS Indomitable, was within flying off range, there were no airfields left in British hands, so the squadron flew off to Java on 27 January 1942. Both echelons met up again on 2 February at Palembang in Sumatra, but a further withdrawal to Java was required following the Japanese invasion of Sumatra. By mid February 1942, the situation regarding serviceability was so grave, that No 232 was merged with No 242 and its ground crews were evacuated to Ceylon. Here they were re-allocated to other units and No 232 ceased to exist on 25 February.\n\nThe squadron reformed at Atcham on 10 April 1942 as a Spitfire unit becoming operational in May. In August it moved to Debden, from where it flew offensive sweeps over France, but in September it moved to Turnhouse and began preparing for overseas deployment once again. Leaving the UK in November, the ground echelon arrived in Gibraltar, being joined by the aircrew and aircraft in December.

When the Germans and Italians sent aircraft to assist the revolt, staging from Vichy French bases in Lebanon and Syria, the British sent two RAF 84 Sqdn. Bristol Blenheims to bomb the air base at Palmyra on May 14, escorted by two Tomahawks of No. 250 Squadron, RAF, flown by Flying Officers G.A. Wolsey and F.J.S. Aldridge. The Iraqi revolt was crushed by May 30,\n\nHe sees more action on the 16th all with 250 Sudan Sqdn.\n\nhttp://users.cyberone.com.au/\n\nclardo/cfr_clark.html\n\nBill Bairds log (211 Sqdn Blenheims) records this sortie in similar terms:\n\n16th May '41 0930 L4910 Sgt Marshall pilot, Sgt Clark Obs., self as W/op.AG\n\nTo Nicosia Cyprus escorting 2 Tomahawks - time l hour 30, returning 1530 to base in the same time.\n\nWhen 250 Squadron was withdrawn to the Delta in mid May, this small flight was detached for duty in Cyprus: FO Wolsey and PO Caldwell (later Group Captain CR Caldwell DSO, DFC & Bar). The nature of the 211 Squadron escort duty (navigating) perhaps reflects the long over-water leg. Not impossible to navigate in single-seaters but somewhat risky, as the various tragedies trying to get aircraft into Malta attest.\n\nHowever, navigation was not the sole purpose of the jaunt. The 211 Squadron ORB records this as the only duty that day:\n\nAqir May 16th Sgt Pilot Marshall with Sgts Clark & Baird in Blenheim L4910 [a Mark I] escorted two Tomahawks to to CYPRUS and took ground guns and ammunition to our forces there. The Blenheim returned the same day.\n\nShores' Dustclouds... pp 186-187 provides the clincher on the 250 Squadron pilots:\n\nFri 16 May [...] A Blenheim of 211 Squadron escorted Flg Officer Wolsey and Plt Officer Caldwell to Cyprus, where they were to be ready to defend the island against air attack.\n\n473 Woods Paddy ? ? ? ? . 474 Woodward (Sgt) E Norman\n\n566289\n\n.\n\n3/1/40\n\n31/8/40\n\n.\"K\" Flight 475 Woolley (Rigger) Frank W 645591 RAF 16/5/39 ??/6/41 Taken POW, on Crete 476 Worbey (Flt Sgt ) Stanley Thomas 174081 RAFVR 6/2/43 13/3/44 Stanley Worbey was transferred to No.3 Squadron, now flying Tempests, on April 30 1945 he was shot down and killed by Flak at Schwerin Airfield.
