Previously, Danielson was a faculty member in the engineering program for almost 10 years after serving as an associate dean and department chair at Arizona State University for more than 15 years. He is a registered Professional Engineer with more than 44 years of broad-based experience encompassing both industry and academia. Past industrial experience includes design of machinery, machine installation, engineering management, and plant start-up while working for Crown Zellerbach, a forest products company. Academic experience includes serving as department chair at two different universities, North Dakota State University and Arizona State University. Academic experience includes developing new academic programs, obtaining external grants and contracts, publishing, and teaching. Service to the profession has included leadership roles in four national professional organizations - ABET, ASEE, ASME, and SME. He is a past chair of the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission and is a program evaluator for both EAC and ETAC for multiple professional societies. He also served as the director of the Engineering Technology Area Delegation, which included being a member of the ABET Board of Directors. He was awarded ABET Fellow status in 2022.
