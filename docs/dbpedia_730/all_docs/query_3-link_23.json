        "text": "Biography\n\nEducation: Dr. Scott Burgess began his academic career as an undergraduate student, graduating from Oregon State University. Served 27 years in the US Army, and graduated from the US Army Command and Staff College and the USAF Air Command and Staff College. He earned a Master of Aeronautical Science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University while at RAF Lakenheath in the UK, and Ph.D. from Northcentral University. Now, Dr. Burgess continues that academic career as a full-time faculty member in the Worldwide Campus, College of Aviation, Department of Flight.\n\nExperience:\n\nDr. Burgess' 36+ years of aviation experience includes both military and civil aviation organizations.\n\nQualified on seven military and civilian helicopters (among them, the Schweizer 269, Robinson R-22, AH-1 Cobra, UH-1 Huey, OH-58 Kiowa,\n\nSeveral years as Liaison Officer flying in an F-15E Strike Eagle as a functioning Weapons Systems Officer).\n\nStrategic airlift aircraft deployments, and even exiting them in flight.\n\nBuilt extensive experience in small UAS' with the Dept. of Flight.\n\nAppointed to a term on the Board of Directors for the Helicopter Association International as a UAS Special Advisor\n\nAppointed to the Board of Directors at the Alliance for Quiet Electric Aircraft\n\nBackground at Embry-Riddle;\n\nStarted as a Worldwide graduate student in 1997\n\nAssigned to the Prescott Campus as the Army ROTC detachment commander\n\nWas requested to help the campus to study, market, and develop a new academic program in rotorcraft. Burgess ran this program from 2002-2007\n\nAwarded the (Prescott) College of Aviation Faculty of the Year in 2006-2007\n\nMoved to the Worldwide Campus in January of 2008, chairing University's largest degree program, joined the Department of Flight in 2017\n\nAwarded the (Worldwide) College of Aeronautics Faculty of the Year in 2017-2018\n\nAwarded the (Worldwide) College of Aeronautics Co-Researcher of the Year in 2019-2020\n\nAwarded the (Worldwide) College of Aviation Co-Researcher of the Year in 2021-2022\n\nCo-Principal Investigator on three separate externally funded grants ($5.5M) under the FAA Center of Excellence for UAS Research; Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE)\n\nProfessor Burgess is Tenured\n\nWorldwide Campus has fully integrated UAS Flight and Scott has brought his deep background in flight curriculum and flight instruction into this program. Burgess is a SME in Infrastructure and Utility Inspections.\n\nInterests: Scott designed, engineered, and built his Energy Star-rated home on 600 acres of family land along the Brazos River in Haskell County, Texas. In his free time, Burgess ranches with his wife, acts as a certified license to carry instructor for the State of Texas, and serves as an adjunct instructor at Gunsite Academy in Arizona during summers in support of a program he began at the Prescott Campus in 2002.\n\nPublications\n\nPublications\n\nCerreta, J., Burgess, S., Colman, E., Coleman, J.
