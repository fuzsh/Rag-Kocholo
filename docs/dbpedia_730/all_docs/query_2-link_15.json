        "text": "The R34 was the first airship to make a return flight across the Atlantic to New York back in July 1919 and this tremendous achievement should not be underestimated.\n\nBuilt by William Beardmore & Co in Inchinnan near Glasgow between 1917/18 this airship was initially intended for combat use in WWI but with the end of the war was converted for passenger use.\n\nThe Captain of the R34 was George Herbert Scott. Following damage sustained whilst moored at Howden this ship was scrapped in January 1921.\n\nGranville Watts was another airship man who had lived in Shortstown. He was born in Worstead, Norfolk and was on the R100 flight to Canada. Unlike most of the R100 crew who had moved from Howden to Bedford in Dec 1929 records show Granville was already in Shortstown in 1927.\n\nIn his book 'My Airship Flights' 1915-1930 George Meager the Captain of the R100 marvels at the sheer bravery of Granville who was hoisted outside of the R100 mid-flight over 3000ft in below freezing temperatures to repair an outer engine. Shown right is the photo Captain Meager took of the incident.\n\nWe are indebted to another Granville Watts* - a great nephew of Granville who has sent in these photographs and the following information which clearly show just how experienced this man was.\n\nâ€œI had a look at the information I had about Granville. The following information is taken from a report of the inquest into his death and the transcript of the eulogy read at his funeral. He became associated with airships in 1916 and was engaged in the construction and flying with ships known as Zero's SSE3, SST14 and others. He was employed as an engineer on the R32, R34, R80 and R33 and on the 23rd of November 1929 he became a member of the R100 crew and flew both ways across the Atlantic. Granville was a member of the R33's breakaway crew and he was aboard the R34 when it crash landed at Howden.\n\nHe was engaged in the construction of the R101 but was not a member of its crew. He was invited but according to his brother Alec could not stand the heat in India. It is also mentioned that he was doubtful of her capabilities. His place on the ship was taken by a man who was saved\"\n\nSadly this brave man was killed in a motor cycle accident on Christmas Eve in 1930. In his career he had been part of some of the most dramatic events in airship history being attached to such historic ships as the R33, R34 and R100.\n\n*Thank you very much to Granville Watts for sending in this information and the photographs of his great uncle.\n\n** This information first appeared on the Shortstown Heritage website now closed.\n\nI was delighted to hear from Kenneth Gray - whose grandfather James Henry Gray was an engineer on the R34 flight to America.\n\nâ€œMy grandfather was Cpl James Henry Gray, engineer on the R34 trans-atlantic flight. I have some paper work and details of his service. My Grandfather lived until I was in my mid-20s and we had many conversations about his voyage on the R34. He served in R.N.A.S. Armoured Cars in Gallipoli then transferred to the Airship Division until after the R34 flight. He was recalled in the WW2 to the R.A.F. I have attached some photos. The sailor hat was given to him on arrival in New York, Silver Propelling Pencil was gifted to the crew from US Navy Officers. My grandfather James Henry Gray was born in Aberdeenshire in 1885 and was a chauffeur at the outbreak of WW1. He was called up (?) to the R.N.A.S on 1/1/1915, where he served in Gallipoli as PO Mechanic/Driver on Armoured Cars. (Career timeline below).\n\n1/1/1915-31/3/1918 â€“ R.N.A.S I.M. 4\n\n1916: He was in Airship Division, served at Howden, Scrubbs, Bedford, Inchinnan and East Fortune.\n\n1/4/1918-30/4/1920 â€“ R.A.F CPL.\n\nBetween WW1/WW2 - Chauffeur.\n\n5/6/1939 - 9/4/1943: WW2 R.A.F served at Abbotsinch, Cpl. Fitter AE, Leconfield T.Sarg, Cranwell. T.Sarg, Lossiemouth, T.F.Sarg, Elsham Wolds, T.F.Sarg. 9/4/1943: Discharged.\n\n1943: Employed as Civilian Fireman at RAF Leuchars for BOAC. After WW2 worked in a local garage. He attended 50th Anniversary Garden Party for RAF at Holyrood House, Edinburgh. Also 50th Anniversary at Heathrow Airport for R34.\"\n\nThanks to Kennet for sharing this information."
