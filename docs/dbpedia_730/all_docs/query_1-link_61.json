        "text": "Operation Lancaster ~ 1946\n\n35 ‘Pathfinder’ Squadron, Goodwill Tour of USA\n\nBoth Public & Private Money was utilised to Fund the War Effort and Appeals for Private Funding were made in the UK and in the British Commonwealth. A “Price List” for the various Aircraft Types was drawn up which showed that Donations of a particular sum would entitle the Donor to have their name inscribed on a randomly selected production Aircraft of that Type. During WW2, this concept was taken one step further, with larger Gifts resulting in an entire Squadron being linked to the relevant Donor.\n\nAlso known as the XXXV Madras Presidency Squadron, 35 Squadron Benefited from Donations from the Madras Presidency (an administrative subdivision of British India) and was formally named “35 (Madras Presidency) Squadron” in June 1942. It is understood that 35 Squadron was presented with at least 3-Handley Page Halifax by the Madras Presidency and the following markings were shown on the side of these Aircraft (serial numbers unknown):\n\nMadras Presidency Coimbatore\n\nMadras Presidency Kistna\n\nMadras Presidency West Godavari\n\nThe term “Madras Presidency” was formally dropped from the Squadron’s title in June 1952. Madras Presidency included the districts of Coimbatore, West Godavari & Kistna (now Krishna) in the present-day states of Tamil Nadu & Andhra Pradesh. The latter 2 Districts were named after the Rivers that flow through them.\n\nConcept & Planning: No.35 Squadron ~ ‘We Act With One Accord’\n\nThe idea of a ‘Goodwill Tour’ of the USA seems to have been Born in February 1946 after discussions with USAAF General Ira Eaker, who had Organised & Commanded the US 8th Air Force in the UK during WW2. General Ira Clarence Eaker (13th April 1896 – 6th August 1987) was a General of the United States Army Air Forces during WW2. Eaker, as 2nd-in-Command of the prospective 8th Air Force, was sent to Britain to Form & Organise its Bomber Command Collaboration. However, while he struggled to Build up his Air Power in Britain, the Organisation of the Army Air Forces kept evolving and he was named Commander of the 8th Air Force on 1st December 1942. Group Captain Richard C M Collard was then placed in charge of ‘Operation Lancaster’ which would involve 16-Lancaster’s of 35 Squadron plus an Avro York (for the Special Advance Party and also Loaded with Aircraft Spares).\n\nOn 27th May 1946 it was Aannounced that 35 Squadron would take part in a Goodwill visit to the USA during July & August 1946. The Briefing included the following:\n\n“The RAF has accepted an Invitation from the United States Army Air Force to send 35 Squadron of RAF Bomber Command to visit the USA to take part in Air Forces Day on 1st August. The Officer in Charge of the Operation will be Group Captain Collard, Station Commander of Graveley and the Squadron will be Commanded by Wing Commander Craig. The Lancaster’s will leave Graveley during the 1st week in July and will Fly in Flights of 4 to New York. The Route will be via St Mawgan (Cornwall), Lagens (Azores) & Gander (Newfoundland). Ground Crews will Travel by Air in an Avro York Aircraft. 35 Squadron was Operational during the greater part of the War and was the only Heavy Bomber Squadron to take part in the RAF massed Flypast over London on Victory Europe Day on 8th June 1946”\n\nC in C Sir Norman Bottomley was also to Attend at the Long Beach Celebration in California. It was planned for July & August 1946 to coincide with US Air Force Day celebrations in the USA. Pathfinder Charles Owen DSO who was the Pilot of a specially Modified Lancaster TW909 Ferried the AOC-in-C Bomber Command Air Marshal Sir Norman Bottomley (The Old Man) on the 1946 Goodwill Trip in a VIP Soundproofed Cabin for the Highlight of the Tour at Long Beach, Ca) and Set out from RAF Marham, (Nr Kings Lynn) Norfolk & Returning via Prestwick to Abingdon.\n\nOperation Lancaster a Goodwill Tour to the USA was to show the Americans some of the ‘British Flyer Boys‘ of Bomber Command that had helped win the War. The 16 Aircraft detailed for the Goodwill Tour were painted in Tiger Force white with black undersides and wore the ‘Squadron Crest’. The Tiger Force colours FE (Far East) were already there for the Japan Theatre in earlier Ppictures but the Flying Horse Crest was added, on Both sides of the Cockpit, just before their Departure for the US.\n\nThe paint scheme, White & Black, was originally meant for Tiger Force, (also known as the Very Long Range Bomber Force) the proposed RAF Aerial Attack on Japan at the end of WW2. No.7 Squadron, like No. 35 Squadron, was earmarked for that Operation and so, presumably, was also painted in those Colours. Tiger Force was to have been Based on Okinawa and would have used Avro Lancasters, Avro Lincolns (the latest Development of the Lancaster) & Consolidated Liberators. The 16-Lancaster’s of 35 Squadron that went on the Goodwill Tour were the Squadron’s own Aircraft with a couple of late Additions from other Squadrons. In preparation for the Trip, all Airmen were fitted out with 3-Sets of Made to Measure Saville Row Dress Uniforms. See News Comment\n\n35 Squadron – Lancaster B.Mk.I FE Sqdn Code TL-F – TW880 W/C A J L Craig, DSO, DFC.\n\nIn WW2 its Halifax’s & Lancaster’s were Coded “TL ” and the Codes “TL ” remained in use until 1951 or thereabouts.\n\nDuring the early months of the ‘Washington Period’ used the Codes “FB“. (American post-War Military Assistance Programs Loaned the RAF enough Superfortresses to equip several RAF Bomber Command Squadrons. The Aircraft were known as the Washington B.1 in RAF Service and served from March 1950 until the last Bombers were returned in early 1954) 35 Squadron FE’s was Equipped for Fighting against the Japanese alongside the USAAF.\n\nB.I(FE) In anticipation of the needs of the Tiger Force Operations against the Japanese in the Far East (FE), a Tropicalised Variant was Based on late Production Aircraft. The B.I(FE) had modified Radio, Radar, Navigation Aids, and a 400-gal (1,818L) Tank installed in the Bomb Bay. Most were painted with White Upper-Surfaces developed to reflect Sunlight and thus Lower the internal Temperatures in the Tropical Sun (This gave little comfort when Flying across the USA), and Black Undersides with a Low Demarcation between the Colours, completely Emitting any Red Colours on the National Insignia in all cases to avoid confusion with the Hinomaru Insignia of the Japanese.\n\nThe RAF accepted the Invitation from the USAAF to send 35 Squadron of RAF Bomber Command to Visit the USA to take part in Air Force Day on 1st August 1946 at Long Beach, California. The Squadron is equipped with Lancaster Aircraft of the Type which was used in Massed Assaults against Germany and was to have formed part of the ‘Tiger Force’ which had been organised by the RAF for the Air Offensive against Japan from Okinawa.\n\nThe Officer in Charge will be Group Captain R C M (Dickie) Collard DSO DFC Station Commander of RAF Graveley, Huntingdonshire. Collard then 35-yrs old he was Shot down over Germany in 1942 one of his Engines was out of Action but he still tenaciously Bombed his Target. He remained a PoW until Liberated by the Russians.\n\nThe Squadron was to be Commanded by Wing Commander Alan John Laird Craig, DSO DFC. The Lancaster’s would leave from Graveley about the end of the 1st week in July. They would Fly 2-Flights of 8 to New York. The Route would be via St Mawgan (Cornwall), Lagens (Azores) & Gander Newfoundland. Collard and a party of Ground Crew would Travel by Air in an Avro York C-1 Aircraft Piloted by S/L Anthony B J Pearson.\n\n35 Squadron was Operational during the greater part of the War and was engaged in many of the Major Attacks on the German War Industry.\n\nThis Squadron was the only Heavy Bomber Squadron to take part in the RAF’s Massed Flypast of London on VE-Day on the 8th June 1946. 35 Squadron’s S/L M J Beetham had Daily Telegraph Reporter Mr Townsend aboard his Aircraft (TL-A – SW315)\n\nScheduled for July & August 1946, 35 Squadron Pathfinders Force RAF were due to carry out a Goodwill Tour of the USA with 16 Lancaster Bombers and an Avro York in Support. The 1st Visit of Foreign Aircraft to the US since the Italian Aircraft visited the World Fair in 1933. Craig developed Formation Flying in initially 3-Lancasters and built up from that to 6, 9 & finally 12 Aircraft. The 1st 12-Formation Flypast was Abroad on 4th May 1946 on the 1st Anniversary of the Liberation of Holland a much appreciative Nation after Operation Manna. The nightly sounds of Raiding Bombers Flying over Holland during the War gave them ongoing hope of Liberation during the German Occupation.\n\nMy father Flt Lt Ron Thompson went on a Goodwill Tour of the USA with 35 Squadron just after the War (USAAF Day at Long Beach, California was the reason), and was also part of the 1st Fly-past over London to commemorate the end of the War (VE-Day). I have a photograph of all the Aircrew of 35 Squadron in front of a Lancaster and his Album of the Trip to the States. He died in 1996.\n\nThe 18 Aircraft Air Crews & Ground Crew Passengers involved are Identified as follows:-\n\n‘A’ Flight ~\n\nTL-A – SW315 – F/Lt M J Beetham, Group Captain (Pilot), B D Monks (Navigator)\n\nW A Saxby (Navigator II), J F Scott (Signaller), R A Versey (Gunner), S G Cliffe (Gunner), G S Scutt (Flight Engineer)\n\nGround Crew, G C Holt, Bennett, Blackburn, Hale, Hayward, Lockerbie.\n\nTL-B – SW313 – F/O S W Barker (Pilot), W Haigh (Pilot), W F Philpot (Navigator),W R Stewart (Navigator), G A Wilkes (Navigator II), J K Woodward (Signaller), T H Blanchard (Flight Engineer)\n\nGround Crew – Cragg, Mott, Owen, Pinnell, Planter.\n\nAvro Lancaster TW657 TL-C Ron W Mathers (Pilot), S E L Sturgeon (Navigator), H M Smith (Navigator II), J E Wright (Signaller), C C C Wanbon (Gunner), J Thompson (Flight Engineer)\n\nGround Crew – C W Martin, Sgt Ashpool (Densbury, York), Barnes, Cook, Thomas, York.\n\nTL-C – TW657 – F/Lt Ron W Mathers (Pilot 143 Maybury Road, Woking), Stuart Edmund Lucas Sturgeon (Navigator), H M Smith (Navigator II), J E Wright (Signaller), C C C Wanbon (Gunner), J Thompson (Flight Engineer)\n\nGround Crew – C W Martin, Barnes, Cook, Thomas, York, Sgt William ‘Bill’ Ashpool of Dewsbury, Yorks – was based at Graveley and went on the Goodwill Tour.
