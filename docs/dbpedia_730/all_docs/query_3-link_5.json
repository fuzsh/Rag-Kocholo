The following was written by Dave Ober: My sister and I owe our existence to the fateful day in 1960 when Robert “Bob” Ober — while sneaking his friend back into the University of Buffalo infirmary — mistakenly entered our mother’s room during her recovery from chicken pox.\n\nFollowing a mischievous adolescence in which he stole an airplane, launched a rocket from inside his college dorm and ran all-night underground poker games, Bob tried his hand at professional golf until he “matured” to embark on a career as an airline pilot for Pan American and Delta airlines.\n\nBob, 83, was first and foremost a dedicated husband for six decades, sharing a lifelong love affair with Lynda that included high daily doses of laughter. A committed father and grandfather, Bob embraced his family with every fiber of his energetic and colorful existence.

Bob died on Dec. 6 of an aortic dissection.\n\nFollowing his retirement from aviation, Bob’s second calling was teaching at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Stony Brook University. At OLLI, Bob enthralled his students for a dozen years by using his tireless curiosity to sprout spirited debate and brought compelling, high-profile guests to classes in current events and “law and politics.” His classes were always oversubscribed as local learners were eager to hear from the many experts he recruited to educate others and respond to his penetrating and provocative questions.\n\nBob grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, in the shadow of the U.S. Open tennis tournament where he honed his skills watching the greats and even had the good fortune to hit with some of the top pros of the day, like Pancho Gonzalez and Lew Hoad. When he wasn’t working to perfect a golf swing he spent his entire life honing, Bob found ways to defy authority and push the envelope.\n\nRoger Pierce Wicker passed away on July 4, 2023 in Dallas, Texas from pancreatic cancer.

My Uncle John was always kind, charming, witty, engaging, a wee bit sarcastic (Hey, we’re Irish) but nonetheless a loving man that I was ever so fond and enamored of. I looked up to my Uncle John immensely as an incredible and amazing force of strength and endearing love to me and his family and friends. After many years of flying, his hearing began to wane and my Uncle John knowing about my own significant loss of hearing bought me a pair of hearing aids which I was indeed grateful for his and my Aunt Betty’s benevolent gift. I’m proud that I was so lucky to spend time with my Uncle John and his family when visiting FL and CA. Those were the best of days with the best of people. Fly on my uncle, my uncle. We’ll all see you in regaling and loving glory once again. – Kyle Grady.\n\nGordon F Young Jr, age 85, of Skillman, NJ, passed away, suddenly and unexpectedly, on April 30, 2023.

After this, he spent several years in the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada as a bush pilot, assisting prospectors and scientists with their work.\n\nFrom there, he pivoted into commercial aviation, and began an exciting and successful career as an international airline pilot for Pan-American World Airways, and later, Delta Airlines. He began with Pan Am on Valentines Day 1966, as a Navigator on the Boeing 707 Airplane, using the ancient art of celestial navigation to navigate the skies. During the Vietnam War, Gordon was assigned to assist the military by flying supplies on Pan Am aircraft to Vietnam.
