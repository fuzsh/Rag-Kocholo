        "text": "Shortstown was built on Tinker’s Hill, Harrowden. Before it was built, a windmill stood on the site from 13th to 16th century.\n\nFrom 17th to 18th century, the area was known as Windmill Hill.\n\nShortstown started with the establishment of the Airship Works .The Shorts Brothers came to the area in 1916, constructing shed 1 to build and house the R31 and R32 and built houses to accommodate the workers near to the sheds.\n\nThe R101 project began in 1924 where shed 1 was extended to house the larger airship and shed 2 was transferred from Pulham, Norfolk in 1928. The R101 build was completed in 1929.\n\nIn 1918 and 1927, sheds (later Grade II* listed buildings) were built for originally the R31 and R32 and later the R100 and R101 airships which then represented the latest passenger flight technology. The village was originally built by the Short Brothers for its workers, but evolved into a settlement for people working at the RAF Cardington base.\n\nRAF Cardington\n\nThe Royal Airship Works was put on a care and maintenance basis until 1938 when it was renamed the Balloon Development Establishment. However, the social club at Shortstown was still known as the Royal Airship Works and Shortstown Club in the 1980s.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1936, an RAF station had opened at Cardington, being particularly concerned with producing gas for barrage balloons and training barrage balloon crews as well as more general training of recruits and NCOs. Throughout the 1940s Cardington remained a busy RAF station and from 1953 it became the RAF’s main recruitment centre.\n\nAfter the Second World War, further houses were built at Shortstown as married quarters for RAF personnel. The three avenues off the southern extension of Greycote are named after three prominent victims of the R101 disaster: Brigadier-General Lord Thomson, Secretary of state for Air; Air Vice Marshal Sir W. Sefton Brancker, director of Civil aviation at the Air Ministry and Major George Herbert Scott, Assistant director of Airship Development (Flying and Training) at the Royal Airship Works.\n\nThe roads of the western half of the site are all named after Second World War bomber aircraft.\n\nWith the ending of National service and cuts in the armed forces the RAF’s presence at Cardington began to dwindle and largely disappeared in the 1970s. As a result, the population of Eastcotts declined from 3,675 in 1951 to 1,710 in 1981\n\nShortstown today\n\nSince 2012 there has been significant housing development on land to the east of the A600, this part of the village is marketed as New Cardington and Eastcotts Green. Also built was a new school and shops in the centre of the New Cardington development. Although Bellway homes marketed the development as New Cardington, in fact it remains an extension of Shortstown which became its own Parish in April 2019 after previously been a part of Eastcotts .\n\nThe Development of Shortstown"
