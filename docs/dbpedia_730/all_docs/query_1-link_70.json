Much of the great success achieved can be attributed to Squadron Leader Baldwin's superb leadership, fine tactical ability and iron determination. His sterling qualities were amply demonstrated on one occasion in January 1944, when he led a small formation of aircraft in an attack on a force of some 30 Focke Wulf 190s, nine of which were shot down, Squadron Leader Baldwin being responsible for two of the successes. His example was inspiring.\n\n** Wing Commander Baldwin was appointed Wing Commander (Flying) of a wing in June 1944. He has, in addition to planning the major portion of the operations undertaken by the wing, led over 100 successful wing and squadron missions, directed against a wide variety of targets. These have included enemy tanks, railway communications and shipping and enemy gun positions menacing our troops. Under his brilliant leadership the wing has destroyed or severely damaged over 800 fighting vehicles, thus contributing in no small measure to the rout of the enemy in the Falaise Gap. Wing Commander Baldwin has destroyed three enemy aircraft in combat since the invasion, bringing his total victories to at least 16 destroyed. Immediately prior to the invasion, he planned and completed the operations against enemy radar installations, which paved the way for the landing of our forces by enabling them to achieve complete surprise. Throughout this period Wing Commander Baldwin has planned in a masterly manner and led brilliantly a vast number of missions, many of which have been in direct support of the Army and have decisively affected the course of the battle.\n\n*** This officer has participated in numerous sorties, invariably displaying great courage and operational efficiency. This was amply demonstrated during a sortie one day in January, 1943, when he attacked a formation of three enemy aircraft. In his first attack, Flying Officer Baldwin shot down the leading aircraft of the hostile formation. Following this success he destroyed. another of the formation before his own aircraft was hit in one of the wings. When the third enemy fighter attempted to attack from the rear. Flying Officer Baldwin out manoeuvred the attacker and shot it down. On another occasion, during a sortie over Belgium, he damaged four locomotives.\n\n**** Squadron Leader Baldwin is a keen, skilful and determined fighter. He has participated in much operational flying during which he has destroyed at least nine enemy aircraft. In addition he has attacked some 14 locomotives, six barges, a tug and a tanker with damaging effect. He is a highly efficient squadron commander, whose example and determination has inspired all.\n\n***** The 'Typhoons' unequalled record as a ground attack a/c overshadowed its air to air successes such as those credited to F/Lt. J.R. Baldwin. (later Wg Cdr. DSO. DFC* AFC.) A pilot considered by many to be \"The supreme Typhoon pilot of WWII\" Flying 'Typhoon' DN360 PR-A , on 20th Jan. 1943 he shot down three Bf109's out of his total score of 15 e/a plus many damaged and several on the ground.\n\n****** Group Captain Baldwin commanded No.123 Wing from 20th February 1945 to present time. During the winter of 1944-45 it was stationed at Gilze Rijen. Group Captain Baldwin had previously taken part in the initial battles for the liberation of the Netherlands as a Wing Commander (Operations). He organized the ground side of the Wing so effectively that he found time to fly on numerous missions. The Wing continued to specialize in direct close support work on the front of the First Canadian Army and the standard of attacks remained high. Under the leadership and guidance of Group Captain Baldwin, the Wing began to perfect a method for briefing pilots, whilst airborne, for attacks against fleeting targets and, within a short space of time, the Army was being provided with close support from the air within a few minutes of their demanding the support.\n\nBale,\n\nLeslie Arthur\n\nSon of alderman William Henry Bale, JP, and Mabel Ada Bale (née Lawrance), of Caversham, Reading, Berkshire.\n\n(12?).1913\n\nReading district, Berkshire\n\n-\n\n14.11.1942\n\n(KIA) [age 29]\n\n[Malta Memorial, panel 2, column 1]\n\nSgt.\n\n?

One night in April, 1943, Flight Lieutenant Bickers captained an aircraft detailed to attack Duisburg. During the homeward flight, whilst over enemy territory, the aircraft was attacked by an enemy fighter. The first burst of fire from the attacker killed the rear gunner, severely wounded the mid-upper gunner and set the rear turret on fire. For twenty minutes the enemy aircraft continued its attacks and only the skilful evading tactics employed by Flight Lieutenant Bickers prevented the bomber from being shot down. The elevator trimming gear was put out of action, the engine controls were damaged, the wireless apparatus and the hydraulic system were rendered unserviceable; many instruments were destroyed while one of the port petrol tanks was pierced, causing its contents to leak away. In spite of the tremendous odds, Flight Lieutenant Bickers, displaying superb airmanship, flew the badly damaged aircraft to an airfield in this country where he effected a successful crash landing.

Shortly after leaving the target which had been successfully bombed, they were attacked five times from astern by a Focke Wulf 190. Acting on the skilful and concise directions given by Sergeant Campbell, the captain took successful evasive action which enabled the rear gunner to deliver a very accurate burst of fire. The enemy fighter burst into flames and was seen to crash to the ground. Shortly afterwards, when crossing the French coast, a Junkers 88 attacked from the port quarter. Once again Sergeant Campbell passed accurate information to Flight Sergeant Bowmer who again handled the aircraft with exceptional skill and coolness and enabled the rear gunner to destroy the second enemy fighter. During the entire flight both airmen displayed a high degree of courage, skill and initiative which resulted in the destruction of two enemy fighters and the safe return of the aircraft.\n\n14.06.1944 commissioned, RAFVR (General Duties Branch) [emergency commission] (1945) 10 Squadron RAF (DFC) 01.12.1948 temporary commission, RAF (General Duties Branch) 13.05.1949 permanent commission, RAF (General Duties Branch)\n\nBowtell,\n\nAlbert Charles\n\nSon (with three brothers and three sisters) of James Daniel Bowtell (1844-1899), and Martha Wheeler (1843?-1898).\n\nMarried ((09?).1912, Risbridge district, Essex) Mary Golding Suckling ((12?).1889- (06?).1963); ... children. 22.12.1896\n\nSaffron Walden district, Essex\n\n-\n\n(03?).1977\n\nDover district, Kent\n\nCpl.
