Christopher frayling, Jim Kitses, donald richie, and Mitsuhiro yoshimoto have written speciﬁcity about the inﬂuence of ford’s style on Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, as well as the impact of ford’s and Kurosawa’s ﬁlms on Leone’s spaghetti Westerns. More recently, John fawell, in The Art of Sergio Leone’s once upon a Time in the West: A Critical Appreciation (2005), has explained in great depth how ford’s approach to landscape inﬂuenced Leone’s ﬁlmmaking style. The obsession with how, for example, ford’s style inﬂuenced the ﬁnal look of a Kurosawa or Leone ﬁlm is not limited to ﬁlm scholars. Kurosawa, in both his autobiography (1983) and interviews, explained the extent to which the style of ford’s ﬁlms inﬂuenced his samurai ﬁlms: “i have respected John ford from the beginning. i pay close attention to his productions, and i think i am inﬂuenced by them … Western dramas have been ﬁlmed over and over again for a very long time … and in the process, have evolved a kind of ‘grammar’ of cinema. And i have learned from this grammar” (Car1\n\nIntroduction\n\ndullo, 2008, pp. 24–25). furthermore, Leone pointed out that his interest in making Westerns originated with John ford’s Westerns. in his interview with frayling in Once Upon a Time in Italy (2008, p. 81), Leone said, “i could almost say that it was thanks to him [John ford] that i even considered making Westerns myself.… There is a visual inﬂuence there as well because he [ford] was the one who tried most carefully to ﬁnd a true visual image to stand for ‘the West.’” Leone went on to explain the inﬂuence of ford’s style on his italian Westerns: “i can guarantee that the characters who register strongly in front of distant horizons in my Westerns—Westerns that are in many respects more cruel and deﬁnitely less innocent and enchanted than [ford’s] owe a great deal to his lessons in cinematic form, even if the debt is involuntary” (frayling, 2008, p. 168). ford engaged with several prominent social and political themes from classic Western ﬁlms, such as history versus myth, nomads versus settlers, individualism versus community, the clash of moralities, the historical and political expansions of a nation, and so forth. Kurosawa and Leone likewise argued that throughout their respective careers they engaged with themes that changed the norms of samurai ﬁlms and spaghetti Westerns. regarding Kurosawa, the common belief among scholars such as Prince, richie, and yoshimoto is that although Kurosawa was concerned with Japanese history and culture, his ﬁlms were mainly inﬂuenced by the themes that ford promoted in his Westerns. Prince, in The Warrior’s Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa (1991, pp. 12–13), writes that “[b]oth men [ford and Kurosawa] were attracted to stories of masculine adventure (though, perhaps, Kurosawa more consistently than ford); both men continued to rely on a stock company of trusted performers; and both men, of course, had a certain regard for Westerns.” Moreover, Kurosawa’s ﬁlms effectively revolutionized Japanese period ﬁlms. Joan Mellen, in Voice from the Japanese Cinema (1975, p. 37), writes on this point, “if [daisuke] ito [1898–1981] created the genre of jidaigeki, Kurosawa perfected the form and gave it so deep a historical resonance that each of his jidaigeki has contained within it the entire progress of Japan from feudal to modern times.” studying sergio Leone’s ﬁlms in tandem with works of ford and Kurosawa shows the ﬁnal stages of the evolution of theme of death in Western/samurai ﬁlms. ford and Kurosawa’s attitudes toward the standard Western themes and concerns greatly inﬂuenced Leone’s italian Westerns. Also, the critical attitude of spaghetti Westerns regarding familiar themes of the classic Westerns or samurai ﬁlms (such as the hero’s codes of conduct, the moral decency of the family and the social ethics of the community) 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nsuggests that Leone’s ﬁlms developed a language of their own. This language offers a different outlook on the American history and myth than ford’s Western ﬁlms. Western and samurai ﬁlms are action packed, further emphasizing the role of death with regard to the moralities that these genres project in relation to the history of America and Japan. in these cinematic texts, the hero’s response to the presence and, indeed, the absence of death as a physical, historical or social threat strengthens or criticizes these moralities. even though the death of a character results in his or her absence from the mise en scène, their past actions can still affect the ﬁlm’s conclusion. The existing literature on the works of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone has not studied the effect of the theme of death on the position of the hero in their ﬁlms in a detailed and focused fashion. However, ﬁlm scholars such as Austin fisher, frayling, Kitses, Prince, and richie have created valuable literature on each director’s ﬁlms. They have observed and studied the works of these directors in different theories and contexts: auteurism, cultural and social studies, historical studies and so on. Closer to a thematic study of death, the above scholars have also written on violence and its social and aesthetic qualities in the ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone. in recent years, Mary Lea bandy and Kevin stoehr, in Ride, Boldly Ride: The Evolution of the American Western (2012), have studied the history of the Western genre, the genre’s revival, its revisionism, the position of women in these ﬁlms and so forth. However, bandy and stoehr’s study of ford’s ﬁlms does not pay serious attention to the theme of death either. The present work will add a new element to the current scholarship on the works of these directors. To achieve this objective, i will design a thematic umbrella to identify the similarities and differences between the ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone regarding the theme of death. This umbrella consists of a close textual analysis of the ﬁlms of these three auteur ﬁlmmakers based on (a) the auteur ﬁlmmaker and the artistic freedom, (b) cultural and cinematic approaches to death, (c) the hero’s journey in the narrative, and (d) the hero’s tragic death in ﬁlm narrative.\n\nThe Auteur Filmmaker and Artistic Freedom Auteur theory was inﬂuenced and developed in france during the 1950s by the writers of Cahiers du Cinéma such as André bazin and françois Truffaut. The initial aim of the auteur theory was to analyze and study the 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nworks of Hollywood directors such as John ford, Howard Hawks, and Alfred Hitchcock, whose ﬁlms were banned during the nazi occupation of france (1940–1944). A decade later, Andrew sarris focused his study of American ﬁlmmakers in The American Cinema (1968) on this theory. in the last 60 years, many scholars have engaged with the theory to study the ﬁlms of non–American ﬁlmmakers as well. related to Western genre, Jim Kitses, in Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood (2004, ﬁrst published in 1969), argues that the Western genre has provided American and european auteur directors with the necessary artistic freedom to develop their cinematic vision. This “development of vision” contributed to the evolution of the genre. Kitses (2004, p. 1) states, “A study of the Western through the lens of its major directors, a study of its major directors within the framework of the genre: such is the dialectical premise that structures this book. John ford … and sergio Leone … these ﬁlm-makers can be seen as constituting a great tradition of the Western genre.” Kitses (2004, p. 3) further studies how the Western auteur directors such as ford and Leone exercised their artistic freedom to shape the genre. That is why he later (p. 10) writes: rather than an empty vehicle breathed into by the ﬁlmmaker, the genre is a vital structure through which ﬂow a myriad of themes and concepts. As such the form can provide ﬁlmmakers with a range of possible connections and the space in which to experiment, to shape and deﬁne the kind of effects and meanings they are working towards. We must be prepared to entertain the idea that auteurs grow, and that genre can help to crystallize preoccupations and contribute actively to development. i suggest that the genre and its rules are guidebooks that shape the attitude of the auteur-director towards the genre themes.\n\nKitses’ idea is similar to André bazin’s belief: “The evolution of Western art towards greater personalization should deﬁnitely be considered as a step forward, but only so long as this individualization remains only a ﬁnal perfection and does not claim to define culture” (cited in Caughie, 1981, p. 26). Here, bazin suggests that being an auteur does not mean that, for example, ford is the only ﬁlmmaker with a personal style and vision; rather, he is a talented ﬁlmmaker who, according to the environment in which he grew up and worked (America and Hollywood’s studio system), approaches the genre and at times modulates the themes of the genre in a certain way. This reading is close to Andrew sarris’ statement in American Cinema (1968, p. 32) that “the classical cinema was more functional than the modern cinema. it knew its audience and their expectations, but it often provided something extra. This something extra is the concern of the auteur theory.” 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe question lies in which ways an individual ﬁlmmaker offers this “something extra.” i believe that V.f. Perkins’ arguments can answer this question; he, in Film as Film: Understanding and Judging Movies (1990, pp. 61–62), writes: The director’s authorship cannot be produced by eliminating the results of collaboration. either ﬁlm direction allows modes of collaboration that can yield authorship, or the concept of authorship is inappropriate. An authorship theory must ﬁnd room for a process which may enable the director to take responsibility for discoveries, incorporating them into the ﬁlm’s intention. it must allow for the possibility that a movie may be enriched, rather than impaired, by changes from an original concept—wherever that is located.\n\nThus, the cultural and social surroundings of a director not only inﬂuence his attitude toward the genre’s themes and moral concerns but also school him on how to reﬂect on these elements. This view is contrary to the early arguments of the auteur, where there is not much space for modes of production and the director being conceptualized as omnipotent and omnipresent. robin Wood, in Hitchcock Films (1991, p. 288), writes, “each theory of ﬁlm so far has insisted on its own particular polarization.… Auteur theory, in its heyday, concentrated attention exclusively on the ﬁngerprints, thematic or stylistic, of the individual artist; recent attempts to discuss the complete ‘ﬁlmic text’ have tended to throw out ideas of personal authorship altogether.… each [theory] can offer insights into different areas of cinema and different aspects of a single ﬁlm.” As opposed to scholars and critics such as sarris and Truffaut, Wood is concerned with reading the ﬁlm as a text; he seeks to understand a director’s vision according to the ﬁlm he has made, rather than understanding the work through the director’s vision. Wood reconceptualizes the auteur theory as an attitude in understanding a singular ﬁlm, or some of the ﬁlms of a given director, rather than the ﬁlmmaker’s entire opus. in addition, certain motifs may be established between some of a director’s ﬁlms, but this commonality does not mean that these motifs can be seen in all of the director’s works. in Personal Views (1976, p. 187), Wood notes on this matter, “The validity of the ‘auteur theory,’ as generally understood, seems to me at once conﬁrmed and qualiﬁed— there being, one might say, as many qualiﬁcations as there are movies. What i would like to see take place in criticism is a return from ‘auteurs’ to ﬁlms.” Wood further repositions an auteur director according to his social and cultural environment. This point means, for example, that italian culture would inﬂuence Leone’s Westerns. in short, an auteur such as Leone is not 5\n\nIntroduction\n\na new culture but an agent of a speciﬁc culture. being an auteur does not mean that one individual can change the entire conventions of a speciﬁc genre; instead, he or she can affect a ﬁlmmaking tradition and push the boundaries, so an auteur is not a revolutionary but a reformist of the genre. Wood (1991, pp. 292–293) points out, “it is only through the medium of the individual that ideological tensions come to particular focus, hence become of aesthetic as well as sociological interest. i argue that works are of special interest when (a) the deﬁned particularities of an auteur interact with speciﬁc ideological tension and (b) the ﬁlm is fed from more than one generic source.” This idea opposes the earlier accounts of auteurism, in which all aspects of an auteur work are original. Kitses (2004, p. 13), well aware of this fact, writes, “Arguments have now been made that genres are differentiated branches of the same narrative system rather than the discrete traditions isolated studies suggest, and that genre may be closer to an individual process rather than a system of ﬁxed forms.” He (2004, p. 14) further writes that, “at its core, western marries historical and archetypal elements in a fruitful mix that allows different ﬁlm-makers a wide latitude of creative play.” so, Kitses suggests that the Western genre is a site in which different ﬁlmmakers can portray and develop their personal vision; therefore, instead of abandoning the auteur theory, Kitses reconceptualizes it. i believe that, among the scholars who have engaged with the auteur theory, Wood privileges his readers with a clearer view of this theory. first, he does not offer a demeaning and negative interpretation of the auteur. He acknowledges the historical importance of the theory. Also, again and again, he puts forward the idea that, in ﬁlm studies, ﬁlms (rather than directors) should be the focus. in such a view, all kind of theories (including those that are not directly linked to ﬁlms) can be useful depending on what the researcher aims to achieve. Third, Wood manages to overcome the dilemma of who is an auteur or who can be an auteur. This is a signiﬁcant point for this book, since all three directors with whom i am concerned are recognized as auteurs. i do not intend to say why they are great directors; i want to move away from a pure auteurist approach to their ﬁlms. My goal is to read and understand the theme of death and its subthemes in the ﬁlms of these directors, as well as how these themes reﬂect on their social and cultural environments. This is where Wood’s notion is enlightening: the auteur theory can be useful in the case of directors of commercial ﬁlms who work within the studio system. sarris understands the complex relationship between individual ﬁlmmakers and studio system. He is aware that auteur directors are working 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nwithin the limits of studios. sarris (1968, p. 20) writes, “[The studio system] connotes conformity rather than diversity, repetition rather than variation.” i argue that the conformity about which sarris speaks is another clue for studying the ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone with respect to each director’s social and cultural surroundings. The notion of death and the reactions of the living to this concept can differ from culture to culture. My question here is how three sets of cultural attitudes impact the functions of the theme of death in the ﬁlms of these auteur directors. The answer lies in their artistic freedom. However, this begs another question: How does this freedom work? sarris, as cited in in bill nichols’ Movies and Methods (1976, p. 247), provides the following response to the question of artistic freedom: The auteur theory values the personality of a director precisely because of the barriers to its expression. it is as if a few brave spirits had managed to overcome the gravitational pull of the mass movies. The fascination of Hollywood movies lies in their performance under pressure. Actually, no artist is ever completely free, and art does not necessarily thrive as it becomes less constrained. freedom is desirable for its own sake, but it is hardly an aesthetic prescription.\n\nsarris argues that artistic freedom is an ideal, not the reality. “freedom” in this sense means that a ﬁlmmaker is not fully free to show what he or she wants to express. There are always pressures and obstacles that affect the work of an artist. That is why modern ﬁlm criticism sees an auteur not as a ﬁgure of total freedom but as an intelligent person who manages to bypass the diﬃculties of ﬁlmmaking and create a good product. being an auteur director does not mean crafting a ﬁlm that is aesthetically or thematically perfect; it is about making a perfect ﬁlm under the circumstances in which that ﬁlm is being made. social norms have a great part to play in this scenario. Andrew britton (2009, p. 431), in his article “The Philosophy of the Pigeonhole: Wisconsin formalism and ‘The Classical style’” (included in Britton on Film), considers these norms a signiﬁcant element that has a crucial impact on the ﬁlms of an auteur: Artistic norms are cultural norms, and the deployment of them cannot be identiﬁed in any simple way with a process of individualization or “self-expression” … To work with such norms is to work on and, in the major cases, to modify and change the terms of public discourse which structures sensibility and which governs the ways in which art is able to signify, and engage with, the existing social world. no artist who impresses us as having major distinction relates to the norms of an artistic practice as structures external to him-or herself which are there to be appropriated and “applied.”\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of britton’s idea is that “artistic norms are cultural norm.” An artist is an agent of a speciﬁc culture, and an auteur is an agent who modiﬁes some aspects of the said speciﬁc culture. i further argue that cultural conventions create habitual methods of thinking in a director. This is not a negative or positive situation; rather, it is a situation that molds the director’s treatment of different themes. directors like ford, Kurosawa, and Leone managed, while working within this system of cultural methods of thinking, to add something extra to it. This idea goes back to my earlier argument that a studio-based auteur’s ﬁlms contribute to the evolution of the genre conventions. Thus, a triad can be suggested: cultural norms, the studio system, and the individual ﬁlmmaker. The latter may be unconscious of the fact that he is inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the two former elements. However, if a director has some new ideas, the triadic machine can move and evolve. britton’s arguments bring us back to what was said earlier: filmmakers, whether they work in America, Japan, italy, or elsewhere, follow their country’s culture. Although auteur directors are not responsible for making new cultures, they have inﬂuenced the thematic concerns of their national cultures. i now ask another question: To what degree can a director such as ford, Kurosawa, or Leone exercise his artistic freedom within the production norms of the American, Japanese, and italian studio systems? The answer is that the Japanese studio system is director oriented, in contrast to the Hollywood and italian studio systems (which are producer oriented). Joseph Anderson and donald richie, in The Japanese Film (1982, pp. 346– 347), note that “the Japanese [ﬁlm] industry operates under what it calls the ‘director system’ rather than under the ‘producer system,’ which is so common in the west. What the Japanese mean by ‘producer system’ is that the responsibility for both the type and conception of a ﬁlm is delegated by the company to an individual who selects the story, director, and cast and who is in general responsible for the ﬁnal shape of a given ﬁlm.” in addition, Anderson and richie point out that the “producer system” in essence means that rather having a few geniuses making a few outstanding ﬁlms, there will be a large number of merely competent directors turning out a predictable number of competent ﬁlms. obviously, as in any ﬁlm industry, the really outstanding movie is the exception rather than the rule, and just as obviously-it is usually the responsibility, if not the entire conception of a single man. it is these single men, all over the world, who have created the art of the ﬁlm [1982, p. 350].\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ni am not in favor of using the concept of “few geniuses” in branding directors. it results in a biased view that some directors are better than others in terms of intellectual powers. even if such branding may have some merit, it creates the same unsatisfactory explanations that the early accounts of the auteur theory have produced for ﬁlm scholarship. Moreover, the unsuccessful adaptation of western ﬁlm production caused the Japanese studios to base their ﬁlmmaking system on the directors; as Anderson and richie write (1982, p. 347): The director system was found much more congenial to Japan. under this system, the head of the studio, or very often the head of the company as is the case with shochiku’s Kido and daiei’s nagata, is the active director of policy as to precisely what kind of pictures will be made. The responsibility for delegating details to a producer is not exercised. The director is responsible for everything in a ﬁlm and reports directly to the head of the production. Hence it is called the director system.\n\nfurthermore, on the same page, Anderson and richie claim that “in Japan, ﬁlm directors are not called enshutsusha, the Japanese word which would most closely correspond to the english meaning, but kantokusha, which has the wider meaning of superintendent, overseer, or person-in-charge.” so, it can be said that the power over the ﬁnal look of the ﬁlm (which has been debated long enough with regard to classic Hollywood auteurs) was a characteristic of major Japanese ﬁlmmakers such as Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, and ozu. The great power of the Japanese director was not permanent. Anderson and richie (1982, pp. 349–350) explain the matter as follows: “yet, though the Japanese directors have more control of their product than most directors of other countries, the recent [the late 1970s, early 1980s] ‘rationalization’ of the industry has weakened their position. They are more and more tending to lose their power both to individual producers and to over-all production head of each company.” be that as it may, Kurosawa wrote, directed and produced most of his ﬁlms during the era of the director system (the 1950s and 1960s). Therefore, he had more freedom to control his projects than most American and italian directors.\n\nHero’s Journey in the Narrative The American mythologist Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) dedicated his academic career and writings to developing the concept of archetypal 9\n\nIntroduction\n\nmyths and heroes. His major contribution to the cultural anthropology is the monomyth theory, which is based on Charles-Arnold Kurr van Gennep’s Les rites de passage (1909). Campbell, in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (2008, ﬁrst published in 1949), writes about the similarity of myths and literature in different cultures around the globe. Levi-strauss’ ideas in Myth and Meaning (1978, p. 19) support Campbell’s theory of universal archetypes: “it is probably one of the many conclusions of anthropological research that, notwithstanding the cultural differences between the several parts of mankind, the human mind is everywhere one and the same and that it has the same capacities. i think this is accepted everywhere.” robert ellwood, Valerie estelle frankel, Lesley northup and others have criticized Campbell’s writings in general, and his monomyth theory in particular, for their masculine tone, structuralist nature, dense language, and lack of attention to those historical and social elements that vary between cultures. However, none of these are a reason to invalidate monomyth theory in relation to studying classic ﬁlms. The ﬁlms that are the focus of my book have very straightforward structures. Their message is masculine and direct, with no or little ideological ambiguity. Campbell’s theory merges well with the narrative of these ﬁlms. Moreover, the prominent level of thematic similarity between the ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone requires the use of the relevant theory in studying them. Campbell’s views on the similarity of certain concepts among most civilizations are in line with my book’s concerns. Campbell identiﬁes the concept of rebirth as one of the most prominent themes in myths, legends, religious scriptures and other written ancient, medieval, and classic texts. i argue that ﬁlms likewise engage with the theme of rebirth (or, as i shall call it in this book, the cycle of life) to show that the hero’s death (or a decent individual’s death) does not cause the destruction of a moral community; the cycle of life contributes to the biological and moral survival of humans. The second similar idea among all cultures, according to Campbell’s monomyth theory, is that in written and visual texts, from ancient occidental and oriental civilizations to contemporary societies, the audience witnesses the actions of an archetypal hero, who undergoes life-changing experiences in a process that mythologists call “the hero’s journey.” in ﬁlms, this journey/voyage/odyssey portrays the evolution of such an archetypical hero. However, the issue of cultural difference can arise when, for example, the hero of action/epic ﬁlms is a samurai in a Japanese period ﬁlm or a cowboy in an American Western ﬁlm. Although there are cultural and his10\n\nIntroduction\n\ntorical differences between these two types of heroes, there is one initial similarity between them: they are both warriors who undertake a personal journey that will affect their personalities and the future of their surroundings. The journey motif is another common theme between samurai and Western ﬁlms. However, the quality of this journey and its moral outcome can differ from culture to culture. during the various stages of this journey, the archetypical hero faces ordeals that challenge the limits of his physical, ethical and psychological strength. The hero must respond to these ordeals in order to complete his journey. Campbell (2008, p. 39) writes on the nature of the hero’s journey, “[it] is a labor not of attainment but of reattainment, not discovery but rediscovery. The godly powers sought and dangerously won are revealed to have been within the heart of the hero all the time.” Campbell’s elaborate and somewhat ﬂowery language should not daunt us. such rhetoric could frighten the most experienced of ﬁlm scholars or the most hardworking of ﬁlm students to the point of intellectual paralysis. However, a moment of intellectual reﬂection will reveal the simplicity and ingenuity of Campbell’s words: the concept of journey in the monomyth theory is not a creative force that gives birth to new and previously nonexistent qualities in the hero—rather, the journey is the trigger that unleashes the already-existing but hidden qualities of the hero. susan Mackey-Kallis, in The Hero and the Perennial Journey Home in American Film (2001), integrates Campbell’s theory with the study of the journey motif in American ﬁlms. since her methodology is based on Campbell’s writings on the universal hero, her ﬁndings are relevant to the heroes of non–American popular ﬁlms as well. Mackey-Kallis (2001, p. 13) argues that in American ﬁction ﬁlms, the mythical journey of the hero consists of his separation from his “immediate home,” followed by traveling through the obstacles of what she calls a “wasteland” and defeating those obstacles in order to arrive at a new home. she further writes: [The hero’s journey] moves the individual out from unknown territory (the parochial/ the home/ego-consciousness) to unknown territory (often a descent into strange or terrible lands/unconsciousness) where the individual is sometimes aided (mentors/gods/shamans/dreams), and is often sorely tested (demons/shadow-self), in a search for a treasure or boon (gold/grail/enlightenment/individuation) that the individual then shares with the culture upon returning home (cultural enlightenment/awareness of the undivided nature of being/transconsciousness).\n\nThe immediate home that Mackey-Kallis is concerned with is not limited to the hero’s birthplace, his family or even his occupation. As she 11\n\nIntroduction\n\ndeclares, home refers to the hero’s original state of mind, which will change during the journey; consequently, the hero will ultimately reach a new home/perspective. for example, in Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (1964), the unnamed hero is a loner and outsider coming into the wasteland that is saint Miguel, motivated by the idea of earning a fortune. by the ﬁlm’s conclusion, however, he has reached a new home/mindset, as he is not solely driven by gaining a monetary prize but also motivated to defend innocent people. The idea of “wasteland” is the second notion in Mackey-Kallis’ theory that requires clariﬁcation. i suggest that a “wasteland” can be a dangerous location, a backward community, or even an unethical way of thinking. only villains can triumph in the wasteland. it requires a savior/hero—not a celestial one, but an earthly one—to cleanse the wasteland of the forces of the antagonist. This change can lead to a ﬂourishing community/society. one key factor is that, in Western ﬁlms, viewers do not necessarily witness on screen the garden that comes out of the wasteland. The destruction of the evil (both physically and ethically), as is the case with most classic Western ﬁlms, is the merely ﬁrst step in building this ideological garden. in non–American ﬁlms, the hero does not always win wasteland back from the villains. nonetheless, the hero challenges the villains and their false morality. This is particularly true in the case of some of Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, in which the villain survives in spite of this challenge. Kurosawa’s The Bad Sleep Well (1960) deals with the corrupt world of businessmen in contemporary Japan. Although the villain survives the threat of death, by the ﬁlm’s conclusion his ﬁnancial corruption is known to his only son. As a result, the son abandons the father. The villain also has lost his peace of mind; as he informs his superior, he “can no longer sleep well.” Therefore, the moral wasteland still has a chance to be puriﬁed from evil if a new hero follows in the moral footsteps of the fallen hero. Mackey-Kallis furthers her theory by suggesting different quests that a hero might undertake in changing his home/mentality. These quests, which contribute to the hero obtaining knowledge of his abilities, consist of the creation quest, the coming-of-age quest, the sacred marriage quest, and the grail quest. These are the hero’s goals, and, as such, they form the energy that pushes the hero forward in the story. in Mackey-Kallis’ theory, the creation quest concerns the cycle of life: birth, death and the subsequent birth of both new mentality and new individuals, which compensate for the death of old attitudes (moralities) or deceased people. The point of this quest in classic ﬁlms is that the hero 12\n\nIntroduction\n\nmost likely gains a positive set of morals by losing a negative trait or motif. in ford’s Stagecoach, by the end of the ﬁlm, ringo is no longer a fugitive from the law; instead, he is the typical fordian hero who’s ready to pay for his past mistakes before settling down and starting a family on a farm. The coming-of-age quest focuses on the hero’s separation from his old self/home/society and freedom from a womb that symbolizes old attitudes/mentalities/goals. Through engaging with ordeals during his journey, he matures and learns to trust in his own ability to survive. in Kurosawa’s Sanjuro, for example, the anonymous hero evolves from a violent swordsman to a prudent warrior who avoids unnecessary killing. The sacred marriage quest marks the triumph in separating oneself from the original home and society. it is also the reward of the male hero and, indeed, the female heroine. After overcoming the obstacles and ordeals of the wasteland and vanquishing the villains, marriage (beyond being the ideologically endorsed sexual bond among couples) will be the celebration that epitomizes the destruction of the villain(s). for example, in Stagecoach, ringo and dallas abscond after they have overcome various ordeals. The grail quest marks the hero’s redemption from his past criminal actions and shows his successful attempt to defeat the villains. in this quest, the hero’s actions have a positive impact on his personal life and the community/group to which he is related. ethan in The Searchers (1956) is an outsider and a racist; nonetheless, he is still debbie’s uncle. she is, therefore, the grail that he chases after once the evil outsiders/indians have kidnapped her. in the journey to ﬁnd her, ethan rediscovers his sense of humanity. Toward the end of the ﬁlm, rescuing debbie (natalie Wood) from the indians establishes the hero’s emancipation from racism. The signiﬁcant point about these quests is that they exist in tandem. They can be different methods to push forward the ﬁlm’s story. for instance, a love story can be a marriage quest, progressing parallel with a grail quest: Wyatt earp is in love with Clementine in My Darling Clementine (1946), but he also seeks out his brother’s murderers. The next point is that, in different cinematic cultures, some of the details of the hero’s evolution throughout the narrative can differ. in the case of Japanese period ﬁlms, the main difference is the absence of the romantic ending found in most American ﬁlms. sybil Anne Thornton, in The Japanese Period Film (2008), believes that although “winning” a battle is an important trait of the Japanese hero in the period drama ﬁlms, many of these heroes suffer a tragic fate. The novel thought behind this theory is that Thornton engages with the often-somber ending of Japanese hero 13\n\nIntroduction\n\nas a means of categorizing the heroes in Japanese period ﬁlms into three types: tragic hero, anti-hero, and social hero. i disagree with seeing heroes in such ﬁxed categories; nonetheless, Thornton’s categorization of the Japanese heroes is a useful framework. i am also aware that some heroes (for example, those in Kurosawa’s ﬁlms) have the potential to be more diverse and complex. A Kurosawa hero can be a fusion of a tragic hero and a social hero, and not even limited to period drama genres (e.g., Kōichi nishi [Toshiro Mifune] in The Bad Sleep Well). Thornton (2008, pp. 51–52) classiﬁes the tragic hero as one who is “victimized by political slander, defeated and slain on the battleﬁeld, or sentenced to death for carrying out an illegal revenge[;] the Japanese hero falls, loses all there is to lose in life, and dies in great resentment and suffering. The tragic hero is portrayed as conventionally noble and done in by villains, traitors, or fate.” The tragic hero’s destiny is quite similar to that of the heroes of the works of literature inspired by the historical incident of the 47 retainers. Thornton (2008, p. 31) summarizes the incident as follows: “on January 30, 1703, forty-seven former vassals of naganori Asano (1655–1701) of Ako (in what is now Hiroshima prefecture) broke into the residence of yoshinaka Kiro (1641–1703), master of ceremonies to the shogunal house, and took his head to avenge the sentence of ritual suicide imposed on their lord and carried out some twenty months before. fortysix committed suicide on March 20, 1703 [only one of them did not kill himself].” These historical ﬁgures remained true to their former masters to the extent that it led to their physical destruction. nevertheless, from the perspective of Japanese morality and samurai codes of honor, they were the victors. Therefore, their tragic deaths do not mean that their actions were futile. The social impact of their efforts, thanks to works of art, has survived. The second type of hero in Thornton’s work (2008, p. 53) is the antihero/nihilistic hero: “These protagonists are dropouts, outcasts, and criminals. They tend to be youngish, scruffy … and so totally contemptuous of society as to commit the most heinous of crimes, despite the fact that they are, more often than not, members of the bushi caste [samurai]. Whether through mental illness … desperation … betrayal … or disenfranchisement … they have become totally alienated from society and its values.” ian buruma (1984, p. 208) likewise argues that popular heroes in Japanese culture are those who, similar to the anti-hero, are not part of mainstream society: “[in Japanese culture] a large number of popular heroes are drifters, outsiders with no ﬁxed abode, forever going on to the next place.… The 14\n\nIntroduction\n\nronin, who make up the majority of samurai heroes, were ‘wave men,’ wandering around more or less at random.” i suggest that buruma and Thornton, in general, refer to the same type of hero. However, buruma’s ideas are less problematic, since he suggests the overall characteristics of the antihero rather than how he looks (as indicated by Thornton). i criticize Thornton’s approach, for, if the ﬁlms avoid providing the audience with the background story of the anti-hero (which would suggest any betrayal or desperation for the hero), this does not portray him as a nihilistic hero. Kurosawa in Yojimbo does not inform the viewers of the hero’s real name, let alone the history of his life. However, the hero in this ﬁlm is still “youngish,” “scruffy” and in conﬂict with class and social values. The third type of Japanese period ﬁlm hero is the social hero. Thornton (2008, p. 53) notes that “[the social hero] is usually based on a historical ﬁgure: lords and magistrates of the upper-samurai rank … prominent merchants … and even gang bosses[.] in the ﬁlms, as established ﬁgures, they tend to be middle-aged or aged (a blessing for stars growing out of their lean and mean looks), impeccably dressed and groomed, benevolent, kind to children, and surrounded by younger, adoring disciples who help them solve people’s personal problems as well as murder mysteries.” once more, some of Thornton’s descriptions can be useful for identifying the hero, but there are lingering questions. The hero in Ikiru (1952) is kind, old and helpful. He is not a hero of a period drama ﬁlm, but he is still a social hero, as he shows concern for the well-being of other human beings. by contrast, Hidetora ichimonji (Tatsuya nakadai), the main hero of Ran (1985), inspired by both shakespeare’s King Lear and Japan’s medieval history, is a tragic hero. He is old and blessed with political power and devoted disciples (the initial characteristics of the social hero). However, the tragic aspect of Ran lies in the fact that the hero’s pride and selﬁshness cause political turmoil in his realm. in doing so, he misses the opportunity to be the type of protagonist that, in Thornton’s theory, would primarily have the characteristics of a social hero.\n\nCultural and Cinematic Approaches to Death Philippe Aries, the french historian and anthropologist, reinvigorated the scholarship of the attitude of westerners toward death. His major books include Western Attitudes toward Death: From the Middle Ages to the Present (1976) and The Hour of Our Death (1981). 15\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmong Aries’ ideas about death, there is one point that is particularly relevant to my work. He identiﬁes four historical stages in european and north American attitudes toward death: tamed death (from antiquity until the Middle Ages); one’s own death (from the Middle Ages until the mid– 18th century); thy or other person’s death (from the 18th century until the early 20th century); and forbidden/private death (current era). Western ﬁlms are concerned with stories that occur mainly in 19th-century America (the period of “thy death”); however, the actual productions occurred during the fourth stage (the era of forbidden death). both ford and Leone, as Kitses (2004), frayling (2000) and others suggest, used the genre as a strategy for telling stories that supposedly happened in the past, but the values and moralities of the characters are relatable to the present time. since most of ford’s and some of Leone’s heroes have no fear of the threat of death (similar to the heroes of ancient and medieval literature), their deaths are like Aries’ idea of “tamed death.” This scenario is also due to the norms of Western genre, which, like other action-based genres, depict or treat the threat of death as a normal aspect of its characters’ lifestyles—whether a sheriff, a cavalry oﬃcer, or a bounty hunter, they all face the threat of death. related to ﬁlms, Hagin (2010, pp. 4–5) offers three structures that death creates for the storyline: “it can be an initial death, which begins a storyline and is a cause of subsequent events; an intermediary death, which is both an effect and a cause within a storyline; and a story-terminating death, which ends a storyline and is an effect of previous events.”2 He additionally views the process of dying as a strategy for showing enlightenment within the structure of Hollywood ﬁlms: “for Plato, it was the philosopher, the knower, who had to die in order to gain knowledge of the pre-existing truth” (p. 12). in ford’s Westerns, this knowledge is often the moral and political righteousness of the American nation. Hagin (2010, pp. 12–13) applies his theory to the opus of classical Hollywood: in classical Hollywood ﬁlms, death can bring about a shift from ignorance to knowledge. it can be a discovery of new information or the disclosure of a secret. it can also be more of a change in attitude than in the actual information that is known, the complex epistemology of growing up or coming out, a shift from falsehoods to honesty, from self-delusion and childish lack of responsibility to acknowledgment and accountability, and from disavowal, avoidance, belittling, make-belief, playing, joking, pretence, or “passing” to call for authenticity and genuineness.\n\nThe above quote leads us to one of the major themes in Hagin’s theory— that death, as a part of everyday reality, shapes the morality of society: 16\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Mortality seems to purify falsehoods of the past. it is as if the arrival of the death itself, the real event, somehow puts an end to games, illusions, and lies. The importance, the grave seriousness, of death could allow no more of those deceptions” (2010, p. 18). This function of the theme of death is visible in ford’s ﬁlms, where the threat of death challenges the way a society or community perceives itself. The death of either the villain (who tries to harm the community) or the hero (who protects the community from harm) functions as a wake-up call for the community to become aware of the dangers that threaten its safety. Hagin furthers his study of the theme of death in classic ﬁlms in contextualizing the “cult of death” as a subtheme of death. He formulates this notion based on the ideas of the french philosopher and sociologist Jeanfrançois Lyotard regarding the concept of “beautiful death” in the Athenian civilization. The cult of death in genre ﬁlms means that once a moral character is dead, his family members or friends form a cult to propagate his memory. in action genres, the cult of death usually accompanies a revenge motif. in the end, by obliterating society’s villains, the hero (whether consciously or unconsciously) betters the community and society. The idea of the cult of death is not limited to western culture and art; as this study will demonstrate, this philosophy is shared by most cultures. regarding Japanese attitude toward a warrior death, three of the historically signiﬁcant Japanese books that have contextualized the relation between a Japanese warrior and death are Miyamoto Musashi’s The Five Rings (2012), inazo nitobe’s Bushido: The Soul of Japan 3 (2001), and yamamoto Tsunetomo’s Hagakure (2008). The samurai codes of honor and conduct that have signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced Japanese period ﬁlms, including Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, oblige the members of the warrior class to be at peace once they encounter death. As we shall see, Kurosawa has a critical approach toward the samurai codes. for this reason, he characterizes his heroes and villains as individuals who typically do not follow these codes to the letter. speaking of the cultural ethos of the religious attitude toward a warrior’s death in the Japanese culture, nitobe (2001, p. 11) writes, “[buddhism] furnished a sense of calm trust in fate, a quiet submission to the inevitable, that stoic composure in sight of danger or calamity, that disdain of life and friendliness with death.” This idea is similar to the idea of tamed death in western thought because, as Aries (1976, p. 13) suggests, death is always “close” and “near” in the minds of people. Also, Campbell (2008, p. 306), referring to the hero’s death in various cultures, argues, “The last act in the biography of the hero is that of the death or departure. Here the whole 17\n\nIntroduction\n\nsense of the life is epitomised. needless to say, the hero would be no hero if death held for him any terror; the ﬁrst condition is reconciliation with the grave.” films, which are the products of later cultural eras than the historical epochs Campbell studies, challenge and reshape these old attitudes. in classic ﬁlms, if a protagonist dies, his death is usually a peaceful event. i do not suggest that a digniﬁed death in ﬁlms equals a nonviolent death; rather it means dying for morally approved goals from a conservative point of view that a classic ﬁlm promotes. nitobe (2001, p. 5) also writes, “[Bushido] is not a written code; at best it consists of a few maxims handed down from the pen of some well-known warrior or savant.… it was an organic growth of decades and centuries of a military career.” related to this idea, barry d. steben, in his preface to yamamoto Tsunetomo’s Hagakure (the original Japanese text dates to the early 18th century), writes that “Bushido—the Way of the Warrior—has long been regarded in Japan as an aesthetic of living, an approach to life that turns living—and dying—into an art” (Tsunetomo, 2008, p. 7). it is not surprising that the warrior mentality is the national attitude in Japanese culture. Historically, the samurai class (bushi) was the most important part of the Japanese social pyramid after the shogunate clans. As Tsunetomo (2008) suggests, even during the Tokugawa era (1603–1868), when the country was at peace and samurai were gloriﬁed bureaucrats, they still preserved their social prestige and signiﬁcance. The question here is what precisely this attitude demands from its followers regarding death. The observations of Tsunetomo (2008, p. 25) offer one possible answer to this query: “i have found that bushido means to die. it means that when one has to choose between life and death, one just quickly chooses the side of death.” He also proposes that death should not be a “dog’s death”—that is, dying for an unworthy cause. Honorable death, for a samurai/warrior, means dying while following the orders of the bakufu (clan), carrying on his giri (obligation/ duty), and saving his own or his class’s image and reputation. The idea of dying with honor can be juxtaposed with the attitudes toward death exhibited in epic ﬁlms such as classic Westerns. similar to the honoriﬁc attitude of death among the samurai class, the Western hero has to submit to death willingly and with no fear. by contrast, Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) offers a different attitude toward death, honor, and social status. The philosophy and ideas of Musashi aim to teach the warrior class the moral path to winning battles and living rather than dying. in his lifetime, Musashi fought for many clans (unlike Tsunetomo, who had no war experience). Musashi was also a ronin who 18\n\nIntroduction\n\nused his swordsmanship for the beneﬁt of various lords. david K. Groff, in the introduction of The Five Rings4 (2012, p. 7), writes, “Miyamoto Musashi is known in Japan as a kensei, a ‘sword saint’—a title reserved for those who go so deeply in perfecting the art of swordsmanship that they achieve a deep spiritual enlightenment through it.” Although Musashi’s teachings are different from Tsunetomo’s, he does not suggest cowardice in facing the threat of death. My understanding of Musashi’s writings is that he believes that a warrior’s focus must be on winning the battle rather than on dying. A clear example of such an attitude can be found in Kurosawa’s Sanjuro (1962). At one point, the hero is tied to a tree and surrounded by his enemies. instead of being preoccupied with dying with honor, as Tsunetomo would advocate, he manipulates his enemies to send out a signal that brings a group of young samurai to his rescue. furthermore, Musashi has conceptualized dying with honor as a privilege of the general public rather than the province of one speciﬁc class. nitobe (2001) sees honoriﬁc death as limited solely to the warrior class because its members have achieved a sense of giri (personal honor/duty). However, Musashi (cited in Tsunetomo, 2008, p. 23) argues that anyone who is bound by his/her duty can be privileged with giri: People usually imagine that the samurai generally thinks about nothing but devoting himself to the way of dying. yet in the way of dying, there is no distinction between samurai, buddhist priests, women and the lower classes from the peasants on down. All of them know the principles of gratitude and honor [giri], all have a sense of shame, and all are capable of making up their minds to die for these principles. The way of the samurai in the practice of the martial arts is rooted in the resolution to be superior to other people in all things, and it consists in striving to establish one’s reputation and position in the world by winning in a single combat or winning in a battle against several people, both for the sake of one’s lord and for the sake of oneself. This is all possible through the virtue of the martial arts.\n\nin Kurosawa’s works, when a ﬁlm’s character dies with honor, his/her death serves as a social equalizer. Hence Musashi’s idea of giri is a signiﬁcant aspect of Kurosawa’s heroes. These heroes are concerned with social injustice, death, and honor. Likewise, they do not necessarily belong to the warrior class or a speciﬁc historical epoch. An excellent example is the character of Kenji Watanabe (Takashi shimura) in Ikiru. He is neither a samurai nor an army oﬃcer. rather, he is a middle-class bureaucrat living in post–second World War Tokyo who learns of his impending death from stomach cancer. He does his best to overcome bureaucratic obstacles to build a playground out of a piece of deserted land. His struggle to achieve a positive 19\n\nIntroduction\n\ngoal, his sense of ethics and his diligence portray him as a classic ﬁlm hero. on a cold winter night, he dies peacefully in the playground he has worked so hard to build. This is a clear example of Kurosawa’s humanistic attitude—the hero, regardless of the ﬁlm genre, dies having accomplished his moral goal. The essence of Kurosawa’s heroes is their humanity, sense of duty toward others and response to the different hardships of life and social corruptions. The ronin in Yojimbo (1961) can be criticized for failing to live by the bushido codes. nonetheless, his attitude is understandable, for the hero, like most people, wants to make a small fortune. We can make the same criticism in the case of Leone’s hero in A Fistful of Dynamite (1971). on the surface, the hero (a bandit turned revolutionary) is radically different from classic Western heroes. similar to the ronin in Yojimbo, he initially engages with the villains to make a fortune. Although his moralities are different from, for example, ford’s heroes, he, like the hero in Yojimbo, still undertakes the morally approved deed at the end (in the case of the Yojimbo, the hero stands up to the villains, while in Leone’s ﬁlm the hero joins the Mexican revolution).\n\nThe Hero’s Tragic Death in Film Narrative The ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone include examples of tragic death and incidents, rather than being only tragic tales. Clifford Leech’s comparison of epics and tragedy can be linked to this idea. in Tragedy (1969, p. 30) he writes, “Where epic and tragedy essentially differ, apart from the fact of performances, is that in epic we have ‘tragic moments’ in a context which is characterized by amplitude and variety rather than concentration and crisis.” since tragic elements have played a role in many epic tales, from Homer to Tolkien (in literature), and from d.W. Griﬃth to Peter Jackson (in genre ﬁlms), the presence of tragedy in the ﬁlm’s story is one of the ordeals that challenge the hero’s position. furthermore, the tragic elements of Leone’s and Kurosawa’s ﬁlms are close to the observations of Hegel and nietzsche. Leech (1969, pp. 22–23) argues that “[t]he ‘tragic sense of life’— in Hegel, in Kierkegaard, in nietzsche … implies … that our situation is necessarily tragic, that all men exist in an evil situation and, if they are aware, are anguished because they are aware.” in this rather bleak outlook on life, a ﬁlm can easily conclude with the hero failing to achieve the idealistic goals of most heroes in classic Western ﬁlms. nevertheless, as i will 20\n\nIntroduction\n\ndemonstrate in more detail further in this book, no matter how severe the hero’s existentialist crisis is, in Kurosawa and Leone ﬁlms he discovers methods and ways to cope with the aforesaid “tragic sense of life.” in short, the point of human life is to live, despite the presence of the forces that aim to extinguish it. The main similarity between the ﬁlms of Kurosawa and those of Leone is that, for both, human life is sacred. The difference is that Kurosawa shows more examples of social idealism, whereas a sense of cynicism dominates Leone’s ﬁlms. The ﬁrst part of Leech’s argument is one of the key foundations of Western and samurai ﬁlms; the tragic death of the hero and its signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁlm’s conclusion are elements that bring American, Japanese and european ﬁlms close together. There is no doubt that oriental and occidental art and literature, beyond their similarities, differ regarding the historical, social and cultural concerns on which they reﬂect. However, an individual’s death and its potentially tragic consequences are two areas where the Western ﬁlms of ford and Leone are similar to the period ﬁlms of Kurosawa. Likewise, Kurosawa’s westernization (namely, the inﬂuence of western visual and written texts on his cinematic vision) brings the idea of tragedy in his ﬁlms closer to western tragedies. Leone observes the bleakness of life more as an ironic concept in his ﬁlms. This does not mean that death and destruction of the innocent are not somber events in his ﬁlms; as Part Two will demonstrate, through this sense of irony, Leone criticizes unnecessary death rather than ignoring its adverse effect on humanity. As part of this ironic approach to matters of life and death, Leone’s heroes respond to the threat of death in unique ways. Leone’s heroes, in contrast to Kurosawa’s heroes, do not concern themselves with the well-being of others. rather, Leone’s protagonists move forward in a ﬁnancial sense. They use their mental and physical capabilities to accumulate a fortune; the hero is acquiring a great wealth in tandem with the destruction of the villains. However, this does not mean the termination of the elements that have made the antagonists evil. in Leone’s ﬁlms, even if the hero succeeds, the other characters are not guaranteed to have a less tragic and troubled life beyond the time limit of the storyline. This situation contrasts with Kurosawa’s works, where the hero’s actions may make life more endurable for others. The exception to this rule is Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars, which is a direct remake (with two additional scenes—the shooting in the cemetery, and the massacre of the soldiers on the riverbank) of Kurosawa’s Yojimbo. The next point is that tragic Greek plays have inﬂuenced the Western 21\n\nIntroduction\n\nﬁlm genre as well. Pantelis Michelakis, in Greek Tragedy on Screen (2013, p. 132), refers to this inﬂuence: “Greek tragedy, helps the legitimization of the western as a ﬁlm genre, the valorization of ﬁlm genres as worthy descendants or competitors of classical literary genres, and ﬁnally the sanction of the myth of the genre as a ﬁxed and pure category with essential qualities.” furthermore, Michelakis, referring to Laurence Giavarini’s arguments, suggests some aspects of this inﬂuence: “The [W]estern, like tragedy, belonged to a speciﬁc space and time[;] it was about the frontier, which is nothing other than a transformation of the boundary, and of a particular savage state in humans” (2013, p. 133). This frontier could recall Mackey-Kallis’ idea of the wasteland, given that the hero, in his journey and through his actions, transforms the wasteland/frontier. in addition, John simons, in Peckinpah’s Tragic Westerns (2011), argues that the revenge elements of the Christian tragedy have a strong presence in classic Westerns as well. The focus of this type of tragedy is on the hero’s revenge against the villains that have mistreated him. simons (2011, p. 22) deﬁnes this concept as “Christian tragedy … [with an] emphasis on heroic sacriﬁce and the effects of such sacriﬁce on the fallen world the hero occupies and to some extent redeems.” The idea of the Christian tragedy relates to the notion mentioned above regarding “balance.” That is, throughout the narrative, the villains will challenge and, at times, hurt the good and virtuous, just as the villainous Clanton family kills two of Wyatt earp’s brothers in ford’s My Darling Clementine; by the end of the ﬁlm, the hero responds to this challenge by killing the villains. despite the inﬂuence that western art and literature had on several aspects of Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, including their tragic elements, he nevertheless made ﬁlms within the Japanese studio system (which, as explained earlier, allows directors more artistic freedom than directors in Hollywood). Kurosawa, in his autobiography (1983), refers to the inﬂuence of the tragic elements of shakespeare’s plays and dostoevsky’s novels on his own mentality. Time and location separated these two writers, but there are similarities between their works. both writers deal with heroes who live in a tragic world but seek to improve the world around them by challenging what they consider its demons. steiner (1961, p. 16), writing about the elizabethan plays, can relate to the effects of shakespearian dialogue in Kurosawa’s vision: “in elizabethan theatre, the idea of tragedy lost its medieval directness … the sense of [tragedy] reached beyond the fall of individual greatness.… The sense of life is itself shadowed by a feeling of tragedy.” These same ideas apply to many of Kurosawa’s heroes, as he shows them 22\n\nIntroduction\n\ntangled in situations where political, social and personal evils (such as war, political turmoil or physical and psychological illness) overshadow law, humanity, and virtues. it is part of the hero’s mission to challenge such evils. in addition, Kurosawa’s hero is not necessarily concerned with personal glory and survival. That is why he often attempts to understand and better the lives of others. The methods through which the threat of death can enlighten and motivate an individual differ among the heroes portrayed by ford, Kurosawa, and Leone, as will be explored later in this book. However, the current section is focused on common ground. The question is how this education, related to death and the tragic moments of the ﬁlms, contributes to the hero’s discovery of his abilities. Campbell argues that there are hidden powers and skills in all human beings. An individual evolves to become a hero as he realizes his previously undiscovered powers during his life journey. Campbell (2008, pp. 204–205) states, “The individual, through prolonged psychological disciplines, gives up completely all attachment to his personal limitations, idiosyncrasies, hopes, and fears, no longer resists the selfannihilation that is prerequisite to rebirth in the realization of truth … [and] becomes, that is to say, an anonymity.” This can mean that a tragic incident, such as the death of the hero’s loved ones, functions as a psychological ordeal that tests an individual’s mental and physical abilities. sir Philip sidney’s concept of the “Golden World” in poetry can be linked to the latter point. Leech (1969, p. 33), in his interpretations of sidney’s Golden World, argues that the Golden World “is not a world where everything is good, but a world where things exist in a pure rather than a mixed form. What is important is the sense of full, or at least unusual, the realization of the powers and tendencies peculiar to man. orestes kills his mother, oedipus marries his mother and kills his father, Medea kills her children: yet they are, in a sense, more fully themselves than men and women usually dare to be.” These morbid and somehow cruel comments illustrate the existentialist character of some well-known heroes. i reason, however, that the hero’s “realization of the powers and tendencies peculiar to man” is the aspect of sidney’s ideas that can be linked to ﬁlms and the effects of tragedy on the hero’s position in the story. Therefore, these tragic occurrences can be opportunities that motivate an ordinary man, in overcoming his fears and insecurities, to relate to his inner powers and become a hero. This situation also applies to action-based and historical ﬁlms, where, in most cases, the hero, overwhelmed by life tragedies, begins a journey (Campbell calls this the “call of adventure”) in 23\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhich he will discover/rediscover his emotional and physical strength. once the hero successfully overcomes threats of death, he gains the ability to function as a symbol for all humankind (or at least the ﬁlm audience). The writings of Leech and dorothea Krook on the tragic hero in literature can be linked to my ideas. The former says, “The tragic hero … is ‘one of us.’ He is not necessarily virtuous, not necessarily free from profound guilt. What he is is a man who reminds us strongly of our own humanity, who can be accepted as standing for us” (Leech, 1969, p. 46). Krook’s ideas suggest a similar principle; she points out that the hero “is represented in a special sense. He is all mankind: representative of all humanity in embodying some fundamental, persistent aspect of man’s nature.… in showing in his suffering and his knowledge the necessary common ground with his fellow creatures to make these truly exemplary and instructive” (Krook, 1969, pp. 36–37). These ideas are applicable to those heroes of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone that are directly involved in the process of unifying a nation. However, Leech and Krook focus on how tragedies are concerned with how to be human, whereas ford, Kurosawa, and Leone demonstrate how to be a human being while dealing with the signiﬁcant political, social and economic changes that occur in their respective societies. in addition, in these ﬁlms, the hero’s shortcomings are part of their humanity. The archetypal hero’s encounter with death/the threat of death (and his response to the tragedy/potential tragedy element of death) shows the depth of his moral concern for the good of humanity. i apply Campbell’s theory regarding the archetypal hero, and his connection to the theme of death, to this book’s discussions. Although heroes in diverse cultural/social/cinematic settings can be similar, according to the genre conventions that govern these characters and their social/historical contextualization, they evolve into complex individuals that enrich the ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone. This is where the theme of death performs a pivotal role. The hero’s death, or his survival of the threat of death, inﬂuences the narrative in various directions. The main body of The Hero and the Grave: The Theme of Death in the Films of John Ford, Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone includes four parts. The ﬁrst part, “fundamental functions of death Within the narrative,” studies the attitudes of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone toward conventional heterosexual romance. This section will further explain the characteristics of the two major subthemes of the theme of death—the cycle of life and the cult of death—in the ﬁlms of these directors. i will also study how these two concepts can function as fundamental strategies to advance the plot in 24\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe ﬁlms of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone. in this section, i shall offer a close reading of death in ford’s Stagecoach (1939) and My Darling Clementine (1946); Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950); and Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (1964). The reason for choosing ﬁlms as case studies in this and subsequent parts of the book is that, together, they will offer a rich and unexplained ground for comparative analysis of the works of these three directors based on the theme of death. in Parts Two, Three and four, i shall consider the variations of death in works of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone. These variations are death in battle, suicide and natural death. in these sections, i will study the representation and the functions of the cycle of life and the cult of death in the case of each type of death. Additionally, i will study how each of the previously mentioned types of death affects the hero’s position in the ﬁlms. The second part, “The Hero’s Position and the Theme of death in battle,” tackles the complicated relationship between the theme of death in battle and the cycle of life/cult of death as represented in a ﬁlm’s conclusion. These issues will be the center of my close analysis of ford’s Fort Apache (1948); Kurosawa’s Kagemusha (1980); and Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The third part, “narrative Attitude Toward the Hero’s suicide,” argues that the hero’s suicide can leave two ideological marks on a ﬁlm. first, suicide redeems the hero/anti-hero from their past life as long as this past, according to generic codes of Western or jidaigeki ﬁlms, is morally stigmatized. second, an act of self-destruction portrays the despairing mentality that a character (usually a minor character) endures. These two types of suicide shape and inﬂuence the relationship between the hero and the cycle of life and cult of death. The case studies for this section include ford’s 3 Godfathers (1948) and 7 Women (1967); Kurosawa’s Red Beard (1965); and Leone’s For a Few Dollars More (1965) and A Fistful of Dynamite (1971). The last part, “The Hero’s natural death: narrating the Past and the Way of the future,” classiﬁes and observes the similarities and differences between the approaches of ford, Kurosawa, and Leone regarding natural death in their ﬁlms. This section will (a) compare ford and Kurosawa’s attitudes toward death due to illness, and (b) explain the general implications of a lack of natural death in Leone’s ﬁlms. The analyses of the fourth section will mainly be concerned with ford’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962); Kurosawa’s Red Beard; and Leone’s Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\n25\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART ONE\n\nFundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\n1 Romantic Involvement and Redemption As part of the Western genre epistemology and, indeed, most visual and literary traditions, romantic attachment to women challenges the male hero’s initial position in the narrative. Additionally, in certain cases, romance serves as one aspect of the atonement of a criminal or an antihero from his previous behavior and misdeeds, as is the case with Ringo (John Wayne) in Ford’s Stagecoach (1939). At other times, the hero does not form a permanent union with a woman, instead having a short-lived platonic relationship with her, as is the case in Shane (1953, dir. George Stevens). To understand the position of love in ﬁlms and its relation to the theme of death, I will study the basic ideas of romance. Rewarding the hero with romantic attachment is a common theme in most ancient cultures and myths. Campbell (2008, p. 91) calls this situation the “ultimate adventure” of the hero: “The ultimate adventure, when all the barriers and ogres [of the male hero’s id] have been overcome, is commonly represented as a mystical marriage of the triumphant hero-soul with the Queen Goddess of the world. This is the crisis at the nadir, at the zenith, or at the uttermost edge of the temple, or in the darkness of the deepest chamber of the heart.” Put more simply, once the hero successfully defeats his enemies, he will marry his love interest. Since the hero represents the inner goodness of mankind, his enemies represent what is wrong with mankind, and marriage with his beloved connects the hero to all that is good and morally pure. Likewise, Northrop Frye, in Anatomy of Criticism (1973, p. 186), observes the presence of the theme of romantic love in written texts as a way of encoding bigger ideological concerns: “In every age, the ruling social or intellectual class tends to project its ideals in some form of romance, where the virtuous heroes and beautiful heroines represent the ideals and the villains the threats to their ascendancy.” 28\n\n1. Romantic Involvement and Redemption\n\nThese arguments on the ideology of love in the written western text and its effects on the hero’s journey are similar to the Western genre conventions. The storytelling tradition to which Western heroes are assigned is one that Wexman, in Richard Neupert’s The End: Narration and Closer in the Cinema (1995, p. 44), calls “dynastic nostalgia.” This conventional happy ending includes one or more of the following elements: the death of the villain(s), the hero’s emotional involvement with a wife/sweetheart and the hero’s discovery of a new home/state of mind. As a result, the newly forged family enhances the value of the ethics and morals that the actions of the villain were deﬁling during the ﬁlm. The above structure is readily perceived in the case of Ford’s Stagecoach. Ringo’s initial goal is avenging the deaths of his father and brother, murdered by the Plummer boys. He encounters Dallas on his journey of revenge, falls in love with her and asks her to marry him. However, involvement with Dallas does not alter Ringo’s goal of confronting his rivals. He has no legal duty to encounter his family’s murderers; nevertheless, he has the same generic obligation that classic heroes usually have: to fulﬁll their moral responsibility. Hagin (2010, p. 17) speaks about the morality of the victorious heroes in classic Westerns: “The victor in the shootout … is not the most skillful (although sometimes nothing contradicts this), but the one who has followed the correct path and was the most ‘moral.’” In the case of Ringo, his moral goal/duty is to avenge his family. He faces their killers in a standoff and kills them. Thus he has fulﬁlled his quest, and the villains have paid for their crimes. The question is how the romantic attachment to a woman relates to the theme of death. Buscombe (1992, p. 59) writes, “Women in the Western represent the alternative to violence. Characteristically, the hero is faced with a choice: either he follows his code, which demands that he face physical danger and meet evil with force, or he chooses romance. What the woman offers is always the easy way out.” The idea of a hero facing two options is often accurate, but the hero usually ends up with both in the end (e.g., High Noon [1952]). A hero often meets his love interest when he is pursuing other goals. The effect of this encounter is that if the hero does not have an entirely moral past, like Ringo, he has now a chance for a moral life. This view slightly contradicts Buscombe’s conclusion, for it argues that romantic involvement does not necessarily mean a way out of generic codes and goals. In classic genres such as the Western, the protagonist can be in love and still pursue his goal, assuming that it is a moral one and will contribute to the civic progress of the society. 29\n\nPart One—Fundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\nThe hero’s union with the woman he loves becomes possible only after standing up to the villains. In classic Westerns, potential marriage with such a woman is one of the leading foundations of an ethical and civilized society, and thus her presence is necessary for the historical transformations of the American nation. Andre Bazin (2009, p. 155), in his seminal work What Is Cinema?, writes on this matter, “The myth of the western illustrates, and both initiates and conﬁrms woman in her role as vestal of the social virtues, of which the chaotic world is so greatly in need. Within her is concealed the physical future, and by way of the institution of the family to which she aspires as the root is drawn to the earth, its mortal foundation.” In the case of Stagecoach, instead of being free from any legal and moral commitment, Ringo adopts what is unknown and alien to him: a potential family and settled life. I also suggest that in Ford’s ﬁlms, the leading hero can be redeemed from his past conduct when he is about to reach or when he tries to achieve his goals. This redemption occurs at several levels and thus changes the hero’s position in multiple directions. Consider the case of Ringo. The ﬁrst time he is introduced to the audience, he is a young single man and a fugitive from the law, and his primary goal is avenging the deaths of his father and brother. By the ﬁlm’s conclusion, in addition to killing the Plummer boys, he has traveled through the wasteland that is the desert, encountered Indians, fought them victoriously and contributed to saving the lives of the passengers of the stagecoach; he has also, after confessing his love for Dallas, asked her to marry him and received her consent. So, on the way to reach his initial goal (seeking revenge), he is given two more goals—namely, ﬁghting the Indians and establishing a morally sanctioned partnership with the woman he loves. At the end of the ﬁlm, Ringo informs Dallas that he should serve his prison sentence before marrying her. However, the marshal (who serves as the ﬁlm’s agent for promoting moral and traditional romance) permits Ringo to abscond with Dallas, though in doing so he departs from his role as the protector of the law. Regardless, Ringo’s earlier decision proves that he has reached the civilized maturity through which law and order must be preserved, even if this means he must return to prison. Moreover, since Dallas is single, her involvement with Ringo poses no moral obstacles. As part of the ﬁlm’s conclusion, they travel toward his farm, an indication that they will create a family together. Ringo’s character transitions from a fugitive to a law-abiding person who respects legal judgments, from a lone avenger to a protector who defends the innocent, and from an uninvolved bachelor to a potential husband. In some cases, the death of the Ford’s supporting heroes (like Hatﬁeld 30\n\n1. Romantic Involvement and Redemption\n\nin Stagecoach) marks their redemption. Hatﬁeld is redeemed on one level only: he goes from being a gambler to a martyr. This could be because he is a supporting hero in the ﬁlm, and his role carries less archetypal signiﬁcance than the main lead. Hatﬁeld’s only goal is to save Mrs. Mallory from the attack of the Indians. Hatﬁeld does not have a marriage quest, due primarily to Hollywood’s traditional approach to love. His involvement with Mrs. Mallory does not result in sexual union, for she is a married woman. Hence, Ford portrays Hatﬁeld as the type of hero who is acting according to the dictates of conventional morality, for he never makes any advances toward Mrs. Mallory. Hatﬁeld’s death, beyond symbolizing the defeated Southern aristocratic society, has a redemptive quality. Although he dies in the process of saving Mrs. Mallory, he reconnects with his roots as a Southern aristocrat who helps those who are in the same social class as himself. Therefore, he mentions his father just before he dies; Hatﬁeld, at the hour of his death, is reaching his birth identity. His death informs the audience of his past story. Hagin (2010, pp. 12–13) notes that “in classical Hollywood ﬁlms, death can bring about a shift from ignorance to knowledge. It can be a discovery of new information or the disclosure of a secret.” By giving this information to the audience, Ford clariﬁes Hatﬁeld’s backstory; this untold story is what Bordwell et al. call “retardation,” deﬁned as follows: “Every [plot] uses retardation to postpone complete construction of the [story]. At the very least, the end of the story, or the means whereby we arrive there, will be withheld” (1985, p. 52). Therefore, Hatﬁeld’s death also functions to encompass the story, or at least his portion of the story in the ﬁlm. Concepts of love and redemption work well in the case of Ford’s Westerns since the genre codes have established romance as part of the narrative, whereas romance is usually absent from Japanese period ﬁlms, including those of Kurosawa, who admits in Cardullo (2008, p. 6) that “[w]omen simply aren’t my speciality.” The romantic attachment between the hero and his love interest in Kurosawa’s samurai ﬁlms does not have the same redemptive quality of Ford’s Western ﬁlms. This may be one reason why women do not have the same ideological signiﬁcance in Kurosawa’s ﬁlms compared to Ford’s works. However, now and then, as is the case with Sanjuro, Kurosawa’s male heroes encounter women who educate them on how to be a mature and caring human being, but the hero cannot be romantically involved with these women because of their old age or their class status (they are nobles whereas the hero is from the warrior class). In other cases, like Rashomon, corrupt sexual attraction replaces romance. 31\n\nPart One—Fundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\nDespite the general lack of sexual love in Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, romance (similar to Ford’s ﬁlms) is at times part of his ﬁlms’ narrative structure. In these rare cases, Kurosawa, on the surface, follows the conventions of a typical romantic story. On this point, Mellen (2002, p. 13) writes, “[In Seven Samurai] Katsushiro’s passion for farmer Manzo’s daughter, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), contains the universal deﬁance of young love, a passion which transcends class, history, time or expectation.” However, the outcome of this romance is different from Ford’s approach to love in his ﬁlms. In Seven Samurai, Katsushiro relinquishes his love for the village girl and, as a result, returns to his generic obligations. It should be said that, as Prince has suggested, during the 16th century (when the story of Seven Samurai is set), the samurai class was not separated from farming communities; thus the love story could have worked. However, I argue that Kurosawa is engaged with an approach from the Edo era regarding this romance since that class culture is better known to the audience. If Katsushiro’s relationship with the village girl had evolved, he would have stayed in the village with his beloved and followed his wishes (ninjo) rather than becoming a samurai and following his sense of giri (duty). Before I analyze the effects of the lack of romance on the Rashomon narrative, it is necessary to provide a summary of the ﬁlm’s story, as the narrative of Rashomon is a complex one. Rashomon begins with the meeting of a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), a Buddhist priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) amid the ruins of a Buddhist temple. While the three men are taking shelter from the rain, the woodcutter and the priest recall the events of a trial they attended earlier that day. Their story follows the accounts of four eyewitnesses to the murder of a samurai—a bandit, the samurai’s wife, a medium connected to the dead samurai’s spirit, and the woodcutter; each witness’s story differs from the next. The bandit Tajōmaru (Toshiro Mifune) confesses to raping the samurai’s wife (Machiko Kyō) and then killing the warrior (Masayuki Mori). The samurai’s wife, however, pleads guilty to killing her husband, whereas the spirit (as conveyed by the medium) admits that the samurai killed himself. Lastly, the woodcutter says that the bandit murdered the samurai in a very gritty manner. In Kurosawa’s Rashomon, a samurai, who is the symbol of ethics and authority, behaves in a manner that goes against the rules of bushi. These actions contrast with Ford’s approach to archetypes of the Western genre and relate signiﬁcantly to Leone’s attitude toward those same archetypes, as the cowboys in Leone’s ﬁlms do not act according to the classic Western’s codes of conduct. 32\n\n1. Romantic Involvement and Redemption\n\nRashomon shows the warrior to be an individual who, in contrast to the ethics of the samurai class, is seeking ﬁnancial fortune. His lack of respect for conservative rules of his social class overtakes his wife as well: Kurosawa positions the warrior’s wife as a character who does not follow the ethical norms of the time that this ﬁlm portrays. Either a victim of sexual assault or a partner in her husband’s death, she is associated with sexual deprivation. The corrupt attitudes of these characters reﬂect the historical period that the ﬁlm covers. Prince (1991, p. 128) argues that the historical era that is the setting for this ﬁlm (the 12th century) “seemed to be the period known in Buddhist prophecy as ‘the end of the law’ when human life would fall to its point of greatest degeneracy.” I argue that the undigniﬁed death of a samurai and the impossibility of knowing the truth behind his demise are the ways through which Kurosawa depicts this era. Among the ﬁlm’s characters, only the Buddhist priest appears to be decent. However, he, too, has his doubts about the teachings of Buddha. By the end of the ﬁlm, however, his faith is restored when the woodcutter adopts an abandoned newborn baby. This infant is a symbol of the innocence and purity that the adults lack. By adopting the baby, the woodcutter takes his ﬁrst step toward achieving this purity (even if he is not conscious of it). The adoption also explains the evolution of the priest’s character in the story. The priest initially represents the lack of trust in the goodness of men. Witnessing the incident brought to the court and becoming involved with the legal procedures of the case has gradually made him a cynic. James Goodwin, in Akira Kurosawa and Intertextual Cinema (1994, p. 137), writes, “The priest … serves a role similar to the waki no shite (side doer) in Noh theatre. The waki reﬂects the thoughts, emotions, and motives of the main ﬁgure, or shite, though he typically remains a commentator rather than an agent in the play’s action.” This is one of the priest’s roles: he is an outside observer who speaks about the dearth of decency among human beings. At ﬁrst, he has a very general view of this lack and does not express any thoughts on people’s ability to be moral beings. Nonetheless, his mentality changes when the woodcutter adopts the baby. The priest praises the woodcutter’s action, for it has restored his hope in humanity. Additionally, the troubled woodcutter in Rashomon, as Goodwin (1994) puts it, realizes that he has a new choice in life as he gets involved with society. Initially, he removes himself from the community—that is, he conceals the truth about the samurai’s death from the court. His position changes when he becomes the guardian of the newborn baby. The woodcutter’s attitude and conduct can be related to Thornton’s idea of the social 33\n\nPart One—Fundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\nhero, even though he is not a high-ranking oﬃcial. Thus, it can be said that, although not a warrior, the woodcutter does something for the future of society. The signiﬁcant point here is that Kurosawa suggests that an individual does not need to belong to the warrior class to take moral actions. Hence, the adoption storyline means that the woodcutter has begun to take notice of other choices in his life. Leone’s ﬁlms, similar to most European Westerns and Japanese period ﬁlms, pay little attention to romance. Nor are his ﬁlms concerned with the cycle of life and starting a family. Leone concentrates more on themes like the extensive moral decay of society, male friendship, and personal survival. This explains why the female characters of his ﬁlms (especially within the Dollar trilogy) are not integrated into a thriving community. The lack of romance can explain the main hero’s emotional and physical avoidance of women in Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars, which is a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo. Leone’s ﬁlm is what Harvey Roy Greenberg, in Constantine Verevis’ Film Remakes (2006, p. 9), calls “the unacknowledged, disguised remake”—that is, “minor or major alterations (in character, time and setting) are undertaken, but the audience is not informed of the original ﬁlm version.” Besides, as Verevis explains (2006, p. 88), “just as Kurosawa had reworked the conventions of the [Japanese period ﬁlm] with a revolutionary approach to swordplay, music and sound effects, Leone transformed the conditions of the European Western, introducing a new kind of realism and a hero who was negative, dirty, who looked like a human being, and who was totally at home with the violence which surrounded him.” The lack of romance affects the relationship between the theme of death and the hero’s redemption from his past actions. To understand this point, ﬁrst, we need to know how the lack of romance is justiﬁed in Leone’s Westerns. In his ﬁlms, Leone does not provide the hero with a moral/ethical role model. This means that there is no one to encourage the hero to seek a settled family life. In these works, ﬁgures of law and order are either unethical (part of criminal organizations) or morally weak (incapable of challenging the established corrupt morality of the community/society in which they live). In A Fistful of Dollars, Baxter is a sheriff and a settled, married man. He is also a criminal. Legally and morally, his hypocrisy cannot offer a role model for the hero. This contrasts with Ford’s ﬁlms, in which, when there is a love story in the plot, there is also a ﬁgure of law and paternal authority that encourages this love (e.g., Marshal Wilcox in Stagecoach). This arrangement may be due to Hollywood’s traditional pres34\n\n1. Romantic Involvement and Redemption\n\nentation of sheriffs as ethical and moral individuals, which gives weight to their validation of the hero’s romantic interests. In addition, as Hagin (2010) contextualizes, the Hollywood ﬁlmmaking guidebooks emphasized the goodness of law ﬁgures. The female characters of Leone’s For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, in their short time on screen, do not undergo any of the changes that women in Ford’s Westerns would experience. These changes, in Ford’s movies, suggest that female characters follow the approved morality of a conservative western society. It also means that, by becoming the love interest of a hero, they can affect the hero’s position in relation to death. In contrast, since Leone’s ﬁlms are more about the individual’s survival, women often do not challenge the hero’s position in the story. For example, in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the ﬁrst unnamed female character to appear (Chelo Alonso) witnesses the murder of her husband and older son by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef). She faints following the tragedy, and the audience does not see her character again. Later, the prostitute Maria (Rada Rassimov) is beaten by Angel Eyes, but this incident does not motivate her to take any action against him. She does not represent the redeemable prostitute that Western ﬁlms such as Ford’s Stagecoach portray. In his Dollar trilogy Leone illustrates a universe that is similar to the classic samurai ﬁlms, in which the masculinity and narcissism of male heroes beget no emotional or sexual connection with women. Kitses (2004, p. 256) writes on this matter, “The absence of women is the most telling comment on the world depicted in the Dollar trilogy. Leone’s avowed interest was in an epic cinema, the province of which ‘by deﬁnition, is a masculine universe.’” As Leone confessed in his interview with Christopher Frayling (2008), his male heroes are not romantic. Instead, they see women as a nuisance interfering with their primary goal of surviving the corrupt environment in which they live. This high degree of individualism means that Leone’s heroes are not concerned with forming groups like a family or community. Hitherto I have argued that the lack of a moral role model can establish the hero’s lack of interest in romance. However, the absence of traditional romance does not mean a lack of redemption or a near-death experience, though the representation of redemption in Leone’s Dollar trilogy is different from Ford’s take on the same concept. In A Fistful of Dollars, the anonymous hero’s assistance to Marisol and her family shows that he has a sense of morality that motivates him to do what is right. Furthermore, by 35\n\nPart One—Fundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\nassigning the hero this secondary function and goal, Leone portrays the hero’s courage in a critical situation. By helping a hapless woman even when he is not in love with her (or, indeed, related to her), the hero compensates for his previous unethical actions. The hero’s initial goal of chasing a fortune is a common trait in European Westerns. Alberto Moravia, in Frayling’s Sergio Leone: Something to Do with Death (2000, p. 118), explains this code: “[In European Westerns t]he dominant theme is no longer the struggle between the lone, intrepid individual and the negative forces of nature and society: the dominant theme is the scramble for money.” However, this desire for ﬁnancial gain does not mean that the hero will not become involved in doing the right thing. In fact, in Leone’s ﬁlms, a signiﬁcant aspect of hero’s rite of passage is that he gets involved with other people’s lives and helps them, even if this means facing the threat of death. At one point, the hero of A Fistful of Dollars informs Marisol of his reason for saving her: “I knew someone like you who no one helped.” Leone avoids telling the audience why the hero did not help this absent character or who she was. The crucial point is that the fate of this unknown character has affected the hero’s motivation. In A Fistful of Dollars, the hero, after helping Marisol, has a near-death experience when he is brutally beaten and tortured by Ramon Rojo and his men. Frayling (2000) and Kitses (2004) have argued that the hero’s torture and near-death experience are a secular version of Jesus’ cruciﬁxion; both heroes are beaten savagely, and both born anew. I suggest that this experience is Leone’s way of signifying the hero’s physical redemption. Once he survives the threat of death, in the ﬁlm’s ﬁnale, he faces the Rojo clan and kills them all to save his innkeeper friend from their abuse and torture. So, it can be argued that surviving the threat of death compels the hero to take moral actions.\n\n36\n\n2 The Cycle of Life The idea of rebirth alters the hero’s initial position in the ﬁlms of Ford, Kurosawa, and Leone. However, since these directors are from diverse cultural and historical backgrounds, there are some variations in their respective takes on this concept. I have identiﬁed the following functions for the cycle of life: (a) transcending the tragic nature of the hero/moral person’s death; (b) continuity of life, and thus of the human race; (c) the rediscovery of once-possessed moral values and attitudes in an individual who is involved directly or indirectly with the cycle of life (either as a parent or as a guardian of a newborn baby); and (d) compensation for the destruction of the life of a dead friend/beloved—that is, the life of a newborn baby replaces the life that has been lost. There are two strategies for showing the hero’s attitude to the cycle of life. First, what I call the “favorable” attitude is seen when a character (usually the hero) either forms a family or tries to do so. The second attitude is what I call “avoidance.” This scenario occurs when the hero circumvents forming a traditional family, whether deliberately or accidentally. In Ford’s ﬁlms, the birth of a new baby (which can happen in the middle of a crisis such as ﬁghting villains) most likely implies the promise of a more civilized and prosperous future for the American people. In this situation, the American society is freed from those evil actions that threaten its safety. In Kurosawa’s ﬁlms, the presence of a newborn baby, and indeed a young child in the plot, suggests the possibility of change in a society/community that is overwhelmed by death and moral decay. However, this change is more on an individualistic level and does not necessarily mean a better and more civilized future for the entire community. In Leone’s ﬁlms the social ethics are lacking, which means that children usually share the same deadly ordeals as the adults; in some cases, children do not even survive the threat of death. The preexisting concept of the cycle of life in the ancient texts involves both the birth of a child and the birth of a new mentality in an individual. 37\n\nPart One—Fundamental Functions of Death Within the Narrative\n\nThe latter option relates to the hero’s romantic attachment to a woman and how the hero’s personality matures during this process. Campbell (2008, p. 16) explains the relationship between birth and death as one of the functions of the cycle of life in ancient epic tales: “Only birth can conquer death— the birth, not of the old thing again, but of something new. Within the soul, within the body social, there must be—if we are to experience long survival—a continuous ‘recurrence of birth’ (palingenesia) to nullify the unremitting recurrences of death.” Campbell here emphasizes the importance of moral and physical rebirth for mankind’s survival. In keeping with Campbell’s argument, I suggest that the idea of birth compensating for the death of individuals is a common theme in ﬁlms of diverse cultural backgrounds. Likewise, there are similarities as well as differences in the cultural and cinematic attitudes of Ford, Kurosawa, and Leone regarding this idea. In Ford’s ﬁlms, women evolve into socially active (within a traditional setting) and responsible individuals (in a conservative sense) who maintain the previously mentioned balance between life and death. In keeping this balance, they contribute to the civic progress of society, not only out of cinematic convention or social expectation but also out of moral conviction. In the classical Hollywood ﬁlms, there are usually two types of motherhood: the physical/biological mother and the caring/nurturing mother. Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt) of Stagecoach falls into the former category, whereas Dallas is the latter type. The ﬁrst type of motherhood sees women only as a “womb” that can give birth. The second category extends to a woman’s nurturing abilities after the birth of her child. Stagecoach is mainly concerned with the second type of motherhood. Although Dallas has nurturing abilities, being a prostitute casts a moral shadow on her potential role as a mother. At the beginning of the ﬁlm, older married women, who represent conservative values, have expelled her from the town. They all dress in head-to-toe grey-colored garments and walk next to each other as a single entity that suggests matrimony and years of settled life. Dallas’ vocation has deﬁned her as a morally compromised person. Even if she cares for the well-being of others, the old women do not recognize her as someone who is capable of being decent and undertaking positive deeds. For them, Dallas’ social position is deﬁnite, and they force her to leave town. The exile scene is the ﬁrst time that Ford portrays her as an outsider from the spectrum of moral value"
