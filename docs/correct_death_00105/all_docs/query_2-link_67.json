        "text": "Without a doubt Japan's, and certainly Toho's, best director. Akira Kurosawa is the best known Japanese director outside of Japan, and his films have been the inspiration for numerous movies around the world such as The Magnificent Seven and Star Wars. After a failed career as a painter, Kurosawa started his career at Toho (Photo Chemical Laboratories at the time) as a assistant director. In 1941 and 1942 he launched his writing career. The very next year, in 1943, he directed his first movie: Sanshiro Sugata . Five years later Kurosawa would meet Toshiro Mifune and cast him in his 1948 movie Drunken Angel. Kurosawa would cast Mifune many more times up until 1965, when after Red Beard the pair had a dispute and split their separate ways. His films have won many awards over the years, including academy awards, as he opened the world of Japanese cinema up to many moviegoers of the west. Many of his western admires have worked with him on projects, such as George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Unfortunately in Japan his films were not as highly regarded, and for the most part the Japanese public looked down on his obviously western influenced films. Thankfully, Kurosawa continued his work and became good friends with director Ishiro Honda, for who he collaborated with on most of his productions near the end of his career.\n\nDirector Toho Filmography\n\nSanshiro Sugata (1943)\n\nThe Most Beautiful (1944)\n\nSanshiro Sugata Part 2 (1945)\n\nThe Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (1945)\n\nThose Who Make Tomorrow (1946)\n\nNo Regrets for Our Youth (1946)\n\nOne Wonderful Sunday (1947)\n\nDrunken Angel (1948)\n\nStray Dog (1949)\n\nIkiru (1952)\n\nSeven Samurai (1954)\n\nI Live In Fear (1955)\n\nThrone of Blood (1957)\n\nThe Lower Depths (1957)\n\nThe Hidden Fortress (1958)\n\nThe Bad Sleep Well (1960)\n\nYojimbo (1961)\n\nSanjuro (1962)\n\nHigh and Low (1963)\n\nRed Beard (1965)\n\nDodes'kaden (1970)\n\nKagemusha (1980)\n\nRan (1985)\n\nDreams (1990)\n\nMadadayo (1993)\n\nAssitant Director Toho Filmography\n\nParadise of the Virgin Flowers (1936)\n\nTokyo Rhapsody (1936)\n\nEnoken's Ten Millions (1936)\n\nEnoken's Ten Millions Sequel (1936)\n\nSaga of the Vagabonds, Part One: Toraokami (1937)\n\nSaga of the Vagabonds, Part Two: Forward at Dawn (1937)\n\nJapanese Women's Textbook (1937)\n\nAvalanche (1937)\n\nA Husband's Chastity: If Spring Comes (1937)\n\nA Husband's Chastity: Aki Futatabi (1937)\n\nEnoken's Chikiri Kinta Part 1: Momma, the Hat...
