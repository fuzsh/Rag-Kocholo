        "text": "“I cried for a while and wiped the dead bracken off my karate pants.”\n\nI was practicing yoga in a stand of naked dogwood trees in Kinuta Park [1]. A late-winter drizzle gave their darkening bark a slick sheen, throwing the chaotic limbs into sharp contrast against a skim milk sky. The early hour—it was not yet seven a.m.—and damp earth conspired to mute the air around me. A single, forlorn caw from a hidden crow only amplified the heavy hush.\n\nI was in the middle of the Awkward Chair pose [2] when it happened: a burly man with a neck beard tackled me and played a little jazz number on my “licorice stick,” if you know what I mean. [3]\n\nAfter he was done, I cried for a while and wiped the dead bracken off my karate pants. I thought about phoning my wife and telling her what had just gone down, but I hesitated—it seemed like I was always calling her with these little emergencies. So I decided to take out my frustration on a large crow that was perched in a nearby alder [4] and eying me with an unsettling mixture of wisdom and oblivion.\n\nSlowly, almost imperceptibly, I sidled up toward the critter until I was only inches from it. Then, with incredible calm made possible through the ancient Maoist practice of circular breathing, I thrust my heavily muscled arm toward the little mofo and extinguished its black-marble gaze forevermore."
